1
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,284
Don't worry, it's a pack of woIves.
Come on, we're aImost rid of it.

2
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,836
-CaIeb, it's after me!
-Grab on!

3
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,202
Run! Run!

4
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,745
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.

5
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,246
Come on, heIp me bury it.

6
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,250
What if someone digs it up?

7
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,495
May God have mercy on his souI.

8
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,727
-Hi, AIan.
-Hi, M ss Magruder.

9
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,365
-Afternoon, AIan.
-Hey, Frank.

10
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,641
-A yours, AIan.
-Thanks, BiIl.

11
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,690
Get him!

12
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,464
Prepare to d e, Parrish!

13
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,703
Parrish, what's the rush?

14
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,379
He's going to the factory!

15
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,547
He's going to daddy now.

16
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,735
Go on, Parrish! Run to Daddy.

17
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,869
We'II be waiting.

18
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,153
Hi, CarI.

19
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,626
Hey, AIan, my man. I gotta
show you something. Come here.

20
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,057
I've been working on this
for aImost a year.

21
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,563
I got an appointment
with your father...

22
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:58,029
...to show him this.
Go ahead, take it.

23
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,065
What do you think?
Th nk he'lI ike it?

24
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:04,739
What is it?

25
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,177
What is it? This is the future.
If WiIt Chamberain w wear them...

26
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,649
...there' be a pair of those
in every coset in America.

27
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,853
That wiII be the height of fashion.

28
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,922
What's wrong?

29
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,861
-Nothing.
-Aan!

30
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,223
Thanks, Bob.

31
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,858
What are you doing? This factory
isn't a pIayground. It's dangerous.

32
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,599
Dad, can I have a ride home?

33
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,433
Oh, AIan.

34
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,041
Is BiIIy Jessup
picking on you aga n?

35
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,038
Son, you're gonna have
to face him sooner or Iater.

36
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,215
If you're afraid of someth ng,
you've got to stand and face it.

37
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,786
Now, run on, son.

38
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,324
You know better than
to Iet the boy pIay here.

39
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,150
Sorry, s r.

40
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:58,690
-What was it you wanted to show me?
-Just a minute, sir.

41
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,633
What the deviI--?

42
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,384
Who did this ?

43
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,991
Well?

44
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,930
I d d, sir.

45
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,409
Being a Parrish doesn't mean
you can hang around with my girIfriend.

46
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,345
We're just friends.

47
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,648
Not anymore.

48
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,118
Get him!

49
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,127
I've got his bike!

50
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,863
Jerks!

51
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,362
Neat.

52
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,869
AIan?

53
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,405
Are you home?

54
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:20,185
AIan, not aga n. Come on.

55
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,059
Hard work, determination,
cheerfuI outIook...

56
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,960
...attributes that have exemp ified
the Brantford spirt...

57
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,501
...since our forefathers
f rst sett ed this town.

58
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:37,068
Despite the harshness of our native
cI me and the granite of our soiI...

59
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,742
...we have....

60
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,075
-Prospered.
-I knew it aI this morning.

61
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,213
You'II know t aII tonight.

62
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,513
-Right. Let's go.
-Sam, we have to taIk to AIan.

63
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,729
WeII, we're on our way.

64
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:58,988
Okay.

65
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,397
I toId your father what you toId me,
that it wasn't just BiIIy Jessup.

66
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,733
-If I'd known that, I wou dn't have--
-It's okay, Dad.

67
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:13,372
But I'm proud of you. You faced them,
even though you were outnumbered.

68
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,949
Since you took it Iike a man,
your mother and I have decided...

69
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:22,019
...that you're ready to go
to The CIiffside Schoo for Boys.

70
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,847
CongratuIations, sweetheart.

71
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,652
You don't want me I ving here
anymore?

72
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,420
AIan.

73
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,564
It's aIways been the pIan
that you go to CIiffside.

74
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,964
I mean, Parrishes have been going
to CIiffside ever s nce the 1 700s.

75
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,103
Even your UncIe SkyIar went there.

76
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,002
Look at this. Parrish HaII?

77
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,709
It's the main dorm tory.

78
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:52,312
This is great. Kids are on my case
here because I'm a Parrish.

79
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,986
Just wait ti I I'm Iiving
in a buiId ng named after me.

80
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,483
It was named after my father.

81
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,955
Good. Why don't you Iive n t?

82
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:05,120
I did. I wou dn't be who I am
if t weren't for my years there.

83
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,429
Maybe I don't want to be
who you are.

84
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,329
Maybe I don't even want
to be a Parrish.

85
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,834
You won't be.
Not tiII you start acting Iike one.

86
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,804
-Sam--
-Get your coat.

87
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,546
I guess I'm not ready
for CIiffside, then.

88
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:29,484
We're taking you there next Sunday.
I don't want to hear another word!

89
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,658
You won't!
I'm never taIk ng to you again!

90
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,194
-Sam....
-Don't .

91
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,662
-Sam.
-What?

92
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,167
Nothing.

93
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,262
What are you doing here?

94
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,797
I brought your bike.

95
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,971
You d dn't have to. I was going
to BiIIy's to get t myseIf.

96
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,098
I toId BiIIy to stop picking on you.

97
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:27,870
You wasted your breath.
We' taIk about t some other time.

98
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,143
What was that?

99
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,882
-You heard it too?
-Of course I heard it.

100
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,286
Come on, I found this reaIIy
weird game in the factory.

101
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,992
A game?

102
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,372
''Jumanji.

103
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:04,010
A game for those who seek to find
a way to Ieave their worId behind.

104
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,079
You roII the dice to move your token.
DoubIes gets another turn.

105
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,086
The first to reach the end w ns."
You want to pIay?

106
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,916
I quit pIaying board games
five years ago.

107
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,031
Sarah!

108
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,134
It's gotta be magnet zed
or something.

109
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,871
AIan, Iook.

110
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,579
"At night they fIy,
you better run.

111
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,809
These w nged things
are not much fun.''

112
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,219
What was that?

113
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,895
I don't know.

114
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,888
-Put it away, AIan.
-Okay.

115
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,701
Oh, no.

116
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,432
The game thinks I roIIed.

117
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,608
What do you mean,
"the game thinks"?

118
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,642
''ln the jungIe you must wait...

119
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,082
...untiI the dice read five or eight."

120
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:20,518
In the jungIe you must wait?
What does that mean?

121
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,409
Sarah!

122
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,173
RoII the dice!

123
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,179
Sarah!

124
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,854
A bed-and-breakfast is just
what this town needs.

125
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,685
It was pretty hard to pass up.
EspeciaI y fuII of furniture.

126
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,120
Oh, boy.

127
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,957
I keep forgetting
how big this pIace is.

128
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,531
Judy, Peter, come Iook at this.

129
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,869
I'm gonna put a recept on area
right over here.

130
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,964
And a bar over here in the parIor.

131
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,869
That sounds oveIy.

132
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,946
I'm sure you and your k ds
w I be very happy here.

133
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,013
WeII....

134
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,551
ActuaIIy, they're my Iate brother's.

135
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,551
He and h s wfe passed away
just Iast w nter.

136
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,425
Is this something, or what?

137
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,760
It sure is.

138
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,948
What do you think?
Is t big enough for you?

139
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,761
Peter hasn't spoken a word
since it happened.

140
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:45,627
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.
How terribIy awfu .

141
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,931
It's okay.

142
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,005
We bareIy even knew our parents.
They were aIways away.

143
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,373
Skiing n St. Moritz,
gambIing in Monte CarIo...

144
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,182
...safariing n darkest Africa.

145
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,081
We didn't even know
if they Ioved us.

146
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,947
But when the she k's yacht
went down...

147
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,822
...they managed to write
a beautifuI goodbye note...

148
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,963
...that was found f oating in a
champagne bottIe amongst the debris.

149
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,061
Excuse me.

150
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,843
They were very devoted parents.
It was a car crash in Canada.

151
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,105
-You'II send me the escrow papers?
-F rst thing tomorrow.

152
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,939
I'II have to get
a ocksmith for this one.

153
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,052
Peter, pick up your toys, pIease.

154
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,786
Peter, take this suitcase
up to the attic.

155
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,397
Then we can aII have ice cream.
And bourbon.

156
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,361
What? What is it?

157
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,295
I'm go ng to MoteI 6.

158
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,364
Oh, for heaven's sake.

159
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,161
I don't see any guano.

160
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,925
He said it Iooked Iike that.

161
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,997
That's an African bat. Some kid said
she saw some back in the 60s...

162
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,475
...but we don't get bats
Iike that in New EngIand.

163
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,939
That's what he saw.

164
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,172
WeII, whatever it was, t's gone now.

165
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:48,977
Bats aren't what I'd worry about
in th s house, anyways.

166
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,980
What wouId you worry about?

167
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,884
WeII, personaIIy...

168
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,492
...I wouIdn't want to Iive
where someone was murdered.

169
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,126
-Murdered?
-Yep.

170
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,394
LittIe AIan Parrish.
I say his father did it.

171
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,799
There's 1001 pIaces he couId've
h d the body in this house.

172
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,135
EspeciaIIy if he chopped t up first.

173
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,440
Hey up there!

174
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,740
You don't want to be Iate
for your first day of schooI.

175
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:24,418
-Not a bat in sight, ma'am.
-Hear that?

176
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,387
There's nothing to be afraid of
in th s house.

177
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,015
I can't be ieve I have to see
your pr ncipa after your first day.

178
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,849
What am I gonna do?

179
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:06,924
Let's try to reIax and finish dinner.
TaIk about something eIse.

180
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,426
We know why you got
the house cheap.

181
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,627
Twenty-six years ago, a kid
named AIan Parrish Iived here.

182
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,335
One day he just disappeared.

183
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,400
His parents chopped him up
and hid him in the waIIs.

184
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,410
That's it. I'm sick and tired
of your Iies. You're grounded.

185
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:31,482
Fine, there's nowhere to go
in this stupid town anyway.

186
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,523
Just for your information,
that wasn't a Iie.

187
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,366
Did you hear anything?

188
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,095
Do you m ss Mom and Dad?

189
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,470
No.

190
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,406
Liar.

191
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,343
Cut that out,
or they'II send you to a shrink.

192
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:33,151
Where are they gonna send you
if you don't start taIking?

193
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,764
If I get heId up
at the permit office, I'lI caII.

194
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,439
The schooI bus wiII be here
any minute.

195
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,208
You guys st have your keys?

196
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,315
You guys Iistening to me?

197
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,176
He o?

198
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:09,913
He o?

199
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,386
What?

200
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,422
Maybe I shou d wa t
ti the bus comes.

201
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,758
Did your parents
used to put you on the bus?

202
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:20,898
No.

203
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,261
Are you sure?

204
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,027
I cou d drop you off.

205
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:29,171
No, don't worry about us.
The bus w be here any minute.

206
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:33,169
Okay. PIease be good today.

207
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,083
You do hear it.

208
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,284
Hear what ?

209
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,404
Where's it coming from?

210
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,639
Let's bring it over here.

211
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,021
Weird. They're stuck.

212
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,321
"Jumanji, a game for those
who seek to find...

213
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,360
...a way to Ieave their worIds behind.

214
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,155
RoII the d ce to move your token.
DoubIes get another turn.

215
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,460
The first pIayer
to reach the end wins."

216
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,666
It's gotta be microch ps
or something.

217
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,375
You go first.

218
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,716
Okay.

219
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,286
Six.

220
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:41,539
''A tiny bite can make you itch,
make you sneeze, make you twitch."

221
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,808
Don't!

222
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:31,182
''This wiII not be an easy mission.
Monkeys sIow the expedition."

223
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,888
What is that?

224
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,827
I bet those monkeys came
from the game.

225
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,936
The mosquitoes too.

226
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,568
I didn't see th s part.

227
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,584
"Adventurers, beware."

228
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,257
''Adventurers, beware. Do not beg n
unIess you intend to finish.

229
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:47,296
The consequences of the game vanish
when a pIayer has reached Jumanji...

230
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,296
...and caIIed out its name.''

231
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,594
-The monkeys are gone.
-Good.

232
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,737
-Put it away.
-Wait!

233
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,497
If we fin sh the game,
it'II aII go away.

234
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,869
Let's do it, or Aunt Nora'lI pitch a fit.

235
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:03,446
We shou d get through t quickIy.
I mean, there's no skiII invoIved.

236
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,209
No, you roIIed doubIes.

237
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,717
You get another turn. RoII.

238
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,286
Five.

239
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:20,726
"His fangs are sharp.
He Iikes your taste.

240
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:25,097
Your party better move posthaste.''

241
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,930
I don't Iike the sound of that.

242
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,899
Someone's in here.

243
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:56,557
It's not reaI, Peter.
It's a haIIucination.

244
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,031
Run, Peter!

245
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,527
I'm back.

246
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,633
My b ke.

247
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,552
Somebody roII a five or an e ght?

248
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,918
He did.

249
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,769
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

250
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:50,933
Thank you.

251
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,976
Sorry if I scared you.
Sorry if I scared you.

252
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,135
Thank you.

253
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,837
I'm back!

254
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,414
Mom! Dad!

255
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,254
I'm home!

256
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,048
I'm back!

257
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:10,785
It's me!
It's me, AIan, Mom and Dad!

258
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:14,295
I'm home! I'm back!

259
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,993
Are you my IittIe sister?

260
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:21,060
No, I'm Judy and he's Peter.

261
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,774
Where's Mom?
Is Dad at the factory?

262
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,172
Are you...

263
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,573
...AIan Parrish?

264
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,781
Yeah. Who are you?

265
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,781
We I ve here now.

266
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,917
Where's my mom and dad?

267
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:38,953
We don't know.

268
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,091
This house has been empty
for years.

269
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,992
Everyone thought you were dead.

270
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,571
Sorry.

271
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,912
-Give me that description again.
-Rad fur and tail.

272
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:21,859
Get down off of my car, pIease,
and get up on the sidewaIk.

273
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:26,961
-What year is it?
-It was brand-new.

274
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:32,402
-No. What year is it?
-1895, remember?

275
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,701
Ninety-f ve....

276
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:37,838
You got some ID? Let me guess,
it's n your other Tarzan outfit.

277
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,779
-Twenty-six years.
-Are you from around here?

278
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:44,183
I was. But I've been n Jumanji.

279
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,084
Indones a.
He was in the Peace Corps.

280
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,360
-CarI BentIey, the soIe man.
-Is th s man reIated to you?

281
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:02,102
-Yes, he's our unc e.
-Does he a ways dress Iike that?

282
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,706
Yeah, he's a vegetarian.

283
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,907
Get out of there!

284
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,047
Monkeys. Monkeys.

285
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,216
Is he aII right upstairs?

286
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,417
He suffered a head njury
a few months ago.

287
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,871
Don't you move!

288
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,541
-Stop!
-Don't move, don't move.

289
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,077
Wait! Where are you going?

290
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,682
To find my parents!

291
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,247
Come on.

292
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,409
Wait!

293
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,537
My dad used to make shoes here.

294
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:18,298
They were the best shoes
in New EngIand.

295
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,103
Hey!

296
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:30,982
Sorry.

297
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,588
Easy, girI.

298
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,664
Do you know what happened
to the shoe factory?

299
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:48,135
Yeah, it fo ded up.
Like everything eIse in this town.

300
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,870
It's pretty co d out there.
How about some coffee?

301
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,206
Why wouId they cIose
Parrish Shoes?

302
00:36:56,247 --> 00:37:00,616
When his kid ran away, Sam put
everything he had into find ng him.

303
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,750
His time, his money....

304
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,886
Everything.

305
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,718
After a whiIe,
he stopped coming to work.

306
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,218
He just quit caring.

307
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,632
I don't think anybody Ioved his boy
more than Sam did.

308
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,196
Here.

309
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,371
You're gonna freeze out there.

310
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,740
Thank you.
Are the Parrishes stiII around?

311
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,550
-I see them now and then.
-Yeah?

312
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,477
They're over on Adams Street.

313
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,330
Our parents are dead too.

314
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,971
They were in the MiddIe East
negotiating peace when--

315
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,954
Our dad was in advertising.

316
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,918
I bet you m ss him, huh?

317
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,292
Me too.

318
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,059
There he goes again.

319
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,335
I know you're upset,
but we shouId fin sh the game.

320
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,805
We? Why do you need me?

321
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,945
Just in case any other
scary stuff comes out.

322
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,671
PIus there's a Iion
in my aunt's room.

323
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,814
Do I Iook ike a RingIing Brother?

324
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,445
She'II be home soon.

325
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,145
Won't she be surprised?
I hope she's not aIIergic to cats.

326
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,306
Larry, we need the wheeIs.
G ve me a hand.

327
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,869
-Did we h t her hard?
-No, it Iooks Iike another weird bite.

328
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:19,552
-Yeah, it's another one.
-Jesus, over 50. What's going on?

329
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,753
Easy now, easy.

330
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,994
-Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
-Who's that?

331
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,026
-The rea tor.
-Quiet.

332
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,591
L sten.

333
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,561
You hear that?

334
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,234
Hear what ?

335
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,697
Get in the car.

336
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:43,305
Okay, think. What came out
of the game before me?

337
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:46,607
There was a Iion,
a bunch of monkeys and....

338
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,341
That!

339
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:55,154
It's okay, it's okay.
It's just a bug. We're safe in here.

340
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,020
We're fine.

341
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,992
If we stay Iow,
he can't get through there too far.

342
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,431
Don't you worry. We're fine.

343
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,104
He can't get through the gIass.

344
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,273
We're safe.

345
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,570
Do you know how to drive?

346
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,412
No? That's no prob em.

347
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,785
My dad used to Iet me back
the car down the driveway.

348
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,281
Once.

349
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,449
So, what's the big deaI?

350
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,955
-BuckIe up.
-Here we go!

351
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,927
Wait a minute. What? Wait.

352
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,370
AIan, the top!

353
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,282
Piece of cake.

354
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,821
Yeah.

355
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,273
AIan.

356
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,641
Keep that thing away from me!

357
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:29,984
When are you gonna heIp us pIay?
Our aunt wiII be home soon.

358
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:34,315
Good. You can inform her that
she's the ex-owner of this house.

359
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:39,292
I hope you reaI ze with my parents
gone, this home beIongs to me.

360
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,700
Oh, thank you.

361
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,831
No more banana Ieaves.

362
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,564
Yes.

363
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,272
What do you think those monkeys
wiII do to the ecosystem?

364
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,815
He o?

365
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,381
What happened to you?
Did you shave with a piece of gIass?

366
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,919
What happened to you?
Did the CIampetts have a yard sa e?

367
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,683
I've never shaved before.

368
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,721
Where are you going?

369
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:48,729
How about Peter and I pIay,
and you just sort of watch?

370
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,399
Thanks, I've seen it.

371
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:54,537
If you won't heIp us,
what are you gonna do?

372
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:58,105
I don't know.
Pretty much take up where I Ieft off.

373
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,368
I wonder f Mrs. Niedermeyer's
stiII teaching sixth grade.

374
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,751
Come on, he's not gonna he p us.
He's afraid.

375
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:16,453
What did you say?

376
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,723
You're afraid.
It's okay to be afraid.

377
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,668
Let's set it up in the Iiving room.

378
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:32,600
You have no idea
what you're gett ng yourseIf into.

379
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:35,938
Whatever it is, we can handIe it.
We don't need your heIp.

380
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:38,377
I don't th nk so.

381
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:43,547
You think monkeys, mosquitoes
and Iions are bad?

382
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,255
That's just the beginning.

383
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:49,820
I've seen th ngs you've onIy
seen in your nightmares.

384
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:52,759
Things you can't even imagine.

385
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,331
Things you can't even see.

386
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,669
There are things that
hunt you in the n ght.

387
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:05,034
Then something screams.
Then you hear them eating.

388
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:08,807
And you hope to God
that you're not dessert.

389
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:11,113
Afraid?

390
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,444
You don't even know what afraid is.

391
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,952
You wiII not Iast
five minutes without me.

392
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,352
So you're gonna heIp us?

393
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,956
I'II watch...

394
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:33,436
...but I'm not afra d.

395
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,174
Peter, that was very cooI.

396
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:50,718
It's reverse psychoIogy.
Dad used to puII it on me aII the time.

397
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,389
Ready?

398
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:55,048
Yeah.

399
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,227
AIan, ready?

400
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:59,292
There s no ''ready.''

401
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,635
I'II try it aga n.

402
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:21,109
AIan, it's not working.

403
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,528
Oh, no.

404
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:33,027
It's not your turn.

405
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:36,732
I roIIed first. Then Peter twice
because he got doubIes.

406
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,129
Now it's my turn.

407
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:42,903
No, Iook.
Two of the pieces are yours, right?

408
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,574
Who's the other pieces?

409
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,570
The eIephant was mine.

410
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:55,982
You're pIaying the game
I started in 1969.

411
00:45:57,722 --> 00:45:59,747
I'm gonna have to pIay.

412
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,991
It's not my turn.

413
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:08,727
Whose turn ls it ?

414
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,166
Sarah WhittIe.

415
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,780
This is where she used to Iive.

416
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,543
This pIace gives me the creeps.

417
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,864
We used to pIay on this porch.

418
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,462
I knew she st wouIdn't ive here.
ProbabIy married B Iy Jessup.

419
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,164
-Come on.
-Let's at Ieast ask.

420
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:55,435
-Maybe she' know where Sarah went.
-She'lI know. She's a psychic.

421
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,113
Good point.

422
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,411
I remember the porch
being a Iot bigger.

423
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,110
He o?

424
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:07,883
-Can you heIp us?
-Do you have an appointment?

425
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:12,118
-No, we're trying to find someone.
-Madam Serena can't see anyone now.

426
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,423
Maybe you can he p us.

427
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,534
What is it?

428
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,696
We're Iooking for someone
who used to Iive here.

429
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,670
No, I've I ved here my whoIe Iife.

430
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,239
Then you must know Sarah WhittIe.

431
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,007
What do you want
w th Sarah Whitt e?

432
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,151
Sarah?

433
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,517
I don't go by that name anymore.

434
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,218
Sarah WhittIe?

435
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,921
What do you want?

436
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:53,395
Twenty-six years ago, you pIayed a
game with a IittIe boy down the street.

437
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:58,031
A game with drums.

438
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,911
How do you know that?

439
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,207
I was that Iitt e boy, Sarah.

440
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,185
AIan?

441
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:22,864
You kiIIed her.

442
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,831
Leave a message
and the doctor wlll call you back...

443
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,868
...at his aarllest convanlenca.

444
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,677
Dr. Boorste n, it's Sarah Wh ttIe.
PIease caII me as soon as you can.

445
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:36,369
I think I need
to have my dosage checked.

446
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:40,510
That event we've been discussing,
the one that didn't reaIIy happen?

447
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:45,712
I'm having an episode here w th
the boy who didn't reaIIy d sappear.

448
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,720
I'm sitting in his Iiving room,
drinking emonade.

449
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:54,090
If you cou d caII me, I'd reaIIy
be interested n your interpretation.

450
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,094
-He'II caII me back.
-WhiIe we're waiting....

451
00:48:58,302 --> 00:48:59,929
-God! No, no, no!
-Sarah.

452
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,095
-Oh, no, no, no.
-It's okay. Sarah.

453
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:06,232
I've spent 2000 hours n therapy
convinc ng myseIf that doesn't ex st.

454
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,970
What happened to you was
so awfu , I made up this thing--

455
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,407
It was awfuI. It was awfuI.

456
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,014
It reaIIy was.

457
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,653
But it was reaI. ReaI.

458
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:20,814
No, t wasn't reaI. Your father
murdered you and chopped you up.

459
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:23,289
Sarah, come on.

460
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,587
My dad did that?

461
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:29,161
My father couId bareIy hug me...

462
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,494
...Iet aIone cut me nto IittIe pieces.

463
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:37,667
Twenty-six years ago,
we started pIaying a IittIe game.

464
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,370
And now...

465
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:44,047
...we're a I gonna sit down
and we're gonna finish it.

466
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,805
And guess what?

467
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:47,684
It's your turn.

468
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,524
No.

469
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:56,017
Here.

470
00:49:58,529 --> 00:49:59,826
PIay the game.

471
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,822
-Oh, no, no.
-F ne.

472
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:08,598
Just give me the dice and you can
go home. You don't have to pIay.

473
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,636
Thank you, AIan.

474
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:14,544
Oh, my God!
How couId you do that?

475
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:17,780
It's the Iaw of the jungIe.
You'lI get used to it.

476
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:21,941
When think of the energy I spent
visuaIizing you as a radiant spirit--

477
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,813
Go on, read it.

478
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,484
"They grow much faster
than bamboo.

479
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,524
Take care or they'lI come after you."

480
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:38,429
Oh, great.

481
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,403
Oh, God.
TeII me this isn't happening.

482
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:45,972
It s. Stay away from the wa Is.
Don't touch anything.

483
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,645
No quick movements.

484
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,919
-They're beautifuI.
-Yeah, they're beautifuI.

485
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,214
Don't touch the purpIe ones.
They shoot po sonous barbs.

486
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:05,589
And defin teIy stay away from
the pods. The big yeIIow ones.

487
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,293
What big yeIIow ones?

488
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,233
Peter!

489
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,269
I got you! Get his arms!

490
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,564
Get it off me! Get it off me!

491
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,217
Oh, my God!

492
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,781
Hang on.

493
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,621
Got him? I'lI be rght back.

494
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:39,319
Oh, my God.

495
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,392
Sorry, Angus.

496
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,795
Harvest time!

497
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,413
Are you okay?

498
00:51:57,748 --> 00:51:59,113
Peter.

499
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,421
Oh, my God!

500
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:11,428
My car. Oh, my car.

501
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:13,521
Carl, come ln, pleasa.

502
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:16,063
Coma ln please, Carl.
Has anybody seen--?

503
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,159
I can't beIieve this.
Start, start, pIease. Yes.

504
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,736
-CarI? Come ln, Carl.
-CarI here.

505
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:27,468
Where have you baen?
We've got an anlmaI-control situation.

506
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:29,339
Get Stan and W y on it.

507
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:33,279
I've gotta check out a suspicious
character at the Parrish pIace.

508
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:36,544
I shouId've been a fireman.

509
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:45,552
Yeah.

510
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,492
Sarah!

511
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,628
Get your hands off me!

512
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:54,565
-The game is not over yet.
-It is for me.

513
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:56,773
You are not in the jungIe anymore.

514
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:59,772
Stop this! You don't
treat peopIe Iike this.

515
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,178
Okay.

516
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:17,486
Anybody up for iced tea?
I'm gonna make some tea.

517
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,867
PIease, Iast time I pIayed this game
it ruined my I fe.

518
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:31,173
-It ruined your Iife?
-Yes.

519
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:35,835
''In the jungIe you must wait
tiII the dice read five or eight."

520
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:38,973
I was a I ttIe girI, AIan.

521
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,447
You d sappeared.

522
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:47,285
And a bunch of bats surrounded me
and chased me down the street.

523
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,019
I was afraid.

524
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,527
I'm sorry, AIan.

525
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,356
No one beIieved me. I was aIone.

526
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,400
So was I, for 26 years, Sarah.

527
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,403
Me too.

528
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:08,603
It's okay, Sarah. We're scared too.

529
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,279
But if we finish the game,
it'lI aII go away.

530
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,112
What f I get stuck in the game?

531
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:16,752
You won't.

532
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:20,654
Because I won't stop pIaying.

533
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,221
And neither wiII I.

534
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,222
I won't either.

535
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,792
Come on, Sarah.

536
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,265
PIease?

537
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,507
I knew this was gonna be a bad day.

538
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:50,045
Come on, we'lI be fine.

539
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,255
We just have to keep our heads.

540
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,990
And roII with the punches.

541
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:18,838
"Ahunterfrom tle darkest wild . .

542
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:23,174
...makes you feeI just I ke a ch Id."

543
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,015
What is it?

544
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:27,384
Van PeIt.

545
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:37,992
You miserabIe coward!
Come back and face me Iike a man.

546
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,505
Not good enough, Sonny Jim.

547
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,811
Coming, ready or not.

548
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,432
Hey, you!

549
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:18,566
Drop your gun
and get your hands in the a r!

550
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,062
Man, I don't beIieve this.

551
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,339
Even if AIan gets out
of this situation...

552
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:59,813
... t'II happen over and over again.

553
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:04,721
When you carry repressed anger,
it attracts a Iot of negat ve energy.

554
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:08,823
Things happen, ike ending up
in the jungIe. That was no accident.

555
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,354
There are no accidents.

556
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,291
Whose turn ls it ?

557
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:15,223
-It's my turn.
-ReaIIy? Great.

558
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:18,197
You m ght've toId us
there was a man who hunts peopIe.

559
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,098
I didn't know.
It's just the ro of the d ce.

560
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,965
Is he the reason
you didn't want to pIay?

561
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:27,974
You d dn't want to pIay, either?

562
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:31,976
Mr. We-Started-26-Years-Ago-
and-Now-We-Gotta-Finish-It?

563
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:36,314
What's with this guy?

564
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,923
He's a hunter. He kiIIs things.
Right now, he wants to kiII me.

565
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,489
-Why you?
-Why me?

566
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:46,525
I don't know. You'd think
it'd be a waste of his time.

567
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,855
Maybe he needs something
for his waII.

568
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,294
It's your turn.

569
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:53,469
Have you ever taIked with him
about your d fferences?

570
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:58,835
-Are you crazy? The man has a gun--
-Don't ever caII me crazy. Ever.

571
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:03,068
Everyone's caI ed me crazy ever since
I said you were sucked into a game.

572
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,476
-Maybe I shouId roII.
-Yeah.

573
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:08,651
I was the g rI
who saw you murdered.

574
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,151
Did anyone come
to my birthday party?

575
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:14,549
-HeIIo, I'm roII ng now.
-B y who?

576
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:18,556
Are you an owI? Come on, Madam
Serena, dig into your consciousness.

577
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:20,663
-Here, just roI .
-Find the memory...

578
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,162
...of your oId boyfrend.

579
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:26,562
-The kid who'd stea your bicycIe?
-The kid who took you to the movies.

580
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:31,203
"Don't be fooIed, it sn't thunder.
Staying put wou d be a bIunder."

581
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:32,999
-You're immature.
-You are.

582
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,440
-I know you are, but what am ?
-You are.

583
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:38,271
Do you feeI that?

584
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,002
Run!

585
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,405
It's a stampede!

586
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:08,701
Come on.

587
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,346
The game!

588
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:18,787
Don't Iook back!

589
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:46,648
Not the game!

590
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,991
Why d dn't you grab the game,
Peter?

591
00:59:58,228 --> 00:59:59,786
Ignore him. He's a L bra.

592
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,827
-Where are you going?
-He'lI head for water!

593
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,432
Here we go. Come on.

594
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:06,827
-HeIIo?
-lt's Aunt Nora.

595
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:08,095
Whera have you bean?

596
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,001
I'm sorry, dear.
You have the wrong number.

597
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,238
Wait for me!

598
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:36,789
-What can I do for you?
-I'II have a gross of these.

599
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:40,330
They stopped mak ng these in 1803.

600
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:44,096
Damn. Then I shaII need
a repIacement weapon.

601
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:45,706
There's a waiting period.

602
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:49,406
And you'lI have to fiII out these.

603
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,173
Or I couId fi I these out.

604
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:55,648
Louise.

605
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,058
Now, anyone asks,
you didn't get this here.

606
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,433
You're not a postaI worker, are you?

607
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,133
AIan!

608
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:20,337
Qu et.

609
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:39,285
Here.

610
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:44,199
No!

611
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,404
-Peter!
-Peter!

612
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,540
-Peter, are you okay?
-That was great.

613
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,243
I can't beIieve you did that.
That was so cooI.

614
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,971
-You gave me chiIIs.
-It was great.

615
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,376
AIan.

616
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:10,584
Nice work. Come on,
give me the game. Let's go.

617
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:30,772
Oh, no.

618
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,305
Act naturaI.

619
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,737
Hey!

620
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:40,649
Hide the game.

621
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:48,819
Every t me there's troub e,
I run into you.

622
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:51,484
I don't know
what you're taIking about.

623
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:54,357
-I'm taking you n.
-I'm not going anywhere.

624
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,796
AII right.

625
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,661
Just a second.
You can't take him, he's--

626
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:05,431
-Her f ance.
-You said he's your uncIe.

01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:57,426
You tried to cheat?

643
01:04:57,694 --> 01:05:00,720
No, I tried to drop the dice

What, are you crying?
You don't cry, you keep your chin up.

748
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:19,808
Come on, keep your chin up.

749
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,516
Crying never heIped
anybody do anything.

750
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,014
If you have a probIem,

751
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,561
Hey. Hey.

It's okay. Come here, I'm sorry.
Hey, it's aII right.

755
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:50,937
It's aI rght to be afraid.

756
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,171
It's not that.

757
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,475
What is it?

758
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:09,264

-What happened?
-Get in.

-ShouIdn't we pIay somep ace eIse?

Look, you don't have to go

I'm forgetting what

936
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:14,201
That's okay, as Iong as

Or Judy and Peter.

Merry Christmas.

Do you want these?

943
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:17,170
Dad, the new cross-trainer's

944
01:36:17,472 --> 01:36:19,269
No, t's not a bra, it's a shoe.

945
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,702
