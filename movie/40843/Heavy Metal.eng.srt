1
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:34,211
A shadow shall fall over the universe.
And evil will grow in its path.

2
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:38,634
And death will come from
the skies.

3
00:04:26,827 --> 00:04:30,777
- What did you bring me?
- You will see.

4
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:34,121
Wait for me!

5
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:49,926
What is it?

6
00:05:00,444 --> 00:05:06,399
Do not try to escape.
You are in my control.

7
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:14,040
Look at me.
I am the sum of all evils.

8
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:17,700
Look carefully.

9
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:25,833
My power infests all times,
all galaxies, all dimensions.

10
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:34,100
But many still seek me out.
A green jewel they must possess.

11
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:39,438
But see how I destroy
their lives.

12
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:02,916
Right. Twelve degrees.

13
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,583
New York. Big deal.
Scum centre of the world.

14
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:28,839
They are even talking about letting
in low-lifes from other planets.

15
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,468
My name is Harry Canyon.
I drive a cab.

16
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:49,316
- Are you free?
- Yes. Get in.

17
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:59,490
- Where to, pal?
- The UN Building.

18
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:07,629
The UN Building? What a joke.
It is now low-rent housing, a dump.

19
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:17,719
Okay, sucker,
hand over your cash! Now!

20
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:31,111
Stupid asshole.
Nobody touches Harry Canyon.

21
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:49,667
Father!

22
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:51,709
Run!

23
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,588
He is dead. Get the girl!

24
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:05,096
Help me, please!

25
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:12,560
Normally I do not get involved,
but somehow this dame got to me.

26
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:21,653
The wanted the Loc-Nar but
my father would not tell them.

27
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:28,794
- Now I am the only one!
- Relax. Up here is a cop station.

28
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,424
You can tell them ...
Shit. Just what I needed.

29
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:48,225
- What do you want?
- To report a murder.

30
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,605
What else is new?

31
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:54,685
- Are you going to let me in?
- Yes. Hang on.

32
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:01,826
How are you, Harry?

33
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:06,290
Hello, Harry.
She could not take it?

34
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:12,122
- Kiss my ass, will you?
- I will do it for 20 bucks!

35
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:17,636
I am an American citizen.
I have lost my papers.

36
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:19,843
Damn illegal aliens.

37
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:27,391
First I must tell you
it is cash up front.

38
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:33,150
A thousand a day to investigate,
another thousand if we catch the guy.

39
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:35,892
Here is a dollar.

40
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:41,322
Thank you for nothing.

41
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:47,530
Do you think you can do better?
Punk.

42
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,623
So here I was,
stuck with a beautiful girl.

43
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:56,371
I knew she would be trouble.

44
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:19,561
- Where am l?
- My place.

45
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:23,027
They would have killed me
had it not been for you.

46
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,122
What do they want to
snuff you for?

47
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,035
The Loc-Nar. An ancient relic
my father found in the desert.

48
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:40,384
It is worth a fortune to the Venutians.
They think it has spiritual powers.

49
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:43,130
Does it?

50
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:48,930
Since we found it,
people have been dying around us.

51
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:53,646
My father hid it here in New York.
Now he is dead.

52
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:59,185
They will kill me next.
I know where it is.

53
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:02,741
Nobody will find you here.

54
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:11,124
You can sleep on the couch.
And there is beer in the fridge.

55
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:15,002
Help yourself, all right?

56
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:24,130
I did not know whether to believe her
or not. It might be a sucker play.

57
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,051
Harry ...

58
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,137
Can I sleep with you?

59
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:35,101
Yes, sure.

60
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:45,564
Sucker play or not,
I must have turned her on.

61
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:51,497
This dame was going for broke.
Maybe I was her first New Yorker.

62
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,414
Anyway, nothing beats
good old American know-how.

63
00:12:55,586 --> 00:13:00,165
And I gave her
the Stars and Stripes forever.

64
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:14,886
- Where is the girl?
- What girl?

65
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:18,730
Do not play dumb.

66
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:22,899
You came to the station last night
with a broad. Where is she?

67
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:25,230
What are you talking about?

68
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:32,163
If you hear from her, call us.
If you do not, you are dead.

69
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:36,495
- Understand?
- Do not hold your breath, pal.

70
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:48,138
- Where is the girl?
- Come on, not again.

71
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:52,141
I would not do that
if I were you.

72
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:58,890
I will get right to the point.
My name is Rudnick.

73
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:05,231
I represent a group of investors
from a nearby planet -

74
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:10,282
- who wish to purchase something
from the young lady.

75
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:16,284
The price is fair,
but they are getting very restless.

76
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:22,423
When you see her,
tell her that time is running out.

77
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,457
Thank you, Mr. Canyon.
Good day.

78
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:34,261
The burning smell reminded me
not to get involved.

79
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:37,721
But I could not get her
off my mind.

80
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:44,226
There was something about her.
An element of danger. It turned me on.

81
00:15:00,586 --> 00:15:06,624
Trans-Com Message Service.
Message for Harry Canyon.

82
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:15,547
Meet female acquaintance at
Statue of Liberty, four o'clock.

83
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:21,021
The girl. It had to be her.

84
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:35,323
But first, I had to ditch
a couple of assholes.

85
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:18,446
- Is that what it is all about?
- I want to get rid of it.

86
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:21,956
I want this to be over.
I talked to Rudnick.

87
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:26,954
He would give me 300,000 dollars
for it. But I am frightened.

88
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:31,876
- I do not trust him.
- 300 grand is a lot of dough.

89
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:34,888
- Will you help me?
- When she looked at me -

90
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:40,394
- I could not say no.
- For 50 percent of the take.

91
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:45,807
You can have anything you want.
Just stay with me.

92
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:57,241
There they are.

93
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:02,238
Okay. I will keep you covered.

94
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:06,185
Baby, we are rich. Let us take a trip,
just the two of us.

95
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:10,265
I would like to,
but I have other plans.

96
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:14,026
I am taking it all.
Pull over.

97
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:21,740
- Are you sure about this?
- Positive.

98
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:30,418
Pretty, but dumb.

99
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:38,337
Even though she would have killed me,
I felt sorry. She was okay.

100
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:40,671
Just a little greedy.

101
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:46,684
I put it down as a two-day ride
with one hell of a tip.

102
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:59,571
You have had your first lesson,
young one.

103
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:07,620
My evil
corrupts the most innocent.

104
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:18,458
I have chosen you because you possess
powers you do not yet understand.

105
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:25,219
Look again.
Look deep into me.

106
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:30,936
In some worlds
I am worshipped as God.

107
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:43,404
It all started when I found
the green meteorite.

108
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:47,112
I had read that
smaller ones like this -

109
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,165
- burn up in the atmosphere.
But for some reason this one did not.

110
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:56,749
I stuck it in my rock collection
and forgot about it.

111
00:19:56,924 --> 00:20:00,507
I experimented with electricity
and with a storm coming, -

112
00:20:00,678 --> 00:20:06,930
- I figured I would hit jackpot.
I just needed a little juice.

113
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:23,611
It works.

114
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:09,990
No hair ... Big.

115
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:16,460
I was not going to walk around
with my dork hanging out.

116
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:24,004
This looked like something
out of the Ten Commandments.

117
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:41,611
By the powers of the glowing
Loc-Nar in your idol's hand -

118
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:46,655
- I demand you come forth.
Ullatec!

119
00:21:46,826 --> 00:21:53,742
Grant me your strength in return
for a living mortal sacrifice.

120
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,665
Come forth, Ullatec!
I demand it!

121
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:02,705
Why did they do that?

122
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,780
Normally I would be dead by now.
I thought I would run out ofair -

123
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:37,079
- but my new body worked great.
Ijust hoped her body did, too.

124
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:54,309
Thank you.

125
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:57,385
She had beautiful eyes.

126
00:22:57,563 --> 00:23:02,521
I wanted to make conversation,
but I asked an old stupid question.

127
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:05,404
Are you from around here?

128
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:10,945
You may not believe this, but I am
from another world called Earth.

129
00:23:11,118 --> 00:23:13,407
I too am from Earth.

130
00:23:13,663 --> 00:23:18,371
My name is Katherine Wells.
I am from Gibraltar.

131
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:22,125
You saved my life.
I have no reward for you, but ...

132
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:30,422
If any part of me pleases you,
I would give it to you willingly.

133
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:47,565
This was great. I would never get
a chick like this back on Earth.

134
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:49,695
There was only one problem.

135
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:52,734
Come.

136
00:23:54,203 --> 00:23:59,363
Whoever these assholes were,
theypicked a bad time to show up.

137
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:15,425
They split us up and took me
to a weird castle.

138
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:31,156
I wanted to find out about Katherine,
but none ofthem spoke English.

139
00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:37,779
So, you are Den of Earth who dared
to steal the Queen's female sacrifice.

140
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:42,913
He was a shrimp, so I played it tough.
Where is the girl?

141
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:49,088
I am Ard, leader of the revolution
and the next ruler of the world.

142
00:24:49,258 --> 00:24:53,090
- The girl!
- You are fierce.

143
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:56,388
Guards, castrate him.

144
00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:11,071
I was pretty good at this.

145
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:15,616
Excellent.
You are worthy to serve me.

146
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:20,826
- Give me the girl or die.
- If I have a choice, I take death.

147
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:22,907
So be it.

148
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:27,752
You have to do better
than that.

149
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:35,714
- I saw why he was the leader.
- But if you really want the girl ...

150
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:40,088
I have had her encased in glass.

151
00:25:43,062 --> 00:25:45,138
She is dead.

152
00:25:45,314 --> 00:25:48,849
No, she is sleeping,
but only I can wake her.

153
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:52,976
- What do you want of me?
- To steal the sacred Loc-Nar.

154
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:56,489
- What is this Loc-Nar?
- The Queen's glowing sphere.

155
00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:01,368
The sacrifice to Ullatec can only
be performed by its possessor.

156
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,240
Norl!

157
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:11,789
This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
You and he will steal the Loc-Nar.

158
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:14,836
- Then I give you the girl.
- And if I refuse?

159
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:19,340
Then you die, she dies,
everybody dies.

160
00:26:19,515 --> 00:26:22,088
It sounded reasonable.

161
00:26:50,755 --> 00:26:54,883
Guard post ahead.
We must go underground.

162
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:09,179
Norl knew what he was doing.
And for a gorilla his English was not bad.

163
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:12,394
We are beneath the castle moat.

164
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:18,402
What are they saying?

165
00:27:18,574 --> 00:27:21,908
They talk of a savage beast
who prowls these catacombs -

166
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:25,447
- with teeth six inches long.

167
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:29,243
Sorry. Sixteen inches long.

168
00:27:43,557 --> 00:27:48,266
Now we separate. You and Korg take
this door into the Queen's quarters.

169
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:52,684
The rest of us will enter
from the other side.

170
00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:58,897
Whoever gets the Loc-Nar will
return it to Ard. Good luck, Den.

171
00:28:05,955 --> 00:28:08,790
Loc-Nar!

172
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:12,658
It wasjust like the ball
I dug up in the yard.

173
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:18,132
As I saw the Loc-Nar,
I had this funny feeling.

174
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:21,218
Then the lights came on.
Embarrassing.

175
00:28:21,387 --> 00:28:23,261
Kill them.

176
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:28,304
Can I slit his throat,
your Majesty?

177
00:28:28,477 --> 00:28:32,345
- Yes, slit his throat.
- Thank you, your Majesty.

178
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:38,193
Stop! I have a better idea.
Come with me.

179
00:28:38,362 --> 00:28:41,814
- Not again.
- This always happens.

180
00:28:41,991 --> 00:28:46,202
- The Queen can do what she wants.
- Yes, sure.

181
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:52,405
If you please me
I may let you live.

182
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:57,203
- What must I do?
- Satisfy my appetites.

183
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:05,010
18 years ofnothing and now
twice in one day. What a place.

184
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:33,916
The rising moon climaxes our love, Den.
It is a sign.

185
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:36,540
I had no idea
what she was talking about.

186
00:29:36,712 --> 00:29:43,331
Neverwhere is a troubled land.
You have brought peace to my body.

187
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:47,674
You could bring peace
to all the troubled people.

188
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:52,226
I knew I was good,
but not that I was that good.

189
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,723
Your Majesty,
the Loc-Nar has been stolen!

190
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:59,682
Fiend! You make love to me while
your accomplice steals my sceptre!

191
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,190
Now Ard will perform the sacrifice.
Guards! Take him!

192
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:08,232
Hold him still!
I will kill him myself.

193
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:10,575
Boy, was she pissed off.

194
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:24,751
Prepare the flyers!
I want his head!

195
00:30:36,897 --> 00:30:42,188
By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
placed in your hands -

196
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:47,652
- I command you.
Come forth, Ullatec!

197
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:23,777
Here is your sacrifice.
Ullatec, give me your power!

198
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,314
Throw her in.

199
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:29,484
- Katherine!
- Den!

200
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:32,825
No! You will ruin everything.

201
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,449
Kill them both!

202
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:41,959
- The Loc-Nar is mine!
- Stupid bitch! Get away from me!

203
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:45,415
- Give it to me!
- The Loc-Nar is mine!

204
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:42,314
- Where did they go?
- They are gone. Nothing else matters.

205
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:46,396
Theyprobably went back to Earth.
Boy, will mum be surprised.

206
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:50,020
The Loc-Nar. You could have
the power of Ullatec.

207
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:54,029
- You could rule all these people.
- Forget it.

208
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:12,043
But Den, with the Loc-Nar
you could return to Earth.

209
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:14,633
I like it better here.

210
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:20,392
On Earth, I am nobody.
But here, I am Den.

211
00:33:23,773 --> 00:33:27,640
Even when someone has
the strength to discard me -

212
00:33:27,818 --> 00:33:32,611
- mypower is not diminished.

213
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:03,635
Someone always finds me.

214
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:16,357
- Are you Captain Lincoln Sternn?
- I am.

215
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:34,504
Lincoln Sternn, you stand accused
of 12 counts of murder.

216
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:39,544
14 counts of armed theft
of Federation property.

217
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:43,099
22 counts of piracy.

218
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:49,138
18 counts of fraud.
37 counts of rape.

219
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:55,436
And one moving violation.

220
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:58,947
How do you plead?

221
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,871
Not guilty.

222
00:35:20,848 --> 00:35:26,305
- Not guilty? Are you nuts?
- It is okay. I have an angle.

223
00:35:26,562 --> 00:35:28,555
Call the first witness!

224
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:33,523
He has got you cold! You are
as guilty as a cat in a goldfish bowl.

225
00:35:33,903 --> 00:35:38,446
The prosecution calls
Hanover Fiste!

226
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:56,336
Change the plea to guilty.

227
00:35:56,509 --> 00:36:02,547
- Throw yourself on the court's mercy.
- I told you, I have an angle.

228
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:07,966
We can only hope to bury you in secrecy
so your grave is not violated.

229
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:12,932
- Plead guilty!
- Shut up. I have a angle.

230
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:16,560
- What angle?!
- Him.

231
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:24,531
- State your name for the record.
- I am Hanover Fiste.

232
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:28,280
Do you know the defendant?

233
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:35,209
Yes, I know Captain Sternn.
He is most kind and generous.

234
00:36:35,381 --> 00:36:39,924
I promised him 35,000 zulaks
to testify on my behalf.

235
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:47,765
He is a cup overflowing with
the cream of human goodness.

236
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:54,351
I have never known him
to do anything immoral.

237
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,310
See?

238
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:03,319
Unless maybe
the Preschooler's Prostitute Ring.

239
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:08,864
And he has never done
anything illegal.

240
00:37:09,457 --> 00:37:15,910
Unless you count all the times
he sold dope disguised as a nun.

241
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:21,176
He has always been a good,
law-abiding citizen ...

242
00:37:22,303 --> 00:37:24,675
Give me a break!

243
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,184
... of the Federation ...
Shut up! Shut up!

244
00:37:30,353 --> 00:37:37,767
A community-conscious individual.
Sternn?! He is just a low-down, -

245
00:37:37,944 --> 00:37:45,026
- double-dealing, backstabbing,
larcenous, perverted worm!

246
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:51,120
Hanging is too good for him!
Burning is too good for him!

247
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:57,329
He should be torn into little pieces
and buried alive!

248
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:03,050
I will kill him! Kill!!

249
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:14,851
Kill!!

250
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:27,784
Hanover, take it easy.
I am sure we can talk this over.

251
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:53,906
Good. I lost him.

252
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:09,421
Sternn!

253
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:24,982
Okay, Hanover,
you have had this coming.

254
00:40:25,486 --> 00:40:33,991
Thirty-three, thirty-four,
thirty-five thousand zulaks.

255
00:40:34,787 --> 00:40:40,742
- Thank you, Hanover.
- It was nothing, boss.

256
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:44,086
- And Hanover ...
- Yes?

257
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,124
Goodbye.

258
00:40:56,934 --> 00:41:00,469
Very few escape my grasp.

259
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:06,017
Even in death,
mypowers continue.

260
00:42:29,777 --> 00:42:34,688
- I think we are hit pretty bad.
- Go back and see how bad it is.

261
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:37,819
- Can you keep her in the air?
- Sure.

262
00:43:15,906 --> 00:43:17,105
Nelson?

263
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:01,155
Something is following us.

264
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:05,571
- What is it?
- A green meteorite.

265
00:44:05,748 --> 00:44:08,239
What? Where?

266
00:44:41,826 --> 00:44:44,032
Holden, are you okay?

267
00:44:47,456 --> 00:44:50,908
Yes. I am coming back.

268
00:45:42,261 --> 00:45:44,088
What is happening?

269
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:46,504
Shit!

270
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:49,717
From one war to another,
my influence is always present.

271
00:47:50,014 --> 00:47:57,013
The paltry armies ofthe universe
are butplaythings to me.

272
00:48:11,827 --> 00:48:15,493
Dr. Anrak, six more mutants
have been sighted.

273
00:48:15,665 --> 00:48:21,584
Do you still say it has nothing to do
with the green radiation from space?

274
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:25,415
Did the President himself pull
you off the Jupiter 6 Project -

275
00:48:25,591 --> 00:48:28,676
- to investigate the mutations?

276
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:42,477
What is the Army doing?

277
00:48:42,608 --> 00:48:47,484
My constituents are turning green.
They are growing arms on their backs.

278
00:48:47,655 --> 00:48:53,859
There is something up there in space
and the voters have a right to know.

279
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:59,285
We have no proof that the mutations
are generated from outer space.

280
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,332
Dr. Anrak has just come in.
Let us hear from him.

281
00:49:03,504 --> 00:49:06,671
There is no cause for alarm.

282
00:49:07,508 --> 00:49:10,924
As for the theories of
interference by aliens -

283
00:49:11,095 --> 00:49:13,930
- it is my firm opinion
that we on Earth -

284
00:49:14,098 --> 00:49:20,219
- are the only intelligent,
advanced civilisation in the universe.

285
00:49:29,864 --> 00:49:36,531
And whatever is causing these
mutations is not from outer space.

286
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:44,829
It is probably just an isolated,
biological phenome...

287
00:49:53,596 --> 00:49:55,754
Pretty. Pretty.

288
00:50:37,306 --> 00:50:42,549
Nice job ... How will I fix
this guy? He is fucked.

289
00:50:42,728 --> 00:50:46,311
- I guess we turned it up too high.
- Sorry, man.

290
00:50:46,482 --> 00:50:51,607
You are sorry? What about me?
I have to put this ass back together.

291
00:50:55,658 --> 00:50:58,825
- Where am l?
- Hey, who is the chick?

292
00:50:59,036 --> 00:51:03,116
Look at my clothes.
Who will pay the dry cleaning?

293
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:07,248
I demand you return me
to my office!

294
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:13,423
Too late. Molecular instabilities
all around the spacecraft.

295
00:51:13,593 --> 00:51:16,878
- You cannot leave.
- What? ls he kidding?

296
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:21,556
Instability zone.
You are stuck here.

297
00:51:21,726 --> 00:51:26,803
But I have dinner plans for tonight.
And a gynaecologist appointment.

298
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:31,726
Not anymore. Would you like a drink?
Come with me.

299
00:51:32,528 --> 00:51:36,063
You will feel better after
a glass of blo-aak.

300
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,280
Do you have diet soda?

301
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:47,081
Typical robot. The first Earth-chick
we see in years and he tries to score.

302
00:52:09,857 --> 00:52:13,143
Do we have any
Plutonian Nyborg left?

303
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:20,235
Just one bag.
It is in the transmitter compartment.

304
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:26,907
Great.

305
00:52:34,674 --> 00:52:37,378
Is this enough?

306
00:52:37,885 --> 00:52:42,713
- No. Go for broke.
- Good thinking, man.

307
00:52:50,773 --> 00:52:52,647
Nose dive!

308
00:53:48,247 --> 00:53:51,912
Wow! Good Nyborg!

309
00:54:02,637 --> 00:54:08,093
That was incredible.
I have never felt anything like it.

310
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:13,392
I am programmed to be proficient in
sexual activities. Want to go steady?

311
00:54:13,564 --> 00:54:18,522
I do not know.
I already have a boyfriend.

312
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:22,775
What he does not know
will not hurt him.

313
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:25,950
But I would feel guilty.

314
00:54:26,702 --> 00:54:31,660
Of course. Women who obtain sexual
ecstasy with mechanical assistance -

315
00:54:31,832 --> 00:54:35,451
- always tend to feel guilty.
- Really?

316
00:54:44,428 --> 00:54:50,431
I do not get it. We laugh.
We care for each other. We have great sex.

317
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:56,271
- Why can we not get married?
- We are different, okay?

318
00:54:56,649 --> 00:54:58,974
What do you mean "different"?

319
00:54:59,652 --> 00:55:02,439
Mixed marriages do not work.

320
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:08,401
I am afraid one day I will
find you screwing the toaster.

321
00:55:08,577 --> 00:55:10,404
You will have to trust me.

322
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:20,373
All right, I will marry you.
But I want a Jewish wedding.

323
00:55:20,548 --> 00:55:23,418
A Jewish wedding? Okay!

324
00:55:26,012 --> 00:55:29,178
I forgot. Are you circumcised?

325
00:56:11,974 --> 00:56:16,352
- Are you okay to land this thing?
- No problem, man.

326
00:56:18,189 --> 00:56:20,940
You are going a bit high.

327
00:56:21,108 --> 00:56:26,066
It is okay, man. I know how
to drive when I am stoned.

328
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:32,817
You perspective is fucked, so just let
your hands work as if you are straight.

329
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:50,338
Wow. Good landing, man.

330
00:56:58,771 --> 00:57:01,855
Mystories are almost over.

331
00:57:03,609 --> 00:57:11,190
I have chosen you, because you are
the future who could destroy me.

332
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:17,162
With your death
I break the chain for all time.

333
00:57:18,249 --> 00:57:24,085
Look into me one final time.

334
00:57:25,256 --> 00:57:30,416
See my evil destroy your race.

335
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:34,926
Then prepare to die.

336
00:59:38,264 --> 00:59:40,422
Death.

337
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:46,978
Death!
Death to all who oppose us!

338
01:00:01,662 --> 01:00:05,114
To the Council Chambers!

339
01:00:56,634 --> 01:01:02,138
- They are killing everyone.
- The city is burning.

340
01:01:02,306 --> 01:01:06,600
Elder, we must arm ourselves
and fight.

341
01:01:06,852 --> 01:01:15,062
Silence! We are not warriors.
We are statesmen and scientists.

342
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:16,813
It has been ordained -

343
01:01:16,988 --> 01:01:24,319
- that the race of Taarak the Defender
will aid us in times of need.

344
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:31,872
Taarak the Defender? His race is dead.
They cannot defend anyone.

345
01:01:32,044 --> 01:01:36,124
Some say the race is not dead,
that one still lives.

346
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:42,218
- One? What good is one?
- One of Taarak's blood can do much.

347
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:45,964
Elder! They are in the hall!

348
01:01:48,603 --> 01:01:52,387
Who is this last Defender?
How can he be summoned?

349
01:01:52,565 --> 01:01:58,484
It is Taarna of the blood of Taarak.
The last of the race.

350
01:01:58,654 --> 01:02:05,950
And must be summoned as Taarak
himself was summoned. From within.

351
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,828
But will he answer?

352
01:02:07,997 --> 01:02:12,742
A Taarakian must answer.
It is in their blood.

353
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:17,380
They are at the door!
They are here!

354
01:02:19,091 --> 01:02:20,669
Bar the door!

355
01:02:22,637 --> 01:02:27,298
We will summon the Defender together.

356
01:02:28,935 --> 01:02:31,686
Taarna ...

357
01:08:29,045 --> 01:08:32,544
To defend, this is the Pact.

358
01:08:32,715 --> 01:08:37,128
But when life loses its value
and is taken for naught -

359
01:08:37,303 --> 01:08:41,217
- the Pact is to avenge.

360
01:13:19,919 --> 01:13:25,625
- Hey, look. A new one.
- Where are you from, baby?

361
01:13:27,718 --> 01:13:30,505
She does not talk much.

362
01:13:31,764 --> 01:13:36,759
She does not have to talk
for what I want to do with her.

363
01:13:37,645 --> 01:13:41,180
Go on, baby.
Let us see what is under there.

364
01:13:50,116 --> 01:13:53,401
Hey, she is tough.

365
01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:59,700
- Maybe she wants to fight.
- Or maybe take us all on.

366
01:14:48,549 --> 01:14:54,422
You will find them beyond the oasis.
Towards the green glow.

367
01:15:44,897 --> 01:15:47,815
We have captured a Taarakian!

368
01:15:47,984 --> 01:15:51,518
Are you sure?

369
01:15:51,862 --> 01:15:54,400
Yes, your Holiness.

370
01:15:56,659 --> 01:16:04,571
- But the Taarakian race is extinct.
- She has the marks. I saw them.

371
01:16:08,379 --> 01:16:12,957
Have her bound and washed.
Then -

372
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,926
- bring her to me.

373
01:16:19,765 --> 01:16:21,639
What of the bird?

374
01:16:23,936 --> 01:16:25,763
Kill it.

375
01:16:46,834 --> 01:16:50,417
So this is the Taarakian.

376
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:59,503
Somehow I thought it would be more
difficult to capture a Taarakian.

377
01:17:05,853 --> 01:17:08,522
My whips.

378
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:52,432
Pull him down!
I will put an arrow through his head!

379
01:18:23,389 --> 01:18:28,015
Mount the bats! I want her dead!

380
01:20:39,275 --> 01:20:43,142
This time you die,
Taarakian bitch!

381
01:22:03,276 --> 01:22:05,517
Taarna ...

382
01:22:06,904 --> 01:22:10,984
Do not sacrifice yourself.

383
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:17,287
You cannot destroy me.

384
01:24:10,611 --> 01:24:13,067
And the spirit of Taarna -

385
01:24:13,239 --> 01:24:19,609
- is transferred across the universe
to a new Defender.

386
01:24:19,787 --> 01:24:26,703
And the power ofevil is contained
for another generation.

387
01:24:27,044 --> 01:24:34,506
And a new Taarakian is born
to protect the next.

388
01:24:35,506 --> 01:24:45,506
