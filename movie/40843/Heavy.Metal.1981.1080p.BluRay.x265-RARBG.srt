1
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,904
A shadow shall fall
over the universe...

2
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,782
...and evil will grow in its path...

3
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,453
...and death will come
from the skies.

4
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,224
What did you bring me?

5
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,727
You'll see.

6
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,980
Wait. Wait for me.

7
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,746
What is it?

8
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,009
Do not try to escape.

9
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,262
You are in my control.

10
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,848
Look at me.

11
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:13,604
I am the sum of all evils.

12
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,607
Look carefully.

13
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:22,697
My power infests all times,
all galaxies...

14
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,408
...all dimensions.

15
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,869
But many still seek me out.

16
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:33,290
A green jewel they must possess.

17
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:38,421
But see how I destroy their lives.

18
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,319
Right 12 degrees.

19
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,229
Yeah, New York. Big deal.

20
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,689
Scum center of the world.

21
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,694
Now they're even talking about letting
in lowlifes from other planets too.

22
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,245
My name's Harry Canyon.
I drive a cab.

23
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,422
Hey, you free?

24
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,175
Yeah, get in.

25
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,142
-Where to, pal?
-The U.N. building.

26
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,188
The U.N. building.

27
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:06,193
What a joke. They turned it
into low-rent housing. It's a dump.

28
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,994
Okay, sucker, hand over your cash.

29
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,871
Now!

30
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,964
Stupid asshole.

31
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,967
Nobody touches Harry Canyon
unless I want them to.

32
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,193
Father!

33
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,571
Run!

34
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,370
He's dead. Get the girl.

35
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,376
Help me! Please!

36
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,129
Normally, my rule's
don't get involved.

37
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,882
But somehow, hey,
this dame got to me.

38
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,014
The Loc-Nar....

39
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,309
They-- They wanted it, but my--
My father wouldn't tell them...

40
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,312
...and now I'm the only one.

41
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,691
Hey, relax, sister,
there's a cop station up here.

42
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,571
You can tell them....

43
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,450
Oh, shit. Just what I needed.

44
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,044
-Police. What do you want?
-I wanna report a murder.

45
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,382
-What else is new?
-Hey, you gonna let me in or what?

46
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,676
Yeah, hang on.

47
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,263
Harry.

48
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,641
How you doing, Harry?

49
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,518
Hiya, Harry.

50
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,771
She couldn't take it, huh?

51
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,607
Hey, kiss my ass, will you?

52
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,110
I'll do it for 20 bucks.

53
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,448
I told you, I'm an American citizen.
I-- I just lost my papers or something.

54
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,701
Goddamn illegal aliens.

55
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,000
Before you go any further, pal,
I gotta tell you, it's cash upfront.

56
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,419
Thousand bucks a day
for a full investigation...

57
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,713
...another thou if the assailant
is caught. Understand?

58
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,174
Yeah. Hey, here's a dollar.

59
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,971
Thanks for nothing.

60
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,561
You think you can do better? Punk.

61
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:52,359
So here I was,
stuck with this beautiful girl.

62
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,362
I knew she was gonna be
nothing but trouble.

63
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,258
Where am I?

64
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,929
-My place.
-They'd have killed me if not for you.

65
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,809
What did they wanna
snuff you for anyway?

66
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,103
The Loc-Nar.

67
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,940
An ancient relic that my father found
in the desert.

68
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:36,111
It's worth a fortune,
especially to the Venusians.

69
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,281
They think it has spiritual powers.

70
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,950
Does it?

71
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:47,122
All I know is that since we found it,
people have been dying all around us.

72
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,376
When we got to New York,
my father hid it.

73
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,461
Now he's dead.

74
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:58,133
They'll kill me next. I'm the only one
who knows where it is. They'll....

75
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,261
Listen, nobody's gonna
find you here.

76
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,975
You can sleep on the couch
if you want.

77
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,978
And there's beer in the fridge.

78
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,439
So help yourself, all right?

79
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,903
I didn't know whether
to believe her or not.

80
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:22,574
Something inside me told me....
Was a sucker play.

81
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,910
Harry?

82
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,123
Can I sleep with you?

83
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,836
Yeah, sure.

84
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:44,179
Sucker play or not, I must have
turned her on something fierce...

85
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,849
...because this dame
was going for broke.

86
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,185
Or maybe it was her first time
with a New Yorker, I don't know.

87
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:54,064
Anyway, nothing can beat
good old American know-how...

88
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:59,194
...and I was giving this broad
the stars and stripes forever.

89
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:13,792
-Where's the girl?
-Where--? What--? What girl?

90
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,339
Don't play dumb with me, cabby.
You showed up at the station...

91
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,758
...with a broad over your shoulder.
Where is she?

92
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,094
I don't know
what you're talking about.

93
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:28,265
Listen, cabbie,
you hear from her, you call us.

94
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:32,436
You don't, you're dead. Understand?

95
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,063
Don't hold your breath, pal.

96
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,950
-Where's the girl?
-Come on. Not again.

97
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,954
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

98
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,958
I'll get right to the point,
Mr. Canyon.

99
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,961
My name is Rudnick.

100
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:04,134
I represent a group of investors
from a nearby planet...

101
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:09,139
...who wish to purchase something
from the young lady.

102
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:15,145
The price is fair, but they're
starting to get very restless.

103
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:21,068
When you see her,
tell her that time is running out.

104
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:25,572
Thank you, Mr. Canyon. Good day.

105
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,955
The burning smell kept reminding me
I shouldn't have got involved.

106
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,583
But for some reason,
I just couldn't get her off my mind.

107
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,254
There was something about her.
An element of danger.

108
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,798
It really turned me on.

109
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,108
Transcom Message Service.

110
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,654
Message for Harry Canyon.
Will you accept the charges?

111
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,952
Meet female acquaintance
at Statue of Liberty, 4:00.

112
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,247
Stop. End message.

113
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,334
The girl. Had to be her.

114
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,306
But first, I had to ditch
a couple assholes.

115
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,724
That's what all
the excitement's about?

116
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,267
I wanna get rid of it, Harry.

117
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,812
I want this to be over.
I talked to Rudnick.

118
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,274
He said he'd give me
300,000 Krono-dollars for it.

119
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:28,362
But-- But I'm frightened.
I don't trust him.

120
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,697
Three hundred grand
is a lot of dough.

121
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,032
Will you help me?

122
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,784
When she looked at me like that...

123
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,912
...I knew I couldn't say no.

124
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,247
I'll come along for 50 percent
of the take.

125
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,084
You can have anything you want.

126
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,670
Just stay with me.

127
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,430
There they are.

128
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,686
Okay. I'll keep you covered.

129
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,705
Hey, baby, we're rich.

130
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:05,000
What do you say we take a trip?
Hey, just the two of us.

131
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:09,087
I'd like to, Harry,
but I've made other plans.

132
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,173
I'm taking it all.

133
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,258
Pull over.

134
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:20,557
-Are you sure this is what you want?
-Positive.

135
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,316
Pretty, but dumb.

136
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,238
You know, even though she would've
killed me, I kind of felt sorry for her.

137
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:39,201
She was okay, just a little greedy.

138
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:45,207
As for me, I put it down as
a two-day ride with one hell of a tip.

139
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,927
You've had your first lesson,
young one.

140
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:06,394
My evil corrupts the most innocent.

141
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:13,610
I've chosen you
because you possess powers...

142
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:18,073
...you do not yet understand.

143
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,076
Look again.

144
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:24,621
Look deep into me.

145
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:30,418
In some worlds,
I'm worshipped as God.

146
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,972
It all started when I found
the green meteorite.

147
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,851
I read in Faraday's Life of the Planets
that smaller ones like this...

148
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,687
...are supposed to burn up
when they enter the atmosphere.

149
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,814
But for some reason,
this one didn't.

150
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:54,776
So I brought it to my room, stuck it in
my rock collection and forgot about it.

151
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,946
I was experimenting
with natural electricity...

152
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:02,450
...and with the storm warnings up,
I figured tonight I'd hit the jackpot.

153
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,119
All I needed was a little juice.

154
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,470
It works!

155
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,348
No hair.

156
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,184
Big.

157
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,811
There was no way I was gonna
walk around this place...

158
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,147
...with my dork hanging out.

159
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,864
This looked like something
right out of The Ten Commandments.

160
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:26,034
Ullatec

161
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,037
Ullatec

162
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,624
Ullatec

163
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:40,215
By the powers of the glowing Loc-Nar
placed in your idol's hand...

164
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:44,552
...I demand you come forth, Ullatec!

165
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:50,684
Grant me your strength in return
for a living mortal sacrifice.

166
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,686
It has been ordained.

167
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,523
Come forth, Ullatec. I demand it.

168
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,527
What'd they do that for?

169
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,304
Normally, I'd be dead by now.

170
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,767
I kept thinking I was gonna run out
of air, but my new body worked great.

171
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:36,104
I just hoped her body was working
as good as mine.

172
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,455
Thank you.

173
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,957
She had the most beautiful eyes.

174
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,085
I wanted to make some conversation,
but I found my new self...

175
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,463
...asking the same old
stupid questions.

176
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,299
Are you from around here?

177
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,552
Well, you may not believe this,
but I'm from another world...

178
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,804
...from a place called Earth.

179
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,307
Earth? I, too, am from Earth.

180
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,312
My name is Katherine Wells, and I'm
from the British colony of Gibraltar.

181
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,022
You saved my life.

182
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,982
I have no reward to give you...

183
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,779
...but if any part of me
pleases your senses...

184
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,616
...I would give it to you willingly.

185
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,170
This was great.

186
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,924
There was no way I'd get
a chick like this back on Earth.

187
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,551
There was only one problem.

188
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,179
Come.

189
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,390
I don't know
who these assholes were...

190
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,644
...but they sure picked
a bad time to show up.

191
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:14,119
They split us up and took me
to this weird castle-type place.

192
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,381
I wanted to find out
where they'd taken Katherine...

193
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,758
...but none of these guys
seemed to speak English.

194
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,720
They tell me you are Den of Earth.

195
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,724
The one who dared to steal
the female sacrifice from the queen.

196
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,562
This guy was a shrimp,
so I figured I'd play it tough.

197
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,729
Where is the girl?

198
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,481
I am Ard...

199
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:47,902
...supreme leader of the revolution
and the next ruler of the world.

200
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,237
The girl!

201
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,906
Well, aren't we fierce?

202
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,409
Guards, castrate him.

203
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,799
Boy, I was pretty good at this stuff.

204
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,512
Excellent. You are worthy
to serve me.

205
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,139
Give me the girl or die.

206
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:20,685
-Well, if I have a choice, I'll take death.
-So be it.

207
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,608
You'll have to do better than that.

208
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,861
I could see why they made
this guy their leader.

209
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,281
But if you're really interested
in the girl...

210
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,620
...I've had her encased in glass.

211
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,543
-She's dead.
-Actually, no. She's sleeping.

212
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,880
-But only I can awaken her.
-What do you want of me?

213
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,841
I want you to steal
the sacred Loc-Nar.

214
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:55,386
-What is this Loc-Nar?
-The queen's glowing sphere, fool.

215
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,931
The sacrifice to Ullatec
can only be performed...

216
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,183
...by the possessor
of the sacred Loc-Nar.

217
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,227
Norl!

218
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,065
This is Norl, my bravest warrior.

219
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,652
You will go with him to the queen's
castle and steal the Loc-Nar.

220
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,780
-Then I will give you the girl.
-And if I refuse?

221
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:18,159
If you refuse, you die,
she dies, everybody dies.

222
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,037
Sounded reasonable to me.

223
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,778
Guard post ahead.
We must go underground.

224
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,663
This guy Norl seemed to know
what he was doing.

225
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,124
And for a gorilla,
his English wasn't half bad.

226
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,211
We're underneath the castle moat.

227
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,260
What are they saying?

228
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,846
They talk of the beast
who prowls these catacombs...

229
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:24,100
...with a fierce hunger
and sharp teeth 6 inches long.

230
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,021
Sorry, 16 inches long.

231
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,703
Now we separate.

232
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,123
You and Korg take this door
into the queen's quarters.

233
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,167
The rest will move
through the walls...

234
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,461
...and enter her chamber
from the other side.

235
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,964
Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first
will return it to Ard.

236
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:56,966
Good luck, Den.

237
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,601
Loc-Nar.

238
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,439
It was just like the ball
I dug up in the yard.

239
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,986
As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow,
I had this real funny feeling.

240
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,947
Then the lights came on.
Talk about embarrassing.

241
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,199
Kill them.

242
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,162
Can I slit his throat, Your Majesty?

243
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,665
Yes, slit his throat.

244
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,167
Thank you, Your Majesty.

245
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:35,671
Stop! I have.... I have
something better in mind.

246
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,508
-Come with me.
-Jeez, not again.

247
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,676
This always happens.

248
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,012
She's the queen.
She can do whatever she wants.

249
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,014
-Yeah, sure.
-Sure.

250
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,186
If you please me, I may let you live.

251
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:56,025
-What must I do?
-Satisfy my appetites.

252
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,866
Eighteen years of nothing, and now
twice in one day. What a place.

253
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:29,183
The rising moon
climaxes our love, Den.

254
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,770
-It is a sign.
-Yes, a sign.

255
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,106
I had no idea
what she was talking about.

256
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,900
Neverwhere is a troubled land.

257
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:41,988
Your strength has brought great peace
to my restless body.

258
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:46,492
It could bring great peace to all
the troubled people of this land.

259
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,204
I knew I was good,
but I didn't know I was that good.

260
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:54,625
Your Majesty,
the Loc-Nar is missing! Stolen!

261
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,629
Fiend! You make love to me while
your accomplice steals my scepter.

262
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,466
Now Ard will perform the sacrifice.

263
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:07,138
Guards! Take him! Hold him still.
I will kill him myself.

264
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,682
Boy, was she pissed off.

265
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:24,489
Prepare the fliers! I want his head!

266
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:40,963
By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
placed in your hands...

267
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,007
...I command you.

268
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,677
Come forth, Ullatec!

269
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,709
Here is your sacrifice.

270
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,256
Ullatec, now give me your power.

271
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,049
Throw her in.

272
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,302
-Katherine!
-Den!

273
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,555
No! You'll ruin everything.

274
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,229
-Kill them! Kill them both!
-The Loc-Nar is mine!

275
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,731
-Stupid bitch. Get away from me.
-Give it to me.

276
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,900
-Give it to me.
-The Loc-Nar's mine.

277
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,193
Don't you take it.

278
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,279
I know what a Loc-Nar is.
It's my Loc-Nar.

279
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:40,207
-Where did they go?
-They're gone. That's all that matters.

280
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:44,378
They probably went back to Earth.
Boy, will Mom be surprised.

281
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,839
The Loc-Nar.

282
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,719
You could have the power of Ullatec.
You could be ruler of all these people.

283
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:52,887
Forget it.

284
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:10,780
But, Den, with the Loc-Nar,
you could've returned to Earth.

285
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,782
I like it better here.

286
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,077
On Earth, I'm nobody.

287
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,538
But here, I'm Den.

288
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:26,420
Even when someone has
the strength to discard me...

289
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:31,342
...my power is not diminished.

290
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:02,790
Someone always finds me.

291
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,967
Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?

292
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,052
I am.

293
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:30,317
Lincoln Sternn,
you stand here accused...

294
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,821
...of 12 counts of murder
in the first degree...

295
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,284
...14 counts of armed theft
of Federation property...

296
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,996
...22 counts of piracy
in high space...

297
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,499
...18 counts of fraud...

298
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,002
...37 counts of rape...

299
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,174
...and one moving violation.

300
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,595
How do you plead?

301
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,519
Not guilty.

302
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,494
Not guilty? Are you nuts?

303
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,164
It's okay, Charlie. I got an angle.

304
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,374
Call the first witness.

305
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,710
But the prosecutor's got you cold.

306
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,379
You're as guilty as a cat
in a goldfish bowl.

307
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,549
The prosecution calls
Hanover Fiste.

308
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,551
Calling Hanover Fiste.

309
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,304
-Hanover Fiste.
-Calling Hanover Fiste.

310
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,319
Listen, Sternn,
change the plea to guilty.

311
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,363
Throw yourself
on the mercy of the court.

312
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,908
I told you, Charlie, I got an angle.

313
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,328
But the most we can hope for
is to get you buried in secrecy...

314
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,747
...so your grave don't get violated.

315
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,500
-Plead guilty.
-Shut up, Charlie.

316
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,919
I got an angle.

317
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,754
What angle?

318
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,006
Him.

319
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,469
State your name for the record.

320
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,514
I am Hanover Fiste.

321
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:27,184
You know the defendant,
Captain Sternn?

322
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,728
Yes, I know Captain Sternn.

323
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:34,066
And never did there live a kinder,
more generous man.

324
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:38,696
I promised him 35,000 zuleks
to testify on my behalf.

325
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:47,079
He's an overflowing cup, filled with
the very cream of human goodness.

326
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:53,252
In all the time I've known him,
he's never done anything immoral.

327
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,129
See?

328
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,885
Unless maybe
the preschoolers' prostitute ring.

329
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:08,225
And he's never done
anything illegal--

330
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:12,980
Unless you count all the times
he sold dope disguised as a nun.

331
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:20,070
He's always been a good,
law-abiding citizen--

332
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,574
Give me a break!

333
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,368
--of the Federation, and-- And--

334
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,621
Shut up. Shut up!

335
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,999
--a community-conscious individual.

336
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,751
Sternn.

337
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:38,047
He's nothing but a low-down,
double-dealing...

338
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:44,011
...backstabbing, larcenous,
perverted worm.

339
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,722
Hanging's too good for him.

340
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,974
Burning's too good for him.

341
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,768
-Hanover....
-He should be torn...

342
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:55,189
...into little bitsy pieces
and buried alive!

343
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,191
Hanover....

344
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,987
I'll kill him. Kill!

345
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,666
Kill!

346
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:25,803
Hey, hey, Hanover, take it easy.
I'm sure we can talk this over.

347
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,221
Good.

348
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,390
Lost him.

349
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:08,655
Sternn!

350
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:24,088
Okay, Hanover,
you've had this coming.

351
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,672
Now, let's see.

352
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,052
Thirty-three, 34...

353
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,971
...35,000 zuleks.

354
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,933
Thanks, Hanover.

355
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,688
-It's nothing, boss.
-And, Hanover.

356
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,025
-Yes?
-Goodbye.

357
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,498
Very few escape my grasp.

358
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:04,586
Even in death, my powers continue.

359
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,671
Even in death, my powers continue.

360
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,849
Come on, Stefan. Drop the fuckers
and let's get the hell out of here.

361
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,421
We're hit pretty bad, Skip.

362
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,715
You'd better go back
and see how bad it is.

363
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,467
Okay.

364
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,720
-Can you keep her in the air, Skip?
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.

365
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,134
Nelson?

366
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,046
Jeez.

367
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,053
Skip, something's following us.

368
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,391
-What is it?
-It's some kind of green meteorite.

369
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,436
What? Where?

370
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,390
Holden, are you okay?

371
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:52,981
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming back, Skip.

372
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,073
What the hell's
happening back there?

373
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,992
Shit.

374
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,961
No. No!

375
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:39,314
No!

376
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:47,822
From one war to another,
my influence is always present.

377
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:55,163
The paltry armies of the universe
are but playthings to me.

378
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,136
Please, Dr. Anrak! Dr. Anrak!

379
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:14,224
Dr. Anrak, six more mutants were
sighted in Arizona this morning.

380
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,894
Do you still say this has nothing to do
with the green radiation from space?

381
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:24,442
Doctor, is it true that the president
pulled you off the Jupiter Six project...

382
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,653
...so you could investigate
those mutations?

383
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,488
Doctor, answer me that, please.

384
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,491
Please, the green radiations
from space....

385
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,293
Well, what I wanna know is,
what's the Army doing about this?

386
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,045
Hell, my constituents
are turning green.

387
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,339
They're growing arms
on their backs.

388
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,843
There's something or someone
up there in space...

389
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:52,137
...and voters have
a right to know about it.

390
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,180
Senator, we have no proof...

391
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,934
...that these mutations are the result
of interference from outer space.

392
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,688
In fact, Dr. Anrak has just come in,
so let's hear what he has to say.

393
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,609
-Doctor?
-First of all, there's no cause for alarm.

394
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,738
As for the theories of interference
by alien beings...

395
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,741
...it is my firm opinion
that we on Earth...

396
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:16,411
...are the only intelligent,
technically advanced civilization...

397
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,080
...present in the universe.

398
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,832
-Thank goodness.
-That's a relief.

399
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,335
I was scared for a while, you know.

400
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,755
Very reassuring, very reassuring.

401
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:32,719
And-- And whatever is causing
these mutations...

402
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,555
...is not from outer space.

403
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:43,063
It's more likely just an isolated
biological phenomen--

404
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,115
Pretty. Pretty.

405
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,388
What is this? Doctor!

406
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,784
Oh, nice job.

407
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,371
How am I gonna fix this guy?
He's fucked.

408
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,665
Guess we turned it up
a little too high.

409
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,168
-Sorry, man.
-You're sorry. What about me?

410
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:50,088
I gotta put this asshole
back together.

411
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,178
-Where am I?
-Hey, who's the chick?

412
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,305
Look at my clothes.

413
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,016
Who's gonna pay
for the dry cleaning?

414
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:06,062
I demand you return me
to my office immediately.

415
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,650
Too late. Molecular--
Molecular instabilities...

416
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,236
...all around the spacecraft.
You cannot leave.

417
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,697
What? Is he kidding?

418
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,368
Oh, yeah. Instability zone.
You're stuck here.

419
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,954
But I have to be at my parents'
for dinner tonight.

420
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,665
And my gynecologist appointment
is on Wednesday.

421
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,835
Not anymore.
Would you like a drink?

422
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,503
Come with me.

423
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:34,340
You'll feel better after a glass
of fresh blo-aak.

424
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,093
You have any diet soda?

425
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,722
Oh, typical robot.

426
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,057
The first Earth chick we see
in 10 years...

427
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,935
...and he's gotta make a play for her.

428
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:12,003
Hey, do we have any of that
Plutonian nyborg left?

429
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,256
Yeah. Just one bag.

430
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,675
It's in the transmitter compartment.

431
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,677
Thanks, man.

432
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,476
Oh, great.

433
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:34,776
Think this is enough?

434
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:40,114
-No, go for broke.
-Good thinking, man.

435
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,126
-Nosedive!
-Nosedive!

436
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,935
Good nyborg.

437
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,615
That was incredible.

438
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,826
I've never felt anything like it.

439
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:10,997
Oh, great. I've been programmed to be
fully proficient in sexual activities.

440
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:14,542
-Do you want to go steady?
-Gee, I don't know.

441
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,545
I already have a boyfriend, but....

442
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,174
What he does not know
will not hurt him.

443
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,552
But I'd feel so guilty.

444
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,763
Of course you would.

445
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:30,516
Earth women who experience sexual
ecstasy with mechanical assistance...

446
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,936
...always tend to feel guilty.

447
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,354
Really?

448
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,074
But I don't understand.
We laugh together...

449
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:49,118
...care for each other.
We have highly proficient sex.

450
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,496
Why can't we get married?

451
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:55,375
Look, we're different, okay?
Let's leave it at that.

452
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,877
What do you mean, different?

453
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:01,297
But mixed marriages
just don't work.

454
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:06,886
I'm afraid that I'll come home one day
and find you screwing the toaster.

455
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,222
You'll just have to trust me.

456
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:17,397
All right, all right, I'll marry you.
But on one condition:

457
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,190
I want a Jewish wedding.

458
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,443
A Jewish wedding? Okay.

459
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,074
I forgot, are you circumcised?

460
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,744
You okay to land this thing?

461
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:15,538
No problem, man.

462
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,459
I think you're going
a little high, man.

463
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,960
It's okay, man.

464
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:24,922
If there's one thing I know,
it's how to drive when I'm stoned.

465
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,050
Like, you know
your perspective's fucked...

466
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:31,679
...so you just gotta let your hands
work the controls as if you're straight.

467
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,363
Good landing, man.

468
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,625
My stories are almost over.

469
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:04,670
I have chosen you...

470
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:09,967
...because you are the future
who could destroy me.

471
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:16,474
With your death,
I break the chain for all time.

472
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:22,730
Look into me one final time.

473
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:29,362
See my evil destroy your race.

474
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:33,241
Then prepare to die.

475
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,616
Death.

476
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,494
Death!

477
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:46,290
Death to all who oppose us!

478
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:03,975
To the council chambers!

479
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:58,237
They're killing everyone.
We must escape.

480
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:01,032
The city is burning.

481
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,784
Elder, we must arm ourselves.

482
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,369
We must fight.

483
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,413
Silence!

484
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,916
We are not a race of warriors.

485
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,919
We are statesmen and scientists.

486
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,755
From our very beginning,
it was ordained...

487
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,215
...that the warrior race
of Taarak the Defender...

488
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:23,137
...would aid us in times of need.
This was the pact.

489
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:28,225
Taarak the Defender?
His race is dead.

490
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,603
They cannot defend anyone.

491
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:34,565
Some say that the race is not dead,
that one still lives.

492
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:37,276
One? What good is one?

493
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:40,696
One of Taarak's blood can do much.

494
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,407
Elder, they're in the hall!

495
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:50,873
Well, who is this last Defender?
How can he be summoned?

496
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:57,171
It is Taarna, of the blood of Taarak
the Defender, the last of the race...

497
01:01:57,339 --> 01:02:02,009
...and must be summoned as my
forefathers summoned Taarak himself:

498
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,470
From within.

499
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,597
But will this Defender answer?

500
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:09,850
A Taarakian has no choice.
They must answer.

501
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:11,644
It is in their blood.

502
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,730
They're at the door.

503
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,190
They're here!

504
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:18,359
In the halls, quickly.
We must do something.

505
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:20,152
Bar the door.

506
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,740
We will summon
the Defender together.

507
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:30,329
Taarna.

508
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:34,166
Taarna.

509
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:38,921
Taarna.

510
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,591
Taarna.

511
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,637
Taarna.

512
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:31,398
To defend, this is the pact.

513
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:35,778
But when life loses its value
and is taken for naught...

514
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,906
...then the pact is to avenge.

515
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:22,147
Hey, look. A new one.

516
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,608
Where you from, baby?

517
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:29,196
Doesn't talk much, does she?

518
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:33,950
She doesn't have to talk
for what I wanna do with her.

519
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,706
Come on, baby,
let's see what's under there.

520
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:52,260
Hey, she's tough.

521
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,971
Maybe she wants to fight.

522
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:58,725
Or maybe she wants
to take us all on.

523
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:50,193
You'll find them over there,
beyond the oasis...

524
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:53,029
...towards the green glow.

525
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:46,666
A Taarakian.
We have captured a Taarakian.

526
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,752
A Taarakian?

527
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,587
Are you sure?

528
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:52,589
Yes, Your Holiness.

529
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:58,637
But the Taarakian race is dead...

530
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,222
...extinct.

531
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,683
She has the marks, Holiness.
I saw them.

532
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,731
Have her bound and washed.

533
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:12,484
Then...

534
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,446
...bring her to me.

535
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,659
And what of the bird?

536
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,663
Kill it.

537
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,602
So this is the Taarakian.

538
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:54,526
Somehow, I thought
it would be more difficult...

539
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:57,153
...to capture a Taarakian.

540
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:05,996
My whips.

541
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,831
Pull him down.
I'll put an arrow through his head.

542
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:23,948
Mount the bats!

543
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:27,327
I want her dead!

544
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:42,003
This time you die, Taarakian bitch!

545
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,502
Taarna.

546
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:10,049
Do not sacrifice yourself.

547
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,097
You cannot destroy me.

548
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:32,238
No!

549
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,954
No!

550
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:48,004
No!

551
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:15,133
And the spirit of Taarna
is transferred across the universe...

552
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,177
...to a new Defender...

553
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:22,473
...and the power of evil
is contained...

554
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:25,601
...for another generation...

555
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:29,313
...and a new Taarakian is born...

556
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:33,067
...to protect the next.
