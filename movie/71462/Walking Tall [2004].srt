2
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:29,886
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

3
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:31,096
See you tomorrow.

4
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,305
How you doing?

5
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,807
Okay.

6
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:24,019
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.

7
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:26,689
If you're looking for work,
you may want to try Aberdeen.

8
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:28,899
That's about the closest mill work
you'll find.

9
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:31,109
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.

10
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,112
You know, we have a really nice casino,
the Wild Cherry.

11
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,781
Want to make some money,
maybe you ought to go on down...

12
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:38,700
and try your luck at the blackjack tables.

13
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:40,785
No, I don't think so. Thanks.

14
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:42,703
You're Chris Vaughn?

15
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,791
Well, hell. I know all about you, Chris.

16
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:50,711
I know your folks. I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.

17
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,213
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!

18
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:56,007
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.

19
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,217
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.

20
00:03:58,509 --> 00:03:59,802
Well, hell, Chris.

21
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:03,597
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

22
00:04:03,806 --> 00:04:05,182
- I insist.
- I'll walk.

23
00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:06,517
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.

24
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:09,603
I won't take no for an answer. Get in the car.

25
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:15,191
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.

26
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:17,819
I scared him.

27
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,410
You were gone a while, huh?

28
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,413
Eight years. Harstad was sheriff back then.

29
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:31,790
Aaron Harstad, yeah.

30
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,584
Sad story.

31
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:39,297
About five months back,
he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.

32
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:43,092
Car folded up like an accordion.

33
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,679
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.

34
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,784
All right.

35
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:17,999
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.

36
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:24,088
It's election month. I'm your man.

37
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:29,009
Okay. Say hey to your old man.

38
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:31,219
Let's go.

39
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:58,494
Can I help you?

40
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,916
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.

41
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:14,718
- You look great.
- What is this?

42
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,012
I couldn't let you be
the only one looking good in uniform.

43
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,306
Hey, Ma. Chris is here.

44
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:22,892
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.

45
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,019
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.

46
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:28,188
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?

47
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,486
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?

48
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,321
For good. I'm home.

49
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:38,614
- Really? You're not kidding?
- No.

50
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:45,913
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.

51
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,209
I wish you had told us exactly when
you were coming. I'd have cooked.

52
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,086
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.

53
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,380
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?

54
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:59,008
I was planning to work at the mill,
but you never mentioned it closed.

55
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:01,594
We didn't want to bother you
when your father got laid off.

56
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:03,804
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.

57
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:07,016
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in...

58
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:08,892
we try to keep things simple.

59
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,102
Pete.

60
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:13,605
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.

61
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:15,190
Sit down. Say hello.

62
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:17,317
Last time he saw you,
you were barely walking.

63
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:20,111
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.

64
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,404
It was Chris' room first.

65
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:24,490
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.

66
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:26,992
Doesn't look like it's going to rain
to me, Colonel.

67
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,410
Sit down. Eat something.

68
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:30,912
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.

69
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,289
A grunt.

70
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:35,500
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!

71
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:40,379
Poppa's still got your gun locked up
in the garage.

72
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:44,091
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.

73
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,511
No. I'm still hoping
you'll melt that thing down on your own.

74
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,097
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.

75
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:52,891
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.

76
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:54,517
- 10:30.
- 10:00.

77
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,186
Remind you of anyone?

78
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:47,608
Okay, it rained. Happy?

79
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:50,610
No.

80
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,282
Why don't you crash on the floor?

81
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:00,912
Okay. I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.

82
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:11,505
Keep you dry.

83
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:16,092
Did you really kill people?

84
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,293
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.

85
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:56,588
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.

86
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,715
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

87
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:01,384
What is that?

88
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:04,386
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?

89
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:10,309
- How you been?
- Good.

90
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:12,310
- Clean living?
- Please. You want a beer?

91
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,605
No. Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.

92
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:17,106
Okay. Here.

93
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:18,608
Thanks, man.

94
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:23,112
Like that? When you left town...

95
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,990
it gave me the idea I should do something
with my life, too.

96
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:30,202
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar,
and became all about music.

97
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:33,580
And then, pretty soon,
I was about music and drugs...

98
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:36,499
and pretty soon
I was basically just about drugs...

99
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,502
and ended up doing two years for B and E.

100
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:42,713
I'm sorry.

101
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:47,801
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.

102
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,013
Doing construction and renewing
those supportive and healthy friendships...

103
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:53,306
from my past.

104
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,601
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards,
told them you were back...

105
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,604
and they asked me
to politely remind you that it is Saturday.

106
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:02,106
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.

107
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:10,113
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.

108
00:11:10,197 --> 00:11:11,198
We're still doing it.

109
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:13,992
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely. Let's go, superstar!

110
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,287
- Just like the old days. Go deep.
- Come on.

111
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,998
When did that happen?

112
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:22,291
Jay Hamilton Field.

113
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,294
His parents hadn't left him the mill
for more than two minutes...

114
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,212
- before he shut it down.
- Why?

115
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:29,298
Heads up!

116
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:31,591
Because I opened my casino.

117
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,219
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?

118
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,095
Still got your reflexes.

119
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:39,015
What? Did you get tired
of being all that you could be?

120
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:41,100
- No. I'm still all I can be.
- Really?

121
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,602
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.

122
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,314
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax. Catch my breath.

123
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:48,815
- You? Relax?
- Yeah.

124
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:54,487
Not today.

125
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:58,700
I got it.

126
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:00,910
Let's go. Come on!

127
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:10,919
Is that how it's going to be?

128
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,796
That's how it is.

129
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,799
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch. Too rough?

130
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:17,091
Sorry, ladies.

131
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:21,387
Pick up the outside!

132
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:26,684
- Fumble!
- Set!

133
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,812
How's that for touch?

134
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:34,899
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?

135
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:36,317
- That the best you got?
- What?

136
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:38,403
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?

137
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,488
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.

138
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:51,790
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going. We're not going to go.

139
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:00,089
You almost caught it.

140
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,596
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.

141
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,390
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.

142
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,810
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross. You stay in and block.

143
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:16,020
Booth? Isolate on Vaughn.

144
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:17,981
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.

145
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:20,399
- Go low. Left knee.
- All right, man.

146
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:23,402
You got it? On the first hut. Ready? Break!

147
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,779
Be strong.

148
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:31,201
All right, Chris Vaughn. Last chance.

149
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:35,497
- Black-nineteen! Black!
- Watch the outside!

150
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:41,919
I'm open!

151
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:50,510
That's game.

152
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:53,680
Sorry about that.

153
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:57,183
Cool, man.

154
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:04,815
Nice game, ladies.

155
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:07,192
What the hell was that?

156
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:17,118
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?

157
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:22,081
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.

158
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:24,792
Good to be back.

159
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:26,919
See you around.

160
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:31,089
If you're not doing anything later on,
want to come by the casino?

161
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:35,385
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me. What do you say?

162
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:40,681
- See you tonight.
- Cool.

163
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:42,600
I'll see you later on.

164
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:47,187
Be good.

165
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,820
Hey, Sarge. Good game. Maybe next time.

166
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:58,614
Hold up.

167
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,620
Maybe next time I won't see you
in the bleachers, smoking weed.

168
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:15,713
Welcome home, buddy.

169
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:20,384
I thought you had to be Native American
to own a casino.

170
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:23,721
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.

171
00:15:23,888 --> 00:15:27,307
And what he slid under the table
convinced the powers that be it was true.

172
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:31,019
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.

173
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:33,605
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.

174
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:36,608
Just so you guys know,
I'm done after I triple my money.

175
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:38,609
That's what you said last time.

176
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:40,695
You wound up selling your body
for bus fare.

177
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:42,113
He had to walk.

178
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,907
Nobody's going to have any problems
finding this place.

179
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:48,619
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics
that I find most impressive.

180
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:51,204
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.

181
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,916
- Hi there.
- Hi. How you doing?

182
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:02,006
- See? Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.

183
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:05,009
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips. Let's gamble.

184
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:07,302
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?

185
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:12,891
Isn't it wonderful? All your gambling needs
under one great, big roof.

186
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:17,520
You got your ATM machines,
tellers to cash your paycheck...

187
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:20,398
and when you're here,
you don't got to worry about things...

188
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:24,693
like child support, rent,
laws of mathematical probability.

189
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:34,703
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like
to invite you to the VIP lounge.

190
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,089
- The dream team. You all healed up?
- Nice place.

191
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,508
Welcome to my world.

192
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,511
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.

193
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:56,389
If you need
a little female companionship, done.

194
00:16:57,098 --> 00:16:58,099
All right?

195
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,018
- Get inside. Have a good time.
- Where you going?

196
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:04,188
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do. Enjoy.

197
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:09,693
Just remember,
nothing in here is free. Ma'am.

198
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,196
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.

199
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:15,698
Come on, this place is nothing
but fake boobs...

200
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:18,201
and real assholes, if you ask me.

201
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:19,410
Just water for me.

202
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,204
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.

203
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,206
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.

204
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:25,916
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.

205
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:28,710
Let's play, boys.

206
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,296
Go right ahead.

207
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:33,215
Already lost $1...

208
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,716
Good night.

209
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:37,885
Okay. Don't say we never did nothing
for you.

210
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:41,389
Don't worry, buddy,
everybody's scared their first time.

211
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:43,516
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.

212
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,811
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.

213
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:51,481
- This'll get you started.
- lf you're not back by morning...

214
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:53,108
we'll send a search party.

215
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:54,901
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.

216
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:08,719
You from here, or are you just visiting?

217
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:13,890
A little of both.

218
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:17,185
I grew up here.

219
00:19:19,312 --> 00:19:21,397
So you're seeing all the old faces.

220
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:24,316
You could say that.

221
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:35,493
Your voice sounds very familiar.

222
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,501
Chris.

223
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:45,586
Deni.

224
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:09,107
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?

225
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:13,403
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?

226
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,780
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.

227
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,408
Let's go.

228
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:21,202
Six, easy six. Looking for a six to win.

229
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:23,204
We can do a six. Can we do a six?

230
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:25,289
I think I can do a six, right?

231
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,500
We got liftoff! Whack it, boys. Whack it.

232
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:31,795
Blue or pink, what do you think?

233
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:36,216
Who's up for two out of three?

234
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:39,093
I'm getting killed. Let me have a C-note
to put $200 on a bet.

235
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,303
- No.
- Come on.

236
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:41,721
Hell, no.

237
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,013
Look at them.

238
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:45,683
He's hot.

239
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:49,811
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.

240
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:51,813
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.

241
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,607
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.

242
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:57,402
There's another $100. Boom.
Give me some dice.

243
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,612
Looking for a six.

244
00:20:59,987 --> 00:21:02,406
All right. Oh, please. Please.

245
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:04,617
Thank you. And you.

246
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:08,412
- Jimmy, don't roll. Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.

247
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,706
Hard six, six. Looking for a six.

248
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:15,210
Seven out. Line in, the dark side wins.

249
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:17,003
Last come'll get you some.

250
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:24,301
- You're good. But I saw it.
- Saw what?

251
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:26,595
I saw the switch.

252
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:28,597
This is a clean game, asshole.

253
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,017
Let's see about that.

254
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:36,479
Bet you'll roll a seven.

255
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,816
It's not your roll, sir.

256
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,195
Sir, it's not your roll.

257
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,989
Will you call security?

258
00:21:47,114 --> 00:21:49,116
Put your bets down on the passline.

259
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:51,993
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?

260
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:54,204
No. We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.

261
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:55,997
The dice are coming up seven.

262
00:21:57,081 --> 00:22:00,084
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.

263
00:22:02,795 --> 00:22:05,381
- What a surprise.
- No, folks. No payouts.

264
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:07,007
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.

265
00:22:07,216 --> 00:22:09,217
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.

266
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:11,219
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.

267
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:12,304
You're not the shooter.

268
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:14,389
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.

269
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:19,018
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.

270
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:21,812
Does your boss know about this?

271
00:22:22,897 --> 00:22:24,690
Just give me my money.

272
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:34,783
Come on. Let's go.

273
00:22:52,892 --> 00:22:54,518
What now, bitch? Come on!

274
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:39,684
Special Forces.

275
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,104
Wow. I'll take that.

276
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:55,282
What are you doing?

277
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,288
Special Forces. Special treatment.

278
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:07,919
This guy knows Hamilton.

279
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:17,302
You just hold him down. Come on, Burke.

280
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,716
Folks.

281
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:03,887
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.

282
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:06,889
Whoever did this left him for dead.

283
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,100
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.

284
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:12,811
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...

285
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,606
I'll also need a copy of your write-up,
with toxicology...

286
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,108
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?

287
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,901
I'm just trying to get some facts.

288
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,988
You need to be arresting whoever tried
to kill my brother, not testing his blood.

289
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,700
I'm just doing my job, Michelle. Okay?
I understand how you feel.

290
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,785
But we still don't know who started all this.

291
00:25:29,994 --> 00:25:33,080
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.

292
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:36,083
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn. I really will.

293
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,919
In the meantime I have to file a full report.

294
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:42,881
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.

295
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:49,887
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.

296
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:15,786
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you. They're for my best friend.

297
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:20,916
Hey, Sarge. So much for our VIP status.

298
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:29,715
Don't they teach you
any basic fighting skills in the Army?

299
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:31,008
How did you do?

300
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:35,012
Not good. But I tell you,
that guy was feeling me this morning.

301
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:42,811
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.

302
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:47,398
Chris, I don't know if you noticed,
but this ain't exactly home anymore.

303
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:06,582
Hang on.

304
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,420
Let me help you. Come on.

305
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,184
I'm good, Mom. I got it.

306
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,189
- Need some help?
- No. I'm just milking it.

307
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:37,903
There's some old crutches in the garage.

308
00:27:41,781 --> 00:27:44,909
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches. That's nice.

309
00:27:57,796 --> 00:27:59,214
Did you see the hole?

310
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:11,517
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.

311
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:17,314
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.

312
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:18,482
You make this?

313
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,816
Need anything?

314
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:22,610
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man. It's good.

315
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,988
No, I'm good, Dad. Thanks.

316
00:28:50,094 --> 00:28:52,805
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.

317
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:55,516
I might've had serious issues
with your career choice...

318
00:28:55,682 --> 00:28:59,102
but it just didn't seem fair
to take it out on an innocent truck.

319
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:01,688
Where you headed?

320
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:04,190
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?

321
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:05,400
Let's go.

322
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:18,995
Your whole life,
all you wanted to do was get out of here.

323
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:21,206
What made you come back now?

324
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,584
You're going to think I'm crazy.

325
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:27,003
I would think about the mill.

326
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:31,882
When I was a kid going to visit you at work,
the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...

327
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:35,594
You remember that smell.

328
00:29:37,095 --> 00:29:40,015
I remember a lot of nice things
before the mill closed.

329
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:46,896
When did they go out of business?

330
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:48,981
Closed about six months ago.

331
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:52,484
There's a Home Depot
about 15 minutes up the road.

332
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:55,112
And that?

333
00:29:58,198 --> 00:29:59,282
Don't ask.

334
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,218
First of all, I just want to say thanks.

335
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:24,389
- For what?
- For making that stickman.

336
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:28,100
He's been fired
and his gaming permit's been pulled.

337
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:33,314
I just have no idea
why my security cameras didn't catch that.

338
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:39,611
They miss a lot in your place,
don't they, Jay?

339
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:43,907
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.

340
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:46,200
Wait a second.

341
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:50,996
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy. Understandably.

342
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,792
You don't know what kind of assholes
they have to put up with on a daily basis.

343
00:30:55,084 --> 00:30:57,002
Look, they've been reprimanded.

344
00:30:57,294 --> 00:30:59,004
But they say you went nuts, man.

345
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:01,089
I'm sorry. Insensitive.

346
00:31:01,298 --> 00:31:04,092
I know the proper term that vets use
is post-traumatic stress...

347
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,512
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever. You tore my place apart...

348
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:10,514
and it wasn't easy to get my guys
to agree not to press charges.

349
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:13,892
Chris, if you had a problem,
shouldn't you have come to me?

350
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,480
I want to bring you inside.

351
00:31:19,106 --> 00:31:21,316
I want to make you head of security.

352
00:31:22,192 --> 00:31:24,986
- What do you say?
- No.

353
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:36,788
I guess you probably need time
to think about it. I figured as much.

354
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,293
This is for you.

355
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,088
It's a little something to help you get,
you know...

356
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:49,091
Come on, man, don't be like that.

357
00:31:49,216 --> 00:31:53,387
I came all the way out here to your house,
just to see you get back on your feet.

358
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,098
I'm going to the sheriff.

359
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,185
I'm really sorry you feel that way.

360
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:05,189
I'll see you around, Chris.

361
00:32:18,618 --> 00:32:20,787
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?

362
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,291
Excuse me.

363
00:32:26,793 --> 00:32:28,002
Excuse me.

364
00:32:29,211 --> 00:32:30,713
I got to call you back.

365
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:33,799
Hey, Chris.

366
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:37,094
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.

367
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:38,887
I'm here to press charges.

368
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:42,599
This isn't about that incident
at the casino a while back?

369
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:44,017
Yeah. It is.

370
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:46,185
Because that matter's closed.

371
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:50,398
You're lucky you weren't brought in
on charges. I mean...

372
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:52,399
Did you even look into it?

373
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:56,695
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.

374
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:58,697
An internal investigation?

375
00:33:00,198 --> 00:33:03,284
I know you're familiar
with the term no-fly zone.

376
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:05,912
Because that's what the casino is.

377
00:33:06,204 --> 00:33:08,289
Since the mill closed down...

378
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:12,084
that casino is the main source
of revenue in this town.

379
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:15,295
So case closed, basically.

380
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:18,298
We'll see you.

381
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:23,011
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?

382
00:33:31,185 --> 00:33:35,481
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.

383
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:41,403
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.

384
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:44,614
This is my town. Okay?

385
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,491
I'm the sheriff here.

386
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:49,702
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.

387
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:54,498
Now please get out of my building.

388
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:18,895
- Come in.
- Thanks.

389
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:21,189
This belongs to you.

390
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:25,818
I appreciate that. I thought this was history.

391
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:28,613
- Could have left it in the trash, but l...
- Deni?

392
00:34:28,696 --> 00:34:31,407
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.

393
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:37,412
Can I talk to you outside for a second?

394
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:39,789
Quick walk. Mom, I'll be right back.

395
00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:47,380
- How you been?
- Been better.

396
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:50,508
Talk to the sheriff yet?

397
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,011
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.

398
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,888
He sure as hell didn't seem
like much of a sheriff.

399
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,599
He's up for reelection, you know.

400
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:03,311
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.

401
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:07,190
How about you?

402
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:11,110
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.

403
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:12,611
Been reading these books.

404
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:15,489
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.

405
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,617
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?

406
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,702
I have my moments.

407
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,497
So, the casino, huh?

408
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,209
Yeah. Been there almost a year.

409
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,213
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.

410
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:36,091
I like that.

411
00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:39,719
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself,
hasn't he?

412
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:41,805
He's a real go-getter, that one.

413
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:44,682
He must be. I heard he got you.

414
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:50,813
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.

415
00:35:54,191 --> 00:35:56,109
You still work for him, though.

416
00:35:56,902 --> 00:35:58,695
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.

417
00:35:59,988 --> 00:36:01,197
I suppose so.

418
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,618
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?

419
00:36:20,215 --> 00:36:21,716
Thanks for the jacket.

420
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:26,512
And where is he?

421
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:43,319
It's okay, Mom. He's stabilized.

422
00:36:45,488 --> 00:36:46,614
It was close.

423
00:36:47,198 --> 00:36:48,282
Crystal meth.

424
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:50,910
I'm sorry. I never did it before.

425
00:36:51,118 --> 00:36:54,204
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.

426
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,003
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...

427
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,004
Stop.

428
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:06,799
Where?

429
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:09,385
From the security guys
working at the casino.

430
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:14,515
Chris, wait. Call the police.

431
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,808
No. It won't do any good.

432
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:29,695
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.

433
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:33,782
What are you doing?

434
00:37:35,993 --> 00:37:37,703
No, Chris. Not like this.

435
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:40,914
Listen to me.

436
00:37:40,997 --> 00:37:44,209
If you go out of here with that gun,
they're going to nail...

437
00:38:26,914 --> 00:38:28,499
I've been looking for you.

438
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:20,310
Guess that changes our relationship
a bit, huh?

439
00:41:01,507 --> 00:41:03,884
You should not have come
looking for trouble.

440
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:07,012
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.

441
00:41:07,304 --> 00:41:08,180
Now!

442
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:13,810
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.

443
00:41:14,102 --> 00:41:15,812
Put your hands on the hood.

444
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:24,319
I advise you to give this offer
more than a little serious thought.

445
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,197
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.

446
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,990
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.

447
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:32,118
Normally they wouldn't even
put it on the table...

448
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:34,495
but your military record can't be ignored.

449
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:37,790
Three months home arrest,
some community service...

450
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:42,002
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.

451
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:44,296
Look at it from the other side.

452
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:47,883
There's over a dozen witnesses,
none of whom will paint a flattering picture.

453
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:50,719
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.

454
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:53,096
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.

455
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:55,807
They're only offering me this deal
just to keep me quiet.

456
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:57,892
I still say you should take it.

457
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:01,312
I wasn't wrong. And I won't say I was.

458
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,982
Our job is to keep order.

459
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,984
There was no chance
of that once he came in.

460
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,780
Me and my men,
we were just trying to control him.

461
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:17,702
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.

462
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:23,415
So violent, so dangerous,
so highly trained...

463
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:28,086
that he dispatched six
of the casino security staff single-handedly.

464
00:42:28,795 --> 00:42:30,880
Six men, single-handedly.

465
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,510
His weapon of choice,
a simple piece of cedar...

466
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:40,514
which, in his hands,
became a devastating force with one aim:

467
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:43,392
To hurt people and destroy property.

468
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:51,399
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.

469
00:42:51,691 --> 00:42:55,319
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct. My right forearm.

470
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:59,782
Both bones with a single shot. It was crazy.

471
00:43:01,408 --> 00:43:03,118
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.

472
00:43:03,285 --> 00:43:06,413
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.

473
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,583
Did he give you
any kind of advance warning...

474
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,794
a chance to defend yourself?

475
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:16,297
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.

476
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,800
Besides, he seemed to be too busy
enjoying himself from what I could see.

477
00:43:20,092 --> 00:43:22,803
So from what you saw,
he seemed to have some kind of purpose?

478
00:43:23,011 --> 00:43:24,096
He had a point to prove.

479
00:43:24,304 --> 00:43:27,307
I was emptying machines
when he came in and started swinging.

480
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:29,684
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.

481
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:31,686
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.

482
00:43:31,895 --> 00:43:33,396
He seemed like a complete psychopath.

483
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:35,815
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.

484
00:43:35,982 --> 00:43:37,400
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.

485
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:38,984
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.

486
00:43:39,193 --> 00:43:40,402
I have no further questions.

487
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:44,490
Mr. Crowe, you may present
your client's case.

488
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:47,200
You're fired.

489
00:43:51,788 --> 00:43:55,583
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.

490
00:43:57,918 --> 00:43:59,003
Order!

491
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:07,302
If you choose to represent yourself,
and not be represented by legal counsel...

492
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:11,306
you realize that you can't
then claim a mistrial on that basis?

493
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,892
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.

494
00:44:23,484 --> 00:44:25,611
I don't deny anything
that was said here today.

495
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:27,988
Does that mean
you're changing your plea to guilty?

496
00:44:28,196 --> 00:44:29,781
I'm not guilty of anything...

497
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,200
except standing up for myself
when the law wouldn't.

498
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:35,119
Objection. He's trying
to introduce prior events.

499
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:38,414
Sustained. Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.

500
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:43,710
I grew up in this town.

501
00:44:44,086 --> 00:44:46,588
People used to walk tall in this town.

502
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,382
They wouldn't have traded the mill
for a crooked casino.

503
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:51,593
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...

504
00:44:51,718 --> 00:44:54,721
And they wouldn't have stood around
while drugs were sold to kids.

505
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:55,805
- Objection!
- Sustained.

506
00:44:56,013 --> 00:44:59,183
Mr. Vaughn, you're close
to being held in contempt.

507
00:44:59,683 --> 00:45:01,185
I was justified in what I did.

508
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:04,605
And if you acquit me of these charges,
then I'm gonna run for sheriff.

509
00:45:04,813 --> 00:45:07,190
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.

510
00:45:07,315 --> 00:45:08,984
Order.

511
00:45:10,485 --> 00:45:12,320
Please take your seat.

512
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,406
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged
with contempt.

513
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:17,617
And I will make sure that this...

514
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:18,784
- Objection.
- Sustained.

515
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:21,996
...never happens to anyone again
without punishing those who did it.

516
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:24,706
I'm ordering the jury to ignore
what they've just seen.

517
00:45:24,915 --> 00:45:27,000
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.

518
00:45:30,712 --> 00:45:32,088
Order.

519
00:45:33,214 --> 00:45:35,591
Or you're all charged with contempt!

520
00:45:46,518 --> 00:45:49,312
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?

521
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:51,106
We have, Your Honor.

522
00:45:51,189 --> 00:45:52,815
Defendant, please rise.

523
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:57,403
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn,
not guilty.

524
00:46:17,713 --> 00:46:19,090
This is mine.

525
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,891
Sheriff Vaughn!

526
00:47:09,803 --> 00:47:12,305
You won the election. Congratulations.

527
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:15,391
But we do have a tradition
of professional courtesy up here.

528
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,602
And I can personally vouch
for each and every one of these men.

529
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:20,312
They're good deputies.

530
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:22,106
You're all fired.

531
00:48:40,803 --> 00:48:43,680
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.

532
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:48,018
You're joking, right?

533
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,395
License and registration.

534
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:03,490
What's the problem, Sheriff?

535
00:49:04,116 --> 00:49:07,411
You. And the drugs you're peddling
out of your casino.

536
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:11,498
The only thing that's going on in my casino
is construction. You took care of that.

537
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:14,709
That's right. And I plan on taking care
of everything else, too.

538
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:17,420
If you can, try to think this through:

539
00:49:17,712 --> 00:49:20,214
A casino is a license to print money.

540
00:49:20,506 --> 00:49:22,508
Why would I jeopardize that
by selling drugs?

541
00:49:22,716 --> 00:49:25,385
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.

542
00:49:25,594 --> 00:49:28,305
Really? The only thing I think has changed
around here...

543
00:49:28,388 --> 00:49:31,891
is that you get to wake up every morning
and put on that nifty little badge.

544
00:49:32,183 --> 00:49:36,020
But underneath it is the same guy who
couldn't make it playing college football...

545
00:49:36,187 --> 00:49:38,314
and apparently couldn't make it
in the Army...

546
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:40,691
and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.

547
00:49:40,816 --> 00:49:42,609
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

548
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:46,988
And if you push too hard, you're going
to be a man who never gets to see 40.

549
00:49:50,492 --> 00:49:52,118
License, please.

550
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:00,918
Thanks, Sheriff.

551
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:06,590
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.

552
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:09,009
What's wrong with my taillights?

553
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,097
They're broken.

554
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,917
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.

555
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:52,715
No.

556
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:58,304
Come on, man. You know I hate cops.

557
00:50:58,512 --> 00:51:02,307
You've been sheriff for about two minutes,
and I'm already starting to hate you.

558
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:05,018
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.

559
00:51:05,102 --> 00:51:08,813
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors
for friends. That's how it starts.

560
00:51:09,105 --> 00:51:12,192
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes,
setting up roadblocks...

561
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,986
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?

562
00:51:19,115 --> 00:51:22,284
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.

563
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:24,912
I need you to take me to drug school.

564
00:51:31,418 --> 00:51:33,294
I get to wear a uniform?

565
00:51:34,212 --> 00:51:36,714
The stuff in this town
is five-star, factory pure.

566
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:39,300
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.

567
00:51:39,508 --> 00:51:42,511
We know Hamilton's boys
are selling that shit down at the casino.

568
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,680
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.

569
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:47,808
So we got to play follow-the-money,
starting with the tweakers.

570
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:49,601
That'll give us the suppliers.

571
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:53,396
These guys are real edgy,
so delicacy is the key.

572
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,107
Then we put the squeeze on them...

573
00:51:56,315 --> 00:51:58,317
till they spit out the location
of the next buy.

574
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:00,903
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.

575
00:52:01,904 --> 00:52:03,489
That's a good show.

576
00:52:04,406 --> 00:52:06,199
Phase three: we strike.

577
00:52:06,408 --> 00:52:10,620
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right. Delicacy and precision.

578
00:52:10,912 --> 00:52:13,498
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.

579
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:32,182
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.

580
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:34,600
- Officer.
- Yeah.

581
00:52:38,187 --> 00:52:39,480
Search him.

582
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:46,403
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs. Arms down.

583
00:52:48,905 --> 00:52:50,615
You been working out?

584
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,993
Nothing there.

585
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:57,288
Somebody needs a bath.

586
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:10,383
Now you read me my rights,
then you take me in...

587
00:53:11,885 --> 00:53:13,595
and I call my lawyer.

588
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,390
Okay. But I have a hunch
there may be something else in here.

589
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:20,392
Could be.

590
00:53:27,107 --> 00:53:29,484
Go to it, Deputy. Have a good time.

591
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,398
- He ain't talking.
- I know.

592
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,000
Handles pretty good.

593
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:45,512
He's clean.

594
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:52,101
Guess we got to go with Plan B.

595
00:54:53,186 --> 00:54:55,104
Screw you both.

596
00:54:55,897 --> 00:54:58,107
I do have a bit of information for you.

597
00:54:58,315 --> 00:55:01,819
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.

598
00:55:01,986 --> 00:55:03,320
Spit it out.

599
00:55:04,905 --> 00:55:06,698
You're gonna get hurt.

600
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:13,288
What an idiot.

601
00:55:24,381 --> 00:55:27,092
Why does it always have to be your fight?

602
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,514
- You might need this.
- No.

603
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:37,518
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on. You're just being stubborn.

604
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:40,020
You and me both, boy.

605
00:55:42,815 --> 00:55:43,899
Chris, listen.

606
00:55:45,817 --> 00:55:47,611
You be careful.

607
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,196
I will.

608
00:56:00,497 --> 00:56:02,791
Please step away from the vehicle!

609
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:05,794
Mr. Booth, are you still upset
over that body-cavity search?

610
00:56:06,003 --> 00:56:07,879
I forgot, you got no vehicle.

611
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:14,594
Please disperse! There is nothing to...

612
00:56:17,596 --> 00:56:18,889
Can I talk to you?

613
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:20,391
- Sure.
- Over here?

614
00:56:25,187 --> 00:56:29,107
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.

615
00:56:29,399 --> 00:56:31,901
Think they're gonna take it that far?

616
00:56:40,618 --> 00:56:43,912
- I'm with you, man. I'll check in later.
- Okay.

617
00:56:57,216 --> 00:57:00,511
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.

618
00:57:08,685 --> 00:57:10,520
You making house calls?

619
00:57:15,108 --> 00:57:16,984
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.

620
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,116
How's the food around here?

621
00:57:24,783 --> 00:57:25,784
Nice.

622
00:57:27,994 --> 00:57:30,080
I brought you special treats:

623
00:57:31,706 --> 00:57:34,500
Salad, fried chicken...

624
00:57:36,919 --> 00:57:38,587
potato salad.

625
00:57:39,797 --> 00:57:41,799
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.

626
00:57:52,684 --> 00:57:55,603
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.

627
00:57:58,105 --> 00:58:00,983
I figured you were making some changes
around here...

628
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:02,818
I could make a few myself.

629
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:09,115
Salt and pepper?

630
00:59:27,687 --> 00:59:29,314
- Who is that?
- Pete.

631
00:59:29,689 --> 00:59:32,192
- Want something to eat?
- No. I'm good, man.

632
00:59:44,995 --> 00:59:46,913
I got to get a bigger bed.

633
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:52,710
No, you don't.

634
01:00:21,904 --> 01:00:22,905
Do it.

635
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,283
I'm hungry.

636
01:00:27,617 --> 01:00:29,286
We've got leftovers.

637
01:00:30,912 --> 01:00:35,291
I want pancakes. And eggs. And bacon.

638
01:00:50,305 --> 01:00:52,015
I told you, Vaughn.

639
01:00:57,895 --> 01:00:59,188
Stay here.

640
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:07,487
Who needs to step away
from the vehicle now, Vaughn?

641
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:12,909
Truck for a truck, baby!

642
01:01:13,493 --> 01:01:16,913
That's right! Truck for a truck!

643
01:01:32,385 --> 01:01:33,594
Get down!

644
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:36,681
Tear it up, boys!

645
01:01:47,107 --> 01:01:49,109
Pete, something's burning.

646
01:01:58,784 --> 01:02:00,119
Take this.

647
01:02:01,495 --> 01:02:02,788
Get in there.

648
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:21,013
Good morning, honey.

649
01:02:23,515 --> 01:02:24,892
Get out of here.

650
01:02:27,394 --> 01:02:29,187
Sheriff, are you home?

651
01:02:31,189 --> 01:02:33,900
I told you someone was going to get hurt!

652
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:10,892
Come here.

653
01:03:12,018 --> 01:03:14,312
When I say now, start shooting!

654
01:03:14,896 --> 01:03:16,189
Over there!

655
01:03:18,816 --> 01:03:19,984
Stay low.

656
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:23,612
Vaughn! You got to get me out of here.

657
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,117
Move it. Go! Move it, old man.

658
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:31,494
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.

659
01:03:31,995 --> 01:03:33,204
Sit down.

660
01:03:35,081 --> 01:03:37,583
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?

661
01:03:43,213 --> 01:03:46,591
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch. Check it out.

662
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,882
Come on! Get me out of here, man!

663
01:04:21,716 --> 01:04:24,594
- What's it worth to you? Where's the lab?
- Screw you!

664
01:04:30,307 --> 01:04:34,186
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!

665
01:04:40,692 --> 01:04:41,818
Drop it.

666
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,113
Stay down!

667
01:04:49,783 --> 01:04:51,201
Stay down.

668
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,417
You okay?

669
01:05:07,383 --> 01:05:08,384
Shit.

670
01:05:19,102 --> 01:05:22,688
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.

671
01:05:39,996 --> 01:05:41,414
I'm going in!

672
01:05:46,794 --> 01:05:48,420
Right there, punk!

673
01:05:49,797 --> 01:05:52,299
Come on, Chris! Come on!

674
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,185
Deni, now!

675
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,505
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

676
01:07:22,715 --> 01:07:24,008
I'm sorry.

677
01:07:25,593 --> 01:07:28,095
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.

678
01:07:33,392 --> 01:07:35,810
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.

679
01:08:06,797 --> 01:08:08,382
You gonna be okay?

680
01:09:42,593 --> 01:09:43,886
Hey, Chris.

681
01:09:44,887 --> 01:09:46,389
Get up, Jay.

682
01:09:46,514 --> 01:09:48,182
Just a second.

683
01:09:48,807 --> 01:09:52,019
Remember when we used to play
hide-and-seek up here?

684
01:09:56,815 --> 01:09:59,192
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!

685
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:03,613
Look, Chris...

686
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:13,914
You want to know
what my new favorite sound's gonna be?

687
01:10:14,206 --> 01:10:17,083
The sound of you screaming
like a little bitch.

688
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:22,088
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no! You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!

689
01:10:22,588 --> 01:10:24,882
You forgot this: this is my town!

690
01:11:18,306 --> 01:11:19,307
Yes!

691
01:12:38,088 --> 01:12:39,589
You're nothing.

692
01:12:56,187 --> 01:12:59,399
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.

693
01:13:00,108 --> 01:13:01,609
This is my town.

694
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:05,780
You're under arrest.

695
01:13:12,286 --> 01:13:13,912
That ought to do it.

696
01:13:16,998 --> 01:13:18,583
What are you doing?

697
01:13:18,917 --> 01:13:21,919
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.

698
01:13:22,587 --> 01:13:24,297
That's how it starts.

699
01:13:24,505 --> 01:13:28,384
Next you'll be accepting bribes
and setting speed traps all over town.

700
01:13:28,717 --> 01:13:31,220
Cutting up trucks. You know how you are.

701
01:13:31,595 --> 01:13:33,889
Not to mention the cavity searches.

702
01:13:36,182 --> 01:13:37,517
You're gonna like that.

703
01:13:37,684 --> 01:13:40,603
Speaking of which,
do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?

704
01:13:40,812 --> 01:13:43,981
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?

705
01:13:44,607 --> 01:13:47,693
He's probably blowing on
somebody's dice right now.

706
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:51,613
That's lunch.

707
01:13:51,697 --> 01:13:53,907
Let's go pick up my old man,
grab something to eat.

708
01:13:54,116 --> 01:13:55,784
I'm with you, buddy.
