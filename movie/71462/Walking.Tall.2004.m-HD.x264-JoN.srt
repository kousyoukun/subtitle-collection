1
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,574
(MIDNIGHT RIDER PLAYING)

2
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,232
MAN: Here you go.
WOMAN: Thanks, man.

3
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,650
See you tomorrow.

4
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,779
How you doing?

5
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,365
Okay.

6
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,536
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.

7
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,206
If you're looking for work,
you may want to try Aberdeen.

8
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,458
That's about the closest mill work
you'll find.

9
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,585
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.

10
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,546
You know, we have a really nice casino,
the Wild Cherry.

11
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,299
Want to make some money,
maybe you ought to go on down

12
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,218
and try your luck at the blackjack tables.

13
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,303
No, I don't think so. Thanks.

14
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,180
You're Chris Vaughn?

15
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,268
Well, hell. I know all about you, Chris.

16
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,188
I know your folks. I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.

17
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,649
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!

18
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,485
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.

19
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,528
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.

20
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,489
Well, hell, Chris.

21
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,117
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

22
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,619
- I insist.
- I'll walk.

23
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,954
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.

24
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,123
I won't take no for an answer.
Get in the car.

25
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,629
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.

26
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,215
I scared him.

27
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,723
WATKINS: You were gone a while, huh?

28
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,851
Eight years. Harstad was sheriff back then.

29
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,187
Aaron Harstad, yeah.

30
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,023
Sad story.

31
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,820
About five months back,
he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.

32
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,532
Car folded up like an accordion.

33
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,120
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.

34
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,059
All right.

35
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,358
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.

36
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,448
It's election month. I'm your man.

37
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,328
Okay. Say hey to your old man.

38
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,288
Let's go.

39
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,648
Can I help you?

40
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,279
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.

41
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,998
- You look great.
- What is this?

42
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,460
I couldn't let you be
the only one looking good in uniform.

43
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,629
Hey, Ma. Chris is here.

44
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,215
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.

45
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,342
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.

46
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,595
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?

47
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,810
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?

48
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,561
For good. I'm home.

49
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,980
- Really? You're not kidding?
- No.

50
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,196
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.

51
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,242
MRS. VAUGHN: I wish you had told us
exactly when you were coming.

52
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,785
I'd have cooked.

53
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,328
- This is fine, Mom.
- MICHELLE: We love Chinese.

54
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,789
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?

55
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,292
I was planning to work at the mill,
but you never mentioned it closed.

56
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,045
We didn't want to bother you
when your father got laid off.

57
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,297
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.

58
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,467
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in,

59
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,386
we try to keep things simple.

60
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,554
MICHELLE: Pete.

61
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,057
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.

62
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,642
Sit down. Say hello.

63
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,727
Last time he saw you,
you were barely walking.

64
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,522
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.

65
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,023
It was Chris' room first.

66
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,860
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.

67
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,362
Doesn't look like it's going to rain
to me, Colonel.

68
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,697
Sit down. Eat something.

69
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,241
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.

70
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,534
A grunt.

71
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,912
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- ALL: Pete!

72
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,792
Poppa's still got your gun locked up
in the garage.

73
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,463
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.

74
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,883
No. I'm still hoping
you'll melt that thing down on your own.

75
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,427
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.

76
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,263
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.

77
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,764
- 10:30.
- 10:00.

78
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,516
Remind you of anyone?

79
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,859
Okay, it rained. Happy?

80
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,820
No.

81
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,535
Why don't you crash on the floor?

82
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,248
Okay. I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.

83
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,459
Huh-uh.

84
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,212
CHRIS: Pete.

85
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,675
Keep you dry.

86
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,388
Did you really kill people?

87
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,425
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.

88
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,845
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.

89
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,847
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

90
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,558
What is that?

91
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,686
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?

92
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,525
- How you been?
- Good.

93
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,527
- Clean living?
- Please. You want a beer?

94
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,822
No. Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.

95
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,282
Okay. Here.

96
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,825
Thanks, man.

97
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,246
Like that? When you left town,

98
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,207
it gave me the idea I should do something
with my life, too.

99
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,462
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar,
and became all about music.

100
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,757
And then, pretty soon,
I was about music and drugs,

101
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,718
and pretty soon
I was basically just about drugs

102
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,679
and ended up doing two years for B and E.

103
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,099
I'm sorry.

104
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:48,021
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.

105
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:52,233
Doing construction and renewing
those supportive and healthy friendships

106
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,360
from my past.

107
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,738
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards,
told them you were back,

108
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,699
and they asked me
to politely remind you that it is Saturday.

109
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,285
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.

110
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,251
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.

111
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,336
We're still doing it.

112
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,214
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely. Let's go, superstar!

113
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,509
- Just like the old days. Go deep.
- Come on.

114
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,137
When did that happen?

115
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,347
RAY: Jay Hamilton Field.

116
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,433
His parents hadn't left him the mill
for more than two minutes

117
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,394
- before he shut it down.
- CHRIS: Why?

118
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,729
JAY: Heads up!

119
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,731
Because I opened my casino.

120
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,401
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?

121
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,277
Still got your reflexes.

122
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,155
What? Did you get tired
of being all that you could be?

123
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,282
- No. I'm still all I can be.
- Really?

124
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,785
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.

125
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,455
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax. Catch my breath.

126
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,915
- You? Relax?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,629
Not today.

128
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,800
I got it.

129
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,094
Let's go. Come on!

130
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,479
Is that how it's going to be?

131
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,981
That's how it is.

132
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,984
- CHRIS: Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch. Too rough?

133
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,318
Sorry, ladies.

134
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,573
Pick up the outside!

135
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,828
- Fumble!
- Set!

136
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,874
How's that for touch?

137
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,003
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?

138
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,421
- That the best you got?
- What?

139
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,506
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?

140
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,592
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.

141
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,936
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going. We're not going to go.

142
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,236
You almost caught it.

143
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,702
- JAY: We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.

144
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,580
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.

145
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:14,042
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross. You stay in and block.

146
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,044
Booth? Isolate on Vaughn.

147
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,046
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.

148
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,423
- Go low. Left knee.
- All right, man.

149
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,426
You got it? On the first hut. Ready? Break!

150
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,179
Be strong.

151
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,309
All right, Chris Vaughn. Last chance.

152
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,563
- Black-nineteen! Black!
- Watch the outside!

153
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,111
I'm open!

154
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,578
That's game.

155
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,748
Sorry about that.

156
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,335
Cool, man.

157
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,843
MAN 1: Nice game, ladies.

158
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,136
MAN 2: What the hell was that?

159
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,188
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?

160
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,235
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.

161
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,779
Good to be back.

162
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,948
See you around.

163
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,160
If you're not doing anything later on,
want to come by the casino?

164
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,456
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me. What do you say?

165
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,670
- See you tonight.
- Cool.

166
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,630
I'll see you later on.

167
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,218
Be good.

168
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,810
Hey, Sarge. Good game. Maybe next time.

169
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,646
Hold up.

170
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,652
Maybe next time I won't see you
in the bleachers, smoking weed.

171
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,705
Welcome home, buddy.

172
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,418
CHRIS: I thought you had to be
Native American to own a casino.

173
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,295
RAY: Hamilton's
one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.

174
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,755
KEITH: Put it on his application.

175
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,342
RAY: And what he slid under the table
convinced the powers that be it was true.

176
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:31,054
MAN 2: It's ours for the taking tonight.
JIMMY: Let's pick some cherries, boys.

177
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,640
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.

178
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,601
Just so you guys know,
I'm done after I triple my money.

179
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,645
That's what you said last time.

180
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,688
You wound up selling your body
for bus fare.

181
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,023
He had to walk.

182
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,859
Nobody's going to have any problems
finding this place.

183
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,613
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics
that I find most impressive.

184
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,115
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.

185
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,994
- Hi there.
- Hi. How you doing?

186
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,126
- See? Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.

187
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,129
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips. Let's gamble.

188
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,465
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?

189
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,096
RAY: Isn't it wonderful? All your
gambling needs under one great, big roof.

190
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:17,558
You got your ATM machines,
tellers to cash your paycheck,

191
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,395
and when you're here,
you don't got to worry about things,

192
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,857
like child support, rent,
laws of mathematical probability.

193
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,742
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like
to invite you to the VIP lounge.

194
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,130
- The dream team. You all healed up?
- Nice place.

195
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,340
Welcome to my world.

196
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,594
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.

197
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,431
If you need
a little female companionship, done.

198
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,057
All right?

199
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,977
- Get inside. Have a good time.
- Where you going?

200
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,272
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do. Enjoy.

201
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,819
Just remember,
nothing in here is free. Ma'am.

202
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,239
WAITRESS: Cherry shot?
CHRIS: Ray, be nice.

203
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,742
RAY: Come on, this place is nothing
but fake boobs

204
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,244
and real assholes, if you ask me.

205
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,412
Just water for me.

206
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,206
JIMMY: Drink up. We got money to win
and girls just waiting.

207
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,167
MAN 1: We are VIPs.
RAY: Here's to you, Chris.

208
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,835
KEITH: Welcome home.
ALL: Cheers.

209
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,629
Let's play, boys.

210
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,174
Go right ahead.

211
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,259
Already lost $1...

212
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,635
Good night.

213
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,513
Okay. Don't say we never did nothing
for you.

214
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,476
Don't worry, buddy,
everybody's scared their first time.

215
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,478
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.

216
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,815
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.

217
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,527
- This'll get you started.
- Lf you're not back by morning

218
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,987
we'll send a search party.

219
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,864
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.

220
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,688
You from here, or are you just visiting?

221
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,860
A little of both.

222
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,071
I grew up here.

223
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,200
So you're seeing all the old faces.

224
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,953
You could say that.

225
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,298
Your voice sounds very familiar.

226
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,306
Chris.

227
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,516
Deni.

228
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,915
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?

229
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:13,211
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?

230
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,546
- CANDl: Hello.
- Hey, Candi.

231
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,174
Let's go.

232
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,968
Six, easy six. Looking for a six to win.

233
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,095
We can do a six. Can we do a six?

234
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,097
I think I can do a six, right?

235
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,351
We got liftoff! Whack it, boys. Whack it.

236
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,562
Blue or pink, what do you think?

237
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,983
Who's up for two out of three?

238
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,986
I'm getting killed. Let me have a C-note
to put $200 on a bet.

239
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,029
- No.
- Come on.

240
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,447
Hell, no.

241
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,740
Look at them.

242
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,493
He's hot.

243
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,538
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.

244
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,582
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.

245
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,377
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.

246
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,213
There's another $100. Boom.
Give me some dice.

247
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,340
Looking for a six.

248
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,218
All right. Oh, please. Please.

249
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,345
Thank you. And you.

250
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,182
- Jimmy, don't roll. Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.

251
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,518
Hard six, six. Looking for a six.

252
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,981
Seven out. Line in, the dark side wins.

253
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,774
Last come'll get you some.

254
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:24,198
- You're good. But I saw it.
- Saw what?

255
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,450
I saw the switch.

256
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,452
This is a clean game, asshole.

257
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,870
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

258
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,872
Let's see about that.

259
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,294
Bet you I'll roll a seven.

260
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,589
It's not your roll, sir.

261
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,011
Sir, it's not your roll.

262
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,721
Will you call security?

263
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,889
Put your bets down on the passline.

264
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,851
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?

265
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,894
No. We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.

266
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,855
The dice are coming up seven.

267
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,900
- It's not your roll, sir.
- MAN: Come on, baby.

268
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,281
- What a surprise.
- No, folks. No payouts.

269
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,866
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.

270
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,076
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.

271
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,953
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.

272
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,038
You're not the shooter.

273
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,248
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.

274
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,878
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.

275
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,589
Does your boss know about this?

276
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,425
Just give me my money.

277
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,477
Come on. Let's go.

278
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,455
What now, bitch? Come on!

279
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,000
Special Forces.

280
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,504
Wow. I'll take that.

281
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,683
What are you doing?

282
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,690
Special Forces. Special treatment.

283
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,987
This guy knows Hamilton.

284
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,830
You just hold him down. Come on, Burke.

285
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,955
Folks.

286
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,418
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.

287
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,421
Whoever did this left him for dead.

288
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,548
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.

289
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,968
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...

290
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,096
I'll also need a copy of your write-up,
with toxicology

291
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,599
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?

292
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,309
I'm just trying to get some facts.

293
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:24,563
You need to be arresting whoever tried
to kill my brother, not testing his blood.

294
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,192
I'm just doing my job, Michelle. Okay?
I understand how you feel.

295
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,277
But we still don't know
who started all this.

296
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,614
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.

297
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,492
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn. I really will.

298
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,286
In the meantime I have to file a full report.

299
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,332
Will you let me know
when I can talk to him? Thank you.

300
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,381
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.

301
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,198
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you. They're for my best friend.

302
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:21,328
Hey, Sarge. So much for our VIP status.

303
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,129
Don't they teach you
any basic fighting skills in the Army?

304
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,297
How did you do?

305
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,384
Not good. But I tell you,
that guy was feeling me this morning.

306
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,267
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.

307
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,771
Chris, I don't know if you noticed,
but this ain't exactly home anymore.

308
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,790
Hang on.

309
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,712
Let me help you. Come on.

310
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,435
I'm good, Mom. I got it.

311
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,399
- Need some help?
- No. I'm just milking it.

312
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,197
There's some old crutches in the garage.

313
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,162
CONNIE: Thanks, Pete.
CHRIS: Crutches. That's nice.

314
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,301
Did you see the hole?

315
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,605
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.

316
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,107
CHRIS: Ray.

317
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,528
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.

318
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,654
You make this?

319
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,863
Need anything?

320
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,783
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man. It's good.

321
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,119
No, I'm good, Dad. Thanks.

322
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,021
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.

323
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,733
I might've had serious issues
with your career choice,

324
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,361
but it just didn't seem fair
to take it out on an innocent truck.

325
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,822
Where you headed?

326
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,450
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?

327
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,576
Let's go.

328
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,298
Your whole life,
all you wanted to do was get out of here.

329
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,508
What made you come back now?

330
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,845
You're going to think I'm crazy.

331
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,264
I would think about the mill.

332
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:32,227
When I was a kid going to visit you
at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...

333
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,814
You remember that smell.

334
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,360
I remember a lot of nice things
before the mill closed.

335
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,201
CHRIS: When did they go out of business?

336
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,244
MR. VAUGHN: Closed about
six months ago.

337
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,748
There's a Home Depot
about 15 minutes up the road.

338
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,334
And that?

339
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,421
Don't ask.

340
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,400
First of all, I just want to say thanks.

341
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,488
- For what?
- For making that stickman.

342
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,325
He's been fired
and his gaming permit's been pulled.

343
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:33,497
I just have no idea
why my security cameras didn't catch that.

344
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,753
They miss a lot in your place,
don't they, Jay?

345
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,007
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.

346
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,176
Wait a second.

347
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,056
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy. Understandably.

348
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,810
You don't know what kind of assholes
they have to put up with on a daily basis.

349
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,895
Look, they've been reprimanded.

350
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,981
But they say you went nuts, man.

351
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,108
I'm sorry. Insensitive.

352
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,194
I know the proper term that vets use
is post-traumatic stress...

353
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,281
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever. You tore my place apart,

354
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,492
and it wasn't easy to get my guys
to agree not to press charges.

355
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,871
Chris, if you had a problem,
shouldn't you have come to me?

356
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,584
I want to bring you inside.

357
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,336
I want to make you head of security.

358
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,132
- What do you say?
- No.

359
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,852
I guess you probably need time
to think about it. I figured as much.

360
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,273
This is for you.

361
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:45,068
It's a little something to help you get,
you know...

362
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,989
Come on, man, don't be like that.

363
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,410
I came all the way out here to your house,
just to see you get back on your feet.

364
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,038
I'm going to the sheriff.

365
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,083
I'm really sorry you feel that way.

366
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,005
I'll see you around, Chris.

367
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,854
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?

368
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,819
Excuse me.

369
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,614
I got to call you back.

370
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,825
Hey, Chris.

371
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,162
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.

372
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,956
I'm here to press charges.

373
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,668
This isn't about that incident
at the casino a while back?

374
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,877
Yeah. It is.

375
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,213
Because that matter's closed.

376
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,550
You're lucky you weren't brought in
on charges. I mean...

377
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,344
Did you even look into it?

378
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,723
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.

379
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,558
An internal investigation?

380
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,313
I know you're familiar
with the term no-fly zone.

381
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,899
Because that's what the casino is.

382
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,360
Since the mill closed down,

383
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,072
that casino is the main source
of revenue in this town.

384
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,283
So case closed, basically.

385
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,245
We'll see you.

386
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,000
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?

387
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,595
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.

388
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:41,393
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.

389
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,479
This is my town. Okay?

390
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,523
I'm the sheriff here.

391
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,735
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.

392
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,489
Now please get out of my building.

393
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,550
Hi.

394
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,885
Hey.

395
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,972
- Come in.
- Thanks.

396
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,141
This belongs to you.

397
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,812
I appreciate that.
I thought this was history.

398
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,607
- Could have left it in the trash, but I...
- Deni?

399
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,485
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.

400
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,407
Can I talk to you outside for a second?

401
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,743
Quick walk. Mom, I'll be right back.

402
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,417
- How you been?
- Been better.

403
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,378
Talk to the sheriff yet?

404
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,924
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.

405
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,843
He sure as hell didn't seem
like much of a sheriff.

406
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,513
He's up for reelection, you know.

407
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:03,350
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.

408
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,145
How about you?

409
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,149
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.

410
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,484
Been reading these books.

411
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,487
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.

412
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,573
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?

413
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,534
I have my moments.

414
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,371
So, the casino, huh?

415
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,166
Yeah. Been there almost a year.

416
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:32,087
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.

417
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,007
I like that.

418
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,511
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself,
hasn't he?

419
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,596
He's a real go-getter, that one.

420
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,558
He must be. I heard he got you.

421
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,730
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.

422
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,861
You still work for him, though.

423
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,446
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.

424
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,907
I suppose so.

425
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,412
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?

426
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,595
Thanks for the jacket.

427
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,266
And where is he?

428
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,158
It's okay, Mom. He's stabilized.

429
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,453
It was close.

430
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,121
Crystal meth.

431
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,665
I'm sorry. I never did it before.

432
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,044
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.

433
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,718
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...

434
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,844
Stop.

435
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,640
Where?

436
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,267
From the security guys
working at the casino.

437
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,314
Chris, wait. Call the police.

438
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,524
No. It won't do any good.

439
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,454
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.

440
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,625
What are you doing?

441
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,254
No, Chris. Not like this.

442
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,632
Listen to me.

443
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,010
If you go out of here with that gun,
they're going to nail...

444
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,346
I've been looking for you.

445
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,999
Guess that changes our relationship
a bit, huh?

446
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,335
You should not have come
looking for trouble.

447
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,505
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.

448
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,631
Now!

449
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:14,345
- POLICEMAN: Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.

450
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,222
Put your hands on the hood.

451
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:24,772
CROWE: I advise you to give this offer
more than a little serious thought.

452
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,567
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.

453
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,360
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.

454
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,447
Normally they wouldn't even
put it on the table,

455
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,908
but your military record can't be ignored.

456
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,203
Three months home arrest,
some community service,

457
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,415
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.

458
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,626
Look at it from the other side.

459
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,379
There's over a dozen witnesses, none
of whom will paint a flattering picture.

460
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,090
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.

461
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,426
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.

462
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,137
They're only offering me this deal
just to keep me quiet.

463
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,223
I still say you should take it.

464
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,601
I wasn't wrong. And I won't say I was.

465
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,438
BOOTH: Our job is to keep order.

466
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,441
There was no chance
of that once he came in.

467
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,111
Me and my men,
we were just trying to control him.

468
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:18,117
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.

469
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:23,873
So violent, so dangerous,
so highly trained,

470
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:28,503
that he dispatched six
of the casino security staff single-handedly.

471
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,214
Six men, single-handedly.

472
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,802
His weapon of choice,
a simple piece of cedar,

473
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:40,807
which, in his hands,
became a devastating force with one aim.

474
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,810
To hurt people and destroy property.

475
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:51,818
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.

476
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,528
You said he broke your arm.

477
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,697
BURKE: Yeah, that's correct.
My right forearm.

478
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,243
Both bones with a single shot. It was crazy.

479
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,496
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.

480
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,666
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.

481
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,877
PROSECUTOR: Did he give you
any kind of advance warning,

482
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,131
a chance to defend yourself?

483
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,676
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.

484
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,221
Besides, he seemed to be too busy
enjoying himself from what I could see.

485
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,182
So from what you saw,
he seemed to have some kind of purpose?

486
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,434
He had a point to prove.

487
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,604
I was emptying machines
when he came in and started swinging.

488
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,981
- I was trying to get out of there.
- MAN 1: He was a menace.

489
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,025
MAN 2: A very dangerous person.
MAN 3: Military-trained.

490
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,693
WOMAN 1: He seemed like
a complete psychopath.

491
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,029
MAN 4: Nothing close to this.
MAN 5: I didn't know what he'd do.

492
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,614
WOMAN 2: I was frightened.
MAN 6: He came for us.

493
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,282
PROSECUTOR: No doubt in your mind?
MAN 7: No doubt.

494
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,700
I have no further questions.

495
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:44,787
JUDGE: Mr. Crowe, you may present
your client's case.

496
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,415
You're fired.

497
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:56,132
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.

498
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,344
Order!

499
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,769
If you choose to represent yourself,
and not be represented by legal counsel,

500
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:11,731
you realize that you can't
then claim a mistrial on that basis?

501
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,318
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.

502
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,953
I don't deny anything
that was said here today.

503
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,373
Does that mean
you're changing your plea to guilty?

504
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,083
I'm not guilty of anything,

505
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,418
except standing up for myself
when the law wouldn't.

506
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,421
Objection. He's trying
to introduce prior events.

507
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,716
Sustained. Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.

508
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,888
I grew up in this town.

509
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,891
People used to walk tall in this town.

510
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,602
They wouldn't have traded the mill
for a crooked casino.

511
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,771
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...

512
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,565
And they wouldn't have stood around
while drugs were sold to kids.

513
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,942
- Objection!
- Sustained.

514
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:59,278
Mr. Vaughn, you're close
to being held in contempt.

515
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,406
I was justified in what I did.

516
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,909
And if you acquit me of these charges,
then I'm gonna run for sheriff.

517
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,453
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.

518
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,288
JUDGE: Order.

519
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,500
Please take your seat.

520
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,628
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged
with contempt.

521
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,797
And I will make sure that this...

522
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,006
- Objection.
- Sustained.

523
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,343
...never happens to anyone again
without punishing those who did it.

524
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,929
I'm ordering the jury to ignore
what they've just seen.

525
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,265
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.

526
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,311
Order.

527
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,857
Or you're all charged with contempt!

528
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,162
JUDGE: Mr. Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

529
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,247
We have, Your Honor.

530
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,957
Defendant, please rise.

531
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,628
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn,
not guilty.

532
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,233
This is mine.

533
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,952
ALL: Sheriff Vaughn!

534
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,866
- Sheriff.
- Watkins.

535
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,578
You won the election. Congratulations.

536
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,623
But we do have a tradition
of professional courtesy up here.

537
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,876
And I can personally vouch
for each and every one of these men.

538
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,545
They're good deputies.

539
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,255
You're all fired.

540
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,170
- JAY: Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.

541
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,424
You're joking, right?

542
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,760
License and registration.

543
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,856
What's the problem, Sheriff?

544
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,860
You. And the drugs you're peddling
out of your casino.

545
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,031
The only thing that's going on in my casino
is construction. You took care of that.

546
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,076
That's right. And I plan on taking care
of everything else, too.

547
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,787
If you can, try to think this through.

548
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,539
A casino is a license to print money.

549
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,833
Why would I jeopardize that
by selling drugs?

550
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,753
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.

551
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,631
Really? The only thing I think has changed
around here

552
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:32,301
is that you get to wake up every morning
and put on that nifty little badge.

553
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:36,389
But underneath it is the same guy who
couldn't make it playing college football,

554
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,683
and apparently couldn't make it
in the Army,

555
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,018
and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.

556
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,895
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

557
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:47,441
And if you push too hard, you're going
to be a man who never gets to see 40.

558
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,363
License, please.

559
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,163
Thanks, Sheriff.

560
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,919
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.

561
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,338
What's wrong with my taillights?

562
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,343
They're broken.

563
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,042
- RAY: Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.

564
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,382
No.

565
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,471
Come on, man. You know I hate cops.

566
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:02,516
You've been sheriff for about two minutes,
and I'm already starting to hate you.

567
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,144
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.

568
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:09,023
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors
for friends. That's how it starts.

569
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,359
Next thing you know you'll be
taking bribes, setting up roadblocks,

570
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,154
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?

571
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,495
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.

572
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,164
I need you to take me to drug school.

573
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,506
I get to wear a uniform?

574
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,009
RAY: The stuff in this town
is five-star, factory pure.

575
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,553
CHRIS: So let's go get the factory.
RAY: Easier said than done.

576
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,807
CHRIS: We know Hamilton's boys
are selling that shit down at the casino.

577
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,934
RAY: Yeah, but 99% of the time
they're clean.

578
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:48,104
So we got to play follow-the-money,
starting with the tweakers.

579
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,855
That'll give us the suppliers.

580
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,068
These guys are real edgy,
so delicacy is the key.

581
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,362
Then we put the squeeze on them

582
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,531
till they spit out the location
of the next buy.

583
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,117
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.

584
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,786
That's a good show.

585
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,497
Phase three, we strike.

586
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,749
CHRIS: I thought you said
delicacy was the key.

587
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,960
RAY: That's right. Delicacy and precision.

588
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,754
MAN: Hey, what's up?
CHRIS: Get out of here.

589
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,565
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.

590
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,775
- Officer.
- Yeah.

591
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,572
Search him.

592
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:46,745
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs. Arms down.

593
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,791
You been working out?

594
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,086
Nothing there.

595
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,381
Somebody needs a bath.

596
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,644
Now you read me my rights,
then you take me in,

597
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,731
and I call my lawyer.

598
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:17,610
Okay. But I have a hunch
there may be something else in here.

599
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,529
Could be.

600
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,371
Go to it, Deputy. Have a good time.

601
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,629
Oops.

602
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,456
- He ain't talking.
- I know.

603
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,059
Handles pretty good.

604
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,489
He's clean.

605
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,204
Guess we got to go with Plan B.

606
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,040
Screw you both.

607
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,085
I do have a bit of information for you.

608
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:01,880
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.

609
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,340
Spit it out.

610
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,760
You're gonna get hurt.

611
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,309
What an idiot.

612
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,239
Why does it always have to be your fight?

613
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,661
- You might need this.
- No.

614
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:37,708
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on. You're just being stubborn.

615
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,002
You and me both, boy.

616
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,922
Chris, listen.

617
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,634
You be careful.

618
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,262
I will.

619
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,858
Please step away from the vehicle!

620
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,986
Mr. Booth, are you still upset
over that body-cavity search?

621
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,946
I forgot, you got no vehicle.

622
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,828
Please disperse! There is nothing to...

623
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,916
Can I talk to you?

624
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,542
- Sure.
- Over here?

625
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:29,259
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.

626
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,929
Think they're gonna take it that far?

627
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:44,066
- I'm with you, man. I'll check in later.
- Okay.

628
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,624
COMMENTATOR ON TV: A drive
to right field. It's dropping for a single.

629
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,551
BOOTH: You making house calls?

630
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,057
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.

631
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,106
How's the food around here?

632
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:25,816
Nice.

633
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,195
I brought you special treats.

634
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,533
Salad, fried chicken,

635
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,537
potato salad.

636
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,832
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.

637
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,512
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.

638
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,018
I figured you were making some changes
around here,

639
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,853
I could make a few myself.

640
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,067
Salt and pepper?

641
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,314
- Who is that?
- Pete.

642
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,150
- Want something to eat?
- No. I'm good, man.

643
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,832
I got to get a bigger bed.

644
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,629
No, you don't.

645
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,701
Do it.

646
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,163
I'm hungry.

647
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,207
We've got leftovers.

648
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:35,255
I want pancakes. And eggs. And bacon.

649
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,813
I told you, Vaughn.

650
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,029
Stay here.

651
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:07,412
Who needs to step away
from the vehicle now, Vaughn?

652
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,751
BOOTH: Truck for a truck, baby!

653
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:16,880
That's right! Truck for a truck!

654
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,355
Get down!

655
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,566
Tear it up, boys!

656
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,912
Pete, something's burning.

657
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,798
Take this.

658
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,634
Get in there.

659
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:20,694
Good morning, honey.

660
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,614
Get out of here.

661
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,910
Sheriff, are you home?

662
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,665
I told you someone was going to get hurt!

663
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:10,702
Come here.

664
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,164
When I say now, start shooting!

665
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,999
Over there!

666
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,753
Stay low.

667
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,381
Vaughn! You got to get me out of here.

668
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,929
Move it. Go! Move it, old man.

669
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,264
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.

670
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,891
Sit down.

671
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,312
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?

672
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:46,404
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch. Check it out.

673
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,273
Come on! Get me out of here, man!

674
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:25,026
- What's it worth to you? Where's the lab?
- Screw you!

675
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:34,661
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!

676
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,127
Drop it.

677
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,381
Stay down!

678
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,469
Stay down.

679
01:04:58,603 --> 01:04:59,853
You okay?

680
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:08,904
Shit.

681
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:23,251
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.

682
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,770
I'm going in!

683
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,693
Right there, punk!

684
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,697
Come on, Chris! Come on!

685
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,542
Deni, now!

686
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,471
Deni.

687
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,869
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

688
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,289
I'm sorry.

689
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:28,460
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.

690
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,176
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.

691
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,750
You gonna be okay?

692
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,095
Hey, Chris.

693
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,598
Get up, Jay.

694
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,433
Just a second.

695
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:52,270
Remember when we used to play
hide-and-seek up here?

696
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,485
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!

697
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,823
Look, Chris...

698
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:14,209
You want to know
what my new favorite sound's gonna be?

699
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:17,462
The sound of you screaming
like a little bitch.

700
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:22,467
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no! You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!

701
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:25,136
You forgot this, this is my town!

702
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,357
Yes!

703
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,645
You're nothing.

704
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:59,457
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.

705
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,626
This is my town.

706
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,838
You're under arrest.

707
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,971
That ought to do it.

708
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,643
What are you doing?

709
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,938
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.

710
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,357
That's how it starts.

711
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:28,486
Next you'll be accepting bribes
and setting speed traps all over town.

712
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,239
Cutting up trucks. You know how you are.

713
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:33,950
Not to mention the cavity searches.

714
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,453
You're gonna like that.

715
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,581
RAY: Speaking of which,
do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?

716
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,958
CHRIS: Could be.

717
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,001
RAY: Running the Shower Tower
with the fellas?

718
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,672
He's probably blowing on
somebody's dice right now.

719
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,509
RAY: That's lunch.

720
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,928
CHRIS: Let's go pick up my old man,
grab something to eat.

721
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:55,763
I'm with you, buddy.
