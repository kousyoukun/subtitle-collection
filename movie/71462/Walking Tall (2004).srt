1
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,491
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

2
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:29,927
See you tomorrow.

3
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,003
How you doing?

4
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:18,500
Okay.

5
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:22,780
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.

6
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:25,443
If you're looking for work,
you may want to try Aberdeen.

7
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:27,679
That's about the closest mill work
you'll find.

8
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,812
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.

9
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:32,824
You know, we have a really nice casino,
the Wild Cherry.

10
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:35,555
Want to make some money,
maybe you ought to go on down...

11
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,494
and try your luck at the blackjack tables.

12
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:39,589
No, I don't think so. Thanks.

13
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:41,456
You're Chris Vaughn?

14
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:46,535
Well, hell. I know all about you, Chris.

15
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:49,464
I know your folks. I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.

16
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:51,909
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!

17
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:54,742
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.

18
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:56,816
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,549
Well, hell, Chris.

20
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:02,352
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

21
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:03,855
- I insist.
- I'll walk.

22
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,186
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.

23
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:08,352
I won't take no for an answer. Get in the car.

24
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,856
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.

25
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:16,463
I scared him.

26
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:24,974
You were gone a while, huh?

27
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:28,105
Eight years. Harstad was sheriff back then.

28
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,416
Aaron Harstad, yeah.

29
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:33,276
Sad story.

30
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:38,047
About five months back,
he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.

31
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,791
Car folded up like an accordion.

32
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,392
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.

33
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,279
All right.

34
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,588
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.

35
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,693
It's election month. I'm your man.

36
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,563
Okay. Say hey to your old man.

37
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:29,764
Let's go.

38
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:56,932
Can I help you?

39
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:02,507
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.

40
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,249
- You look great.
- What is this?

41
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,717
I couldn't let you be
the only one looking good in uniform.

42
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,883
Hey, Ma. Chris is here.

43
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,454
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.

44
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,587
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.

45
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:26,823
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?

46
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:33,032
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?

47
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:34,801
For good. I'm home.

48
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:37,240
- Really? You're not kidding?
- No.

49
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,440
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.

50
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,811
I wish you had told us exactly when
you were coming. I'd have cooked.

51
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:51,584
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.

52
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:54,058
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?

53
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:57,563
I was planning to work at the mill,
but you never mentioned it closed.

54
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,258
We didn't want to bother you
when your father got laid off.

55
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,494
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.

56
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,663
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in...

57
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,604
we try to keep things simple.

58
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:08,663
Pete.

59
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,269
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.

60
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:13,835
Sit down. Say hello.

61
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,938
Last time he saw you,
you were barely walking.

62
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:18,745
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.

63
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:19,978
It was Chris' room first.

64
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:23,055
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.

65
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:25,624
Doesn't look like it's going to rain
to me, Colonel.

66
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:26,954
Sit down. Eat something.

67
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:29,494
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.

68
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:30,790
A grunt.

69
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:34,155
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!

70
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,029
Poppa's still got your gun locked up
in the garage.

71
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,700
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.

72
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:46,143
No. I'm still hoping
you'll melt that thing down on your own.

73
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:48,671
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.

74
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:51,510
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.

75
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,049
- 10:30.
- 10:00.

76
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,743
Remind you of anyone?

77
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,101
Okay, it rained. Happy?

78
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,030
No.

79
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,738
Why don't you crash on the floor?

80
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:59,443
Okay. I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.

81
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:09,856
Keep you dry.

82
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,562
Did you really kill people?

83
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,636
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.

84
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:55,065
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.

85
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:57,075
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

86
00:09:58,745 --> 00:09:59,769
What is that?

87
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:02,906
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?

88
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:08,752
- How you been?
- Good.

89
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,755
- Clean living?
- Please. You want a beer?

90
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:14,054
No. Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.

91
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:15,526
Okay. Here.

92
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,055
Thanks, man.

93
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,497
Like that? When you left town...

94
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:24,434
it gave me the idea I should do something
with my life, too.

95
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:28,702
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar,
and became all about music.

96
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:32,006
And then, pretty soon,
I was about music and drugs...

97
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,945
and pretty soon
I was basically just about drugs...

98
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:37,949
and ended up doing two years for B and E.

99
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:41,111
I'm sorry.

100
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:46,288
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.

101
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:50,523
Doing construction and renewing
those supportive and healthy friendships...

102
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:51,620
from my past.

103
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:55,031
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards,
told them you were back...

104
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,968
and they asked me
to politely remind you that it is Saturday.

105
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:00,505
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.

106
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:08,437
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.

107
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:09,537
We're still doing it.

108
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,413
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely. Let's go, superstar!

109
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:15,749
- Just like the old days. Go deep.
- Come on.

110
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,357
When did that happen?

111
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,585
Jay Hamilton Field.

112
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,652
His parents hadn't left him the mill
for more than two minutes...

113
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,630
- before he shut it down.
- Why?

114
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,690
Heads up!

115
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,964
Because I opened my casino.

116
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,632
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?

117
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,534
Still got your reflexes.

118
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:37,401
What? Did you get tired
of being all that you could be?

119
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:39,536
- No. I'm still all I can be.
- Really?

120
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:42,012
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.

121
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:45,716
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax. Catch my breath.

122
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:47,184
- You? Relax?
- Yeah.

123
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:52,816
Not today.

124
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:57,085
I got it.

125
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:59,358
Let's go. Come on!

126
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:09,307
Is that how it's going to be?

127
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:11,175
That's how it is.

128
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:14,213
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch. Too rough?

129
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,508
Sorry, ladies.

130
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:19,784
Pick up the outside!

131
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:25,052
- Fumble!
- Set!

132
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:29,117
How's that for touch?

133
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:33,265
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?

134
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:34,663
- That the best you got?
- What?

135
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,725
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?

136
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:38,828
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.

137
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,174
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going. We're not going to go.

138
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:58,479
You almost caught it.

139
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,894
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.

140
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,798
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.

141
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:12,235
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross. You stay in and block.

142
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:14,273
Booth? Isolate on Vaughn.

143
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,240
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.

144
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:18,641
- Go low. Left knee.
- All right, man.

145
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:21,642
You got it? On the first hut. Ready? Break!

146
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,107
Be strong.

147
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,550
All right, Chris Vaughn. Last chance.

148
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:33,786
- Black-nineteen! Black!
- Watch the outside!

149
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:40,122
I'm open!

150
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,800
That's game.

151
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,008
Sorry about that.

152
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:55,505
Cool, man.

153
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,053
Nice game, ladies.

154
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,483
What the hell was that?

155
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:15,524
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?

156
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,437
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.

157
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,072
Good to be back.

158
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:25,140
See you around.

159
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:29,503
If you're not doing anything later on,
want to come by the casino?

160
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:33,780
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me. What do you say?

161
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,917
- See you tonight.
- Cool.

162
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:40,850
I'll see you later on.

163
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:45,452
Be good.

164
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,062
Hey, Sarge. Good game. Maybe next time.

165
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:56,799
Hold up.

166
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:02,946
Maybe next time I won't see you
in the bleachers, smoking weed.

167
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:13,892
Welcome home, buddy.

168
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:18,653
I thought you had to be Native American
to own a casino.

169
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,962
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.

170
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:25,526
And what he slid under the table
convinced the powers that be it was true.

171
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:29,268
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.

172
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:31,842
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.

173
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:34,812
Just so you guys know,
I'm done after I triple my money.

174
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,871
That's what you said last time.

175
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:38,917
You wound up selling your body
for bus fare.

176
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:40,282
He had to walk.

177
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:43,077
Nobody's going to have any problems
finding this place.

178
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:46,852
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics
that I find most impressive.

179
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,359
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.

180
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:53,230
- Hi there.
- Hi. How you doing?

181
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,302
- See? Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.

182
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,300
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips. Let's gamble.

183
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,640
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?

184
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:11,279
Isn't it wonderful? All your gambling needs
under one great, big roof.

185
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:15,785
You got your ATM machines,
tellers to cash your paycheck...

186
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:18,585
and when you're here,
you don't got to worry about things...

187
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:23,061
like child support, rent,
laws of mathematical probability.

188
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:32,964
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like
to invite you to the VIP lounge.

189
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:45,340
- The dream team. You all healed up?
- Nice place.

190
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:47,583
Welcome to my world.

191
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:51,817
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.

192
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,655
If you need
a little female companionship, done.

193
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:56,285
All right?

194
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:59,229
- Get inside. Have a good time.
- Where you going?

195
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:02,461
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do. Enjoy.

196
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:08,002
Just remember,
nothing in here is free. Ma'am.

197
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:11,399
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.

198
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,908
Come on, this place is nothing
but fake boobs...

199
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,413
and real assholes, if you ask me.

200
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:17,573
Just water for me.

201
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:20,379
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.

202
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,386
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.

203
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:24,013
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.

204
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:26,855
Let's play, boys.

205
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,384
Go right ahead.

206
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:31,460
Already lost $1...

207
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,861
Good night.

208
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:36,063
Okay. Don't say we never did nothing
for you.

209
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:39,698
Don't worry, buddy,
everybody's scared their first time.

210
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,706
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.

211
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:46,006
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.

212
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,742
- This'll get you started.
- lf you're not back by morning...

213
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:51,180
we'll send a search party.

214
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,080
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.

215
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:06,819
You from here, or are you just visiting?

216
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:11,928
A little of both.

217
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,265
I grew up here.

218
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,430
So you're seeing all the old faces.

219
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:22,373
You could say that.

220
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,475
Your voice sounds very familiar.

221
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:41,415
Chris.

222
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:43,652
Deni.

223
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,118
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?

224
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:11,451
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?

225
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:13,785
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.

226
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:16,418
Let's go.

227
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,231
Six, easy six. Looking for a six to win.

228
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:21,323
We can do a six. Can we do a six?

229
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,334
I think I can do a six, right?

230
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:26,600
We got liftoff! Whack it, boys. Whack it.

231
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,798
Blue or pink, what do you think?

232
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,238
Who's up for two out of three?

233
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:37,214
I'm getting killed. Let me have a C-note
to put $200 on a bet.

234
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:38,283
- No.
- Come on.

235
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:39,715
Hell, no.

236
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:40,979
Look at them.

237
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:43,688
He's hot.

238
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:47,825
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.

239
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:49,854
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.

240
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,659
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.

241
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:55,495
There's another $100. Boom.
Give me some dice.

242
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:57,627
Looking for a six.

243
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,438
All right. Oh, please. Please.

244
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,598
Thank you. And you.

245
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,409
- Jimmy, don't roll. Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.

246
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,742
Hard six, six. Looking for a six.

247
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:13,176
Seven out. Line in, the dark side wins.

248
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:14,980
Last come'll get you some.

249
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:22,450
- You're good. But I saw it.
- Saw what?

250
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:24,694
I saw the switch.

251
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:26,687
This is a clean game, asshole.

252
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:30,125
Let's see about that.

253
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:34,533
Bet you'll roll a seven.

254
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:38,837
It's not your roll, sir.

255
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,247
Sir, it's not your roll.

256
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:44,976
Will you call security?

257
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:47,143
Put your bets down on the passline.

258
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:50,119
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?

259
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,157
No. We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.

260
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:54,124
The dice are coming up seven.

261
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,188
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.

262
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,495
- What a surprise.
- No, folks. No payouts.

263
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,059
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.

264
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:07,264
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.

265
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:09,170
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.

266
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:10,230
You're not the shooter.

267
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,470
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.

268
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:17,074
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.

269
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,818
Does your boss know about this?

270
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,653
Just give me my money.

271
00:22:30,562 --> 00:22:32,723
Come on. Let's go.

272
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:53,078
What now, bitch? Come on!

273
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:38,226
Special Forces.

274
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:41,724
Wow. I'll take that.

275
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:53,911
What are you doing?

276
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:00,881
Special Forces. Special treatment.

277
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:06,351
This guy knows Hamilton.

278
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:15,923
You just hold him down. Come on, Burke.

279
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:58,202
Folks.

280
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:02,608
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.

281
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:05,610
Whoever did this left him for dead.

282
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,749
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.

283
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,517
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...

284
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,320
I'll also need a copy of your write-up,
with toxicology...

285
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:16,827
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?

286
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:18,522
I'm just trying to get some facts.

287
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:22,761
You need to be arresting whoever tried
to kill my brother, not testing his blood.

288
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:26,396
I'm just doing my job, Michelle. Okay?
I understand how you feel.

289
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:28,496
But we still don't know who started all this.

290
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:31,839
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.

291
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:34,709
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn. I really will.

292
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,476
In the meantime I have to file a full report.

293
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:41,542
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.

294
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:48,617
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.

295
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:14,414
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you. They're for my best friend.

296
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:19,518
Hey, Sarge. So much for our VIP status.

297
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:28,328
Don't they teach you
any basic fighting skills in the Army?

298
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,492
How did you do?

299
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:33,595
Not good. But I tell you,
that guy was feeling me this morning.

300
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:41,477
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.

301
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:46,006
Chris, I don't know if you noticed,
but this ain't exactly home anymore.

302
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:04,960
Hang on.

303
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:09,901
Let me help you. Come on.

304
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,650
I'm good, Mom. I got it.

305
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:30,659
- Need some help?
- No. I'm just milking it.

306
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:36,432
There's some old crutches in the garage.

307
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:43,403
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches. That's nice.

308
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:57,544
Did you see the hole?

309
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,832
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.

310
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:15,735
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.

311
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:16,865
You make this?

312
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:18,068
Need anything?

313
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:20,976
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man. It's good.

314
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,309
No, I'm good, Dad. Thanks.

315
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:51,271
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.

316
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:53,971
I might've had serious issues
with your career choice...

317
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:57,607
but it just didn't seem fair
to take it out on an innocent truck.

318
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:00,075
Where you headed?

319
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:02,676
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?

320
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:03,755
Let's go.

321
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:17,499
Your whole life,
all you wanted to do was get out of here.

322
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:19,700
What made you come back now?

323
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:23,037
You're going to think I'm crazy.

324
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:25,466
I would think about the mill.

325
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:30,471
When I was a kid going to visit you at work,
the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...

326
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,011
You remember that smell.

327
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,546
I remember a lot of nice things
before the mill closed.

328
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:45,421
When did they go out of business?

329
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,495
Closed about six months ago.

330
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,998
There's a Home Depot
about 15 minutes up the road.

331
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:53,561
And that?

332
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:57,667
Don't ask.

333
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:18,661
First of all, I just want to say thanks.

334
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:22,760
- For what?
- For making that stickman.

335
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:26,604
He's been fired
and his gaming permit's been pulled.

336
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,771
I just have no idea
why my security cameras didn't catch that.

337
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:38,043
They miss a lot in your place,
don't they, Jay?

338
00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:42,317
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.

339
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:44,483
Wait a second.

340
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:49,357
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy. Understandably.

341
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:53,261
You don't know what kind of assholes
they have to put up with on a daily basis.

342
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:55,322
Look, they've been reprimanded.

343
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:57,296
But they say you went nuts, man.

344
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,394
I'm sorry. Insensitive.

345
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:02,406
I know the proper term that vets use
is post-traumatic stress...

346
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:05,874
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever. You tore my place apart...

347
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:08,880
and it wasn't easy to get my guys
to agree not to press charges.

348
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:12,246
Chris, if you had a problem,
shouldn't you have come to me?

349
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:16,812
I want to bring you inside.

350
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,619
I want to make you head of security.

351
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:23,417
- What do you say?
- No.

352
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:35,133
I guess you probably need time
to think about it. I figured as much.

353
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:39,541
This is for you.

354
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:43,370
It's a little something to help you get,
you know...

355
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,350
Come on, man, don't be like that.

356
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:51,753
I came all the way out here to your house,
just to see you get back on your feet.

357
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:54,386
I'm going to the sheriff.

358
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:58,422
I'm really sorry you feel that way.

359
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,397
I'll see you around, Chris.

360
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:19,113
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?

361
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,478
Excuse me.

362
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:26,117
Excuse me.

363
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:28,919
I got to call you back.

364
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:32,128
Hey, Chris.

365
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,465
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.

366
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,262
I'm here to press charges.

367
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:40,971
This isn't about that incident
at the casino a while back?

368
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,199
Yeah. It is.

369
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,508
Because that matter's closed.

370
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:48,839
You're lucky you weren't brought in
on charges. I mean...

371
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:50,642
Did you even look into it?

372
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:55,012
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.

373
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,883
An internal investigation?

374
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,587
I know you're familiar
with the term no-fly zone.

375
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,187
Because that's what the casino is.

376
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:06,624
Since the mill closed down...

377
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:10,357
that casino is the main source
of revenue in this town.

378
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:13,563
So case closed, basically.

379
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:16,535
We'll see you.

380
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:21,272
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?

381
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:33,882
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.

382
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:39,693
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.

383
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:42,797
This is my town. Okay?

384
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,826
I'm the sheriff here.

385
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:48,031
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.

386
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:52,803
Now please get out of my building.

387
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:17,265
- Come in.
- Thanks.

388
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:19,392
This belongs to you.

389
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:24,106
I appreciate that. I thought this was history.

390
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:26,871
- Could have left it in the trash, but l...
- Deni?

391
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:29,743
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.

392
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,717
Can I talk to you outside for a second?

393
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:38,051
Quick walk. Mom, I'll be right back.

394
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:45,721
- How you been?
- Been better.

395
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:48,693
Talk to the sheriff yet?

396
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:52,232
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.

397
00:34:52,303 --> 00:34:55,170
He sure as hell didn't seem
like much of a sheriff.

398
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,798
He's up for reelection, you know.

399
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:01,573
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.

400
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:05,414
How about you?

401
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:09,386
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.

402
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:10,749
Been reading these books.

403
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:13,757
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.

404
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:16,851
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?

405
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:18,828
I have my moments.

406
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:22,660
So, the casino, huh?

407
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:26,429
Yeah. Been there almost a year.

408
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:30,363
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.

409
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:34,276
I like that.

410
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:37,777
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself,
hasn't he?

411
00:35:37,882 --> 00:35:39,873
He's a real go-getter, that one.

412
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:42,853
He must be. I heard he got you.

413
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,019
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.

414
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:54,154
You still work for him, though.

415
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,766
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.

416
00:35:58,036 --> 00:35:59,264
I suppose so.

417
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,700
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?

418
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:19,881
Thanks for the jacket.

419
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:24,593
And where is he?

420
00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:41,469
It's okay, Mom. He's stabilized.

421
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:44,775
It was close.

422
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,444
Crystal meth.

423
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:49,019
I'm sorry. I never did it before.

424
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:52,386
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.

425
00:36:57,495 --> 00:37:00,157
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...

426
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:01,163
Stop.

427
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:04,899
Where?

428
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:07,529
From the security guys
working at the casino.

429
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:12,566
Chris, wait. Call the police.

430
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:14,907
No. It won't do any good.

431
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:27,858
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.

432
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:31,928
What are you doing?

433
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:35,693
No, Chris. Not like this.

434
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:38,929
Listen to me.

435
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:42,302
If you go out of here with that gun,
they're going to nail...

436
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,611
I've been looking for you.

437
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,356
Guess that changes our relationship
a bit, huh?

438
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:02,671
You should not have come
looking for trouble.

439
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:05,868
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.

440
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,899
Now!

441
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:12,678
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.

442
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,547
Put your hands on the hood.

443
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:23,154
I advise you to give this offer
more than a little serious thought.

444
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:25,928
If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.

445
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:27,726
Now, this is a sweetheart plea.

446
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:30,825
Normally they wouldn't even
put it on the table...

447
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:33,268
but your military record can't be ignored.

448
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:36,568
Three months home arrest,
some community service...

449
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:40,808
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.

450
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:43,003
Look at it from the other side.

451
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,743
There's over a dozen witnesses,
none of whom will paint a flattering picture.

452
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:49,445
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.

453
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:51,818
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.

454
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:54,551
They're only offering me this deal
just to keep me quiet.

455
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,616
I still say you should take it.

456
00:41:57,094 --> 00:42:00,029
I wasn't wrong. And I won't say I was.

457
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:03,763
Our job is to keep order.

458
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:06,793
There was no chance
of that once he came in.

459
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:10,470
Me and my men,
we were just trying to control him.

460
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:16,474
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.

461
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:22,219
So violent, so dangerous,
so highly trained...

462
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:26,885
that he dispatched six
of the casino security staff single-handedly.

463
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:29,586
Six men, single-handedly.

464
00:42:30,661 --> 00:42:34,153
His weapon of choice,
a simple piece of cedar...

465
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:39,199
which, in his hands,
became a devastating force with one aim:

466
00:42:39,437 --> 00:42:42,167
To hurt people and destroy property.

467
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:50,213
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.

468
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:54,080
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct. My right forearm.

469
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:58,610
Both bones with a single shot. It was crazy.

470
00:43:00,057 --> 00:43:01,820
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.

471
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:05,157
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.

472
00:43:05,196 --> 00:43:08,359
Did he give you
any kind of advance warning...

473
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,460
a chance to defend yourself?

474
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:14,993
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.

475
00:43:15,072 --> 00:43:18,564
Besides, he seemed to be too busy
enjoying himself from what I could see.

476
00:43:18,643 --> 00:43:21,510
So from what you saw,
he seemed to have some kind of purpose?

477
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:22,773
He had a point to prove.

478
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:25,941
I was emptying machines
when he came in and started swinging.

479
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,348
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.

480
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,387
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.

481
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:32,012
He seemed like a complete psychopath.

482
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:34,421
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.

483
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:35,982
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.

484
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,652
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.

485
00:43:37,728 --> 00:43:39,059
I have no further questions.

486
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,157
Mr. Crowe, you may present
your client's case.

487
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:45,802
You're fired.

488
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:54,500
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.

489
00:43:56,547 --> 00:43:57,707
Order!

490
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:06,117
If you choose to represent yourself,
and not be represented by legal counsel...

491
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,092
you realize that you can't
then claim a mistrial on that basis?

492
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:13,662
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.

493
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:24,300
I don't deny anything
that was said here today.

494
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,707
Does that mean
you're changing your plea to guilty?

495
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:28,438
I'm not guilty of anything...

496
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:30,810
except standing up for myself
when the law wouldn't.

497
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:33,816
Objection. He's trying
to introduce prior events.

498
00:44:33,884 --> 00:44:37,115
Sustained. Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.

499
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:42,291
I grew up in this town.

500
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,288
People used to walk tall in this town.

501
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:48,021
They wouldn't have traded the mill
for a crooked casino.

502
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:50,192
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...

503
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:53,361
And they wouldn't have stood around
while drugs were sold to kids.

504
00:44:53,437 --> 00:44:54,461
- Objection!
- Sustained.

505
00:44:54,538 --> 00:44:57,803
Mr. Vaughn, you're close
to being held in contempt.

506
00:44:58,242 --> 00:44:59,800
I was justified in what I did.

507
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:03,244
And if you acquit me of these charges,
then I'm gonna run for sheriff.

508
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:05,838
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.

509
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:07,612
Order.

510
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,885
Please take your seat.

511
00:45:11,355 --> 00:45:13,983
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged
with contempt.

512
00:45:14,058 --> 00:45:16,185
And I will make sure that this...

513
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,386
- Objection.
- Sustained.

514
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:20,726
...never happens to anyone again
without punishing those who did it.

515
00:45:20,798 --> 00:45:23,289
I'm ordering the jury to ignore
what they've just seen.

516
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:25,631
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.

517
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:30,673
Order.

518
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:34,234
Or you're all charged with contempt!

519
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:47,890
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?

520
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,653
We have, Your Honor.

521
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:51,354
Defendant, please rise.

522
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:56,030
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn,
not guilty.

523
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:17,620
This is mine.

524
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:28,321
Sheriff Vaughn!

525
00:47:08,272 --> 00:47:10,900
You won the election. Congratulations.

526
00:47:10,975 --> 00:47:13,967
But we do have a tradition
of professional courtesy up here.

527
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:17,207
And I can personally vouch
for each and every one of these men.

528
00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:18,872
They're good deputies.

529
00:47:18,983 --> 00:47:20,575
You're all fired.

530
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,290
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.

531
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:46,563
You're joking, right?

532
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:48,899
License and registration.

533
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:01,942
What's the problem, Sheriff?

534
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:05,955
You. And the drugs you're peddling
out of your casino.

535
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:10,115
The only thing that's going on in my casino
is construction. You took care of that.

536
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:13,186
That's right. And I plan on taking care
of everything else, too.

537
00:49:13,264 --> 00:49:15,892
If you can, try to think this through:

538
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:18,627
A casino is a license to print money.

539
00:49:18,836 --> 00:49:20,929
Why would I jeopardize that
by selling drugs?

540
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:23,872
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.

541
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:26,739
Really? The only thing I think has changed
around here...

542
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,405
is that you get to wake up every morning
and put on that nifty little badge.

543
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:34,507
But underneath it is the same guy who
couldn't make it playing college football...

544
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:36,779
and apparently couldn't make it
in the Army...

545
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:39,151
and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.

546
00:49:39,223 --> 00:49:41,020
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

547
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:45,589
And if you push too hard, you're going
to be a man who never gets to see 40.

548
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:50,491
License, please.

549
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,300
Thanks, Sheriff.

550
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:05,081
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.

551
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:07,480
What's wrong with my taillights?

552
00:50:10,988 --> 00:50:12,478
They're broken.

553
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:44,210
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.

554
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:51,025
No.

555
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:56,655
Come on, man. You know I hate cops.

556
00:50:56,734 --> 00:51:00,670
You've been sheriff for about two minutes,
and I'm already starting to hate you.

557
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:03,298
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.

558
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:07,174
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors
for friends. That's how it starts.

559
00:51:07,244 --> 00:51:10,509
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes,
setting up roadblocks...

560
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:13,311
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?

561
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:20,686
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.

562
00:51:20,758 --> 00:51:23,352
I need you to take me to drug school.

563
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,668
I get to wear a uniform?

564
00:51:32,503 --> 00:51:35,165
The stuff in this town
is five-star, factory pure.

565
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:37,730
- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.

566
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:40,971
We know Hamilton's boys
are selling that shit down at the casino.

567
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:43,103
Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.

568
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,274
So we got to play follow-the-money,
starting with the tweakers.

569
00:51:46,383 --> 00:51:48,044
That'll give us the suppliers.

570
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:51,918
These guys are real edgy,
so delicacy is the key.

571
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:54,551
Then we put the squeeze on them...

572
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:56,752
till they spit out the location
of the next buy.

573
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:59,318
- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.

574
00:52:00,264 --> 00:52:01,925
That's a good show.

575
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:04,633
Phase three: we strike.

576
00:52:04,768 --> 00:52:09,102
- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right. Delicacy and precision.

577
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:11,902
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.

578
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:30,724
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.

579
00:52:31,428 --> 00:52:32,952
- Officer.
- Yeah.

580
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,765
Search him.

581
00:52:40,671 --> 00:52:44,903
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs. Arms down.

582
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:48,974
You been working out?

583
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:52,278
Nothing there.

584
00:52:53,684 --> 00:52:55,584
Somebody needs a bath.

585
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:08,792
Now you read me my rights,
then you take me in...

586
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,863
and I call my lawyer.

587
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:15,735
Okay. But I have a hunch
there may be something else in here.

588
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:18,666
Could be.

589
00:53:25,382 --> 00:53:27,850
Go to it, Deputy. Have a good time.

590
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:10,586
- He ain't talking.
- I know.

591
00:54:28,445 --> 00:54:30,208
Handles pretty good.

592
00:54:42,326 --> 00:54:43,657
He's clean.

593
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:50,363
Guess we got to go with Plan B.

594
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:53,201
Screw you both.

595
00:54:54,004 --> 00:54:56,268
I do have a bit of information for you.

596
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:00,037
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.

597
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,441
Spit it out.

598
00:55:03,013 --> 00:55:04,878
You're gonna get hurt.

599
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:11,454
What an idiot.

600
00:55:22,566 --> 00:55:25,364
Why does it always have to be your fight?

601
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:30,806
- You might need this.
- No.

602
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:35,835
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on. You're just being stubborn.

603
00:55:35,912 --> 00:55:38,142
You and me both, boy.

604
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:42,045
Chris, listen.

605
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:45,819
You be careful.

606
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:48,418
I will.

607
00:55:58,602 --> 00:56:00,968
Please step away from the vehicle!

608
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:04,131
Mr. Booth, are you still upset
over that body-cavity search?

609
00:56:04,174 --> 00:56:06,074
I forgot, you got no vehicle.

610
00:56:10,313 --> 00:56:12,941
Please disperse! There is nothing to...

611
00:56:15,686 --> 00:56:17,051
Can I talk to you?

612
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,644
- Sure.
- Over here?

613
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,387
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.

614
00:56:27,464 --> 00:56:30,058
Think they're gonna take it that far?

615
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:42,211
- I'm with you, man. I'll check in later.
- Okay.

616
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:58,793
A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.

617
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,670
You making house calls?

618
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:15,167
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.

619
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,250
How's the food around here?

620
00:57:22,819 --> 00:57:23,911
Nice.

621
00:57:26,123 --> 00:57:28,318
I brought you special treats:

622
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,695
Salad, fried chicken...

623
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:36,693
potato salad.

624
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:39,961
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.

625
00:57:50,714 --> 00:57:53,683
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.

626
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:59,146
I figured you were making some changes
around here...

627
00:57:59,256 --> 00:58:00,951
I could make a few myself.

628
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:07,189
Salt and pepper?

629
00:59:25,675 --> 00:59:27,404
- Who is that?
- Pete.

630
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:30,238
- Want something to eat?
- No. I'm good, man.

631
00:59:42,959 --> 00:59:44,950
I got to get a bigger bed.

632
00:59:49,299 --> 00:59:50,766
No, you don't.

633
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:20,887
Do it.

634
01:00:22,966 --> 01:00:24,331
I'm hungry.

635
01:00:25,568 --> 01:00:27,365
We've got leftovers.

636
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:33,433
I want pancakes. And eggs. And bacon.

637
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:50,020
I told you, Vaughn.

638
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:57,230
Stay here.

639
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:05,571
Who needs to step away
from the vehicle now, Vaughn?

640
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:10,913
Truck for a truck, baby!

641
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:15,009
That's right! Truck for a truck!

642
01:01:30,266 --> 01:01:31,528
Get down!

643
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:34,730
Tear it up, boys!

644
01:01:45,048 --> 01:01:47,073
Pete, something's burning.

645
01:01:56,659 --> 01:01:58,024
Take this.

646
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:00,795
Get in there.

647
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,843
Good morning, honey.

648
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:22,741
Get out of here.

649
01:02:25,221 --> 01:02:27,086
Sheriff, are you home?

650
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:31,857
I told you someone was going to get hurt!

651
01:03:07,497 --> 01:03:08,828
Come here.

652
01:03:09,899 --> 01:03:12,299
When I say now, start shooting!

653
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:14,134
Over there!

654
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:17,901
Stay low.

655
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:21,542
Vaughn! You got to get me out of here.

656
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,076
Move it. Go! Move it, old man.

657
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:29,410
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.

658
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:31,014
Sit down.

659
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:35,483
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?

660
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:44,591
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch. Check it out.

661
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,434
Come on! Get me out of here, man!

662
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:23,172
- What's it worth to you? Where's the lab?
- Screw you!

663
01:04:28,745 --> 01:04:32,806
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!

664
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:40,316
Drop it.

665
01:04:43,226 --> 01:04:44,557
Stay down!

666
01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:49,631
Stay down.

667
01:04:56,773 --> 01:04:58,035
You okay?

668
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:07,007
Shit.

669
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:21,391
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.

670
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:39,915
I'm going in!

671
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:46,882
Right there, punk!

672
01:05:48,258 --> 01:05:50,852
Come on, Chris! Come on!

673
01:06:01,337 --> 01:06:02,668
Deni, now!

674
01:07:17,313 --> 01:07:18,974
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

675
01:07:21,117 --> 01:07:22,414
I'm sorry.

676
01:07:23,986 --> 01:07:26,580
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.

677
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:34,319
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.

678
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:06,855
You gonna be okay?

679
01:09:40,923 --> 01:09:42,220
Hey, Chris.

680
01:09:43,226 --> 01:09:44,716
Get up, Jay.

681
01:09:44,794 --> 01:09:46,557
Just a second.

682
01:09:47,096 --> 01:09:50,395
Remember when we used to play
hide-and-seek up here?

683
01:09:55,104 --> 01:09:57,629
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!

684
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:01,969
Look, Chris...

685
01:10:08,918 --> 01:10:12,354
You want to know
what my new favorite sound's gonna be?

686
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:15,648
The sound of you screaming
like a little bitch.

687
01:10:15,825 --> 01:10:20,660
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no! You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!

688
01:10:20,897 --> 01:10:23,297
You forgot this: this is my town!

689
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:17,509
Yes!

690
01:12:36,298 --> 01:12:37,822
You're nothing.

691
01:12:54,316 --> 01:12:57,683
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.

692
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,778
This is my town.

693
01:13:02,224 --> 01:13:03,987
You're under arrest.

694
01:13:10,332 --> 01:13:12,095
That ought to do it.

695
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:16,766
What are you doing?

696
01:13:16,906 --> 01:13:20,069
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.

697
01:13:20,743 --> 01:13:22,506
That's how it starts.

698
01:13:22,578 --> 01:13:26,605
Next you'll be accepting bribes
and setting speed traps all over town.

699
01:13:26,716 --> 01:13:29,378
Cutting up trucks. You know how you are.

700
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:32,086
Not to mention the cavity searches.

701
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:35,621
You're gonna like that.

702
01:13:35,691 --> 01:13:38,751
Speaking of which,
do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?

703
01:13:38,828 --> 01:13:42,195
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?

704
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:45,863
He's probably blowing on
somebody's dice right now.

705
01:13:48,504 --> 01:13:49,698
That's lunch.

706
01:13:49,772 --> 01:13:52,104
Let's go pick up my old man,
grab something to eat.

707
01:13:52,174 --> 01:13:53,937
I'm with you, buddy.

708
01:13:55,174 --> 01:13:57,937
