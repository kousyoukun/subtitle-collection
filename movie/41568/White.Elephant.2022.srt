1
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,419
生日快乐,宝贝。
Happy birthday, baby.

2
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:21,671
对不起,我迟到了。我的歉意。
Sorry I'm late. My apologies.

3
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:22,903
不用担心。我不会耽误你太久的。
No worries. I won't keep you long.

4
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:29,778
我要准备一份证词，我知道今天是你妻子的生日。
I have a deposition to prepare, and I understand that today was your wife's birthday.

5
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,582
是,是的。
It is, yeah.

6
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:41,020
我不喜欢把你从回忆中拉出来，但我相信你明白有些对话最好是面对面的。
I do not enjoy pulling you away from your remembrances, but I'm sure you understand that some conversations are best had in person.

7
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:46,432
你确定你的助手准备好了吗?
Now, you're sure your associate is prepared to do this thing?

8
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:47,994
他是。
He is.

9
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,865
因为结果必须是决定性的。
Because the results need to be definitive.

10
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:52,031
这将是。
It will be.

11
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:56,508
至于路易斯，我们的意图很明确吗?
And where Luis is concerned, our intentions are clear?

12
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,939
- - - - - -晶体。——好。
- Crystal. - Good.

13
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:03,416
和俄罗斯人的交易太重要了不能让路易斯·贝拉斯克斯妨碍。
This deal with the Russians is too important to let Luis Velasquez get in the way.

14
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:06,452
阿诺德得快点了。
Arnold will need to make haste.

15
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:11,721
因为他们想在今天下班前把现金存入我的办公室。
Because they want a cash deposit in my office by the close of business today.

16
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:13,591
不是一个问题。
Not a problem.

17
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:14,790
很好。
Very well.

18
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:16,924
向前,向上。
Onwards and upwards.


20
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,027
祝你玩得愉快。
Have a good one.

21
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:14,850
嘿,冲突。
Hey, Carlito.

22
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:19,019
搜索的借口。我有，信任问题。
Excuse the search. I got, uh, trust issues.

23
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:20,493
我甚至不相信自己。
I don't even trust myself.

24
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:21,923
你理解。
You understand.

25
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:24,090
我明白了。
I understand.

26
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:34,771
喂，小伙子，给他带点…一些,嗯,龙舌兰酒。
Yo, corrier, bring him some, uh... some, uh, tequila.

27
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:36,410
——如果?——没有。
- Sí? - No.

28
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,843
我知道你只是公事公办。
I know you're strictly business.

29
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:48,752
让我给你一些信息，也许能救你一命。
Let me bless you with information that might save your life.

30
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:50,754
这里的人不会相信你的。
They're never gonna trust you here.

31
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:54,758
对阿诺德·所罗门这样的人来说，你就是个小豆子。
To people like Arnold Solomon, you're just another fucking beaner.

32
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,796
就在你最需要他们的时候，他们却因为不喜欢你而把你推到车底下。
Just when you need them the most, they'll throw you under the bus because they don't like you.

33
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:01,028
还有Entiendes ?
¿Entiendes?

34
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:07,067
我是路易斯·维拉斯。
I'm Luis Velasquez.

35
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,707
我受到全世界的爱戴和尊敬。
I'm loved and respected worldwide.

36
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:11,071
你也可以。
And you can be, too.

37
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:20,080
鉴于俄罗斯的威胁，所罗门先生认为让我们做你的合作伙伴是一种保险。
You see, in light of the Russian threat, Mr. Solomon thought that having us as your partner would be a form of insurance.

38
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:25,888
唷，这家伙要杀了我。
Yo, this guy kills me, man.

39
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,087
你是认真的吗?
Are you serious?

40
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:30,662
你给我穿上"灵魂列车"的鞋子滚出去。
You take those "Soul Train" shoes and get the fuck out of here.

41
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:31,894
你站到铁轨那边去。
You stay your side of the tracks.

42
00:06:31,996 --> 00:06:33,830
我会坚持我的。你明白吗?
I'll stay on mine. You understand?

43
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:36,866
-谈判结束了?——走吧。
- End of negotiations, then? - Go.

44
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:38,571
“谈判的终结。”
"End of negotiations."

45
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:40,507
你他妈有什么毛病?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

46
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,708
我真该让赫克托踢你的屁股。
I should have fucking Hector just kick you in the ass.

47
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,173
我不需要你或者他妈的阿诺德·所罗门来对付俄国人。
I don't need you or Arnold fucking Solomon to deal with the Russians.

48
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:51,980
如果……如果所罗门先生提高报价呢?
What if... What if Mr. Solomon raised his offer?

49
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:53,212
让我想想。
Let me think about that.

50
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:55,214
所罗门操。
Fuck Solomon.

51
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,826
嘿!
Hey!

52
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,936
不到的。
Carlito.

53
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:16,202
啊!哦!
Ah! Oh!

54
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:21,878
昨天的比赛太精彩了。
That was a hell of a game yesterday.

55
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,849
我的意思是，胜利并不是一切，但它比第二名强多了。
I mean, winning isn't everything, but it beats the hell out of coming in second.

56
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:30,051
你不喜欢你的家乡的足球，是吗?
You don't care for football where you come from, do you?

57
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:33,725
不，我猜你们都是冰球迷。
Nah, you're all hockey crazy, I bet.

58
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:35,826
你确定就是这个?
You sure this is it?

59
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:37,597
好像是我会计的大楼。
Looks like my accountant's building.

60
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,764
我的线人拿假释听证会打赌。
My CI has wagered a parole hearing on it.

61
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:40,864
我们很好。
We're good.

62
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:44,802
今晚有什么好事吗?
So, doing anything nice tonight?

63
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:48,003
给我留下了深刻的印象,侦探。
I'm impressed, Detective.

64
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:49,972
是我手机上的提醒。
It was an alert on my phone.

65
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:52,007
生日快乐。
Happy birthday.

66
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:54,108
谢谢你！
Thank you.

67
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:59,784
宿醉可不能把它吓跑，弗林。
Can't scare it away with a hangover, Flynn.

68
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:01,522
我很好。
I'm fine.

69
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,759
那个西装革履的家伙是谁?
Who the hell is the slick suit?

70
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:12,830
一个明显不是雅利安人的顾客脖子上有党卫军纹身。
SS neck tattoo on a distinctly non-Aryan-looking customer.

71
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,898
海军陆战队狙击手用这个纹身。
Marine snipers use that tattoo.

72
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,672
他们不应该这么做，但侦察兵狙击手倾向于制定自己的规则。
They're not supposed to, but Scout Snipers tend to make their own rules.

73
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:20,838
真的吗?
Really?

74
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,105
听起来像我认识的另一个人。
Sounds like someone else I know.

75
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:26,008
咬我,Koschek。
Bite me, Koschek.

76
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,911
做梦吧，硬汉。
In your dreams, tough guy.

77
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:49,801
看着他。
Look at him.

78
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,034
我应该查查他的车牌。
I should run his plate.

79
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,812
他妈的。
Fuck.

80
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:10,822
微笑,只小猪。
Smile, little piggy.

81
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:12,890
是他逼我们的。
He fucking made us.

82
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:14,188
我要把他带回来。
I'm bringing him in.

83
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,846
看我的鼻子。
Look at my nose.

84
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:40,082
一切都查清楚了，警探。
Everything checks out, Detective.

85
00:09:40,184 --> 00:09:41,281
你可以走了。
You're free to go.

86
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:42,348
谢谢。
Thanks.

87
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,825
邻居们什么也没看见。
Neighbors didn't see anything.

88
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:51,192
除了我们看到的和没看到的，什么都没有。
Nothing to go on other than what we saw or didn't see.

89
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:52,193
我们是愚蠢的。
We were stupid.

90
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:55,163
应该跟踪他的。
Should have tailed him.

91
00:09:55,265 --> 00:09:57,165
哦,天啊。
Oh, geez.

92
00:09:57,332 --> 00:10:00,971
——哦,耶稣。-是的。
- Oh, Jesus. - Yeah.

93
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:02,742
这太疯狂了，科斯切克。
This is some crazy shit, Koschek.

94
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:03,974
糟糕的一天。
Hell of a day.

95
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:05,679
就像狂欢节后的波旁街。
Like Bourbon Street after Mardi Gras.

96
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:07,142
好吧，派对结束了。
Yeah, well, the party's over.

97
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:09,078
我和戴利要接手了
Me and Daley are taking over.

98
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,344
队长想让你们俩回家。
Captain wants you two to go home.

99
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:12,785
什么?
What?

100
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:14,985
这是他妈的扯淡。这是我们的案子。
That's fucking bullshit. This is our case.

101
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:16,822
-慢着，慢着，冷静点。-回拨，富林。
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, down, girl. - Dial it back, Flynn.

102
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:18,285
你刚才说什么?
What did you just say?

103
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:21,354
我们只是听从警监的命令，好吗?
Hey, we're just following Captain's orders, alright?

104
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:23,092
但我们看到嫌犯了。
But we had eyes on the suspect.

105
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:25,699
然后你让他跑了，一切都乱套了。
And then you let him get away and all hell broke loose.

106
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:27,030
好吧?
Okay?

107
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,705
不值得。
It's not worth it.

108
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,201
螺丝你,尼尔。
Screw you, Lanier.

嘿。
Hey.

117
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,339
他准备好见你们了。
He's ready to see y'all now.

118
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:02,389
这个案子归福利特管
The case goes to Follett.

119
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:04,523
他知道该怎么做。
He'll know what to do.

120
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:11,167
卡洛对待委拉斯开兹就像对待冰冷的职业球员一样。
Carlo handled Velasquez like an ice-cold pro.

121
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,808
他不想谈判，所以你的口信已经传达了。
He didn't want to negotiate, so your message has been delivered.

122
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,469
你不能说我没试过。
Well, you can't say I didn't try.

123
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:20,979
告诉他。
Tell him.

124
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:25,313
两种可能的目击者。
Two possible witnesses.

125
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:26,985
他们是警察。
They were cops.

126
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:29,922
他们能把这次袭击和你联系起来吗?
Can they tie the hit to you?

127
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:31,352
还是你对我?
Or you to me?

128
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:34,190
不，他们可能在监视委拉斯开兹。
No, they were probably staking out Velasquez.

129
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,994
我是说，纯粹的巧合。
I mean, pure coincidence.

130
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:37,358
这是你的错。
This is your fault.

131
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,899
——我知道。-你应该去的。
- I know. - You should have been there.

132
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,461
他会解决这个问题。
He'll fix this.

133
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:45,135
在很多方面，卡洛在这方面都比我强。
In many ways, Carlo is better at this stuff than I am.

134
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:47,841
-这是你的烂摊子。-你来打扫。
- This is your mess. - You clean it up.

135
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:50,041
给你48小时。
You got 48 hours.

136
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:51,911
就当我做了吧，先生。
Consider it done, sir.

137
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:57,081
你最好。
You better.

138
00:12:57,183 --> 00:12:58,313
我们需要地址。
We need addresses.

139
00:12:58,415 --> 00:12:59,985
正确的。
Right.

140
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:02,383
我在来的路上给部门联系人打了电话。
Yeah, I called my department contact on the way here.

141
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:04,825
我只是在等他破解他们的文件。
I'm just waiting for him to crack open their files.

142
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:06,519
然后我们好。
Then we're good.

143
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:15,561
我拍到了他们的车牌号，应该很快就能搞定了。
I got a picture of their license plate, so it should be a done deal in no time.

144
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,135
好,好。
Good, good.

145
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,104
我得把这破玩意交给福利特。
I got to get this shit over to Follett.

146
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:21,534
那我来帮你完成。
Then I'll help you finish up.

147
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:48,297
我想俄国人会很高兴墨西哥人被除掉的。
I think the Russians will be happy with the Mexican out of the way.

148
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:52,466
很好。艾丽卡。
Very well. Erica.

149
00:13:52,568 --> 00:14:00,474
随着这笔交易的成功完成，阿诺德将成为一个非常有权势的人。
With the successful conclusion of this deal, Arnold is going to become an extraordinarily powerful man.

150
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:02,443
谢谢你！
Thank you.

151
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:04,610
房地产不是我的菜。
Real estate's never been my thing.

152
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:06,282
是的,太糟糕了。
Yeah, too bad.

153
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:08,350
委拉斯开兹应该知道不要跟他合作。
Velasquez should have known don't go along with him.

154
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:11,650
你了解古希腊人吗，盖比?
Do you know much about the ancient Greeks, Gabe?

155
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:17,161
嗯，他们非常重视他们的自由。
Well, they valued their liberty highly.

156
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:21,033
希腊人鼓励一种自力更生的个人主义。
The Greeks encouraged a kind of self-reliant individualism.

157
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:25,532
当时没有法律可言，所以警察也就没必要了。
There were no laws to speak of, so police weren't necessary.

158
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:27,974
听起来像是我喜欢的地方。
Sounds like my kind of place.

159
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:33,045
但古希腊人在偷窃或抢劫方面是划清界限的。
But the ancient Greeks drew a line in the sand when it came to stealing or robbery.

160
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:39,216
他们不喜欢牛被偷，也不喜欢人家被破门而入。
They did not like their cattle being stolen and they did not like their homes being broken into.

161
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:44,155
但是没有警察，他们怎么找到罪犯呢?
But with no police, how would they find the culprit?

162
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:50,260
事实上，他们有各种各样的方法来判定有罪。
Actually, they had various methods to determine guilt.

163
00:14:50,362 --> 00:14:53,428
其中一项行动涉及围捕12名嫌疑人。
One of them involved rounding up 12 suspects.

164
00:14:53,530 --> 00:15:07,046
法官会给这些嫌疑人每人一根6英寸长的棍子，但他会告诉他们，小偷的棍子会在第二天早上多长一英寸。
And a judge would give each of those suspects a stick 6 inches long, but he would tell them that the thief's stick would grow an extra inch by the next morning.

165
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:19,652
通常，有罪的一方会咬下他的一英寸的棍子，然后第二天早上，他会在那里手里拿着5英寸的承认有罪的棍子。
Invariably, the guilty party would chew off one inch of his stick, and then the next morning, he would be there holding a 5-inch admission of guilt stick in his hand.

166
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:34,535
重点是，在我做辩护律师的30多年里，我知道了一个无可辩驳的事实，那就是罪犯最大的敌人是他们自己。
The point is, for the 30-something years that I've been a defense attorney, I have learned one irrefutable truth, and that is criminals are their own worst enemy.

167
00:15:34,637 --> 00:15:37,406
我不能说我不同意你。
Can't say I disagree with you.

168
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:40,706
听着，我很感谢你的送餐。
Well, listen, I appreciate the delivery.

169
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:44,677
和弗拉德的交易会让大家赚很多钱。
And this deal with Vlad is gonna make everyone a lot of money.

170
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,217
阿诺德似乎是这么认为的。
Arnold seems to think so.

171
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:47,988
你不?
You don't?

172
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,057
我怎么想真的不重要。
It really doesn't matter what I think.

173
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,520
听。
Listen.

174
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:56,029
阿诺德信任你，信任是有价值的。
Arnold trusts you, and trust is a valuable commodity.


176
00:15:57,528 --> 00:16:05,005
他相信你能在街上保护他，他相信我能照顾他的法律和经济利益。
He trusts you to protect him on the street, and he trusts me to look after his legal and financial interests.

177
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:08,470
在这方面，我们是相似的。
In that respect, we're alike.

178
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:13,112
我们认识有几年了，对吧，福利特先生?
We've known each other for a few years now, right, Mr. Follett?

179
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:16,742
你对我很好，我很感激。
You've been very kind to me, and I appreciate that.

180
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:20,647
但是…我们一点也不像。
But... we are nothing alike.

181
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:28,787
你到达。
You're reaching.

182
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:34,199
来吧,现在。
Come on, now.

183
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:37,400
呼吸。
Breathe.

184
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:39,501
呼吸。
Breathe.

185
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:47,476
你不能再这样下去了。
You can't keep going on like this.

186
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:50,182
愤怒会吞噬你直到你一无所有。
The anger's gonna eat away at you until there's nothing left.

187
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:54,516
——我知道。-在阿富汗，我们都经历了一些非常糟糕的事情。
- I know. - In Afghanistan, we both lived through some really bad things.

188
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:57,618
但你在沙坑里可是个冷酷的专业人士。
But you were a cold professional back in the sandbox.

189
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,389
你头脑清醒的时候还是这样。
You still are when your head's on straight.

190
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:03,195
但你似乎下定决心不想好起来。
But you seem determined not to want to get any better.

191
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:08,497
你觉得我应该去找个高薪的心理医生吐露心声吗?
Think I should go to some overpaid shrink and spill my guts?

192
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,136
不能伤害。
Couldn't hurt.

193
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,600
至少，你可以保住你的事业。
At the very least, you might save your career.

194
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:15,702
我已经知道我是怎么了。
I already know what's wrong with me.

195
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:21,378
每次我遇到一个人，我都会不由自主地想到杀死他们最好最有效的方法。
Every time I meet someone, I automatically think about the best and most efficient way to kill them.

196
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,183
我再也关不掉它了。
I can't switch it off anymore.

197
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:26,284
我们都经历过你现在的处境。
We've all been where you're at.

198
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:29,584
你要学会把外面的一切都抛在脑后。
You just got to learn to leave the outside outside.

199
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,425
我要上课。
I got a class.

200
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:39,330
如果你需要什么，尽管来找我。
You need anything, you know where to find me.

201
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:41,596
哟,小伙子。那就这样吧。那就这样吧。
Yo, guys. There you go. There you go.

202
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:55,610
的家伙……兰斯·科斯切克警探，52岁。
That's the guy... Detective Lance Koscheck, 52.

203
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:56,809
过去的他。
Past his prime.

204
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,185
看着他。真是悲惨的生活。
Look at him. What a sad fucking life.

205
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,551
没有家人，叫外卖，一个人吃。
No family, orders takeout, eats it alone.

206
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:09,558
我的内线说他和他的搭档今天早上被踢出了这个案子，所以…让我们把她搞定。
My inside guy said that he and his partner got booted off the case this morning, so... Let's get her done.

207
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,269
好吧。
Okay.

208
00:18:57,806 --> 00:18:59,344
嘿,兄弟。
Hey, brother.

209
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:02,512
很抱歉打扰你，但我让你分心了。
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm the distraction.

210
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,943

228
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:11,581
对信任你的人撒谎很容易。
It's easy to lie to someone who trusts you.

229
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:12,846
半真半假不是谎言。

230
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:14,716
你一直这么对自己说。
You keep telling yourself that.

231
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:22,295
我很钦佩你，你知道吗，像你一样花时间在她的墓前。
I admire you, you know, spending time at her grave like you do.

曾经希望我们可以做不同的事情吗?
Ever wish we could have done things differently?

235
00:20:36,806 --> 00:20:38,575
现在又有什么关系呢?
What's it matter now?

236
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:47,848
我训练你来接替我多久了?
How long have I been training you to be my replacement?

237
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,324
美好的两个月。
Two wonderful months.

238
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:54,723
别让阿诺德晃你，好吗?
Don't let Arnold shake you, okay?

239
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,659
我走的时候，你要像我一样。
When I go, just act like me.

240
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,331
假以时日，他会信任你的。
In time, he'll trust you.

241
00:20:58,433 --> 00:20:59,431
我希望。
I hope.

242
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,963
我真的希望这份工作能给我尊重，你知道吗?
I really want the respect that comes with this job, you know?

243
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,505
这他妈的有什么意义?
What's the fucking point?

244
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:12,774
另一个证人呢?
What about the other witness?

245
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:13,940
别担心。
Don't worry about it.

246
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:15,414
这是我的混乱。我来打扫。
It's my mess. I'll clean it up.

247
00:21:15,516 --> 00:21:16,745
你确定吗?
You sure about this?

248
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:19,550
你知道这对阿诺德有多重要。
You know how important this is to Arnold.

249

我想到了几个击球手，所以我们会处理的。
I got a few hitters in mind, so we'll take care of it.

250
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,556

You should go home. It's Alex's day.

251
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:27,855
是的。听着，我很感激。
Yeah. Look, I appreciate that.

252
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:33,861
顺便说一句，你从这份工作中得到的，不是尊重。
By the way, what you get from this job, it ain't respect.

253
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:37,535
是恐惧。
It's fear.

254
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:39,372
它总是恐惧。
It's always fear.

255
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,099
记住这一点。
Remember that.

256
00:23:40,924 --> 00:23:43,122
生日快乐,宝贝。
Happy birthday, baby.

257

It's me! Lanier, stop it!

272
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:36,388
狗屎,拉尼尔?
Shit, Lanier?

273
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,085
Mierda。
Mierda.

274
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:26,779
他妈的。
Fuck.

275
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
是的。有什么事吗?
Yeah. What's up?

276
00:28:54,502 --> 00:28:56,908
我们这里出了点状况。
We have a situation here.

277
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,406
——Ay-yi-yi。-我带走的那三个人都死了。
- Ay-yi-yi. - The three guys I took are dead.

278
00:29:01,178 --> 00:29:03,409
——她还活着。你是认真的吗?
- She's alive. - Are you serious?

279
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:07,281
我知道。我知道。这是他妈的狗屎。
I know. I know. It's fuckin' shit.

280
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:10,922
我们混乱的。
We fucked up.

281
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:13,254
好吧。我叫阿诺。
Okay. I'll call Arnold.

282
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:34,440
阿诺德现在可以见你了。
Arnold will see you now.

283
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:41,480
留下来。他不想见你。
Stay. He don't want to see you.

284
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:54,867
你他妈开什么玩笑?
Are you fucking kidding me?

285
00:29:54,969 --> 00:29:56,363
早上好,先生。
Morning, sir.

286
00:29:56,465 --> 00:29:59,872
你觉得我需要听俄国人说这些废话吗?
You think I need to hear this shit from the Russian?

287
00:29:59,974 --> 00:30:02,941
对不起。我们正在处理这件事。
Sorry. It's being taken care of.

288
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:04,844
一枪爆了这贱人的头。
Put a bullet in this bitch's head.

289
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:06,472
不然我就放你一枪。
Or I'll put one in yours.

290
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:10,608
就像我说的，已经在处理了。
Like I said, it's being taken care of.

291
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,018
我觉得你应该重新考虑一下最后那句话。
And I think you should rethink those last few words.

292
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,121
他们在侮辱我们两个人。
They're insulting to both of us.

293
00:30:18,223 --> 00:30:20,255
是的。好吧。我很抱歉。
Yeah. Alright. I'm sorry.

294
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:22,092
你知道我的嘴。
You know my mouth.

295
00:30:22,194 --> 00:30:24,325
除掉那个警察。
Just get rid of the cop.

296
00:30:24,427 --> 00:30:26,899
它会做的。
It'll be done.

297
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:28,494
不用担心。
No worries.

298
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:33,301
我向你保证。
You have my word.

299
00:30:43,148 --> 00:30:44,917
以后。
Later.

300
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:47,447
我们走吧。
Let's get out of here.

301
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:10,910
耶稣基督!
Jesus Christ!

302
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:12,340
吓死我了，弗林。
Scared the crap out of me, Flynn.

303
00:31:12,442 --> 00:31:15,178
-你好吗?-你好吗?
- How are you? - How are you?

304
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,675
告诉我你知道昨天贝拉斯克斯被杀的事。
Tell me what you know about the Velasquez hit yesterday.

305
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:19,446
——忘记委拉斯开兹。-告诉我你去哪了?
- Forget Velasquez. - Tell me where you been?

306
00:31:19,548 --> 00:31:24,319
我们在你家发现了机枪，三具尸体，还有一堆废黄铜。
We found machine guns, three very deceased John Does, and a stack of spent brass at your house.

307
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:28,092
-三个约翰?-是的。三。
- Three John Does? - Yeah. Three.

308
00:31:28,194 --> 00:31:31,062
草坪上的一个看起来像是被人用绞肉机绞过的。
One on the lawn looked like he'd been put through a meat grinder.

309
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:33,262
没有牙科记录，没有指纹。
No dental records, no prints.

310
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:36,034
在草坪上的是拉尼尔。
Guy on the lawn was Lanier.

311
00:31:36,136 --> 00:31:37,134
哦,胡说。
Oh, bullshit.

312
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:39,466
这是他。
It was him.

313
00:31:39,568 --> 00:31:41,237
你知道吗?
Did you know?

314
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:45,208
-不，不，他妈的不，瓦内萨-你知道吗?
- No, no, fuck no, Vanessa. - Did you know?

315
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,309
-当然不是。-你是他的搭档
- Of course not. - You're his partner.

316
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:49,080
你他妈也有份。
You're fucking in on this, too.

317
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:51,643
我是他的搭档，但我没跟他结婚。
Yeah, I'm his partner, but I'm not married to the guy.

318
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,513
如果他是脏的，那跟我一点关系都没有。
If he's dirty, it's got nothing to do with me.

319
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:57,517
他们有我的家庭住址，戴利。
They had my home address, Daley.

320
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:00,388
我不知道。我发誓。
I didn't know. I swear.

321
00:32:01,424 --> 00:32:04,128
有人收到Koschek的消息吗?
Has anyone heard from Koschek?

322
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,525
不。
No.

323
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,266
听着，你需要进来。对吧?
Look, you need to come in. Alright?

324
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:12,400
队长今天早上大发脾气。
Captain's pitching a shit fit this morning.

325
00:32:12,502 --> 00:32:14,138
她要给你发通缉令了。
She's about to issue a BOLO for you.

326
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,074
我觉得我还是待在外面比较好。
I think I'm better out here for now.

327
00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:20,342
你疯了,现在。看起来……我们就一起进去。
You're crazy, now. Look... we'll just go in together.

328
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:22,179
我们直接坐车去分局就行。
We'll just ride right over to the precinct.

329
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:24,214
听着，你得找到科斯切克。
Listen, you got to find Koschek.

330
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:26,150
把他送到安全的地方。
Put him in a safe house.

331
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:29,384
如果这家伙来找我，他可能也在追杀科舍克。
If this guy came for me, he's probably gunning for Koschek, too.

332
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:31,551
他杀了委拉斯开兹，现在他来找目击者。
He killed Velasquez, now he's coming for the witnesses.

333
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:34,686
那你一定要进来。
Then you definitely need to come in.

334
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,227
我得挂了，戴利。
I got to go, Daley.

335
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:39,097
你要去哪，瓦内萨?
Where you going, Vanessa?

336
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,758
你知道那里对我不安全。
You know it isn't safe for me.

337
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,365
什么叫它不是…凡妮莎!
What do you mean it's not... Vanessa!

338
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,490
是吗?
Yeah?

339
00:33:09,592 --> 00:33:12,229
你终于决定回我电话了，混蛋。
You finally decide to return my call, you fucking asshole.

340
00:33:12,331 --> 00:33:16,101
是你杀了拉尼尔吗?你杀了我的搭档吗?
Did you kill Lanier? Did you kill my partner?

341
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,465
原谅我吗?
Excuse me?

342
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:22,041
不，不，不。我问，你回答。
No, no, no, no. I ask, and you answer.

343
00:33:22,143 --> 00:33:23,735
明白了吗?
Get it?

344
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:25,143
她在哪里呢?
Where is she?

345
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:27,376
她在逃亡。
She's on the run.

346
00:33:27,478 --> 00:33:29,279
现在,倾听。
Now, listen.

347
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:30,808
你的整个计划就是害死好警察。
This whole plan of yours is getting good cops killed.

348
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,613
你要把我弄哭了。
You're going to make me cry.

349
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:35,219
听着，我要出去!
Listen, I want out!

350
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:36,583
-外面没有。-你想退出?
- There's no out here. - You want out?

351
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:42,259
你去给自己买个刀片割破你的肥手腕，你个黑警察。
You go buy yourself a fucking razor blade and cut your fat fucking wrist, you dirty cop.

352
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:45,229
我什么也没听到。
I hear nothing.

353
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:47,198
所以你去找她。
So you find her.

354
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,596
给我一个地址。
Get me an address.

355
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,402
不然我就去拜访你。
Or I'll pay you a visit.

356
00:34:01,346 --> 00:34:03,247
他妈的!他妈的!他妈的!他妈的!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

357
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:08,582
我们肯定低估了她。
We definitely underestimated her.

358
00:34:08,684 --> 00:34:10,518
她是训练有素。
She's well trained.

359
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,587
戴利把她的档案发给我了。
Daley's sending me her file, actually.

360
00:34:13,689 --> 00:34:16,359
他是另一个没解决的问题，你知道吗?
He's another loose end, you know?

361
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:27,172
他对电脑很在行。他很聪明。
He's good with computers. He's smart.

362
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,141
最重要的是，他怕我。
Best thing of all, he's scared of me.

363
00:34:29,243 --> 00:34:30,505
-我是认真的
- Mm. - I'm serious.

364
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:33,508
他吓坏了。我说什么他就做什么。
He's terrified. He'll do anything I say.

365
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,213
现在。
For now.

366
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:43,848
一旦他不再是线人，他就成了幽灵，所以…对了，我们需要有人克隆弗林的手机这样她接电话时我们就能追踪到她。
As soon as he ceases to be an asset, he's a ghost, so... By the way, we need someone to clone Flynn's phone so we can trace her when she answers.

367
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,289
你有别人吗?
You got someone?

368
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:47,819
我不知道，但阿诺德知道。
I don't, but Arnold does.

369
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:50,756
我会给他打电话的。
I'll give him a call.

370
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:52,593
-小姐-好吧
- Miss. - Alright.

371
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,563
喂?
Hello?

372
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,345
沃尔特?
Walter?

373
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:23,381
哦,沃尔特。
Oh, Walter.

374
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:29,750
他妈的。
Fuck.

375
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:42,301
我得跟你谈谈。这很重要。
Hey, I need to talk to you. It's important.

376
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:44,666
我需要你的帮助。
I need your help.

377
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:46,305
当然可以。任何东西。
Of course. Anything.

378
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:48,802
我需要你帮我搞到一个人的信息。
I need you to get me some info on someone.

379
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:51,068
谁是那个幸运的家伙?
Who's the lucky guy?

380
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,312
呃,侦察狙击。
Uh, Scout Sniper.

381
00:37:53,414 --> 00:37:54,808
我想他是本地人。
I think he's local.

382
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,910
拉把椅子过来。看看这是什么。
Pull up a chair here. See what we got here.

383
00:37:58,616 --> 00:38:01,848
在我们的数据库里找不到任何东西。
Can't find anything on our database.

384
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:07,755
-那家伙就是个鬼。-你很幸运，我的数据库是从警局没查到的地方开始。
- Guy's a damn ghost. - Lucky for you, my database starts where the P.D. leaves off.

385
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:15,026
等待。这是他。
Wait. That's him.

386
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:20,669
侦察兵狙击课程让这样的人做一些我们大多数人都难以接受的事情。
Scout Sniper courses takes men like this and teaches them to do things that most of us would find difficult to stomach.

387
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:22,572
有些人就是擅长杀人。
Some men are just good at killing.

388
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:28,710
小维，如果你想让我深入调查，我得知道，我们的紧急程度是多少?
Yo, V, if you want me dig in deeper, I need to know, what's our level of emergency?

389
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:32,978
他昨晚杀了我的搭档和另一名警官。
He killed my partner and another officer last night.

390
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:38,423
我该怎么办?
What can I do?

391
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,821
如果你跑，他会找到你的。
If you run, he'll find you.

392
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:47,861
——这是令人欣慰的。-这是事实。这个,呃…卡洛·加西亚完全是另一个级别的。
- That's comforting. - That's the truth. This, uh... This is Carlo Garcia is in a whole nother league.

393
00:38:47,963 --> 00:38:49,797
你的体重超出了你的水平。
You're fighting out of your weight class.

394
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:51,634
我要揍死这混蛋。
I'm going to put a cap in this fucker.

395
00:38:51,736 --> 00:38:52,833
你会害死自己的。
You're gonna get yourself killed.

396
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:55,374
好吧，我不能跑。
Well, I can't run.

397
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:56,969
我不能战斗。
I can't fight.

398
00:38:57,071 --> 00:39:00,478
他们在局里有内应，所以我不能去自首。
They have someone inside the department, so I can't turn myself in.

399
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,711
看来我没有太多选择。
Doesn't look like I got a lot of options.

400
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:05,010
塑造你的战场，等待他来找你。
Shape your battlefield and wait till he comes for you.

401
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:08,915
这是出乎意料的。所以你要做好准备。
It will be unexpected. So you've got to be ready.

402
00:39:09,017 --> 00:39:10,554
然后呢?
And then?

403
00:39:10,656 --> 00:39:11,852
幸运的话，你会有机会的。
If you're lucky, you'll get your shot.

404
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:17,561
嗯,那是,呃…可怕的建议。
Hm, that's, uh... terrible advice.

405
00:39:17,663 --> 00:39:21,829
我知道，但你不能去追魔鬼。
I know, but you don't go chasing the devil.

406
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:26,702
所以你搞砸了。现在你需要我的帮助。
So you fucked up. Now you need my help.

407
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:28,836
她有手机，我们有她的号码。
She has her cell, and we have her number.

408
00:39:28,938 --> 00:39:35,513
我们只需要有人黑进去，找到她，卡洛，剩下的我来搞定。
All we need is someone to hack into it, track her down, Carlo, and I will take care of the rest.

409
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:37,009
没什么大不了的。
No big deal.

410
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:38,450
这是他的问题。
This is his problem.

411
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:40,452
我知道，但他是我的搭档。
I know, but he's my partner.

412
00:39:40,554 --> 00:39:42,047
只有两个月。
Only for two months.

413
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:44,984
你觉得他会为你做同样的事吗?
You think he'd do the same thing for you?

414
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:46,821
我希望如此。
I would hope so.

415
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:54,059
我想以朋友的身份跟你说几句话。
I want to say something to you, and I mean this as a friend.

416
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:55,929
去吧,开枪。
Go ahead, shoot.

417
00:39:56,031 --> 00:40:00,197
我担心你变得不可靠了。
I'm concerned that you've become unreliable.

418
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:01,902
这几天太难熬了。
It's been a rough couple days.

419
00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:03,970
我们把这烂摊子收拾干净，然后就万事大吉了。
We'll clean this mess up, and then it's clear sailing.

420
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:05,675
没什么大不了的。
No big deal.

421
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:08,612
我想你需要休假。你变老了。
I think you need a vacation. You're getting old.

422
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:15,487
这两种说法都没错，但要对自己诚实。
Yeah, both of those are correct, but be honest with yourself.

423
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:17,016
你最近照镜子了吗?
You looked in the mirror lately?

424
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:20,624
我愿意用我的灵魂换回20岁。
I'd trade my soul to be 20 again.

425
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:24,056
你们俩在瞎扯些什么?
What are you two rambling on about?

426
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:27,994
青春浪费在年轻人身上。
That youth is wasted on the young.

427
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:33,164
不幸的是，经验浪费在那些不花时间享受生活的人身上。
And unfortunate that experience is wasted on those who don't take time to enjoy life.

428
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:35,672
阿诺德，我有很多事要做。我们今晚会回到这里。
Arnold, I have a lot to do. We'll be back here this evening.

429
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:37,905
我们走吧。
Let's go.

430
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:42,140
我打电话给我的人。他会和你保持联系的。
I'll call my guy. He'll be in touch.

431
00:40:42,242 --> 00:40:44,076
对吧?
Alright?

432
00:40:44,178 --> 00:40:46,683
照顾,加布。我们走吧。
Take care, Gabe. Let's go.

433
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:48,883
后来,老板。
Later, boss.

434
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,706
七种语言。
Seven languages.

435
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:12,676
作战行动的丝带。
Combat action ribbon.

436
00:41:12,778 --> 00:41:15,239
枪支的讲师。
Firearms instructor.

437
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,552
侦探服务丝带。警察明星。
Detective Service ribbon. Police star.

438
00:41:20,654 --> 00:41:21,949
天啊。
Geez.

439
00:41:30,927 --> 00:41:33,598
4月2日。
April 2nd.

440
00:41:38,638 --> 00:41:40,869
4月2日。
April 2nd.

441
00:43:35,755 --> 00:43:37,249
我是洛佩斯警官。
This is Officer Lopez.

442
00:43:37,351 --> 00:43:39,889
-我找戴利。-他今天没来。
- I'm looking for Daley. - He hasn't come in today.

443
00:43:39,991 --> 00:43:41,154
我负责他的工作。
I'm covering his desk.

444
00:43:41,256 --> 00:43:45,158
-他在哪里?-女士，这不是…我是弗林警探。我要和他谈谈。
- Where is he? - Ma'am, that's not... This is Detective Flynn. I need to speak with him.

445
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,830
侦探弗林?
Detective Flynn?

446
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:49,096
我奉命奉劝你进来。
I'm under strict orders to advise you to come in.

447
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:52,704
该死的!
Damn it!

448
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:57,709
-很高兴见到你。-很高兴见到你。
- Good to see you. - Oh, nice to see you.

449
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:00,712
如果你们还需要什么，我非常乐意。
If you guys need anything else, I'd be more than happy.

450
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,014
经商还是旅游?
Business or pleasure?

451
00:44:06,116 --> 00:44:07,752
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

452
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,050
你在想什么。
What you're thinking about.

453
00:44:09,152 --> 00:44:12,251
好吧，两者都有一点。
Well, well, a little bit of both.

454
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:13,758
有趣的。
Intriguing.

455
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,959
嗯哼。是的。我在想盖比。
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm thinking about Gabe.

456
00:44:17,962 --> 00:44:19,192
关于他的什么?
What about him?

457
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:21,898
老实说，他正在成为一个累赘。
Honestly, he's becoming a liability.

458
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:25,396
我不想打听你的事。
I don't want to pry into your business.

459
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:27,200
你知道的。
You know that.

460
00:44:27,302 --> 00:44:28,872
但记住，盖比不只是为你工作。
But remember, Gabe doesn't just work for you.

461
00:44:28,974 --> 00:44:31,072
他是你的朋友。
He's your friend.

462
00:44:31,174 --> 00:44:34,174
所以才会这么难。
That's what makes it so hard.

463
00:44:35,947 --> 00:44:37,980
嘿，搞什么鬼?
Hey, what the fuck?

464
00:44:38,082 --> 00:44:39,949
嘿，你们在干什么?
Hey, what are you guys doing?

465
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:58,066
把枪给我。
Give me the fucking gun.

466
00:45:14,018 --> 00:45:16,051
看着我，混蛋。
Look at me, motherfucker.

467
00:45:27,262 --> 00:45:28,833
是吗?有什么事吗?
Yeah? What's up?

468
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,165
盖比，他们打中阿诺德了。
Gabe, they've hit Arnold.

469
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:34,102
——哦。-胳膊中了一枪，但他没事
- Oh. - Took one in the arm, but he's okay.

470
00:45:34,204 --> 00:45:37,204
-谁负责?——拉方丹则。
- Who was on point? - LaFontaine.

471
00:45:37,306 --> 00:45:40,174
阿诺德正在和他的妻子吃晚饭。
Arnold was having dinner with his wife.

472
00:45:40,276 --> 00:45:41,538
他们把她弄得一团糟。
They made a mess of her.

473
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,947
-他们现在在哪里?-城市医疗中心
- Where they at now? - City medical center.

474
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:46,015
二楼。
Second floor.

475
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:02,064
他一直在找你。
He's been asking for you.

476
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:04,396
托米-怎么样?
How's Tomi?

477
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:07,234
她死在了手术台上。
She died on the operating table.

478
00:46:07,336 --> 00:46:10,006
阿诺德会把事情闹大的。
Arnold is going to be raising hell.

479
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:15,011
作为官方律师，我强烈反对这种做法。
As official counsel, I must strongly advise against that course of action.

480
00:46:15,113 --> 00:46:23,888
我们花了这么多年把这事变成了合法生意不能因为一种卑鄙的复仇欲望就放弃这一切。
We spent too many years turning this into a legitimate business to throw it all away over a base desire for revenge.

481
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,353
这么说古希腊人不相信以眼还眼，对吧?
So your ancient Greeks don't believe in an eye for an eye, huh?

482
00:46:27,455 --> 00:46:30,521
事实上，他们称之为必要互惠。
Well, actually, they called it necessary reciprocity.

483
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:41,202
特洛伊战争结束后，奥德修斯回到伊萨卡，发现他的妻子佩内洛普不忠，他杀死了她所有的108名高贵的追求者，
When Odysseus returned to Ithaca after the Trojan War and found that his wife Penelope had been unfaithful, he murdered all 108 of her noble suitors,

484
00:46:41,304 --> 00:46:49,881
然后他屠杀并肢解了自己的仆人因为他们允许这种轻率的行为发生。
and then he slaughtered and mutilated his own servants for allowing the indiscretions to happen.

485
00:46:50,378 --> 00:46:53,852
听起来像一个把战争带回家的人。
Sounds like a man who brought his war home with him then.

486
00:46:53,954 --> 00:46:58,219
他确实。每个人都为此付出了代价。
He did indeed. And everyone paid the price.

487
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,928
所以我离开。
So I'm leaving.

488
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,492
我是否回来取决于阿诺德的行动。
Whether or not I return will depend on Arnold's course of action.

489
00:47:07,594 --> 00:47:11,496
但我对打仗没兴趣。
But I am not interested in fighting a war.

490
00:47:11,598 --> 00:47:17,271
话虽如此，我认为我们不会再见面了。
Having said that, I don't think you and I will be seeing each other again.

491
00:47:17,373 --> 00:47:19,174
我喜欢你，盖比。
I like you, Gabe.

492
00:47:19,276 --> 00:47:21,913
不要陷入逆流。
Don't get caught in the undertow.

493
00:47:34,158 --> 00:47:36,125
他们杀了她。
They killed her.

494
00:47:36,227 --> 00:47:39,491
他们杀了我妻子。
They killed my wife.

495
00:47:39,593 --> 00:47:43,264
——卡洛。——是吗?
- Carlo. - Yes?

496
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:46,597
明确这个房间。马上离开这里。
Clear this room. Get out of here now.

497
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:50,106
——好吧,每一个人。——走吧。照他说的做。
- Alright, everyone. - Let's go. Do as the man says.

498
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:53,241
离开这里，孩子们。不要动。
Get out of here, boys. Don't move.

499
00:47:57,247 --> 00:47:58,543
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

500
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:01,546
——老板……——闭嘴。不要说话。
- Boss... - Shut up. Don't talk.

501
00:48:04,056 --> 00:48:05,957
你看到了吗?
You see that?

502
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:07,926
你他妈都干了些什么?
You see what you fuckin' did?

503
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,559
停止它!
Stop it!

504
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:16,066
给我滚出去。
Get the fuck out of here.

505
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:18,497
走吧!走了。
Go! Go.

506
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:20,631
把门关上!
Close the door!

507
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:22,402
卡洛,留下来。
Carlo, stay.

508
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:26,274
我想让他们受苦。
I want them to suffer.

509
00:48:26,376 --> 00:48:29,145
别担心，宝贝。他们会。
Don't you worry, baby. They will.

510
00:48:29,247 --> 00:48:32,984
首先，你需要休息。
First, you're going to need some rest.

511
00:48:33,086 --> 00:48:36,515
-只要他们还活着就不会。-不会太久的。
- Not if they're still breathing. - They won't be for long.

512
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:43,357
我们上战场，你得想清楚，好吗?
We go to war, we need you thinking clearly, alright?

513
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:45,491
风险太大了。
Stakes are way too high.

514
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:47,262
你是对的。
You're right.

515
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:51,332
你总是对的。
You're always right.

516
00:48:51,434 --> 00:48:53,169
我要在这里待一段时间。
I'm gonna stay here for a while.

517
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:55,732
尽你所能去查。
Go find out what you can.

518
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:57,305
回头见，伙计，好吗?
I'll see you later, man, okay?

519
00:48:57,407 --> 00:48:59,010
谢谢你！
Thank you.

520
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:04,246
我爱她。
I loved her.

521
00:49:04,348 --> 00:49:06,215
她也爱你。
She loved you, too.

522
00:49:07,746 --> 00:49:10,186
对不起,兄弟。
I'm sorry, brother.

523
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:12,386
我真的很爱她。
I really loved her.

524
00:49:12,488 --> 00:49:14,256
我知道。
I know.

525
00:49:19,428 --> 00:49:21,263
哦,他妈的。
Oh, fuck.

526
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:36,371
射手是专业人士。不是这里的人。
Shooters were professionals. Not from around here.

527
00:50:36,473 --> 00:50:38,241
他们用的是什么枪?
What kind of gun they use?

528
00:50:38,343 --> 00:50:43,246
在墨西哥，它被称为cuerno de chivo，因为这本杂志看起来像山羊的角。
In Mexico, it's known as a cuerno de chivo because the magazine looks like a goat's horn.

529
00:50:43,348 --> 00:50:46,711
他们就是喜欢它，他们肯定会用它来表达自己的观点。
They just love it, and they definitely use it to make a statement.

530
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:48,713
要我说，钱都押在哥伦比亚墨西哥人身上了。
If you asked me, the money is on the Colombian Mexican.

531
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:50,847
那就是跟委拉斯开兹有关的人。
Someone tied to Velasquez then.

532
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:53,817
也可能是故意这么看的。
Or made to look that way.

533
00:50:53,919 --> 00:50:56,358
噢,是吗?你猜是谁?
Oh, yeah? Who do you figure?

534
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,591
有弗莱迪的消息吗?
Have we heard from Vlady?

535
00:50:58,693 --> 00:51:01,528
我不知道，老大。他有什么动机?
I don't know, boss. What motive would he have?

536
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,596
我让开。
Me out of the way.

537
00:51:03,698 --> 00:51:05,763
这样事情就简单多了，不是吗?
Makes things a lot easier, doesn't it?

538
00:51:05,865 --> 00:51:08,172
如果我们继续对付弗莱迪，福利特会生气的。
Follett's gonna be pissed if we move on Vlady.

539
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:09,338
这是肯定的。
That's for damn sure.

540
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,603
操他!
Fuck him!

541
00:51:10,705 --> 00:51:12,605
我会搞定那个狗娘养的。

542
00:51:12,707 --> 00:51:15,311
这是我的电话。
It's my call.

543
00:51:15,413 --> 00:51:16,840
你确定吗?
You sure about this?

00:51:16,942 --> 00:51:19,414
你该死的正确。
You're goddamn right.

他们杀了我妻子!

546
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:23,286
我们在说她!
We're talking about her!

Fine. You got it.

548
00:51:28,425 --> 00:51:30,491
它会完成。

549
00:51:39,403 --> 00:51:42,371
这次袭击一定是为了报复委拉斯开兹。
The hit had to be retaliation for Velasquez.

550
00:51:42,473 --> 00:51:44,604
弗莱迪没有动机。

551
00:51:44,706 --> 00:51:48,179
我告诉你，阿诺德疯了。

553
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:52,249
你不会因为生气就打俄罗斯黑帮。
You don't just hit a Russian mobster 'cause you're pissed.

Got a hit on the girl. She's at the Terrace Motel.

557
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:10,168
我想把它藏在前面。
I'm trying to hide it in the front.

558

看起来像个大肥鸡巴，所以我就…我不…我不知道该怎么办。
Looks like a big fat dick, so I just... I don't... I don't know what to do.

559
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:16,471
你怎么把枪和相机藏起来的?
How do you hide a gun with a camera?

560
00:52:18,607 --> 00:52:20,442
你是怎么做到的?
How do you do it?

561
00:52:20,544 --> 00:52:22,939
振作起来,伙计。

那个俄国人怎么样了?
How's the Russian doing?

577

他在那里对每个人大喊大叫，压力太大了。

他们也不让你听大人说话，对吧?
They don't let you listen to the grown-ups talk either, huh?

582
00:53:45,761 --> 00:53:49,333
-这就是不尊重。-是的。
- Disrespectful is what it is. - Yeah.

583

这是信封。
Here is the envelope.

590
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:26,997
听着，弗莱蒂打俄罗斯电话，但我打美国电话因为他英语说得不好。
Listen, Vlady makes his Russian calls, but I make all his American calls on the accountability that he does not speak great English.

591
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:28,702
你在撒谎,伙计。
You're lying, dude.

592
00:54:28,804 --> 00:54:32,068
我不知道，伙计。也许他们互相发过短信。

去做吧。对不起,加布。

这叫做发送信息。

606

-搞定了吗?-你看当地新闻了吗?

607
00:56:57,854 --> 00:57:01,019
-这次没有目击者吗?——没有。

你这态度是怎么回事?

我们无缘无故就捅了马蜂窝。
We just kicked a hornet's nest for no good reason.

- I gave the order. - That's all the reason you need.

613
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:16,672
那个该死的警探是怎么回事?
What's the deal with the fucking detective?

614

反正我得去洗个澡。

620
00:57:33,857 --> 00:57:36,153
我全身都是埃斯特班的血。

675
01:04:02,575 --> 01:04:05,982
如果我们够幸运，他会离我们越远越好。
If we're lucky, he'll put as much distance between us as he can.

676
01:04:06,084 --> 01:04:08,578
我最近运气很好。
I had lots of luck lately.

677
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,085
所有这些都很糟糕。
All of it bad.

678
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:13,253
哦,放松。还能更糟吗?
Oh, relax. How much worse can it get?

679
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:19,930
我有预感我会查出来的。
I've got a feeling I'm gonna find out.

680
01:04:49,456 --> 01:04:51,423
放松。
Relax.

681
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:53,458
坐下来。
Sit down.

682
01:04:54,593 --> 01:04:56,428
我们都可以用这个。
We can both use this.

683
01:05:03,008 --> 01:05:05,371
这是你妻子吗?
Is this your wife?

684
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:07,670
是的。是的。
Yes. Yes.

685
01:05:07,772 --> 01:05:10,145
她通过了。
She passed.

686
01:05:10,247 --> 01:05:11,982
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

687
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:19,616
你没事吧?
You okay?

688
01:05:19,718 --> 01:05:21,585
听着，你为所罗门工作了这么多年。
Look, you've worked for Solomon for years.

689
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:23,653
你可以把我送回旅馆的。
You could have dropped me back at the motel.

690
01:05:23,755 --> 01:05:27,327
现在我们在喝酒。
Now we're having drinks.

691
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:29,527
为什么?
Why?

692
01:05:29,629 --> 01:05:31,969
我向某人许下了承诺。
I made someone a promise.

693
01:05:32,071 --> 01:05:33,300
亚历克斯。
Alex.

694
01:05:33,402 --> 01:05:35,104
她想让我离开这种生活。
She wanted me out of this life.

695
01:05:35,206 --> 01:05:37,073
离开这里，逃到非洲去。
Get away, escape to Africa.

696
01:05:37,175 --> 01:05:39,636
好好利用我的经验，保护大象。
Put my experience to good use, protect the elephants.

697
01:05:39,738 --> 01:05:42,507
打一场精彩的仗。
Fight the good fight.

698
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:45,444
她发现自己得了癌症。
She discovered she had cancer.

699
01:05:45,546 --> 01:05:48,348
她走后，我迷失了方向。
After she was gone, I was lost.

700
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,317
我只剩下阿诺德了。
Arnold was all I had left.

701
01:05:55,324 --> 01:05:57,720
你妻子的事我很遗憾。
I'm sorry about your wife.

702
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:04,001
我很感激你让我活了下来。
And I'm thankful you let me live.

703
01:06:04,663 --> 01:06:07,565
但你还是黑帮战士，我还是警察。
But you're still a mob soldier, and I'm still a cop.

704
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:12,339
恐怕我所做的只是推迟了不可避免的事情。
Yeah, well, I'm afraid all I've done is delayed the inevitable.

705
01:06:12,441 --> 01:06:15,243
我们今晚都可能会死。
We're both probably going to die tonight.

706
01:06:15,345 --> 01:06:17,311
那你的计划是什么?
So what's your plan, then?

707
01:06:17,413 --> 01:06:20,776
怎么，喝一杯，把悲伤淹没，然后等它们来召唤你吗?
What, have a drink, drown your sorrows, and wait for them to come calling?

708
01:06:20,878 --> 01:06:23,581
是的，差不多，是的。
Yeah, well, pretty much, yeah.

709
01:06:23,683 --> 01:06:26,254
我建造了这个地方，设计了它。
I built this place, designed it.

710
01:06:26,356 --> 01:06:28,256
墙壁，家具。
The walls, the furniture.

711
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:31,325
所有东西都加固了，而且防火。
Everything's reinforced and fireproof.

712
01:06:31,427 --> 01:06:34,559
亚历克斯的浴室实际上就是个密室。
And Alex's bathroom is a de facto panic room.

713
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:39,333
这是一个堡垒。
It's a fortress.

714
01:06:39,435 --> 01:06:41,038
你有陷阱吗?
You got booby traps?

715
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,469
我有枪。
I've got guns.

716
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:46,142
——这是吗?-很多枪。
- That's all? - A lot of guns.

717
01:06:46,244 --> 01:06:47,737
我知道怎么用。
And I know how to use them.

718
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:51,345
另外，那些人要来找我。
Plus, those guys are coming to me.

719
01:06:51,447 --> 01:06:54,216
有主场优势。
Got home field advantage.

720
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:56,680
我杀过比这更便宜的人。
I've killed people for a lot less.

721
01:06:56,782 --> 01:07:00,354
是的。你有，是吗?
Yeah. You have, haven't you?

722
01:07:00,456 --> 01:07:02,422
是的,我有。
Yes, I have.

723
01:07:02,524 --> 01:07:05,128
准备迎接客人吧，好吗?
Let's get ready for our guests, shall we?

724
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,394
他们马上就到。
They'll be here soon.

725
01:07:07,496 --> 01:07:12,366
只有被炮弹直接击中才能破坏这个房间。
Nothing short of a direct hit from an artillery round will breach this room.

726
01:07:12,468 --> 01:07:18,768
如果情况不妙，他们会的，锁上门，躺在浴缸里。
If things go south, and they will, lock the door and lay in the tub.

727
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:21,375
躲藏不是我的风格。
Hiding is not my style.

728
01:07:21,477 --> 01:07:24,708
有时这就是生与死的区别。
Sometimes it's a difference between living and dying.

729
01:07:26,547 --> 01:07:29,746
如果出事了，我知道去哪找你。
Well, if shit hits the fan, I know where to find you.

730
01:07:29,848 --> 01:07:31,418
嗯。
Hm.

731
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,123
在浴缸里。
In the tub.

732
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:36,357
适时指出。
Duly noted.

733
01:07:39,593 --> 01:07:42,627
我不知道发生了什么。
I don't know what happened.

734
01:07:42,729 --> 01:07:44,332
我是说，那个该死的警察。
I mean, that fucking cop.

735
01:07:44,434 --> 01:07:48,303
把他们都处理掉。无论付出多大的代价。
Just get rid of them both. Whatever the cost.

736
01:07:48,405 --> 01:07:51,174
都有?
Both?

737
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,406
但他是我的搭档。
But he's my partner.

738
01:07:52,508 --> 01:07:54,540
他是我的老朋友之一。
He's one of my oldest friends.

739
01:07:54,642 --> 01:07:57,411
我别无选择。
I got no choice.

740
01:07:57,513 --> 01:08:00,150
我是说，这值得吗?
I mean, is this even worth it?

741
01:08:00,252 --> 01:08:02,581
适者生存。
Survival of the fittest.

742
01:08:02,683 --> 01:08:10,325
当盖比带我来的时候，我就知道总有一天当你有事情需要处理的时候会找我。
When Gabe brought me on, I knew there'd be a day when I'd be the one you'd call when things needed to be taken care of.

743
01:08:10,427 --> 01:08:12,591
他做出了自己的选择。
He made his choice.

744
01:08:12,693 --> 01:08:14,725
现在你做你的。
Now you make yours.

745
01:08:17,565 --> 01:08:19,334
没问题，老大。
You got it, boss.

746
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:39,651
一群表情严肃的混蛋。
A bunch of serious looking assholes.

747
01:08:39,753 --> 01:08:43,754
还有个长着色情明星胡子的男人。
And a guy with a porn star mustache.

748
01:08:43,856 --> 01:08:45,459
拉方丹则。
LaFontaine.

749
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:46,889
快开门，盖比!
Open the damn door, Gabe!

750
01:08:46,991 --> 01:08:48,363
他危险吗?
He dangerous?

751
01:08:48,465 --> 01:08:51,465
也许可以用更好的除臭剂。
Could use a better deodorant maybe.

752
01:08:51,567 --> 01:08:53,236
来吧。
Come on.

753
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:54,930
我没时间跟你扯淡。
I ain't got time for this horseshit.

754
01:08:55,032 --> 01:08:57,702
没有我的命令，谁都不许行动。
Don't nobody do nothing unless I say.

755
01:09:14,325 --> 01:09:19,262
盖比，我要把那个女警察还给所罗门先生。
Gabe, I'm taking that lady cop back to Mr. Solomon.

756
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,561
不管你同意与否。
With or without your consent.

757
01:09:22,828 --> 01:09:24,762
就这样，是吗?
Just like that, huh?

758
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:27,402
是的。
Yep.

759
01:09:27,504 --> 01:09:29,338
那么，会是什么呢?
So, what's it gonna be?

760
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:33,276
让我理理头绪。
So let me get this straight.

761
01:09:35,709 --> 01:09:40,514
我让你带走她，我就自由了。
I let you take her, I go free.

762
01:09:40,616 --> 01:09:42,681
当然,加布。
Sure, Gabe.

763
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,387
看在过去的份上。
For old times' sake.

764
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:47,290
好吧。
Okay.

765
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:50,359
听起来很划算。
Sounds like a good deal.

766
01:09:50,461 --> 01:09:52,526
看在过去的份上。
For old times' sake.

767
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:11,677
你搞砸了，盖比。
You done fucked up now, Gabe.

768
01:10:11,779 --> 01:10:14,317
也许。
Perhaps.

769
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:21,390
他们需要一段时间重新集结，但他们会回来的。
It'll take them a while to regroup, but they'll be back.

770
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:28,991
你有一段时间过得很好，不是吗?
You had it good for a while, didn't you?

771
01:10:29,093 --> 01:10:31,796
汽车，乡下的大房子。
Cars, big house in the country.

772
01:10:31,898 --> 01:10:34,502
很多钱可以拯救很多大象。
Plenty of money to save lots of elephants.

773
01:10:34,604 --> 01:10:38,033
我猜你妻子不知道这一切的真正来源直到她知道。
I'm guessing your wife never knew where it all really came from until she did.

774
01:10:38,135 --> 01:10:40,310
这时你必须做出承诺。
And that's when you had to make your promise.

775
01:10:40,412 --> 01:10:41,707
嫉妒?
Jealous?

776
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:46,008
我知道我把坏人都抓起来了，所以我睡得很香。
I sleep soundly knowing I put away the bad guys.

777
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:49,880
我想没有比问心无愧更柔软的枕头了。
Well, I guess there's no softer pillow than a clear conscience.

778
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:57,657
有一次，在东区卖冰毒。
One time, a meth dealer on the east side.

779
01:10:57,759 --> 01:11:02,596
我们执行了搜查令，凌晨四点踹开了他的门。
We served a warrant and kicked in his door at 4:00 a.m.

780
01:11:02,698 --> 01:11:06,468
他有三个孩子。女儿。
He had three kids. Daughters.

781
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,470
他让他们做的事。
What he made them do.

782
01:11:08,572 --> 01:11:11,638
父母应该保护他们的孩子。
Parents are supposed to protect their children.

783
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:14,443
我向他逼近。
I drew down on him.

784
01:11:14,545 --> 01:11:17,974
那里的军官不会开口的。
Not an officer there would have talked.

785
01:11:18,076 --> 01:11:21,076
那你最后做了什么?
So, what did you end up doing?

786
01:11:22,585 --> 01:11:26,488
我打电话给CPS逮捕了他。
I called CPS and arrested him.

787
01:11:27,392 --> 01:11:29,458
我相信法律，加布里埃尔。
I believe in the law, Gabriel.

788
01:11:32,991 --> 01:11:36,465
我想这就是为什么你比我优秀。
I guess that's why you're a better person than me.

789
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:38,434
就像我的Alex一样。
Just like my Alex.

790
01:11:42,704 --> 01:11:44,605
我们在等的人，他有多厉害?
The guy we're waiting for, how good is he?

791
01:11:44,707 --> 01:11:47,410
他觉得他跟我一样厉害。
He thinks he's as good as I am.

792
01:11:48,974 --> 01:11:50,039
他是年轻的。
He is younger.



794
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,042
不是很让人放心。
Not very reassuring.

795
01:11:53,144 --> 01:11:55,418
是啊，但这不是命中注定的。
Yeah, well, it wasn't meant to be.

796
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,454
如果他比你强怎么办?
What if he's better than you?

797
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:02,590
洗浴时间。
Bath time.

798
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:06,891
因为下一个就是你。
Because you'll be next.

799
01:13:44,155 --> 01:13:45,990
介意我进来吗?
Mind if I come in?

800
01:13:46,092 --> 01:13:49,499
我让他跟你谈五分钟。
I've asked him for five minutes to talk to you.

801
01:13:49,601 --> 01:13:51,160
你欠我的。
You owe me that.

802
01:13:51,262 --> 01:13:53,701
来吧。
Come on.

803
01:13:56,134 --> 01:13:58,068
我得到了它。
I got it.

804
01:14:34,877 --> 01:14:39,076
有人说这都是女人的错。
Some people claim there's a woman to blame.

805
01:14:40,816 --> 01:14:45,852
但是我知道... ...这是我自己的错。
But I know... ... it's my own damn fault.

806
01:15:06,974 --> 01:15:09,271
惹了很多麻烦，小姐。
Caused a lot of trouble, senorita.

807
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:14,111
你确定要这样吗?
You sure you want this?

808
01:15:14,213 --> 01:15:16,212
木已成舟。
What's done is done.

809
01:15:16,314 --> 01:15:19,688
在那些家伙冲进来之前我们还有五分钟。
We have five minutes before those guys come storming up in here.

810
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:22,790
前特工枪手，SX承包商。
Ex-agency shooters, SX contractors.

811
01:15:22,892 --> 01:15:24,319
你知道的，真正的。
You know, the real deal.

812
01:15:24,421 --> 01:15:29,291
我相信你会标记其中一些，但他们会完成任务的。
I'm sure you'll tag some of them, but they'll get the job done.

813
01:15:35,266 --> 01:15:37,739
你为什么要这么做?
Why are you doing this?

814
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:39,609
她没有人!
She's no one!

815
01:15:41,976 --> 01:15:44,075
伙计，别逼我杀了你。
Man, don't make me kill you.

816
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:49,344
你的假设太多了。
You're assuming a lot.

817
01:15:56,122 --> 01:15:58,859
就像他妈的西部片，对吧?
Like a fucking western, huh?

818
01:15:58,961 --> 01:16:02,764
就像他妈的西部片。
Like a fucking western.

819
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,362
爱死它了。
Love it.

820
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:38,162
我比你年轻多了。
I'm much younger than you.

821
01:16:38,264 --> 01:16:39,999
快得多。
Much faster.

822
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,903
最好还是确定一下。
Better looking for sure.

823
01:16:43,005 --> 01:16:46,038
我是无情的。
I'm ruthless.

824
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,238
我可以瞬间杀了你。
I can kill you in a heartbeat.

825
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:35,252
这是多么的浪费。
What a waste.

826
01:17:43,801 --> 01:17:45,394
它的时间。
It's time.

827
01:18:11,928 --> 01:18:14,192
所罗门给你的钱不够!
Solomon's not paying you enough!

828
01:18:14,294 --> 01:18:17,294
回家!活下去，改日再战。
Go home! Live to fight another day.

829
01:18:17,396 --> 01:18:20,396
你们这些混蛋谁想走，我就亲手杀了你们。
Any of you fuckers want to leave, I'll kill you myself.

830
01:18:20,498 --> 01:18:24,169
我们的任务就是干掉这个混蛋!
Our mission is to take this motherfucker out!

831
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:25,973
你们谁也拿不到钱…
None of you get paid...

832
01:19:11,153 --> 01:19:12,382
我去。
I'll go.

833
01:19:12,484 --> 01:19:13,856
我可以守住车道。
I can cover the driveway.

834
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,352
走吧!去吧!
Go! Go ahead!

835
01:19:15,454 --> 01:19:17,222
走吧!走吧!走吧!
Go! Go! Go!

836
01:19:50,389 --> 01:19:52,059
啊!
Ah!

837
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:07,041
我记得你说过这房子是坚不可摧的。
I thought you said this house was impenetrable.

838
01:20:07,143 --> 01:20:08,537
嗯，我也这么认为。
Well, I thought so, too.

839
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,508
我是个合同工杀手，不是合同工?
I'm a contractor killer, not a contract builder, okay?

840
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:22,991
这看起来不太好。
This doesn't look good.

841
01:20:24,522 --> 01:20:27,325
来吧!现在就拿出来!
Come on! Take that out now!

842
01:20:29,164 --> 01:20:31,296
我该出去透透气了。
Time for me to get some fresh air.

843
01:20:37,172 --> 01:20:39,106
洗浴时间。
Bath time.

844
01:20:40,703 --> 01:20:42,439
那就这样吧。
There you go.

845
01:20:43,211 --> 01:20:45,607
保持水分。
Stay hydrated.

846
01:22:40,559 --> 01:22:43,329
——在这里!-在卡车后面。
- Over here! - Behind the truck.

847
01:23:29,377 --> 01:23:31,113
啊!
Aaah!

848
01:24:25,763 --> 01:24:27,565
耶稣基督。
Jesus Christ.

849
01:24:29,701 --> 01:24:35,309
为我工作的人一定有暴力倾向。
Men that work for me must be capable of violence.

850
01:24:35,872 --> 01:24:41,117
同时也要明白威胁的威力。
And also understand the power of a well-placed threat.

851
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:42,712
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

852
01:24:44,683 --> 01:24:45,682
海军陆战队吗?
Marine Corps?

853
01:24:45,784 --> 01:24:47,783
海军。海豹突击队4。
Navy. SEAL Team 4.

854
01:24:47,885 --> 01:24:49,752
我需要新的枪手。
I need new shooters.

855
01:24:49,854 --> 01:24:52,194
我的上一个男人已经离开了。
My last guy moved on.

856
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:53,789
不会让你失望的。
Won't let you down.

857
01:24:59,566 --> 01:25:01,665
这是路易斯·委拉斯开兹的。
This is for Luis Velasquez.

858
01:25:37,835 --> 01:25:39,604
帮我个忙。
Do me a favor.

859
01:25:41,608 --> 01:25:43,806
帮我处理好这件事。
Take care of this for me.

860
01:25:47,746 --> 01:25:50,417
当然，我会的。
Sure, I'll do that.

861
01:25:51,651 --> 01:25:53,321
嘿。
Hey.

862
01:25:53,423 --> 01:25:54,916
我支持你。
I got your back.

863
01:26:47,938 --> 01:26:49,773
你好的,加布?
You alright, Gabe?

864
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,909
是的，伙计，我很好。
Yeah, man, I'm good.

865
01:27:20,037 --> 01:27:22,476
——你明白吗?-很好，很好。
- You okay? - All good, all good.

866
01:27:22,578 --> 01:27:24,808
来吧,伙计们。让我们完成它。
