1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,750
滨口龙介短片集“偶然与想象”

2
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:38,083
第 1 集：魔法 （缥缈之物）

3
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:06,583
漂亮

4
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,958
睫毛反射着阳光 好好看

5
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,708
戴帽子 试试看

6
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,500
- 这里有东西 - 谢谢

7
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:38,625
好 我先看一下效果

8
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,500
请稍等一会

9
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,875
- 好的 - 是的

10
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,833
- 很不错 - 是的

11
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:58,708
- 我很满意 你们觉得呢 - 我也觉得很不错

12
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,500
- 好 - 大伙辛苦了

13
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,208
太好了 我们完成了

14
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:17,375
- 谢谢你 再见 - 路上小心

15
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,708
- 跟我车一块走呗 - 可以吗？

16
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,750
- 回头见 - 回头见

17
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:31,208
- 路上小心 - 谢谢 再见

18
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,000
什么

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,375
你才刚认识他怎么就相处得这么好

20
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:57,125
嗯 在某个点 他说

21
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,458
“久 你和想象中不一样 ”

22
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,750
“久”？

23
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,125
酒吧老板帮我们起的昵称

24
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:10,250
“久”就是久津谷米 “嘉”就是嘉和明介

25
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:17,333
我就问他一开始对我的印象

26
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,708
他说第一次见我就觉得我很漂亮

27
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,458
- 是是是... - 懂的 懂的...

28
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:27,375
但在这之前他以为我很高冷

29
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,250
因为在我们之前都是用电邮交流

30
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:35,208
就平常工作沟通交流

31
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:38,125
但你也知道 其实现实中我很热情

32
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:42,500
所以 他就一副“哇 这反差让我大吃一惊”的样子

33
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:49,375
然后我说 “等等 你真的很会说话”

34
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,250
老实说 他看起来像个海王

35
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,875
- 海王 - 嗯 但不完全是

36
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,125
应该说 他是个懂王

37
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:02,458
- 懂王与海王不同啦 - 我是说...

38
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,708
他有时会像个女人一样懂我

39
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,250
不过这也没什么

40
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:11,500
他说他的公司在青山

41
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,000
要知道那儿就是海王们的老巢

42
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,083
啊 我还是不明白（为什么说他是海王）

43
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:18,000
他是做什么的？

44
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:21,750
他主管一家室内设计公司还有做一些投资

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,750
现在他听起来……确实像是个海王

46
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,500
真的吗 谷米 你不是不喜欢海王吗？

47
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,250
我知道 但我惊讶地发现他的为人竟如此有趣

48
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:38,500
我懂了

49
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:44,000
最后我们的商业合作没谈下来

50
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,208
但我们就这么聊着天 不知不觉就过去了两个小时

51
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:54,250
然后话题从“喝咖啡吗？” 聊到了“喝一杯？”

52
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,250
连末班车都错过了

53
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:00,125
真可怕 你们呆了多长时间？

54
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:04,125
会议从下午 1 点开始 一共 15 个小时

55
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,875
- 这么久 - 是吧

56
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:10,708
不知怎的 我们聊起了我们的童年

57
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:16,000
我们发现我们有着相似的成长经历 并且经常搬家

58
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:22,250
我们很快意识到这就是我俩这么自来熟的原因

59
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:28,375
我还跟他说了一些我从未告诉过别人的事儿

60
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:32,583
甚至跟你也没说过的事 美子 他也这样做了

61
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,583
也许他是在跟我套近乎

62
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:38,708
但...

63
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:44,750
我能感觉到 我正触摸着 他内心的深处……

64
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:50,125
我觉得 他也正触摸着 我内心的深处

65
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,458
这听起来……好色

66
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,708
不会吧

67
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:01,083
老实说 我也觉得很色

68
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:06,958
我都不知道原来谈话可以这么色

69
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,208
- 你们相互说秽语了吗？- 没有

70
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:12,333
没有秽语 也没有身体接触

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,708
怎么可能？

72
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:20,875
但我们是通过谈话在抚摸着彼此

73
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,750
啊 太色了

74
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,208
我们最后聊起了我们作为夫妻的假设

75
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,750
- 你们陷入爱河了 - 应该是吧

76
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:35,375
我们都感觉到 正慢慢地陷入对方的爱河

77
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:39,833
至少我们相处得很融洽

78
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,708
说着说着 我们都以为我们要做爱了

79
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:46,750
不会很肉麻吗？

80
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,500
不会 我们的谈话自然而然地朝着那个方向发展

81
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,000
你太成熟了

82
00:06:54,292 --> 00:07:00,500
但我们都表现得 “不 不是今天” 所以 我们相互道别 打车回家

83
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,000
什么 居然没做

84
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,333
- 不不不不

85
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,625
第一次约会就做爱很常见吗？

86
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:12,625
不知道 但你跟他 我觉得会

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,125
嗯 说的也是

88
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,375
你呢 美子 你会不会...

89
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,000
你是指

90
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:23,000
第一次约会就做爱

91
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,500
不 不会第一次约会就做

92
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,250
第二次或者第三次

93
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:30,208
对 差不多

94
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,833
- 你没试过前三次约会就上床吗？- 没有

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,500
我接受不了 这对我来说太快了

96
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,500
大多数人第三次时就会做

97
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,583
我知道 所以 我把他们归类为 海王

98
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,375
谷米 你真的很严格

99
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:48,625
- 你跟我在这一点上就很不同 - 是呢

100
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,708
老实说...

101
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,583
这也不是什么坏事

102
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,500
第一次约会 我从来没觉得我会做

103
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,125
但其实我很想

104
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:08,125
我很想知道我们做了之后会是什么样子

105
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,625
如果真的那么顺理成章...

106
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:15,250
我想过后果 觉得有点不太确定

107
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:19,125
但我有意无意地给了他暗示

108
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,083
什么样的暗示

109
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,875
不告诉你 我才不要

110
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:26,375
- 喂 快说嘛 - 就在那一瞬间发生了

111
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:34,625
但是……他退缩了

112
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,583
他硬不起来？

113
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,750


114
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,125
简而言之

115
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:48,000
他在精神上接受不了

116
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,375
他说...

117
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,833
他和前任分手是因为他被绿了

118
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,500
啊……听起来很耳熟……

119
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,833
可不是吗 你也绿过别人 快道歉

120
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,500
愿主宽恕我的罪过

121
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:10,875
你知道吗 他被前任骗了还不止一次

122
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,125
嗯...

123
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:16,875
但他还是深爱着她  所以

124
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,375
这太痛苦了 他可能没办法再爱了

125
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,375
什么时候的事？

126
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,500
大概两年前

127
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,833
- 他伤得也太久了吧 - 我知道 但

128
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,625
对此我也深有同感

129
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,125
我懂的

130
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:40,375
他还说和我相处得很开心 但感觉没有准备好

131
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,375
发自内心的自白

132
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,500
这让他兴奋 但

133
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:52,000
这也让他意识到他害怕坠入爱河

134
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:57,333
他说我让他想起了他的前任

135
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:00,000
- 你长得像她吗？ - 没有

136
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,958
外貌和性格都不像

137
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,750
但他说他从未试过...

138
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,833
和别人聊天聊得这么安心

139
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,125
他这才想起来 他从来都没有和他前任这样谈过心

140
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,833
嗯……谈心……

141
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:24,625
对 它勾起了我的思绪 接着我说

142
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,083
安心不等于浪漫

143
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,083
他怎么说？

144
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,000
“久 你觉得呢？”

145
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,208
啊 还欲擒故纵

146
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,500
很难解释其中的细微差别

147
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:47,625
我们一起度过了一段非常奇妙的时光

148
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:53,208
我俩都觉得是一段前所未有的经历

149
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:59,083
他说 “对于我们这种总是让别人望而却步的人来说”

150
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,625
“我们走过的路都是很特别的”

151
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:06,000
看得出来他是很认真地在讲这话

152
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:14,500
然后 他建议我们就此打住 各回各家

153
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,875
他说 “如果下次见面 我们的魔法消失了 那就随它去吧”

154
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,208
魔法

155
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:26,000
这个词用来形容我们真的恰到好处

156
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,375
他说 “坦白讲 我度过了一生中最美好的一天”

157
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:36,000
“如果我们的下一次见面感觉更好 那就再好不过了”

158
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:40,625
“希望如此 必然如此”

159
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,750
然后我们就握手告别了

160
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:43,958
这么严肃

161
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,375
你害怕下一次见面吗？

162
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,208
我……非常害怕

163
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,375
而我又很想见到他 立刻马上

164
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,625
谷米你看起来真好

165
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
闪闪发光

166
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:13,750
谢谢

167
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,250
- 谢谢 - 谢谢

168
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,000
非常感谢

169
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,583
- 晚安 - 再见

170
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,125
不好意思

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,708
您介意原路返回吗？

172
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:29,458
社长在吗？

173
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,500
- 什么- 我可以进来吗？

174
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,250
你是

175
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,750
我是他的朋友

176
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,375
打扰了

177
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,500
什么事？

178
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,708
我有些话想跟你说

179
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:49,000
森田小姐 你可以先走了

180
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,583
但...

181
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,958
没事儿 剩下的我来做就行

182
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,083
是

183
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,625
- 晚安 - 晚安

184
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:11,958
晚安

185
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,500
真可爱

186
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:25,250
什么

187
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,500
你搬了工作室啊

188
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,250
旧的也很可爱

189
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,250
你的床放哪？

190
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,625
楼上

191
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,250
喔这样啊

192
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,708
你看起来混得不错嘛

193
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,250
你想说什么呢？

194
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:50,000
我听说你开始做投资了

195
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,250
你能行吗？ 我从来想过你还会投资

196
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,083
谁告诉你的？

197
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,250
你们俩一起度过了一段奇妙的时光啊

198
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,333
“久”还有“嘉”

199
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:08,625
你俩真可笑

200
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,750
你认识她？

201
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,000
你是说 谷米

202
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,625
我好闺蜜

203
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:17,958
谷米？

204
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:22,875
没错 我们今天还拍了照

205
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,708
惊喜吗？

206
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:35,875
惊喜 难以置信

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,875
有什么难以置信的

208
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,875
她跟你提起过我

209
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,625
也没有指名道姓说的就是你

210
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,583
是我自己意识到她说的是你

211
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,375
你告诉她我俩的事了

212
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,375
不 我没有 我怎么可能会说

213
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:52,750
也是

214
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,625
你爱上谷米了吗？

215
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,000
- 我还不知道 - 什么叫你还不知道

216
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:04,875
“奇妙的时光”

217
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,250
“一生中最美好的一天”

218
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,250
喂 能别说了吗？

219
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,750
你以为我吃醋了

220
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,583
- 你没有吗？ - 一点也没有

221
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,125
我一点也不爱你了 嘉和

222
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,458
你几乎都没有在我的脑海里停留过

223
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:21,958
可不吗

224
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,875
你把自己伪装成

225
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:29,125
一个因被绿而重伤过的人

226
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,958
这她也说了吗？

227
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,000
没有 有一些是我猜的

228
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,500
那天晚上你到底要追随哪个人

229
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
“那晚”

230
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:50,000
你走吧 你表现得像个跟踪狂 你疯了

231
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:52,375
放心

232
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:55,875
我知道我很疯

233
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,000
但你变现得很正常

234
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,125
- 你很了解我嘛 - 你到底干嘛来了

235
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,125
你想知道

236
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,208
想 我有点害怕

237
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,625
实话说 我自己也不知道

238
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,250
哈？

239
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:18,125
可我又没有人可以听我讲这事

240
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,250
谷米当然也不行

241
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:25,333
但我知道你会愿意听我叨叨 尽管已经过去了两年

242
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,958
- 你最近好吗？- 听什么啊？

243
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,500
我不知道

244
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,833
但你曾经就很喜欢听我瞎叨叨

245
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,125
你最近好吗？

246
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,458
你想知道什么？

247
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:53,250
听到你和她的事 我很生气

248
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,875
也觉得很难过

249
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,625
但我现在不爱你了

250
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,208
- 而你... - 打住

251
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:05,625
也许是因为失去了本认为只属于我的人

252
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,583
我可不属于你的

253
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,208
我说的是谷米

254
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:13,250
听着 女人 那女孩也不属于你的

255
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,333
你为什么叫我“女人”？

256
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:19,250
你从来没有对我说过这样的话

257
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,500
你要再说一遍 我可走了

258
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:25,208
女人 走吧

259
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:33,458
还有 我不喜欢你把谷米说成是“那女孩”

260
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:38,958
- 久津小姐不属于你 - 你想要什么？

261
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,000
我还不知道

262
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,083
下次见面你要睡她吗？

263
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,125
这与你无关

264
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,375
你正处于一段普通而又无聊的关系中

265
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,875
你在说什么啊

266
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,500
你会为那迷人的第一次约会而哭泣......

267
00:19:58,667 --> 00:19:59,750
你在咒我吗？

268
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,875
- 也许 - 我他妈的

269
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,708
你在生我气

270
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,125
我不确定我是不是在生你的气

271
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,458
但也许我就是

272
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,583
那你在生谷米的气

273
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,708
- 久又没错- 不要叫她久

274
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:20,458
好吧

275
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,625
如果我生气了 那可能是因为我们的周遭吧

276
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:25,583
周遭？

277
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,250
我们的周遭并不是某个人的错

278
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:33,750
如果这里边有人犯贱 那个人就是你

279
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,375
凭什么 就因为我绿了你

280
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,625
你不仅犯贱 而且...

281
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,125
而且什么

282
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,125
理由还令人恶心

283
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,083
你只是想和一个有钱人上床

284
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,250
也对喔 我就是这么说的

285
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,333
你很婊

286
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,833
没错 但那都是因为你一直在试探

287
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,458
我还没准备好 你就一直强迫我

288
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,625
- 话说的咄咄逼人 - 事实呢？

289
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,125
性挫折

290
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,458
还有性好奇

291
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:13,750
你可以说我犯贱

292
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:17,500
但你都满足不了我 怎么说？

293
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:22,500
- 我可不是你的假阳具 - 假阳具都比你强 只干不语

294
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,958
干嘛啊 吓到我了

295
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,833
- 那是你的吗？ - 快滚

296
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,375
我可能会失控杀死你

297
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,500
那你就再也见不到久了

298
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,125
- 你要去哪里？ - 松手 你不走我走

299
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:43,375
- 可你就住在这 - 滚开

300
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,125
- 又想逃跑- 没错

301
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:47,375
你为什么老是伤害我？

302
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,625
不知道 可能这就是爱吧

303
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:55,708
那时我还小 伤害了我喜欢的男孩

304
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:58,875
打住啊 我再也不会上你的当了

305
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,625
我爱你（此处女主用了强调语气表示不确定）

306
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,708
- 但我很怀疑 - 我他妈

307
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,750
这不是挺有趣的吗？

308
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:10,500
- 一点也不 - 我们的吵得有声有色

309
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,250
就和过往一样

310
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,333
你只是因为失去了你认为本属于你的男人所以生气

311
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,583
你只是在重复我说的话罢了

312
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,875
你总逼着我让我一直爱你

313
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,583
即便我们分手了 即使你不爱我了

314
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,583
嗯 也许吧

315
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,375
嗯 你走吧

316
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:35,000
我们不能重归于好了 至少 我不能

317
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,208
明白了 但为什么呢？

318
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,750
我受不了你

319
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:42,000
但“你深爱着我”啊

320
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,333
我从谷米那听说的

321
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,625
你沦陷了

322
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,958
但是嘉和 我敢打赌你肯定想不到......

323
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:00,958
什么？

324
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:07,750
我因为伤害了你 而受到了苦痛至深的伤害

325
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:17,083
不 不 不 等一下

326
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:18,833
你想得可简单

327
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:21,625
我绷不住了 我爱你

328
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,250
我一直还爱着你

329
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,333
谷米呢？

330
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,750
我告诉过你了 我还不知道

331
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:35,125
我对她 感情不一样

332
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:40,125
如果你抱了我 久津谷米就会消失 你还会抱吗？

333
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,500
我不敢保证 你会成为我的唯一

334
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,750
你可能会丢了夫人又折兵

335
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,500
我什么都不敢保证

336
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,833
我就是这样的人 你能接受我吗

337
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,833
我要吐了

338
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,833
你是一直爱着我吗 由始至终

339
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,000
我也想知道...

340
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,625
- 你刚就是这么说的 - 一时冲动罢了

341
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:17,125
真心话有时就是一时冲动说出来的

342
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,750
我也是一时冲动来到这里的

343
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,208
真不真心也不关你事了

344
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,208
你真的这么觉得吗？

345
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,750
至少 我什么都不敢保证

346
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,958
嗯 因为我不知道

347
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:38,250
- 你到底来这干嘛 - 你确定你真的是你自己吗

348
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:45,750
因为你不是 所以你对谷米三心二意

349
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:53,000
我真的很喜欢谷米

350
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,250
她太好了

351
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,083
我觉得你俩很般配

352
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,250
但她是个工作狂

353
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,250
也很顽固

354
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,333
我不也是吗？

355
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:12,000
你和谷米很像

356
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,500
说的也是

357
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:17,875
也真的如此

358
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,875
你喜欢我什么

359
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,333
至少你很坦诚

360
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:33,750
嗯 我是

361
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:39,625
你是一个值得信赖的人 美子

362
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,583
但我骗了你

363
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,875
那是骗吗

364
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,958
我很努力不把自己视作为你的唯一

365
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:53,375
这样你难免会受伤

366
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,625
你能不提这茬了吗？

367
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,083
你有没有试过 哪怕一次 以真面目对我

368
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,833
我试着去理解你

369
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,208
我尽量啥事都听你的

370
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,000
回答我的问题

371
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,500
什么叫 以真面目？

372
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:22,500
如果你还不懂 你和谷米还是会重蹈覆辙

373
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,208
到最后还是会伤害到她

374
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,500
你受伤了吗？

375
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,000
嗯

376
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,125
为什么？

377
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:40,833
一直以来我能做的只有一次又一次地伤害着我爱的人

378
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:45,500
爱情应该是让人快乐的

379
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,250
我俩有过快乐的时光

380
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,333
我感觉自己就像是一个残缺品

381
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,458
我也一样

382
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,833
我也不是你的完美假阳具

383
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,625
因为你太温柔了...

384
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,333
你不适合我

385
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,375
- 你和谷米会是郎才女姿的一对 - 我知道

386
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:27,708
嘉和

387
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,958
你相信会有……

388
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:36,875
比魔法更缥缈的东西吗？

389
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:59,958
对不起 我忘了带笔记本电脑

390
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,583
她就是你说得你心里的那个人吗？

391
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,750
不 她不是

392
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,000
那你为什么还要追她？

393
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,000
追上去不好吗？

394
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,625
当然不好

395
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:52,208
三天后...

396
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:13,000
谷米 有发生什么好事吗？

397
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,208
怎么这么说？

398
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,500
你看起来特别漂亮

399
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:19,708
什么？

400
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:25,083
我之前跟你说过的那个人今晚约我出去

401
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,583
他想和我见面聊聊天

402
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,125
原来如此

403
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,833
不会吧？

404
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,750
就是他

405
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,625
- 那我先走 - 别呀

406
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:56,750
我想听听你的看法

407
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,625
这边这边

408
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,875
太巧了 抱歉叫住你了

409
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:11,333
对了 这是我的朋友 美子 这是嘉和先生

410
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,458
不好意思 我已经跟她说了关于你的事了

411
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:23,750
你决定好了吗？

412
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,000
什么？

413
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,125
你选谁？ 嘉和

414
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:34,750
对不起 谷米

415
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,750
我是他的前女友

416
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:42,625
可怕的巧合 不是吗 造化弄人

417
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:51,125
在车上和你聊完之后我就去见他了

418
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
两年的时间仿佛一下子湮灭了

419
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,625
魔法一般

420
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,333
然后 我想明白了……

421
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,875
我爱你 嘉和

422
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,625
一心一意的

423
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,500
我想要的只有你

424
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,958
我无法想象没有你的人生

425
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:25,875
我意识到你与谷米的相遇是对我们来说也如魔法一般

426
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:32,583
你一定也意识到了这点

427
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,375
这是我朋友 美子

428
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,958
这是嘉和先生

429
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,500
不好意思 我已经跟她说了关于你的事了

430
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,250
我先走了

431
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,708
哈 别呀

432
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,250
哎呀 我懂的

433
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,875
这个麻烦你们了

434
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,750
很般配

435
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,250
哎呀 打住

436
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:16,125
我来买单吧

437
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:17,625
不不不不用

438
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:21,500
让我来吧 然后我们去个地方

439
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,083
嗯 什么地方？

440
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:54,083
第 2 集：把门打开

441
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,125
写完后 请贴在窗户上

442
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:15,875
现在来看下 是什么导致一个人感到疏远

443
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,250
大家自由讨论

444
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:22,833
就像人们使用敬语一样

445
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:33,458
拜托了

446
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:38,750
求求你

447
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,125
起来

448
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,500
我的未来全靠您了

449
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,583
这对我找工作有很大影响

450
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,500
我不在乎

451
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:56,875
佐佐木

452
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,625
求你了 你为什么不肯帮我？

453
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,208
你真不害臊

454
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,750
额 打扰了 濑川教授

455
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:09,875
把门打开

456
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:12,833
看起来这里有些困扰

457
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:17,375
关上门更是如此 请把门打开

458
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,875
这没什么好看的

459
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:27,125
散了散了 继续讨论

460
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,625
先起来吧

461
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,333
五个月后...

462
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
你迟到了

463
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:58,375
抱歉 耽误了些时间 课后我有问题要问老师

464
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,375
喂

465
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:25,958
年轻气盛

466
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:44,708
怎么都穿好了

467
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,375
我得去接孩子了

468
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,750
- 还有时间 - 你都洗澡了

469
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:54,000
我可以洗一整天的冷水澡

470
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,875
夏季研讨会之旅

471
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:08,458
嗯

472
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,875
我被耽搁了一年 我为什么要去？

473
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:15,958
至少你被邀请了 不像我

474
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:22,000
我都忘了他们把你踢出群聊了 对不起

475
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:25,000
呀 可伤心了

476
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,875
不过这也挺好

477
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:32,375
你还会在乎你的话会伤害我

478
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:34,500
他们会在乎吗？

479
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:38,833
管他呢

480
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:42,750
我可不想惹人讨厌

481
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:47,250
- 也许是我的错... - 当然是你的错

482
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:51,625
你不愿随波逐流 所以竖起了一堵墙

483
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,708
一堵墙 我

484
00:39:56,042 --> 00:40:00,375
每个人都说感觉你瞧不起他们一样

485
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:01,750
谁

486
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:03,583
每个人

487
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:04,750
每个人

488
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:06,333
没错 每个人

489
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:15,000
我再也不会有拥有种校园生活了

490
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,958
我是唯一的那个...

491
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:25,375
熬过来了 谢天谢地

492
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:30,458
想想我当初鼓起勇气重返大学......

493
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,500
你还有我

494
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:36,000
我在别处也可以找到有好处的朋友

495
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
就是这样

496
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,000
什么

497
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:48,125
这就是你没有在女生群里的原因

498
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,000
女生群……

499
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:56,500
我在佳奈那里听说了 她还在笑

500
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:01,208
抱歉 我也觉得很好笑

501
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,833
奇怪……我感觉我快哭了

502
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,250
哭吧哭吧

503
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:22,875
这么隆重

504
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:26,625
濑川教授拿奖了 太厉害了

505
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,875
厉害个屁

506
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,375
这是个极赋盛誉的奖

507
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,125
我写不了二十多年

508
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:43,333
但我可以从头到尾毫不犹豫地写完这部小说

509
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,708
我其实现在就带着他的书

510
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,708
你买了吗？

511
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,125
我希望你可以读一读

512
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:55,958
我才不要

513
00:41:56,125 --> 00:42:01,375
因其清新的文笔和精巧妙的故事结构而备受称赞

514
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:04,500
这新闻本该是介绍我的

515
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:07,458
所以说您是他以前的学生

516
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:13,125
没错 说来羞愧 我知道我给他带去了不少麻烦

517
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:15,125
他是怎样的老师呢？

518
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,125
非常严格 只可惜我不是他最得意的学生

519
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,250
喂

520
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,750
读读这里

521
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:31,125
喂

522
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:42,250
要毕业法语肯定不能挂 要怪就怪你自己

523
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,625
本来荒木老师都说好让我随便考考就算过了
但中途她不得不回家待产去了

524
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,250
还有这事

525
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:55,250
- 我倒挺庆幸你没得到这份工作 - 为什么？

526
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:56,833
只是单纯觉得

527
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,375
好吧 反正也没有人会雇用我

528
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,750
连地方站的都没有

529
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:14,375
卧槽 他好变态啊

530
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,458
看起来濑川教授整个人饥渴到干枯了

531
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:24,875
可我却很开心 甚至有点兴奋

532
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:27,625
真的吗？

533
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,500
我有一个想法

534
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:39,125
什么？

535
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:40,750
美人计

536
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:44,750
用美人计对付教授？

537
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:48,458
没错 你得帮帮我 奈绪

538
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:49,875
为什么？

539
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:56,583
他毁了我的未来 我要以牙还牙

540
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,750
真很公平对吧

541
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:04,083
我才不要 我挺喜欢他的

542
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,375
你认真的吗？

543
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:10,000
比和我做爱更喜欢？

544
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,875
你在说什么？

545
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:20,083
没有帮助 没有性 那就到此为止吧

546
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:21,458
什么啊？

547
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,875
在学校里我也不会鸟你

548
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:30,500
- 不如现在就不鸟我 - 小心我把你扔出去

549
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,375
可怜的小狼狗

550
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,375
帮帮我嘛

551
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:47,583
我只能拜托你了

552
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:50,458
我想一直和你做

553
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:52,875
别给我整这套

554
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:07,083
我们的身体完美契合

555
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,875
所以 拜托你了

556
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:14,625
- 我得走了 - 求求你了

557
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:17,000
让我好受一些

558
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:21,875
停下来

559
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:31,458
哦 是村山小姐呀

560
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,833
你记得我？

561
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:39,125
当然了 有何贵干

562
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:47,125
额 恭喜教授夺得了芥川奖

563
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:50,500
谢谢

564
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:54,750
可以麻烦你帮我签个名吗？

565
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:57,083
行 没问题

566
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,625
我真的很喜欢这本书

567
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:03,375
谢谢 进来吧

568
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:10,250
不还意思 请把门打开

569
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,500
哦好的 抱歉

570
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,958
没事

571
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:32,833
您可以在这里签名吗？

572
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,208
不在封面签吗？

573
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:41,583
我真的太喜欢您在这里描绘的画面了

574
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:46,750
如果能每次读到这里还可以看到您的签名那真的太幸福了

575
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:49,958
不可以吗？

576
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,750
不是 当然可以

577
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:14,250
非常感谢

578
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:18,250
没有没有 我该谢谢您才是

579
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:20,250
太好了

580
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:26,458
真的很高兴教授能拿奖

581
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:31,000
大一和大二我都有上您的法语课

582
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:33,250
对对 我还记得

583
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,250
转眼一年多了...

584
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,000
宛如昨日

585
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:41,625
嗯 你很突出

586
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:48,083
也是呢 我年龄比其他同学大很多

587
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,250
不 不是因为这个

588
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,458
你课上课后问了许多问题

589
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:58,125
对 就是我了

590
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:02,708
我由衷喜欢老师的课

591
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:06,833
您为人透彻 笔下的法语也很优美

592
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,750
您过奖了

593
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:16,583
嗯 如果您有时间 而且不介意的话……

594
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,125
您说

595
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:22,875
我可以问问您书里的一些问题吗？

596
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:26,250
噢 没问题

597
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:29,125
您现在有别的事需要忙吗？

598
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,375
没有 我有空

599
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:38,375
- 亦或者我请您到咖啡馆去 - 不用 在这就挺好

600
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,000
我来沏茶

601
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:45,375
- 不必劳烦- 没关系

602
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,250
请坐

603
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:51,875
对了你现在几年级了？

604
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:56,583
大四了 岁月如梭

605
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,125
你后续打算工作吗？

606
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,250
还没想好

607
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:06,875
- 我可能会成为一名家庭主妇 - 所以你结婚了

608
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,125
对 我还有个女儿

609
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:14,125
重返学校一定很困难吧

610
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,500
还好 我想学一下心理学

611
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:21,250
请 这茶很是解渴

612
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:23,708
谢谢

613
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:31,250
研究生是不可能了 我没办法完成

614
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,208
这样呀

615
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:38,000
别只说我了 我想听听关于教授的事

616
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:43,750
- 但我不知道该问什么... - 什么都可以

617
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:51,708
教授成家了吗？ 您结婚了吗？

618
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,125
没 单身

619
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,500
抱歉 您指的是关于您书里一切都可以问

620
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,708
我确实想起了些问题

621
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:11,375
就是您签名那页里的场景...

622
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:16,500
真的非常迷人

623
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:25,833
“我用手背挺直了身子”

624
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:30,958
“这样 她给我刮毛的时候就不碍事了”

625
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:38,208
“她待我的睾丸如待一只折了翅的鸟儿”

626
00:51:40,042 --> 00:51:46,250
“却对我的阴茎没什么兴趣”

627
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:50,083
“只是偶尔用手背别一别”

628
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:54,375
“阴茎缓缓硬起来了”

629
00:51:55,250 --> 00:52:00,833
“但她只是用相同的速度勾勒着刀片”

630
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,500
“在我睾丸紧绷着的皮肤上”

631
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,250
“除毛后”

632
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:15,250
“她用一条浸过温水的毛巾细细地拭去剃胡膏”

633
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:19,083
“没有留下一缕毛发”

634
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,750
“她小心翼翼地在我的睾丸和金属做的洗手盆之间操作着”

635
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:36,250
“最后一次擦拭之后 当她和我光滑的睾丸之间再无他物时”

636
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:40,333
“她终于得意地笑了”

637
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:47,875
“接着她张到尽可能的大 技艺娴熟地”

638
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:52,458
“把我右边的睾丸整个裹到口腔中”

639
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:02,125
“这时我的阴茎已经硬得立了起来”

640
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:07,500
“但她还是用手将它再往上举 转动着”

641
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,875
“我浑身酥麻 沉浸在她的温柔之中”

642
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:18,458
“她心无旁骛地吸吮着我的睾丸”

643
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:24,458
“她试图将口腔完美包裹着我的睾丸”

644
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:31,583
“就如木匠用卡尺度量螺栓一般”

645
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:37,375
“每次她张大嘴巴”

646
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:45,375
“我多希望我的睾丸能膨胀到足以填补她的所有空白”

647
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:46,875
打断一下

648
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:19,458
“除了擦口水 她只专注地”

649
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:27,083
“移动着下巴 移动着舌头 抚摸着我右侧睾丸的尺寸”

650
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,208
“看着她醉心于此”

651
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:39,125
“我对我直挺的阴茎感到非常尴尬”

652
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:45,208
“我的羞耻和它的硬度是相称的”

653
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:49,000
“羞耻变成了酸痛”

654
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:58,708
“当她吸入一口特别大的唾液的一瞬 我射了出来”

655
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:03,250
“她松开了我的右睾丸”

656
00:55:04,042 --> 00:55:07,583
“左手握着我软下去的阴茎”

657
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:13,750
“她说 '抱歉'  看都没看我一眼。”

658
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:18,125
“她又缓缓张开嘴了”

659
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:22,375
“包住了我的左睾丸 开始度量起来”

660
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,625
“我软踏踏的阴茎又射了一次”

661
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:33,875
“这次 在她道歉之前”

662
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:38,208
“我跪到地上 额头触地”

663
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:43,708
“泪水横流 发抖着”

664
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:47,958
“就这么 我的液体流动着”

665
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:57,750
教授...

666
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:00,250
你说

667
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:04,875
是什么让您如此描绘？

668
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:07,625
这个啊...

669
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,333
理由很复杂

670
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:16,875
很复杂？

671
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,750
首先是故事的结构

672
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:25,125
简而言之 它能吸引某种类型的读者

673
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:28,750
让它出现在中间的位置

674
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:34,333
我想读者会继续读下去直到最后

675
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:38,458
不过一位法官强烈谴责了这里的描绘

676
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:43,750
她说这一幕大大降低了小说的品味

677
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,833
也许她是对的

678
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:50,250
我很喜欢这一幕

679
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:55,625
给我的感觉 您也是非常享受这里的创作

680
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,208
也许是吧

681
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:04,083
但是 这是文字需要的 并不是我需要的

682
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:06,500
文字？

683
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,750
这就是另一个原因了

684
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:14,000
文字的脉络应该由他们的关系决定

685
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:19,208
由字到文 由文到章 这和我想要的不太一样

686
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:24,500
如果按我的标准 只要词序正确

687
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,125
我就保留下来

688
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:31,250
你写这段文字的时候是硬着的吗？

689
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:36,375
也许是的...

690
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,375
我觉得是

691
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:48,375
我觉得我应该是硬着的 这就是这一幕应该唤起的状态

692
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:50,750
当然

693
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:11,375
我很高兴读到这段文字

694
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:13,833
为什么？

695
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:18,500
我在性面前不能自己

696
00:58:19,292 --> 00:58:20,625
你是这样的吗？

697
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:22,625
是的

698
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,875
我经常抵不住性诱惑

699
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,500
- 经常 - 没错

700
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:35,125
我拒绝不了那些吸引着我的男人

701
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,500
我现在有些理不清的关系

702
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:52,333
我想说的是 您或许也有着同样的困惑

703
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:55,875
屈服于性诱惑

704
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,500
嗯

705
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:02,000
嗯 也许是吧

706
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:08,333
写一部小说 不得不直面自己的软弱

707
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:13,333
您有试过屈服于性诱惑吗？

708
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:20,625
我的生活百般无聊 从来没遇到过任何诱惑

709
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:24,333
如果有 我会完全陷进去的

710
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:30,000
生活百般无聊的人能写得出小说吗？

711
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:37,500
我只是最大限度地表达可以用文字表达的东西

712
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,500
我的经历毫无用处

713
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:45,375
文字会和读者的经历产生共鸣

714
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,458
就比如说你的经历

715
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,208
我的经历

716
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:57,083
我不妨直说了

717
00:59:57,542 --> 01:00:00,250
你说性是你的软肋

718
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:02,583
是的

719
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,875
你很关意这点吗？

720
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:12,500
如果是这样 你应该和心理医生谈一下 而不是我

721
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:21,375
我怕我丈夫会发现

722
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:26,000
但就性格而言 我没有太担心

723
01:00:26,792 --> 01:00:29,000
因为我不沉迷性

724
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:35,875
我只是觉得我应该加强一下自己的意志力

725
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:41,000
在我看来 你反而有着很强的意志力

726
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:44,333
与其他同学相比

727
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:47,250
谢谢

728
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:51,458
- 毕竟我年龄大出许多 - 不对

729
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:56,000
与年龄无关 而在于天赋

730
01:00:57,542 --> 01:01:00,375
那会是什么样的天赋？

731
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,000
你的才华不可名状而且高度可塑

732
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:15,208
简而言之 你可以不受常识的束缚而思考和行动

733
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:19,750
这非常难得 尤其是在当下的日本社会

734
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:23,458
这没什么大不了的吧

735
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:29,375
我只是有着别他人更强的性欲 或者说我的自制力弱于他人

736
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:33,875
我不太符合他人的标准

737
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:38,583
这就是我所说的 我觉得这点难能可贵

738
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:41,083
是吗？

739
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:47,833
我从来没觉得我有比其他人更好的地方

740
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:52,208
这其实也是你智慧的标志之一

741
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:58,958
您真了不得 教授

742
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:01,000
怎么突然这么说

743
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:05,458
从来就没有人对我如此肯定

744
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:07,500
是这样吗？

745
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:13,250
不过我不认为我很好 我就一蠢货

746
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:18,750
如果真是这样 你得说服我 因为我不觉得你蠢

747
01:02:20,292 --> 01:02:26,125
说来恐怕要花上一段时间 因为得从我的童年讲起

748
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,958
到最后你可能还是会叫我再去看心理医生

749
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,958
我为我的鲁莽道歉

750
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:38,000
不过话说回来 心理咨询并不是件坏事

751
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:39,875
嗯

752
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:43,750
我应该会去的

753
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:52,708
我想这足以证明我就是一蠢货

754
01:02:54,667 --> 01:03:01,500
教授知道从刚开始我就一直在试图诱惑你吗？

755
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:06,500
没有 我从未这样想过

756
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,458
那么您觉得我在干嘛

757
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:15,458
我只是觉得你很奇怪

758
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:23,625
实话说 我还有点害怕

759
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:27,500
我也害怕

760
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:34,625
我想我的谨慎是因为没能理解你的行为

761
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,708
我刚是在勾引你上当

762
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:43,875
我是为了勾引出您不雅的言语和行为

763
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,958
由此看起来像是您在诱惑我

764
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,000
为了什么？

765
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:55,125
把它记录下来然后卖给媒体

766
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,250
你现在在录音吗？

767
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:05,625
- 是 我现在就关掉... - 从开始到现在

768
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:08,625
你刚在念字的时候也有在录吗？

769
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:13,125
是 一直在录

770
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:20,000
难以置信...

771
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:37,625
- 对不起 - 听着

772
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,333
希望你不要误解我的意思

773
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:50,250
我可以 要一份录音吗？

774
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:58,375
刚你在念的时候我就希望把它录下来

775
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:01,708
因为这可能再也不会发生了

776
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:04,333
但你做到了

777
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:10,000
我现在很性奋

778
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:14,958
毋庸置疑 这对你来说很尴尬

779
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:18,958
你念的部分也极具诱惑性

780
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:25,125
一个声音如此甜美的人念出我的文字

781
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,333
令人振奋不已

782
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,458
闻所未闻

783
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:34,875
您以后还会遇到的

784
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:38,875
不 你的声音可遇不可求

785
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:44,750
- 谢谢 - 不 是我得谢谢你

786
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:54,500
教授您……不想知道我为什么要陷害你吗？

787
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:59,625
不是因为你不喜欢我吗？

788
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:05,250
不是 我没有理由不喜欢你

789
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:09,500
那你可能会因此被不喜欢我的人所讨厌

790
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:17,875
但 我没办法变得让所有人都喜欢

791
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:24,750
那这种情况 该怎么办……

792
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:30,750
如果我只是因为做自己而被讨厌

793
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,625
我不知道

794
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:39,375
如果我只是因为是我 而且无法改变自我

795
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:45,708
就被他人锁憎恶 我该怎么办？

796
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:03,250
我不知道你的人生里发生了什么

797
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:11,375
但如果你周围的人让你觉得自己一文不值 不妨勇敢反击

798
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:17,000
统治者试图控制你时 不妨大胆拒绝

799
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:23,250
去拥抱只有你自己知道的专属于自己的价值

800
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:30,625
单枪匹马是很痛苦 不过 你必须这样做

801
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:36,250
因为只有做到这点我们才有可能在某个瞬间和某个人

802
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,208
产生奇迹般的共鸣和共勉

803
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,625
它可能永远不会降临

804
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:47,750
但如果没有人做自己 它就肯定不会发生

805
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,333
不是任何人都做到

806
01:07:55,167 --> 01:08:01,125
您的才华得到了社会的极大认可

807
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:05,583
所以您才这么说

808
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,625
你说的也是

809
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:17,125
我多希望能够在拿奖之前就和你说刚刚的话

810
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:23,458
但如果我没有拿奖 我们也就不会出现在这里

811
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,500
说的也是

812
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:35,333
对不起 我应该早点读到您的书

813
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,333
还有很多其他的书你也应该读读

814
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:44,000
我没有读太多别的书

815
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:47,750
这让我很羡慕（因为读书少所以你可以遇见很多很好的书）

816
01:08:56,417 --> 01:09:00,375
我该如何给您发送录音呢？

817
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:02,750
可以发电子邮件吗？

818
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:06,125
可以的 我可以发邮件给您

819
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:11,125
劳烦你发到“segawa”的大学域名邮箱

820
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:13,875
好的

821
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:22,625
您收到录音后 会拿来做一些特殊的事情吗？

822
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:24,000
特殊？

823
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:29,875
- 我指的是自慰 - 不会 我不会这么干

824
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,750
那我不能给您

825
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:40,125
如果您想要录音 您得答应我

826
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:46,625
您至少要对着我的声音自慰一次

827
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:49,375
这样您才能收到文件

828
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:58,375
我明白了 那我保证至少对你的声音自慰一次

829
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,750
好 我会发给您的

830
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:04,833
谢谢

831
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:11,208
教授您会介意我自慰的时候也想着您吗？

832
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,250
请自便

833
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:28,708
如果您喜欢 我会把从头到尾我阅读的部分发给您

834
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,750
真的吗？

835
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:39,250
我很高兴会有人喜欢我的声音 有人喜欢你

836
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,125
这实在不易

837
01:10:42,292 --> 01:10:44,125
这是我的荣幸

838
01:10:44,917 --> 01:10:46,500
非常感谢您

839
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:49,875
谢谢您

840
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:57,000
我很感激

841
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:12,625
门？

842
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:16,583
打开着就行

843
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:19,458
那么 再见

844
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:21,250
路上小心

845
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:50,500
敬爱的濑川教授

846
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:53,708
今天真的很感谢您 这是录音文件

847
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:55,875
尽管很艰难

848
01:11:56,042 --> 01:11:59,500
但心里的重担已经从我的肩上卸下来了

849
01:11:59,667 --> 01:12:00,625
语气太重了好像...

850
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:13,958
今天真的很感谢您 和您聊天真的很有趣

851
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:18,250
这是录音文件 不要忘了我们的承诺

852
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:23,875
- 我们回来了- 你们回来啦

853
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:30,750
- 我以为你出去了 - 喔 不好意思 计划有变

854
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,500
佐川（Sagawa）速递留下了送货单

855
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,125
是吗？

856
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,125
-坐穿（Yamato）  - 噢 谢谢 坐穿（Yamato）？

857
01:12:38,417 --> 01:12:41,208
是“佐川”（Sagawa） 不是“坐穿”（Yamato）

858
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:43,208
佐川（Sagawa）……佐川（Sagawa）……

859
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:44,833
对咯

860
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:50,458
家里没菜了 我们出去吃吧

861
01:12:50,542 --> 01:12:53,708
好呀 你想吃什么？

862
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:58,875
至：sagawa@toko-univ.ac.jp
（教授的邮箱是segawa@toko-univ.ac.jp）

863
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:03,583
你可以的  噢 干得好

864
01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:05,750
非常好

865
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,333
五年后

866
01:13:50,042 --> 01:13:51,208
不会吧？

867
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,750
你一点都没变

868
01:13:57,792 --> 01:14:00,250
- 真的嘛 - 对 丝毫未变

869
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:03,375
我的天 你怎么在这？

870
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,250
感觉你变了好多

871
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,833
嗯 也是 说起来过去多久了

872
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:12,500
你现在做什么工作？

873
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,958
- 校对员 - 不会吧？

874
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:20,125
我们公司刚刚解散了校对部门

875
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:24,625
你呢？ 你现在做什么？

876
01:14:24,792 --> 01:14:28,000
出版 我是编辑

877
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:32,000
我负责文学板块 很可笑吧

878
01:14:33,292 --> 01:14:35,458
你的名片给我一下呗

879
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,875
为什么？

880
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:42,375
我们打算外包我们的校对工作

881
01:14:44,417 --> 01:14:48,750
- 我身上没有带 - 你们公司叫什么来着？

882
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,083
保密

883
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:51,458
哇

884
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:53,875
干嘛？

885
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:56,125
你还在生我气吗

886
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:03,458
小说你都懒得看吧

887
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:09,958
好吧 我现在多多少少看一下 但我认为这就是与众不同的地方

888
01:15:11,292 --> 01:15:14,208
这也可能是他们给我这份工作的原因

889
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:17,750
看小说全神贯注的太无聊了

890
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:19,625
- 也没什么意义 - 对不起

891
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:23,750
您可以闭嘴吗？

892
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:42,750
你知道 濑川辞职还有你离婚都不是我的错

893
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:47,125
你脾气撒错地儿了

894
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:50,875
我知道

895
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:53,750
不过真没意料到啊

896
01:15:55,042 --> 01:15:58,625
想想管理员误收到你的性感邮件

897
01:15:59,292 --> 01:16:01,125
- 一个e一个a - 闭嘴

898
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:06,500
很难相信你会搞错

899
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:09,875
还是觉得很好笑

900
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:12,833
我也不敢相信

901
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:19,250
奈绪 很抱歉我让你做的这一切

902
01:16:19,417 --> 01:16:21,625
但我也很感激

903
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:26,125
我的愚蠢让我想哭

904
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:33,375
我们再也听不到他的消息了 还挺想知道他现在在干嘛

905
01:16:34,167 --> 01:16:35,375
我不知道

906
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,333
他还活着吗？

907
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:51,083
- 你可以邀约他写一本书 - 不可能 他消失得无影无踪

908
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:54,875
你可以从其他编辑那里打听到他的消息 不是吗？

909
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:56,750
我为什么要打听他

910
01:16:57,292 --> 01:17:02,000
或许有一天你可以负责编辑他的作品

911
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:07,333
而我可以校对它

912
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,125
想都别想

913
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:15,750
- 那样不是很好吗？ - 一点也不好

914
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,250
下一站有乘客...

915
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,125
你住这边吗？

916
01:17:27,667 --> 01:17:28,833
嗯

917
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:34,458
我要结婚了 奈绪

918
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:37,000
诶

919
01:17:39,917 --> 01:17:42,250
- 没有“恭喜”吗？- 恭喜

920
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:44,625
谢谢

921
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:48,000
跟我说说她

922
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:54,750
她是我同事 比我大两岁 所以想赶在三十岁之前结婚

923
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:56,333
我被她吃定了

924
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:01,250
恭喜

925
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:04,875
祝你幸福

926
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,333
哇 这祝福还挺这出乎意料的

927
01:18:23,667 --> 01:18:26,000
- 这是什么？ - 我的名片

928
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:28,708
你不是没带吗？

929
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:30,958
我改变主意了

930
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:58,042
第 3 集：再度

931
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:06,750
Xeron病毒：一种通过在用户的硬盘中发送随机文件来传播的计算机病毒

932
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:09,750
并由此散播给用户接触过的任何其他用户

933
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:14,583
自2019年以来 它的诞生已经泄露了各种各样的机密信息

934
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:20,500
这导致世界脱网重返邮政和电报时代

935
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:24,875
没有人知道这种情况是暂时的还是永久的......

936
01:20:35,792 --> 01:20:38,458
1998级高中同学聚会

937
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,208
宫城女子高中 1998年同学会

938
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:49,250
最后让我们一起干杯 干杯

939
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:51,458
干杯

940
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,208
很高兴再见到你

941
01:21:08,667 --> 01:21:10,500
- 哦 - 你一点也没变

942
01:21:10,667 --> 01:21:11,625
真的吗？

943
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:13,583
一点都没 还记得我不

944
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:15,750
当然了 清原

945
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:19,250
- 是清宫 - 不好意思

946
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:23,750
没事 你就是那种类型的人

947
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:26,250
- 哪种类型？ - 无辜的类型

948
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,500
哎呦 这么犀利

949
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:30,958
我是做了啥了吗？

950
01:21:32,542 --> 01:21:35,333
- 来见人吗？ - 不是呢

951
01:21:37,667 --> 01:21:40,083
- 你怎么在这里？ - 不想我出现吗？

952
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:43,958
我以为你不喜欢这样的聚会

953
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:47,625
我可喜欢藤崎老师的历史课了

954
01:21:47,792 --> 01:21:49,250
- 要过去打个招呼吗？ - 这倒不用

955
01:21:49,792 --> 01:21:51,500
感觉会挺尴尬的

956
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:54,500
你原来还会害怕尴尬呀

957
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:58,000
我都不知道我是什么样的人

958
01:21:58,542 --> 01:22:00,625
我是指 你还穿了条裙子

959
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:04,875
我发现我原来还挺喜欢裙子 奇怪吧

960
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:07,833
你变淑女了

961
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:10,833
对呀 我变得淑女且普通了

962
01:22:11,042 --> 01:22:13,333
- 你不是指那意思吧 - 诶？

963
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:16,000
你真了不起 看起来很不错

964
01:22:16,417 --> 01:22:17,500
谢谢

965
01:22:20,292 --> 01:22:23,125
一起去参加晚会吧

966
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,250
- 你要走了吗？ - 嗯？

967
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,250
是的 谢谢

968
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:35,958
- 再见 - 再见

969
01:22:36,292 --> 01:22:37,083
再见

970
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,500
猪排之家

971
01:23:34,417 --> 01:23:35,375
老板

972
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,750
是

973
01:23:36,917 --> 01:23:38,000
真好吃

974
01:23:38,167 --> 01:23:39,708
谢谢您

975
01:23:40,792 --> 01:23:46,083
我的高中时经常来光顾 还记得吗

976
01:23:46,292 --> 01:23:48,625
对不起 我记性不太好

977
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:50,375
没事没事

978
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,083
真的好吃了

979
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:53,458
感谢您的赞赏

980
01:23:54,417 --> 01:23:56,500
- 下次要再来喔 - 一定

981
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:26,833
仙台站

982
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:54,875
上面等

983
01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:56,875
我要下来吗？

984
01:24:57,042 --> 01:24:58,208
上面等

985
01:24:58,417 --> 01:24:59,500
好 知道了

986
01:25:15,167 --> 01:25:18,000
- 这也太巧了 - 嗯

987
01:25:18,167 --> 01:25:19,500
难以置信

988
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:21,000
你怎么会在这？

989
01:25:22,042 --> 01:25:23,125
为了同学聚会

990
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:25,625
高中同学聚会

991
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:29,125
- 我都不知道 - 不会吧

992
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:33,875
肯定是因为我换了姓氏跟地址

993
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:36,625
嗯 不过我这次回来就是为了见你的

994
01:25:36,792 --> 01:25:38,500
太好了 太开心了

995
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:42,083
你还住在东京吗？

996
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:43,000
嗯

997
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,083
- 现在就要回去吗？ - 嗯

998
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:48,208
你有没有空？

999
01:25:49,292 --> 01:25:51,625
- 啊 - 我们去喝一杯吧

1000
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:57,750
毁掉这个偶然的重逢实在很不应该

1001
01:25:58,792 --> 01:26:02,875
不过我得在下午 2 点到 4 点之间在家里收货

1002
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:04,000
这样呀

1003
01:26:04,167 --> 01:26:07,875
不是在拒绝你 跟我一块回家呗

1004
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:11,250
前提是你够时间 我们一起喝杯茶

1005
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,250
时间完全够 但真的没问题吗？

1006
01:26:14,417 --> 01:26:17,458
没问题 白天没人在家

1007
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:18,500
来嘛来嘛

1008
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:19,708
好

1009
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:23,750
走个15 分钟就到了 就在加丹那边

1010
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,375
加丹好呀

1011
01:26:25,917 --> 01:26:27,500
嗯嗯也很方便

1012
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,750
还有谁参加了聚会？

1013
01:26:37,917 --> 01:26:40,250
我都分不清谁打谁了

1014
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:44,000
20 年了都 她们的姓氏都变了

1015
01:26:44,167 --> 01:26:45,250
是喔

1016
01:26:45,417 --> 01:26:48,333
我插不进嘴

1017
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:51,125
估计她们也认不出我了

1018
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:54,833
你肯定觉得我没有朋友

1019
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:56,250
才不会

1020
01:26:56,542 --> 01:26:59,250
我就瞎猜下

1021
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:04,875
不过我有和画室的清宫聊了一会

1022
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:06,458
清宫

1023
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:08,250
不记得了

1024
01:27:08,417 --> 01:27:11,125
她现在时一所学校的美术老师

1025
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:12,625
哦～

1026
01:27:12,792 --> 01:27:16,208
她还说她想让我当她的模特

1027
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:17,625
裸体模特

1028
01:27:17,792 --> 01:27:19,208
才不是

1029
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,625
不过我也不确定

1030
01:27:21,792 --> 01:27:23,500
那时候你很酷帅

1031
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:26,875
清宫说我一点都没变

1032
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:28,625
这怎么可能呢

1033
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:31,708
也是呀 我俩都变了好多

1034
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:36,125
你是做什么的？

1035
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:39,333
我是系统工程师 码农

1036
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,875
所以说

1037
01:27:41,042 --> 01:27:44,333
- 所以说我现在失业了 - 太难了

1038
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:50,458
不过还好我有些积蓄 也有些失业救济金给到我们

1039
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:52,958
就当作休息呗

1040
01:27:53,417 --> 01:27:54,500
那还行

1041
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,750
你好

1042
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,333
- 今天可热了 - 是呢

1043
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:03,458
- 小宇在你家玩得可开心了- 这太好了

1044
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:06,625
也欢迎小瞳随时来我们家玩

1045
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,333
谢谢 她会去的

1046
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:12,125
- 再会 - 再会

1047
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:18,708
感觉有点超现实

1048
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:19,833
是吗

1049
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:21,375
你孩子多大了？

1050
01:28:21,667 --> 01:28:24,875
儿子16岁 女儿14岁

1051
01:28:25,042 --> 01:28:26,750
- 原来如此 - 嗯

1052
01:28:27,417 --> 01:28:29,333
- 太好了 - 还好啦

1053
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:31,208
我们到了

1054
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,500
哇

1055
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:44,625
“小林家”

1056
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:53,750
请进

1057
01:29:01,542 --> 01:29:03,333
包包随便放就行

1058
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:07,750
你老公...

1059
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,375
是做什么的

1060
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:14,250
他是一家制药公司的研发人员

1061
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,625
怪不得

1062
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:17,875
- 怎么说？ - 没什么

1063
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,583
有受影响吗？

1064
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:21,500
病毒吗？

1065
01:29:22,292 --> 01:29:27,208
他的研究数据被泄露了 但其他公司也是这样

1066
01:29:28,042 --> 01:29:32,458
他工作主要靠显微镜就还好

1067
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:33,625
是呢

1068
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:35,958
你今天干了啥？

1069
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:39,625
- 我去上了茶道 - 真的吗？

1070
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:40,625
怎么?

1071
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:46,750
有点出乎意料 不过我敢肯定 你不适合茶道

1072
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:48,458
我谢谢你

1073
01:29:48,792 --> 01:29:51,250
我现在就在泡一般般的茶

1074
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:53,375
我不挑剔的

1075
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,375
要来点红豆糕吗？ 我冰起来了

1076
01:29:58,542 --> 01:30:01,125
- 可好吃了 - 可以吗？

1077
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,500
我们一家子和我一样不太喜欢甜品

1078
01:30:04,667 --> 01:30:06,000
多浪费呀

1079
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:08,958
有什么我帮得上的吗？

1080
01:30:09,125 --> 01:30:11,125
安啦 当自己家就行

1081
01:30:17,875 --> 01:30:20,208
- 啊 那不能碰 - 不好意思

1082
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:21,750
不好意思

1083
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:25,833
你家孩子是手办控吗？

1084
01:30:26,042 --> 01:30:27,583
嗯 我儿子是

1085
01:30:27,792 --> 01:30:28,833
嗯

1086
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,500
我可不好意思了

1087
01:30:31,042 --> 01:30:33,625
不过现在的动漫都很有趣

1088
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:36,625
现在的动漫都是一整套一整套的蓝光盘

1089
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:41,250
因为所有的碟片租赁都不做了

1090
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:44,625
前两天我没在家错过了快递

1091
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:47,458
我儿子因此暴躁如雷 你知道吗

1092
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:49,083
你也一块看吗？

1093
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:51,083
不看 你呢

1094
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,875
我现在为了消磨时间看得可狠

1095
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:00,250
我搞不明白 都搭不上话

1096
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:03,500
- 你看了就知道了 - 也许吧

1097
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,875
但我没兴趣

1098
01:31:06,667 --> 01:31:11,125
我懒得在乎别人喜欢什么 我就是不感兴趣

1099
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:23,500
是我婆婆的

1100
01:31:23,917 --> 01:31:25,625


1101
01:31:27,667 --> 01:31:29,500
你还有弹钢琴吗？

1102
01:31:30,292 --> 01:31:31,083
嗯

1103
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:32,500
完全没弹过了

1104
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:34,583
这样呀

1105
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:38,583
我女儿拉小提琴时 我也才弹两下 当作伴奏

1106
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,375
感觉你很害怕沉默

1107
01:31:44,792 --> 01:31:45,750
是吗？

1108
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:52,000
你一直在避开一些重要的事 尽管已经过去20年了

1109
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,750
什么重要的事？

1110
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,833
你现在过得开心吗？

1111
01:31:58,667 --> 01:31:59,625
哦

1112
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:05,125
看到这房子再问这事 听起来很蠢

1113
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:08,375
不过这是我唯一想要问你的

1114
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:12,875
我没有想过这个问题

1115
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:15,875
你不用非得去想

1116
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:22,875
我说不出来

1117
01:32:36,042 --> 01:32:39,625
我尽量让自己过好每一天

1118
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:44,875
有时很困难 当我也还是尽量保持乐观

1119
01:32:45,792 --> 01:32:49,458
客观来讲 我应该是很开心的

1120
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:56,708
觉得如果我说我不开心就会被责备

1121
01:32:57,542 --> 01:33:00,125
我是问你想的是什么

1122
01:33:02,542 --> 01:33:03,750
我不知道...

1123
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:12,625
你呢？ 你过得开心吗？

1124
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:15,583
不开心

1125
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:18,375
为什么? 因为工作?

1126
01:33:18,792 --> 01:33:19,708
不是

1127
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:27,583
因为我一直都在后悔当初没有为自己的感情去争取

1128
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:33,125
我不该放弃 即使结果都会一样

1129
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,583
但那时我很无知

1130
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:38,375
我害怕被伤害得更深

1131
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:41,750
这就是我为什么要来这里见你

1132
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:42,833
等等

1133
01:33:47,917 --> 01:33:53,000
让我确认一下 因为看起来这次谈话对你来说非比寻常

1134
01:33:53,542 --> 01:33:54,375
确认什么?

1135
01:33:55,792 --> 01:34:00,833
坦白讲 我记不起你的名字了

1136
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:04,083
你认真的吗?

1137
01:34:04,292 --> 01:34:09,083
不好意思 我多希望我会记得 或者你会在谈话中说出来

1138
01:34:10,167 --> 01:34:12,500
怎么能忘记?

1139
01:34:13,292 --> 01:34:15,208
还有一点让我很疑惑

1140
01:34:15,792 --> 01:34:16,708
什么?

1141
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:19,708
你知道我的名字吗?

1142
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:21,875
我当然记得了

1143
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:24,083
那么我是谁?

1144
01:34:26,417 --> 01:34:27,875
由纪美嘉

1145
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:29,000
哦

1146
01:34:30,792 --> 01:34:31,875
小林绫

1147
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,750
我名字叫小林绫

1148
01:34:42,167 --> 01:34:46,375
我娘家姓叫野村 不管怎样 我都不可能是由纪美嘉

1149
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,583
- 你不是美嘉? - 不是

1150
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:53,625
我是小林绫 不是你的同学

1151
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:56,375
大概你认错人了

1152
01:34:57,292 --> 01:35:01,500
但是……你不是记得我吗?

1153
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:03,708
嗯

1154
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:10,083
我们是在扶梯上见到的吧

1155
01:35:10,542 --> 01:35:11,375
嗯

1156
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:18,875
当时我们擦肩而过 你惊讶地看着我

1157
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:25,083
所以我就觉得你一定是我认识的人

1158
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:30,958
我返回去时 你也下来了 我顿时惊慌失措

1159
01:35:31,417 --> 01:35:35,125
我想了又想 想了又想 突然记起来了

1160
01:35:36,167 --> 01:35:40,083
“她是我在高中时的同学”

1161
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:43,250
不是说你认得我吗?

1162
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,250
你高中在哪念的

1163
01:35:45,667 --> 01:35:47,250
宫城女子高中

1164
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:49,500
我是仙台高中的

1165
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:58,750
对吧 不好意思 都是我的错

1166
01:35:59,417 --> 01:36:01,875
应该说 我俩的错

1167
01:36:03,042 --> 01:36:05,250
简直不敢相信

1168
01:36:06,292 --> 01:36:10,833
你一定很想见到她吧

1169
01:36:13,042 --> 01:36:15,583
恩 没错

1170
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:19,333
我非常想念她

1171
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:27,125
所以你才会把年龄相仿的我认错成美嘉

1172
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:31,500
不可能认错的啊

1173
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:34,833
但你都20年没见过她了

1174
01:36:39,417 --> 01:36:41,333
你们还有联络吗？

1175
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:43,458
没有

1176
01:36:44,917 --> 01:36:48,125
因为我听说她大学一毕业就结婚了

1177
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:54,458
难道说你和美嘉是恋人吗？

1178
01:37:04,042 --> 01:37:05,000
真的很抱歉

1179
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:11,833
哎呀 对不起

1180
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
不好意思 您的快递到了

1181
01:37:15,792 --> 01:37:16,875
劳烦您了

1182
01:37:17,167 --> 01:37:19,250
请在这里签字

1183
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:20,458
好的

1184
01:37:24,542 --> 01:37:25,750
小林

1185
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,458
- 这给您 - 谢谢

1186
01:37:40,167 --> 01:37:42,125
不如多呆一会儿呗

1187
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:46,250
红豆糕和茶水都准备好了

1188
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,500
吃起来就像是红豆冰棍

1189
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:40,500
是吗？

1190
01:38:41,417 --> 01:38:43,333
高级款

1191
01:38:49,042 --> 01:38:51,375
你确定你不是美嘉吗？

1192
01:38:52,042 --> 01:38:54,500
我不是美嘉 对不住了

1193
01:38:55,375 --> 01:38:57,500
啊

1194
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:05,833
美嘉是你的初恋吗？

1195
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,208
我也不确定

1196
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:13,375
但她是我第一个伴侣

1197
01:39:17,792 --> 01:39:20,125
高中毕业时我们约了一次会

1198
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:24,000
我搬到东京后我俩开始了异地

1199
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:26,875
后来 她有了男朋友

1200
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:28,125
哦

1201
01:39:29,417 --> 01:39:33,250
她不像我 我那时应该是感受到了爱的情感

1202
01:39:33,792 --> 01:39:36,375
可不知怎的 我却无视了自己的情感

1203
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:40,875
你是说 只有你才是真正的女同性恋嘛

1204
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:42,125
真正的？

1205
01:39:43,292 --> 01:39:44,208
是吧

1206
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:51,375
我们原本计划好大学毕业后一起住在东京

1207
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,750
但她出轨时我们就分开了 我的意思是 她找男朋友时

1208
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:57,500
我懂了

1209
01:39:58,667 --> 01:39:59,875
后面就再也没见过她了吗？

1210
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:04,250
嗯 后来有人告诉我她嫁给了那个男人

1211
01:40:05,417 --> 01:40:07,333
你爱过她吗？

1212
01:40:19,042 --> 01:40:20,125
我老公他

1213
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,833
联系过他的高中时候的女朋友

1214
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000


1215
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,250
我会发现是因为Xeron病毒将他的电子邮件发送给了我

1216
01:40:35,667 --> 01:40:40,125
你也知道 他们所有往来的邮件记录都可以被看到

1217
01:40:40,292 --> 01:40:41,125
嗯

1218
01:40:42,875 --> 01:40:49,625
他在邮件中写道“我真的很想见你 但我们不应该”

1219
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:53,875
“我知道我们都爱各自的家人”

1220
01:40:54,292 --> 01:40:55,375
他很忠实

1221
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:57,333
是的

1222
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,208
你什么感觉？

1223
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:06,125
很难用语言描述

1224
01:41:07,542 --> 01:41:10,083
但是他写的真的很好

1225
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,750
我被他的文字吓了一跳

1226
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:15,125
什么样的文字

1227
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:27,125
“你对我说的话语 让我一直坚持至今”

1228
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:35,625
“时光荏苒 慢然至今 你的存在也一如我的停锚 ”

1229
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:43,583
“遇见你是我生命中发生过的最美好的事物之一”

1230
01:41:44,042 --> 01:41:45,375
哇

1231
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:48,625
我一直在反复地读

1232
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,375
但这只是其中一件“最好的事情”不是吗？

1233
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:56,625
没错 这是一个奇怪的表述

1234
01:41:56,917 --> 01:41:59,458
你告诉过他你读了他的邮件吗？

1235
01:41:59,917 --> 01:42:00,875
没有

1236
01:42:01,167 --> 01:42:04,750
你伴侣……我的意思是 你先生有注意到吗？

1237
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:06,083
“我先生”？

1238
01:42:07,792 --> 01:42:11,833
我不确定 我觉得他当时忙昏头了

1239
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:16,333
基本上所有的东西都被泄露了

1240
01:42:16,917 --> 01:42:20,208
我敢肯定他也说不出来什么东西被泄露了

1241
01:42:22,292 --> 01:42:23,750
你不打算告诉他吗？

1242
01:42:25,542 --> 01:42:28,750
这样做只会让事情变得更尴尬

1243
01:42:31,167 --> 01:42:34,750
他确确实实联系过她

1244
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,833
还想要见到她

1245
01:42:39,292 --> 01:42:40,625
不可原谅吗？

1246
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,125
仅仅因为他只是想一下？

1247
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:55,250
在我看来你们都是迫不及待地想去见到某个人

1248
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:58,500
你不用这么死脑筋

1249
01:43:02,292 --> 01:43:05,833
对不起 我甚至都认识你

1250
01:43:07,792 --> 01:43:08,750
没事

1251
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,958
我看起来很善解人意吗？

1252
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:22,625
怎么了？

1253
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,708
我一直在你身上看到美嘉的影子

1254
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:29,250
我有这么像她吗？

1255
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:32,625
也许是因为你散发出来的气质

1256
01:43:33,417 --> 01:43:38,125
你看起来和我想象中她现在的样子一模一样

1257
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,750
美嘉看起来也很善解人意吗？

1258
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:42,000
完全没有

1259
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:47,958
她看起来是这样 不过实际上蛮横无理

1260
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:50,333
那她还真挺像我的

1261
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,000
如果你愿意 我可以给你扮演美嘉

1262
01:44:01,542 --> 01:44:02,625
扮演她？

1263
01:44:04,042 --> 01:44:07,250
不然太可惜了

1264
01:44:07,417 --> 01:44:08,500
什么？

1265
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:10,625
我们戏剧性的偶遇

1266
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:12,833
你在说什么？

1267
01:44:13,042 --> 01:44:15,625
我的外貌和性格似乎很像美嘉

1268
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:19,375
- 这不是重点 - 我可能演的不够好

1269
01:44:20,667 --> 01:44:26,250
但我知道这对你来说意义非凡

1270
01:44:32,792 --> 01:44:36,333
你介意我现在才来问你名字吗？

1271
01:44:40,792 --> 01:44:42,208
樋口夏子

1272
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500
夏子的意思是“夏天的孩子”

1273
01:44:46,417 --> 01:44:47,375
夏子

1274
01:44:48,167 --> 01:44:49,250
多好的名字

1275
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,375
夏子

1276
01:45:02,417 --> 01:45:04,875
你说你不开心

1277
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:09,625
是因为我吗？

1278
01:45:10,125 --> 01:45:12,708
还是算了吧

1279
01:45:14,417 --> 01:45:17,625
在我之后你有没有和别人约会过？

1280
01:45:19,167 --> 01:45:20,708
有过一些

1281
01:45:21,875 --> 01:45:23,958
但我没办法投入真感情

1282
01:45:24,167 --> 01:45:26,750
你跟我才有感觉对吗？

1283
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:32,875
你生气了吗？

1284
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:36,000
嗯

1285
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:40,750
我生气了

1286
01:45:44,417 --> 01:45:45,583
对不起

1287
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,333
别这样

1288
01:45:50,375 --> 01:45:51,750
不是因为你

1289
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,250
我气自己没说出该说的话

1290
01:45:58,542 --> 01:46:00,125
什么话？

1291
01:46:01,292 --> 01:46:02,708
我不能说

1292
01:46:04,542 --> 01:46:10,625
你给我打的最后一通电话 当时我在涩谷中心街

1293
01:46:11,417 --> 01:46:16,750
流行歌曲还有潮女们吵吵嚷嚷的

1294
01:46:19,667 --> 01:46:23,875
但你的声音我还是听得清清楚楚

1295
01:46:24,917 --> 01:46:27,625
你的语气听起来很坚决

1296
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:34,125
在这之前 我就感觉到你已经受够了

1297
01:46:35,167 --> 01:46:38,375
所以 我什么也说不出来

1298
01:46:39,542 --> 01:46:44,208
我知道如果我说出来了 只会让你更痛苦

1299
01:46:45,417 --> 01:46:50,250
所以我挂掉电话 断了联系

1300
01:46:52,417 --> 01:46:54,958
但当时我想说的是

1301
01:46:55,917 --> 01:46:59,500
你是我唯一的爱

1302
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,958
你可能会爱上别人

1303
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:11,000
但我做不到

1304
01:47:14,417 --> 01:47:20,000
和我在一起可能会让你的人生一团糟

1305
01:47:21,042 --> 01:47:23,708
但我还是希望你能选我

1306
01:47:24,917 --> 01:47:26,625
但我不能把这说出来

1307
01:47:28,042 --> 01:47:28,875
嗯

1308
01:47:30,542 --> 01:47:36,375
我来这里并不是为了从你那得到点什么

1309
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:42,500
我只是想告诉你当时我不能说的那些话

1310
01:47:43,792 --> 01:47:47,333
尽管这会让你很痛苦 但我还是要说出来

1311
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:52,958
我现在明白了 痛苦对我们的人生至重至深

1312
01:47:54,167 --> 01:48:01,125
我私认为你现在的人生也像我一样有一个缺口

1313
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:03,458
所以我来了

1314
01:48:05,167 --> 01:48:06,125
缺口？

1315
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:12,875
你肯定有一个怎么也填不上的缺口

1316
01:48:16,667 --> 01:48:19,250
只可惜我也没办法填上它

1317
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:23,375
但是我和你有着一样的缺口

1318
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:29,958
我们或许通过这个缺口依旧链接着彼此

1319
01:48:31,292 --> 01:48:33,125
为了告诉你 我来到这儿

1320
01:48:45,542 --> 01:48:46,458
我回来了

1321
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:53,875
是这个吗？

1322
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:03,958
快问好

1323
01:49:05,042 --> 01:49:05,833
您好

1324
01:49:06,542 --> 01:49:07,958
很高兴见到你

1325
01:49:18,417 --> 01:49:19,583
很帅的小伙

1326
01:49:21,667 --> 01:49:23,750
我以为他是个宅男

1327
01:49:25,042 --> 01:49:28,375
他甚至都不打招呼

1328
01:49:31,875 --> 01:49:33,208
我该走了

1329
01:49:33,417 --> 01:49:36,000
没事 他不会下来的

1330
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:39,500
你女儿也快回来了吧 我要走了

1331
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,500
好吧 我可以送你到车站吗？

1332
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,500
嗯 谢谢

1333
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:55,333
小凯 我出门送送朋友

1334
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,625
所以你儿子的叫凯

1335
01:50:11,917 --> 01:50:12,833
对

1336
01:50:13,375 --> 01:50:14,625
女儿叫小宇

1337
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:15,625
没错

1338
01:50:16,792 --> 01:50:17,875
你怎么知道的？

1339
01:50:18,042 --> 01:50:19,750
你刚有提到过

1340
01:50:20,167 --> 01:50:21,208
哦这样呀

1341
01:50:21,792 --> 01:50:24,083
宇就是“昭昭之宇”

1342
01:50:24,667 --> 01:50:26,083
真好 简单又好听的名字

1343
01:50:26,292 --> 01:50:32,750
我们中立点的名字 这样以后就不会束缚他们了

1344
01:50:32,917 --> 01:50:34,500
你好开放

1345
01:50:35,667 --> 01:50:37,500
你先生呢 是怎样的人？

1346
01:50:40,542 --> 01:50:43,375
他是一个 稳重 勤奋的人

1347
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:45,875
那就最好不过了

1348
01:50:46,042 --> 01:50:49,000
- 你真这么认为的？- 好吧 我都不认识他

1349
01:50:49,167 --> 01:50:53,375
但从你的口吻中我听出了相互的信任还有一丝距离感

1350
01:50:54,792 --> 01:50:55,875
你说得很对

1351
01:50:56,917 --> 01:50:59,375
- 但你说漏了“爱” - 对不起

1352
01:50:59,792 --> 01:51:00,708
没事

1353
01:51:02,125 --> 01:51:04,375
我以前都没有和其他人说过

1354
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,250
那我很荣幸

1355
01:51:07,292 --> 01:51:08,583
我也没想到我会说出来

1356
01:51:18,792 --> 01:51:19,583
怎么了？

1357
01:51:20,125 --> 01:51:23,250
你把我认错成谁了？

1358
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:28,250
我的一个高中同学 男生一样的女生

1359
01:51:28,542 --> 01:51:30,208
你们两个很亲密吗？

1360
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:34,500
这倒不是 我们没有那么的亲密

1361
01:51:36,042 --> 01:51:40,250
她经常在午休的时候自个弹钢琴

1362
01:51:40,667 --> 01:51:44,375
那时钢琴也是我的一个爱好

1363
01:51:45,042 --> 01:51:48,625
所以午饭时间我们会不约而同地来到音乐室

1364
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:54,000
午休时 我们就轮流弹钢琴

1365
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:57,625
边吃边听着对方的钢琴

1366
01:51:58,542 --> 01:52:03,000
我们在班上不会说话 只在音​​乐室里说

1367
01:52:03,167 --> 01:52:05,458
- 多美好的回忆 - 嗯

1368
01:52:05,917 --> 01:52:07,708
很特别的回忆

1369
01:52:08,667 --> 01:52:11,500
她去东京后我们就没有再联系了

1370
01:52:15,042 --> 01:52:22,000
仙台站

1371
01:52:23,667 --> 01:52:24,500


1372
01:52:26,167 --> 01:52:28,250
不如再来一次角色扮演

1373
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,833
嗯 我从哪开始？

1374
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,333
这次换我要扮演你的钢琴家

1375
01:52:35,542 --> 01:52:37,250
但我已经记不太清楚了

1376
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:39,875
- 那就不公平了 - 为什么？

1377
01:52:40,042 --> 01:52:41,083
我开始啦

1378
01:52:42,917 --> 01:52:45,125
你从那边走过来

1379
01:52:45,292 --> 01:52:48,833
我从扶梯上来的时候我们遇见了 这样可以吗？

1380
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,125
跟个小品一样

1381
01:53:28,542 --> 01:53:29,375
绫？

1382
01:53:31,292 --> 01:53:32,500
是你吗？

1383
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,708
你认得我吗？

1384
01:53:37,292 --> 01:53:39,208
嗯 高中

1385
01:53:40,042 --> 01:53:42,500
不好意思 我记不起你的名字

1386
01:53:42,667 --> 01:53:44,208
没事

1387
01:53:44,792 --> 01:53:47,500
还记得我们一起弹钢琴吗？

1388
01:53:47,667 --> 01:53:48,583
当然记得

1389
01:53:49,125 --> 01:53:51,583
你怎么从东京回来了？

1390
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:55,375
回来同学聚会 我正要回去呢

1391
01:53:55,542 --> 01:53:58,125
为什么你被邀请了 我没有？

1392
01:53:58,292 --> 01:54:00,125
可不是吗？

1393
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:05,875
不过见到你真是太好了 我一直想知道你现在怎样

1394
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:07,250
真的吗？

1395
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,875
真的

1396
01:54:09,292 --> 01:54:14,375
太好了 我以为高中的同学都不记得我了

1397
01:54:14,542 --> 01:54:19,125
才不是呢 能和你说上话 我还偷偷窃喜呢

1398
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,083
- 是吗？- 嗯

1399
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:27,000
你那时候放荡不羁的 其实很多人想和你说上话

1400
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,250
- 真的吗？- 真的

1401
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:31,250
你令人钦佩

1402
01:54:31,542 --> 01:54:34,375
快别说了 再说下去我都快哭出来了

1403
01:54:37,667 --> 01:54:38,958
你还好吗？

1404
01:54:39,125 --> 01:54:44,000
我很好 虽然有些困难 但我每天都过得很充实

1405
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:47,500
很高兴看到你一点也没变

1406
01:54:48,042 --> 01:54:49,958
你呢？你还好吗？

1407
01:54:51,667 --> 01:54:55,458
我做不到像你一样

1408
01:54:55,667 --> 01:54:57,000
你身体不好吗？

1409
01:54:57,375 --> 01:54:59,250
- 我的身体很好 - 那么

1410
01:55:00,417 --> 01:55:02,958
没什么大问题

1411
01:55:03,875 --> 01:55:08,583
只是有时我想知道我为什么会在这里

1412
01:55:12,042 --> 01:55:17,125
回头才发现 这么多年来我好像什么也没做成

1413
01:55:18,542 --> 01:55:20,125
不过我还算是满意

1414
01:55:21,542 --> 01:55:23,750
这是我自己选的路

1415
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:27,833
而且我也知道人不能贪婪

1416
01:55:30,042 --> 01:55:30,875
但

1417
01:55:35,292 --> 01:55:39,625
我无法再对某件事情充满热情了

1418
01:55:42,917 --> 01:55:44,750
我不知道该怎么办

1419
01:55:46,250 --> 01:55:47,208
时间

1420
01:55:48,417 --> 01:55:50,250
慢慢地摧毁了我

1421
01:55:58,125 --> 01:56:01,000
很抱歉我突然说这些

1422
01:56:02,042 --> 01:56:02,875
没关系

1423
01:56:05,417 --> 01:56:08,500
我能告诉你我当时对你的看法吗？

1424
01:56:09,917 --> 01:56:10,708
嗯

1425
01:56:12,042 --> 01:56:16,875
你说大伙都很钦佩我 其实不然

1426
01:56:17,417 --> 01:56:22,875
我当时可不是这么看的 反而感觉大家都躲着我

1427
01:56:24,292 --> 01:56:27,833
我总觉得自己是个弃儿

1428
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:32,250
不过你是唯一的愿意来和我说说话的人

1429
01:56:32,792 --> 01:56:36,708
虽然只是小小的举动 但对我来说意义非凡

1430
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:43,208
你是我唯一的光 所以无论你在哪 我都能找到你

1431
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,208
你的存在给了我力量

1432
01:56:50,167 --> 01:56:51,125
这是真的

1433
01:56:51,292 --> 01:56:55,250
你有可以赋予人力量的能力

1434
01:56:55,417 --> 01:56:57,083
请记住这点

1435
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:00,375
嗯

1436
01:57:02,542 --> 01:57:06,875
但我没有说每个人都钦佩你

1437
01:57:07,167 --> 01:57:07,958
嗯？

1438
01:57:08,542 --> 01:57:10,750
我很欣赏你

1439
01:57:17,875 --> 01:57:18,833
谢谢

1440
01:57:22,917 --> 01:57:24,500
我很高兴能够认识你

1441
01:57:26,167 --> 01:57:28,833
我也很高兴认识你

1442
01:57:33,042 --> 01:57:33,750
那么

1443
01:57:35,167 --> 01:57:35,958
再见

1444
01:57:37,542 --> 01:57:38,250
再见

1445
01:58:52,667 --> 01:58:54,000
- 不好意思 - 怎么了？

1446
01:58:55,667 --> 01:58:58,250
- 没什么 - 那怎么了？

1447
01:58:58,875 --> 01:59:01,125
但我可以告诉你

1448
01:59:01,292 --> 01:59:02,625
告诉我什么

1449
01:59:03,292 --> 01:59:05,125
- 我记起来了 - 什么？

1450
01:59:05,292 --> 01:59:06,250
她的名字

1451
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:09,875
叫希美

1452
01:59:10,625 --> 01:59:11,583
希美？

1453
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,958
希美

1454
01:59:19,292 --> 01:59:20,250
她的姓氏呢？

1455
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:21,875
记不起来了

1456
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,750
<i>Ryusuke Hamaguchi's Short Stories
Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy</i>

1457
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:38,083
<i>Episode 1: Magic</i>
<i>(or Something Less Assuring)</i>

1458
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:06,583
Really pretty!

1459
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,958
I like the eyelashes
reflecting the light.

1460
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,708
Let's try the hat.

1461
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,500
- There's something here.
- Thanks.

1462
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:38,625
Okay. Let me take a look now.

1463
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,500
Give us a minute, please.

1464
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,875
- Good.
- Yep.

1465
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,833
- They're very good.
- Yes.

1466
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:58,708
- I'm happy with these. You guys?
- Yep. Me, too.

1467
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,500
- Okay!
- Good job, everyone!

1468
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,208
Yay, we're done!

1469
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:17,375
- Thank you, bye.
- Take care!

1470
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,708
- Ride with me.
- Is it okay?

1471
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,750
- See you later.
- See you!

1472
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:31,208
- Take care.
- Thanks, bye.

1473
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,000
What?!

1474
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,375
You just met him!
How'd you click so well?

1475
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:57,125
Well, at some point,
he started saying...

1476
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,458
"Tsu, you're not
who I thought you were."

1477
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,750
"Tsu"?

1478
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,125
The bar owner suggested
nicknames for us,

1479
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:10,250
"Tsu" for Tsugumi, "Ka" for Kazuaki.

1480
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:17,333
So, I asked him
what he thought of me initially.

1481
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,708
He thought I was beautiful when we met.

1482
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,458
- Yup...
- Well, well...

1483
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:27,375
But he was under the impression
that I was aloof

1484
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,250
because of our email exchanges
before we met.

1485
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:35,208
That's the way business communication
should be.

1486
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:38,125
But you know how friendly I am.

1487
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:42,500
So, he was like,
"The contrast blew me away."

1488
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:49,375
Then I said, "Hang on.
You're a fine one to talk."

1489
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,250
Honestly, he seemed like a player.

1490
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,875
- A player!
- Well, not exactly.

1491
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,125
I should say, he's a hottie.

1492
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:02,458
- A hottie isn't the same as a player.
- I mean...

1493
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,708
He struck me as a ladies' man at times,

1494
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,250
but not in a negative way.

1495
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:11,500
He says his home office is in Aoyama.

1496
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,000
That's players' haven!

1497
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,083
Hmm, I don't know about that.

1498
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:18,000
What does he do?

1499
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:21,750
He heads an interior design company
and invests.

1500
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,750
Now he sounds...like a player.

1501
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,500
Really, Gumi?
You don't like players.

1502
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,250
I know. I'm surprised that
I find his company so much fun.

1503
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:38,500
I see.

1504
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:44,000
I declined the business offer
and he accepted.

1505
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,208
But we kept chatting and
two hours passed before we knew it.

1506
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:54,250
Then, it went from "Wanna grab coffee?"
to "Do you drink?"

1507
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,250
And we missed the last train.

1508
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:00,125
Amazing. How long were you together?

1509
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:04,125
The meeting started at 1 PM,
so 15 hours all together.

1510
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,875
- No way!
- I know.

1511
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:10,708
Somehow, we started talking
about our childhoods.

1512
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:16,000
We found we had similar upbringings
and moved around a lot.

1513
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:22,250
We quickly realized that's why we both
approach people from a distance.

1514
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:28,375
I told him about things
I've never told anybody,

1515
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:32,583
not even to you, Meiko,
and he did the same.

1516
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,583
Maybe he was mirroring me to be nice.

1517
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:38,708
But...

1518
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:44,750
I could sense that
I touched something deep within him...

1519
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:50,125
and I felt he touched me
deep within, too.

1520
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,458
That sounds...erotic.

1521
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,708
Doesn't it?

1522
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:01,083
Honestly, I felt something
very erotic about it.

1523
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:06,958
I didn't know conversations
could be this erotic.

1524
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,208
- Did you talk dirty?
- No.

1525
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:12,333
No dirty talk, no physical touching.

1526
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,708
I don't get it.

1527
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:20,875
But we caressed each other
through our conversation.

1528
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,750
That's damn erotic.

1529
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,208
We ended up talking about
what we'd be like as a couple.

1530
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,750
- You guys are in love!
- I guess.

1531
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:35,375
We both sensed
we were falling for each other,

1532
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:39,833
or at least we got along really well.

1533
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,708
In fact, we thought,
we can do it.

1534
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:46,750
That's not dirty?

1535
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,500
No. Our talk flowed naturally
in that direction.

1536
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,000
You're so mature!

1537
00:06:54,292 --> 00:07:00,500
But we were like, "Nah, not today."
So, we said goodbye and took taxis home.

1538
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,000
What? Why not?

1539
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,333
- No, no, no...
- No?

1540
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,625
Is sex on the first date common?

1541
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:12,625
I don't know, but in your case,
you could have.

1542
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,125
Hmm, you're right about that.

1543
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,375
How about you, Meiko?
Have you ever...?

1544
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,000
What do you mean?

1545
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:23,000
Doing it on the first date.

1546
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,500
No, not the first date.

1547
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,250
The second or third time?

1548
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:30,208
Yeah, that happens.

1549
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,833
- Never done it?
- No.

1550
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,500
I can't. That's too fast for me.

1551
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,500
Most guys want it by the third time.

1552
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,583
I know. So, I put them in
"the players" basket.

1553
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,375
Gumi, you're harsh!

1554
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:48,625
- You and I are different on this one.
- Yup.

1555
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,708
To be honest...

1556
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,583
it wasn't a bad idea.

1557
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,500
I've never felt I could
on the first date.

1558
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,125
Actually, I wanted to.

1559
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:08,125
I wondered what we'd be like afterwards.

1560
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,625
If the convo was that good...

1561
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:15,250
I thought about consequences
and felt a bit unsure.

1562
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:19,125
But I think I was giving him signals.

1563
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,083
What kinda signals?

1564
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,875
I won't tell you. I can't.

1565
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:26,375
- Oh, c'mon!
- It just happened in that moment.

1566
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:34,625
You know...it was him who held back.

1567
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,583
He couldn't get it up?

1568
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,750
- Oh, shush!
- Ow!

1569
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,125
In a nutshell,

1570
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:48,000
he couldn't bring himself
to it mentally.

1571
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,375
He said...

1572
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,833
him and his ex broke up
because she cheated.

1573
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,500
Ah...that sounds familiar...

1574
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,833
Yeah, cheater! Apologize.

1575
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,500
Let us pray for forgiveness.

1576
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:10,875
And you know, he got cheated on
more than once.

1577
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,125
Uh-huh...

1578
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:16,875
But he loved her so much and

1579
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,375
it was so painful that
he probably can't love again.

1580
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,375
When did that happen?

1581
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,500
About two years ago.

1582
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,833
- He's dwelling on it too long!
- I know! But...

1583
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,625
I can empathize with that.

1584
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,125
I see.

1585
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:40,375
He also said he had lots of fun
with me but feels unprepared,

1586
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,375
this came out of left field.

1587
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,500
It excited him but

1588
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:52,000
it also made him realize
he's scared of falling in love.

1589
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:57,333
He said I reminded him of his ex.

1590
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:00,000
- You look like her?
- No.

1591
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,958
It wasn't my face or personality.

1592
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,750
But, he'd never...

1593
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,833
felt so at ease talking to someone.

1594
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,125
Then, he remembered that he was never
able to talk like this with his ex.

1595
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,833
Hmm...at ease...

1596
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:24,625
Yeah, it caught my mind,
so I said,

1597
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,083
"Feeling at ease isn't
the same as romance."

1598
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,083
What'd he say?

1599
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,000
"What do you think, Tsu?"

1600
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,208
How annoying.

1601
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,500
It's hard to explain the nuances.

1602
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:47,625
We spent a really magical time together

1603
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:53,208
and both felt we'd never
had an experience like it.

1604
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:59,083
He said that, for us who have
always kept others at bay,

1605
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,625
our paths crossing is special.

1606
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:06,000
And I knew that he meant
what he said.

1607
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:14,500
Then, he suggested we leave each other
at that and call it a day.

1608
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,875
He said, "If the magic is gone
next time we meet, then let it be."

1609
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,208
Magic, huh?

1610
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:26,000
The word was perfect for us.

1611
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,375
He said, "I honestly had
the best day of my life."

1612
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:36,000
"It'll be great if our next meeting
turns out even better."

1613
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:40,625
"I feel optimistic about us.
Let's hope we make it."

1614
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,750
Then, we shook hands goodbye.

1615
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:43,958
Seriously?

1616
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,375
Are you scared about next time?

1617
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,208
I am...very much so.

1618
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,375
And yet I want to see him. Soon.

1619
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,625
Gumi, you look lovely.

1620
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're glowing right now.

1621
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:13,750
Thanks.

1622
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1623
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,000
Thanks a lot.

1624
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,583
- Good night.
- See you.

1625
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,125
Excuse me.

1626
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,708
Do you mind going back the same way?

1627
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:29,458
Is the president in?

1628
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,500
- Pardon?
- May I come in?

1629
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,250
And you are...?

1630
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,750
I'm his friend.

1631
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,375
Excuse me.

1632
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,500
Yes?

1633
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,708
I need a word.

1634
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:49,000
Ms. Morita, you can go.

1635
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,583
But...

1636
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,958
I'll be fine. I can do the rest myself.

1637
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,083
Sure.

1638
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,625
- Good night.
- Good night.

1639
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:11,958
Good night.

1640
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,500
Cute.

1641
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:25,250
What?

1642
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,500
You've moved your office.

1643
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,250
The old one was cute, too.

1644
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,250
Where's your bed now?

1645
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,625
Upstairs.

1646
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,250
I see.

1647
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,708
You look successful.

1648
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,250
What do you want to talk about?

1649
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:50,000
I heard you started investing.

1650
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,250
Can you handle that?
I never saw you as the type.

1651
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,083
Who told you that?

1652
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,250
You two spent a magical time together.

1653
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,333
"Tsu" and "Ka"?

1654
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:08,625
You guys are lame.

1655
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,750
You know her?

1656
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,000
You mean, Gumi?

1657
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,625
My best friend.

1658
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:17,958
"Gumi"?

1659
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:22,875
Because she's Tsugumi.
We had a shoot today.

1660
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,708
Are you surprised?

1661
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:35,875
Surprised? It's rather hard to believe.

1662
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,875
What's so hard to believe?

1663
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,875
She told you about me?

1664
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,625
Not exactly.

1665
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,583
I realized she was talking about you.

1666
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,375
Did you tell her about us?

1667
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,375
No, I didn't. How could I?

1668
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:52,750
Right.

1669
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,625
Are you in love with Gumi?

1670
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,000
- I don't know yet.
- How can you not?

1671
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:04,875
"A magical time"?

1672
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,250
"The best day of my life"?

1673
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,250
Hey, stop that.

1674
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,750
You think I'm jealous?

1675
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,583
- Aren't you?
- Not at all.

1676
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,125
I'm not at all in love with you, Kazu.

1677
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,458
You've hardly crossed my mind.

1678
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:21,958
You got it easy.

1679
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,875
You passed yourself off as

1680
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:29,125
this traumatized guy who got cheated on.

1681
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,958
Did she say that?

1682
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,000
No. Partly my interpretation.

1683
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,500
Who are you to probe into that night?

1684
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
"That night"?

1685
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:50,000
Leave. You're acting like a stalker.
You're insane.

1686
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:52,375
Don't worry.

1687
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:55,875
I'm aware of my insane behavior.

1688
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,000
You're operating normally, then.

1689
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,125
- You know me.
- Why'd you come?

1690
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,125
Want to know?

1691
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,208
I need to. I'm scared.

1692
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,625
To tell the truth, I don't know.

1693
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,250
Huh?

1694
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:18,125
But there's nobody else
I can talk to about this.

1695
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,250
Not Gumi, of course.

1696
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:25,333
And I knew you'd listen to me
even after two years.

1697
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,958
- How have you been?
- Listen to what?

1698
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,500
I don't know.

1699
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,833
But you used to enjoy hearing
what I had to say.

1700
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,125
How've you been?

1701
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,458
What do you want to know?

1702
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:53,250
I got so pissed off when I heard
about you and her.

1703
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,875
I felt sad, too.

1704
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,625
But I'm not in love with you now.

1705
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,208
- And you...
- Don't.

1706
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:05,625
Maybe it's the loss of someone
I believed was mine.

1707
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,583
I don't belong to you.

1708
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,208
I'm talking about Gumi.

1709
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:13,250
Look, woman.
That girl's not yours, either.

1710
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,333
Why'd you just call me "woman"?

1711
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:19,250
You've never spoke like that to me.

1712
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,500
Say it again and I'll leave.

1713
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:25,208
Woman. Leave.

1714
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:33,458
Also, I don't like how you
refer to Gumi as "that girl."

1715
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:38,958
- Ms. Konno doesn't belong to you.
- What do you want?

1716
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know yet.

1717
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,083
Are you going to
sleep with her next time?

1718
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,125
That's none of your business.

1719
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,375
You're in for an ordinary,
boring relationship.

1720
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,875
What are you saying?

1721
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,500
You're gonna cry over that
enchanting first date...

1722
00:19:58,667 --> 00:19:59,750
Are you cursing me?

1723
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,875
- Maybe.
- What the hell?

1724
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,708
Are you mad at me?

1725
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,125
I'm not sure if I'm mad at you,

1726
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,458
but maybe I am.

1727
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,583
Then, at Tsugumi?

1728
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,708
- Tsu's not at fault.
- Don't call her Tsu.

1729
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:20,458
Well...

1730
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,625
If I'm mad,
I'm probably mad at our fate.

1731
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:25,583
Fate?

1732
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,250
Our fate's nobody's fault.

1733
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:33,750
If there's anyone evil in this story,
it's you.

1734
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,375
Why? Because I cheated on you?

1735
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,625
You not only cheated but...

1736
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,125
But...?

1737
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,125
Your motive was disgusting.

1738
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,083
You wanted to experience
sex with a rich man.

1739
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,250
Yeah, I totally said that.

1740
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,333
You're despicable.

1741
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,833
Yeah, but that's because
you kept probing.

1742
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,458
I wasn't ready to verbalize my thoughts
but you forced me.

1743
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,625
- The words didn't feel right.
- And the truth?

1744
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,125
Sexual frustration.

1745
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,458
And curiosity.

1746
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:13,750
You called me evil,

1747
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:17,500
but what about you for leaving
me frustrated?

1748
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:22,500
- I'm not your dildo.
- Dildos are better. Be humble.

1749
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,958
What? You frightened me!

1750
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,833
- Was that even yours?
- Leave.

1751
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,375
I might lose control and kill you.

1752
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,500
Then you'll never see Tsu again.

1753
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,125
- Where are you going?
- Let go! I'm leaving.

1754
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:43,375
- You live here.
- Get lost!

1755
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,125
- Running away again?
- Yeah!

1756
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:47,375
Why do you keep hurting me?

1757
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,625
Don't know. It might be love.

1758
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:55,708
When I was a kid,
I hurt the boys I liked.

1759
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:58,875
Stop. I'll never let you fool me again.

1760
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,625
I <i>might</i> love you.

1761
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,708
- But I doubt it.
- What?

1762
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,750
Isn't this fun?

1763
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:10,500
- Not at all.
- There's rhythm in our spats.

1764
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,250
Like the old days.

1765
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,333
You're just pissed off about losing
the man you thought was yours.

1766
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,583
You're only repeating what I said.

1767
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,875
You've always had to have me loving you,

1768
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,583
even after we separated,
even if you don't love me.

1769
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,583
Yeah...maybe.

1770
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,375
So leave.

1771
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:35,000
We can't be together.
At least, I can't.

1772
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,208
I see, but why is that?

1773
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,750
I can't stand you.

1774
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:42,000
But "you loved me so much."

1775
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,333
I heard it from Gumi.

1776
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,625
And you were devastated.

1777
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,958
But Kazu,
I bet you've never imagined...

1778
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:00,958
What?

1779
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:07,750
How badly I got hurt from hurting you.

1780
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:17,083
No, no... Hold on.

1781
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:18,833
That's too easy.

1782
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:21,625
I can't help it, I love you.

1783
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,250
I always have.

1784
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,333
What about Gumi?

1785
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,750
I told you I don't know yet.

1786
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:35,125
My feelings for her are different.

1787
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:40,125
If you hug me, Tsugumi will vanish.
Is that okay?

1788
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,500
And I can't guarantee
I'll become yours.

1789
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,750
You might lose both.

1790
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,500
I can't promise anything.

1791
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,833
That's who I am. Can you accept me?

1792
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,833
I'm about to puke.

1793
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,833
Have you always loved me? All this time?

1794
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,000
I wonder...

1795
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,625
- You just said so.
- On impulse.

1796
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:17,125
The truth sometimes
comes out impulsively.

1797
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,750
I came here on impulse.

1798
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,208
It's anything but the truth with you.

1799
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,208
You think so?

1800
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,750
At least, nothing assuring.

1801
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,958
Right. Because I don't know.

1802
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:38,250
- Why are you here?
- Are you sure about yourself?

1803
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:45,750
Because you're not,
you're half-hearted about Gumi.

1804
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:53,000
I really like Gumi.

1805
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,250
She's amazing.

1806
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,083
I think you're a good match.

1807
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,250
But she's hard work.

1808
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,250
She can be hardheaded.

1809
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,333
I've gathered.

1810
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:12,000
You and Gumi are similar.

1811
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,500
You might be right.

1812
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:17,875
That's quite true.

1813
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,875
What is it you loved about me?

1814
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,333
That you're honest.

1815
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:33,750
Yeah, I am...

1816
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:39,625
You were a trustworthy person, Meiko.

1817
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,583
But I cheated on you.

1818
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,875
Was it cheating?

1819
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,958
I tried not to see you as my belonging.

1820
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:53,375
So that you wouldn't get hurt.

1821
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,625
Can't you let that slide?

1822
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,083
Did you ever, even once,
try to truly face me?

1823
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,833
I tried to understand you.

1824
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,208
I listened to you as much as I could.

1825
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,000
Answer my question.

1826
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,500
How do you mean "truly face"?

1827
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:22,500
If you don't know, you'll repeat
the same mistakes with Tsugumi

1828
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,208
and end up hurting her in the end.

1829
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,500
Did you get hurt?

1830
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,000
Yup.

1831
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,125
Why?

1832
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:40,833
All I can do is hurt the ones I love.

1833
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:45,500
Love's supposed to make people happy.

1834
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,250
We had happy times.

1835
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,333
I feel like a defective product.

1836
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,458
You're not the only one.

1837
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,833
I'm not even a dildo.

1838
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,625
Because you're so kind...

1839
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,333
you're not for me.

1840
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,375
- You and Gumi will make a nice couple.
- I know.

1841
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:27,708
Kazu.

1842
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,958
Would you dare to believe in...

1843
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:36,875
something less assuring than magic?

1844
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:59,958
Sorry. I forgot my laptop.

1845
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,583
Is she the woman you said
you had on your mind?

1846
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,750
No, she isn't.

1847
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,000
Then, why chase her?

1848
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,000
Is it bad?

1849
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,625
Of course it is.

1850
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:52,208
<i>Three days later...</i>

1851
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:13,000
Gumi, did something good happen?

1852
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,208
Why?

1853
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,500
You look extra pretty.

1854
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:19,708
What?

1855
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:25,083
The guy I told you about
asked me out tonight.

1856
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,583
He wants to meet me for a chat.

1857
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,125
I see.

1858
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,833
No way!

1859
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,750
That's him.

1860
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,625
- I'll go.
- Stay!

1861
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:56,750
I want to know what you think.

1862
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,625
Over here!

1863
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,875
What a surprise!
Sorry for stopping you.

1864
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:11,333
Oh, this is my friend, Meiko.
And this is Mr. Kubota.

1865
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,458
Sorry, I already told her about you.

1866
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:23,750
Have you decided?

1867
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,000
What?

1868
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,125
Who's it gonna be, Kazu?

1869
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:34,750
Sorry, Gumi.

1870
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,750
I'm his ex-girlfriend.

1871
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:42,625
A terrible coincidence, isn't it?
It's so funny.

1872
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:51,125
I went to see him right after we spoke.

1873
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It felt as if the two years
vanished in an instant.

1874
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,625
It was like magic.

1875
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,333
Then, I realized...

1876
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,875
I love you, Kazu.

1877
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,625
With all my heart,

1878
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,500
all I desire is you.

1879
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,958
I can't imagine life without you.

1880
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:25,875
I realized that your encounter with Gumi
was the magic meant for us.

1881
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:32,583
You must have realized that, too.

1882
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,375
Meet my friend, Meiko.

1883
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,958
And this is Mr. Kubota.

1884
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,500
Sorry, I already told her about you.

1885
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,250
I'll go.

1886
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,708
Huh? Stay!

1887
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,250
C'mon, I know social etiquette.

1888
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,875
Will you take care of this?

1889
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,750
Nice couple!

1890
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,250
Oh, stop.

1891
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:16,125
I got this.

1892
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:17,625
Oh, no. Don't...

1893
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:21,500
Please, let me.
And then we'll go somewhere.

1894
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,083
Okay. Where to?

1895
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:54,083
<i>Episode 2: Door Wide Open</i>

1896

Now, what makes a person feel distant?

1898
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,250
Please discuss amongst yourselves.

1899
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:22,833

Please!

1901

I'm begging you!

1902
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,125
Get up.

1903
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,500
My future depends on you.

1904
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,583
It'll affect my job!

1905
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,500
I don't care.

Please! Why won't you help me?

1908
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,208
You ought to be ashamed.

Um, excuse me...Professor Segawa.

1910
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:09,875
Leave it open.

1911
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:12,833
It looks like harassment.

1912
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:17,375
More so with the door closed.
Please leave it open.

1913
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,875
Nothing to see here.

1914

You're so young.

Dressed already?

1922
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,375
I have to pick up my kid.

1923
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,750
- You still have time.
- You showered.

1924
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:54,000
I can take cold showers all day.

1925

00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:08,458
Hm?

1927
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,875
I got held back a year.
Why would I go?

1928
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:15,958
At least you got invited, unlike me.

1929
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:22,000
I forgot they left you out of

Woah. That hurt.

1931
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,875
It's funny though.

1932
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:32,375
Do you even care that
your words could hurt me?

1933

Do they?

1934
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:38,833
Who cares.

1935
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:42,750
It's not like I want to be hated.

1936

- Maybe it's my fault that...
- Of course it is.

1937
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:51,625
You don't go with the flow
and you put up a wall.

A wall? Me?

1939
00:39:56,042 --> 00:40:00,375
Everyone says it feels like
you look down on them.

You've got me.

1949
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:36,000

00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:15,125
<i>What was he like?</i>

1973
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,125
<i>Very strict. I wasn't the best student.</i>

1974
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,250
Hey.

1975
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,750
Read this part.

1976
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:31,125
Hello?

1977
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:42,250
French is mandatory to graduate,
so it's your own fault.

1978
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,625
Araki was gonna let me pass just for
showing, but she had to get pregnant.

1979
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,250
Geez.

1980
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:55,250
- I'm glad you didn't get the job.
- Why?

1981
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:56,833
Just because.

1982
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,375
Well, no one'll hire me.

1983
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,750
Not even local stations.

1984
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:14,375
What the hell? He's such a creep.

1985
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,458
I thought Professor Segawa
was all shriveled up.

1986
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:24,875
But I'm glad, and it kinda turned me on.

1987
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:27,625
Really?

1988
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,500
I just had an idea.

1989
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:39,125
What?

1990
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:40,750
A honeytrap.

1991
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:44,750
Honeytrap the professor?

1992
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:48,458
Yeah. You gotta help me, Nao.

1993
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:49,875
Why?

1994
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:56,583
He killed my future,
so I wanna return the favor.

1995
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,750
Fair, right?

1996
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:04,083
Nuh-uh. I like him.

1997
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,375
Are you serious?

1998
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:10,000
More than sex with me?

1999
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,875
What the heck?

2000
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:20,083
No help, no sex. This is goodbye.

2001
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:21,458
Huh?

2002
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,875
I'll ignore you on campus.

2003
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:30,500
- You do that now.
- I'll shut you out.

2004
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,375
Poor thing.

2005
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,375
Come on.

2006
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:47,583
You're the only one I can ask.

2007
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:50,458
I wanna keep doing it with you.

2008
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:52,875
Then no honeytraps.

2009
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:07,083
Our bodies are perfectly compatible.

2010
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,875
So, pretty please.

2011
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:14,625
- I have to go.
- Come on.

2012
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:17,000
Help me feel better.

2013
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:21,875
Stop.

2014
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:31,458
Oh, Miss Murayama.

2015
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,833
You remember me?

2016
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:39,125
Of course. How can I help?

2017
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:47,125
Um, congratulations on
the Akutagawa Prize.

2018
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:50,500
Thank you.

2019
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:54,750
May I have your autograph?

2020
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:57,083
Oh, sure.

2021
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,625
I really enjoyed it.

2022
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:03,375
Thank you. Come in.

2023
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:10,250
Sorry. Please leave it open.

2024
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,500
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

2025
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,958
That's all right.

2026
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:32,833
Can you sign right here?

2027
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,208
Not the cover?

2028
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:41,583
I really love the picture that
you've painted here.

2029
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:46,750
Your signature here would
make me happy every time I read it.

2030
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:49,958
Is that okay?

2031
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,750
Yes...of course.

2032
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:14,250
Thank you so much.

2033
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:18,250
No, thank you.

2034
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:20,250
Wow.

2035
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:26,458
I'm really happy that
you won, Professor.

2036
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:31,000
I was in your French class
my first and second year.

2037
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:33,250
Yes, I remember.

2038
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,250
That was over a year ago...

2039
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,000
I'm impressed.

2040
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:41,625
Well, you stood out.

2041
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:48,083
Right. I'm much older
than everyone else.

2042
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,250
No, not for that reason.

2043
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,458
You asked many questions
during and after class.

2044
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:58,125
Yes, that's me.

2045
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:02,708
I especially enjoyed your classes.

2046
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:06,833
You're very thorough,
and your French is beautiful.

2047
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,750
Not at all.

2048
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:16,583
Um, if you have time,
and you don't mind...

2049
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,125
Yes?

2050
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:22,875
May I ask you questions
about your book?

2051
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:26,250
Oh, sure.

2052
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:29,125
Are you busy now?

2053
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,375
No, I'm free.

2054
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:38,375
- Would you like to go to a cafe?
- No, here is fine.

2055
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,000
I'll pour us tea.

2056
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:45,375
- You don't have to.
- It's all right.

2057
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,250
Please sit.

2058
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:51,875
So what year are you now?

2059
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:56,583
Fourth. Time really does fly.

2060
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,125
Do you have a job lined up?

2061
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,250
Not exactly.

2062
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:06,875
- I'll just be a housewife again.
- So you're married?

2063
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,125
Yes. I have a daughter too.

2064
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:14,125
Going back to school
must've been difficult.

2065
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,500
I wanted to study psychology.

2066
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:21,250
Here you go.
It's quite humid.

2067
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:23,708
Thank you.

2068
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:31,250
Grad school is out of the question,
so I won't be able to finish.

2069
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,208
I see.

2070
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:38,000
Enough about me.
I want to hear about you.

2071
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:43,750
- But I don't know what to ask...
- Anything.

2072
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:51,708
Do you have a family?
Are you married?

2073
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,125
No, I'm single.

2074
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,500
I'm sorry. You meant
anything about your book.

2075
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,708
I did think of questions.

2076
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:11,375
About the scene
on this page you autographed...

2077
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:16,500
It's very fascinating.

2078
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:25,833
"I held myself upright
with the back of my hand"

2079
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:30,958
"so that it wouldn't get in the way
while she shaved me."

2080
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:38,208
"She treated my testicles like
a little bird with a broken wing."

2081
00:51:40,042 --> 00:51:46,250
"She had little interest in my penis
and only occasionally supported it"

2082
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:50,083
"with the back of her hand
as she shaved."

2083
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:54,375
"My penis gradually stiffened."

2084
00:51:55,250 --> 00:52:00,833
"But she kept sliding the razor
at a constant speed"

2085
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,500
"over the tight skin of my testicles."

2086
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,250
"After shaving,"

2087
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:15,250
"she gently washed off the shaving cream
with a towel seeped in lukewarm water."

2088
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:19,083
"Not to leave any hairs behind,"

2089
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,750
"she carefully went between
my testicles and the metal wash basin."

2090
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:36,250
"After the last wipe, when nothing stood
between her and my smooth testicles,"

2091
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:40,333
"she smiled proudly for the first time."

2092
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:47,875
"Then she opened her mouth to the extent
her craftsmanship wasn't undermined,"

2093
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:52,458
"and placed my right testicle
in her mouth."

2094
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:02,125
"My penis was so stiff that it
no longer needed to be supported,"

2095
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:07,500
"but she turned her palm
and gently held it up."

2096
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,875
"I felt nothing but her courtesy"

2097
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:18,458
"so nothing would interfere while
she had my testicle in her mouth."

2098
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:24,458
"Just as a carpenter measures
a bolt with a caliper,"

2099
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:31,583
"she tried to match the size
of her mouth and my testicle."

2100
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:37,375
"Every time she opened her mouth wide,"

2101
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:45,375
"I hoped my testicle would
expand enough to fill the gaps."

2102
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:46,875
Pardon me.

2103
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:19,458
"Other than to wipe her drool,
she focused on measuring"

2104
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:27,083
"the size of my right testicle as she
moved her chin and tongue up and down."

2105
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,208
"Seeing her simply work,"

2106
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:39,125
"I felt utterly embarrassed
of my stiff penis."

2107
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:45,208
"My humiliation and its hardness
were proportionate,"

2108
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:49,000
"and the shame turned into aching pain."

2109
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:58,708
"The moment she inhaled a particularly
big breath with drool, I ejaculated."

2110
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:03,250
"She let go of my right testicle."

2111
00:55:04,042 --> 00:55:07,583
"While holding my withering penis
in her left hand,"

2112
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:13,750
"she said, 'I'm sorry.'
without taking a single look at me."

2113
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:18,125
"She slowly opened her mouth again,"

2114
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:22,375
"swallowed my left testicle,
and began measuring."

2115
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,625
"With my penis still withered,
I ejaculated once more."

2116
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:33,875
"Before she could apologize,"

2117
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:38,208
"I knelt and touched the floor
with my forehead."

2118
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:43,708
"Tears welled. I continued to tremble."

2119
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:47,958
"I let my fluids flow for a while."

2120
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:57,750
Professor...

2121
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:00,250
Yes?

2122
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:04,875
What makes you write like this?

2123
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:07,625
What...

2124
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,333
The answer is complex.

2125
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:16,875
Complex?

2126
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,750
First is story structure.

2127
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:25,125
Simply put, it appeals to
a certain type of readers.

2128
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:28,750
Having this appear in the middle,

2129
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:34,333
I figured readers would want to
continue reading until the end.

2130
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:38,458
One judge strongly rejected my book.

2131
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:43,750
She said this scene
cheapened the novel greatly.

2132
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,833
Perhaps it's true.

2133
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:50,250
I liked this scene.

2134
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:55,625
I got the impression that
you enjoyed writing this part.

2135
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,208
Perhaps.

2136
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:04,083
However, it's what the words wanted,
rather than what I wanted.

2137
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:06,500
The words?

2138
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,750
That's my other reason.

2139
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:14,000
Their arrangement is determined by
their relationship.

2140
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:19,208
Words ask for words,
which is different from what I ask for.

2141
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:24,500
If the resulting sequence of words
is correct by my standards,

2142
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,125
I leave them as is.

2143
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:31,250
Were you erect as you wrote this?

2144
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:36,375
Perhaps...

2145
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,375
I thought so.

2146
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:48,375
I think I must be.
That's what the scene should evoke.

2147
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:50,750
Of course.

2148
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:11,375
I was happy to read this excerpt.

2149
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:13,833
How so?

2150
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:18,500
I'm weak when it comes to sex.

2151
00:58:19,292 --> 00:58:20,625
You are?

2152
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:22,625
Yes.

2153
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,875
I often lose to sexual temptation.

2154
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,500
- Often?
- Yes.

2155
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:35,125
I can't refuse men I feel attracted to.

2156
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,500
I'm in a few relationships now.

2157
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:52,333
What I wanted to say is that maybe
you have the same weakness.

2158
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:55,875
Like giving into sexual temptation?

2159
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,500
Yes.

2160
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:02,000
Well, perhaps.

2161
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:08,333
To write a novel, you also need to
make the most of your weaknesses.

2162
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:13,333
Have you ever given in?

2163
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:20,625
My life is quite boring.
I've never encountered any temptations.

2164
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:24,333
If I had, I would've
immediately tripped.

2165
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:30,000
Can someone who's lived
a boring life write a novel?

2166
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:37,500
I merely maximize
what can be expressed in words.

2167
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,500
There's no room for my experiences.

2168
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:45,375
The words resonate with
the reader's experience.

2169
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,458
For example, your experience.

2170
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,208
My experience?

2171
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:57,083
Pardon my intrusiveness,

2172
00:59:57,542 --> 01:00:00,250
but you said sex is your weakness.

2173
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:02,583
Yes.

2174
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,875
Are you concerned about that?

2175
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:12,500
If you are, perhaps you should be
speaking to a counselor, not me.

2176
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:21,375
I'm scared that my husband
may find out some day.

2177
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:26,000
But personality-wise,
I'm not too worried

2178
01:00:26,792 --> 01:00:29,000
since I'm not addicted to it.

2179
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:35,875
I just feel I simply need
slightly stronger will power.

2180
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:41,000
To me, you seem to have
a very strong will power,

2181
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:44,333
compared to other students.

2182
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:47,250
Thank you.

2183
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:51,458
- I am much older.
- No.

2184
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:56,000
It's not about age, it's about talent.

2185
01:00:57,542 --> 01:01:00,375
What sort of talent would that be?

2186
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,000
Your ability to be indescribable
and remain undefined.

2187
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:15,208
Simply put, you can think and act
without being bound by common sense.

2188
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:19,750
That's very difficult,
especially in Japanese society.

2189
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:23,458
It's not that big of a deal.

2190
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:29,375
My libido is just stronger than others,
or my self-control is weaker.

2191
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:33,875
I don't fit well with
other people's standards.

2192
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:38,583
That's what I'm saying.
I think it's wonderful.

2193
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:41,083
Is it?

2194
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:47,833
I've never thought
I was better than others in any way.

2195
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:52,208
I think that's also
a sign of your intelligence.

2196
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:58,958
You're amazing, Professor.

2197
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:01,000
How so?

2198
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:05,458
Nobody's ever been this sure about me.

2199
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:07,500
Is that so?

2200
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:13,250
But I disagree. I'm a fool.

2201
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:18,750
If so, please persuade me
because I don't think so.

2202
01:02:20,292 --> 01:02:26,125
That'll take a while since
I'd have to start with my childhood.

2203
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,958
You'd probably tell me to
see a counselor again.

2204
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,958
I apologize for my rudeness.

2205
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:38,000
However, counseling is not a bad thing.

2206
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:39,875
I agree.

2207
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:43,750
I should go one day.

2208
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:52,708
I think this is all I need
to prove my foolishness.

2209
01:02:54,667 --> 01:03:01,500
Did you know that I was trying
to tempt you this entire time?

2210
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:06,500
No, it never crossed my mind.

2211
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,458
Then what did you think was happening?

2212
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:15,458
I just thought you were very strange.

2213
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:23,625
To be honest, I was a little scared.

2214
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:27,500
I'd be scared too.

2215
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:34,625
I think I was wary because
I didn't understand your behavior.

2216
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,708
I was trying to seduce you.

2217
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:43,875
My aim was to elicit
statements and actions

2218
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,958
that would lead you to seduce me.

2219
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,000
What for?

2220
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:55,125
To record it and sell it to the media.

2221
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,250
Are you recording now?

2222
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:05,625
- Yes, I'll stop...
- The whole time?

2223
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:08,625
While you read aloud?

2224
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:13,125
Yes, it was recording.

2225
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:20,000
Unbelievable...

2226
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:37,625
- I'm sorry.
- Please listen.

2227
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,333
I hope you don't misunderstand me.

2228
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:50,250
May I have the data?

2229
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:58,375
While listening,
I wished I was recording it

2230
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:01,708
because this may never happen again.

2231
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:04,333
But you had been.

2232
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:10,000
I'mâŚexcited.

2233
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:14,958
I'm sure this is awkward for you.

2234
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:18,958
The part you read
can also be misleading.

2235
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:25,125
Having someone with such
a beautiful voice read my writing

2236
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,333
was exhilarating.

2237
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,458
I never knew.

2238
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:34,875
You'll have many opportunities
in the future.

2239
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:38,875
No, it's your voice that was incredible.

2240
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:44,750
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

2241
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:54,500
Don't you...want to know why
I tried to trap you?

2242
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:59,625
Isn't it because you dislike me?

2243
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:05,250
No. I've no reason to dislike you.

2244
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:09,500
You may be disliked
just for being you.

2245
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:17,875
But I can't change who I am.

2246
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:24,750
In that case, what should I do...

2247
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:30,750
if I'm hated for just being me.

2248
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,625
I don't know.

2249
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:39,375
If who I am,
something I can't change,

2250
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:45,708
makes people nauseous, what am I to do?

2251
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:03,250
I don't know what happened in your life.

2252
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:11,375
But if people around you made you think
you're worthless, please fight back.

2253
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:17,000
Refuse when society's ruler
tries to measure you.

2254
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:23,250
You must embrace your own value
that only you know.

2255
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:30,625
It's very painful to do it alone.
Still, you must do it.

2256
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:36,250
Because only those who do
can unexpectedly connect with

2257
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,208
and encourage somebody.

2258
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,625
It may never happen,

2259
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:47,750
but if nobody does it,
it won't ever happen.

2260
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,333
Not anyone can.

2261
01:07:55,167 --> 01:08:01,125
You were talented enough
to be recognized by society.

2262
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:05,583
That's why you can say that.

2263
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,625
True.

2264
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:17,125
I wish we had been able to
talk like this before the prize.

2265
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:23,458
But if I didn't win,
we wouldn't be here.

2266
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,500
You're right.

2267
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:35,333
I'm sorry. I should've
read your book sooner.

2268
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,333
There are many other books
you should be reading.

2269
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:44,000
I haven't read much else.

2270
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:47,750
That makes me envious.

2271
01:08:56,417 --> 01:09:00,375
How shall I send you the data?

2272
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:02,750
Can you e-mail it?

2273
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:06,125
Yes, I'm sure I can.

2274
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:11,125
Please send it to "segawa"
with the university domain.

2275
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:13,875
Okay.

2276
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:22,625
When you receive the data,
do you plan on doing anything peculiar?

2277
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:24,000
Peculiar?

2278
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:29,875
- I mean masturbate.
- No, I don't think so.

2279
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,750
Then I can't give it to you.

2280
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:40,125
If you want the data,
you have to promise me

2281
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:46,625
that you'll masturbate to my voice
at least one time.

2282
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:49,375
Then you can have it.

2283
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:58,375
I understand. I promise to masturbate
at least once to your voice.

2284
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,750
Okay, I'll send it.

2285
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:04,833
Thank you.

2286
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:11,208

- You can ask him to write a book.
- Nope. He disappeared pretty much.

01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:33,875
I bet it's 'cause my surname
and address changed.

2448
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:36,625
Yeah, but I got to meet you.

2449
01:25:36,792 --> 01:25:38,500
Right. I'm glad.

2450
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:42,083
Still live in Tokyo?

2451
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:43,000
Yeah.

2452
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,083
- Heading back?
- Yeah.

2453
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:48,208
Do you have time?

2454
01:25:49,292 --> 01:25:51,625
- Oh...
- Can we go for tea?

2455
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:57,750
It's a silly reason to ruin
this dramatic meeting...

2456
01:25:58,792 --> 01:26:02,875
But I need to be home for a delivery
between 2 and 4 PM.

2457
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:04,000
Oh, I see.

2458
01:26:04,167 --> 01:26:07,875
I'm not saying "no."
Come home with me.

2459
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:11,250
If you have time, that is.
Let's have tea.

2460
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,250
I have time,
but is it really okay?

2461
01:26:14,417 --> 01:26:17,458
Of course.
Nobody's home during the day.

2462
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:18,500
Sound good?

2463
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:19,708
Sure.

2464
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:23,750
It's a 15-minute walk, near Kadan.

2465
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,375
That's a nice place.

2466
01:26:25,917 --> 01:26:27,500
It is convenient.

2467
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,750
Who were at the reunion?

2468
01:26:37,917 --> 01:26:40,250
I couldn't tell who was who.

2469
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:44,000
It's been 20 years,
and their last names changed.

2470
01:26:44,167 --> 01:26:45,250
Right.

2471
01:26:45,417 --> 01:26:48,333
I couldn't keep up the chitchat.

2472
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:51,125
Bet they didn't recognize me, too.

2473
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:54,833
You must think I had no friends.

2474
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:56,250
No, I don't.

2475
01:26:56,542 --> 01:26:59,250
Then I guess it was all in my head.

2476
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:04,875
But I did talk with Kiyomiya
from the art club.

2477
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:06,458
Kiyomiya?

2478
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:08,250
Don't remember.

2479
01:27:08,417 --> 01:27:11,125
She's a school art teacher now.

2480
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:12,625
Oh, really.

2481
01:27:12,792 --> 01:27:16,208
She said she had wanted me
to model for her.

2482
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:17,625
A nude model?

2483
01:27:17,792 --> 01:27:19,208
No way!

2484
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,625
I'm not sure, though.

2485
01:27:21,792 --> 01:27:23,500
You were cool back then.

2486
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:26,875
Kiyomiya said I hadn't changed a bit.

2487
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:28,625
That can't be true.

2488
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:31,708
Maybe so. We both changed.

2489
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:36,125
What do you do?

2490
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:39,333
I'm a systems engineer. IT laborer.

2491
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,875
So it means...

2492
01:27:41,042 --> 01:27:44,333
- Yup, I'm out of a job now.
- That's too bad.

2493
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:50,458
But I have savings, and IT workers
get extra unemployment benefits.

2494
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:52,958
I'll just take it as a break.

2495
01:27:53,417 --> 01:27:54,500
That's good.

2496
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,750
Hello.

2497
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,333
- Hot, isn't it?
- It is.

2498
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:03,458
- Yu had fun at your home.
- I'm glad.

2499
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:06,625
Hitomi can come play anytime, too.

2500
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,333
Thanks, she'd love that.

2501
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:12,125
- Good day.
- Good day.

2502
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:18,708
It's kind of surreal.

2503
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:19,833
Is it?

2504
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:21,375
How old's your kid?

2505
01:28:21,667 --> 01:28:24,875
I've got a son who's 16,
and a daughter who's14.

2506
01:28:25,042 --> 01:28:26,750
- Really.
- Yup.

2507
01:28:27,417 --> 01:28:29,333
- Incredible.
- It's not.

2508
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:31,208
Here we are.

2509
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,500
Wow.

2510
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:44,625
"Kobayashi."

2511
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:53,750
Come in.

2512
01:29:01,542 --> 01:29:03,333
Put your bag anywhere.

2513
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:07,750
Your partner...

2514
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,375
What's his job?

2515
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:14,250
He's an R&D in a pharmaceutical company.

2516
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,625
Makes sense.

2517
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:17,875
- What does?
- Nothing.

2518
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,583
Any affects?

2519
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:21,500
Of the virus?

2520
01:29:22,292 --> 01:29:27,208
His research data got leaked,
but so did other companies.

2521
01:29:28,042 --> 01:29:32,458
All he needs for work is the
microscope, so we're fine.

2522
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:33,625
I see.

2523
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:35,958
What'd you do today?

2524
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:39,625
- I had a tea class.
- Really?

2525
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:40,625
What?

2526
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:46,750
Sort of unexpected, but I bet
you're cut out for tea ceremonies.

2527
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:48,458
Thanks.

2528
01:29:48,792 --> 01:29:51,250
But I'm making normal tea for now.

2529
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:53,375
I'm fine with it.

2530
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,375
Want sweet bean jelly? I froze it.

2531
01:29:58,542 --> 01:30:01,125
- It's top-notch.
- You don't mind?

2532
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,500
My family doesn't like it as I do.

2533
01:30:04,667 --> 01:30:06,000
What a waste.

2534
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:08,958
Can I help?

2535
01:30:09,125 --> 01:30:11,125
It's okay. Just relax.

2536
01:30:17,875 --> 01:30:20,208
- Don't touch it!
- Sorry.

2537
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:21,750
I'm sorry.

2538
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:25,833
Is your kid a fan?

2539
01:30:26,042 --> 01:30:27,583
Yeah, my son is.

2540
01:30:27,792 --> 01:30:28,833
I see.

2541
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,500
I'm embarrassed.

2542
01:30:31,042 --> 01:30:33,625
But anime these days are intriguing.

2543
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:36,625
Today's package is
a Blu-ray for an anime.

2544
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:41,250
Because all the VOD services
don't work anymore.

2545
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:44,625
I missed the package two days ago.

2546
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:47,458
My son gets cranky, you know?

2547
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:49,083
Do you watch it too?

2548
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:51,083
No. Do you?

2549
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,875
I binge watch to kill time now.

2550
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:00,250
I don't get it anymore.
Can't keep up with the conversation.

2551
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:03,500
- You can, if you watch it.
- Maybe.

2552
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,875
But I'm not interested.

2553
01:31:06,667 --> 01:31:11,125
I don't mind what people like,
but I'm not interested.

2554
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:23,500
It's my mother-in-law's.

2555
01:31:23,917 --> 01:31:25,625
Oh, really.

2556
01:31:27,667 --> 01:31:29,500
You still play the piano?

2557
01:31:30,292 --> 01:31:31,083
Huh?

2558
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:32,500
Not at all.

2559
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:34,583
I see.

2560
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:38,583
I only play for
my daughter's violin, too.

2561
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,375
You seem to be scared of silence.

2562
01:31:44,792 --> 01:31:45,750
Do I?

2563
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:52,000
You keep avoiding what's important.
Even though it's been 20 years.

2564
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,750
What's important?

2565
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,833
Are you happy right now?

2566
01:31:58,667 --> 01:31:59,625
Oh...

2567
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:05,125
It sounds silly to ask
after seeing this house.

2568
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:08,375
But that's my only question.

2569
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:12,875
I haven't thought about it.

2570
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:15,875
You shouldn't have to think.

2571
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:22,875
I can't say.

2572
01:32:36,042 --> 01:32:39,625
I do my best to get by every day.

2573
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:44,875
There were hard times,
but I wasn't miserable.

2574
01:32:45,792 --> 01:32:49,458
Objectively speaking,
I must be very happy.

2575
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:56,708
I feel I'd get scolded
if I say I'm not happy.

2576
01:32:57,542 --> 01:33:00,125
I'm asking what you think.

2577
01:33:02,542 --> 01:33:03,750
I don't know...

2578
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:12,625
Are you happy?

2579
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:15,583
I'm not.

2580
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:18,375
Why? Because of your job?

2581
01:33:18,792 --> 01:33:19,708
No.

2582
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:27,583
Because I've been regretting
not fighting for my feelings.

2583
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:33,125
I shouldn't have given up,
even if the result was the same.

2584
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,583
But I was ignorant then.

2585
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:38,375
I was scared to be hurt more.

2586
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:41,750
That's why I came here to see you.

2587
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:42,833
Hold on.

2588
01:33:47,917 --> 01:33:53,000
Let me clarify 'cause this conversation
seems important to you.

2589
01:33:53,542 --> 01:33:54,375
What?

2590
01:33:55,792 --> 01:34:00,833
To be honest,
I can't remember your name.

2591
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:04,083
Are you serious?

2592
01:34:04,292 --> 01:34:09,083
I'm sorry. I hoped I'd recall,
or you'd say it as we talked.

2593
01:34:10,167 --> 01:34:12,500
How could you forget?

2594
01:34:13,292 --> 01:34:15,208
Then it made me wonder.

2595
01:34:15,792 --> 01:34:16,708
What?

2596
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:19,708
Do you know my name?

2597
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:21,875
Of course, I do.

2598
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:24,083
Then who am I?

2599
01:34:26,417 --> 01:34:27,875
Mika Yuki.

2600
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:29,000
Oh...

2601
01:34:30,792 --> 01:34:31,875
Aya Kobayashi.

2602
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,750
My name's Aya Kobayashi.

2603
01:34:42,167 --> 01:34:46,375
My maiden name's Nomura.
I'm not Mika Yuki either way.

2604
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,583
- You're not Mika?
- No.

2605
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:53,625
I'm Aya Kobayashi,
and not your classmate.

2606
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:56,375
You got the wrong person.

2607
01:34:57,292 --> 01:35:01,500
But...you remembered me.

2608
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:03,708
Well...

2609
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:10,083
We met on the escalator, right?

2610
01:35:10,542 --> 01:35:11,375
Yeah.

2611
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:18,875
When we passed each other,
you looked at me all surprised.

2612
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:25,083
So I thought you must be someone I know.

2613
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:30,958
When I went back up, you came down,
and I panicked.

2614
01:35:31,417 --> 01:35:35,125
I was trying hard to recollect.
Then it hit me.

2615
01:35:36,167 --> 01:35:40,083
"She's my classmate
that went to Tokyo for college."

2616
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:43,250
Doesn't that mean you know me?

2617
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,250
Where's your school?

2618
01:35:45,667 --> 01:35:47,250
Miyagi Girls' High.

2619
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:49,500
I went to Sendai High.

2620
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:58,750
See? I'm sorry, it was my mistake.

2621
01:35:59,417 --> 01:36:01,875
I mean, <i>our</i> mistake.

2622
01:36:03,042 --> 01:36:05,250
I don't believe this...

2623
01:36:06,292 --> 01:36:10,833
You must've wanted to see her badly.

2624
01:36:13,042 --> 01:36:15,583
Yes, that's right.

2625
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:19,333
I missed her so much.

2626
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:27,125
That must be why you mistook me,
with similar age, for Mika.

2627
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:31,500
That can't be.

2628
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:34,833
But you haven't seen her 20 years.

2629
01:36:39,417 --> 01:36:41,333
Did you keep in touch?

2630
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:43,458
No.

2631
01:36:44,917 --> 01:36:48,125
Cause I heard
she married after college.

2632
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:54,458
Could it be that
you and Mika were lovers?

2633
01:37:04,042 --> 01:37:05,000
I'm sorry.

2634
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:11,833
Whoa, excuse me.

2635
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I brought your package.

2636
01:37:15,792 --> 01:37:16,875
Thank you.

2637
01:37:17,167 --> 01:37:19,250
Please sign here.

2638
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:20,458
Sure.

2639
01:37:24,542 --> 01:37:25,750
<i>Kobayashi</i>

2640
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,458
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2641
01:37:40,167 --> 01:37:42,125
Why don't you stay longer?

2642
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:46,250
The sweet bean jelly and kettle's ready.

2643
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,500
It's like a sweet bean popsicle!

2644
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:40,500
Right?

2645
01:38:41,417 --> 01:38:43,333
A high-grade version.

2646
01:38:49,042 --> 01:38:51,375
Are you sure you're not Mika?

2647
01:38:52,042 --> 01:38:54,500
I'm not Mika. Sorry.

2648
01:38:55,375 --> 01:38:57,500
Ugh.

2649
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:05,833
Was Mika your first love?

2650
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,208
I'm not sure about that.

2651
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:13,375
But she was my first partner.

2652
01:39:17,792 --> 01:39:20,125
We dated at the end of high school

2653
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:24,000
and did long-distance
after I moved to Tokyo.

2654
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:26,875
Then, she got a boyfriend.

2655
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:28,125
Oh...

2656
01:39:29,417 --> 01:39:33,250
She wasn't like me,
so I should've seen it coming.

2657
01:39:33,792 --> 01:39:36,375
But I was oblivious somehow.

2658
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:40,875
You mean, only you
were a genuine lesbian?

2659
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:42,125
Genuine?

2660
01:39:43,292 --> 01:39:44,208
Yeah.

2661
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:51,375
We were planning to live together
in Tokyo after college.

2662
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,750
But broke up when she cheated...
I mean, changed.

2663
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:57,500
I see.

2664
01:39:58,667 --> 01:39:59,875
Never saw her again?

2665
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:04,250
Yeah. Afterward, someone
told me she married the guy.

2666
01:40:05,417 --> 01:40:07,333
Did you love her?

2667
01:40:19,042 --> 01:40:20,125
My husband...

2668
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,833
He was contacting his high school ex.

2669
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Really?

2670
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,250
I found out because the virus
sent his emails to me.

2671
01:40:35,667 --> 01:40:40,125
You know, you can see
the history of their responses.

2672
01:40:40,292 --> 01:40:41,125
Yeah.

2673
01:40:42,875 --> 01:40:49,625
He wrote in the email, "I really
want to see you, but we shouldn't."

2674
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:53,875
"I know we love our families."

2675
01:40:54,292 --> 01:40:55,375
He's faithful.

2676
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:57,333
He is.

2677
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,208
How did you feel?

2678
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:06,125
It's hard to put it into words.

2679
01:41:07,542 --> 01:41:10,083
But it was beautifully written.

2680
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,750
I was surprised by his words.

2681
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:15,125
What words?

2682
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:27,125
"The things you said to me
keeps me going even now."

2683
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:35,625
"Your existence is my anchor,
even to this day."

2684
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:43,583
"Meeting you was one of the best things
that has ever happened in my life."

2685
01:41:44,042 --> 01:41:45,375
Wow.

2686
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:48,625
I kept rereading it.

2687
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,375
But isn't there only one "best thing"?

2688
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:56,625
Yeah, it's a weird expression.

2689
01:41:56,917 --> 01:41:59,458
Did you tell him you read it?

2690
01:41:59,917 --> 01:42:00,875
No.

2691
01:42:01,167 --> 01:42:04,750
Did your partner...
I mean, Mr. Husband notice?

2692
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:06,083
"Mr. Husband"?

2693
01:42:07,792 --> 01:42:11,833
I'm not sure.
I think he was too busy back then.

2694
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:16,333
Almost everything was leaked.

2695
01:42:16,917 --> 01:42:20,208
I bet he couldn't tell what got exposed.

2696
01:42:22,292 --> 01:42:23,750
Not gonna tell him?

2697
01:42:25,542 --> 01:42:28,750
It'll only make things awkward.

2698
01:42:31,167 --> 01:42:34,750
He did contact her, after all.

2699
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,833
And wanted to see her.

2700
01:42:39,292 --> 01:42:40,625
Can't forgive him?

2701
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,125
For just the thought?

2702
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:55,250
I think you can't stop
wanting to see someone.

2703
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:58,500
You don't have to be so understanding.

2704
01:43:02,292 --> 01:43:05,833
Sorry. I don't even know you.

2705
01:43:07,792 --> 01:43:08,750
It's okay.

2706
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,958
Do I look understanding?

2707
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:22,625
What's wrong?

2708
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,708
I keep seeing Mika in you.

2709
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:29,250
Do I resemble her that much?

2710
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:32,625
Maybe it's the vibe you give off.

2711
01:43:33,417 --> 01:43:38,125
You look exactly like
what I imagined she'd look now.

2712
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,750
Was Mika understanding?

2713
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:42,000
Not at all.

2714
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:47,958
She looks it,
but you can't reason with her.

2715
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:50,333
Maybe she's really like me.

2716
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I can play Mika if you'd like.

2717
01:44:01,542 --> 01:44:02,625
Play her?

2718
01:44:04,042 --> 01:44:07,250
It seems like a waste.

2719
01:44:07,417 --> 01:44:08,500
Of what?

2720
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:10,625
The dramatic meeting.

2721
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:12,833
What do you mean?

2722
01:44:13,042 --> 01:44:15,625
My looks and personality seem to fit.

2723
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:19,375
- That's not the point.
- I may not be good enough.

2724
01:44:20,667 --> 01:44:26,250
But I know it's something
that means a lot to you.

2725
01:44:32,792 --> 01:44:36,333
I know it's late,
but can I ask your name?

2726
01:44:40,792 --> 01:44:42,208
Natsuko Higuchi.

2727
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500
Natsuko means "summer child."

2728
01:44:46,417 --> 01:44:47,375
Natsuko.

2729
01:44:48,167 --> 01:44:49,250
Lovely name.

2730
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,375
Natsuko...

2731
01:45:02,417 --> 01:45:04,875
You said you weren't happy.

2732
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:09,625
Is it my fault?

2733
01:45:10,125 --> 01:45:12,708
Stop it...

2734
01:45:14,417 --> 01:45:17,625
You didn't date anyone after me?

2735
01:45:19,167 --> 01:45:20,708
There were some.

2736
01:45:21,875 --> 01:45:23,958
But I couldn't truly connect.

2737
01:45:24,167 --> 01:45:26,750
Were you truly connected with me?

2738
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:32,875
Are you mad?

2739
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:36,000
Yeah.

2740
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:40,750
I'm mad.

2741
01:45:44,417 --> 01:45:45,583
I'm sorry.

2742
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,333
Don't be.

2743
01:45:50,375 --> 01:45:51,750
It's not you.

2744
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,250
I'm mad I didn't say
the things I should've.

2745
01:45:58,542 --> 01:46:00,125
Like what?

2746
01:46:01,292 --> 01:46:02,708
What I couldn't say.

2747
01:46:04,542 --> 01:46:10,625
When you gave me your last call,
I was at Shibuya Center-gai.

2748
01:46:11,417 --> 01:46:16,750
The trending song and
deeply tanned girls were real noisy.

2749
01:46:19,667 --> 01:46:23,875
But I could hear your voice clearly.

2750
01:46:24,917 --> 01:46:27,625
You sounded determined.

2751
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:34,125
I sensed you had suffered enough
before you made the call.

2752
01:46:35,167 --> 01:46:38,375
So, I couldn't say anything.

2753
01:46:39,542 --> 01:46:44,208
I knew if I did, it would only
make you suffer more.

2754
01:46:45,417 --> 01:46:50,250
That's why I hung up
and never called again.

2755
01:46:52,417 --> 01:46:54,958
But I wanted to say was

2756
01:46:55,917 --> 01:46:59,500
you're my one and only love.

2757
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,958
You may be able to love someone else,

2758
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:11,000
but I can't love anyone else.

2759
01:47:14,417 --> 01:47:20,000
Being together with me
may complicate your life.

2760
01:47:21,042 --> 01:47:23,708
But I wanted you to choose me.

2761
01:47:24,917 --> 01:47:26,625
I couldn't say that.

2762
01:47:28,042 --> 01:47:28,875
I see.

2763
01:47:30,542 --> 01:47:36,375
But I didn't come here because
I wanted something from you.

2764
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:42,500
I just wanted to tell you
that I couldn't say those words.

2765
01:47:43,792 --> 01:47:47,333
Even if it made you suffer,
I should've said it.

2766
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:52,958
I know now, the pain
was essential for our lives.

2767
01:47:54,167 --> 01:48:01,125
I assumed you'd have a hole
in your life now, just like me.

2768
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:03,458
So I came.

2769
01:48:05,167 --> 01:48:06,125
A hole?

2770
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:12,875
You must have a hole
that nothing can fill in.

2771
01:48:16,667 --> 01:48:19,250
There's no way for me to fill it.

2772
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:23,375
But I have the same hole as you.

2773
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:29,958
We may be still connected
through that hole.

2774
01:48:31,292 --> 01:48:33,125
I came to tell you that.

2775
01:48:45,542 --> 01:48:46,458
I'm home.

2776
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:53,875
Is it here?

2777
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:03,958
Say hello.

2778
01:49:05,042 --> 01:49:05,833
Hello.

2779
01:49:06,542 --> 01:49:07,958
Nice to meet you.

2780
01:49:18,417 --> 01:49:19,583
He's handsome.

2781
01:49:21,667 --> 01:49:23,750
I thought he'd be a geek.

2782
01:49:25,042 --> 01:49:28,375
He can't even say hello.

2783
01:49:31,875 --> 01:49:33,208
I should be going.

2784
01:49:33,417 --> 01:49:36,000
It's okay. He won't come down.

2785
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:39,500
Your daughter will be back. I'm going.

2786
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,500
Okay. Can I walk you to the station?

2787
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,500
Yeah. Thanks.

2788
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:55,333
Kei, I'm going to walk
my friend to the station.

2789
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,625
So your son's name is Kei.

2790
01:50:11,917 --> 01:50:12,833
Yeah.

2791
01:50:13,375 --> 01:50:14,625
And the girl's Yu.

2792
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:15,625
Right.

2793
01:50:16,792 --> 01:50:17,875
How'd you know?

2794
01:50:18,042 --> 01:50:19,750
You mentioned it.

2795
01:50:20,167 --> 01:50:21,208
Oh, yeah.

2796
01:50:21,792 --> 01:50:24,083
Yu means "to play."

2797
01:50:24,667 --> 01:50:26,083
Nice, simple names.

2798
01:50:26,292 --> 01:50:32,750
We wanted gender-neutral names
so it wouldn't shackle them later.

2799
01:50:32,917 --> 01:50:34,500
You're progressive.

2800
01:50:35,667 --> 01:50:37,500
What's Mr. Husband like?

2801
01:50:40,542 --> 01:50:43,375
He's a steady, diligent person.

2802
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:45,875
That might be the best.

2803
01:50:46,042 --> 01:50:49,000
- You think so?
- Well, I don't know him.

2804
01:50:49,167 --> 01:50:53,375
But I felt trust and a little distance
from your tone.

2805
01:50:54,792 --> 01:50:55,875
You're right.

2806
01:50:56,917 --> 01:50:59,375
- But you missed "love."
- Sorry.

2807
01:50:59,792 --> 01:51:00,708
It's okay.

2808
01:51:02,125 --> 01:51:04,375
I've never told anyone before.

2809
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,250
I'm honored.

2810
01:51:07,292 --> 01:51:08,583
I'm amazed.

2811
01:51:18,792 --> 01:51:19,583
What is it?

2812
01:51:20,125 --> 01:51:23,250
Who did you mistake me for?

2813
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:28,250
She was my high school classmate.
A boyish girl.

2814
01:51:28,542 --> 01:51:30,208
Were you two close?

2815
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:34,500
Not really. We weren't that close.

2816
01:51:36,042 --> 01:51:40,250
She often played the piano
alone at lunch break.

2817
01:51:40,667 --> 01:51:44,375
I also played the piano as a hobby.

2818
01:51:45,042 --> 01:51:48,625
So we started meeting
in the music room at lunch.

2819
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:54,000
We took turns playing the piano
during lunch break

2820
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:57,625
and ate listening to each other's piano.

2821
01:51:58,542 --> 01:52:03,000
We didn't talk in class.
Only in the music room.

2822
01:52:03,167 --> 01:52:05,458
- What a lovely memory.
- Yeah.

2823
01:52:05,917 --> 01:52:07,708
It was sort of special.

2824
01:52:08,667 --> 01:52:11,500
We lost contact after she went to Tokyo.

2825
01:52:15,042 --> 01:52:22,000
<i>Sendai Station</i>

2826
01:52:23,667 --> 01:52:24,500
Hey.

2827
01:52:26,167 --> 01:52:28,250
Let's play pretend again.

2828
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,833
Where should we start?

2829
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,333
I'll be your boyish pianist this time.

2830
01:52:35,542 --> 01:52:37,250
But my memory's hazy.

2831
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:39,875
- It seems unfair.
- Why?

2832
01:52:40,042 --> 01:52:41,083
Let me do it!

2833
01:52:42,917 --> 01:52:45,125
All right. You walk from there.

2834
01:52:45,292 --> 01:52:48,833
We meet when I come up
the escalator, okay?

2835
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,125
It's like a skit.

2836
01:53:28,542 --> 01:53:29,375
Aya?

2837
01:53:31,292 --> 01:53:32,500
Is it you?

2838
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,708
Do you recognize me?

2839
01:53:37,292 --> 01:53:39,208
Yeah, from high school.

2840
01:53:40,042 --> 01:53:42,500
But I can't remember your name.

2841
01:53:42,667 --> 01:53:44,208
It doesn't matter.

2842
01:53:44,792 --> 01:53:47,500
Remember playing the piano together?

2843
01:53:47,667 --> 01:53:48,583
Of course.

2844
01:53:49,125 --> 01:53:51,583
Why are you back from Tokyo?

2845
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:55,375
For the reunion. I'm on my way back.

2846
01:53:55,542 --> 01:53:58,125
Why were you invited, but not me?

2847
01:53:58,292 --> 01:54:00,125
Who knows?

2848
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:05,875
But I'm glad to see you.
I was wondering how you were doing.

2849
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:07,250
You mean it?

2850
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,875
I do.

2851
01:54:09,292 --> 01:54:14,375
I'm glad. I thought no one from
high school would remember me.

2852
01:54:14,542 --> 01:54:19,125
No way. I was secretly proud
that I could talk with you.

2853
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,083
- You were?
- Yeah.

2854
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:27,000
You gave off an antisocial vibe,
but many wanted to talk to you.

2855
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,250
- Are you sure?
- I am.

2856
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:31,250
You were admired.

2857
01:54:31,542 --> 01:54:34,375
Cut it out. You're gonna make me cry.

2858
01:54:37,667 --> 01:54:38,958
How are you doing?

2859
01:54:39,125 --> 01:54:44,000
Good. There are struggles,
but I live every day to the fullest.

2860
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:47,500
I'm so glad you haven't changed.

2861
01:54:48,042 --> 01:54:49,958
And you? Are you good?

2862
01:54:51,667 --> 01:54:55,458
I can't answer straight away like you.

2863
01:54:55,667 --> 01:54:57,000
You're not well?

2864
01:54:57,375 --> 01:54:59,250
- My body's fine.
- Then...

2865
01:55:00,417 --> 01:55:02,958
It's not a big problem.

2866
01:55:03,875 --> 01:55:08,583
But sometimes I wonder why I'm here.

2867
01:55:12,042 --> 01:55:17,125
I could've become anything,
but time flew past before I knew.

2868
01:55:18,542 --> 01:55:20,125
I'm fairly satisfied.

2869
01:55:21,542 --> 01:55:23,750
This is what I chose.

2870
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:27,833
And I know it's wrong to want more.

2871
01:55:30,042 --> 01:55:30,875
But...

2872
01:55:35,292 --> 01:55:39,625
I'm not passionate
about anything anymore.

2873
01:55:42,917 --> 01:55:44,750
I don't know what to do.

2874
01:55:46,250 --> 01:55:47,208
Time is...

2875
01:55:48,417 --> 01:55:50,250
slowly killing me.

2876
01:55:58,125 --> 01:56:01,000
I'm sorry to say this all of a sudden.

2877
01:56:02,042 --> 01:56:02,875
It's okay.

2878
01:56:05,417 --> 01:56:08,500
Can I tell you how I saw you back then?

2879
01:56:09,917 --> 01:56:10,708
Sure.

2880
01:56:12,042 --> 01:56:16,875
You said everyone admired me,
but that's wrong.

2881
01:56:17,417 --> 01:56:22,875
I always felt different,
like everyone observed me from afar.

2882
01:56:24,292 --> 01:56:27,833
I always felt like an outcast.

2883
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:32,250
You were the only one that stepped in.

2884
01:56:32,792 --> 01:56:36,708
It was just one step,
but it meant a lot to me.

2885
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:43,208
You were the only light for me.
I could find you anywhere you were.

2886
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,208
Your existence gave me power.

2887
01:56:50,167 --> 01:56:51,125
It's true.

2888
01:56:51,292 --> 01:56:55,250
You have the ability
to give people power.

2889
01:56:55,417 --> 01:56:57,083
Please remember that.

2890
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:00,375
Thanks.

2891
01:57:02,542 --> 01:57:06,875
But I didn't say <i>everyone</i> admired you.

2892
01:57:07,167 --> 01:57:07,958
Huh?

2893
01:57:08,542 --> 01:57:10,750
I admired you.

2894
01:57:17,875 --> 01:57:18,833
Thank you.

2895
01:57:22,917 --> 01:57:24,500
I'm glad I met you.

2896
01:57:26,167 --> 01:57:28,833
I'm glad I met you, too.

2897
01:57:33,042 --> 01:57:33,750
Bye.

2898
01:57:35,167 --> 01:57:35,958
See you!

2899
01:57:37,542 --> 01:57:38,250
See you.

2900
01:58:52,667 --> 01:58:54,000
- Wait.
- What's wrong?

2901
01:58:55,667 --> 01:58:58,250
- It's nothing big.
- What is it?

2902
01:58:58,875 --> 01:59:01,125
But I can only tell you.

2903
01:59:01,292 --> 01:59:02,625
Tell me anything.

2904
01:59:03,292 --> 01:59:05,125
- I remembered.
- What?

2905
01:59:05,292 --> 01:59:06,250
Her name.

2906
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:09,875
It's Nozomi.

2907
01:59:10,625 --> 01:59:11,583
Nozomi?

2908
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,958
- Nozomi!
- Nozomi!

2909
01:59:19,292 --> 01:59:20,250
And her surname?

2910
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:21,875
Can't remember.
