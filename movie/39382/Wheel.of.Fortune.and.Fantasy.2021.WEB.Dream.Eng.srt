<i>(or Something Less Assuring)</i>

3
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:06,583
Really pretty!

4
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,958
I like the eyelashes
reflecting the light.

5
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,708
Let's try the hat.

6
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,500
- There's something here.
- Thanks.

7
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:38,625
Okay. Let me take a look now.

8
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,500
Give us a minute, please.

9
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,875
- Good.
- Yep.

10
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,833
- They're very good.
- Yes.

11
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:58,708
- I'm happy with these. You guys?
- Yep. Me, too.

12
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,500
- Okay!
- Good job, everyone!

13
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,208
Yay, we're done!

14
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:17,375
- Thank you, bye.
- Take care!

15
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,708
- Ride with me.
- Is it okay?

16
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,750
- See you later.
- See you!

17
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:31,208
- Take care.
- Thanks, bye.

18
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,000
What?!

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,375
You just met him!
How'd you click so well?

20
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:57,125
Well, at some point,
he started saying...

21
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,458
"Tsu, you're not
who I thought you were."

22
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,750
"Tsu"?

23
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,125
The bar owner suggested
nicknames for us,

24
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:10,250
"Tsu" for Tsugumi, "Ka" for Kazuaki.

25
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:17,333
So, I asked him
what he thought of me initially.

26
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,708
He thought I was beautiful when we met.

27
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,458
- Yup...
- Well, well...

28
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:27,375
But he was under the impression
that I was aloof

29
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,250
because of our email exchanges
before we met.

30
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:35,208
That's the way business communication
should be.

31
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:38,125
But you know how friendly I am.

32
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:42,500
So, he was like,
"The contrast blew me away."

33
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:49,375
Then I said, "Hang on.
You're a fine one to talk."

34
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,250
Honestly, he seemed like a player.

35
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,875
- A player!
- Well, not exactly.

36
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,125
I should say, he's a hottie.

37
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:02,458
- A hottie isn't the same as a player.
- I mean...

38
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,708
He struck me as a ladies' man at times,

39
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,250
but not in a negative way.

40
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:11,500
He says his home office is in Aoyama.

41
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,000
That's players' haven!

42
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,083
Hmm, I don't know about that.

43
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:18,000
What does he do?

44
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:21,750
He heads an interior design company
and invests.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,750
Now he sounds...like a player.

46
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,500
Really, Gumi?
You don't like players.

47
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,250
I know. I'm surprised that
I find his company so much fun.

48
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:38,500
I see.

49
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:44,000
I declined the business offer
and he accepted.

50
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,208
But we kept chatting and
two hours passed before we knew it.

51
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:54,250
Then, it went from "Wanna grab coffee?"
to "Do you drink?"

52
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,250
And we missed the last train.

53
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:00,125
Amazing. How long were you together?

54
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:04,125
The meeting started at 1 PM,
so 15 hours all together.

55
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,875
- No way!
- I know.

56
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:10,708
Somehow, we started talking
about our childhoods.

57
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:16,000
We found we had similar upbringings
and moved around a lot.

58
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:22,250
We quickly realized that's why we both
approach people from a distance.

59
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:28,375
I told him about things
I've never told anybody,

60
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:32,583
not even to you, Meiko,
and he did the same.

61
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,583
Maybe he was mirroring me to be nice.

62
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:38,708
But...

63
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:44,750
I could sense that
I touched something deep within him...

64
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:50,125
and I felt he touched me
deep within, too.

65
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,458
That sounds...erotic.

66
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,708
Doesn't it?

67
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:01,083
Honestly, I felt something
very erotic about it.

68
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:06,958
I didn't know conversations
could be this erotic.

69
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,208
- Did you talk dirty?
- No.

70
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:12,333
No dirty talk, no physical touching.

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,708
I don't get it.

72
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:20,875
But we caressed each other
through our conversation.

73
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,750
That's damn erotic.

74
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,208
We ended up talking about
what we'd be like as a couple.

75
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,750
- You guys are in love!
- I guess.

76
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:35,375
We both sensed
we were falling for each other,

77
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:39,833
or at least we got along really well.

78
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,708
In fact, we thought,
we can do it.

79
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:46,750
That's not dirty?

80
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,500
No. Our talk flowed naturally
in that direction.

81
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,000
You're so mature!

82
00:06:54,292 --> 00:07:00,500
But we were like, "Nah, not today."
So, we said goodbye and took taxis home.

83
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,000
What? Why not?

84
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,333
- No, no, no...
- No?

85
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,625
Is sex on the first date common?

86
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:12,625
I don't know, but in your case,
you could have.

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,125
Hmm, you're right about that.

88
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,375
How about you, Meiko?
Have you ever...?

89
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,000
What do you mean?

90
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:23,000
Doing it on the first date.

91
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,500
No, not the first date.

92
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,250
The second or third time?

93
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:30,208
Yeah, that happens.

94
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,833
- Never done it?
- No.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,500
I can't. That's too fast for me.

96
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,500
Most guys want it by the third time.

97
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,583
I know. So, I put them in
"the players" basket.

98
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,375
Gumi, you're harsh!

99
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:48,625
- You and I are different on this one.
- Yup.

100
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,708
To be honest...

101
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,583
it wasn't a bad idea.

102
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,500
I've never felt I could
on the first date.

103
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,125
Actually, I wanted to.

104
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:08,125
I wondered what we'd be like afterwards.

105
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,625
If the convo was that good...

106
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:15,250
I thought about consequences
and felt a bit unsure.

107
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:19,125
But I think I was giving him signals.

108
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,083
What kinda signals?

109
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,875
I won't tell you. I can't.

110
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:26,375
- Oh, c'mon!
- It just happened in that moment.

111
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:34,625
You know...it was him who held back.

112
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,583
He couldn't get it up?

113
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,750
- Oh, shush!
- Ow!

114
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,125
In a nutshell,

115
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:48,000
he couldn't bring himself
to it mentally.

116
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,375
He said...

117
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,833
him and his ex broke up
because she cheated.

118
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,500
Ah...that sounds familiar...

119
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,833
Yeah, cheater! Apologize.

120
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,500
Let us pray for forgiveness.

121
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:10,875
And you know, he got cheated on
more than once.

122
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,125
Uh-huh...

123
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:16,875
But he loved her so much and

124
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,375
it was so painful that
he probably can't love again.

125
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,375
When did that happen?

126
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,500
About two years ago.

127
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,833
- He's dwelling on it too long!
- I know! But...

128
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,625
I can empathize with that.

129
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,125
I see.

130
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:40,375
He also said he had lots of fun
with me but feels unprepared,

131
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,375
this came out of left field.

132
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,500
It excited him but

133
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:52,000
it also made him realize
he's scared of falling in love.

134
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:57,333
He said I reminded him of his ex.

135
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:00,000
- You look like her?
- No.

136
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,958
It wasn't my face or personality.

137
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,750
But, he'd never...

138
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,833
felt so at ease talking to someone.

139
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,125
Then, he remembered that he was never
able to talk like this with his ex.

140
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,833
Hmm...at ease...

141
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:24,625
Yeah, it caught my mind,
so I said,

142
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,083
"Feeling at ease isn't
the same as romance."

143
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,083
What'd he say?

144
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,000
"What do you think, Tsu?"

145
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,208
How annoying.

146
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,500
It's hard to explain the nuances.

147
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:47,625
We spent a really magical time together

148
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:53,208
and both felt we'd never
had an experience like it.

149
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:59,083
He said that, for us who have
always kept others at bay,

150
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,625
our paths crossing is special.

151
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:06,000
And I knew that he meant
what he said.

152
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:14,500
Then, he suggested we leave each other
at that and call it a day.

153
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,875
He said, "If the magic is gone
next time we meet, then let it be."

154
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,208
Magic, huh?

155
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:26,000
The word was perfect for us.

156
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,375
He said, "I honestly had
the best day of my life."

157
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:36,000
"It'll be great if our next meeting
turns out even better."

158
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:40,625
"I feel optimistic about us.
Let's hope we make it."

159
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,750
Then, we shook hands goodbye.

160
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:43,958
Seriously?

161
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,375
Are you scared about next time?

162
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,208
I am...very much so.

163
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,375
And yet I want to see him. Soon.

164
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,625
Gumi, you look lovely.

165
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're glowing right now.

166
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:13,750
Thanks.

167
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

168
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,000
Thanks a lot.

169
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,583
- Good night.
- See you.

170
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,125
Excuse me.

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,708
Do you mind going back the same way?

172
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:29,458
Is the president in?

173
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,500
- Pardon?
- May I come in?

174
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,250
And you are...?

175
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,750
I'm his friend.

176
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,375
Excuse me.

177
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,500
Yes?

178
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,708
I need a word.

179
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:49,000
Ms. Morita, you can go.

180
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,583
But...

181
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,958
I'll be fine. I can do the rest myself.

182
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,083
Sure.

183
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,625
- Good night.
- Good night.

184
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:11,958
Good night.

185
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,500
Cute.

186
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:25,250
What?

187
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,500
You've moved your office.

188
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,250
The old one was cute, too.

189
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,250
Where's your bed now?

190
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,625
Upstairs.

191
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,250
I see.

192
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,708
You look successful.

193
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,250
What do you want to talk about?

194
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:50,000
I heard you started investing.

195
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,250
Can you handle that?
I never saw you as the type.

196
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,083
Who told you that?

197
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,250
You two spent a magical time together.

198
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,333
"Tsu" and "Ka"?

199
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:08,625
You guys are lame.

200
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,750
You know her?

201
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,000
You mean, Gumi?

202
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,625
My best friend.

203
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:17,958
"Gumi"?

204
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:22,875
Because she's Tsugumi.
We had a shoot today.

205
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,708
Are you surprised?

206
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:35,875
Surprised? It's rather hard to believe.

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,875
What's so hard to believe?

208
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,875
She told you about me?

209
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,625
Not exactly.

210
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,583
I realized she was talking about you.

211
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,375
Did you tell her about us?

212
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,375
No, I didn't. How could I?

213
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:52,750
Right.

214
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,625
Are you in love with Gumi?

215
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,000
- I don't know yet.
- How can you not?

216
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:04,875
"A magical time"?

217
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,250
"The best day of my life"?

218
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,250
Hey, stop that.

219
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,750
You think I'm jealous?

220
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,583
- Aren't you?
- Not at all.

221
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,125
I'm not at all in love with you, Kazu.

222
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,458
You've hardly crossed my mind.

223
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:21,958
You got it easy.

224
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,875
You passed yourself off as

225
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:29,125
this traumatized guy who got cheated on.

226
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,958
Did she say that?

227
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,000
No. Partly my interpretation.

228
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,500
Who are you to probe into that night?

229
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
"That night"?

230
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:50,000
Leave. You're acting like a stalker.
You're insane.

231
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:52,375
Don't worry.

232
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:55,875
I'm aware of my insane behavior.

233
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,000
You're operating normally, then.

234
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,125
- You know me.
- Why'd you come?

235
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,125
Want to know?

236
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,208
I need to. I'm scared.

237
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,625
To tell the truth, I don't know.

238
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,250
Huh?

239
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:18,125
But there's nobody else
I can talk to about this.

240
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,250
Not Gumi, of course.

241
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:25,333
And I knew you'd listen to me
even after two years.

242
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,958
- How have you been?
- Listen to what?

243
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,500
I don't know.

244
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,833
But you used to enjoy hearing
what I had to say.

245
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,125
How've you been?

246
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,458
What do you want to know?

247
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:53,250
I got so pissed off when I heard
about you and her.

248
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,875
I felt sad, too.

249
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,625
But I'm not in love with you now.

250
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,208
- And you...
- Don't.

251
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:05,625
Maybe it's the loss of someone
I believed was mine.

252
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,583
I don't belong to you.

253
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,208
I'm talking about Gumi.

254
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:13,250
Look, woman.
That girl's not yours, either.

255
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,333
Why'd you just call me "woman"?

256
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:19,250
You've never spoke like that to me.

257
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,500
Say it again and I'll leave.

258
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:25,208
Woman. Leave.

259
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:33,458
Also, I don't like how you
refer to Gumi as "that girl."

260
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:38,958
- Ms. Konno doesn't belong to you.
- What do you want?

261
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know yet.

262
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,083
Are you going to
sleep with her next time?

263
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,125
That's none of your business.

264
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,375
You're in for an ordinary,
boring relationship.

265
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,875
What are you saying?

266
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,500
You're gonna cry over that
enchanting first date...

267
00:19:58,667 --> 00:19:59,750
Are you cursing me?

268
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,875
- Maybe.
- What the hell?

269
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,708
Are you mad at me?

270
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,125
I'm not sure if I'm mad at you,

271
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,458
but maybe I am.

272
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,583
Then, at Tsugumi?

273
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,708
- Tsu's not at fault.
- Don't call her Tsu.

274
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:20,458
Well...

275
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,625
If I'm mad,
I'm probably mad at our fate.

276
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:25,583
Fate?

277
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,250
Our fate's nobody's fault.

278
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:33,750
If there's anyone evil in this story,
it's you.

279
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,375
Why? Because I cheated on you?

280
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,625
You not only cheated but...

281
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,125
But...?

282
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,125
Your motive was disgusting.

283
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,083
You wanted to experience
sex with a rich man.

284
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,250
Yeah, I totally said that.

285
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,333
You're despicable.

286
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,833
Yeah, but that's because
you kept probing.

287
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,458
I wasn't ready to verbalize my thoughts
but you forced me.

288
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,625
- The words didn't feel right.
- And the truth?

289
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,125
Sexual frustration.

290
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,458
And curiosity.

291
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:13,750
You called me evil,

292
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:17,500
but what about you for leaving
me frustrated?

293
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:22,500
- I'm not your dildo.
- Dildos are better. Be humble.

294
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,958
What? You frightened me!

295
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,833
- Was that even yours?
- Leave.

296
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,375
I might lose control and kill you.

297
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,500
Then you'll never see Tsu again.

298
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,125
- Where are you going?
- Let go! I'm leaving.

299
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:43,375
- You live here.
- Get lost!

300
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,125
- Running away again?
- Yeah!

301
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:47,375
Why do you keep hurting me?

302
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,625
Don't know. It might be love.

303
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:55,708
When I was a kid,
I hurt the boys I liked.

304
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:58,875
Stop. I'll never let you fool me again.

305
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,625
I <i>might</i> love you.

306
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,708
- But I doubt it.
- What?

307
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,750
Isn't this fun?

308
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:10,500
- Not at all.
- There's rhythm in our spats.

309
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,250
Like the old days.

310
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,333
You're just pissed off about losing
the man you thought was yours.

311
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,583
You're only repeating what I said.

312
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,875
You've always had to have me loving you,

313
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,583
even after we separated,
even if you don't love me.

314
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,583
Yeah...maybe.

315
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,375
So leave.

316
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:35,000
We can't be together.
At least, I can't.

317
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,208
I see, but why is that?

318
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,750
I can't stand you.

319
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:42,000
But "you loved me so much."

320
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,333
I heard it from Gumi.

321
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,625
And you were devastated.

322
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,958
But Kazu,
I bet you've never imagined...

323
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:00,958
What?

324
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:07,750
How badly I got hurt from hurting you.

325
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:17,083
No, no... Hold on.

326
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:18,833
That's too easy.

327
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:21,625
I can't help it, I love you.

328
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,250
I always have.

329
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,333
What about Gumi?

330
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,750
I told you I don't know yet.

331
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:35,125
My feelings for her are different.

332
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:40,125
If you hug me, Tsugumi will vanish.
Is that okay?

333
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,500
And I can't guarantee
I'll become yours.

334
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,750
You might lose both.

335
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,500
I can't promise anything.

336
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,833
That's who I am. Can you accept me?

337
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,833
I'm about to puke.

338
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,833
Have you always loved me? All this time?

339
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,000
I wonder...

340
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,625
- You just said so.
- On impulse.

341
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:17,125
The truth sometimes
comes out impulsively.

342
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,750
I came here on impulse.

343
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,208
It's anything but the truth with you.

344
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,208
You think so?

345
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,750
At least, nothing assuring.

346
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,958
Right. Because I don't know.

347
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:38,250
- Why are you here?
- Are you sure about yourself?

348
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:45,750
Because you're not,
you're half-hearted about Gumi.

349
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:53,000
I really like Gumi.

350
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,250
She's amazing.

351
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,083
I think you're a good match.

352
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,250
But she's hard work.

353
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,250
She can be hardheaded.

354
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,333
I've gathered.

355
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:12,000
You and Gumi are similar.

356
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,500
You might be right.

357
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:17,875
That's quite true.

358
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,875
What is it you loved about me?

359
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,333
That you're honest.

360
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:33,750
Yeah, I am...

361
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:39,625
You were a trustworthy person, Meiko.

362
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,583
But I cheated on you.

363
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,875
Was it cheating?

364
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,958
I tried not to see you as my belonging.

365
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:53,375
So that you wouldn't get hurt.

366
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,625
Can't you let that slide?

367
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,083
Did you ever, even once,
try to truly face me?

368
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,833
I tried to understand you.

369
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,208
I listened to you as much as I could.

370
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,000
Answer my question.

371
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,500
How do you mean "truly face"?

372
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:22,500
If you don't know, you'll repeat
the same mistakes with Tsugumi

373
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,208
and end up hurting her in the end.

374
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,500
Did you get hurt?

375
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,000
Yup.

376
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,125
Why?

377
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:40,833
All I can do is hurt the ones I love.

378
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:45,500
Love's supposed to make people happy.

379
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,250
We had happy times.

380
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,333
I feel like a defective product.

381
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,458
You're not the only one.

382
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,833
I'm not even a dildo.

383
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,625
Because you're so kind...

384
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,333
you're not for me.

385
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,375
- You and Gumi will make a nice couple.
- I know.

386
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:27,708
Kazu.

387
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,958
Would you dare to believe in...

388
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:36,875
something less assuring than magic?

389
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:59,958
Sorry. I forgot my laptop.

390
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,583
Is she the woman you said
you had on your mind?

391
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,750
No, she isn't.

392
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,000
Then, why chase her?

393
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,000
Is it bad?

394
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,625
Of course it is.

395
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:52,208
<i>Three days later...</i>

396
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:13,000
Gumi, did something good happen?

397
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,208
Why?

398
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,500
You look extra pretty.

00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:19,708
What?

400
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:25,083
The guy I told you about
asked me out tonight.

401
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,583
He wants to meet me for a chat.

402
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,125
I see.

403
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,833
No way!

404
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,750
That's him.

405
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,625
- I'll go.
- Stay!

406
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:56,750
I want to know what you think.

407
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,625
Over here!

408
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,875
What a surprise!
Sorry for stopping you.

409
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:11,333
Oh, this is my friend, Meiko.
And this is Mr. Kubota.

410
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,458
Sorry, I already told her about you.

411
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:23,750
Have you decided?

412
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,000
What?

413
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,125
Who's it gonna be, Kazu?

414
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:34,750
Sorry, Gumi.

415
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,750
I'm his ex-girlfriend.

416
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:42,625
A terrible coincidence, isn't it?
It's so funny.

417
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:51,125
I went to see him right after we spoke.

418
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It felt as if the two years
vanished in an instant.

419
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,625
It was like magic.

420
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,333
Then, I realized...

421
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,875
I love you, Kazu.

422
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,625
With all my heart,

423
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,500
all I desire is you.

424
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,958
I can't imagine life without you.

425
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:25,875
I realized that your encounter with Gumi
was the magic meant for us.

426
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:32,583
You must have realized that, too.

427
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,375
Meet my friend, Meiko.

428
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,958
And this is Mr. Kubota.

429
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,500
Sorry, I already told her about you.

430
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,250
I'll go.

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,708

Oh, stop.

436
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:16,125
I got this.

437
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:17,625
Oh, no. Don't...

438
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:21,500
Please, let me.
And then we'll go somewhere.

439
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,083
Okay. Where to?

00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:30,458
To think I drummed the courage
to attend college...

493
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,500
You've got me.

494
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:36,000
I can find friends
with benefits elsewhere.

495
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
That right there.

496
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,000
What?

497
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:48,125
That's why you're
not in the girl's chat.

498
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,000
Girl's chat...?

499
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:56,500
I heard from Kana. She was laughing.

500
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:01,208
I thought it was funny too, sorry.

501
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,833
Weird... I think I'm gonna cry.

502
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,250
Go ahead. Cry.

503
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:22,875
Seriously?

504
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:26,625
Professor Segawa won? That's great.

505
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,875
No it isn't.

506
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,375
It's a prestigious award.

507
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,125
<i>I couldn't write twenty plus years,</i>

508
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:43,333
<i>but I was able to write this novel</i>
<i>without hesitation from start to finish.</i>

509
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,708
I actually have his book on me now.

510
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,708
You bought it?

511
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,125
I want you to read it.

512
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:55,958
Hell no.

513
00:41:56,125 --> 00:42:01,375
<i>Praised for its fresh literary style</i>
<i>and clever story structureâŚ</i>

514
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:04,500
I could've presented this news.

515
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:07,458
<i>So you're his former student?</i>

516
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:13,125
<i>Yes. It's very humbling.</i>
<i>I know I caused him trouble.</i>

517
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:15,125
<i>What was he like?</i>

518
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,125
<i>Very strict. I wasn't the best student.</i>

519
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,250
Hey.

520
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,750
Read this part.

521
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:31,125
Hello?

522
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:42,250
French is mandatory to graduate,
so it's your own fault.

523
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,625
Araki was gonna let me pass just for
showing, but she had to get pregnant.

524
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,250
Geez.

525
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:55,250
- I'm glad you didn't get the job.
- Why?

526
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:56,833
Just because.

527
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,375
Well, no one'll hire me.

528
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,750
Not even local stations.

529
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:14,375
What the hell? He's such a creep.

530
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,458
I thought Professor Segawa
was all shriveled up.

531
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:24,875
But I'm glad, and it kinda turned me on.

532
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:27,625
Really?

533
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,500
I just had an idea.

534
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:39,125
What?

535
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:40,750
A honeytrap.

536
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:44,750
Honeytrap the professor?

537
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:48,458
Yeah. You gotta help me, Nao.

538
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:49,875
Why?

539
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:56,583
He killed my future,
so I wanna return the favor.

540
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,750
Fair, right?

541
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:04,083
Nuh-uh. I like him.

542
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,375
Are you serious?

543
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:10,000
More than sex with me?

544
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,875
What the heck?

545
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:20,083
No help, no sex. This is goodbye.

546
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:21,458
Huh?

547
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,875
I'll ignore you on campus.

548
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:30,500
- You do that now.
- I'll shut you out.

549
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,375
Poor thing.

550
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,375
Come on.

551
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:47,583
You're the only one I can ask.

552
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:50,458
I wanna keep doing it with you.

553
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:52,875
Then no honeytraps.

554
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:07,083
Our bodies are perfectly compatible.

555
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,875
So, pretty please.

556
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:14,625
- I have to go.
- Come on.

557
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:17,000
Help me feel better.

558
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:21,875
Stop.

559
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:31,458
Oh, Miss Murayama.

560
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,833
You remember me?

561
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:39,125
Of course. How can I help?

562
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:47,125
Um, congratulations on
the Akutagawa Prize.

563
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:50,500
Thank you.

564
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:54,750
May I have your autograph?

565
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:57,083
Oh, sure.

566
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,625
I really enjoyed it.

567
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:03,375
Thank you. Come in.

568
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:10,250
Sorry. Please leave it open.

569
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,500
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

570
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,958
That's all right.

571
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:32,833
Can you sign right here?

572
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,208
Not the cover?

573
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:41,583
I really love the picture that
you've painted here.

574
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:46,750
Your signature here would
make me happy every time I read it.

575
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:49,958
Is that okay?

576
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,750
Yes...of course.

577
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:14,250
Thank you so much.

578
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:18,250
No, thank you.

579
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:20,250
Wow.

580
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:26,458
I'm really happy that
you won, Professor.

581
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:31,000
I was in your French class
my first and second year.

582
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:33,250
Yes, I remember.

583
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,250
That was over a year ago...

584
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,000
I'm impressed.

585
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:41,625
Well, you stood out.

586
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:48,083
Right. I'm much older
than everyone else.

587
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,250
No, not for that reason.

588
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,458
You asked many questions
during and after class.

589
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:58,125
Yes, that's me.

590
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:02,708
I especially enjoyed your classes.

591
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:06,833
You're very thorough,
and your French is beautiful.

592
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,750
Not at all.

593
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:16,583
Um, if you have time,
and you don't mind...

594
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,125
Yes?

595
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:22,875
May I ask you questions
about your book?

596
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:26,250
Oh, sure.

597
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:29,125
Are you busy now?

598
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,375
No, I'm free.

599
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:38,375
- Would you like to go to a cafe?
- No, here is fine.

600
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,000
I'll pour us tea.

601
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:45,375
- You don't have to.
- It's all right.

602
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,250
Please sit.

603
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:51,875
So what year are you now?

604
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:56,583
Fourth. Time really does fly.

605
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,125
Do you have a job lined up?

606
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,250
Not exactly.

607
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:06,875
- I'll just be a housewife again.
- So you're married?

608
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,125
Yes. I have a daughter too.

609
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:14,125
Going back to school
must've been difficult.

610
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,500
I wanted to study psychology.

611
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:21,250
Here you go.
It's quite humid.

612
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:23,708
Thank you.

613
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:31,250
Grad school is out of the question,
so I won't be able to finish.

614
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,208
I see.

615
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:38,000
Enough about me.
I want to hear about you.

616
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:43,750
- But I don't know what to ask...
- Anything.

617
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:51,708
Do you have a family?
Are you married?

618
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,125
No, I'm single.

619
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,500
I'm sorry. You meant
anything about your book.

620
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,708
I did think of questions.

621
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:11,375
About the scene
on this page you autographed...

622
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:16,500
It's very fascinating.

623
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:25,833
"I held myself upright
with the back of my hand"

624
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:30,958
"so that it wouldn't get in the way
while she shaved me."

625
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:38,208
"She treated my testicles like
a little bird with a broken wing."

626
00:51:40,042 --> 00:51:46,250
"She had little interest in my penis
and only occasionally supported it"

627
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:50,083
"with the back of her hand
as she shaved."

628
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:54,375
"My penis gradually stiffened."

629
00:51:55,250 --> 00:52:00,833
"But she kept sliding the razor
at a constant speed"

630
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,500
"over the tight skin of my testicles."

631
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,250
"After shaving,"

632
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:15,250
"she gently washed off the shaving cream
with a towel seeped in lukewarm water."

633
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:19,083
"Not to leave any hairs behind,"

634
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,750
"she carefully went between
my testicles and the metal wash basin."

635
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:36,250
"After the last wipe, when nothing stood
between her and my smooth testicles,"

636
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:40,333
"she smiled proudly for the first time."

637
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:47,875
"Then she opened her mouth to the extent
her craftsmanship wasn't undermined,"

638
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:52,458
"and placed my right testicle
in her mouth."

639
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:02,125
"My penis was so stiff that it
no longer needed to be supported,"

640
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:07,500
"but she turned her palm
and gently held it up."

641
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,875
"I felt nothing but her courtesy"

642
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:18,458
"so nothing would interfere while
she had my testicle in her mouth."

643
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:24,458
"Just as a carpenter measures
a bolt with a caliper,"

644
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:31,583
"she tried to match the size
of her mouth and my testicle."

645
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:37,375
"Every time she opened her mouth wide,"

646
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:45,375
"I hoped my testicle would
expand enough to fill the gaps."

647
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:46,875
Pardon me.

648
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:19,458
"Other than to wipe her drool,
she focused on measuring"

649
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:27,083
"the size of my right testicle as she
moved her chin and tongue up and down."

650
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,208
"Seeing her simply work,"

651
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:39,125
"I felt utterly embarrassed
of my stiff penis."

652
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:45,208
"My humiliation and its hardness
were proportionate,"

653
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:49,000
"and the shame turned into aching pain."

654
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:58,708
"The moment she inhaled a particularly
big breath with drool, I ejaculated."

655
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:03,250
"She let go of my right testicle."

656
00:55:04,042 --> 00:55:07,583
"While holding my withering penis
in her left hand,"

657
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:13,750
"she said, 'I'm sorry.'
without taking a single look at me."

658
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:18,125
"She slowly opened her mouth again,"

659
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:22,375
"swallowed my left testicle,
and began measuring."

660
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,625
"With my penis still withered,
I ejaculated once more."

661
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:33,875
"Before she could apologize,"

662
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:38,208
"I knelt and touched the floor
with my forehead."

663
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:43,708
"Tears welled. I continued to tremble."

664
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:47,958
"I let my fluids flow for a while."

665
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:57,750
Professor...

666
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:00,250
Yes?

667
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:04,875
What makes you write like this?

668
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:07,625
What...

669
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,333
The answer is complex.

670
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:16,875
Complex?

671
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,750
First is story structure.

672
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:25,125
Simply put, it appeals to
a certain type of readers.

673
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:28,750
Having this appear in the middle,

674
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:34,333
I figured readers would want to
continue reading until the end.

675
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:38,458
One judge strongly rejected my book.

676
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:43,750
She said this scene
cheapened the novel greatly.

677
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,833
Perhaps it's true.

678
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:50,250
I liked this scene.

679
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:55,625
I got the impression that
you enjoyed writing this part.

680
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,208
Perhaps.

681
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:04,083
However, it's what the words wanted,
rather than what I wanted.

682
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:06,500
The words?

683
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,750
That's my other reason.

684
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:14,000
Their arrangement is determined by
their relationship.

685
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:19,208
Words ask for words,
which is different from what I ask for.

686
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:24,500
If the resulting sequence of words
is correct by my standards,

687
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,125
I leave them as is.

688
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:31,250
Were you erect as you wrote this?

689
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:36,375
Perhaps...

690
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,375
I thought so.

691
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:48,375
I think I must be.
That's what the scene should evoke.

692
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:50,750
Of course.

693
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:11,375
I was happy to read this excerpt.

694
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:13,833
How so?

695
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:18,500
I'm weak when it comes to sex.

696
00:58:19,292 --> 00:58:20,625
You are?

697
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:22,625
Yes.

698
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,875
I often lose to sexual temptation.

699
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,500
- Often?
- Yes.

700
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:35,125
I can't refuse men I feel attracted to.

701
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,500
I'm in a few relationships now.

702
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:52,333
What I wanted to say is that maybe
you have the same weakness.

703
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:55,875
Like giving into sexual temptation?

704
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,500
Yes.

705
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:02,000
Well, perhaps.

706
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:08,333
To write a novel, you also need to
make the most of your weaknesses.

707
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:13,333
Have you ever given in?

708
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:20,625
My life is quite boring.
I've never encountered any temptations.

709
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:24,333
If I had, I would've
immediately tripped.

710
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:30,000
Can someone who's lived
a boring life write a novel?

711
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:37,500
I merely maximize
what can be expressed in words.

712
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,500
There's no room for my experiences.

713
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:45,375
The words resonate with
the reader's experience.

714
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,458
For example, your experience.

715
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,208
My experience?

716
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:57,083
Pardon my intrusiveness,

717
00:59:57,542 --> 01:00:00,250
but you said sex is your weakness.

718
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:02,583
Yes.

719
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,875
Are you concerned about that?

720
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:12,500
If you are, perhaps you should be
speaking to a counselor, not me.

721
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:21,375
I'm scared that my husband
may find out some day.

722
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:26,000
But personality-wise,
I'm not too worried

723
01:00:26,792 --> 01:00:29,000
since I'm not addicted to it.

724
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:35,875
I just feel I simply need
slightly stronger will power.

725
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:41,000
To me, you seem to have
a very strong will power,

726
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:44,333
compared to other students.

727
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:47,250
Thank you.

728
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:51,458
- I am much older.
- No.

729
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:56,000
It's not about age, it's about talent.

730
01:00:57,542 --> 01:01:00,375
What sort of talent would that be?

731
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,000
Your ability to be indescribable
and remain undefined.

732
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:15,208
Simply put, you can think and act
without being bound by common sense.

733
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:19,750
That's very difficult,
especially in Japanese society.

734
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:23,458
It's not that big of a deal.

735
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:29,375
My libido is just stronger than others,
or my self-control is weaker.

736
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:33,875
I don't fit well with
other people's standards.

737
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:38,583
That's what I'm saying.
I think it's wonderful.

738
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:41,083
Is it?

739
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:47,833
I've never thought
I was better than others in any way.

740
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:52,208
I think that's also
a sign of your intelligence.

741
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:58,958
You're amazing, Professor.

742
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:01,000
How so?

743
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:05,458
Nobody's ever been this sure about me.

744
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:07,500
Is that so?

745
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:13,250
But I disagree. I'm a fool.

746
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:18,750
If so, please persuade me
because I don't think so.

747
01:02:20,292 --> 01:02:26,125
That'll take a while since
I'd have to start with my childhood.

748
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,958
You'd probably tell me to
see a counselor again.

749
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,958
I apologize for my rudeness.

750
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:38,000
However, counseling is not a bad thing.

751
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:39,875
I agree.

752
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:43,750
I should go one day.

753
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:52,708
I think this is all I need
to prove my foolishness.

754
01:02:54,667 --> 01:03:01,500
Did you know that I was trying
to tempt you this entire time?

755
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:06,500
No, it never crossed my mind.

756
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,458
Then what did you think was happening?

757
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:15,458
I just thought you were very strange.

758
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:23,625
To be honest, I was a little scared.

759
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:27,500
I'd be scared too.

760
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:34,625
I think I was wary because
I didn't understand your behavior.

761
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,708
I was trying to seduce you.

762
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:43,875
My aim was to elicit
statements and actions

763
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,958
that would lead you to seduce me.

764
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,000
What for?

765
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:55,125
To record it and sell it to the media.

766
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,250
Are you recording now?

767
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:05,625
- Yes, I'll stop...
- The whole time?

768
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:08,625
While you read aloud?

769
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:13,125
Yes, it was recording.

770
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:20,000
Unbelievable...

771
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:37,625
- I'm sorry.
- Please listen.

772
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,333
I hope you don't misunderstand me.

773
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:50,250
May I have the data?

774
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:58,375
While listening,
I wished I was recording it

775
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:01,708
because this may never happen again.

776
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:04,333
But you had been.

777
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:10,000
I'mâŚexcited.

778
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:14,958
I'm sure this is awkward for you.

779
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:18,958
The part you read
can also be misleading.

780
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:25,125
Having someone with such
a beautiful voice read my writing

781
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,333
was exhilarating.

782
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,458
I never knew.

783
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:34,875
You'll have many opportunities
in the future.

784
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:38,875
No, it's your voice that was incredible.

785
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:44,750
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

786
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:54,500
Don't you...want to know why
I tried to trap you?

787
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:59,625
Isn't it because you dislike me?

788
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:05,250
No. I've no reason to dislike you.

789
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:09,500
You may be disliked
just for being you.

790
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:17,875
But I can't change who I am.

791
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:24,750
In that case, what should I do...

792
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:30,750
if I'm hated for just being me.

793
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,625
I don't know.

794
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:39,375
If who I am,
something I can't change,

795
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:45,708
makes people nauseous, what am I to do?

796
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:03,250
I don't know what happened in your life.

797
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:11,375
But if people around you made you think
you're worthless, please fight back.

798
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:17,000
Refuse when society's ruler
tries to measure you.

799
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:23,250
You must embrace your own value
that only you know.

800
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:30,625
It's very painful to do it alone.
Still, you must do it.

801
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:36,250
Because only those who do
can unexpectedly connect with

802
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,208
and encourage somebody.

803
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,625
It may never happen,

804
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:47,750
but if nobody does it,
it won't ever happen.

805
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,333
Not anyone can.

806
01:07:55,167 --> 01:08:01,125
You were talented enough
to be recognized by society.

807
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:05,583
That's why you can say that.

808
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,625
True.

809
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:17,125
I wish we had been able to
talk like this before the prize.

810
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:23,458
But if I didn't win,
we wouldn't be here.

811
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,500
You're right.

812
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:35,333
I'm sorry. I should've
read your book sooner.

813
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,333
There are many other books
you should be reading.

814
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:44,000
I haven't read much else.

815
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:47,750
That makes me envious.

816
01:08:56,417 --> 01:09:00,375
How shall I send you the data?

817
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:02,750
Can you e-mail it?

818
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:06,125
Yes, I'm sure I can.

819
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:11,125
Please send it to "segawa"
with the university domain.

820
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:13,875
Okay.

821
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:22,625
When you receive the data,
do you plan on doing anything peculiar?

822
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:24,000
Peculiar?

823
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:29,875
- I mean masturbate.
- No, I don't think so.

824
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,750
Then I can't give it to you.

825
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:40,125
If you want the data,
you have to promise me

826
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:46,625
that you'll masturbate to my voice
at least one time.

827
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:49,375
Then you can have it.

828
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:58,375
I understand. I promise to masturbate
at least once to your voice.

829
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,750
Okay, I'll send it.

830
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:04,833
Thank you.

831
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:11,208
Would you mind if I think of you too?

832
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,250
Please feel free.

833
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:28,708
If you like, I'll send you a recording
of me reading from start to finish.

834
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,750
You'll do that?

835
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:39,250
I'm happy that somebody likes my voice,
and that somebody's you.

836
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,125
It won't be easy.

837
01:10:42,292 --> 01:10:44,125
It'll be my pleasure.

838
01:10:44,917 --> 01:10:46,500
Thank you very much.

839
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:49,875

840
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:57,000
I appreciate it.

<i>It was fun.</i>

851

- We're home.
- Welcome back.

853
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:30,750
- I thought you went out.
- Huh? Oh, my plans changed.

854
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,500
Sagawa Express left a delivery note.

855
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,125
Really?

856
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,125
- Yamato.
- Thank you! Yamato?

857
01:12:38,417 --> 01:12:41,208
It's "Sagawa," not Yamato.

858

That's right.

We're out of groceries,
so let's eat out.

861
01:12:50,542 --> 01:12:53,708
Okay, well, what do you want to eat?

862

You haven't changed a bit.

868
01:13:57,792 --> 01:14:00,250
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

869

Oh, man. Why are you here?

870

I feel like you've changed.

Well, yeah. How long has it been?

872
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:12,500
What are you up to?

873
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,958
- I work as a proofreader.
- No way.

874
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:20,125
My company just got rid of
our proofreading department.

875

What do you do now?

876
01:14:24,792 --> 01:14:28,000
Publishing. I'm an editor.

877
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:32,000
I'm in charge of literature.
Hilarious, right?

878
01:14:33,292 --> 01:14:35,458
Give me your business card.

879
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,875
Why?

880
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:42,375
We're gonna be outsourcing
our proofreading.

881
01:14:44,417 --> 01:14:48,750
- I don't have any on me.
- What's your company called?

882
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,083
It's a secret.

883
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:51,458
Woah.

884
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:53,875
What?

885
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:56,125
Are you mad at me?

886
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:03,458
You don't even read novels.

887
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:09,958
Well, I will now, but I think
that's what makes me unique.

888
01:15:11,292 --> 01:15:14,208
It's probably why they gave me the job.

889
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:17,750
Being all scholarly is boring.

890

- It doesn't sell.
- Sorry.

Can you please shut up?

892
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:42,750
You know, it's not all my fault
Segawa quit and you got a divorce.

893
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:47,125
You're barking up the wrong tree.

894
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:50,875
I know.

895
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:53,750
It was priceless, though,

when admin got your
sexy e-mail by mistake.

897

- Segawa and Sagawa...
- Stop.

898
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:06,500
I can't believe you mixed up the two.

899
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:09,875
It's still funny.

900
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:12,833
I can't believe it either.

901
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:19,250
Well, Nao,
I feel bad I had you do all that.

902

But I'm hella grateful.

903
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:26,125
My own stupidity makes me wanna cry.

904
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:33,375
We don't hear about him anymore.
I wonder what he's up to?

905
01:16:34,167 --> 01:16:35,375
I don't know.

906
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,333
Is he even alive?

907
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:51,083
- You can ask him to write a book.
- Nope. He disappeared pretty much.

908
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:54,875
You can get leads from
other editors, can't you?

909
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:56,750
Why would I?

910
01:16:57,292 --> 01:17:02,000
Someday, you can edit his work,

911
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:07,333
and I can proofread it.

912
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,125
No way.

913
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:15,750

- Not in the least.

I used to come here when
I was in high school, remember?

976
01:23:46,292 --> 01:23:48,625
Sorry, I have bad memory.

977
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:50,375
It's okay.

978
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,083
This is so good.

979
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:53,458
I'm grateful.

980
01:23:54,417 --> 01:23:56,500
- Come again soon.
- I will!

981
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:26,833
<i>Sendai Station</i>

982
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:54,875
Wait upstairs.

983
01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:56,875
Should I come down?

984
01:24:57,042 --> 01:24:58,208
Wait upstairs!

985
01:24:58,417 --> 01:24:59,500
Got it.

986
01:25:15,167 --> 01:25:18,000
- What a surprise!
- Yeah.

987
01:25:18,167 --> 01:25:19,500
Unbelievable!

988
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:21,000
Why are you here?

989
01:25:22,042 --> 01:25:23,125
For the reunion.

990
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:25,625
High school reunion?

991
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:29,125
- I didn't know about it.
- Really?

992
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:33,875
I bet it's 'cause my surname
and address changed.

993
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:36,625
Yeah, but I got to meet you.

994
01:25:36,792 --> 01:25:38,500
Right. I'm glad.

995
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:42,083
Still live in Tokyo?

996
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:43,000
Yeah.

997
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,083
- Heading back?
- Yeah.

998
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:48,208
Do you have time?

999
01:25:49,292 --> 01:25:51,625
- Oh...
- Can we go for tea?

1000
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:57,750
It's a silly reason to ruin
this dramatic meeting...

1001
01:25:58,792 --> 01:26:02,875
But I need to be home for a delivery
between 2 and 4 PM.

1002
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:04,000
Oh, I see.

1003
01:26:04,167 --> 01:26:07,875
I'm not saying "no."
Come home with me.

1004
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:11,250
If you have time, that is.
Let's have tea.

1005
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,250
I have time,
but is it really okay?

1006
01:26:14,417 --> 01:26:17,458
Of course.
Nobody's home during the day.

1007
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:18,500
Sound good?

1008
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:19,708
Sure.

1009
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:23,750
It's a 15-minute walk, near Kadan.

1010
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,375
That's a nice place.

1011
01:26:25,917 --> 01:26:27,500
It is convenient.

1012
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,750
Who were at the reunion?

1013
01:26:37,917 --> 01:26:40,250
I couldn't tell who was who.

1014
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:44,000
It's been 20 years,
and their last names changed.

1015
01:26:44,167 --> 01:26:45,250
Right.

1016
01:26:45,417 --> 01:26:48,333
I couldn't keep up the chitchat.

1017
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:51,125
Bet they didn't recognize me, too.

1018
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:54,833
You must think I had no friends.

1019
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:56,250
No, I don't.

1020
01:26:56,542 --> 01:26:59,250
Then I guess it was all in my head.

1021
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:04,875
But I did talk with Kiyomiya
from the art club.

1022
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:06,458
Kiyomiya?

1023
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:08,250
Don't remember.

1024
01:27:08,417 --> 01:27:11,125
She's a school art teacher now.

1025
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:12,625
Oh, really.

1026
01:27:12,792 --> 01:27:16,208
She said she had wanted me
to model for her.

1027
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:17,625
A nude model?

1028
01:27:17,792 --> 01:27:19,208
No way!

1029
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,625
I'm not sure, though.

1030
01:27:21,792 --> 01:27:23,500
You were cool back then.

1031
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:26,875
Kiyomiya said I hadn't changed a bit.

1032
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:28,625
That can't be true.

1033
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:31,708
Maybe so. We both changed.

1034
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:36,125
What do you do?

1035
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:39,333
I'm a systems engineer. IT laborer.

1036
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,875
So it means...

1037
01:27:41,042 --> 01:27:44,333
- Yup, I'm out of a job now.
- That's too bad.

1038
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:50,458
But I have savings, and IT workers
get extra unemployment benefits.

1039
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:52,958
I'll just take it as a break.

1040
01:27:53,417 --> 01:27:54,500
That's good.

1041
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,750
Hello.

1042
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,333
- Hot, isn't it?
- It is.

1043
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:03,458
- Yu had fun at your home.
- I'm glad.

1044
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:06,625
Hitomi can come play anytime, too.

1045
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,333
Thanks, she'd love that.

1046
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:12,125
- Good day.
- Good day.

1047
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:18,708
It's kind of surreal.

1048
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:19,833
Is it?

1049
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:21,375
How old's your kid?

1050
01:28:21,667 --> 01:28:24,875
I've got a son who's 16,
and a daughter who's14.

1051
01:28:25,042 --> 01:28:26,750
- Really.
- Yup.

1052
01:28:27,417 --> 01:28:29,333
- Incredible.
- It's not.

1053
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:31,208
Here we are.

1054
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,500
Wow.

1055
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:44,625
"Kobayashi."

1056
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:53,750
Come in.

1057
01:29:01,542 --> 01:29:03,333
Put your bag anywhere.

1058
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:07,750
Your partner...

1059
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,375
What's his job?

1060
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:14,250
He's an R&D in a pharmaceutical company.

1061
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,625
Makes sense.

1062
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:17,875
- What does?
- Nothing.

1063
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,583
Any affects?

1064
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:21,500
Of the virus?

1065
01:29:22,292 --> 01:29:27,208
His research data got leaked,
but so did other companies.

1066
01:29:28,042 --> 01:29:32,458
All he needs for work is the
microscope, so we're fine.

1067
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:33,625
I see.

1068
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:35,958
What'd you do today?

1069
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:39,625
- I had a tea class.
- Really?

1070
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:40,625
What?

1071
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:46,750
Sort of unexpected, but I bet
you're cut out for tea ceremonies.

1072
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:48,458
Thanks.

1073
01:29:48,792 --> 01:29:51,250
But I'm making normal tea for now.

1074
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:53,375
I'm fine with it.

1075
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,375
Want sweet bean jelly? I froze it.

1076
01:29:58,542 --> 01:30:01,125
- It's top-notch.
- You don't mind?

1077
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,500
My family doesn't like it as I do.

1078
01:30:04,667 --> 01:30:06,000
What a waste.

1079
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:08,958
Can I help?

1080
01:30:09,125 --> 01:30:11,125
It's okay. Just relax.

1081
01:30:17,875 --> 01:30:20,208
- Don't touch it!
- Sorry.

1082
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:21,750
I'm sorry.

1083
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:25,833
Is your kid a fan?

1084
01:30:26,042 --> 01:30:27,583
Yeah, my son is.

1085
01:30:27,792 --> 01:30:28,833
I see.

1086
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,500
I'm embarrassed.

1087
01:30:31,042 --> 01:30:33,625
But anime these days are intriguing.

1088
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:36,625
Today's package is
a Blu-ray for an anime.

1089
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:41,250
Because all the VOD services
don't work anymore.

1090
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:44,625
I missed the package two days ago.

1091
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:47,458
My son gets cranky, you know?

1092
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:49,083
Do you watch it too?

1093
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:51,083
No. Do you?

1094
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,875
I binge watch to kill time now.

1095
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:00,250
I don't get it anymore.
Can't keep up with the conversation.

1096
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:03,500
- You can, if you watch it.
- Maybe.

1097
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,875
But I'm not interested.

1098
01:31:06,667 --> 01:31:11,125
I don't mind what people like,
but I'm not interested.

1099
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:23,500
It's my mother-in-law's.

1100
01:31:23,917 --> 01:31:25,625
Oh, really.

1101
01:31:27,667 --> 01:31:29,500
You still play the piano?

1102
01:31:30,292 --> 01:31:31,083
Huh?

1103
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:32,500
Not at all.

1104
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:34,583
I see.

1105
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:38,583
I only play for
my daughter's violin, too.

1106
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,375
You seem to be scared of silence.

1107
01:31:44,792 --> 01:31:45,750
Do I?

1108
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:52,000
You keep avoiding what's important.
Even though it's been 20 years.

1109
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,750
What's important?

1110
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,833
Are you happy right now?

1111
01:31:58,667 --> 01:31:59,625
Oh...

1112
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:05,125
It sounds silly to ask
after seeing this house.

1113
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:08,375
But that's my only question.

1114
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:12,875
I haven't thought about it.

1115
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:15,875
You shouldn't have to think.

1116
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:22,875
I can't say.

1117
01:32:36,042 --> 01:32:39,625
I do my best to get by every day.

1118
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:44,875
There were hard times,
but I wasn't miserable.

1119
01:32:45,792 --> 01:32:49,458
Objectively speaking,
I must be very happy.

1120
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:56,708
I feel I'd get scolded
if I say I'm not happy.

1121
01:32:57,542 --> 01:33:00,125
I'm asking what you think.

1122
01:33:02,542 --> 01:33:03,750
I don't know...

1123
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:12,625
Are you happy?

1124
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:15,583
I'm not.

1125
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:18,375
Why? Because of your job?

1126
01:33:18,792 --> 01:33:19,708
No.

1127
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:27,583
Because I've been regretting
not fighting for my feelings.

1128
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:33,125
I shouldn't have given up,
even if the result was the same.

1129
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,583
But I was ignorant then.

1130
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:38,375
I was scared to be hurt more.

1131
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:41,750
That's why I came here to see you.

1132
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:42,833
Hold on.

1133
01:33:47,917 --> 01:33:53,000
Let me clarify 'cause this conversation
seems important to you.

1134
01:33:53,542 --> 01:33:54,375
What?

1135
01:33:55,792 --> 01:34:00,833
To be honest,
I can't remember your name.

1136
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:04,083
Are you serious?

1137
01:34:04,292 --> 01:34:09,083
I'm sorry. I hoped I'd recall,
or you'd say it as we talked.

1138
01:34:10,167 --> 01:34:12,500
How could you forget?

1139
01:34:13,292 --> 01:34:15,208
Then it made me wonder.

1140
01:34:15,792 --> 01:34:16,708
What?

1141
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:19,708
Do you know my name?

1142
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:21,875
Of course, I do.

1143
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:24,083
Then who am I?

1144
01:34:26,417 --> 01:34:27,875
Mika Yuki.

1145
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:29,000
Oh...

1146
01:34:30,792 --> 01:34:31,875
Aya Kobayashi.

1147
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,750
My name's Aya Kobayashi.

1148
01:34:42,167 --> 01:34:46,375
My maiden name's Nomura.
I'm not Mika Yuki either way.

1149
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,583
- You're not Mika?
- No.

1150
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:53,625
I'm Aya Kobayashi,
and not your classmate.

1151
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:56,375
You got the wrong person.

1152
01:34:57,292 --> 01:35:01,500
But...you remembered me.

1153
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:03,708
Well...

1154
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:10,083
We met on the escalator, right?

1155
01:35:10,542 --> 01:35:11,375
Yeah.

1156
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:18,875
When we passed each other,
you looked at me all surprised.

1157
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:25,083
So I thought you must be someone I know.

1158
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:30,958
When I went back up, you came down,
and I panicked.

1159
01:35:31,417 --> 01:35:35,125
I was trying hard to recollect.
Then it hit me.

1160
01:35:36,167 --> 01:35:40,083
"She's my classmate
that went to Tokyo for college."

1161
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:43,250
Doesn't that mean you know me?

1162
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,250
Where's your school?

1163
01:35:45,667 --> 01:35:47,250
Miyagi Girls' High.

1164
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:49,500
I went to Sendai High.

1165
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:58,750
See? I'm sorry, it was my mistake.

1166
01:35:59,417 --> 01:36:01,875
I mean, <i>our</i> mistake.

1167
01:36:03,042 --> 01:36:05,250
I don't believe this...

1168
01:36:06,292 --> 01:36:10,833
You must've wanted to see her badly.

1169
01:36:13,042 --> 01:36:15,583
Yes, that's right.

1170
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:19,333
I missed her so much.

1171
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:27,125
That must be why you mistook me,
with similar age, for Mika.

1172
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:31,500
That can't be.

1173
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:34,833
But you haven't seen her 20 years.

1174
01:36:39,417 --> 01:36:41,333
Did you keep in touch?

1175
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:43,458
No.

1176
01:36:44,917 --> 01:36:48,125
Cause I heard
she married after college.

1177
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:54,458
Could it be that
you and Mika were lovers?

1178
01:37:04,042 --> 01:37:05,000
I'm sorry.

1179
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:11,833
Whoa, excuse me.

1180
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I brought your package.

1181
01:37:15,792 --> 01:37:16,875
Thank you.

1182
01:37:17,167 --> 01:37:19,250
Please sign here.

1183
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:20,458
Sure.

1184
01:37:24,542 --> 01:37:25,750
<i>Kobayashi</i>

1185
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,458
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1186
01:37:40,167 --> 01:37:42,125
Why don't you stay longer?

1187
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:46,250
The sweet bean jelly and kettle's ready.

1188
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,500
It's like a sweet bean popsicle!

1189
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:40,500
Right?

1190
01:38:41,417 --> 01:38:43,333
A high-grade version.

1191
01:38:49,042 --> 01:38:51,375
Are you sure you're not Mika?

1192
01:38:52,042 --> 01:38:54,500
I'm not Mika. Sorry.

1193
01:38:55,375 --> 01:38:57,500
Ugh.

1194
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:05,833
Was Mika your first love?

1195
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,208
I'm not sure about that.

1196
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:13,375
But she was my first partner.

1197
01:39:17,792 --> 01:39:20,125
We dated at the end of high school

1198
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:24,000
and did long-distance
after I moved to Tokyo.

1199
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:26,875
Then, she got a boyfriend.

1200
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:28,125
Oh...

1201
01:39:29,417 --> 01:39:33,250
She wasn't like me,
so I should've seen it coming.

1202
01:39:33,792 --> 01:39:36,375
But I was oblivious somehow.

1203
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:40,875
You mean, only you
were a genuine lesbian?

1204
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:42,125
Genuine?

1205
01:39:43,292 --> 01:39:44,208
Yeah.

1206
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:51,375
We were planning to live together
in Tokyo after college.

1207
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,750
But broke up when she cheated...
I mean, changed.

1208
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:57,500
I see.

1209
01:39:58,667 --> 01:39:59,875
Never saw her again?

1210
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:04,250
Yeah. Afterward, someone
told me she married the guy.

1211
01:40:05,417 --> 01:40:07,333
Did you love her?

1212
01:40:19,042 --> 01:40:20,125
My husband...

1213
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,833
He was contacting his high school ex.

1214
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Really?

1215
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,250
I found out because the virus
sent his emails to me.

1216
01:40:35,667 --> 01:40:40,125
You know, you can see
the history of their responses.

1217
01:40:40,292 --> 01:40:41,125
Yeah.

1218
01:40:42,875 --> 01:40:49,625
He wrote in the email, "I really
want to see you, but we shouldn't."

1219
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:53,875
"I know we love our families."

1220
01:40:54,292 --> 01:40:55,375
He's faithful.

1221
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:57,333
He is.

1222
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,208
How did you feel?

1223
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:06,125
It's hard to put it into words.

1224
01:41:07,542 --> 01:41:10,083
But it was beautifully written.

1225
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,750
I was surprised by his words.

1226
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:15,125
What words?

1227
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:27,125
"The things you said to me
keeps me going even now."

1228
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:35,625
"Your existence is my anchor,
even to this day."

1229
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:43,583
"Meeting you was one of the best things
that has ever happened in my life."

1230
01:41:44,042 --> 01:41:45,375
Wow.

1231
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:48,625
I kept rereading it.

1232
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,375
But isn't there only one "best thing"?

1233
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:56,625
Yeah, it's a weird expression.

1234
01:41:56,917 --> 01:41:59,458
Did you tell him you read it?

1235
01:41:59,917 --> 01:42:00,875
No.

1236
01:42:01,167 --> 01:42:04,750
Did your partner...
I mean, Mr. Husband notice?

1237
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:06,083
"Mr. Husband"?

1238
01:42:07,792 --> 01:42:11,833
I'm not sure.
I think he was too busy back then.

1239
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:16,333
Almost everything was leaked.

1240
01:42:16,917 --> 01:42:20,208
I bet he couldn't tell what got exposed.

1241
01:42:22,292 --> 01:42:23,750
Not gonna tell him?

1242
01:42:25,542 --> 01:42:28,750
It'll only make things awkward.

1243
01:42:31,167 --> 01:42:34,750
He did contact her, after all.

1244
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,833
And wanted to see her.

1245
01:42:39,292 --> 01:42:40,625
Can't forgive him?

1246
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,125
For just the thought?

1247
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:55,250
I think you can't stop
wanting to see someone.

1248
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:58,500
You don't have to be so understanding.

1249
01:43:02,292 --> 01:43:05,833
Sorry. I don't even know you.

1250
01:43:07,792 --> 01:43:08,750
It's okay.

1251
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,958
Do I look understanding?

1252
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:22,625
What's wrong?

1253
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,708
I keep seeing Mika in you.

1254
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:29,250
Do I resemble her that much?

1255
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:32,625
Maybe it's the vibe you give off.

1256
01:43:33,417 --> 01:43:38,125
You look exactly like
what I imagined she'd look now.

1257
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,750
Was Mika understanding?

1258
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:42,000
Not at all.

1259
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:47,958
She looks it,
but you can't reason with her.

1260
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:50,333
Maybe she's really like me.

1261
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I can play Mika if you'd like.

1262
01:44:01,542 --> 01:44:02,625
Play her?

1263
01:44:04,042 --> 01:44:07,250
It seems like a waste.

1264
01:44:07,417 --> 01:44:08,500
Of what?

1265
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:10,625
The dramatic meeting.

1266
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:12,833
What do you mean?

1267
01:44:13,042 --> 01:44:15,625
My looks and personality seem to fit.

1268
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:19,375
- That's not the point.
- I may not be good enough.

1269
01:44:20,667 --> 01:44:26,250
But I know it's something
that means a lot to you.

1270
01:44:32,792 --> 01:44:36,333
I know it's late,
but can I ask your name?

1271
01:44:40,792 --> 01:44:42,208
Natsuko Higuchi.

1272
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500
Natsuko means "summer child."

1273
01:44:46,417 --> 01:44:47,375
Natsuko.

1274
01:44:48,167 --> 01:44:49,250
Lovely name.

1275
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,375
Natsuko...

1276
01:45:02,417 --> 01:45:04,875
You said you weren't happy.

1277
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:09,625
Is it my fault?

1278
01:45:10,125 --> 01:45:12,708
Stop it...

1279
01:45:14,417 --> 01:45:17,625
You didn't date anyone after me?

1280
01:45:19,167 --> 01:45:20,708
There were some.

1281
01:45:21,875 --> 01:45:23,958
But I couldn't truly connect.

1282
01:45:24,167 --> 01:45:26,750
Were you truly connected with me?

1283
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:32,875
Are you mad?

1284
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:36,000
Yeah.

1285
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:40,750
I'm mad.

1286
01:45:44,417 --> 01:45:45,583
I'm sorry.

1287
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,333
Don't be.

1288
01:45:50,375 --> 01:45:51,750
It's not you.

1289
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,250
I'm mad I didn't say
the things I should've.

1290
01:45:58,542 --> 01:46:00,125
Like what?

1291
01:46:01,292 --> 01:46:02,708
What I couldn't say.

1292
01:46:04,542 --> 01:46:10,625
When you gave me your last call,
I was at Shibuya Center-gai.

1293
01:46:11,417 --> 01:46:16,750
The trending song and
deeply tanned girls were real noisy.

1294
01:46:19,667 --> 01:46:23,875
But I could hear your voice clearly.

1295
01:46:24,917 --> 01:46:27,625
You sounded determined.

1296
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:34,125
I sensed you had suffered enough
before you made the call.

1297
01:46:35,167 --> 01:46:38,375
So, I couldn't say anything.

1298
01:46:39,542 --> 01:46:44,208
I knew if I did, it would only
make you suffer more.

1299
01:46:45,417 --> 01:46:50,250
That's why I hung up
and never called again.

1300
01:46:52,417 --> 01:46:54,958
But I wanted to say was

1301
01:46:55,917 --> 01:46:59,500
you're my one and only love.

1302
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,958
You may be able to love someone else,

1303
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:11,000
but I can't love anyone else.

1304
01:47:14,417 --> 01:47:20,000
Being together with me
may complicate your life.

1305
01:47:21,042 --> 01:47:23,708
But I wanted you to choose me.

1306
01:47:24,917 --> 01:47:26,625
I couldn't say that.

1307
01:47:28,042 --> 01:47:28,875
I see.

1308
01:47:30,542 --> 01:47:36,375
But I didn't come here because
I wanted something from you.

1309
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:42,500
I just wanted to tell you
that I couldn't say those words.

1310
01:47:43,792 --> 01:47:47,333
Even if it made you suffer,
I should've said it.

1311
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:52,958
I know now, the pain
was essential for our lives.

1312
01:47:54,167 --> 01:48:01,125
I assumed you'd have a hole
in your life now, just like me.

1313
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:03,458
So I came.

1314
01:48:05,167 --> 01:48:06,125
A hole?

1315
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:12,875
You must have a hole
that nothing can fill in.

1316
01:48:16,667 --> 01:48:19,250
There's no way for me to fill it.

1317
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:23,375
But I have the same hole as you.

1318
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:29,958
We may be still connected
through that hole.

1319
01:48:31,292 --> 01:48:33,125
I came to tell you that.

1320
01:48:45,542 --> 01:48:46,458
I'm home.

1321
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:53,875
Is it here?

1322
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:03,958
Say hello.

1323
01:49:05,042 --> 01:49:05,833
Hello.

1324
01:49:06,542 --> 01:49:07,958
Nice to meet you.

1325
01:49:18,417 --> 01:49:19,583
He's handsome.

1326
01:49:21,667 --> 01:49:23,750
I thought he'd be a geek.

1327
01:49:25,042 --> 01:49:28,375
He can't even say hello.

1328
01:49:31,875 --> 01:49:33,208
I should be going.

1329
01:49:33,417 --> 01:49:36,000
It's okay. He won't come down.

1330
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:39,500
Your daughter will be back. I'm going.

1331
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,500
Okay. Can I walk you to the station?

1332
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,500
Yeah. Thanks.

1333
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:55,333
Kei, I'm going to walk
my friend to the station.

1334
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,625
So your son's name is Kei.

1335
01:50:11,917 --> 01:50:12,833
Yeah.

1336
01:50:13,375 --> 01:50:14,625
And the girl's Yu.

1337
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:15,625
Right.

1338
01:50:16,792 --> 01:50:17,875
How'd you know?

1339
01:50:18,042 --> 01:50:19,750
You mentioned it.

1340
01:50:20,167 --> 01:50:21,208
Oh, yeah.

1341
01:50:21,792 --> 01:50:24,083
Yu means "to play."

1342
01:50:24,667 --> 01:50:26,083
Nice, simple names.

1343
01:50:26,292 --> 01:50:32,750
We wanted gender-neutral names
so it wouldn't shackle them later.

1344
01:50:32,917 --> 01:50:34,500
You're progressive.

1345
01:50:35,667 --> 01:50:37,500
What's Mr. Husband like?

1346
01:50:40,542 --> 01:50:43,375
He's a steady, diligent person.

1347
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:45,875
That might be the best.

1348
01:50:46,042 --> 01:50:49,000
- You think so?
- Well, I don't know him.

1349
01:50:49,167 --> 01:50:53,375
But I felt trust and a little distance
from your tone.

1350
01:50:54,792 --> 01:50:55,875
You're right.

1351
01:50:56,917 --> 01:50:59,375
- But you missed "love."
- Sorry.

1352
01:50:59,792 --> 01:51:00,708
It's okay.

1353
01:51:02,125 --> 01:51:04,375
I've never told anyone before.

1354
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,250
I'm honored.

1355
01:51:07,292 --> 01:51:08,583
I'm amazed.

1356
01:51:18,792 --> 01:51:19,583
What is it?

1357
01:51:20,125 --> 01:51:23,250
Who did you mistake me for?

1358
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:28,250
She was my high school classmate.
A boyish girl.

1359
01:51:28,542 --> 01:51:30,208
Were you two close?

1360
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:34,500
Not really. We weren't that close.

1361
01:51:36,042 --> 01:51:40,250
She often played the piano
alone at lunch break.

1362
01:51:40,667 --> 01:51:44,375
I also played the piano as a hobby.

1363
01:51:45,042 --> 01:51:48,625
So we started meeting
in the music room at lunch.

1364
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:54,000
We took turns playing the piano
during lunch break

1365
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:57,625
and ate listening to each other's piano.

1366
01:51:58,542 --> 01:52:03,000
We didn't talk in class.
Only in the music room.

1367
01:52:03,167 --> 01:52:05,458
- What a lovely memory.
- Yeah.

1368
01:52:05,917 --> 01:52:07,708
It was sort of special.

1369
01:52:08,667 --> 01:52:11,500
We lost contact after she went to Tokyo.

1370
01:52:15,042 --> 01:52:22,000
<i>Sendai Station</i>

1371
01:52:23,667 --> 01:52:24,500
Hey.

1372
01:52:26,167 --> 01:52:28,250
Let's play pretend again.

1373
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,833
Where should we start?

1374
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,333
I'll be your boyish pianist this time.

1375
01:52:35,542 --> 01:52:37,250
But my memory's hazy.

1376
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:39,875
- It seems unfair.
- Why?

1377
01:52:40,042 --> 01:52:41,083
Let me do it!

1378
01:52:42,917 --> 01:52:45,125
All right. You walk from there.

1379
01:52:45,292 --> 01:52:48,833
We meet when I come up
the escalator, okay?

1380
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,125
It's like a skit.

1381
01:53:28,542 --> 01:53:29,375
Aya?

1382
01:53:31,292 --> 01:53:32,500
Is it you?

1383
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,708
Do you recognize me?

1384
01:53:37,292 --> 01:53:39,208
Yeah, from high school.

1385
01:53:40,042 --> 01:53:42,500
But I can't remember your name.

1386
01:53:42,667 --> 01:53:44,208
It doesn't matter.

1387
01:53:44,792 --> 01:53:47,500
Remember playing the piano together?

1388
01:53:47,667 --> 01:53:48,583
Of course.

1389
01:53:49,125 --> 01:53:51,583
Why are you back from Tokyo?

1390
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:55,375
For the reunion. I'm on my way back.

1391
01:53:55,542 --> 01:53:58,125
Why were you invited, but not me?

1392
01:53:58,292 --> 01:54:00,125
Who knows?

1393
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:05,875
But I'm glad to see you.
I was wondering how you were doing.

1394
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:07,250
You mean it?

1395
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,875
I do.

1396
01:54:09,292 --> 01:54:14,375
I'm glad. I thought no one from
high school would remember me.

1397
01:54:14,542 --> 01:54:19,125
No way. I was secretly proud
that I could talk with you.

1398
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,083
- You were?
- Yeah.

1399
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:27,000
You gave off an antisocial vibe,
but many wanted to talk to you.

1400
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,250
- Are you sure?
- I am.

1401
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:31,250
You were admired.

1402
01:54:31,542 --> 01:54:34,375
Cut it out. You're gonna make me cry.

1403
01:54:37,667 --> 01:54:38,958
How are you doing?

1404
01:54:39,125 --> 01:54:44,000
Good. There are struggles,
but I live every day to the fullest.

1405
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:47,500
I'm so glad you haven't changed.

1406
01:54:48,042 --> 01:54:49,958
And you? Are you good?

1407
01:54:51,667 --> 01:54:55,458
I can't answer straight away like you.

1408
01:54:55,667 --> 01:54:57,000
You're not well?

1409
01:54:57,375 --> 01:54:59,250
- My body's fine.
- Then...

1410
01:55:00,417 --> 01:55:02,958
It's not a big problem.

1411
01:55:03,875 --> 01:55:08,583
But sometimes I wonder why I'm here.

1412
01:55:12,042 --> 01:55:17,125
I could've become anything,
but time flew past before I knew.

1413
01:55:18,542 --> 01:55:20,125
I'm fairly satisfied.

1414
01:55:21,542 --> 01:55:23,750
This is what I chose.

1415
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:27,833
And I know it's wrong to want more.

1416
01:55:30,042 --> 01:55:30,875
But...

1417
01:55:35,292 --> 01:55:39,625
I'm not passionate
about anything anymore.

1418
01:55:42,917 --> 01:55:44,750
I don't know what to do.

1419
01:55:46,250 --> 01:55:47,208
Time is...

1420
01:55:48,417 --> 01:55:50,250
slowly killing me.

1421
01:55:58,125 --> 01:56:01,000
I'm sorry to say this all of a sudden.

1422
01:56:02,042 --> 01:56:02,875
It's okay.

1423
01:56:05,417 --> 01:56:08,500
Can I tell you how I saw you back then?

1424
01:56:09,917 --> 01:56:10,708
Sure.

1425
01:56:12,042 --> 01:56:16,875
You said everyone admired me,
but that's wrong.

1426
01:56:17,417 --> 01:56:22,875
I always felt different,
like everyone observed me from afar.

1427
01:56:24,292 --> 01:56:27,833
I always felt like an outcast.

1428
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:32,250
You were the only one that stepped in.

1429
01:56:32,792 --> 01:56:36,708
It was just one step,
but it meant a lot to me.

1430
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:43,208
You were the only light for me.
I could find you anywhere you were.

1431
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,208
Your existence gave me power.

1432
01:56:50,167 --> 01:56:51,125
It's true.

1433
01:56:51,292 --> 01:56:55,250
You have the ability
to give people power.

1434
01:56:55,417 --> 01:56:57,083
Please remember that.

1435
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:00,375
Thanks.

1436
01:57:02,542 --> 01:57:06,875
But I didn't say <i>everyone</i> admired you.

1437
01:57:07,167 --> 01:57:07,958
Huh?

1438
01:57:08,542 --> 01:57:10,750
I admired you.

1439
01:57:17,875 --> 01:57:18,833
Thank you.

1440
01:57:22,917 --> 01:57:24,500
I'm glad I met you.

1441
01:57:26,167 --> 01:57:28,833
I'm glad I met you, too.

1442
01:57:33,042 --> 01:57:33,750
Bye.

1443
01:57:35,167 --> 01:57:35,958
See you!

1444
01:57:37,542 --> 01:57:38,250
See you.

1445
01:58:52,667 --> 01:58:54,000
- Wait.
- What's wrong?

1446
01:58:55,667 --> 01:58:58,250
- It's nothing big.
- What is it?

1447
01:58:58,875 --> 01:59:01,125
But I can only tell you.

1448
01:59:01,292 --> 01:59:02,625
Tell me anything.

1449
01:59:03,292 --> 01:59:05,125
- I remembered.
- What?

1450
01:59:05,292 --> 01:59:06,250
Her name.

1451
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:09,875
It's Nozomi.

1452
01:59:10,625 --> 01:59:11,583
Nozomi?

1453
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,958
- Nozomi!
- Nozomi!

1454
01:59:19,292 --> 01:59:20,250
And her surname?

1455
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:21,875
Can't remember.
