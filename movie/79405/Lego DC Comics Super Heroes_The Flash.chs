He's tromping all over the jewel of the Metropolis skyline.

91
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,180
他还乱穿马路不守交规
And he's jaywalking.

92
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,880
让我们把他拿下

我还能挺住
I'm holding it together.

102
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,630
好丢人啊
Oh, this is embarrassing.

103
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,100
也没那么好笑吧 考虑下别人的感受好不好
It's not that funny.A little consideration here.

104
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,140

我还能听见！
I can still hear you.

107
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,150
现在这情况属于正常操作吗？
Is this normally how it goes?

108
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,920
正常啊 但是一般来说不会笑成这样
Yeah, but usually with a little less laughter.

109
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,620
这个笑法很危险
That laughter is dangerous.

110
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,920
我们得帮帮这些人
We've gotta help these people

111
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,520
趁他们还没把自己笑死
before they laugh themselves to death.

112
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,630
而且要在小丑祸害其它人之前阻止他
And stop the Joker before he endangers anyone else.

113
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,130
那我们就分头行动吧
Then let's divide and conquer.

114

Whoa, I have got to remember to wait for the water to warm up before jumping in.

125
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,970

Nice.

126

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,680
就做了这么多事
and look at all the good I've done.

143
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,310
轮到大都会了
Time to get to Metropolis

144
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,450
来见识一下正义……
to meet up with the Justice...

145
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,550
哦 这个咕噜咕噜的声音我懂
Oh, I know that grumble.

146
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,720
它是在说 甜甜圈 现在！
And it's saying,"Donuts, now!"

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,750
最好吃的甜甜圈在哪里？
And where are the best donuts?

148
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,060
哥谭市
Gotham City.

149
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,500
所有中了毒气的人都已经安全撤离了
All the victims are safely evacuated.

150
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,870
塑胶人
Plastic Man,

151
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,600
你也中了小丑的毒气了吗？
were you infected by Joker's gas?

152
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,810
没有 都是因为他们笑的那样儿 太搞笑了
No, it's all this laughing.It's hilarious.

153
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,710
救我！
Help me!

154
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,380
塑胶 严肃点
Plas, get serious,

155
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,550
我们必须找到治好这些市民的方法
we have to find a cure for these civilians.

156
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,020
我觉得如果我能改变小丑毒气的分子结构
I wonder if I can alter the molecular structure of Joker's gas

157
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,120
就能造出解毒剂
to create a cure.

158
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,760
- 怎么做？ - 在这等着
- How?- Wait here.

159
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,190
好的
Okay.

160
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,360
假设
Hypothesis.

161
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,430
以这个大小我应该就能找到小丑毒气中
At this size I should be able to find trace elements

162
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,630
飘浮在这个地区空气中的微量元素
of Joker's gas still wafting around the area.

163
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,140
啊哈！
Aha!

164
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,200
一个小丑毒气分子
A Joker gas molecule.

165
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,270
找到这个没啥好玩的
There's nothing funny about this.

166
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,480
现在来做个小小的实验
Now for a little experiment.

167
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,110
他在那儿呢 让我来揍扁这个小丑
- There he is.- I've got this clown.

168
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,750
永远不要低估小丑的实力 火风暴
Never underestimate the Joker, Firestorm.

169
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,190
我绕到他背后去 然后我们用……
I'll fly around behind him and then we'll take him by...

170
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,520
啊？
Huh?

171
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,560
惊不惊喜？
Surprise?

172
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,630
这下惨了 老兄
Not cool, man.

173
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,360
蝙蝠侠会让我把这个糗事记一辈子的
Batman will never let me live this down.

174
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,670
是谁总是逗我乐啊
Whoo hoos always bring a smile to my face.

175
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,910
你得比那个快才能
You've got to be faster than that

176
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,180
偷偷潜入小丑身边
to sneak up on the Joker.

177
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,880
闪电侠去哪儿了？
Where is Flash?

178
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,920
那是闪电侠！
It's the Flash!

179
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,230
天底下最好吃的甜甜圈
Best donut ever.

180
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,790
甜甜圈安全！
Saved the donut.

181
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,500
那谁来救你啊
But who's gonna save you?

182
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,900
冰冻队长？
Captain Cold?

183
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,900
我今天唯一感兴趣的霜就是这块甜甜圈上的糖霜
The only frosting I'm interested in today is on this donut.

184
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,100
马上投降的话 我们就把今天这事当成是
Give up now and we'll chalk it up

185
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,340
全球变暖的祸
to hysteria over global warming.

186
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,040
才不是 今天是全球冷冻的祸
Instead, let's chalk it up to global freezing.

187
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,310
全球冷冻？那根本都不是个正经词儿好吧
"Global freezing"?That doesn't even make sense.

188
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,110
拜托 你可比这个要有料一点
Come on, Cold, you got better material than that.

189
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,320
就叫“零度以下的飞来横祸”怎么样？
How about, "Chances of that are below zero?"

190
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,450
唉 算了
Ah, never mind.

191
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,990
我能看出来我讲的这个冷笑话把你冷到了
I can see my puns leave you cold.

192
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,790
冷啊
Cold.

193
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,990
他随你处置了 警官
He's all yours, Officer.

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,990
现在是时候去大都会了
Now it's off to Metropolis.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,430
多谢了 闪电侠
Thanks, Flash!

196
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,030
嗨 你知道这些甜甜圈配啥最好不？
Hey, you know what goes good with those donuts?

197
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,270
你去没去过那个
You ever been to that

198
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,370
在星城的兰伯特奶昔？
Lampert's Milkshakes in Star City?

199
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,300
没
No.

200
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,110
准备 瞄准…
Ready, aim...

201
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,150
发射！
Fire!

202
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,890
这些机器小丑速度好快
These roboclowns are quick.

203
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,990
每次我来城里观光
Whenever I visit the city,

204
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,330
最喜欢的就是看一场好的演出
I just love to take in a good show.

205
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,930
那你肯定会喜欢我的表演
Then you're gonna love my performance as

206
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,630
我演直升机
a helicopter.

207
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,640
干得好，塑胶人
Well done, Plas.

208
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,040
真棒！好精彩的表演
Bravo! Wonderful performances.

209
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,510
我笑了 我哭了
I laughed, I cried.

210
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,550
我的机器小丑都死了
My roboclowns died.

211
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,620
给你最热烈的粉丝拍张照如何？
Photo for your biggest fan?

212
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,660
茄子
Say, "Cheese."

213
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,690
塑胶人 不要！
Plas, no!

214
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,330
这就是书里那种最老的恶作剧对吧？
That was the oldest trick in the book, wasn't it?

215
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,240
你这家伙的脑子真是慢得可以
You are so gonna get it later.

216
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,740
我爱死他们高空摔落地面成就经典这一幕了
I love it when they fall for the classics.

217
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,570
哦 塑胶人
Oh, Plastic Man!

218
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,710
聪明倒是挺聪明，可惜脑子老是慢半拍
Always clever,but never too quick.

219
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,320
闪电侠
Flash.

220
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,690
哇哦
Wow.

221
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,760
我想说 真的是 哇哦
I mean, really, wow.

222
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,500
蝙蝠侠肯定要气炸了 他最讨厌迟到
Batman is gonna be so mad.He hates tardiness.

223
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,500
哦，追逐戏，我最爱追逐戏码了
Ooh, a chase scene.I love chase scenes.

224
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,840
回旋镖队长
Captain Boomerang.

225
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,110
你知道吗，你是我今天碰到的第二个
You know, you're the second captain wearing blue

226
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,510
穿蓝衣服的队长了
that I've run into today.

227
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,080
你们是组了个俱乐部还是怎么样？
You guys have a club or something?

228
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,480
那是 俱乐部名字叫“干翻闪电侠”
Yeah, it's the"Let's destroy Flash" club.

229
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,620
呃……哦
Uh-oh.

230
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,650
又一发 再来一发
And another, and another.

231
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,060
还有一发
And another.

232
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,730
哈！没打着！
Ha! Missed me!

233
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,760
- 哦 真的吗？ - 是的
- Oh, did I?- Yeah, you did.

234
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,630
哎呀！
Crikey!

235
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,240
这下回旋镖可回旋不动了
Well, that puts the boom in Boomerang.

236
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,010
啊？
Huh?

237
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,840
我错过麻烦事警报了
I missed the trouble alert.

238
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,440
我的错 调成震动了
My bad, had it on vibrate.

239
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,620
蝙蝠侠肯定气疯了
Batman is gonna be so mad.

240
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,780
哎呀！奶昔不错嘛
Blimey! Good shake.

241
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,290
注意了 大都会旅游协会
Attention,Metropolis Board of Tourism,

242
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,330
你们的旅游搞得我好无聊
I'm bored with your tourism.

243
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,560
奇思妙想在哪里？哪里好玩啦？
Where's the whimsy,where's the fun?

244
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,370
哼 我现在就给你们弄点好玩的
Well, I'm gonna give it to ya

245
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,170
看我的好玩加农炮
with my Fun Cannon.

246
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,340
终于，
At last,

247
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,610
我最大的敌人打出了他最后一张牌
my greatest foe plays his final card.

248
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,980
只有我一个人能阻止他
And it's up to me alone to stop him.

249
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,420
这将是我们的终极之战
This could be our end game.

250
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,650
这是最后的战役 在一段很长的……
The last battle in a long...

251
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,720
不好 他的武器充能好快
Impressive, his weapon charged so quickly.

252
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,830
他要按按钮了 没时间了 必须马上出击
He's going for the trigger. No time.Have to strike now, go!

253
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,470
小蝠蝠 在哥谭市里我最想念的人就是你啦
Batsy, how I've missed you in Gotham City.

254
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,900
但你现在总是跟你的朋友们一起行动了
You're always off to play with your superfriends now.

255
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,940
所以我大老远跑到大都会来跟你们一起好好玩玩
So I came all the way to Metropolis to join the fun.

256
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,680
好玩的都玩完了 小丑
Fun's over, Joker.

257
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,610
我已经阻止了你的计划
I foiled your plan.

258
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,610
什么？哦···
What? Oh.

259
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,520
你以为你的蝙蝠镖已经击溃了我的好玩加农炮了吗？
You thought your Batarang defeated my Fun Cannon?

260
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,560
等下 你那个按钮是干啥用的？
Wait, then what's that button for?

261
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,720
这个钮吗？
This button?

262
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,220
这是空调开关
It turns on the air conditioner.

263
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,490
这个按钮才是我的好玩加农炮开炮用的
This button fires my Fun Cannon.

264
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,160
不！
No!

265
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,440
太慢了 小蝠蝠
Too slow, Batsy.

266
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,210
现在这情况看起来可不太妙
This does not look good.

267
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,750
你说得对
You're right.

268
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,490
这个看起来简直要笑死人了
It looks hilarious.

269
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,820
谢谢 谢谢大家 我会在这里表演整整一周的
Thank you, thank you.I'll be here all week.

270
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,620
实际上 我觉得我可以在这呆一辈子
In fact, I think I'll stay here forever!

271
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,970
现在 如果我把这个原子
Now, if I just add this atom

272
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,540
加在这个分子上
on to this molecule,

273
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,740
它应该能让毒气失效
it should make the gas inert.

274
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,570
搞定了！我刚刚发现了解药
Eureka!I've discovered the cure.

275
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,180
现在，合成一个疫苗
Now, to synthesize a vaccine.

276
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,030
我说……
I said...

277
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,640
蝙蝠小丑？
Batclown?

278
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,710
呃 我活已经干完了
Well, my work is done here.

279
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,520
啊？
Huh?

280
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,790
抱歉我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

281
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,460
他打败了小丑 谢谢你！
He took down the Joker! Thank you!

282
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,930
什么？
What?

283
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,600
谢谢 谢谢大家
Thank you, thank you.

284
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,340
你知道 这点活一天就搞定了
You know,it's all in a day's work.

285
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,440
喔哦 你怎么搞成这样？
Whoa! What happened to you?

286
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,010
你迟到的时候就会搞成这样！
This is what happens when you're late!

287
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,610
我知道 非常抱歉
I know, I am so sorry.

288
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,580
因为我把我的联盟警报器调到振动模式了
I had my League alert on vibrate.

289
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,150
然后我这一早上特别忙 又是冰冻队长又是回旋镖队长的
And then a really busy morning with Captain Cold and Captain Boomerang.

290
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,480
但是 嗨 我们抓到小丑了
But, hey,the Joker is captured

291
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,790
然后大家从衣着来看都没什么不好的地方
and everyone seems no worse for wear.

292
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,350
- 啊 大部分吧  - 还有星球日报
- Well, mostly...- And the Daily Planet?

293
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,790
什么？
What?

294
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,560
终极大楼变身准备 三 二  一！
Extreme building makeover in three, two, one!

295
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,100
万岁！闪电侠最棒了！
- Hurray!- Flash is the best.

296
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,010
超级速度啥都能修复 跟新的一样
Super speed fixes everything.Just like new.

297
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,510
你想不想让我把你也修复一下呀 蝙蝠侠？
You want me to fix you up, too, Batman?

298
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,010
不是啥都都能用超级速度来修复的
Not everything can be fixed with speed.

299
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,550
闪电侠 蝙蝠侠想说的是
Flash, what Batman is trying to say,

300
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,280
我们都是你的朋友
is that we're you're friends.

301
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,780
我没想说这个
That's not what I said.

302
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,250
我们想让你成为你能做到的最好的英雄
And we want you to be the best hero you can be.

303
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,320
有时候那意味着放慢速度
Sometimes that means slowing down.

304
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,390
留意一下你的周围
Being aware of your surroundings.

305
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,300
而且永远有一套计划
And always having a plan.

306
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,460
- 闪电侠？ - 慢下来
- Flash?- Slow down.

307
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,500
环境还有计划 记下了
Surroundings and plan, got it.

308
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,270
- 话题标签 #前瞻性行动#…… - 闪电侠？
- Hashtag proactive.- Flash?

309
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,400
更新我的英雄热线 英雄Ins[Ins：美国社交网站、应用]
Updating my Hero Hotline, Herogram.

310
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,470
爱英雄，英雄乌托邦和我的英雄
I-Hero, Herotopia and MyHero

311
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,070
推送一下我打败小丑的消息
with my takedown of the Joker.

312
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,510
哦 太感谢你们了 正义联盟
Oh, thank you, Justice League.

313
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,080
没有你们我们真不知道该怎么办
We don't know what we'd do without you.

314
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,710
- 嗯……- 嗯 市长 只要我是世界上速度最快的人
- Well...- Well, Mayor, as long as I'm the fastest man alive,

315
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,320
那你永远都不用担心
you'll never have to worry about it.

316
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,090
但你才不是世界上速度最快的人
But you aren't the fastest man alive.

317
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,420
你是个骗子
You're a fraud,

318
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,060
就像正义联盟的其它成员一样
just like the rest of the Justice League.

319
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,030
世界很快就会发现这一点
Something the world will see soon enough.

320
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,530
- 那个人是谁啊 - 不知道
- Who was that?- No clue.

321
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,530
我会把他找出来的
But I'm gonna find out.

322
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,770
闪电侠 等等
Flash, wait.

323
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,650
这家伙速度还真快
Huh? This guy is seriously fast.

324
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,150
你穿的是铁靴子吗？
Are you wearing iron boots?

325
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,450
我知道你动作会慢一些，
I knew you would be slow,

326
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,790
但我还真不知道你会慢成这样
but I didn't know you'd be this slow.

327
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,060
你才不可能打败我
No way you're beating me.

328
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,800
这倒挺新鲜
Whoa! That's new.

329
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,310
哇！
Wow!

330
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,610
我在哪儿？
Where am I?

331
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,250
别急 你会再看见的
Don't worry,you'll see it again.

332
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,550
很快
Soon.

333
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,600
似曾相识啊
Deja vu. Bah.

334
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,400
下一次可得记住
You'd think I'd learn by now.

335
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,130
不错
Nice.

336
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,700
哦耶 是时候出发了！
Oh, yeah. It's go time!

337
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,980
- 嘿！你撞我车了！- 什么？根本不能怪我 你看看我的车
- Hey, you hit my car!- What? That ain't my fault, look at my car.

338
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,740
哥们儿 我们昨天就来过一遍了
Guys, we did this yesterday,

339
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,040
你俩开车真该仔细看看路
you really gotta watch where you're going.

340
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,610
谢谢 闪电侠
Thanks, Flash.

341
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,480
不用上学了 不用上学了
- No school.- No way. No school?

342
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,280
连续两天爆胎？
Two blowouts in a row?

343
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,520
听着 这是城市那边我相熟的一家轮胎店
Listen, here's the card for a tire shop I know across town.

344
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,390
如果你提我名字的话他们会以超优惠的价格给你换新轮胎的
They'll give you a great deal on new tires if you mention my name.

345
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,130
拜拜
- See ya.- Uh...

346
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,530
谢谢 闪电侠
Thanks, Flash?

347
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,130
谢谢 闪电侠
Thanks, Flash.

348
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,970
喔啊！
Whoa!

349
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,100
哈 你知道不 跟昨天我们搭的那个比
Ha! You know, I like this one even better than the one

350
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,140
我更喜欢今天搭的这个
we put up yesterday.

351
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,010
谢啦 闪电侠！
Thanks, Flash!

352
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,610
三重似曾相识
Triple deja vu.

353
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,910
饿了
Oh, hungry.

354
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,610
你知道有啥东西能让我的肚子感觉好一点不？
You know what would make my tummy feel better?

355
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,610
再来一轮福克斯家的甜甜圈
Another round of donuts at Fox's

356
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,080
而且这次我不用再操心
and this time I won't have to worry about

357
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,920
冰冻队长耽误我吃饭了
Captain Cold interrupting my chowtime.

358
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,190
是闪电侠 哦！
- It's the Flash.- Ooh!

359
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,690
最好吃的甜甜圈……
Best donut ever...

360
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,320
呃 真的假的？
Ugh. Seriously?

361
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,960
你不可能把这套再搞一遍吧
There's no way this is happening again.

362
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,860
这是“全球冷冻”的祸！
Chalk it up to global freezing!

363
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,260
- 哎 你现在是在重复自己 - 不是 我才没有！
- Well, now you're just repeating yourself.- No, I'm not!

364
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,170
你有 你昨天跟我说的是一模一样的话
Yeah, you said the same thing to me yesterday.

365
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,570
昨天？
Yesterday?

366
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,700
昨天我还在家里计划这次抢劫呢
Yesterday I was at home planning this heist.

367
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,440
看起来你是脑壳被冻坏了
It looks like you might be suffering from some brain freeze.

368
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,480
我……
I...

369
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,710
我甚至都还没回过神儿来
I don't even have a comeback for this,

370
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,650
这也太诡异了
this is just too weird.

371
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,580
好吧 再来一遍 像这样
Okay, one more time,like this.

372
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,050
那个放那儿 你往这边走
Put that there,you go over here.

373
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,920
我就不挡在路中间了
And I step out of the way.

374
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,060
他归你处置了 警官
He's all yours, Officers.

375
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,220
这回 想办法把这家伙关进监狱 行不？
This time, try to keep him in prison, would you?

376
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,860
嗨 闪电侠 你知道用啥搭配这些甜甜圈最好吗？
Hey, Flash, you know what goes good with those donuts?

377
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,460
星城的兰伯特奶昔？
Lampert's Milkshakes in Star City?

378
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,470
哦 你去过了？
Oh, you've been there?

379
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,200
是啊 非常确定
Yeah, pretty sure.

380
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,310
还是同一辆车
That's the same car.

381
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,640
有些真的很奇怪的事正在发生
Something seriously strange is going on.

382
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,240
我必须得赶到大都会去了
I have gotta get to Metropolis.

383
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,220
帮我拿着这个
Hold this for me.

384
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,890
啊？
Huh?

385
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,190
谢啦 闪电侠
Thanks, Flash.

386
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,660
这一天整的
What a day.

387
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,260
好玩的都玩完了 我阻止了你的邪恶计划
Fun's over,I foiled your plan.

388
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,830
什么？
What?

389
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,370
哦 你以为你的蝙蝠镖击溃了我的好玩加农炮吗？
Oh, you thought your Batarang defeated my Fun Cannon?

390
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,540
等下 那个按钮是干啥用的？
Wait, then what's that button for?

391
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,840
这个按钮吗？
This button?

392
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,040
这是空调开关
It turns on the air conditioner.

393
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,980
这个按钮才是我的好玩加农炮的开炮按钮
This button fires my Fun Cannon.

394
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,050
- 什么？- 找这个吗？
- Huh?- Looking for this?

395
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,000
哎呀 看起来好痛
Ow, that looked painful.

396
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,930
你来晚了
You're late.

397
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,740
我还希望你说句“谢啦 闪电侠”呢
I was hoping for a,"Thanks, Flash."

398
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,470
假期结束
Vacation's over.

399
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,240
我连个马戏团都还没看到
And I didn't even get a tan.

400
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,910
哦 天 诸位 我刚度过了人生中最诡异的一天
Oh, man, guys, I have had the weirdest day.

401
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,950
感觉好像我做的一切事情都是昨天的重复
It's like everything I did yesterday is repeating itself.

402
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,980
除了现在 因为我昨天赶到这的时候，
Except right now, because when I got here yesterday,

403
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,690
星球日报大厦已经被“小丑化”了
the Daily Planet had been Joker-fied

404
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,150
而且蝙蝠侠还穿得像个小丑一样
and Batman was dressed like a clown.

405
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,490
非常不可能
Highly unlikely.

406
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,990
闪电侠 你今天的迟到
Flash, your tardiness today

407
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,420
将这座城市和整个联盟都置于危险之中 你得……
endangered this city
and the League. You need to...

408
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,690
放慢速度 留心周围的人和事 准备一套计划
Slow down, be aware of my surroundings and have a plan.

409
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,230
一点儿也……等一下 我有没有……
Exact... Wait a minute.Have I...

410
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,560
说过一样的话？没错，昨天刚说的
Given the speech before?Yes, yesterday.

411
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,640
- 感觉就像…… - 似曾相识？
- Which feels like...- Deja vu?

412
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,240
你 是你干的！
You! You did this!

413
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,470
我不太确定你都干了些啥 但是我知道这肯定都怪你
I'm not sure what you did,but I know it's your fault.

414
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,980
- 那个人是谁啊 - 不知道
- Who was that?- No clue.

415
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,050
- 但是我会把他找出来的 - 闪电侠 等一下
- But I'm gonna find out.- Flash, wait!

416
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,660
还是不够快哦
Still not fast enough.

417
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,590
这回你可跑不了了
You are not getting away this time.

418
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,190
你抓不到我的
You can't catch me.

419
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,870
也许你昨天运气还好些
Maybe you'll have better luck yesterday.

420
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,610
哦 天呐
Oh, man.

421
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,210
我的似曾相识感觉似曾相识啊
My deja vu is having deja vu.

422
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
谢啦，闪电侠
Thanks, Flash!

423
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,390
谢啦，闪电侠
Thanks, Flash.

424
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,460
谢啦，闪电侠
Thanks, Flash.

425
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,700
这一天过的
What a day.

426
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,670
是麻烦事儿警报
It's the trouble alert!

427
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,940
我们来看看今天有谁需要我们帮助
Let's see
who needs our help today.

428
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,270
这里是路易丝·莱恩 为您带来爆炸性新闻
This is Lois Lane with Breaking News.

429
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,010
哥谭市的犯罪王子 小丑
Gotham City's clown prince of crime, the Joker,

430
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,980
正在入侵我们挚爱的城市
was invading our beloved city,

431
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,150
- 但是他突然消失了- 什么？
- but he suddenly vanished.- Huh?

432
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,420
你的麻烦事儿警报总是这么不麻烦的吗？
Is your trouble alert always this not troubling?

433
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,720
各位！
Guys!

434
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,150
听着 我阻止了小丑 但是听着啊
Look, I stopped the Joker,but listen.

435
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,450
我现在有个更大的麻烦
I've got an even bigger problem.

436
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,790
是啊 你的裤子
Great Scott, you're right.Your pants!

437
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,220
- 没了 - 什么？
- They're gone.- Huh?

438
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,790
看起来你是没裤子穿了
Looks like you ran out of pants.

439
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,830
闪电侠是正义联盟的正式成员吗？
So is Flash actually in the League,

440
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,670
还是类似于荣誉成员？
or just, like,an honorary member?

441
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,670
怪不得腿凉
Well, that explains the draft.

442
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,340
听着，我本来特别着急然后……
Listen, I was in a hurry and...

443
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,070
他们永远不会相信你的 闪电侠
They'll never believe you, Flash.

444
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,950
这将是我们俩的小秘密
This will be our little secret.

445
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,910
- 那个人是谁啊？- 回来！
- Who's that?- Get back here!

446
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,550
闪电侠 等等
Flash, wait.

447
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,860
还是不够快
Still not fast enough.

448
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,430
下一次再努力一点
Try harder next time.

449
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,060
受不了了！这次一定得是最后一次
That's it!This is the last time.

450
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,830
闪电侠 等等
Flash, wait.

451
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,770
闪电侠 等等
Flash, wait.

452
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,340
闪电侠 等等
Flash, wait.

453
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,340
蝙蝠侠
Batman.

454
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,140
你是不是最强伙伴呀？
Aren't you the best sidekick ever?

455
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,650
没错你就是
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

456
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,780
我也想要蝙蝠侠给我揉揉肚子
Aw, I want a Bat belly rub.

457
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,780
蝙蝠侠 我只是……别担心
Batman, I just...Don't worry.

458
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,420
我搞定了冷冻队长 回旋镖队长和小丑
I took care of Captain Cold,Captain Boomerang and the Joker.

459
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,060
谢谢你了？
Thank you?

460
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,890
在一切重新开始之前我只剩几分钟了
And I only have a few minutes before it starts all over again.

461
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,690
在什么重新开始之前？
Before what starts all over again?

462
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,300
关于即将发生的所有事件？一个令人焦虑的情绪状态？
Referencing events yet to happen?An agitated emotional state?

463
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,260
时间循环
Time loop.

464
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,800
- 没错 就是它 - 不可能啊
- Yes, that's it.- Impossible.

465
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,570
这不是我们第一次处理和时间有关的问题了
This isn't our first tangle with time.

466
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,540
在超级英雄界发生过好多回了
Happens a lot in the superhero business.

467
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,810
我一直在不停地过同一天 一遍又一遍
I keep living the same day over and over again.

468
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,440
我感觉我简直是走到死胡同里来了
I feel like I've hit a dead end.

469
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,010
一个有趣的事实
Fun fact.

470
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,940
在亚原子层面上，死胡同绝对不是真的死胡同
At the subatomic level, dead ends aren't really dead ends at all.

471
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,510
在分子之间总是存在空隙
There is always space between the molecules

472
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,150
可以容纳原子通过而且……
that allow atoms to move between them and...

473
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
而且你根本不想听这些
And you don't care.

474
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,590
所以 蝙蝠侠 我应该怎么办？
So, Batman, what should I do?

475
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,690
嗯 要打破时间循环在理论上是可能的
Hmm, it's theoretically possible to break out of a time loop.

476
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,430
但是坦白说 我觉得你还不够快
But frankly, I don't think you're fast enough.

477
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,760
不够快？
Not fast enough?

478
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,270
我还以为你知道应该怎么办呢 蝙蝠侠
I thought you would have the answer, Batman.

479
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,270
而我错了
I was wrong.

480
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,000
好强的逆反心理啊 蝙蝠侠
Nice reverse psychology, Batman.

481
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,010
你说的那些正好都是他想听的
That's just what he needed to hear.

482
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,540
现在他是去什么地方了？
Now where's he going?

483
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,950
不是什么地方，而是什么时间
Not where. When.

484
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,620
看来你还是抓不到我
You still can't seem to catch me.

485
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,200
为什么它飞不起来呢？
Why won't it fly, Dad?

486
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,970
有风才行
There needs to be a wind.

487
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,570
- 哇！- 儿子！
- Whoa!
- Son!

488
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,140
这太棒啦！
This is amazing!

489
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,180
只需要再快一点点，闪电侠
Just a little faster, Flash.

490
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,650
不要今天不要再来一遍不要……
Not today or again or...

491
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,050
不管怎么样了！
Whatever!

492
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,500
一切都完全按照计划
Everything is going perfectly to plan.

493
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,170
哇啊
Whoa.

494
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,470
嗯 好歹这次没又回到床上去
Well, at least I'm not in bed again.

495
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,140
但是我现在在哪啊？
But where am I?

496
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,270
我们讨厌你 闪电侠
We hate you, Flash.

497
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,580
你这人糟透了 烂透了
You're horrible. You're awful.

498
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,550
真是个大写的失望
What a phenomenal disappointment.

499
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,120
这是什么情况？
What was that about?

500
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,590
人人都爱闪电侠呀
Everyone loves the Flash.

501
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,390
至少以前都爱
At least they used to.

502
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,960
好吧 这太疯狂了 我得回联盟去
Okay, this is crazy, I need to get back to the League.

503
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,760
奇怪了
That's weird.

504
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,630
再试一次
Let's try that again.

505
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,830
我的速度
My powers.

506
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,070
没了
They're gone.

507
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,110
我得回正义大厅去
I've gotta get to the Hall!

508
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,270
我的天
Oh, man.

509
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,980
我总算明白为啥大家都不爱跑步了
I can see
why people hate to run.

510
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,120
说不定钢骨能帮我……
Maybe Cyborg can fix my...

511
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,050
呃 嗨 诸位，干嘛脸色这么难看啊？
Uh, hey, guys,why the mean faces?

512
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,620
你给我的披风上了浆
You starched my cape.

513
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:08,060
你把我的洗发水换成了灭火剂！
You switched my shampoo with fire extinguishing cream!

514
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,100
你乱画我的隐形飞机
You painted my invisible jet.

515
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,200
现在它……
Now it's just...

516
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,100
它显形了！
Just visible!

517
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,470
你把我的一只胳膊换成了打蛋器
You replaced my arm with an egg beater.

518
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,200
虽然这打蛋器很好用啦 但是！
Sure the eggs are amazing,but still.

519
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,800
而且你觉得那样挺好玩的
And you decided it would be fun

520
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,570
就把我的多功能腰带上的小袋子全弄混了
to mix up the pouches on my utility belt.

521
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,710
什么？
What?

522
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,280
不不不 那些都不是我干的
No, no, I didn't do any of those things,

523
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,880
你们不明白
you don't understand.

524
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,210
之前有一个模模糊糊的家伙 然后我们开始赛跑然后……
There was this blurry guy and we started running and...

525
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,920
我们不想听 闪电侠
We don't wanna hear it, Flash.

526
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,320
你至少在正义联盟搞了52次恶作剧了
You've pulled at least 52 pranks on the Justice League

527
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,690
自从我加入的这五天以来
in the five days since I've joined.

528
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,790
五天？
Five days?

529
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,420
你不是今天早上才加入的吗？
You just joined this morning.

530
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,130
我在这呆不下去了
I'm outta here.

531
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,490
原子侠是对的
Atom's right.

532
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,860
闪电侠 你的恶作剧应该受到惩罚
Flash, your pranks require punishment.

533
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,560
你被开除了
You're fired.

534
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,560
没有超能力 没有联盟
No power, no League.

535
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,790
我现在该怎么办？
What do I do now?

536
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,730
我希望你继续碌碌无为下去
Fade into obscurity I hope.

537
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,230
嘿 那是我的服装
Hey, that's my costume.

538
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,270
是吗？我倒还没注意
Is it? I hadn't noticed.

539
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,030
是你！
You!

540
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,900
那些恶作剧 时间循环
The pranks, the time loop.

541
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,140
都是你干的好事
It was all you.

542
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,070
你招惹错人了
You messed
with the wrong hero,

543
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,540
又黄又模糊的家伙
yellow blur guy.

544
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,950
时间循环的事你可不能怪在我头上 巴里
Uh-uh-uh. Don't blame me for the time loop, Barry.

545
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,550
你自己才是那个非要证明自己是世界上速度最快的人的那个傻瓜
You were the fool that had to prove you were the fastest man alive.

546
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,950
但是你不知道什么是神速力吧 对不？
But you didn't know about the Speed Force, did you?

547
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,260
这种力量可以穿越所有的时间和空间
A force that runs through all of space and time.

548
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,230
每次你追我追到神速力赛道的时候
Every time you chased me into the Speedway,

549
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,230
我就一次又一次地把你带回同一天重复地过
I led you backwards in time to relive the same day over and over.

550
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,100
趁你困在你的时间循环里的时候
And while you were stuck in your time loop,

551
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,770
我让所有人都与你为敌
I turned everyone against you,

552
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,670
然后我骗你切断了自己的神速力
and then tricked you into severing your Speed Force power.

553
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,940
但是为什么？我哪里得罪你了？
But why? What did I ever do to you?

554
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,150
你哪里得罪……？
What did you...

555
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,350
你哪样没得罪我？
What didn't you do?

556
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,080
闪电侠 未来的史书上说
The Flash, according to future history books,

557
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,850
你是整个世界最爱的超级英雄
the world's favorite hero.

558
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,990
又幽默 又完美
So funny, so perfect.

559
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,090
速度还那么快！
So fast!

560
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,990
但是我更快
But I'm faster.

561
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,960
可惜 我一直生活在你的阴影下的话 没人会认识到我的伟大
Yet, nobody will recognize my greatness while I live in your shadow.

562
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,660
这就是为什么我
That is why I,

563
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,370
逆闪电
the Reverse-Flash,

564
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,870
要穿越回到过去毁了你
have traveled back in time to ruin you.

565
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,270
所以 你来自未来
So, you're from the future

566
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,440
你还管自己叫逆闪电？
and you call yourself Reverse-Flash?

567
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,940
呃 真的吗？我是说……
Ugh. Really? I mean...

568
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,080
- 你是倒着跑还是怎么样？- 不是
- Do you run backwards or something?- No.

569
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,210
- 那你是超级慢吗？- 才不是
- Are you super slow?- No.

570
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,920
我只是一切都跟你相反
I'm just the reverse of you.

571
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,550
你是好人我是坏人
You're good and I'm bad.

572
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,750
那你为什么不叫邪恶闪电？
Then wouldn't you be called Evil Flash

573
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,920
或者坏闪电？
or Bad Flash?

574
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,660
我就是逆闪 好吗？
I'm just Reverse-Flash, okay?

575
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,660
随你啦
Okay.

576
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,230
够了
That's enough of that.

577
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,930
拜托了 巴里 你知道是什么回事
Please, Barry.You know how it is.

578
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,200
我 快
Me, fast,

579
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,470
你 慢
you, slow.

580
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,270
现在你已经被我击败了
Now that you've been beaten,

581
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,870
是时候让世界都知道
it's time for the world to know

582
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,740
谁才是一直以来最伟大的极速者
who is truly the greatest speedster of all time.

583
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,750
我在正义联盟的朋友会阻止你的
My friends in the Justice League will stop you.

584
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,210
你的朋友？
Your friends?

585
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,780
是指那些刚把你踢出门外的人吗？
You mean the people that just kicked you out of their club?

586
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,590
我跟你说吧 巴里
Well, I'll tell you what, Barry.

587
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,320
既然你这么在乎他们
Since you care for them so much

588
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,990
那我下一步就去”照顾“他们
I'm going to take care of them next.

589
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,840
看起来闪电侠说的都是真话
Looks like Flash was telling the truth.

590
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,340
这个逆闪电角色把他困在时间循环里
This Reverse-Flash character kept him in a time loop

591
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,280
趁机毁了他的名声
while he ruined his reputation.

592
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,220
这个混蛋
That rotten rascal.

593
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,920
- 我把手铐打破了- 别担心 闪电侠
- I broke 'em.- Don't worry, Flash.

594
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,620
等我变大以后，我们就一起把一切都告诉正义联盟
Once I enlarge, we'll inform the Justice League together

595
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,020
然后阻止这个速度很快的家伙 嗯？
and stop this
fast-paced villain. Hmm?

596
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,590
呃 这可坏了
Oh, this isn't good. This isn't good at all.

597
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,670
我的缩身腰带肯定是刚才手铐放电的时候烧短路了
My white dwarf shrinking belt must've shorted out when those shackles stunned Flash,

598
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,330
连通讯系统也烧坏了
along with my communication systems.

599
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,040
闪电侠！你能听见我说话吗？
Flash! Can you hear me?

600
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,770
- 闪电侠！闪电侠 这里啊 闪电侠 - 这下好了
- Flash! Flash, over here, Flash.- Great.

601
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,910
我现在该怎么办？超能力没了
What do I do now?I'm powerless.

602
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,810
我的朋友们 要是还能称作朋友的话 已经把我踢出联盟了
My friends, if you can call them that, kicked me out of the League.

603
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,950
唉 这种事怎么会发生在我身上啊
Oh, this can't be happening to me.

604
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,310
你觉得你那算事儿？
You think you have problems?

605
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,180
我太小了 人家看不到也听不到我
I'm too small to be seen or heard.

606
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,790
至少你还能拿起电话找人聊聊……
At least you can pick up the phone and talk to some...

607
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,920
等等
Wait a second.

608
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,160
我不能帮闪电侠找回超能力
I can't give Flash his powers back.

609
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,990
但是我知道有人也许做得到
But I know someone who might.

610
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,370
挡在我和帮助闪电侠中间的唯一障碍
And the only thing that stands between me and helping the Flash...

611
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,330
不过就是水果沙拉嘛
Is fruit salad.

612
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,570
这能有多难呢？
How hard can this be?

613
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,450
好的！
Yes!

614
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,890
哈！
Ha!

615
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,230
嗯？哦
Huh? Oh.

616
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,770
真是怪了 一般我不小心用屁股拨了号的话
That's weird,usually when I butt-dial,

617
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,240
我的屁股通常在手机附近啊
my butt is actually near the phone.

618
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,350
欢迎来到命运博士的魔力帮助热线
Welcome to Doctor Fate's magic helpline.

619
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,020
你觉得整个世界都与你为敌吗？
Do you feel like the world's turned against you?

620
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,790
是啊是啊 我觉得
Yes, yes, I do.

621
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,390
你觉得自己的脚步失去了活力吗？
Do you feel like you've lost that pep in your step?

622
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,990
哦 哇哦 是啊 我失去了所有的活力呢
Oh, wow. Yeah,I've lost all my pep.

623
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,160
你觉得有人想要取代你生活中的位置吗？
Do you feel like someone is trying to take your place in life?

624
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:48,200
也许是把你踢出一个俱乐部或联盟？
Maybe kick you out of a club?Or League?

625
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,770
我不认识这家伙 但是他确实有两下子啊
I don't know who this guy is,but he is good.

626
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,910
嗯 如果上面那些情况有任何一条发生在你身上
Well, if any of that applies to you,

627
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:57,510
结结实实帮自己一把吧 请按1 就现在
do yourself a solid and press one, now.

628
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,780
嗯 巴里 希望这个能有帮助吧
Well, Barry,let's hope this helps.

629
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,050
什么？
Huh?

630
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,190
等等 等等 等等！
Wait, wait, wait!

631
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,420
我要跟你一起去
I'm going with you.

632
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,060
看来我不得不采取艰难方法了
It looks like I'm going to have to do this the hard way.

633
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,960
我必须得赶到大都会去
I'll just have to get to Metropolis

634
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,760
通知正义联盟到底发生了什么事
and tell the Justice League everything that's happened.

635
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,560
应该也没有多难嘛
It shouldn't be that hard.

636
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,870
我只要从闪电侠的门缝底下溜出去 跳上一辆公交车 然后……
I'll just slip under Flash's front door, hop on a bus and...

637
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,740
哦 不是吧
Oh, no.

638
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,580
现在闪电侠走了
Now that the Flash is gone,

639
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,050
我们得另外找人来做会议纪录
we'll need someone else to take the minutes.

640
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,650
哦 我 我 我！
Oh! Me! Me! Me!

641
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,590
- 钢骨 - 耶
- Cyborg?- Yes.

642
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,390
看起来麻烦事在整个地图上不断出现啊
It looks like trouble is springing up all over the map.

643
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,400
好吧 队友们 我们分头行事 搞定它们
All right, team, split up and let's take care of business.

644
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,030
钢骨 把刚才那些念一遍给我听
Cyborg, read that back to me.

645
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,900
好吧 队员们 我们分头行事 搞定它们
"All right, team, split up and let's take care of business.

646
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,670
钢骨 把刚才那些念一遍给我听
"Cyborg, read that back to me."

647
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,800
很好 我们行动吧
Good job, let's move.

648
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,340
“做-的-好”
"Good job.

649
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,810
我们-行-动-吧
"Let's M-O-V-E."

650
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,150
人类已经在蔬菜沙拉自助餐台旁边狼吞虎咽太久了
Too long have humans gorged themselves at the salad bar.

651
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,350
现在是时候让蔬菜植物们在人类自助餐台旁边饱餐一顿了
Now it's time for the plants to gorge at the human bar.

652
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,120
住手
Stop.

653
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,560
我是市长 我命令你住手
I'm the Mayor,I command you to stop.

654
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,730
不好意思啦 毒藤女
Sorry, Poison Ivy.

655
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,000
我听到有人在尖叫
I heard someone screaming.

656
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,840
你懂的嘛 “我尖叫，你尖叫”
And you know,"I scream, you scream,

657
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,640
“大家一起把冰淇淋叫”
"we all scream for ice cream."

658
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,580
拿下他
Get him.

659
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,250
哦 天呐
Oh, man.

660
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,990
蔬菜植物应该是用来看的 不是用来听的
- Plants should be seen, not heard.

661
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,520
“市长的温布利花园”
"Wimbley for Mayor"?

662
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,790
一个市长花车 哦！
A mayoral float! Oh!

663
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,830
- 谢谢你啊，这位……- 我的名字是逆闪电
- Thank you, Mr...- Reverse-Flash is my name

664
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,630
帮助他人是我的工作
and helping people out is my game.

665
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,570
现在 我必须要走了
Now, I must be away.

666
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,370
还有很多其他需要我帮助的市民们在等着我
There are other citizens that need my help.

667
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,280
信号手表 信号手表
Signal watch. Signal watch.

668
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,040
快来啊 超人
Come on, Superman.

669
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,610
这回可要给奥尔森你好好上一课 不准找坏角度拍我丑照
This will teach Olsen not to take a photo of my bad side.

670
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,050
我很抱歉 鳄鱼先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Croc.

671
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,150
只不过 拍你的话哪一面都是坏角度啊
It's just, with you every side is a bad side.

672
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,420
杀手鳄！
Killer Croc!

673
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,220
放开超人的朋友 吉米·奥尔森
Unhand Superman's pal,Jimmy Olsen.

674
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,490
绝不！
Never!

675
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,900
我能搞定 塑胶
I've got this, Plas.

676
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,970
我也能切开木头 超人 快看
I can cut logs, too, Supes,check it out.

677
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,920
塑胶！
Plas!

678
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,650
啊 哦
Uh-oh.

679
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,760
你是怎么做到的？
How did you do that?

680
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,460
对逆闪来说只是小孩子的把戏罢了
Child's play for Reverse-Flash.

681
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,800
这么说 你应该没有信号手表吧 对吗？
Say, I don't suppose you have a signal watch, do you?

682
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,770
丧钟！
Deathstroke!

683
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,970
他正在偷我们船上装黄金的货柜！
He's stealing our shipment of gold!

684
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,400
黄金是你在未来的一项非常好的投资
Gold is a great investment in your future.

685
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,380
但是你唯一的未来将在监狱里过了
But the only future you've got is behind bars.

686
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,300
只用一天就能搞定的 只有我……
All in a day's work for...

687
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,600
逆闪电
Reverse-Flash.

786
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,070
来自于神速力

787
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,770
但是你们之间的联系断掉了

That's... That's the place I saw when I
was running after the Reverse-Flash.

802

它叫神速力赛道

神速之地的门户

无法回到我的正常大小
Unable to grow to my normal size,

807
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,410
我周遭的世界已经变得比你能想象到的要危险得多
the world around me has become more dangerous than you can possibly imagine.

808
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,950
每一辆车，都是一场山崩地裂的大灾难
Every car, a cataclysm.

809
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,050
每一只老鼠 都是一头狂野巨兽

810
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,850
每一米路程 都是一场马拉松

811
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,830
所有实验都始于一个问题，那么我的问题来了
Experiments always start with a question.Here's mine.

812
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,800
我要怎么才能活着回去啊？
How am I going to survive?

813
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,010
这是今天发回来的画面
That was the scene today,

814
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,910

as the Reverse-Flash continues his unprecedented streak of heroism.

815
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:40,210
看起来逆闪电是独一无二的超级英雄
It would seem that the Reverse-Flash is the only superhero

816
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,850
这个世界有他就足够了
the world will ever need.

817
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,120
看看那个麻烦事儿警报地图
Just look at that trouble alert map.

818
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,650

And he's just passed me in friends on Herobook.

824
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,740
嗯  像这样的事根本不重要 也算好事一桩
Well, it's a good thing things like this aren't important at all

825
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,810
对我这样的钢铁之躯来说
to the Man of Steel.

826
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,550
看起来逆闪似乎
It seems that the Reverse-Flash

827
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:17,820
已经同意与市长坐下来进行一场对话
has agreed to sit down for a chat with the Mayor.

828
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,380
不要转台 我们即将现场直播
Stay tuned for live coverage

829
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:22,420
我们心爱的超级英雄极速者
of our beloved heroic speedster.

830
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,990
我觉得现在是时候跟这位谈谈了
I think it's about time we had a word with this

831
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,990
这位心爱的极速者
beloved speedster.

832
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,600
我要拿回我的超能力了 我要拿回我的超能力了！
Whoo-hoo! I'm gonna get my powers back!I'm gonna get my powers back!

833
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:38,870
但是首先 我得来点零食垫垫肚子
But, uh, first,I might need a snack.

834
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,570
谢谢
Thank you.

835
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,910
你不是应该在开车吗？
Shouldn't you be driving?

836
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,580
别担心
Don't worry.

837
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,180
博士刚刚给我魔法师的免手动驾驶许可
The Doc just gave me my magician's permit for hands-free driving.

838
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,280
- 扎塔娜 - 起不对
- Zatanna. - Yrros.

839
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,220
现在你听好了 当你到达神速之地的时候
Now listen, when you arrive at the Speed Force Zone,

840
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,150
你将会经受一系列的考验
you'll go through a series of tests

841
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,290
来证明你有这个资格
to make sure you're worthy.

842
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,530
有啥资格？
Worthy of what?

843
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,330
那就是你要弄明白的事
That's what you need to find out.

844
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,300
那就是秘密
That's the mystery.

845
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,130
那就是魔力
That's the magic.

846
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:11,240
是 好吧 但是你会留在那帮我的 对吧？
Yeah. Yeah. But you'll be there to help me, right?

847
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,540
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

848
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,340
神速之地只允许
The Speed Force Zone is only accessible

849
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,340
拥有神速力的人接近
to those with speed powers.

850
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:21,050
或者是你这种情况 拥有过神速力的人
Or in your case,former speed powers.

851
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,980
嗯 就是这样了
Well, this is it.

852
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,050
- 有什么临别赠言吗？ - 有哒
- Any parting words?- Yeah.

853
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,720
亡羊补牢 宝贝儿
Tuck and roll, baby.

854
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,290
亡羊补牢？
Tuck and roll?

855
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,160
- 那是什么意……？- 起不对啦
- What is that...- Yrros.

856
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,830
啊
Oh.

857
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,100
哇啊
Whoa.

858
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
哇哦，你看到没
Wow. Would you look at that?

859
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,210
它是某种神速之地的神庙之类的玩意儿
It's some sort of Speed Force Zone temple thingy.

860
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:51,710
而且感觉那个神庙正在散发出某种能量
And it almost feels like the temple is giving off some sort of energy.

861
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,810
神速力！
The Speed Force!

862
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,310
如果那就是神速力所在之处
If that's where the Speed Force is,

863
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,590
那就是我要去的地方了，要快
that's where I need to be,and fast.

864
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,560
好吧，这些肯定就是命运博士说的那些考验了
All right. These must be the tests Doctor Fate was talking about.

865
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,400
砖头移动速度超级快，还能振动穿过坚硬的固体
Bricks moving superfast, vibrating through solid matter.

866
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,230
而我需要做的只是成功跑到那一头去
And I just have to make it to the other side.

867
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,840
嗯 这应该不是很难的
Well, this shouldn't be too hard.

868
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,140
那些砖块冲击力好强啊
Those speed bricks really pack a wallop,

869
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,710
但是如果你起初没有成功……
but if at first you don't succeed...

870
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,460
好吧 这招不好使
Okay.
This is not working.

871
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,630
肯定有个窍门的
There has to be a trick.

872
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,070
我们希望你能成为你可以成为的最好的超级英雄……
We want you to be the best hero you can be.

873
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:51,840
有时候那意味要放慢速度
Sometimes that means slowing down.

874
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:57,010
嗯 慢下来
Mmm. Slow down.

875
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,640
欧耶 谢啦 超人
Yeah, thanks, Supe.

876
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,280
嗯 快跑行不通 而且命运博士说我会被考验
Well, going fast didn't work,and Fate said I'd be tested.

877
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,720
这怎么起效的？
How is this working?

878
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:18,200
我真的 真的 真的讨厌慢慢走
I really, really, really hate going slow.

879
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,630
天呐
Holy moly.

880
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:24,030
还真管用了！我做到了！
It actually worked!I did it!

881
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,340
小菜一碟嘛
Piece of cake.

882
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,740
日志输入编号14
Journal entry 14.

883
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,650
情况变得粘乎乎毫无进展
The situation has grown sticky.

884
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,880
但我必须保留我身上的智慧
But I must keep my wits about me.

885
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,090
我必须要动用身边的一切可用之物来保命
I must use everything at my disposal to survive.

886
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,820
我必须用到，科学！
I must use science!

887
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,860
关于蛛形纲的一个小小的广为人知的假说
A little known hypothesis about arachnids

888
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,230
就是他们会被闪烁的光源催眠
is that they can be hypnotized by flashing lights.

889
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,230
是时候验证一下这个理论了
Time to test that theory.

890
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,100
科学会赢吗？
Can science prevail?

891
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,940
还是蜘蛛会取胜呢？
Will the spider be hypnotized?

892
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,280
难道我将在蜘蛛体内学习它的消化过程吗？
Will I learn about spider digestion from the inside?

893
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,040
有了！
Eureka!

894
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,950
啊哈！
Aha!

895
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:13,080
研究表明部分鸟类会被驯化
Studies have shown tha some birds can be tamed

896
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,860
通过在后背上的某处特殊神经施加一点点压力
by applying gentle pressure to a special nerve on the back.

897
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,930
这只家鸽证明了那些研究的正确性
This Columba livia domestica proves those studies correct.

898
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,660
那么现在就去正义大厅吧
And now to the Hall of Justice.

899
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,800
希望我来得及通知正义联盟
Hopefully, I'm in time to alert the League

900
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,600
赶在逆闪造成更多破坏之前
before Reverse-Flash can do any more damage.

901
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,250
哦 我懂了
Oh, I get it.

902
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,880
我手机上有这个小游戏
I have this game on my phone.

903
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,150
我只要想办法跳上这些板块一直跳到顶就可以了
All I have to do is ride these to the top.

904
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,950
哇啊 好痛
Ow! Whoa. That hurt.

905
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,520
说不定这个是某种耐力考验
Maybe this is some sort of endurance test.

906
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:55,060
我必须要表现出我能扛得住
I just have to show I can take it.

907
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,930
我扛不住啊啊啊！
I can't take it!

908
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:22,490
留意你的周围
Be aware of your surroundings.

909
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,930
我的周围？
My surroundings?

910
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,700
我之前从没注意过那些平台
I never noticed those platforms before.

911
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:40,900
哇哦 通向大门的路一直就在那里啊
Wow, the path to the door was there the whole time.

912
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:46,610
哈！小菜一碟 柠檬……
Ha! Easy-peasy, lemon...

913
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:49,050
还是好痛 还是好痛
Still hurts. Still hurts.

914
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,220
感谢你加入我们 逆闪电
Thank you for joining us,Reverse-Flash.

915
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:00,720
这是我的荣幸 市长
It's my pleasure, Mayor.

916
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,960
能为社群服务 我十分荣幸
I serve with the pleasure of the community.

917
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,930
你不会在什么私人小岛上的俱乐部别墅里看到我，不会的
You won't see me in some private island clubhouse, no.

918
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:11,100
我就爱当人民公仆啊
I love being the servant of the people.

919
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,840
你真令人敬佩
You're incredible.

920
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,440
你不仅阻止了毒藤女和她那些发狂的植物
Not only did you stop Poison Ivy and her maniacal plants, you...

921
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,540
我们为什么要在这鬼鬼崇崇的？
Why are we sneaking around?

922
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,880
你要懂得这就是蝙蝠侠做事的风格
You know this is how Batman does things.

923
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,680
我们正在暗中监视逆闪
We're spying on Reverse-Flash,

924
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,780
因为蝙蝠侠觉得自己最终会给他使个绊子
because Batman thinks he'll eventually trip up

925
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,420
把他真实的邪恶目的暴露人前
and reveal his true evil intentions.

926
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,720
正确 钢骨
Correct, Cyborg.

927
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,260
这是一次秘密侦查
This is a covert op.

928
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,820
我们将会从暗影处窥探 在暗影中行动
We'll spy from the shadows,move in the shadows,

929
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,030
成为……
be the...

930
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,060
火风暴 把你脑袋灯关了
Firestorm,turn down your head.

931
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,660
哦 抱歉
Oh. Sorry.

932
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,670
我的谦逊质朴不允许我取得任何的褒奖 市长小姐
Modesty forbids me from taking such praise, Miss Mayor.

933
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,500
说起哥谭市
And speaking of Gotham City,

934
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:49,070
你知道蝙蝠侠和罗宾被巨石砸中叫什么吗？
为啥，不知道啊
- do you know what you call Batman and Robin under a rock?- Why, no.

935
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,880
扁平男和罗带宾
Flatman and Ribbon.

936
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:56,350
哦哦 还有个段子 请问钢骨什么时候换裤子？
Oh! Here's another. When does Cyborg change his pants?

937
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,980
永远不换 他根本没穿裤子
Never. He's not wearing any.

938
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,820
嘘……
Shh.

939
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,190
我肯定每一位在家看电视的观众都会同意
As I'm sure everyone at home would agree,

940
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:09,190
你已经让大都会和整个世界都变得更加安全
you have made Metropolis and the world a safer place.

941
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,200
你作为一个超级英雄 既不要求荣誉授勋
You're a hero that never asks for accolades

942
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,570
也不会穿那种很浮夸的披风之类的东西
or wears something as gaudy as a cape.

943
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,130
浮夸？浮夸？
- Gaudy?
- Gaudy?

944
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,570
因为这些
And for that,

945
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,900
我们想要授予你一项荣誉
we'd like to honor you

946
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,870
城市之匙
with the key to the city.

947
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,810
感谢大家 大都会善良的居民们
Thank you,
fine citizens of Metropolis.

948
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:29,310
我接受你们一文不值的……我是说珍贵的 礼物
I accept your paltry...I mean, precious gift.

949
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,180
很快这个世界就将意识到 其实你们已经明白了
Soon the world will realize what you have already learned.

950
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,890
我 逆闪电
That I, Reverse-Flash,

951
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:39,760
是你们唯一需要的超级英雄
am the only hero you will ever need.

952
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,630
不要啊 塑胶人
No, Plastic Man.

953
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:43,730
你在支撑横梁上放太多重量了
You're putting too much weight on the support beam.

954
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,670
你得……
You need to...

955
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,940
这就是为什么蝙蝠侠单独行动
This is why the Batman works alone.

956
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,240
哦 看呐！
Oh, look!

957
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,140
是正义联盟
It's the Justice League.

958
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,440
或者我应该叫你们失业者联盟？
Or should I say the Jobless League.

959
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,650
悲催的是 我同意
Sadly, I agree.

960
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,850
这只能说明一件事
- Huh?- This can only mean one thing.

961
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:11,690
正义联盟现在宣布退休
The Justice League is now retired.

962
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,640
迷宫？我最喜欢迷宫了
A maze?Well, I love mazes!

963
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,610
它们可棒了
They're amazing.

964
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:37,020
我快到了 我能感觉到我的力量正回来呢
I'm almost there. I can feel my powers coming back.

965
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,720
嗨 几乎回复到全速了
Hey, look at that.
Almost back to full speed.

966
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,660
耶！哦 不是吧
Yeah! Oh, no. Huh?

967
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,510
所以我要做的就是在一片漆黑中穿过这个迷宫吗？
So all I have to do is get through the maze in the dark.

968
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,680
有我的超能力 那应该不是什么问题
With my super speed back,that shouldn't be a problem.

969
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,680
好吧 那确实是个问题
Okay. It's a problem!

970
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:16,090
这个地方有什么东西一直想伤害我呢？
What is it with this place trying to hurt me?

971
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:17,990
蝙蝠侠说什么来着？
What was it Batman said?

972
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,720
总是准备一套计划 总是准备一套计划
- Always have a plan.- Always have a plan.

973
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:22,100
好的 那么 闪电 你的计划是什么？
Okay, so, Flash,what's your plan?

974
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,400
哦！我可以从高处这里提前做好计划
Oh! I can make a plan from up here.

975
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,330
好了 现在我们看看
Okay. Now let's see.

976
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,170
左 右 右 右 等下 不 不不不不
Left, right, right, right.Wait, no, no, no, no.

977
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,570
左 右 右 右 左
Okay. Left, right, right,
right, left...

978
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,040
左 右 左
Okay. Left, right, left,

979
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,310
左 右 左 右 左 左
left, right, left, right,left, left,

980
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:43,350
右 右 左 左 左 完美
right, right, left, left.Perfect.

981
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:44,850
好了 我搞定了 我搞定了
Okay, I got it. I got it.

982
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,960
最后一道门了
The final door.

983
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:59,360
啊 拜托 我怎么才能通过这扇坚固的大门？
Aw, come on! How can I get through this solid door?

984
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:00,730
这是个死胡同嘛！
It's a dead end!

985
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:02,430
有趣的事实
Fun fact.

986
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,730
在亚原子层面上
At the subatomic level,

987
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,000
死胡同绝对不是真的死胡同
dead ends aren't really dead ends at all.

988
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,270
分子之间总会存在空隙
There is always space between the molecules

989
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,880
允许原子子从中间通过
that allow atoms to move between them.

990
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:13,950
如果原子侠是对的
If the Atom is right,

991
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,280
一切事物之间都有空隙的话
and there is space between everything,

992
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,820
我需要做的就是像神速砖那样，
I just have to do what the speed bricks did

993
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,920
把自己振动成分子状态从事物的空隙中穿过去
and vibrate my molecules to fit between them.

994
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,230
嗯 来吧 一切就靠这个了
Well, here goes everything.

995
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:36,300
我刚刚振动通过那堵墙了
I just vibrated through that wall.

996
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,110
我无所不能啊！
I can do anything!

997
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,070
就是这里了
That's it.

998
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:44,110
我能感觉到它在激发出神速力
I can feel it radiating the Speed Force.

999
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,480
哇哦！
Wow!

1000
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,990
它是某种核心
It's some kind of nexus.

1001
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:00,890
太惊人了！
It's amazing!

1002
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:03,390
我终于做到了！
I've finally done it!

1003
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,160
没有什么能阻止我……
Nothing can stop...

1004
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,530
终于！
At last!

1005
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,070
逆闪？
Reverse-Flash?

1006
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,740
- 但是怎么会这样？ - 还是慢半拍，对不？
- But how?- Still too slow, aren't you?

1007
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,210
时间循环
The time loop.

1008
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,110
你打破了你与神速力之间的连接
You breaking your connection to the Speed Force,

1009
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:21,380
我早知道它会引导你来到这里
I knew it would all lead you here,

1010
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,110
来到神速力之核
to the Speed Force nexus.

1011
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,120
而且 通过那个荒谬的障碍机关
And also, through that ridiculous obstacle course...

1012
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,250
我说 你是不是在逗我？
I mean, are you kidding me?

1013
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,590
多危险啊！
Dangerous!

1014
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:33,760
所以我忽悠你为我打开这三道门
So I duped you into opening
the three doors for me.

1015
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,490
恭喜你啦 失败者！
Congratulations, loser!

1016
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,730
现在嘛
And now,

1017
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,830
取得了神速力之核的力量
with the power of the nexus,

1018
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,100
再没有什么东西能阻挡我了
nothing can stand in my way.

1019
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,110
这力量
The power!

1020
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:54,750
感觉 感觉像是连喝了52杯奶昔
It's... It's like drinking 52 milkshakes

1021
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,510
又吃下整整一大袋果冻软糖！
and eating a bag of jelly beans!

1022
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,380
精神百倍！
Invigorating!

1023
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:03,320
神速力之核是我的！我努力赢来的！
The nexus is mine!I earned it!

1024
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,090
祝你们好运吧，你们将被永远困在这里
Good luck being trapped here for all eternity.

1025
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,240
我真没法相信我们要退休了
I can't believe that we're retiring.

1026
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,270
我是说 我们将何去何从啊？
I mean,where do we go from here?

1027
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,580
英雄们 钢骨 永远不要放弃希望
Heroes, Cyborg,never give up hope.

1028
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:29,480
而我 还没有放弃调查逆闪
And I haven't given up investigating Reverse-Flash.

1029
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,620
哦 巨星陨落啊
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

1030
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,850
一度辉煌的正义联盟
The once great Justice League

1031
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,820
被迫退休
forced into retirement.

1032
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:40,120
面对现实吧 超级狗熊们
Face it, super zeroes,

1033
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,730
你们已经是昨日黄花了
you're yesterday's news!

1034
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:46,260
快节奏的今日世界需要一个青出于蓝的英雄人物
Today's fast-paced world needs a hero like yours truly.

1035
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,500
还得谢谢你们的老朋友 闪电侠
And thanks to your old pal, Flash,

1036
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,000
未来的史册上将只会记得我
future history books will know only me

1037
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:55,240
是地球上最伟大的冠军战士
as Earth's greatest champion.

1038
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,310
瞧着吧
Watch.

1039
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,780
快看外面！
Look, outside!

1040
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,860
他在干什么？
What is he doing?

1041
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,530
他在用墙来困住我们
He's walling us in.

1042
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:18,060
他肯定对我的超级力量一无所知
He must not be aware of my super strength.

1043
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,300
对我的嬗变能力也一无所知
Or my ability to transform matter.

1044
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,910
我来得太晚了！
I'm too late!

1045
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,680
那是什么材料筑成的啊？
What kind of material is that?

1046
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,420
肯定不是寻常的种类
Not the normal kind.

1047
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,850
我的扫描仪显示这些砖块正在以令人难以置信的速度在移动
My scanners indicate these bricks are moving at an incredible speed.

1048
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,120
它们放射出的动力学能量
The kinetic energy they're putting off

1049
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,560
足以抵消我们所有的超能力
is enough to counteract any of our powers.

1050
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,130
你说得太对了，钢骨
Right you are, Cybore.

1051
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:52,230
这些是来自神速力之地的神速砖
Those are speed bricks from the Speed Force Zone.

1052
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,230
只有我一个人觉得那像是瞎编的吗？
Does that sound made-up to anyone else?

1053
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,230
享受你们余下的几天吧
Enjoy the rest of your days

1054
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:58,900
困在你们小小的俱乐部别墅里
trapped inside your little clubhouse.

1055
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,640
哦 还有件事
Oh, one more thing.

1056
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,440
我已经启动了你们正义大厅的安全系统
I've activated your Hall of Justice security systems

1057
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,240
并且装备了反攻装置
and equipped them with countermeasures

1058
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,580
专门针对你们的超能力
for each of your powers.

1059
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,580
所以你们在里面可要小心一点哟
So you might wanna be careful in there.

1060
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:14,590
毁灭 毁灭
Destroy. Destroy.{\r

1061
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:16,750
不是吧
Not my cybots!

1062
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,950
你这个禽兽
You monster.

1063
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,520
我们怎么办？
What do we do?

1064
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,090
对抗我设计的最强大的安保系统？
Against the most powerful security system I've ever devised?

1065
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,990
我们跑
We run.

1066
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,700
我怎么会这么蠢啊
How could I have bee so stupid?

1067
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,570
每一步我都没逃出逆闪的掌心
At every step, I've played into the Reverse-Flash's hand.

1068
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:34,900
他抢走了我的超能力
He took away my powers.

1069
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:37,040
他抢走了我的朋友
He took away my friends.

1070
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,510
哦 我只想回家
Oh, I just wanna go home.

1071
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,290
它在振动 就好像……
It's vibrating, like...

1072
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:51,920
就好像神速力在它们里面一样
Like they have the Speed Force inside of them.

1073
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:53,490
我有个计划了
I have a plan.

1074
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,800
不错
Not bad.

1075
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,530
相当不错
Not bad at all.

1076
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,900
现在来看下这些神速砖有多厉害
Now let's see what these speed bricks can do.

1077
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,470
喔啊！
Whoa!

1078
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:22,490
我所有的努力
All my hard work,

1079
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,990
所有的尝试和磨难
all the trials and tribulations,

1080
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,460
一无所得
for nothing.

1081
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,130
超级宠物！哈！
The Super-Pets! Huh.

1082
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:36,130
逆闪搞出这么大乱子
All this trouble with Reverse-Flash

1083
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:39,100
他们居然只是在挖坑！
and they're just digging a hole!

1084
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:40,770
在墙根底下挖
Under the wall.

1085
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:42,770
当然了！太机智了！
Of course! Brilliant!

1086
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,480
嗨 哥们儿 等等我！
Hey, guys, wait for me!

1087
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,020
钢骨的实验室
Cyborg's laboratory.

1088
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,280
好样的 兄弟们
Great job, gang.

1089
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:56,220
现在我可以用钢骨的工具把我的缩身腰带修好
Now I can use Cyborg's tools to repair my shrinking belt

1090
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,290
然后变回正常大小
and return to normal size.

1091
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:01,460
嗨
Hey.

1092
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,230
我已经搜集到足够的信息了
Well, I've collected enough data.

1093
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,100
你们俩到底也不是太差劲嘛
You guys aren't so bad after all.

1094
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,360
警报！警报！
Alert! Alert!

1095
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,300
你们必须被清除
You must be eliminated.

1096
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,610
太神奇了
Fascinating.

1097
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,010
绿灯侠也有一个宠物
Green Lantern has a pet,

1098
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:20,340
而且还是个晃着圆尾巴的松鼠？
and he's a ring-wielding squirrel?

1099
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:22,710
嗨 你喊谁宠物呢？
Hey! Who you calling pet,short stack?

1100
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:23,980
你会说话啊？
You can talk?

1101
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,450
废话 因为我才不是什么松鼠
Yeah, because I ain't no squirrel.

1102
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,690
我叫大B
Name's B'dg.

1103
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:29,250
我是从另一个星球来的
I'm from another planet

1104
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:32,960
我们星球上的人好死不死恰好长得有点像你们的松鼠
of people that happen to loosely resemble your squirrels.

1105
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,890
我明白了 嗯 好有道理
I see. Well, that makes perfect sense.

1106
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,330
能获得您的认可我真是开心
Oh, I'm so glad you approve.

1107
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,560
我的好兄弟大A从这里发出了一个警报
My buddy Ace here sent down an alert.

1108
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,570
我来猜猜哈，
Let me guess,

1109
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:43,670
正义联盟有危险了？
the Justice League is in trouble?

1110
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,030
旺旺
Bark.

1111
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,340
惯例如此啊
As per usual.

1112
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:50,070
嗯 我们去救他们吧 再一次
Well, let's go rescue them, again.

1113
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,540
有没有谁能解释一下
Can someone explain

1114
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,240
逆闪是怎么控制我的钢骨机器人的？
how Reverse-Flash can turn my cybots against us?

1115
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,710
他的超级速度不知怎么的被增强了
Somehow his speed power's been supercharged.

1116
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,120
是时候撤退然后想出个计划来了
Time to fall back and form a plan.

1117
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,220
已经被逼到悬崖边上了 我真希望闪电侠在这里
By the toenails of Tartarus,I wish that Flash was here.

1118
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,160
嗨 各位 在这边！
Hey, guys, over here!

1119
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,260
清除 清除
Eliminate. Eliminate.

1120
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,060
多谢及时出手相救啊 伙计们
Thanks forthe quick save, gang.

1121
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,400
我不可能在这顶一辈子
I can't hold them off forever.

1122
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,130
我们得想办法找路离开这里
We need to find a way out of here.

1123
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,970
离开这个天堂吗？
And leave this paradise?

1124
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,370
谁会知道海王的卧室
Who knew Aquaman's bedroom

1125
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,870
简直就是星球最佳日间水疗浴场呢
was like the best day spa in the planet?

1126
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:23,910
噢，哈！
Ooh, ha!

1127
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,380
当然了，海之王就是应该有张水床
Of course, the king of the sea has a waterbed.

1128
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,340
- 塑胶！- 各位？
- Plas!- Guys?

1129
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,720
挺住啊 超人 超级宠物们有个计划
Hang in there, Superman.The Super-Pets have a plan.

1130
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,020
人家不是宠物
Not a pet.

1131
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:39,620
我相信他们在呼唤什么人
I believe they're calling someone.

1132
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:41,090
你现在都会说狗语了？
You speak dog now?

1133
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:44,260
不会啊，我只是理解我的朋友们
No, I just understand my friends.

1134
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:50,200
一只海马？
A seahorse?

1135
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,370
又来一只超级宠物？
Yet another Super-Pet?

1136
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,340
再说一次 人家不是宠物
Again, not a pet.

1137
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,640
这是暴风
This is Storm.

1138
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,510
他从前与海王并肩战斗
He's fought alongside Aquaman before,

1139
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,140
所以他总是愿意伸出援手
so he's always ready to lend a hand.

1140
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:02,310
或者是援鳍 哈？
Or a fin. Huh?

1141
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,210
诸位？
Guys?

1142
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,450
超人 保持超级
Superman, stay super.

1143
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,550
暴风 我们需要你带我们下海
Storm, we'll need you to lead us out to sea

1144
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,790
穿过你来时经过的海底隧道
through the ocean tunnel you came from.

1145
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:12,860
但首先 我们需要个交通工具
But first,we'll need a vehicle.

1146
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:14,760
潜水艇怎么样？
How about a sub?

1147
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,090
搞懂笑点没？一个潜水艇三明治 哈哈哈
Get it?A submarine sandwich.

1148
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,170
抱歉……那个可以用
- Sorry...- That'll work.

1149
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,570
又来了
Aw! Not again.

1150
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,510
一个超级大小的潜水艇准备行动
One supersized sub ready for action.

1151
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:36,410
诸位！我们走吧，超人！
- Guys!- Let's go, Superman.

1152
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,780
是啊 你在那里挡啥呢？
Yeah, what's the hold-up?

1153
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:41,650
清除 清除
Eliminate. Eliminate.

1154
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,290
清除……哦，多可爱的小房间呐
Eliminate...Oh, my, what a lovely room.

1155
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,190
暴风 去蝙蝠洞
Storm, to the Batcave.

1156
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,670
“星球日报”
The Daily Planet,

1157
01:04:55,670 --> 01:05:00,270
很快就要被更名为逆闪星球了
soon to be renamed the Reverse-Flash Planet.

1158
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:02,040
还有这个完美的天线
And the perfect antenna

1159
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,680
可以把我的个人宣言广播到世界的每一个角落
to broadcast my manifesto across the world!

1160
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:08,480
你们好啊 地球！
Hello, planet Earth!

1161
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,020
是我 一直以来最受喜爱的超级英雄
It's me, the most beloved superhero of all time,

1162
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,590
逆闪电
Reverse-Flash.

1163
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:15,720
哦！
Ooh!

1164
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,990
逆闪电呀 我超爱他的
The Reverse-Flash.I love him.

1165
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:21,560
现在 我已经打破了充满罪恶的旧世界
Now that I've rid the world of crime,

1166
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,430
我觉得是你们回报一下老逆闪的时候了
I think it's time for you to repay old R.F.

1167
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:27,530
因为他仁慈的慷慨
for his kind generosity.

1168
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:31,300
所以我命令每一个人都要到
That's why I'm ordering everyone to report

1169
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,640
我的逆闪电指挥中心来向我汇报
to my Reverse-Flash command centers.

1170
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:38,040
在那里 你们会接到指示 由我 你们的新主宰者
There, you'll be given orders on what I, your new ruler,

1171
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,210
告诉你们我想让你们做什么 听起来是不是很棒？
would like you to do.Doesn't that sound wonderful?

1172
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:44,980
没教养的猴崽子 我早就知道他不安好心
Cheeky monkey, I always knew he was rotten.

1173
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,520
现在赶紧的！
Now hurry!

1174
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,120
你们不想让我像对付正义联盟一样
You don't want what I did to the Justice League

1175
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,260
对付你们吧
to happen to you.

1176
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:56,930
他的能力提升了以后 我们中的任何人都不是他的对手了
With his increased powers, none of us are any match for him.

1177
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,170
哦！我到处找你们大家 现在听我说
Ah! I've been looking everywhere for you guys. Now listen,

1178
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:05,640
我知道你们多半还在为那些恶作剧生我的气
I know you're probably still mad at me for those pranks,

1179
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,770
但是问题是 它不是我干的
but the thing is,it wasn't me.

1180
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:09,640
它是这个骗人 邪恶 下流的
It was this cheating,evil, dirty,

1181
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,180
长着一张蠢脸的冒名顶替的家伙干的 他从未来穿越回来的 名字叫……
doofus-faced imposter from the future named...

1182
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,280
逆闪电
Reverse-Flash.

1183
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,780
等下 你们知道他在冒充我？
Wait. You knew he was impersonating me?

1184
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:20,150
不 我们不知道 一开始不知道
No, we didn't.Not at first.

1185
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,920
但是有三条线索
But there were three clues.

1186
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,090
你神秘兮兮的时间循环麻烦
Your mysterious time loop trouble.

1187
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:26,690
你对孩子式幼稚的恶作剧突如其来的兴趣
Your sudden interest in childish pranks.

1188
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:30,460
对我们说起的恶作剧矢口否认，又丧失了超能力
A sudden denial of said pranks and loss of powers.

1189
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,630
你不同寻常的行为举止让我相信通过某种方法
Your unusual behavior patterns led me to believe that somehow,

1190
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,770
某种途径 某个人 某个地方
some way, someone,somewhere,

1191
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:38,540
为了某个不可告人的目的陷害你
was framing you for some unknown purpose.

1192
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:42,310
所以 你炒我鱿鱼是为了引出逆闪？
So, you fired me to flush out the Reverse-Flash?

1193
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:44,270
一点也不错 蝙蝠侠早就知道
Exactly.Batman knew that

1194
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,010
一旦他达到了他的邪恶目的
once he accomplished his evil goals

1195
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:47,510
他就会自己暴露大家面前
he'd reveal himself to you.

1196
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,880
所以当他自曝身份的时候我就在那里
That's why I was gonna be there when he did.

1197
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,580
我缩小以后落在你的肩膀上
I shrunk down onto your shoulder

1198
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,280
本打算回来向联盟报告
and was going to report back to the League

1199
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:56,050
但是反闪的手铐害我电路短路了
until Reverse-Flash's shackle shorted out my circuits,

1200
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:58,720
所以我一直困在缩小模式里
which kept me stuck in shrink mode.

1201
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,530
那就是说你们从来没有真正的放弃我
Then that means you guys never really gave up on me.

1202
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,030
当然没有啦
Of course not.

1203
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:04,630
我们是超级伙伴嘛 伙计
We're superfriends, man.

1204
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,660
骗了你真是非常对不起 闪电侠
We were sorry to deceive you, Flash.

1205
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,100
我们只有这一个办法帮你摆脱麻烦
It was our only play to get you out of trouble.

1206
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,430
谢谢你们 这里的每一个人
Thank you, everyone.

1207
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,270
是啊 真是暖心一刻啊
Yeah, yeah,real heartwarming.

1208
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:15,940
现在 轮到我帮大家摆脱麻烦了
And now, it's my turn to get us all out of trouble.

1209
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,470
我们可以用这些来阻止逆闪
We can stop the Reverse-Flash with these.

1210
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,940
神速砖
Speed Force bricks.

1211
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,680
而且我们可以用我神速车上的这些砖
And we can use the bricks from my speed machine

1212
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,380
来给我们其它的交通工具充满能量
to superpower our other vehicles.

1213
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,680
给我们所有人足够快的速度来追上逆闪
Giving us all enough speed to keep up with Reverse-Flash.

1214
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:29,350
嗯 我还没拿回我的超能力呢 神奇女侠
Well, I don't have my speed powers back yet, Wonder Woman,

1215
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,420
但是我有个更好的东西
but I have something better.

1216
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,030
我有一个计划
I have a plan.

1217
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,760
告诉他们所有人 你们今天建造的地标
Tell them all, the landmarks you build today

1218
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,760
将会使我的英名万古长青
will glorify my name tomorrow and for all eternity.

1219
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,470
看呐 是正义联盟
Look, it's the Justice League!

1220
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:47,070
历史将铭记 世界上速度最快的人永远都是……
History will know the fastest man alive was always...

1221
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,580
万岁!
Hurray!

1222
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:02,320
嗨 你们大家！我们不打算退休了！
Hey, everybody!We're not retired anymore!

1223
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,890
正义联盟回归
The Justice League is back.

1224
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:06,960
黑暗骑士归来
- And the Dark Knight returns. - Bark.

1225
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,090
这么说你们从正义大厅里逃出来了
So you've escaped the Hall of Justice

1226
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:13,430
你们的宠物们帮的忙 毫无疑问
with help from your pets,no doubt.

1227
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:16,130
我希望你们能享受此刻的自由
I hope you enjoyed your freedom,

1228
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,600
因为它将是你们临终前看到的最后一件事了
because it will be the last thing you ever see.

1229
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,670
神速砖能量开启
Powering on the speed bricks.

1230
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,710
哦哦 痒痒的！
Tickles!

1231
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,250
哇啊！看那边！
Whoa! Look at that!

1232
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,750
看起来好像一切都静止了
It looks like everything just stopped.

1233
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,860
怪不得闪电侠总是动作那么快
No wonder the Flash is always moving so fast.

1234
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:41,830
生活在这么一个慢吞吞的世界里肯定很无聊
It must be boring to live in a world going so slow.

1235
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:43,830
如果我们早知道他的世界是这样的
If we'd known it was like this,

1236
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:45,760
那我们真该对他再耐心点
we might have been more patient with him.

1237
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,260
学到了宝贵的一课 队员们 打起精神来
Lesson learned, team.Look alive.

1238
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:52,500
你用什么办法获得了神速力？
Somehow you've gained the power of the Speed Force.

1239
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:55,940
不要紧 我还是比你们所有人都要快
No matter. I'm still faster than all of you.

1240
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:58,440
调虎离山 散开！
Evasive maneuvers.Split up.

1241
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:04,410
你们仍然不是神速力之核的对手
You're still no match for the nexus.

1242
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,620
我动作可以快到可以
I can move so fast I can seem to be

1243
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,450
同时出现在五个地方
in five different places at the same time.

1244
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:11,090
而且我可以搞定你们所有人 一劳永逸！
And I can take care of all of you, once and for all!

1245
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:19,070
- 准备好了吗 大B？- 当然
- Ready, B'dg?- You bet.

1246
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,540
我的神速砖正在返回神速力之地
My bricks are returning to the Speed Force Zone!

1247
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:29,510
不！
No!

1248
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:30,970
看起来闪电侠是对的
Looks like the Flash was right.

1249
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,840
神速砖给了我们的飞行器
The speed bricks have given our vehicles

1250
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:35,250
摧毁这些雕像的能力
the ability to destroy those statues.

1251
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,620
拿下它 伙计们！
Go get 'em, gang!

1252
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:49,560
目标锁定 开火！
- Target locked.- Fire!

1253
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,200
炸没喽！
It's away!

1254
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:12,820
不！
No!

1255
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:15,080
我不知道你那些神速砖是怎么得来的
I don't know how you got those speed bricks

1256
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,590
但是你的计划失败了
but your plan failed.

1257
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:18,120
我的力量强大到
I'm powerful enough

1258
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,390
不管你们在哪 都能击败正义联盟
to beat the Justice League,no matter where you are!

1259
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:21,990
我们可没打算跟你打
We weren't trying to beat you.

1260
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:24,060
我们只是想分散你的注意力
We were trying to distract you.

1261
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,200
什么？
What?

1262
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,010
这不可能 你是怎么……
Impossible. How did you...

1263
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,620
在神速力之地的那些考验
The trials in the Speed Force Zone

1264
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,280
不只是为了看看我是不是够资格
weren't just there to see if I was worthy,

1265
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:49,450
那些考验是为了教导我一些东西
they were there to teach me something.

1266
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:52,420
一些如果你花点时间自己去通关就会搞明白的事
Something you would have known if you took the time to go through them.

1267
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:53,790
说够了吧！
Enough of this!

1268
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:55,890
我身上还有足够的神速之核的能量
I still have enough of the nexus energy

1269
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:58,090
可以打败像你这样的人
to defeat the likes of you.

1270
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,280
好强的力量！
So much power!

1271
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,180
这些力量本该是我的才对！
Which is rightfully mine!

1272
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:21,550
我出现在你面前之前 你根本都不知道神速力是什么
You didn't even know what the Speed Force was until I showed up.

1273
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:24,960
你凭什么以为你现在知道得足够多可以打败我？
What makes you think you know enough about it now to defeat me?

1274
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,460
只有一个办法能找出答案了
Only one way to find out.

1275
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:30,930
你永远打不赢我的 闪电侠
You'll never beat me, Flash.

1276
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:35,100
我才是掌握了神速力的大师
I'm the master of the Speed Force!

1277
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,370
真的吗？一个大师级人物应该有个计划的吧？
Really? Wouldn't a master have a plan

1278
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:39,130
所以他没被绊倒啊？
so he doesn't get tripped up?

1279
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,870
我猜是没有
Guess not.

1280
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,580
你看起来很累嘛 也许你应该放慢速度
You're looking tired. Maybe you should slow down.

1281
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,510
- 不！- 好啊
- No!- Okay.

1282
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,150
什么？
What?

1283
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,190
很疼 对吧？
- Hurts, doesn't it?- Huh?

1284
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:59,660
留意周围 神速力大师
Way to be aware of your surroundings, Speed Force master.

1285
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:02,390
也许你今天会赢
You may have won today,

1286
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:03,960
但是我可以回到过去
but I'll travel back in time

1287
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,130
阻止你拿到神速力之核
and stop you from getting the nexus.

1288
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:09,230
我觉得你已经没有足够的力量了 逆闪
I don't think you have enough steam, R.F.

1289
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:11,970
看起来你最后的神速力核之力也用完了
It looks like the last of the nexus energy is gone.

1290
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:15,040
没有它 你根本就不够快
Without it,you're just not fast enough.

1291
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,410
不够快？我是世界上速度最快的人！
Fast enough?I'm the fastest man alive!

1292
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:19,740
就是我！
I am!

1293
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,010
证明给我看
Prove it.

1294
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,020
快点啊 逆闪
- Come on, R.F.- Huh?

1295
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,520
你可以跑得更快的
You can go faster than that.

1296
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,130
真的吗？你就这点本事了？
Really? That's all you've got?

1297
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,600
什么？
What?

1298
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,610
手铐不可能锁得住我
Handcuffs can't hold me.

1299
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:52,740
我只要……
All I have to do is...

1300
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,680
怎么回事？
Huh? What?

1301
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,280
我的超能力
My powers.

1302
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,080
啧啧啧 看起来有人和神速力之间的连接断掉了
Uh-uh-uh. Looks like someone broke his connection to the Speed Force.

1303
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:02,390
啧啧
Tsk, tsk.

1304
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:04,350
你应该放慢速度
You should have slowed down.

1305
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,690
你 你骗我！
You! You tricked me!

1306
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:10,460
我只是执行我的计划而已
No, no.I just executed my plan.

1307
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:12,160
你跑不了的！
You won't get away with this!

1308
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,600
我会回来的！
I'll come back!

1309
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,670
不好意思 你讲话这么慢我听不懂你在说什么
Sorry. I... I can't understand when you're talking so slow.

1310
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,010
妈妈
Mummy.

1311
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:33,550
嗯 我们不会有什么麻烦事儿了
Well, we won't have any trouble

1312
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:35,050
逆闪出事以后能消停好一阵子
from Reverse-Flash for a while.

1313
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:37,750
- 那个神速之核怎么办？- 什么怎么办？
- What about the nexus thingy?- What about it?

1314
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,120
拥有那样的力量
With power like that,

1315
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:42,330
你可以把从此以后所有的超级英雄的活都干了
you could do the job of every hero forever.

1316
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:45,130
看起来正义联盟还是在退休状态啊
Looks like the Justice League is still retired.

1317
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,660
不
No.

1318
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,530
没人应该拥有这样的力量
No one should have this much power.

1319
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:04,180
你……
You...

1320
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,280
你放弃了那样的力量
You gave up all that speed.

1321
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,950
为什么呢？
But why?

1322
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:10,150
嗯 最后我发现放慢速度
Well, it turns out that slowing down

1323
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:12,250
才是打败逆闪的最佳途径
was the best way to defeat Reverse-Flash.

1324
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,830
神速力之核的力量让他不能集中精神
The nexus power had him so distracted,

1325
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:17,230
他完全忽视了自己周围的一切
he was totally unaware of his surroundings.

1326
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,260
我绝对不能让那样的事发生在我身上
No way would I ever let that happen to me.

1327
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:22,770
归还神速之核的力量一直就是我计划的……一部分
Returning the nexus was always a part of my... plan,

1328
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:26,840
而且这些也是你们大家一直想要教导我的事
and these were all the things you guys were trying to teach me.

1329
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,270
谢谢大家
Thank you.

1330
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:31,970
要不是有你们这样的朋友，我将会永远失去我的超能力
Without friends like you, I would have lost my powers forever.

1331
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,380
而我们也得被迫永久退休了
And we would have been retired forever.

1332
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:35,580
这倒提醒我了
That reminds me,

1333
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,650
我们正义联盟有没有什么养老金计划或者……
is there a Justice League pension plan or...

1334
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:39,850
你回来真是太好了 闪电侠
It's good to have you back, Flash.

1335
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,150
还有了你新得到的智慧的引导
And with newfound wisdom to guide you.

1336
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:44,450
也许是这样 神奇女侠
That may be true,Wonder Woman,

1337
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:45,920
但闪电侠才刚刚证明了
but Flash has only proven

1338
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:48,090
他已经为下一阶段的特训做好准备了
he's ready for the next level of training.

1339
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,890
现在开始真正的考验的是
Now begins the true test

1340
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:52,860
闪电侠精神上的敏锐和不屈不挠
of Flash's mental acuity and fortitude.

1341
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,960
我准备的考验异常残酷
The training crucible I have prepared

1342
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,770
将摧毁他隐藏在内心的软弱
will destroy hidden weakness

1343
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:59,570
锻炼出内心所需要的强大的力量来……
and forge the inner strength required to...

1344
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:01,170
唔 听起来很棒 蝙蝠侠
Hmm. It sounds great, Batman.

1345
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:02,870
我们开始吧
Let's get started on that.

1346
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,370
吃完小点心再开始
Right after a little snack.

1347
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:08,910
神速力之核已经被送回了神速力之地
The nexus has been returned to the Speed Force.

1348
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:12,450
宇宙已经重获秩序
And order has been restored to the universe.

1349
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:14,150
所有这些只用了……
And all it took was...

1350
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:17,150
魔力呀 宝贝 只是一点小小的魔力
♪ Magic, baby It's just a little magic ♪

1351
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:19,490
- 扎塔娜 - 起不对……
- Zatanna.- Yrros.
