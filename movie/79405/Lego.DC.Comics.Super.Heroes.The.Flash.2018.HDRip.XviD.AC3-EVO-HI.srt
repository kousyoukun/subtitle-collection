Yes, yesterday.

- Deja vu?

This is Lois Lane

Gotham City's clown prince

<i>Your mysterious

some way, someone,
somewhere,

Then that means you guys
never really gave up on me.

1435
01:07:01,532 --> 01:07:03,030
Of course not.

1436
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:04,633
We're superfriends, man.

1437
01:07:04,635 --> 01:07:06,668
We were sorry
to deceive you, Flash.

1438
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,104
It was our only play
to get you out of trouble.

1439
01:07:09,106 --> 01:07:11,438
Thank you, everyone.

1440
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,275
Yeah, yeah,
real heartwarming.

1441
01:07:13,277 --> 01:07:15,945
And now, it's my turn
to get us all out of trouble.

1442
01:07:15,947 --> 01:07:18,479
We can stop the Reverse-Flash
with these.

1443
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:19,949
Speed Force bricks.

1444
01:07:19,951 --> 01:07:21,682
And we can use the bricks
from my speed machine

1445
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:23,385
to superpower
our other vehicles.

1446
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:26,688
Giving us all enough speed
to keep up with Reverse-Flash.

1447
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:29,358
Well, I don't have my speed
powers back yet, Wonder Woman,

1448
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,425
but I have something better.

1449
01:07:31,427 --> 01:07:33,030
I have a plan.

1450
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:37,766
<i>Tell them all, the landmarks
you build today</i>

1451
01:07:37,768 --> 01:07:41,769
<i>will glorify my name tomorrow
and for all eternity.</i>

1452
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:43,472
Look, it's the Justice League!

1453
01:07:43,474 --> 01:07:47,075
History will know the fastest
man alive was always...

1454
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:48,313
Huh?

1455
01:07:58,222 --> 01:07:59,588
ALL: Hurray!

1456
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:02,324
Hey, everybody!
We're not retired anymore!

1457
01:08:02,326 --> 01:08:03,892
The Justice League is back.

1458
01:08:03,894 --> 01:08:06,961
- And the Dark Knight returns.
- Bark.

1459
01:08:06,963 --> 01:08:10,099
REVERSE-FLASH: So you've
escaped the Hall of Justice

1460
01:08:10,101 --> 01:08:13,434
with help from your pets,
no doubt.

1461
01:08:13,436 --> 01:08:16,137
I hope you enjoyed
your freedom,

1462
01:08:16,139 --> 01:08:19,607
because it will be
the last thing you ever see.

1463
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:21,677
Powering on the speed bricks.

Whoa! Look at that!

1467
01:08:33,256 --> 01:08:35,757
It looks like
everything just stopped.

1468
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,860
No wonder the Flash
is always moving so fast.

1469
01:08:38,862 --> 01:08:41,830
It must be boring to live
in a world going so slow.

1470
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:43,831
If we'd known
it was like this,

1471
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:45,767
we might have been
more patient with him.

1472
01:08:45,769 --> 01:08:48,269
Lesson learned, team.
Look alive.

1473
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:52,508
(GRUNTS) Somehow you've gained
the power of the Speed Force.

1474
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:55,943
No matter. I'm still
faster than all of you.

1475
01:08:55,945 --> 01:08:58,448
Evasive maneuvers.
Split up.

1476
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:04,419
You're still no match
for the nexus.

1477
01:09:04,421 --> 01:09:06,620
I can move so fast
I can seem to be

1478
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:08,456
in five different places
at the same time.

1479
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:11,095
And I can take care of all
of you, once and for all!

1480
01:09:16,867 --> 01:09:19,070
- Ready, B'dg?

01:09:29,512 --> 01:09:30,978
Looks like
the Flash was right.

1484
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,848
The speed bricks
have given our vehicles

1485
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:35,250
the ability
to destroy those statues.

1486
01:09:35,252 --> 01:09:36,621

I don't know
how you got those speed bricks

01:10:15,091 --> 01:10:16,590
but your plan failed.

1492
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:18,125
I'm powerful enough

1493
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:20,394
to beat the Justice League,
no matter where you are!

1494

We weren't trying to beat you.

The trials
in the Speed Force Zone

weren't just there

they were there
to teach me something.

Something you would have known if you
took the time to go through them.

Enough of this!

I still have enough
of the nexus energy

You didn't even know what the Speed

What makes you think you know
enough about it now to defeat me?

Only one way to find out.

I'm the master

Really? Wouldn't a master
have a plan

You may have won today,

and stop you
from getting the nexus.

01:14:49,899 --> 01:14:52,867
of Flash's mental acuity
and fortitude.
