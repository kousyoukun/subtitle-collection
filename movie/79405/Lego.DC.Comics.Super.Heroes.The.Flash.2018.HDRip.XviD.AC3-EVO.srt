2
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:44,390
Booyah!

3
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,295
<i>Half man, half machine.</i>

4
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:48,660
All awesome.

5
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:50,497
I'm like a ninja
meets an acrobat.

6
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:51,730
I'm a ninjabat!

7
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:53,299
Maybe I'm in the bat family.

8
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:55,067
Dreams do come true.

9
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:56,302
I am so...

10
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,411
Amazing.

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,682
Huh?

12
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:23,296
Couldn't let me have it,
could you?

13
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:26,564
And your tour of the Hall
of Justice concludes here.

14
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:27,999
In our specially designed

15
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,270
state-of-the-art
training facility.

16
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:32,071
Atom, meet Cyborg.

17
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:33,740
Cyber mechanical specialist

18
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:36,609
and the League's
little ray of sunshine.

19
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:38,410
Hey, Atom.

20
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,847
Ah, <i>Canis lupus familiaris.</i>

21
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:44,449
It's a common hypothesis
that dog is man's best friend.

22
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,090
But, uh... Not mine.

23
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,490
Whoa, cool! Oh...

24
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:55,061
"The Atom."
I see what you did there

25
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:57,996
<i>with your name and you shrinking
down all tiny and stuff.</i>

26
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:59,365
Relax, Atom.

27
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:01,332
This is Ace, the Bat-Hound.

28
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:03,936
He's just evaluating you.

29
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:06,704
Well, in my
scientific evaluation,

30
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:08,975
Ace is very intimidating.

31
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:09,942
Tell me about it.

32
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:14,280
Lesson one with animals.

33
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:16,582
Never show weakness.

34
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:19,518
Man, I think I need
an oil change.

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,255
Batman, I didn't know
you had a...

36
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:23,822
Uh... Super-Pet.

37
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:26,792
Ace the Bat-Hound
is more than a pet.

38
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:27,959
He's the best sidekick

39
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,196
a caped crusader
could ever have.

40
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:32,163
What about Robin?

41
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:35,635
Aren't you the best sidekick? Yes, you are, yes you are.

42
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:38,203
Aw, I want a Bat belly rub.

43
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,772
So, Atom.

44
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:42,608
Now that you've seen
the Hall of Justice...

45
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,344
What do you think?

46
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:46,678
Would you like to become a
member of the Justice League?

47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,149
I...

48
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:50,548
Hold your diminutive answer.

49
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,887
Follow me.

50
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:55,554
Come on, Plas,
it's the trouble alert.

51
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:57,923
But I'm starving.
I need a pick-me-up.

52
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:00,059
How's this for a pick-me-up?

53
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:03,996
One order of fast food to give you a boost.

54
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:06,098
Huh? What? Hey!

55
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,205
Way to be
a team motivator, Firestorm.

56
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,243
Let's see
who needs our help today.

57
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:19,645
<i>This is Lois Lane
with</i> Breaking News.

58
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:21,280
Gotham City's
clown prince of crime,

59
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:23,984
the Joker, has invaded our beloved city.

60
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:26,786
Ah.

61
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:28,620
Sunny Metropolis.

62
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:32,257
The perfect getaway
from Gotham's Dark Knight.

63
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,327
Nothing like a little vacation

64
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:37,029
to put the pep
back in my step.

65
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:54,613
<i>Oh, my!</i>

66
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,815
<i>The Joker's gassing the city.</i>

67
00:03:56,817 --> 00:04:00,720
<i>Who can
stop this ruinous jester?</i>

68
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:04,223
<i>Help us!
Justice League, Superman.</i>

69
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,423
<i>Save us!</i>

70
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:11,130
Great Scott!
Lois is in trouble.

71
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:12,231
Again.

72
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:15,534
All right, team,
gear up and let's go.

73
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:17,002
Atom, this is your chance

74
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,904
to join
the Justice League in action.

75
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,973
- Are you ready?
- I, uh...

76
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,106
No pressure.

77
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:23,575
We know you're new
at being a superhero.

78
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:24,877
If you want, you can stay here

79
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,312
and hang out
with Ace and Krypto.

80
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:27,581
Krypto?

81
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:31,050
Another Super-Pet?

82
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:33,752
Yeah, I'll take
the clown over the canine.

83
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:36,057
The sooner, the better.

84
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:46,298
Ooh, the <i>Daily Planet</i>
news building.

85
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,700
<i>Hmm, the visitors'
guide calls it</i>

86
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:51,772
"The jewel
of the Metropolis skyline."

87
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,673
Meh. Kinda boring.

88
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:56,675
Let's renovate!

89
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,615
<i>The nerve of that clown.</i>

90
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:07,519
He's tromping all over the jewel
of the Metropolis skyline.

91
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:09,187
And he's jaywalking.

92
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,889
Let's take him down.

93
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:16,962
The welcoming committee.
For me?

94
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:18,897
Good thing I brought pastry.

95
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,637
Ooh, is that coconut cream?

96
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,072
Lemon meringue.

97
00:05:27,074 --> 00:05:28,343
<i>With a bang.</i>

98
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:33,314
Brace for impact!

99
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,853
What a beautiful, perfectly
safe day at the park.

100
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:50,029
- I should've taken my jet.
- Ooh. Ooh.

101
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:51,764
I'm holding it together.

102
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,668
I'm holding it together.

103
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:56,635
Oh, this is embarrassing.

104
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:02,108
It's not that funny.
A little consideration here.

105
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,142
Lois, Cyborg.

106
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:06,277
Try to stay calm!

107
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,683
I can still hear you.

108
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:15,154
Is this normally how it goes?

109
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:17,923
Yeah, but usually with
a little less laughter.

110
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:19,625
That laughter is dangerous.

111
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:20,925
We've gotta
help these people

112
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,526
before they laugh
themselves to death.

113
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:25,630
And stop the Joker before
he endangers anyone else.

114
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:27,132
Then let's divide and conquer.

115
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:30,036
Yup, we'll have this mess
cleaned up in a flash.

116
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,171
Speaking of,
where is the Flash?

117
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:34,507
I sent out the Justice alert
minutes ago.

118
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:35,908
Priority one.

119
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,247
Barry knows
how I feel about tardiness.

120
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:48,654
Come on, Barry. Get up.

121
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,423
And one...

122
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:54,726
And 2,000.

123
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:55,894
Okay, I'm up.

124
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,462
Shower time.

125
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,870
Whoa, I have got to remember to wait for
the water to warm up before jumping in.

126
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:06,973
Nice.

127
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:10,345
All right, Central City,
let's get this party started.

128
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:14,012
Hey, hey, hey, you hit my car!

129
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:16,615
- Who's gonna take care of this?
- Me? You hit me.

130
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:19,420
I'm gonna sue you
for every brick you've got.

131
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:22,421
Thanks, Flash!

132
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:23,956
That guy's Flash.

133
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,392
Hidey ho, birdies.

134
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:28,961
<i>Ooh, watch your step.
Good morning, Troop 52.</i>

135
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:30,730
<i>Hello, hot dog.</i>

136
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:33,899
- No school.
- No way. No school?

137
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:35,968
Whoa! Thanks, Flash!

138
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,870
Thanks, Flash.

139
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:39,372
- <i>Thanks, Flash!</i>
- <i>Thanks, Flash!</i>

140
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,440
- <i>Thanks, Flash!</i>
- <i>Thanks, Flash!</i>

141
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:46,911
Whoa!

142
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:48,846
Thanks, Flash!

143
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:50,115
Five minutes out of bed

144
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:51,683
and look at all
the good I've done.

145
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:53,319
Time to get to Metropolis

146
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,452
to meet up with the Justice...

147
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:55,553
Oh, I know that grumble.

148
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,723
And it's saying,
"Donuts, now!"

149
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:59,759
And where are the best donuts?

150
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:01,062
Gotham City.

151
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,500
All the victims
are safely evacuated.

152
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:11,870
Plastic Man,

153
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:13,606
were you infected
by Joker's gas?

154
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:16,810
No, it's all this laughing.
It's hilarious.

155
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:20,712
Help me!

156
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,382
Plas, get serious,

157
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:26,551
we have to find a cure
for these civilians.

158
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:30,022
I wonder if I can alter the
molecular structure of Joker's gas

159
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:31,123
to create a cure.

160
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,761
- How?
- Wait here.

161
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:35,196
Okay.

162
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,366
Hypothesis.

163
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:43,435
At this size I should be able
to find trace elements

164
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:46,637
of Joker's gas still wafting
around the area.

165
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,140
Aha!

166
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:50,209
A Joker gas molecule.

167
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:52,277
There's nothing funny
about this.

168
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,481
Now for a little experiment.

169
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,118
- There he is.
- I've got this clown.

170
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,753
Never underestimate
the Joker, Firestorm.

171
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:05,190
I'll fly around behind him
and then we'll take him by...

172
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:06,525
Huh?

173
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:07,562
Surprise?

174
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:13,632
Not cool, man.

175
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:17,368
Batman will never
let me live this down.

176
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,672
Whoo hoos always bring a smile to my face.

177
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,911
You've got to be
faster than that

178
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,182
to sneak up on the Joker.

179
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:32,886
Where is Flash?

180
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:39,925
It's the Flash!

181
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:42,230
Best donut ever.

182
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:45,796
Saved the donut.

183
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,501
But who's gonna save you?

184
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:49,901
<i>Captain Cold?</i>

185
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:52,905
The only frosting I'm interested
in today is on this donut.

186
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:54,105
Give up now
and we'll chalk it up

187
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,340
to hysteria
over global warming.

188
00:09:57,577 --> 00:10:01,048
Instead, let's chalk it up
to global freezing.

189
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:05,316
"Global freezing"?
That doesn't even make sense.

190
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:08,119
Come on, Cold, you got
better material than that.

191
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:11,325
How about, "Chances of that
are below zero?"

192
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:14,459
Ah, never mind.

193
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:16,996
I can see
my puns leave you cold.

194
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:18,796
Cold.

195
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:19,998
He's all yours, Officer.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,999
Now it's off to Metropolis.

197
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,435
Thanks, Flash!

198
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:25,036
Hey, you know what goes good
with those donuts?

199
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,271
You ever been to that

200
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:28,373
Lampert's Milkshakes
in Star City?

201
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,309
No.

202
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,117
Ready, aim...

203
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:39,152
Fire!

204
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:44,890
These roboclowns are quick.

205
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:48,993
Whenever I visit the city,

206
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:52,330
I just love
to take in a good show.

207
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:54,932
Then you're gonna
love my performance as

208
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:56,634
a helicopter.

209
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:05,645
Well done, Plas.

210
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:09,046
Bravo! Wonderful performances.

211
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:11,517
I laughed, I cried.

212
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,552
My roboclowns died.

213
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:19,624
Photo for your biggest fan?

214
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,660
Say, "Cheese."

215
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:22,697
Plas, no!

216
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:30,335
That was the oldest trick
in the book, wasn't it?

217
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:33,240
You are so
gonna get it later.

218
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:38,743
I love it when they fall
for the classics.

219
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:41,579
Oh, Plastic Man!

220
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:44,718
Always clever,
but never too quick.

221
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:48,322
Flash.

222
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:54,693
Wow.

223
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:57,762
I mean, really, wow.

224
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:01,501
Batman is gonna be so mad.
He hates tardiness.

225
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:08,509
Ooh, a chase scene.
I love chase scenes.

226
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:14,847
<i>Captain Boomerang.</i>

227
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:17,114
You know, you're the second
captain wearing blue

228
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:18,517
that I've run into today.

229
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,085
You guys have a club
or something?

230
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:23,488
Yeah, it's the
"Let's destroy Flash" club.

231
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,625
Uh-oh.

232
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,658
And another, and another.

233
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,062
<i>And another.</i>

234
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:32,732
Ha! Missed me!

235
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,769
- Oh, did I?
- Yeah, you did.

236
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:36,634
Crikey!

237
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:45,243
Well, that puts the boom
in Boomerang.

238
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,012
Huh?

239
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:48,847
I missed
the trouble alert.

240
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:50,449
My bad, had it on vibrate.

241
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:52,620
Batman is gonna be so mad.

242
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:55,789
Blimey! Good shake.

243
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:05,296
<i>Attention,
Metropolis Board of Tourism,</i>

244
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:08,333
<i>I'm bored with your tourism.</i>

245
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,569
<i>Where's the whimsy,
where's the fun?</i>

246
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:13,371
<i>Well, I'm gonna give it to ya</i>

247
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:16,174
<i>with my Fun Cannon.</i>

248
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:21,345
At last,

249
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,614
my greatest foe
plays his final card.

250
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:25,984
And it's up to me alone
to stop him.

251
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:28,420
This could be our end game.

252
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:30,655
<i>The last battle in a long...</i>

253
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,723
<i>Impressive, his weapon
charged so quickly.</i>

254
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:35,830
He's going for the trigger. No time.
Have to strike now, go!

255
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:46,472
Batsy, how I've missed you
in Gotham City.

256
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:49,907
You're always off to play
with your superfriends now.

257
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:53,945
So I came all the way to
Metropolis to join the fun.

258
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:55,680
Fun's over, Joker.

259
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:57,616
I foiled your plan.

260
00:13:57,618 --> 00:13:59,618
What? Oh.

261
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,522
You thought your Batarang
defeated my Fun Cannon?

262
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,560
Wait, then
what's that button for?

263
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:08,727
This button?

264
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:11,229
It turns on
the air conditioner.

265
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:14,498
This button
fires my Fun Cannon.

266
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,169
No!

267
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:19,440
Too slow, Batsy.

268
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:34,219
This does not look good.

269
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:35,753
You're right.

270
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,491
It looks hilarious.

271
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:41,826
Thank you, thank you.
I'll be here all week.

272
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:45,629
In fact, I think
I'll stay here forever!

273
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:53,972
Now, if I just add this atom

274
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:55,540
on to this molecule,

275
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,745
it should make the gas inert.

276
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:01,579
Eureka!
I've discovered the cure.

277
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:04,184
Now, to synthesize a vaccine.

278
00:15:17,364 --> 00:15:19,367
Ta-da!

279
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:22,032
I said...

280
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,572
Ta-da.

281
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:36,648
Batclown?

282
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,719
Well, my work is done here.

283
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,528
Huh?

284
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:52,796
Sorry I'm late.

285
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:54,465
He took down the Joker! Thank you!

286
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,936
What?

287
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,605
Thank you, thank you.

288
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:02,340
You know,
it's all in a day's work.

289
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:04,443
Whoa! What happened to you?

290
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:08,012
This is what happens
when you're late!

291
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:09,613
I know, I am so sorry.

292
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:11,583
I had my League alert
on vibrate.

293
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:14,152
And then a really busy morning with
Captain Cold and Captain Boomerang.

294
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:15,487
But, hey,
the Joker is captured

295
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:17,790
and everyone seems
no worse for wear.

296
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:20,358
- Well, mostly...
- And the <i>Daily Planet?</i>

297
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,792
What?

298
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:25,565
Extreme building makeover
in three, two, one!

299
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:32,974
Ta-da!

300
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:37,108
- Hurray!
- Flash is the best.

301
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,011
Super speed fixes everything.
Just like new.

302
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:41,512
You want me
to fix you up, too, Batman?

303
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:44,016
Not everything
can be fixed with speed.

304
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:46,550
Flash, what Batman
is trying to say,

305
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:48,286
is that we're you're friends.

306
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:49,787
That's not what I said.

307
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:53,257
And we want you to be
the best hero you can be.

308
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,326
Sometimes that means
slowing down.

309
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,395
Being aware
of your surroundings.

310
00:16:57,397 --> 00:17:00,301
And always having a plan.

311
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:03,468
- Flash?
- Slow down.

312
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,504
Surroundings and plan, got it.

313
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:07,271
- Hashtag proactive.
- <i>Flash?</i>

314
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:09,408
Updating my
Hero Hotline, Herogram.

315
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,476
I-Hero, Herotopia and MyHero

316
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:14,078
with my takedown
of the Joker.

317
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,514
Oh, thank you, Justice League.

318
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:19,084
We don't know
what we'd do without you.

319
00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:21,719
- Well...
- Well, Mayor, as long as I'm the fastest man alive,

320
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,322
you'll never
have to worry about it.

321
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:27,092
But you aren't
the fastest man alive.

322
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:28,426
<i>You're a fraud,</i>

323
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:30,061
just like the rest
of the Justice League.

324
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:34,035
Something the world will see
soon enough.

325
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:39,536
- Who was that?
- No clue.

326
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,539
But I'm gonna find out.

327
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,776
Flash, wait.

328
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,652
Huh? This guy
is seriously fast.

329
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:56,153
Are you wearing iron boots?

330
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:57,456
I knew you would be slow,

331
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,794
but I didn't know
you'd be this slow.

332
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,061
No way you're beating me.

333
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,809
Whoa! That's new.

334
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,315
Wow!

335
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:25,616
<i>Where am I?</i>

336
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:28,253
Don't worry,
you'll see it again.

337
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:29,557
Soon.

338
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:39,600
Deja vu. Bah.

339
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:43,403
You'd think I'd learn by now.

340
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:46,139
Nice.

341
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,707
Oh, yeah. It's go time!

342
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:52,980
- Hey, you hit my car!
- What? That ain't my fault, look at my car.

343
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:55,747
Guys, we did this yesterday,

344
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:58,048
you really gotta watch
where you're going.

345
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,617
Thanks, Flash.

346
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:02,489
- No school.
- No way. No school?

347
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,289
Two blowouts in a row?

348
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,525
Listen, here's the card for a
tire shop I know across town.

349
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:10,394
They'll give you a great deal on
new tires if you mention my name.

350
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,130
- See ya.
- Uh...

351
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:13,532
Thanks, Flash?

352
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:15,132
Thanks, Flash.

353
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:19,970
Whoa!

354
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:22,106
Ha! You know, I like this one
even better than the one

355
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,144
we put up yesterday.

356
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:25,012
Thanks, Flash!

357
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,612
Triple deja vu.

358
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:28,913
Oh, hungry.

359
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:30,614
You know what would make
my tummy feel better?

360
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,616
Another round
of donuts at Fox's

361
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:34,084
and this time I won't have
to worry about

362
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:36,921
Captain Cold
interrupting my chowtime.

363
00:19:36,923 --> 00:19:38,192
- It's the Flash.
- Ooh!

364
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:40,693
Best donut ever...

365
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:43,327
Ugh. Seriously?

366
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:44,962
There's no way
this is happening again.

367
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:47,864
Chalk it up
to global freezing!

368
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:50,267
- Well, now you're just repeating yourself.
- No, I'm not!

369
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:53,171
Yeah, you said the same
thing to me yesterday.

370
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:54,573
Yesterday?

371
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:56,708
Yesterday I was
at home planning this heist.

372
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,449
It looks like you might be suffering
from some brain freeze.

373
00:20:02,182 --> 00:20:03,481
I...

374
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:04,716
I don't even have
a comeback for this,

375
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:06,651
this is just too weird.

376
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,585
Okay, one more time,
like this.

377
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,055
Put that there,
you go over here.

378
00:20:10,057 --> 00:20:11,925
And I step out of the way.

379
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:16,061
He's all yours, Officers.

380
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:18,228
This time, try to keep him
in prison, would you?

381
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,864
Hey, Flash, you know what
goes good with those donuts?

382
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,467
Lampert's Milkshakes
in Star City?

383
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:24,471
Oh, you've been there?

384
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:27,205
Yeah, pretty sure.

385
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:33,311
That's the same car.

386
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:35,646
Something seriously
strange is going on.

387
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:38,249
I have gotta get
to Metropolis.

388
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:42,223
Hold this for me.

389
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:44,892
Huh?

390
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,198
Thanks, Flash.

391
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,665
What a day.

392
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:58,269
Fun's over,
I foiled your plan.

393
00:20:58,271 --> 00:20:59,837
What?

394
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,374
Oh, you thought your Batarang
defeated my Fun Cannon?

395
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:08,546
Wait, then what's
that button for?

396
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:09,847
This button?

397
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:12,049
It turns on
the air conditioner.

398
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:15,987
This button
fires my Fun Cannon.

399
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,059
- Huh?
- Looking for this?

400
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:27,000
Ow, that looked painful.

401
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:31,937
You're late.

402
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:34,742
I was hoping for a,
"Thanks, Flash."

403
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:38,477
Vacation's over.

404
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:41,246
And I didn't even get a tan.

405
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:45,917
Oh, man, guys, I have had
the weirdest day.

406
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,952
It's like everything I did
yesterday is repeating itself.

407
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:49,988
Except right now, because
when I got here yesterday,

408
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,690
the <i>Daily Planet</i>
had been Joker-fied

409
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:53,158
and Batman was
dressed like a clown.

410
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,492
Highly unlikely.

411
00:21:54,494 --> 00:21:55,994
Flash, your tardiness today

412
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:58,429
endangered this city
and the League. You need to...

413
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:00,698
Slow down, be aware of my
surroundings and have a plan.

414
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,235
Exact... Wait a minute.
Have I...

415
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:05,569
Given the speech before?
Yes, yesterday.

416
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:08,641
- Which feels like...
- Deja vu?

417
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:12,244
You! You did this!

418
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:15,479
I'm not sure what you did,
but I know it's your fault.

419
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:19,984
- Who was that?
- No clue.

420
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:23,055
- But I'm gonna find out.
- Flash, wait!

421
00:22:30,997 --> 00:22:32,663
Still not fast enough.

422
00:22:32,665 --> 00:22:34,599
You are not
getting away this time.

423
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:36,199
You can't catch me.

424
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:38,872
Maybe you'll have
better luck yesterday.

425
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:46,611
Oh, man.

426
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:48,215
My deja vu is having deja vu.

427
00:23:02,128 --> 00:23:03,129
Thanks, Flash!

428
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:05,398
Thanks, Flash.

429
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:08,467
Thanks, Flash.

430
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:09,702
What a day.

431
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:13,671
It's the trouble alert!

432
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:15,940
Let's see
who needs our help today.

433
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:18,276
This is Lois Lane
with <i>Breaking News.</i>

434
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:21,011
Gotham City's clown prince
of crime, the Joker,

435
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:22,980
was invading our beloved city,

436
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:25,150
- but he suddenly vanished.
- Huh?

437
00:23:25,152 --> 00:23:28,420
Is your trouble alert always
this not troubling?

438
00:23:28,422 --> 00:23:29,720
Guys!

439
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:31,154
Look, I stopped the Joker,
but listen.

440
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:32,457
I've got an even
bigger problem.

441
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:35,794
Great Scott, you're right.
Your pants!

442
00:23:35,796 --> 00:23:37,228
- <i>They're gone.</i>
- Huh?

443
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,796
Looks like
you ran out of pants.

444
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,835
So is Flash
actually in the League,

445
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:47,671
or just, like,
an honorary member?

446
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:50,674
Well, that explains the draft.

447
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,344
Listen, I was
in a hurry and...

448
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:55,078
<i>They'll never
believe you, Flash.</i>

449
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,950
This will be
our little secret.

450
00:23:58,818 --> 00:24:00,919
- Who's that?
- Get back here!

451
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:02,554
Flash, wait.

452
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:10,861
Still not fast enough.

453
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:12,432
Try harder next time.

454
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:18,068
That's it!
This is the last time.

455
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:52,839
Flash, wait.

456
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:54,775
Flash, wait.

457
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:57,341
Flash, wait.

458
00:24:57,343 --> 00:24:58,345
Batman.

459
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:04,149
Aren't you the best sidekick ever?

460
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:06,651
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

461
00:25:06,653 --> 00:25:08,786
Aw, I want a Bat belly rub.

462
00:25:08,788 --> 00:25:10,787
Batman, I just...
Don't worry.

463
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:14,424
I took care of Captain Cold,
Captain Boomerang and the Joker.

464
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:16,061
Thank you?

465
00:25:16,063 --> 00:25:17,894
And I only have a few minutes
before it starts all over again.

466
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,697
Before what
starts all over again?

467
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:23,301
Referencing events yet to happen?
An agitated emotional state?

468
00:25:23,303 --> 00:25:24,268
Time loop.

469
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,805
- Yes, that's it.
- Impossible.

470
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:28,573
This isn't
our first tangle with time.

471
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,540
Happens a lot
in the superhero business.

472
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:32,811
I keep living the same day
over and over again.

473
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:34,444
I feel like
I've hit a dead end.

474
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,014
Fun fact.

475
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:38,949
At the subatomic level, dead ends
aren't really dead ends at all.

476
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:41,518
There is always space
between the molecules

477
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,157
that allow atoms
to move between them and...

478
00:25:45,525 --> 00:25:47,124
And you don't care.

479
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:49,594
So, Batman, what should I do?

480
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:53,698
Hmm, it's theoretically possible
to break out of a time loop.

481
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,433
But frankly, I don't think
you're fast enough.

482
00:25:56,435 --> 00:25:57,767
Not fast enough?

483
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,271
I thought you would
have the answer, Batman.

484
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:01,274
I was wrong.

485
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,009
Nice reverse
psychology, Batman.

486
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:08,011
That's just what
he needed to hear.

487
00:26:08,013 --> 00:26:09,546
Now where's he going?

488
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:11,951
Not where. When.

489
00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:16,621
You still can't
seem to catch me.

490
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:32,202
Why won't it fly, Dad?

491
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:33,970
There needs to be a wind.

492
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,573
- Whoa!
- Son!

493
00:26:35,575 --> 00:26:39,142
This is amazing!

494
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:45,184
Just a little faster, Flash.

495
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:48,652
Not today or again or...

496
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,057
Whatever!

497
00:26:56,997 --> 00:27:00,500
Everything is
going perfectly to plan.

498
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:08,172
Whoa.

499
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:10,475
Well, at least
I'm not in bed again.

500
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:12,144
But where am I?

501
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:15,278
We hate you, Flash.

502
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,582
You're horrible. You're awful.

503
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:19,984
Boo!

504
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:22,553
What a phenomenal
disappointment.

505
00:27:22,555 --> 00:27:24,121
What was that about?

506
00:27:24,123 --> 00:27:26,590
Everyone loves the Flash.

507
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,395
At least they used to.

508
00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:32,965
Okay, this is crazy, I need
to get back to the League.

509
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:35,766
That's weird.

510
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:37,634
Let's try that again.

511
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:39,836
My powers.

512
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:41,072
They're gone.

513
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:43,110
I've gotta get to the Hall!

514
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:47,277
Oh, man.

515
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,983
I can see
why people hate to run.

516
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:55,122
Maybe Cyborg can fix my...

517
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:58,125
- Hmm.
- Hmph.

518
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,059
Uh, hey, guys,
why the mean faces?

519
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,629
You starched my cape.

520
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:08,065
You switched my shampoo
with fire extinguishing cream!

521
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:10,101
You painted my invisible jet.

522
00:28:10,103 --> 00:28:11,201
Now it's just...

523
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:13,103
Just visible!

524
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:15,472
You replaced my arm
with an egg beater.

525
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:17,208
Sure the eggs are amazing,
but still.

526
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,809
And you decided
it would be fun

527
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:21,578
to mix up the pouches
on my utility belt.

528
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,712
What?

529
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:24,280
No, no, I didn't do
any of those things,

530
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:25,882
you don't understand.

531
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:28,219
There was this blurry guy
and we started running and...

532
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:29,921
We don't wanna hear it, Flash.

533
00:28:29,923 --> 00:28:32,323
You've pulled at least 52
pranks on the Justice League

534
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:34,691
in the five days since
I've joined.

535
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:35,793
Five days?

536
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:37,429
You just joined this morning.

537
00:28:37,431 --> 00:28:39,130
I'm outta here.

538
00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:40,498
Atom's right.

539
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,867
Flash, your pranks
require punishment.

540
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:45,569
You're fired.

541
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:47,373
Uh... Uh...

542
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,725
Oh.

543
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:09,563
No power, no League.

544
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:11,796
What do I do now?

545
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:13,733
Fade into obscurity I hope.

546
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:17,234
Hey, that's my costume.

547
00:29:17,236 --> 00:29:19,272
Is it? I hadn't noticed.

548
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:23,039
You!

549
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,909
The pranks, the time loop.

550
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:26,142
It was all you.

551
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,078
You messed
with the wrong hero,

552
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,548
yellow blur guy.

553
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,951
Uh-uh-uh. Don't blame me for
the time loop, Barry.

554
00:29:34,953 --> 00:29:38,555
You were the fool that had to prove
you were the fastest man alive.

555
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:41,959
<i>But you didn't know about
the Speed Force, did you?</i>

556
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:45,263
<i>A force that runs through
all of space and time.</i>

557
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:47,230
<i>Every time you chased me
into the Speedway,</i>

558
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:51,235
<i>I led you backwards in time to
relive the same day over and over.</i>

559
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:53,103
<i>And while you were
stuck in your time loop,</i>

560
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:54,771
<i>I turned everyone against you,</i>

561
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:57,676
<i>and then tricked you into
severing your Speed Force power.</i>

562
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:02,947
But why? What did
I ever do to you?

563
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:04,151
What did you...

564
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:07,352
What didn't you do?

565
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:10,086
The Flash, according
to future history books,

566
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:11,854
the world's favorite hero.

567
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:13,990
So funny, so perfect.

568
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:16,094
So fast!

569
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:17,995
But I'm faster.

570
00:30:17,997 --> 00:30:22,967
Yet, nobody will recognize my greatness
while I live in your shadow.

571
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:24,669
That is why I,

572
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:26,370
the Reverse-Flash,

573
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:30,874
have traveled back in time
to ruin you.

574
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:33,277
So, you're from the future

575
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,446
and you call yourself
Reverse-Flash?

576
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:36,948
Ugh. Really? I mean...

577
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,083
- Do you run backwards or something?
- No.

578
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:41,219
- Are you super slow?
- No.

579
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:42,920
I'm just the reverse of you.

580
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:44,555
You're good and I'm bad.

581
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:46,757
Then wouldn't you be called
Evil Flash

582
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,924
or Bad Flash?

583
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:50,661
I'm just Reverse-Flash, okay?

584
00:30:50,663 --> 00:30:51,664
Okay.

585
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:55,231
That's enough of that.

586
00:30:57,636 --> 00:31:00,938
Please, Barry.
You know how it is.

587
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,206
Me, fast,

588
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,475
you, slow.

589
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:06,276
<i>Now that you've been beaten,</i>

590
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:07,879
it's time for
the world to know

591
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:11,748
who is truly the greatest
speedster of all time.

592
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,751
My friends in the Justice
League will stop you.

593
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:16,219
Your friends?

594
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:18,789
You mean the people that just
kicked you out of their club?

595
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:21,592
Well, I'll tell you
what, Barry.

596
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:25,328
Since you care
for them so much

597
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,998
I'm going to
take care of them next.

598
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:41,844
Looks like Flash
was telling the truth.

599
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:44,347
This Reverse-Flash character
kept him in a time loop

600
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:46,283
while he ruined
his reputation.

601
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:48,221
That rotten rascal.

602
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:52,123
Whoa.

603
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,924
- I broke 'em.
- Don't worry, Flash.

604
00:31:53,926 --> 00:31:56,626
Once I enlarge, we'll inform
the Justice League together

605
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:59,029
and stop this
fast-paced villain. Hmm?

606
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:01,599
Oh, this isn't good. This isn't good at all.

607
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:05,670
My white dwarf shrinking belt must've shorted
out when those shackles stunned Flash,

608
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:08,338
along with my
communication systems.

609
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,040
Flash! Can you hear me?

610
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:12,776
- Flash! Flash, over here, Flash.
- Great.

611
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:14,911
What do I do now?
I'm powerless.

612
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:17,815
My friends, if you can call them
that, kicked me out of the League.

613
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:20,951
Oh, this can't be
happening to me.

614
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:22,318
You think you have problems?

615
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,188
I'm too small
to be seen or heard.

616
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,790
At least you can pick up
the phone and talk to some...

617
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:27,927
Wait a second.

618
00:32:31,797 --> 00:32:34,164
I can't give Flash
his powers back.

619
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,999
But I know someone who might.

620
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:39,370
And the only thing that stands
between me and helping the Flash...

621
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:41,337
Is fruit salad.

622
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:42,576
How hard can this be?

623
00:32:43,976 --> 00:32:46,580
Whoa!

624
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:55,455
Yes!

625
00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:04,897
Ha!

626
00:33:05,765 --> 00:33:08,231
Huh? Oh.

627
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,773
That's weird,
usually when I butt-dial,

628
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:17,240
my butt is actually
near the phone.

629
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:19,378
Uh-oh.

630
00:33:25,183 --> 00:33:29,353
<i>Welcome to
Doctor Fate's magic helpline.</i>

631
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:33,024
<i>Do you feel like the world's
turned against you?</i>

632
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:34,792
Yes, yes, I do.

633
00:33:34,794 --> 00:33:38,395
<i>Do you feel like you've lost
that pep in your step?</i>

634
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:40,998
Oh, wow. Yeah,
I've lost all my pep.

635
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,168
<i>Do you feel like someone is trying
to take your place in life?</i>

636
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:48,205
<i>Maybe kick you out of a club?
Or League?</i>

637
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:51,775
I don't know who this guy is,
but he is good.

638
00:33:51,777 --> 00:33:53,911
<i>Well, if any of that
applies to you,</i>

639
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:57,514
<i>do yourself a solid
and press one, now.</i>

640
00:33:57,516 --> 00:34:00,784
Well, Barry,
let's hope this helps.

641
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:04,055
Huh?

642
00:34:04,057 --> 00:34:06,190
Wait, wait, wait!

643
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:08,426
I'm going with you.

644
00:34:08,428 --> 00:34:12,063
It looks like I'm going
to have to do this the hard way.

645
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:13,963
I'll just have to
get to Metropolis

646
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:15,766
and tell the Justice League
everything that's happened.

647
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:17,568
It shouldn't be that hard.

648
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,874
I'll just slip under Flash's
front door, hop on a bus and...

649
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,742
Oh, no.

650
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:30,581
Now that the Flash is gone,

651
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:33,050
we'll need someone else
to take the minutes.

652
00:34:33,052 --> 00:34:35,655
Oh! Me! Me! Me!

653
00:34:37,123 --> 00:34:38,590
- Cyborg?
- Yes.

654
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:46,396
It looks like trouble
is springing up all over the map.

655
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:49,400
All right, team, split up and
let's take care of business.

656
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:51,034
Cyborg, read that back to me.

657
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:53,903
"All right, team, split up and
let's take care of business.

658
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,671
"Cyborg, read that
back to me."

659
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:57,807
Good job, let's move.

660
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:59,342
"Good job.

661
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:01,814
"Let's M-O-V-E."

662
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:09,153
Too long have humans gorged
themselves at the salad bar.

663
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:13,356
Now it's time for the plants
to gorge at the human bar.

664
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:17,128
Stop.

665
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,563
I'm the Mayor,
I command you to stop.

666
00:35:24,637 --> 00:35:27,737
Sorry, Poison Ivy.

667
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:29,005
I heard someone screaming.

668
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:30,840
And you know,
"I scream, you scream,

669
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:32,644
"we all scream for ice cream."

670
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:34,581
Get him.

671
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:43,253
Oh, man.

672
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:45,991
- Plants should be seen, not heard.
- Huh?

673
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:51,528
"Wimbley for Mayor"?

674
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,796
A mayoral float! Oh!

675
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:56,833
- Thank you, Mr...
- Reverse-Flash is my name

676
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:59,635
and helping people out
is my game.

677
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:01,572
Now, I must be away.

678
00:36:01,574 --> 00:36:05,376
There are other citizens
that need my help.

679
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:10,280
Signal watch. Signal watch.

680
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:12,048
Come on, Superman.

681
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,619
This will teach Olsen not to
take a photo of my bad side.

682
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:18,054
I'm sorry, Mr. Croc.

683
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:21,157
It's just, with you
every side is a bad side.

684
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,425
<i>Killer Croc!</i>

685
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:25,229
Unhand Superman's pal,
Jimmy Olsen.

686
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:26,499
Never!

687
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,904
I've got this, Plas.

688
00:36:33,706 --> 00:36:35,974
I can cut logs, too, Supes,
check it out.

689
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:46,920
Plas!

690
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:52,659
Uh-oh.

691
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:56,760
How did you do that?

692
00:36:56,762 --> 00:37:00,463
Child's play
for Reverse-Flash.

693
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:03,802
Say, I don't suppose you have
a signal watch, do you?

694
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:06,771
Deathstroke!

695
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:08,975
He's stealing
our shipment of gold!

696
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:13,409
Gold is a great
investment in your future.

697
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:17,380
But the only future
you've got is behind bars.

698
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:36,300
All in a day's work for...

699
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:38,605
Reverse-Flash.

700
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:42,238
Reverse-Flash is the best!

701
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,974
Reverse-Flash, you did it.

702
00:37:43,976 --> 00:37:45,242
Trouble at sea?

703
00:37:45,244 --> 00:37:47,443
Aquaman is in.

704
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:49,512
Reverse-Flash took care of it.

705
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:51,282
Aquaman is out.

706
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:54,717
I'm embarrassed.

707
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,288
But I'm also
a little impressed.

708
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:04,829
All right, Penguin,
drop your weapon.

709
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:07,197
Yeah. I'll drop my weapon,
all right.

710
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,535
On you!

711
00:38:14,273 --> 00:38:17,210
Not before
I get the drop on you.

712
00:38:21,547 --> 00:38:22,882
Uh-oh.

713
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:28,818
Batman just
launched the missile.

714
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,287
We're doomed!

715
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:33,793
Don't worry. Reverse-Flash
will take care of it.

716
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:38,197
What?

717
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:52,642
Hurray!

718
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:54,311
He built
a perfectly safe playground

719
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:58,249
- out of explosive missile parts.
- Amazing.

720
00:38:58,251 --> 00:39:00,583
Courtesy of the...

721
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:02,788
Reverse-Flash.

722
00:39:05,391 --> 00:39:08,659
Yeah. Let's hear it
for Reverse-Flash.

723
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:11,228
Reverse-Flash, huh?

724
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,264
Hmm.

725
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:18,034
That was weird.

726
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:19,805
But not like
floating castle weird.

727
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:25,641
Wow. Magical stairs.

728
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:27,212
I wish there was
a magic escalator.

729
00:39:35,054 --> 00:39:36,820
Huh?

730
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:43,760
Yeah, um...

731
00:39:43,762 --> 00:39:46,496
I'm talking backwards.

732
00:39:46,498 --> 00:39:48,231
Just come in, okay?

733
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:49,735
Okay, sure.

734
00:40:09,655 --> 00:40:12,322
Wow. You guys
really like stairs.

735
00:40:12,324 --> 00:40:14,525

739
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:27,938

101 is a magic requirement.

740
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,876
- <i>Zatanna!</i>
- Sorry! Uh, I mean, "Yrros."

not strange at all.

00:40:48,726 --> 00:40:51,927
Huh? Whoa!

743
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:55,333

room I've ever been in.

744

745
00:41:02,574 --> 00:41:05,175

It's nice to finally meet you.

Please tell me your blues, and
we'll, uh, sort it out.

750
00:41:17,422 --> 00:41:18,822
My blues?

751
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:22,193
Well, a couple of days ago,
I was stuck in a time loop.

752
00:41:23,262 --> 00:41:26,664
Okay, uh,
does she always do that?

753
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:29,231
It's magic, man! Keep going.

Magic.

784
00:43:06,632 --> 00:43:09,766
Anyway, can your magic tell me
why I've lost my powers?

785
00:43:09,768 --> 00:43:12,038
Hmm.

786
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:19,211
It looks like your connection
to the Speed Force is broken.

787
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:21,177
Speed Force?

788
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:22,780
Reverse-Flash
said something about that.

789
00:43:22,782 --> 00:43:24,648
But I have no idea
what he meant.

790
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,016
What's the Speed Force?

791
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:27,349
A mysterious energy

792
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:30,954
that grants the ability
to move at super speed.

793
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:33,856
Oh. The day I got my powers?

794
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:35,891
That was a total fluke.

795
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:37,994
You see, there was this lightning and
then these chemicals spilled on me...

796
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:39,762
That's what you thought.

797
00:43:39,764 --> 00:43:43,499
The reality is that you were
chosen to be the Flash.

798
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:46,570
These powers
are a gift given to you

799
00:43:46,572 --> 00:43:49,072
<i>from the Speed Force.</i>

800
00:43:49,074 --> 00:43:51,775
But your connection to it
was broken.

801
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:53,742
So, what now? Can you fix it?

802
00:43:53,744 --> 00:43:55,244
No.

803
00:43:55,246 --> 00:43:58,514
But I can take you to where
the Speed Force lives.

804
00:43:58,516 --> 00:44:00,816
- Where it lives?
- Yes.

805
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:02,519
We're going to

806
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:04,688
the Speed Force Zone.

807
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,624
The Speed Force Zone. That
sounds awesome.

808
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:08,992
Step back.

809
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:11,561
It's magic time.

810
00:44:11,563 --> 00:44:15,666
With the force of fate
and wits unified,

811
00:44:15,668 --> 00:44:19,338
take us away on a groovy ride.

812
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:30,046
- Whoo-hoo! Field trip!
- Zatanna?

813

Yrros.

814
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,190
That's... That's the place I saw when I
was running after the Reverse-Flash.

815
00:44:40,192 --> 00:44:42,592
It's called the Speedway.

816
00:44:42,594 --> 00:44:46,064
Our gateway to
the Speed Force Zone.

Just look at that

831
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:48,659
Reverse-Flash is so fast, he's
stopping crime before we can even...

832
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,994
Finally an emergency.

833
00:45:50,996 --> 00:45:53,262
Aw, yeah!

834
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:55,632
He got there first.

835
00:45:55,634 --> 00:45:58,568
That's 22 emergencies
he's fixed today.

836
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:02,475
And he's just passed me
in friends on Herobook.

837
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:09,746
Well, it's a good thing things

844
00:46:25,998 --> 00:46:28,998
beloved speedster.

845
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,603
Whoo-hoo! I'm gonna get my powers back!
I'm gonna get my powers back!

846
00:46:33,605 --> 00:46:35,472
Oh.

847
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:38,874
But, uh, first,
I might need a snack.

848
00:46:41,146 --> 00:46:42,579
Thank you.

849
00:46:42,581 --> 00:46:44,914
Shouldn't you be driving?

850
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:46,583
Don't worry.

851
00:46:46,585 --> 00:46:49,184
The Doc just gave me my magician's
permit for hands-free driving.

852
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:51,287
- Zatanna.
- Yrros.

853
00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:54,224
Now listen, when you arrive
at the Speed Force Zone,

854
00:46:54,226 --> 00:46:56,159
you'll go through
a series of tests

855
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:59,295
to make sure you're worthy.

856
00:46:59,297 --> 00:47:00,530
Worthy of what?

857
00:47:00,532 --> 00:47:03,333
That's what
you need to find out.

858
00:47:03,335 --> 00:47:05,302
That's the mystery.

859
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:08,137
That's the magic.

860
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:11,240
Yeah. Yeah. But you'll be
there to help me, right?

861
00:47:11,242 --> 00:47:12,541
I'm sorry.

862
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:14,344
The Speed Force Zone
is only accessible

863
00:47:14,346 --> 00:47:16,345
to those with speed powers.

864
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:21,050
Or in your case,
former speed powers.

865
00:47:21,052 --> 00:47:22,985
Well, this is it.

866
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:25,054
- Any parting words?
- Yeah.

867
00:47:25,056 --> 00:47:27,724
Tuck and roll, baby.

868
00:47:27,726 --> 00:47:29,291
Tuck and roll?

869
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:31,163
- What is that...
- Yrros.

870
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,838
Oh.

871
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,104
Whoa.

872
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:44,106
Wow. Would you look at that?

873
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:48,211
It's some sort of Speed
Force Zone temple thingy.

874
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:51,715
And it almost feels like the temple
is giving off some sort of energy.

875
00:47:51,717 --> 00:47:53,816
The Speed Force!

876
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:55,318
If that's where
the Speed Force is,

877
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,590
that's where I need to be,
and fast.

878
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:07,563
All right. These must be the tests
Doctor Fate was talking about.

879
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:11,400
<i>Bricks moving superfast,
vibrating through solid matter.</i>

880
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:14,237
And I just have to make it
to the other side.

881
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:16,842
Well, this shouldn't be
too hard.

882
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:24,148
Those speed bricks
really pack a wallop,

883
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,719
but if at first
you don't succeed...

884
00:48:36,528 --> 00:48:40,463
Okay.
This is not working.

885
00:48:40,465 --> 00:48:42,632
There has to be a trick.

886
00:48:42,634 --> 00:48:47,070
We want you to be the best
hero you can be.

887
00:48:47,072 --> 00:48:51,844
Sometimes that means
slowing down.

888
00:48:53,878 --> 00:48:57,012
Mmm. Slow down.

889
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:58,648
Yeah, thanks, Supe.

890
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,288
Well, going fast didn't work,
and Fate said I'd be tested.

891
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:13,729
How is this working?

892
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:18,204
I really, really, really
hate going slow.

893
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:21,637
Holy moly.

894
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:24,039
It actually worked!
I did it!

895
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,342

We're spying on Reverse-Flash,

and reveal
his true evil intentions.

00:52:27,425 --> 00:52:28,724
Correct, Cyborg.

942

You're a hero
that never asks for accolades

957
00:53:12,204 --> 00:53:15,570
or wears something
as gaudy as a cape.

958

- Gaudy?

959

And for that,

Soon the world will realize

That I, Reverse-Flash,

00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:43,733
<i>You're putting too much weight
on the support beam.</i>

969
00:53:43,735 --> 00:53:45,671
You need to...

970
00:53:48,005 --> 00:53:51,941
This is why
the Batman works alone.

971
00:53:51,943 --> 00:53:53,242
Oh, look!

972
00:53:53,244 --> 00:53:55,144
It's the Justice League.

973
00:53:55,146 --> 00:53:58,447
Or should I say
the Jobless League.

974
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:04,653
Sadly, I agree.

975
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:07,856
- Huh?
- This can only mean one thing.

976
00:54:07,858 --> 00:54:11,693
The Justice League
is now retired.

977
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:22,505
Whoo-hoo!

978
00:54:22,507 --> 00:54:24,510
Whoa! Huh?

979
00:54:25,543 --> 00:54:28,610
Whoa!

980
00:54:28,612 --> 00:54:30,646
<i>A maze?
Well, I love mazes!</i>

981
00:54:30,648 --> 00:54:33,617
They're amazing.

982
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:37,021
I'm almost there. I can
feel my powers coming back.

983
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:43,728
Hey, look at that.
Almost back to full speed.

984
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:47,665
Yeah! Oh, no. Huh?

985
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:02,512
So all I have to do is get
through the maze in the dark.

986
00:55:02,514 --> 00:55:05,680
With my super speed back,
that shouldn't be a problem.

987
00:55:05,682 --> 00:55:08,219
<i>Ow, ow, ow!</i>

988
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,688
Okay. It's a problem!

989
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:16,092
What is it with this place
trying to hurt me?

990
00:55:16,094 --> 00:55:17,994
What was it Batman said?

991
00:55:17,996 --> 00:55:19,729
- Always have a plan.
- Always have a plan.

992
00:55:19,731 --> 00:55:22,100
Okay, so, Flash,
what's your plan?

993
00:55:25,103 --> 00:55:27,403
Oh! I can make a plan
from up here.

994
00:55:27,405 --> 00:55:29,338
Okay. Now let's see.

995
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,175
<i>Left, right, right, right.
Wait, no, no, no, no.</i>

996
00:55:32,177 --> 00:55:35,577
<i>Okay. Left, right, right,
right, left...</i>

997
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:38,046
<i>Okay. Left, right, left,</i>

998
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:40,316
left, right, left, right,
left, left,

999
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:43,351
right, right, left, left.
Perfect.

1000
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:44,855
Okay, I got it. I got it.

1001
00:55:50,128 --> 00:55:51,459
Whoo-hoo!

1002
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:52,965
The final door.

1003
00:55:56,134 --> 00:55:59,369
Aw, come on! How can I get
through this solid door?

1004
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:00,739
It's a dead end!

1005
00:56:01,338 --> 00:56:02,438
Fun fact.

1006
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,738
At the subatomic level,

1007
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,008
dead ends aren't really
dead ends at all.

1008
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,276
There is always space
between the molecules

1009
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:10,882
that allow atoms
to move between them.

1010
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:13,950
If the Atom is right,

1011
00:56:13,952 --> 00:56:16,284
and there is space
between everything,

1012
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:18,822
I just have to do
what the speed bricks did

1013
00:56:18,824 --> 00:56:21,925
and vibrate my molecules
to fit between them.

1014
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:25,230
Well, here goes everything.

1015
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:31,135
Whoa! Whoo!

1016
00:56:33,972 --> 00:56:36,307
I just vibrated
through that wall.

1017
00:56:37,442 --> 00:56:39,110
I can do anything!

1018
00:56:39,744 --> 00:56:41,077
That's it.

1019
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:44,115
I can feel it
radiating the Speed Force.

1020
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:52,487
Wow!

1021
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:54,992
It's some kind of nexus.

1022
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:00,896
It's amazing!

1023
00:57:00,898 --> 00:57:03,398
I've finally done it!

1024
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,168
Nothing can stop...

1025
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:07,168
Whoa!

1026
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,205
Huh?

1027
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:10,539
At last!

1028
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:12,075
<i>Reverse-Flash?</i>

1029
00:57:12,077 --> 00:57:14,744
- But how?
- Still too slow, aren't you?

1030
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:16,211
The time loop.

1031
00:57:16,213 --> 00:57:19,115
You breaking your connection
to the Speed Force,

1032
00:57:19,117 --> 00:57:21,383
I knew it would all
lead you here,

1033
00:57:21,385 --> 00:57:23,117
to the Speed Force nexus.

1034
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,121
And also, through that
ridiculous obstacle course...

1035
00:57:26,123 --> 00:57:28,258
I mean, are you kidding me?

1036
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,590
<i>Dangerous!</i>

1037
00:57:29,592 --> 00:57:33,762
So I duped you into opening
the three doors for me.

1038
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:36,499
Congratulations, loser!

1039
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:37,733
And now,

1040
00:57:37,735 --> 00:57:39,836
with the power of the nexus,

1041
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:42,106
nothing can stand in my way.

1042
00:57:48,713 --> 00:57:50,112
The power!

1043
00:57:50,114 --> 00:57:54,751
It's... It's like
drinking 52 milkshakes

1044
00:57:54,753 --> 00:57:57,519
and eating
a bag of jelly beans!

1045
00:57:57,521 --> 00:58:00,389
Invigorating!

1046
00:58:00,391 --> 00:58:03,325
The nexus is mine!
I earned it!

1047
00:58:03,327 --> 00:58:04,559
Ooh.

1048
00:58:04,561 --> 00:58:07,098
Good luck being trapped here
for all eternity.

1049
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:21,242
I can't believe
that we're retiring.

1050
00:58:21,244 --> 00:58:23,278
I mean,
where do we go from here?

1051
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,581
Heroes, Cyborg,
never give up hope.

1052
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:29,485
And I haven't given up
investigating Reverse-Flash.

1053
00:58:29,487 --> 00:58:32,621
<i>Oh, how the mighty
have fallen.</i>

1054
00:58:32,623 --> 00:58:34,856
<i>The once great Justice League</i>

1055
00:58:34,858 --> 00:58:37,827
<i>forced into retirement.</i>

1056
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:40,128
<i>Face it, super zeroes,</i>

1057
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,731
<i>you're yesterday's news!</i>

1058
00:58:41,733 --> 00:58:46,267
<i>Today's fast-paced world
needs a hero like yours truly.</i>

1059
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:49,505
<i>And thanks
to your old pal, Flash,</i>

1060
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:53,008
<i>future history books
will know only me</i>

1061
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:55,244
<i>as Earth's greatest champion.</i>

1062
00:58:55,246 --> 00:58:56,314
<i>Watch.</i>

1063
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,783
Look, outside!

1064
00:59:12,663 --> 00:59:13,862
What is he doing?

1065
00:59:13,864 --> 00:59:15,530
He's walling us in.

1066
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:18,066
He must not be aware
of my super strength.

1067
00:59:18,068 --> 00:59:20,304
Or my ability
to transform matter.

1068
00:59:24,476 --> 00:59:25,577
Uh-oh.

1069
00:59:29,646 --> 00:59:30,915
I'm too late!

1070
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:36,684
What kind of material is that?

1071
00:59:36,686 --> 00:59:38,420
Not the normal kind.

1072
00:59:38,422 --> 00:59:41,858
My scanners indicate these bricks
are moving at an incredible speed.

1073
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,124
The kinetic energy
they're putting off

1074
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:45,561
is enough to counteract
any of our powers.

1075
00:59:45,563 --> 00:59:48,130
<i>Right you are, Cybore.</i>

1076
00:59:48,132 --> 00:59:52,235
<i>Those are speed bricks
from the Speed Force Zone.</i>

1077
00:59:52,237 --> 00:59:54,235
Does that sound made-up
to anyone else?

1078
00:59:54,237 --> 00:59:56,237
<i>Enjoy the rest of your days</i>

1079
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:58,907
<i>trapped inside
your little clubhouse.</i>

1080
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:00,642
<i>Oh, one more thing.</i>

1081
01:00:00,644 --> 01:00:03,445
<i>I've activated your Hall of
Justice security systems</i>

1082
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:05,246
<i>and equipped them
with countermeasures</i>

1083
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:07,583
<i>for each of your powers.</i>

1084
01:00:07,585 --> 01:00:11,588
<i>So you might wanna
be careful in there.</i>

1085
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:14,590
<i>Destroy. Destroy.</i>

1086
01:00:14,592 --> 01:00:16,758
Not my cybots!

1087
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,959
You monster.

1088
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:19,528
What do we do?

1089
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,099
Against the most powerful security
system I've ever devised?

1090
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:23,999
We run.

1091
01:00:27,338 --> 01:00:29,704
<i>How could I have bee
so stupid?</i>

1092
01:00:29,706 --> 01:00:33,575
At every step, I've played
into the Reverse-Flash's hand.

1093
01:00:33,577 --> 01:00:34,909
He took away my powers.

1094
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:37,045
He took away my friends.

1095
01:00:37,047 --> 01:00:40,517
Oh, I just
wanna go home.

1096
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,291
It's vibrating, like...

1097
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:51,929
Like they have the Speed Force
inside of them.

1098
01:00:52,496 --> 01:00:53,498
I have a plan.

1099
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:57,800
Not bad.

1100
01:00:57,802 --> 01:00:59,534
Not bad at all.

1101
01:00:59,536 --> 01:01:01,906
Now let's see what
these speed bricks can do.

1102
01:01:02,806 --> 01:01:04,475
Whoa!

1103
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:22,490
All my hard work,

1104
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:24,992
all the trials
and tribulations,

1105
01:01:24,994 --> 01:01:27,463
for nothing.

1106
01:01:27,465 --> 01:01:29,063
Huh?

1107
01:01:31,202 --> 01:01:34,135
The Super-Pets! Huh.

1108
01:01:34,137 --> 01:01:36,137
All this trouble
with Reverse-Flash

1109
01:01:36,139 --> 01:01:39,108
and they're just
digging a hole!

1110
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:40,775
Under the wall.

1111
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:42,778
Of course! Brilliant!

1112
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,483
Hey, guys, wait for me!

1113
01:01:49,586 --> 01:01:51,021
Cyborg's laboratory.

1114
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:53,289
Great job, gang.

1115
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:56,224
Now I can use Cyborg's tools
to repair my shrinking belt

1116
01:01:56,226 --> 01:01:58,293
and return to normal size.

1117
01:01:58,295 --> 01:02:01,463
Hey.

1118
01:02:01,465 --> 01:02:03,231
Well, I've collected
enough data.

1119
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:05,101
You guys
aren't so bad after all.

1120
01:02:05,103 --> 01:02:06,367
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

1121
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:08,306
<i>You must be eliminated.</i>

1122
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:16,612
Fascinating.

1123
01:02:16,614 --> 01:02:18,012
Green Lantern has a pet,

1124
01:02:18,014 --> 01:02:20,349
and he's a ring-wielding
squirrel?

1125
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:22,717
Hey! Who you calling pet,
short stack?

1126
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,985
You can talk?

1127
01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:26,456
Yeah, because
I ain't no squirrel.

1128
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:27,690
Name's B'dg.

1129
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:29,258
I'm from another planet

1130
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:32,961
of people that happen to loosely
resemble your squirrels.

1131
01:02:32,963 --> 01:02:35,898
I see. Well, that
makes perfect sense.

1132
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,333
Oh, I'm so glad
you approve.

1133
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,568
My buddy Ace here
sent down an alert.

1134
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,570
Let me guess,

1135
01:02:41,572 --> 01:02:43,671
the Justice League
is in trouble?

1136
01:02:43,673 --> 01:02:45,039
Bark.

1137
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,342
As per usual.

1138
01:02:46,344 --> 01:02:50,079
Well, let's go
rescue them, again.

1139
01:02:50,081 --> 01:02:51,546
Can someone explain

1140
01:02:51,548 --> 01:02:54,249
how Reverse-Flash
can turn my cybots against us?

1141
01:02:54,251 --> 01:02:56,719
Somehow his speed power's
been supercharged.

1142
01:02:56,721 --> 01:02:59,121
Time to fall back
and form a plan.

1143
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:02,224
By the toenails of Tartarus,
I wish that Flash was here.

1144
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,161
Hey, guys, over here!

1145
01:03:06,163 --> 01:03:09,264
<i>Eliminate. Eliminate.</i>

1146
01:03:09,266 --> 01:03:11,066
Thanks for
the quick save, gang.

1147
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:14,403
I can't hold them off forever.

1148
01:03:14,405 --> 01:03:16,137
We need to find a way
out of here.

1149
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:17,972
And leave this paradise?

1150
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:19,374
Who knew Aquaman's bedroom

1151
01:03:19,376 --> 01:03:21,876
was like the best day spa
in the planet?

1152
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:23,912
Ooh, ha!

1153
01:03:23,914 --> 01:03:26,382
Of course, the king of the sea has a waterbed.

1154
01:03:26,384 --> 01:03:28,349
- Plas!
- Guys?

1155
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:31,720
Hang in there, Superman.
The Super-Pets have a plan.

1156
01:03:31,722 --> 01:03:33,021
Not a pet.

1157
01:03:36,994 --> 01:03:39,628
I believe
they're calling someone.

1158
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:41,095
You speak dog now?

1159
01:03:41,097 --> 01:03:44,268
No, I just understand
my friends.

1160
01:03:49,072 --> 01:03:50,204
A seahorse?

1161
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:52,374
Yet another Super-Pet?

1162
01:03:52,376 --> 01:03:54,342
Again, not a pet.

1163
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:55,644
This is Storm.

1164
01:03:55,646 --> 01:03:57,512
He's fought
alongside Aquaman before,

1165
01:03:57,514 --> 01:04:00,148
so he's always ready
to lend a hand.

1166
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:02,318
Or a fin. Huh?

1167
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,219
Guys?

1168
01:04:04,221 --> 01:04:06,454
Superman, stay super.

1169
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:08,557
Storm, we'll need you
to lead us out to sea

1170
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,793
through the ocean tunnel you came from.

1171
01:04:10,795 --> 01:04:12,862
But first,
we'll need a vehicle.

1172
01:04:12,864 --> 01:04:14,762
How about a sub?

1173
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:18,099
Get it?
A submarine sandwich.

1174
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:20,170
- Sorry...
- That'll work.

1175
01:04:20,838 --> 01:04:22,574
Aw! Not again.

1176
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:34,516
One supersized sub
ready for action.

1177
01:04:34,518 --> 01:04:36,418
- Guys!
- Let's go, Superman.

1178
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,787
Yeah, what's the hold-up?

1179
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:41,657
<i>Eliminate. Eliminate.</i>

1180
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:45,296
<i>Eliminate...
Oh, my, what a lovely room.</i>

1181
01:04:46,163 --> 01:04:49,199
Storm, to the Batcave.

1182
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,670
The <i>Daily Planet,</i>

1183
01:04:55,672 --> 01:05:00,275
soon to be renamed the
<i>Reverse-Flash Planet.</i>

1184
01:05:00,277 --> 01:05:02,043
And the perfect antenna

1185
01:05:02,045 --> 01:05:05,682
<i>to broadcast my manifesto
across the world!</i>

1186
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:08,483
<i>Hello, planet Earth!</i>

1187
01:05:08,485 --> 01:05:13,021
<i>It's me, the most beloved superhero of all time,</i>

1188
01:05:13,023 --> 01:05:14,590
<i>Reverse-Flash.</i>

1189
01:05:14,592 --> 01:05:15,724
Ooh!

1190
01:05:15,726 --> 01:05:18,994
The Reverse-Flash.
I love him.

1191
01:05:18,996 --> 01:05:21,563
<i>Now that
I've rid the world of crime,</i>

1192
01:05:21,565 --> 01:05:25,432
<i>I think it's time for you
to repay old R.F.</i>

1193
01:05:25,434 --> 01:05:27,536
<i>for his kind generosity.</i>

1194
01:05:27,538 --> 01:05:31,305
That's why I'm ordering
everyone to report

1195
01:05:31,307 --> 01:05:33,641
<i>to my Reverse-Flash
command centers.</i>

1196
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:38,045
<i>There, you'll be given orders
on what I, your new ruler,</i>

1197
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:41,215
<i>would like you to do.
Doesn't that sound wonderful?</i>

1198
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:44,987
Cheeky monkey, I always knew he was rotten.

1199
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:46,521
<i>Now hurry!</i>

1200
01:05:46,523 --> 01:05:49,124
<i>You don't want what I did
to the Justice League</i>

1201
01:05:49,126 --> 01:05:53,262
<i>to happen to you.</i>

1202
01:05:53,264 --> 01:05:56,934
With his increased powers, none
of us are any match for him.

1203
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:03,170
Ah! I've been looking everywhere
for you guys. Now listen,

1204
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:05,641
I know you're probably still
mad at me for those pranks,

1205
01:06:05,643 --> 01:06:07,775
but the thing is,
it wasn't me.

1206
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:09,644
It was this cheating,
evil, dirty,

1207
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:12,180
doofus-faced imposter
from the future named...

1208
01:06:12,182 --> 01:06:14,282
Reverse-Flash.

1209
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:16,786
Wait. You knew
he was impersonating me?

1210
01:06:16,788 --> 01:06:20,155
No, we didn't.
Not at first.

1211
01:06:20,157 --> 01:06:21,923
But there were three clues.

1212
01:06:21,925 --> 01:06:24,092
<i>Your mysterious
time loop trouble.</i>

1213
01:06:24,094 --> 01:06:26,695
<i>Your sudden interest
in childish pranks.</i>

1214
01:06:26,697 --> 01:06:30,465
<i>A sudden denial of said pranks
and loss of powers.</i>

1215
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:33,635
Your unusual behavior patterns
led me to believe that somehow,

1216
01:06:33,637 --> 01:06:35,771
some way, someone,
somewhere,

1217
01:06:35,773 --> 01:06:38,541
was framing you
for some unknown purpose.

1218
01:06:38,543 --> 01:06:42,311
So, you fired me to flush out
the Reverse-Flash?

1219
01:06:42,313 --> 01:06:44,278
Exactly.
Batman knew that

1220
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,014
once he accomplished
his evil goals

1221
01:06:46,016 --> 01:06:47,516
<i>he'd reveal himself to you.</i>

1222
01:06:47,518 --> 01:06:49,885
<i>That's why I was
gonna be there when he did.</i>

1223
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:51,586
<i>I shrunk down
onto your shoulder</i>

1224
01:06:51,588 --> 01:06:53,289
<i>and was going to report back
to the League</i>

1225
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:56,057
<i>until Reverse-Flash's shackle
shorted out my circuits,</i>

1226
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:58,726
<i>which kept me
stuck in shrink mode.</i>

1227
01:06:58,728 --> 01:07:01,530
Then that means you guys
never really gave up on me.

1228
01:07:01,532 --> 01:07:03,030
Of course not.

1229
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:04,633
We're superfriends, man.

1230
01:07:04,635 --> 01:07:06,668
We were sorry
to deceive you, Flash.

1231
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,104
It was our only play
to get you out of trouble.

1232
01:07:09,106 --> 01:07:11,438
Thank you, everyone.

1233
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,275
Yeah, yeah,
real heartwarming.

1234
01:07:13,277 --> 01:07:15,945
And now, it's my turn
to get us all out of trouble.

1235
01:07:15,947 --> 01:07:18,479
We can stop the Reverse-Flash
with these.

1236
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:19,949
Speed Force bricks.

1237
01:07:19,951 --> 01:07:21,682
And we can use the bricks
from my speed machine

1238
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:23,385
to superpower
our other vehicles.

1239
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:26,688
Giving us all enough speed
to keep up with Reverse-Flash.

1240
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:29,358
Well, I don't have my speed
powers back yet, Wonder Woman,

1241
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,425
but I have something better.

1242
01:07:31,427 --> 01:07:33,030
I have a plan.

1243
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:37,766
<i>Tell them all, the landmarks
you build today</i>

1244
01:07:37,768 --> 01:07:41,769
<i>will glorify my name tomorrow
and for all eternity.</i>

1245
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:43,472
Look, it's the Justice League!

1246
01:07:43,474 --> 01:07:47,075
History will know the fastest
man alive was always...

1247
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:48,313
Huh?

1248
01:07:58,222 --> 01:07:59,588
Hurray!

1249
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:02,324
Hey, everybody!
We're not retired anymore!

1250
01:08:02,326 --> 01:08:03,892
The Justice League is back.

1251
01:08:03,894 --> 01:08:06,961
- And the Dark Knight returns.
- Bark.

1252
01:08:06,963 --> 01:08:10,099
So you've
escaped the Hall of Justice

1253
01:08:10,101 --> 01:08:13,434
with help from your pets,
no doubt.

1254
01:08:13,436 --> 01:08:16,137
I hope you enjoyed
your freedom,

1255
01:08:16,139 --> 01:08:19,607
because it will be
the last thing you ever see.

1256
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:21,677
Powering on the speed bricks.

1257
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,717
Tickles!

1258
01:08:31,488 --> 01:08:33,254
Whoa! Look at that!

1259
01:08:33,256 --> 01:08:35,757
It looks like
everything just stopped.

1260
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,860
No wonder the Flash
is always moving so fast.

1261
01:08:38,862 --> 01:08:41,830
It must be boring to live
in a world going so slow.

1262
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:43,831
If we'd known
it was like this,

1263
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:45,767
we might have been
more patient with him.

1264
01:08:45,769 --> 01:08:48,269
Lesson learned, team.
Look alive.

1265
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:52,508
Somehow you've gained
the power of the Speed Force.

1266
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:55,943
No matter. I'm still
faster than all of you.

1267
01:08:55,945 --> 01:08:58,448
Evasive maneuvers.
Split up.

1268
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:04,419
You're still no match
for the nexus.

1269
01:09:04,421 --> 01:09:06,620
I can move so fast
I can seem to be

1270
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:08,456
in five different places
at the same time.

1271
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:11,095
And I can take care of all
of you, once and for all!

1272
01:09:16,867 --> 01:09:19,070
- Ready, B'dg?
- You bet.

1273
01:09:23,207 --> 01:09:26,544
<i>My bricks are
returning to the Speed Force Zone!</i>

1274
01:09:27,277 --> 01:09:29,510
No!

1275
01:09:29,512 --> 01:09:30,978
Looks like
the Flash was right.

1276
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,848
The speed bricks
have given our vehicles

1277
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:35,250
the ability
to destroy those statues.

1278
01:09:35,252 --> 01:09:36,621
Go get 'em, gang!

1279
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:49,563
- Target locked.
- Fire!

1280
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:51,202
<i>It's away!</i>

1281
01:10:10,453 --> 01:10:12,821
No!

1282
01:10:12,823 --> 01:10:15,089
I don't know
how you got those speed bricks

1283
01:10:15,091 --> 01:10:16,590
but your plan failed.

1284
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:18,125
I'm powerful enough

1285
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:20,394
to beat the Justice League,
no matter where you are!

1286
01:10:20,396 --> 01:10:21,996
We weren't trying to beat you.

1287
01:10:21,998 --> 01:10:24,066
We were trying
to distract you.

1288
01:10:24,068 --> 01:10:25,203
What?

1289
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:44,018
Impossible. How did you...

1290
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,620
The trials
in the Speed Force Zone

1291
01:10:45,622 --> 01:10:47,289
weren't just there
to see if I was worthy,

1292
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:49,456
they were there
to teach me something.

1293
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:52,428
Something you would have known if you
took the time to go through them.

1294
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:53,794
Enough of this!

1295
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:55,897
I still have enough
of the nexus energy

1296
01:10:55,899 --> 01:10:58,099
to defeat the likes of you.

1297
01:11:12,349 --> 01:11:15,282
So much power!

1298
01:11:15,284 --> 01:11:18,187
Which is rightfully mine!

1299
01:11:18,189 --> 01:11:21,557
You didn't even know what the Speed
Force was until I showed up.

1300
01:11:21,559 --> 01:11:24,960
What makes you think you know
enough about it now to defeat me?

1301
01:11:24,962 --> 01:11:27,461
Only one way to find out.

1302
01:11:28,932 --> 01:11:30,935
You'll never beat me, Flash.

1303
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:35,102
I'm the master
of the Speed Force!

1304
01:11:35,104 --> 01:11:37,371
Really? Wouldn't a master
have a plan

1305
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:39,139
so he doesn't get tripped up?

1306
01:11:40,478 --> 01:11:41,878
<i>Guess not.</i>

1307
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:48,584
You're looking tired. Maybe you should slow down.

1308
01:11:48,586 --> 01:11:50,518
- No!
- Okay.

1309
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,152
What?

1310
01:11:55,426 --> 01:11:57,192
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- Huh?

1311
01:11:57,194 --> 01:11:59,660
Way to be aware of your
surroundings, Speed Force master.

1312
01:11:59,662 --> 01:12:02,397
You may have won today,

1313
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:03,964
but I'll travel back in time

1314
01:12:03,966 --> 01:12:06,136
and stop you
from getting the nexus.

1315
01:12:07,637 --> 01:12:09,236
I don't think you have
enough steam, R.F.

1316
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:11,973
It looks like the last
of the nexus energy is gone.

1317
01:12:11,975 --> 01:12:15,043
Without it,
you're just not fast enough.

1318
01:12:15,045 --> 01:12:18,414
Fast enough?
I'm the fastest man alive!

1319
01:12:18,416 --> 01:12:19,748
I am!

1320
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,018
Prove it.

1321
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:29,023
- Come on, R.F.
- Huh?

1322
01:12:29,025 --> 01:12:32,527
You can go faster than that.

1323
01:12:32,529 --> 01:12:35,132
Really? That's all you've got?

1324
01:12:43,407 --> 01:12:44,609
What?

1325
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:50,611
Handcuffs can't hold me.

1326
01:12:50,613 --> 01:12:52,746
All I have to do is...

1327
01:12:52,748 --> 01:12:55,685
Huh? What?

1328
01:12:56,353 --> 01:12:58,286
My powers.

1329
01:12:58,288 --> 01:13:01,089
Uh-uh-uh. Looks like someone broke
his connection to the Speed Force.

1330
01:13:01,091 --> 01:13:02,391
<i>Tsk, tsk.</i>

1331
01:13:02,393 --> 01:13:04,358
You should have slowed down.

1332
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,695
You! You tricked me!

1333
01:13:07,697 --> 01:13:10,464
No, no.
I just executed my plan.

1334
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:12,166
You won't get away with this!

1335
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:13,602
I'll come back!

1336
01:13:13,604 --> 01:13:16,673
Sorry. I... I can't understand
when you're talking so slow.

1337
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,019
Mummy.

1338
01:13:32,055 --> 01:13:33,554
Well, we won't have
any trouble

1339
01:13:33,556 --> 01:13:35,055
from Reverse-Flash
for a while.

1340
01:13:35,057 --> 01:13:37,759
- What about the nexus thingy?
- What about it?

1341
01:13:37,761 --> 01:13:39,128
With power like that,

1342
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:42,330
you could do
the job of every hero forever.

1343
01:13:42,332 --> 01:13:45,135
Looks like the Justice League
is still retired.

1344
01:13:46,403 --> 01:13:47,669
No.

1345
01:13:47,671 --> 01:13:49,536
No one should have
this much power.

1346
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:04,186
You...

1347
01:14:04,188 --> 01:14:06,289
You gave up all that speed.

1348
01:14:06,689 --> 01:14:07,955
But why?

1349
01:14:07,957 --> 01:14:10,157
Well, it turns out
that slowing down

1350
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,259
was the best way
to defeat Reverse-Flash.

1351
01:14:12,261 --> 01:14:14,830
The nexus power had him
so distracted,

1352
01:14:14,832 --> 01:14:17,232
he was totally unaware
of his surroundings.

1353
01:14:17,234 --> 01:14:19,268
No way would I ever
let that happen to me.

1354
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:22,771
Returning the nexus was
always a part of my... plan,

1355
01:14:22,773 --> 01:14:26,844
and these were all the things you
guys were trying to teach me.

1356
01:14:27,444 --> 01:14:29,277
Thank you.

1357
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:31,979
Without friends like you, I would
have lost my powers forever.

1358
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:34,383
And we would have been
retired forever.

1359
01:14:34,385 --> 01:14:35,584
That reminds me,

1360
01:14:35,586 --> 01:14:37,652
is there a Justice League
pension plan or...

1361
01:14:37,654 --> 01:14:39,853
It's good
to have you back, Flash.

1362
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:42,156
And with newfound wisdom
to guide you.

1363
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:44,459
That may be true,
Wonder Woman,

1364
01:14:44,461 --> 01:14:45,928
but Flash has only proven

1365
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:48,095
he's ready for the next
level of training.

1366
01:14:48,097 --> 01:14:49,897
Now begins the true test

1367
01:14:49,899 --> 01:14:52,867
of Flash's mental acuity
and fortitude.

1368
01:14:52,869 --> 01:14:54,969
The training crucible
I have prepared

1369
01:14:54,971 --> 01:14:56,771
will destroy hidden weakness

1370
01:14:56,773 --> 01:14:59,574
and forge the inner strength required to...

1371
01:14:59,576 --> 01:15:01,175
Hmm. It sounds great, Batman.

1372
01:15:01,177 --> 01:15:02,878
Let's get started on that.

1373
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,379
Right after a little snack.

1374
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:08,916
The nexus has been
returned to the Speed Force.

1375
01:15:08,918 --> 01:15:12,452
And order has been restored
to the universe.

1376
01:15:12,454 --> 01:15:14,155
And all it took was...

1377
01:15:14,157 --> 01:15:17,157
<i>♪ Magic, baby
It's just a little magic ♪</i>

1378
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:19,497
- Zatanna.
- Yrros.

1379
