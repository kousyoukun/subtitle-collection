1
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:07,083
- Move!
- Thank you, sir.

2
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:25,536
It could be tough to replace.

3
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:28,649
Yeah, go and jet
the vent tube.

4
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,855
You ain'’t worth shit.

5
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:58,569
Yeah, i'’m talking to you.

6
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,444
You better run.
I said run!

7
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,978
Everything okay over there?

8
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,374
You the transfer?

9
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,464
Lieutenant Tom hudner.

10
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,347
Jesse brown.

11
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,220
It'’s good to meet you.

12
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,097
Where'’d you come in from? Pearl harbor.

13
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:51,187
Flying bearcats? Skyraiders.

14
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:54,016
Lot of profile flights.
Tracking torpedoes.

15
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:56,279
Post-war busywork.

16
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,543
You, uh...
You fly in the big show?

17
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:03,678
I did not.

18
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:08,030
Then you'’ll fit right in.

19
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:12,750
What are you
talking about?

20
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:15,013
- You should be grateful
your room has seen action.
- Morning, Jesse.

21
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:16,168
Good morning, Jess.

22
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:17,450
You'’re the one with
clean sheets.

23
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,694
Hey!
You must be the new guy.

24
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,173
Marty goode, with an "e."

25
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,175
You mean "g"?"E" at the end.

26
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,545
Oh, Jesus!
Don'’t tell me you'’re one
of these country boys.

27
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,155
All right, Marty.
Watch yourself.

28
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,355
Bo lavery.

29
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:29,791
And this is Jerry,

30
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:32,097
or kraut, Fritz, heine.

31
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,707
- They all work.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:35,802
Nice to meet you.
And regardless
of what you hear,

33
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:36,928
the name'’s Carol mohring.

34
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,278
Pleasure to meet you.

35
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:39,772
Now, there'’s a sight.

36
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:43,283
Good to see you, bill. Good to see you.

37
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,372
Gents, this is Tom hudner.

38
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:47,852
We were in pensacola together.
Hell of a stick.

39
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:49,463
Hell of a pretty face, too.

40
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:50,942
Almost too pretty.

41
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:53,205
You boys sound lonely.

42
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,511
Welcome to vf-32.

43
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:58,404
Will the atom shatter a world
to fragments,

44
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,909
or will it be a boon to mankind?

45
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,477
Stalin and the Soviets
field-tested their own bomb,

46
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:07,176
and wouldn'’t you know it,
it'’s the same design as ours.

47
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,893
I'’d say that they'’re
hot on our heels,

48
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,658
but this footage is
already six months old.

49
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,113
It won'’t be long before
they strap that thing
to a bomber.

50
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,422
Bo, get that for me, would you?

51
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,623
So, now you know.

52
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,235
Fellas, you'’re not just here
to fly and screw.

53
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,020
'’cause they'’re not
sitting idle.

54
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:27,370
But with practice,
there is not a pilot
on this planet

55
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,633
who can wipe the ass
of a United States
naval aviator

56
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:30,939
and I truly believe that.

57
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,941
That'’s right!

58
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,203
So, nav hops...

59
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,248
Koenig, you got mohring.

60
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,251
Lavery, you got goode.

61
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,905
- Ensign brown!
- Sir.

62
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,907
You'’ve got
lieutenant hudner today.

63
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,346
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:49,610
Have fun.

65
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,584
Matt, you take Calloway.

66
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,284
All right,
maps out, lights on, let'’s go.

67
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:55,156
- See if you can keep up.
- Let'’s go.

68
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,180
- Whoo-hoo!
-All right, bill.
You ready?

69
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,988
'’cause if you bring
that girl around,
you'’re gonna have a problem.

70
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:04,146
Shit. She'’ll be sitting
in my lap. What are you
talking about?

71
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,018
That'’s all i'’m saying.

72
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:08,542
Pretty warm out for a wool cap.

73
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:14,504
It'’s part of my kit.
Never know when
you'’ll need it.

74
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,550
Personnel, stand clear.

75
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:19,770
I'’ll try to keep us
short of Canada, lieutenant.

76
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,662
Watch your prop.

77
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,142
Try not to cut off my wing.

78
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:34,236
We'’re taking a slight detour
on the way home.

79
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,194
- Try to keep up.
- Say again?

80
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:28,053
What the hell are you doing,
ensign brown?

81
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,931
You still with me?

82
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,591
Up and hard on my call.

83
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,740
Ready, set, hit it!

84
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,507
Any detours you wanna make?

85
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,643
Pretty slick flying
for a nav hop.

86
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,994
Helps to know the plane.

87
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:08,932
Can'’t learn everything
from a book.

88
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,748
Or at the academy.

89
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:26,626
Well, there'’s knowing
the plane and then
there'’s flat-hatting.

90
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,600
What are you gonna find out
about your wingman

91
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,760
cruising at 10,000 feet,
lieutenant?

92
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,463
Put him in a little bit
of trouble, who knows,

93
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,422
you might get a peek at
who he really is.

94
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:45,122
How '’bout I buy you a beer?

95
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,473
Plenty to talk about
between who I am

96
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,172
and not getting each other
killed on nav hops.

97
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:53,261
Sounds nice, lieutenant,

98
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:54,610
but I Don'’t drink.

99
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,183
Did you get to see
the lighthouse?

100
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,140
I did.

101
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:07,362

- This looks delicious.
- Bon appétit, boys.

Thank you, dad.

Give me
one of them napkins.

111

So, the gulfstream'’s
all right.

112
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,077
Tends to be a little busy.

113
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,252
Lot of locals,

114
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:29,514
but a lot of college girls

115
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,212
who like to go out
on school nights.

116
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:33,170
Sadao'’s is good on Thursdays.

117
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:36,043
Dimber'’s is the move to make
on Saturdays and sundays,

118
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:37,784
if you Don'’t mind the cover.

119
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,655
Just think of that as
an investment though.

120
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:40,830
Trust me.

121
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,224
But, I gotta warn ya,

122
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:46,401
no matter where you go,
it is rough these days.

123
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:50,622
All right,
girls around here do not go
for participation medals.

124
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:54,017
Despite what they say,
they are looking
for that war tin.

125
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:55,889
That hero tin.

126
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,501
And here, that'’s only cevoli.

127
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,156
Got a Navy cross
and he'’s got a wife.

128
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,592
Might be connected.

129
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:06,682
Wait, you ain'’t married,
are you?

130
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:10,077
No. I'’ll start with the Navy,
figure out the rest later.

131
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,339
Smart man.

132
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:14,603
How'’d you come in?

133
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,657
Applied to the academy
right after Pearl harbor.

134
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,041
I wanted to help.

135
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:19,869
As we all did.

136
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:23,960
But yeah, show up
to find the heroes are made,

137
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:26,136
the fleets mothballed.

138
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,834
Mm-hmm.

139
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,882
War ended a month
before I graduated.

140
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:40,020
You know, I suppose we were
born a few years too late.

141
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,195
Or too early.

142
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,893
The whole world'’s
looking different.

143
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,351
Hell, did you ever think
that you'’d be in a squadron

144
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,985
with a colored aviator?

145
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:56,558
Well, I didn'’t come here
to not eat.

146
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,867
Cheers to that.
All right.

147
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:02,869

She looked like a nice woman.

162
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:38,834
Someone can look nice?

163
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,009
Didn'’t I?

164
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,011
I thought you looked like

165
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:43,883
a mean old hen.

166
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:45,058
Oh!

167
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:50,846
Daisy? mm-hmm?

168
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,370
Oh!

169
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:55,372
Oh!

170
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:57,417
Come on.

171
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,461
Whoo!

172
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,029
That'’s cheap.

173
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:01,857
Strength in numbers,
darling.Mm-hmm.

174
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:04,270
- You gonna paint your baby?
- I'’ma paint one of my babies.

175
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,294
Nah. Come on, come on!

176
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:07,471
Come on.

177
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,215
Incoming!

178
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,915
Well, I know a pilot
can'’t fly at night.

179
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:17,699
Wonder where
she got that from.

180
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:19,962
Where they go?

181
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,138
Where they go?

182
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,377
Where they... there!

183
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,403
Ah! It'’s us. Okay, okay.

184
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:28,405
We surrender.

185
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:32,061
Well,
it was well fought, soldier,
but sadly, you were no match.

186
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,123
Officers.

187
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,342
Awfully loud in here.

188
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:53,953
Neighbors made
a noise complaint.

189
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,220
Must'’ve been
the nice-looking one.

190
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,530
♪ what i'’ve been told ♪

191
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:09,577
♪ I Don'’t know
what i'’ve been told ♪

192
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,840
♪ Navy wings are painted gold ♪

193
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,671
I need
two wing walkers
for a respot.

194
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:23,025
All yellow shirts on
fod walk down.

195
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,766
Morning, boys!

196
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,726
Seems one of
our reconnaissance planes

197
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,989
went down over the baltic
a few days ago.

198
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,252
Now,
what you won'’t see
here in the newspaper

199
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,297
is the photos the Pentagon has

200
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:37,257
of Navy flight uniforms
washed up on the shore

201
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,215
and the landing gear,

202
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:41,565
which is absolutely
riddled with bullets.

203
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:45,308
That is more than
a quiet act of aggression.

204
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:48,094
Washington wants us ready
to respond to the Russians

205
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:50,835
and, uh, this is what
we'’re gonna get ready with.

206
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,447
Say hello
to the f4u corsair.

207
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:56,406
Flew the hog
a little after the war.

208
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,626
But the Navy'’s gone
and made '’em fatter
and meaner.

209
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,387
Now, I know that the corsair
will be new for a lot of you,
but Don'’t worry.

210
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,935
Just like yours truly,
she earned her stripes
in the big show.

211
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,155
Now, this is a plane that will
get your hands dirty.

212
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,375
You'’re gonna be
so close to the action,

213
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,918
you'’re gonna start to think
that you made the mistake
of joining the army.

214
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:14,294
And I gotta mention,
she'’s got a rather
unfortunate nickname.

215
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:15,468
"The widow-maker."

216
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:17,165
Good thing I ain'’t hitched.

217
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,777
Well, they also call her
the "ensign eliminator."

218
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:22,954
This engine'’s one of
the most powerful things
you'’ll ever fly behind.

219
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:25,087
You throttle her too hard,
she'’ll spin you over.

220
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:28,569
She'’s got enough torque
to flip a house,
so go easy on the power.

221
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:30,962
Cag wants us
up to speed and fast.

222
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:34,227
So, manuals are
getting dropped off
in the ready room.

223
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:36,403
Any other questions,

224
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:39,536
god help ya,
take '’em up with the good
professor koenig here.

225
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:42,017
All right.

226
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,474
- Oh, she looks pretty mean, huh?
- - The "widow-maker."

227
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:45,977
Oh! She is a beaut!

228
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:48,272
- Hey, professor k?
- She'’s awful purdy.

229
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:50,968
Now, Bo, you Don'’t know what
you'’re doing with this thing.

230
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:15,833
Need a lift?

231
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,412
Guys said you had family nearby?

232
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,591
Across the bay in fall river.

233
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:39,944
They must be happy,
having you back.

234
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,252
I think they'’d be happier
if I were coming back
to work for the family.

235
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,300
Supposed to take over
my old man'’s grocery stores.

236
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:50,868
But I was called to adventure.

237
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,001
What about you?

238
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,264
What brought you here?

239
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:56,961
Always wanted to fly.

240
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,312
Wanted to fly where
the best pilots flew.

241
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:01,183
That'’d be the Navy.

242
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,539
- Thanks for the lift.
- Of course.

243
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,587
Ma'’am. Tom hudner.

244
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,502
Daisy.

245
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,246
Can I get you
something to drink?

246
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,424
I'’m sure lieutenant hudner
has plans.

247
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:28,471
Better be getting back, ma'’am.

248
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,648
Beautiful house, by the way.

249
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:33,302
Nice to see it from the ground.

250
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:36,218
Thank you.

251
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,008
Play nice. What?

252
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:45,967
Play nice.

253
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:49,231
I Don'’t know about him yet.

254
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,321
Where'’s our car?

255
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,062
Where'’s our baby?

256
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,237
Sleeping.

257
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,066
Car'’s on the side of the road.

258
00:19:58,762 --> 00:19:59,762
Abandoned.

259
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:00,894
Okay.

260
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,262
Tires are probably gone.

261
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:04,768
Hey, airmen!

262
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,163
My tail fin could use some air.

263
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:12,820
Stand by for check time.

264
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,822
Stand by for check time.

265
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:15,996
Hey, lieutenant!

266
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,086
I think she likes me.

267
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,827
Famous last words.

268
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,442
She'’s not gonna bite.

269
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:39,525
You know
what'’s not in the manual?

270
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:41,544
How big this damn nose is.

271
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:46,090
How the hell are you
supposed to land on a carrier
if you can'’t see it?

272
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:49,335
Not everything'’s
in the same place, Carol,
but everything'’s the same.

273
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,338
Just in different places.

274
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:55,036
Hey.
You know I crashed a bearcat
when I was learning to fly it?

275
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,386
You know, you better not
let goode hear you say that.

276
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,779
Too late.

277
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:26,633
Many outstanding
fighter pilot achievements

278
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,896
may seem almost unbelievable.

279
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:36,860
But once you have learned
how they accomplished
these victories,

280
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:39,123
and the system they used,

281
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,648
you'’ll realize it'’s just
a trick of the trade

282
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:45,652
carried out by fighting men
with the ability and know-how

283
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:48,002
that it takes to win
aerial battles.

284
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:18,815
The keynote of fighter tactics
in the United States Navy
today is teamwork.

285
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:25,474
Teamwork, coordination,
cooperation,
call it what you will,

286
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:27,607
gives the fighter
its greatest value

287
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:30,479
in escorting bombers
and torpedo planes
on their missions.

288
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,440
In enabling fighters
to protect other fighters,

289
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:39,009
in winning engagements
that may mean the losing
or the saving of a carrier.

290
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,713
You have to fight them
with your head,

291
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:47,975
using your judgment,

292
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,282
your skill in plane-handling,

293
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:55,069
and your superior gunnery
to turn the odds
in your favor.

294
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,637
It'’s a matter of life insurance

295
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:00,030
to make every
split-second count.

296
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,820
Attention on deck.

297
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:10,780
As you were, gentlemen.
As you were.

298
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,957
I'’m captain Thomas sisson,

299
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:15,916
and I command the USS Leyte.

300
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,309
Now, we have learned
that the Soviets are jockeying

301
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:20,399
for a warm water port
in the mediterranean.

302
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,613
Now, they think they can
bully their way into Europe

303
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:25,012
and spook our new NATO allies.

304
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:28,363
Well, DC thinks it'’s best
if we prevent them
from doing so.

305
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:31,714
And we are crewing up
to keep the cold war
from turning hot,

306
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:34,369
and cevoli here tells me
this is the best place
to do so.

307
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:36,458
We ship out next week.

308
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,112
Look forward to
having you onboard.

309
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:45,598
All right, all right.

310
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,794
You remember when I told you
to get up to speed, and fast?

311
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:52,474
I meant speedier and faster.

312
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,476
Carrier quals are at
the end of the week.

313
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,478
You can'’t land a corsair
on the Leyte,

314
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,654
uh, you get yourself
a nice dry-land job in Topeka

315
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,917
or some place even shittier,
god help you.

316
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:02,658
Either way,

317
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:05,444
start settling up
your bar tab, boys.

318
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,837
We are leaving Rhode Island.

319
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,057
Ah, here it comes.

320
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:19,806
Just because i'’m going
doesn'’t mean i'’m fighting,
Daisy.

321
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:30,686
That'’s the deal, darling.

322
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:32,993
Remember?

323
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,607
We knew this day might come.

324
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,742
And yet it doesn'’t
make it any easier.

325
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,145
But we'’ll be okay.

326
00:24:58,975 --> 00:24:59,975
Mad...

327
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:03,719
but okay.

328
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:05,329
Okay.

329
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:14,861
Jesse, what'’s going on?

330
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:16,645
Honestly...

331
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:23,870
My mind'’s on landing
that corsair tomorrow.

332
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,657
You never met a plane
you couldn'’t land, Jesse.

333
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:32,139
This plane
will be the death of me.

334
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,533
I can'’t see like I can
out of a bearcat.

335
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:38,972
Fogs my instincts.

336
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:44,847
Your instincts...

337
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,199
Are one of the few things
in this world that I trust.

338
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:52,942
And if you can'’t
trust that plane,

339
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:55,162
you gotta put it in whatever
will get you down safe.

340
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,574
Yes, ma'’am.

341
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,076
- You ready, Carol?
- Try and keep up, Marty.

342
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
Bottom of the board
buys drinks tonight, boys.

343
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:23,712
I hope you brought cash.

344
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:25,516
Won'’t need it,
we'’ll be spending yours.

345
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,505
You ain'’t shit.

346
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,911
You ain'’t never landing
that plane, nigger.

347
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:39,614
Boy.

348
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:50,059
Your monkey-ass
shouldn'’t even be flying.

349
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:10,400
Flight ops commence,
flight ops commence.

350
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:13,708
Be aware of all prop wash.
All hands on deck.

351
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,122
Don'’t need all hands.

352
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,103
Doing it!

353
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:19,298
All repair parties,
man your stations.

354
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:21,455
All repair parties,
man your stations.

355
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,430
- That'’s hudner.
- Mm-hmm.

356
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:50,310
You'’re on a good approach, hudner.
 Just keep an eye on the lso.

357
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:16,815
All right, pretty boy.

358
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:35,877
All right, three-to-one
he misses it.

359
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,096
I'’ll take the action.

360
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,315
Bonus if he splashes?

361
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:41,535
Christ, Bo,
we Don'’t want him dead.

362
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,554
Looks like they wanna see
Jackie Robinson steal home.

363
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,174
Ensign brown, you'’re too high.

364
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:14,611
That'’s a shit approach.

365
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:32,194
Come on. Get your nose up.

366
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:36,720
Why isn'’t he listening
to the lso?

367
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:50,821
Geez!

368
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,805
That was pretty close, brown.
Do you wanna call it?

369
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,440
I'’m coming back around.

370
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,532
Crash crew, stand by.

371
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:17,805
You'’re still too high, brown.

372
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:27,815
You'’re not in the groove.

373
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:29,425
I'’ll get there.

374
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:12,860
All right, Jesse.

375
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,036
Attaboy!

376
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,386
Attention, all hands.

377
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,606
Flight operations
commence in one hour.

378
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,044
Fod walk in 15 Mikes.
All available hands on deck.

379
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:25,351
Fod walk in 15 Mikes.

380
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:28,441
Doesn'’t matter how you did it.
Just matters that
you got down, pal.

381
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:31,096
Fellas,

382
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:33,533
you all passed
your carrier quals.

383
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,381
That'’s what
i'’m talking about.

384
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,016
Top marks go to... Yeah.

385
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,409
Lieutenant hudner
with the only
perfect grade.

386
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,671
Oh, bastard.

387
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:43,717
Which brings us to ensign brown.

388
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:46,633
D-n-k-u-a!

389
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:49,331
Damn near killed us all.

390
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:52,726
Enjoy tonight, boys.
We ship out in the morning.

391
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,945
And now is the time,
if you haven'’t already,

392
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,382
get all your affairs in order.

393
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:58,949
All right.

394
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:04,055
What affairs
do you have to get in order,
my friend?

395
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:06,784
I'’m headed
to Denver, boys.

396
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:08,958
That was some landing.

397
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:11,701
I'’m never
too drunk to drive.

398
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,572
Just trying to
keep it interesting.

399
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:18,317
You get your car fixed yet?

400
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:27,108
You heading to the bar
with the guys?

401
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:28,978
I Don'’t think so.

402
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:35,768
Wanna come in?

403
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:51,784
Hey, Daisy?

404
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:53,525
Yes?

405
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,144
What did I tell you?

406
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:08,018
Yes, ma'’am.

407
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,369
Mommy?

408
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:11,543
Oh.

409
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:13,546
Let me get her.Okay.

410
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,899
Nice to see you again. You as well.

411
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:29,170
Which one do you like?

412
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,391
The blue one?

413
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,480
The gray one?

414
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:38,092
The gray one.

415
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,922
You had a good day? Mm-hmm.

416
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:43,445
Yeah? uh-huh.

417
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:44,620
What'’d you do?

418
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,536
You Don'’t remember?

419
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,711
Here you are.

420
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:51,845
Thought Jesse didn'’t drink.

421
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,063
He doesn'’t.

422
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,071
Your husband'’s
quite the aviator.

423
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,204
Well, he must feel
the same way about you.

424
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:04,538
Because you and Carol mohring

425
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:06,164
are the only boys
from fighting 32

426
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:07,817
that he has ever invited over.

427
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:10,907
It'’s good to know the men
you'’re flying with.

428
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,388
See what they'’re fighting for.

429
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:15,738
I like that.

430
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:21,266
And what about you, Tom?
What are you fighting for?

431
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,138
God, country and honor aside.

432
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:25,705
You know, Mrs. Brown, i'’m...

433
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:28,186
Hoping to find that out.

434
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:30,971
Come on.

435
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:33,713
- Come on.
- Okay.

436
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:36,672
Don'’t be fooled
by his strong,
silent act, by the way.

437
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:37,891
He trusts you,

438
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:41,416
I swear,
he'’s the funniest man
you'’ll ever know.

439
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:45,551
I can'’t say he'’s shown me
that side yet.Mm-hmm.

440
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:48,293
Something to
look forward to.

441
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:51,209
Well, you'’re about to spend
a lot of time together.

442
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,776
Lot of time
in very small spaces.

443
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,003
May I ask you a favor?

444
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:05,223
Of course.

445
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:10,228
Second he steps on that ship
and into that plane,

446
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:12,969
I can'’t protect him anymore.

447
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:15,102
So I need you to be there
for my Jesse.

448
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:17,409
Okay?

449
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:21,935
Okay.

450
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:24,938
Okay.

451
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:26,156
Good?

452
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,116
- Hmm.
- That was good, yeah?

453
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,378
Uh-huh.mm-hmm.

454
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:33,163
Who is this?

455
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,819
This is Pam.

456
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:39,648
Hi, Pam.

457
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:49,025
I Don'’t think
she wants to embarrass
you, lieutenant.

458
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,791
It'’s too late. Come on.

459
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,229
She might hold the stick
better than you.Okay.

460
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,972
Well, I know
it'’s our last night here,

461
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:02,018
so i'’ll let you all
enjoy it together.
Thank you again for the drink.

462
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:04,238
You'’re very welcome. I'’ll walk ya out.

463
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:26,739
Just be careful.

464
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,873
Worst thing
that can happen to me
is a bad sunburn.

465
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,702
You come back as black
as you like,
as long as you come home.

466
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,944
'’cause you'’re taking me
to The Bahamas
when you get back.

467
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:40,056
Bahamas?

468
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,623
If I get some shore time,

469
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:44,670
i'’ll get you one of
those European swimsuits.

470
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,282
One of those two-piece things.

471
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:01,469
Tootie...

472
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:06,169
You know you can always
come back here and wave to me.

473
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:12,785
I'’m only 5,000 miles
that way.

474
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:18,094
I'’ll wave back.Mm-hmm.

475
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,709
The only person I ever met

476
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,799
belonged in the sky.

477
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,501
Just remember you belong
down here with us, too, okay?

478
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,522
I'’ll write you
every week.Mm-hmm.

479
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,351
I know you will.

480
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,372
Break those
chains down.

481
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,919
Secure from general quarters.
All hands!

482
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,660
Secure from general quarters.

483
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:35,667
Maybe you'’d be faster
if we did this in the middle
of the night.

484
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,161
What you Don'’t
seem to understand

485
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:39,235
is that someday soon,
this is gonna be real.

486
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,629
And you have to do
a hell of a lot better
than that!

487
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,762
Yes, sir.

488
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:46,329
All right.

489
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,244
I gotta
run him down to 2-a.

490
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:50,377
I am getting tired
of getting ready.

491
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,597
Tired of living in this
floating sardine can.

492
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:54,250
Tired of you smelling like one.

493
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:55,687
That'’s what men smell like.

494
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,645
Something to look forward to
one day, Fritz.

495
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,386
Most excitement
we'’ve seen in days.

496
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,996
Ensign brown.

497
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,434
Could I speak to you
for a moment?

498
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:06,524
Careful what you wish for.

499
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:08,351
I'’ll go ahead
and respot it.

500
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:11,572
Aye, sir.

501
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:13,487
Huh.

502
00:42:25,368 --> 00:42:27,196
Do we have to do this
above deck?

503
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,982
Oh, yeah.
It'’s great having you
right in front of your plane.

504
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:31,157
Relax.
You look great.

505
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:33,072
What'’s going on?

506
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,161
Lifemagazine is here.

507
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:38,009
I guess the Pentagon wanted
something positive for
the folks back home.

508
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:41,384
Help '’em swallow the pill
of another potential war.

509
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,996
What better way than,
"black man makes good?"

510
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,781
He does makes
a nice trophy boy.
You ought to be proud, skip.

511
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,698
Shut up, Bo.

512
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:54,272
Your commanding
officer called you one of the
best pilots he'’s ever seen,

513
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:55,790
regardless of color.

514
00:42:55,964 --> 00:42:57,749
Flight checks and fod walks

515
00:42:57,923 --> 00:43:00,003
for fixed-wing
and rotary aircraft
must be documented.

516
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,364
That'’s kind of him to say,
but I can'’t say i'’m special.

517
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:06,801
Well, it must be hard, right?

518
00:43:06,975 --> 00:43:08,295
It must be hard being the only...

519
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:11,023
A naval aviator? Absolutely.

520
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:13,765
Landing planes on carriers,
it'’s the...

521
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:16,594
It'’s the toughest job there is
for anyone wearing wings.

522
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,295
Heavy maintenance visit

523
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:24,210
will be performed
in all aircraft...

524
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:26,449
Come on, ensign brown.
You know what I mean. Jesse'’s fine.

525
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:27,996
Okay, Jesse.

526
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,105
There'’s a lot of guys
from different backgrounds,

527
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:31,478
but there'’s only one you.

528
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:33,292
There'’s only
one you, too, sir.

529
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,439
Look, I mean no disrespect,

530
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,704
but I Don'’t think i'’m gonna say
what you'’re looking
for me to say.

531
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,358
All right.

532
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:43,814
I worked hard
to fly these planes.

533
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:45,231
It'’s all i'’ve ever wanted to do.

534
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:47,205
Harder than I can
put into words. Jesse.

535
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,496
Can we get
a few more pictures
of Jesse in his plane?

536
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,030
I gotta get my pilots
back to work.

537
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:52,717
It'’ll just take
a minute, lieutenant.

538
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:54,675
Lieutenant commander.
Have a nice day.

539
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,068
Watch your back!

540
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,375
Damn, Jesse. You just put
a letter in the mail.

541
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:01,421
One a week.

542
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:02,988
That'’s what I told her.

543
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:04,879
It'’s no use trying
to slow him down.

544
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:09,037
Hey, we caught
your little circus act
up on deck.

545
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:12,171
Your boy juggle, too?
Or...

546
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:46,074
Guess not.

547
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:50,775
Well. Nice.

548
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,693
We should have
stood up to
that asshole.

549
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:58,478
I'’m good, Tom.

550
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:09,228
Look, i'’m just saying
we shouldn'’t be letting
him run his mouth like that.

551
00:45:44,654 --> 00:45:46,935
Now, I know
that you'’re all sick
of doing busywork,

552
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:50,182
but, oh, have I
got a chore for
a lucky someone.

553
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:51,923
Not it. Maintenance has replaced

554
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:53,533
a gyro on one of the corsairs,

555
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:55,547
I need a volunteer to
make sure all is working.

556
00:45:55,622 --> 00:45:57,513
It'’s just a quick
up and down. I thought you said "lucky."

557
00:45:57,537 --> 00:45:59,060
It sounds like a hoot.

558
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:00,627
Why Don'’t we give it to Fritz?

559
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:02,890
He could use the landing.

560
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:05,066
I'’ll do it.

561
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:06,807
All right.

562
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:09,114
Actually,

563
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:10,528
if you Don'’t mind, lieutenant,

564
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,118
lavery'’s right for once.

565
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:14,075
'’course i'’m right.

566
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:15,773
I could use the trap.

567
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:17,862
All yours.

568
00:46:18,036 --> 00:46:19,211
Heil herr mohring!

569
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:21,082
Mohring it is. all right.

570
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:23,650
All right, now as for
the rest of you,

571
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,347
command has ordered an audit

572
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:28,350
on serial numbers
on parts across
all of the planes.

573
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:30,657
So while mohring is
up there enjoying
the sightseeing,

574
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:34,139
the rest of you can
validate all of
the serial numbers

575
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:36,532
on every single one of
these maintenance orders.

576
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:39,144
Thank you, Matthew.

577
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:40,798
Yeah. uh, sir?

578
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,364
That'’ll take all day.

579
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:44,062
Only if you work quick.

580
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,930
Ensign mohring,

581
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:06,345
you are clear to test the gyro.

582
00:47:29,107 --> 00:47:30,673
2-17 to tower.

583
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,327
Gyro seems to be
in working order.

584
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:34,261
Copy that.
Return to carrier.

585
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,085
Ensign mohring,
your approach is shallow.

586
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:53,261
I'’m correcting.

587
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,699
Manufacture number?

588
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:02,662
"P-5-5-1-8-4."

589
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:08,886
What is it?

590
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:21,089
Not gonna make the deck.

591
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:22,247
He'’ll make it.

592
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:23,821
Just gotta slowly
pour on the power.

593
00:48:23,988 --> 00:48:25,337
On this approach?

594
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,819
Better to wave off.

595
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:31,909
Try again.

596
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:34,563
Crash crew, stand by.

597
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:35,956
Crash crew, stand by.

598
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:37,305
Man your station.

599
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:42,528
Out of the way.
Coming in.

600
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:49,535
You'’re still low, mohring.

601
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,371
Go around, pal.

602
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:02,243
Ease it on, mohring.

603
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:09,194
Ensign mohring,
give me some altitude.

604
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,210
No, no, no, no, no!

605
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:16,217
he'’s in the water.

606
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:18,428
Man overboard! get your vest pack!

607
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:19,521
We need rescue!

608
00:49:19,695 --> 00:49:21,349
Poured on the power
too damn fast.

609
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:31,794
Let'’s go, let'’s go!

610
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:33,971
Do we pull him out?

611
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:59,300
Some people are gonna
tell you that this is
what you signed up for.

612
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:01,607
It'’s not.

613
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:04,566
Let'’s be real clear.

614
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:06,960
We lost a friend.

615
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:08,353
And that is not easy.

616
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:09,919
Now,

617
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:12,879
the Navy'’s gonna do
what the Navy does.

618
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:14,575
But, um...

619
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:16,056
I'’ll write his family.

620
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,980
Send them his things.

621
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:49,872
The guys are getting together.

622
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:09,477
Just because you think
you know better

623
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:11,459
doesn'’t mean you
have to say anything.

624
00:51:13,853 --> 00:51:15,985
What are you talking about?

625
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,162
Carol hadn'’t been
in the water
five seconds

626
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:20,656
before you were
talking about what
he could'’ve done better.

627
00:51:20,686 --> 00:51:22,726
We all make mistakes.
That could'’ve been me,
that...

628
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:28,563
Don'’t let that ring
convince you otherwise.

629
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,777
What'’s the one thing
they told us about
the corsair?

630
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,674
Remind me.
What'’d they tell us
about the corsair?

631
00:51:32,698 --> 00:51:34,003
You can'’t punch the throttle.

632
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:36,136
Mistakes get us killed, Jesse.

633
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:41,924
You Don'’t die
if you do
what you'’re told.

634
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:44,840
Fellas.

635
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,409
You coming?

636
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,378
To Carol.

637
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:39,634
We'’re not even at war,
and we'’re losing men.

638
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:42,115
Good men.

639
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:46,656
It'’s just a
tough pill to swallow

640
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:48,165
when there'’s nothing to blame.

641
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:56,260
The swim test
in flight school...

642
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:05,225
They made me do it ten times.

643
00:53:11,927 --> 00:53:14,234
Didn'’t believe that
a nigger could swim.

644
00:53:16,628 --> 00:53:18,282
They dumped ice in the water.

645
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,461
Put weights in my flight suit.

646
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,379
Held me under.

647
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:35,299
They wouldn'’t have cared
if I died in that pool.

648
00:53:38,476 --> 00:53:39,955
But every time...

649
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:43,655
I made it out.

650
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:58,452
Got used to flying
the bearcat.

651
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:01,890
See everything.

652
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:04,066
The deck on approach.

653
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:07,461
All right
in front of me.

654
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:10,334
I could land it on
my front yard if I had to.

655
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,080
But the corsair...

656
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,350
I can'’t see anything.

657
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:31,006
You have to rely on the lso.

658
00:54:32,051 --> 00:54:33,451
Hard to believe
that the lso

659
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:35,968
won'’t crash my black ass
on purpose.

660
00:54:40,668 --> 00:54:41,948
I can'’t tell you how many times

661
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:43,715
people have told me
to give up, quit.

662
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,021
Die, even.

663
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:51,679
That'’s why you can'’t always
do what you'’re told.

664
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:57,598
If I did, I wouldn'’t be here.

665
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:08,305
That'’s something
I was trying to teach mohring.

666
00:55:42,469 --> 00:55:43,601
You guys are tired.

667
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:45,907
I see it. Hell, I am, too.

668
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:47,431
Been a rough few weeks.

669
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:51,217
Fortunately,
we are docking in cannes

670
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:52,958
for a little shore leave.

671
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:54,742
Now, I Don'’t know about you,

672
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:56,720
but I think
some fresh air would
do all of us some good.

673
00:55:56,744 --> 00:55:59,356
Obviously, ship rules
follow you ashore.

674
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,227
Liberty expires at 2300.

675
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:04,186
You are foreigners
in a foreign city,
and you look the part.

676
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,450
So please, Marty,
please, dear god,

677
00:56:06,624 --> 00:56:08,669
Don'’t do anything stupid.Mm-hmm.

678
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:10,889
Oh, and, uh, no,
I Don'’t wanna come with you

679
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:12,780
and do whatever is it
that you'’re gonna do,

680
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:13,848
but thank you.

681
00:56:14,022 --> 00:56:15,546
Go away.

682
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:23,902
Don'’t let cevoli
catch you selling
those to the locals.

683
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:25,599
Let me tell you something.

684
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:28,646
I'’ve been in the Navy
since I was 16.

685
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:31,126
And our line of work
is a dangerous one.

686
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,824
One where tomorrow
is never promised.

687
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:34,958
Hell, tomorrow'’s barely
a gentleman'’s agreement.

688
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:38,830
So if there'’s Liberty
to be had...

689
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:40,832
then Liberty we should take.

690
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:43,791
At two dollars a pack,
i'’ll take a risk.

691
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,448
Let'’s enjoy ourselves, boys.

692
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:49,841
Mohring would insist.

693
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,278
When in France.

694
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:54,411
There he is.Tom.

695
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:10,252
Don'’t do anything
I wouldn'’t do, sailor.

696
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:21,988
What do we have here?

697
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:23,222
Hello.

698
00:57:23,396 --> 00:57:24,876
At the boulevard
de la croissant.

699
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:27,182
Few too many sailors
on this street.

700
00:57:27,356 --> 00:57:29,422
Doesn'’t look like
a street with
a whorehouse on it.

701
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,467
No. you Don'’t have
enough scratch or game

702
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:33,232
for these fine European women.

703
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:35,930
Hey, i'’m here to drink,
so just point me
in that direction.

704
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:38,063
Oh, to the first bar
we find, then.

705
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:40,195
You guys go ahead.

706
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:42,154
I gotta find something
for Daisy.

707
00:57:44,112 --> 00:57:45,723
I'’ll catch up. All right.

708
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:48,421
Hey, Don'’t forget
the, uh, Lacy bits.

709
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:49,857
Funny.

710
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:28,983
What'’s going on?

711
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:31,116
Are you blind?
It'’s Liz Taylor.

712
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,963
The movie star.
Where the hell have you been?

713
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:34,162
I'’d like that.

714
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:35,336
Miss Taylor.Mmm.

715
00:58:35,468 --> 00:58:36,600
Would you sign my postcard?

716
00:58:36,774 --> 00:58:38,776
Oh, I Don'’t do
signatures, darling.

717
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,473
But i'’ll give you a kiss.

718
00:58:43,345 --> 00:58:44,564
Thank you, Mrs. Taylor.

719
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:45,783
And who'’s your friend?

720
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:47,698
He ain'’t with me.

721
00:58:47,872 --> 00:58:50,483
Ensign Jesse brown, ma'’am.

722
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,139
I'’m a naval aviator.

723
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:56,358
Oh, they let colored folks
be pilots these days?

724
00:58:57,055 --> 00:58:58,056
It would appear so.

725
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,579
Well, how enlightened.

726
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:01,015
Liz?

727
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:04,149
I have to run, dear,

728
00:59:04,323 --> 00:59:06,934
but you and your wingmen
should join us
at the casino later.

729
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:08,414
I like pilots.

730
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,329
Miss Elizabeth?

731
00:59:12,157 --> 00:59:13,680
I'’m sure you'’ve noticed, but...

732
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:15,290
You just wear something smart,

733
00:59:15,464 --> 00:59:18,293
and you tell them
Elizabeth invited you.

734
00:59:31,002 --> 00:59:32,481
You'’re thinking it.

735
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:35,484
Ah, look who it is.

736
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:37,724
Get something nice for Daisy?

737
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:39,488
Yeah, got something else, too.

738
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:42,274
I was invited to
the casino de Carlo
this evening.

739
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:43,971
We all were, actually.

740
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:47,845
By Elizabeth Taylor.
You'’re shitting me.

741
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,219
Wait, Liz Taylor, the actress?

742
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:50,369
How? Where?

743
00:59:50,543 --> 00:59:52,589
How? Met her.
Where? At the beach.

744
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:54,547
Nice lady, actually.

745
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:56,418
I Don'’t believe you.

746
00:59:57,289 --> 00:59:58,507
But I got some money to blow.

747
00:59:58,682 --> 00:59:59,802
Let'’s see if you'’re lying.

748
00:59:59,944 --> 01:00:01,162
Now we'’re talking.

749
01:00:01,336 --> 01:00:02,990
Put up or shut up.

750
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:13,435
Fellas.

751
01:00:16,264 --> 01:00:17,264
Let'’s get dressed. Whoo!

752
01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:19,050
Wow.

753
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:31,149
Now, I know y'’all are used
to getting turned down,
but I ain'’t.

754
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:33,563
If we Don'’t get in,
doubt this is
the only place in town.

755
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,588
Yeah, but this is the only
place with Liz Taylor.

756
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:37,111
Allegedly.

757
01:00:39,592 --> 01:00:40,898
We were invited.

758
01:00:41,899 --> 01:00:44,292
I am certain you were not.

759
01:00:47,426 --> 01:00:49,428
Elizabeth Taylor.
I believe she... please, sir,

760
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:51,648
leave now.Jesse.

761
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,043
It'’s okay.
We'’ll go find somewhere else.

762
01:00:58,002 --> 01:00:59,003
Right.

763
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,960
Okay.

764
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:25,943
This way.

765
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:32,514
You sly dog.

766
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:34,125
Never in doubt.

767
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:43,482
Did you see her? This is... Oh, man!

768
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:46,180
Women here are...

769
01:01:47,486 --> 01:01:49,246
I think it'’s time
to make a little money.

770
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:52,709
Oh, look at this place!
I think we found the party.

771
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:58,889
Oh, no!

772
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:03,937
Is that... Liz Taylor.

773
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:07,875
That'’s Liz Taylor! Liz Taylor.

774
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:10,639
That'’s Liz Taylor?
She look nice.

775
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:12,729
Guess I should introduce you.

776
01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:14,774
Yep.

777
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:16,167
Fellas? mm-hmm?

778
01:02:20,562 --> 01:02:22,322
Never met a movie star.
Kinda nervous.

779
01:02:22,477 --> 01:02:24,131
Well, lookie-loo.

780
01:02:24,305 --> 01:02:25,742
The fighting 32.

781
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,222
You came!

782
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:29,833
Yes, ma'’am.

783
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:33,967
Do you gentlemen
all know each other?

784
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:35,684
Just sharing space
at the moment, ma'’am.

785
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:38,189
That'’s right.
Until the actual war starts.

786
01:02:38,363 --> 01:02:40,060
And then,
we'’ll be on the ground.

787
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:42,019
And they'’ll be nowhere
to be found.

788
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:43,977
You always talk
in nursery rhymes?

789
01:02:44,151 --> 01:02:46,284
Please, take a seat.

790
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:48,852
I could use some
fresh luck anyway.

791
01:02:49,635 --> 01:02:50,636
Yes, ma'’am.

792
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:52,290
Please.

793
01:02:59,427 --> 01:03:01,429
Okay. Why Don'’t you
and I grab a drink

794
01:03:01,603 --> 01:03:04,911
and toast to not being
on a ship with these guys?

795
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:06,304
Come on. Good idea.

796
01:03:06,478 --> 01:03:07,827
Buy a couple rounds on us.

797
01:03:09,742 --> 01:03:11,048
I'’ll keep your seat warm.

798
01:03:13,702 --> 01:03:15,226
Put some here.

799
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,663
- Let'’s go, buddy.
- Come on. here. And...

800
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,057
Here.

801
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:23,582
Here.

802
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:37,074
My lucky man.

803
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:41,818
Oh, here we go.

804
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,168
Cheers, ladies.

805
01:03:44,342 --> 01:03:45,972
To beautiful people,
beautiful life.Cheers.

806
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:48,128
Yes, cheers. New friends,
future ex-wives.

807
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:50,087
Here we go. Hey!

808
01:03:54,047 --> 01:03:55,266
Whoo!

809
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,658
Mm-hmm.

810
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,225
That'’s what we call a winner.

811
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,315
Come on!

812
01:04:01,489 --> 01:04:03,230
About time
to call it a night, bubba.

813
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:04,449
Yes!

814
01:04:05,493 --> 01:04:06,538
Oh, shit.

815
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:19,420
So, you speak French.

816
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:21,074
I picked it up in high school.

817
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:24,382
Uh, sir. Uh, whiskey,

818
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,732
and then,
whatever my friend'’s having.

819
01:04:38,352 --> 01:04:39,614
Show off.

820
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:41,441
That was pretty good.

821
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:44,489
It'’s good.

822
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:48,145
Pretty wild.

823
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,278
Rubbing shoulders
with movie stars.

824
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:52,801
Drinking, gambling.

825
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:56,196
The reds are about to strike,

826
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,894
we'’re partying in France.

827
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:04,204
I just want to go home
with this having
meant something.

828
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:05,378
Well...

829
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:08,905
You just keep it up
with miss Liz Taylor,

830
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:11,167
and you just might.

831
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,955
Thank you.

832
01:05:16,825 --> 01:05:18,305
You forgot the ginger beer.

833
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:19,916
I saw a place looked real nice.

834
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,787
I'’ll get a drink from there.

835
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:23,136
Hey, pal. Let'’s try that.

836
01:05:23,832 --> 01:05:24,877
Let'’s try that.

837
01:05:27,793 --> 01:05:29,447
Change of scenery, fellas.

838
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:31,928
As long as this place
has French women,
i'’m happy.

839
01:05:32,102 --> 01:05:33,407
We'’ll be Jake on that front.

840
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:35,235
Right, I lost
all my money anyway.
Come on.

841
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:36,604
- We'’re leaving?
- Sorry.

842
01:05:36,628 --> 01:05:37,846
Excuse me?

843
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:40,806
Miss Elizabeth,
thank you for having us.

844
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,590
It was very kind of you.

845
01:05:42,764 --> 01:05:44,418
Well, is that it for you boys?

846
01:05:44,592 --> 01:05:46,159
I'’m afraid so.

847
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:49,032
Hmm. Well,
you be safe out there.

848
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:55,342
Would you?

849
01:05:57,518 --> 01:05:58,563
Thank you.

850
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,226
We'’re a little outside
the Liberty area.

851
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,750
I won'’t tell if you Don'’t,
lieutenant. Voilà!

852
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:13,230
Oh!

853
01:06:13,404 --> 01:06:15,536
Voilà, voilà! Look at that.

854
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:16,990
How'’d you find this place?

855
01:06:20,802 --> 01:06:22,979
Bonjour.ladies.

856
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:24,154
You behave.

857
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:29,028
Uh, whiskey, please.

858
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:32,989
Careful.

859
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:40,866
Hmm.

860
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,215
Ladies!

861
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:44,609
And drinks. Here you go.

862
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:53,705
So you gotta use what ya got.

863
01:06:58,144 --> 01:07:01,234
Being handsome
helped me land Daisy,
but you?

864
01:07:03,715 --> 01:07:05,456
You?

865
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:08,589
We'’re gonna need
a different approach.

866
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:09,764
How about...

867
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:14,595
You'’re an American aviator
in France?

868
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:16,771
That'’s all I got?

869
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:18,545
Gotta play to
your strengths, lieutenant.

870
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,036
Sir.

871
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,119
You'’re without your wings.

872
01:07:24,214 --> 01:07:26,346
You gotta be
kidding me.

873
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,194
No, no, Jesse,
i'’m not takin'’ your wings.

874
01:07:28,218 --> 01:07:29,262
Just borrowing.

875
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:34,050
Plus, my co refused
to pin '’em on me
during graduation,

876
01:07:34,224 --> 01:07:37,053
so they'’re not
that sentimental.

877
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:41,535
Now, at least you look the part.

878
01:07:47,846 --> 01:07:50,283
What about
a magic trick? Magic trick?

879
01:07:50,457 --> 01:07:52,372
Yeah. you know magic tricks?

880
01:07:53,243 --> 01:07:55,332
I... I know '’em.
I know...

881
01:07:55,506 --> 01:07:56,700
Yes or no? It'’s a magic trick.

882
01:07:56,724 --> 01:07:58,248
You know a magic trick? Yeah.

883
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:04,123
Like I said,
you gotta use what you got.

884
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:11,522
"It'’s my first time
in France."

885
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:18,180
Sorry. it'’s okay.

886
01:08:18,354 --> 01:08:19,399
Just say, "bonjour."

887
01:08:19,573 --> 01:08:20,792
Bonjour. Bonjour.

888
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:28,278
Bonjour. Bonjour.

889
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,584
I'’d like to, um,

890
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:32,846
treat you ladies
to a magic trick.

891
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,675
It'’s called the, uh,

892
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:36,286
fire breathing aviator.

893
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:44,250
Oh, la, la.

894
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:50,037
You know frank Sinatra?

895
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:54,304
He'’s my third cousin.
Yeah.

896
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:56,933
I Don'’t sound like him,
but I sure as hell
look like him, right?

897
01:08:56,957 --> 01:08:58,762
Looks better on you.
You'’re the pilot in command.

898
01:08:58,786 --> 01:09:01,658
Bordeaux?
Baby, I Don'’t drink wine. No.

899
01:09:01,832 --> 01:09:04,227
Forgive my uncultured friend.
He doesn'’t know a damn thing.

900
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,316
Stick to whiskey.

901
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:23,636
Oh, they let you in here?

902
01:09:26,944 --> 01:09:29,817
You know, I had something
going with Liz
before y'’all showed up.

903
01:09:32,993 --> 01:09:34,256
I think she'’s married.

904
01:09:35,693 --> 01:09:37,173
Something funny, sideshow?

905
01:09:37,346 --> 01:09:39,131
Excuse me,
just give me one second.

906
01:09:39,305 --> 01:09:41,524
You'’re the one
that brought the circus.

907
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,310
Hey.

908
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:46,529
What'’s going on? nothing.

909
01:09:46,703 --> 01:09:47,792
Everything'’s fine.

910
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:49,488
You need your
pansy-ass friend here

911
01:09:49,662 --> 01:09:51,011
to help you out? Hey.

912
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,227
All right, we can cool it.

913
01:09:52,318 --> 01:09:53,450
We'’ve all been drinking.

914
01:09:53,624 --> 01:09:55,495
Tom. I'’m good. hey, hey.

915
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:57,149
I... I know.

916
01:09:57,323 --> 01:09:58,692
Yeah, but you won'’t be
after i'’m done with you.

917
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:02,154
- Back up! Tom!
- Come on!

918
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:03,895
Come on! Oh, sorry.

919
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:05,307
Tom!
There'’s someone there.

920
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:06,985
Come on!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

921
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:09,399
- Come on!
- Let go of him! Hey! Hey!

922
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:11,183
Come on, boys,
we gotta go! Stop! Stop!

923
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,228
- Come on! Let'’s go! Run!
- We gotta go. Run!

924
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:14,645
Ah, shoot, your wings.

925
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:16,318
- Y'’all lucky!
- Let'’s go!

926
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:17,342
Hustle, ladies!

927
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,693
Oh, um.

928
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:22,218
Tom, come on!
Tom, that way! That way!

929
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:23,871
Oh, god! Go, go, go!

930
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:34,404
You know
how I do that trick?

931
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:36,971
I eat the cigarette.

932
01:10:38,712 --> 01:10:40,236
You didn'’t have to do that.

933
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,455
I got the kiss.

934
01:10:44,414 --> 01:10:45,937
I wish you hadn'’t hit him.

935
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:49,767
You would'’ve done
the same for me.

936
01:10:59,342 --> 01:11:00,821
Not hunting for a thank you.

937
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:02,519
You were hunting
for a fight though.

938
01:11:02,693 --> 01:11:04,129
Defending my wingman.

939
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:12,703
I can fight my own fights.

940
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,228
Been doing it
for a long time now.

941
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:30,111
Jesse brown.

942
01:11:30,982 --> 01:11:32,331
Squadron of one.

943
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,254
Ready room. Asap.
Something big'’s going down.

944
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:54,397
I hope that you all
had fun last night,

945
01:11:54,571 --> 01:11:58,749
because the north Koreans
came pouring over
the 38th parallel.

946
01:11:58,923 --> 01:12:00,272
They have taken Seoul.

947
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:02,326
If they take the rest of
the southern peninsula,

948
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:05,408
it'’s on to Japan,
and there go our efforts
to contain communism,

949
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:06,670
so says Washington.

950
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:08,454
So, what does that mean for us?

951
01:12:08,628 --> 01:12:09,628
It means we'’re up.

952
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,110
We'’re setting sail for Korea.

953
01:12:12,284 --> 01:12:13,851
Now, I know that
for almost all of you,

954
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:16,332
this will be the first time
you'’re seeing combat.

955
01:12:17,245 --> 01:12:18,769
Your training is important, yes.

956
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,424
And you are sure as hell ready
to do what you need to do.

957
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:22,990
I made sure of that.

958
01:12:23,164 --> 01:12:25,384
But the most
important thing is this:

959
01:12:25,558 --> 01:12:27,168
We bring everyone home.

960
01:12:28,518 --> 01:12:31,042
We bring everyone home.

961
01:12:40,878 --> 01:12:44,360
Brass is worried
there may be as many as
100,000 Chinese

962
01:12:44,534 --> 01:12:48,015
already in North Korea,
ready to take up the fight
at a moment'’s notice.

963
01:12:48,189 --> 01:12:50,670
MacArthur ordered b-29'’s
to take out two Bridges

964
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:53,020
along the yalu river,
on the border,

965
01:12:53,194 --> 01:12:56,154
hoping to slow the Chinese
from sending in
any more troops.

966
01:12:56,328 --> 01:12:57,329
But they missed.

967
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:59,636
So, I will lead the fighting 32.

968
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:02,465
We will take out
the antiaircraft
in sinuiju city.

969
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:04,771
Tarsiers, you will fly support
for the panthers

970
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:07,600
until it is safe for them
to come in and bomb
those Bridges.

971
01:13:07,774 --> 01:13:09,646
This is just a friendly
reminder, gentlemen.

972
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,388
Don'’t shoot or bomb anything
on the Chinese side
of the river,

973
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:14,433
unless you wanna be
personally responsible

974
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:16,435
for starting another world war.

975
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:18,872
We'’re flying directly
into gunfire.

976
01:13:19,046 --> 01:13:20,221
I need everyone sharp.

977
01:13:20,874 --> 01:13:21,875
Be smart.

978
01:13:22,615 --> 01:13:23,790
Be ready.

979
01:13:23,964 --> 01:13:25,009
Yes, sir.

980
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:45,551
201 to 205. You there?

981
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:47,205
Go ahead, 201.

982
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:49,313
I seem to be having some trouble
with my landing gear.

983
01:13:49,337 --> 01:13:50,382
Can you confirm?

984
01:13:51,688 --> 01:13:53,516
Your gear is in transit.

985
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:56,040
Uh, 201 to rug.

986
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:58,774
We got a mechanical issue,
and can'’t lead us
to the mission area.

987
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:00,697
Passing the lead to 205.

988
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:03,569
Roger, 205. You are cleared
for the downwind.

989
01:14:08,313 --> 01:14:10,097
Stay on the right side
of the river, Tom.

990
01:14:10,271 --> 01:14:11,751
Yes, sir.

991
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:13,944
205 is in hot.

992
01:15:53,461 --> 01:15:54,506
205 to flight.

993
01:15:55,986 --> 01:15:57,640
Commencing flak suppression now.

994
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,991
Ah!

995
01:16:02,645 --> 01:16:03,645
It'’s a mig!

996
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:09,869
Koenig, take goode and lavery.
Stay on the aa.

997
01:16:10,043 --> 01:16:10,783
We'’re on it.

998
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:12,263
Jesse, break left.

999
01:16:12,437 --> 01:16:13,437
Let'’s hose this guy.

1000
01:16:13,525 --> 01:16:14,570
Roger that!

1001
01:16:16,963 --> 01:16:18,225
Happy hunting.

1002
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:19,575
It'’s Bo time.

1003
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:33,589
Three good hits.

1004
01:16:33,763 --> 01:16:35,808
Coming around for another
run on the aa.

1005
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:46,471
See him? negative.

1006
01:16:47,037 --> 01:16:48,081
I got nothing.

1007
01:16:58,918 --> 01:17:00,572
Bandit high!
Bandit high! Huh?

1008
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:01,834
Break!

1009
01:17:15,413 --> 01:17:17,023
Tom! He'’s on me pretty good!

1010
01:17:17,197 --> 01:17:19,417
I'’m gonna bring him to you
through the canyon.

1011
01:17:21,071 --> 01:17:22,594
I say we show him
the lighthouse.

1012
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:23,769
Meet me in the middle.

1013
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,911
Enemy aa is silenced.
I repeat, enemy aa
is silenced.

1014
01:17:35,085 --> 01:17:37,565
Copy that, flight leader.
Approaching target now.

1015
01:17:41,918 --> 01:17:43,006
Oh!

1016
01:17:51,536 --> 01:17:53,059
Come on.

1017
01:18:13,253 --> 01:18:15,560
Okay,
I have a visual on you.

1018
01:18:15,734 --> 01:18:17,867
Break right,
up and hard on my call.

1019
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:19,477
Roger that!

1020
01:18:31,054 --> 01:18:32,272
Ready, set...

1021
01:18:32,446 --> 01:18:33,839
Hit it!

1022
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:43,066
Good hit, Tom!

1023
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,199
Quite fine, Jesse! Quite fine!

1024
01:18:50,856 --> 01:18:53,337
This is panther lead.
Approaching target.

1025
01:19:15,968 --> 01:19:17,317
Good hit, good hit.

1026
01:19:17,491 --> 01:19:19,537
Rear bridge is down.
Coming back around.

1027
01:19:22,975 --> 01:19:24,803
Let'’s bring it home,
panthers.

1028
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:37,642
Flight lead,
we'’ve got aa
coming from the Chinese side.

1029
01:19:37,816 --> 01:19:38,991
We can'’t touch '’em.

1030
01:19:39,165 --> 01:19:40,776
Time to bug out.

1031
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:42,125
Roger that.

1032
01:19:56,182 --> 01:19:58,054
205, I still have ordnance.

1033
01:19:58,794 --> 01:19:59,969
I can hit the bridge.

1034
01:20:00,143 --> 01:20:02,406
It'’s too much aa, 211.
Stand down.

1035
01:20:06,889 --> 01:20:09,021
Jesse, stand down!
That'’s an order!

1036
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:30,973
That'’s a direct hit!

1037
01:21:31,147 --> 01:21:33,366
That'’s a direct hit!
Bridge is down!

1038
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,064
That a boy, Jesse!

1039
01:21:35,238 --> 01:21:36,543
There we go, ace!

1040
01:21:36,717 --> 01:21:38,981
Iroquois, this is 205.

1041
01:21:39,155 --> 01:21:40,939
Both Bridges have been
destroyed.

1042
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:42,680
Returning to ship.

1043
01:21:42,854 --> 01:21:45,509
Copy that, 205.
Good work.

1044
01:21:58,174 --> 01:22:01,481
Seems like I missed
one hell of a ride, huh?

1045
01:22:01,655 --> 01:22:04,575
Intelligence has confirmed
that that rat line
has been crippled. Well done.

1046
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:07,574
Now, we are all
still on standby,

1047
01:22:07,748 --> 01:22:11,535
but everybody go
get yourselves cleaned up
for some chow.

1048
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:14,973
Well...

1049
01:22:15,147 --> 01:22:17,547
Let'’s go, boys.
Let'’s get some food. Good job, Tom.

1050
01:22:20,587 --> 01:22:21,937
Here'’s the mission report.

1051
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:23,939
Well done, hudner.

1052
01:22:25,592 --> 01:22:26,593
How you feeling?

1053
01:22:27,768 --> 01:22:28,813
Good.

1054
01:22:31,381 --> 01:22:32,425
Hmm.

1055
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:34,123
Sit down.

1056
01:22:46,918 --> 01:22:47,918
Meh.

1057
01:22:49,573 --> 01:22:50,574
That feeling?

1058
01:22:51,705 --> 01:22:53,664
That'’s the mundanity
of a job well done.

1059
01:22:58,147 --> 01:23:01,280
You know how many wars
there have been
in the history of mankind?

1060
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:04,631
No, course not.

1061
01:23:04,805 --> 01:23:06,938
'’cause most wars are forgotten.

1062
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:08,418
All the men who fought in '’em,

1063
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:11,421
and all the medals they won.

1064
01:23:11,595 --> 01:23:13,945
Heroes and hardware
fade to the back
of the history books

1065
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:16,252
because it'’s not about war.

1066
01:23:16,426 --> 01:23:19,429
This war never ends,
there'’s no v day,
there'’s no finish line.

1067
01:23:20,908 --> 01:23:23,041
The real battle in all of life

1068
01:23:23,215 --> 01:23:25,043
is being someone
that people can count on.

1069
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:29,047
And that isn'’t defined
in a single moment.

1070
01:23:29,221 --> 01:23:31,702
You earn that with
a lifetime of showing up.

1071
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:36,881
These conflicts,
they Don'’t define you, Tom.
You Don'’t want '’em to.

1072
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:38,056
Trust me.

1073
01:23:40,276 --> 01:23:42,060
Go get something to eat.

1074
01:23:43,496 --> 01:23:44,497
Go on.

1075
01:23:50,808 --> 01:23:51,852
Hey, Tom.

1076
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,030
What'’s the most
important thing?

1077
01:23:56,727 --> 01:23:58,120
Bring '’em home.

1078
01:23:58,642 --> 01:23:59,686
You did.

1079
01:24:41,598 --> 01:24:43,817
Sir,
that is absolutely true.

1080
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:47,271
This is wisdom-seven.
 Enemy troops estimate company size and two tanks...

1081
01:24:55,394 --> 01:24:59,224
Personnel tango-Romeo-
5-2-5-3-9-0.

1082
01:25:05,187 --> 01:25:06,753
You know what else I could use?

1083
01:25:06,927 --> 01:25:08,451
Warm blankets?

1084
01:25:10,192 --> 01:25:11,193
Fire?

1085
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:13,238
The sun, maybe?

1086
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:16,372
Another shot with Liz Taylor.

1087
01:25:16,546 --> 01:25:19,244
Oh, Jesus! Buddy,
you gotta stop saying that.

1088
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:21,203
You never had a shot with Liz.

1089
01:25:21,377 --> 01:25:23,030
Uh, you weren'’t
paying attention.

1090
01:25:24,989 --> 01:25:26,295
I would take feeling in my toes

1091
01:25:26,469 --> 01:25:28,340
rather than a shot
with Liz right now.

1092
01:25:35,608 --> 01:25:37,219
You think
they'’ll hit us tonight?

1093
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:40,352
I would.

1094
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,095
You ever got anything nice
to say?

1095
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,118
Incoming! shit!

1096
01:26:10,382 --> 01:26:11,688
Corpsman!

1097
01:26:11,862 --> 01:26:13,422
You'’re doing fine.
I got you.

1098
01:26:13,907 --> 01:26:14,908
Downrange!

1099
01:26:17,128 --> 01:26:18,999
Move left! fire at will!

1100
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,740
Move, move, move!

1101
01:26:21,393 --> 01:26:22,568
Incoming!

1102
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:39,324
What'’s going on?

1103
01:26:58,474 --> 01:26:59,794
Looks like
the mission report said

1104
01:26:59,953 --> 01:27:02,260
I ignored my commanding
officer'’s orders.

1105
01:27:06,177 --> 01:27:07,874
Well, you know
how this stuff works.

1106
01:27:08,048 --> 01:27:09,615
I only wrote down what happened.

1107
01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:15,969
I'’m glad that'’s
what you saw,
lieutenant.

1108
01:27:20,409 --> 01:27:21,671
It'’s what happened.

1109
01:27:28,155 --> 01:27:30,854
Look, what difference
does it make?
We got the job done.

1110
01:27:37,426 --> 01:27:38,905
Insubordination.

1111
01:27:44,563 --> 01:27:46,652
That'’s what they'’re putting
in my fitness report.

1112
01:27:53,877 --> 01:27:55,317
Uh, no, cevoli'’s gotta
understand...

1113
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,836
It'’s coming from
above cevoli, Tom.

1114
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:58,316
Skipper'’s already read it.

1115
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:05,980
Jesse, I didn'’t
want that to happen.

1116
01:28:06,063 --> 01:28:09,153
What did you want to happen,
Mr. Academy?

1117
01:28:16,378 --> 01:28:17,466
Sorry, pal.

1118
01:28:29,478 --> 01:28:31,871
You really hamstringed me
on this one.

1119
01:28:35,788 --> 01:28:38,008
I can'’t get promoted
with that on my report.

1120
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:49,324
You ever think we'’d see a mig?

1121
01:28:49,498 --> 01:28:52,172
Hell, I thought
goode was gonna bail out
all the way back to Brooklyn.

1122
01:28:52,196 --> 01:28:54,546
You'’re the one
who shit his pants
when the mig swooped in.

1123
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:57,308
By the way, you changed your diaper
yet? Why Don'’t you come check?

1124
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,732
Yeah, we'’re lucky
we made it out alive
the way you two shoot.

1125
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:01,019
How'’s that for aim?

1126
01:29:04,643 --> 01:29:05,992
I need your help with something.

1127
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:09,581
All blue shirts on duty...

1128
01:29:09,605 --> 01:29:11,520
Boy, you stole it.

1129
01:29:11,694 --> 01:29:13,652
That'’s a white man'’s uniform.

1130
01:29:13,826 --> 01:29:16,394
All blue shirts on duty
report to main hangar 3.

1131
01:29:16,568 --> 01:29:18,265
You shouldn'’t be
in that.

1132
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,441
Eh, boy?

1133
01:29:21,312 --> 01:29:22,879
Think i'’ll make it out...

1134
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:49,122
Every hateful word
anyone'’s ever said to me.

1135
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:54,389
Wrote it down.

1136
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,046
Repeat it to myself.

1137
01:30:05,312 --> 01:30:06,966
Been doing it since I was a boy.

1138
01:30:10,187 --> 01:30:11,231
It helps.

1139
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:21,720
What'’s that?

1140
01:30:21,894 --> 01:30:23,722
Testimonies from the guys.

1141
01:30:23,896 --> 01:30:27,117
Saying how the mission
was complicated,
and you did the right thing.

1142
01:30:28,814 --> 01:30:30,903
It'’ll fix whatever remark
they put in your report.

1143
01:30:39,042 --> 01:30:40,585
There'’s a...
There'’s a way things work

1144
01:30:40,609 --> 01:30:42,088
you'’re not always
gonna understand.

1145
01:30:44,395 --> 01:30:48,268
A slap on my wrist,
it'’s... it'’s not the same
as a slap on yours.

1146
01:30:52,011 --> 01:30:53,012
This won'’t help.

1147
01:30:59,323 --> 01:31:00,759
I'’m sticking
my neck out for you.

1148
01:31:02,587 --> 01:31:04,197
Sticking your neck out?

1149
01:31:05,198 --> 01:31:06,373
With a piece of paper?

1150
01:31:08,201 --> 01:31:09,464
Tom...

1151
01:31:11,814 --> 01:31:13,424
That paper cost you nothing.

1152
01:31:14,817 --> 01:31:15,818
Nothing!

1153
01:31:16,862 --> 01:31:18,734
You know how tired
I am of people

1154
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:21,737
trying to help me
while looking down on me?

1155
01:31:25,218 --> 01:31:26,785
I'’m not looking down on you.

1156
01:31:31,224 --> 01:31:32,574
What do you want me to do?

1157
01:31:38,275 --> 01:31:41,191
Just be my wingman, pal.

1158
01:31:44,063 --> 01:31:45,064
That'’s it.

1159
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,940
Forget the life saver,
and get in the damn water!

1160
01:31:51,114 --> 01:31:52,463
Please, Tom!

1161
01:32:23,363 --> 01:32:24,756
Ensign brown?

1162
01:32:26,932 --> 01:32:29,805
We were waiting for you
back in the wardroom,
but you never showed.

1163
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:33,939
Needed some time alone.

1164
01:32:39,249 --> 01:32:41,209
Bunch of us brothers
across the ship been talking.

1165
01:32:42,774 --> 01:32:44,733
Heard you had some
real good shooting yesterday,

1166
01:32:44,907 --> 01:32:47,039
and we just wanna
let you know we see you.

1167
01:32:51,435 --> 01:32:54,960
Yeah, my rack man knows
how to fix it. I'’ll get him.

1168
01:32:55,134 --> 01:32:58,485
On it. Now get these
back on the cleats, too.

1169
01:33:01,793 --> 01:33:03,621
Tab it, Mark it off.

1170
01:33:14,066 --> 01:33:16,591
Bunch of us chipped in
back in cannes.

1171
01:33:25,425 --> 01:33:26,862
What'’s your name, sailor?

1172
01:33:27,689 --> 01:33:28,689
Fambrough.

1173
01:33:29,473 --> 01:33:32,041
Archie fambrough, sir.

1174
01:33:34,304 --> 01:33:35,653
Jesse.

1175
01:33:49,928 --> 01:33:51,103
Archie.

1176
01:33:55,325 --> 01:33:56,848
Tell the brothers
I appreciate it.

1177
01:34:13,517 --> 01:34:16,476
Roger that!
Let'’s mount it to the deck!
We should be good.

1178
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,130
All right, let'’s go.

1179
01:34:19,349 --> 01:34:21,090
That'’s it, easy. Easy!

1180
01:34:21,264 --> 01:34:22,937
Be gentle now.
All right, let'’s go,
let'’s go, come on!

1181
01:34:22,961 --> 01:34:24,963
- We got you.
- He'’s packaged.

1182
01:34:25,137 --> 01:34:26,312
Gonna be okay.

1183
01:34:26,486 --> 01:34:28,575
Move! Doc'’s
waiting downstairs.

1184
01:34:30,447 --> 01:34:31,491
We got you, bud.

1185
01:34:34,886 --> 01:34:37,541
Aye, aye, sir,
they'’re up and running.

1186
01:34:37,715 --> 01:34:40,065
Hey, double time it
back to your station.

1187
01:34:40,805 --> 01:34:42,154
Mississippi brown?

1188
01:34:43,286 --> 01:34:44,896
Charlie ward.

1189
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:46,390
We went to
flight school together.

1190
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,508
Alabama ward? The very one.

1191
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,729
You flying eggbeaters now?

1192
01:34:51,903 --> 01:34:54,012
The Navy must'’ve heard
I was looking for something
stupid and dangerous.

1193
01:34:54,036 --> 01:34:56,560
Besides, I wouldn'’t
feel right sharing
the fixed-wing skies

1194
01:34:56,734 --> 01:34:58,127
with a southern legend.

1195
01:34:59,302 --> 01:35:00,433
Always knew you'’d make it,

1196
01:35:00,607 --> 01:35:02,522
but it is damn good
to see you, Jesse.

1197
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,525
Although, I wish it were
under better circumstances.

1198
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:11,531
Good to see you, pal.

1199
01:35:13,403 --> 01:35:15,100
Take care of yourself,
Mississippi.

1200
01:35:19,844 --> 01:35:20,845
'’bama!

1201
01:35:23,282 --> 01:35:24,283
I married her.

1202
01:35:30,115 --> 01:35:31,726
Oh, we home, baby.

1203
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,120
You wanna get down?

1204
01:35:35,294 --> 01:35:36,339
Okay.

1205
01:35:44,695 --> 01:35:45,740
Jesse.

1206
01:35:55,445 --> 01:35:57,795
My dear, sweet angel,

1207
01:35:57,969 --> 01:35:59,536
I hope this letter
reaches you in time,

1208
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:01,451
because I wanted to be the first

1209
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:04,019
to wish you
a very happy birthday.

1210
01:36:04,193 --> 01:36:06,499
I know it'’s hard to plan
a party from across the world,

1211
01:36:06,673 --> 01:36:10,025
but I thought of something fun
we might be
able to do together.

1212
01:36:10,199 --> 01:36:11,461
Grab Pam.

1213
01:36:11,635 --> 01:36:12,810
Got something for her, too.

1214
01:36:18,207 --> 01:36:19,643
"Oh, it'’s dark
and it'’s cramped

1215
01:36:19,817 --> 01:36:21,906
in this spot we'’ve all been.

1216
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,954
It'’s a place for a chick,
but not a mean, old hen."

1217
01:36:48,672 --> 01:36:51,588
"It'’s dark and it'’s cramped,
in this spot we'’ve all been."

1218
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:12,304
Daddy got us a gift.Oh.

1219
01:37:12,478 --> 01:37:13,523
Yeah.

1220
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:19,181
Miss Pam, look.

1221
01:37:32,324 --> 01:37:36,459
Darling,
hope you found a little box
in Pam'’s closet.

1222
01:37:38,026 --> 01:37:39,723
I'’m going to close now.

1223
01:37:39,897 --> 01:37:41,681
I'’ll write to you
as soon I can.

1224
01:37:42,595 --> 01:37:43,988
Your devoted husband.

1225
01:37:45,468 --> 01:37:48,688
Lovingly and completely yours.

1226
01:37:50,342 --> 01:37:51,474
I'’ll love you forever.

1227
01:37:52,823 --> 01:37:53,868
Jesse.

1228
01:38:05,183 --> 01:38:08,143
Just talked to some of
those injured soldiers
that are arriving.

1229
01:38:13,626 --> 01:38:15,498
They'’re from
the 1st marine division.

1230
01:38:15,672 --> 01:38:18,109
Same ones
who hitched a ride with us
from quonset.

1231
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:21,547
They'’re pinned down
at hagaru base.

1232
01:38:23,245 --> 01:38:25,682
They'’re saying that
it'’s an unspeakable hell.

1233
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:29,120
For every one marine,

1234
01:38:29,294 --> 01:38:31,731
there are six Chinese
hiding in the woods.

1235
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,908
Gets below minus 30 at night.

1236
01:38:37,302 --> 01:38:39,609
Those boys are holding on
by their fingernails.

1237
01:38:42,307 --> 01:38:44,831
Some air support would be
mighty welcome. Hmm?

1238
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,749
Punch a hole in that wall.
Take away the Chinese
numerical advantage.

1239
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:52,491
Give our guys a chance
to get back up on their feet.

1240
01:38:57,844 --> 01:38:59,672
This is a dangerous mission.

1241
01:39:01,457 --> 01:39:03,763
It is dangerous
in a different way
than sinuiju, okay?

1242
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,765
This is not about
Bridges and rat lines.

1243
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:09,030
This is about thousands
of Chinese soldiers
hiding in the woods

1244
01:39:09,204 --> 01:39:11,989
and shooting at you
from 20 feet below.

1245
01:39:14,035 --> 01:39:15,732
This is extremely
hazardous duty.

1246
01:39:15,906 --> 01:39:17,299
I am not gonna sugarcoat it.

1247
01:39:18,039 --> 01:39:19,866
Men need help,

1248
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:21,999
and they need what
only we can give '’em.

1249
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,480
So, i'’m gonna take you there.

1250
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:26,612
We'’re gonna give '’em hell.

1251
01:39:26,786 --> 01:39:28,614
We'’re gonna get
those marines back.

1252
01:39:28,788 --> 01:39:30,486
Yes, sir.
Let'’s get outta here.

1253
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,700
two o'’clock!
Comin'’ at ya!

1254
01:39:32,749 --> 01:39:34,553
- I can'’t see it.
- I got him!

1255
01:39:34,577 --> 01:39:36,144
I got him!

1256
01:39:49,896 --> 01:39:51,246
Buddy, hey!

1257
01:39:53,335 --> 01:39:54,466
You'’re good, you'’re good.

1258
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:56,120
Come on, come on.
You'’re good. Go!

1259
01:39:56,294 --> 01:39:57,426
You'’re good. Go!

1260
01:40:09,568 --> 01:40:10,888
Right side!
Two o'’clock!

1261
01:40:11,657 --> 01:40:12,658
Bring it out!

1262
01:40:15,052 --> 01:40:16,488
You know any good prayers?

1263
01:40:16,662 --> 01:40:18,447
Come on, we'’ve seen
worse than this!

1264
01:40:18,621 --> 01:40:21,406
If you want a prayer,
"dear god, send us
some angels."

1265
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:38,032
There!
The tree line! Light '’em up!

1266
01:40:42,514 --> 01:40:44,864
Fire '’em up! yeah,
get '’em, boys!

1267
01:40:59,531 --> 01:41:00,793
Yeah!

1268
01:41:13,545 --> 01:41:15,286
Move! Move! Move! Come on!

1269
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:17,332
Can'’t let the flyboys
take all the credit!

1270
01:41:24,904 --> 01:41:27,472
Get down,
get down! Let'’s go!
Let'’s go! Let'’s go!

1271
01:41:49,755 --> 01:41:51,017
Yeah!

1272
01:41:52,454 --> 01:41:54,543
You see that?
We got a negro pilot!

1273
01:41:55,413 --> 01:41:57,459
Let'’s go!

1274
01:42:07,469 --> 01:42:09,490
Looks like we got
the Chinese running,

1275
01:42:09,514 --> 01:42:10,839
but let'’s get
a closer look, boys.

1276
01:42:10,863 --> 01:42:12,300
Rendezvous on me.

1277
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:25,617
211, you got a streamer.
I think you'’re losing fuel.

1278
01:42:34,322 --> 01:42:35,322
It'’s not fuel.

1279
01:42:35,453 --> 01:42:36,976
She'’s bleeding oil.

1280
01:42:48,597 --> 01:42:50,686
She'’s not staying up
in the air much longer.

1281
01:42:53,515 --> 01:42:56,082
Let'’s climb.
Find a place
to put her down.

1282
01:43:09,531 --> 01:43:11,315
Take her down
nice and easy, Jesse.

1283
01:43:20,977 --> 01:43:21,978
Jesse, at your 10:00.

1284
01:43:24,372 --> 01:43:25,895
It could work.

1285
01:43:26,765 --> 01:43:27,810
Eyes on it.

1286
01:43:38,255 --> 01:43:40,344
Flight lead,
i'’m following him down.

1287
01:43:40,518 --> 01:43:42,433
Copy that.
We'’ll keep an eye on you.

1288
01:43:42,607 --> 01:43:44,047
Switching radio to
search and rescue.

1289
01:43:50,049 --> 01:43:51,094
Checklist?

1290
01:43:52,051 --> 01:43:53,096
Go ahead.

1291
01:43:54,097 --> 01:43:55,417
Salvo rockets.

1292
01:44:09,417 --> 01:44:10,679
Release drop tanks.

1293
01:44:20,558 --> 01:44:22,473
Canopy back and locked.

1294
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:35,269
Deadstick.

1295
01:44:35,921 --> 01:44:37,096
Deadstick.

1296
01:44:38,228 --> 01:44:39,508
I'’m not gonna make
the clearing.

1297
01:44:39,577 --> 01:44:42,145
Yes, you are.
Flaps down.

1298
01:44:55,985 --> 01:44:57,378
You'’re at 200 feet.

1299
01:45:03,122 --> 01:45:04,515
She won'’t go any slower.

1300
01:45:07,431 --> 01:45:08,911
I can'’t stick with you.

1301
01:45:09,955 --> 01:45:11,653
That'’s the whole
nine yards, Tom.

1302
01:45:50,779 --> 01:45:54,173
Come on! Come on.
Come on!

1303
01:46:07,404 --> 01:46:09,363
211, come in.

1304
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,975
211, come in.

1305
01:46:17,022 --> 01:46:19,547
Tom, once Jesse gets cleared,
you scuttle that plane.

1306
01:46:19,721 --> 01:46:21,853
We can'’t have the corsair
falling into enemy hands.

1307
01:46:25,596 --> 01:46:26,771
He'’s not moving.

1308
01:46:28,338 --> 01:46:30,819
Come on, Jesse. Come on.

1309
01:46:34,997 --> 01:46:36,868
Come on, Jesse. Come on.

1310
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:52,362
What'’s he doing?

1311
01:46:52,536 --> 01:46:54,190
Why isn'’t he getting out?

1312
01:46:54,364 --> 01:46:57,019
If we can see the smoke,
the Chinese can, too.

1313
01:46:59,064 --> 01:47:00,264
He should'’ve been out by now.

1314
01:47:01,153 --> 01:47:02,633
He'’s stuck in there.

1315
01:47:02,807 --> 01:47:05,114
That fire is gonna
eat him alive.

1316
01:47:05,288 --> 01:47:07,377
Come on, Jesse.
Get out of there.

1317
01:47:24,916 --> 01:47:26,440
I'’m gonna go get Jesse.

1318
01:47:26,614 --> 01:47:28,243
Tom, you'’re gonna
get yourself killed.

1319
01:47:28,267 --> 01:47:29,593
Don'’t crash
your own plane.

1320
01:47:29,617 --> 01:47:30,966
The hell are you doing, hudner?

1321
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:32,924
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Iroquois, 201.

1322
01:47:33,098 --> 01:47:36,275
Rdf call. I have one,
soon-to-be two pilots down.

1323
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,799
Request immediate assistance.

1324
01:47:37,973 --> 01:47:39,844
201,
you are in hostile airspace.

1325
01:47:40,018 --> 01:47:42,368
Search and rescue is still
estimating 30 minutes out.

1326
01:47:42,543 --> 01:47:43,543
Return to ship.

1327
01:47:46,372 --> 01:47:48,940
Tom, search and rescue
is 30 minutes out,

1328
01:47:49,114 --> 01:47:50,725
but help is on the way.

1329
01:47:52,553 --> 01:47:53,554
Be careful down there.

1330
01:47:55,207 --> 01:47:56,339
Yes, sir.

1331
01:49:59,549 --> 01:50:02,073
You just ruined
a perfectly good
corsair, lieutenant.

1332
01:50:04,467 --> 01:50:06,687
I think that'’s going
in the mission report.

1333
01:50:08,863 --> 01:50:10,536
That'’s a negative.
We can'’t send an angel.

1334
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,960
Our choppers
can'’t fly in the dark.

1335
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:13,258
It'’s way too dangerous.

1336
01:50:15,478 --> 01:50:16,697
Who'’d they say is down?

1337
01:50:16,871 --> 01:50:18,370
Two corsairs from vf-32.

1338
01:50:18,394 --> 01:50:20,004
Lieutenant hudner
and an ensign brown.

1339
01:50:22,659 --> 01:50:24,052
Tell '’em i'’m coming.

1340
01:50:28,665 --> 01:50:30,101
Stuck in good, Tom.

1341
01:50:33,191 --> 01:50:34,715
I'’m gonna put out this fire.

1342
01:50:34,889 --> 01:50:36,368
We'’ll get you
out of here, okay?

1343
01:51:06,747 --> 01:51:08,226
Should we get you out of here?

1344
01:51:09,706 --> 01:51:10,794
Can we push?

1345
01:51:19,237 --> 01:51:20,282
One.

1346
01:51:21,370 --> 01:51:22,458
Two.

1347
01:51:22,632 --> 01:51:23,807
Three.

1348
01:51:49,398 --> 01:51:50,486
Up and hard on my call.

1349
01:53:23,622 --> 01:53:24,798
Jesse, you hear that?

1350
01:53:30,629 --> 01:53:31,848
They'’re coming for us.

1351
01:54:02,444 --> 01:54:04,838
He'’s pinned
inside. take the axe.

1352
01:54:05,012 --> 01:54:08,015
We got enemy
not far away.
We gotta work fast!

1353
01:54:20,984 --> 01:54:22,551
Tom.

1354
01:54:23,595 --> 01:54:24,770
Tom!

1355
01:54:32,909 --> 01:54:34,041
Just...

1356
01:54:35,956 --> 01:54:37,479
Tell Daisy...

1357
01:54:40,917 --> 01:54:42,876
How much I love her.

1358
01:54:45,487 --> 01:54:46,923
We'’re getting you out of here.

1359
01:54:55,845 --> 01:54:56,890
Hudner!

1360
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:58,892
Hudner!

1361
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:05,333
Hudner!

1362
01:55:36,712 --> 01:55:38,105
We have to leave now.

1363
01:55:46,156 --> 01:55:47,766
I'’ll come back for you.

1364
01:56:46,825 --> 01:56:49,002
Tom, keep warm, all right?

1365
01:56:49,176 --> 01:56:50,264
Coffee down there.

1366
01:56:50,438 --> 01:56:52,092
We'’ll get you out of here soon.

1367
01:58:41,984 --> 01:58:43,290
We can'’t get Jesse.

1368
01:58:47,032 --> 01:58:48,556
The area is totally overrun.

1369
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:50,514
Search and rescue
is too dangerous.

1370
01:58:52,429 --> 01:58:54,910
Skipper has asked us
to scuttle both planes.

1371
01:58:59,088 --> 01:59:02,047
Hudner, doc has grounded you.

1372
01:59:08,141 --> 01:59:09,664
This is a funeral flight, men.

1373
01:59:12,667 --> 01:59:14,712
This is your only chance
to say goodbye.

1374
01:59:22,851 --> 01:59:24,069
Wheels up in 15.

1375
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:21,518
Oh, Tom...

1376
02:00:22,693 --> 02:00:23,999
I know.

1377
02:00:54,725 --> 02:00:57,119
Yesterday, we lost
a great aviator.

1378
02:00:58,076 --> 02:00:59,426
Ensign Jesse brown.

1379
02:01:01,645 --> 02:01:03,647
His loss is felt
all across this ship,

1380
02:01:05,649 --> 02:01:08,130
and will certainly be felt
all across our nation.

1381
02:01:10,915 --> 02:01:12,700
Our country needed Jesse brown.

1382
02:01:25,408 --> 02:01:26,975
Jesse. don'’t worry about that.

1383
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:24,875
Thank you, ma'’am.

1384
02:03:27,661 --> 02:03:30,707
Mrs. Brown.
I'’m seaman first class
Clara Carrol.

1385
02:03:30,881 --> 02:03:32,317
It'’s a pleasure meeting you.

1386
02:03:33,231 --> 02:03:34,407
Come right this way.

1387
02:04:30,985 --> 02:04:32,116
Excuse me.

1388
02:04:50,657 --> 02:04:51,745
Daisy.

1389
02:04:58,012 --> 02:04:59,492
These are yours.

1390
02:05:14,942 --> 02:05:17,901
I can imagine this is a lot.

1391
02:05:18,075 --> 02:05:20,034
I can'’t imagine
how you must... i'’m okay.

1392
02:05:21,992 --> 02:05:23,211
But thank you.

1393
02:05:31,306 --> 02:05:33,177
I was afraid of
coming here today.

1394
02:05:34,614 --> 02:05:36,441
More afraid than
i'’ve been in my life.

1395
02:05:38,095 --> 02:05:40,750
To face you knowing i... Tom, I appreciate
what you did.

1396
02:05:43,448 --> 02:05:44,580
And I hope you know that.

1397
02:06:01,945 --> 02:06:03,947
I was with Jesse before he died.

1398
02:06:06,907 --> 02:06:09,692
He was calm throughout it all.

1399
02:06:11,868 --> 02:06:13,435
I was with him to the very end.

1400
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:19,615
The last words
out of his mouth
were for you.

1401
02:06:21,443 --> 02:06:22,749
He said,

1402
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:25,795
"just tell Daisy how
much I love her."

1403
02:06:35,979 --> 02:06:37,807
I'’m sorry I couldn'’t save him.

1404
02:06:42,029 --> 02:06:43,770
Tom, that was never your job.

1405
02:06:45,859 --> 02:06:47,991
Never anyone'’s job
to save Jesse.

1406
02:06:51,081 --> 02:06:52,692
I asked you to be there for him.

1407
02:06:54,781 --> 02:06:56,130
And you were.

1408
02:07:25,899 --> 02:07:28,945
I'’m going to close now
and climb into the rack.

1409
02:07:30,294 --> 02:07:33,384
I honestly dread going to bed,
but I usually dream of you,

1410
02:07:33,558 --> 02:07:37,301
so i'’ll manage to make it
until we'’ll share our bed
together again.

1411
02:07:40,130 --> 02:07:41,262
Darling,

1412
02:07:42,742 --> 02:07:44,178
pray that it'’ll be soon.

1413
02:07:45,483 --> 02:07:46,659
I have to fly tomorrow...

1414
02:07:48,661 --> 02:07:50,488
But so far as that goes,

1415
02:07:50,663 --> 02:07:52,142
my heart hasn'’t been
to the earth

1416
02:07:52,316 --> 02:07:54,449
since the first time
you kissed me.

1417
02:07:56,494 --> 02:07:57,887
And when you love me,

1418
02:07:58,061 --> 02:08:02,326
you send it clear
out of this world.

1419
02:08:09,507 --> 02:08:11,292
I'’ll write you
as soon as I can.

1420
02:08:13,076 --> 02:08:14,077
I love you forever.

1421
02:08:23,086 --> 02:08:24,348
Your devoted husband,

1422
02:08:26,133 --> 02:08:28,613
lovingly and completely yours.

1423
02:08:31,355 --> 02:08:32,530
Forever.

1424
02:08:35,925 --> 02:08:37,100
Jesse.
