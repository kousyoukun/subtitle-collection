There are virtually
no regulations on business.

152
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:49,331
[man] <i>McAfee started</i>
<i>a ferry service.</i>

153
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:51,435
<i>He's also cultivating</i>

154
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:53,406
<i>that he hopes will be</i>

155
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,209

156
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,061
[Allison] <i>I was doing my</i>
<i>postdoc, I was at Harvard,</i>

157
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:06,498

<i>about Belize.</i>

158
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:08,570
Just how amazing
the jungles were

159
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,008
and the local healers.

160
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:13,145
Decided to go to Belize
and just see

161
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:15,216
what it was
all about, you know?

162
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:17,153
But anyway, we'll talk about
that, then.

163
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:20,193
[Allison] <i>I ended up</i>

164
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:21,663
<i>Yeah, I didn't know him</i>
<i>from Adam,</i>

165
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:24,434
<i>but I told him about</i>
<i>my research,</i>

166
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,171
and he seemed engaged.

167
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,875
He seemed interested,

168
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,000
<i>and within, you know,</i>
<i>minutes of conversation,</i>

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,213
<i>and within, you know,</i>
<i>minutes of conversation,</i>

170
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:32,350
<i>he offered me my dream job.</i>

171
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,223
He said, "You can continue
your research,

172
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,926
and we'll make
a business out of it."

173
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:38,530
And I thought,
"Oh, my God."

174
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,932
I mean, this is‐‐
this is it.

175
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:42,571
This is, like,
my big break.

176
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,420
There was not a space
for the lab,

177
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,426
and he had me stay with him,

178
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:13,399
um, which made me
very uncomfortable.

179
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:20,948
<i>I saw a lot of stuff</i>
<i>when I was living in his place.</i>

180
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:22,217
<i>He had armed guards.</i>

181
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:24,087
<i>I'm not a huge fan of guns.</i>

182
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:25,657
<i>Um, he had meetings</i>

183
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:30,000
<i>with people that were</i>

185
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,003
Um‐‐

186
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:36,780
At one point he said
that he was working on a book

187
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,153
with two heavily armed,

188
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:43,292
very built men
from the Ukraine.

189
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,631
I mean, I don't know, this is
probably not relevant.

you I would go on.

192
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:51,108
[Nanette] Yeah, that's okay.
That's part of interviewing.

195

Oh, fuck, there's just‐‐
there's so much crazy shit.

196
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:57,120
There's so much crazy shit

197
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,000
that I don't even know‐‐

202

Okay, there it goes.

00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:40,861
In Budapest, uh,
we have a hospital

When John came up
with antiviral software,

90% of the people
that were running computers

<i>weren't even aware of viruses.</i>

A computer virus, Bryant,

235
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,490
is a program
written by a hacker.

236
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,962
Any computer that it's in,
it activates

237
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:17,668
and destroys all of the data
in those systems.

<i>that I can't do anything about.</i>

1354
01:18:50,913 --> 01:18:52,650
I can't rectify it.

1355
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:54,019
I can't solve it.

1356
01:18:54,019 --> 01:18:55,856
I can't punish anybody.

1357
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:57,760
I can't do anything except

1358
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,000
regret the loss of my son.

1359
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,033
regret the loss of my son.

1360
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:02,603
And, uh‐‐

1361
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,447
I don't know what else
to say about it.

[Nanette] <i>Mm‐hmm.</i>

Is it DNA tested?

1364
01:19:45,789 --> 01:19:49,129
We do not have the level
of forensic expertise

1365
01:19:49,129 --> 01:19:52,168
to prosecute a crime like that.

1366
01:19:52,168 --> 01:19:54,372
‐ [Nanette] Right.
‐ That is a matter of fact.

1367
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:57,178
We've barely begun
to touch fingerprinting,

1368
01:19:57,178 --> 01:19:58,648
that sort of thing.

1369
01:19:58,648 --> 01:20:00,000
And our murder/conviction rate
is below 3%.

1370
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,224
And our murder/conviction rate
is below 3%.

1371
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,770
‐ [Nanette] Really?
‐ No.

1372
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:35,656
[Nanette] <i>And who was</i>

1380
01:21:26,289 --> 01:21:28,026

‐ [Nanette] He was asking

01:21:28,026 --> 01:21:30,000
to put money
in people's bank accounts?

1382

to put money

1383
01:21:38,515 --> 01:21:40,886
[Nanette] So, tell me about
what happened

1384
01:21:40,886 --> 01:21:42,523
with Greg Faull.

1385

1392
01:22:55,735 --> 01:22:57,639
[Nanette]
And what was he like?

1393
01:23:00,377 --> 01:23:01,614
You know, this, that.

1394
01:23:07,559 --> 01:23:11,567
[Nanette] Any time in that
period that Greg was killed,

1395
01:23:11,567 --> 01:23:15,775
did you ever see Eddie Mac,
or MAC‐10 at the house?

1396
01:23:15,775 --> 01:23:18,280
He wasn't there the night
dog was poisoned.

1397
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,552
In morning he was there.

1398

1400
01:23:25,695 --> 01:23:28,568
<i>I only saw him, like,</i>
<i>just I got a glimpse of him.</i>

1401

He was in the hall
talking to him.

1402
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:30,905
He was in the hall
talking to him.

1403
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:33,043
And I just came in,
got a juice,

1404
01:23:33,043 --> 01:23:34,546
and I went back in the room.

1405
01:23:34,546 --> 01:23:36,416
[Nanette] Did you ever
see him again?

1406
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:37,886
No, I never saw him again.

1407

[Nanette] To do what?

1408
01:23:52,114 --> 01:23:54,520

[Nanette] Well,
I've looked into that.

1419
01:24:41,379 --> 01:24:43,651
Okay, all right.
Where were you

1420
01:24:43,651 --> 01:24:46,557
when Greg Faull was killed?

1421
01:24:46,557 --> 01:24:49,797
So can you tell me
the real story?

1422
01:24:49,797 --> 01:24:51,967
So around that time,
did John ask you

1423
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:54,205
to do something
and give you any money?

1424
01:24:54,205 --> 01:24:57,178
Like $5,000?

1425
01:24:57,178 --> 01:24:58,981
‐ [Nanette] Mm‐hmm.
‐ No.

1426
01:24:58,981 --> 01:25:00,000
‐ [Nanette] No?
‐ No, never.

1427
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,552
‐ [Nanette] No?
‐ No, never.

1428
01:25:05,427 --> 01:25:06,764
[Nanette]
Why are you smiling?

1429
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:15,615
‐ [Nanette] No?
‐ No.

1430
01:25:15,615 --> 01:25:17,284
[Nanette]
So you didn't get $5,000

1431
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:19,890
wired into your account?

1432
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:23,163
So some people said
they saw you that night.

1433
01:25:23,163 --> 01:25:25,902
And‐‐and you went
to John's house.

1434
01:25:25,902 --> 01:25:27,404
No.

1435
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:30,000
‐ Oh, no. Never.
‐ [Nanette] Never?

1436
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,312
‐ Oh, no. Never.
‐ [Nanette] Never?

1437
01:25:31,312 --> 01:25:33,551
‐ Never.
‐ [Nanette] Okay.

1438
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:40,565
[Nanette] So you
were not hired by John

1439
01:25:40,565 --> 01:25:42,769
‐ to kill Greg Faull?
‐ No, no. Never.

1440
01:25:44,673 --> 01:25:46,376
[Nanette] And if you were,
would you tell me?

1441
01:25:46,376 --> 01:25:47,545
No, I‐‐well‐‐

1442
01:25:52,555 --> 01:25:54,358
[Nanette] Mm‐hmm.
All right‐‐

1443
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,233
[Nanette] So I‐‐
I'm just trying to understand

1444
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:00,000
why someone would say this.

1445
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,203
why someone would say this.

1446
01:26:02,441 --> 01:26:03,778
‐ [Nanette] I cannot tell you.
