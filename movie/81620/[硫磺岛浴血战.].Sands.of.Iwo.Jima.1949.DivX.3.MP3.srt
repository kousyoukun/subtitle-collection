1
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:55,779
This is the story of a squad of marines,
a rifle squad.

2
00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:59,692
I'm Corporal Robert Dunne,
a member of that squad.

3
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:03,605
We were at Guadalcanal,
and when it was secure

4
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:08,851
we were pulled out for rest, refitting,
replacements and retraining.

5
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:13,305
The Marine Corps is long on training
and retraining...

6
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:15,427
Let that go.

7
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:19,757
After the canal, we were sent to
Camp Paekakariki in New Zealand.

8
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:24,503
Here we received our replacements,
marines from Stateside,

9
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:29,456
a long way from Stateside, 8,000 miles.

10
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:36,700
I can see you're a man
who knows how to live.

11
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,989
- Solid comfort.
- Solid malaria.

12
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:44,318
- Malaria, huh? Contagious?
- No, not this week. You can stay.

13
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:49,063
Nice place you got here.
Regazzi's my name, Benny Regazzi.

14
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:51,519
Bob Dunne. I'm duty NCO today.

15
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:55,849
Great. Meet my friends. This big guy
is "Handsome" Dan Shipley.

16
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:58,097
- Hi.
- What a physique!

17
00:02:58,305 --> 00:03:03,175
The girls see him and faint. He comes
through this, I'll make him a movie star!

18
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:06,631
Those two guys, Flynns.
That's Eddie and that's Frank.

19
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,878
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hello, Bob.

20
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:11,626
They don't drink. I got their beer ration.

21
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:14,998
- And Georgie Hellenopolis, an Irishman.
- Hello, sport.

22
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:18,620
- Where did you get those cards?
- Off your sack on the ship. Why?

23
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:23,323
- They're mine, that's why.
- I've seen lots in those bags that aren't.

24
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:26,404
- Come on, give me.
- "Semper fi", Mac.

25
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:30,817
- Hey!
- Leave them. It happens 20 times a day.

26
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:38,976
You know where those guys come from?
Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.

27
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:45,845
- By the way, who's the squad leader?
- Sergeant Stryker.

28
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,092
- What's he like?
- You'll find out.

29
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:51,631
I've been in New Zealand two hours
and already they're clamming up on me.

30
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,955
- I hope he knows his stuff.
- Maybe we'll get liberty.

31
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:07,159
- We ain't replacements any more.
- Where is he? Where's the sergeant?

32
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,406
He's here.

33
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:13,195
- Well, what do you know? Stryker.
- Hello, Thomas.

34
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:18,231
- Thought you were in the First.
- I was. Sit down.

35
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,687
Just sit down, Thomas, anywhere.

36
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:30,429
My name is Stryker,
Sergeant John M Stryker.

37
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:33,552
You're gonna be my squad, a rifle squad.

38
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,547
Three of us have seen action: Corporal
Dunne, Charlie Bass and myself.

39
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:42,876
You'll learn from us. In boot camp
you learned out of a book.

40
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:48,996
Here you gotta remember the book and
learn things that haven't been printed.

41
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:51,243
You gotta learn right and fast.

42
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:58,654
Any man that doesn't want to cooperate,
I'll make him wish he hadn't been born.

43
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:03,607
Before I'm through with you, you're
gonna move and think like one man.

44
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:08,853
If you don't, you'll be dead.
You guys have had a nice easy day.

45
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:14,389
I hope you enjoyed it because
it's the last one you'll get for a long time.

46
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:19,134
You joined the Marines to fight and
you'll get your chance. I'll show you how.

47
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:23,922
If I can't teach you one way, I'll teach you
another. But I'll get the job done.

48
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,252
The skipper of this outfit
is Captain Joyce.

49
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:32,165
Platoon leader is Lieutenant Baker.
Platoon sergeant is Sergeant Wright.

50
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,412
Any questions?

51
00:05:35,828 --> 00:05:37,867
That's all.

52
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:45,319
10,000 sergeants in this corps
and I draw Stryker!

53
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:47,650
You knew this guy before?

54
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:52,313
Yeah. We were stationed
together in China.

55
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:56,184
Twice he kept me from promotion.
Turned me in once.

56
00:05:56,393 --> 00:06:02,221
30 days I got.
He was a sergeant major then.

57
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,676
Must have done something to get busted
to three stripes.

58
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:08,548
What did he turn you in for?

59
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:14,542
For... That's not important!
What's important is that he turned me in!

60
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:19,330
Maybe he didn't write the manual, but
you can bet he can recite it backwards!

61
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:26,656
- It's probably tattooed on his chest.
- Front and back, Mac.

62
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:30,403
- Say, isn't your name Al Thomas?
- Yeah.

63
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:33,691
- Weren't you a fighter?
- Just in the Marines.

64
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,728
- Runner-up in the heavyweight division.
- Tell him who you were runner-up to.

65
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:43,349
Stryker. Lucky punch.

66
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:46,097
Meet your new manager.

67
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,926
Tell him why you lost your stripes.

68
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:55,796
My natural dislike for you is
gradually developing into a great hate.

69
00:06:56,005 --> 00:07:00,750
Don't let this guy do your thinking.
You'll get a square deal from Stryker.

70
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,081
You bet. Square deal.

71
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:09,076
I'm looking forward to the first time
he and I come head to head off duty.

72
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:12,988
Hey, take it easy
with that hand, champ!

73
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:17,859
Saddle up!

74
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:10,352
- All right, take a break.
- Take a break.

75
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:19,469
- How does your squad look?
- See me in about six months. Conway!

76
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:29,793
I was checking the records.
Your father was Colonel Sam Conway.

77
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:35,288
- What if he was?
- I was with him ten months ago.

78
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:38,452
He was my CO before he got killed.

79
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:43,156
One of the best officers and finest men
I ever served under.

80
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:47,069
- I thought if you...
- Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.

81
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:58,267
- For that, you sleep with your rifle.
- It was an accident.

82
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:01,764
- Nobody in this outfit drops their rifle.
- Fall in!

83
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:05,344
All right, saddle up. Pick it up.

84
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:10,589
Sometimes I don't know
which I hate worse, him or the Nips.

85
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:19,248
- Your father was a good marine.
- Until ten months ago.

86
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:24,910
- You shipped in when he was killed.
- I shipped in because I was expected to.

87
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:28,947
In war the men of my family
join the Marines.

88
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:32,111
I'm the last Conway, so here I am.

89
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,066
He'd be proud that
you're carrying on the tradition.

90
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:40,729
Not my father. He'd have expected me
to find some soft duty somewhere.

91
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:44,558
- In fact, he told me so.
- I don't get it.

92
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:49,762
I embarrassed my father. I wasn't
tough enough for him. Too soft.

93
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,506
"No guts" was the phrase he used.
He wanted me to be like Stryker.

94
00:09:55,715 --> 00:10:01,876
"The finest man I ever served under."
I bet they got along just fine.

95
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:07,662
Both with ramrods strapped on their
backs. I'm a civilian, not a marine.

96
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:12,033
They're not going to strap one on mine.
I'm in here strictly for tradition.

97
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:15,197
- That the only reason?
- Yeah. Why?

98
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:19,234
Nothing... Stryker knows his business.

99
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:21,690
So did Jack the Ripper.

100
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,896
Knock off the skylarking.
You're in the wrong column.

101
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:33,513
Left foot close in there.

102
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:35,470
Look alive!

103
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,413
Choynski, you're all left feet!

104
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:56,658
Choynski! What do you think
you're doing?

105
00:10:56,868 --> 00:11:00,572
- Running the bayonet course, sir.
- Not in this league.

106
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:02,820
Yes, sir.

107
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,815
Your men are pretty ragged, Stryker.

108
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:11,062
Yes, sir.

109
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:17,265
That ought to take some starch
out of Stryker. His boys didn't do so well.

110
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:21,095
Hanging him up between those poles,
we'd do a lot better.

111
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:25,674
Choynski!

112
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:28,380
OK, so I'm left-handed.

113
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,669
- On guard. Give me your rifle.
- What is this?

114
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:36,581
You can't learn the easy way, you'll learn
the hard way. Make a thrust.

115
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:40,202
- Without a scabbard?
- You heard me.

116
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:44,989
- You mean this way?
- Yeah, like this!

117
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:51,359
You get the idea? Corpsman!

118
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,271
All right, saddle up.
We'll do it again. Pick it up.

119
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:08,593
You're the only unkissable guy in camp.

120
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:15,004
This thing hurts. It ain't funny. No dame's
going to come near a mouth like this.

121
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:19,292
Don't worry, I got the scoop.
No liberty for three months. You got time.

122
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,204
- Three months? How did you get that?
- I got spies everywhere.

123
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:28,075
They ought to throw the book at Stryker
for doing this.

124
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:32,488
They won't. They'll give him a citation
for teaching us to be good marines.

125
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:35,069
Choynski!

126
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:41,188
They tell me you're going to live.
You were lucky today.

127
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:46,975
Someone had been instructing you that
didn't like you, you might not have been.

128
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:52,178
You better put in a little homework
on that bayonet course.

129
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:59,088
Somebody who didn't like me? I wonder
what he does to the guys he hates.

130
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:06,374
365 days in a year and
I gotta pick this one to nick myself!

131
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:08,705
You need a blow torch on your stubble.

132
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,451
Look who's putting out the scuttlebutt.
No liberty, he says!

133
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,740
Somebody made a mistake.
You got no kick coming.

134
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:19,362
You have, so don't go turning your back.

135
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:26,730
Will we take Hollywood
with them physiques!

136
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:31,226
- First Platoon!
- That's for me!

137
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:37,595
- Here, Wright, any mail for Stryker?
- No.

138
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:39,968
It's going to be rugged again tonight.

139
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:43,256
He won't solve his problems
with whiskey.

140
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:46,545
What would you do
if your wife left with your kid?

141
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:50,875
- After five years I'd forget it.
- Stryker's not much on forgetting.

142
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,866
- Sorry, no letter for you.
- I know it.

143
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:07,193
You know ten-year-olds. There could be
a thousand reasons why he didn't write.

144
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:09,608
- A million.
- Cut it out.

145
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:13,687
- Cut what out?
- Brushing me. The kid's all right.

146
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:18,100
- Maybe Mary influenced him not to.
- That she wouldn't do.

147
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:21,013
Of course not.

148
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:25,010
Stryker, you're a very unusual character.

149
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:28,299
- Can this be love?
- You know what I mean.

150
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:35,583
A lot of guys wouldn't see that a woman
needs a husband who's not always away.

151
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:40,953
A woman wants a home and a guy
to come in and out on time every day.

152
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:45,824
- You can tell me to shut up.
- If you can't talk to me, who can?

153
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:49,737
- Don't do it, just for once, don't do it.
- Do what?

154
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:54,858
Don't start out to get blind, staggering,
stinking, falling down drunk.

155
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:59,187
Nobody starts out to get blind,
staggering, stinking, falling down drunk.

156
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:02,476
Some do. Why not leave
half your dough with me?

157
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:06,555
You got an old maid's failings. You worry.

158
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:11,967
Don't try to follow me tonight or I'll put
a dent in that ugly head of yours.

159
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,129
- Ready?
- Just a minute.

160
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:17,753
- What's up?
- Nothing.

161
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:22,416
Benny didn't strip his M1 fast enough
for Stryker, so he turned him in.

162
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:24,871
They cancelled his liberty.

163
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,532
Perhaps our sergeant hasn't got a heart
of gold after all, but he certainly is...

164
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:37,194
You talk too much. You think I restricted
Flynn for my own amusement?

165
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:43,604
The punishment's unreasonable,
to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake.

166
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:48,850
I'm gonna tell you something, Conway.
I'm gonna tell all of you.

167
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:52,846
I'm gonna make it simple
so you'll all understand it.

168
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:57,092
They handed me you guys as a present,
a regular Easter basket.

169
00:15:57,301 --> 00:16:01,713
They told me to get you into shape
so you can handle a piece of this war.

170
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:08,624
That's what I'm gonna do and that means
I'm gonna tell you what to do every day,

171
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:12,661
how to button your buttons
and when to blow your noses.

172
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:18,614
If you do something I don't like I'm gonna
jump and when I land it'll hurt.

173
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:25,774
I'll ride you until you can't stand up.
When you do, you'll be marines.

174
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:28,855
Flynn stays here.

175
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:36,889
Extra-hard product of a hard school.
Tough luck, Flynn.

176
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:40,261
- If my brother doesn't go, I'm not going.
- Shut up!

177
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:42,967
- Who are you telling to shut up?
- You!

178
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:48,337
Let's go before we all lose our liberty.
I wanna see those Wellington babes.

179
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:16,394
- How do you feel, boy?
- Like a little bird with feathers on it.

180
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:21,764
- Don't fly away, little bird.
- I can't. I'm still in the egg.

181
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:27,551
Beautiful, beautiful! I wanna dance.

182
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,966
You're gonna sit down.

183
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:34,461
Yes, ma'am, Tennessee,
that's where I come from.

184
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,999
The greatest state in the Union.
They call it the volunteer state.

185
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:45,618
Right there is where I'm from.
Smithville, Tennessee, what a town!

186
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:51,113
These are all my cousins on my mama's
side and these are on my papa's side.

187
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,111
We got the best tobacco there is, too.

188
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:00,230
More fertiliser comes from Tennessee
than any other place in the world.

189
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:05,142
Listen to that band! Zombies!
They're all dead.

190
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,471
- Maybe they like music that way here.
- Or don't know any other kind.

191
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,633
- I'm talking these boys into a session.
- Maybe they don't have it in them.

192
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:18,422
After I'm through, they will.
They're breaking my heart.

193
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,710
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!

194
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,778
- There is a happy man.
- Wait until tomorrow.

195
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:42,149
- Don't be a killjoy, dance. I'll watch him.
- I'm not much on dancing.

196
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:46,062
- You might try just this once.
- No, thanks.

197
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,860
- Pete's my name, Pete Conway.
- Allison.

198
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:29,689
- Hello, Allison.
- Hello, Pete.

199
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:50,462
- You're warm. Want to sit down?
- No. I don't want to lose you.

200
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:53,751
- Cutting in.
- Shove off, Mac.

201
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,586
What would you say if I suggested
we get some air?

202
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:42,747
I'd say I'm not supposed to leave the club
with servicemen, but to you I'd say yes.

203
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:49,949
Now what?
We know all about each other.

204
00:20:50,158 --> 00:20:55,361
- You'll be missing your train.
- I'll float back on thin air.

205
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,442
Don't do that. You might catch cold.

206
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,771
Funny, I've just met you and I feel
I've known you all my life.

207
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,602
I feel that way, too.

208
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,473
- Ten thousand miles away.
- Not now.

209
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,845
I wanna see you again,
every time I get liberty.

210
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:16,550
I'll be here.

211
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,713
- Allison...
- Yes?

212
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:23,876
...l'm glad I met you tonight.

213
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:38,822
- The train...
- I know.

214
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:43,275
I'll walk you to the station.
I can get a taxi from there.

215
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:45,898
- No, I'll walk you home.
- No.

216
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:50,353
You might miss your train.
I might not see you again for a long time.

217
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:59,053
Any time I get liberty, she says, just call
her up. Man, what a barmaid!

218
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:04,672
- I'll finish the war right here.
- Drink any more and you probably will!

219
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:11,042
New Zealand ain't got rats because
they killed them all with that whiskey!

220
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,914
We'll drink worse before we get through.

221
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:19,118
They may bury me at sea tomorrow,
but tonight I got that nice, warm feeling.

222
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:22,573
I got a great future
for the next two hours.

223
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:25,529
You're bleeding!

224
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:27,110
Lipstick!

225
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:30,357
- Hey, fellas, look what I found!
- Hey, sports...

226
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:33,563
...look.

227
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,850
- Boy, he's really carrying a load!
- Gyrene!

228
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:43,887
Hey, Mac, you're a little off your course.

229
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:50,006
- Well, what do you know! Stryker.
- He's sure a mess.

230
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:54,794
Now I know what happened
to those stripes. Come on.

231
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:02,744
Shore Patrol.

232
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:07,240
- That's what it is. Give me a hand.
- You're going to help him?

233
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:12,402
If he cut my mother's throat five minutes
ago, I wouldn't let them get him.

234
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:17,939
What a break! He's all set to drop two
stripes and Shore Patrol shows up.

235
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:24,100
- But look what he done to me!
- Don't tell me he kissed you.

236
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,057
That's a great one!

237
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:31,260
Did I tell you about the guy on a train
and the funniest thing happened...

238
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:36,089
- I don't know why you're helping him.
- I'll take care of it.

239
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:40,585
- Where did you come from?
- Never mind. He don't need you guys.

240
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:44,830
- How do you like that?
- He must follow Stryker like a little dog.

241
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,535
What do you care?
At least he took him off our hands.

242
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:56,737
A day after our leave, we drew a 22-mile
hike over terrain carefully selected.

243
00:23:56,945 --> 00:24:02,023
All uphill, and it was a weary bunch of
marines who pitched tents that night

244
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,437
and gratefully folded themselves inside.

245
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:21,339
Do you believe in love at first sight?

246
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:24,128
All kinds.

247
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,875
I never did before but I sure do now.

248
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:35,118
- Why do you have to tell me now?
- Because I'm thinking about it now.

249
00:24:35,327 --> 00:24:39,406
- I'm gonna marry that girl.
- What girl?

250
00:24:39,615 --> 00:24:44,901
- The girl I met last night.
- You'll feel better in the morning.

251
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,730
I couldn't feel any better
than I do right now.

252
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:55,267
I've been thinking, why do men
get married during a war?

253
00:24:55,475 --> 00:24:59,970
- Don't know.
- It's the worst time.

254
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:04,882
I fooled around
but I never thought about marriage.

255
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:08,712
I know a lot of girls
back in the States but...

256
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:13,874
...I think it's because when you get
out here you're close to things.

257
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:18,787
You realise way down inside, no matter
how much you try not to think about it,

258
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:23,199
that maybe something's
got your number on...

259
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:27,404
...and you want to leave
a bit of yourself behind.

260
00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:33,731
Doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl,
just so long as you won't be forgotten.

261
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,434
There'll be someone who'd never
have lived if it hadn't been for you.

262
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:44,096
Am I right?

263
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:50,258
I think I'm right.

264
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,529
- Hey, Conway, got a pass?
- I have.

265
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,943
All right, hop in. I'll give you a lift.

266
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:29,264
- I hear you got a girl in town.
- What if I have?

267
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:34,342
- They say she's a very nice girl.
- They talk too much.

268
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,631
Are you serious about her?

269
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:46,041
With things the way they are, this is no
time to start getting serious with a girl.

270
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:51,161
Don't know how long you're gonna
be here or when you'll be back again.

271
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:53,949
Don't even know how long you'll live.

272
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:58,445
If it's in the line of duty, you can tell me
to do something and I'll do it.

273
00:26:58,654 --> 00:27:01,817
As for my personal life,
keep your hands off.

274
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:05,397
- Your father would've said it.
- I wouldn't have listened.

275
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:08,145
- You never did.
- How do you know?

276
00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:12,017
- He told me.
- What did he say?

277
00:27:12,225 --> 00:27:15,971
I'll tell you. He said
I was a disappointment, right?

278
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,134
He said I wouldn't be able
to stand up for myself, right?

279
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:23,839
- You're doing the talking.
- No, my father is.

280
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:29,084
Every time you open your mouth, he's
talking. Every thought you think is his.

281
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:32,623
It's as though he's at my shoulder.

282
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:36,993
But he didn't always say
or think the right thing.

283
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:43,862
You're gonna find that out when the
time comes. Until then leave me alone.

284
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:46,943
- You want a lift or not?
- Yeah, sure.

285
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,767
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Why?

286
00:27:56,976 --> 00:28:02,054
- You've hardly said a word.
- You're right. I've been thinking.

287
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,301
- About us?
- Myself.

288
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,716
That's selfish.

289
00:28:07,924 --> 00:28:11,129
Honey, do you think I'm a brave man?

290
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:15,833
- What a funny question to ask.
- Well, do you?

291
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:19,080
I don't know. Why?

292
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:24,076
- I've got to prove something to someone.
- Who?

293
00:28:24,284 --> 00:28:27,364
You don't know him. He's dead now.

294
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:32,526
Yes, Pete, I think you're brave.

295
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:36,856
That helps. You don't know
how much that helps.

296
00:28:37,064 --> 00:28:40,102
Let's not talk about it any more.

297
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:45,556
We should have been talking about
ourselves all this time,

298
00:28:45,764 --> 00:28:47,803
what's going to happen to us.

299
00:28:48,012 --> 00:28:52,133
- What do you want to happen?
- I want to marry you.

300
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:55,089
I want that, too.

301
00:28:57,129 --> 00:29:00,417
Funny, we barely know each other.

302
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,702
We see each other for what seems
only moments. And yet...

303
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:10,783
I know what you mean.

304
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:32,471
- Choynski, not going to the wedding?
- No.

305
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:39,507
I'd better get a transfer. I can't learn
this bayonet business. I'm all thumbs.

306
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:46,417
- On guard.
- No, Sarge, not again!

307
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:50,121
- I'm not well from the last time.
- On guard!

308
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,864
- Play that thing again. You lead.
- What?

309
00:30:00,238 --> 00:30:02,111
You lead!

310
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:11,894
Shift your weight.

311
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:15,973
Left, left!

312
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:26,130
There. Keep it up.
You'll get the knack of it.

313
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:29,627
Practise that
about a half an hour every day.

314
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:54,605
Hey, Sarge! I got it!

315
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:09,591
I haven't been in church since I was 14.

316
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:14,711
- Kissing the bride's a great invention.
- Sure makes me homesick.

317
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,042
- What's the matter?
- He looks the same.

318
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,411
- How do you expect him to look?
- Married, wrinkled, worried, like me.

319
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,533
- 44 hours and 34 minutes left. Go!
- Excuse me, sports.

320
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:32,403
Here's your wedding present
from the gang.

321
00:31:32,612 --> 00:31:34,818
You've all been wonderful.

322
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:39,022
- Are you sure you've got the right guy?
- I'm sure.

323
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,853
Come on, get going!

324
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:55,341
- "Sempre felice", Mac!
- Keep the situation well in hand, Pete!

325
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:59,586
We got 44 hours and 33 minutes.
What are we gonna do?

326
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:02,750
Al, if I was a girl, I'd marry you.

327
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:05,956
Knock it off! I've had a hard day.

328
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:08,536
What am I doing?

329
00:32:10,202 --> 00:32:15,030
44 hours and 32 minutes.
That isn't very long, is it?

330
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:18,694
No, not long at all.

331
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:23,232
I wonder how many other people
have had 44 hours and 32 minutes.

332
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,270
Lots I guess.

333
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:30,392
- We'll make it seem a long time.
- Years.

334
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:43,255
- Shall I open it?
- Sure, go ahead.

335
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,159
They're in a hurry!

336
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:58,657
Others were in a hurry.

337
00:32:58,866 --> 00:33:03,986
The order said move out
and the Marines moved out.

338
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:09,440
11 days at sea. Destination?
Only the top brass knew.

339
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:15,351
Though, of course, scuttlebutt knew the
answer, a hundred answers, all wrong.

340
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:20,720
Boat Squad... halt, one, two!

341
00:33:22,178 --> 00:33:24,758
Dismissed!

342
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,377
Too bad you couldn't see her again.
You didn't get long.

343
00:33:31,586 --> 00:33:35,707
We knew it might happen.
I'll be back. I've got to believe that.

344
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:39,038
- Sure. We'll all be back.
- Gangway!

345
00:33:41,494 --> 00:33:48,112
That's no way to carry a flag, Regazzi.
I've got to teach you everything.

346
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:53,316
Now watch this...
What are you gonna do with this, Benny?

347
00:33:53,524 --> 00:33:56,729
I'm gonna put that up in Tokyo,
right in the middle of Times Square.

348
00:33:56,938 --> 00:34:03,848
- There isn't any Times Square in Tokyo.
- There will be when I get there.

349
00:34:04,056 --> 00:34:09,009
Now that's the way to fold a flag,
with the blue field showing.

350
00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:11,257
What do you know!

351
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:17,752
- You got my shirt!
- It's my shirt!

352
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,248
- I'm telling you, it's my shirt!
- It's my shirt!

353
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:30,282
Here, fellas. You'd better
quit fighting so much.

354
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:33,571
If you don't, one of you's apt to get hurt.

355
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:39,065
Corpsman! Corpsman!

356
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:47,142
- What's that?
- Relax. It's the Navy clearing its throat.

357
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,930
Sure don't sound like no squirrel gun.

358
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,301
I hope they practise real good. What
island do you think we're aiming at?

359
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,549
We'll get word.

360
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,670
- Here it is.
- It looks like a pork chop.

361
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,376
- What's its name?
- Tarawa.

362
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:06,082
Never heard of it. It's the wrong place.

363
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:09,205
It's part of an atoll called Tarawa Atoll.

364
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:14,033
This particular island is called Betio.
Don't ask me how you spell it.

365
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:18,363
You'll have to stick your faces into it
but you don't have to spell it.

366
00:35:18,572 --> 00:35:23,942
- This is Red Beach Three. That's us.
- What have they got there?

367
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,271
Everything. This island's held
by a special naval landing force.

368
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:32,850
That means Japanese marines.
They're dug in and they're mean.

369
00:35:33,058 --> 00:35:37,470
They'd just as soon die as stick a nickel
in a jukebox, but that's all right.

370
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,425
Let the other guy die for his country.
You'll live for yours.

371
00:35:44,714 --> 00:35:47,961
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

372
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:50,958
- Get over there.
- I can hear him.

373
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:56,703
Get over there. I don't want anybody
hurt because you didn't listen.

374
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:27,758
- Schoolteacher, do me some homework.
- What's your problem, son?

375
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:32,337
Put down 5,000. Scuttlebutt says
that's how many Nips are on that rock.

376
00:36:32,546 --> 00:36:36,875
- The Navy fired 1,000 tons of shells.
- Don't forget the fly-fly boys.

377
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:40,996
Those B-24s have really
been working them over.

378
00:36:41,204 --> 00:36:45,783
Now add the tons of explosives, divide it
by the Nips and get the answer.

379
00:36:45,992 --> 00:36:50,696
- Maybe we'll be back for noon chow.
- Don't figure that way.

380
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:55,816
The Navy and the fly-fly boys unloaded
plenty on the canal before we went in.

381
00:36:56,024 --> 00:37:00,852
When we got ashore there were still a lot
of those lemon-coloured guys waiting.

382
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:06,555
Only way that island was taken
was by putting marines on the beach.

383
00:37:06,764 --> 00:37:13,133
You've heard the naval foray's a waste
of time and metal. Stryker knows better.

384
00:37:13,342 --> 00:37:18,628
- Who cut you in on this conversation?
- You say when I can and can't talk?

385
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:23,249
- Just when you can't talk to me.
- Knock it off, Conway.

386
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:27,203
I've had enough of your "hardbitten
sergeant" attitude.

387
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:32,365
You're so big everybody's been afraid
to take a punch at you. I'm not!

388
00:37:32,574 --> 00:37:35,279
Cool off!

389
00:37:35,488 --> 00:37:41,690
Forget that pencil and paper routine and
worry about staying alive on that beach.

390
00:37:41,899 --> 00:37:45,853
- Don't expect any soft touch!
- "Now hear this"!

391
00:37:46,062 --> 00:37:50,183
All troops report
to your debarking stations!

392
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:38,680
All right, men, sound off
when your name's called.

393
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:42,301
Now hear this,
there'll be no movies tonight!

394
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:47,992
The place is opened up for business.

395
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:55,609
- Missed!
- Maybe they're firing blanks.

396
00:39:55,818 --> 00:40:00,522
- Maybe a two-headed kid's aiming.
- Maybe this is just manoeuvres.

397
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:29,744
Get out now. We're crossing the line
of departure. Lock and load!

398
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,740
- Good luck, Sarge!
- Charlie, give me a hand here!

399
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:27,650
Lieutenant, hit the deck! How is it?

400
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:29,607
I got hit!

401
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:33,228
Corpsman! You'll be all right.

402
00:41:43,886 --> 00:41:48,132
They got us pinned down!
We can't get over these logs!

403
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,420
- I'm going while I can!
- Stay here, kid!

404
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:12,983
We're gonna be killed here.
I'd like to get at them!

405
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:15,856
Why rush? This is a nice place.

406
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:28,053
- They got the lieutenant!
- They'll get all of us if we don't move.

407
00:42:28,262 --> 00:42:32,299
We are like fish in a barrel lying here.

408
00:42:34,256 --> 00:42:39,875
- Did we train to take it lying down?
- Sarge, do something about it!

409
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,455
Stay where you are until I tell you.

410
00:42:50,616 --> 00:42:53,987
You gotta get us out of here!

411
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:58,733
If you're nervous count your toes.
I'll do the masterminding around here.

412
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:10,514
- Where's Lieutenant Baker?
- Machine-gunned.

413
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:14,511
- Is your squad all right?
- All but one. What's holding us down?

414
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:19,880
That bunker, an old power plant. All
these bombs and they're still killing us.

415
00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:23,918
- Smoke, sir?
- Thanks.

416
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:28,831
I've sent for flame-throwers to assist.
Your squad will support. Follow me!

417
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,244
You heard! Move out and stay down!

418
00:43:56,306 --> 00:43:59,011
We've gotta silence that bunker!

419
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:24,072
Request naval gunfire
be lifted on target areas, coordinates...

420
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:29,068
...two-four-six-zero-sugar-tare. Over.

421
00:44:31,899 --> 00:44:33,938
Roger and out.

422
00:44:48,009 --> 00:44:52,088
Flame-throwers out! Demolition in!

423
00:45:29,055 --> 00:45:31,302
Demolition out!

424
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:48,994
Shipley!

425
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:02,191
Give me a hand with this pack.

426
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,030
Throw it!

427
00:46:59,638 --> 00:47:01,677
Move out!

428
00:47:55,462 --> 00:47:58,292
Get him out of there!

429
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:11,863
- There goes one of your nine.
- Now we got tanks.

430
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:14,652
Better late than never.

431
00:48:14,861 --> 00:48:16,900
Come on!

432
00:48:19,357 --> 00:48:24,019
Corpsman! Corpsman! This way!

433
00:48:24,228 --> 00:48:31,221
Don't wait. They'll find me.
Keep going. Hit 'em for me.

434
00:48:32,345 --> 00:48:35,300
Find Stryker. Stick with him.

435
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:39,005
He's good people.

436
00:48:39,214 --> 00:48:41,919
Tell him I...

437
00:49:25,422 --> 00:49:28,585
I'd like to know
where the rest of the squad went.

438
00:49:28,794 --> 00:49:32,582
- What's this place?
- Whatever it is it ain't healthy!

439
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,330
Let's go!

440
00:49:44,154 --> 00:49:47,817
That was close.
Next time don't be in such a hurry.

441
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,730
- You're across, ain't you?
- Across what? To where?

442
00:49:51,939 --> 00:49:56,476
- I'm running low on ammo.
- I am too.

443
00:49:56,685 --> 00:50:00,806
Forgot about that.
We gotta get some more.

444
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:04,802
- I'll go.
- Wait! Pick a number from one to six.

445
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,382
- Two.
- Five.

446
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:10,629
You're both wrong.

447
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,952
That guy kills me.

448
00:50:32,568 --> 00:50:35,232
Thomas better hurry!

449
00:50:44,183 --> 00:50:47,846
- How about some bandoliers, Mac?
- Help yourself.

450
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:56,171
- How are things going up front?
- Pretty rough.

451
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,460
- Keep it coming.
- Good luck.

452
00:51:11,574 --> 00:51:15,445
- Is that coffee?
- It sure is. Do you want some?

453
00:51:17,236 --> 00:51:20,316
Do I want some, he says!

454
00:51:22,315 --> 00:51:26,436
I haven't had any joe
since we left the ship.

455
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:36,509
You mortarmen sure live
the life of Riley here.

456
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,757
Here you are.

457
00:51:44,336 --> 00:51:46,625
Beautiful!

458
00:51:50,872 --> 00:51:53,494
- Where's Thomas?
- Probably dead.

459
00:51:53,703 --> 00:51:56,825
No, not that guy. Let's get out of here!

460
00:52:17,472 --> 00:52:22,425
- Can I have some for my buddies?
- Sure. Break out your canteen.

461
00:52:22,634 --> 00:52:26,338
Tell me, how's everything been going?

462
00:52:27,963 --> 00:52:32,209
Couldn't be better, Mac.
Oh, this is the life!

463
00:52:37,704 --> 00:52:42,782
Come and get it, you guys!
Ammo and fresh hot joe!

464
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:44,323
Hellenopolis!

465
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,570
Bass!

466
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,461
Hey, Greek!

467
00:53:19,707 --> 00:53:21,788
Hey, Greek!

468
00:53:24,578 --> 00:53:28,324
- What kepts you, Thomas?
- Where's Bass?

469
00:53:28,532 --> 00:53:30,363
Gutted.

470
00:53:30,572 --> 00:53:32,944
No ammo.

471
00:53:33,986 --> 00:53:36,691
What kept you, sports?

472
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:03,042
Major Crowe, sir.

473
00:54:05,665 --> 00:54:09,245
- Jim? How you doing?
- "It's tough going, Dave".

474
00:54:09,453 --> 00:54:13,282
I've committed every man.
We're dug in and staying.

475
00:54:13,491 --> 00:54:20,401
Good. I've been getting reports all day
that the Nips are slipping in to your front.

476
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:27,353
If it's "banzai" tonight,
target area 2-41 is a hot spot.

477
00:54:27,562 --> 00:54:30,434
What outfit have you got there?

478
00:54:31,974 --> 00:54:34,430
Joyce and Stryker.

479
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:38,593
Pass the word they gotta dig in
and stay put.

480
00:54:38,801 --> 00:54:41,298
No noise or movement.

481
00:54:41,507 --> 00:54:48,750
Don't risk anybody unless you have to.
Hold on until we get more men there.

482
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,121
Yes, sir.

483
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:58,824
Major Crowe says the Nips have been
filtering into these tank traps.

484
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:02,238
Disperse your squad along this section.

485
00:55:02,447 --> 00:55:07,400
Tell your men there's to be no smoking,
no moving or unnecessary talking.

486
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:11,729
If they find out how thin we are,
they can get to the beach.

487
00:55:11,938 --> 00:55:16,891
That's a platoon area. All I got's
a beat-up squad, short three men.

488
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,180
- Couldn't you...?
- Can I give you three men?

489
00:55:20,388 --> 00:55:25,758
The battalion can't give the whole
company three replacements.

490
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:29,630
Your squad is covering
the hottest spot in the line.

491
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:35,083
If it's an attack tonight they'll strike you
first. They want to know our disposition.

492
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:38,538
I repeat, your men are not to move.

493
00:55:38,747 --> 00:55:44,033
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Stryker, we're going to hold this line.

494
00:55:44,242 --> 00:55:47,738
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Good luck.

495
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,643
All right, saddle up. Follow me.

496
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:03,516
Everybody go!

497
00:56:08,636 --> 00:56:14,130
Drop off at intervals, two-man foxholes.
We're gonna be spread out thin tonight.

498
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:21,332
Don't give away your position or strength.
You Flynns stay here, and no quarrels.

499
00:56:24,288 --> 00:56:28,117
Dunne and Smith, drop out here.

500
00:56:28,326 --> 00:56:32,114
No gab tonight!

501
00:56:35,195 --> 00:56:38,317
You and Harris here! Come on, Conway.

502
00:56:58,673 --> 00:57:00,712
Corpsman!

503
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,960
Listen.

504
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:09,580
- Corpsman!
- That's a marine.

505
00:57:12,827 --> 00:57:14,908
Corpsman!

506
00:57:18,947 --> 00:57:22,027
- Stryker!
- Get down and stay down!

507
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:25,690
- You had your orders!
- Somebody's wounded!

508
00:57:25,899 --> 00:57:28,188
- Quiet.
- Let's get him!

509
00:57:28,396 --> 00:57:33,016
Stay down! It may be an old Jap trick.
They pulled it on the canal.

510
00:57:33,225 --> 00:57:39,885
- It doesn't sound like a Jap to me.
- I don't care. You'll tip our position.

511
00:57:43,091 --> 00:57:45,047
Stryker!

512
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:49,002
It's Bass!
How many Japs know your name?

513
00:57:49,211 --> 00:57:51,292
- You know his voice.
- Shut up.

514
00:57:54,373 --> 00:57:58,702
Aren't you human at all?
A friend of yours may be dying!

515
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,533
Knock it off!

516
00:58:00,742 --> 00:58:04,863
This is what my father taught you.
Be a great marine, be tough.

517
00:58:05,071 --> 00:58:10,565
Sit here if you want. I'm getting him.
The only way you'll stop me is to kill me.

518
00:58:10,774 --> 00:58:13,604
That's just what I'll do!

519
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:36,375
Stryker!

520
00:58:38,332 --> 00:58:39,955
Stryker!

521
00:58:48,531 --> 00:58:50,570
Sarge!

522
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:54,900
Stryker!

523
00:58:59,979 --> 00:59:02,143
Please, Sarge!

524
00:59:12,509 --> 00:59:19,003
Tarawa was officially declared secure
at 13.30 on the fourth day of battle.

525
00:59:19,212 --> 00:59:25,123
The replacements came ashore,
our wounded were cared for

526
00:59:25,331 --> 00:59:29,035
and the assault troops were relieved.

527
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:42,772
- How am I doing, Chaplain?
- God has been good to you.

528
00:59:42,981 --> 00:59:45,437
You're going home.

529
00:59:46,562 --> 00:59:51,557
Per istam Sanctam Unctionem,
et suam piisimam,

530
00:59:51,765 --> 00:59:56,843
indulgeat tibi Dominus
"quidquid deliquisti. Amen".

531
01:00:22,903 --> 01:00:25,900
Somebody beat me to it.

532
01:01:10,193 --> 01:01:15,063
Skipper gave out some news.
Part of it's good, part of it's bad.

533
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:19,185
- They found Hellenopolis. He's dead.
- He was a good Greek.

534
01:01:19,393 --> 01:01:24,180
Choynski, Soames and Bass are on
a hospital ship Stateside-bound.

535
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,469
- I wish I was with them.
- Let's get cleaned up.

536
01:01:27,677 --> 01:01:31,798
Wash out those dungarees
and let's look like marines.

537
01:01:35,545 --> 01:01:38,417
You too, Thomas.

538
01:01:44,245 --> 01:01:46,368
- Dunne.
- Yeah?

539
01:01:49,616 --> 01:01:54,403
I got a couple of bottles of sake
in my gear. Give it to the squad.

540
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:58,690
- Right.
- Tell them you got it off a dead Nip.

541
01:01:58,899 --> 01:02:02,270
Why don't you break down a little?

542
01:02:02,479 --> 01:02:05,101
You got it off a dead Nip.

543
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:07,433
Aye, aye.

544
01:02:30,203 --> 01:02:34,657
- What's eating you?
- Know what Stryker plans tomorrow?

545
01:02:34,866 --> 01:02:39,153
Another squad problem
and I'm so tired of problems!

546
01:02:39,362 --> 01:02:43,566
I'm tired of Stryker!
I'm also tired of beautiful Hawaii.

547
01:02:43,774 --> 01:02:45,813
Me, too.

548
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:52,016
Hey, champ, what do you think
of beautiful Hawaii?

549
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:58,510
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Clamming up again, ever since Tarawa.

550
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:01,258
- Why the silence?
- Knock it off!

551
01:03:01,466 --> 01:03:06,586
- Hi! You got room for me?
- What do you know!

552
01:03:06,795 --> 01:03:09,667
- You got time off for good behaviour?
- Yeah.

553
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:13,996
- Where were you? Pearl Harbor?
- Yeah, nice place. Pretty nurses.

554
01:03:14,205 --> 01:03:17,618
I'll give somebody $5
to shoot me in the foot.

555
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:20,782
- I'll do it for $2.50.
- You're too willing!

556
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:24,570
Some replacements out here
assigned to our squad.

557
01:03:24,778 --> 01:03:28,482
We build up the joint
and they come and live in it.

558
01:03:28,692 --> 01:03:32,188
This is Stein and Fowler and McHugh.

559
01:03:32,397 --> 01:03:37,475
He's Fowler. Mike McHugh, from Cedar
Rapids to see this war's over in a hurry.

560
01:03:37,683 --> 01:03:40,139
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

561
01:03:40,348 --> 01:03:43,928
- How old?
- Well, eighteen... going on eighteen.

562
01:03:44,136 --> 01:03:47,216
We heard that the squad leader's tough.

563
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:52,835
- There are rumours to that effect.
- Tough sergeants roll off my knife!

564
01:03:53,044 --> 01:03:58,955
You're gonna find your first few days
with Sergeant Stryker very interesting.

565
01:03:59,164 --> 01:04:02,244
You new men come with me.

566
01:04:09,737 --> 01:04:14,108
- Attention!
- Charlie! How are you?

567
01:04:14,316 --> 01:04:17,479
- Certified fit for duty, so the medics say.
- Good.

568
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:21,143
The replacements came up with me.

569
01:04:21,352 --> 01:04:23,808
They get younger all the time.

570
01:04:24,016 --> 01:04:26,888
- Or we're getting older.
- Or both.

571
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:30,426
- I can stand having you back.
- I can stand being back.

572
01:04:30,635 --> 01:04:34,797
What happened to the squad, besides
the Greek, Shipley and Thomas?

573
01:04:35,006 --> 01:04:38,627
Choynski...
Thomas? He never got a scratch.

574
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:43,581
- I was sure he got it.
- Why?

575
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:49,243
When we got stuck in a trench he went
back to get ammo. Never came back.

576
01:04:49,451 --> 01:04:54,196
How long between the time he went back
and you got overrun?

577
01:04:54,405 --> 01:04:56,944
About 40 minutes.

578
01:04:57,152 --> 01:04:59,191
40 minutes?

579
01:05:00,441 --> 01:05:02,480
Stay here.

580
01:05:10,515 --> 01:05:13,054
Thomas!

581
01:05:13,263 --> 01:05:16,301
- Yeah?
- Outside.

582
01:05:26,043 --> 01:05:30,039
- What's that about?
- Don't ask me. I haven't any spies.

583
01:05:31,704 --> 01:05:34,534
- That's far enough.
- What's this about?

584
01:05:34,743 --> 01:05:37,157
Just that I hate your guts!

585
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,428
Get up.

586
01:06:00,594 --> 01:06:05,422
You doped off and got one of my men
killed and one of them bayoneted!

587
01:06:05,631 --> 01:06:08,753
- You haven't had enough. Get up!
- Stryker...

588
01:06:09,794 --> 01:06:12,583
Attention! All right, break it up.

589
01:06:15,081 --> 01:06:19,160
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Stryker. Able Company, sir.

590
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:20,784
And you?

591
01:06:20,992 --> 01:06:25,363
Pfc Thomas. Able Company, sir.

592
01:06:25,571 --> 01:06:30,732
This may take some explaining before
a court martial. Help that man up.

593
01:06:38,476 --> 01:06:41,681
- You'll need medical attention.
- I'll be OK, sir.

594
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:47,468
That's debatable. You know it's not
permissible for an NCO to strike a man?

595
01:06:47,676 --> 01:06:50,340
- Yes, sir.
- Who struck the first blow?

596
01:06:53,213 --> 01:06:56,917
Colonel, there wasn't any first blow
struck exactly.

597
01:06:57,126 --> 01:07:00,206
A simultaneous explosion perhaps?

598
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:05,784
Judo, sir. The sergeant was showing me
how to break a judo hold.

599
01:07:05,993 --> 01:07:09,947
No more judo exhibitions.
Understand, Sergeant?

600
01:07:10,156 --> 01:07:12,237
Aye, aye, sir.

601
01:07:21,146 --> 01:07:23,810
At least you're no stool pigeon.

602
01:07:24,018 --> 01:07:26,557
Wait a minute, Stryker.

603
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,762
I'm wrong, dead wrong. I know it.

604
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:36,756
I doped off for some coffee,
but I didn't think a few minutes mattered.

605
01:07:36,964 --> 01:07:41,043
- It did!
- I know that now, but I didn't then.

606
01:07:41,252 --> 01:07:43,749
It's killing me. I can't sleep.

607
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:50,119
A hundred times I wanted to tell you,
tell somebody. I...

608
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:55,114
I liked that Greek...
I'd do anything for him.

609
01:07:56,530 --> 01:08:01,067
If I could I'd change him
for me right now.

610
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:04,272
I think you would.

611
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:10,975
Guys make mistakes but every one
we make, a stack of chips goes with it.

612
01:08:11,183 --> 01:08:15,304
We make a mistake
and some guy don't walk away!

613
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:18,634
For evermore he don't walk away.

614
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:23,754
I guess all we can do is just take it...

615
01:08:25,045 --> 01:08:29,707
...and hope we don't make
the same mistake again.

616
01:08:29,916 --> 01:08:31,747
I won't.

617
01:08:37,118 --> 01:08:39,241
Let's get back.

618
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:45,693
Mail call! First Platoon.

619
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:55,309
A letter from my wife after 18 months.
Know where she is?

620
01:08:55,517 --> 01:08:58,181
In England, entertaining troops.

621
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:04,009
Entertaining troops? Why isn't she here
entertaining me? I'm a troop.

622
01:09:04,218 --> 01:09:10,004
"They're all such nice boys. There's
a lieutenant here..." A lieutenant!

623
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:16,622
When I get back she'll need standing
up for a month! I put on muscle lately!

624
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:26,988
Darling, this is a funny way for a man
to find out he's a father, but you are.

625
01:09:27,197 --> 01:09:32,067
It happened the day before yesterday,
just in time for breakfast.

626
01:09:32,276 --> 01:09:36,813
He's a boy and looks beautiful like me
and intelligent like you.

627
01:09:37,021 --> 01:09:43,889
I should have told you it was going to
happen, but I didn't want to worry you.

628
01:09:44,098 --> 01:09:48,843
I don't know what to call him.
We never discussed that.

629
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:53,173
- I'm a father! Hey, I'm a father!
- Let's see!

630
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:58,043
- I'm a father!
- All right, let's fall in!

631
01:10:01,082 --> 01:10:02,705
Come on!

632
01:10:08,534 --> 01:10:12,863
Finally we got our leave.
Ten days in Honolulu.

633
01:10:13,072 --> 01:10:17,318
All of us were out on the town.
All except Stryker.

634
01:10:17,526 --> 01:10:20,231
He was still the same.

635
01:10:40,047 --> 01:10:43,835
- Lonesome?
- Drift.

636
01:10:48,997 --> 01:10:51,702
- Whiskey.
- Two?

637
01:10:51,911 --> 01:10:56,240
- Please.
- OK.

638
01:10:56,448 --> 01:11:01,443
Thanks. A drink'll be good. I'm tired.
It's been a rough day...

639
01:11:01,652 --> 01:11:04,274
Knock it off!

640
01:11:04,483 --> 01:11:07,355
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

641
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,682
- Right.
- Thanks.

642
01:11:15,764 --> 01:11:20,426
65 cents for a drink. It's too much.
They cheat servicemen.

643
01:11:22,425 --> 01:11:25,172
We could drink cheaper at my house.

644
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,169
Don't throw your arm out of joint.

645
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:37,119
Thanks for the drink. I didn't mean
to make too much buzzing in your ear.

646
01:11:37,328 --> 01:11:40,200
It's all right, finish your drink.

647
01:11:45,487 --> 01:11:51,398
- I didn't mean to sound so tough.
- I know. You're just unhappy.

648
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,142
Me, too.

649
01:11:59,391 --> 01:12:01,472
My name's Mary.

650
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:07,674
The long arm of coincidence,
or something.

651
01:12:08,882 --> 01:12:10,921
Her name, too.

652
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:16,958
That invitation still hold?

653
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:33,484
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll fix us a drink.

654
01:12:41,394 --> 01:12:45,765
Oh, dear!
Well, I can get us some more in a jiffy.

655
01:12:54,132 --> 01:12:56,171
I see.

656
01:12:58,129 --> 01:13:00,834
Will a sawbuck do it?

657
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:05,039
Go on, take it. It's only paper.

658
01:13:06,579 --> 01:13:09,617
Well, I'll be right back.

659
01:14:16,266 --> 01:14:20,970
- I hope this is your brand.
- Any brand is mine.

660
01:14:34,665 --> 01:14:38,702
- She says she's hungry.
- He.

661
01:14:41,118 --> 01:14:43,990
Advise him against joining the Marines.

662
01:14:50,734 --> 01:14:57,061
Mummy's fixing you something. Her
boy'll be quiet while she has company.

663
01:14:57,270 --> 01:15:01,765
Knock it off...
Where's his father?

664
01:15:03,139 --> 01:15:05,178
Gone.

665
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:12,755
Well, I guess into each life
a little rain must fall.

666
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:23,370
There are a lot tougher ways
of making a living than going to war.

667
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,528
You know about babies.

668
01:15:35,693 --> 01:15:38,315
Yeah, I know about babies.

669
01:15:59,879 --> 01:16:01,502
So long, Mac.

670
01:16:06,998 --> 01:16:11,535
- Wait!
- I can't spend it on a coral reef.

671
01:16:11,743 --> 01:16:17,571
- You're a very good man.
- You'll get odds on that in the Marines.

672
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:19,818
So long.

673
01:16:21,068 --> 01:16:24,523
So long, Sergeant. I'll pray for you.

674
01:16:24,731 --> 01:16:28,186
Let's not get religion.

675
01:16:28,395 --> 01:16:32,058
- I'll pray for you, Sergeant!
- Good luck.

676
01:16:35,638 --> 01:16:40,591
You got a lot of bloodhound in you,
Charlie, but you can call off the dogs.

677
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,589
I'm smarter than I was 30 minutes ago.

678
01:16:43,797 --> 01:16:46,835
Catch me feeling sorry for myself again

679
01:16:47,044 --> 01:16:50,332
and you got my permission
to belt me in the nose!

680
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:54,287
- Buy you a drink?
- Lock and load, boy!

681
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:04,694
- Thanks!
- Two bourbon and ice.

682
01:17:09,815 --> 01:17:12,895
- A baby's a big event.
- Conway!

683
01:17:16,975 --> 01:17:20,763
- Treating the boys?
- Crack open the hatch!

684
01:17:20,972 --> 01:17:26,633
That's great. A fellow always gets
more kick out of a boy, I guess.

685
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:30,462
I got a kid. Sam, I named him...

686
01:17:33,086 --> 01:17:35,125
...after your old man.

687
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:39,537
Wait till he gets to be ten and doesn't
write. You'll be mad enough to hit him.

688
01:17:39,746 --> 01:17:45,032
No, I won't, Stryker, because he won't
have to write. I'll be where he is.

689
01:17:45,241 --> 01:17:50,069
And I won't insist that he be tough.
I'll try to make him intelligent.

690
01:17:50,278 --> 01:17:55,981
And I won't insist that he read the Marine
Corps manual. I'll get him Shakespeare.

691
01:17:56,189 --> 01:17:59,935
I don't want him to be a Colonel Conway
or Sergeant Stryker.

692
01:18:00,144 --> 01:18:05,555
I want him to be intelligent, considerate,
cultured and a gentleman.

693
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:09,177
- You're out of line, kid.
- Let him be. He has a right to dislike me.

694
01:18:09,386 --> 01:18:12,924
Thanks, and I intend
to exercise that right.

695
01:18:13,132 --> 01:18:18,460
- I don't like you, Stryker.
- Let's talk sense for a minute, Conway.

696
01:18:18,669 --> 01:18:21,583
I can't have friction in the squad.

697
01:18:21,791 --> 01:18:27,660
I've tried every approach to you that I
know. Got nowhere. You're intelligent...

698
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:32,489
Don't patronise me. Your opinion of
my IQ doesn't interest me in the least.

699
01:18:32,698 --> 01:18:38,650
Let's get this straight.
On duty I jump when you holler.

700
01:18:38,859 --> 01:18:43,188
Off duty I exercise my God-given rights
under a democracy

701
01:18:43,396 --> 01:18:46,226
and dislike whom I please.

702
01:18:47,476 --> 01:18:50,556
Do we understand each other?

703
01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:00,671
- Beat it.
- Come on, you guys, let's go.

704
01:19:12,286 --> 01:19:15,366
I don't understand
why you don't belt him.

705
01:19:15,575 --> 01:19:19,529
- Mellow in my old age, I guess.
- Too bad.

706
01:19:19,738 --> 01:19:22,652
"Screaming Sam"
couldn't be proud of him.

707
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:28,479
He could. There's something inside
a guy, always proud of a kid.

708
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:31,268
- Two more?
- Not for me.

709
01:19:31,477 --> 01:19:34,515
- I'll sail again. One.
- OK.

710
01:19:34,724 --> 01:19:38,137
- Maybe you can steer me home?
- Charge!

711
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,300
Pull pins!

712
01:19:43,508 --> 01:19:45,589
Prepare to throw!

713
01:19:45,797 --> 01:19:47,836
Throw!

714
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:57,494
- All right, fifth relay!
- What an arm!

715
01:19:57,703 --> 01:20:00,283
Pick it up!

716
01:20:00,492 --> 01:20:03,114
Right in the groove!

717
01:20:03,323 --> 01:20:06,694
- Look, boy, this is a live grenade.
- Gee!

718
01:20:06,903 --> 01:20:10,607
- You know what they can do?
- Yes, sir.

719
01:20:10,816 --> 01:20:17,018
Right hand. Wait for the order
to pull pin and pitch grenade.

720
01:20:17,227 --> 01:20:19,141
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

721
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:21,389
Ready?

722
01:20:22,847 --> 01:20:24,845
Pull pin!

723
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:27,509
Prepare to throw!

724
01:20:27,717 --> 01:20:30,214
Throw!

725
01:20:32,671 --> 01:20:35,293
Grenade! Hit the deck!

726
01:20:41,788 --> 01:20:47,782
When will you wake up? You wanna see
her again, keep your mind on your work!

727
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:52,152
- What happened here?
- Little accident, sir.

728
01:20:52,361 --> 01:20:55,399
You're wounded. Corpsman!

729
01:20:55,609 --> 01:20:58,772
- Yes, sir.
- Take care of the sergeant.

730
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:02,060
Come right over here, Sergeant.

731
01:21:03,227 --> 01:21:07,348
You may not know it,
but you just got your life saved.

732
01:21:07,556 --> 01:21:09,595
You'll get a medal.

733
01:21:11,885 --> 01:21:15,132
Again the word came
and the Marines moved out.

734
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:19,461
Again scuttlebutt knew a hundred
destinations, all wrong.

735
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:23,874
This time we were a sound fighting unit,
blooded and trained.

736
01:21:24,082 --> 01:21:27,953
Tarawa had blooded us.
Stryker had trained us.

737
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:43,731
- Now, I'll show you something.
- What you got there?

738
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:46,103
- What does it look like?
- A flag.

739
01:21:46,312 --> 01:21:51,473
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Occupy this island in the USA's name.

740
01:21:51,682 --> 01:21:55,886
- You think we'll have an easy time?
- You got me with you.

741
01:21:56,095 --> 01:22:00,882
- Maybe we need two of you.
- One was enough in Tarawa.

742
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:04,794
Stick with me.
I'm a battle-hardened veteran.

743
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:10,831
Know how many Japs I knocked off
in Tarawa? 32. Did I get anything for it?

744
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:13,869
I got enemies in Washington.

745
01:22:14,078 --> 01:22:17,782
If the Marines didn't have me,
they'd never have made it.

746
01:22:17,991 --> 01:22:21,820
Now, this is how you fold a flag!

747
01:22:24,985 --> 01:22:27,857
Do you believe in intuition?

748
01:22:28,066 --> 01:22:31,729
Yeah... in women. Why?

749
01:22:31,937 --> 01:22:36,308
It's hard to explain. I've a feeling
I'm not coming out of this operation.

750
01:22:36,516 --> 01:22:39,055
Don't talk that way.

751
01:22:39,264 --> 01:22:42,802
- I can't help it. It's the way I feel.
- Why?

752
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:47,589
I don't know. It's like a voice in my ear.
I can't shake the feeling off.

753
01:22:47,798 --> 01:22:50,462
Take my advice, shake it off.

754
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:56,914
No dice. When things like that get in you,
it's no use trying to fight them.

755
01:23:04,324 --> 01:23:07,779
If a marine waits long enough
he gets the word.

756
01:23:07,987 --> 01:23:12,108
Our sealed orders came aboard
after five days at sea.

757
01:23:14,232 --> 01:23:17,146
This island is volcanic and sandy.

758
01:23:17,354 --> 01:23:21,891
It's five and a half miles long
and two and a half miles wide.

759
01:23:22,099 --> 01:23:27,136
This mountain here
is a dead volcano. It's called Suribachi.

760
01:23:27,345 --> 01:23:33,173
There's nothing on the island except
three airfields and about 20,000 Japs.

761
01:23:34,255 --> 01:23:39,583
The Army Air Corps B-24s have been
bombing this place for 62 days.

762
01:23:39,792 --> 01:23:44,329
- Maybe it'll be an easy operation then.
- We can't be sure.

763
01:23:44,537 --> 01:23:47,992
Every yard is covered
by some kind of fire.

764
01:23:48,201 --> 01:23:54,445
There are two possible landing beaches,
one on the east side, one on the west.

765
01:23:54,653 --> 01:23:58,108
The rest of the coastline is cliffs.

766
01:23:58,316 --> 01:24:00,439
They'll try and keep us off the beaches.

767
01:24:00,648 --> 01:24:04,685
If they don't, they'll try and catch us
at this first airfield,

768
01:24:04,894 --> 01:24:10,097
between the heights of Suribachi
and these high rocky ridges in the north.

769
01:24:10,305 --> 01:24:16,382
They'll shell us from both sides. Nobody
knows what they've got on this island.

770
01:24:16,591 --> 01:24:19,713
But they've had 40 years to put it there.

771
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:25,624
Saipan was our last stop.

772
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:30,412
The men who were going to hit
the beach first transferred to LS Ts.

773
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:34,866
A few more days at sea
and the time for landing came.

774
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,281
Saddle up!

775
01:25:22,489 --> 01:25:25,569
Skip along and into the amtracs.

776
01:26:24,224 --> 01:26:27,387
Anyway, it's a good day for it.

777
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:30,634
- It's cold.
- Stick around, it'll get warm.

778
01:26:30,843 --> 01:26:34,631
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
Hey, look!

779
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:44,622
- Driver, you the joker that wrote that?
- "Semper fi", Mac!

780
01:26:44,831 --> 01:26:47,911
We should take you in along with us.

781
01:26:49,868 --> 01:26:55,487
Hey, McHugh's going in with his pocket
full of books! Five books he's got!

782
01:26:55,696 --> 01:26:59,609
So? The kid's a reader.
That shouldn't worry a dope like you.

783
01:26:59,817 --> 01:27:05,228
When we're through with this operation,
I'm gonna break both your legs!

784
01:27:19,466 --> 01:27:24,752
- I feel sick.
- I know. I felt the same way at Tarawa.

785
01:27:24,961 --> 01:27:28,208
Hey, Stein, "Shalom aleychem".

786
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:31,163
Aleychem shalom.

787
01:27:33,994 --> 01:27:37,698
- Sarge, I'm scared.
- So am I.

788
01:27:37,907 --> 01:27:42,819
- Not you!
- Fowler, I'm always scared.

789
01:27:43,027 --> 01:27:45,941
Line of departure! Get down!

790
01:27:46,149 --> 01:27:51,394
Lock and load! Drop those lifebelts
when we hit the beach!

791
01:28:38,851 --> 01:28:41,723
All right, hit the beach!

792
01:29:24,268 --> 01:29:26,224
It ain't Brooklyn!

793
01:29:26,433 --> 01:29:30,720
If this place was a blanket
I'd pull it over my head!

794
01:29:30,929 --> 01:29:36,132
This is the poorest soil I ever saw. What
does anyone want an island like this for?

795
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,379
- That's war.
- What's war?

796
01:29:38,588 --> 01:29:40,794
Trading real estate for men.

797
01:29:41,003 --> 01:29:47,122
When God made the world, he must
have put all the rubbish left over here.

798
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:50,410
Corpsman! Corpsman! Take it easy.

799
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:55,572
Doggone it, almost the same place
they got me before!

800
01:29:57,196 --> 01:29:59,235
Getting shot for this!

801
01:30:00,402 --> 01:30:03,940
They're sure pouring it into Suribachi.

802
01:30:09,685 --> 01:30:14,638
Not enough. Those Nips
are shooting right down our throats.

803
01:30:14,847 --> 01:30:18,094
- Stryker!
- Yo!

804
01:30:20,841 --> 01:30:24,795
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.
- Lieutenant Shrier?

805
01:30:26,419 --> 01:30:27,917
Stand fast.

806
01:30:41,073 --> 01:30:43,612
- Stryker reporting, sir.
- I know.

807
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:48,149
Your platoon's been hit hard.
What's left has been assigned to me.

808
01:30:48,358 --> 01:30:52,437
- Yes, sir.
- Naval gunfire lifts at 1100. Stand by.

809
01:30:52,645 --> 01:30:53,977
Aye, aye.

810
01:31:16,249 --> 01:31:18,621
Move out!

811
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:21,660
Keep your distance!

812
01:33:02,152 --> 01:33:07,105
- Go on, go on!
- Corpsman! Corpsman! Corpsman!

813
01:33:10,145 --> 01:33:13,017
Spread out! Dig in!

814
01:33:22,009 --> 01:33:26,962
- Dunne, where's my brother?
- Back there. He's hit.

815
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:32,041
Flynn!

816
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:43,988
That's enough!

817
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:54,895
I told you you'd need this bad
some day. Thanks, Marine.

818
01:34:02,222 --> 01:34:04,261
Flynn! Get down!

819
01:34:07,176 --> 01:34:14,086
- You ain't got the sense of a rabbit!
- You can still be a hero crawling!

820
01:34:14,294 --> 01:34:19,164
- Corpsman!
- Ma'll dust me off if I don't get him back!

821
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:23,411
Harris!

822
01:34:26,783 --> 01:34:30,862
Well, I'll get a good night's sleep tonight.

823
01:34:31,071 --> 01:34:33,277
Corpsman!

824
01:34:33,485 --> 01:34:35,857
He won't need him.

825
01:34:51,635 --> 01:34:55,381
- Pillbox too big to handle with these.
- A bazooka?

826
01:34:55,590 --> 01:35:01,209
- If we had one.
- I got nothing to do. I'll go pick one up.

827
01:35:39,217 --> 01:35:41,298
Regazzi didn't make it.

828
01:35:41,506 --> 01:35:44,836
You never know what's happening.

829
01:35:45,045 --> 01:35:47,126
Listen.

830
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:52,413
- It's a tank.
- Yeah, but whose?

831
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,492
Ours!

832
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:20,928
It's Regazzi.

833
01:36:41,743 --> 01:36:44,657
Pillbox at 2 o'clock.

834
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:52,565
OK, give 'em a hot foot!

835
01:37:04,971 --> 01:37:07,010
Thanks, Mac.

836
01:37:12,964 --> 01:37:17,876
- I couldn't find a bazooka.
- You did all right. Saddle up!

837
01:37:51,429 --> 01:37:57,506
No one had ever seen anything like it.
No one would have believed it possible.

838
01:37:57,715 --> 01:38:00,837
That smoking, miserable, bloody island.

839
01:38:07,747 --> 01:38:11,909
After three days and three nights,
and at the end of that time,

840
01:38:12,118 --> 01:38:18,029
we'd barely reached the foot of
Suribachi, where we were the first day.

841
01:38:23,608 --> 01:38:27,104
- We'll sack here for the night.
- Best news today.

842
01:38:27,313 --> 01:38:32,058
Pair off and one man awake at all times.
Keep alert. Let's go.

843
01:38:43,173 --> 01:38:46,295
It'll start getting rough tomorrow
against Suribachi.

844
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:51,083
It started getting rough
when you put on that uniform.

845
01:38:51,291 --> 01:38:54,621
You wanna see a good-looking kid?

846
01:38:55,995 --> 01:38:58,700
Husky little boot. What's his name?

847
01:38:58,909 --> 01:39:03,363
We're gonna name him Sam,
Sam Conway.

848
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:08,732
A name that's been awarded the Navy
Cross is good enough for any kid.

849
01:39:08,941 --> 01:39:14,311
There's something I've been trying
to say but... I can't find the words.

850
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:19,640
Two universities and you can't find
the words to say you were out of line?

851
01:39:19,848 --> 01:39:25,342
- OK, I'm out of line.
- No, you were. There's a difference.

852
01:39:28,382 --> 01:39:33,169
We'd better get some sack time.
Wanna sleep first or watch?

853
01:39:33,377 --> 01:39:36,041
- I'll watch.
- OK.

854
01:39:40,329 --> 01:39:44,700
Everybody gets out of line
once in a while.

855
01:39:46,574 --> 01:39:48,197
Thanks, gyrene.

856
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:54,025
Where's Sergeant Stryker?

857
01:39:54,233 --> 01:39:57,022
- Stryker?
- Right there.

858
01:39:59,853 --> 01:40:03,807
- What do you want?
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.

859
01:40:06,805 --> 01:40:08,844
- Stryker, sir.
- Yes, sir.

860
01:40:09,053 --> 01:40:11,384
I'm taking a patrol up Suribachi.

861
01:40:11,592 --> 01:40:15,005
Get your men squared away
and be ready at 0700.

862
01:40:15,214 --> 01:40:19,460
- The rendezvous is that Nip tank there.
- Aye, aye, sir, 0700.

863
01:40:29,243 --> 01:40:33,364
That little voice whispering
in your ear again?

864
01:40:33,572 --> 01:40:38,276
Don't worry. I've known
a million guys that have heard it.

865
01:40:38,484 --> 01:40:43,645
Most of them make it. A few don't.
The percentage is on your side.

866
01:40:43,854 --> 01:40:47,767
- Did you ever hear it?
- No.

867
01:40:47,976 --> 01:40:52,097
- Don't you ever worry about it?
- What good would it do?

868
01:40:52,305 --> 01:40:56,218
- You're indestructible.
- Stick close. It might rub off!

869
01:40:56,426 --> 01:40:58,091
I'll do that.

870
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:04,710
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Patrol is
ready to move. Request supporting fire.

871
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:38,790
Ow!

872
01:43:18,047 --> 01:43:25,623
Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai elohenu...
Adonai echad.

873
01:43:27,122 --> 01:43:29,161
Amen.

874
01:44:20,323 --> 01:44:22,446
Radio!

875
01:44:25,443 --> 01:44:28,856
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Over.

876
01:44:29,065 --> 01:44:34,559
This is Easy Five. Cease fire,
we're preparing to move over the top.

877
01:44:36,808 --> 01:44:41,387
- Roger and out. Stryker!
- Yes, sir.

878
01:44:41,595 --> 01:44:45,924
Colonel's ordered that we put up this flag
when the top's secure. Get it there.

879
01:44:46,133 --> 01:44:48,380
Aye, aye, sir.

880
01:44:51,544 --> 01:44:53,625
What is this?

881
01:44:53,834 --> 01:44:57,414
Put yours away.
This is the one we're gonna use.

882
01:44:57,622 --> 01:45:03,366
First squad. Find something we can use
as a standard and we'll put this up.

883
01:45:10,194 --> 01:45:14,315
- Conway, you made it.
- I guess that little voice was wrong.

884
01:45:14,523 --> 01:45:17,520
- I feel better.
- I feel better, too.

885
01:45:17,729 --> 01:45:21,475
I never felt so good in my life.
How about a cigarette?

886
01:45:37,919 --> 01:45:40,499
- Is he...?
- Yeah.

887
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:44,954
If he had to get it
it's the way he'd have wanted.

888
01:45:50,282 --> 01:45:53,237
It's a letter to his kid.

889
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:07,308
"Dear son, I guess none of my letters
have reached you.

890
01:46:07,517 --> 01:46:10,306
"I thought I'd try again as I'm feeling

891
01:46:10,514 --> 01:46:15,717
"that this may be the last
time I can write you.

892
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,629
"For a long time
I've wanted to tell you many things.

893
01:46:20,838 --> 01:46:23,210
"Now that you're a big boy, I will.

894
01:46:24,293 --> 01:46:27,207
"If we'd been together even for a while,

895
01:46:27,415 --> 01:46:33,243
"I could've explained many things
much better than writing them.

896
01:46:33,451 --> 01:46:39,403
"You've gotta take care of your mother,
and love her and make her happy.

897
01:46:39,612 --> 01:46:42,734
"Never hurt her or anyone as I did.

898
01:46:44,941 --> 01:46:48,271
"Always do what your heart
tells you is right.

899
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:53,849
"Maybe someone will write you some day
and tell you about me.

900
01:46:54,057 --> 01:47:00,384
"I want you to be like me in some
things, but not like me in others.

901
01:47:00,593 --> 01:47:06,254
"When you grow older and get to know
more about me, you'll see I've failed...

902
01:47:07,753 --> 01:47:10,333
"...in many ways.

903
01:47:10,542 --> 01:47:15,495
"This isn't what I wanted
but things just turned out that way.

904
01:47:15,704 --> 01:47:18,951
"If there was only more time I..."

905
01:47:22,823 --> 01:47:25,237
Guess he never finished it.

906
01:47:33,938 --> 01:47:37,185
I'll finish it for him.

907
01:47:45,677 --> 01:47:48,174
There she goes.

908
01:48:42,625 --> 01:48:46,205
All right, saddle up!
Let's get back in the war!
