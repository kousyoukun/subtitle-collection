1
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,054
Okay, Abrams.

2
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,893
Allende.

3
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,938
Bernstein.

4
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,143
Brown.

5
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,148
Come on, come on.

6
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,280
Attaboy, Todd

7
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,202
Buckley.

8
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:02,993
Cohen.

9
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,460
Garcia.

10
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,970
Paul.

11
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,321
Take a seat, Lisa.

12
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,448
I just wanted to take a minute to
talk to you about your test.

13
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,531
Sure.

14
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,951
Now, I know you had a little help.

15
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,038
Well, I mean, I didn't cheat,
if that's what you mean.

16
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,464
I'm just saying I know
you had a little help.

17
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,041
A lot of people did.

18
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,136
Well, be that as it may...

19
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,055
I mean, I'll take it over
again if you want,

20
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,091
but, like, what would be the point?

21
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,176
It's not like I'm ever gonna actually

22
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,178
need to know this stuff in my daily life.

23
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,265
Well, that's just not necessarily
true, Lisa.

24
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,187
Haven't you ever developed
an interest in something

25
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,734
that you didn't initially think

26
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,315
you were gonna develop an interest in?

27
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,486
Um...

28
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,189
No, not really.

29
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,444
Haven't you ever...

30
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,864
Haven't you ever been put
in a new situation

31
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:25,497
and found that after overcoming
its difficulties,

32
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,669
you had developed a new set of skills

33
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,542
and new experiences along the way?

34
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,339
No, I really haven't.

35
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,707
Okay.

36
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,427
Anyway, it was open-book.

37
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:39,177
So, what's the difference
between using a book

38
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,679
and, like, I don't know, using
somebody else's mind

39
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,101
who's really good at math?

40
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,895
I mean, it's not like this person
did the whole test for me.

41
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,063
Oh, no?

42
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,272
No, I did some of it.

43
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,773
Well, next time I'd appreciate
it if you did it all.

44
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:53,937
Okay?

45
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,773
You are so fair.

46
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,826
What did he say to you?

47
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,028
Nothing.

48
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,116
Mr. Aaron and I have an understanding
about my math problem.

49
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,582
So the President of the United
States, William B. McKinley,

50
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,248
authorizes the use of private detectives
to break the strike

51
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,001
and they went out there and shot 'em down!

52
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,378
Just like they did in Virginia,

53
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,555
just like they did in Pennsylvania.

54
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,052
Because they didn't care!

55
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,343
They did not care!

56
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,644
And that's basically it.

57
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,639
That's basically all there is to say.

58
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,767
All right? Go ahead.

59
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,648
Uh, Becky.
- Well...

60
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,025
Mr. Klein! I mean, was there ever, like,

61
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,194
a good president of the United States?

62
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,909
I don't know, Becky.

63
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,369
I think that's a good question.

64
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,946
What do you think?

65
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,161
You. Lionel. What do you think?

66
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,997
Did we ever have a good president?

67
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,920
Um... I don't know.

68
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,291
I guess most of them have just
been, like, totally corrupt.

69
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,792
Lisa?

70
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,050
Can I just say that I'm not necessarily,
like, a big fan

71
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,632
of all the presidents
of the United States,

72
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,513
especially the current one.

73
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,686
But I still don't think it's
necessarily all that useful

74
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,605
to categorize every president
as universally corrupt,

75
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,229
because that just seems
really general to me.

76
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,561
Especially if you're gonna
judge them by the standard

77
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,612
of whatever they're supposed
to traditionally be like

78
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,689
in some mythical version of America

79
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,821
that probably never existed to begin with.

80
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,573
Lisa has raised a salient point.

81
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,746
Tell him to be polite, tell him
to answer the questions,

82
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,170
and I'll arrange for his bail
in the morning. Yes.

83
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,915
Hey, how'd you do?

84
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,423
Hey, Darren. It was fine.
Thank you so much.

85
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,300
So he didn't give you a
hard time or anything?

86
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,097
Well, he knows I'm not planning

87
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,970
to go into mathematics or anything.

88
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,930
He was totally cool about it.

89
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,477
He's so cool.

90
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,930
Oh, yeah, everybody loves Mr. Aaron.

91
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,099
What's that supposed to mean?

92
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,728
Nothing. The man is very lovable.

93
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,612
What are you doing now?

94
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,070
I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.

95
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,821
Why?

96
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,245
Because my dad is supposed
to take me and my brother

97
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,577
to this ranch in New Mexico
to go horseback riding

98
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,333
and I don't think it would be right

99
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,171
to appear on horseback in New Mexico

100
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,717
without the appropriate equestrian
paraphernalia, Darren.

101
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,169
You wouldn't understand these things.

102
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,925
That is a definite possibility.

103
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,760
Anyway, thanks again.

104
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,306
Well, before you venture forth on your
bizarre quest for a cowboy hat...

105
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,932
Yes, Darren?

106
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,600
What are you up to later?

107
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,772
Like tonight.

108
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,057
I don't know.

109
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,273
You wanna go to a movie?

110
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,609
What, you mean, like on a date?

111
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:47,240
No, not on a date, just go to a movie.

112
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,404
I don't know if it's a fucking date!

113
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,785
All right. Calm down. What
do you wanna see?

114
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,126
I don't know, I don't even
know what's playing.

115
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,125
I don't know if it's a date.

116
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,300
Let's just forget about it. I hate
the fuckin' movies anyway.

117
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,002
They're just bullshit.
They're all bullshit!

118
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,804
Okay, take it easy. I'm sorry.
I was just asking!

119
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,519
What if it was a date, anyway?

120
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,638
Would that be so horrendous?

121
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,316
Oh, my God. Are you like...

122
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,027
Are you asking me out?

123
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,613
I don't know. Are you?

124
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,324
Yeah. I mean...

125
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,084
I feel like we're already really close...

126
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,160
Oh, my God.

127
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,666
...and I think we'd be
a really good match.

128
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,715
Well, I would definitely have
to think about this.

129
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,422
Absolutely. Give it some thought.

130
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,677
Okay. I will.

131
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,841
Okay.

132
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,186
Why do you look like that?

133
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,521
Like what?

134
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,183
What do you want from me? Not a thing!

135
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,854
AH right. I'll see you later.

136
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,438
All right.

137
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,628
Hello!

138
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,732
Hi.

139
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,275
Is Mom home?

140
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,443
She went to the store.

141
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,033
Hey!

142
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,238
What are you doing tonight?

143
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,875
Nothing. Darren wants me to
go to the movies with him.

144
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,373
Oh, my God. What's that about?

145
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,171
I have no idea.

146
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,269
Becky, there is not a cowboy hat

147
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,062
to be found in the entire Upper West Side.

148
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,189
And I am very depressed about it.

149
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,236
The Upper West Side is saving
you from yourself

150
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,815
because no one wants to
see you in that hat.

151
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,808
Hey! Hey!

152
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,651
Where'd you get...

153
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,156
How you doin”?

154
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,691
Your hat!

155
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,485
What?

156
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,161
Where'd you get your cowboy hat?

157
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,663
What?

158
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,035
What are you, crazy?

159
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,119
Hi.

160
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,501
Where'd you get your cowboy hat?

161
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,298
My hat?

162
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,462
Yeah! Your cowboy hat!

163
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,794
You like my cowboy hat? Really?

164
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,046
Yes! Where did you get it?

165
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,914
Somebody see what happen?

166
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,662
Somebody call an ambulance!

167
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,747
Call an ambulance. Everybody
just step back!

168
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,922
I'm calling one right now!

169
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,124
- Can you hear me?
- Get an ambulance!

170
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,333
Someone's calling one!

171
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,634
Ma'am, can you hear me?

172
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,087
Can you hear me?

173
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,592
I don't know! Where am I?

174
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,298
You're on Broadway and 75th
Street in New York.

175
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,507
Between 75th and 74th Street.

176
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,184
- You were in a bad accident.
- Who are you?

177
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,681
My name is Lisa.

178
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,224
What do you mean? Am I dead?

179
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,681
No, you're not dead.

180
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,516
You were in a traffic accident,
but you're gonna be...

181
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,693
What do you mean? What happened'?

182
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,691
You were run over by a bus.

183
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,779
You've got to be kidding me.

184
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,482
A bus? Yeah.

185
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,942
Is there a doctor anywhere?

186
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,485
Is it still happening?

187
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,615
An ambulance is on its way.

188
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,870
The accident's over.

189
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,162
I think you're a little confused.

190
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,532
I'll say I'm confused.

191
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,992
Here. Let me just try...

192
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,702
No! Don't let go! Ma'am!

193
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,955
Don't let go of me! Don't let go of me.
- I won't.

194
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,881
I won't. I'm not gonna let go.

195
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,208
Thank you. Thank you, honey.

196
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,256
She needs a tourniquet
or she's going to die.

197
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,837
Okay, let me just...

198
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,297
Oh, my God!

199
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,632
Jesus Christ!

200
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,810
Help! God, what's happening to me!

201
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,513
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,564
I'm trying to put a tourniquet on you.

203
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,017
Ma'am, we need to get a tourniquet on you.

204
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,477
Do you have a belt? You can use your belt.

205
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,776
I just can't see where to do it.

206
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,149
You're gonna be all right,
so just hang on.

207
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,440
Thank you, honey. Just don't let go of me.

208
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,237
They're gonna put a tourniquet on you.

209
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,694
What do you mean? Are they doctors'?

210
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,997
No, they're not doctors. They
were just passing by.

211
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,073
Well, get 'em the fuck away from me!

212
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,123
Ma'am!

213
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,247
Ma'am! We're only trying to help you!

214
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,044
Never mind that! Just try
putting it around...

215
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,043
Do you wanna do it? You know how
to do it. You wanna do it?

216
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,715
Are you kidding me!

217
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,633
I can't see anything.

218
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,341
Are my eyes open or closed?

219
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,095
They're open.

220
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,941
What do you mean?

221
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,856
You were in a terrible accident.

222
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,438
But you're gonna be fine,
so just hang on, okay?

223
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:42,317
There's no place to put it.
I can't even find a...

224
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,285
Will somebody call the fucking ambulance!

225
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,953
Calm down! We already called them!

226
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,826
They're obviously not coming fast enough,

227
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,745
so maybe you should call them again!

228
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,201
Why not call them again?

229
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,371
You're gonna be... Could somebody...

230
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,836
Could somebody call my daughter?

231
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,087
Sure! We can call her. What's her name?

232
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,128
Just tell me her name and
give me her number.

233
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,303
It's Lisa.

234
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,723
No, that's my name. Is that
your daughter's name?

235
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,971
What? What are you talking about?

236
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,098
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be confusing.

237
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,180
My name is Lisa. Is that
your daughter's name?

238
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,812
Jesus Christ, just call her!
Would you call her?

239
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,027
I can't call her if you don't
give me the number.

240
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,271
I got it. I got it!

241
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,447
Ma'am?

242
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,150
You're gonna be okay.
- You're gonna be okay!

243
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,576
What's your daughter's number?

244
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,529
Sweetie,

245
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,406
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

246
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,491
Oh, no!

247
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,623
Please hang on. The ambulance
is gonna be here any minute!

248
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,830
So just hang on, okay?

249
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,085
Please!

250
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,419
It's okay.

251
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,835
She's gone.

252
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,256
No! No!

253
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,008
She's gone.

254
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,054
Please let go of me!

255
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,679
Please, let go of me!
Please, let go of me!

256
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,978
Just hang on. They're gonna
be here any minute, okay?

257
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,225
So just hang on!

258
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,185
You're gonna be okay!

259
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,692
You were going the speed limit?

260
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,777
Yeah.

261
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,744
Lisa? You're Lisa? I just want to
ask you a few questions, okay?

262
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,823
Yeah, sure.

263
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,750
Now, just tell me everything you saw,

264
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,999
even if you think it might not
be important. All right?

265
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,081
Think of it like a movie. Like
you're watchin' a movie

266
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,461
in your head...

267
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,834
It was green as I came
to the intersection.

268
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:23,884
Could somebody call my mother?

269
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,961
We already called your mom,

270
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,263
but I'll have 'em put another call
in to your mother right now, okay?

271
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,760
I know this is hard for you,

272
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,217
but we gotta get this while it's
still fresh in your mind, okay?

273
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,677
Some of these questions might seem like

274
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,224
they don't make a lot of sense to you.

275
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,180
They do make sense. Just ask me!

276
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,441
Okay, that's what I'm doin'. All right?

277
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,395
So now I'm gonna ask you, from
where you were standing,

278
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,979
could you see the traffic light?

279
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,075
Could you tell me if it
was red? Yellow? Green?

280
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,367
She just came out of nowhere?

281
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,990
What color was the light?

282
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,327
Boy, I'm sorry...

283
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,541
'Q Q Q

284
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,165
I guess it was green?

285
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,792
Green?

286
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,503
I think it was just an accident.

287
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,474
Where were you at?

288
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,093
I was on Broadway.

289
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,190
What happened to you? Nothing.

290
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,693
Hello?

291
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,208
So, does anybody know who she was?

292
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,673
I don't know. I guess
she lived around here

293
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,842
if she had all these Fairway grocery bags.

294
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,214
What did they do with her leg?

295
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,015
I have no fucking idea. Hey...

296
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,099
Lisa? Are you sure you don't
want me to call in?

297
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,933
Oh, no, thanks.

298
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,269
I mean, thank you. That's really sweet.

299
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,647
But I'm supposed to go see Becky anyway,

300
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,483
and I don't really want to sit here
thinking about it all night.

301
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,364
Go to work. I'll be all right.

302
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,844
- Hey.
- Hey, Darren.

303
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,716
Hey.

304
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,564
Joan? Yeah?

305
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,982
You got some flowers.

306
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,351
Can you bring 'em in?

307
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,689
Oh, that's good. I'm glad
you guys liked it.

308
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,944
You were great.

309
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,868
Well, we have a lot of work
to do, but it'll be good.

310
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,028
The critics are gonna love it.

311
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,118
They don't even know me anymore.

312
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,414
Hey, are you comin' out?

313
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,783
Um... I don't know. I'm not sure.

314
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,992
Come on. Maybe I will.

315
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,543
I don't know if I'm going to. But I might.

316
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,295
See you later. Bye.

317
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,709
Goodnight.
- See you later.

318
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,879
Hi, are you Ramon?

319
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:37,213
Yes. Hello. You were wonderful again.

320
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,846
Oh, you're so sweet. And thank
you for the beautiful flowers.

321
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,347
You're very welcome.

322
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,845
And you've seen the show before?

323
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,475
Yes, two times.

324
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,058
Gosh. That's a lot!

325
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,485
It's a beautiful performance.

326
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,650
I'm sure you will have a big success.

327
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,699
Well, right now, we're just trying
to focus on what we're doing.

328
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,486
I don't know if you are busy,

329
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,367
but would you allow me to buy you a drink?

330
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,369
If you like to ask your friends...

331
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,580
I'm sorry. I can't. I'm
just on my way home.

332
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,748
Okay, that's no problem.

333
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,501
Tomorrow I'm going to London
for a few days.

334
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,627
Perhaps when I come back.

335
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,132
Um...

336
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,760
Yeah. Okay.

337
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,263
I'm sorry. I really have to go.

338
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,848
Okay. That's no problem.

339
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,392
Anyway, thanks again for
the beautiful flowers!

340
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,719
It's a privilege to meet you.

341
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,096
It's nice to meet you, too.

342
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,393
Goodnight. Goodnight.

343
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,560
Hey.

344
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,317
I thought you were at the movies.

345
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,940
Yeah, it wasn't very good.

346
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,781
I was doing a show in Detroit

347
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,703
and this woman came backstage,

348
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,779
and she's like, "Wanna come back

349
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:44,947
"to my place and do some cocaine?"

350
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,499
I was like, "I know the kind of pussy..."

351
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,543
Why you pop in at 4:00 in the morning?

352
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,789
I'll get us thrown out.

353
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,377
Oh, oh. Do the Shirley Temple! Come
on, do the Shirley Temple.

354
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,508
Okay.

355
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,467

That's awesome!

363
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,323
Wait, what's that one? Do the baby.

364
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,657
No, it's too weird.

365
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,992
You have to do the baby.

366
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,116
Some inspiration.

367
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,885
It's so disturbing.

368
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,345
I know. It's too weird.

369
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,421
No, it's not.

370
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,505
Have another drink.

371
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,264
I think we can tell I've had enough.

372
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,732
Matthew, if you would read
the role of France.

373
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,661
And, Anthony, why don't you read Burgundy?

374
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,071
Ah, Burgundy.

375
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,954
And I guess I'm gonna hog
the part of Lear again.

376
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,502
Okay, Anthony?

377
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,878
Uh...

378
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,958
"Royal Majesty, I crave no more

379
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,884
"than what your highness offered,

380
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,677
"nor will you tender less."

381
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,838
"Right, noble Burgundy,

382
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:51,221
"When she was dear to us,
we did hold her so,

383
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,177
"But now her price is fall'n."

384
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,027
My family are from Colombia.

385
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,954
My father worked in the
diplomatic service.

386
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,327
Really? Wow.

387
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:19,287
I grew up five years in Panama
and nine years in Paris.

388
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,338
And what do you do, Ramon?

389
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:25,593
I have a company. We design
computer software

390
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,637
to help companies in South
American countries

391
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,345
that use an incompatible software,

392
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,059
so the computers can talk to each other.

393
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,018
It's a big problem in South America

394
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:43,903
where there is not so much coordination
in computer communication.

395
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,107
Right now is a lot of opportunity for us

396
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,195
because for the big software companies,
we are still the backwoods.

397
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,244
That's changing quite fast.

398
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,587
Can I give you a lift?

399
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:06,384
Oh, no, thank you, I'm just gonna
grab a cab. But thanks.

400
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,466
May I call you sometime?

401
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,099
Okay. Sure, that would be great.

402
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,761
May I have your telephone number?

403
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,942
Mom? Just a minute!

404
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,018
Can I come in?

405
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,144
Just a second, please. Hold on.

406
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:12,858
Come in.

407
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,580
Can I talk to you?

408
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,795
Sure. What's up?

409
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,169
I'm supposed to go back to

410
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,133
the police to confirm my statement

411
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,877
the day after tomorrow.

412
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,797
So what do you think I should do?

413
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,677
Well, I don't know, sweetie.

414
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,640
I mean, that bus driver probably
has a family to support.

415
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,229
He could probably lose his job.

416
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,894
So I think you should really think

417
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,025
about that before you say anything.

418
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,742
Okay?

419
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,820
Yeah.

420
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,451
Think of the implications
of what you're saying.

421
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,162
I'm saying what is the frame of reference

422
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,664
for the average Arab on the street?

423
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,426
Angie. Yeah. My mother's
family is from Syria,

424
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,048
and they're not exactly in love
with the current regime.

425
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,256
And I definitely don't agree with
a lot of their religious views,

426
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,341
especially when it comes to
the oppression of women.

427
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,929
But I just wanna say that
Americans have no idea

428
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,558
how much people hate them
all over the world.

429
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:25,810
It's pretty clear to us now, Angie.

430
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,937
And all my relatives in Syria think what

431
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,152
we did in Afghanistan was terrorism, okay?

432
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,774
Anthony? Not to mention Iraq.

433
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,526
Syria is a theocratic military
dictatorship.

434
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,274
No, it's not. Sorry.

435
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,576
Syria is not a theocratic
military dictatorship?

436
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,324
I think we have a pretty good idea how

437
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,117
much people hate us now, actually, Angie.

438
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,288
No, we don't.

439
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,992
They blew up our city, okay? So, yeah,
I think we have a pretty good idea

440
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,122
and personally, I don't give a shit.

441
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,168
You should.

442
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,712
The people who blew up the World Trade

443
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,297
Center were a bunch of sick monsters.

444
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,339
Oh, they were monsters? Yes!

445
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,416
Why, because they're Arabs?

446
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,967
No, because they killed 3,000
people for no reason.

447
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,134
Maybe they think they had a reason!

448
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,177
One at a time! Like what?

449
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,345
Why did we drop bombs on them?

450
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,588
What should we have done?

451
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,431
- Why did we invade Iraq?
- They declared war on us.

452
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,134
No, they didn't. Iraq didn't
declare war on anybody!

453
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,719
They didn't do anything to us!

454
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,349
Come on, guys, one at a time!

455
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,973
Anthony. They did have a reason.

456
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,023
Thank you.

457
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,521
They wanted to establish a medieval

458
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,064
Islamic caliphate in the Middle East

459
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,987
and destroy Western civilization.

460
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,234
Where did you read that?

461
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,527
It's on their website.

462
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,525
Okay, forget it. Angie!

463
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,609
No! Forget it!

464
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:20,782
Go ahead with what you were saying!

465
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:21,828
No! Why should I?

466
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,076
But why are you defending someone
who murdered 3,000 people?

467
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,328
I'm not!

468
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,034
Why are you defending a country that

469
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,786
unilaterally invaded two Muslim countries

470
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,457
and supports the Israeli
occupation of Palestine?

471
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,084
Give me a break!

472
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,007
And drops bombs on women and children

473
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,299
and then calls other people terrorists

474
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,634
for doing the exact same thing?

475
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,633
Because it's not the same
thing! Yes, it is!

476
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,430
- Come on, guys.
- Lionel! Go ahead.

477
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,015
Yeah, I just want to ask why is
it okay to drop bombs on men

478
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,519
but it's not okay to drop bombs
on women and children?

479
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,896
I mean, isn't that just
like reverse sexism?

480
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,396
I don't know. I agree
it's a bullshit term.

481
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,605
This is totally stupid.

482
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,856
Monica!

483
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,361
I think the whole class should
apologize to Angie, actually,

484
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,071
'cause all she did was express her opinion

485
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,869
about what her relatives in Syria think.

486
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,824
Thank you! And everyone started
screaming at her

487
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,206
like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan!

488
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,539
They are the Ku Klux Klan! They
throw acid in women's faces.

489
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,374
Who? Afghanistans? Why not drop
bombs on the Ku Klux Klan!

490
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,504
Because they're white?

491
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,051
Six people raised their
hands before you, Lisa.

492
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,345
Come on, guys. ANTHONY: The
correct term is Afghans.

493
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,387
Okay, I'm not even saying
I disagree with you.

494
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,060
I'm just saying it's pathetic the way
people in this class treated Angie

495
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,354
just for saying something they
didn't happen to agree with.

496
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,306
Because that's censorship. Right?

497
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,441
Right? It's not censorship!

498
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,276
Right on! This class is
not the government.

499
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,651
It's censorship. Oh, my God, no, it's not!

500
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,152
We work out of Highway
One out in the Bronx.

501
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,828
Near the Bronx Zoo.

502
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,995
Oh, okay.

503
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,246
But for a situation...

504
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,541
Hey, how are you doin'? But
for somethin' like this,

505
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,790
we usually find a local precinct
or an apartment.

506
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,373
Whatever will expediate the
situation most effectively.

507
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,423
Have a seat wherever you want.
Just pull up a chair.

508
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,305
According to this statement,
the light was green

509
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,848
when the bus passed through
the intersection.

510
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,008
Yes.

511
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,515
So you're saying she walked
against the light?

512
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,185
Yeah.

513
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,362
It's true. Two years of college,

514
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,865
two years at the magazine.
Two years with you.

515
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,284
I'm kind of a two-year gal!

516
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,710
What's funny about that?

517
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,892
What did you think of the play?

518
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,095
It was okay.

519
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,998
Hello?
- Hi, Dad!

520
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,199
Yeah! Hi!

521
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,409
How are you?

522
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,626
I'm okay. I'm fine.

523
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,455
I'm just sitting here, looking at the
ocean, tryin' to do a little work,

524
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,999
listening to some music.

525
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,839
How are you? I'm okay.

526
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,337
Are you practicing your horseback riding?

527
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,422
Oh, yeah, I've really been riding a lot.

528
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,634
I'm gettin' these really bad saddle sores.

529
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,511
Are you?

530
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,933
No, I'm kidding.

531
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,731
Yeah. Do you know

532
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,526
Claremont Stables on 89th between
Columbus and Amsterdam?

533
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,648
Yeah.

534
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:41,861
Well, it might be really worth your while

535
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,736
to go over there and maybe sign
up for a couple of lessons.

536
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,532
No... I'd be happy to...

537
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,867
I'm sorry, what?

538
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,866
I was just saying I'd be very
happy to spring for it

539
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,618
if you want to take a couple of lessons.

540
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,453
I think it would pay off in the end.

541
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,409
Thanks. I actually may
take you up on that.

542
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,411
Yeah, just let me know.

543
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,916
I appreciate that.

544
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,459
So, how's school?

545
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,293
School's okay. I'm kind of
fucking up in geometry.

546
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,295
But I assume you're not torpedoing

547
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,921
your scholarship or anything like that?

548
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,881
Nope. The scholarship's on. Okay, good.

549
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,390
Well, math was never my strong
suit either, so...

550
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,267
I guess I'm following in your
footsteps in that regard.

551
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,314
Well, I'm proud to hear it.

552
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,317
So, how are you?

553
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:26,023
Um... I'm okay. Things are okay.

554
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:29,906
They're a little slow and
a little frustrating.

555
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,120
But there's one or two projects we're

556
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,331
going after that seem to look promising.

557
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:38,160
And I don't know, I think it's okay.

558
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,869
Okay.

559
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,584
How's the boyfriend situation?

560
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,041
Oh. The same.

561
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,125
Nobody...

562
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,209
They're all kind of the same.

563
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,092
Well, I know this is not
going to go anywhere,

564
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,265
but our next workshop is comprised,
for the most part,

565
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,264
of strapping young men of
about 17 years old who,

566
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,850
for some peculiar reason, are interested
in using their brains

567
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,930
to get on with their lives.

568
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,982
Nobody really understands
why or how this happened,

569
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,354
but if you're interested in meeting any

570
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,814
of them when you come out next time...

571
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:08,490
Yeah, I don't really go for the
California type, but thanks.

572
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:13,992
Well, I don't either, per se. It depends
on the person, obviously.

573
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,329
Hard to argue with. I think
I'll stop generalizing now.

574
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,128
Well, that's about it on my end, sweetie.

575
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,921
I'll give you a call in a week or two.

576
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,174
Give my love to Curtis.

577
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,634
Okay. Well...

578
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,886
I love you.

579
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,672
I love you, too. Bye.

580
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,023
You do know I have two kids, right?

581
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,067
Yes. I would like to meet them.

582
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,231
You are really smooth.

583
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,694
I would love to meet your kids.

584
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,071
I have two boys myself. I'm not smooth.

585
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,201
Would you like to have a nightcap?

586
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,250
I just...

587
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,216
I feel like we used to
be really close, like,

588
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,348
up until a few days ago,

589
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,518
and I'm really not getting
that from you anymore.

590
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,936
Becky, give me a break.

591
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,857
Now you wanna do the other nostril

592
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,111
because you always want to be
symmetrical. Very important.

593
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,990
You are so funny.

594
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,450
symmetry

595
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,915
So, what do we do now?

596
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,337
Now we make out.

597
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,926
Paul! What about your girlfriend?

598
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,178
I'm sorry. It just sounded like

599
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,968
you asked me about my girlfriend.

600
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,926
Oh, never mind.

601
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,318
I don't know, man. I don't
wanna get into it.

602
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,674
You know I really love you, right?

603
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,428
Not really.

604
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,132
I gotta go home.

605
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,715
I'm just gonna head out, too.

606
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,560
You need a little help, I take it?

607
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,158
Joan, are you all right?

608
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,124
Yes, fine. I'll be out in a sec.

609
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,767
Okay, we're gonna start with
a few simple stretches.

610
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:08,597
I want you all to watch me first,
and then you'll follow.

611
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,725
All right, so left arm goes up.

612
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,812
And then all the way over to the side,

613
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,985
you're gonna feel a long stretch

614
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,283
along the side of your body.

615
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,697
All right.

616
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,377
Mr. Aaron?

617
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,087
Yes, Becky... Lisa?

618
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,798
Are you still mad at me about the test?

619
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,968
What's going on, Lisa?

620
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,304
Because maybe the bus driver

621
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,055
is completely devastated as it is,

622
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,133
and I'm just gonna be this rich girl who

623
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,226
calls up the cops to ease her conscience.

624
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,975
What does your being rich
have to do with anything?

625
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,062
You know what I mean.

626
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,139
No, I don't.

627
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,484
I don't mean literally rich. I mean
rich compared to the bus driver.

628
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,028
Lionel? I'm going to need five minutes.

629
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,317
I just thought you wanted to know that

630
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,696
there's a lot of people out here

631
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,157
and it's kind of hard to breathe.

632
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,779
You better close that door now, Lionel.

633
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,280
I'm sorry, I gotta let these guys in.

634
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,331
I don't want to leave you hanging.
Look, if you're hurting,

635
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,995
we could get a cup of coffee after school.

636
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,622
I'd do that.

637
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,697
Hey, does this dress make me look fat?

638
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,817
Um... A little.

639
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,246
Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

640
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:50,907
Where are you going?

641
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,200
The opera.

642
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,578
Why are you going to the opera?

643
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,712
Turns out he's a big opera fan.

644
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,832
Anyway, don't you think
it sounds kind of fun?

645
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,212
We should all go sometime.

646
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,542
No, thanks.

647
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,212
Why not? I bet you'd like it.

648
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,675
I don't like that kind of singing.

649
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,506
You like classical music.

650
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,512
Yes, that's true, but I don't
like opera singing.

651
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,556
When have you ever... It's
like their entire reason

652
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,353
for existing is to prove
how loud they can be.

653
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,851
I don't really find that
all that interesting.

654
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,937
Yeah. I know what you mean, but it's not

655
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,731
all like that. You like The Magic Flute.

656
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,855
Okay. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like

657
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,654
opera singing. I just didn't realize it.

658
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,826
What is the matter with you?

659
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,070
Nothing at all.

660
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,660
Why are you pushing this? I don't
want to go to the opera!

661
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,332
Yes, okay. I'm not pushing anything.

662
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,705
All you have say is, "No, thanks."

663
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,582
I did and then you were like, "Why not?"

664
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,167
So then I told you, and then
you started debating me,

665
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,248
like you assumed that I've never

666
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,332
thought this through for myself,

667
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,009
which I have, many times!

668
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,714
Okay, well that was a really contemptuous
assumption on my part.

669
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,510
I don't actually like the opera that much

670
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,182
myself, but I'm trying to expand my mind,

671
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,931
maybe that's wrong.

672
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,682
I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous
about you guys meeting Ramon.

673
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,233
Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so

674
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,818
influenced by what Curtis and me...

675
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,062
...what Curtis and I think?

676
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,364
Hey, why does everything I say annoy you?

677
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,537
Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here.

678
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,909
Here, you be me, and say anything
and I'll respond to you

679
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,333
the way you've been responding
to me this whole conversation.

680
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,534
Go ahead, you say something to me...

681
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,785
No! I'm not gonna do that.

682
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,371
Why not? Because it's dumb!

683
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,922
I'm horrible. I get your point!

684
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,590
Oh, okay. Whatever.

685
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,464
Was that supposed to be
an imitation of me?

686
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,882
Mmm. Okay, withdrawn.

687
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,808
Are you coming to my opening night?

688
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,473
I will if I have to.

689
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,600
You're a little cunt, you know that?

690
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:37,813
Yes. You're a big cunt.

691
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,812
Okay, let's not start talking
to each other that way.

692
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,689
You just called me a cunt, Mom.

693
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,566
I'm sorry I said that...
Why? It's refreshing.

694
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,942
If you're saying you're not aware you've
been really annoyed with me,

695
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,569
or really irritable with me and it doesn't

696
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,237
matter if I express it exactly accurately,

697
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,944
because you know what I'm trying
to say. Not really.

698
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,995
If you're really saying that you're
completely unaware of that,

699
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,790
then I have to say I don't think
you're being honest about it.

700
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,412
Now, maybe I'm doing something horrible

701
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,126
to you without being aware of it,

702
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,500
but I have a show opening in two weeks,
I'm really nervous about it,

703
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,876
I'm seeing a new person

704
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,333
and I'm obviously anxious about
you and Curtis liking him,

705
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,677
you were involved in this horrible,
traumatic accident,

706
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,255
you're going on this crazy horseback
riding trip with your father...

707
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,261
Oh, my God! ...which sounds like
a recipe for disaster to me.

708
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,845
And on top of everything else, Lisa,

709
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,225
ever since I told you about Ramon,

710
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,137
you have been treating me like I'm insane.

711
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,346
I think you're exaggerating.

712
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,563
Now, what am I supposed to do?

713
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,731
What am I supposed to do?

714
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,974
Just stop whining about everything!

715
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,935
It doesn't matter. None
of it matters at all.

716
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,065
You've been in a million plays,

717
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,317
you always get freaked out because
of what some dumb critic

718
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,069
is gonna say about your dumb play.

719
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,491
I don't frankly give a shit about Ramon

720
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,985
or who you're going out with this week.

721
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,160
I never go out with anyone.

722
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,704
I don't care! Don't talk to me like that!

723
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,577
I've barely had a date for
the last two years!

724
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,533
Yeah, but I don't care about any
of it. It doesn't matter.

725
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,540
Your boyfriend doesn't matter. Your
play doesn't matter, except to you.

726
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,080
I don't care about New Mexico,
because to tell you the truth,

727
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,130
I'm probably not even going.

728
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,799
What do you mean? Want to
know something else, Mom?

729
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,171
There are more important problems

730
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,589
in the world than our relationship.

731
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,838
There is a whole city out there
full of people who are dying,

732
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,049
so who gives a shit if I like
your fucking boyfriend?

733
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,635
It is so trivial. Why are you bothering me

734
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,811
with all this? It doesn't matter.

735
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:06,186
Well, should I have him come up now?

736
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,398
Or should I have him wait downstairs?

737
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,949
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

738
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,786
Lisa, I don't even know what
we're talking about.

739
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,448
I know you don't. That's the problem.

740
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,291
Oh, give me a break.

741
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,834
Everything is all right?

742
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,171
Oh, yeah. Oh. I'm so excited
to be going to the opera.

743
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,757
I don't think I've really gone
more than one or two times.

744
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,423
I wish it wasn't Norma, but
still it's fun to go.

745
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,096
What if we went to see something
else instead?

746
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,302
You don't want to hear Norma?

747
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:40,474
Oh, no, I don't mean that.

748
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,055
I just meant, wouldn't it be funny

749
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,727
if we walked into one of the other events?

750
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,274
Like, what if we just went to see

751
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,776
the Daniel Goldfarb play instead?

752
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,312
I think you will enjoy this.

753
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,887
It's beautiful. Shh.

754
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,221
This is the dumbest book I've ever read.

755
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,604
Yo.
- Hey, Paul.

756
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,856
Hey. It's Lisa Cohen.

757
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,650
Yeah, how's it going?

758
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,824
Okay. What have you been up to?

759
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,787
Seeing some questionable movies,

760
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,955
and not deciding where to go to college.

761
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,287
Sounds good.

762
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,999
So, I was just thinking...

763
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,965
This is gonna sound really queer,

764
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:21,969
but by any chance would you
want to meet somewhere

765
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,176
and, like, take away my virginity?

766
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,262
Um... All right.

767
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,388
Really?

768
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,187
To what do I owe this inconceivable honor?

769
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,185
Actually, it's because of my deep,

770
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,857
passionate feelings for you, Paul.

771
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,314
That's pretty much what I figured.

772
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,359
Do you wanna give me your address?

773
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,693
Oh, um...

774
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,864
It's 252 West 85th Street.

775
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,782
Okay.

776
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,294
All right. I'll be there
in like a half hour,

777
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,789
or more. Okay.

778
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,791
All right. I'll see you. Bye.

779
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,030
Hello?
- Hey.

780
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,148
What are you up to?

781
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,404
Writing my Lear paper.

782
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,069
That's impressive.

783
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,323
Not really.

784
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,363
I've just never known you to be

785
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,910
so devoted to your studies before.

786
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,787
So, what did you do tonight?

787
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:37,624
Actually, Darren, I don't really
feel like talking right now.

788
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,000
Okay.

789
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:41,669
Okay?

790
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,806
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

791
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,425
Okay.

792
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,516
Okay, bye. Bye.

793
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,908
Hey.

794
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:13,993
Hey, come in.

795
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,667
I think I just alienated one of

796
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,293
your neighbors by smoking in the elevator.

797
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,419
Really? What did they say?

798
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,139
She basically said there was
no smoking in the elevator.

799
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,716
That's original.

800
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,804
So, this is the living room.

801
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,229
Very livable. We like it.

802
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,570
My mom hasn't read any of
these books, by the way.

803
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:42,730
Have you?

804
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,487
Some of them. Not all of them.

805
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,115
This book is a very cool book.

806
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:54,166
Yeah, I think The Third Reich may be a
little bit too much for me right now.

807
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,461
It's pretty hard to put down
once you get started.

808
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,424
Do you want anything to drink?

809
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,589
I'd take a beer.

810
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,802
Okay, that's in the kitchen.

811
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,615
This is my room. Ta-da.

812
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:31,987
Very nice.

813
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,043
These are some drawings I did.

814
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,129
Not that I should be showing
them to you, because

815
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,298
I know you're like a really
good artist, right?

816
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,842
I would like to be a really good artist.

817
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,419
At this point, I think it would be more

818
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,091
accurate to say I'm good at drawing.

819
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:52,600
Yeah, I just do it for fun. But
I've always really liked it.

820
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,139
So, can I ask you something?

821
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,307
Yes?

822
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,816
This is probably gonna
sound very immature,

823
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:09,488
but how can you be so relaxed, knowing
what we're about to do?

824
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,408
Or is it just like no big deal to you?

825
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,538
Okay, that was a really stupid question,

826
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,627
and I'm totally embarrassed right now.

827
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,673
I'm actually more embarrassed than
I've ever been in my life.

828
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,380
If you wanna go home now,
that's totally okay.

829
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,131
Easy there. Don't be embarrassed.

830
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,755
It's basically, like, the world's
greatest activity,

831
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,011
but it's not actually worth
getting nervous about.

832
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,682
Yeah, I don't usually get nervous
because I think it's worth it,

833
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:41,266
I usually get nervous because
I can't help the way I feel.

834
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,026
There is that philosophy.

835
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,233
You are so funny.

836
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,647
Do you have an ashtray?

837
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,074
You can just chuck it out the window.

838
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,375
How would one just chuck
it out the window?

839
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,082
Oh, you just slide the little door...

840
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,295
Like that?

841
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,510
Yes.

842
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,680
Am I supposed to go really fast
at the end or something?

843
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,312
Yeah, but we're gonna move on before that.

844
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,265
Here.

845
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,876
Oh, oh. You don't have to do that.

846
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,500
I know. I want to.

847
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,426
But don't do that. I'm just embarrassed.

848
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,059
Let me do it to you.

849
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,429
All right.

850
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:12,406
Uh... Um...

851
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,450
Any general guidelines?

852
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,118
Just be careful.

853
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,195
Okay.

854
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,082
Are you ready?

855
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:29,957
Yeah.

856
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,167
Okay.

857
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,637
Now, this is a little tricky. It's probably
gonna hurt a little at first,

858
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,299
but then it's gonna get better.
Just be patient.

859
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,926
There are certain technical
difficulties on

860
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,101
my end that have to be addressed,

861
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,645
or it's not gonna happen.

862
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,226
Okay. You sound insane.

863
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,188
Okay, ready?

864
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,573
Yeah.

865
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:58,156
Okay.

866
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,116
Mmm-hmm.

867
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:01,739
Okay, hang on.

868
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,657
Okay, there we go.

869
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,492
Does it hurt now?

870
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,035
Kind of, yeah.

871
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,918
Okay, just try to relax. It'll
get better in a second...

872
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:11,999
Did you bring a condom?

873
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,125
Uh-huh.

874
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,672
Shouldn't you put it on?

875
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,007
I will in a second.

876
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,055
This is really kind of hurting.

877
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:20,390
Okay, one second.

878
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,097
I love you. What?

879
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,511
Nothing.

880
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,855
Okay. Hold on.

881
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,936
Shit. What?

882
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,061
Okay, one second. Oh! Sorry.

883
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,445
Sorry.

884
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,035
Oh!

885
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,282
Sorry about that.

886
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,534
Kind of got away from me.

887
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,922
Did any of it get inside me?

888
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,757
I don't know.

889
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,425
Yeah. It definitely did.

890
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,223
Honest to God, it's probably okay.

891
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,270
The odds are overwhelmingly
that it's okay.

892
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,392
That's my little brother.

893
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,320
Hey, Curtis. Hi.

894
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,063
I loved it. It was so exciting.

895
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:02,277
But how about those people yelling
"bravi" and "brave"?

896
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,781
How do you mean?

897
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,116
Well, it's just so pretentious.

898
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:08,582
"Bravi, bravi." Why can't
they just say "bravo"?

899
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:12,837
Well, it's the plural. It's what they
say to acknowledge the ensemble.

900
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:16,378
No, I know it's correct, but don't
you think there's just something

901
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,458
a little pretentious about
some of those people?

902
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,135
Pretentious?

903
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:21,671
I don't mean they didn't really enjoy it,

904
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,215
but you know how you can
be enjoying something,

905
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,892
but you're also kind of looking around,
out of the corner of your eye,

906
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:29,103
because you know people are
watching you enjoy it?

907
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,603
Yes, but I wouldn't say that
it was pretentious.

908
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:38,317
In Italian you say "bravo" for the
man and "brava" for the woman,

909
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,522
and "bravi" for the whole company.

910
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,612
Uh-huh. Okay, I see what you mean.

911
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:46,161
You use the masculine for the male singer

912
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:50,492
and the feminine for the female singer.

913
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,497
Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank you.

914
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,670
We'll have to go again.

915
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,627
It was so glamorous.

916
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:03,049
Accident Investigation,
Detective Mitchell.

917
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,347
My name is Lisa Cohen. I was a witness

918
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,637
in a bus accident case a few weeks ago.

919
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,764
Yeah, hi, Lisa. What can I do for you?

920
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,516
Well, are you allowed to tell me how

921
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,396
to get in touch with that woman's family?

922
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:16,271
I really wanted to send some
flowers or something,

923
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,687
or is that like classified information?

924
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,692
No, the family's been notified.
Let me see what I got.

925
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,614
She mentioned she had a daughter.

926
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,115
Just hold on a second. How
are you doing, okay?

927
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:29,196
I'm okay.

928
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,843
All right, let me just...

929
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,718
Okay, I don't have anything
for a daughter.

930
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:55,773
The only contact I have is
a cousin, Abigail Berwitz.

931
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,899
I got a phone number in Arizona.

932
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:58,976
Okay.

933
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:02,563
520-5555. Mmm-hmm.

934
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,815
I'm trying to reach Abigail Berwitz?

935
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,071
This is Abigail. Hi.

936
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,165
My name is Lisa Cohen. You don't know me.

937
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,709
Yes? Hello?

938
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,753
I'm actually calling about your
cousin, Monica Patterson?

939
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,748
Okay?

940
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,583
Um...

941
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,929
I was actually there when she had...

942
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,758
During the accident, I didn't know her,

943
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,765
but I was holding her hand at the time.

944
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,855
Yes? What can I do for you?

945
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,311
Uh, um...

946
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:43,941
Okay, well...

947
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,072
I saw her obituary in the paper,

948
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,782
but can you hold on one second?

949
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,532
Can you shut up for five minutes?

950
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,578
What am I supposed to do?
I have to practice.

951
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,655
I don't give a shit!

952
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,666
Sorry. Um...

953
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,871
I didn't see anything about a funeral.
I assume they had one.

954
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,126
As far as I know, they're doing

955
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,419
something or other next week, but...

956
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,505
I'm sorry, I was also wondering...

957
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,045
She said something about her daughter?

958
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,755
No. She wanted someone to get in touch...

959
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,050
No. Her daughter's not alive. She passed
away quite a long time ago.

960
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,764
Oh, my God.

961
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,558
Was she sick? Or was it...

962
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,147
She had leukemia.

963
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,308
Oh, my gosh. Mmm-hmm.

964
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,315
And do you mind if I ask...
Could I just interrupt?

965
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,564
How did you get this number?
This is harassment!

966
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,239
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to harass you.

967
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,612
I've been getting calls about this

968
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,194
for three weeks, and I
gotta tell you people,

969
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,702
I didn't have any kind of relationship
with Monica whatsoever.

970
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,745
The person you should be calling is

971
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,834
Emily Morrison, who was Monica's friend.

972
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,208
She's the person who's been dealing
with all of this in New York.

973
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,710
It has nothing to do with me.

974
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,841
I'm sorry! I didn't really
know who to contact.

975
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:47,918
Now, I can give you her number,

976
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:51,005
but I would very much appreciate
it if the calls would stop.

977
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:52,839
Yeah...

978
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,013
Can you hold on while I get a pen?

979
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,348
Yes.

980
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:58,854
All right.

981
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,098
Okay.

982
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,907
Hi, are you Lisa?

983
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:18,990
Yes.

984
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,759
As most of you know,

985
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:33,555
Monica was not a religious woman.

986
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,012
Anybody who ever had to sit through

987
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,885
a wedding or a funeral with her

988
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,346
knows how she felt about formal occasions.

989
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,891
So Harry, Elise and I,

990
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,690
we were talking about this,

991
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,397
decided we would just have everyone over,

992
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,743
and let anyone who wanted to talk about
Monica, just talk about her.

993
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,155
Maybe share some remembrances.

994
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,996
Some of us know each other
and some of us don't.

995
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,878
But we're all here...

996
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:12,344
We're all here because we loved Monica

997
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,515
and because we want to pay
tribute to her in a way

998
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,635
that might conceivably not enrage her.

999
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,977
Now, I don't wanna tell anyone
what to think, or how to feel.

1000
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,817
And I don't want to kid myself about

1001
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,524
the stupid, meaningless way that she died,

1002
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,201
because that would really
make her throw up,

1003
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,412
but I don't want it to become
the summation of her life,

1004
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,784
because it's not.

1005
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,791
When her Lisa died...

1006
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,751
When her Lisa died, I said to
her, "How can you stand it?"

1007
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,753
And she said, "First of all, I can't.

1008
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:55,262
"But I don't want to take away
the 12 years she did have

1009
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,183
"and turn them all into leukemia,
because they weren't."

1010
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,555
And so I do think it's
important to remember

1011
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:09,852
that despite the fact that
she got ripped off,

1012
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:13,572
she was the most fully developed person

1013
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,116
I, personally, have ever known.

1014
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,533
She was also impossible to get along with,

1015
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,208
but that's another story.

1016
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,163
So, now I've said my little piece.

1017
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:34,752
And now I want to talk a bit about
the first time we ever met.

1018
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,137
She was... She was 21.

1019
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:46,517
It's okay, Emily.

1020
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,607
I know.

1021
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,397
I was 19.

1022
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,313
Even though I realize it's
impossible for my

1023
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,565
children to believe I was ever that young.

1024
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:44,738
Hi, Dad.

1025
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,915
Yeah, hi, how're you doing?

1026
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:48,283
Okay, how are you?

1027
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,127
I'm just sitting here listening to some

1028
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,918
music, having a delicious glass of beer.

1029
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:54,998
That sounds pleasant.

1030
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:59,716
Yeah. How's everything going? How's
the boyfriend situation?

1031
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,799
Well, there's this one guy I sort of
had something going with, but...

1032
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,012
But he kind of has a girlfriend, so...

1033
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,092
Uh-huh.

1034
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,479
I realize I'm incredibly enthralling.

1035
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:10,931
You are. You're very lucky. You're a very

1036
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,519
beautiful girl, and you've got brains.

1037
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:13,600
That makes you a little dangerous.

1038
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,684
Don't forget mature.

1039
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,899
Well, I hope you're not too mature.

1040
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,321
No, don't worry.

1041
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:19,781
Good. That was a very good answer.

1042
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:23,197
Anyway, I do think it's a pretty
longstanding relationship.

1043
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,495
Then you know what? You just do nothing.

1044
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,660
Do absolutely nothing. And I guarantee

1045
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,783
you one of two things will happen.

1046
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,743
Either you're going to get the guy to

1047
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,745
start doing back flips
to get your attention

1048
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,205
or you're going send him a crystal clear

1049
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,707
signal that if he doesn't do back flips,

1050
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,508
he's not gonna get your attention.

1051
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,343
I think he already knows I like him.

1052
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,961
Uh-huh? Okay...

1053
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,971
I think I might have spilled
the beans on that one.

1054
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:46,683
That's okay, because now, if
you stop acknowledging him,

1055
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:47,759
if you suddenly give him nothing,

1056
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,890
I guarantee you, the guy
is going to go berserk

1057
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,556
and forget his girlfriend, unless
he's just not interested.

1058
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,392
In which case, you just gotta take
your lumps, which is tough.

1059
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,102
Okay, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try out

1060
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,729
the technique next time I see him.

1061
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:01,819
Well, everything's okay here.

1062
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,696
Things are a little slow,
but... Actually, Dad?

1063
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,242
Yeah?

1064
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:10,115
I actually have something kind of
serious I want to ask you about.

1065
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,282
Okay.

1066
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,795
I'm kind soliciting people I respect
for their views on this.

1067
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,167
Okay, what's up?

1068
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,980
Do you think I should go back
to the police, or what?

1069
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,735
Well, first of all, I'm very
glad you told me about this.

1070
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,113
I want you to let me call
my friend who's a lawyer,

1071
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,489
just so we can find out what some
of the ramifications would be.

1072
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:51,081
Maybe the three of us could talk
on the phone and possibly...

1073
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,123
Hey. Hey, babe.

1074
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,290
Actually, Dad, please don't call anybody.

1075
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,868
Did you get my message?

1076
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:56,540
Um... I got a message.

1077
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,295
Hello?
- Sorry.

1078
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,793
About the flowers for my mother?

1079
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:02,092
Just one second. Annette just
walked in. I'm sorry.

1080
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:03,168
That's okay.

1081
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,548
Who are you talking to?

1082
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,213
I guess I would just like to know later

1083
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,680
that I would have done the right thing

1084
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,302
by myself, if you see what I mean,

1085
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,893
because I don't think I
have so far. Uh-huh.

1086
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,720
Not that I'm trying to make
this woman's horrible death

1087
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,771
into my own personal moral gymnasium...

1088
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:18,066
Right. Well, that's that
Shaw quote, right?

1089
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:19,772
What?

1090
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:20,940
The Shaw quote? That great Shaw quote.

1091
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,153
"The Englishman sees the
world as expressly

1092
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,576
"designed to be his own personal
moral gymnasium."

1093
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,904
I think it's in one of those
wonderful prefaces.

1094
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,656
I don't know where I read it.

1095
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,411
Who is that? It's Lisa.

1096
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,954
Oh, good. Will you please ask her...

1097
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,627
Anyway...

1098
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:39,371
Hold on. I'm sorry, Lisa.

1099
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:40,455
Can you hold on one second?

1100
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:41,961
Yes?

1101
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,633
Please ask if there's anything
we don't know about

1102
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,085
that she won't eat, for the trip.

1103
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,595
I have to call the ranch because
they do all the meals

1104
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,967
ahead of time.
- Okay, I will.

1105
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,848
I really will. We're just in
the middle of something.

1106
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,642
Karl, I was supposed to
call them last week.

1107
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,969
You said you were going to call her.

1108
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:55,304
If I hear about this fucking
ranch one more

1109
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,933
time, I'm going to blow my brains out.

1110
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:59,148
I'm just in the middle of something.

1111
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,482
I don't... What do you want me to do?

1112
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,815
Fine, but if they put anything
in the baskets she can't eat,

1113
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:04,612
well she's not going to
have anything to eat.

1114
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:05,734
I will ask her...

1115
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,902
The last time she came out here,

1116
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,824
we went to three different
restaurants and she...

1117
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,494
I will ask her. We're just right in
the middle of something, okay?

1118
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,285
Okay. Tell her I said, "Hi."

1119
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,744
I will. Okay.

1120
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:18,789
Hello?

1121
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,335
Yes. Hi.

1122
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,425
Mom?

1123
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,085
Monica!

1124
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,242
There's somebody here to see you.

1125
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:06,665
Hi.

1126
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,256
I'm really sorry to bother you.

1127
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,209
We never met. I'm Lisa Cohen.

1128
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,679
Yeah. What can I do for you?

1129
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,683
Well, do you remember me
from the bus accident?

1130
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,394
I don't know. What's this about?

1131
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,601
Would it be okay if I talked
to you for a minute?

1132
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:29,400
What do you want to talk about?
I don't understand.

1133
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,817
I just wanna talk about the
accident for a minute.

1134
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,574
I don't want anything, and I'm
not here to do anything bad.

1135
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,151
I just wanted to talk to you about it.

1136
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,453
Where did you get my address?

1137
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:43,748
I called information. I was
gonna call first, but...

1138
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:46,243
It would have been better.
We're about to sit down.

1139
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:49,954
I don't get what...

1140
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,587
All right. Let's go outside.

1141
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,092
I'm sorry. Could I use your bathroom?

1142
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,169
No, let's just go outside.

1143
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,336
Gerry, let her use the bathroom.

1144
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,592
I don't want her to use the bathroom.

1145
01:10:58,713 --> 01:10:59,930
I don't understand what this is.

1146
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,007
It's right down the hall, honey.

1147
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,560
Hey, will you kids settle down,
please? I'm not kidding!

1148
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:07,188
What's the matter with you? Who is she?

1149
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:08,643
Some girl that was at the accident.

1150
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:11,442
Nothing is the matter. I let her
use the fucking bathroom.

1151
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,518
Who is she?

1152
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,356
Honey, just do me a favor and wait inside.

1153
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:17,774
No, I want to hear what this is.

1154
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:18,858
Look, we're just...

1155
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:20,986
Okay. What?

1156
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,156
Okay.

1157
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,164
I hope this isn't going
to insult you too much.

1158
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,832
Insult me?

1159
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:35,333
I was just wondering if you felt
bad at all about what happened.

1160
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,052
About the accident? Yeah.

1161
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:41,431
Honey? Are you just upset
about the accident?

1162
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:42,974
Yes! I'm upset about the accident.

1163
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,592
I'm very upset about the accident.

1164
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,552
And I wanted to talk to you
about it for a minute.

1165
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:47,975
Why is that so strange?

1166
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,180
Gerry, why don't we all go inside?

1167
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,431
Could I please talk to you alone?

1168
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:53,230
Okay, what is going on here?

1169
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,903
Nothing's going on here. So
why don't you calm down?

1170
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,902
Look, go ahead inside. Let
me find out what this is.

1171
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:00,404
In the meantime, why don't you make sure

1172
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:02,906
those kids aren't killing
each other, all right?

1173
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,237
All right.

1174
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:08,659
No, you know what? Let 'em kill
each other. Give us all a rest.

1175
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,293
All right, Lisa. What?

1176
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,335
I just...

1177
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:23,844
Well... I just want you to
know... Yes? What? Speak.

1178
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:28,436
Well, you probably already
know, obviously, that

1179
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,893
I told the police, on the police report,

1180
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:33,350
that I thought the whole
thing was an accident.

1181
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,150
Uh-huh. Right. Because it was an accident.

1182
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,978
Well, I mean...

1183
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:39,484
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

1184
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:40,731
"O" Purpose"?

1185
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:41,983
But it wasn't like...

1186
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:46,993
What? What? Speak. What?

1187
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,287
Well, I mean...

1188
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:52,877
We were looking at each other.

1189
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,585
Who was looking at each
other'? You and me?

1190
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:58,795
Well, yeah.

1191
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:03,050
I mean, not like romantically or anything.

1192
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,759
Romantically?

1193
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,474
Scratch that. That's not even relevant.

1194
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:09,890
You're not coming through
very clearly here.

1195
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:10,970
If you could just let me...

1196
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,725
From my point of view, the way
I remember the accident is

1197
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,686
you were wearing this cowboy hat,

1198
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,233
and I was out that day
to buy a cowboy hat,

1199
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,190
so I was waving at you, because
you were wearing one,

1200
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:25,197
and you were kind of waving back.

1201
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,402
And...

1202
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,703
I know I was distracting you,

1203
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:34,665
but I did see the bus go
through the red light,

1204
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,588
and that's when it hit that woman.

1205
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,083
Okay.

1206
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:43,340
I'm getting a little confused here.

1207
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:44,674
Only nobody said that to them,

1208
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:47,639
and I wanted to acknowledge with
you that that's what happened.

1209
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:49,217
I don't know what you really
mean by "waving at you."

1210
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,722
Were you trying to catch the bus?

1211
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,265
No. Yes. But I wanted to

1212
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,392
ask you about your cowboy hat.

1213
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:54,472
Maybe I was waving at you,

1214
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,274
like waving at you to say,
"Step away from the bus."

1215
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,772
Because if the bus was in motion,

1216
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,194
I would be waving you away for your own

1217
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:01,608
safety, but that's all that would be.

1218
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:04,024
You don't remember looking
at me and waving at me?

1219
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,946
Not really. No.

1220
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:09,370
Well, I think we both remember
something different.

1221
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,452
Your brother's on the phone.

1222
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,204
Tell him I'll call him back.

1223
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:20,752
I'm not trying to get you in trouble.

1224
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:22,253
I know you're not, because you can't,

1225
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:23,877
because I didn't do anything wrong.

1226
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,053
There was no criminality found.

1227
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:28,010
That's it. The report is final.

1228
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,136
So you're just gonna leave it?

1229
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,842
I'm gonna leave it because
that's all it was.

1230
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:33,306
If something else had happened,

1231
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:34,895
I'd take that to whatever that was.

1232
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,644
It was tragic. It's a tragedy.

1233
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,475
But there's only a certain speed
that those brakes can react.

1234
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,856
That's the physical limitation
of the machine.

1235
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:45,691
I don't know what else to tell you.
It's shocking. It was a shock.

1236
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,277
But you can't bring her back.
You cannot bring her back.

1237
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,828
I'm not talking about bringing her back.

1238
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,246
I'm talking about telling the accident

1239
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:53,782
investigators what really happened.

1240
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:55,036
You already talked to them!

1241
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:56,208
I know that. But I lied.

1242
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,417
You lied.

1243
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,791
I can understand if you don't want
to get in trouble, but...

1244
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,543
Why didn't you say that right then?

1245
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:02,916
Because when they were asking
me what happened

1246
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,592
it seemed like you were looking at me

1247
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:06,256
like we were saying to each other,

1248
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,258
"Let's not say anything
about what happened."

1249
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,139
Now, I really don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1250
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,761
I can't prove you were doing that.

1251
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:16,061
What, did I say something to
you? Did I threaten you?

1252
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:18,606
No! I am not blaming you for any of this!

1253
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:21,397
All I'm saying is I didn't really
tell the cops what happened,

1254
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,477
and I didn't want to go back without
having spoken to you first.

1255
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:27,031
But you told 'em what you
saw! And so did I!

1256
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,950
Only I'm the one driving the bus!
I'm the one behind the wheel!

1257
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,448
All right, Gerry, calm
down. Leave it alone.

1258
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,154
You wanna ruin my life?

1259
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,536
Start telling them about looks and you

1260
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,374
waved at me and I had my cowboy hat on.

1261
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:38,542
Go ahead, but you're gonna go home

1262
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:39,751
and you're gonna do your homework,

1263
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:43,331
and I'm gonna lose my job. And who's
gonna take care of my family'?

1264
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,457
You?

1265
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:48,048
Are you gonna do it? And for what?

1266
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,216
She's dead! Okay? She's dead! And there's

1267
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:51,714
nothing I can do to bring her back!

1268
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,049
I just want to say what really happened.

1269
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,975
You do whatever you fuckin' want, lady!

1270
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,473
But those cops are gonna laugh in your

1271
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,057
fucking face because this
was not my fault!

1272
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,434
It was both our fault.

1273
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:01,390
Don't ever say that again unless
you got a fuckin' lawyer.

1274
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,146
What's your phone number?

1275
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:04,393
Why?

1276
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,150
Give me your number. No!
Why do you want it?

1277
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,356
You wanna show up at my house
like some anonymous person

1278
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,783
I can't get in touch with? What's
your fuckin' number, Lisa Cohen!

1279
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:12,110
Gerry, take it easy.

1280
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,451
Fine! It's 212-5...

1281
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:15,905
Hold on! Go on.

1282
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:20,789
555-0157. Why do you need it?

1283
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,212
You do whatever you're gonna do.
I hope you get a good lawyer.

1284
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:25,414
Why are you being like this?

1285
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:26,624
This was very traumatic for him!

1286
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:29,047
Yeah, it's almost as bad as
getting your leg cutoff!

1287
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,014
I don't understand.

1288
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:49,568
I guess I was afraid. I
didn't know what to do.

1289
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:51,861
You didn't know what to do?

1290
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,201
I know it doesn't sound very impressive.

1291
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:59,039
Impressive!

1292
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:06,543
Okay, I know you're trying
to do the right thing now.

1293
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,336
What does your mother say?

1294
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:10,213
My mother hasn't really been that helpful.

1295
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:11,423
What do you mean?

1296
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:12,591
She's got a lot going on right now

1297
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:15,264
and she hasn't been that
interested, I guess.

1298
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:20,307
What could she possibly have going on?

1299
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,512
Her show's opening.

1300
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,763
What do you mean, "her show"?

1301
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:24,474
What show?

1302
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,142
She's in a play.

1303
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,777
Okay. Okay.

1304
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,788
I'm gonna talk to a friend
of mine who's a lawyer,

1305
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:41,411
and you're gonna go talk to the police.

1306
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,833
Do you want me to go with you?

1307
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,293
No, thanks.

1308
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,254
Do you think maybe you should ask
your mother to go with you?

1309
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:50,341
I think I can handle this part myself.

1310
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:54,258
She's been so suspicious lately.

1311
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:56,843
I don't know how to get her
into the office without...

1312
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:58,761
Now, what do you think?

1313
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,349
Hey! Let me tell you something, Eliot.

1314
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:08,351
You want to fire me, go ahead and fire
me. Only don't tiptoe around me

1315
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,027
like some kind of deranged ballerina

1316
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,771
every time I see you in the fucking hall!

1317
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:14,657
Now, do you have anything
to say to me, Eliot?

1318
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:16,734
Um...

1319
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,656
You're not fired?

1320
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,289
Oh.

1321
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,992
So... What are you guys talking about?

1322
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:29,963
A suicide bomber attempted

1323
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:32,258
to set off a blast Wednesday in Jerusalem.

1324
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,418
No, Lisa read it to me.

1325
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:38,297
No. I never read 'em unless I know for
sure there's nothing bad in them.

1326
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:40,975
WW, do you?

1327
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,928
Well, you're brave and stupid.

1328
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:45,679
Um...

1329
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,728
Victor, I wish you wouldn't
talk that way to me.

1330
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,309
You know I'm...

1331
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:55,072
Spring and Fall, to a Young Child
by Gerard Manley Hopkins.

1332
01:18:57,191 --> 01:19:01,367
"Margaret, are you grieving
Over Goldengrove unleaving?

1333
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,454
"Leaves, like the things of man,

1334
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:09,036
"You with your fresh thoughts
care for, can you?

1335
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:11,459
"Ah! As the heart grows older

1336
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:17,754
"it will come to such sights colder
By and by, nor spare a sigh

1337
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:21,595
"Though worlds of wanwood leaf meal lie,

1338
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:25,804
"And yet you will weep and know why.

1339
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,853
"Now no matter, child, the name:

1340
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,852
"Sorrow's springs are the same.

1341
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:37,570
"Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed

1342
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:41,152
"What heart heard of, ghost guessed:

1343
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:45,285
"it is the blight man was born for,

1344
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:49,452
"it is Margaret you mourn for."

1345
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,214
Any thoughts?

1346
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:57,714
Lisa?

1347
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,401
Could I help you?

1348
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:24,574
Yeah, is Detective Mitchell here?

1349
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,239
No, he's not. Oh.

1350
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:30,417
I talked to him on Monday and he
said he'd be here after 3:00.

1351
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,493
Yeah, he's not back yet.

1352
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,246
Could I help you with something?

1353
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,714
Um...

1354
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:39,293
Well, do you know when you expect him?

1355
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:41,800
What's this about?

1356
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,139
I was involved in an accident
a few weeks ago,

1357
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,258
and I filled out a report
with Detective Mitchell,

1358
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:47,969
but I wanted to amend the report...

1359
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:50,396
What do you mean? How do
you want to amend it?

1360
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,265
There was something I didn't tell him,

1361
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:53,857
and I wanted to tell him because...

1362
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:54,933
I don't understand.

1363
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:56,940
You wanna change your statement? Yes!

1364
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:59,154
Yes, I want to change my statement.

1365
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:00,773
Yes.

1366
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:02,863
Well, you'd usually have to talk to

1367
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:05,031
the investigating detective on the case.

1368
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,580
Yes, I know. That's why I asked
to see Detective Mitchell.

1369
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,532
Who said he'd be here now,
but he's not, so...

1370
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:11,617
Do you remember the case number?

1371
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:12,785
No, sorry.

1372
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,163
It was that woman, Monica Patterson,

1373
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:17,840
who got run over by the bus on Broadway.

1374
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,209
It was in a lot of the newspapers...
Sure, okay, sit down.

1375
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,293
Thank you. I...

1376
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,378
You know the case is closed.

1377
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:26,723
I assumed it was. But part of
the reason it's closed is

1378
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:28,221
because of my statement,
and the statement I...

1379
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,472
Because of your statement?

1380
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:30,719
Yes.

1381
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:32,896
What do you mean it was closed
because of your statement'?

1382
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,314
I mean, I was the...

1383
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:35,816
The DA's office closes the case.

1384
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:39,687
You don't close the case. The
DA's office closes the case.

1385
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,647
I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean

1386
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,691
I personally closed it, like legally.

1387
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,072
I meant what I said was probably
instrumental in

1388
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,698
getting the case closed...
What's your name, honey?

1389
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:50,493
Lisa Cohen.

1390
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:51,657
Okay.

1391
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,741
Don't call me "honey," okay?

1392
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:57,538
Okay.

1393
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,338
Are you not gonna help me
now that I've said that?

1394
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,752
Look, what's your name?

1395
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,128
Lisa Cohen!

1396
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:06,714
Okay, Lisa, first thing,
you're gonna calm down.

1397
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,765
I'm calm right now. Okay. Just checking.

1398
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:13,679
Second thing... Oh. Here he is,
your knight in shining armor.

1399
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,146
This guy givin' you a hard time?

1400
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,356
No.

1401
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:21,111
So now you're sayin' he ran the light.

1402
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:24,690
Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road.

1403
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,655
And I was definitely trying
to get his attention.

1404
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:28,735
Okay.

1405
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:31,322
Well, before we do anything, Lisa,

1406
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:34,417
anybody will tell you that just
because he ran a red light

1407
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,368
is not a criminal offense.
Even if he kills someone?

1408
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:39,956
Even if you cause an accidental
death, that's right.

1409
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:43,126
Now, in order for it to
be a criminal offense,

1410
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,462
the law says you need two aggravating
circumstances.

1411
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:50,132
Like he ran a red light
and he was speeding.

1412
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,307
Or he ran a red light and...

1413
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:52,551
So he's not liable to be prosecuted

1414
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,729
for manslaughter or 2nd degree murder?

1415
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:56,930
No.

1416
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,892
He could be charged with reckless driving,

1417
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:02,111
or filling out a false police report,

1418
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:03,233
which... That's no joke...

1419
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,442
That's unbelievable!

1420
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,273
What does he have to do?
Kill her on purpose?

1421
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:09,614
Yes. Because that's the
definition of murder.

1422
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,822
Killin' someone on purpose.

1423
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:16,617
Now, you're not sayin' that
he ran her over on purpose.

1424
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,078
Are you?

1425
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:24,045
Are you?

1426
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:30,927
No.

1427
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,262
Okay, look...

1428
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:41,229
Let me take another statement.

1429
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:43,523
We'll look into it, okay?

1430
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:44,941
You're kidding.

1431
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,610
No. I'll talk it over with my sergeant,

1432
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,946
probably pull this guy in again.

1433
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,868
Put a little pressure on him.

1434
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,537
We'll see what he says.

1435
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:57,449
Thank you!

1436
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:02,379
The Central Park Conservatory,
or whatever it's called,

1437
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:04,206
put up about 500 miles of these cheap,

1438
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:06,083
shitty-looking fences all over the park,

1439
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,588
which is totally antithetical to what

1440
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,131
the park was originally designed for.

1441
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:11,305
We are so gonna miss the game.

1442
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,222
Oh, my God, it's John!

1443
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,557
Hi, John.

1444
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:15,885
Hi, John.

1445
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,184
You want some?

1446
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,397
Come on, guys.

1447
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:27,939
Come on, you can't be smokin'
a J on your way

1448
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,236
to a school soccer game!

1449
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,902
Now, come on!
- Sorry!

1450
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:36,034
We're really sorry.

1451
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:46,294
So, how about how he was
like, "smokin' a J"?

1452
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:49,502
Like, "You can't be smokin' a J."

1453
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:53,215
Like, "Everybody, let's go over
to John's house and smoke a J."

1454
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,019
Hi, Mr. Aaron!

1455
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:08,521
Lisa, how are you?

1456
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,026
Pretty damn good. How are you?

1457
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,366
I'm all right. Tell me something.

1458
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,576
Whatever happened with that situation?

1459
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,700
Oh, I'm working on it. I'll tell
you all about it sometime.

1460
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:19,744
Hey, what kind of a bike is that?

1461
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:21,208
It's a Trek.

1462
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,039
I'm supposed to take a horseback riding

1463
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:24,874
trip with my father over Christmas break

1464
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:29,174
and I was wondering, does it bear any
resemblance to riding a bicycle?

1465
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,879
As far as I know, no.

1466
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,173
But you must have ridden a lot of horses.

1467
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,306
What makes you say that?

1468
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:40,886
Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming
or some place like that?

1469
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:42,767
Some place like what?

1470
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,606
You know, not New York.

1471
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,437
I'm actually from Indiana.

1472
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:49,770
But don't let me overwhelm you
with superfluous details.

1473
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,776
God, so what are you doing at
a New York private school

1474
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:56,156
teaching geometry to a bunch of
over-privileged liberal Jews?

1475
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,243
Well... Um...

1476
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:04,827
I came here to be a teacher,
and that's what I'm doing.

1477
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,583
So, would you say you've reached

1478
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,797
the summit of your lifelong ambition?

1479
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:15,880
Is that a real question or
is that a Lisa question?

1480
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:17,423
About half and half.

1481
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:18,761
In that case...

1482
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:19,971
Before you go.

1483
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,348
I'm actually thinking about getting
one of these. Can I try it?

1484
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,974
Just for a second?

1485
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:26,974
All right. Thanks.

1486
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,773
Here, I'll adjust the seat for you.

1487
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:31,520
Thank you.

1488
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,741
Watch my bag? Yeah.

1489
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:54,797
Oh, hi.

1490
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:57,971
Where've you been? I didn't
know if you wanted dinner.

1491
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,469
No, thanks. I'll order something.

1492
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,309
Someone named Emily called.

1493
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,057
And Detective Mitchell called from

1494
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,850
the Accident Investigation Squad.

1495
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,476
Is that that one we met?

1496
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,110
What's going on? Did you ever
go back and see him?

1497
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:15,356
I'd rather not talk about it when
you have one foot out the door,

1498
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:16,861
if that's okay.

1499
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:21,695
All right.

1500
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:24,497
I'm gonna go.

1501
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:25,661
Have a good show.

1502
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:26,867
Thank you.

1503
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:30,787
Dave, Lisa.

1504
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:32,214
Hi. How are you?

1505
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:34,958
So...

1506
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,259
Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends.

1507
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:42,967
He's a terrific lawyer, and if he
doesn't know what to do himself,

1508
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:45,097
he'll certainly know someone
we can talk to.

1509
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,474
Okay, great.

1510
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:50,183
When someone is killed, it's what's
called a wrongful death suit,

1511
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:53,272
which is a statutory case, which
means there's a statute

1512
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:56,275
passed by a legislature which gives
you the right to bring the case.

1513
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,652
As opposed to what?

1514
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:00,117
As opposed to common law, which
is law passed by judges

1515
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:01,739
which is why the damages are limited.

1516
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,240
I don't understand.

1517
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:04,658
Just skip that part.

1518
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:06,206
We don't care about that.

1519
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,249
I thought we were trying to get
the police to arrest this guy.

1520
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:09,538
No, the police are not gonna...

1521
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:10,785
Why not? They told me

1522
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:12,086
they were gonna look into it again.

1523
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:13,835
I'm just telling you that even if they do,

1524
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,712
there is no way in this world the
police are gonna recommend

1525
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,259
to the DA that they charge this guy.

1526
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,877
So, what can we do?

1527
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,382
I'm getting to that. Sorry.

1528
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:21,679
That's okay.
- That's okay, honey.

1529
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:23,883
I'm just getting to that.

1530
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,218
You can't do anything unless
you're a relative...

1531
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:30,268
She didn't have any relatives, except
for those idiots in Arizona.

1532
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:33,772
Hang on a minute. Or unless you're
the executor of her estate...

1533
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,648
I am the executor of her estate.

1534
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:37,567
Which is Emily. I know.

1535
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:40,987
Because the executor of her estate

1536
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:42,825
can bring a wrongful death suit,

1537
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:46,371
but the beneficiary has to be a relative.

1538
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:48,289
So let me explain about that.

1539
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:53,500
In a wrongful death suit you can
sue for pain and suffering,

1540
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,752
pecuniary losses, loss of
support or services.

1541
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,255
Also what's called care,
comfort and society.

1542
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:02,842
It's like advice or counseling
of the parent that the kids

1543
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:03,922
aren't gonna get anymore.

1544
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,056
I don't understand.

1545
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:07,350
Who are we suing? The bus driver?

1546
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,970
Well, no, because the bus driver
wouldn't have any money.

1547
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:12,431
You basically sue everybody
and hope something sticks.

1548
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:15,688
The person who pays will probably
be the MTA's insurance company.

1549
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,899
But do you think the driver
would get fired?

1550
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:20,155
No. Not necessarily.

1551
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:22,782
Even if all the facts came
out at the trial?

1552
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,328
Maybe. I don't know.

1553
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,288
But how much could they be liable for?

1554
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,037
It depends... How badly do you think

1555
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,163
we could ever hurt them?

1556
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:35,621
If she was alive, and in pain for
an extended period of time,

1557
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,714
they give more money for that.

1558
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:43,003
I'd say she was alive for 10 minutes.

1559
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:46,632
Was she conscious? Was she
awake the whole time?

1560
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,769
I'm sorry, Emily.

1561
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:55,807
Yeah, awake.

1562
01:29:57,851 --> 01:29:59,103
It's okay.

1563
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:00,528
Well...

1564
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:04,320
If she was in a lot of pain for that long,

1565
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:08,829
I don't know, maybe 300,000,
half a million dollars

1566
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:10,156
to get a sustainable verdict.

1567
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:13,492
A brain damaged baby would
be three million.

1568
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:17,337
But the truth is, Lisa, when
all is said and done,

1569
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:18,413
it's not a very good case.

1570
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:19,539
Why not?

1571
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,003
Because it's your word against his,

1572
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:24,131
and because you already lied
on your first deposition.

1573
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:27,848
A red light case is a 50-50
proposition already.

1574
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:31,598
And with only one eyewitness, with
two conflicting statements?

1575
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,721
I wouldn't take that case.

1576
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:41,858
Nobody really cares about getting
a lot of money here.

1577
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:43,280
I understand that, but...

1578
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:44,652
We just want this prick to suffer,

1579
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:46,324
and we want the bus company to take

1580
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,034
responsibility for hiring this guy.

1581
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,862
I understand that. But no
matter how you slice it,

1582
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:52,744
the fact that Lisa lied on her first

1583
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,707
statement is a disaster for your lawyer.

1584
01:30:57,202 --> 01:31:00,672
Can't I explain why I lied the first time?

1585
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:03,170
It's not like I'm trying to
get any money for myself.

1586
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:06,632
That's true. She has no
financial interest,

1587
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,179
she can't be impeached for bias.

1588
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,636
Impeached for what?

1589
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:13,677
She can't have her credibility
attacked on financial grounds

1590
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,013
because the jury knows you're not
gonna get any money if you win.

1591
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,393
So that's something, isn't it?

1592
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,816
But do you really think we
know what that means?

1593
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,438
I'm sorry. That's what it's called.

1594
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:23,111
But who are you talking to?

1595
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:25,648
You know we don't know what that means.

1596
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:29,860
It's like you're not really concentrating.
You're not concentrating.

1597
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,747
I don't know. I am concentrating.

1598
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,001
I'm just thinking out loud.

1599
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:39,577
Okay.

1600
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:43,753
All right. I'm sorry.

1601
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:47,506
I'm sorry!

1602
01:31:48,128 --> 01:31:50,426
Okay. All right.

1603
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:54,016
He wasn't always a lawyer, you know.

1604
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:56,470
He used to be a very nice, little boy.

1605
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:03,768
Anyway...

1606
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:04,860
Anyway, the whole point of this

1607
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:06,404
is to get... To fucking get this guy!

1608
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,278
It was to get him out from
behind the wheel of a bus!

1609
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:11,735
Did she know she was dying?

1610
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,205
I only ask because the terror of knowing

1611
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:21,544
you're dying raises the damages.

1612
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:25,256
I think she had a pretty good idea.

1613
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:32,301
If she had lived for a couple more days
it would make the case better.

1614
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:33,381
Thank you.

1615
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:35,850
Thanks.

1616
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:43,308
I know that sounds horrible, but
that's what it comes down to.

1617
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,153
We know, Dave.

1618
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:48,646
It's okay.

1619
01:32:55,695 --> 01:33:00,667
I would just like somebody to take
responsibility for what happened.

1620
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:17,426
"As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

1621
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:20,095
"They kill us for their sport."

1622
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:24,024
"As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

1623
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:27,151
"They kill us for their sport."

1624
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,192
What do you make of that?

1625
01:33:37,403 --> 01:33:39,872
Lisa? Lisa?

1626
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:42,541
I don't know.

1627
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:45,871
You know what, Lisa? That's
not good enough.

1628
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:47,168
That's just not good enough.

1629
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:49,796
Shakespeare wrote something.
What's your response?

1630
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,798
And don't tell me you don't have
one, 'cause I don't buy it.

1631
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:54,550
I don't really have a lot to say.

1632
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:56,680
It seems pretty self-evident to me.

1633
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:01,804
Matthew?

1634
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:02,978
I think it is self-evident.

1635
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,647
I think he's saying that human beings

1636
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:06,391
don't mean any more to the gods

1637
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:09,227
than flies do to little boys who
like to torture them for fun.

1638
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:13,282
As far as the gods are concerned,
we're just ants. Nothing.

1639
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:14,899
Darren?

1640
01:34:15,275 --> 01:34:16,367
Thank you, Matthew.

1641
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:20,913
Yeah, I agree. Only it's

1642
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:23,624
not Shakespeare saying
it, it's Gloucester.

1643
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,795
Maybe another character would have
a different point of view.

1644
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:30,290
Okay. That's a valid point.
Just because Shakespeare

1645
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:32,250
has one of his characters say something,

1646
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:34,252
doesn't mean he personally agrees with it.

1647
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:35,795
Yes, David?

1648
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:39,262
Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying
the gods don't care about us.

1649
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:42,435
Maybe he's saying there's a higher
consciousness that we can't see.

1650
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,308
That the gods' perception of reality

1651
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:46,272
is so much more developed than ours

1652
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:47,648
that, compared to their perception,

1653
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:50,603
our perceptions are like
comparing flies to boys.

1654
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:54,606
Okay, I really don't think that
that's what he's getting at.

1655
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,566
What I think he's getting at here

1656
01:34:56,649 --> 01:35:01,280
is a very dark view of the arbitrary
nature of human suffering.

1657
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:02,705
But maybe he's not.

1658
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,784
Maybe he's comparing human consciousness
to divine consciousness

1659
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,418
and that even though it seems to us

1660
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:09,003
that human suffering is just arbitrary,

1661
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:12,082
that's just because we're
limited by our viewpoint.

1662
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,585
Okay, I...

1663
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:17,386
I still don't think that's
what he's saying.

1664
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:20,136
No, like, if you say they
kill us for their sport,

1665
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:22,013
when our perception of
the gods is so meager

1666
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:24,469
that we can't even tell
what they're doing,

1667
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,054
then how can we be so arrogant as to think

1668
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,231
they'd even bother to kill
us for their sport?

1669
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:32,728
I don't know.

1670
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,567
Uh...

1671
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:36,990
Monica?

1672
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:39,864
I don't think that's what
he's saying at all.

1673
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:43,447
I think he's saying the gods don't
give a shit about human beings

1674
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:46,617
and that they just like to kill
and torture us for fun.

1675
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:49,745
But if the gods' consciousness is
so much more developed than ours

1676
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:51,462
that we seem like flies to them,

1677
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:53,790
then how can we be sure what
they have in mind for us

1678
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:55,125
or why they do anything?

1679
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,844
Okay, David, I think you've
made your point.

1680
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,424
But it's not what Shakespeare meant.

1681
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:00,721
Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent

1682
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:02,090
that he's trying to say something...

1683
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,390
Scholarly opinion?

1684
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:04,725
...about human suffering here.

1685
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:07,595
What are you saying? 1,000
Frenchmen can't be wrong?

1686
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,722
No, I'm not saying that. But
I would like to move on...

1687
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:11,308
Well, I think he is saying that.

1688
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:13,985
Because he's comparing human
consciousness to flies

1689
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,607
and he's saying we can't
see the truth around us

1690
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,314
because our consciousness is undeveloped.

1691
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:21,027
No, David, you're wrong. That's
not what Shakespeare meant.

1692
01:36:21,276 --> 01:36:22,744
He says it somewhere else in the play,

1693
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,362
but I don't want to get hung up on this,

1694
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:27,198
because that's not what Shakespeare meant.

1695
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,077
I would really like to move on.

1696
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,223
"Poor Tom's a-cold."

1697
01:36:49,387 --> 01:36:50,889
Detective Mitchell.

1698
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:52,974
Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling.

1699
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:55,526
Hi, Lisa, what can I do for you?

1700
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:58,988
I was just wondering whatever happened,
if anything, with the case.

1701
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:00,906
You said you might re-interview
the bus driver.

1702
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:03,072
Yes, we did. We brought him back in.

1703
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,662
You did? What happened?

1704
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:09,207
Well, he basically stuck by
his original representation

1705
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:11,410
and that was pretty much it.

1706
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:14,500
I brought it up with my sergeant,
and he agreed with me

1707
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:18,049
that we still don't have enough
to charge this guy,

1708
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:22,129
so there's not a lot more
we can do at this point.

1709
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:26,011
Well, I'm not trying to tell
you how to do your job,

1710
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,592
but how did you ask the questions?

1711
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:29,473
Excuse me?

1712
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:30,641
He's obviously not gonna

1713
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,974
change his statement if you just ask
him really politely. Why would he?

1714
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:35,479
We already know he's a liar.

1715
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,022
Hey, in the old days, Lisa,

1716
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,354
we'd just throw him in the back
room with a rubber hose

1717
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:41,360
and get whatever answer
we want out of him.

1718
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:43,658
But, fortunately, we don't
do that anymore.

1719
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:44,950
Yeah, not to white people.

1720
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:46,573
Excuse me?

1721
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:49,451
You don't do it to white people.
Anyway, I'm not saying you...

1722
01:37:49,655 --> 01:37:50,907
Wait. We don't do it to who?

1723
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:52,284
Oh' my God! Shh!

1724
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:54,415
First of all, I don't understand

1725
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,253
why you bring this guy's race into it.

1726
01:37:56,788 --> 01:37:58,165
There's 40,000 cops in this city...

1727
01:37:58,289 --> 01:37:59,666
Yes...

1728
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:03,216
And I hate to disillusion you, but
most of them are pretty good guys

1729
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:04,762
just tryin' to do their job.

1730
01:38:04,837 --> 01:38:09,468
Now, the bottom line is the DA
is not gonna take this case.

1731
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:14,472
Now, you could take it up with my sergeant
if you want to, but he's...

1732
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:15,602
Yes, I would.

1733
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:17,900
Well, I will patch you through, then.

1734
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:22,606
The original decision was based
on false information.

1735
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:25,616
So what's the point of even bringing...

1736
01:38:27,402 --> 01:38:29,279
So there's no way to appeal?

1737
01:38:32,073 --> 01:38:33,746
But how do you know Detective Mitchell

1738
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:35,584
interrogated him aggressively enough

1739
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,003
if you weren't there?

1740
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,497
What's going on?

1741
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:44,715
My family is all there still,

1742
01:38:44,794 --> 01:38:47,263
but Rodrigo is studying in London,

1743
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:52,177
and Hector is in Geneva.

1744
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:53,432
Uh-huh.

1745
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:56,348
I'm sure they will go back
eventually because

1746
01:38:56,514 --> 01:38:59,609
they will like to do something
for their country.

1747
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:03,188
But it's a worry. It's very bad there now.

1748
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:06,150
Yeah? I haven't really been following it.

1749
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:11,158
It's a big mess. Last year I helped
to found an organization

1750
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:15,083
to work with children whose
families have been killed

1751
01:39:15,158 --> 01:39:17,001
or the parents have been kidnapped.

1752
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:24,089
We try to find homes for them,
preferably in Colombia,

1753
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:29,469
because if we lose our young
people, that's it.

1754
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:32,054
That's the future.

1755
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,809
Yeah. I wish I knew more about it.

1756
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:44,646
You think Lisa would be
interested in acting?

1757
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:48,115
No. I don't.

1758
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,528
I think she has a lot of contempt
for it, actually.

1759
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:54,573
Anyway, maybe it's the age.

1760
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:58,998
She would prefer the world
with no plays? No films?

1761
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:01,579
Oh. Who knows?

1762
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:09,049
Would you like to see a
picture of my mother?

1763
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:11,093
Sure.

1764
01:40:11,923 --> 01:40:14,426
These are all my aunts and uncles.

1765
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:16,307
See? Big family. Mmm.

1766
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:11,148
So after I talked to you
guys the other day,

1767
01:43:11,227 --> 01:43:13,355
I called this P.I. I know
to see if he could...

1768
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,609
You called a what? A what?

1769
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:18,075
Private investigator, to see if he could

1770
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,160
find anything out about your bus driver.

1771
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:21,237
Really? Yeah.

1772
01:43:21,529 --> 01:43:22,701
Dave! I can't believe you called...

1773
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:23,994
Wait, let me tell you what he said.

1774
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:25,791
So he calls someone he knows who

1775
01:43:25,908 --> 01:43:27,626
used to work as a cop at the MTA.

1776
01:43:28,911 --> 01:43:30,788
And you know the MTA have
their own police?

1777
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:32,373
The MTA police?

1778
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,003
They have their own uniforms...

1779
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:35,585
Yeah? Yeah?

1780
01:43:35,668 --> 01:43:37,386
Just a minute! Jesus Christ!

1781
01:43:37,795 --> 01:43:41,971
What the fuck do we care about the
MTA police and their uniforms?

1782
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:47,180
Okay, so this guy gets a
look at your guy's file.

1783
01:43:47,263 --> 01:43:48,685
It turns out he's had two previous

1784
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,641
accidents less than two years apart.

1785
01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:51,813
What?

1786
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:53,690
But that he's never been
disciplined or cited,

1787
01:43:54,019 --> 01:43:55,441
just moved around to different shifts.

1788
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:56,568
Are you kidding me?

1789
01:43:56,689 --> 01:43:57,781
Why does this not shock me?

1790
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,692
If you read the papers, you'll know that

1791
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:01,448
they're going through a protracted

1792
01:44:01,569 --> 01:44:03,116
labor dispute at the MTA right now.

1793
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,913
And according to my P.I.,

1794
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:07,993
management doesn't want to aggravate
the situation by firing this guy.

1795
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:09,919
This is making me sick.

1796
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,247
I know, but what it means, Lisa,
is that we have a case.

1797
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:14,089
We do? We can now sue

1798
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,259
for what's called "negligent retention."

1799
01:44:16,333 --> 01:44:19,086
Which just means they should have
known this guy was a bad risk,

1800
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:22,674
and they negligently retained him until,
finally, he killed somebody.

1801
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,717
You can prove that? Sure, because

1802
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,223
we can just subpoena their
personnel records,

1803
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:29,852
which we already know contain
damaging information.

1804
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,022
But you wouldn't be our lawyer, right?

1805
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:32,274
No.

1806
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:33,350
Why not?

1807
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:34,518
I'm not a personal injury litigator.

1808
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:35,686
It's not his area.

1809
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:38,319
I don't know enough about
it. I would lose.

1810
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:40,859
But you could recommend someone?

1811
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:43,369
Sure, sure.

1812
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:46,117
I know a very good guy.

1813
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:49,041
His name is Russel Deutsch.
He's not a sleazebag.

1814
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:52,040
Very, very experienced.

1815
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:54,543
You gotta get that crazy cousin on board,

1816
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:56,378
she's gonna be your beneficiary.

1817
01:44:56,457 --> 01:44:58,050
She's not gonna want to come to New York.

1818
01:44:58,375 --> 01:44:59,968
I can tell you that right now.

1819
01:45:00,586 --> 01:45:05,968
If you win, she stands to get anywhere
from $300,000 to $500,000.

1820
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:08,178
She's coming to New York.

1821
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:10,054
You're awesome!

1822
01:45:11,055 --> 01:45:14,309
First thing we do is we file
a summons and a complaint

1823
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:17,144
against the MTA. They get
20 days to respond,

1824
01:45:17,478 --> 01:45:20,152
and when they do, we can make
our discovery requests.

1825
01:45:20,231 --> 01:45:22,859
Accident reports, personnel
records, etcetera.

1826
01:45:22,942 --> 01:45:27,038
But now, you gotta realize, this
is going to take some time.

1827
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,783
The law says you have to have
a court date within one year.

1828
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:33,752
Usually it takes around six, depending.

1829
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:34,829
Six years?

1830
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:35,913
Yes, depending.

1831
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,582
Now, I mentioned to Dave,

1832
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:40,589
I have a friend who writes for the
Metro section of The Times.

1833
01:45:40,668 --> 01:45:42,762
Yes, now, if it could really happen,

1834
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,014
this changes everything in our favor.

1835
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:47,217
If they think there's gonna
be adverse publicity,

1836
01:45:47,299 --> 01:45:48,846
especially in The New York Times,

1837
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:50,052
they're gonna want to settle right away,

1838
01:45:50,135 --> 01:45:52,888
as soon as possible, and
as quietly as possible.

1839
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:55,607
So they'd make it a condition
that we didn't...

1840
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:58,110
It usually works, you get the money,
but you can't talk about it.

1841
01:45:58,435 --> 01:45:59,436
Nobody knows the terms.

1842
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:01,647
So what good does that do?

1843
01:46:01,814 --> 01:46:03,441
You get the money.

1844
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:05,442
Is that bad?

1845
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:10,656
This is how our society punishes
people for doing bad things.

1846
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:13,375
By getting money from their employers'
insurance companies?

1847
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:15,748
Yes. It's called "punitive damages."

1848
01:46:17,496 --> 01:46:20,625
Could we insist they fire the driver?
As part of the settlement?

1849
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,464
Sure, why not?

1850
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:24,550
Is that something people do?

1851
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:25,754
Sure. It's one of your conditions.

1852
01:46:26,171 --> 01:46:28,970
And you think we're gonna win?

1853
01:46:29,884 --> 01:46:31,727
They're gonna settle? Oh,
they're gonna settle.

1854
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:42,229
Oh. Hi.

1855
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:45,150
I want to talk to you.

1856
01:46:45,733 --> 01:46:48,077
I take it that's my report card?

1857
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:49,571
It sure is.

1858
01:46:57,328 --> 01:47:00,832
I had a friend who used to live
on this block, at 262?

1859
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:02,791
Oh.

1860
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:06,004
That's so nice. Yeah, I don't
know if you know her.

1861
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:08,509
Cheryl Rowan? She's a physiotherapist?

1862
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:11,513
No, I don't know her.

1863
01:47:11,592 --> 01:47:13,265
I think about 1,000 people must...

1864
01:47:13,344 --> 01:47:14,516
What?

1865
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:16,639
Nothing.

1866
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:20,067
Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?

1867
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:21,811
Oh, yeah.

1868
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:23,612
It's really good, you should go see it.

1869
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:27,191
Well, the play is great, and it
has this really nice cast.

1870
01:47:27,358 --> 01:47:30,111
She's being modest. She's gonna
win every award in New York.

1871
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:32,409
Oh, all that stuff's a long way off.

1872
01:47:32,988 --> 01:47:34,956
I don't go to the theater very much.

1873
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:38,582
No, it's just nice, because you can
work a long time in the theater

1874
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:42,040
and play a lot of great parts and
not get a lot of recognition.

1875
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:43,749
And even though you don't necessarily

1876
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:45,501
do it for that as your primary motive,

1877
01:47:45,584 --> 01:47:47,632
it is nice when people do notice
something you've done.

1878
01:47:47,711 --> 01:47:48,712
Mmm-hmm.

1879
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:50,844
I was on a television
show a few years ago.

1880
01:47:50,965 --> 01:47:52,638
I'd been doing theater all my life,

1881
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:56,220
and suddenly all my relatives started
calling to congratulate me

1882
01:47:56,303 --> 01:47:58,146
because they thought I'd finally made it.

1883
01:47:58,222 --> 01:48:00,975
All it was was this dumb show that
paid the bills for a while.

1884
01:48:01,058 --> 01:48:03,186
That show was so stupid.

1885
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:05,270
Well, it wasn't that bad.

1886
01:48:06,939 --> 01:48:09,488
Anyway, I realize this is horribly
embarrassing for Lisa,

1887
01:48:09,692 --> 01:48:12,241
but I just really wanted
to meet you, Emily,

1888
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:16,665
because you've frankly become such
a big part of Lisa's life,

1889
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:19,209
and I don't want to be intrusive,

1890
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:22,413
but this whole court case seems to
be suddenly dominating everything

1891
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:24,123
and I can't get Lisa to tell
me anything about it.

1892
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:25,173
That's not true.

1893
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:26,466
Well, I can't.

1894
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:29,215
I want you to know, Lisa,

1895
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:32,173
I'm very, very proud of you for pursuing
this the way that you have.

1896
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,884
But I can't let you pursue it to the point

1897
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:36,344
where it's taking over your life

1898
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:38,350
or interfering with your schoolwork.

1899
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:40,806
See, it's come down to a
question of homework.

1900
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:43,438
Lisa's on a half scholarship
at her school.

1901
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:47,397
I know she feels a real sense of responsibility
about what happened.

1902
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:49,736
Yeah, I do.

1903
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:53,194
I know you do. I know you do. But
you can't not do your homework

1904
01:48:53,277 --> 01:48:55,450
and you can't throw away your
scholarship because of it.

1905
01:48:55,612 --> 01:48:59,116
I'm not. My grades slipped a
little. They'll get better.

1906
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:02,912
Anyone can do their homework.
You just sit down and do it.

1907
01:49:03,037 --> 01:49:04,960
I've been distracted. I'll stop.

1908
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:09,631
All right. We didn't need a
big conference about it.

1909
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:11,053
It's not a big conference.

1910
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:14,632
I just wanted to know what was going on.

1911
01:49:16,091 --> 01:49:17,718
And I wanted to meet Emily.

1912
01:49:18,969 --> 01:49:20,812
I know it's a little awkward.

1913
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,982
Lisa? Do you think Emily would
like to see the play'?

1914
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:31,691
I thought you could both come, and
then we could go out afterwards.

1915
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:33,151
All right. Let me ask her.

1916
01:49:36,195 --> 01:49:37,617
Okay.

1917
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:40,491
Dig in, everybody.

1918
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:46,830
I was thinking about spending
next year with Dad.

1919
01:49:48,624 --> 01:49:50,126
Oh? Yeah.

1920
01:49:51,126 --> 01:49:52,469
You're worried about my grades.

1921
01:49:52,544 --> 01:49:54,217
They have really good public
schools in Santa Monica

1922
01:49:54,296 --> 01:49:55,889
and if I officially lived with him,

1923
01:49:55,964 --> 01:49:57,807
you wouldn't have to worry
about my scholarship.

1924
01:49:59,051 --> 01:50:00,724
Have you talked to him about this?

1925
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:02,562
We've had some general discussions.

1926
01:50:02,638 --> 01:50:04,231
Do you want to go, too?
- Me?

1927
01:50:04,306 --> 01:50:05,353
Yeah. Do you want to move to LA, too?

1928
01:50:05,474 --> 01:50:06,521
No.

1929
01:50:06,725 --> 01:50:08,102
Well, let me know if you do.

1930
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:09,983
Why are you being like this?

1931
01:50:10,062 --> 01:50:11,689
Why am I being like what?

1932
01:50:11,814 --> 01:50:13,066
Why are you about to start crying?

1933
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:15,325
Because it's your intention
to make me start crying!

1934
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,743
No, it's not.

1935
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:18,866
You want to move to LA, move to LA.

1936
01:50:18,987 --> 01:50:20,204
Why can't this even be mentioned

1937
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,452
without you taking it personally?

1938
01:50:21,532 --> 01:50:23,455
I'm just introducing a possibility!

1939
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:26,629
Here's a possibility, that you can
make your own fucking dinner!

1940
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:28,751
Here's a possibility, that you can
do whatever you want to do...

1941
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:30,128
Jesus Christ! What is with you?

1942
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:31,800
I don't care anymore, you heartless
little fucking bitch!

1943
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:33,297
Keep it up! This really makes
me want to stay here!

1944
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,129
You think you're so fucking perfect?

1945
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:36,213
No!

1946
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:40,016
Nice one.

1947
01:50:40,092 --> 01:50:41,093
Shut Up!

1948
01:50:43,637 --> 01:50:45,355
Let me tell you something, Eliot.

1949
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:26,267
How would you describe the
relationship overall?

1950
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:31,443
Did you talk on the phone a lot?
Were there a lot of visits?

1951
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:33,275
I would say we talked on the phone

1952
01:51:33,395 --> 01:51:35,113
a couple of times a month, at least.

1953
01:51:35,564 --> 01:51:39,159
Sometimes more than that. I would
call her, she would call me.

1954
01:51:40,277 --> 01:51:43,702
And what were the nature
of the conversations?

1955
01:51:44,031 --> 01:51:48,127
Oh, family stuff, mostly.
Her family, my kids.

1956
01:51:48,785 --> 01:51:51,129
She'd give you advice about your
family? That kind of thing?

1957
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:53,879
Oh, I would say so, yes.

1958
01:51:54,416 --> 01:51:55,588
Do you have any phone records?

1959
01:51:55,667 --> 01:51:58,511
I have all my phone bills,
if that's what you mean.

1960
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:00,847
I didn't record the actual conversations.

1961
01:52:00,923 --> 01:52:02,049
No, no.

1962
01:52:02,132 --> 01:52:04,885
You'll see we talked on the
phone quite frequently.

1963
01:52:05,177 --> 01:52:07,145
Okay, terrific. I see you came prepared.

1964
01:52:07,262 --> 01:52:09,185
Well, I wanted to bring everything.

1965
01:52:09,473 --> 01:52:12,067
Now, when they take your deposition,

1966
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:13,985
you're gonna say the same
thing you just told me.

1967
01:52:14,061 --> 01:52:15,358
Just talk about the relationship.

1968
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:16,898
Uh-huh.

1969
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:18,277
Kind of advice she used to give.

1970
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:19,650
Okay.

1971
01:52:22,236 --> 01:52:25,456
Now, Emily, where did
you find this lawyer?

1972
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:28,417
He was recommended by my friend.

1973
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:34,840
I'm asking because my husband knows
a real good New York lawyer

1974
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:37,008
and I'm not entirely comfortable

1975
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:38,672
with someone no one's ever heard of.

1976
01:52:38,835 --> 01:52:41,839
My friend's heard of him.
He says he's very good.

1977
01:52:42,089 --> 01:52:43,432
Well, I'm sure he is.

1978
01:52:43,507 --> 01:52:46,727
But I have a responsibility
in this situation

1979
01:52:47,511 --> 01:52:49,184
and I would feel a whole lot more

1980
01:52:49,304 --> 01:52:50,931
comfortable with someone who didn't just

1981
01:52:51,014 --> 01:52:52,732
drop in out of the clear blue sky.

1982
01:52:52,808 --> 01:52:55,061
He didn't drop in out of
the clear blue sky.

1983
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:57,529
He was recommended by my friend.

1984
01:52:58,647 --> 01:53:03,323
But, Abigail, even if we switched lawyers,
we'd still have to pay him.

1985
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:06,617
It all comes out of the settlement,
so it's really up to you.

1986
01:53:06,697 --> 01:53:08,665
No, if you all think he's good...

1987
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:10,538
I don't know whether he is or not.

1988
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:12,044
My friend thinks he is.

1989
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:13,545
All right.

1990
01:53:15,163 --> 01:53:17,791
Now, Lisa, what's your involvement
in all this?

1991
01:53:17,874 --> 01:53:19,547
What's your angle?

1992
01:53:20,502 --> 01:53:22,925
I just wanted to...

1993
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:26,425
I was just there.

1994
01:53:29,886 --> 01:53:32,480
And that's you and Monica, obviously.

1995
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:34,228
Mmm-hmm.

1996
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,398
Oh, my God, is that you?

1997
01:53:38,854 --> 01:53:40,197
That's me.

1998
01:53:43,775 --> 01:53:45,573
Oh, my God. Is that her daughter?

1999
01:53:46,987 --> 01:53:48,284
Mmm-hmm.

2000
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:49,994
God...

2001
01:53:50,198 --> 01:53:52,326
So, how old was she when she died?

2002
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:54,786
Twelve.

2003
01:53:55,662 --> 01:53:57,289
God, I can't even imagine.

2004
01:53:58,290 --> 01:53:59,416
Neither could we.

2005
01:54:03,587 --> 01:54:08,138
Do you know Monica asked about
her when she was dying?

2006
01:54:10,552 --> 01:54:11,929
No, I didn't.

2007
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,348
Yeah, I think she was confused, like,

2008
01:54:14,723 --> 01:54:17,067
I think she thought I was her
daughter for a minute.

2009
01:54:17,309 --> 01:54:19,107
Then she was asking me to call her,

2010
01:54:19,227 --> 01:54:21,025
like, to tell her what happened, you know?

2011
01:54:21,438 --> 01:54:23,361
Like she didn't remember she was dead.

2012
01:54:25,817 --> 01:54:29,993
But, then it got confusing, because
I said, "Sure, what's her name'?"

2013
01:54:30,405 --> 01:54:31,907
And she said her name was Lisa.

2014
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:33,579
And I said, "No, that's my name."

2015
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:37,583
I didn't realize we had the same name.

2016
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:43,502
And when I found out her
daughter was dead,

2017
01:54:44,002 --> 01:54:45,299
ever since then

2018
01:54:45,796 --> 01:54:48,424
I've had this really strange feeling that,

2019
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:51,176
some way, for those last five minutes,

2020
01:54:52,052 --> 01:54:54,054
I kind of was her daughter.

2021
01:54:54,638 --> 01:54:57,983
You know, like in some weird way,
this obviously amazing woman

2022
01:54:58,350 --> 01:55:00,102
got to be with her daughter again

2023
01:55:00,227 --> 01:55:01,979
for a few minutes, right before she died.

2024
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:06,575
And is she still inhabiting your body?

2025
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:09,824
Or did she go right back to the
spirit world after it was over?

2026
01:55:09,945 --> 01:55:12,289
I didn't mean she was literally
inhabiting my body.

2027
01:55:12,364 --> 01:55:13,661
I don't believe in all that stuff at all.

2028
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:16,118
I don't give a fuck what you believe in.

2029
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:18,420
Oh, my God! Why are you so mad at me?

2030
01:55:18,495 --> 01:55:20,338
Because this is not an opera!

2031
01:55:20,455 --> 01:55:23,004
What? I said this is not an opera!

2032
01:55:23,083 --> 01:55:24,881
You think I think this is an opera?

2033
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:27,133
Yes! Because I think it's dramatic?

2034
01:55:27,337 --> 01:55:28,589
I think you're very young.

2035
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:30,015
What does that have to do with anything?

2036
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:32,969
If anything, I think it means I care
more than someone who's older,

2037
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:35,019
because this kind of thing has
never happened to me before!

2038
01:55:35,429 --> 01:55:39,809
No, it means you care more easily.
There's a big difference.

2039
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:42,102
Only it's not you that it's happening to.

2040
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:45,314
Yes, it is! I know I'm not the one
who was run over by a bus...

2041
01:55:45,397 --> 01:55:46,614
That's right, you weren't.

2042
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:48,613
And you're not the one
who died of leukemia

2043
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:51,662
and you're not the one who just died
in an earthquake in Algeria!

2044
01:55:51,736 --> 01:55:54,410
But you will be. Do you understand
me? You will be.

2045
01:55:54,531 --> 01:55:55,532
And it's not dramatic.

2046
01:55:55,615 --> 01:55:56,616
I'm well aware of that!

2047
01:55:56,700 --> 01:56:00,625
This first-blush, phony deepness
of yours is worth nothing.

2048
01:56:00,704 --> 01:56:01,751
Oh, wow. Do you understand?

2049
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,298
It's not worth anything!

2050
01:56:03,498 --> 01:56:05,375
Because it'll all be troweled
over in a month or two.

2051
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:06,460
And when you get older

2052
01:56:06,543 --> 01:56:09,922
and you don't have a big reaction
every time a dog is run over,

2053
01:56:10,005 --> 01:56:11,882
then we'll find out what kind
of a person you are!

2054
01:56:12,257 --> 01:56:13,804
I'm sorry, but I didn't start this

2055
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:15,472
conversation and I don't play these games.

2056
01:56:15,552 --> 01:56:16,895
I'm not playing games!

2057
01:56:17,053 --> 01:56:18,396
And don't look so outraged!

2058
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:21,100
You have every right to
falsify your own life,

2059
01:56:21,183 --> 01:56:24,357
but you have no right to
falsify anybody else's.

2060
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:26,734
It's what makes people into Nazis!

2061
01:56:27,272 --> 01:56:29,616
And I'm sorry, but it's just
a little suspicious

2062
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:30,988
that you're making such a big fuss

2063
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:32,452
about this when you didn't even know her

2064
01:56:32,527 --> 01:56:34,074
and you're having troubles
with your own mother.

2065
01:56:34,154 --> 01:56:35,155
Oh, my God!

2066
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:38,329
But this is my life we're talking about,

2067
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:41,420
'cause it's my real friend who got killed,

2068
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:44,547
who I'm never going to see again,

2069
01:56:44,706 --> 01:56:48,176
who I've known since I was
19 years old myself.

2070
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:52,055
And I don't want that sucked into some
adolescent self-dramatization!

2071
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:56,431
I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!
I was there and you weren't,

2072
01:56:56,593 --> 01:56:57,765
and if I happen to express myself

2073
01:56:57,928 --> 01:56:59,100
a little hyperbolically, Emily,

2074
01:56:59,179 --> 01:57:00,681
that's just the way I talk!

2075
01:57:00,764 --> 01:57:02,562
I can't help it if my mother's an actress!

2076
01:57:02,682 --> 01:57:04,434
Why are you being so fucking strident?

2077
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:07,233
"Strident"? Yeah.

2078
01:57:07,312 --> 01:57:08,438
Okay.

2079
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:10,398
You should leave.

2080
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:11,817
Why? Because I called you strident?

2081
01:57:12,108 --> 01:57:13,951
Yeah. You should leave.

2082
01:57:14,194 --> 01:57:15,286
Okay, I will.

2083
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:17,080
Now! Okay, let me get my bag!

2084
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,907
All I meant by saying you were strident

2085
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:20,705
is that you were being emphatic!

2086
01:57:20,784 --> 01:57:22,206
I obviously misused the word.

2087
01:57:22,285 --> 01:57:23,582
Look it up when you get home.

2088
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:25,000
Jesus Christ. You're amazing.

2089
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,377
Yes. I'm amazing.

2090
01:57:26,498 --> 01:57:27,841
Why are you doing this?

2091
01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:31,261
Lisa, I'm not doing anything.
I'm a human being.

2092
01:57:31,545 --> 01:57:33,388
Monica was a human being.

2093
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:35,340
So was her daughter and so is your mother.

2094
01:57:35,423 --> 01:57:37,221
We are not supporting characters

2095
01:57:37,342 --> 01:57:39,185
in the fascinating story of your life.

2096
01:57:39,261 --> 01:57:41,104
I never said or thought you were,

2097
01:57:41,179 --> 01:57:42,931
and I really didn't mean
to call you strident.

2098
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:44,808
I totally misused the word.

2099
01:57:44,891 --> 01:57:47,644
I wasn't trying to insult you,
Emily. I really wasn't.

2100
01:57:47,894 --> 01:57:50,522
I feel so bad about what happened

2101
01:57:50,605 --> 01:57:53,449
and I'm trying so hard to
do something about it.

2102
01:57:53,525 --> 01:57:55,778
I don't understand why, if
I say something wrong,

2103
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:58,113
you can't just give me a break.

2104
01:57:59,948 --> 01:58:01,495
Thanks for letting me come over.

2105
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:04,001
I know you don't want me here.

2106
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,203
It's all right.

2107
01:58:05,287 --> 01:58:07,289
But I didn't have anyone else to talk to.

2108
01:58:08,164 --> 01:58:11,088
You have always been very sympathetic
to my craziness,

2109
01:58:11,376 --> 01:58:13,049
and I may not show it all the time,

2110
01:58:13,169 --> 01:58:14,887
but I actually really appreciate it.

2111
01:58:15,005 --> 01:58:16,131
It's no problem.

2112
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:20,267
So...

2113
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:22,349
What's been going on?

2114
01:58:23,722 --> 01:58:24,974
I just need to talk to somebody

2115
01:58:25,056 --> 01:58:28,356
who doesn't completely misunderstand
who I am.

2116
01:58:28,685 --> 01:58:30,358
Or not even who I am,

2117
01:58:30,437 --> 01:58:33,407
but what's going on inside
me, or all around me.

2118
01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:35,696
Sound confused enough?

2119
01:58:35,817 --> 01:58:37,069
No, no.

2120
01:58:37,861 --> 01:58:41,411
Anyway, for whatever reason,

2121
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:45,252
I always felt like we understood
each other on some level.

2122
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:48,914
Even though I'm like this mass
of conflicting impulses,

2123
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:52,550
and you're basically the most
grownup, rational man I know.

2124
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:56,721
I doubt that's actually
true, but thank you.

2125
01:59:00,008 --> 01:59:01,885
It's just a little hot.

2126
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,062
A little warm.

2127
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:13,730
Is this all right?

2128
01:59:13,897 --> 01:59:14,898
Yeah, it's fine.

2129
01:59:17,942 --> 01:59:19,865
Do you allow smoking in your apartment?

2130
01:59:23,823 --> 01:59:24,995
You can smoke.

2131
01:59:45,053 --> 01:59:46,054
I like your apartment.

2132
01:59:46,137 --> 01:59:47,138
Thanks.

2133
01:59:47,305 --> 01:59:49,228
It's a sublet, actually.

2134
01:59:52,394 --> 01:59:53,737
Sorry. That's okay.

2135
02:00:09,452 --> 02:00:10,624
This is terrible.

2136
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,505
What is?

2137
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:21,215
What's terrible?

2138
02:00:23,591 --> 02:00:25,514
I just like you so much.

2139
02:00:25,885 --> 02:00:27,262
Sorry. What a moron.

2140
02:00:27,387 --> 02:00:28,809
Hey, Lisa. Lisa.

2141
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:32,267
I'm your friend.

2142
02:00:33,268 --> 02:00:35,316
And that's not gonna change.

2143
02:00:36,813 --> 02:00:38,281
It's not gonna change.

2144
02:00:39,774 --> 02:00:40,900
Thanks.

2145
02:00:44,154 --> 02:00:46,077
I like you so, so much.

2146
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:27,743
What's it like in Indiana?

2147
02:01:30,867 --> 02:01:31,914
It's okay.

2148
02:01:52,055 --> 02:01:54,399
Please don't do that. Don't do that.

2149
02:01:57,393 --> 02:02:00,146
I really wasn't expecting anything
like this to happen.

2150
02:02:02,106 --> 02:02:04,575
I'm really not sure how
I'm supposed to react.

2151
02:02:05,109 --> 02:02:06,611
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody,

2152
02:02:06,736 --> 02:02:08,283
if that's what you're worried about.

2153
02:02:08,363 --> 02:02:10,582
I totally initiated the whole thing.

2154
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:13,664
Anyway, it's just sex. You're
acting like a little kid.

2155
02:02:13,743 --> 02:02:15,666
I'll see you in school.

2156
02:02:28,883 --> 02:02:30,305
You're a fuckin' idiot!

2157
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:33,980
I think teenagers should definitely
rule the world because

2158
02:02:34,055 --> 02:02:36,353
teenagers aren't corrupted
by adult life yet

2159
02:02:36,474 --> 02:02:38,772
and they're idealistic and they care.

2160
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:41,070
And I know a lot of people feel

2161
02:02:41,187 --> 02:02:43,110
that teenagers are really naive,

2162
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:45,032
which they are, many of them.

2163
02:02:45,441 --> 02:02:46,863
But they still haven't had a chance

2164
02:02:46,985 --> 02:02:48,407
to get burned out by the disappointments

2165
02:02:48,486 --> 02:02:50,830
and harsh realities of learning
how to play the game.

2166
02:02:50,905 --> 02:02:52,999
So, yes, I would vote "yes."

2167
02:02:53,324 --> 02:02:55,622
All right. Lisa?

2168
02:02:55,952 --> 02:02:56,999
I'm not even gonna comment on the fact

2169
02:02:57,078 --> 02:02:59,251
that you just compared a
19-year-old Palestinian

2170
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:00,502
to a member of the Hitler Youth!

2171
02:03:00,582 --> 02:03:02,676
That's right, because they
both like to kill Jews.

2172
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:04,047
Lisa! Hey! Come on, guys.

2173
02:03:04,127 --> 02:03:05,845
It's not because they've been
occupied and humiliated

2174
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,763
and bombed out of their homes
for the last 50 years?

2175
02:03:07,839 --> 02:03:08,931
That's partly why they like it.

2176
02:03:09,007 --> 02:03:10,759
It's not like killing civilians
is their last resort.

2177
02:03:10,842 --> 02:03:13,391
It's their first resort because
it's easy and they like it.

2178
02:03:13,469 --> 02:03:14,891
Raise your hands. They like it?

2179
02:03:14,971 --> 02:03:16,268
They're just bad people and they like it?

2180
02:03:16,347 --> 02:03:17,439
Yes! There are bad people in the world.

2181
02:03:17,515 --> 02:03:19,392
I think they liked blowing
up the World Trade Center!

2182
02:03:19,475 --> 02:03:21,068
They kill their own sisters
when they get raped!

2183
02:03:21,144 --> 02:03:22,145
Who? It's called barbarism!

2184
02:03:22,228 --> 02:03:24,151
It's practically all people
do is kill each other.

2185
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:25,732
If they didn't like it,
they wouldn't do it.

2186
02:03:25,815 --> 02:03:27,408
You guys aren't the only
ones in the class!

2187
02:03:27,483 --> 02:03:28,484
You're not even Jewish, Lisa!

2188
02:03:28,568 --> 02:03:30,946
The next person who opens their mouth
without raising their hand...

2189
02:03:31,029 --> 02:03:32,451
I'm fucking half Jewish, and who cares

2190
02:03:32,572 --> 02:03:33,994
what I am? I'm anti-murder,
not pro-Israel.

2191
02:03:34,073 --> 02:03:35,871
Lisa! You can leave!

2192
02:03:36,075 --> 02:03:38,328
Fine. Thank you.

2193
02:03:50,632 --> 02:03:52,009
I guess I lost my cool a little,

2194
02:03:52,133 --> 02:03:53,510
but there is such a thing as...

2195
02:03:53,593 --> 02:03:55,061
Who is running these discussions?

2196
02:03:55,136 --> 02:03:56,934
But, Lisa, you have to remember,

2197
02:03:57,013 --> 02:03:59,266
it's always easy for the dominant side

2198
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:01,688
to be content with the status quo.

2199
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:05,070
How do you mean, Ramon?

2200
02:04:05,355 --> 02:04:09,451
I mean the oppressor uses violence
to maintain his position

2201
02:04:09,525 --> 02:04:11,493
and calls it the rule of law.

2202
02:04:12,195 --> 02:04:16,371
But when the person underfoot uses
violence to change his status,

2203
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:18,543
he's called a criminal and a terrorist.

2204
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:22,998
And the violence of the state is
called upon to put him down.

2205
02:04:23,247 --> 02:04:24,248
I see.

2206
02:04:24,582 --> 02:04:26,801
And what would you like them to do?

2207
02:04:28,628 --> 02:04:29,629
"They" meaning?

2208
02:04:30,463 --> 02:04:32,932
The Jew oppressors. What would
you like them to do?

2209
02:04:33,508 --> 02:04:35,181
I didn't use that expression.

2210
02:04:35,426 --> 02:04:37,269
No, you didn't.
- But since you ask...

2211
02:04:37,345 --> 02:04:39,268
I spent the whole day arguing about this.

2212
02:04:39,389 --> 02:04:41,312
I didn't really mean to bring it up again.

2213
02:04:41,391 --> 02:04:42,563
Don't handle me.

2214
02:04:42,725 --> 02:04:43,897
I'm not handling you.

2215
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:46,028
What did you think of the
play? Don't bother, Mom.

2216
02:04:46,104 --> 02:04:49,734
And I think it's ironic in the extreme
that the victims of Nazis

2217
02:04:49,816 --> 02:04:51,784
find it essential... If Israelis
were like Nazis

2218
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:53,657
there wouldn't be any Arabs left.
...to use Nazi tactics...

2219
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:55,158
That's what I've been saying!
- And I'm leaving.

2220
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:57,240
That seems excessive, Emily, come on.

2221
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:00,368
That's the response. That's
the Jewish response.

2222
02:05:01,828 --> 02:05:02,829
It's the what?

2223
02:05:02,954 --> 02:05:03,955
It's the Jewish response.

2224
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:06,757
You don't like what I am saying
or what I do, so you...

2225
02:05:06,833 --> 02:05:07,834
Oh, my God!

2226
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:09,006
That's my Jewish response.

2227
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:11,759
That's all right. It's all right.

2228
02:05:13,339 --> 02:05:14,591
It's all right. That's all right.

2229
02:05:16,217 --> 02:05:18,515
It's a perfect little encapsule.

2230
02:05:20,179 --> 02:05:21,977
It's the Jewish response.

2231
02:05:28,896 --> 02:05:31,274
Joan, I won't defend myself.

2232
02:05:31,399 --> 02:05:32,867
All what I meant was

2233
02:05:32,942 --> 02:05:35,786
that was the typical response
you will get from someone

2234
02:05:35,903 --> 02:05:38,577
who will take that position
that woman was taking.

2235
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:43,920
If I would have said the word "Israeli"
instead of the word "Jewish

2236
02:05:44,162 --> 02:05:45,880
I don't think there would be a problem.

2237
02:05:46,372 --> 02:05:48,795
But if you want to break up with me

2238
02:05:48,958 --> 02:05:51,427
because I used the wrong adjective...

2239
02:05:51,961 --> 02:05:53,258
What I'm going to do?

2240
02:05:53,337 --> 02:05:54,930
I'm not going to beg you.

2241
02:06:11,689 --> 02:06:13,032
Hello?

2242
02:06:13,107 --> 02:06:14,780
Hi, Dad, how are you?

2243
02:06:18,488 --> 02:06:21,162
Really? What's the matter?

2244
02:06:26,996 --> 02:06:28,293
I never said I didn't want to go.

2245
02:06:28,581 --> 02:06:30,049
I can't get a straight answer from

2246
02:06:30,166 --> 02:06:31,668
anybody about what they want to eat...

2247
02:06:32,168 --> 02:06:33,841
Annette says she's called you four times

2248
02:06:34,003 --> 02:06:35,676
and you haven't called her back.

2249
02:06:35,797 --> 02:06:37,344
The ranch seems to be putting some

2250
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:39,100
kind of intolerable pressure on her

2251
02:06:39,175 --> 02:06:42,019
to choose five lunches for
a five-day trip that

2252
02:06:42,095 --> 02:06:43,722
we're not taking for a month and a half.

2253
02:06:43,805 --> 02:06:45,557
I talk to Curtis about it and all I get

2254
02:06:45,681 --> 02:06:47,479
is monosyllables. So what is the point?

2255
02:06:47,725 --> 02:06:50,069
I think he's really looking forward to it.

2256
02:06:50,144 --> 02:06:51,896
Well, that hasn't been my impression.

2257
02:06:52,105 --> 02:06:54,278
I also think, Lisa, it
would be a good idea

2258
02:06:54,357 --> 02:06:57,327
if we just tabled the notion of
you coming out here next year.

2259
02:06:57,902 --> 02:06:59,404
Things look like they're gonna start

2260
02:06:59,529 --> 02:07:01,031
picking up for me a little bit in the fall

2261
02:07:01,114 --> 02:07:02,115
and that means I'm not gonna be

2262
02:07:02,198 --> 02:07:03,165
around the house all that much,

2263
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:04,618
and since you and Annette
detest each other,

2264
02:07:04,700 --> 02:07:06,043
I honestly don't think that's what

2265
02:07:06,202 --> 02:07:07,545
I want to come home to
after a 14-hour day.

2266
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:08,667
We don't detest each other.

2267
02:07:08,746 --> 02:07:10,794
Well, I gotta tell you,
it doesn't strike me

2268
02:07:10,873 --> 02:07:12,875
as something you seem that serious about.

2269
02:07:13,251 --> 02:07:14,252
Okay.

2270
02:07:14,335 --> 02:07:18,681
So, just tell Curtis that New Mexico's
off and I'll talk to you whenever.

2271
02:07:18,756 --> 02:07:19,882
Okay. All right.

2272
02:07:20,716 --> 02:07:21,717
What's wrong?

2273
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:29,688
Mr. Deutsch? I'm right here.

2274
02:07:29,767 --> 02:07:33,522
I had the thought, if they're
willing to settle so quickly,

2275
02:07:33,604 --> 02:07:35,606
maybe we're better off
waiting a little bit,

2276
02:07:35,731 --> 02:07:37,779
you know, rattlin' the
saber a little more?

2277
02:07:37,859 --> 02:07:38,826
Maybe we're cuttin' our own throats here.

2278
02:07:38,901 --> 02:07:40,027
They are responding to the
story in the paper.

2279
02:07:40,111 --> 02:07:41,533
That's just common sense.

2280
02:07:41,988 --> 02:07:45,242
But what you gotta understand is
they're offering to settle now

2281
02:07:45,324 --> 02:07:47,622
because they want to get the
story out of the paper.

2282
02:07:47,743 --> 02:07:48,835
That's why Russel thinks...

2283
02:07:48,911 --> 02:07:50,538
Besides, the point is not
to jack up the price.

2284
02:07:50,621 --> 02:07:51,622
I'm sorry?

2285
02:07:51,831 --> 02:07:52,957
We didn't hear that last bit.

2286
02:07:53,082 --> 02:07:54,254
Ladies, let me just...

2287
02:07:54,584 --> 02:07:58,009
Rob. Abigail. Let me just
finish my thought.

2288
02:07:58,671 --> 02:08:01,220
They are jumping at the bait right now.

2289
02:08:01,465 --> 02:08:03,388
But if another six months goes by, we run

2290
02:08:03,509 --> 02:08:05,432
a serious risk of losing our momentum.

2291
02:08:05,595 --> 02:08:06,596
You see what I mean?

2292
02:08:06,721 --> 02:08:10,726
Now I'm gonna hit them very,
very hard, I guarantee it.

2293
02:08:10,975 --> 02:08:13,353
That's why I wanted all of
us together on the phone,

2294
02:08:13,436 --> 02:08:15,939
so we could talk about your other
terms, besides the damages.

2295
02:08:16,272 --> 02:08:18,741
I promise you, lam gonna be
very, very aggressive.

2296
02:08:18,816 --> 02:08:20,284
What other terms would there be?

2297
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:22,737
What do you mean, like
some kind of a fund?

2298
02:08:23,487 --> 02:08:25,034
A what?

2299
02:08:25,156 --> 02:08:26,749
Some kind of fund for the kids?

2300
02:08:27,408 --> 02:08:28,625
I don't understand what
you mean by a fund.

2301
02:08:28,743 --> 02:08:29,790
What does he mean, "Besides the damages?"

2302
02:08:29,869 --> 02:08:31,542
Mr. Deutsch, do you mean
some kind of trust fund?

2303
02:08:31,621 --> 02:08:34,124
A fund that would be set up by
the bus company for our kids?

2304
02:08:34,207 --> 02:08:35,424
For tax purposes?

2305
02:08:35,541 --> 02:08:36,884
What fucking fund?

2306
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:38,344
These people are retarded.

2307
02:08:38,419 --> 02:08:39,386
Because I have to tell you,

2308
02:08:39,462 --> 02:08:42,056
we have just lived through that nightmare
with Monica and our children,

2309
02:08:42,131 --> 02:08:44,259
and it was not a pleasant experience.

2310
02:08:44,342 --> 02:08:48,222
We just want a clean, straight...
Damages is fine.

2311
02:08:48,971 --> 02:08:50,848
Lisa, I'm really proud of you! Thank you.

2312
02:08:50,932 --> 02:08:52,479
Really, really proud! Thank you.

2313
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:54,352
So, what happens now?

2314
02:08:54,435 --> 02:08:56,312
They have to figure out the terms.

2315
02:08:57,647 --> 02:08:59,991
Hello? Yes?

2316
02:09:01,150 --> 02:09:02,743
What do you mean! What's the matter?

2317
02:09:03,527 --> 02:09:04,619
Yes?

2318
02:09:05,905 --> 02:09:06,906
Yes.

2319
02:09:07,114 --> 02:09:08,161
What? Ramon's had a heart attack.

2320
02:09:08,324 --> 02:09:09,826
What? Is he gonna be okay? Quiet!

2321
02:09:11,661 --> 02:09:12,708
Yes?

2322
02:09:13,829 --> 02:09:14,830
Okay.

2323
02:09:16,499 --> 02:09:18,001
Okay, let me write that down.

2324
02:09:32,515 --> 02:09:34,188
Okay, I'm really not trying to be funny,

2325
02:09:34,267 --> 02:09:36,861
but isn't this a Jewish funeral home?

2326
02:09:38,271 --> 02:09:40,023
I guess they do both.

2327
02:09:57,957 --> 02:09:59,083
Excuse me.

2328
02:09:59,542 --> 02:10:00,634
Joan? Yes.

2329
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:04,964
Oh, you must be Rodrigo. Oh,
my God, I'm so sorry.

2330
02:10:07,383 --> 02:10:08,976
Rodrigo, this...

2331
02:10:09,093 --> 02:10:10,720
I want to tell you, Joan,

2332
02:10:11,012 --> 02:10:13,140
my Dad talked about you all the time.

2333
02:10:13,681 --> 02:10:14,648
He did?

2334
02:10:14,724 --> 02:10:15,725
Yes.

2335
02:10:16,726 --> 02:10:18,444
Thank you for telling me that.

2336
02:10:20,021 --> 02:10:21,568
And, I don't know if this
is appropriate...

2337
02:10:21,731 --> 02:10:23,278
No, it's okay.

2338
02:10:23,733 --> 02:10:24,734
But...

2339
02:10:25,568 --> 02:10:27,241
He went out a lot.

2340
02:10:31,532 --> 02:10:34,411
Do you know, the last time I spoke to him,

2341
02:10:35,453 --> 02:10:38,377
he told me, from the moment he met you,

2342
02:10:39,707 --> 02:10:41,084
he knew he wanted to marry you.

2343
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:46,089
Because, for the first time
since he lost my mother,

2344
02:10:46,881 --> 02:10:49,805
he finally met a woman he could
really connect with.

2345
02:10:55,431 --> 02:10:56,478
Well,

2346
02:10:57,475 --> 02:10:58,476
he was...

2347
02:10:58,601 --> 02:10:59,648
Excuse me.

2348
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:18,538
Thanks for coming with me today.
I really appreciate it.

2349
02:11:18,621 --> 02:11:20,123
Oh, you're welcome.

2350
02:11:21,791 --> 02:11:23,464
I don't want to be macabre, but...

2351
02:11:23,793 --> 02:11:25,511
Ramon and I were supposed to go to hear

2352
02:11:25,628 --> 02:11:27,380
The Tales of Hoffman the week after next

2353
02:11:27,463 --> 02:11:28,931
and I still have the tickets.

2354
02:11:29,965 --> 02:11:32,764
Would you be interested in going?
Or should I give them away?

2355
02:11:33,386 --> 02:11:36,185
It's Monday night. We can dress up.

2356
02:11:37,056 --> 02:11:38,148
I'll go.

2357
02:11:42,603 --> 02:11:43,820
What did you make of that?

2358
02:11:46,273 --> 02:11:47,900
People don't relate to each other, Mom.

2359
02:11:49,110 --> 02:11:52,455
They're totally disconnected.
That's what I make of it.

2360
02:11:54,281 --> 02:11:55,282
Well...

2361
02:11:56,951 --> 02:11:58,874
I think that's kind of unfortunate
that you think that,

2362
02:11:58,953 --> 02:12:00,205
because I feel like you and I used to

2363
02:12:00,287 --> 02:12:02,005
relate to each other really well.

2364
02:12:02,832 --> 02:12:04,630
I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.

2365
02:12:05,167 --> 02:12:06,760
It's just a general observation.

2366
02:12:13,467 --> 02:12:14,468
Okay.

2367
02:12:16,887 --> 02:12:19,561
Hey, can I get a hug?

2368
02:12:20,516 --> 02:12:21,517
Sure.

2369
02:12:25,271 --> 02:12:27,365
I just feel totally at sea.

2370
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:20,872
Hi, Emily. Hi, Lisa.

2371
02:13:20,951 --> 02:13:22,544
- Hello.
- Hi.

2372
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:23,792
Hello.

2373
02:13:24,538 --> 02:13:27,633
I am very pleased to be
able to inform you all

2374
02:13:27,917 --> 02:13:31,137
that I had a long meeting with the
lawyer from the bus company

2375
02:13:31,253 --> 02:13:34,757
and they have agreed to
settle for $350,000.

2376
02:13:35,090 --> 02:13:37,092
- What? Fantastic!
- That is just great!

2377
02:13:37,218 --> 02:13:39,186
I assume this is agreeable with everybody.

2378
02:13:39,261 --> 02:13:40,433
- Yes!
- It's just fantastic!

2379
02:13:40,513 --> 02:13:44,518
But, of course, I gotta bring the offer
to you, and get your approval.

2380
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:45,817
Mr. Deutsch? Now,

2381
02:13:45,893 --> 02:13:48,772
I know there was a concern
after our last call

2382
02:13:48,854 --> 02:13:50,231
that we were jumping the gun a little bit.

2383
02:13:50,314 --> 02:13:51,315
- That's okay.
- We're only...

2384
02:13:51,398 --> 02:13:52,775
Abigail. Rob.

2385
02:13:53,025 --> 02:13:55,198
Could we just listen to
what Russel has to say

2386
02:13:55,277 --> 02:13:58,531
and then talk about it once he's
told us the whole story

2387
02:13:58,614 --> 02:14:00,161
and given us his recommendation?

2388
02:14:00,366 --> 02:14:02,789
Yeah. Yes. Sorry. Fire away.

2389
02:14:03,869 --> 02:14:04,995
I was gonna say,

2390
02:14:05,079 --> 02:14:07,173
I know there was a concern
after our last call

2391
02:14:07,248 --> 02:14:09,376
that we were jumping the gun a little bit.

2392
02:14:09,458 --> 02:14:10,505
Well, that's okay.

2393
02:14:10,501 --> 02:14:12,469
Would you let him talk, please! It's okay.

2394
02:14:12,545 --> 02:14:13,797
- We're sorry.
- Sorry.

2395
02:14:14,255 --> 02:14:18,055
I want to tell you that I think
it's a very good offer.

2396
02:14:18,425 --> 02:14:19,893
I think they're very anxious to settle.

2397
02:14:20,302 --> 02:14:22,646
But I also do think that at this moment,

2398
02:14:22,721 --> 02:14:24,473
they are under the maximum amount of

2399
02:14:24,598 --> 02:14:26,350
pressure that we can really bring to bear,

2400
02:14:26,475 --> 02:14:28,318
and I don't believe they're
gonna come up any higher.

2401
02:14:28,936 --> 02:14:31,815
Hey, $350,000, that's
nothing to sneeze at.

2402
02:14:31,897 --> 02:14:33,695
Let me just... I just want to
introduce the thought...

2403
02:14:33,774 --> 02:14:35,651
- Can you all hear me?
- Yes!

2404
02:14:35,734 --> 02:14:37,702
Was that everybody? Okay.

2405
02:14:37,778 --> 02:14:39,325
Emily? What do you think?

2406
02:14:39,488 --> 02:14:41,456
I think it sounds like we should do it.

2407
02:14:41,574 --> 02:14:43,201
But I'd like to be... Okay.
If that's the vote.

2408
02:14:43,284 --> 02:14:44,877
Unless you think there's something

2409
02:14:44,994 --> 02:14:46,621
to be gained from holding out for more.

2410
02:14:46,704 --> 02:14:47,956
I think that would be a big mistake.

2411
02:14:48,497 --> 02:14:49,749
Robbie, what do you think?

2412
02:14:53,252 --> 02:14:54,344
Sold!
- Sold!

2413
02:14:54,461 --> 02:14:55,462
Okay.

2414
02:14:56,130 --> 02:14:59,054
Now, the only downside
to this as it stands,

2415
02:15:00,259 --> 02:15:02,762
and I know this may be a serious
wrinkle for all of you,

2416
02:15:03,345 --> 02:15:05,643
is that the bus company will absolutely

2417
02:15:05,764 --> 02:15:08,108
not discuss the removal of the driver.

2418
02:15:08,309 --> 02:15:09,561
What? What do you mean?

2419
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:11,403
The driver? Then tell them to forget it.

2420
02:15:11,478 --> 02:15:13,446
What do you mean? They won't discuss
the removal of the driver?

2421
02:15:13,522 --> 02:15:14,990
Ladies. Let me finish what I was saying.

2422
02:15:15,107 --> 02:15:16,529
It's just a blast in our ears.

2423
02:15:16,609 --> 02:15:17,701
Let him finish.

2424
02:15:17,818 --> 02:15:18,910
Finish what? Forget it!

2425
02:15:19,278 --> 02:15:21,576
Thank you. Lisa, I want you to understand,

2426
02:15:21,697 --> 02:15:24,041
I pressed them very, very hard on this,

2427
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:27,290
but they will not discuss disciplining
a company employee

2428
02:15:27,369 --> 02:15:28,495
as part of the settlement

2429
02:15:28,579 --> 02:15:30,673
because it could be seen as an admission

2430
02:15:30,748 --> 02:15:31,965
of guilt on the part of the MTA.

2431
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:33,884
What does giving us $300,000 mean?

2432
02:15:34,043 --> 02:15:36,296
Settling out of court does not
imply an admission of guilt.

2433
02:15:36,378 --> 02:15:38,221
It simply does not carry the same stigma.

2434
02:15:38,464 --> 02:15:40,808
On top of that, you may not know, Lisa,

2435
02:15:40,883 --> 02:15:42,135
that they're currently involved

2436
02:15:42,259 --> 02:15:43,852
in a very tricky labor dispute right now.

2437
02:15:43,927 --> 02:15:46,476
Yeah, we know about that! Just
tell them to forget it.

2438
02:15:46,764 --> 02:15:47,765
I know that's your reaction...

2439
02:15:47,890 --> 02:15:48,937
It's the only reason we're here.

2440
02:15:49,058 --> 02:15:50,480
Can I jump in here? Russel?

2441
02:15:50,601 --> 02:15:52,069
It's really not your decision.

2442
02:15:52,186 --> 02:15:53,403
It's Emily's decision. Hello?

2443
02:15:53,479 --> 02:15:54,480
Are you still with us? Hello? No.

2444
02:15:54,563 --> 02:15:55,860
They're not listening, Robbie. It's not?

2445
02:15:55,939 --> 02:15:56,940
No!

2446
02:15:57,066 --> 02:15:58,113
It's Abigail's decision,

2447
02:15:58,609 --> 02:16:00,202
because she's the next of kin.

2448
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:01,912
But she didn't even know about it!

2449
02:16:01,987 --> 02:16:02,988
That doesn't matter.

2450
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:05,040
Could we get back in this
conversation, please?

2451
02:16:05,115 --> 02:16:06,207
Yes. I'm sorry.

2452
02:16:06,784 --> 02:16:09,537
Obviously there's some strong emotions
going either way here.

2453
02:16:09,787 --> 02:16:11,835
Listen, Emily? I don't know
what you're thinking,

2454
02:16:11,914 --> 02:16:13,541
but Rob and I are thinking we should take

2455
02:16:13,666 --> 02:16:15,293
Russel's recommendation while we can.

2456
02:16:15,376 --> 02:16:17,970
Because if they won't fire the guy,
they're not gonna fire him.

2457
02:16:18,045 --> 02:16:19,012
And six months or a year from now...

2458
02:16:19,088 --> 02:16:20,089
Exactly.

2459
02:16:20,172 --> 02:16:21,344
We're gonna be in a situation

2460
02:16:21,423 --> 02:16:22,845
where we're begging them
for half this much...

2461
02:16:22,925 --> 02:16:24,677
The entire point of the lawsuit

2462
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:27,309
was to get the guy fired so he
doesn't kill somebody else.

2463
02:16:27,388 --> 02:16:29,857
It was not to get you $350,000

2464
02:16:29,932 --> 02:16:31,354
you didn't know you were entitled to

2465
02:16:31,475 --> 02:16:32,943
for somebody you didn't even like!

2466
02:16:33,018 --> 02:16:34,816
And the only reason you're
getting the money at all

2467
02:16:34,895 --> 02:16:37,444
is because I started this whole
fucking thing in motion!

2468
02:16:37,523 --> 02:16:38,775
I'm sorry for swearing,

2469
02:16:38,941 --> 02:16:40,818
but you should be willing
to trade in all the money

2470
02:16:40,943 --> 02:16:42,035
for getting this guy off the street!

2471
02:16:42,152 --> 02:16:43,244
For getting him, Abigail!

2472
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:45,414
Well, I'm sorry, but I
have a responsibility

2473
02:16:45,489 --> 02:16:48,914
to Monica and I take that responsibility
very seriously.

2474
02:16:48,992 --> 02:16:50,960
And rather than being cursed
at over the telephone

2475
02:16:51,036 --> 02:16:53,915
for having the courtesy to involve
you in these discussions, Lisa,

2476
02:16:53,997 --> 02:16:55,965
I would hope you would be
guided by our judgment.

2477
02:16:56,041 --> 02:16:57,042
Unless I'm wrong about that.

2478
02:16:57,126 --> 02:16:58,093
None of that matters.

2479
02:16:58,168 --> 02:17:00,967
Unless I'm wrong about that, just
what is your interest in this?

2480
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:03,132
Because I'm the one who killed her!

2481
02:17:03,215 --> 02:17:06,765
I'm the one who killed her, but
at least I know I did it.

2482
02:17:06,844 --> 02:17:08,517
And that guy has no idea!

2483
02:17:08,595 --> 02:17:11,394
He is wandering around blaming
everybody else.

2484
02:17:11,473 --> 02:17:15,728
All I want is for somebody to let him
know that what he did was wrong.

2485
02:17:15,811 --> 02:17:19,236
And if they don't fire him, and
all you want is the money,

2486
02:17:19,314 --> 02:17:21,282
and the police won't do anything,

2487
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:23,323
then how is he gonna know he's wrong?

2488
02:17:23,444 --> 02:17:25,492
You can't take the deal, Abigail!

2489
02:17:25,612 --> 02:17:27,330
It wasn't to get you any money,

2490
02:17:27,489 --> 02:17:29,241
it was because we wanted to get him fired!

2491
02:17:29,324 --> 02:17:30,450
Well, it may not matter to you,

2492
02:17:30,534 --> 02:17:34,584
but where I come from, $350,000
is an awful lot of money

2493
02:17:34,663 --> 02:17:36,665
and to my mind is a positive result

2494
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:38,758
of all this tragedy and not just negative.

2495
02:17:38,834 --> 02:17:40,711
Not just getting someone
fired for one mistake,

2496
02:17:40,794 --> 02:17:41,841
no matter how bad it was.

2497
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:43,388
Shove it up your ass!

2498
02:17:43,464 --> 02:17:44,431
Lisa!

2499
02:17:44,506 --> 02:17:47,180
You sleazy fucking lawyer! And
you're a moralistic cunt!

2500
02:18:05,694 --> 02:18:08,322
At this point, I literally have
a zero-tolerance Roger policy.

2501
02:18:08,906 --> 02:18:11,534
Good for you. Glad to hear
I'm not the only one.

2502
02:18:12,409 --> 02:18:13,501
Hey!

2503
02:18:14,119 --> 02:18:16,042
Hey, Lisa. What's up?

2504
02:18:16,121 --> 02:18:18,749
Hey, did you guys know I had
an abortion last week?

2505
02:18:22,544 --> 02:18:24,137
No. I didn't know that.

2506
02:18:24,213 --> 02:18:26,136
Yeah, it cost $400.

2507
02:18:27,674 --> 02:18:29,392
Um... Should I...

2508
02:18:29,468 --> 02:18:30,515
No, no, don't go anywhere.

2509
02:18:30,636 --> 02:18:32,058
Yeah, don't go anywhere.

2510
02:18:36,642 --> 02:18:38,736
Do you want to tell us about it?

2511
02:18:39,186 --> 02:18:40,563
Yeah, I do.

2512
02:18:43,065 --> 02:18:44,408
Okay.

2513
02:18:45,692 --> 02:18:46,739
Go ahead.

2514
02:18:48,403 --> 02:18:49,404
Well...

2515
02:18:52,533 --> 02:18:55,082
Do your parents know about this, Lisa?

2516
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:56,161
Yes.

2517
02:18:56,787 --> 02:18:59,085
And have you told the father, honey?

2518
02:18:59,331 --> 02:19:01,709
No. There's a couple of
people it could be.

2519
02:19:02,376 --> 02:19:05,095
Well, I think you better tell
them, whoever they are.

2520
02:19:05,796 --> 02:19:06,797
No.

2521
02:19:08,048 --> 02:19:09,721
No. Never mind, I mean, I'm sure

2522
02:19:09,842 --> 02:19:11,515
he's sorry, anyway, whichever one he is.

2523
02:19:11,677 --> 02:19:15,272
I don't see how that makes any difference,
at all, if he's sorry.

2524
02:19:16,515 --> 02:19:17,732
That doesn't matter.

2525
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:22,154
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have brought this up.

2526
02:19:22,771 --> 02:19:23,772
Please don't tell anyone.

2527
02:19:23,856 --> 02:19:25,483
We're not gonna tell anyone.

2528
02:19:25,566 --> 02:19:28,240
But you're gonna have to tell
whoever it could be.

2529
02:19:28,318 --> 02:19:29,695
It's okay, I...

2530
02:19:30,445 --> 02:19:32,243
I gotta go-

2531
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:34,537
It doesn't matter about the father

2532
02:19:34,616 --> 02:19:36,710
because the whole thing was my fault.

2533
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:39,292
I'm sorry.

2534
02:19:43,625 --> 02:19:45,218
What was that?

2535
02:19:49,423 --> 02:19:50,470
Mom's looking for you.

2536
02:19:50,632 --> 02:19:51,724
What for?

2537
02:19:52,092 --> 02:19:53,435
She thinks you're going
out with her tonight.

2538
02:19:53,510 --> 02:19:54,636
Where are we going?

2539
02:19:54,887 --> 02:19:55,979
I don't know.

2540
02:20:02,978 --> 02:20:04,821
Don't get run over.

2541
02:20:06,356 --> 02:20:07,733
Wait. What?

2542
02:20:10,777 --> 02:20:12,529
I want to see if that's him.

2543
02:20:24,458 --> 02:20:26,426
It's him, Mom. That's the one.

2544
02:20:52,736 --> 02:20:53,737
Hey.

2545
02:20:57,324 --> 02:21:00,043
Well, so far it's not the greatest
opera I ever heard.

2546
02:21:00,327 --> 02:21:01,874
What do you mean? It's okay.

2547
02:29:47,437 --> 02:29:48,438
