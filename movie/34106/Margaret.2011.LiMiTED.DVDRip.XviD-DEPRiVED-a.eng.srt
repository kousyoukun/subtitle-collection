make her throw up,

the summation of her life,

When her Lisa died...

919
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,898
When her Lisa died, I said to her,
"How can you stand it?"

920
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,871
And she said, "First of all, I can't.

-Gerry, why don't we all go inside?
-Could I please talk to you alone?

1064
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,337
Okay, what is going on here?

1065
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,002
Nothing's going on here.
So why don't you calm down?

1066
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:59,006
Look, go ahead inside.
Let me find out what this is.

1067
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:00,542
In the meantime, why don't you make sure

1068
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,106
those kids aren't killing each other,
all right?

1069
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:04,341
All right.

1070
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,521
No, you know what? Let 'em kill each other.
Give us all a rest.

1071
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:15,426
All right, Lisa. What?

1072
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:19,456
I just...

1073
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:23,970
-Well... I just want you to know...
-Yes? What? Speak.

1074
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,542
Well, you probably already know,
obviously, that

1075
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:33,111
I told the police, on the police report, that l
thought the whole thing was an accident.

1076
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:35,277
Uh-huh. Right. Because it was an accident.

1077
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,117
Well, I mean...

1078
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,620
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

1079
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:42,122
-"On purpose"?
-But it wasn't like...

1080
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:47,125
What? What? Speak. What?

1081
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:50,191
Well, I mean...

1082
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,866
We were looking at each other.

1083
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:56,700
Who was looking at each other?
You and me?

1084
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:58,936
Well, yeah.

1085
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:03,168
I mean, not like romantically or anything.

1086
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:06,576
-Romantically?
-Scratch that. That's not even relevant.

1087
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,014
You're not coming through
very clearly here.

1088
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:11,109
If you could just let me...

1089
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:14,846
From my point of view,
the way I remember the accident is

1090
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:20,361
you were wearing this cowboy hat,
and I was out that day to buy a cowboy hat,

1091
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,329
so I was waving at you,
because you were wearing one,

1092
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,333
and you were kind of waving back.

1093
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:26,523
And...

1094
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:30,834
I know I was distracting you,

1095
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:34,805
but I did see the bus
go through the red light,

1096
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,706
and that's when it hit that woman.

1097
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:40,140
(SlGHS)

1098
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,204
Okay.

1099
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,808
-I'm getting a little confused here.
-Only nobody said that to them,

1100
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,787
and I wanted to acknowledge with you
that that's what happened.

1101
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,346
I don't know what you really mean
by "waving at you."

1102
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,417
-Were you trying to catch the bus?
-No. Yes. But I wanted to

1103
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,553
-ask you about your cowboy hat.
-Maybe I was waving at you,

1104
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,360
Iike waving at you to say,
"Step away from the bus."

1105
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:58,932
Because if the bus was in motion,

1106
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,731
I would be waving you away for your own
safety, but that's all that would be.

1107
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,134
You don't remember looking at me
and waving at me?

1108
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,070
Not really. No.

1109
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,508
Well, I think we both remember
something different.

1110
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:14,538
-Your brother's on the phone.
-Tell him I'll call him back.

1111
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,244
(DOOR CLOSES)

1112
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:20,879
I'm not trying to get you in trouble.

1113
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,982
I know you're not, because you can't,
because I didn't do anything wrong.

1114
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:26,194
There was no criminality found.

1115
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:28,159
That's it. The report is final.

1116
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,288
So you're just gonna leave it?

1117
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:30,956
I'm gonna leave it because that's all it was.

1118
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,026
If something else had happened,
I'd take that to whatever that was.

1119
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,798
It was tragic. It's a tragedy.

1120
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:39,602
But there's only a certain speed
that those brakes can react.

1121
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,506
That's the physical limitation
of the machine.
