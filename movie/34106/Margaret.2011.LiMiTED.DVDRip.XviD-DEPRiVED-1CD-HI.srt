to categorize every president
as universally corrupt,

No, because they killed 3,000 people

I'm not!

Why are you defending a country that
unilaterally invaded two Muslim countries

of Palestine?

and then calls other people terrorists
for doing the exact same thing?

435

00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:46,109
Yeah, I just want to ask
why is it okay to drop bombs on men

438
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,578
but it's not okay to drop bombs
on women and children?

00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,945
I mean, isn't that just like reverse sexism?

I don't know. I agree it's a bullshit term.

I think the whole class should
apologize to Angie, actually,

443

'cause all she did was express her opinion
about what her relatives in Syria think.

444

- And everyone started screaming at her

445

They throw acid in women's faces.

- Why not drop bombs on the Ku Klux Klan!

448
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,564

Okay, I'm not even saying
I disagree with you.

452

I'm just saying it's pathetic
the way people in this class treated Angie

just for saying something
they didn't happen to agree with.

454
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,384
Because that's censorship. Right?

455
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,683
- Right?
- It's not censorship!

456
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,453
- Right on!
- This class is not the government.

457
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,694
- It's censorship.
- Oh, my God, no, it's not!

- But for a situation...

461
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,602
Hey, how are you doin'?
But for somethin' like this,

462
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,871
we usually find a local precinct
or an apartment.

17 years old who,

for some peculiar reason,
are interested in using their brains

of them when you come out next time...

It depends on the person, obviously.

matter if I express it exactly accurately,

something going with, but...

Give us all a rest.

01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:15,426
All right, Lisa. What?

1072
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:19,456
I just...

1073
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:23,970
- Well... I just want you to know...
- Yes? What? Speak.

1074
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,542
Well, you probably already know,
obviously, that

1075
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:33,111
I told the police, on the police report, that I
thought the whole thing was an accident.

1076
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:35,277
Uh-huh. Right. Because it was an accident.

1077
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,117
Well, I mean...

1078
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,620
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

1079
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:42,122
- "On purpose"?
- But it wasn't like...

1080
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:47,125
What? What? Speak. What?

1081
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:50,191
Well, I mean...

1082
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,866
We were looking at each other.

1083
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:56,700
Who was looking at each other?
You and me?

1084
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:58,936
Well, yeah.

1085
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:03,168
I mean, not like romantically or anything.

1086
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:06,576
- Romantically?
- Scratch that. That's not even relevant.

very clearly here.

If you could just let me...

1089
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:14,846
From my point of view,
the way I remember the accident is

1090
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:20,361
you were wearing this cowboy hat,
and I was out that day to buy a cowboy hat,

1091
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,329
so I was waving at you,
because you were wearing one,

1092
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,333
and you were kind of waving back.

1093
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:26,523
And...

1094
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:30,834
I know I was distracting you,

1095
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:34,805
but I did see the bus
go through the red light,

1096
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,706
and that's when it hit that woman.

1097

(SIGHS)

1098
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,204
Okay.

1099
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,808
- I'm getting a little confused here.
- Only nobody said that to them,

1100
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,787
and I wanted to acknowledge with you
that that's what happened.

1101
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,346
I don't know what you really mean
by "waving at you."

1102
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,417
- Were you trying to catch the bus?
- No. Yes. But I wanted to

1103
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,553
- ask you about your cowboy hat.
- Maybe I was waving at you,

1104
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,360
like waving at you to say,
"Step away from the bus."

1105
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:58,932
Because if the bus was in motion,

1106
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,731
I would be waving you away for your own
safety, but that's all that would be.

1107
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,134
You don't remember looking at me
and waving at me?

1108
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,070
Not really. No.

1109
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,508
Well, I think we both remember
something different.

1110
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:14,538
- Your brother's on the phone.
- Tell him I'll call him back.

1113
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,982
I know you're not, because you can't,
because I didn't do anything wrong.

1114
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:26,194
There was no criminality found.

1115

That's it. The report is final.

1116
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,288
So you're just gonna leave it?

1117
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:30,956
I'm gonna leave it because that's all it was.

1118
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,026
If something else had happened,
I'd take that to whatever that was.

1119
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,798
It was tragic. It's a tragedy.

1120

But there's only a certain speed
that those brakes can react.

1121

That's the physical limitation
of the machine.

1122
01:14:43,335 --> 01:14:47,066
I don't know what else to tell you.
It's shocking. It was a shock.

1123

But you can't bring her back.
You cannot bring her back.

I'm not talking about bringing her back.

1125
01:14:52,377 --> 01:14:55,278
I'm talking about telling the accident
investigators what really happened.

1126
01:14:55,347 --> 01:14:56,541
You already talked to them!

1127
01:14:56,615 --> 01:14:58,913
- I know that. But I lied.
- You lied.

1128

I can understand if you don't want to
get in trouble, but...

1129
01:15:01,353 --> 01:15:03,014
Why didn't you say that right then?

1130
01:15:03,155 --> 01:15:04,417
Because when they were asking me
what happened

1131
01:15:04,489 --> 01:15:07,754
it seemed like you were looking at me
like we were saying to each other,

1132
01:15:07,826 --> 01:15:09,726
"Let's not say anything
about what happened."

1133

what you're talkin' about.

I can't prove you were doing that.

1135

What, did I say something to you?
(STAMMERS) Did I threaten you?

No! I am not blaming you for any of this!

1137
01:15:20,205 --> 01:15:22,901
All I'm saying is I didn't really tell the cops
what happened,

1138
01:15:22,975 --> 01:15:24,966
and I didn't want to go back
without having spoken to you first.

1139
01:15:25,043 --> 01:15:28,535
But you told 'em what you saw!
And so did I!

waved at me and I had my cowboy hat on.

fucking face because this was not my fault!

"Sorrow's springs are the same.

1219

"Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed

1220

1221

"It is the blight man was born for,

01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:50,931
"It is Margaret you mourn for."

1223
01:19:54,613 --> 01:19:55,671
Any thoughts?

1224
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:59,208
Lisa?

1225
01:20:21,506 --> 01:20:22,871
Could I help you?

1226
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:26,039
Yeah, is Detective Mitchell here?

1227
01:20:26,244 --> 01:20:27,711
- No, he's not.
- Oh.

1228
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,911
I talked to him on Monday
and he said he'd be here after 3:00.

1229
01:20:31,983 --> 01:20:32,972
Yeah, he's not back yet.

1230
01:20:33,852 --> 01:20:35,285
Could I help you with something?

1231
01:20:35,854 --> 01:20:37,219
Um...

1232
01:20:37,289 --> 01:20:40,781
Well, do you know when you expect him?

1233
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,284
What's this about?

1234
01:20:43,395 --> 01:20:45,625
I was involved in
an accident a few weeks ago,

1235
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:47,755
and I filled out a report
with Detective Mitchell,

1236
01:20:47,832 --> 01:20:49,459
but I wanted to amend the report...

1237
01:20:49,534 --> 01:20:51,866
What do you mean?
How do you want to amend it?

1238
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:55,330
There was something I didn't tell him,
and I wanted to tell him because...

1239
01:20:55,407 --> 01:20:56,396
I don't understand.

1240
01:20:56,641 --> 01:20:58,404
- You wanna change your statement?
- Yes!

1241
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:00,641
Yes, I want to change my statement.

1242
01:21:01,246 --> 01:21:02,235
Yes.

1243
01:21:02,547 --> 01:21:06,313
Well, you'd usually have to talk to
the investigating detective on the case.

1244
01:21:06,618 --> 01:21:10,076
Yes, I know. That's why I asked
to see Detective Mitchell.

1245
01:21:10,155 --> 01:21:12,055
Who said he'd be here now,
but he's not, so...

1246
01:21:12,123 --> 01:21:14,284
- Do you remember the case number?
- No, sorry.

1247
01:21:14,526 --> 01:21:19,361
It was that woman, Monica Patterson,
who got run over by the bus on Broadway.

1248
01:21:19,431 --> 01:21:21,194
- It was in a lot of the newspapers...
- Sure, okay, sit down.

1249
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,791
- Thank you. I...
- You know the case is closed.

1250
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:28,228
I assumed it was.
But part of the reason it's closed is

1251
01:21:28,306 --> 01:21:29,739
because of my statement,
and the statement I...

1252
01:21:29,808 --> 01:21:32,208
- Because of your statement?
- Yes.

1253
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:34,378
What do you mean it was
closed because of your statement?

1254
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:37,312
- I mean, I was the...
- The DA's office closes the case.

1255
01:21:37,682 --> 01:21:41,174
You don't close the case.
The DA's office closes the case.

1256
01:21:41,253 --> 01:21:45,189
I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean
I personally closed it, like legally.

1257
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:47,551
I meant what I said was
probably instrumental in

1258
01:21:47,626 --> 01:21:49,184
- getting the case closed...
- What's your name, honey?

1259
01:21:50,695 --> 01:21:51,957
Lisa Cohen.

1260
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:54,289
- Okay.
- Don't call me "honey," okay?

1261
01:21:58,036 --> 01:21:59,025
Okay.

1262
01:22:00,905 --> 01:22:02,839
Are you not gonna help me
now that I've said that?

1263
01:22:03,008 --> 01:22:05,636
- Look, what's your name?
- Lisa Cohen!

1264
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:08,201
Okay, Lisa, first thing,
you're gonna calm down.

1265
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,248
- I'm calm right now.
- Okay. Just checking.

1266
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:15,185
Second thing... Oh.
Here he is, your knight in shining armor.

1267
01:22:15,553 --> 01:22:17,851
- This guy givin' you a hard time?
- No.

1268
01:22:20,525 --> 01:22:22,618
So now you're sayin' he ran the light.

1269
01:22:22,694 --> 01:22:26,186
Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road.

1270
01:22:26,831 --> 01:22:29,163
And I was definitely trying
to get his attention.

1271
01:22:29,234 --> 01:22:30,223
<i>MITCHELL: Okay.</i>

1272
01:22:30,302 --> 01:22:32,793
<i>Well, before we do anything, Lisa,</i>

1273
01:22:32,937 --> 01:22:35,906
anybody will tell you that just
because he ran a red light

1274
01:22:35,974 --> 01:22:37,839
- is not a criminal offense.
- Even if he kills someone?

1275
01:22:37,942 --> 01:22:41,434
Even if you cause an accidental death,
that's right.

1276
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,644
In order for it to be a criminal offense,

1277
01:22:44,716 --> 01:22:47,947
the law says you need
two aggravating circumstances.

1278
01:22:48,119 --> 01:22:51,611
Like he ran a red light and he was speeding.

1279
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:54,056
- Or he ran a red light and...
- So he's not liable to be prosecuted

1280
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:58,494
- for manslaughter or 2nd degree murder?
- No.

1281
01:22:59,264 --> 01:23:03,598
He could be charged with reckless driving,
or filling out a false police report,

1282
01:23:03,668 --> 01:23:05,932
- which... That's no joke...
- That's unbelievable!

1283
01:23:06,004 --> 01:23:07,767
What does he have to do?
Kill her on purpose?

1284
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:11,099
Yes. Because that's
the definition of murder.

1285
01:23:12,177 --> 01:23:14,304
Killin' someone on purpose.

1286
01:23:14,612 --> 01:23:18,104
Now, you're not sayin'
that he ran her over on purpose.

1287
01:23:19,317 --> 01:23:20,545
Are you?

1288
01:23:24,255 --> 01:23:25,745
Are you?

1289
01:23:31,363 --> 01:23:32,421
No.

1290
01:23:37,736 --> 01:23:38,725
Okay, look...

1291
01:23:40,805 --> 01:23:42,705
Let me take another statement.

1292
01:23:43,708 --> 01:23:46,438
- We'll look into it, okay?
- You're kidding.

1293
01:23:46,911 --> 01:23:51,439
No. I'll talk it over with my sergeant,
probably pull this guy in again.

1294
01:23:51,516 --> 01:23:53,347
Put a little pressure on him.

1295
01:23:53,418 --> 01:23:55,010
We'll see what he says.

1296
01:23:57,922 --> 01:23:58,946
Thank you!

1297
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:00,949
(LISA AND BECKY LAUGHING)

1298
01:24:01,025 --> 01:24:03,858
LISA: The Central Park Conservatory,
or whatever it's called,

1299
01:24:03,928 --> 01:24:07,591
put up about 500 miles of these cheap,
shitty-Iooking fences all over the park,

1300
01:24:07,665 --> 01:24:10,634
which is totally antithetical to what
the park was originally designed for.

1301
01:24:10,702 --> 01:24:12,761
BECKY: We are so gonna miss the game.

1302
01:24:13,505 --> 01:24:16,030
- Oh, my God, it's John!
- LISA: Hi, John.

1303
01:24:16,107 --> 01:24:17,369
BECKY: Hi, John.

1304
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:24,674
You want some? (LAUGHS)

1305
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:26,874
Come on, guys.

1306
01:24:27,285 --> 01:24:31,722
Come on, you can't be smokin' a J on
your way to a school soccer game!

1307
01:24:33,658 --> 01:24:35,421
- Now, come on!
- LISA: Sorry!

1308
01:24:35,493 --> 01:24:37,518
BECKY: We're really sorry.

1309
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:44,294
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

1310
01:24:44,369 --> 01:24:47,770
LISA: So, how about how he was like,
"smokin' a J"?

1311
01:24:48,506 --> 01:24:50,997
Like, "You can't be smokin' a J."

1312
01:24:51,075 --> 01:24:54,704
BECKY: Like, "Everybody, let's go over to
John's house and smoke a J."

1313
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:10,026
- Hi, Mr. Aaron!
- Lisa, how are you?

1314
01:25:10,094 --> 01:25:11,527
Pretty damn good. How are you?

1315
01:25:11,763 --> 01:25:16,063
I'm all right. Tell me something.
Whatever happened with that situation?

1316
01:25:16,134 --> 01:25:18,193
Oh, I'm working on it.
I'll tell you all about it sometime.

1317
01:25:19,938 --> 01:25:22,702
- Hey, what kind of a bike is that?
- It's a Trek.

1318
01:25:22,874 --> 01:25:26,366
I'm supposed to take a horseback riding
trip with my father over Christmas break

1319
01:25:26,444 --> 01:25:30,642
and I was wondering, does it
bear any resemblance to riding a bicycle?

1320
01:25:31,382 --> 01:25:34,374
As far as I know, no.

1321
01:25:34,552 --> 01:25:36,645
But you must have ridden a lot of horses.

1322
01:25:37,689 --> 01:25:38,815
What makes you say that?

1323
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:42,382
Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming
or some place like that?

1324
01:25:42,594 --> 01:25:46,086
- Some place like what?
- You know, not New York.

1325
01:25:46,631 --> 01:25:47,928
I'm actually from Indiana.

1326
01:25:47,999 --> 01:25:51,264
But don't let me overwhelm you
with superfluous details.

1327
01:25:51,336 --> 01:25:53,270
God, so what are you doing at
a New York private school

1328
01:25:53,338 --> 01:25:57,638
teaching geometry to a bunch
of over-privileged liberal Jews?

1329
01:25:58,142 --> 01:25:59,507
(CHUCKLES)

1330
01:25:59,577 --> 01:26:01,704
Well... Um...

1331
01:26:02,814 --> 01:26:06,306
I came here to be a teacher,
and that's what I'm doing.

1332
01:26:06,384 --> 01:26:09,876
So, would you say you've reached
the summit of your lifelong ambition?

1333
01:26:13,858 --> 01:26:17,350
Is that a real question
or is that a Lisa question?

1334
01:26:17,529 --> 01:26:18,894
About half and half.

1335
01:26:19,197 --> 01:26:21,461
- In that case...
- Before you go,

1336
01:26:21,533 --> 01:26:23,865
I'm actually thinking about
getting one of these. Can I try it?

1337
01:26:23,935 --> 01:26:25,459
Just for a second?

1338
01:26:26,971 --> 01:26:28,461
- All right.
- Thanks.

1339
01:26:29,607 --> 01:26:33,008
- Here, I'll adjust the seat for you.
- Thank you.

1340
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:41,213
- Watch my bag?
- Yeah.

1341
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:56,224
Oh, hi.

1342
01:26:57,368 --> 01:26:59,461
Where've you been?
I didn't know if you wanted dinner.

1343
01:26:59,537 --> 01:27:01,971
No, thanks. I'll order something.

1344
01:27:02,206 --> 01:27:03,798
Someone named Emily called.

1345
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:07,333
And Detective Mitchell called from
the Accident Investigation Squad.

1346
01:27:07,412 --> 01:27:08,777
Is that that one we met?

1347
01:27:11,382 --> 01:27:13,577
What's going on?
Did you ever go back and see him?

1348
01:27:13,985 --> 01:27:16,852
I'd rather not talk about it
when you have one foot out the door,

1349
01:27:16,921 --> 01:27:18,354
if that's okay.

1350
01:27:22,193 --> 01:27:23,182
All right.

1351
01:27:24,896 --> 01:27:27,160
- (CLEARS THROAT) I'm gonna go.
- Have a good show.

1352
01:27:27,365 --> 01:27:28,354
Thank you.

1353
01:27:31,169 --> 01:27:32,295
Dave, Lisa.

1354
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:33,701
- Hi.
- How are you?

1355
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,429
So...

1356
01:27:38,309 --> 01:27:40,834
Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends.

1357
01:27:40,912 --> 01:27:44,575
He's a terrific lawyer, and if
he doesn't know what to do himself,

1358
01:27:44,649 --> 01:27:46,674
he'll certainly know someone
we can talk to.

1359
01:27:46,751 --> 01:27:48,048
Okay, great.

1360
01:27:48,886 --> 01:27:51,753
When someone is killed,
it's what's called a wrongful death suit,

1361
01:27:51,956 --> 01:27:54,891
which is a statutory case,
which means there's a statute

1362
01:27:54,959 --> 01:27:57,860
passed by a legislature
which gives you the right to bring the case.

1363
01:27:58,062 --> 01:27:59,222
As opposed to what?

1364
01:27:59,364 --> 01:28:01,696
As opposed to common law,
which is law passed by judges,

1365
01:28:01,766 --> 01:28:03,324
which is why the damages are limited.

1366
01:28:03,534 --> 01:28:06,264
- I don't understand.
- Just skip that part.

1367
01:28:06,337 --> 01:28:07,804
We don't care about that.

1368
01:28:07,872 --> 01:28:09,840
I thought we were trying to get
the police to arrest this guy.

1369
01:28:09,974 --> 01:28:12,374
- No, the police are not gonna...
- Why not? They told me

1370
01:28:12,443 --> 01:28:13,671
they were gonna look into it again.

1371
01:28:13,745 --> 01:28:15,440
I'm just telling you that even if they do,

1372
01:28:15,513 --> 01:28:17,310
there is no way in this world
the police are gonna recommend

1373
01:28:17,382 --> 01:28:20,476
- to the DA that they charge this guy.
- So, what can we do?

1374
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:21,984
- I'm getting to that.
- Sorry.

1375
01:28:22,053 --> 01:28:23,281
- That's okay.
- EMILY: That's okay, honey.

1376
01:28:23,354 --> 01:28:25,481
I'm just getting to that.

1377
01:28:25,556 --> 01:28:27,820
You can't do anything
unless you're a relative...

1378
01:28:28,192 --> 01:28:31,855
She didn't have any relatives,
except for those idiots in Arizona.

1379
01:28:31,929 --> 01:28:35,365
Hang on a minute. Or unless
you're the executor of her estate...

1380
01:28:35,433 --> 01:28:39,164
- I am the executor of her estate.
- Which is Emily. I know.

1381
01:28:40,905 --> 01:28:44,397
Because the executor of her estate
can bring a wrongful death suit,

1382
01:28:44,475 --> 01:28:47,967
but the beneficiary has to be a relative.

1383
01:28:48,046 --> 01:28:49,877
So let me explain about that.

1384
01:28:51,182 --> 01:28:55,118
In a wrongful death suit
you can sue for pain and suffering,

1385
01:28:55,186 --> 01:28:58,349
pecuniary losses,
loss of support or services.

1386
01:28:58,423 --> 01:29:00,857
Also what's called
care, comfort and society.

1387
01:29:01,392 --> 01:29:04,452
It's like advice or counseling
of the parent that the kids

1388
01:29:04,529 --> 01:29:06,656
- aren't gonna get anymore.
- I don't understand.

1389
01:29:06,731 --> 01:29:08,926
Who are we suing? The bus driver?

1390
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,566
Well, no, because the bus driver
wouldn't have any money.

1391
01:29:11,636 --> 01:29:14,036
You basically sue everybody
and hope something sticks.

1392
01:29:14,105 --> 01:29:17,268
The person who pays will
probably be the MTA's insurance company.

1393
01:29:17,442 --> 01:29:19,467
But do you think the driver would get fired?

1394
01:29:20,278 --> 01:29:21,745
No. Not necessarily.

1395
01:29:22,046 --> 01:29:24,378
Even if all the facts came out at the trial?

1396
01:29:27,085 --> 01:29:30,885
- Maybe. I don't know.
- But how much could they be liable for?

1397
01:29:30,955 --> 01:29:32,650
- It depends...
- How badly do you think

1398
01:29:32,724 --> 01:29:33,748
we could ever hurt them?

1399
01:29:33,825 --> 01:29:37,192
If she was alive, and in pain
for an extended period of time,

1400
01:29:37,729 --> 01:29:39,287
they give more money for that.

1401
01:29:41,099 --> 01:29:44,591
I'd say she was alive for 10 minutes.

1402
01:29:45,837 --> 01:29:48,203
Was she conscious?
Was she awake the whole time?

1403
01:29:51,642 --> 01:29:53,337
I'm sorry, Emily.

1404
01:29:54,412 --> 01:29:57,176
Yeah, awake.

1405
01:29:58,783 --> 01:30:01,377
- It's okay.
- Well...

1406
01:30:03,354 --> 01:30:05,879
If she was in a lot of pain for that long,

1407
01:30:06,924 --> 01:30:10,416
I don't know,
maybe 300,000, half a million dollars

1408
01:30:10,495 --> 01:30:11,757
to get a sustainable verdict.

1409
01:30:11,829 --> 01:30:15,060
A brain damaged baby
would be three million.

1410
01:30:15,466 --> 01:30:18,924
But the truth is, Lisa,
when all is said and done,

1411
01:30:19,003 --> 01:30:21,130
- it's not a very good case.
- Why not?

1412
01:30:21,305 --> 01:30:22,602
Because it's your word against his,

1413
01:30:22,673 --> 01:30:25,699
and because you already lied
on your first deposition.

1414
01:30:25,777 --> 01:30:29,406
A red light case
is a 50-50 proposition already.

1415
01:30:29,514 --> 01:30:33,177
And with only one eyewitness,
with two conflicting statements?

1416
01:30:34,018 --> 01:30:36,009
I wouldn't take that case.

1417
01:30:40,792 --> 01:30:43,454
Nobody really cares about
getting a lot of money here.

1418
01:30:43,528 --> 01:30:44,859
I understand that, but...

1419
01:30:44,929 --> 01:30:46,260
We just want this prick to suffer,

1420
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:49,629
and we want the bus company to take
responsibility for hiring this guy.

1421
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:52,464
I understand that.
But no matter how you slice it,

1422
01:30:52,537 --> 01:30:56,303
the fact that Lisa lied on her first
statement is a disaster for your lawyer.

1423
01:30:58,776 --> 01:31:02,268
Can't I explain why I lied the first time?

1424
01:31:02,346 --> 01:31:04,746
It's not like I'm trying
to get any money for myself.

1425
01:31:04,816 --> 01:31:09,412
That's true. She has no financial interest,
she can't be impeached for bias.

1426
01:31:09,821 --> 01:31:11,982
Impeached for what?

1427
01:31:12,056 --> 01:31:15,287
She can't have her credibility
attacked on financial grounds

1428
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:17,623
because the jury knows
you're not gonna get any money if you win.

1429
01:31:17,695 --> 01:31:18,992
So that's something, isn't it?

1430
01:31:19,063 --> 01:31:21,429
But do you really think
we know what that means?

1431
01:31:21,499 --> 01:31:23,023
I'm sorry. That's what it's called.

1432
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,692
But who are you talking to?

1433
01:31:25,002 --> 01:31:27,232
You know we don't know what that means.

1434
01:31:27,305 --> 01:31:31,435
It's like you're not really concentrating.
You're not concentrating.

1435
01:31:32,944 --> 01:31:36,004
I don't know. I am concentrating.

1436
01:31:37,682 --> 01:31:39,240
I'm just thinking out loud.

1437
01:31:39,817 --> 01:31:40,806
Okay.

1438
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,414
All right. I'm sorry.

1439
01:31:47,892 --> 01:31:48,916
I'm sorry!

1440
01:31:49,393 --> 01:31:51,657
Okay. All right.

1441
01:31:53,297 --> 01:31:55,265
EMILY: He wasn't always
a lawyer, you know.

1442
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:57,733
He used to be a very nice, little boy.

1443
01:32:01,105 --> 01:32:02,504
(DAVE CHUCKLES)

1444
01:32:04,008 --> 01:32:06,135
- Anyway...
- Anyway, the whole point of this

1445
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:07,677
- is to get...
- To fucking get this guy!

1446
01:32:07,745 --> 01:32:10,509
It was to get him out from behind
the wheel of a bus!

1447
01:32:11,249 --> 01:32:12,978
Did she know she was dying?

1448
01:32:18,289 --> 01:32:22,783
I only ask because the terror of knowing
you're dying raises the damages.

1449
01:32:23,661 --> 01:32:26,494
I think she had a pretty good idea.

1450
01:32:30,368 --> 01:32:33,565
If she had lived for a couple more days
it would make the case better.

1451
01:32:33,638 --> 01:32:34,627
Thank you.

1452
01:32:35,773 --> 01:32:37,400
Thanks.

1453
01:32:41,078 --> 01:32:44,570
I know that sounds horrible,
but that's what it comes down to.

1454
01:32:46,817 --> 01:32:48,409
We know, Dave.

1455
01:32:48,886 --> 01:32:49,875
It's okay.

1456
01:32:56,961 --> 01:33:01,898
I would just like somebody
to take responsibility for what happened.

1457
01:33:14,445 --> 01:33:18,677
JOHN: "As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

1458
01:33:19,083 --> 01:33:21,347
"They kill us for their sport."

1459
01:33:21,419 --> 01:33:25,287
"As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

1460
01:33:26,557 --> 01:33:28,388
"They kill us for their sport."

1461
01:33:33,931 --> 01:33:35,455
What do you make of that?

1462
01:33:38,669 --> 01:33:41,103
Lisa? Lisa?

1463
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,002
I don't know.

1464
01:33:45,009 --> 01:33:47,102
You know what, Lisa?
That's not good enough.

1465
01:33:47,378 --> 01:33:48,436
That's just not good enough.

1466
01:33:48,512 --> 01:33:51,072
Shakespeare wrote something.
What's your response?

1467
01:33:51,148 --> 01:33:54,083
And don't tell me you don't have one,
'cause I don't buy it.

1468
01:33:54,151 --> 01:33:57,643
I don't really have a lot to say.
It seems pretty self-evident to me.

1469
01:34:01,826 --> 01:34:03,054
Matthew?

1470
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,218
MATTHEW: I think it is self-evident.

1471
01:34:04,295 --> 01:34:07,662
I think he's saying that human beings
don't mean any more to the gods

1472
01:34:07,732 --> 01:34:10,895
than flies do to little boys
who like to torture them for fun.

1473
01:34:10,968 --> 01:34:14,665
As far as the gods are concerned,
we're just ants. Nothing.

1474
01:34:15,139 --> 01:34:16,128
Darren?

1475
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:17,632
(DEEP VOICE) Thank you, Matthew.

1476
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:19,505
(ALL LAUGHING)

1477
01:34:19,577 --> 01:34:24,879
(NORMAL VOICE) Yeah, I agree. Only it's
not Shakespeare saying it, it's Gloucester.

1478
01:34:24,949 --> 01:34:28,043
Maybe another character
would have a different point of view.

1479
01:34:28,185 --> 01:34:31,552
Okay. That's a valid point.
Just because Shakespeare

1480
01:34:31,622 --> 01:34:35,524
has one of his characters say something,
doesn't mean he personally agrees with it.

1481
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,049
Yes, David?

1482
01:34:37,228 --> 01:34:40,493
Yeah, maybe Shakespeare
isn't saying the gods don't care about us.

1483
01:34:40,598 --> 01:34:43,692
Maybe he's saying there's
a higher consciousness that we can't see.

1484
01:34:43,768 --> 01:34:47,534
That the gods' perception of reality
is so much more developed than ours

1485
01:34:47,705 --> 01:34:48,899
that, compared to their perception,

1486
01:34:48,973 --> 01:34:51,874
our perceptions
are like comparing flies to boys.

1487
01:34:52,376 --> 01:34:55,868
Okay, I really don't think that
that's what he's getting at.

1488
01:34:55,946 --> 01:34:57,846
What I think he's getting at here

1489
01:34:57,915 --> 01:35:02,511
is a very dark view of
the arbitrary nature of human suffering.

1490
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:03,951
But maybe he's not.

1491
01:35:04,021 --> 01:35:07,047
Maybe he's comparing human
consciousness to divine consciousness

1492
01:35:07,224 --> 01:35:10,250
and that even though it seems to
us that human suffering is just arbitrary,

1493
01:35:10,327 --> 01:35:13,319
that's just because
we're limited by our viewpoint.

1494
01:35:15,099 --> 01:35:16,862
Okay, I...

1495
01:35:16,934 --> 01:35:18,663
I still don't think that's what he's saying.

1496
01:35:18,736 --> 01:35:21,398
No, like, if you say
they kill us for their sport,

1497
01:35:21,472 --> 01:35:23,269
when our perception
of the gods is so meager

1498
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:25,740
that we can't even tell what they're doing,

1499
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:29,473
then how can we be so arrogant as to think
they'd even bother to kill us for their sport?

1500
01:35:32,716 --> 01:35:33,978
I don't know.

1501
01:35:35,786 --> 01:35:36,810
Uh...

1502
01:35:36,887 --> 01:35:38,218
Monica?

1503
01:35:38,322 --> 01:35:41,223
I don't think that's what he's saying at all.

1504
01:35:41,292 --> 01:35:44,784
I think he's saying the gods
don't give a shit about human beings

1505
01:35:44,862 --> 01:35:47,854
and that they just like to kill
and torture us for fun.

1506
01:35:47,998 --> 01:35:50,990
But if the gods' consciousness
is so much more developed than ours

1507
01:35:51,135 --> 01:35:52,727
that we seem like flies to them,

1508
01:35:52,803 --> 01:35:55,067
then how can we be sure
what they have in mind for us

1509
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:56,367
or why they do anything?

1510
01:35:56,507 --> 01:35:59,067
Okay, David,
I think you've made your point.

1511
01:35:59,243 --> 01:36:00,676
But it's not what Shakespeare meant.

1512
01:36:00,744 --> 01:36:03,372
Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent
that he's trying to say something...

1513
01:36:03,447 --> 01:36:05,972
- Scholarly opinion?
...about human suffering here.

1514
01:36:06,117 --> 01:36:08,847
What are you saying?
A thousand Frenchmen can't be wrong?

1515
01:36:08,986 --> 01:36:10,977
No, I'm not saying that.
But I would like to move on...

1516

DAVID: Well, I think he is saying that.

1517
01:36:12,656 --> 01:36:15,250
Because he's comparing
human consciousness to flies

1518
01:36:15,326 --> 01:36:16,884
and he's saying
we can't see the truth around us

1519
01:36:16,961 --> 01:36:18,588
because our consciousness is undeveloped.

1520
01:36:18,662 --> 01:36:22,291
No, David, you're wrong.
That's not what Shakespeare meant.

1521
01:36:22,533 --> 01:36:25,627
He says it somewhere else in the play,
but I don't want to get hung up on this,

1522
01:36:25,703 --> 01:36:28,467
because that's not
what Shakespeare meant.

(DETECTIVE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1528
01:36:50,661 --> 01:36:52,390
Detective Mitchell.

1529
01:36:52,463 --> 01:36:54,260
Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling.

1530
01:36:54,331 --> 01:36:56,765
<i>Hi, Lisa, what can I do for you?</i>

1531
01:36:56,901 --> 01:37:00,268
I was just wondering whatever happened,
if anything, with the case.

1532
01:37:00,337 --> 01:37:02,134
You said you might
re-interview the bus driver.

1533
01:37:02,473 --> 01:37:04,634
Yes, we did. We brought him back in.

1534
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:06,938
You did? What happened?

1535
01:37:07,011 --> 01:37:10,469
Well, he basically
stuck by his original representation

1536
01:37:10,548 --> 01:37:12,675
and that was pretty much it.

1537
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:15,751
<i>I brought it up with my sergeant,
and he agreed with me</i>

1538
01:37:15,819 --> 01:37:19,311
<i>that we still don't have enough
to charge this guy,</i>

1539
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:23,383
<i>so there's not a lot more we can do
at this point.</i>

1540
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:27,294
Well, I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your job,

1541
01:37:27,364 --> 01:37:29,457
but how did you ask the questions?

1542
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:31,895
<i>- Excuse me?
- He's obviously not gonna</i>

1543
01:37:31,969 --> 01:37:35,234
<i>change his statement if you just ask him
really politely. Why would he?</i>

1544
01:37:35,306 --> 01:37:38,298
- We already know he's a liar.
- Hey, in the old days, Lisa,

1545
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:40,639
we'd just throw him in the back room
with a rubber hose

1546
01:37:40,711 --> 01:37:42,645
and get whatever answer
we want out of him.

1547
01:37:42,713 --> 01:37:44,908
But, fortunately, we don't do that anymore.

1548
01:37:44,982 --> 01:37:46,449
Yeah, not to white people.

1549
01:37:46,517 --> 01:37:47,848
Excuse me?

<i>You don't do it to white people.
Anyway, I'm not saying you...</i>

1551
01:37:50,921 --> 01:37:53,515
- Wait. We don't do it to who? Shh!
- Oh, my God!

1552
01:37:53,991 --> 01:37:57,483
First of all, I don't understand
why you bring this guy's race into it.

1553
01:37:58,062 --> 01:38:00,929
<i>- There's 40,000 cops in this city...
- Yes...</i>

1554
01:38:01,065 --> 01:38:04,466
And I hate to disillusion you,
but most of them are pretty good guys

<i>just tryin' to do their job.</i>

1556
01:38:06,103 --> 01:38:10,733
<i>Now, the bottom line is
the DA is not gonna take this case.</i>

1557
01:38:12,209 --> 01:38:15,736
Now, you could take it up with
my sergeant if you want to, but he's...

1558
01:38:15,813 --> 01:38:19,681
<i>- Yes, I would.
- Well, I will patch you through, then.</i>

1559
01:38:20,851 --> 01:38:23,843
The original decision
was based on false information.

1560
01:38:24,922 --> 01:38:26,856
So what's the point of even bringing...

1561
01:38:28,659 --> 01:38:30,524
So there's no way to appeal?

1562
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:36,822
But how do you know Detective Mitchell
interrogated him aggressively enough

1563
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:39,733
- if you weren't there?
- What's going on?

1564
01:38:43,307 --> 01:38:49,268
RAMON: My family is all there still,
but Rodrigo is studying in London,

1565
01:38:51,682 --> 01:38:53,445
and Hector is in Geneva.

1566
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:54,677
Uh-huh.

1567
01:38:55,452 --> 01:38:57,716
I'm sure they will go back
eventually because

1568
01:38:57,788 --> 01:39:00,848
they will like to do something
for their country.

1569
01:39:00,924 --> 01:39:04,416
But it's a worry. It's very bad there now.

1570
01:39:04,528 --> 01:39:07,395
Yeah? I haven't really been following it.

1571
01:39:07,998 --> 01:39:12,435
It's a big mess.
Last year I helped to found an organization

1572
01:39:12,503 --> 01:39:16,337
to work with children
whose families have been killed

1573
01:39:16,407 --> 01:39:18,841
or the parents have been kidnapped.

1574
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:25,349
We try to find homes for them,
preferably in Colombia,

1575
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:30,718
because if we lose our young people,
that's it.

1576
01:39:31,622 --> 01:39:33,317
That's the future.

1577
01:39:36,026 --> 01:39:39,052
Yeah.
I wish I knew more about it.

1578
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:45,891
You think Lisa would be
interested in acting?

1579
01:39:48,172 --> 01:39:49,366
No. I don't.

1580
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:52,472
I think she has a lot of
contempt for it, actually.

1581
01:39:53,711 --> 01:39:55,804
Anyway, maybe it's the age.

1582
01:39:56,580 --> 01:40:00,516
She would prefer the world with no plays?
No films?

1583
01:40:01,051 --> 01:40:02,951
Oh. Who knows?

1584
01:40:06,623 --> 01:40:10,286
Would you like to see
a picture of my mother?

1585
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:12,321
Sure.

1586
01:40:13,197 --> 01:40:15,688
These are all my aunts and uncles.

1587
01:40:15,766 --> 01:40:17,563
- See? Big family.
- Mmm.

1588
01:43:10,374 --> 01:43:12,399
DAVE: So after I talked to you guys
the other day,

1589
01:43:12,476 --> 01:43:14,603
I called this P.I. I know to see if he could...

1590
01:43:14,678 --> 01:43:17,169
- You called a what? A what?
- (DAVE CHUCKLES)

1591
01:43:17,381 --> 01:43:21,408
Private investigator, to see if he could
find anything out about your bus driver.

1592
01:43:21,485 --> 01:43:22,474
- Really?
- Yeah.

1593
01:43:22,786 --> 01:43:25,254
- Dave! I can't believe you called...
- Wait, let me tell you what he said.

1594
01:43:25,322 --> 01:43:28,849
So he calls someone he knows who
used to work as a cop at the MTA.

1595
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,060
And you know
the MTA have their own police?

1596
01:43:32,129 --> 01:43:33,653
The MTA police?

1597
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:37,222
- They have their own uniforms...
- Yeah? Yeah?

1598
01:43:37,301 --> 01:43:38,996
- Just a minute!
- Jesus Christ!

1599
01:43:39,069 --> 01:43:43,199
What the fuck do we care
about the MTA police and their uniforms?

1600
01:43:45,075 --> 01:43:48,442
Okay, so this guy gets a look
at your guy's file.

1601
01:43:48,512 --> 01:43:51,948
It turns out he's had two previous
accidents less than two years apart.

1602
01:43:52,015 --> 01:43:53,073
What?

1603
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:55,209
But that he's never been disciplined
or cited,

1604
01:43:55,285 --> 01:43:56,718
just moved around to different shifts.

1605
01:43:56,787 --> 01:43:59,017
- Are you kidding me?
- Why does this not shock me?

1606
01:43:59,189 --> 01:44:00,952
If you read the papers, you'll know that

1607
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:04,516
they're going through a protracted
labor dispute at the MTA right now.

1608
01:44:04,595 --> 01:44:06,187
And according to my P.I.,

1609
01:44:06,263 --> 01:44:09,755
management doesn't want to
aggravate the situation by firing this guy.

1610
01:44:09,833 --> 01:44:11,198
This is making me sick.

1611
01:44:11,268 --> 01:44:13,498
I know, but what it means, Lisa,
is that we have a case.

1612
01:44:13,637 --> 01:44:15,332
- We do?
- We can now sue

1613
01:44:15,405 --> 01:44:17,532
for what's called "negligent retention."

1614
01:44:17,608 --> 01:44:20,338
Which just means they should have known
this guy was a bad risk,

1615
01:44:20,410 --> 01:44:23,902
and they negligently retained him until,
finally, he killed somebody.

1616
01:44:24,348 --> 01:44:25,975
- You can prove that?
- Sure, because

1617
01:44:26,049 --> 01:44:28,483
we can just subpoena their
personnel records,

1618
01:44:28,552 --> 01:44:31,112
which we already know
contain damaging information.

1619
01:44:31,188 --> 01:44:33,520
- But you wouldn't be our lawyer, right?
- No.

1620
01:44:33,624 --> 01:44:34,613
LISA: Why not?

1621
01:44:34,791 --> 01:44:36,952
- I'm not a personal injury litigator.
- It's not his area.

1622
01:44:37,027 --> 01:44:39,552
I don't know enough about it. I would lose.

1623
01:44:39,863 --> 01:44:42,093
But you could recommend someone?

1624
01:44:43,166 --> 01:44:44,599
Sure, sure.

1625
01:44:45,969 --> 01:44:47,402
I know a very good guy.

1626
01:44:47,471 --> 01:44:50,269
His name is Russel Deutsch.
He's not a sleazebag.

1627
01:44:51,108 --> 01:44:53,269
Very, very experienced.

1628
01:44:54,144 --> 01:44:57,636
You gotta get that crazy cousin on board,
she's gonna be your beneficiary.

1629
01:44:57,714 --> 01:44:59,272
She's not gonna want to come
to New York.

1630
01:44:59,650 --> 01:45:01,208
I can tell you that right now.

1631
01:45:01,852 --> 01:45:07,222
If you win, she stands to get anywhere
from $300,000 to $500,000.

1632
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:09,417
She's coming to New York.

1633
01:45:09,893 --> 01:45:11,383
You're awesome!

1634
01:45:12,396 --> 01:45:15,888
First thing we do is we file
a summons and a complaint

1635
01:45:15,966 --> 01:45:18,730
against the MTA.
They get days 20 to respond,

1636
01:45:18,802 --> 01:45:21,464
and when they do,
we can make our discovery requests.

1637
01:45:21,538 --> 01:45:24,200
Accident reports,
personnel records, etcetera.

1638
01:45:24,274 --> 01:45:28,335
But now, you gotta realize,
this is going to take some time.

1639
01:45:28,612 --> 01:45:32,104
The law says you have to
have a court date within one year.

1640
01:45:32,249 --> 01:45:35,082
Usually it takes around six, depending.

1641
01:45:35,152 --> 01:45:37,211
- LISA: Six years?
- Yes, depending.

1642
01:45:37,421 --> 01:45:38,911
EMILY: Now, I mentioned to Dave,

1643
01:45:38,989 --> 01:45:41,924
<i>I have a friend who writes for
the Metro section of The Times.</i>

1644
01:45:41,992 --> 01:45:46,361
Yes, now, if it could really happen,
this changes everything in our favor.

1645
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:48,557
If they think there's gonna be
adverse publicity,

1646
01:45:48,632 --> 01:45:50,156
<i>especially in The New York Times,</i>

1647
01:45:50,267 --> 01:45:51,393
they're gonna want to settle right away,

1648
01:45:51,468 --> 01:45:54,198
as soon as possible,
and as quietly as possible.

1649
01:45:54,337 --> 01:45:57,329
So they'd make it a condition
that we didn't...

1650
01:45:57,407 --> 01:45:59,466
It usually works, you get the money,
but you can't talk about it.

1651
01:45:59,743 --> 01:46:00,732
Nobody knows the terms.

1652
01:46:00,977 --> 01:46:02,968
So what good does that do?

1653
01:46:03,146 --> 01:46:04,773
You get the money.

1654
01:46:05,749 --> 01:46:06,738
Is that bad?

1655
01:46:08,118 --> 01:46:11,610
This is how our society punishes people
for doing bad things.

1656
01:46:11,688 --> 01:46:14,680
By getting money from their employers'
insurance companies?

1657
01:46:14,758 --> 01:46:17,056
Yes. It's called "punitive damages."

1658
01:46:18,829 --> 01:46:22,321
Could we insist they fire the driver?
As part of the settlement?

1659
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:25,891
- Sure, why not?
- Is that something people do?

1660
01:46:25,969 --> 01:46:27,061
Sure. It's one of your conditions.

1661
01:46:27,504 --> 01:46:30,302
And you think we're gonna win?

1662
01:46:31,208 --> 01:46:33,039
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, they're gonna settle.

1663
01:46:42,552 --> 01:46:43,541
Oh. Hi.

1664
01:46:45,222 --> 01:46:46,450
I want to talk to you.

1665
01:46:47,057 --> 01:46:49,389
I take it that's my report card?

1666
01:46:49,659 --> 01:46:50,887
It sure is.

1667
01:46:58,635 --> 01:47:02,127
I had a friend who used to
live on this block, at 262?

1668
01:47:03,106 --> 01:47:04,130
Oh.

1669
01:47:04,207 --> 01:47:07,335
That's so nice.
Yeah, I don't know if you know her.

1670
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:09,810
Cheryl Rowan? She's a physiotherapist?

1671
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:12,841
No, I don't know her.

1672
01:47:12,916 --> 01:47:14,611
I think about 1,000 people must...

1673
01:47:14,684 --> 01:47:15,844
What?

1674
01:47:16,953 --> 01:47:17,942
Nothing.

1675
01:47:19,790 --> 01:47:23,157
- Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?
- Oh, yeah.

1676
01:47:23,226 --> 01:47:24,921
LISA: It's really good, you should go see it.

1677
01:47:24,995 --> 01:47:28,487
Well, the play is great,
and it has this really nice cast.

1678
01:47:28,698 --> 01:47:31,428
LISA: She's being modest.
She's gonna win every award in New York.

1679
01:47:31,701 --> 01:47:33,726
Oh, all that stuff's a long way off.

1680
01:47:34,304 --> 01:47:36,272
EMILY: I don't go to the theater very much.

1681
01:47:36,339 --> 01:47:39,900
No, it's just nice, because
you can work a long time in the theater

1682
01:47:39,976 --> 01:47:43,377
and play a lot of great parts
and not get a lot of recognition.

1683
01:47:43,446 --> 01:47:46,847
And even though you don't necessarily
do it for that as your primary motive,

1684
01:47:46,917 --> 01:47:50,409
it is nice when people do notice something
you've done.

1685
01:47:50,487 --> 01:47:53,979
I was on a television show a few years ago.
I'd been doing theater all my life,

1686
01:47:54,057 --> 01:47:57,549
and suddenly all my relatives
started calling to congratulate me

1687
01:47:57,627 --> 01:47:59,458
because they thought I'd finally made it.
(CHUCKLES)

1688
01:47:59,529 --> 01:48:02,293
All it was was this dumb show
that paid the bills for a while.

1689
01:48:02,365 --> 01:48:04,526
That show was so stupid.

1690
01:48:04,601 --> 01:48:06,592
Well, it wasn't that bad.

1691
01:48:08,405 --> 01:48:10,930
Anyway, I realize this is
horribly embarrassing for Lisa,

1692
01:48:11,007 --> 01:48:13,567
but I just really wanted to meet you, Emily,

1693
01:48:13,643 --> 01:48:17,977
because you've frankly become
such a big part of Lisa's life,

1694
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:20,539
and I don't want to be intrusive,

1695
01:48:20,617 --> 01:48:23,745
but this whole court case seems to be
suddenly dominating everything

1696
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:25,447
and I can't get Lisa to tell me anything
about it.

1697
01:48:25,522 --> 01:48:28,013
- That's not true.
- Well, I can't.

1698
01:48:29,492 --> 01:48:30,550
I want you to know, Lisa,

1699
01:48:30,627 --> 01:48:33,528
I'm very, very proud of you
for pursuing this the way that you have.

1700
01:48:33,597 --> 01:48:37,658
But I can't let you pursue it to the point
where it's taking over your life

1701
01:48:37,734 --> 01:48:39,258
or interfering with your schoolwork.

1702
01:48:40,237 --> 01:48:42,137
See, it's come down to
a question of homework.

1703
01:48:42,205 --> 01:48:44,765
Lisa's on a half scholarship at her school.

1704
01:48:45,575 --> 01:48:49,067
I know she feels a real sense
of responsibility about what happened.

1705
01:48:49,246 --> 01:48:51,043
Yeah, I do.

1706
01:48:51,281 --> 01:48:54,512
I know you do. I know you do.
But you can't not do your homework

1707
01:48:54,584 --> 01:48:56,745
and you can't throw away
your scholarship because of it.

1708
01:48:56,953 --> 01:49:00,445
I'm not. My grades slipped a little.
They'll get better.

1709
01:49:00,724 --> 01:49:04,216
Anyone can do their homework.
You just sit down and do it.

1710
01:49:04,361 --> 01:49:06,295
I've been distracted. I'll stop.

1711
01:49:08,265 --> 01:49:10,961
- All right.
- We didn't need a big conference about it.

1712
01:49:11,034 --> 01:49:12,399
It's not a big conference.

1713
01:49:12,469 --> 01:49:15,961
(SIGHS) I just wanted to know
what was going on.

1714
01:49:17,407 --> 01:49:19,034
And I wanted to meet Emily.

1715
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,107
I know it's a little awkward.

1716
01:49:26,149 --> 01:49:29,641
Lisa? Do you think Emily would like
to see the play?

1717
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:33,018
I thought you could both come,
and then we could go out afterwards.

1718
01:49:33,089 --> 01:49:34,454
All right. Let me ask her.

1719
01:49:37,527 --> 01:49:39,461
Okay.

1720
01:49:40,063 --> 01:49:41,997
Dig in everybody.

1721
01:49:46,169 --> 01:49:48,160
I was thinking about spending
next year with Dad.

1722
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:51,430
- Oh?
- Yeah.

1723
01:49:52,442 --> 01:49:53,807
You're worried about my grades.

1724
01:49:53,877 --> 01:49:55,538
They have really good public schools
in Santa Monica

1725
01:49:55,612 --> 01:49:57,204
and if I officially lived with him,

1726
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,111
you wouldn't have to worry
about my scholarship.

1727
01:50:00,383 --> 01:50:03,875
- Have you talked to him about this?
- We've had some general discussions.

1728
01:50:03,954 --> 01:50:05,546
- Do you want to go, too?
- CURTIS: Me?

1729
01:50:05,622 --> 01:50:07,852
- Yeah. Do you want to move to LA, too?
- No.

1730
01:50:08,058 --> 01:50:09,457
Well, let me know if you do.

1731
01:50:09,526 --> 01:50:11,323
LISA: Why are you being like this?

1732
01:50:11,394 --> 01:50:14,727
- Why am I being like what?
- Why are you about to start crying?

1733
01:50:14,798 --> 01:50:16,663
Because it's your intention
to make me start crying!

1734
01:50:16,733 --> 01:50:18,064
No, it's not.

1735
01:50:18,768 --> 01:50:20,235
You want to move to LA, move to LA.

1736
01:50:20,303 --> 01:50:22,771
Why can't this even be mentioned
without you taking it personally?

1737
01:50:22,839 --> 01:50:24,773
- I'm just introducing a possibility!
- (CLATTERING)

1738
01:50:24,841 --> 01:50:27,969
Here's a possibility, that you can
make your own fucking dinner!

1739
01:50:28,044 --> 01:50:30,069
Here's a possibility, that you can do
whatever you want to do...

1740
01:50:30,146 --> 01:50:31,579
Jesus Christ! What is with you?

1741
01:50:31,648 --> 01:50:33,240
I don't care anymore,
you heartless little fucking bitch!

1742
01:50:33,316 --> 01:50:34,613
Keep it up!
This really makes me want to stay here!

1743
01:50:34,684 --> 01:50:36,481
You think you're so fucking perfect?

1744
01:50:36,553 --> 01:50:37,542
No!

1745
01:50:40,357 --> 01:50:42,348
- Nice one.
- Shut up!

1746
01:50:43,593 --> 01:50:44,890
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

1747
01:50:44,961 --> 01:50:46,656
Let me tell you something, Eliot.

1748
01:51:25,435 --> 01:51:27,562
How would you describe
the relationship overall?

1749
01:51:30,173 --> 01:51:32,767
Did you talk on the phone a lot?
Were there a lot of visits?

1750
01:51:32,909 --> 01:51:36,401
I would say we talked on the phone
a couple of times a month, at least.

1751
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:40,475
Sometimes more than that.
I would call her, she would call me.

1752
01:51:41,618 --> 01:51:45,019
DEUTSCH: And what were the nature
of the conversations?

1753
01:51:45,355 --> 01:51:49,416
ABIGAIL: Oh, family stuff, mostly.
Her family, my kids.

1754
01:51:50,126 --> 01:51:52,424
She'd give you advice about your family?
That kind of thing?

1755
01:51:52,662 --> 01:51:55,187
Oh, I would say so, yes.

1756
01:51:55,732 --> 01:51:56,926
Do you have any phone records?

1757
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,833
I have all my phone bills,
if that's what you mean.

1758
01:52:00,203 --> 01:52:02,171
I didn't record the actual conversations.

1759
01:52:02,238 --> 01:52:03,364
No, no.

1760
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:06,204
You'll see we talked on the phone
quite frequently.

1761
01:52:06,509 --> 01:52:10,502
- Okay, terrific. I see you came prepared.
- Well, I wanted to bring everything.

1762
01:52:10,814 --> 01:52:13,374
Now, when they take your deposition,

1763
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:15,315
you're gonna say the same thing
you just told me.

1764
01:52:15,385 --> 01:52:16,682
Just talk about the relationship.

1765
01:52:16,986 --> 01:52:18,248
Uh-huh.

1766
01:52:18,321 --> 01:52:20,983
- Kind of advice she used to give.
- Okay.

1767
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:26,757
Now, Emily,
where did you find this lawyer?

1768
01:52:27,263 --> 01:52:29,731
EMILY: He was recommended by my friend.

1769
01:52:31,801 --> 01:52:36,135
I'm asking because my husband knows
a real good New York lawyer

1770
01:52:36,739 --> 01:52:40,004
and I'm not entirely comfortable
with someone no one's ever heard of.

1771
01:52:40,176 --> 01:52:43,168
EMILY: My friend's heard of him.
He says he's very good.

1772
01:52:43,413 --> 01:52:44,778
Well, I'm sure he is.

1773
01:52:44,848 --> 01:52:48,511
But I have a responsibility
in this situation

1774
01:52:48,852 --> 01:52:52,288
and I would feel a whole lot more
comfortable with someone who didn't just

1775
01:52:52,355 --> 01:52:54,050
drop in out of the clear blue sky.

1776
01:52:54,124 --> 01:52:58,823
He didn't drop in out of the clear blue sky.
He was recommended by my friend.

1777
01:52:59,963 --> 01:53:04,627
But, Abigail, even if we switched lawyers,
we'd still have to pay him.

1778
01:53:04,767 --> 01:53:07,964
It all comes out of the settlement,
so it's really up to you.

1779
01:53:08,037 --> 01:53:09,971
No, if you all think he's good...

1780
01:53:10,173 --> 01:53:11,834
I don't know whether he is or not.

1781
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:14,839
- My friend thinks he is.
- All right.

1782
01:53:16,479 --> 01:53:19,141
Now, Lisa, what's your involvement
in all this?

1783
01:53:19,215 --> 01:53:20,876
What's your angle?

1784
01:53:21,818 --> 01:53:24,252
I just wanted to...

1785
01:53:26,122 --> 01:53:27,749
I was just there.

1786
01:53:31,194 --> 01:53:33,788
LISA: And that's you and Monica,
obviously.

1787
01:53:34,264 --> 01:53:35,561
EMILY: Mmm-hmm.

1788
01:53:36,432 --> 01:53:38,696
Oh, my God, is that you?

1789
01:53:40,170 --> 01:53:41,501
That's me.

1790
01:53:45,108 --> 01:53:46,871
Oh, my God. Is that her daughter?

1791
01:53:48,311 --> 01:53:49,608
EMILY: Mmm-hmm.

1792
01:53:50,146 --> 01:53:51,306
God...

1793
01:53:51,514 --> 01:53:53,641
So, how old was she when she died?

1794
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:56,107
Twelve.

1795
01:53:56,986 --> 01:53:58,613
God, I can't even imagine.

1796
01:53:59,622 --> 01:54:00,714
Neither could we.

1797
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:09,456
Do you know Monica asked about her
when she was dying?

1798
01:54:11,868 --> 01:54:13,267
No, I didn't.

1799
01:54:13,436 --> 01:54:15,666
Yeah, I think she was confused, like,

1800
01:54:16,039 --> 01:54:18,371
I think she thought
I was her daughter for a minute.

1801
01:54:18,641 --> 01:54:22,338
Then she was asking me to call her,
like, to tell her what happened, you know?

1802
01:54:22,745 --> 01:54:24,679
Like she didn't remember she was dead.

1803
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:31,314
But, then it got confusing, because I said,
"Sure, what's her name?"

1804
01:54:31,721 --> 01:54:34,884
And she said her name was Lisa.
And I said, "No, that's my name."

1805
01:54:36,593 --> 01:54:38,891
I didn't realize we had the same name.

1806
01:54:42,932 --> 01:54:44,832
And when I found out
her daughter was dead,

1807
01:54:45,335 --> 01:54:46,632
ever since then

1808
01:54:47,103 --> 01:54:52,507
I've had this really strange feeling that,
some way, for those last five minutes,

1809
01:54:53,376 --> 01:54:55,367
I kind of was her daughter.

1810
01:54:55,979 --> 01:54:59,278
You know, like in some weird way,
this obviously amazing woman

1811
01:54:59,682 --> 01:55:03,311
got to be with her daughter again
for a few minutes, right before she died.

1812
01:55:04,554 --> 01:55:07,887
And is she still inhabiting your body?

1813
01:55:07,957 --> 01:55:11,120
Or did she go right back to the spirit world
after it was over?

1814
01:55:11,261 --> 01:55:13,627
I didn't mean she was literally
inhabiting my body.

1815
01:55:13,696 --> 01:55:14,993
I don't believe in all that stuff at all.

1816
01:55:15,064 --> 01:55:17,464
I don't give a fuck what you believe in.

1817
01:55:17,533 --> 01:55:19,763
Oh, my God! Why are you so mad at me?

1818
01:55:19,836 --> 01:55:21,701
Because this is not an opera!

1819
01:55:21,771 --> 01:55:24,331
- What?
- I said this is not an opera!

1820
01:55:24,407 --> 01:55:26,204
You think I think this is an opera?

1821
01:55:26,276 --> 01:55:28,437
- Yes!
- Because I think it's dramatic?

1822
01:55:28,645 --> 01:55:29,907
I think you're very young.

1823
01:55:29,979 --> 01:55:31,344
What does that have to do with anything?

1824
01:55:31,414 --> 01:55:34,315
If anything, I think it means I care
more than someone who's older,

1825
01:55:34,384 --> 01:55:36,352
because this kind of thing
has never happened to me before!

1826
01:55:36,753 --> 01:55:41,122
No, it means you care more easily.
There's a big difference.

1827
01:55:41,424 --> 01:55:43,415
Only it's not you that it's happening to.

1828
01:55:43,526 --> 01:55:46,654
Yes, it is! I know I'm not the one
who was run over by a bus...

1829
01:55:46,729 --> 01:55:47,923
That's right, you weren't.

1830
01:55:47,997 --> 01:55:49,965
And you're not the one
who died of leukemia

1831
01:55:50,033 --> 01:55:52,968
and you're not the one who just died
in an earthquake in Algeria!

1832
01:55:53,069 --> 01:55:55,731
But you will be. Do you understand me?
You will be.

1833
01:55:55,872 --> 01:55:57,931
- And it's not dramatic.
- I'm well aware of that!

1834
01:55:58,007 --> 01:56:01,966
This first-blush, phony deepness of yours
is worth nothing.

1835
01:56:02,045 --> 01:56:03,069
- Oh, wow.
- Do you understand?

1836
01:56:03,146 --> 01:56:04,613
It's not worth anything!

1837
01:56:04,814 --> 01:56:06,714
Because it'll all be troweled over
in a month or two.

1838
01:56:06,783 --> 01:56:07,807
And when you get older

1839
01:56:07,884 --> 01:56:11,251
and you don't have a big reaction
every time a dog is run over,

1840
01:56:11,321 --> 01:56:13,221
then we'll find out
what kind of a person you are!

1841
01:56:13,589 --> 01:56:16,786
I'm sorry, but I didn't start this
conversation and I don't play these games.

1842
01:56:16,859 --> 01:56:19,726
- I'm not playing games!
- And don't look so outraged!

1843
01:56:19,796 --> 01:56:22,424
You have every right to falsify
your own life,

1844
01:56:22,498 --> 01:56:25,661
but you have no right
to falsify anybody else's.

1845
01:56:25,902 --> 01:56:28,029
It's what makes people into Nazis!

1846
01:56:28,604 --> 01:56:30,936
And I'm sorry,
but it's just a little suspicious

1847
01:56:31,007 --> 01:56:33,771
that you're making such a big fuss
about this when you didn't even know her

1848
01:56:33,843 --> 01:56:35,401
and you're having troubles
with your own mother.

1849
01:56:35,478 --> 01:56:36,467
Oh, my God!

1850
01:56:36,746 --> 01:56:42,707
But this is my life we're talking about,
'cause it's my real friend who got killed,

1851
01:56:43,152 --> 01:56:45,848
who I'm never going to see again,

1852
01:56:46,022 --> 01:56:49,480
who I've known since
I was 19 years old myself.

1853
01:56:50,026 --> 01:56:53,393
And I don't want that sucked into some
adolescent self-dramatization!

1854
01:56:53,463 --> 01:56:57,763
I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!
I was there and you weren't,

1855
01:56:57,934 --> 01:57:00,425
and if I happen to express myself
a little hyperbolically, Emily,

1856
01:57:00,503 --> 01:57:02,027
that's just the way I talk!

1857
01:57:02,105 --> 01:57:05,768
I can't help it if my mother's an actress!
Why are you being so fucking strident?

1858
01:57:05,908 --> 01:57:06,897
(SLAMS)

1859
01:57:07,276 --> 01:57:08,538
- "Strident"?
- Yeah.

1860
01:57:08,644 --> 01:57:09,736
Okay.

1861
01:57:10,713 --> 01:57:11,702
You should leave.

1862
01:57:11,881 --> 01:57:13,143
Why? Because I called you strident?

1863
01:57:13,449 --> 01:57:15,246
Yeah. You should leave.

1864
01:57:15,518 --> 01:57:16,610
Okay, I will.

1865
01:57:16,819 --> 01:57:18,377
- Now!
- Okay, let me get my bag!

1866
01:57:18,588 --> 01:57:22,024
All I meant by saying you were strident
is that you were being emphatic!

1867
01:57:22,091 --> 01:57:23,558
I obviously misused the word.

1868
01:57:23,626 --> 01:57:26,322
- Look it up when you get home.
- Jesus Christ. You're amazing.

1869
01:57:26,396 --> 01:57:29,160
- Yes. I'm amazing.
- Why are you doing this?

1870
01:57:29,232 --> 01:57:32,565
Lisa, I'm not doing anything.
I'm a human being.

1871
01:57:32,869 --> 01:57:34,700
Monica was a human being.

1872
01:57:34,904 --> 01:57:36,667
So was her daughter
and so is your mother.

1873
01:57:36,739 --> 01:57:40,505
We are not supporting characters
in the fascinating story of your life.

1874
01:57:40,576 --> 01:57:42,441
I never said or thought you were,

1875
01:57:42,512 --> 01:57:46,141
and I really didn't mean to call you
strident. I totally misused the word.

1876
01:57:46,215 --> 01:57:48,945
I wasn't trying to insult you, Emily.
I really wasn't.

1877
01:57:49,218 --> 01:57:51,846
(WEEPING)
I feel so bad about what happened

1878
01:57:51,921 --> 01:57:54,788
and I'm trying so hard
to do something about it.

1879
01:57:54,857 --> 01:57:57,121
I don't understand why,
if I say something wrong,

1880
01:57:57,193 --> 01:57:59,423
you can't just give me a break.

1881
01:58:01,264 --> 01:58:02,788
Thanks for letting me come over.

1882
01:58:03,499 --> 01:58:05,330
I know you don't want me here.

1883
01:58:05,535 --> 01:58:06,524
MR. AARON: It's all right.

1884
01:58:06,602 --> 01:58:08,593
But I didn't have anyone else to talk to.

1885
01:58:09,472 --> 01:58:12,407
You have always been very sympathetic
to my craziness,

1886
01:58:12,708 --> 01:58:16,200
and I may not show it all the time,
but I actually really appreciate it.

1887
01:58:16,312 --> 01:58:17,438
It's no problem.

1888
01:58:20,383 --> 01:58:21,577
So...

1889
01:58:22,251 --> 01:58:23,650
What's been going on?

1890
01:58:25,054 --> 01:58:26,316
I just need to talk to somebody

1891
01:58:26,389 --> 01:58:29,688
who doesn't completely
misunderstand who I am.

1892
01:58:29,992 --> 01:58:31,687
Or not even who I am,

1893
01:58:31,761 --> 01:58:34,730
but what's going on inside me,
or all around me.

1894
01:58:35,731 --> 01:58:38,393
- Sound confused enough?
- No, no.

1895
01:58:39,168 --> 01:58:42,729
Anyway,
for whatever reason,

1896
01:58:42,872 --> 01:58:46,569
I always felt like
we understood each other on some level.

1897
01:58:46,976 --> 01:58:50,241
Even though I'm like this mass of
conflicting impulses,

1898
01:58:50,546 --> 01:58:53,845
and you're basically the most
grownup, rational man I know.

1899
01:58:54,717 --> 01:58:58,016
I doubt that's actually true, but thank you.

1900
01:58:58,454 --> 01:58:59,819
(SIGHS)

1901
01:59:01,324 --> 01:59:03,224
It's just a little hot.

1902
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:05,357
A little warm.

1903
01:59:14,070 --> 01:59:16,197
- Is this all right?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1904
01:59:19,275 --> 01:59:21,175
Do you allow smoking in your apartment?

1905
01:59:25,147 --> 01:59:26,307
You can smoke.

1906
01:59:46,369 --> 01:59:48,428
- I like your apartment.
- Thanks.

1907
01:59:48,638 --> 01:59:50,538
It's a sublet, actually.

1908
01:59:53,709 --> 01:59:55,040
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

1909
02:00:10,793 --> 02:00:11,919
This is terrible.

1910
02:00:13,629 --> 02:00:14,823
What is?

1911
02:00:21,304 --> 02:00:22,532
What's terrible?

1912
02:00:24,907 --> 02:00:26,841
I just like you so much.

1913
02:00:27,209 --> 02:00:30,110
- Sorry. What a moron.
- Hey, Lisa. Lisa.

1914
02:00:31,981 --> 02:00:33,573
I'm your friend.

1915
02:00:34,584 --> 02:00:36,609
And that's not gonna change.

1916
02:00:38,154 --> 02:00:39,587
It's not gonna change.

1917
02:00:41,090 --> 02:00:42,216
Thanks.

1918
02:00:45,494 --> 02:00:47,394
I like you so, so much.

1919
02:01:27,036 --> 02:01:29,061
What's it like in Indiana?

1920
02:01:32,174 --> 02:01:33,232
It's okay.

1921
02:01:53,362 --> 02:01:55,728
MR. AARON: Please don't do that.
Don't do that.

1922
02:01:58,701 --> 02:02:01,465
I really wasn't expecting
anything like this to happen.

1923
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:05,907
I'm really not sure
how I'm supposed to react.

1924
02:02:06,442 --> 02:02:09,605
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody,
if that's what you're worried about.

1925
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:11,874
I totally initiated the whole thing.

1926
02:02:12,682 --> 02:02:15,014
Anyway, it's just sex.
You're acting like a little kid.

1927
02:02:15,084 --> 02:02:16,984
I'll see you in school.

1928
02:02:30,199 --> 02:02:31,632
You're a fuckin' idiot!

1929
02:02:32,068 --> 02:02:35,299
I think teenagers should definitely
rule the world because

1930
02:02:35,371 --> 02:02:40,104
teenagers aren't corrupted by adult life yet
and they're idealistic and they care.

1931
02:02:40,443 --> 02:02:44,436
And I know a lot of people feel
that teenagers are really naive,

1932
02:02:44,513 --> 02:02:46,344
which they are, many of them.

1933
02:02:46,782 --> 02:02:49,751
But they still haven't had a chance
to get burned out by the disappointments

1934
02:02:49,819 --> 02:02:52,151
and harsh realities of learning
how to play the game.

1935
02:02:52,221 --> 02:02:54,314
So, yes, I would vote "yes."

1936
02:02:54,657 --> 02:02:56,955
All right. Lisa?

1937
02:02:57,293 --> 02:02:58,317
I'm not even gonna comment on the fact

1938
02:02:58,394 --> 02:03:00,589
that you just compared
a 19-year-old Palestinian

1939
02:03:00,663 --> 02:03:01,823
to a member of the Hitler Youth!

1940
02:03:01,897 --> 02:03:03,990
That's right, because they both
like to kill Jews.

1941
02:03:04,066 --> 02:03:05,363
- Lisa! Hey!
- Come on, guys.

1942
02:03:05,434 --> 02:03:07,163
It's not because they've been
occupied and humiliated

1943
02:03:07,236 --> 02:03:09,067
and bombed out of their homes
for the last 50 years?

1944
02:03:09,171 --> 02:03:10,263
That's partly why they like it.

1945
02:03:10,339 --> 02:03:12,068
It's not like killing civilians
is their last resort.

1946
02:03:12,174 --> 02:03:14,699
It's their first resort
because it's easy and they like it.

1947
02:03:14,777 --> 02:03:16,244
- MR. KLEIN: Raise your hands.
- They like it?

1948
02:03:16,312 --> 02:03:17,609
They're just bad people and they like it?

1949
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:18,772
Yes! There are bad people in the world.

1950
02:03:18,848 --> 02:03:20,748
I think they liked blowing up
the World Trade Center!

1951
02:03:20,816 --> 02:03:22,408
They kill their own sisters
when they get raped!

1952
02:03:22,485 --> 02:03:23,474
- It's called barbarism!
- Who?

1953
02:03:23,552 --> 02:03:25,486
It's practically all people do
is kill each other.

1954
02:03:25,554 --> 02:03:27,044
If they didn't like it, they wouldn't do it.

1955
02:03:27,156 --> 02:03:28,714
You guys aren't the only ones in the class!

1956
02:03:28,824 --> 02:03:29,813
You're not even Jewish, Lisa!

1957
02:03:29,892 --> 02:03:32,292
The next person who opens
their mouth without raising their hand...

1958
02:03:32,361 --> 02:03:35,330
I'm fucking half Jewish, and who cares
what I am? I'm anti-murder, not pro-Israel.

1959
02:03:35,397 --> 02:03:37,194
Lisa! You can leave!

1960
02:03:37,399 --> 02:03:39,629
Fine. Thank you.

1961
02:03:45,875 --> 02:03:47,467

I guess I lost my cool a little,
but there is such a thing as...

1963
02:03:54,917 --> 02:03:56,384
Who is running these discussions?

1964
02:03:56,452 --> 02:03:58,249
But, Lisa, you have to remember,

1965
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:02,984
it's always easy for the dominant side
to be content with the status quo.

1966
02:04:05,161 --> 02:04:06,389
How do you mean, Ramon?

1967
02:04:06,695 --> 02:04:10,791
I mean the oppressor uses violence
to maintain his position

1968
02:04:10,866 --> 02:04:12,800
and calls it the rule of law.

1969
02:04:13,502 --> 02:04:17,700
But when the person underfoot
uses violence to change his status,

1970
02:04:17,773 --> 02:04:19,832
he's called a criminal and a terrorist.

1971
02:04:20,442 --> 02:04:24,310
And the violence of the state
is called upon to put him down.

1972
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:25,569
EMILY: I see.

1973
02:04:25,915 --> 02:04:28,110
And what would you like them to do?

1974
02:04:29,952 --> 02:04:30,941
"They" meaning?

1975
02:04:31,787 --> 02:04:34,255
The Jew oppressors.
What would you like them to do?

1976
02:04:34,824 --> 02:04:36,485
I didn't use that expression.

1977
02:04:36,759 --> 02:04:38,590
- No, you didn't.
- But since you ask...

1978
02:04:38,661 --> 02:04:42,654
I spent the whole day arguing about this.
I didn't really mean to bring it up again.

1979
02:04:42,731 --> 02:04:45,222
- Don't handle me.
- I'm not handling you.

02:04:45,401 --> 02:04:47,369
- What did you think of the play?
- Don't bother, Mom.

1981
02:04:47,436 --> 02:04:51,065
And I think it's ironic in the extreme
that the victims of Nazis

1982
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:53,108
- find it essential...
- lf Israelis were like Nazis

1983
02:04:53,175 --> 02:04:55,006
- there wouldn't be any Arabs left.
...to use Nazi tactics...

1984
02:04:55,077 --> 02:04:56,510
- That's what I've been saying!
- EMILY: And I'm leaving.

1985
02:04:56,579 --> 02:04:58,570
That seems excessive, Emily, come on.

1986
02:04:59,048 --> 02:05:01,676
That's the response.
That's the Jewish response.

1987
02:05:03,152 --> 02:05:04,141
It's the what?

1988
02:05:04,286 --> 02:05:05,275
It's the Jewish response.

1989
02:05:05,354 --> 02:05:08,084
You don't like what I am saying
or what I do, so you...

1990
02:05:08,157 --> 02:05:10,318
- Oh, my God!
- That's my Jewish response.

1991
02:05:10,392 --> 02:05:13,088
RAMON: That's all right. It's all right.

1992
02:05:14,663 --> 02:05:15,925
It's all right. That's all right.

1993
02:05:17,533 --> 02:05:19,831
It's a perfect little encapsule.

1994
02:05:21,503 --> 02:05:23,300
It's the Jewish response.

1995

<i>RAMON: Joan, I won't defend myself.</i>

1996
02:05:32,715 --> 02:05:34,182
All what I meant was

1997
02:05:34,250 --> 02:05:37,117
that was the typical response
you will get from someone

1998
02:05:37,219 --> 02:05:39,881
who will take that position
that woman was taking.

1999

If I would have said the word "Israeli"
instead of the word "Jewish,"

that you think that,

I am very pleased
to be able to inform you all

2126
02:13:29,257 --> 02:13:32,454
that I had a long meeting with the lawyer
from the bus company

2127
02:13:32,594 --> 02:13:36,052
and they have agreed to settle for $350,000.

<i>ABIGAIL: What? Fantastic!

Could we just listen to what

I know there was a concern

<i>ABIGAIL: We're sorry.
ROB: Sorry.</i>

2147
02:14:15,570 --> 02:14:19,370
I want to tell you that
I think it's a very good offer.

2148
02:14:19,741 --> 02:14:21,208
I think they're very anxious to settle.

2149
02:14:21,610 --> 02:14:23,976
But I also do think that at this moment,

2150
02:14:24,045 --> 02:14:27,674
they are under the maximum amount of
pressure that we can really bring to bear,

2151
02:14:27,816 --> 02:14:29,647
and I don't believe
they're gonna come up any higher.

<i>ABIGAIL: Hey, $350,000,

<i>Was that everybody? Okay.</i>

2156
02:14:39,094 --> 02:14:40,618
<i>Emily? What do you think?</i>

2157
02:14:40,796 --> 02:14:42,764
I think it sounds like we should do it.

02:14:42,898 --> 02:14:44,525
<i>- But I'd like to be...
- Okay. If that's the vote.</i>

2159
02:14:44,599 --> 02:14:47,932
<i>ROB: Unless you think there's something
to be gained from holding out for more.</i>

2160
02:14:48,036 --> 02:14:49,264
I think that would be a big mistake.

2161
02:14:49,838 --> 02:14:51,066
<i>ABIGAIL: Robbie, what do you think?</i>

2162

<i>- Sold!
- ROB: Sold!</i>

2163
02:14:55,777 --> 02:14:56,766
Okay.

2164
02:14:57,446 --> 02:15:00,381
Now, the only downside to this
as it stands,

2165
02:15:01,583 --> 02:15:04,074
and I know this may be a serious wrinkle
for all of you,

2166
02:15:04,653 --> 02:15:09,420
is that the bus company will absolutely
not discuss the removal of the driver.

2167
02:15:09,624 --> 02:15:10,818
- What?
- What do you mean?

2168
02:15:10,892 --> 02:15:12,723
<i>- ROB: The driver?
- Then tell them to forget it.</i>

2169
02:15:12,794 --> 02:15:14,785
What do you mean? They won't discuss
the removal of the driver?

2170
02:15:14,863 --> 02:15:17,855
<i>- Ladies. Let me finish what I was saying.
- ABIGAIL: It's just a blast in our ears.</i>

2171
02:15:17,933 --> 02:15:20,231
- Let him finish.
- Finish what? Forget it!

2172
02:15:20,602 --> 02:15:25,335
Thank you. Lisa, I want you to understand,
I pressed them very, very hard on this,

2173
02:15:25,674 --> 02:15:28,643
but they will not discuss
disciplining a company employee

2174
02:15:28,710 --> 02:15:29,836
as part of the settlement

2175
02:15:29,911 --> 02:15:33,176
because it could be seen as an admission
of guilt on the part of the MTA.

2176
02:15:33,381 --> 02:15:35,212
What does giving us $300,000 mean?

2177
02:15:35,350 --> 02:15:37,614
Settling out of court does not imply
an admission of guilt.

2178
02:15:37,686 --> 02:15:39,551
It simply does not carry the same stigma.

2179
02:15:39,788 --> 02:15:42,154
On top of that, you may not know, Lisa,

2180
02:15:42,224 --> 02:15:44,818
that they're currently involved
in a very tricky labor dispute right now.

2181
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:47,785
Yeah, we know about that!
Just tell them to forget it.

2182
02:15:48,096 --> 02:15:50,257
- I know that's your reaction...
- It's the only reason we're here.

2183
02:15:50,365 --> 02:15:53,357
<i>- ROB: Can I jump in here? Russel?
- It's really not your decision.</i>

2184
02:15:53,502 --> 02:15:54,730
<i>- It's Emily's decision.

2185
02:15:54,803 --> 02:15:55,827

2186
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:57,201

2187
02:15:57,272 --> 02:15:59,433
- EMILY: No!
- It's Abigail's decision,

2188
02:15:59,941 --> 02:16:01,499
because she's the next of kin.

2189
02:16:01,643 --> 02:16:03,235
But she didn't even know about it!

2190
02:16:03,311 --> 02:16:04,300
That doesn't matter.

2191
02:16:04,379 --> 02:16:06,370
<i>ABIGAIL: Could we get back
in this conversation, please?</i>

02:16:06,448 --> 02:16:07,506
Yes. I'm sorry.

2193
02:16:08,116 --> 02:16:10,846
Obviously there's some strong emotions
going either way here.

2194
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:13,144
<i>Listen, Emily?
I don't know what you're thinking,</i>

2195
02:16:13,221 --> 02:16:16,622
<i>but Rob and I are thinking we should take
Russel's recommendation while we can.</i>

2196
02:16:16,691 --> 02:16:19,285
<i>Because if they won't fire the guy,
they're not gonna fire him.</i>

2197
02:16:19,361 --> 02:16:21,420
<i>- And six months or a year from now...

02:16:21,496 --> 02:16:22,690
<i>ABIGAIL: We're gonna be in a situation</i>

2199

<i>where we're begging them
for half this much...</i>

2200
02:16:24,232 --> 02:16:25,995
The entire point of the lawsuit

2201
02:16:26,067 --> 02:16:28,627
was to get the guy fired
so he doesn't kill somebody else.

2202
02:16:28,703 --> 02:16:31,171
It was not to get you $350,000

2203
02:16:31,239 --> 02:16:34,231
you didn't know you were entitled to
for somebody you didn't even like!

2204
02:16:34,342 --> 02:16:36,139
And the only reason you're getting
the money at all

2205
02:16:36,211 --> 02:16:38,771
is because I started this whole
fucking thing in motion!

2206
02:16:38,847 --> 02:16:40,075
I'm sorry for swearing,

2207
02:16:40,248 --> 02:16:42,148
but you should be willing to trade in all
the money

2208
02:16:42,250 --> 02:16:44,582
- for getting this guy off the street!
- For getting him, Abigail!

2209
02:16:44,653 --> 02:16:46,712

I take that responsibility very seriously.</i>

I'm the one who killed her,

And that guy has no idea!

2219

He is wandering around
blaming everybody else.

2220
02:17:12,781 --> 02:17:17,047
All I want is for somebody to let him know
that what he did was wrong.

and all you want is the money,

2222

and the police won't do anything,
then how is he gonna know he's wrong?

You can't take the deal, Abigail!

2224

It wasn't to get you any money,

No. I didn't know that.

Yes.

And have you told the father, honey?

No. There's a couple of people it could be.

02:19:24,079 --> 02:19:25,103
Please don't tell anyone.

2257
02:19:25,180 --> 02:19:26,807
BONNIE:
We're not gonna tell anyone.

2258
02:19:26,881 --> 02:19:29,577
But you're gonna have to tell
whoever it could be.

2259
02:19:29,651 --> 02:19:31,016
It's okay, I...

2260
02:19:31,753 --> 02:19:33,550
I gotta go.

2261
02:19:34,556 --> 02:19:37,650
It doesn't matter about the father
because the whole thing was my fault.

2262
02:19:39,461 --> 02:19:40,621
I'm sorry.

2263
02:19:44,933 --> 02:19:46,764
What was that?

2264
02:19:50,739 --> 02:19:53,037
- Mom's looking for you.
- What for?

2265
02:19:53,408 --> 02:19:54,773
She thinks you're going out
with her tonight.

2266
02:19:54,843 --> 02:19:55,935
Where are we going?

2267
02:19:56,211 --> 02:19:57,269
I don't know.

2268
02:20:04,419 --> 02:20:06,284
- (CAR HONKING)
- Don't get run over.

2269
02:20:07,689 --> 02:20:09,054
- Wait.
- What?

2270
02:20:12,093 --> 02:20:13,856
I want to see if that's him.

2271
02:20:25,774 --> 02:20:27,742
It's him, Mom. That's the one.

2272
02:20:54,068 --> 02:20:55,057
Hey.

2273
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:01,336
Well, so far it's not the greatest opera
I ever heard.

2274
02:21:01,643 --> 02:21:03,167
What do you mean? It's okay.
