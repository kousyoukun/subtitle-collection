1
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,192
- Hang on. We're coming to a bend. - You're going too fast.

2
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,796
What's this old iron doing here? I'll give you ten bob for it.

3
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,273
Don't be daft. This was once a great car. It won the Grand Prix three years running.

4
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,749
So it's a car, is it?

5
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,149
- Certainly it's a car. - A racing car.

6
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,674
- And we're winning. - You're in the way.

7
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,231
You're in the way for a belt around the ear if I have any more of your lip.

8
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,278
All right. I'll give you 15 bob for it.

9
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,430
Make it 30 and she's yours.

10
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,239
Mr Coggins, you're not going to sell her.

11
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,518
Course he is. You think he's running a children's playground?

12
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,398
All right, 30 bob. I'll pick her up Wednesday.

13
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,278
But you promised we could play in her.

14
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,434
I'm sorry, but she ain't any use to me. Times are hard.

15
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,718
- But you can't take her away. - She's not any old car. She's ours.

16
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,509
Not any more she ain't. I'll see you tomorrow, Bill.

17
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,628
- What are you going to do with her? - We'll put her in the clapper.

18
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,110
Crunch her up till she's one solid piece of metal.

19
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,876
Then we're gonna put her in the furnace, melt her down till she's liquid iron.

20
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,871
That's what we're gonna do.

21
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,073
Look what you've done. You've frightened her.

22
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,958
- She shivered. - See? She's a very special car.

23
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,237
If you put her in the furnace, you'll be guilty of murder.

24
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,518
And if you don't get out of it, I'll be guilty of two more murders.

25
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,231
You can't sell our lovely car to that nasty man.

26
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,313
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I already have.

27
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,392
I know. Daddy will buy it for us, won't he, Jemima?

28
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,799
Of course.

29
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,350
Promise you won't let it go until we come back.

30
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,069
30 shillings, mind, not a penny less.

31
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,116
- Please promise. - Please.

32
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,590
- All right, I promise. - Come on, Jemima.

33
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,194
That's a clever thing to do.

34
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,750
- We're very sorry, miss. - I'm sure you are.

35
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,390
Just look at my car. And look at the mess I'm in, too.

36
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,156
- Oh, no. I think you're beautiful. - And I like your car.

37
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,992
Hmm.

38
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,117
You shouldn't be rushing across the road.

39
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,478
You might have been killed. Anyway, why aren't you in school?

40
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,109
- It isn't a holiday, is it? - No, miss.

41
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,433
- Do you live around here? - Just down the road.

42
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,830
Get into my car. I'm taking you home.

43
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,951
Just wait till Daddy hears we've been for a ride in a motor car.

44
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,990
- What's your name? - I'm Jemima.

45
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,150
- And I'm Jeremy. - What's yours?

46
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,277
- Truly. - That's a very pretty name.

47
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,590
Now, where is your house?

48
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,195
- We don't live in a house. - We live in a castle on top of a hill.

49
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,068
I didn't know there were any castles around here.

50
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,435
It isn't a castle exactly.

51
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,548
Daddy calls it that. He says King Alfred used to live there a long time ago.

52
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,154
And does your daddy know you aren't in school?

53
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,356
He won't mind.

54
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,431
He's awfully busy.

55
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,513
Is he? Well, he'll have to find time to see me.

56
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,239
I have a few things to say to him.

57
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,312
Edison! Here, boy.

58
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,197
Good boy.

59
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,679
That's Daddy over there.

60
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,917
- Hello! - Hello. You're just in time.

61
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,555
- What is he up to? - That's his latest invention.

62
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,631
- Rockets. - Rockets?

63
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,552
Stand back. Keep clear.

64
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,718
Hurray!

65
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,834
- Does he know what he's doing? - Of course he does.

66
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,433
Whoa!

67
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,152
That's not funny. Somebody should do something.

68
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,909
Hold on.

69
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,671
Wait there.

70
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,239
- Thank you. - You might have gone up in flames.

71
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,677
Madam, I took that into consideration. This suit is flameproof.

72
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,435
- Oh, dear. - You have ruined my propulsion unit.

73
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,717
- How was I to know... - Don't be cross with the lady.

74
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,633
- She gave us a ride. - She was only trying to help.

75
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,950
- How very kind. - Her name's Truly.

76
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,032
Do you realise I nearly knocked down your children?

77
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,509
We do seem to be accident-prone, don't we?

78
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,034
It wasn't my fault. They came rushing...

79
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,998
It was very nice of you to apologise. Tea time, children.

80
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,150
- Goodbye. - Thanks for the ride.

81
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,437
Don't you have something to tell your father?

82
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,876
Yes, we have. Mr Coggins promised us...

83
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,115
She doesn't mean about that. Daddy, we didn't go to school today.

84
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,553
Oh-ho.

85
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,599
It'll give the other children a chance to catch up, won't it?

86
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,671
- Bye. - Bye, Truly.

87
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,157
- But, Mr Potts... - Good day.

88
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,232
Unstable. Definitely unstable.

89
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,311
Hey, hey!

90
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,114
Good afternoon, miss. Sorry I can't stop.

91
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,955
I'm off to India to have tea with the maharajah. Cheerio.

92
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,991
Mr Potts.

93
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,477
Mr Potts?

94
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,233
I'm sorry to persist about this.

95
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,359
Perhaps you aren't aware your children were running about in the road.

96
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,112
It's not a playground...

97
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,873
Would you mind pressing that switch there?

98
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,394
Just behind you. On the right.

99
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,471
The right?

100
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,235
Thank you.

101
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,914
You ought to exercise more control over them.

102
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,195
I suppose I could chain them up.

103
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,192
On a long chain, so they get plenty of exercise.

104
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,714
Don't your children go to school?

105
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,031
- I have it now, you're the truant officer. - No, I'm not.

106
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,429
Didn't you ever play truant?

107
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,718
- I most certainly did not. - I bet you didn't.

108
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,992
Would it be too much to ask what this is? This... thing?

109
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,958
An invention of mine. Cleans carpets by suction.

110
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,110
All that to clean carpets?

111
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,876
Away with sweeping and brushing and dirty carpets.

112
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,671
Is that all you do? Invent things?

113
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,115
- Is that all I do? - What's this gadget?

114
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,150
That's not quite right yet, but I hope to transmit moving pictures by wireless.

115
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,231
- Really? - Yes, really. As Marconi...

116
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,639
And this?

117
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,508
This is a sweet-making machine.

118
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,789
- Is this one of the sweets? - Yes, it is.

119
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,519
Is it supposed to have holes in it?

120
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,239
No. Actually, I think the problem...

121
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,595
The boiling point of your sugar is too high.

122
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,955
An expert on sweet-making, are we?

123
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,715
- And an expert on child welfare. - I was only trying to help.

124
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,078
Maybe my children like running wild. Did that ever occur to you?

125
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,039
And how my children behave is frankly no concern of yours.

126
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,194
So take off in your fancy automobile and go do good somewhere else.

127
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,633
I've never been...

128
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,757
Spoken to that way before? Maybe it's about time.

129
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,035
Good afternoon, madam.

130
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,190
Mind the cable!

131
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,109
Officious, interfering...

132
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,630
If women want to drive motor cars, they should learn to operate one.

133
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,236
I suppose it wouldn't occur to you to offer to help me.

134
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,109
Get in the car, please.

135
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,033
For a mechanically-minded man...

136
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,918
- Try switching it on! - Oh.

137
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,759
Hmph!

138
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,710
Open the throttle.

139
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,394
And keep it open.

140
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,079
Women!

141
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,750
Confounded woman. Who does she think she is?

142
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,719
Coming in here and telling me how to raise my children.

143
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,554
Do I need somebody to tell me how to raise my children?

144
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,632
Of course not.

145
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,433
- Where's my cardigan? - Under your jacket.

146
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,511
Under... Yes.

147
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,398
Self-righteous busybody.

148
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,438
- She won't be bothering us again. - But I liked her.

149
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,353
So did I. She was very pretty.

150
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,510
She certainly was.

151
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,833
Do you think your father's a crackpot?

152
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,673
Your cardigan's inside out.

153
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,036
Do you think I'm wasting my time on silly inventions?

154
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,190
But they're wonderful.

155
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,671
- Nobody else could think of them. - That's right.

156
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,832
Nobody else could think of them.

157
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,310
After all, what makes the battle worth the fighting?

158
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,595
What makes the mountain worth the climb?

159
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,399
What makes the questions worth the asking?

160
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,597
The reason worth the rhyme?

161
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,630
## To me the answer's clear

162
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,474
## It's having someone near

163
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,755
## Someone dear

164
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,352
## Someone to care for, to be there for

165
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,432
## I have you two

166
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,593
## Someone to do for, muddle through for

167
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,558
## I have you two

168
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,474
## Someone to share joy or despair with

169
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,597
## Whichever betides you

170
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,070
## Life becomes a chore

171
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,675
## Unless you're living for

172
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,912
## Someone to tend to, be a friend to

173
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,833
## I have you two

174
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,833
## Someone to strive for, do or die for

175
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,549
## I have you two

176
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,988
## Could be we three get along so famously

177
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,755
## Cos you two have me

178
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,236
## And I have you two, too

179
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,479
Hurray!

180
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,835
Atchoo!

181
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,475
## Someone to care for, to be there for

182
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,030
## I have you two

183
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,999
## Someone to do for, muddle through for

184
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,197
## I have you two

185
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,398
## Someone to smile once in a while with

186
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,711
## Whenever you're lonesome

187
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,917
## I've a happy lot

188
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,276
## Considering what I've got

189
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,196
## But I couldn't do more than you do for your poor father

190
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,998
Daddy!

191
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,997
## Things go asunder and I wonder why you bother

192
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,478
## Could be we three get along so famously cos

193
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,677
## We two have you

194
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:19,872
## And I have you two... too

195
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,710
Jeremy.

196
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,629
Oh, good!

197
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,511
Do I smell food?

198
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,114
Bring the bread, will you, Grandpa?

199
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,636
- And the pepper and salt, please. - Right away, sir.

200
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,757
Oh! Sausage and egg, my favourite.

201
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,592
How was India?

202
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,037
I got up this morning and I shot an elephant in my pyjamas.

203
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,157
"How he got into my pyjamas I shall never know."

204
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,118
You've heard it before.

205
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,839
- I wonder how that happened. - Daddy, could we ask you something?

206
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,232
- It's about Mr Coggins. - The junkman wanted to take it away.

207
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,515
But Mr Coggins says if we asked you...

208
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,637
- Ask me what? - He's a horrid, mean, old man.

209
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,711
- Mr Coggins? - The junkman.

210
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,274
He'll take it and burn it.

211
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,112
What are you going on about?

212
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,509
- Our car. - What about it?

213
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,068
Mr Coggins is selling it to the junkman.

214
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,391
And the junkman's going to put it in the furnace

215
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,995
and skwodge it all up till there's nothing left.

216
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,959
That's terrible. We can't let that happen, Grandpa.

217
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,638
No, definitely no.

218
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,989
- We knew you wouldn't let him. - So we can have it for 30 shillings.

219
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,512
- 30 shillings? - You can pay him tomorrow.

220
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,994
Yes, well, I suppose we can work something out.

221
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,036
- Good! - Hurray!

222
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,680
- Are you all finished? - Yes, Daddy.

223
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,354
I think you should go run up to bed.

224
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,396
- Goodnight, Grandpa. - Goodnight, my boy.

225
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,277
- Goodnight, Grandpa. - Goodnight, my darling.

226
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,318
- Goodnight, Daddy. - Goodnight.

227
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,276
You've done it now, haven't you?

228
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,590
You think Coggins might do a deal?

229
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,114
Him down the road? Sure.

230
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,352
He's so mean he wouldn't light your pipe if his house was on fire.

231
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,832
Did you hear that? You know what that means?

232
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,388
I'll be up all night, rain pouring in.

233
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,836
Why don't you sleep in the workshop?

234
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,674
In the workshop? You promised to fix my bedroom roof.

235
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,390
- I will. It's just... - Caractacus, my boy. Listen...

236
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,471
It's time you woke up.

237
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,269
- At your age, I did a day's work... - For a day's pay, polishing boots.

238
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,430
I was the smartest batman in the army.

239
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,150
When my brigadier went into action, the natives were so blinded by his boots,

240
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,789
they couldn't see to fight.

241
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,750
Catch me death of cold. He don't care.

242
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,877
Nobody cares. Me own son.

243
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,671
She was right. Who wants sweets with holes in them?

244
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,112
Edison, stop that whistling.

245
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,591
Edison, do that again.

246
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,391
Edison, you're a genius.

247
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,273
The employment office is in the rear.

248
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,552
You see, I've invented these sweets.

249
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,438
Really? Name?

250
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,557
- Whistling sweets. - Mr Whistling Sweets.

251
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,438
Mr Whistling Sweets!

252
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,478
No. I'm Potts.

253
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,516
May I see the managing director?

254
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,319
Lord Scrumptious sees no one without an appointment.

255
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,356
- How do I get one? - Hello, children.

256
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,034
- Jeremy, it's Truly. - Hello, Truly.

257
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,395
Miss Scrumptious, how nice to see you.

258
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,552
Good morning, Phillips. Please tell my father I'm here.

259
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,154
Of course, Miss Scrumptious.

260
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,791
- Are you here on business? - Yes, Miss...

261
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,714
Father? Truly Scrumptious?

262
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,314
- You're his... - Daughter.

263
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,309
Let's go.

264
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,473
- You haven't shown your invention. - I don't think that'll do much good.

265
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,358
Just a moment. Exactly what was it...

266
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,908
- You've seen them. - Oh, those.

267
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,434
- But they whistle. - Whistle?

268
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,876
- Those holes. - You just blow through them.

269
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,911
They're very ingenious.

270
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,831
Kind of a novelty.

271
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,035
Sssh!

272
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,908
Please go in, Miss Scrumptious. You can come back in three weeks.

273
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,878
- Show Mr Potts in. - Now?

274
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,952
- But His Lordship... - Now.

275
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,190
Please follow me.

276
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,158
Maybe I should come back in three weeks.

277
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,231
Go on, Daddy.

278
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,149
And don't let him bully you.

279
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,879
- Mr Potts, my lord. - Who's he?

280
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,396
- Where's me daughter? - She insisted on Mr Potts seeing you.

281
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,438
Don't just stand there. What's it all about?

282
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,751
- Sweets, sir. - I hardly thought it was nuts and bolts.

283
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,115
Let's have a look.

284
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,709
- Hurry up. - Yes, sir.

285
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,271
- If I may explain... - You have exactly 20 seconds.

286
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,434
The fundamental novelty of the sweets is their musical quality.

287
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,072
Not only are they very tasty but due to the unique positioning of these holes,

288
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,188
when blown through, they render a tuneful whistle.

289
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,635
Put your fingers over the holes and blow thus.

290
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,359
Tasting time, my lord.

291
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,956
Too late. Had your chance. Muffed it. Good morning.

292
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,514
Follow him.

293
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,350
My lord?

294
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,879
Excuse me. Sir, if I may be allowed to demonstrate.

295
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,270
By blowing air through this hole, you get a wonderful...

296
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,033
- Raspberry? - No. It's more like a toot really.

297
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,793
Not enough fruit, too much sugar.

298
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,509
- Would you care to try it, sir? - Under no circumstances.

299
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,591
He's not doing very well, is he?

300
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,468
Another remarkable feature is that by sucking...

301
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,916
Throw it away. And get rid of this idiot for me.

302
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,353
Oi, you. Hop it!

303
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,317
They also come in strawberry, raspberry...

304
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,791
- Are you still here? ...and pineapple.

305
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,111
Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker.

306
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,192
And don't try toffee or cream.

307
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,669
If you seek perfection in sugar confection,

308
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,558
well, there's something new on the scene.

309
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,076
A mouthful of cheer, a sweet without peer.

310
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,358
## A musical morsel supreme

311
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,117
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

312
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,749
## The candies you whistle, the whistles you eat

313
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,798
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

314
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,589
## The eatable, tweetable treats

315
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,478
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

316
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,235
## The toot of a flute with the flavour of fruit

317
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,198
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

318
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,875
## No longer need candy be mute

319
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,838
## Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker

320
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,151
## And don't try a toffee or cream

321
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,391
## If you seek perfection in sugar confection

322
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,677
## Well, there's something new on the scene

323
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,512
## That mouthful of cheer

324
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,477
## That sweet without peer

325
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,633
## That musical morsel supreme

326
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,872
## Toot sweets

327
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,475
## A bonbon to blow on at last has been found

328
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,552
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

329
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,474
## With tweetable, eatable sound

330
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,471
No, take it away.

331
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,471
Father.

332
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,551
Please.

333
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,351
He likes it.

334
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,715
- ## Their value is intrinsic - ## Surpass any mint stick

335
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,236
## Or marshmallow mouthful you munch

336
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,392
- ## Though liquorice is chewy - ## And gumdrops are gooey

337
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,314
## And chocolate is charming to crunch

338
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,995
- ## That savoury fife - ## That sweet of your life

339
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,471
## It's clearly the best of the bunch

340
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,077
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

341
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,831
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

342
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,390
## That savoury fife

343
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,275
## That sweet of your life

344
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,869
## It's clearly the best of the bunch

345
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,750
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

346
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,391
## A bonbon to blow on at last has been found

347
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,950
## Toot sweets, toot sweets

348
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,235
## The treat that's so tweetable

349
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,311
## Lusciously eatable

350
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,915
## With that unbeatable

351
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,392
## Sound

352
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,669
Go away. You'll contaminate the confectionery.

353
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,189
What's going on? Get them out of here.

354
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,830
Edison, no!

355
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,398
Children!

356
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,268
It's your fault. I'll send for the police and the fire brigade.

357
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,754
Daddy?

358
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,400
Why aren't you two asleep?

359
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,029
Don't be sad, Daddy. It wasn't your fault.

360
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,112
It was all those mean old dogs.

361
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,355
Children...

362
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,431
About the car.

363
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,829
You see,

364
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,595
30 shillings is pretty hard to come by.

365
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,310
And when I do get any money, I need it for my inventions.

366
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,395
- There isn't any left. - Jeremy and I have been thinking.

367
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,473
- It's our treasure chest. - These things are enormously valuable.

368
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,712
Look. An ivory tusk. That must be worth a fortune.

369
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,916
And diamonds.

370
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,595
- And a golden crown. - It's probably King Alfred's.

371
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,118
It needs cleaning up a little. Take them. You can sell them.

372
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,320
Never mind about the car. You can spend it all on your inventions.

373
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,675
Thank you, children.

374
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,433
All these wonderful things.

375
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,595
They're very precious. But I'm afraid other people wouldn't appreciate them.

376
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,238
Why not?

377
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,278
Cos other people don't see things the way you do.

378
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,113
Let's go to bed.

379
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,519
And don't you worry. Things will come right somehow.

380
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,229
## A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain

381
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,634
## Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay

382
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:44,113
## It fills the sails of boats that are waiting

383
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:51,436
## Waiting to sail your worries away

384
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:05,030
## It isn't far to Hushabye Mountain

385
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:12,151
## And your boat waits down by the quay

386
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,952
## The winds of night so softly are sighing

387
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,355
## Soon they will fly your troubles to sea

388
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:35,833
## So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain

389
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,473
## Wave goodbye to cares of the day

390
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,989
## And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain

391
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:58,760
## Sail far away from Lullaby Bay

392
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,952
All the lovely colours. Get your balloons here.

393
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,392
Hurry along now. These lovely toffee apples a ha'penny each.

394
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,153
Any more for any more?

395
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,950
Which one of you ladies and gentlemen would like an automatic haircut?

396
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,679
I've stood in this marketplace for 25 years.

397
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,352
I do not profess to make dead men talk.

398
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,637
Hey, now, here you go there. Who's for an automatic haircut?

399
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,517
Only threepence a time.

400
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,229
You may have long, short or straight hair,

401
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,757
it makes no difference to the automatic hair-cutting machine.

402
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,869
Here, Cyril. You could do with an haircut.

403
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,269
Cut me hair? That's where me strength is.

404
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,636
Sir, you look like a man who could do with a haircut.

405
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,278
Go on, Cyril.

406
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,112
- Come on, sit down. - Hold that, then.

407
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,794
You have a lot of hair. Would you like an estimate?

408
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,474
Very funny. Get on with it.

409
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,348
Just sit tight, while I lower this hair-cutting machine.

410
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,715
We'll have you finished in a minute.

411
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,352
- I feel a right nana sitting here. - You look lovely. It will be smashing.

412
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,750
- You keep you eyes on that geezer. - Yeah, all right.

413
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,310
- What's goin' on? - It's all right.

414
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,710
Nothing to worry about. A little friction to start.

415
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,399
- It tickles. - You always say that.

416
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,712
Oh! Oh! Cyril!

417
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,633
- You're smoking. - I'm on fire.

418
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,231
Stop it!

419
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,473
- Excuse me. - Me head's on fire.

420
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,869
It's all right, sir.

421
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,679
What you done? Give me a mirror.

422
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,150
A mirror? I'll go home and get you one.

423
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,755
Look at me hair.

424
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,435
- Where is he? I'll kill him. - There he is, mister.

425
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,118
I'll smash your teeth down your throat.

426
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,995
There he goes, down there.

427
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,073
Come on. You're too fat to catch him, are you?

428
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,596
Oi, big bonce.

429
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,671
Get out of it!

430
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,989
There he is. Get out me way!

431
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,510
Oi!

432
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,073
- Hurry up. We're on. - Get out the way.

433
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,915
## A gentleman's got a walking stick, a seaman's got a gaff

434
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,310
## And the merry men of Robin Hood they used a quarterstaff

435
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,756
## On the Spanish plains inside their canes they hide their ruddy swords

436
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,037
## But we make do with an old bamboo and everyone applauds

437
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,751
## One, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight

438
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,558
## Me ol' bamboo, me ol' bamboo

439
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,039
## You better never bother with me ol' bamboo

440
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,838
## You can have me hat or me bumbershoot

441
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,559
## But you better never bother with me ol' bamboo

442
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,430
- ## When punting on the beautiful Thames - ## You use a sturdy pole

443
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,910
- ## To protect their fair complexion - ## Ladies use a parasol

444
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,515
- ## It's useful in the underbrush - ## To have a hefty spear

445
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,036
## Right, but what we do with an old bamboo makes everybody cheer

446
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,758
## One, two, three, ho!

447
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,114
## Me ol' bamboo, me ol' bamboo

448
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,918
## You better never bother with me ol' bamboo

449
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,638
## You can have me hat or me bumbershoot

450
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,915
## But you better never bother with me ol' bamboo

451
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,759
Have a go, mate.

452
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,230
- ## A flier in an aerial plane - ## He steers it with a stick

453
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,835
- ## A collier in the pits of Wales - ## He leans upon his pick

454
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,230
## Now every wheel of an automobile revolves around the shaft

455
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,153
## But what we do with an old bamboo makes everyone go daft

456
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,355
## And, one, two

457
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,112
## Me ol' bamboo, me ol' bamboo.

458
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,633
## You better never bother with me ol' bamboo

459
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,597
## You can have me hat or me bumbershoot

460

## But you better never bother with me ol' bamboo

461
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,118
## One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

462
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,713
## And a one, two, three, four

463
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,313
## And five, and six, and seven

464
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,197
## Oh, me ol' bamboo, me ol' bamboo

465
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,918
## You better never bother with me ol' bamboo

466
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,513
## You can have me hat or me bumbershoot

## But you better never bother with me ol' bamboo

468
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,872
You better never bother with me ol' bamboo!

469
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,319
- Thank you. - Here.

470
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,800
- Thank you very much. - And thank you.

471
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,040
It's Daddy. He's got the car.

472
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,838
I got it.

473
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,078
He's got the car!

474
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,513
Come on.

475
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,679
Hello!

476
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,078
What do you think of this? Isn't she a beauty?

477
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,469
That's a nice pile of junk, my boy.

478
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,394
It needs a little work, but there's a fine engine under here.

479
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,632
- It doesn't go, though, does it? - Not yet, but it will.

480
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,870
You can make it go, can't you?

481
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,077
We're gonna give it a try. Put a hand to the wheel.

482
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,991
George, give us a hand here.

483
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,119
- OK, heave! - We're off! Hurray!

484
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,998
Comfortable, Grandpa?

485
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,430
It won't work, of course. Another catastrophe.

486
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,988
- Left hand down. - Come on, Grandpa, push.

487
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,953
Watch it, Jeremy. Mind the bicycle.

488
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,429
Ah, good. Keep coming. That's it.

489
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,311
Watch out, Edison. Keep coming.

490
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,514
- All right, governor? - Many thanks, George.

491
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,955
- Now... - Can we stay and watch?

492
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,919
We'd better go. You know what your dad's like when he's working.

493
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,437
- But we wanted to stay and watch. - I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

494
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,158
Don't overdo it, my boy.

495
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,437
- Right. - You might exhaust yourself.

496
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,551
Come on!

497
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,551
"And the big brown bear came lolloping over the mountain."

498
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,632
"No, the princess cried..."

499
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,957
"And the big brown bear came lolloping over the mountain."

500
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,791
It's awfully quiet in there.

501
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,917
- Breakfast is ready. - He's been there for days!

502
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,956
Come and have your breakfast.

503
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,349
Daddy said the car would be finished today.

504
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,639
You'll be waiting a month of Sundays before he's finished that. Come on.

505
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,829
- That's Daddy! - He's finished the car!

506
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,870
- Gosh! - Oh!

507
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,473
What do you think?

508
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,439
She's the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my life.

509
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,910
It's wonderful. Daddy, you're so clever.

510
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,070
- Can we go for a drive? - A drive?

511
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,233
I have a better idea. How about a picnic?

512
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,278
Let's get cracking. You get the basket.

513
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,316
Get in, Jemima.

514
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,630
Mind the woodwork.

515
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,871
- Don't touch the horn. - Here's the basket.

516
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,669
Put it on the back. Don't touch that.

517
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,238
Grandpa, come on. We're going on a picnic.

518
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,950
It'll never go, my dears. Not if he's had anything to do with it.

519
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,235
But it is going.

520
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,914
Then it'll never stop. Anyway, it's far too hot.

521
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,991
- Where are you going? - Me?

522
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,435
I'm off to Alaska, me boy. Cheerio.

523
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,875
Goodbye, Grandpa. Come on, Daddy.

524
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,550
- We're off. - We're off!

525
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,269
Sit down, Jemima. Are you ready?

526
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,954
- Yes! - Here we go.

527
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,508
Mind your back, Grandpa.

528
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,591
Bye, Grandpa.

529
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,155
Nasty, smelly things, motor cars.

530
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,039
- What a funny noise it's making. - It's talking to us.

531
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,395
- All engines talk. - What's it saying?

532
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,833
It's saying...

533
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,070
Chitty chitty, chitty chitty, chitty chitty, chitty chitty, chitty chitty, chitty chitty.

534
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,189
Bang, bang. Chitty chitty bang bang.

535
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,590
Chitty chitty bang bang. Chitty chitty bang bang, chitty chitty bang bang.

00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,188
## You'll turn everybody's head today

557
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,396

572
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,915
- Daddy! - Look out!

573
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,795
A slight squeeze on the hooter is an excellent safety precaution.

574
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,555
Never mind about that. How am I supposed to get out of here?

575
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,197
Well...

576
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,113
Looks to me as if you'll have to walk or swim.

577
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,113
In this dress? Don't be ridiculous.

578
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,357
- Come on. - What are you doing?

579
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,352
- I'm gonna carry you. - Must you?

580
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,954
Unless you'd rather ride piggyback.

581
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,430
- All right, you may carry me. - Good.

582
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,668
Wait, my handbag.

583
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,911
It's all right.

584
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,676
- Thank you. - Not at all.

585
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,830
- We're going to the seaside. - On a picnic.

586
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,751
- Come with us. - Please.

587
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,229
I'm hardly In the mood for a picnic.

588
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,710
I can have Mr Coggins tow out your car.

589
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,633
- We've got sausage tarts. - And marmalade rolls.

590
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,474
I got it a little mixed up.

591
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,196
What an unusual car.

592
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,430
Daddy made it.

593
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,990
- And it actually goes? - It's called Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

594
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,355
That's a curious name for a motor car.

595
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,876
But that's the sound it makes. Listen.

Truly Scrumptious.

624

## So do lollies in a lollipop jar

632
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,115
## Gingerbread men have a gingerbread sound

633
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,760
## We've found

634
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,275
## Sugar plum, cinnamon and lemon tart

635
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,830
## Tell you what they are right from the start

636
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,234
## And your name does the same for you

637
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,755
## By coincidence, Truly Scrumptious

638
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,628
## You're truly, truly scrumptious

639
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,999
## Scrumptious as a cherry peach parfait

640
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,677
## When you're near us

641
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,992
## It's so delicious

642
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,755
## Honest, Truly

643
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,549
## You're the answer to our wishes

644
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,757
## Truly Scrumptious

645
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:42,072
## Though we may seem presumptuous

646
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,188
## Never, never, ever go away

647
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,555
## Our hearts beat so unruly

648
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,474
## Because we love you truly

649
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,829
Oh...

650
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,431
## Honest, Truly, we do

651
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,316
Daddy!

652
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,479
Boo!

653
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,112
## Truly scrumptious

654
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,273
## You two are truly scrumptious

655
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:49,152
## Scrumptious as the breeze across the bay

656
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,118
## When you're smiling

657
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,193
## It's so delicious

658
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,909
## So beguiling

659
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,788
## You're the answer to my wishes

660
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,997
## Truly scrumptious

661
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,358
## You two are truly scrumptious

662
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:19,039
## And I shan't forget this lovely day

663
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,388
## My heart beats so unruly

664
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,110
## I also love you truly

665
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:39,153
## Honest, truly, I do

666
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,232
- Come on. - Wait for me.

667
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,992
- Mr Potts? - Somebody call?

668
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,597
- I'm sorry. - That's all right.

669
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,071
- What are you doing? - Just tinkering.

670
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,392
You know, Mr Potts, you have two wonderful children.

671
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,632
Why, thank you. I must agree with you there.

672
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,111
Isn't it beautiful?

673
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,192
Lovely. Just lovely.

674
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,080
Jeremy, it's not nice to peek.

675
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,276
I'm not peeking. I'm looking.

676
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,272
- Do you think they like each other? - Of course they do.

677
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,318
- Are they going to get married? - Has he kissed her yet?

678
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,674
Not yet.

679
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,639
Just as soon as he kisses her, then they'll have to get married.

680
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,189
- Jeremy, what are you doing? - Keeping a look-out for pirates.

681
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,748
There aren't any pirates round here, are there?

682
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,229
I'm sure there are. Hundreds of them.

683
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,108
Of course there are. This is where they bury their treasure, isn't it?

684
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,397
- Mm-hm. - Tell us a story about pirates.

685
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,840
A story about pirates?

686
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,911
Let me see.

687
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,468
I can see a boat.

688
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,791
A boat?

689
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,476
Did you say a boat?

690
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,109
- That isn't just any old boat out there. - No?

691
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,239
Zat iz ze private yacht of ze notorious Baron Bomburst.

692
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,958
Baron Bomburst?

693
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,429
You haf never heard of Baron Bomburst?

694
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,308
Ruler of Vulgaria? Ze most evil man in ze world.

695
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,913
- Gosh! - Ja.

696
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,275
Und he has sailed all ze way to England,

697
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,148
because he has heard tell of a fantastic motor car

698
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,516
built by zat brilliant inventor, Caractacus Potts.

699
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,875
- Hurray! - Yes, hurray.

700
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:51,638
Und he has come to steal ze car und take it back to Vulgaria with him.

701
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,275
That car!

702
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,634
I want it. I want it!

703
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,359
- But, Your Excellency... - Are you giving me an argument?

704
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:12,197
Stand by the boats, man the grappling hooks and load the cannon.

705
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,708
- He's awful! - He's terrible!

706
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,792
- He isn't even nice. - He can't steal our lovely car.

707
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,917
- You won't let him, will you? - They're getting closer.

708
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,309
- We've got to get away. - Start the car.

709
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,473
- Quickly, before they get here! - That's easier said than done.

710
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,791
- But why? - I'll tell you.

711
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,236
What none of us have noticed is while we've been sitting here

712
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,790
the tide has been coming in. We're completely cut off.

713
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,516
What are we going to do?

714
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,912
- Do hurry, Mr Potts. - Everyone stay calm.

715
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,512
Look! They are completely cut off by the tide.

716
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,478
They will all drown.

717
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,519
I haven't seen a good drowning in years.

718
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,990
- Can I help? - Push the throttle lever!

719
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,436
- Hurry, Daddy! - Quickly, before they get here.

720
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,717
- Not that one. The other one. - It won't start.

721
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,630
We're gonna have to swim for it. Come on, Jemima.

722
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,554
- We must. Come on, Jeremy. - Everybody over the side.

723
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,472
Everybody hold on.

724
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,833
- This is impossible. - Well, you built it.

725
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,595
- You always said it was a magic car. - I did?

726
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,592
- Look. It's a boat. - I knew Chitty would save us.

727
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,672
Hang on, everybody. We're off.

728
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,116
A floating car?

729
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,236
What do you think of that, Chancellor?

730
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,278
Yabba, a car, floaten on the waterfol.

731
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,992
This in my whole lifelodes, this never could be seen, never.

732
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,595
It's uncategorical.

733
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,071
A fuel-burning oracle.

734
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,957
A fantasmagorical machine!

735
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,032
## It's more than spectacular

736
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,755
## To use the vernacular

737
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,717
- It's wizard! - It's smashing!

738
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,873
## It's keen

739
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,916
## Oh, Chitty, you Chitty, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

740
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,956
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you

741
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,871
## And, Chitty, our Chitty, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

742
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,837
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us, too

743
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,879
## High Chitty, low Chitty, anywhere we go, on Chitty Chitty we depend

744
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,632
## Bang bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

745
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,950
## Our fine four-fendered friend

746
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,110
They're firing at us!

747
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,475
We'll show them something.

748
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,359
Follow that car!

749
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,558
I want that car!

750
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,710
I must have it!

751
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,838
Follow that car!

752
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,429
I want the car! I must have it!

753
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,748
Where are my two spies?

754
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:28,098
Ah, there you are.

755
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,738
Now, then.

756
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,654
I have a secret mission for you.

757
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:37,097
You will go ashore and capture that motor car, understand?

758
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,614
Good. But...

759
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,770
if you fail,

760
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:45,011
I will cut off your heads.

761
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,772
Now!

762
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,016
I want that car.

763
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,617
- Now, then, vere are we? - I haf here a map.

764
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,693
I know where we are, stupid! We are in England.

765
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,248
And ven we are in England, vat do ve do?

766
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,534
We play cricket.

767
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:28,249
No. We dress like Englishmen.

768
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:36,650
Remarkable weather we are having for the time of the year.

769
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,731
Do you not think so, Cuthbort?

770
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:40,936
Indubitabably, Basil.

771
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:51,534
- You know, Mr Potts... - Caractacus.

772
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:55,499
- It's a pretty silly name. - I don't think so.

773
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:58,856
You know, I really owe you an apology.

774
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,012
You're more than just a father to those two children.

775
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:07,094
Nursemaid, private tutor, chief cook and bottle-washer, everything.

776
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:11,612
Except what they really need.

777
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:23,010
- It's been quite a day. - It certainly has.

778
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,933
Thank you, and say goodbye to the children for me.

779
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,658
Yes, I will.

780
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:32,210
- I hope we'll see you again. - I hope so, too.

781
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,291
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

782
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:04,218
## This lovely, lonely man

783
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:10,614
## I've only known a day

784
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:20,655
## I look at him and cannot look away

785
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:25,894
## Oh, what a love

786
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:34,251
## Oh, what a lovely, lonely man

787
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:39,937
## I've met so many men

788
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:45,811
## So easy to forget

789
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:51,850
## I thought I'd grown immune to them

790
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:56,456
## And yet

791
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:01,978
## He's such a love

792
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:08,613
## He's such a lovely, lonely man

793
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,409
## How did he touch my heart?

794
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:17,051
## How did this feeling start?

795
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:25,058
## This glow that feels so warm inside

796
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:32,728
## This sudden summer storm inside

797
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:41,017
## My life now has a plan

798
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:45,855
## To someday make him see

799
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:54,894
## That I need him as much as he needs me

800
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:59,770
## Oh, what a love

801
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:06,413
## Oh, what a lovely, lonely man

802
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:41,175
## My life now has a plan

803
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:46,493
## To someday make him see

804
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:56,455
## That I need him as much as he needs me

805
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:02,615
## Oh, what a love

806
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:13,099
## Oh, what a lovely, lonely man

807
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:19,255
## Oh, how I love

808
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:33,619
## This one and only man

809
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,536
Quickly! Quickly!

810
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,611
Hurry! Hurry!

811
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,051
Come on! Hurry!

812
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:13,611
They're coming!

813
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,172
Get ready!

814
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,534
Fire!

815
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,819
This way!

816
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,732
Stop! Up!

817
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:59,369
Hup!

818
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:13,014
- They're trying to get past. - Fine.

819
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,489
Get over, you halfwit.

820
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:18,413
It's Father, and he's in one of his tempers.

821
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,173
- That'll be a change. - Let him pass.

822
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,137
There isn't room.

823
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:26,018
Get out of the way. Move over, you idiot.

824
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,660
Turn off here.

825
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,134
We got him!

826
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:59,138
You nincompoops! I'll have you sent away for the rest of your lives.

827
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:03,577
I suppose you baboons have some explanation for this outrage.

828
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:07,858
- You stupid fool! - What have I done?

829
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,773
I have an idea.

830
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:26,015
Remember, we are supposed to be English gentlemen.

831
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,775
So, let us try and behave like English gentlemen.

832
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,895
Ja, ja, ja.

833
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:33,050
So, open the door.

834
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,177
"Carac-a-tacatus Potts."

835
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,410
"Inventor."

836
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,168
Typical English eccentric.

837
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,332
That must be the inventor.

838
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:03,531
Pardink me for protruding but have I the pleasure of undressing Herr...

839
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,611
Mr Potts?

840
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:08,019
That's me.

841
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:11,775
What do you want? You selling something?

842
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:14,454
I don't want nothing. Excuse me.

843
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,929
I'm off to Africa.

844
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,370
Africa? Zat was a ruse to put us off ze scent.

845
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:28,419
I know where he has gone. He has gone into his laboratory.

846
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,776
- Quick, the portable wireless transmitter! - Jawohl!

847
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,650
Jawohl.

848
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,254
- This is X speaking. - Schwecks?

849
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,819
- No, X! - Legs?

850
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,937
- X as in... - Eggs and bacon.

851
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,731
Send transport immediately.

852
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:04,009
- They're here! - Quickly!

853
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,051
That way!

854
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,452
Quickly! This way! Quickly!

855
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,770
Get up the ladder! Quickly!

856
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,858
Quickly! Up! Take it up!

857
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,535
Now over here!

858
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,609
Up! Up!

859
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,614
Wait for me.

860
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:48,100
Hello. What's your game, then?

861
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,376
What's going on?

862
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,451
I'm flying.

863
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,498
- Look. - What's that?

864
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:04,048
- It's a big balloon. - A Zeppelin.

865
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,769
- What's that underneath? - That's Grandpa's hut.

866
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:11,091
- But what's it doing up there? - I don't know.

867
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,455
Caractacus, I'm being kidnapped.

868
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,737
What are you doing? You come down here.

869
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:19,539
It's me, your own father.

870
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:22,657
They won't get away with that. Hold tight back there.

871
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:24,776
- Sit down, Jeremy. - Quickly!

872
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:25,895
Hurry, Daddy!

873
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:27,379
Caractacus!

874
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,451
He's getting away!

875
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:36,093
Hold on, Grandpa. We're coming!

876
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,334
Help!

877
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:41,132
Come back, Grandpa.

878
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,175
What do you think you're doing?

879
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:47,570
I'm being abducted by foreigners.

880
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:48,729
Caractacus!

881
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,048
Hey!

882
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:56,535
Where are they going?

883
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:58,497
Look out!

884
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,095
Where are they going?

885
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:23,932
Look out!

886
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:38,893
What's happening?

887
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:41,972
- Look at that. - It's fantastic.

888
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:45,776
You're a genius!

889
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:48,454
It's nothing, really.

890
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,619
- Look! There they are. - Go, Daddy! After them.

891
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,691
We'll catch 'em up.

892
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,414
- We've lost them. - We'll find them.

893
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:15,537
- What about Grandpa? - Don't worry about Grandpa.

894
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:18,009
He can take care of himself.

895
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,497
This is livin', this is style

896
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:25,619
## This is elegance by the mile

897
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,579
## Oh, the posh, posh travelling life, the travelling life for me

898
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:33,448
## First cabin and captain's table, regal company

899
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:37,135
## Whenever I'm bored, I travel abroad, but ever so properly

900
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:43,090
## Port out, starboard home, posh with a capital P-O-S-H, posh

901
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,331
We're losing height.

902
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,935
Jettison ballast.

903
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:55,699
## The hands that hold the sceptres, every head that holds a crown

904
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:59,568
## They'll always give their all for me, they'll never let me down

905
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:03,175
## I'm on my way to far away, ta-ta and toodle-oo

906
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:07,617
## And fare thee well and bon voyage, arrivederci, too

907
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:16,858
## Oh, the posh, posh travelling life, the travelling life for me

908
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:20,455
## First cabin and captain's table, regal company

909
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:23,657
## Pardon the dust of the upper crust

910
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,129
## Fetch us a cup of tea

911
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:32,136
## Port out, starboard home, posh with a capital P-O-S-H, posh

912
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:45,090
## In every foreign strand I land, the royal trumpets toot me

913
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:48,616
## The royal welcome mat is out, they 21-gun salute me

914
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:52,215
## But monarchies are constantly commanding me to call

915
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:55,736
## Last month I missed a mufti, well, you can't oblige 'em all

916
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:59,859
## Oh, the posh, posh travelling life, the travelling life for me

917
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:03,455
## Rompity tompity di-de-di diddly-de-de-de

918
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:05,576
We are still losing height.

919
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:08,015
There must be something else we can throw out.

920
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:12,298
There's nothing else we can throw out.

921
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:25,539
- You just dropped someone. - I can't swim.

922
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,453
Come back!

923
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:34,173
## Oh, the posh, posh travelling life, the travelling life for me

924
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:37,775
## First cabin and captain's table, regal company

925
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:41,170
## When I'm at the helm, the world's my realm

926
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:44,616
## And I do it stylishly

927
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:50,058
## Port out, starboard home, posh with a capital P-O-S-H

928
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:52,051
- Schweinhund! - Schwasser!

929
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:54,096
- What do we do now? - Start swimming.

930
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:57,456
- I don't swim. - Then start drowning!

931
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:01,089
## P-O-S-H, P-O-S-H

932
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:03,248
## Posh!

933
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,931
Hello.

934
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,658
Where are we?

935
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,970
Somewhere over the North Sea, I think.

936
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,449
Don't you know where we're going?

937
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:38,135
I don't, but Chitty does.

938
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:41,212
I think we're in pretty good hands.

939
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:08,896
Good morning. This is your captain speaking.

940
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,493
We hope you had a pleasant trip.

941
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,652
We are about to land in Vulgaria.

942
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:16,015
- Where? - Vulgaria?

943
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,456
Please fasten your seat belts, and no smoking. Thank you.

944
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:22,976
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

945
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,251
Speed, 41/2 knots.

946
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,298
Wind, east-southeast.

947
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,455
Brigade, attention!

948
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:13,499
- We haf a guest. Welcome him. - Jawohl, Your Excellency!

949
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,617
Order arms!

950
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,373
Professor Potts.

951
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:23,451
Please, walk zis way.

952
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,616
Present arms!

953
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:43,818
On behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, I'd like...

954
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,418
Excuse me.

955
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:53,571
You're early.

956
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:12,939
- Down the table and in the pocky. - You cheat.

957
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:17,412
- Professor Potts - Professor?

958
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:21,652
Vulgaria welcomes ze brilliant Professor Potts,

959
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:24,652
inventor extraordinary.

960
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:28,289
Excuse me, sir. There seems to be some sort of mistake.

961
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:32,214
You are not Professor Potts, ze inventor?

962
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,689
Executioner!

963
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,660
What would you like me to invent, sir?

964
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:44,777
I will show you. My horse!

965
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:47,852
Get the horse for His Excellency.

966
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,451
Gee up!

967
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,092
How proud you look on that fine horse.

968
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:19,219
The most beautiful toy you ever bought me, my darling.

969
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:23,771
- But, who is this? - Professor Potts from England.

970
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:27,614
I think we haf a surprise for you. Eh, Professor?

971
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:29,930
- Come on. - Adieu.

972
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:38,656
Vat do you think, Professor? Everything you need.

973
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:44,098
These will be your assistants. And this is the baronial car.

974
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:47,172
Can you make zis car float?

975
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:50,969
Like ampfibial English motee car. Float over the cresty wave of the wart.

976
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,779
It's not that easy without my laboratory.

977
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:56,010
I have already thought of that.

978
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,660
Here is your laboratory.

979
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:04,819
If you succeed in making the car float,

980
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:08,859
I will make you privy counsellor.

981
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:16,134
But if you fail, I will stuff your head wiz sauerkraut and feed it to the dogs.

982
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:20,372
Feedy dorribles, snarly snort horribold.

983
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,337
You haf got 24 hours.

984
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:26,129
24 hours and worky nosey grindstone.

985
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:33,049
Proper card, he is.

986
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:34,971
Odd sense of humour.

987
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:38,052
Stuff me head with sauerkraut.

988
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,734
The baron never makes jokes.

989
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:44,415
Look at us. We've been here for years and years.

990
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,014
I came here to repair the telephone.

991
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:50,536
That was 24 years ago.

992
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:53,293
They have terrible tortures.

993
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:56,531
The thumbscrew and the rack.

994
01:30:56,620 --> 01:31:00,613
They stretch you and stretch you.

995
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:04,693
When I first came here, I was a midget.

996
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,890
Phaw!

997
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:12,893
But, I mean, a floating car!

998
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:14,857
That's impossible!

999
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:18,615
- Nothing's impossible. - That's what my son's always saying.

1000
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:21,419
We'll help you, won't we, lads?

1001
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,776
Nil desperandum. We'll succeed. You'll see.

1002
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:26,976
Courage, man.

1003
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,416
## Every bursted bubble has a glory

1004
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:34,254
## Each abysmal failure makes a point

1005
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:37,889
## Every glowing path that goes astray

1006
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:41,336
## Shows you how to find a better way

1007
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:45,174
## So every time you stumble, never grumble

1008
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:48,377
## Next time you'll bumble even less

1009
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:52,692
## For up from the ashes, up from the ashes

1010
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:55,817
## Grow the roses of success

1011
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:59,417
## Grow the roses

1012
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,060
## Grow the roses of success

1013
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:02,890
## Oh, yes

1014
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:04,652
## Grow the roses

1015
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,617
## Those rosy roses

1016
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:10,818
## From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success

1017
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:13,972
- But he wants it to float. - It will.

1018
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:15,971
## For every big mistake you make,

1019
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:17,891
- ## Be grateful - ## Hear, hear

1020
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:21,131
- ## That mistake you'll never make again - ## No, sir

1021
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:24,690
## Every shiny dream that fades and dies

1022
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:28,455
## Generates the steam for two more tries

1023
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:31,293
## There's magic in the wake of a fiasco

1024
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:31,892
## Correct

1025
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:34,574
## It gives you that chance to second-guess

1026
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:35,410
## Oh, yes

1027
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:39,209
- ## Then up from the ashes - ## Up from the ashes

1028
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,095
## Grow the roses of success

1029
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:46,297
## Grow the roses

1030
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:49,019
## Grow the roses of success

1031
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:51,418
## Grow the roses

1032
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,331
## Those rosy roses

1033
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:57,811
## From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success

1034
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:04,329
- ## Disaster didn't stymie Louis Pasteur - ## No, sir

1035
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:08,299
- ## Edison took years to see the light - ## Right

1036
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:11,372
## Alexander Graham knew failure well

1037
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:15,169
## He took a lot of knocks to ring that bell

1038
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:18,696
## So when it gets distressing, it's a blessing

1039
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:22,011
## Onward and upward you must press, yes, yes

1040
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,250
## Till up from the ashes

1041
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:26,251
## Up from the ashes

1042
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:29,138
## Grow the roses of success

1043
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:31,010
## Grow the ro...

1044
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:32,852
## Grow the roses

1045
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,576
## Grow the ro...

1046
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,412
## Grow the roses

1047
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,695
## Grow the roses of success

1048
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,856
## Grow the ro...

1049
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:43,259
## Grow the roses

01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:45,050
## Those rosy ro...

1051
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:47,017
## Those rosy roses

1052
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:50,012
## From the ashes of disaster

1053
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:52,773
## Grow the roses

1054
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,930
## Of success!

1055
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,578
- Start the engine. - ## Success!

1056
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,378
- Batten the hatches. - ## Success!

1057
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:00,291
Man the shrouds!

1058
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,450
Lift the anchor!

1059
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:06,850
## Success!

1060
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:22,611
Oh, Daddy, we'll never find him.

1061
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:25,089
We must keep looking.

1062
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:27,535
Look! What's that down there?

1063
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,128
A- ha!

1064
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,891
Let's have a look.

1065
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:39,298
Look!

1066
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:42,575
- The Zeppelin! - We've found Grandpa.

1067
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:44,537
Not yet we haven't.

1068
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:02,610
What's happening?

1069
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:05,419
- Remarkable! - Your Excellency...

1070
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,730
- We are being attacked. - Attacked?

1071
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,173
Attack! Attack!

1072
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:12,133
That was that terrible Bomburst!

1073
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,529
It certainly was.

1074
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:16,690
- Where are they going? - It's a car!

1075
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:18,179
Where did they go?

1076
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:22,894
How floaty in the heavenly abode, fully peoplebodies.

1077
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:26,412
Fire!

1078
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:30,209
What's the matter with you? You want to destroy my beautiful car?

1079
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:32,651
They're firing at us.

1080
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:36,050
There are children up there.

1081
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:38,096
We'd better get away from here.

1082
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:43,211
Hang on, everybody. We're coming in to land.

1083
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,929
Your Excellency, it's landing in the village.

1084
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:49,329
Call out the guards!

1085
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:00,731
And call out the child catcher!

1086
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:08,054
Charge!

1087
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:14,454
Charge!

1088
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:20,093
Let me in.

1089
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:33,809
We made it!

1090
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,051
- Isn't Chitty wonderful? - You're clever, Daddy.

1091
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:40,529
Yes, he certainly is.

1092
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,850
You all stay here. I'm going to the castle.

1093
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:45,374
- We want to come too. - To help you find Grandpa.

1094
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:48,133
Don't you think we ought to stay together?

1095
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:51,292
- Maybe you're right. - Come on, children.

1096
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:56,295
- I wonder where we are. - I don't know.

1097
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,492
Come on.

1098
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:05,538
Pardon me, sir. The castle?

1099
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:08,453
- Le chateau? - Der Schloss?

1100
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:12,978
What's the matter with him?

1101
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,051
Come on.

1102
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:47,298
What are they staring at?

1103
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:49,575
I don't know.

1104
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:54,529
It seems to be the children.

1105
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:57,612
Haven't they seen children before?

1106
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:01,335
Haven't you noticed?

1107
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:03,695
There aren't any children.

1108
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,652
Not one.

1109
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,136
What's going on?

1110
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:19,379
Hey, you, what's happening?

1111
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:21,332
Soldiers! Soldiers!

1112
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:31,771
Hey, you there!

1113
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:35,011
- Get the children in here. - Can you tell me what's happening?

1114
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:37,295
Quickly, before the soldiers get here.

1115
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:42,010
Come, Fraulein. Get inside, quickly.

1116
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:48,096
We must hide the children. The soldiers will take them away.

1117
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:49,818
But why?

1118
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:52,619
Nobody's allowed to have children in Vulgaria.

1119
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:57,615
- But what about all these toys? - The baroness hates children.

1120
01:38:57,700 --> 01:39:00,931
Quickly, down there. And don't make a sound.

1121
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:23,892
I want every house in this square to be searched from top to bottom.

1122
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:26,130
First section, step out there and search.

1123
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:30,498
Second section, over there. Section three, over there.

1124
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:33,970
Search everywhere!

1125
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:38,533
Giddap!

1126
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:48,172
There are children here somewhere.

1127
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:51,332
I can smell them.

1128
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,136
Aaah-ha!

1129
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:56,778
Captain!

1130
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:59,852
I think we've got them.

1131
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:03,569
- Lieutenant! - Break down this door.

1132
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:06,217
Get this door open.

1133
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:07,972
All right. I'm coming.

1134
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,733
Bang the door down! Quickly!

1135
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:14,009
You've no right to come in here!

1136
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,614
- Search the place! - Search! Search!

1137
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:20,656
A- ha!

1138
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,699
They are here somewhere.

1139
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:26,499
I can feel it in my bones.

1140
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:29,458
There are children here.

1141
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:33,852
Children in a toy shop. Such a notion. I mean...

1142
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:37,376
What are you doing? That's for the baron's birthday.

1143
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:40,816
Let me tell you, toymaker.

1144
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:45,257
This nose of mine has never failed me.

1145
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:50,368
And if there are children here, my friend,

1146
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:53,816
you will die.

1147
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,771
A- ha!

1148
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:06,175
Quick, open it up. Get down there and search the cellar.

1149
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:12,297
The baroness will have your teeth for a necklace

1150
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:15,338
and your eyeballs for earrings.

1151
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:20,858
- Nobody down here. - Fool. Idiot. Out of my way.

1152
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:24,979
You have to know where to look.

1153
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:29,292
Like cockroaches they get under the floors,

1154
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:31,814
in the cracks in the walls,

1155
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:34,698
in the woodwork.

1156
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:15,213
I don't trust a man who makes toys

1157
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:20,135
in a land where children are forbidden.

1158
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:23,417
Every toy I make is exclusively for His Excellency the Baron.

1159
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:27,379
Captain, ze flying car. We've captured ze flying car.

1160
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:29,132
Fall in! Fall in!

1161
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:49,810
Take zis car to the castle.

1162
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:57,139
- They can't take Chitty. - Daddy, do something.

1163
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:00,257
- What are you going to do? - I'm not just gonna stand here.

1164
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:04,379
Are you mad? Are you going to take on the whole army single-handed?

1165
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:14,448
What kind of a country is this?

1166
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:16,371
No children.

1167
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:18,928
Everybody terrified out of their lives.

1168
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:21,409
My friend, take some good advice.

1169
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,334
Take your children and your good lady and get out of Vulgaria.

1170
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:29,732
And leave Grandpa up in the castle? We need to get him out.

1171
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:32,812
- Just tell me how to get there. - I'm only a toymaker.

1172
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:36,973
If I don't finish this for the baron's birthday, I shall be a dead toymaker.

1173
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:40,370
I'll go myself. Truly, you stay here with the children.

1174
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:42,451
All right, all right.

1175
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:49,535
You don't know what you're letting yourself in for.

1176
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:54,609
- Here's one for you, one for you. - Thank you, toymaker.

1177
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:56,895
Keep them out of sight, please.

1178
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:59,096
You be good and do what Truly tells you.

1179
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:00,852
- We will. - Yes, Daddy.

1180
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,979
Are you coming?

1181
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:17,334
Come.

1182
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:25,735
Quickly!

1183
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:31,769
There isn't a scrap of food in the place.

1184
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:36,172
- I'm so hungry, my tummy hurts. - Mine is making funny noises.

1185
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:38,615
I simply must find something for you.

1186
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:41,373
Promise not to move from here until I come back.

1187
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:43,530
- We promise, don't we? - Yes.

1188
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:46,373
Remember, you stay right here.

1189
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:56,254
To get in that way, you have to be a mouse, or a magician.

1190
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:05,457
We should go down now before a sentry sees us.

1191
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,735
Come. Come.

1192
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:13,051
The flying car.

1193
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:17,212
At last it's mine.

1194
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:20,292
Send for the inventor.

1195
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:22,811
Now, then, fly.

1196
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,652
- Yes, fly. - Fly.

1197
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:26,810
- Come on. Fly. - Fly, fly, fly.

1198
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:29,811
I command you to fly!

1199
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:31,736
Watch it.

1200
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:34,812
- Over here. - Hello! What's this doing here?

1201
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:38,415
You are the inventor. Make this car fly.

1202
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:41,810
Make it fly. Go on. Get in.

1203
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:47,138
Stand back, everyone. We are going to fly.

1204
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:50,257
Yoo-hoo, Bombie, wait for me!

1205
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:53,616
Every time I want to have a little fun, she turns up.

1206
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:59,292
My darling, we are going for a fly.

1207
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:03,373
How exciting. Fly. How thrilling.

1208
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:06,497
- Hurry up. - I am doing my best, sir.

1209
01:46:06,580 --> 01:46:09,492
Just a minute. Here's one we haven't tried.

1210
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:12,140
- Here we go, my beloved. - Hold on!

1211
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:16,499
Isn't it exciting, my dear?

1212
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:24,693
You are a genius. Bring my guns.

1213
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:27,578
Don't worry, little pigeon. I'll get you down.

1214
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:31,096
I've been waiting for this for 20 years.

1215
01:46:31,740 --> 01:46:35,096
Are you still there, my love? Don't move.

1216
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:46,453
There she is, Your Excellency.

1217
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:48,690
My diamonds!

1218
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:51,010
Are you all right, my dear?

1219
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:54,174
I'm all right, my dumpling.

1220
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:58,011
Good. Never mind. I'll get her the next time.

1221
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:18,773
Here we are, children. Come and get your lollipops.

1222
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:22,258
Lollipops.

1223
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:25,059
Come along, my little ones.

1224
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:27,131
Lollipops.

1225
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:34,538
Ice cream. Chocolate. All free today.

1226
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:36,690
Listen.

1227
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:40,259
What's that?

1228
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:47,934
Children, where are you?

1229
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:52,610
I know you're here somewhere.

1230
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:58,851
I've lots of lovely goodies for you.

1231
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:01,534
Jeremy, you mustn't.

1232
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:06,931
Lollipops.

1233
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:11,972
And all free today.

1234
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:13,732
Cherry pies,

1235
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:15,856
cream puffs,

1236
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:17,578
ice cream,

1237
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:19,457
treacle tarts.

1238
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:22,338
- Treacle tarts. - And ice creams.

1239
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:24,012
And all free.

1240
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:27,888
Come along, kiddiwinkies.

1241
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:31,770
- Come on. - Truly said we mustn't.

1242
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:34,897
We'll get Truly some as well.

1243
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:40,176
Mr Man...

1244
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:43,653
Children, come back.

1245
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:48,171
Children, come back here.

1246
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:53,176
Come along, my little dears,

1247
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:55,057
my little mice.

1248
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:57,131
Come to me.

1249
01:48:57,940 --> 01:49:00,500
What will it be? Ice cream?

1250
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:04,698
Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla. It's all inside.

1251
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:06,850
Come along, my little dears.

1252
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:09,295
Not a penny to pay.

1253
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:12,133
Go inside, my little dears.

1254
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:33,132
Children!

1255
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:39,018
Truly.

1256
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:40,579
Help! Help!

1257
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:44,050
- What's happened? - He took the children.

1258
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:51,658
Your Excellency.

1259
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:54,334
- Let us out. - Silence.

1260
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:07,772
Children, Your Highness.

1261
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:12,217
Foreign children. Unique specimens.

1262
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:14,655
You're sure they can't get out?

1263
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:16,731
No, Your Highness.

1264
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:22,729
Perhaps Your Highness would care to examine them.

1265
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:28,099
Nasty little creatures. Very, very treacherous. Foreign.

1266
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:35,931
- Wait till our daddy hears about this. - He'll blow up the whole castle.

1267
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:39,012
Take them away to the tower.

1268
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:42,255
You're a nasty, horrid, mean old lady.

1269
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:45,298
And very ugly.

1270
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:47,769
Oh, she's going.

1271
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:18,614
200 feet above us through that solid rock is the castle of Baron Bomburst.

1272
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:50,816
These are our children.

1273
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:55,769
For five years, we have hidden them here.

1274
01:51:55,860 --> 01:52:01,457
They don't know what a tree looks like or what it is to run in the sunshine.

1275
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:05,451
Food.

1276
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:07,929
There's bread for everyone.

1277
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:14,016
Like little rats, they run up and down the sewers, stealing food from the kitchens.

1278
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:16,330
Here, catch!

1279
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:18,729
Son!

1280
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:23,179
I think my children are up there in the castle with their grandfather.

1281
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:25,933
- Have you seen them? - No, sir.

1282
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:27,931
- A little boy and girl? - Yes.

1283
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:30,136
They're locked up in the tower.

1284
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:33,530
- And the grandfather? - In the dungeon.

1285
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:36,453
Sir, have you come to help us?

1286
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:44,212
Are you going to take us out of here?

1287
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:49,694
- What's your name, son? - Peter, sir.

1288
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:55,059
Peter, you shouldn't be afraid, even in a terrible place like this.

1289
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:58,735
Because there's always hope.

1290
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:03,416
That's what I always tell my children when they're afraid.

1291
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:14,218
## A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain

1292
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:21,695
## Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay

1293
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:28,333
## It fills the sails of boats that are waiting

1294
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:32,618
## Waiting to sail...

1295
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:43,735
## So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain

1296
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:50,737
## Wave goodbye to cares of the day

1297
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:59,774
## And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain

1298
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:12,568
## Sail far away from Lullaby Bay

1299
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:17,371
Is that the only advice you have to offer?

1300
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:22,773
It's a beautiful dream, but I don't see how it's going to help them.

1301
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:25,852
We're gonna get up into that castle.

1302
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:28,659
- It is impossible. - We'll see.

1303
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:31,174
Everybody listen to me.

1304
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:34,730
- You want to get out of here, don't you? - Yes!

1305
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:38,538
Tomorrow is Baron Bomburst's birthday, yes?

1306
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:40,611
Boo!

1307
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:45,176
We'll give him a party he'll never forget.

1308
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:49,458
Everybody gather around here. I have an idea.

1309
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:06,775
## Happy birthday to me

1310
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:10,933
## Happy birthday, dear Bombie

1311
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:13,256
Don't move.

1312
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:15,410
What a picture.

1313
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,855
Such memories it brings back.

1314
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:22,332
My little dumpling.

1315
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:24,615
My Liebling.

1316
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:28,295
## You're my little chu-chi face

1317
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:32,612
## My kootchi, kootchi, wootchi little chu-chi face

1318
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:39,094
## Every time I look at you I sigh

1319
01:55:39,820 --> 01:55:43,779
## And you're my little teddy bear

1320
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:47,614
## My lovey, lovey dovey little teddy bear

1321
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:53,889
## You're the Apfel Streudel of mein eye

1322
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:59,173
## Your chu-chi, wootchi nose, your chu-chi, wootchi eyes

1323
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:02,855
## They set my heart a-flutter

1324
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:06,853
## Your ootchi, kootchi ways, your ootchi, kootchi gaze

1325
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:13,857
## Wilts me down like meltings butter

1326
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:19,417
## You're my little chu-chi face

1327
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:23,732
## And you're my teddy bear

1328
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:29,850
## Together we're a chu-chi, wootchi, ootchi, kootchi pair

1329
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:50,694
## Whatever you may ask becomes my happy task

1330
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:54,170
## I only live to serve you

1331
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:58,299
## I never will divine what magic made you mine

1332
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:05,536
## I only know I don't deserve you

1333
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,891
Ha, ha, ha!

1334
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:16,856
## You're my little chu-chi face

1335
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:20,774
## And you're my teddy bear

1336
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:25,456
## Together we're a chu-chi, wootchi, ootchi, kootchi

1337
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:27,812
- ## Chu-chi - ## Wootchi

1338
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:29,299
- ## Ootchi - ## Kootchi

1339
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:34,531
## Chu-chi, wootchi, ootchi, kootchi

1340
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:36,611
## Pair

1341
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:29,135
What a rotten birthday party.

1342
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:32,257
Never mind, my little Bombie.

1343
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:34,490
I have a surprise for you.

1344
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:38,493
Surprises! Oh, I love surprises.

1345
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:41,652
Sit down quickly.

1346
01:58:43,140 --> 01:58:48,208
Summon the toymaker.

1347
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:54,093
Hurry up. Don't waste time.

1348
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:04,016
Your Excellency, may I wish you all you wish yourself on this happy occasion.

1349
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:08,059
Never mind that. What have you made me for my birthday?

1350
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:13,055
What have I made you? Such a toy. A work of mechanical perfection.

1351
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:15,859
Where is it? Bring it in.

1352
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:20,968
Right away. I'll get it for you. Bring in the baron's birthday present.

1353
01:59:31,220 --> 01:59:35,577
This year, Your Excellency, I have surpassed even myself.

1354
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:39,812
Put it down there. Careful with it.

1355
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:44,610
For months I have been working night and day perfecting every little detail

1356
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:47,453
to bring you this.

1357
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:53,652
Dolls? Dolls?

1358
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:57,858
I have hundreds of dolls.

1359
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:03,413
But this is not just an ordinary doll, Your Excellency.

1360
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:09,211
You see?

1361
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:21,735
## What do you see, you people gazing at me

1362
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:28,930
## You see a doll on a music box that's wound by a key

1363
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:37,019
## How can you tell I'm under a spell

1364
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:43,096
## I'm waiting for love's first kiss

1365
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:52,969
## You cannot see how much I long to be free

1366
02:00:53,060 --> 02:01:00,569
## Turning around on this music box that's wound by a key

1367
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:08,089
## Yearning, yearning

1368
02:01:08,180 --> 02:01:15,450
## While I'm turning around and around

1369
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:39,048
- ## What do you see - ## Truly Scrumptious

1370
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:44,214
- ## You people gazing at me - ## You're truly, truly scrumptious

1371
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:47,372
- ## You see a doll on a music box - ## Scrumptious as...

1372
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:50,452
## That's wound by a key

1373
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:54,498
## How can you tell

1374
02:03:54,580 --> 02:03:58,129
## I'm under a spell

1375
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:02,054
- ## I'm waiting for love's - ## Honest, Truly

1376
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:06,736
- ## First kiss - ## You're the answer to my wishes

1377
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:09,175
- ## You cannot see - ## Truly Scrumptious

1378
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:14,254
- ## How much I long to be free - ## Though I may seem presumptuous

1379
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:17,616
- ## Turning around on this music box - ## Ne...

1380
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:20,772
## That's wound by a key

1381
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:25,499
- ## Yearning - ## My heart beats so unruly

1382
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:29,016
- ## Yearning - ## Because I love you truly

1383
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:31,052
- ## While - ## Honest

1384
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:33,131
- ## I'm - ## Truly, I do

1385
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:35,615
## Turning around and around

1386
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:47,215
Just a minute!

1387
02:05:15,660 --> 02:05:17,651
Atchoo!

1388
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:27,017
Oh, I'm so happy

1389
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:29,614
I could jump for joy!

1390
02:06:36,940 --> 02:06:39,249
- Come on. - Come, follow me.

1391
02:06:40,220 --> 02:06:43,053
Children!

1392
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:55,259
Get me down!

1393
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:11,058
Call the cavalry!

1394
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:23,295
- Jeremy, Jeremy! - Jemima!

1395
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:29,371
- They could be anywhere. - Look that way. I'll go this way.

1396
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:45,008
Jeremy and Jemima! Jeremy and Jemima!

1397
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:46,852
Jeremy! Jemima!

1398
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:50,057
It's Truly. We're in here.

1399
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:53,132
Don't worry. We'll get you out of here.

1400
02:07:53,620 --> 02:07:56,214
Here. They're in there.

1401
02:07:56,300 --> 02:08:00,532
- Children, are you all right? - Daddy, get us out of here!

1402
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:05,654
We found them. Help me break the door down.

1403
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:08,855
Children, get away from the door.

1404
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:17,813
- Children! - Daddy! Daddy!

1405
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:03,893
Let me down!

1406
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:08,411
Ow!

1407
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:13,972
- Mein Liebchen, are you hurt? - My back is broken.

1408
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:18,053
- We must escape through the cellars. - Well, come on, hurry up.

1409
02:09:18,140 --> 02:09:20,131
Come on.

1410
02:09:22,220 --> 02:09:24,370
- You stay here. - Daddy, where are you going?

1411
02:09:32,420 --> 02:09:36,891
Where are these children coming from? We passed a law against children.

1412
02:09:36,980 --> 02:09:40,734
- This way. We'll go down here. - Where are we going?

1413
02:09:40,820 --> 02:09:44,813
- I'll get my clothes dirty. - Don't argue.

1414
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:56,538
Oh, my crown! I lost my crown.

1415
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:59,088
Never mind, my little Bombkin.

1416
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:09,011
Here.

1417
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:11,891
Attack!

1418
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:15,618
- Daddy, look out. - Look, there's Chitty.

1419
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:17,816
She's come to save us.

1420
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:39,452
Hello. What's that car doing here?

1421
02:10:39,940 --> 02:10:42,738
There's Grandpa.

1422
02:10:42,820 --> 02:10:44,617
Caractacus!

1423
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:17,936
Stand back from the propellers. Keep clear.

1424
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:35,009
And so, after that, Vulgaria became a free country.

1425
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:39,651
And all the children laughed and played and they were very happy.

1426
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:44,372
And Chitty flew high over the mountains back to England,

1427
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:46,416
everybody safe and sound and...

1428
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:50,857
- And Daddy and Truly were married. - And lived happily ever after.

1429
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:54,332
Is that how the story ends?

1430
02:11:56,300 --> 02:12:00,657
It's getting late. We'd better get back.

1431
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:27,893
Well...

1432
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:30,448
- Goodbye, Jeremy, Jemima. - Goodbye, Truly.

1433
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:33,213
- Will we see you again? - I expect so.

1434
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:35,291
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1435
02:12:38,980 --> 02:12:40,971
Truly!

1436
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:45,332
I hope the children didn't embarrass you.

1437
02:12:45,420 --> 02:12:48,571
- In what way? - That silly joke about us getting married.

1438
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:50,696
- You know what kids are like. - I understand.

1439
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:53,897
I don't think they realise how ridiculous that would be.

1440
02:12:53,980 --> 02:12:55,891
- Ridiculous? - Well, yes.

1441
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:59,131
I mean, you live in that big house, and your father,

1442
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:02,257
and the factory and all. It's a different world.

1443
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:06,128
If I said something like that, you'd call me a snob.

1444
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:09,212
- I didn't mean... - Goodbye!

1445
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:16,812
Well, don't you want to ride up front?

1446
02:13:25,540 --> 02:13:28,976
Well, that was a fine picnic, wasn't it?

1447
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,376
- Shall we have another one tomorrow? - With Truly?

1448
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:40,454
Well, Miss Scrumptious has a lot of social engagements, you know.

1449
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:45,092
Are we ever going to see Truly again?

1450
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:49,294
Well, we'll see.

1451
02:13:55,660 --> 02:13:58,254
That's Lord Scrumptious's car.

1452
02:13:58,340 --> 02:14:01,218
- Why, I believe it is. - I wonder what it's doing here.

1453
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:03,973
- I don't know. - Come on.

1454
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:08,737
- Excuse me? Are you...? - Good afternoon.

1455
02:14:15,100 --> 02:14:17,011
That's wiped out your cavalry.

1456
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:20,888
But I have my second infantry battalion attacking from the rear.

1457
02:14:20,980 --> 02:14:23,619
Attacking from the rear? That's dashed unethical.

1458
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:27,249
Artillery, prepare to open fire.

1459
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:30,169
Number one battalion, prepare to advance.

1460
02:14:30,260 --> 02:14:34,333
- What's going on? - I've been waiting for you, young Potts.

1461
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:38,208
- And that wiped out your artillery. - You're a cad, Potts.

1462
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:43,249
- What is going on here? - Fancy you being old Bungie's son.

1463
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:46,537
- Best batman I ever had. - Thank you, sir.

1464
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:51,136
My boy, allow me to introduce to you my brigadier.

1465
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:54,690
- Potts, how about some more tea? - Right away, sir.

1466
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:57,738
As for you, there's a good chance you may be very rich.

1467
02:14:57,820 --> 02:14:59,538
What do you mean?

1468
02:14:59,620 --> 02:15:04,330
Those confounded sweets of yours. Useless for humans, wonderful for dogs.

1469
02:15:04,420 --> 02:15:06,775
Woof Sweets, that's what we'll call 'em.

1470
02:15:06,860 --> 02:15:10,694
Canine candies. Dogs love 'em. Make a fortune.

1471
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:12,930
- You've done it, Daddy. - Have I?

1472
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:15,170
It's the posh life for us all now.

1473
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:17,251
We're going to be rich.

1474
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:19,979
I invented something that actually works?

1475
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:23,370
I wouldn't be offering you a contract otherwise.

1476
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:27,090
Later. Don't go away.

1477
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:30,172
- What about the contract? - Where are you going?

1478
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:32,571
Daddy!

1479
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:38,130
What's the matter with the fella?

1480
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:41,690
He's a bit of an eccentric, sir. A genius, of course.

1481
02:15:41,780 --> 02:15:45,534
But definitely an eccentric.

1482
02:15:45,620 --> 02:15:48,453
Can't imagine where he gets it from.

1483
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:58,853
Truly, you'll never believe it. I got home and your father was at my house.

1484
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:02,615
- I know. They told me at the house. - We're rich.

1485
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:05,578
More than that, I have succeeded.

1486
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:08,493
I always knew you would.

1487
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:13,938
You know something else? There's nothing ridiculous about getting married.

1488
02:16:14,020 --> 02:16:16,693
Whoever said there was?

1489
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:25,937
Well, Mr Potts.

1490
02:16:26,020 --> 02:16:30,013
- What's the matter? - Now you'll have to marry me.

1491
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:38,696
- So dreams can come true. - Yes, they can.

1492
02:16:38,780 --> 02:16:41,135
But you have to be practical too.

1493
02:16:41,220 --> 02:16:43,814
You have to face the facts.

1494
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:46,289
A man has to see things as they really are.

1495
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:51,500
A man with responsibilities can't have his head in the clouds all the time.

1496
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:54,617
A man should keep his feet solidly on the ground.

1497
02:16:54,700 --> 02:17:00,935
Oh, a man should have his dreams, but he has to put them to some practical use,

1498
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:04,899
not just sit around and think about 'em all the time.

1499
02:17:12,060 --> 02:17:13,891
## Oh, you pretty Chitty Bang Bang

1500
02:17:13,980 --> 02:17:16,130
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you

1501
02:17:16,220 --> 02:17:17,972

1502

1503
02:17:20,220 --> 02:17:24,054

1504

## Our fine four-fendered friend

1508
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:36,810
## It's uncategorical

1509
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:38,851
## A fuel-burning oracle

1510
02:17:38,940 --> 02:17:42,489
## A fantasmagorical machine

1511
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:44,811
## It's more than spectacular

1512
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:46,856
## To use the vernacular

1513
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:48,931
- ## It's wizard! - ## It's smashing!

1514
02:17:49,020 --> 02:17:52,410
## It's keen

1515
02:17:52,980 --> 02:17:54,971
## Oh, Chitty, you Chitty, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

1516
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:56,971
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you

1517
02:17:57,060 --> 02:17:58,857
## And, Chitty, in Chitty, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

1518
02:17:58,940 --> 02:18:00,817
## Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, what we'll do

1519
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:02,731
## Near Chitty, far Chitty, in our motor car

1520
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:04,856
## Oh, what a happy time we'll spend

1521
02:18:04,940 --> 02:18:06,692
## Bang bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

1522
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:08,896
## Our fine four-fendered friend

1523
