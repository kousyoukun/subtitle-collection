.. they would reach from Times Square to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.

5
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:54,448
I know facts like this because I work for an insurance company, Consolidated Life.

6
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,117
We're one of the top five companies in the country.

7
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:01,038
Our home office has 31,259 employees, ...

8
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:05,500
.. which is more than the entire population of, uh ... Natchez, Mississippi.

00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,629
I work on the 19th floor. Ordinary Policy Department, ...

My name is CC Baxter: C for Calvin, C for Clifford. But most people call me Bud.

00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:23,435
I've worked here three years, ten months, and my take-home pay is $94. 70 a week.

13
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,782
The hours in our department are 8.50 to 5.20.

.. without a serious traffic jam.

17
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:54,591
As for myself, I very often stay on at the office and work for an extra hour or two, ...

18
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,802
.. especially when the weather is bad.

19
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,514
It's not that I'm overly ambitious. It's just a way of time ...

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,350
.. until it's all right for me to go home.

21
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,020
You see, I have this little problem with my apartment.

22
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,775
I live in the West 60s, just half a block from Central Park.

23
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,070
My rent is $85 a month. It used to be $80 until last July ...

24
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:19,116
.. when Mrs Lieberman, the landlady, put in a second-hand air conditioner.

25
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:24,913
It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy, but kind of cosy. Just right for a bachelor.

26
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,500
The only problem is I can't always get in when I want to.

Cut it out, Sylvia. We've gotta get out of here.

What's the panic? I'm gonna have another martini.

31
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,064
Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.

32

First you can't wait to get me here and then it's rush, rush, rush.

But I promised the guy I'd be outta here by eight.

- What guy? Whose apartment is this? - Some schnook that works in the office.

- Good evening, Mr Baxter. - Mrs Lieberman.

Some weather we're having. Must be from all that meshugaas at Cape Canaveral.

- Where does she live? - 179th Street, in the Bronx.

- All right. I'll take you to the subway. - Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.

Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

Uh, no. I... seem to have dropped my key. Ah, here it is.

Maybe you had burglars?

- Well, good night, Doc. - Say, Baxter.

The way you're beltin' that stuff, you must have cast-iron kidneys.

That's not me. Just once in a while I have a few people in for a drink.

As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around.

- You got a lulu. - Yeah. Better not get too close.

151
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,789
- I never catch colds. - Really?

152
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,750
I was reading some sickness and accident claims figures.

153
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:27,505
The average New Yorker aged between 20 and SO has two and a half colds a year.

154
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,091
- That makes me feel just terrible. - Why?

155
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,470
If I have no colds a year, some poor slob must have five colds a year.

156
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,182
- Yeah. It's me. - You should a stayed in bed this morning.

157
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,851
I shoulda stayed in bed last night.

158
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,187
19!

159
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,109
Watch your step.

160
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,778
- And watch your hands, Mr Kirkeby! - Pardon?

161
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,490
One of these days I'm gonna shut these doors on you and ...

162
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,494
20 next!

163
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,873
That Kubelik. Boy, would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China!

164
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,627
- She's the best operator in the building. - I'm pretty good myself.

165
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,797
- But she won't give me a date. - Maybe it's your approach.

166
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,718
A lot of guys around here have tried all kinds of approaches. No dice.

167
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:18,014
- What's she trying to prove? - She could just be a nice respectable girl.

168
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,725
Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.

169
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,732
[bell]

170
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,920
Hello. Mr Dobisch? This is Baxter on the 19th floor.

171
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,797
Oh, Buddy-boy!

172
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,844
I was just about to call you. I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall.

173
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:01,182
My friend kept insisting Picasso was a bum, so she started to do that mural.

174
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,726
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

175
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:08,647
It's the key to my apartment. You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

176
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,859
But I did. I distinctly remember putting it there.

177
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,154
Oh, I found the key all right. Only it's the wrong key!

178
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:21,452
It is? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.

179
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,038
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

180
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:28,167
So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance.

181
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,504
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down.

182
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,547
And about your promotion.

183
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,884
I'll send that efficiency report to Mr Sheldrake in Personnel.

184
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,512
You may hear from him before the day's over.

185
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,722
Thank you, Mr Dobisch.

186
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,727
[coughs]

187
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,668
From Mr Dobisch.

188
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,920
Wait.

189
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,599
For Mr Dobisch.

190
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,400
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

191
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,914
[phone rings]

192
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,875
Vanderhof. Public Relations.

193
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,002
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

194
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,547
All right, Miss Finch. Type up what we got so far.

195
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,385
Look, I've got you down for tonight, ...

196
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,805
.. but I'll be using the place myself, so I'll have to cancel.

197
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,892
But it's her birthday. I already ordered the cake.

198
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:13,147
But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a fever. I got to go to bed right after work.

199
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,984
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath. Spend the night. Sweat it out.

200
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:21,322
That's how you get pneumonia. If I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.

201
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:25,826
OK. You made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday night.

202
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:31,665
- It's the only night I can get away. - Wednesday, Wednesday ... Wednesday.

203
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,503
I got somebody pencilled in.

204
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,589
Let me see what I can do. I'll get back to you.

205
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:53,020
- Mr Eichelberger. - Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?

206
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,944
Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws a little monkey wrench into my agenda.

207
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,447
Thursday? No, I'm all tied up on Thursday.

208
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,993
Let's schedule that, uh ... meeting for Friday.

209
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,204
Friday.

210
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,874
Let me see what I can do. I'll get back to you.

211
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:24,385
Premiumwise and billingwise, we are 18 per cent ahead of last year Octoberwise.

212
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,679
[phone rings]

213
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,224
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

214
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,561
Instead of Friday, could you possibly switch to Thursday?

215
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,564
You'd be doing me a great favour.

216
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,483
Let me check. I'll get back to you.

217
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,696
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.

218
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,739
Sylvia, it's for you.

219
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,700
yeah?

220
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,493
Oh, hello.

221
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,913
Sure I got home all right. You owe me 45 cents.

222
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,876
Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday, could we make it Thursday night?

223
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:02,256
Thursday?! Well, that's The Untouchables with Bob Stack!

224
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,592
Bob who?

225
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,762
All right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal!

226
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,603
Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.

227
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,272
Thank you, Mr Kirkeby.

228
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,451
Mr Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.

229
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,794
Mr Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.

230
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,599
All right. I'll tell him.

231
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,561
Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel. Mr Sheldrake's secretary.

232
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:02,733
She's been trying to reach you for the last 20 minutes. They want you upstairs.

233
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:08,405
- Are you getting promoted? Or fired? - Would you care to make a small wager?

234
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,701
- I've been here twice as long as you but... - Let's say a dollar?

235
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,495
It's a bet!

236
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,803
- Going up? - Oh! Excuse me.

237
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:36,183
27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying precious cargo. I mean manpowerwise.

238
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,435
27.

239
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,523
You may not realise it, but I am in the top ten, efficiencywise, ...

240
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,442
.. and this may be the day promotionwise.

241
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,195
You're beginning to sound like Mr Kirkeby already.

242
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:52,366
- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs? - Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

243
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:56,203
You know, you're the only one who takes his hat off in the elevator.

244
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,664
Something happens to men in elevators.

245
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,792
It's the change of altitude. The blood rushes to their head.

246
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,129
- I could tell you stories ... - I'd love to hear 'em.

247
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,840
We could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime.

248
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,883
Or some evening, after work?

249
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,553
-27.-0h.

250
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,347
- I hope everything goes all right. - I hope so.

251
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,225
They would call me today, what with my cold.

252
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,894
- How do I look? - Fine. Wait.

253
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,230
Thank you.

254
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:28,235
I noticed, when you were still on the local elevator, you always wore a flower.

255
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,904
Good luck. And wipe your nose.

256
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:50,049
CC Baxter, Ordinary Premium Accounting. Mr Sheldrake called me.

257
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,926
I called you. That is, I tried to for 20 minutes.

258
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,220
- I'm sorry. - Go on in.

259
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,442
- Baxter? - Yes, sir.

260
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,694
Come in, come in.

261
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,531
I was sort of wondering what you looked like, Baxter.

262
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,242
- Sit down. - Yes, Mr Sheldrake.

263
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,413
Been hearing some nice things about you.

264
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,625
Mr Dobisch says you're loyal, cooperative, resourceful.

265
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:29,129
- Mr Dobisch said that? - Mr Kirkeby tells me you often work late ...

266
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,633
- .. without overtime. - You know how it is. Things pile up.

267
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,887
Mr Vanderhof in Public Relations and Mr Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans ...

268
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,932
.. would both like you transferred to their departments.

269
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,059
Very flattering.

270
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:47,314
Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it that makes you so popular?

271
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,943
- I don't know. - Think.

272
00:26:56,156 --> 00:27:00,160
- Would you mind repeating the question? - Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.

273
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,832
I know everything that goes on in this building every day of the year.

274
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,458
You do?

275
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:11,130
In 1957 we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular too.

276
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,966
It turned out he was running a bookie joint, ...

277
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,636
.. tying up our switchboard, using our IBM machines to figure the odds.

278
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:22,015
The day before the Kentucky Derby I called in the vice squad, who raided him.

279
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,184
- The vice squad? - That's right.

280
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,646
What's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.

281
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,275
- Just what kind of joint are you running? - Sir?

282
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:36,488
A key is floating around from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

283
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,574
It's the key to a certain apartment.

284
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,202
- Know who that apartment belongs to? - Who?

285
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,706
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative CC Baxter.

286
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,711
- Oh. - Are you going to deny it?

287
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,716
No. I'm not going to deny it. If you'd just let me explain.

288
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,135
You'd better.

289
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,387
Well, ...

290
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:05,726
.. about a year ago, I was going to night school, studying advanced accounting.

291
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:10,898
One of the guys in our department - lives in Jersey - had to go to a banquet in town.

292
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:15,402
He needed someplace to change into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.

293
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:21,533
Word must've gotten out because all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets.

294
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,580
You give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another. It all got out of hand.

295
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,920
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust.

296
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,381
Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming ...

297
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,551
How many charter members are there in this little club?

298
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,430
Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.

299
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:47,684
So actually we can be very proud of our personnel ... percentagewise.

300
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:52,439
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel, however large the barrel ...

301
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,776
- Do you realise if this ever leaked out... - It won't!

302
00:28:55,943 --> 00:29:00,948
Believe me. Never again. Nobody is gonna use my apartment from now on.

303
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,742
- Where is your apartment? - West 67th Street.

304
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:09,331
You have no idea what I go through with the neighbours, the landlady and the key.

305
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,500
How do you work it with the key?

306
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:16,546
I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave it under a mat. Never again. I promise.

307
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,799
[intercom buzzer]

308
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,262
- Yes, Miss Olsen? - Mrs Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.

309
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,894
[Sheldrake] Yes, dear. Where were you?

310
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:36,400
You had to take Tommy to the dentist? No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.

311
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,569
- Where are you going, Baxter? - I don't wanna intrude.

312
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,990
- Since this is straightened out... - I'm not through with you yet.

313
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,325
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

314
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,496
The branch manager from Kansas City is in town. I'm taking him to the theatre.

315
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,456
Music Man. What else?

316
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,167
No, don't wait up for me, darling. Goodbye.

317
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,755
Tell me, Baxter. Have you seen Music Man?

318
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,508
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

319
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,844
How would you like to go tonight?

320
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:08,307
You and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City.

321
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,685
No, I have other plans. You can have both tickets.

322
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,854
Well. .. that's very kind of you.

323
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:18,025
But I'm not feeling well. I've got this cold. I'm gonna go right home.

324
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,862
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.

325
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,365
So do I. I'm gonna take four aspirins, get into bed.

326
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,868
So give the tickets to somebody else.

327
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:32,873
Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving these tickets. I wanna swap them.

328
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,208
Swap 'em? For what?

329
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:42,382
It also says here that you are alert, astute and quite imaginative.

330
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,552
Oh?

331
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,642
Oh...

332
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:06,073
That's good thinking, Baxter. There's gonna be a shift in personnel next month.

333
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,077
And as far as I'm concerned, you are executive material.

334
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,746
- I am? - Now put down the key.

335
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,959
And put down the address.

336
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,133
It's on the second floor. There's no name over the door. It just says apartment 2A.

337
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,053
- It's that cold. - Relax, Baxter.

338
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,263
Yes, thank you, sir.

339
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,352
You will be careful with the record player? Shh.

340
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,521
Oh, and about the liquor.

341
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:42,275
I ordered some this morning. I don't know when they'll deliver it.

342
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,279
- This is going to be our little secret. - Of course.

343
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,116
- You know how people talk. - Don't worry about that.

344
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,953
- Not that I have anything to hide. - No! Anyway, it's none of my business.

345
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,957
Four apples, five apples. What's the difference?

346
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,126
Percentagewise.

347
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,837
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

348
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,131
You too, sir.

349
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,000
So I figure, a man in his position, he'll take me to EI Morocco, maybe 21.

350
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:44,796
Instead he takes me to Hamburger Heaven and some schnook's apartment.

351
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,803
- Good night. - Good night.

352
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,057
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

353
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,352
I've been waiting for you. I almost didn't recognise you.

354
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,689
This is the first time I've seen you in civilian clothes.

355
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,066
- How'd it go on the 27th floor? - Great.

356
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,652
- Look, have you seen The Music Man? - No.

357
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,362
- Would you like to? - Sure.

358
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,865
We could get a bite to eat first, and then go.

359
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,533
- Oh, you mean tonight? - Yeah.

360
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,786
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody. - Oh.

361
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,498
- You mean ... like a girlfriend? - No. Like a man.

362
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:25,212
I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas in the office were wondering if you ever ...

363
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,297
You tell 'em now and then.

364
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:31,718
This date, is it... just a date? Or is it something serious?

365
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:35,347
Well, it used to be serious. At least, I was. But he wasn't.

366
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,849
So now the whole thing's more or less kaput.

367
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,560
- In that case, couldn't you ... - I'm afraid not.

368
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,898
I promised I'd have a drink with him. He's been calling me all week.

369
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,734
I understand.

370
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:52,405
Well, it was just an idea. I hate to see a theatre ticket go to waste.

371
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,659
- What time does the show go on? - 8.30.

372
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,161
Well, I could meet you at the theatre.

373
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:02,374
That's wonderful! It's the Majestic on 44th Street.

374
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,376
I'll meet you in the lobby.

375
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:08,004
You know, I felt so lousy this morning. Had 101 fever.

376
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,591
Now along comes my promotion and us - 11th row centre.

377
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,718
And you said I should've stayed in bed.

378
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,012
- How is your cold? - What cold?

379
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,183
After the show we could go out on the town. [hums dance tune]

380
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,103
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray. - So I see.

381
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,231
There's a great band at EI Chico, in the Village.

382
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,901
- Around the corner from where you live. - Sounds good.

383
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:34,614
- How do you know where I live? - Oh, I ... even know who you live with.

384
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,783
Your sister and brother-in-law.

385
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,912
I know when you were born and where. I know all sorts of things about you.

386
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,455
How come?

387
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:47,294
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.

388
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,298
I know your height and your weight and your social security number.

389
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:55,468
You had mumps and measles and you had your appendix out.

390
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,472
Don't mention the appendix to the fellas in the office.

391
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,477
I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea about how you found out. Bye.

392
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,816
8.30!

393
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,510

[plays "Jealous Lover"]

395
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,786
- Good evening, Mr Sheldrake. - Please, Fran. Not so loud.

396
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,372
Still afraid someone might see us together?

397
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,209
- Let me take your coat. - No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

398
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,713
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri? - It's on the way.

399
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:18,218
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair. - That's right.

400
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,680
- You know I liked it better long. - I know.

401
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,724
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

402
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:29,062
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again. - Thank you.

403
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,399
How long has it been, Fran? A month?

404
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,235
Six weeks. But who's counting?

405
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,405
I missed you.

406
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,909
Like old times.

407
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,829
Same booth. Same song.

408
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:50,834
- It's been hell. - Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.

409
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,464
You don't know what it's like, next to you in that elevator.

410
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,843
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik." "Good night, Mr Sheldrake."

411
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,512
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

412
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:08,226
Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please? I'm just beginning to get over it.

413
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,021
I don't believe you.

414
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,109
Look, Jeff. We had two wonderful months this summer.

415
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,112
But that was it. Happens all the time.

416
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:23,408
Wife and kids go away to the country and the boss has a fling with his secretary, ...

417
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,286
.. or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.

418
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,789
Come September, the picnic's over. Goodbye.

419
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,960
The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, ...

420
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,254
.. and the girl ...

421
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,592
They don't make these shrimp like they used to.

422
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,431
I never said goodbye, Fran.

423
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:53,271
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man.

424
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:56,149
Then one day he keeps looking at his watch ...

425
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,943
.. and asks you if any lipstick's showing, ...

426
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,655
.. then rushes out to catch the 7.14 to White Plains.

427
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,327
So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee ...

428
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:11,331
.. and you sit there by yourself and you think, ...

429
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,627
.. and it all begins to look so ... ugly.

430
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,842
How do you think I felt riding home on that 7.14 train?

431
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:27,180
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?

432
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,349
I want you back, Fran.

433
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:33,436
Sorry, Mr Sheldrake. I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.

434
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:37,482
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I have something to tell you.

435
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:41,486
- Go ahead. Tell me. - Not here. Can't we go someplace else?

436
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,531
- No. I have a date at 8.30. - Oh?

437
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,660
- Important? - Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.

438
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,454
- You ready order dinner now? - No. No dinner.

439
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,165
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

440
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,725
[coughs]

441
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,896
Fran, do you remember that last weekend we had?

442
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:21,901
Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me in a black negligee and a life preserver.

443
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,404
Do you remember what we talked about?

444
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,157
- We talked about a lot of things. - I mean about my getting a divorce.

445
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,660
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

446
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,829
You didn't believe me, did you?

447
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,417
They got it on a long-playing record now. "Music to String Her Along By."

448
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:42,380
"My wife doesn't understand me. You're the best thing that ever happened to me."

449
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,842
- That's enough, Fran. - "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."

450
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,761
- You're not being funny. - I wasn't trying.

00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:53,224
- Fran, just listen to me for a minute. - All right. I'm sorry.

452
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:58,438
I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted his advice about the best way to handle it.

453
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,107
- Handle what? - What do you think?

454
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:07,071
Let's get something straight, Jeff. I never asked you to leave your wife.

455
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,949
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.

456
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,078
Are you sure that's what you want?

457
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,750
I'm sure ... if you'll just tell me that you still love me.

458
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,963
You know I do.

459
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,801
Fran.

461
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,474
Jeff, darling ...

462
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,983
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

465
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,604
- Jeff, I have that date, remember? - But I love you, remember?

466
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,357
- [whistles] - Where are we going?

467
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,360
- Not back to that leaky boat? - I promise.

Congratulations.

Would you mind? CC Baxter - that's me.

471
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,228
Thank you.

[door opens]

473
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,914
[Kirkeby] Hi, Buddy-boy. Congratulations and all that jazz.

474
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,542
- Hi, fellas. - Well, you made it, just like we promised.

475
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,879
Quite an office. Name on the door, rug on the floor.

476
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:14,717
Teamwork: that's what counts in this organisation. All for one and one for all.

477
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,886
- Know what I mean? - I have a vague idea.

478
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,139
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you, gratitudewise.

479
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,768
- Oh, I'm very grateful. - Then why are you locking us out?

480
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:29,482
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few weeks, what with my cold and ... like that.

481
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,443
We went to bat for you. Now you won't play ball with us.

482
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,906
After all, it's my apartment. It's private property, not a public playground.

483
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:41,285
So you got yourself a girl. That's OK with us. But not every night in the week!

484
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,162
How selfish can you get?

485
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:47,083
Last week I had to use my nephew's car and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

486
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,253
I'm too old for that sort of thing - I mean in a Volkswagen.

487
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,673
I sympathise with you. Believe me, I'm very sorry.

488
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,093
- You'll be a lot sorrier. - Are you threatening me?

489
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,346
Listen, Baxter. We made you and we can break you.

490
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,475
- Good morning, Mr Sheldrake. - Good morning, gentlemen.

491
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,729
- Baxter, do you like your office? - Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.

492
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,774
Don't thank me. Your friends here recommended you.

493
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,695
- We just dropped by to wish him luck. - We know you won't let us down.

494
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,658
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open ... to my office.

495
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,536
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

496
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,247
- How does it feel to be an executive? - Oh, fine.

497
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,209
- I'll work hard to justify your confidence. - I'm sure you will.

498
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:35,131
About the apartment. Now that you've got a raise, can't we afford a second key?

499
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,675
- I guess so. - You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?

500
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,636
- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that ... ? - Oh, no, no.

501
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:46,058
I just meant that she's kind of a busybody, and passing that key back and forth ...

502
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,811
- Why take chances? - You can't be too careful.

503
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,981
Oh, I ... have something I think belongs to you.

504
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,650
- Me? - I mean the young lady, whoever she is.

505
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,528
- I found it when I got back last night. - Oh. Thanks.

506
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,240
The mirror is broken. It was broken when I found it.

507
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,703
- Yeah. She threw it at me. - Sir?

508
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,331
You know how it is. They always give you a bad time.

509
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,540
Yeah, I know how it is.

510
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:14,420
You see a girl every week for laughs and they think you're gonna divorce your wife.

511
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,757
- Now I ask you, is that fair? - No, sir. It's very unfair.

512
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,926
- Especially to your wife. - Yeah.

513
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:24,889
You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor, all the dames you want, no complications.

514
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,599
That's the life all right.

515
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,018
- Put me down for Thursday again. - Roger.

516
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,437
And I'll get that other key.

517
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:47,453
- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you. - Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

518
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,622
Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.

519
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,791
Yeah? Yeah?!

520
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,042
Where?

521
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,418
You bet!

522
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,965
Somebody watch my line. There's a swingin' party on the 19th floor!

523
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,178
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

524
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:08,099
Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

525
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,477
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

[singing continues]

527
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:33,165
So I said to him "Never again. Either you get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."

528
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,085
Miss Kubelik? Miss ...

529
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,462
- Merry Christmas. - Thank you.

530
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,674
- I thought you were avoiding me. - What gave you that idea?

531
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:45,594
In six weeks you've only been in my elevator once, and you kept on your hat.

532
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,181
As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt that night you stood me up.

533
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,350
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

534
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,102
- I forgive you. - You shouldn't.

535
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:56,689
You couldn't help it. You can't suddenly walk out on one man ...

536
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,066
.. because you have a date with another man.

537
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,610
- You did the decent thing. - Don't be too sure.

538
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,197
Just because I wear a uniform, that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

539
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:10,119
A second administrative assistant has to be a pretty good judge of character.

540
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,705
And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

541
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:17,543
I mean decencywise and ... otherwisewise.

542
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,837
Cheers.

543
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,841
- One more. - I shouldn't drink while driving.

544
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:29,055
You're so right. By the power vested in me, I declare this elevator out of order.

545
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,557
Shall we join the natives?

546
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:35,227
- Why not? They seem friendly enough. - Don't you believe it.

547
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:39,523
There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar workers tossed into computers ...

548
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,901
.. and punched full of little square holes.

549
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,236
- How many drinks did you have? - Three!

550
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,573
- I thought so. - Wait. I hear the sound of running water.

551
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,367
- I'll be right back! - I'll be right here.

552
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,412
[slurring] Hi!

553
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,165
How's the branch manager from Kansas City?

554
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,000
- I beg your pardon? - I'm Miss Olsen.

555
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,086
Mr Sheldrake's secretary.

556
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,588
So you don't have to play innocent with me.

557
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,759
He used to tell his wife I was the branch manager from Seattle ...

558
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:11,222
.. four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding-ding.

559
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:16,227
- I don't know what you're talking about. - Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.

560
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,021
And after me it was Miss Koch in Disability.

561
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,524
And right before you was a Miss, um ...

562
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,026
Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.

563
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:27,696
- Would you excuse me? - What for? You haven't done anything.

564
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,117
It's him. Oh, what a salesman!

565
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,036
Always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant...

566
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:37,289
.. and the same pitch about divorcing his wife.

567
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,796
Then, in the end, you wind up with egg foo yung on your face.

568
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,090
Miss Kubelik!

569
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,885
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

570
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:54,223
Always happy to do a little something for our girls in uniform.

571
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,476
Are you all right? What's the matter?

572
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,229
Nothing. There are just too many people here.

573
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:04,316
Why don't we step into my office? There's something I want your opinion about.

574
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:09,238
I have my own office now. I'm the second youngest executive in this company.

575
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:13,159
The only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.

576
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,454
[whistles] Do you mind?

577
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,086
Miss Kubelik, I would like your honest opinion.

578
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:27,506
I've had this under my desk for a week. It cost me $15.

579
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,010
I haven't been able to get up enough nerve to wear it.

580
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,645
It's what they call the Junior Executive model. What do you think?

581
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,943
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

582
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,321
- I like it. - Really?

583
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,365
You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in this hat?

584
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:57,494
- Of course not. - Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.

585
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,372
- Is that better? - Much better.

586
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,209
Since you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me, ...

587
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,462
.. how about gain' out tonight - you, me and the bowler?

588
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,381
We'll stroll down 5th Avenue, sort of break it in.

589
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:13,385
- This is a bad day for me. - I understand. Christmas and family.

590
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,888
I'd better get back to my elevator or I'll be fired.

591
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:19,892
Don't worry about that. I've got quite a bit of influence with Personnel.

592
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,144
You know Mr Sheldrake?

593
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,898
- Why? - He and I are like that.

594
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,817
Sent me a Christmas card. See?

595
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,243
Makes a cute picture.

596
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,871
I could talk to Mr Sheldrake. Get you a promotion.

597
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:46,752
- Would you like to be an elevator starter? - Too many girls have seniority over me.

598
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,214
No problem. Why don't we discuss it over the holidays?

599
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:54,760
I could call you, pick you up, have a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?

600
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,054
I think so. Here.

You're gonna wear yourself out.

757
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,443
- Not so rough, honey! - Good night.

758
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,612
- Good night?! - The party's over.

759
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,948
What? Did I do somethin' wrong?

760
01:07:57,115 --> 01:08:00,410
It's an emergency. I'll see you some other time.

761
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,620
Not this one. In there, Doc.

762
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:07,292
- What's gain' on here, anyway? - Will you please just get out?!

My shoes!

764
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:12,130
Some lover you are! Some sexpot!

765
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,966
Here. Find a phone. Call your husband in Havana.

766
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:20,596
You bet I will! And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in!

767
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,807
You fink!

768
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,325
Is she gonna be all right, Doc?

769
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:44,495
- How many pills were in that bottle? - It was half-full. About a dozen.

770
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,665
- Do you have to take her to the hospital? - Help me, will you?

771
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,418
- Into the bathroom. - What are you gonna do?

772
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:53,338
Get that stuff out of her stomach if it isn't too late.

773
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:56,215
You'd better put some coffee on, and pray.

[Fran vomits and coughs]

Bring my bag.

776
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,076
Roll up her right sleeve.

777
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,921
Hold that.

778
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,972
Nice veins.

779
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:40,486
Wanna tell me what happened?

780
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,364
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.

781
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:50,121
You see, we had ... some words earlier.

782
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:54,459
It was nothin' serious. You might call it a lovers' quarrel.

783
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,296
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.

784
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:03,259
- Something like that. - You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.

785
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,969
Yes, you are.

786
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:18,316
If you'd come home half an hour later, you'd have had quite a Christmas present.

What's her name?

Miss Kubelik. Fran.

794
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:34,308
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

Fran, I'm Dr Dreyfuss. I'm here to help you.

798
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:45,027
You took all those sleeping pills. Remember?

799
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,824
- Sleeping pills. - That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

800
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,536
- Doctor? - Dr Dreyfuss.

Now tell me again. What's my name?

Dr ... Dreyfuss.

I...

807
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:15,391
I took sleeping pills.

Do you know where you are?

I don't know.

Do you know who that is?

Look at him.

01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,419
Mr Baxter. 19th floor.

Hello, Miss Kubelik.

Mr? Miss? Such politeness!

We work in the same building. We try to keep it quiet.

What are you doing here?

818
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:04,023
Don't you remember we were together at the office party?

819
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,567
Oh, yes. The office party.

- Miss Olsen. - That's right.

821
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:12,365
I told you we had a fight. That was what it was about.

822
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:15,910
Miss Olsen. That girl that was here earlier.

823
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:20,164
I don't understand.

824
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:25,711
The main thing is I got here in time and you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?

01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,839
I'm so tired.

Come on.Drinkthis.

Please ... just let me sleep.

No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!

Let's get her walking.

We've got to keep her awake for the next few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!

One, two ... And return again.

And ... left, right, left, right.

She'll sleep on and off for the next 24 hours.

840

Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

841
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,901
Just as long as she's OK.

842
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:36,407
These cases are harder on the doctor than the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.

843
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:39,702
- Any of that coffee left? - Yeah, sure.

844
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,080
How do you spell her last name?

846
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,918
What's her address?

847
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,755
Where does she live?

848
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,216
Why do you wanna know, Doc?

849
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:58,387
- You don't have to report this, do you? - It's regulations.

850
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:03,476
But it was an accident. She had too much to drink, didn't know what she was doing.

851
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,770
There was no suicide note or anything.

852
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:09,065
- I'm not thinkin' about myself. - Aren't you?

853
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:12,651
She's got a family, and there's the people at the office.

854
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:16,697
Can't you forget you're a doctor, just say you're here as a neighbour?

855
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,742
Well, as a doctor, I can't prove it wasn't an accident.

856
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:23,037
But as your neighbour, I'd like to kick you around the block.

857
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,748
- Mind if I cool this off? - Help yourself.

858
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,292
I don't know what you did to that girl, ...

859
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,961
.. but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on.

Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch.

862
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,971
- You know what that means? - I'm not sure.

863
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,265
A mensch/ A human being!

864
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:47,186
SO you got off easy this time. So you were lucky.

865
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:52,066
But you're not out of the woods yet, because most of 'em try it again.

866
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,694
Well, you know where I am if you need me.

867
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,519
Mr Baxter! Open up already.

868
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,691
Oh.

01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,447
What was going on here last night?

871
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:24,950
- Last night? - All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!

872
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:28,704
- Army manoeuvres maybe? - I'll never invite those people again.

873
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:33,042
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.

874
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:38,714
- And I'm sure you woke up Dr Dreyfuss. - Don't worry. He was out on a case.

875
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:43,969
I'm warning you, Mr Baxter. This is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.

876
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,222
Come on, Oscar.

881
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,267
I'll get the phone.

882
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,354
Hey, Dad, why don't we put a fly in the nose cone?

883
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:38,399
- See if we can bring it back alive. - That's a thought.

884
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:42,611
Maybe we should put in two flies and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

885
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,907
- See if they'll what? - Propagate. You know. Multiply.

886
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:50,828
- Baby flies? - Oh. Oh!

887
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,164
- It's for you, Dad. - Thanks, Jeff.

888
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:57,501
A Mr Baxter. Person-to-person.

889
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:00,254
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

890
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:06,010
- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter? - Something came up that's important.

891
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:09,513
I think you should see me at the apartment as soon as possible.

892
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:13,350
- What's this all about? - I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.

893
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:18,605
But that certain party ... You know who I mean. I found her here last night.

894
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,942
- She took an overdose of sleeping pills. - What?!

895
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:27,239
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone? - One of our employees had an accident.

896
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:30,784
I don't know why they bother me with these things on Christmas Day.

897
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,745
Yes, Baxter.

898
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,205
Just how serious is it?

899
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:39,001
It was touch and go there for a while, but she's sleeping it off now.

900
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,212
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.

901
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:47,676
That's impossible. You'll have to handle the situation yourself, Baxter.

902
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:52,222
- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you. - Yes, sir. I understand.

903
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:56,727
She left a letter. Would you like me to open it and read it to you?

904
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:59,563
Well, it was just a suggestion.

905
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:03,609
No, don't worry. I kept your name out of it, so there'll be no trouble, ...

906
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,320
.. policewise or newspaperwise.

907
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:11,867
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine, so we were very lucky in that respect.

908
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,536
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

909
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,581
No, he just jumped to the conclusion.

910
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:20,542
Around here I'm known as quite a ladies' man.

911
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:24,922
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet. Sometimes they try it again.

912
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:28,926
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her a couple of days to fully recover ...

913
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:32,429
.. and I may have a little problem with the landlady.

914
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:36,558
Alright, Mr Sheldrake. I'll keep her in the apartment as long as I can.

915
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:40,270
Isn't there some sort of message you want me to give her?

916
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,940
Well, I'll ... think of something.

917
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:45,651
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr Sheldrake.

918
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,614
I'm sorry.

919
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,910
- I'm sorry, Mr Baxter. - What are you doing out of bed?

920
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:58,247
I didn't know. I had no idea this was your apartment.

921
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:01,125
Here. Let me help you.

922
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,627
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

923
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,796
Why didn't you just let me die?

924
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:11,468
What kind of talk is that? You got a little overemotional, but you're fine now.

925
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,095
Oh!

926
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:17,516
Oh, my head! It feels just like a big wad of chewing gum.

927
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:20,436
- What time is it? - Two o'clock.

928
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,813
Oh, my dress. I have to go home.

929
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,399
You're in no shape to go anywhere but back to bed.

930
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,985
- You don't want me here. - Sure I do. 1...

931
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:31,280
It's always nice to have company for Christmas.

932
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:34,950
- I'm stronger than you are. - I just wanna brush my teeth.

933
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:38,620
Oh. Of course. I think I can find a new toothbrush somewhere.

934
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,498
Here. Put that on.

935
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:13,864
- How about some breakfast? - No. I don't want anything.

936
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,033
I'll fix you some coffee.

937
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,496
Oh! We're all out of coffee. You had quite a lot last night.

938
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,706
Back in a minute.

939
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,384
Mrs Dreyfuss, could I borrow some coffee?

940
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:38,347
- And an orange and a couple of eggs? - Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!

941
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:42,976
What you need is a good horsewhipping! From me the doctor has no secrets.

942
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:45,354
Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?

943
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,523
I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...

944
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:54,821
You take a girl out just for laughs and she thinks you're serious marriagewise.

945
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:58,408
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!

946
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:01,745
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

947
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,922
Who are you calling?

948
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:14,216
My sister, to tell her what happened to me.

949
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:19,388
Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first. Just what are you gonna tell her?

950
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:24,059
- I haven't figured it out exactly. - Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.

951
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:27,271
Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night.

952
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:29,356
I'll say I spent the night with a friend.

953
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:31,525
- Who? - Someone from the office.

954
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,443
- Where are you now? - In his apartment.

955
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,946
- In his apartment? - In her apartment.

956
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:38,282
- What's your friend's name? - Baxter.

957
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:41,535
- What's her first name? - Miss.

958
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:44,454
- When are you comin' home? - As soon as I can walk.

959
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:46,623
- Your legs hurt? - No, my stomach.

960
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:49,584
- Your stomach? - They had to pump it out!

961
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:54,631
You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you get the chewing gum out of your head.

962
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,926
They'll be worried about me. They might call the police.

963
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,263
We have to be careful. We don't wanna involve anybody.

964
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:04,516
After all, Mr Sheldrake's a married man.

965
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,436
Thanks for reminding me[!]

966
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,150
I didn't mean it that way.

967
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:17,446
I was just talking to him on the phone. He's very concerned about you.

968
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:20,324
He doesn't give a damn about me.

969
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:24,161
- You're wrong. He told me ... - He's a liar.

970
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:26,580
But that's not the worst part.

971
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:29,166
The worst part is I still love him.

972
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,127
[doorbell]

973
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,339
Oh. That must be Mrs Dreyfuss.

974
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:39,009
Remember the doctor from last night? That's his wife.

975
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,763
So where's the victim?

976
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:45,849
Max the Knife!

977
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:52,648
- Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today? - I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

978
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:58,153
The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup with chicken white meat and a glass tea.

979
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,699
- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry. - Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.

980
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:05,786
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?

981
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:09,122
- I have some paper towels. - Beatnik.

982
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,709
In my kitchen, third drawer, under the good silver, are napkins.

983
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,211
Yes, Mrs Dreyfuss.

984
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:17,005
So, what are you waiting for? A singing commercial?

985
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,174
- I can't eat. - You must eat.

986
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:22,427
And you must get healthy and you must forget him.

987
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:25,889
Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here.

988
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,017
Clean and cut, a regular Ivy Leaguer.

989
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:33,563
Turns out he's King Farouk, with the drinking, with the cha-cha.

990
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,732
With the no napkins.

991
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:39,903
A girl like you, for the rest of your life you wanna cry in your noodle soup?

992
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:42,656
Who needs it? Now you listen to me.

993
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:46,910
You'll find yourself a nice, substantial man - a widower, maybe -

994
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:50,747
and settle down, instead of noshing all those sleeping pills.

995
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:54,042
For what? For whom? For some good-time Charlie?

996
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,086
- [door opens] - Shh.

997
01:26:56,253 --> 01:27:00,257
One napkin comin' up. Wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.

998
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:03,552
- What did I tell you? - Mrs Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.

999
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:07,597
- I'll wash the dishes. - You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.

1000
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:10,350
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

1001
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:15,439
- She doesn't seem to like you very much. - Oh, I don't mind.

1002
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:18,108
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.

1003
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:23,488
That anybody'd think a girl like you would do a thing like this over a guy like me.

1004
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,743
Did you find something here? An envelope?

1005
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:29,453
Yes. I've got it.

1006
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:33,957
Don't you think we'd better destroy it so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

1007
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:36,209
Open it.

1008
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,382
There's nothing here but a $100 bill.

1009
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:45,969
That's right. Will you see that Mr Sheldrake gets it?

1010
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,139
Sure.

1011
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,726
Take this away, will you?

1012
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:56,188
Would you like me to move the television set in here?

1013
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:59,107
- You play gin rummy? - I'm not very good at it.

1014
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:03,236
- I am. Let me get the cards. - You don't have to entertain me.

1015
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:07,115
There's nothing I'd like better. You know. Togetherness.

1016
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:11,953
Guess what I did last Christmas. Had dinner at the automat, went to the zoo, ...

1017
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,831
.. then came home and cleaned up after Mr Eichelberger.

1018
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,334
He had a little eggnog party here.

1019
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,795
So I'm way ahead this year.

1020
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,672
Three across. Spades double?

1021
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:24,883
High deals.

1022
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,636
Six? Eight.

1023
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:38,522
I think I'm gonna give it all up.

1024
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,525
Give what up?

1025
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:47,531
Why do people have to love people, anyway?

1026
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:51,034
I know what you mean.

1027
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:56,331
Queen.

1028
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,545
- I don't want it. - Pick a card.

1029
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:10,679
What do you call it when somebody keeps gettin' smashed up in car accidents?

1030
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:14,182
- Bad insurance risk? - That's me with men.

1031
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:20,564
I was jinxed from the word go. First time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

1032
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,816
A cemetery?

1033
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:25,694
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

1034
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:30,031
His name was George and he threw me over for a drum majorette.

1035
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,535
Uh,gin.

1036
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:42,168
That's 10, 20 ... 36. And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.

1037
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:44,379
I have this talent for falling in love ...

1038
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:48,049
.. with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1039
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:50,927
Well, how many guys were there?

1040
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:53,930
Three.

1041
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:58,018
The last one was the manager of a finance company back home in Pittsburgh.

1042
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:00,186
They found a shortage in his accounts.

1043
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:04,107
He asked me to wait for him. He'll be out in 1965.

1044
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,736
Cut.

1045
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:13,408
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband, a cab driver.

1046
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:18,413
They sent me to secretarial school and then I applied for a job at Consolidated.

1047
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,749
But I flunked the typing test.

1048
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:23,627
- Too slow? - No. I can type up a storm.

1049
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,921
I just can't spell.

1050
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:31,968
So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator.

1051
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:34,638
And that's how I met Jeff.

1052
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:38,433
Oh God, I'm so fouled up.

1053
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,061
What am I gonna do now?

1054
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,482
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1055
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:49,903
Was he very upset when you told him?

1056
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,155
Mr Sheldrake? Yeah, very.

1057
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:57,077
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.

1058
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,662
I'm sure that's it.

1059
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:02,207
- You really think so? - No doubt about it.

1060
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,835
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1061
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:09,005
- What for? - I'm gonna write to Mrs Sheldrake.

1062
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,508
- You what? - As one woman to another.

1063
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:15,595
- I'm sure she'll understand. - I don't think that's a very good idea.

1064
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:19,140
- Why not? - For one thing, you can't spell.

1065
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:23,478
Secondly, if you did something like that, you'd hate yourself.

1066
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:27,315
I don't like myself very much anyway.

1067
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,611
Pick up the cards. Let's go.

1068
01:31:31,778 --> 01:31:34,864
- Do I have to? - You bet. I got a terrific ha nd.

1069
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:44,457
- You really wanna discard that? - Sure.

1070
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,501
Gin.

1071
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,630
[hums nervously]

1072
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:55,802
10, 20,40, 52 and 25 ... 77.

1073
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,015
Spades are double ... 154.

1074
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,230
Blitzed. Two games.

1075
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,752
[Sylvia hums along to dance music]

1076
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,147
[doorbell]

1077
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:40,657
- [doorbell] - All right, all right, Mrs Dreyfuss.

1078
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:50,291
- Hi, Baxter. - What do you want?

1079
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,460
What do I want? Just a minute.

1080
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,255
- You can't come in! - What's the matter with you?

1081
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:57,465
I made a reservation for four o'clock.

1082
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,884
You can't stay. Take your champagne and go.

1083
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:03,555
I don't wanna pull rank on you, but I told the little lady it was all set.

1084
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:07,517
Are you gonna leave, Mr Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?

1085
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:11,145
[sniggers] Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?

1086
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:14,482
- Got yourself a little playmate, huh? - Now will you get out?

1087
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:16,693
[Sylvia hums dance music]

1088
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:23,491
Hey, come on! What are we waiting for? Open up, will you?

1089
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:25,702
[Dr Dreyfuss] Mildred!

1090
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:31,708
- What's holding things up? - Say, let's have a party, the four of us.

1091
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:33,960
No!

1092
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,383
[sniggers] Well, I don't blame you.

1093
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,553
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid? I mean Kubelikwise.

1094
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,222
Don't worry. I won't say a word to anybody.

1095
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:48,641
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

1096
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:05,742
Who was that?

1097
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:09,996
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?

1098
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:13,541
Would you mind opening that window?

1099
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:21,591
- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik. - I just want some fresh air.

1100
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:25,094
It's only one storey down. The best you could do is break a leg.

1101
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:28,014
So they'll shoot me, like a horse.

1102
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:31,601
Please, you gotta promise me you won't do anything foolish.

1103
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:34,270
- Who'd care? - I would.

1104
01:35:40,026 --> 01:35:43,947
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?

1105
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:46,950
Yeah. Well ...

1106
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:50,578
That's the way it crumbles, cookiewise.

1107
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:54,415
Go to sleep.

1108
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:33,329
- [women] Good morning, Mr Sheldrake. - Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.

1109
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:46,634
- Did you have a nice Christmas? - Lovely. You were a great help[!]

1110
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,429
Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.

1111
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:54,183
- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor. - I thought you could hold your tongue.

1112
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,853
- It won't happen again. - You bet it won't.

1113
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,939
I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay.

1114
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:03,151
That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.

1115
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,362
You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

1116
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:10,950
And were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.

1117
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:14,203
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.

1118
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,497
Yes, Mr Sheldrake.

1119
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:29,385
Operator, this is Mr Sheldrake. I'd like Mr Baxter's home telephone number.

1120
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:32,513
He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

1121
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:52,408
- [Baxter] Hello? - Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?

1122
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:54,911
Yes. She's in the shower.

1123
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:57,747
- She's coming along fine, considering. - Good.

1124
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:01,501
- Is there anything you need? Money? - No, thank you, Mr Sheldrake.

1125
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:04,796
As a matter of fact, I have some money for you. $100.

1126
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:06,339
Oh.

1127
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:10,301
- If there's anything I can do for you ... - For me? I don't think so.

1128
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:13,262
But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her.

1129
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:16,849
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter.

1130
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:19,268
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

1131
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,022
Well ... at least you can talk to her.

1132
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:27,735
Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.

1133
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:30,863
There's a call for you!

1134
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:33,533
- For me? - Yeah. Mr Sheldrake.

1135
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,453
I don't wanna talk to him.

1136
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,539
I think you should.

1137
01:38:39,705 --> 01:38:45,086
I gotta run down to the grocery anyway. There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.

1138
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,964
I'll be right back. OK?

1139
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:10,486
Hello, Jeff.

1140
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:15,032
- Yes, I'm all right. - Why did you do it, Fran?

1141
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,660
It's so childish, and it never solves anything.

1142
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:20,496
I oughta be very angry with you, scaring me that way.

1143
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:25,376
But let's forget the whole thing, pretend it never happened. What do you say?

1144
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:27,670
Fran?

1145
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:30,673
Are you there, Fran?

1146
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:36,554
Of course I'm not here, because the whole thing never happened.

1147
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:40,558
I never took those pills, I never loved you, ...

1148
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:43,019
.. we never even met.

1149
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:48,191
- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff? - You know I didn't mean it that way.

1150
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:51,110
You just get well. Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.

1151
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:54,405
I'll see you as soon as I can. Goodbye, Fran.

1152
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:15,259
Hello, Mrs Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.

1153
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:19,639
Fine, thank you. I was wondering if we could have lunch together.

1154
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:24,143
I don't know how important it is, but you might find it educational.

1155
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:26,979
It concerns your husband.

1156
01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:30,900
All right. One o'clock, Longchamps, Madison and 59th.

1157
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:39,408
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

1158
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:41,619
Just making a personal call.

1159
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:45,373
Here's a dime.

1160
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,752
Going down.

1161
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:04,642
Oh, Mr Baxter! I'm glad you're here.

1162
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:07,436
- I was just going to get the passkey. - What for?

1163
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:10,356
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.

1164
01:41:10,523 --> 01:41:12,608
Gas?!

1165
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,786
Miss Kubelik?

1166
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:27,665
Miss Kubelik!

1167
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:32,461
- You all right? - Sure!

1168
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:36,465
- What's that funny smell? - Gas! Didn't you turn it on?

1169
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:39,552
Yes, to boil water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.

1170
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:43,139
- You turned it on but you didn't light it. - Are you supposed to?

1171
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:47,059
In this house you're supposed to. Hey, what are you doing with that?

1172
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:50,646
I was washing my stockings, so I thought I'd wash your socks too.

1173
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:54,942
- Oh. Thank you. - Very curious. I could only find 3?pair.

1174
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:57,612
Things are a little disorganised around here.

1175
01:41:57,778 --> 01:42:01,574
I'd say. What's a tennis racket doing in the kitchen?

1176
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:06,662
Tennis racket? Oh, I remember. I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.

1177
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:09,498
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1178
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:12,209
- Why not? - In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.

1179
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:15,171
- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper. - Yes, you are.

1180
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:19,675
When I was straightening up the couch, I found six hairpins, a lipstick, ...

1181
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:23,512
.. a pair of false eyelashes and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1182
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:26,932
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no.

1183
01:42:27,099 --> 01:42:31,187
- I don't mean to girls. I mean ... - To someone like Mr Sheldrake.

1184
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:34,440
- I guess so. - I know so.

1185
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:38,611
- He's a taker. - What?

1186
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:41,364
Some people take, some people get took.

1187
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:45,534
And they know they're gettin' took and there's nothin' they can do about it.

1188
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:47,787
I wouldn't say that.

1189
01:42:48,537 --> 01:42:50,539
What would you like for dinner, huh?

1190
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:53,876
Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus ...

1191
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:56,003
I really should be getting home.

1192
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:59,131
- My family'li be flipping by now. - You can't leave yet.

1193
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:03,719
The doctor said it takes 48 hours to get that stuff out of your system.

1194
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:09,016
How long does it take to get someone you're stuck on out of your system?

1195
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:12,103
If only they'd invent some kind of pump for that.

1196
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:17,900
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world. But it's not.

1197
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:20,569
I went through exactly the same thing myself.

1198
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:22,655
- You did? - Well, not exactly the same.

1199
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:24,573
I tried to do it with a gun.

1200
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:27,785
- Over a girl? - Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.

1201
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:32,957
And I was mad about her. But I knew it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.

1202
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:37,253
I went to a pawnshop and I bought a .45 automatic and I drove up to Eden Park ...

1203
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:39,463
- Do you know Cincinnati? - No, I don't.

1204
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:42,258
Anyway, I parked the car and I loaded that gun ...

1205
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:46,762
You read in the papers that people shoot themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.

1206
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:50,599
I mean, how do you do it? Here? Here? Here?

1207
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:54,603
- Know where I finally shot myself? - Where?

1208
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,605
- Here. - In the knee?!

1209
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,275
Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.

1210
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:01,777
A cop came up because I was illegally parked.

1211
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:05,281
I tried to hide the gun under the seat and it went off.

1212
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:09,076
- That's terrible! - It was a year till I could bend the knee.

1213
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:12,413
But I got over the girl in three weeks.

1214
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:17,668
Still lives in Cincinnati. Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1215
01:44:17,835 --> 01:44:20,212
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1216
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:22,798
Are you just making this up to make me feel better?

1217
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:24,967
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1218
01:44:25,134 --> 01:44:27,303
- Do you wanna see my knee? - No, thank you.

1219
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:30,723
The fellas in the office might get the wrong idea how I found out.

1220
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:34,977
Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.

1221
01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:38,355
You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for today.

1222
01:44:38,522 --> 01:44:41,817
- Yes, Nurse. - [Baxter hums opera music]

1223
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:59,168
- Can I help you? - I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.

1224
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:04,507
- So am I. She didn't report this morning. - She didn't? Who's in charge here?

1225
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:08,969
That comes under General Office Administration. Mr Dobisch, 21st floor.

1226
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:10,930
Thanks.

1227
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:17,853
So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.

1228
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,271
- Who? - Kubelik.

1229
01:45:19,438 --> 01:45:22,525
No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik having a little toot?

1230
01:45:22,691 --> 01:45:27,196
Toot? More like a lost weekend. Neither of 'em showed up for work today.

1231
01:45:27,363 --> 01:45:28,948
AWOL, hm?

1232
01:45:29,114 --> 01:45:31,659
What gripes me is they guzzled my champagne ...

1233
01:45:31,825 --> 01:45:35,412
.. while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.

1234
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:39,124
- Mr Dobisch? - Yeah.

1235
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:44,296
I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.

1236
01:45:44,463 --> 01:45:45,923
- Miss Kubelik? - You know her?

1237
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:49,927
Of course. We have a lot of employees, but we're one big, happy family.

1238
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:55,224
She lives with us, and my wife's nervous cos Fran hasn't been home for two days.

1239
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:56,725
That so?

1240
01:45:56,892 --> 01:45:59,895
So we wondered if somebody here knew what happened to her.

1241
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:01,480
I see.

1242
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:05,234
What do you think, AI? Can we help the man?

1243
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:08,779
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.

1244
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:12,491
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?

1245
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:17,037
Who is Buddy-boy?

[hums opera music]

1247

1248
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:49,361
- You're pretty good with that racket. - You should see my backhand.

1249
01:46:51,363 --> 01:46:54,325
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.

1250

You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe.

Shipwrecked, among eight people.

1260

And then one day I saw a footprint in the sand ...

..and there you were.

1262

It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.

1263
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:41,497
- Do you usually eat alone? - No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.

1264
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:44,416
Or sometimes Dinah Shore or Perry Como.

1265

The other night it was Mae West. She was much younger then. Cheers.

- Cheers. - Know what we're gonna do after dinner?

- The dishes. - I mean after that.

1275
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:28,877
- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs. - Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...

1276

It's none of my business what you do. You're over 21.

How about some spaghetti with meat sauce that I cooked myself?

Oh, uh ... I'm fine, Doc.

Not you. Miss Kubelik.

I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik off your hands.

The plain fact is, I love her.

I thought you should be the first to know.

1315

After all, you don't really want her, and I do.

1316
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:38,317
And though it may sound presumptuous, she needs somebody like me.

- So I think it would be best all around. - [phone rings]

But, thanks to you, I'm in a financial position to marry her.

- All your troubles are over. - Sir?

1338
01:52:42,631 --> 01:52:45,801
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.

1339
01:52:45,968 --> 01:52:48,804
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1340
01:52:48,971 --> 01:52:51,807
- You're gonna take her off my hands? - That's right.

1341
01:52:51,974 --> 01:52:54,476
I've moved out of the house.

1342
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:58,355
I'm gonna be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.

1343
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:01,483
- You left your wife. - If you must know, I fired my secretary.

1344
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:06,446
My secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

1345
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,156
Yeah.

1346
01:53:08,323 --> 01:53:10,242
Now what's your news, Baxter?

1347
01:53:12,369 --> 01:53:16,039
It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling all right again so she went home.

1348
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:19,334
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me_

1349
01:53:19,501 --> 01:53:21,545
This way, Baxter.

1350
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:27,342
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1351
01:53:28,343 --> 01:53:30,846
- You like? It's all yours. - Mine?

My assistant has been shifted to the Denver office and you're taking his place.

1353
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:38,770
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited.

1354
01:53:38,937 --> 01:53:43,191
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast.

1355
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:46,069
I'm very pleased. Especially for Miss Kubelik.

1356
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:51,199
think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to ... someone.

1357
01:53:51,366 --> 01:53:56,872
Sure, sure. But first the property has to be settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1358
01:53:57,039 --> 01:53:59,875
Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.

Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch in the executive dining room.

01:54:03,628 --> 01:54:06,256
That's one of the privileges that goes with this job.

1361
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:11,011
You also get a nice little expense account, use of the executive washroom ...

1362
01:54:11,178 --> 01:54:13,555
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1363
01:54:13,722 --> 01:54:16,475
- I got kicked in the head too. - Oh?

1364
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:39,623
Good evening, Mr Baxter.

1365
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,249
Oh.

1366
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:44,169
Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?

1367
01:54:44,336 --> 01:54:47,005
- I feel fine. How's your eye? - Oh, fine.

1368
01:54:47,172 --> 01:54:49,966
- How are things at the apartment? - Nothing's changed.

1369
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:53,136
- We never did finish that gin game. - I know.

1370
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:57,140
I suppose you heard about Mr Sheldrake.

1371
01:54:57,307 --> 01:54:59,851
Leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.

1372
01:55:00,018 --> 01:55:02,604
- I never thought he'd do it. - I told you all along.

1373
01:55:02,771 --> 01:55:06,233
- You were wrong about Mr Sheldrake. - I guess so.

1374
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,401
You were wrong about me too.

1375
01:55:08,568 --> 01:55:11,696
What you said about those who take and those who get took.

1376
01:55:11,863 --> 01:55:15,033
Mr Sheldrake wasn't using me. I was using him. See?

1377
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:19,663
Last month I was at desk 861 on the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.

1378
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,832
A panelled office, three windows.

1379
01:55:21,998 --> 01:55:25,001
So it all worked out fine. We're both getting what we wanted.

1380
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:28,046
Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?

1381
01:55:28,213 --> 01:55:33,969
No, thank you. Well, I ... To tell you the truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.

1382
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:40,725
- Aren't you meeting Mr Sheldrake? - No. You know how people talk.

1383
01:55:40,892 --> 01:55:46,148
I decided it was best not to see each other until everything was settled, divorcewise.

1384
01:55:46,314 --> 01:55:48,400
That's very wise.

1385
01:55:49,484 --> 01:55:51,987
- Good night, Mr Baxter. - Good night.

1386
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:31,359
- Baxter, could you step in here a minute? - Yes, Mr Sheldrake.

1387
01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:33,570
- There you are. - Much obliged.

1388
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:41,203
Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37% of females leave to get married and 22% ...

1389
01:56:41,369 --> 01:56:44,289
Baxter, you work too hard. It's New Year's Eve. Relax!

1390
01:56:44,456 --> 01:56:47,417
- Yes, sir. - I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.

1391
01:56:47,584 --> 01:56:49,753
- Naturally. - I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1392
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,922
- I finally talked her into it. - I see.

1393
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:56,426
The only thing is, I'm staying at the Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so ...

1394
01:56:56,593 --> 01:56:58,762
If you don't mind?

1395
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:03,058
- Don't mind what? - You know my key to your apartment?

1396
01:57:03,225 --> 01:57:06,394
When we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, ...

1397
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:10,565
- .. I threw it out the window of the train. - Very clever.

1398
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:13,068
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1399
01:57:14,528 --> 01:57:17,322
- Sorry, Mr Sheldrake. - What do you mean, sorry?

1400
01:57:17,489 --> 01:57:19,866
You're not bringing anybody to my apartment.

1401
01:57:20,033 --> 01:57:24,371
- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik. - Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1402
01:57:24,537 --> 01:57:27,791
- How's that again? - No key.

1403
01:57:29,626 --> 01:57:34,214
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man.

1404
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:37,801
Do you realise what you're doing? Not to me, but to yourself?

1405
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:41,304
Normally it takes years to work your way up to the 27th floor.

1406
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:44,474
But it only takes 30 seconds to be out on the street again.

1407
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:47,269
- You dig? - I dig.

1408
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:50,480
So what's it going to be?

1409
01:57:57,237 --> 01:58:00,365
- Now you're being bright. - Thank you, sir.

1410
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:20,427
- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key. - No, I didn't.

1411
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:23,221
But this is the key to the executive washroom.

1412
01:58:23,388 --> 01:58:27,142
That's right. I won't be needing it because I'm all washed up around here.

1413
01:58:27,309 --> 01:58:30,687
- What's gotten into you? - Just following doctor's orders.

1414
01:58:30,854 --> 01:58:35,066
I've decided to become a mensch. Know what that means? A human being.

1415
01:58:35,233 --> 01:58:39,154
- Now hold on, Baxter. - The old payola won't work any more.

1416
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:41,406
Goodbye, Mr Sheldrake.

1417
01:59:11,019 --> 01:59:13,104
[doorbell]

1418
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:20,904
- We're having a party and ran out of ice. - Sure, Doc.

1419
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:23,156
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?

1420
01:59:23,323 --> 01:59:25,241
Well, I got things to do.

1421
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:29,579
- What's this? You're packing? - Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1422
01:59:29,746 --> 01:59:31,581
Where are you moving to?

1423
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:34,751
I don't know. All I know is I gotta get outta this place.

1424
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:36,920
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1425
01:59:37,087 --> 01:59:41,800
Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.

1426
01:59:41,966 --> 01:59:45,136
- Could you use some champagne? - Booze we don't need.

1427
01:59:45,303 --> 01:59:47,097
Say, why don't you join us?

1428
01:59:47,263 --> 01:59:52,227
We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist and three nurses from Bellevue.

1429
01:59:52,394 --> 01:59:54,312
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1430
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:58,692
In case I don't see you again, how much do lowe you for taking care of that girl?

1431
01:59:58,858 --> 02:00:02,695
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor. I did it as a neighbour.

1432
02:00:02,862 --> 02:00:05,573
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1433
02:00:06,825 --> 02:00:09,786
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go.

1434
02:00:09,953 --> 02:00:12,664
- Goodbye, Doc. - Happy New Year.

1435
02:00:42,277 --> 02:00:44,195
[lively music and chatter]

1436
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:58,460
Sorry I took so long on the phone. We're all set.

1437
02:00:58,626 --> 02:01:01,045
- For what? - I rented a car. It'll be here at one.

1438
02:01:01,212 --> 02:01:04,048
- We're driving to Atlantic City. - Atlantic City?

1439
02:01:04,215 --> 02:01:08,803
I know it's a drag, but you can't find a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.

1440
02:01:09,804 --> 02:01:12,640
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.

1441
02:01:12,807 --> 02:01:15,059
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1442
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:18,855
I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.

1443
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:19,981
Baxter?

1444
02:01:20,148 --> 02:01:23,651
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.

1445
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:26,362
- He wouldn't? - No. He just walked out on me. Quit.

1446
02:01:26,529 --> 02:01:29,616
Threw that big, fat job right in my face.

1447
02:01:30,992 --> 02:01:35,038
- The nerve. - The little punk. After all I did for him.

1448
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:39,501
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.

1449
02:01:39,667 --> 02:01:42,462
What's he got against you, anyway?

1450
02:01:42,629 --> 02:01:48,551
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles, cookiewise.

1451
02:01:50,553 --> 02:01:53,014
What are you talking about?

1452
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:57,477
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1453
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:07,487
[all] Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1454
02:02:07,654 --> 02:02:12,617
And never brought to mind ...

1455
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:15,995
Happy New Year, Fran.

1456
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:22,460
And days of auld lang syne

1457
02:02:23,294 --> 02:02:28,424
For auld lang syne, my dear

1458
02:02:28,591 --> 02:02:33,555
For auld lang syne

1459
02:02:33,721 --> 02:02:38,935
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

1460
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:44,732
For auld lang syne

1461
02:02:45,149 --> 02:02:47,235
[cheering]

1462
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:52,407
[horns and whistles]

1463
02:02:56,452 --> 02:02:58,538
Fran?

1464
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:01,874
Where are you, Fran?

1465
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:19,809
[bang]

1466
02:03:19,976 --> 02:03:22,061
Mr Baxter!

1467
02:03:22,312 --> 02:03:23,521
Mr Baxter!

1468
02:03:23,855 --> 02:03:26,899
Mr Baxter! Mr Baxter!

1469
02:03:29,861 --> 02:03:31,154
Oh!

1470
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:34,407
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

1471
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:37,076
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1472
02:03:37,785 --> 02:03:39,871
I'm fine all over.

1473
02:03:41,873 --> 02:03:45,335
- Mind if I come in? - Of course not.

1474
02:03:49,047 --> 02:03:51,132
Let me get another glass.

1475
02:03:54,052 --> 02:03:56,137
- Where are you going? - Who knows?

1476
02:03:56,304 --> 02:03:59,599
Another neighbourhood, another town, another job.

1477
02:03:59,766 --> 02:04:02,060
I'm on my own.

1478
02:04:02,226 --> 02:04:04,312
That's funny. So am I.

1479
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,732
What'd you do with the cards?

1480
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:09,984
In there.

1481
02:04:21,287 --> 02:04:23,289
What about Mr Sheldrake?

1482
02:04:23,456 --> 02:04:26,584
I'm gonna send him a fruitcake every Christmas.

1483
02:04:29,003 --> 02:04:31,089
Cut.

1484
02:04:32,715 --> 02:04:34,801
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

1485
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:37,095
Three.

1486
02:04:37,261 --> 02:04:38,429
Queen.

1487
02:04:38,596 --> 02:04:42,642
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.

1488
02:04:45,269 --> 02:04:47,355
Shut up and deal.
