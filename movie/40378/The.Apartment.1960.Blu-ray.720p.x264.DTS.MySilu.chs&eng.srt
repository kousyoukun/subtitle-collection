1
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:30,989
片名：《桃色公寓》（又译作：公寓春光）

2
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:40,475
1959年11月1日，纽约市的人口达到了8,042,783.
On November 1, 1959, the population of New York City was 8,042,783.

3
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:45,731
如果把所有的人头尾相连按照每个人5英尺6英寸的话
If you laid them all end to end, figuring an average height of 5 feet 6 1/2 inches...

4
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,901
这个长度可以从时代广场一直连到巴基斯坦的卡拉奇的郊外
...they would reach from Times Square to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.

5
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:54,448
我之所以很清楚这些事情，是因为我在一家名为联合生活的保险公司工作
I know facts like this because I work for an insurance company, Consolidated Life.

6
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,117
一家美国前五名的大公司之一
We're one of the top five companies in the country.

7
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:01,038
我们总部有31,259名员工
Our home office has 31,259 employees...

8
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:05,500
呃，大概比密西西比河岸的那其兹的总人数还要多
...which is more than the entire population of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.

9
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,629
我在19楼工作，普通保单处理部
I work on the 19th floor. Ordinary Policy Department...

10
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,966
保费清算分部w分区，桌号为861
...Premium Accounting Division, Section W, desk number 861.

11
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:18,055
我全名为CC·巴克斯特：C是卡尔文，C是克利夫德，但是人们一般都叫我巴德
My name is C.C. Baxter: C for Calvin, C for Clifford. But most people call me Bud.

12
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:23,435
我在这里工作了三年零十个月，我扣税后的实得工资是每周94.7美元
I've worked here three years, ten months, and my take-home pay is $94.70 a week.

13
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,782
我们部门的上班时间是从8:50到17:20.
The hours in our department are 8.50 to 5.20.

14
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:46,708
16部电梯来回在每层楼忙碌，这样才能运送31,259名员工
They're staggered by floor so 16 elevators can handle the 31,259 employees...

15
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,294
而不至于交通堵塞
...without a serious traffic jam.

16
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:54,591
对于我个人而言，我一般经常待在办公室里，有时候还会加班一两个小时
As for myself, I very often stay on at the office and work for an extra hour or two...

17
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,802
特别是天气很差的时候
...especially when the weather is bad.

18
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,514
这不是因为我特别有野心，只是一种消磨时间的办法
It's not that I'm overly ambitious. It's just a way of killing time...

19
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,350
直到我回家时间的到来
...until it's all right for me to go home.

20
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,020
你看，我的公寓有一点小问题
You see, I have this little problem with my apartment.

21
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,775
我住在西街60号，离中心公园只有半街之隔
I live in the West 60s, just half a block from Central Park.

22
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,070
我的房租是每月85美元，去年七月份还是80美元
My rent is $85 a month. It used to be $80 until last July...

23
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:19,116
直到房东太太—利伯曼夫人安装了一个二手空调后
...when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady, put in a second-hand air conditioner.

24
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:24,913
这确实是一间好公寓，朴实无华但还是很舒适，特别适合单身汉
It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy, but kind of cozy. Just right for a bachelor.

25
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,500
唯一的问题是我不能随心所欲地随时进去
The only problem is I can't always get in when I want to.

26
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,600
快停下来，塞尔维亚，我们要马上出去
Cut it out, Sylvia. We've gotta get out of here.

27
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,770
干什么这么慌张呢？我还想喝一杯马提尼
What's the panic? I'm gonna have another martini.

28
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,064
求你了，塞尔维亚，现在九点过一刻了
Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.

29
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,526
开始你让我在这里等，然后就一直匆匆忙忙
First you can't wait to get me here and then it's rush, rush, rush.

30
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,863
- 让我觉得自己是廉价的妓女　- 甜心，不是那样的
- Makes a person feel cheap. - Sweetie, it's not that.

31
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,782
但我答应那家伙8点整就出去的
But I promised the guy I'd be outta here by eight.

32
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:06,621
- 谁？这间公寓是谁的？　- 公司的某个傻鸟
- What guy? Whose apartment is this? - Some schnook that works in the office.

33
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,429
- 晚上好，巴克斯特先生　- 利伯曼夫人，你好
- Good evening, Mr. Baxter. - Mrs. Lieberman.

34
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:27,601
这糟糕的鬼天气一定是从好望角那里传过来
Some weather we're having. Must be from all that meshugaas at Cape Canaveral.

35
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:33,648
- 你被锁在门外了吗？　- 没有，没有，只是在等一个朋友
- You're locked out of your apartment? - No, no. Just waiting for a friend.

36
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,569
- 晚安，利伯曼夫人　- 晚安，巴克斯特先生
- Good night, Mrs. Lieberman. - Good night, Mr. Baxter.

37
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,131
- 你住在哪里？　- 我告诉过你了，和我母亲
- Where do you live? - I told you. With my mother.

38
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,426
- 她住在哪里？　- 布朗克斯，179街
- Where does she live? - 179th Street, in the Bronx.

39
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:06,556
- 好的，我送你到地铁站　- 去死吧，你应该让我打的回家
- All right. I'll take you to the subway. - Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.

40
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,602
- 为什么你们这些小姐们都住在布鲁克斯呢？　- 你还带过其他的女孩到这里？
- Why do all you dames live in the Bronx? - You bring other girls up here?

41
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,688
当然没有，我是一个快乐的已婚男人
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

42
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,064
你好，爵弗斯太太有什么问题吗？
- Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss. - Something's the matter?

43
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,277
哦，我好像把钥匙放在…哈，在这里
Uh, no. I... seem to have dropped my key. Ah, here it is.

44
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,904
我好像听到你的房间很吵啊
Such a racket I heard in your place.

45
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,156
你房间是不是有小偷光顾？
Maybe you had burglars?

46
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:09,828
不要担心这个，我的房间没什么好偷的，晚安
Don't worry about that. There's nothing in here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.

47
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:53,288
很抱歉打扰你，巴德小伙，但是开始那位小姐忘了她的手套
Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy, but the little lady forgot her galoshes.

48
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,916
科克比先生，你应该八点就离开的
Mr. Kirkeby, you were supposed to be outta here by eight.

49
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,671
我知道，任何事情都不可能像公共汽车那么准时的
I know, but those things don't always run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.

50
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,424
夏天还无所谓，但是在这样的一个雨天
I don't mind in the summer, but on a rainy night...

51
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,218
我还没有吃晚饭呢，知道知道
- I haven't had any dinner yet. - Sure, sure.

52
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,471
哦
Oh!

53
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,932
我告诉你一个从人事部舍尔爵克先生那里传来的好消息
I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake in Personnel.

54
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,643
舍尔爵克先生对
- Mr. Sheldrake? - That's right.

55
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,730
我们讨论了认识调动方面的问题，我告诉他你是非常合适的人选
We discussed manpower promotionwise. I told him you're a bright boy.

56
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,984
他们总是在寻找合适的年轻的经理，你马上就可以被提升上去了
They're always on the lookout for young executives. You're on your way up.

57
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,988
而且你的酒已经被喝光了，抵押和借贷部的爱其尔伯格先生
- And you're also out of liquor. - Mr. Eichelberger, Mortgage and Loans...

58
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,576
昨天晚上举行了一个万圣节晚会，给我留了一些伏特加和苦艾酒
...last night he had a Halloween party. - Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.

59
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,997
- 你还欠我两瓶酒呢　- 我星期五付钱给你
- You still owe me for the last two bottles. - I'll pay you on Friday.

60
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:41,461
对了，你曾经用过的那个奶酪搅拌器怎么了
Oh, and whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have?

61
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,715
奶酪各搅拌器？
Cheese crackers?

62
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,131
干杯
Cheers.

63
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,900
- 晚安，巴克斯特先生　- 嗨，医生，看病这么晚回来？
- Good evening, Baxter. - Hi, Doc. Had a late call?

64
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:50,739
是的，一些小丑在斯科夫特吃三明治，总会把牙签也吃了进去
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate a club sandwich... including the toothpick.

65
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,368
- 哦，晚安，医生　- 回头见，巴克斯特
- Well, good night, Doc. - Say, Baxter.

66
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,372
像你这样天天折腾法，估计你有一个铁打的肾
The way you're beltin' that stuff, you must have cast-iron kidneys.

67
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,668
那不是我，只是有时候一些朋友在我这里喝酒
That's not me. Just once in a while I have a few people in for a drink.

68
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,880
事实上，你也确实很厉害，铁人一个
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around.

69
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,258
每天从墙那边都传来那种声音，看来你好像每天都在做爱
From what I hear through the walls, you're at it every night.

70
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,971
不好意思吵这你们了，只是有时候我看连续两场的棒球赛
- I'm sorry if it gets noisy. - And sometimes there's a double-header.

71
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,059
像你一样平凡好了，回头见，医生
- A nebbish like you. - Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.

72
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,937
对了，你知道我在哥伦比亚医学中心做研究
You know, I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center.

73
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,356
- 你能帮我一个忙吗？　- 我？
- Could you do us a favor? - Me?

74
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,277
当你确立你的遗嘱的时候在你上天国以后，你…
When you make out your will... and the way you're going, you should...

75
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,531
你介意把你的遗体捐赠给大学做研究吗？
...would you mind leaving your body to the university?

76
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:38,036
我的身体？我恐怕你们要失望了。晚安，医生
My body? I'm afraid you guys'd be disappointed. Good night, Doc.

77
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,456
慢走，孩子
Slow down, kid.

78
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,996
哦，在去天堂的路上…
Oh, for heaven...

79
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:34,008
来自世界最经典电影的收藏。我们荣誉推介…

但是首先，请我们的赞助商致辞
But first, a word from our sponsor.

84

如果你是时尚抽烟一族，不要被那些假冒的过滤嘴广告所欺骗
If you smoke the modern way, don't be fooled by phoney filter claims.

85
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,476
现在开始播放"大旅馆"，
And now, "Grand Hotel"...

86

But first, a word from our alternate sponsor.

89
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,408
朋友们，你有摇动的假牙吗？
Friends, do you have wobbly dentures?

90
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,227
喂，你好，巴德小伙
- Hello. - Hiya, Buddy-boy.

91
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:12,190
我现在在61街的酒吧，于是我想给你挂个电话
I'm in this bar on 61 st Street and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

92
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,901
非常感谢，但是请问您是哪位？
That's very nice of you but... who is this?

93
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,445
多比奇.行政部的乔·多比奇
Dobisch. Joe Dobisch, in Administration.

94
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:21,407
- 哦，我听不出你的声音　- 没有问题，巴德
- Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize your voice. - That's OK, Buddy-boy.

95
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:26,120
- 我开始说过，我在61街口　- 我想我很幸运
Like I was saying, I'm in this joint on 61 st and I think I got lucky.

96
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,292
很抱歉，多比奇先生，我也很想帮你，可是现在太晚了
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. I like to help you fellas out, but it's sort of late.

97
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,755
- 我们改天再说好吗？　- 听着，小伙子，我这次控制不住
- Why don't we make it some other time? - Listen, kid. I can't pass this up.

98
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,633
她长得很像玛丽莲·梦露
She looks like Marilyn Monroe.

99
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,054
- 我已经上床睡觉了，还吃了安眠药　- 我想给你的答案是不行
I'm already in bed. And I took a sleeping pill. So I'm afraid the answer is no.

100
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:47,642
我们正在做月度绩效评估，我把你放在前十位
We're doing the monthly efficiency rating. I'm putting you in the top ten.

101
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,978
你不想浪费这一机会吧，不是吗？
You don't wanna louse yourself up, do you?

102
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:54,941
不想，但是如果我晚上睡不够的话，白天怎么能高效呢
No. But how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?

103
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:59,237
现在才11点，我只借用你的地方45分钟
It's only eleven, and I just want the place for 45 minutes.

104
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,325
我好寂寞。你到底在和谁打电话？
I'm getting lonely. Who are you talking to, anyway?

105
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,496
- 我母亲　- 哦，真是甜蜜，太幸福了
- My mother. - Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.

106
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,790
嗯！
Ooh!

107
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,003
就是30分钟，你说怎么样，巴德？
Make it 30 minutes. What do you say, Bud, huh?

108
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,840
我酒喝完了，而且还没有干净的杯子
I'm all out of liquor, there's no clean glasses...

109
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,635
- 没有奶酪搅拌器，什么都没有　- 让我来考虑这些事情吧！
- There's no cheese crackers. No nothin'. - Let me worry about that.

110
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,596
你只要把钥匙放在毯子下面，然后出去就行了
Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.

111
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,849
好吧，多比奇先生
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

112
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,436
你说什么都行，多比奇先生
Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch!

113
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:36,024
一点都不麻烦，多比奇先生，别客气
No trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch! Be my guest!

114
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,861
巴德小伙子从来都不会让我们失望的
We never close at Buddy-boy's.

115
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,658
“长的像玛丽莲·梦露”！
"Looks like Marilyn Monroe"!

116
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,913
就是这个地方吗？是的
- This the place? - Yeah.

117
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,040
- 多少钱？　- 70美分
- How much? - 70 cents.

118
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,250
帮我拿钱，好吗？
Get the money, will you?

119
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,046
小心一点！
Watch those stingers!

120
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,424
- 给他一美元　- 谢谢，小姐
- Give him a buck. - Thanks, lady.

121
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,428
帮我再放回去，宝贝！
Put it back, honey!

122
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,265
太棒了
Attagirl.

123
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,560
- 你认为这是一个好主意？　- 没有比这更好的
- Are you sure this is a good idea? - Can't think of a better one.

124
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,938
这么晚来打扰你妈妈方便吗？
Barging in on your mother so late at night.

125
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:01,776
不要担心老太太，只要他敢发出一声抱怨，我就让她失业
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her and she's out of a job.

126
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,961
帮我拿钥匙，好吗？
Get the key, will you?

127
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,797
不在那里，在地毯下面
Not there! Under the mat.

128
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,758
- 在地毯下面？　- 是的，快点
- Under the mat? - Yeah. Come on.

129
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,970
把门打开，我们不能待整个晚上的。
Open up. We haven't got all night.

130
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,893
- 这是你母亲的公寓吗？　- 是的
- This is your mother's apartment? - That's right.

131
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,160
米尔德尔德，他又在里面做爱了！
Mildred! He's at it again!

132
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,379
- 早上好，克科比先生你好吗？　- 巴克斯特先生
- Morning, Mr. Kirkeby. - How are you, Baxter?

133
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,425
- 这几天你是不是很忙？　- 是的，先生，确实很忙
- They keeping you busy these days? - Yes, sir. They are indeed.

134
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,221
早上好，克塞尔先生，罗宾森小姐，威廉姆斯先生，李文斯顿小姐
Good morning, Mr. Kessel, Miss Robinson, Mr. Williams, Miss Livingston.

135
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,224
早上好，麦克维尔先生，斯库布特夫人，戴维斯先生
Good morning, Mr. McKellway, Mrs Schubert, Mr. Davis.

136
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,018
- 早上好，克科比先生　- 早上好，巴克斯特先生
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby. Good morning, Mr. Baxter.

137
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,979
- 早上好，库伯利克小姐　- 好了，准备出发
- Morning, Miss Kubelik. - That's all. Take it away.

138
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,649
请小心门口，马上出发
Watch the door, please. Blasting off.

139
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,489
- 你的头发怎么这样了？　- 让我很不舒服，所以我绞短了它
- What did you do to your hair? - It made me nervous so I chopped it off.

140
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,909
- 是不是觉得不太好？　- 不是，你这个发型是我喜欢的那种
- Big mistake, huh? - No. I sort of like it. [snuffles]

141
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,745
- 你很优秀　- 是的，最好不要靠太近
- You got a lulu. - Yeah. Better not get too close.

142
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,789
- 我从来都没有感冒　- 真的吗？
- I never catch colds. - Really?

143
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,750
我读过一些疾病和意外声明数据
I was reading some sickness and accident claims figures.

144
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:27,505
平均20岁到50岁的纽约人每年都会得两次半感冒
The average New Yorker aged between 20 and 50 has two and a half colds a year.

145
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,091
- 这让我感觉很恐怖　- 为什么？
- That makes me feel just terrible. - Why?

146
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,470
如果我一年一次感冒都没得，那一些可怜的家伙不是要得五次感冒了
If I have no colds a year, some poor slob must have five colds a year.

147
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,182
- 是的，是我　- 你今天早上应该在床上休息的
- Yeah. It's me. - You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.

148
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,851
本来昨天晚上是应该睡觉的
I shoulda stayed in bed last night.

149
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,187
19楼！
19!

150
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,109
小心你的脚
Watch your step.

151
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,778
- 小心你的手，克科比先生　- 再说一遍？
- And watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby! - Pardon?

152
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,490
有一天我想用这门把你夹住
One of these days I'm gonna shut these doors on you and...

153
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,494
下一站20层
20 next!

154
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,873
那个库伯利克小姐，小伙子，我想和她一起坐到中国的电梯
That Kubelik. Boy, would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China!

155
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,627
她是这栋楼最漂亮的操作员，我也很优秀
- She's the best operator in the building. - I'm pretty good myself.

156
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,797
但她从来都不和我约会，也许你能行
- But she won't give me a date. - Maybe it's your approach.

157
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,718
她周围很多人试过各种办法，结果都不行
A lot of guys around here have tried all kinds of approaches. No dice.

158
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:18,014
- 她想要证明什么？　- 她是一个很值得爱的女孩
- What's she trying to prove? - She could just be a nice respectable girl.

159
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,725
听他说过！小罗的佛特劳瑞
Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.

160
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,920
您好，多比奇先生，我是19层的巴克斯特先生
Hello. Mr. Dobisch? This is Baxter on the 19th floor.

161
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,797
哦，巴德小伙
Oh, Buddy-boy!

162
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,844
我正想给你打电话呢！不好意思把你的卧室墙上弄得这么脏
I was just about to call you. I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall.

163
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:01,182
我的朋友坚持认为毕加索是个游民，于是她开始在墙上作壁画
My friend kept insisting Picasso was a bum, so she started to do that mural.

164
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,726
我不是为了毕加索
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

165
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:08,647
我来要我公寓的钥匙，你说好要放在地毯下面
It's the key to my apartment. You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

166
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,859
我放了，我清清楚楚的记得放过了
But I did. I distinctly remember putting it there.

167
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,154
哦，我也找到钥匙，不过不是我的钥匙
Oh, I found the key all right. Only it's the wrong key!

168
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:21,452
是吗？怪不得我今天早上进不了经理盥洗室
It is? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.

169
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,038
但是我却进不了我的公寓
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

170
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:28,167
于是早上四点我叫醒房东太太，撒了很多不着边际的谎言来骗她
So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance.

171
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,504
不好意思我会派人送给你正确的房间钥匙
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down.

172
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,547
关于你的提升报告
And about your promotion.

173
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,884
我会把绩效评估报告送给人事部的舍尔爵克先生
I'll send that efficiency report to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.

174
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,512
你在今天之前应该可以听到好消息
You may hear from him before the day's over.

175
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,722
谢谢，多比奇先生
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

176
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,668
多比奇先生给你的
From Mr. Dobisch.

177
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,920
等一下
Wait.

178
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,599
给多比奇先生的
For Mr. Dobisch.

179
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,400
嗯哼，嗯哼
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

180
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,875
万德豪夫，公共关系部
Vanderhof. Public Relations.

181
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,002
哦，是巴克斯特，等我一下
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

182
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,547
好的，芬奇小姐把我们说好的这些打印好
All right, Miss Finch. Type up what we got so far.

183
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,385
看，原来我给你安排在今天晚上的
Look, I've got you down for tonight...

184
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,805
但是我今天晚上要自己用公寓，所以我必须取消你预定的时间
...but I'll be using the place myself, so I'll have to cancel.

185
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,892
但是今天是她的生日，我已经定了蛋糕
But it's her birthday. I already ordered the cake.

186
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:13,147
但是我病了，得了重感冒还发烧，我必须要在工作后回家睡觉
But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a fever. I got to go to bed right after work.

187
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,984
如果你得了感冒，你应该去泡一晚上土耳其浴，好好出出汗
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath. Spend the night. Sweat it out.

188
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:21,322
那是你为什么会得肺炎的原因。如果我得了肺炎，那我就要躺上一个月了
That's how you get pneumonia. If I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.

189
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:25,826
好的，你说得有道理，我在下个星期三晚上可以吗？
OK. You made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday night.

190
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:31,665
- 只有那天我才有空　- 星期三，星期三…星期三
- It's the only night I can get away. - Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.

191
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,503
已经有人预订了
I got somebody penciled in.

192
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,589
让我来安排一下，我马上给你回复
Let me see what I can do. I'll get back to you.

193
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:53,020
- 爱奇尔伯格先生　- 哦，是巴克斯特，有什么事情？
- Mr. Eichelberger. - Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?

194
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,944
星期三不行？天啊，这把我的日程弄得一团糟
Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws a little monkey wrench into my agenda.

195
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,447
星期四？不行，那一整天我都没有空
Thursday? No, I'm all tied up on Thursday.

196
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,993
让我来排排时间，呃，在星期五怎么样？
Let's schedule that, uh... meeting for Friday.

197
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,204
星期五
Friday.

198
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,874
让我来盘算一下，等一下给你回复
Let me see what I can do. I'll get back to you.

199
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:24,385
在保险金和保单种类方面，我们比去年增长了18%
Premiumwise and billingwise, we are 18 percent ahead of last year Octoberwise.

200
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,224
喂？哦，巴克斯特，有什么事情？
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

201
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,561
我把你的时间从星期五调到星期四如何？
Instead of Friday, could you possibly switch to Thursday?

202
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,564
你帮了我一个大忙了
You'd be doing me a great favor.

203
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,483
然我来看看，等下回复你
Let me check. I'll get back to you.

204
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,696
联合生活，我以后联系你
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.

205
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,739
塞尔维亚，你的电话
Sylvia, it's for you.

206
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,700
喂？
Yeah?

207
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,493
你好
Oh, hello.

208
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,913
我当然自己回家了，你欠我45美分
Sure I got home all right. You owe me 45 cents.

209
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,876
听着，塞尔维亚，不在星期五，我们星期四晚上如何？
Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday, could we make it Thursday night?

210
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:02,256
星期四？！那好吧，那就取消和鲍勃·斯戴布的约会！
Thursday?! Well, that's The Untouchables with Bob Stack!

211
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,592
鲍勃是谁？
Bob who?

212
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,762
好的，那我们在公寓碰面，有什么了不起！
All right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal!

213
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,603
喂，巴克斯特吗？星期四可以了
Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.

214
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,272
谢谢，克科比先生
Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.

215
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,451
爱奇尔伯格先生，星期五可以了
Mr. Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.

216
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,794
万德豪夫先生，星期三可以了
Mr. Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.

217
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,599
好的，我会告诉他的
All right. I'll tell him.

218
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,561
嗨，巴克斯特，人事部舍尔爵克先生的秘书给你打了电话
Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

219
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:02,733
她在开始的20分钟里一直想找你，他们让你上楼
She's been trying to reach you for the last 20 minutes. They want you upstairs.

220
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:08,405
- 你要升职，还是被炒鱿鱼？　- 那我们来小赌一把如何？
- Are you getting promoted? Or fired? - Would you care to make a small wager?

221
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,701
- 我在这里待的时间是你的两倍，但是…　- 赌一美元如何？
- I've been here twice as long as you but... - Let's say a dollar?

222
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,495
赌就赌！
It's a bet!

223
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,803
- 上去吗？　- 哦，对不起
- Going up? - Oh! Excuse me.

224
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:36,183
27楼，谢谢！小心一点，你在运送一件重要的货物，也就是指大人物
27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying precious cargo. I mean manpowerwise.

225
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,435
27楼.
27.

226
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,523
看不出来吧，我是公司业绩评估的前十名…
You may not realize it, but I am in the top ten, efficiencywise...

227
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,442
今天我很有可能被提升
...and this may be the day promotionwise.

228
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,195
你说话已经开始像克科比先生了
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.

229
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:52,366
- 为什么不呢，当他们把我送到楼上。　- 为什么这种事情不能发生在一个好人身上呢
- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs? - Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

230
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:56,203
你知道，你是电梯里唯一脱帽的人
You know, you're the only one who takes his hat off in the elevator.

231
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,664
这是电梯里男人们的事情
Something happens to men in elevators.

232
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,792
这是地位改变的缘故，血都冲到他们的头上了
It's the change of altitude. The blood rushes to their head.

233
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,129
- 我可以给你讲一些故事　- 我很乐意听
- I could tell you stories... - I'd love to hear 'em.

234
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,840
我们什么时候在外面吃顿饭如何
We could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime.

235
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,883
或者在工作后的某个晚上
Or some evening, after work?

236
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,553
- 27楼到　- 哦
- 27. - Oh.

237
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,347
- 我希望你一切顺利　- 我也希望如此
- I hope everything goes all right. - I hope so.

238
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,225
他们今天给我打电话，我的感冒也好些了
They would call me today, what with my cold.

239
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,894
- 我看起来精神吗？　- 很好，等一下
- How do I look? - Fine. Wait.

240
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,230
谢谢！
Thank you.

241
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:28,235
我注意到了，当你在电梯上的时候，你总会戴一朵小花
I noticed, when you were still on the local elevator, you always wore a flower.

242
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,904
祝你好运，把你的鼻子擦干净
Good luck. And wipe your nose.

243
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:50,049
CC·巴克斯特，普通保费清算部，舍尔爵克先生叫我
C.C. Baxter, Ordinary Premium Accounting. Mr. Sheldrake called me.

244
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,926
我找你，而且我都找你20分钟了
I called you. That is, I tried to for 20 minutes.

245
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,220
- 不好意思　- 进去吧
- I'm sorry. - Go on in.

246
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,442
- 巴克斯特？　- 是的，先生
- Baxter? - Yes, sir.

247
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,694
进来，进来
Come in, come in.

248
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,531
我正在想你长什么样子，巴克斯特
I was sort of wondering what you looked like, Baxter.

249
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,242
- 请坐　- 谢谢，舍尔爵克先生
- Sit down. - Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

250
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,413
我听说一些人都说你很优秀
Been hearing some nice things about you.

251
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,625
克比奇先生说你忠诚，富有合作精神，很有潜力
Mr. Dobisch says you're loyal, cooperative, resourceful.

252
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:29,129
- 他这么说？　- 克科比先生说你经常加班
- Mr. Dobisch said that? - Mr. Kirkeby tells me you often work late...

253
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,633
- 却不领加班费　- 你知道的，事情总是一大堆
...without overtime. - You know how it is. Things pile up.

254
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,887
公共关系部的万德豪夫先生，抵押和借贷部的爱奇尔伯格先生
Mr. Vanderhof in Public Relations and Mr. Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans...

255
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,932
都希望你能调到他们的部门
...would both like you transferred to their departments.

256
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,059
太过奖了
Very flattering.

257
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:47,314
告诉我，巴克斯特，究竟是什么原因让你这么受人欢迎？
Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it that makes you so popular?

258
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,943
- 我不知道　- 想一想
- I don't know. - Think.

259
00:26:56,156 --> 00:27:00,160
- 你能在重复一下问题吗？　- 听着，巴克斯特，我并不傻
- Would you mind repeating the question? - Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.

260
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,832
我知道这栋大楼每年每天发生的事情
I know everything that goes on in this building every day of the year.

261
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,458
真的吗？
You do?

262
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:11,130
1957年我们这里有一个雇员，名叫弗劳尔，他也很受欢迎
In 1957 we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular too.

263
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,966
后来才知道他在开一个赌马的投注点
It turned out he was running a bookie joint...

264
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,636
连上我们的接线总机，并用我们的IBM计算机来计算冷门
...tying up our switchboard, using our IBM machines to figure the odds.

265
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:22,015
在肯塔基德比赛的前一天我告诉了刑警队，他们逮捕了他
The day before the Kentucky Derby I called in the vice squad, who raided him.

266
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,184
- 刑警队？　- 是的
- The vice squad? - That's right.

267
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,646
这和我有什么关系呢？我没有开任何一个赌马的投注点
What's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.

268
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,275
那你开的是哪种中介站呢？先生？
- Just what kind of joint are you running? - Sir?

269
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:36,488
一个联结从克科比到万德豪夫，到艾奇尔伯格，再到多比奇的关键东西
A key is floating around from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

270
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,574
这个东西好像是一间公寓
It's the key to a certain apartment.

271
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,202
- 知道公寓是谁的吗？　- 谁？
- Know who that apartment belongs to? - Who?

272
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,706
忠诚的，极具潜力和合作精神的CC·巴克斯特先生
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative C.C. Baxter.

273
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,711
- 哦　- 你打算否认这一切吗？
- Oh. - Are you going to deny it?

274
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,716
不，我不想否认这一切，如果你能给我一个解释的机会
No. I'm not going to deny it. If you'd just let me explain.

275
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,135
说吧！
You'd better.

276
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,387
好
Well...

277
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:05,726
大约一年前，我正在上夜校，学习高级会计
...about a year ago, I was going to night school, studying advanced accounting.

278
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:10,898
我们部门的一个住在泽西的家伙，要参加镇上的一个晚宴
One of the guys in our department... lives in Jersey... had to go to a banquet in town.

279
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:15,402
他需要一个地方来换燕尾服，于是我把钥匙借给了他
He needed someplace to change into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.

280
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:21,533
这个消息一下全传开了，忽然间所有人都要参加晚宴
Word must've gotten out because all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets.

281
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,580
你把钥匙给了这个人，你就不能拒绝另外一个，事情终于无法控制
You give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another. It all got out of hand.

282
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,920
巴克斯特，一个保险公司是建立在公众信任之上的
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust.

283
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,381
一个雇员的行为如果不典的话
Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming...

284
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,551
你们这一个小团体有几个人？
How many charter members are there in this little club?

285
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,430
只有四个，31,259人中的四个
Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.

286
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:47,684
所以我们应该为我们的员工自豪，这个比例很小
So actually we can be very proud of our personnel... percentagewise.

287
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:52,439
但这不是重点，一个篮子中的四个烂苹果，不管这个篮子有多大…
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel, however large the barrel...

288
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,776
- 你意识到这有多大的损害　- 不会的
- Do you realize if this ever leaked out... - It won't!

289
00:28:55,943 --> 00:29:00,948
相信我，再也不会了，从现在开始没有人会用我的钥匙
Believe me. Never again. Nobody is gonna use my apartment from now on.

290
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,742
- 你的公寓在哪里？　- 西67街
- Where is your apartment? - West 67th Street.

291
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:09,331
你不知道我是怎么和邻居和房东太太处理关于钥匙的事情
You have no idea what I go through with the neighbors, the landlady and the key.

292
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,500
你是怎么把钥匙给他们的？
How do you work it with the key?

293
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:16,546
我把钥匙在办公室的时候给他们，他们走的时候放在毯子下面，我保证再也不会了
I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave it under a mat. Never again. I promise.

294
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,262
- 奥尔森小姐，有什么事情？　- 舍尔爵克太太，在2线给你回电话.
- Yes, Miss Olsen? - Mrs. Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.

295
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,894
亲爱的，你在哪里呢？
Yes, dear. Where were you?

296
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:36,400
你应该带托米看牙医的？没有虫牙？好的，等一下，亲爱的。
You had to take Tommy to the dentist? No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.

297
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,569
- 你去哪里，巴克斯特先生？　- 我不想打扰你
- Where are you going, Baxter? - I don't wanna intrude.

298
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,990
- 既然事情已经清楚了　- 我和你还有事情
- Since this is straightened out... - I'm not through with you yet.

299
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,325
我今天晚上不能回家吃晚饭了
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

300
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,496
从堪萨斯来的分部经理今天在这里，我要陪他去看戏
The branch manager from Kansas City is in town. I'm taking him to the theater.

301
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,456
剧名叫《音乐人》，还有什么事情吗？
Music Man. What else?

302
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,167
不，不要等我，亲爱的，再见
No, don't wait up for me, darling. Goodbye.

303
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,755
告诉我，巴克斯特你看过《音乐人》这部戏吗？
Tell me, Baxter. Have you seen Music Man?

304
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,508
还没有，不过听说很不错
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

305
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,844
今天晚上你去怎么样？
How would you like to go tonight?

306
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:08,307
你和我吗？我想你要陪那位从堪萨斯来的经理吧！
You and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City.

307
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,685
不，我有其他的事情，你可以把这两张票都拿去
No, I have other plans. You can have both tickets.

308
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,854
哦，你太好了
Well... that's very kind of you.

309
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:18,025
但是我今天身体不太舒服，感冒了，我只想马上回家休息
But I'm not feeling well. I've got this cold. I'm gonna go right home.

310
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,862
巴克斯特，你没有弄懂我的意思，我告诉你有计划的
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.

311
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,365
我也是，我就想吃四片阿斯匹林，然后上床睡觉
So do I. I'm gonna take four aspirins, get into bed.

312
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,868
那您把票给别人吧！
So give the tickets to somebody else.

313
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:32,873
听着，巴克斯特，我不是想白给你票，我想和你交换
Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving these tickets. I wanna swap them.

314
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,208
交换？换什么？
Swap 'em? For what?

315
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:42,382
他们还说你头脑机敏，狡猾还非常有想象力
It also says here that you are alert, astute and quite imaginative.

316
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,552
哦？
Oh?

317
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,642
哦
Oh...

318
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:06,073
这就对了，巴克斯特，下个月人事部会有一个调动的机会
That's good thinking, Baxter. There's gonna be a shift in personnel next month.

319
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,077
据我所知你是一个当经理的好材料
And as far as I'm concerned, you are executive material.

320
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,746
- 我？　- 现在你把钥匙留下
- I am? - Now put down the key.

321
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,959
写好你的地址
And put down the address.

322
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,133
我的公寓在二楼，门上什么都没有，只写着公寓2A。
It's on the second floor. There's no name over the door. It just says apartment 2A.

323
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,053
很冷吗？放松点，巴克斯特
- It's that cold. - Relax, Baxter.

324
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,263
好的，谢谢
Yes, thank you, sir.

325
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,352
你们应该注意点唱片机，小声点，否则邻居会抱怨的
You will be careful with the record player? Shh.

326
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,521
对了，还有酒的问题
Oh, and about the liquor.

327
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:42,275
我今天上午已经预订了，我不知道他们会什么时候送过来
I ordered some this morning. I don't know when they'll deliver it.

328
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,279
- 这是我们的小秘密　- 当然
- This is going to be our little secret. - Of course.

329
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,116
- 你知道人言可畏　- 不要担心
- You know how people talk. - Don't worry about that.

330
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,953
- 我没有什么好隐藏的　- 是，总之，这不关我的事
- Not that I have anything to hide. - No! Anyway, it's none of my business.

331
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,957
4个人，5个人，有什么区别呢？
Four apples, five apples. What's the difference?

332
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,126
很好的比率
Percentagewise.

333
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,837
给你，巴克斯特先生，玩得愉快
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

334
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,131
你也一样，先生
You too, sir.

335
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,000
我认为担任像他这种职位的人，他会带我去摩洛哥，可能是21。
So I figure, a man in his position, he'll take me to El Morocco, maybe 21.

336
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:44,796
结果他却带我去什么汉堡天堂和一个傻瓜的公寓
Instead he takes me to Hamburger Heaven and some schnook's apartment.

337
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,803
- 晚安　- 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

338
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,057
嘿，库伯利克小姐
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

339
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,352
我一直在等你，都差一点认不出你了
I've been waiting for you. I almost didn't recognize you.

340
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,689
这是第一次我看你穿便装
This is the first time I've seen you in civilian clothes.

341
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,066
- 到27楼结果如何？　- 非常好
- How'd it go on the 27th floor? - Great.

342
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,652
- 你看过《音乐人》吗？　- 没有
- Look, have you seen The Music Man? - No.

343
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,362
- 那你想不想去看呢？　- 当然
- Would you like to? - Sure.

344
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,865
我们可以先去吃点什么然后再去看戏
We could get a bite to eat first, and then go.

345
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,533
- 哦，你是说今晚吗？　- 对啊！
- Oh, you mean tonight? - Yeah.

346
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,786
- 不好意思，恐怕不行，我已经约了别人　- 太糟糕了
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody. - Oh.

347
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,498
- 你是指，和你的…你的女性朋友约会？　- 不，一个男的
- You mean... like a girlfriend? - No. Like a man.

348
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:25,212
我想这不是我个人的意见，公司的同事都在想你是否已经…
I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas in the office were wondering if you ever...

349
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,297
你随便什么时候告诉他们
You tell 'em now and then.

350
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:31,718
这个约会…就是一个约会？有什么很严重的问题吗？
This date, is it... just a date? Or is it something serious?

351
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:35,347
哦，曾经是一个很严重的问题，至少对我是的，但对他就不是
Well, it used to be serious. At least, I was. But he wasn't.

352
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,849
所以现在整件事情多多少少，意义都不大了
So now the whole thing's more or less kaput.

353
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,560
- 如果那样的话，你能不能…　- 恐怕不行
- In that case, couldn't you... - I'm afraid not.

354
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,898
我答应他和他喝酒的，他已经约我一个星期了
I promised I'd have a drink with him. He's been calling me all week.

355
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,734
我明白
I understand.

356
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:52,405
哦，这只是我的建议，我不想看到这两张戏票浪费
Well, it was just an idea. I hate to see a theater ticket go to waste.

357
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,659
- 这场戏什么时候开始？　- 20:30
- What time does the show go on? - 8:30.

358
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,161
好吧，我尽可能到戏院找你
Well, I could meet you at the theatre.

359
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:02,374
太好了，就在44街
That's wonderful! It's the Majestic on 44th Street.

360
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,376
我在大堂等你
I'll meet you in the lobby.

361
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:08,004
你知道的，早上我的精神很差，好像得了101感冒
You know, I felt so lousy this morning. Had 101 fever.

362
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,591
现在我得到了升迁，并且还有11排中间的座位
Now along comes my promotion and us... 11 th row centre.

363
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,718
你还说我要躺在床上休息
And you said I should've stayed in bed.

364
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,012
- 你感冒怎样了？　- 什么感冒
- How is your cold? - What cold?

365
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,183
看完戏我还能在镇上到处逛逛
After the show we could go out on the town. [hums dance tune]

366
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,103
- 我从亚瑟莫里那里得到了力量　- 我明白
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray. - So I see.

367
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,231
在村上的EI奇科有一支很好的乐队
There's a great band at El Chico, in the Village.

368
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,901
- 就在你家附近的拐口处　- 听起来很不错
- Around the corner from where you live. - Sounds good.

369
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:34,614
- 你怎么知道我住在哪里？　- 哦，…我甚至知道你和谁一起住
- How do you know where I live? - Oh, I... even know who you live with.

370
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,783
你姐姐和姐夫
Your sister and brother-in-law.

371
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,912
我知道你什么时候在哪里生的，我知道所有关于你的事情
I know when you were born and where. I know all sorts of things about you.

372
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,455
你怎么知道这些的？
How come?

373
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:47,294
几个月前在集团的人身保险里，我看到了你的资料卡片
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.

374
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,298
我知道你的身高体重，你的社保号码
I know your height and your weight and your social security number.

375
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:55,468
你得过腮腺炎和麻疹，你的阑尾已经被割掉了
You had mumps and measles and you had your appendix out.

376
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,472
不要给公司的那帮家伙说我割了阑尾
Don't mention the appendix to the fellas in the office.

377
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,477
我不想让人家在那里乱猜：你是怎么知道我割了阑尾？再见！
I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea about how you found out. Bye.

378
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,816
20:30！
8:30!

379
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,786
- 晚上好，舍尔爵克先生　- 弗兰，请不要这么大声
- Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake. - Please, Fran. Not so loud.

380
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,372
你还害怕有人看到我们在一起？
Still afraid someone might see us together?

381
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,209
- 我来帮你放大衣　- 不，杰夫，我不能待太久
- Let me take your coat. - No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

382
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,713
- 我能喝一杯冰冻的待克瑞鸡尾酒吗？　- 马上就到
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri? - It's on the way.

383
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:18,218
- 我看到你走过来，而且头发已经剪短了　- 没错
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair. - That's right.

384
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,680
- 你知道我更喜欢你留长头发的　- 我知道
- You know I liked it better long. - I know.

385
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,724
你还想你的钱包有一个锁呢！
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

386
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:29,062
- 晚上好，女士，很高兴再次看到你　- 谢谢
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again. - Thank you.

387
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,399
已经有多久了，弗兰？一个月吗？
How long has it been, Fran? A month?

388
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,235
6个星期，那有什么意义呢
Six weeks. But who's counting?

389
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,405
我想你
I missed you.

390
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,909
老土
Like old times.

391
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,829
同样的座位，同样的音乐
Same booth. Same song.

392
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:50,834
- 糟糕透了　- 同样酸甜的沙司
- It's been hell. - Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.

393
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,464
你不知道那是什么感觉，在电梯里与你隔肩而立
You don't know what it's like, next to you in that elevator.

394
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,843
“早上好，库伯利克小姐。”“晚上好，舍尔爵克先生。”
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik." "Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."

395
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,512
弗兰，我对你仍是一往情深
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

396
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:08,226
- 杰夫，请不要开始就这样说，好吗？　- 我只是开始讲述我对你的真情
Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please? I'm just beginning to get over it.

397
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,021
鬼才信你
I don't believe you.

398
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,109
听者，杰夫，这个夏天的两个月，我们过得很开心
Look, Jeff. We had two wonderful months this summer.

399
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,112
但是那都已经过去了
But that was it. Happens all the time.

400
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:23,408
妻子和孩子一出国旅游，老板就可以和他的秘书…
Wife and kids go away to the country and the boss has a fling with his secretary...

401
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,286
…或者发廊妹，或者电梯小姐偷欢.
...or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.

402
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,789
九月份来到的时候，野餐结束了，也是说再见的时候了
Come September, the picnic's over. Goodbye.

403
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,960
子女们要重新回到学校，老板也要回到他夫人的身边…
The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife...

404
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,254
…至于那可怜的女孩
...and the girl...

405
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,592
他们再也不会像以往一样，做她爱吃的龙虾
They don't make these shrimp like they used to.

406
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,431
弗兰，我从来都没有说分手
I never said goodbye, Fran.

407
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:53,271
有那么一段时间，你开玩笑说，说你快乐得像一个单身汉
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man.

408
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:56,149
然后，有一天他就开始不停地看表
Then one day he keeps looking at his watch...

409
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,943
…并问我你身上是不是还有口红的痕迹。
...and asks you if any lipstick's showing...

410
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,655
…然后就冲出去，去赶开往白色平原的火车
...then rushes out to catch the 7:14 to White Plains.

411
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,327
就像喝一杯速溶咖啡一样潇洒…
So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee...

412
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:11,331
…你坐在那里，然后在想…
...and you sit there by yourself and you think...

413
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,627
…一切看起来都是那么的无聊.
...and it all begins to look so... ugly.

414
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,842
你知道我赶19:14回家的火车是什么感受吗？
How do you think I felt riding home on that 7:14 train?

415
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:27,180
杰夫，你为什么还要给我打电话？你还要我怎么样？
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?

416
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,349
弗兰，我想你回到我身边
I want you back, Fran.

417
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:33,436
不好意思，舍尔爵克先生，我现在很忙，你应该去找另外一个人去了
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.

418
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:37,482
弗兰，你都不给我一个机会，我有一些事情要告诉你
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I have something to tell you.

419
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:41,486
- 快说啊，什么事情　- 不在这里，我们能换一个地方吗？
- Go ahead. Tell me. - Not here. Can't we go someplace else?

420
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,531
- 不行，我在8:30还有一个约会　- 什么？
- No. I have a date at 8:30. - Oh?

421
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,660
- 很重要吗？　- 不是，但是我不能爽约.
- Important? - Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.

422
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,454
- 你想现在吃东西吗？　- 不，我不想吃
- You ready order dinner now? - No. No dinner.

423
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,165
再来两杯，好吗？
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

424
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,896
弗兰，你还记得我们在一起的那个周末吗？
Fran, do you remember that last weekend we had?

425
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:21,901
我记得！你租的那条破船，让我穿着黑色的睡衣，还戴着救生圈
Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me in a black negligee and a life preserver.

426
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,404
那你记得我们说过什么吗？
Do you remember what we talked about?

427
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,157
- 我们说过的一些事情　- 我会离婚的。
- We talked about a lot of things. - I mean about my getting a divorce.

428
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,660
我们没有说过这个，杰夫。是你说的
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

429
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,829
你不相信我，是吗？
You didn't believe me, did you?

430
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,417
他们现在换了一张唱片。“音乐把她带到身边。”
They got it on a long-playing record now. "Music to String Her Along By."

431
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:42,380
“我妻子根本不理解我。你是我碰到的让我最幸福的人”
"My wife doesn't understand me. You're the best thing that ever happened to me."

432
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,842
- 这还不够嘛？弗兰。　- “相信我，宝贝，一切都会好的。”
- That's enough, Fran. - "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."

433
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,761
- 别开玩笑了　- 我没有
- You're not being funny. - I wasn't trying.

434
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:53,224
- 弗兰，你就听我讲几分钟。　- 好吧。对不起。
- Fran, just listen to me for a minute. - All right. I'm sorry.

435
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:58,438
我今天早上去见律师了，向他问了些解决问题的方案。
I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted his advice about the best way to handle it.

436
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,107
- 解决什么问题？　- 你认为呢？
- Handle what? - What do you think?

437
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:07,071
老实说，杰夫，我从来都没有让你离开你的妻子
Let's get something straight, Jeff. I never asked you to leave your wife.

438
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,949
当然没有。你不要多想。
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.

439
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,078
你确认你是认真的吗？
Are you sure that's what you want?

440
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,750
当然…只要你说你还爱我
I'm sure... if you'll just tell me that you still love me.

441
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,963
你知道我的心意
You know I do.

442
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,801
弗兰
Fran.

443
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,474
杰夫，亲爱的…
Jeff, darling...

444
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,983
这里人太多了，我们出去吧！
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

445
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,850
出租车！
Taxi!

446
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,604
- 杰夫，我还有个约会，记得吗？　- 但是我爱你，记得吗？
- Jeff, I have that date, remember? - But I love you, remember?

447
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,357
我们去哪儿？
- [Whistles] - Where are we going?

448
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,360
- 不会再去那条破船吧？　- 我保证不会。
- Not back to that leaky boat? - I promise.

449
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,367
西67街51号
51 West 67th.

450
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,246
恭喜你
Congratulations.

451
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,681
你在意吗？CC·巴克斯特，是我。
Would you mind? C.C. Baxter... that's me.

452
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,228
谢谢
Thank you.

453
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,914
嗨，巴德男孩，恭喜你，真让人开心
Hi, Buddy-boy. Congratulations and all that jazz.

454
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,542
嘿，好家伙好了，你升职了，正如我们许诺的那样
- Hi, fellas. - Well, you made it, just like we promised.

455
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,879
真漂亮的办公室，看看门上的名字，地上的毯子
Quite an office. Name on the door, rug on the floor.

456
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:14,717
团队工作：是一个组织存在的前提。人人为我，我为人人
Teamwork: That's what counts in this organization. All for one and one for all.

457
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,886
- 知道我什么意思吗？　- 不太清楚
- Know what I mean? - I have a vague idea.

458
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,139
巴克斯特，我们对你有点失望，竟然一点感谢的表示都没有
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you, gratitudewise.

459
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,768
- 哦，我非常感谢各位的帮助　- 那你为什么把我们拒之门外呢？
- Oh, I'm very grateful. - Then why are you locking us out?

460
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:29,482
哦，过去几个星期里对大家确有不周之处，那是因为我感冒了…
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few weeks, what with my cold and... like that.

461
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,443
我们把你提上来，现在你却不理我们了
We went to bat for you. Now you won't play ball with us.

462
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,906
说到底，这是我的公寓，我的私人财产，不是公众的游乐场
After all, it's my apartment. It's private property, not a public playground.

463
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:41,285
你是不是也找了一个女朋友？这没有问题，你总不会每天晚上都做爱吧！
So you got yourself a girl. That's OK with us. But not every night in the week!

464
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,162
你怎么能这么自私呢？
How selfish can you get?

465
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:47,083
上个星期我不得不借我侄子的汽车，带着塞维利亚开车到泽西的汽车旅馆
Last week I had to use my nephew's car and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

466
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,253
我太老了，不能那样折腾，我是说在大众汽车里
I'm too old for that sort of thing... I mean in a Volkswagen.

467
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,673
我很同情你。相信我，我对此也非常的难过
I sympathize with you. Believe me, I'm very sorry.

468
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,093
- 你会为此更后悔的。　- 你在威胁我吗？
- You'll be a lot sorrier. - Are you threatening me?

469
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,346
听着，巴克斯特，我们可以提你上来，也可以把你踢回原形
Listen, Baxter. We made you and we can break you.

470
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,475
- 早上好，舍尔爵克先生。　- 早上好，先生们
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake. - Good morning, gentlemen.

471
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,729
- 巴克斯特，喜欢你的办公室吗？　- 是的，先生，非常感谢你的提携
- Baxter, do you like your office? - Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.

472
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,774
不要谢我，都是你这里的朋友大力推荐你的
Don't thank me. Your friends here recommended you.

473
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,695
我们顺便过来来祝他好运，我们知道你不会让我们失望的
- We just dropped by to wish him luck. - We know you won't let us down.

474
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,658
再见，有空过来坐坐。我办公室的大门…永远对你们敞开
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open... to my office.

475
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,536
我喜欢你处事的方式，巴克斯特先生
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

476
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,247
- 做经理的感觉如何？　- 哦，很好
- How does it feel to be an executive? - Oh, fine.

477
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,209
- 我会努力工作来增强你对我的信心　- 我相信你会的
- I'll work hard to justify your confidence. - I'm sure you will.

478
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:35,131
关于你公寓的事情，既然你已经提升了，我们能不能多配一把钥匙
About the apartment. Now that you've got a raise, can't we afford a second key?

479
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,675
- 我想没问题的　- 你知道我的秘书，奥尔森小姐？
- I guess so. - You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?

480
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,636
- 哦，她也是你喜欢的人之一吗？　- 哦，不不不
- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that? - Oh, no, no.

481
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:46,058
我只是说她是那种喜欢多管闲事的人，把钥匙递来递去的…
I just meant that she's kind of a busybody, and passing that key back and forth...

482
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,811
- 万一被她发现的话…　- 你不用太谨慎了
- Why take chances? - You can't be too careful.

483
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,981
对了，我想…我这里可能有一些东西是你的
Oh, I... have something I think belongs to you.

484
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,650
- 我的？　- 我是说那位年轻的女士，虽然我不知道她是谁
- Me? - I mean the young lady, whoever she is.

485
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,528
- 昨天晚上我回来的时候发现的　- 哦，谢谢
- I found it when I got back last night. - Oh. Thanks.

486
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,240
镜子是破的。当我发现的时候就是破的
The mirror is broken. It was broken when I found it.

487
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,703
- 哦，她用这镜子砸了我。　- 没事吧，先生？
- Yeah. She threw it at me. - Sir?

488
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,331
你知道这是什么回事的了，他们总不会让你好过的
You know how it is. They always give you a bad time.

489
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,540
哦，我知道
Yeah, I know how it is.

490
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:14,420
你每天对着一个女孩笑，他们就认为你要和你的妻子离婚
You see a girl every week for laughs and they think you're gonna divorce your wife.

491
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,757
- 我问你，这公平吗？　- 不，非常不公平
- Now I ask you, is that fair? - No, sir. It's very unfair.

492
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,926
特别是对你的妻子。是的
- Especially to your wife. - Yeah.

493
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:24,889
你知道，巴克斯特，我很羡慕你，一个单身汉，想干什么，就干什么，无所顾忌
You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor, all the dames you want, no complications.

494
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,599
那才是真正的生活
That's the life all right.

495
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,018
- 我星期四还需要那公寓　- 明白
- Put me down for Thursday again. - Roger.

496
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,437
到时候我就用那把钥匙
And I'll get that other key.

497
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:47,453
- 圣诞快乐，到时候再联系　- 圣诞快乐，联合生活
- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you. - Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

498
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,622
圣诞快乐，我正在打电话
Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.

499
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,791
喂？喂？
Yeah? Yeah?!

500
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,042
哪里？
Where?

501
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,418
你猜！
You bet!

502
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,965
有人占住我的线路。19楼有一个晚会
Somebody watch my line. There's a swingin' party on the 19th floor!

503
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,178
我们滑雪多快乐，我们坐在雪橇上
 Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

504
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:08,099
嗨，叮叮当，叮叮当，铃儿响叮当
 Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

505
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,477
我们滑雪多快乐，我们坐在雪橇上
 Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

506
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:33,165
于是我对他说：“去你的吧，要么自己找辆大卡车要么就换个小点儿的姑娘吧”
So I said to him "Never again. Either you get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."

507
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,085
库伯利克小姐…
Miss Kubelik? Miss...

508
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,462
- 圣诞快乐　- 谢谢
- Merry Christmas. - Thank you.

509
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,674
- 我感觉你好像在躲着我　- 为什么会这么想呢？
- I thought you were avoiding me. - What gave you that idea?

510
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:45,594
在6个星期里你只坐过一次我的电梯，而且还戴着帽子
In six weeks you've only been in my elevator once, and you kept on your hat.

511
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,181
事实上，那天晚上我等了很久，你都没有到，这确实让我很伤心
As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt that night you stood me up.

512
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,350
我知道，这的确不可原谅
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

513
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,102
- 我原谅你了　- 你不会的
- I forgive you. - You shouldn't.

514
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:56,689
这种事情你也没有办法的，你不可能突然对那个男人说…
You couldn't help it. You can't suddenly walk out on one man...

515
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,066
因为我和另外一个男人还有一个约会
...because you have a date with another man.

516
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,610
- 你做得没错　- 不要太自信
- You did the decent thing. - Don't be too sure.

517
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,197
就是因为我穿的是制服，这并不能使我成为一个女童子军
Just because I wear a uniform, that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

518
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:10,119
第二管理助理应该是一个非常好的职位
A second administrative assistant has to be a pretty good judge of character.

519
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,705
而且据我所知，你非常优秀
And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

520
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:17,543
我使说你非常的优雅，有气质
I mean decencywise and... otherwisewise.

521
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,837
干杯
Cheers.

522
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,841
- 再来一杯　- 我操作电梯的时候不能喝酒
- One more. - I shouldn't drink while driving.

523
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:29,055
你说得很对，凭借我的权利我宣布这部电梯停止工作
You're so right. By the power vested in me, I declare this elevator out of order.

524
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,557
我们去和他们一起狂欢吗？
Shall we join the natives?

525
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:35,227
- 为什么不呢，他们这么的友好　- 你还不相信吗？
- Why not? They seem friendly enough. - Don't you believe it.

526
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:39,523
这里将有人作出牺牲…白领们将东西投进计算机
There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar workers tossed into computers...

527
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,901
打得全是小方孔
...and punched full of little square holes.

528
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,236
- 你喝了几杯了？　- 三杯
- How many drinks did you have? - Three!

529
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,573
- 我想也是的　- 等一下，我听到了流水声
- I thought so. - Wait. I hear the sound of running water.

530
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,367
- 我马上就回来　- 我等你
- I'll be right back! - I'll be right here.

531
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,412
嗨！
Hi!

532
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,165
你好，来自堪萨斯的分部经理？
How's the branch manager from Kansas City?

533
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,000
- 对不起，请再说一遍　- 我是奥尔森小姐
- I beg your pardon? - I'm Miss Olsen.

534
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,086
舍尔爵克先生的秘书
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

535
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,588
所以你不要在我面前装无辜。
So you don't have to play innocent with me.

536
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,759
他曾经告诉他妻子我是来自西雅图的经理
He used to tell his wife I was the branch manager from Seattle...

537
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:11,222
四年前当我们在一起疯狂的玩乐的时候…
...four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding-ding.

538
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:16,227
- 我不知道你在说什么　- 在我之前是审计部的罗斯小姐
- I don't know what you're talking about. - Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.

539
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,021
在我之后是死亡险部门的科奇小姐
And after me it was Miss Koch in Disability.

540
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,524
在你之前也是一个小姐，呃…
And right before you was a Miss, um...

541
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,026
哦，她叫什么名字，在25楼工作
Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.

542
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:27,696
你应该说声对不起？为什么？你什么都没有做
- Would you excuse me? - What for? You haven't done anything.

543
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,117
是他，哦，那个推销员！
It's him. Oh, what a salesman!

544
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,036
总是坐在那个中餐厅同样的位子…
Always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant...

545
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:37,289
…又用同样的借口和他妻子离婚
...and the same pitch about divorcing his wife.

546
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,796
然后，最后一切都鸡飞蛋打
Then, in the end, you wind up with egg foo yung on your face.

547
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,090
库伯利克小姐
Miss Kubelik!

548
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,885
哦，谢谢你，奥尔森小姐
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

549
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:54,223
非常乐意为我们的服务姑娘稍尽绵薄之力
Always happy to do a little something for our girls in uniform.

550
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,476
你还好吗？出什么事情了吗？
Are you all right? What's the matter?

551
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,229
没有，只是这里人太多了
Nothing. There are just too many people here.

552
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:04,316
为什么不到我的办公室坐坐呢？有些事情我想征求你的意见
Why don't we step into my office? There's something I want your opinion about.

553
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:09,238
我现在已经拥有自己的办公室。我是公司第二个最年轻的经理
I have my own office now. I'm the second youngest executive in this company.

554
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:13,159
另一个年轻人是董事长的孙子
The only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.

555
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,454
觉得怎么样？
Do you mind?

556
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,086
库伯利克小姐，我想听听你的真实意见
Miss Kubelik, I would like your honest opinion.

557
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:27,506
我已经放在我办公室桌子下面一个星期了，还花了我15美元
I've had this under my desk for a week. It cost me $15.

558
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,010
我还没有完全准备好去戴它
I haven't been able to get up enough nerve to wear it.

559
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,645
这是他们说的高级经理的模样，你认为怎么样？
It's what they call the Junior Executive model. What do you think?

560
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,943
我想我是不是犯了一个愚蠢的错误，呃？
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

561
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,321
- 我觉得很好　- 真的吗？
- I like it. - Really?

562
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,365
你不要觉得戴这帽子很丢人
You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in this hat?

563
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:57,494
- 当然不会　- 也许如果我往这边歪一点
- Of course not. - Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.

564
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,372
- 那样是不是好些？　- 好多了
- Is that better? - Much better.

565
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,209
既然你不怕被我看到你戴这帽子.
Since you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me...

566
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,462
我们今天晚上出去如何，你，我，还有这高帽子
...how about goin' out tonight... you, me and the bowler?

567
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,381
我们在第五大街逛逛，好好休息一下
We'll stroll down 5th Avenue, sort of break it in.

568
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:13,385
- 今天我心情不太好　- 我明白，圣诞节不能和家人在一起
- This is a bad day for me. - I understand. Christmas and family.

569
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,888
我要回去了，否则我会被炒掉的.
I'd better get back to my elevator or I'll be fired.

570
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:19,892
不要担心，我想我在人事部还有一些影响力
Don't worry about that. I've got quite a bit of influence with Personnel.

571
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,144
你认识舍尔爵克先生吗？
You know Mr. Sheldrake?

572
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,898
- 怎么了？　- 他和我的关系就像这样
- Why? - He and I are like that.

573
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,817
他送给我一张圣诞卡片，看到没有？
Sent me a Christmas card. See?

574
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,243
很漂亮的卡片
Makes a cute picture.

575
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,871
我会和舍尔爵克先生说让他提升你
I could talk to Mr. Sheldrake. Get you a promotion.

576
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:46,752
你想做一个电梯操作班长吗？太多女孩比我优秀
- Would you like to be an elevator starter? - Too many girls have seniority over me.

577
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,214
没有问题，为什么我们不讨论一下假期呢？
No problem. Why don't we discuss it over the holidays?

578
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:54,760
我会给你打电话，邀请你出来，让大家都知道，还有我戴这顶帽子！
I could call you, pick you up, have a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?

579
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,054
我知道了，这里
I think so. Here.

580
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,224
是不是翘得太厉害了？这是一家很保守的公司
It's not tilted too much? This is a conservative firm.

581
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:03,519
我不想让人们误认为我是一个哗众取宠的人
I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer.

582
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,025
怎么了？
What's the matter?

583
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,281
- 你的镜子，好像破了。　- 是的，我知道
- The mirror. It's broken. - Yes, I know.

584
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,285
我喜欢这样。让我可以按照我想要的方式照镜子
I like it that way. Makes me look the way I feel.

585
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,749
你的电话
Your phone.

586
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,465
是吗？
Yes?

587
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,801
哦，等一下
Uh, just a minute.

588
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:40,556
- 如果你不介意的话，这是一个私人电话。　- 圣诞快乐
- If you don't mind, this is sort of personal. - Have a nice Christmas.

589
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,315
舍尔爵克先生
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

590
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:55,654
不，我没有忘，我家的圣诞树已经做好了，汤姆和杰瑞的礼物我都放在冰箱了
No, I didn't forget. The tree is up and the Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.

591
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,948
是的，圣诞快乐
Yes, sir. Same to you.

592
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,644
嘿，你准备去哪儿，巴德小伙？
Hey! Where are you goin', Buddy-boy?

593
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,022
晚会才开始
The party's just starting.

594
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,525
听着，小伙子，给我安排一个时间，明天下午如何？
Listen, kid. Gimme a break. How about tomorrow afternoon?

595
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:39,281
我再也不能带她去车上做爱了，汽车没有空调？四点如何，好吗？
I can't take her to that drive-in again. The car has no heater. Four o'clock. OK?

596
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:21,073
嗨，查理，给我一小杯波旁，快上来，我的雪橇是双人座
Hey, Charlie! Gimme a shot of bourbon, and step on it! My sleigh is double-parked!

597
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,560
你给我买一杯酒，我给你放一些音乐
You buy me a drink, I'll buy you some music.

598
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,812
罗姆克林斯
Rum Collins.

599
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,157
呃…
Uh...

600
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,994
罗姆克林斯…这些年轻母亲之一
Rum Collins and... another one of these little mothers.

601
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,008
你喜欢卡斯特罗吗？
You like Castro?

602
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:06,011
我的意思是说你对卡斯特罗的看法如何？
I mean, how do you feel about Castro?

603
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:09,973
- 谁是卡斯特罗？　- 你知道的，古巴的大人物
- What is Castro? - You know. That big shot down in Cuba.

604
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,267
- 留着一个大胡子　- 他怎么了
- With the crazy beard. - What about him?

605
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,687
因为据我所知，他是一个不折不扣的大流氓
Cause as far as I'm concerned, he's a no-good fink.

606
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,191
两个星期之前，我给他写信他却没有给我回复
Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter. Never even answered me.

607
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,317
那又怎么样？
That so?

608
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:24,238
我让他做的就只是放米奇出来过圣诞节
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.

609
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,448
- 谁是米奇？　- 我丈夫
- Who's Mickey? - My husband.

610
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:29,159
他现在在哈瓦那坐牢
He's in Havana, in jail.

611
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,830
- 他参加了那次革命吗？　- 米奇不会坐那样的事情的
- Mixed up in that revolution? - Mickey would do nothin' like that.

612
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:36,708
他是一个训马师，他们让他训马
He's a jockey. They caught him dopin' a horse.

613
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,211
哦，那你不要对他们抱什么希望
Well, you can't win 'em all.

614
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,970
今天是圣诞前夜，整栋房子
'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house

615
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,222
没有一点生气…
Not a creature was stirrin'...

616
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:54,059
什么都没有，一点动静都没有
Nothin'. No action.

617
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,478
极度沉闷，无聊至极
Dullsville.

618
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,730
- 你结婚了吗？　- 没有
- You married? - No.

619
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,983
- 有家庭吗？　- 没有
- Family? - No.

620
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:06,363
这样的一个夜晚，想你这样的幽灵走进一间空荡荡的公寓
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.

621
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:12,077
我说我没有家庭，这不代表我的公寓就是空荡荡的
I said I had no family. I didn't say I had an empty apartment.

622
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,418
快点，弗兰，不要这样子了
Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.

623
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,046
你还打算坐在这里不停地抱怨我吗？
Are you just gonna sit there and keep bawling?

624
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,550
为什么不和我说话呢？你总要告诉我哪里做错了吧
You won't talk to me? You won't tell me what's wrong?

625
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:33,265
我知道你认为我在推托你…假设当你结婚12年后
I know you think I'm stalling you but... when you've been married for 12 years...

626
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:38,020
你能硬下心肠说“我已经厌倦了，咱们离婚吧！”
...you just don't sit down to breakfast and say "Pass the sugar. I want a divorce."

627
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,772
很多事情不是想象的那么容易
It's not that easy.

628
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:46,778
总之，现在的时机还不成熟，我儿子正在放假，岳父母也还在我家里住着
Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are off school, my in-laws are visiting.

629
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,947
我不能现在和他们撕破脸皮，
I can't bring it up now.

630
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:55,954
这不象你啊，弗兰，你是个非常开朗的女孩，和你在一起总是很开心的
This isn't like you, Fran. You were always such a good sport. Such fun to be with.

631
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:02,628
对，我是一个快乐的傻瓜，总被人笑话
That's me. The happy idiot. A million laughs.

632
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:07,883
好了，这样才对嘛，至少你能和我说话了
Well, that's a little more like it. At least you're speaking to me.

633
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,220
今天公司晚会我碰到了一件有趣的事情
A funny thing happened to me at the office party today.

634
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,890
我碰到了你的秘书，奥尔森小姐
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.

635
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,934
你知道的，一个曾经和你热恋的人
You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?

636
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,813
我被她气死了，我不想活了
And I laughed so much, I like to died.

637
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:26,568
弗兰，是这件事情在困扰你吗？奥尔森小姐？都是陈年旧事了
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran? Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.

638
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:29,821
哎呀，我的记性向来都不是太好
Well, I never was very good at history.

639
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:34,743
让我来帮你想想，先是奥尔森小姐，然后是洛斯小姐
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi.

640
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,996
不，她还在前面，奥尔森小姐，后面是科其小姐
No, she came before. Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.

641
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,499
好了，弗兰…你现在想一想
- Now, Fran... - And just think.

642
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:44,503
这个房子里是不是还要有人像我一样成为你的幸运女孩？
Right now some lucky girl in the building is gonna come after me.

643
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,422
不要说了，弗兰，我想也许是我罪有应得
OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.

644
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:51,677
但是你问问你自己：为什么一个男人会追求这么多的女孩，这么花心？
But ask yourself: Why does a man run around with a lot of girls?

645
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,597
因为他在家里不开心，因为他很孤独，这才是真正的原因
Because he's unhappy at home. Because he's lonely. That's why.

646
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:59,017
这些都在你之前，弗兰，我现在已经不再花心了
But that was before you, Fran. I've stopped running.

647
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:04,648
我怎么会这么愚蠢呢？你肯定在想我早就被你吃透了
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would've learned by now.

648
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:09,361
当你爱上一个已婚男人的时候，就注定没有好结局。
When you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.

649
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:13,240
弗兰，今天是圣诞夜，我们不要吵架，好吗？
It's Christmas Eve, Fran. Let's not fight, huh?

650
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,036
- 圣诞快乐！　- 这是什么？
- Merry Christmas. - What is it?

651
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,211
我们中餐厅朋友送的
Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.

652
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:32,718
- 谢谢，弗兰，我们最好把它放在这里。　- 是的。
- Thanks, Fran. We'd better keep it here. - Yeah, we'd better.

653
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,554
对了，我也为你准备了一份礼物
Oh, I have a present for you.

654
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:40,058
我不知道给你买什么东西好，另外…我也很不喜欢去逛街买东西，因此…
I didn't know what to get you. Besides, it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...

655
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,729
我给你100美元，你自己看着喜欢什么就买什么吧！
Here's $100. You go and buy yourself something.

656
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,903
在伯格道夫专卖店有一些很好的鳄鱼皮包
They have some nice alligator bags at Bergdorf's.

657
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:07,753
想不到现在这么晚了，都已经七点差十分了，我现在必须去赶火车去了
I didn't realize it was so late. It's quarter to seven. I mustn't miss my train.

658
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:12,507
如果不是我们已经浪费了这么多时间的话，我可能现在已经到家修剪圣诞树了
If we hadn't wasted all this time... I have to get home and trim the tree.

659
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:16,887
那好，我就当作是我陪你的报酬
OK. I just thought, as long as it was paid for...

660
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,097
弗兰，不要这样说话
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.

661
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:23,393
不要把自己说得这么不值钱，100美元？我才不会这么便宜的！
- Don't make yourself out to be cheap. - $100? I don't call that cheap.

662
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,606
你是不是还给这间公寓的人付过钱了？
And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment.

663
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,900
住嘴，弗兰
Stop it, Fran.

664
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,028
杰夫，你快赶不上火车了
You'll miss your train, Jeff.

665
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,205
你和我一起出去吗？
Are you coming?

666
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,957
不，你先走，我还要补补妆
No, you run along. I'm gonna fix my face.

667
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,627
不要忘记关灯，我们星期一见
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.

668
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:52,380
好的，星期一…星期四
Sure. Monday... and Thursday...

669
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,801
然后又是星期一，又是星期四
...and Monday again, and Thursday again.

670
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:00,639
弗兰，这种情况不会很久的
It won't always be like this, Fran.

671
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,933
我爱你
I love you.

672
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,393
小心一点，不要沾到口红了
Careful. Lipstick.

673
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,772
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

674
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:39,673
- 快喝完，要关门了　- 还早呢，查理
- Drink up, pop. It's closing time. - But it's early, Charlie.

675
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,385
- 难道你不知道今天是什么日子吗？　- 我知道，查理
- Don't you know what night this is? - I know, Charlie. I know.

676
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,637
我为一个团体工作
I work for the outfit.

677
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,979
嗨，快停下来，听到没有？快回家
Hey, knock it off, will ya? Go home.

678
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,406
出去！出去！
O-U-T. Out!

679
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,997
我们去哪里？我的地方还是你的？
Where'll we go? My place or yours?

680
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,003
最好到我那里去，他们每个人都这样干
Might as well go to mine. Everybody else does.

681
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:35,020
可怜的宝贝，我还在想那个在哈瓦那坐牢的可怜虫
Poor Mickey. When I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana...

682
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,355
你想看看他的照片吗？
Would you like to see his picture?

683
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,607
不是很想看
Not particularly.

684
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:45,739
他很聪明，身高5英尺2英寸，99磅
He's so cute. He's 5 foot 2, 99 pounds.

685
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,033
就像一个吉娃娃那样可爱
Like a little Chihuahua.

686
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,923
- 我能问你一个私人的问题吗？　- 没问题
- Can I ask you a personal question? - No.

687
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,051
你有女朋友吗？
You got a girlfriend?

688
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:09,054
她可能是一个姑娘，但她不是我的女朋友
She may be a girl but she is no friend of mine.

689
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:13,391
- 你还想她，不是吗？　- 很明显你不太了解我
- Still stuck on her, huh? - Obviously you don't know me very well.

690
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,269
- 我根本不了解你　- 让我来自我介绍一下
- I don't know you at all. - Permit me.

691
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:23,109
CC·巴克斯特，高级经理，亚瑟墨里大学毕业，还不错吧
C.C. Baxter. Junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate... lover.

692
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:26,738
我叫麦戈道格拉斯·马吉夫人
I'm Mrs. MacDougall. Margie to you.

693
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,116
这边走，麦戈道格拉斯夫人
This way, Mrs. MacDougall.

694
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,380
哦，这是一间单身公寓
Say! This is snugsville!

695
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,091
麦戈道格拉斯夫人，我要警告你，不要乱说话。
Mrs. MacDougall, it's only fair to warn you...

696
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:49,594
你现在是和我这样一个如饥似渴的风骚女人一起。
...you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.

697
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:52,430
- 别逗了　- 问问这附近的人
- No kiddin'! - Ask anybody around here.

698
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:56,601
事实上，往常这个时候我都要离开这里的，十分不爽
As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go... and I may go just like that...

699
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:59,646
我已经承诺把我的身体在我上天堂后捐给哥伦比亚医学研究中心
I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.

700
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,774
切！你这种大笨鹅才会这样想
Gee! Sort of gives you goose bumps just to think about it.

701
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:06,236
宝贝，他们还没有最后拿走我的身体，从厨房拿些冰出来
They haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen.

702
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:09,280
春宵一刻值千金，快点来啊
Let's not waste any more time preliminarywise.

703
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,491
我就来，亲爱的
I'm with you, lover.

704
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,570
好了，库伯利克小姐，快起来
All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.

705
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,531
快点，时间已经过了
Come on. It's past checking-out time.

706
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:38,077
如果你现在从这里出去，我会对你感激不尽的
The management would appreciate it if you'd get the hell outta here.

707
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:46,211
我是曾经喜欢你，非常的喜欢你，可是…我们之间已经没有什么了，快走开
I used to like you. I used to like you a lot. Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.

708
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,922
出去！出——去！
O-U-T, out!

709
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,175
快点，快醒醒
Come on, wake up.

710
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,642
哦，天啊
Oh my God.

711
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,894
库伯利克小姐？
Miss Kubelik?

712
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,688
库伯利克小姐？

713
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:18,284
为了把这个破托盘拿出来，我的指甲也被弄断了
I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.

714
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,579
你应该买一个新冰箱了
You oughta buy yourself a new refrigerator.

715
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,875
我不是指现在
I didn't mean right now!

716
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,922
爵发斯医生
Dr. Dreyfuss.

717
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,508
医生
Doc!

718
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:38,471
我这里有一位姑娘吃了很多安眠药，我叫不醒她
There's a girl in my place, took some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.

719
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,765
- 等我拿一下我的医药包　- 快一点
- Let me get my bag. - Hurry up!

720
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,229
嘿，在这里，亲爱的！你跑来跑去干什么？
Hey, over here, lover. What's all the running around about?

721
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:49,107
你现在自己穿衣服出去
You're gonna wear yourself out.

722
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,443
- 不要这么粗鲁，亲爱的　- 晚安
- Not so rough, honey! - Good night.

723
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,612
- 晚安？　- 聚会结束了
- Good night?! - The party's over.

724
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,948
什么？难道我做错了什么吗？
What? Did I do somethin' wrong?

725
01:07:57,115 --> 01:08:00,410
是一个意外，我们再约时间吧
It's an emergency. I'll see you some other time.

726
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,620
不是这一个，在那里，医生
Not this one. In there, Doc.

727
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:07,292
- 这里到底发生什么了？　- 你能现在给我出去吗？
- What's goin' on here, anyway? - Will you please just get out?!

728
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,960
我的鞋！
My shoes!

729
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:12,130
你是这么的可人，性感！
Some lover you are! Some sexpot!

730
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,966
快去找一个电话亭，给你哈瓦那的老公打个电话
Here. Find a phone. Call your husband in Havana.

731
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:20,596
你说对了，我会告诉他你怎么对待我的，他会把你揍成猪头一样
You bet I will! And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in!

732
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,807
人渣！
You fink!

733
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,325
她没事吧，医生？
Is she gonna be all right, Doc?

734
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:44,495
- 那瓶里还有多少安眠药　- 大概半瓶吧，12粒左右
- How many pills were in that bottle? - It was half-full. About a dozen.

735
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,665
- 你不需要把她送到医院吧？　- 帮帮我，好吗？
- Do you have to take her to the hospital? - Help me, will you?

736
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,418
- 快把她扶到洗手间　- 你有什么打算？
- Into the bathroom. - What are you gonna do?

737
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:53,338
让她把安眠药吐出来，希望不要太迟
Get that stuff out of her stomach if it isn't too late.

738
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:56,215
你要干的事情就是冲好一些咖啡，然后待在一边祈祷
You'd better put some coffee on, and pray.

739
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,231
拿着我的包
Bring my bag.

740
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,076
把她右边的袖子卷起来
Roll up her right sleeve.

741
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,921
拿着
Hold that.

742
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,972
好美丽的血管
Nice veins.

743
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:40,486
能告诉我发生什么事情了吗？
Wanna tell me what happened?

744
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,364
我不知道，我的意思是，开始我根本不在这里
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.

745
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:50,121
你知道的，我们前段时间不是讨论过这样的事情嘛
You see, we had... some words earlier.

746
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:54,459
没有什么严重，事实上就是我们情人间的吵架
It was nothin' serious. You might call it a lovers' quarrel.

747
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,296
于是你就跑出去，很快就认识了另外一位夫人
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.

748
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:03,259
就是那，你知道，巴克斯特，你还是很讨人喜欢的
- Something like that. - You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.

749
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,969
对，确实如此
Yes, you are.

750
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:18,316
如果你晚回来半个小时的，你可能已经收到一份特别的圣诞节礼物
If you'd come home half an hour later, you'd have had quite a Christmas present.

751
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,170
把咖啡拿过来
Get the coffee.

752
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:05,571
把窗户打开透透气
Let's get some air in here. Open the windows.

753
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,880
她叫什么名字？
What's her name?

754
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,758
库伯利克·弗兰小姐
Miss Kubelik. Fran.

755
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:34,308
弗兰，我是一个医生，我在这里是因为你吃了过量的安眠药
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills.

756
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,686
你明白我说什么吗？
Do you understand what I'm saying?

757
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,899
弗兰，我是爵福斯医生，我是来帮你的
Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss. I'm here to help you.

758
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:45,027
你吃了那所有的安眠药？还记得吗？
You took all those sleeping pills. Remember?

759
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,824
- 安眠药　- 对，弗兰，我还是个医生
- Sleeping pills. - That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

760
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,536
- 医生？　- 爵福斯医生
- Doctor? - Dr. Dreyfuss.

761
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,540
爵福斯
Dreyfuss.

762
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,750
再多拿点咖啡过来
Get more coffee.

763
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,129
现在你再告诉我，我叫什么名字？
Now tell me again. What's my name?

764
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:08,634
爵福斯医生
Dr... Dreyfuss.

765
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,928
你刚才干了什么？
And what happened to you?

766
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,097
我…
I...

767
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:15,391
我吃了安眠药
I took sleeping pills.

768
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:18,436
你知道你现在在哪里吗？
Do you know where you are?

769
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,691
- 不知道　- 好，做得很好，弗兰，现在要集中精神
- No. - Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!

770
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,653
我不知道
I don't know.

771
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,615
你知道他是谁吗？
Do you know who that is?

772
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,457
看着他
Look at him.

773
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,419
19楼的巴克斯特先生
Mr. Baxter. 19th floor.

774
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,130
你好，库伯利克小姐
Hello, Miss Kubelik.

775
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,133
先生？小姐？你们怎么这么客气啊？
Mr? Miss? Such politeness!

776
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:54,472
我们在同一栋大厦工作，我们不想惊动别人
We work in the same building. We try to keep it quiet.

777
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,809
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

778
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:04,023
你还记得我们在公司的晚会上在一起吗？
Don't you remember we were together at the office party?

779
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,567
哦，是的，公司晚会
Oh, yes. The office party.

780
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:09,320
- 还有奥尔森小姐　- 对
- Miss Olsen. - That's right.

781
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:12,365
我告诉你我们吵了一架，这就是整件事情的缘由
I told you we had a fight. That was what it was about.

782
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:15,910
奥尔森小姐开始的时候也在这里
Miss Olsen. That girl that was here earlier.

783
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:20,164
我不明白
I don't understand.

784
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:25,711
整件事情就是我及时赶回，你也没事了，你说呢，医生
The main thing is I got here in time and you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?

785
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,839
我很累
I'm so tired.

786
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,092
快点，把这些喝下去
Come on. Drink this.

787
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,095
求求你了…让我睡觉吧！
Please... just let me sleep.

788
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:38,140
不行，你现在不能睡觉。听着，弗兰，睁开眼睛
No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!

789
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,851
让我们来扶着她走路
Let's get her walking.

790
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:48,025
在接下来的几个小时我们必须让她保持清醒。快点，弗兰，走路
We've got to keep her awake for the next few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!

791
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:53,197
1，2，3，4
One, two, three, four!

792
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,533
左，右，左，右…
Left, right, left, right...

793
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,868
…左，右，再来！
...left, right and return!

794
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:01,205
1，2，3，4！
And... one, two, three, four!

795
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:04,750
就这样，继续！1，2，3，4
Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!

796
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:08,129
走路，弗兰！1，2，3，4
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!

797
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,923
左，右，再来！
One, two... And return again.

798
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,260
左，右，左，右…
And... left, right, left, right.

799
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:24,729
在接下来的24小时内，她会时醒时睡
She'll sleep on and off for the next 24 hours.

800
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:28,566
好的，等她醒了，她还需要好好的睡上一觉才行
Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

801
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,901
直到她完全好了为止
Just as long as she's OK.

802
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:36,407
这些活儿对于医生来说比病人更辛苦，我应该按照公里收费
These cases are harder on the doctor than the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.

803
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:39,702
- 还有咖啡吗？　- 是的，当然有
- Any of that coffee left? - Yeah, sure.

804
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,080
她的名字怎么拼？
How do you spell her last name?

805
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,708
库伯利克，两个K
Kubelik. Two k's.

806
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,918
她的地址？
What's her address?

807
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,755
她住在哪里？
Where does she live?

808
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,216
医生，你问这些有什么用？
Why do you wanna know, Doc?

809
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:58,387
- 你不用报告这些东西不是吗？　- 这是惯例
- You don't have to report this, do you? - It's regulations.

810
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:03,476
这是个意外，她喝太多了，都不知道自己在干什么！
But it was an accident. She had too much to drink, didn't know what she was doing.

811
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,770
不要给她留下什么自杀或者其他的记录
There was no suicide note or anything.

812
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:09,065
- 我要为她着想！　- 你也是吧！
- I'm not thinkin' about myself. - Aren't you?

813
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:12,651
她还有家，办公室的同事
She's got a family, and there's the people at the office.

814
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:16,697
你能不能忘记你是一个医生，只是把自己当作我的邻居
Can't you forget you're a doctor, just say you're here as a neighbor?

815
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,742
好吧，作为一个医生，我不能说这是一个意外！
Well, as a doctor, I can't prove it wasn't an accident.

816
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:23,037
但是作为你的邻居，我很想揍你一顿
But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick you around the block.

817
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,748
- 我把这个冷冻一下你介意吗？　- 自便
- Mind if I cool this off? - Help yourself.

818
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,292
我不知道你对这个女孩作了什么
I don't know what you did to that girl...

819
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,961
但是现在事情都已经发生了，不管你是采取什么方式
...but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on.

820
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,631
种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆，不管什么结果，都是需要你自己承担的
Live now, pay later. Diners Club!

821
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:38,469
巴克斯特，你为什么这么不成熟呢？你要成为一个高尚的人
Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch.

822
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,971
- 你知道我什么意思吗？　- 不是很明确
- You know what that means? - I'm not sure.

823
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,265
一个高尚的人，一个真正受人尊敬的人
A mensch! A human being!

824
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:47,186
这次你幸运逃脱，这是你的运气
So you got off easy this time. So you were lucky.

825
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:52,066
但是你不可能老是这么走运的，因为江山易改，本性难移，你还是会这样干
But you're not out of the woods yet, because most of 'em try it again.

826
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,694
好了，如果你需要我，你应该知道在哪里找我
Well, you know where I am if you need me.

827
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,519
巴克斯特先生？这么早就出去
Mr. Baxter! Open up already.

828
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,691
哦
Oh.

829
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,236
- 李伯曼夫人　- 你以为是谁？克瑞斯·克瑞格？
- Mrs. Lieberman. - Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?

830
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,447
昨天晚上这里怎么了？
What was going on here last night?

831
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:24,950
昨晚？好像在行军一样！咚咚咚的！
- Last night? - All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!

832
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:28,704
可能是军队演习吧？我再也不会邀请那些家伙了
- Army maneuvers maybe? - I'll never invite those people again.

833
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:33,042
把房子出租给单身汉感觉好吧？整晚上都没有睡个10分钟的安稳觉
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.

834
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:38,714
- 我肯定你把爵福斯医生喊起来了　- 不要担心，他现在出去看病去了
- And I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss. - Don't worry. He was out on a case.

835
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:43,969
巴克斯特先生，我警告你：这是高级公寓，不是下等旅社。
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter. This is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.

836
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,222
快点，奥斯卡
Come on, Oscar.

837
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:17,795
总机，请帮我接通白色庄园的JD·舍尔爵克先生的电话
Operator, I want White Plains, New York. Mr. J.D. Sheldrake.

838
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:20,047
记住这是一个私人电话
Make that person-to-person.

839
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:27,805
5，4，3，2，1…
Five, four, three, two, one...

840
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:30,516
让她全速前进
Let her rip!

841
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,267
我来接电话
I'll get the phone.

842
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,354
爸爸，为什么我们不在火箭这里放一只苍蝇呢
Hey, Dad, why don't we put a fly in the nose cone?

843
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:38,399
- 如果我们能把它活着带回来的话　- 好主意
- See if we can bring it back alive. - That's a thought.

844
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:42,611
也许我们能够放两只苍蝇，看他们能不能在太空中繁殖
Maybe we should put in two flies and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

845
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,907
- 看她们能干什么？　- 繁殖啊，你知道，就是生小苍蝇
- See if they'll what? - Propagate. You know. Multiply.

846
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:50,828
- 小苍蝇　- 呵，呵
- Baby flies? - Oh. Oh!

847
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,164
- 你的电话，爸爸　- 谢谢，杰夫
- It's for you, Dad. - Thanks, Jeff.

848
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:57,501
一个叫巴克斯特的先生，说是私人电话
A Mr. Baxter. Person-to-person.

849
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:00,254
快点，帮我放一些苍蝇
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

850
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:06,010
- 你好？巴克斯特先生，你脑子出问题了么？　- 发生了一些很重要的事情
- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter? - Something came up that's important.

851
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:09,513
我想你最好尽快赶到我的公寓和我见面
I think you should see me at the apartment as soon as possible.

852
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:13,350
- 究竟是怎么回事？　- 我不想在电话上谈这件事情
- What's this all about? - I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.

853
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:18,605
在晚会后，你知道我的意思，我昨天晚上在我的公寓发现她了
But that certain party... You know who I mean. I found her here last night.

854
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,942
- 她服用了大量的安眠药　- 什么？
- She took an overdose of sleeping pills. - What?!

855
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:27,239
- 杰夫，是谁啊，你和谁讲电话呢？　- 我们的一个员工出了意外
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone? - One of our employees had an accident.

856
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:30,784
我不知道为什么他们总是在圣诞节用这些事情来烦我
I don't know why they bother me with these things on Christmas Day.

857
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,745
是的，巴克斯特先生
Yes, Baxter.

858
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,205
情况有多严重
Just how serious is it?

859
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:39,001
还好，危险期已经过了，但是她现在还在沉睡
It was touch and go there for a while, but she's sleeping it off now.

860
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,212
我想你最好当她醒来的时候能在这里
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.

861
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:47,676
那不可能，巴克斯特，你要一个人帮我搞定这件事情
That's impossible. You'll have to handle the situation yourself, Baxter.

862
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:52,222
- 事实上，我非常相信你的能力　- 知道，先生，我明白
- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you. - Yes, sir. I understand.

863
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:56,727
她留下一封信，你需要我现在打开给你读信的内容吗？
She left a letter. Would you like me to open it and read it to you?

864
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:59,563
当然，这只是一个建议
Well, it was just a suggestion.

865
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:03,609
而且我已经把你的名字擦掉了，你不用担心
No, don't worry. I kept your name out of it, so there'll be no trouble...

866
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,320
警察局或者媒体方面会有什么麻烦
...policewise or newspaperwise.

867
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:11,867
你知道，这个医生是我的朋友，这方面你也不用太过担心
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine, so we were very lucky in that respect.

868
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,536
事实上，他都以为她是我的女朋友
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

869
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,581
这只是他的错误判断
No, he just jumped to the conclusion.

870
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:20,542
在这附近我被他们认为是一个花花公子
Around here I'm known as quite a ladies' man.

871
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:24,922
当然，我们现在还没有完全脱离危险，有时候，他们还会找麻烦的
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet. Sometimes they try it again.

872
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:28,926
我明白，我会尽量摆平这一切，估计她可能还要好几天才能完全康复
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her a couple of days to fully recover...

873
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:32,429
而且房东太太那里还会有一些麻烦
...and I may have a little problem with the landlady.

874
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:36,558
好了，舍尔爵克先生，我会尽可能的把她留在公寓里
OK, Mr. Sheldrake. I'll keep her in the apartment as long as I can.

875
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:40,270
你需要我给你传些什么口信吗？
Isn't there some sort of message you want me to give her?

876
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,940
哦，让我想想
Well, I'll... think of something.

877
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:45,651
好吧，再见，舍尔爵克先生
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

878
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,614
对不起
I'm sorry.

879
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,910
- 非常抱歉，巴克斯特先生。　- 你怎么能下床乱走呢？
- I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter. - What are you doing out of bed?

880
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:58,247
我不知道这会是你的公寓
I didn't know. I had no idea this was your apartment.

881
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:01,125
到这里，我来帮你
Here. Let me help you.

882
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,627
我没脸活下去了
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

883
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,796
你为什么不让我死呢？
Why didn't you just let me die?

884
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:11,468
这是什么话？你只是情绪有些失控，但是现在一切都过去了
What kind of talk is that? You got a little overemotional, but you're fine now.

885
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,095
哦
Oh!

886
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:17,516
我的头好痛，好想要裂了一样
Oh, my head! It feels just like a big wad of chewing gum.

887
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:20,436
- 现在几点了？　- 2点
- What time is it? - Two o'clock.

888
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,813
我的衣服到哪里去了，我现在要回家
Oh, my dress. I have to go home.

889
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,399
你现在不适合到任何地方去，只能马上给我回到床上去
You're in no shape to go anywhere but back to bed.

890
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,985
- 你不希望我在这里　- 怎么会呢
- You don't want me here. - Sure I do. I...

891
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:31,280
圣诞节的时候有人做伴真好
It's always nice to have company for Christmas.

892
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:34,950
我没事，我只想刷牙
- I'm stronger than you are. - I just wanna brush my teeth.

893
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:38,620
哦，当然可以，我想你可以在那里找到一个新的牙刷
Oh. Of course. I think I can find a new toothbrush somewhere.

894
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,498
在这里，把衣服穿上
Here. Put that on.

895
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:13,864
- 想吃点早餐吗？　- 不，我没有胃口
- How about some breakfast? - No. I don't want anything.

896
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,033
我来给你倒一些咖啡吧！
I'll fix you some coffee.

897
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,496
哦，竟然都喝光了，你昨天晚上喝太多了
Oh! We're all out of coffee. You had quite a lot last night.

898
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,706
我马上回来
Back in a minute.

899
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,384
爵福斯太太，你能借我一些咖啡吗
Mrs. Dreyfuss, could I borrow some coffee?

900
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:38,347
- 加一个桔子和两个鸡蛋？　- 鸡蛋，他为我要的，还有桔子！
- And an orange and a couple of eggs? - Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!

901
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:42,976
你现在需要好好补补身体，我老公，就是你的医生，从来都不对我隐瞒的
What you need is a good horsewhipping! From me the doctor has no secrets.

902
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:45,354
可怜的姑娘，干什么要干这样的傻事呢
Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?

903
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,523
我什么也没干，实话说，这只是…
I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...

904
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:54,821
你和她在一起只是为了玩乐，而她却认为你值得托付终身
You take a girl out just for laughs and she thinks you're serious marriagewise.

905
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:58,408
大人物，对于你，我才懒的伺候你
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!

906
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:01,745
但对于她，我将会准备一些东西喂她吃
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

907
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,922
你在和谁打电话？
Who are you calling?

908
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:14,216
我姐姐，告诉她我发生什么事了
My sister, to tell her what happened to me.

909
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:19,388
等一下，我们先来谈一谈，你打算告诉她什么？
Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first. Just what are you gonna tell her?

910
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:24,059
- 我还没有太明确的打算　- 好的，你最好想清楚一些
- I haven't figured it out exactly. - Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.

911
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:27,271
假设她问你昨天晚上为什么不回家，你会怎么回答？
Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night.

912
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:29,356
我会说陪一个朋友
I'll say I spent the night with a friend.

913
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:31,525
- 谁？　- 公司的同事
- Who? - Someone from the office.

914
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,443
- 你现在在哪里？　- 在他的公寓
- Where are you now? - In his apartment.

915
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,946
- 他的公寓　- 在她的公寓
- In his apartment? - In her apartment.

916
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:38,282
- 你朋友叫什么名字？　- 巴克斯特
- What's your friend's name? - Baxter.

917
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:41,535
- 她姓什么？　- 不记得了
- What's her first name? - Miss.

918
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:44,454
- 你什么时候回家　- 直到我能走路为止
- When are you comin' home? - As soon as I can walk.

919
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:46,623
- 你的腿受伤了吗？　- 不是，是我的胃不舒服
- Your legs hurt? - No, my stomach.

920
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:49,584
- 你的胃？　- 他们一定会盘问到底的
- Your stomach? - They had to pump it out!

921
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:54,631
你现在不能给任何人打电话，直到你完全清醒为止
You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you get the chewing gum out of your head.

922
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,926
他们会担心我的，可能会报警的
They'll be worried about me. They might call the police.

923
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,263
我们必须要非常小心，我们不想牵连任何人
We have to be careful. We don't wanna involve anybody.

924
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:04,516
毕竟，舍尔爵克先生已经结婚了
After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.

925
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,436
谢谢提醒我
Thanks for reminding me!

926
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,150
我不是这个意思
I didn't mean it that way.

927
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:17,446
我刚才和他通过电话，他非常关心你
I was just talking to him on the phone. He's very concerned about you.

928
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:20,324
他没有骂我吗？
He doesn't give a damn about me.

929
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:24,161
你错了，他告诉我一一他这个大骗子
- You're wrong. He told me... - He's a liar.

930
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:26,580
这根本不算是最坏的情形
But that's not the worst part.

931
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:29,166
最糟糕的是我还爱他
The worst part is I still love him.

932
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,127
哦，肯定是爵福斯夫人过来了

933
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,330
Oh. That must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.

934
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:39,009
记得昨天晚上来的医生吗？她是他的妻子
Remember the doctor from last night? That's his wife.

935
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,763
我们的受害人在哪里呢？
So where's the victim?

936
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:45,849
拿看刀
Max the Knife!

937
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:52,648
- 呃，小姐，今天感觉如何？　- 我不知道，只是有一些晕
- Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today? - I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

938
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:58,153
治头晕最好的办法就是鸡汤肉丝面，再来一杯茶
The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup with chicken white meat and a glass tea.

939
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,699
- 不用，谢谢，我真的不饿　- 快吃点，对你身体很好的
- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry. - Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.

940
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:05,786
你不会把这东西当餐巾吧？
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?

941
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:09,122
- 我有一些纸巾　- 不像话，真是垮掉的一代
- I have some paper towels. - Beatnik.

942
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,709
在我的厨房，第三格，餐巾就放在银餐具下面
In my kitchen, third drawer, under the good silver, are napkins.

943
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,211
好的，爵福斯太太
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

944
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:17,005
那你还等什么呢？看戏呢？
So, what are you waiting for? A singing commercial?

945
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,174
- 我吃不下　- 你必须吃一点
- I can't eat. - You must eat.

946
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:22,427
你必须好起来，忘记这个薄情寡义的家伙
And you must get healthy and you must forget him.

947
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:25,889
当他第一次搬进来的时候，我觉得他还是一个好小伙子
Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here.

948
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,017
整洁干练，一个前途无量的大学生
Clean and cut, a regular lvy Leaguer.

949
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:33,563
结果他却是一个喜欢喝酒、跳恰恰舞的毫无品位
Turns out he's King Farouk, with the drinking, with the cha-cha.

950
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,732
还没有餐巾
With the no napkins.

951
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:39,903
象你这样的一个女孩，你愿意让你的后半生充满悲伤吗？
A girl like you, for the rest of your life you wanna cry in your noodle soup?

952
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:42,656
谁会需要呢？你现在听我说
Who needs it? Now you listen to me.

953
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:46,910
你肯定会找到一个非常好的很有潜力的男人，或者一个钻石王老五
You'll find yourself a nice, substantial man... a widower, maybe...

954
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:50,747
成立一个幸福美满的家庭，而不是吃安眠药
...and settle down, instead of noshing all those sleeping pills.

955
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:54,042
为什么？为谁呢？为一些喜欢社交与享乐的人？
For what? For whom? For some good-time Charlie?

956
01:26:56,539 --> 01:26:59,086
餐巾拿到了，我们喝些香槟如何
One napkin comin' up. Wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.

957
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:03,552
- 我告诉你什么了？　- 爵福斯太太，你不需要在这里等
- What did I tell you? - Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.

958
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:07,597
我要回去洗碗去了，你现在休息一下，这些东西等我回来拿
- I'll wash the dishes. - You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.

959
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:10,350
如果他欺负你，就叫我一声
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

960
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:15,439
- 她好像不太喜欢你啊　- 哦，没关系，我不在乎
- She doesn't seem to like you very much. - Oh, I don't mind.

961
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:18,108
实际上，我反而觉得受宠若惊
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.

962
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:23,488
他们都认为象你这样的女孩会为了象我这样的人做这样的傻事
That anybody'd think a girl like you would do a thing like this over a guy like me.

963
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,743
你看到这里的东西没有？一个信封？
Did you find something here? An envelope?

964
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:29,453
是的，在我这里
Yes. I've got it.

965
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:33,957
你觉得我们是不是最好把它销毁，这样就不会给别人抓到把柄
Don't you think we'd better destroy it so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

966
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:36,209
打开
Open it.

967
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,382
这里什么也没有，就只有100美元
There's nothing here but a $100 bill.

968
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:45,969
是的，你是不是想让舍尔爵克拿到这东西
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?

969
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,139
当然
Sure.

970
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,726
把这拿开，好吗？
Take this away, will you?

971
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:56,188
想不想看电视？要不我把它移过来
Would you like me to move the television set in here?

972
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:59,107
- 你会玩拉米纸牌吗？　- 不太会
- You play gin rummy? - I'm not very good at it.

973
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:03,236
- 我会，我们来玩牌吧！　- 你不用陪我玩的
- I am. Let me get the cards. - You don't have to entertain me.

974
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:07,115
你知道的，这里没有什么可以让我们两个人一起玩的东西
There's nothing I'd like better. You know. Togetherness.

975
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:11,953
猜猜上一个圣诞节我干什么，吃自助晚餐，逛逛动物园
Guess what I did last Christmas. Had dinner at the automat, went to the zoo...

976
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,831
然后回家，在艾其伯格走了以后打扫卫生
...then came home and cleaned up after Mr. Eichelberger.

977
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,334
他在这里开了一个蛋酒晚会
He had a little eggnog party here.

978
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,795
所以今年我就一个人清清静静的过
So I'm way ahead this year.

979
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,672
3叉，两个黑桃？
Three across. Spades double?

980
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:24,883
好牌
High deals.

981
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,636
6？8.
Six? Eight.

982
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:38,522
我想你要彻底放弃了.
I think I'm gonna give it all up.

983
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,525
放弃什么？
Give what up?

984
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:47,531
为什么人们必须相爱呢？
Why do people have to love people, anyway?

985
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:51,034
我知道你的意思。
I know what you mean.

986
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:56,331
皇后(Q)
Queen.

987
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,545
- 我也不想这样　- 快拿一张牌
- I don't want it. - Pick a card.

988
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:10,679
你认为一个人在出车祸的时候，还是糊里糊涂应该算什么？
What do you call it when somebody keeps gettin' smashed up in car accidents?

989
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:14,182
- 恶意索赔的危险？　- 那是我和男人
- Bad insurance risk? - That's me with men.

990
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:20,564
人家都说我是白虎星。我的初吻是在一个墓地里发生的.
I was jinxed from the word go. First time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

991
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,816
墓地里？
A cemetery?

992
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:25,694
那时我15岁，喜欢到那里躲着抽烟
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

993
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:30,031
他叫乔治，后来为了一个鼓队长把我甩了
His name was George and he threw me over for a drum majorette.

994
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,535
Uh，gin.
Uh, gin.

995
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:42,168
10，20…36，再加上25就是61还有两盒
That's 10, 20... 36. And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.

996
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:44,379
我总是容易陷入情网
I have this talent for falling in love...

997
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:48,049
但总是在错误的时间、错误的地点爱上不该爱的人
...with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.

998
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:50,927
哦，那你总共爱上了几个人？
Well, how many guys were there?

999
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:53,930
三个
Three.

1000
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:58,018
最近的一个是公司的财务经理，后来被遣送回匹茨伯格的老家
The last one was the manager of a finance company back home in Pittsburgh.

1001
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:00,186
他们发现他的账目有巨大的差异
They found a shortage in his accounts.

1002
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:04,107
他让我等他，他是1965年走的
He asked me to wait for him. He'll be out in 1965.

1003
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,736
切牌
Cut.

1004
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:13,408
于是我返回纽约并和我的姐姐，姐夫住在一起，他是出租车司机.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband, a cab driver.

1005
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:18,413
他们送我读了一个秘书学校，然后我在联合生活保险申请了一份工作
They sent me to secretarial school and then I applied for a job at Consolidated.

1006
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,749
但是我的打字考试不及格
But I flunked the typing test.

1007
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:23,627
- 太慢了？　- 不是，我打得飞快
- Too slow? - No. I can type up a storm.

1008
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,921
我不会写字
I just can't spell.

1009
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:31,968
于是他们给我一双白手套，把我安置在电梯里
So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator.

1010
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:34,638
于是我碰到了杰夫
And that's how I met Jeff.

1011
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:38,433
天啊，于是我被他缠上了
Oh God, I'm so fouled up.

1012
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,061
现在我能做什么呢？
What am I gonna do now?

1013
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,482
我又赢了你一手牌，你进展太快了
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1014
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:49,903
当你告诉他的时候，他是不是非常的难过？
Was he very upset when you told him?

1015
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,155
舍尔爵克先生？是的，非常的心烦意乱
Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah, very.

1016
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:57,077
也许他确实爱我，只是没有告诉他夫人的勇气
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.

1017
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,662
我想也是的
I'm sure that's it.

1018
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:02,207
- 你真的这么想？　- 毫无疑问
- You really think so? - No doubt about it.

1019
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,835
你能递给我那本便笺和铅笔吗？
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1020
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:09,005
- 干什么用？　- 我想给舍尔爵克太太写信
- What for? - I'm gonna write to Mrs. Sheldrake.

1021
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,508
- 写什么内容？　- 一个女人给另外一个女人写信
- You what? - As one woman to another.

1022
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:15,595
- 我想她应该能理解我　- 我不认为这是一个非常好的主意
- I'm sure she'll understand. - I don't think that's a very good idea.

1023
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:19,140
- 为什么呢？　- 首先，你不会写字
- Why not? - For one thing, you can't spell.

1024
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:23,478
其次，如果你做了这样的事情，你会恨你自己的
Secondly, if you did something like that, you'd hate yourself.

1025
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:27,315
我确实对我自己不满意
I don't like myself very much anyway.

1026
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,611
把牌收起来，我们走！
Pick up the cards. Let's go.

1027
01:31:31,778 --> 01:31:34,864
- 我也要去吗？　- 你说对了，我手上的牌太好了
- Do I have to? - You bet. I got a terrific hand.

1028
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:44,457
- 你要把牌全扔了吗？　- 当然
- You really wanna discard that? - Sure.

1029
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,501
Gin.
Gin.

1030
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,630
10，20，40，52再加上25就等于77

1031
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:55,800
10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.

1032
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,015
方片翻倍就是154
Spades are double... 154.

1033
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,230
哈哈，我赢了两盘了了
Blitzed. Two games.

1034
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,752
好的，好的，爵福斯太太

1035
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:40,650
All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

1036
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:50,291
- 嘿，巴克斯特　- 你要干什么？
- Hi, Baxter. - What do you want?

1037
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,460
没事，你们等一会
What do I want? Just a minute.

1038
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,255
- 你们不能进来　- 你怎么了？
- You can't come in! - What's the matter with you?

1039
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:57,465
我预订了四点钟的房间啊
I made a reservation for four o'clock.

1040
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,884
今天你不能呆在这里，拿着你的香槟快离开这里
You can't stay. Take your champagne and go.

1041
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:03,555
我不想拿我的职位来压你，但是我已经告诉那位女士一切都搞定了
I don't wanna pull rank on you, but I told the little lady it was all set.

1042
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:07,517
科克比先生，你是自己离开，还是让我把你扔出去
Are you gonna leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?

1043
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:11,145
哥们儿，不要这样说话嘛！
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?

1044
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:14,482
- 你是不是也找了一个女伴？　- 现在你还不准备出去吗？
- Got yourself a little playmate, huh? - Now will you get out?

1045
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:16,693
嘿，快点，我们还等什么呢？开门，好不好？

1046
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:23,490
Hey, come on! What are we waiting for? Open up, will you?

1047
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:25,702
米尔德里德！
Mildred!

1048
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:31,708
- 为什么要这样处理呢？　- 听着，我们四个人一起开一个聚会，好吗？
- What's holding things up? - Say, let's have a party, the four of us.

1049
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:33,960
不行
No!

1050
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,383
好了，我也不想责怪你
Well, I don't blame you.

1051
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,553
小伙子，这回你中头奖了？我是说和你和库伯利克
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid? I mean Kubelikwise.

1052
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,222
不要担心，我不会向其他人说的
Don't worry. I won't say a word to anybody.

1053
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:48,641
待在这里，小伙子
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

1054
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:05,742
开始是谁在敲门？
Who was that?

1055
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:09,996
哦，有人来送香槟！
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?

1056
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:13,541
你介意打开窗户吗？
Would you mind opening that window?

1057
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:21,591
- 库伯利科小姐，不要有什么傻念头　- 我不过想透透气而已
- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik. - I just want some fresh air.

1058
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:25,094
这里只有一层楼高，你充其量只会摔断一条腿
It's only one storey down. The best you could do is break a leg.

1059
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:28,014
他们会痛扁我一顿的
So they'll shoot me, like a horse.

1060
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:31,601
你要答应我你不会做任何的傻事
Please, you gotta promise me you won't do anything foolish.

1061
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:34,270
- 谁会在乎我呢　- 我会
- Who'd care? - I would.

1062
01:35:40,026 --> 01:35:43,947
为什么我没有爱上你这样的好人呢？
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?

1063
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:46,950
好的
Yeah. Well...

1064
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:50,578
这是崩溃的好办法，就像捏碎小甜饼一样
That's the way it crumbles, cookiewise.

1065
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:54,415
睡一会儿吧
Go to sleep.

1066
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:33,329
- 早上好，舍尔爵克先生　- 奥尔森小姐，请到我的办公室来一下
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake. - Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.

1067
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:46,634
- 圣诞节过的怎么样？　- 托您的福，很不错
- Did you have a nice Christmas? - Lovely. You were a great help!

1068
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,429
你在公司晚会和库伯利克小姐说了什么？
Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.

1069
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:54,183
- 不好意思，杰夫，我想我可能喝多了　- 我想你应该管好你的嘴
- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor. - I thought you could hold your tongue.

1070
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,853
- 我保证再也不会这样了　- 你确实再也不会了
- It won't happen again. - You bet it won't.

1071
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,939
我会安排给你发一个月工资
I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay.

1072
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:03,151
好的，奥尔森小姐，我现在放你长假了
That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.

1073
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,362
杰夫，你四年前就已经抛弃我一次了
You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

1074
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:10,950
还那么残忍让我坐在外面，看着你一个又一个的新情人来来去去
And were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.

1075
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:14,203
我希望你能够马上从我面前消失
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.

1076
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,497
好的，舍尔爵克先生
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1077
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:29,385
总机，我是舍尔爵克先生，请帮我查一下巴克斯特先生家里的电话
Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like Mr. Baxter's home telephone number.

1078
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:32,513
他在普通保险清算部
He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

1079
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:52,408
喂？喂，杰夫·舍尔爵克，你现在方便讲话吗？
- Hello? - Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?

1080
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:54,911
可以，她现在正在洗澡
Yes. She's in the shower.

1081
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:57,747
- 现在她一切都还好　- 好的
- She's coming along fine, considering. - Good.

1082
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:01,501
- 你需要什么？钱吗？　- 不用，谢谢，舍尔爵克先生
- Is there anything you need? Money? - No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.

1083
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:04,796
事实上，我这里还有你的100美元
As a matter of fact, I have some money for you. $100.

1084
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:06,339
噢！
Oh.

1085
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:10,301
- 这里还有什么需要我帮你的吗？　- 为我？我想不用了
- If there's anything I can do for you... - For me? I don't think so.

1086
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:13,262
但是我真的希望你能为她做一些事情
But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her.

1087
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:16,849
比如说呢？巴克斯特，你设身处地的为我想想
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter.

1088
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:19,268
我现在怎么能帮她呢？我现在很忙
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

1089
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,022
这样啊，至少你应该和她通通电话
Well... at least you can talk to her.

1090
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:27,735
你等我让她穿好衣服，请你对她温柔点
Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.

1091
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:30,863
电话打给你的
There's a call for you!

1092
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:33,533
- 给我？　- 是，舍尔爵克先生。
- For me? - Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.

1093
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,453
我不想和他说话
I don't wanna talk to him.

1094
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,539
我想你应该和他说说
I think you should.

1095
01:38:39,705 --> 01:38:45,086
我要去下面的杂货店一趟，除了冰冻匹萨我这里什么都没有了
I gotta run down to the grocery anyway. There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.

1096
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,964
我很快就回来，好吗？
I'll be right back. OK?

1097
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:10,486
喂，杰夫
Hello, Jeff.

1098
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:15,032
- 我一切都好　- 弗兰，为什么做这种傻事呢？
- Yes, I'm all right. - Why did you do it, Fran?

1099
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,660
你太孩子气了，这解决不了任何问题的
It's so childish, and it never solves anything.

1100
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:20,496
你这个样子吓死我了，我都要气死了
I oughta be very angry with you, scaring me that way.

1101
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:25,376
让我们忘记这一切，就当没发生过你觉得怎么样？
But let's forget the whole thing, pretend it never happened. What do you say?

1102
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:27,670
弗兰？
Fran?

1103
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:30,673
弗兰，你还在吗？
Are you there, Fran?

1104
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:36,554
我当然不在这里，整件事情也没有发生
Of course I'm not here, because the whole thing never happened.

1105
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:40,558
我从来没有吃过安眠药，从来没有爱过你
I never took those pills, I never loved you...

1106
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:43,019
我们从来也没有相遇
...we never even met.

1107
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:48,191
- 杰夫，这样你是不是满意了？　- 你知道我不是这个意思的
- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff? - You know I didn't mean it that way.

1108
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:51,110
你好好养身体吧，按照看护的话去做，我是指巴克斯特
You just get well. Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.

1109
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:54,405
我会尽快去看你的，再见，弗兰
I'll see you as soon as I can. Goodbye, Fran.

1110
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:15,259
喂，是舍尔爵克夫人吗？我是奥尔森小姐
Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.

1111
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:19,639
我很好，谢谢，我想我们是不是可以共进午餐
Fine, thank you. I was wondering if we could have lunch together.

1112
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:24,143
我不知道这件事情有多严重，但是你会觉得对你有用的
I don't know how important it is, but you might find it educational.

1113
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:26,979
是关于你丈夫的事情
It concerns your husband.

1114
01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:30,900
好的，1点钟在曼德森餐馆，品味厅59号见
All right. One o'clock, Longchamps, Madison and 59th.

1115
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:39,408
不要担心，我马上就走
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

1116
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:41,619
只是打一个私人电话
Just making a personal call.

1117
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:45,373
这是一毛钱
Here's a dime.

1118
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,752
快离开
Going down.

1119
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:04,642
哦，巴克斯特先生，你还在这里
Oh, Mr. Baxter! I'm glad you're here.

1120
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:07,436
- 我还正准备去拿备用钥匙呢？　- 干什么用？
- I was just going to get the passkey. - What for?

1121
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:10,356
好像你的公寓里有煤气味道传出来
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.

1122
01:41:10,523 --> 01:41:12,608
煤气？！
Gas?!

1123
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,786
库伯利克小姐！
Miss Kubelik?

1124
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:27,665
库伯利克小姐！
Miss Kubelik!

1125
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:32,461
- 你还好吗？　- 当然
- You all right? - Sure!

1126
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:36,465
- 那这煤气味是怎么回事？　- 煤气！你没有打开吗？
- What's that funny smell? - Gas! Didn't you turn it on?

1127
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:39,552
打开了，我想烧水洗掉我衣服上的咖啡渍
Yes, to boil water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.

1128
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:43,139
- 你把煤气打开了，但是没有点火　- 你想干什么？
- You turned it on but you didn't light it. - Are you supposed to?

1129
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:47,059
在这间房子干什么？嘿，你在干什么呢？
In this house you're supposed to. Hey, what are you doing with that?

1130
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:50,646
我在洗我的袜子，于是顺便把你的也洗了
I was washing my stockings, so I thought I'd wash your socks too.

1131
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:54,942
- 哦，谢谢！　- 我很好奇，我怎么只能找到3只袜子？
- Oh. Thank you. - Very curious. I could only find 3 1/2 pair.

1132
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:57,612
我这里有些乱糟糟的
Things are a little disorganized around here.

1133
01:41:57,778 --> 01:42:01,574
我还想问一下，为什么你的厨房有一只网球拍呢
I'd say. What's a tennis racket doing in the kitchen?

1134
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:06,662
网球拍？哦，我想起来了，那是我自己做意大利餐的工具
Tennis racket? Oh, I remember. I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.

1135
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:09,498
我用它来处理意大利面条
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1136
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:12,209
- 是这样啊　- 事实上，我是一个很好的厨师
- Why not? - In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.

1137
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:15,171
- 但是在整理家务上面非常糟糕　- 嗯，确实如此
- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper. - Yes, you are.

1138
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:19,675
当我整理沙发的时候，我发现了6个发夹，一支口红
When I was straightening up the couch, I found six hairpins, a lipstick...

1139
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:23,512
一对假眼睫毛，还有斯多克俱乐部的鸡尾酒调酒棒
...a pair of false eyelashes and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1140
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:26,932
这只是因为我对任何人都不拒绝的后果
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no.

1141
01:42:27,099 --> 01:42:31,187
我不是指对女孩，我的意思是对像舍尔爵克先生一样的人
- I don't mean to girls. I mean... - To someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

1142
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:34,440
- 我猜也是的　- 我知道
- I guess so. - I know so.

1143
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:38,611
- 他是一个情场猎手　- 什么？
- He's a taker. - What?

1144
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:41,364
一些人捕猎，一些人被猎
Some people take, some people get took.

1145
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:45,534
他们知道他们需要什么类型的，而且他们并不需要做什么
And they know they're gettin' took and there's nothin' they can do about it.

1146
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:47,787
我也不知道该说什么
I wouldn't say that.

1147
01:42:48,537 --> 01:42:50,539
你中午想吃什么？
What would you like for dinner, huh?

1148
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:53,876
嗯，洋葱汤，罐装的芦笋
Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...

1149
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:56,003
我现在真的要回去了
I really should be getting home.

1150
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:59,131
- 我家里人现在肯定都急疯了　- 你现在还不能离开
- My family'll be flipping by now. - You can't leave yet.

1151
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:03,719
医生说过需要48个小时，才能把那些东西清除掉
The doctor said it takes 48 hours to get that stuff out of your system.

1152
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:09,016
那多久才能把那些缠着你的人甩开呢？
How long does it take to get someone you're stuck on out of your system?

1153
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:12,103
除非他们发明一种专门的抽取泵
If only they'd invent some kind of pump for that.

1154
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:17,900
库伯利克小姐，我知道你的感受，你认为现在是世界末日，但根本不是你所想的那样
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world. But it's not.

1155
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:20,569
我也经历过一样糟糕的事情
I went through exactly the same thing myself.

1156
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:22,655
- 你也经历过？　- 是的，当然也不完全一样
- You did? - Well, not exactly the same.

1157
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:24,573
我想用枪来了结我的一生
I tried to do it with a gun.

1158
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:27,785
- 为了一个女孩？　- 更糟糕，是为了我最好朋友的老婆
- Over a girl? - Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.

1159
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:32,957
但是我却疯狂的爱上了她，我知道这是没有结果的，于是想结束这一切
And I was mad about her. But I knew it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.

1160
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:37,253
我到了一家当铺并买了一把点45自动步枪，然后开车到伊甸公园
I went to a pawnshop and I bought a.45 automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...

1161
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:39,463
- 你知道辛辛那提吗？　- 不知道
- Do you know Cincinnati? - No, I don't.

1162
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:42,258
总之，我停好车，把子弹上膛
Anyway, I parked the car and I loaded that gun...

1163
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:46,762
你读过报纸上说的那些饮弹自尽的文章吧！相信我，事情根本没有那么的简单
You read in the papers that people shoot themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.

1164
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:50,599
我知道，那你是怎么做的？这里？这里？还是这里？
I mean, how do you do it? Here? Here? Here?

1165
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:54,603
- 知道我最后开枪打哪个地方吗？　- 哪里？
- Know where I finally shot myself? - Where?

1166
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,605
- 这里　- 在膝盖上
- Here. - In the knee?!

1167
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,275
是的，我坐在那里，然后在想如何了结
Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.

1168
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:01,777
因为我违章停车，一个警察走过来
A cop came up because I was illegally parked.

1169
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:05,281
我想把枪藏在椅子后面，结果枪走火了
I tried to hide the gun under the seat and it went off.

1170
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:09,076
- 太恐怖了　- 整整一年我都不能弯曲我的膝盖
- That's terrible! - It was a year till I could bend the knee.

1171
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:12,413
但是后来我三个星期就忘记了那个女孩
But I got over the girl in three weeks.

1172
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:17,668
她还在辛辛提那有四个小孩，都有20磅重了
Still lives in Cincinnati. Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1173
01:44:17,835 --> 01:44:20,212
每个圣诞节还给我送水果蛋糕、
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1174
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:22,798
你是不是编出这样的故事让我高兴啊
Are you just making this up to make me feel better?

1175
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:24,967
当然不是，你看这还有水果蛋糕呢
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1176
01:44:25,134 --> 01:44:27,303
- 你想看我的膝盖吗？　- 不用了，谢谢！
- Do you wanna see my knee? - No, thank you.

1177
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:30,723
公司的那些家伙可能会奇怪我是怎么知道的
The fellas in the office might get the wrong idea how I found out.

1178
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:34,977
好了，我来做中餐，水果蛋糕作为饭后的甜点，如何？
Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.

1179
01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:38,355
你就坐这里休息就够了，今天你的运动已经够多了
You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for today.

1180
01:44:38,522 --> 01:44:41,817
好的，看护大人
- Yes, Nurse. - [Baxter hums opera music]

1181
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:59,168
- 我能为你做点什么？　- 我找库伯利克小姐
- Can I help you? - I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.

1182
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:04,507
- 我也是，她今天早上没有报到上班　- 她没有吗？谁是这里的主管？
- So am I. She didn't report this morning. - She didn't? Who's in charge here?

1183
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:08,969
她属于总部下面的行政部，多比奇先生，21楼
That comes under General Office Administration. Mr. Dobisch, 21 st floor.

1184
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:10,930
谢谢
Thanks.

1185
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:17,853
我今天带塞维利亚去他的公寓，估计她应该在巴克斯特的房间里.
So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.

1186
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,271
- 谁？　- 库伯利克
- Who? - Kubelik.

1187
01:45:19,438 --> 01:45:22,525
别开玩笑了，巴德小伙子会和库伯利克有一腿
No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik having a little toot?

1188
01:45:22,691 --> 01:45:27,196
也许吧！一个不好的周末，他们今天好像都没有上班
Toot? More like a lost weekend. Neither of 'em showed up for work today.

1189
01:45:27,363 --> 01:45:28,948
擅离职守，对吗？
AWOL, hm?

1190
01:45:29,114 --> 01:45:31,659
尤其让我不爽的就是，他们还拿走了我的香槟
What gripes me is they guzzled my champagne...

1191
01:45:31,825 --> 01:45:35,412
而我和塞尔维亚在高格汉姆博物馆冻得要死
...while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.

1192
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:39,124
- 科比奇先生吗？　- 是的
- Mr. Dobisch? - Yeah.

1193
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:44,296
我叫卡尔·马塔斯奇卡，我的妹妹叫弗兰·库伯利克，在你们这里开电梯
I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.

1194
01:45:44,463 --> 01:45:45,923
- 库伯利克小姐？　- 你认识她吗？
- Miss Kubelik? - You know her?

1195
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:49,927
当然，我们有很多雇员，但我们是一个快乐的幸福大家庭
Of course. We have a lot of employees, but we're one big, happy family.

1196
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:52,471
她和我们住一起，我妻子克斯弗兰很担心
She lives with us, and my wife's nervous

1197
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:55,224
因为她已经两天没有回家了
cause Fran hasn't been home for two days.

1198
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:56,725
那样又如何？
That so?

1199
01:45:56,892 --> 01:45:59,895
于是我们在想你们这里是不是有人知道她的去处
So we wondered if somebody here knew what happened to her.

1200
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:01,480
我明白
I see.

1201
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:05,234
你有什么意见，埃尔？我们需要帮助这家伙吗？
What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?

1202
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:08,779
为什么不呢？我们又不欠巴德什么人情
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.

1203
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:12,491
对，何况巴德最近对我们怎么样，你也是很清楚的
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?

1204
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:17,037
谁是巴德？
Who is Buddy-boy?

1205
01:46:41,186 --> 01:46:45,024
- 我们需要穿好衣服来吃饭吗？　- 不用，你过来就行了
- Are we dressing for dinner? - No. Just come as you are.

1206
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:49,361
- 你很会用这球拍　- 你等一下可以看看我反手击球
- You're pretty good with that racket. - You should see my backhand.

1207
01:46:51,363 --> 01:46:54,325
等一下你就可以看到我怎么处理这些肉丸
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.

1208
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:58,537
- 我来点蜡烛　- 这将是非常的浪漫、有情调
- Shall I light the candles? - It's a must, gracious livingwise.

1209
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,167
肉丸
 Meatball

1210
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:08,589
肉丸
 Meatball

1211
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:20,643
- 你买了一些餐巾　- 最好能够保持一致
- You bought some napkins. - Might as well go all the way.

1212
01:47:24,063 --> 01:47:26,440
你知道的，我曾经像鲁宾逊漂流记中男主角那样生活
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe.

1213
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:28,817
在八百万人的幸存者中
Shipwrecked, among eight million people.

1214
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:32,154
有一天我在沙滩上看到了脚印
And then one day I saw a footprint in the sand...

1215
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:34,365
发现你也在这里
...and there you were.

1216
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,493
太让人兴奋了，两人晚餐
It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.

1217
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:41,497
- 你经常一个人吃饭吗？　- 不，有时候我和爱德·苏尔文一起吃
- Do you usually eat alone? - No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.

1218
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:44,416
有时候是戴娜·什莎或者是佩雷·克莫
Or sometimes Dinah Shore or Perry Como.

1219
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:48,545
另外一个晚上是和梅·韦斯特，她很年轻，干杯
The other night it was Mae West. She was much younger then. Cheers.

1220
01:47:48,712 --> 01:47:51,548
- 干杯　- 我们吃完饭有什么好计划？
- Cheers. - Know what we're gonna do after dinner?

1221
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:53,759
- 吃菜喽　- 我指那之后
- The dishes. - I mean after that.

1222
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:56,178
- 什么　- 如果你不喜欢的话不要勉强自己
- What? - You don't have to if you don't want to.

1223
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:58,722
- 哦，不会的　- 我们再继续打牌吧
- Oh, I don't? - We're gonna finish the gin game.

1224
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:01,600
保持清醒的头脑
So keep a clear head.

1225
01:48:02,393 --> 01:48:06,397
因为我不想利用你，我昨天在你睡着时候做的事情
Cause I don't wanna take advantage of you, the way I did yesterday in bed.

1226
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:08,732
- 巴克斯特在吗？　- 在
- Baxter? - Yes.

1227
01:48:17,866 --> 01:48:20,536
弗兰，你和谁在一起呢？你不记得你住在哪里了吗？
What's with you, Fran? Did you forget where you live?

1228
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:24,373
- 我姐夫，卡尔·马塔斯奇卡　- 你好，马塔斯奇卡先生
- My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka. - Oh! How do you do, Mr. Matusch...

1229
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:28,877
- 快穿好衣服，我车在楼下等你　- 等等，我知道你在想什么
- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs. - Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...

1230
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:31,797
你做什么不关我的事情，你已经超过21岁了
It's none of my business what you do. You're over 21.

1231
01:48:31,964 --> 01:48:35,551
- 但是你姐姐还认为你是一个小女孩　- 我们只是在这里吃饭
- But your sister thinks you're a lady. - All we were gonna do was eat!

1232
01:48:35,718 --> 01:48:38,178
如果不是这里有一位女士在场的话，我会痛扁你一顿的
If there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.

1233
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:41,265
好的，卡尔，我去穿衣服
All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.

1234
01:48:50,441 --> 01:48:52,568
来一杯马提尼如何？
Want a martini?

1235
01:48:56,488 --> 01:49:00,409
来一些我做的意大利肉酱面？
How about some spaghetti with meat sauce that I cooked myself?

1236
01:49:05,914 --> 01:49:08,751
你姐夫实在太恐怖了
Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.

1237
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:16,425
如果他在马路上开车，肯定会害死其他司机的
It must be murder drivin' a cab in New York with the cross-town traffic.

1238
01:49:20,929 --> 01:49:22,931
嗨，巴克斯特，病人现在情况怎么样？
Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?

1239
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:25,100
哦，我还好，医生
Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.

1240
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,311
不是你，是库伯利克小姐
Not you. Miss Kubelik.

1241
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:32,941
- 库伯利克小姐发生什么事情了？　- 他是马塔斯奇卡先生，一个出租车司机
- What's the matter with Miss Kubelik? - This is Mr. Matuschka. He's... got a cab.

1242
01:49:33,108 --> 01:49:35,527
- 弗兰生病了吗？　- 没有，出了一点小意外
- Fran been sick? - No. Just a little accident.

1243
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:39,615
- 他的话是什么意思，意外？　- 哦，是这样的，这些事情一直都在发生
- What does he mean, accident? - Well... these things happen all the time.

1244
01:49:39,782 --> 01:49:41,909
什么事情？你究竟当的什么医生？
What things? What kind of a doctor are you?

1245
01:49:42,076 --> 01:49:45,245
不是什么，他只是给她打了一针，然后洗了一下胃
Not that kind! He just gave her a shot, pumped out her stomach.

1246
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:48,624
- 为什么？　- 我吃了安眠药，不过我现在已经没事了
- What for? - I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.

1247
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:51,293
- 你为什么吃安眠药？　- 因为我
- Why'd you take sleeping pills? - On account of me.

1248
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:53,462
你？
You?

1249
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:55,464
能有其他人吗？
Who else?

1250
01:50:00,302 --> 01:50:02,387
放开他
Leave him alone!

1251
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:08,060
哦，你这个傻瓜，太傻了
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.

1252
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:13,315
- 快走，弗兰　- 巴克斯特先生，再见
- [Karl] Come on, Fran. - Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

1253
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:21,323
再见，医生
Goodbye, Doctor.

1254
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:27,996
好了，我不想幸灾乐祸，不过你刚才确实很有勇气承担责任
Well, I don't wanna gloat, but just between us, you had it coming to you.

1255
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:33,085
你明天就会有一个黑眼圈
You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.

1256
01:50:33,252 --> 01:50:35,170
让我拿一下包
Let me get my bag.

1257
01:50:37,214 --> 01:50:39,216
不用担心，医生
Don't bother, Doc.

1258
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:41,468
伤的不是很厉害
It doesn't hurt a bit.

1259
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,534
舍尔爵克先生的办公室吗？我是CC·巴克斯特
Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is C.C. Baxter.

1260
01:51:05,701 --> 01:51:08,912
请告诉他我想现在就见他，有很重要的事情
Please tell him I'd like to come up and see him. It's important.

1261
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:11,206
请问你能打回来吗？
Will you call me back, please?

1262
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,045
舍尔爵克先生，我有好消息要告诉你
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1263
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:20,257
所有的麻烦都结束了
All your troubles are over.

1264
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:24,303
我想我可以帮你摆脱库伯利克小姐
I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik off your hands.

1265
01:51:25,095 --> 01:51:27,598
事实就是我喜欢她
The plain fact is, I love her.

1266
01:51:28,473 --> 01:51:31,059
我想你是第一个知道的人
I thought you should be the first to know.

1267
01:51:31,226 --> 01:51:34,062
毕竟，你不喜欢她，而我却喜欢
After all, you don't really want her, and I do.

1268
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:38,317
虽然这听起来有些专横，但是她需要像我这样的人来照顾
And though it may sound presumptuous, she needs somebody like me.

1269
01:51:38,483 --> 01:51:41,904
于是我想我应该是最适合的人选
So I think it would be best all around.

1270
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:43,488
这样才能解决问题
Solutionwise.

1271
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:44,907
喂？
Yes?

1272
01:51:45,073 --> 01:51:47,200
我马上上来
I'll be right up.

1273
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:50,746
舍尔爵克先生，我有好消息要告诉你
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1274
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:52,956
所有的麻烦都结束了
All your troubles are over.

1275
01:51:57,252 --> 01:51:59,421
19楼
19.

1276
01:51:59,588 --> 01:52:03,258
- 嗨，巴德小伙子，你怎么了？　- 被门撞到了吗？
- Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you? - Hit by a swinging door?

1277
01:52:03,425 --> 01:52:06,303
- 或者是黄色的出租车撞到了　- 那个家伙可能已经揍了他
- Or a yellow cab? - That guy really must've belted him.

1278
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:09,598
是的，你看他已经心不在焉，自言自语
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

1279
01:52:09,765 --> 01:52:11,266
27楼
27.

1280
01:52:11,433 --> 01:52:13,852
这两天她住在我的公寓里
Those two days she spent in the apartment...

1281
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:16,980
才让我意识到我原来多么的孤独
...made me realize how lonely I'd been before.

1282
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:20,651
但是多亏了你，让我有足够的收入来娶她
But, thanks to you, I'm in a financial position to marry her.

1283
01:52:20,817 --> 01:52:23,820
如果我能和她的家人协商好的话
If I can ever square things with her family.

1284
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:26,448
早上好，CC·巴克斯特先生
Good morning. C.C. Baxter.

1285
01:52:30,369 --> 01:52:32,454
- 他已经到了　- 让他进来
- Mr. Baxter is here. - Send him in.

1286
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:37,542
舍尔爵克先生，我有好消息要告诉你
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1287
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:39,795
巴克斯特，我也有好消息告诉你
And I've got good news for you, Baxter.

1288
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:42,297
所有的问题都迎刃而解了。先生？
- All your troubles are over. - Sir?

1289
01:52:42,631 --> 01:52:45,801
我知道你很担心库伯利克小姐，现在你不用管了
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.

1290
01:52:45,968 --> 01:52:48,804
我将要把她从你那里接过来
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1291
01:52:48,971 --> 01:52:51,807
- 从我这里接过去　- 很对
- You're gonna take her off my hands? - That's right.

1292
01:52:51,974 --> 01:52:54,476
我已经从家里搬出来了
I've moved out of the house.

1293
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:58,355
目前打算住在镇上，住在运动俱乐部
I'm gonna be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.

1294
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:01,483
- 你和你妻子离婚了？　- 如果你非要知道的话，我告诉你，我炒掉我的秘书
- You left your wife. - If you must know, I fired my secretary.

1295
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:06,446
我秘书告诉了我的妻子，我妻子炒掉我，对我而言真是一个重大的不幸
My secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

1296
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,156
是的
Yeah.

1297
01:53:08,323 --> 01:53:10,242
巴克斯特，你有什么好消息可以告诉我的
Now what's your news, Baxter?

1298
01:53:12,369 --> 01:53:16,039
是关于库伯利克小姐的，她现在完全康复，然后回家去了
It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling all right again so she went home.

1299
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:19,334
很好，我没有忘记你为我做的事情
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.

1300
01:53:19,501 --> 01:53:21,545
这边来，巴克斯特
This way, Baxter.

1301
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:27,342
坐下，大小合适吗？
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1302
01:53:28,343 --> 01:53:30,846
- 喜欢吗？这里都是你的　- 我的？
- You like? It's all yours. - Mine?

1303
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:36,184
我的助理已经被轮调到丹佛的办公室，由你来接替他的位置
My assistant has been shifted to the Denver office and you're taking his place.

1304
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:38,770
怎么了，有什么事情吗？你看起来好像并不很兴奋
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited.

1305
01:53:38,937 --> 01:53:43,191
哦，只是很多事情变化太快了，让我都有些无所适从
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast.

1306
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:46,069
我很高兴，特别为库伯利克小姐高兴
I'm very pleased. Especially for Miss Kubelik.

1307
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:51,199
我觉得她就是那种合适嫁给一些人的女孩
I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to... someone.

1308
01:53:51,366 --> 01:53:56,872
当然，当然，首先我要处理好财产问题，然后再花六个星期的时间在雷诺休息。
Sure, sure. But first the property has to be settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1309
01:53:57,039 --> 01:53:59,875
同时我也要好好地享受一下单身汉的快乐
Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.

1310
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:03,462
对了，巴克斯特，你可以在经理餐厅吃饭了
Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch in the executive dining room.

1311
01:54:03,628 --> 01:54:06,256
这是担任这一工作的特权之一
That's one of the privileges that goes with this job.

1312
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:11,011
你还可以公费报销一些项目，使用经理盥洗室
You also get a nice little expense account, use of the executive washroom...

1313
01:54:11,178 --> 01:54:13,555
嘿，巴克斯特，你怎么了？
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1314
01:54:13,722 --> 01:54:16,475
- 我也备受打击　- 哦
- I got kicked in the head too. - Oh?

1315
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:39,623
晚安，巴克斯特先生
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

1316
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,249
哦
Oh.

1317
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:44,169
库伯利克小姐，你现在感觉如何？
Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?

1318
01:54:44,336 --> 01:54:47,005
- 我很好，你的眼睛怎么样了？　- 哦，没事
- I feel fine. How's your eye? - Oh, fine.

1319
01:54:47,172 --> 01:54:49,966
- 公寓现在怎么样　- 还是老样子，什么都没变
- How are things at the apartment? - Nothing's changed.

1320
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:53,136
- 我们那个牌局还没有打完呢　- 我知道
- We never did finish that gin game. - I know.

1321
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:57,140
我想你已经知道舍尔爵克的事情了吧
I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.

1322
01:54:57,307 --> 01:54:59,851
和他夫人离婚？对，我很为他高兴
Leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.

1323
01:55:00,018 --> 01:55:02,604
- 我从来没有想过他会做这件事情　- 我早就告诉过你了
- I never thought he'd do it. - I told you all along.

1324
01:55:02,771 --> 01:55:06,233
- 你对舍尔爵克先生有一些误会　- 我想是的吧
- You were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake. - I guess so.

1325
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,401
你对我也有一些误会
You were wrong about me too.

1326
01:55:08,568 --> 01:55:11,696
就是关于谁泡谁和谁被泡的问题
What you said about those who take and those who get took.

1327
01:55:11,863 --> 01:55:15,033
舍尔爵克先生没有利用我，我在玩他，明白吗？
Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me. I was using him. See?

1328
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:19,663
上个月我在19楼的861号桌子，现在我在27楼了
Last month I was at desk 861 on the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.

1329
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,832
套间的办公室，还有三扇窗尸
A paneled office, three windows.

1330
01:55:21,998 --> 01:55:25,001
因此一切都发展得很好，我们各得其所
So it all worked out fine. We're both getting what we wanted.

1331
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:28,046
是的，你能陪我到地铁吗？
Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?

1332
01:55:28,213 --> 01:55:33,969
不了，谢谢，我告诉你，我今天晚上有一个很重要的约会
No, thank you. Well, I... To tell you the truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.

1333
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:40,725
- 你不和舍尔爵克先生会面吗？　- 不，你知道人言可畏的
- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake? - No. You know how people talk.

1334
01:55:40,892 --> 01:55:46,148
我决定在所有事情都解决好之前不和他见面，也就是等他离婚之后
I decided it was best not to see each other until everything was settled, divorcewise.

1335
01:55:46,314 --> 01:55:48,400
明智之举
That's very wise.

1336
01:55:49,484 --> 01:55:51,987
- 晚安，巴克斯特先生　- 晚安
- Good night, Mr. Baxter. - Good night.

1337
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:31,359
- 巴克斯特，你能到我这里来一下吗？　- 好的，舍尔爵克先生
- Baxter, could you step in here a minute? - Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1338
01:56:31,526 --> 01:56:33,570
- 这是你要的东西　- 非常感谢
- There you are. - Much obliged.

1339
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:41,203
这是员工离职率，为37%，女性员工结婚率为22%...
Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37% of females leave to get married and 22%...

1340
01:56:41,369 --> 01:56:44,289
巴克斯特，你工作太辛苦了，今天是除夕，放松点
Baxter, you work too hard. It's New Year's Eve. Relax!

1341
01:56:44,456 --> 01:56:47,417
- 是的，先生　- 我想你今天晚上应该庆祝一番吧
- Yes, sir. - I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.

1342
01:56:47,584 --> 01:56:49,753
- 那是自然　- 我准备约库伯利克小姐出来
- Naturally. - I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1343
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,922
- 我想和她促膝畅谈　- 我明白
- I finally talked her into it. - I see.

1344
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:56,426
唯一的问题是我还住在运动俱乐部，那里全是男的，不太方便
The only thing is, I'm staying at the Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...

1345
01:56:56,593 --> 01:56:58,762
如果你不介意的话？
If you don't mind?

1346
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:03,058
- 不介意什么　- 你知道的，你公寓的钥匙
- Don't mind what? - You know my key to your apartment?

1347
01:57:03,225 --> 01:57:06,394
就是我们被库伯利克小姐吓了一跳的地方
When we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik...

1348
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:10,565
- 我早就忘记了　- 非常聪明
...I threw it out the window of the train. - Very clever.

1349
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:13,068
所以现在我要借用你的钥匙
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1350
01:57:14,528 --> 01:57:17,322
- 不好意思，舍尔爵克先生　- 不好意思，为什么？
- Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. - What do you mean, sorry?

1351
01:57:17,489 --> 01:57:19,866
你不能带任何人再到我的公寓来
You're not bringing anybody to my apartment.

1352
01:57:20,033 --> 01:57:24,371
- 不是别人，是库伯利克小姐　- 她更不行
- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik. - Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1353
01:57:24,537 --> 01:57:27,791
- 我再问你一遍？　- 不行
- How's that again? - No key.

1354
01:57:29,626 --> 01:57:34,214
巴克斯特，我把你调到我身边是因为我觉得你是一个非常年轻聪明的孩子
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man.

1355
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:37,801
你知道你在干什么吗？这对我没什么，但是对你影响有多大？
Do you realize what you're doing? Not to me, but to yourself?

1356
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:41,304
一般来说你要花很多时间才能到27楼来工作
Normally it takes years to work your way up to the 27th floor.

1357
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:44,474
但是可能只要30秒钟你就可以被扫地出门
But it only takes 30 seconds to be out on the street again.

1358
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:47,269
- 你懂吗？　- 我懂
- You dig? - I dig.

1359
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:50,480
那你现在应该怎么办呢？
So what's it going to be?

1360
01:57:57,237 --> 01:58:00,365
- 这样才对　- 谢谢，先生
- Now you're being bright. - Thank you, sir.

1361
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:20,427
- 巴克斯特，你拿错钥匙给我了　- 没有
- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key. - No, I didn't.

1362
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:23,221
但这是经理盥洗室的钥匙
But this is the key to the executive washroom.

1363
01:58:23,388 --> 01:58:27,142
没错，我不再需要它了，因为我已经要离开这里
That's right. I won't be needing it because I'm all washed up around here.

1364
01:58:27,309 --> 01:58:30,687
- 你傻了吗？　- 你要听我的话
- What's gotten into you? - Just following doctor's orders.

1365
01:58:30,854 --> 01:58:35,066
我想做一个人，知道什么意思吗？一个堂堂正正的人
I've decided to become a mensch. Know what that means? A human being.

1366
01:58:35,233 --> 01:58:39,154
- 等等，巴克斯特　- 这种逢迎拍马的老伎俩没用了
- Now hold on, Baxter. - The old payola won't work any more.

1367
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:41,406
再见，舍尔爵克先生
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

1368
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:20,904
- 我们有一个晚会，没有冰了，你可以拿过来一些吗？　- 好的，医生
- We're having a party and ran out of ice. - Sure, Doc.

1369
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:23,156
在除夕之夜你怎么一个人呢
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?

1370
01:59:23,323 --> 01:59:25,241
哦，我要做一些事情
Well, I got things to do.

1371
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:29,579
- 这是什么，你在收拾行李？　- 是的，我准备离开这里
- What's this? You're packing? - Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1372
01:59:29,746 --> 01:59:31,581
你要到哪里发展呢？
Where are you moving to?

1373
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:34,751
我不知道，不过有一点可以确认，就是离开这里
I don't know. All I know is I gotta get outta this place.

1374
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:36,920
巴克斯特，看到你要走，我很难过
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1375
01:59:37,087 --> 01:59:41,800
我？哦，我的身体，不要担心，我还会捐给大学的，我在写申请
Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.

1376
01:59:41,966 --> 01:59:45,136
- 需要香槟吗？　- 我们不喝酒
- Could you use some champagne? - Booze we don't need.

1377
01:59:45,303 --> 01:59:47,097
嘿，为什么不和我们一起玩呢
Say, why don't you join us?

1378
01:59:47,263 --> 01:59:52,227
我们有两个脑外科医生，一个直肠病学家，三个从贝利弗来的护士
We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist and three nurses from Bellevue.

1379
01:59:52,394 --> 01:59:54,312
不用，谢谢，我现在没心情
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1380
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:58,692
万一以后我们碰不到面了，我怎么偿还你帮我照顾那个女孩的人情
In case I don't see you again, how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?

1381
01:59:58,858 --> 02:00:02,695
不要想了，我没当自己是医生，我只是在尽一个邻居的义务
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor. I did it as a neighbor.

1382
02:00:02,862 --> 02:00:05,573
顺便问一句，她现在怎么样了？
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1383
02:00:06,825 --> 02:00:09,786
你知道我和女孩如何谈得了！来也匆匆，去也匆匆
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go.

1384
02:00:09,953 --> 02:00:12,664
- 再见，医生　- 新年快乐
- Goodbye, Doc. - Happy New Year.

1385
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:58,460
不好意思，我打了太久的电话，一切都准备好了
Sorry I took so long on the phone. We're all set.

1386
02:00:58,626 --> 02:01:01,045
- 干什么？　- 我租了一辆车，我们一点的时候用
- For what? - I rented a car. It'll be here at one.

1387
02:01:01,212 --> 02:01:04,048
- 我们开车到亚特兰大　- 亚特兰大？
- We're driving to Atlantic City. - Atlantic City?

1388
02:01:04,215 --> 02:01:08,803
我知道太远了，可是在除夕之夜纽约的酒店根本没有空房间
I know it's a drag, but you can't find a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.

1389
02:01:09,804 --> 02:01:12,640
辞旧迎新
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.

1390
02:01:12,807 --> 02:01:15,059
我们来狂欢吧！
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1391
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:18,855
我也不想这样的，这都是巴克斯特的错
I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.

1392
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:19,981
巴克斯特？
Baxter?

1393
02:01:20,148 --> 02:01:23,651
他不愿意给我公寓的钥匙
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.

1394
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:26,362
- 他不愿意？　- 是的，他离开我，辞职了
- He wouldn't? - No. He just walked out on me. Quit.

1395
02:01:26,529 --> 02:01:29,616
抛弃了在我身边的这么好的工作
Threw that big, fat job right in my face.

1396
02:01:30,992 --> 02:01:35,038
神经病，废物一个，毕竟他的一切都是我给的
- The nerve. - The little punk. After all I did for him.

1397
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:39,501
还说我再也不能带任何人到他的公寓，特别是库伯利克小姐不行
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.

1398
02:01:39,667 --> 02:01:42,462
那么他为什么要和你作对呢？
What's he got against you, anyway?

1399
02:01:42,629 --> 02:01:48,551
我不知道，也许这是最好的解决办法，就像粉碎的小甜饼一样
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles, cookiewise.

1400
02:01:50,553 --> 02:01:53,014
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1401
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:57,477
我想为你把它拼出来，可是我不会
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1402
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:07,487
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1403
02:02:07,654 --> 02:02:12,617
# And never brought to mind…
And never brought to mind...

1404
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:15,995
新年快乐，弗兰
Happy New Year, Fran.

1405
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:22,460
# And days of auld lang syne
And days of auld lang syne

1406
02:02:23,294 --> 02:02:28,424
# For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne, my dear

1407
02:02:28,591 --> 02:02:33,555
# For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne

1408
02:02:33,721 --> 02:02:38,935
# We'll drink a cup of kindness yet
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

1409
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:44,732
# For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne

1410
02:02:56,452 --> 02:02:58,538
弗兰？
Fran?

1411
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:01,874
你跑哪里去了，弗兰？
Where are you, Fran?

1412
02:03:19,976 --> 02:03:22,061
巴克斯特先生
Mr. Baxter!

1413
02:03:22,312 --> 02:03:23,521
巴克斯特先生

1414
02:03:23,855 --> 02:03:26,899
巴克斯特先生！巴克斯特先生
Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

1415
02:03:29,861 --> 02:03:31,154
天啊！
Oh!

1416
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:34,407
- 你还好吗？　- 我很好
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

1417
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:37,076
你确认吗？你膝盖怎么样？
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1418
02:03:37,785 --> 02:03:39,871
浑身上下都没有问题
I'm fine all over.

1419
02:03:41,873 --> 02:03:45,335
- 介意我进来吗？　- 当然不
- Mind if I come in? - Of course not.

1420
02:03:49,047 --> 02:03:51,132
我给你拿一只杯子
Let me get another glass.

1421
02:03:54,052 --> 02:03:56,137
- 你准备去哪里？　- 天知道
- Where are you going? - Who knows?

1422
02:03:56,304 --> 02:03:59,599
找另外一个邻居，到另外一个城市，再找另外一份工作
Another neighborhood, another town, another job.
