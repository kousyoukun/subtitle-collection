1
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,661
It's 27 degrees right now... 7:17...

2
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,732
The sport scene is coming up at 25
after the hour...

3
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:39,306
And Jack Walters will be having that
exclusive interview with Billy Martin

4
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:42,171
And you know that's going to
be fireworks...

5
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:44,175
The best bet for you folks coming
in from Jersey...

6
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,178
Do whatever you gotta do... use the uh...

7
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,782
Looking forward to some blue skies
all day today...

8
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,515
Them sun's going to be shining
in the 70's

9
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,785
Oh... oh... oh... Yes... Yes...

10
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,395
Especially in the city it should get up
to the 60's...

11
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:03,597
Enjoy it while you can
because that ole' man winter

12
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,927
is going to be blowing any day.

13
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,504
The lows tonight in the upper 30's

14
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:11,299
with frost in some of
the colder regions upstate.

15
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,106
You're listening to
Willie Craig on PRM-FM-93

16
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:18,212
and if you're clock radio
is set to go off at 7:18,

17
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:21,349
is should be doing that right about now

18
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,614
Start every day with music here on PRM.

19
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:28,416
This is a cut from
the new Pandemonium album, Lady Stevie

20
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:36,996
Peter, you're supposed to be ready
in half an hour.

21
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,494
Ready for what?

22
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:40,532
We're going to the Museum today & then

23
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:41,362
you and Mike and I are going to lunch
with Grandma.

24
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:42,128
Oh, Mom, I can't go.

25
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:43,896
I need the rest of the vacation just
to finish this thing.

26
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,609
We made these plans a week ago,
remember?

27
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:49,676
I know, I know but I'm way behind
my schedule, I'm sorry.

28
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,844
Peter, have you been up all night again

29
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:56,810
Mom, the City Science championships
are next week.

30
00:05:57,821 --> 00:06:02,224
Turn that thing off.
Put that down and look at me.

31
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,566
We made a little deal, didn't we?

32
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:15,627
You know I'm very proud and excited
about your project

33
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:18,136
but I don't want you working all night
on it.

34
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,707
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

35
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:23,674
Mom, this is the most incredible thing
that I've ever built.

36
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:25,176
I mean it carries.

37
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:28,009
It carries. Carries what?

38
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,149
Binary numbers.

39
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,718
I mean it could hold up to
a 20 digit figure.

40
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:35,914
Now wait a second, you said it can carry
and it holds too?

41
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,956
Both. It does both.
That's the whole point.

42
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:40,925
I mean there isn't a circuit like this
in any of my books.

43
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:42,756
I've invented it.

44
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:49,032
Well, that's great. That's great Peter.
What're you gonna call it?

45
00:06:50,273 --> 00:06:51,638
I don't know.

46
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,969
Well come on... Everybody knows that uh

47
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:59,649
when you invent or discover something
you get to name it like uh...

48
00:06:59,883 --> 00:07:01,475
a Napoleon.

49
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:02,609
A what?

50
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:05,752
You know the French pastry.
It was named after Napoleon.

51
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:08,617
Napoleon invented pastry?
I thought he was a general.

52
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:10,884
Well, you can't fight battles
all the time.

53
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:14,359
He baked as a kind of relaxation.

54
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,158
Are you okay, Mom?

55
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:22,030
Listen, no more all nighters, okay?

56
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:24,465
Okay.

57
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:33,878
What is this called, anyway?
Why its a Peter, of course.

58
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:36,510
That is, if I ever get if finished.

59
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:38,744
Okay, okay,
I'll let you skip it this time

60
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:42,083
but only if you promise not to
work all night.

61
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:46,495
Okay, I promise.

62
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:51,425
I promise. All right?

63
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:56,328
Grandma's going to be very disappointed
but it's all right.

64
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:59,235
I'll explain... that you're working on
your Peter.

65
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,888
There's someone at the front door...
yes...

66
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:50,722
Between 11 and 12 Thursday right...
yes fine, goodbye.

67
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:55,660
Kate, good to see you.

68
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,461
Mary's on vacation so I have to be
my own Receptionist.

69
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:01,495
How am I doing?

70
00:09:01,738 --> 00:09:03,638
I hops you're not going to keep me
waiting today.

71
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,669
I have to get to the Museum early today

72
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:08,434
I have to be at lunch at 12:30 with
Mike and his mother.

73
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:12,307
No waiting, go right in.
The doctor will be with you shortly.

74
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:23,855
So, what's happening?

75
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:30,065
My mother's driving me crazy as usual.

76
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,296
Did you talk to her?

77
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:37,598
Mmmmm... she's hinting around about
surprising me for my birthday.

78
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:41,502
Ah, she's going to come up from Florida
is she?

79
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,508
That's her surprise.

80
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:47,448
How do you feel about seeing her?

81
00:09:48,952 --> 00:09:53,184
Well, I feel... I should want to see her

82
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,355
It's been 6 months
since we've been down there

83
00:09:55,592 --> 00:10:00,791
but she'll just ruin my birthday
and it's my day, not hers.

84
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:05,829
Well, now, think...
What are our options?

85
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:10,831
I could make up an excuse
and tell her not to come.

86
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,608
Mmmmm...

87
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:17,235
No, I can't do that.

88
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:19,841
And let's not forget it's supposed
to be a surprise.

89
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,541
Anyway, it's not her... it's just...

90
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:27,251
I don't feel up to it,
or her or anything.

91
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,225
How are things going with Mike?

92
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:30,949
Fine.

93
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:32,422
Good.

94
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,098
No, they're not fine.
What a dumb word that is.

95
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:45,532
He gave me one of his wham bang
specials this morning & I'm mad at him.

96
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:48,243
Isn't that right? Shouldn't I be mad?

97
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:53,479
Yeah. Did you tell him?
What?

98
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:55,378
That you were mad at him?

99
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,950
Of course not... I moaned with pleasure
at his touch...

100
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,320
Isn't that what every man wants?

101
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:07,653
I don't know... is it?

102
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,127
Don't start that stuff with me.

103
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:13,427
Don't you think you'd feel better
if you snapped at Mike instead of me?

104
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:18,971
Think about where your anger is going.

105
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:24,010
I'm sorry.

106
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:28,181
Stop apologizing and tell Mike
he makes you mad.

107
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,747
Tell him he stinks in bed?

108
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,319
Does he?

109
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:37,059
Yes.

110
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:39,056
Then tell him.

111
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:46,133
Maybe, there's something wrong with me.

112
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:47,927
There's nothing wrong with you.

113
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:50,906
Do you find me attractive?

114
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:52,799
Of course.

115
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:55,067
Would you want to sleep with me?

116
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:57,238
Yes.

117
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:00,415
Then why don't you?

118
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,218
Because I love my wife

119
00:12:07,457 --> 00:12:10,449
and sleeping with you isn't worth
jeopardizing my marriage.

120
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,756
Is it worth it to you,
to jeopardize yours?

121
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:15,756
I don't know.

122
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:18,292
Hi...

123
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:30,038
Stop it...

124
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:09,638
Mommy...

125
00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:12,715
Mommy...

126
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:15,213
You be quiet...

127
00:22:15,931 --> 00:22:20,027
I'm sorry... I shouldn't been so rude.
Thank you for picking up... mmmm...

128
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:15,156
Hello. Who is this?

129
00:32:43,225 --> 00:32:44,749
It's not polite to stare.

130
00:33:56,631 --> 00:34:09,169
No... no... ohhh... No...

131
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,071
So you really think Auditron's going up

132
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:16,613
Well, I got it from a very good source.

133
00:34:26,328 --> 00:34:28,819
Double, huh?
You didn't hear it from me.

134
00:34:43,979 --> 00:34:46,929
You know what, I'm going to give my
broker a little call... well, what about

135
00:34:46,964 --> 00:34:49,880
You know what, I'm going to give my
broker a little call... well, what about

136
00:35:52,948 --> 00:35:55,712
No... wait...

137
00:35:56,051 --> 00:35:58,713
Please... just stand... and wait...
call the police. Wait!

138
00:36:00,188 --> 00:36:03,055
Oh please, call the police!

139
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,048
Dr. Elliott, this is Lou Freeman,

140
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:05,480
I'm still in Chicago and won't be back
in time for our appointment on Friday.

141
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:07,984
I'll give you a call on Monday, okay?

142
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:16,890
Robert, call George... I'll be home over
the weekend.

143
00:37:23,305 --> 00:37:25,432
This is Bobbi...

144
00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:28,942
You won't see me anymore

145
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,270
so I'm going to have a little session
with your machine.

146
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:36,117
Oh Doctor, I'm so unhappy...

147
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:39,009
I'm a girl inside this man's body

148
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:42,256
and you're not helping me to get out.

149
00:37:42,524 --> 00:37:45,288
So I got a new Shrink... Levy's him name

150
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,324
He's gonna sign the papers
so I can get my operation.

151
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:58,166
Oh and um... I borrowed your razor and
um... well, you'll read all about it.

152
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,365
Some blonde saw me but I'll get her.

153
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:12,382
Remember... if he calls you,
you better tell Levy, I'm okay.

154
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:16,749
Don't make me... Be a bad girl again.

155
00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:30,834
I just want to confirm our appointment
for tomorrow at 2 o'clock.

156
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:42,449
This is Detective Marino from
the 13th Precinct.

157
00:38:43,651 --> 00:38:47,587
One of you patients... uh, a Kate Miller,
was killed tonight.

158
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:49,752
I wonder if you'd stop down
at the Precinct

159
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:53,188
and ask for me... a guy who's got some
questions I think you can help me with.

160
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:16,245
Are you sure?
Mmmm... Okay... come with me.

161
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:26,559
How's it going?
Fine...

162
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:30,765
Hey Eddie!

163
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:33,099
Listen, I want you to take this over
to the Lab

164
00:39:33,368 --> 00:39:34,335
and get some pictures made of it.
Yeah...

165
00:39:35,637 --> 00:39:37,662
Keep an eye on her purse,
we think she's bluffing.

166
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:38,462
Okay.

167
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:40,104
Marino!
Yeah.

168
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:41,364
I'm Dr. Elliott.

169
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,074
Oh Doctor... Uh, say listen,

170
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:47,143
would you uh, have a seat outside my
office in the corner over there.

171
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:48,040
I'll be right with you.

172
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:49,112
All right.

173
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:51,050
So give me three copies...

174
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:55,289
Why don't you let go of me, will ya?

175
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:17,804
Are you Kate Miller's son?

176
00:40:21,683 --> 00:40:24,652
I'm Dr. Elliott... your mother's doctor.

177
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:33,761
Why do you have to be here?

178
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:40,324
I made Mike bring me.
He's uh... identifying the...

179
00:40:41,936 --> 00:40:44,097
My Mom wouldn't be dead
if I had come with her.

180
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:47,806
Oh, you shouldn’t feel responsible
for your mother's death.

181
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,776
If you talk about it,
I might be able to help you.

182
00:40:52,046 --> 00:40:54,606
Do you know who killed her?
No.

183
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:55,907
Then you can't help, can you?

184
00:40:56,184 --> 00:40:59,915
Not now maybe but later,

185
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:03,954
if you want someone to talk to about
all this... ask your father to...

186
00:41:04,225 --> 00:41:07,717
No, no, no, he's not my father.
My father was killed in Viet Nam.

187
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:22,909
Take this you can call me anytime
I'm always there all day long.

188
00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:23,872
I'm usually there.

189
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:25,339
Okay Doctor, let's talk for a minute.

190
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:29,216
Call me.

191
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:24,967
She was picked up by Lockman
at the museum.

192
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,730
She spent the afternoon at his place

193
00:42:27,008 --> 00:42:28,942
and was chopped up in the elevator
on her way out.

194
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,141
That girl out there saw the murder.

195
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:34,114
That's terrible...

196
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,616
Do you know who it is?
Some broad!

197
00:42:37,852 --> 00:42:38,375
A woman.

198
00:42:38,753 --> 00:42:41,688
Yeah... Miss Blake didn't get
a great look at her face

199
00:42:41,956 --> 00:42:43,947
cause she had on these big sunglasses.

200
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:45,988
Is there anything I can do to help?

201
00:42:46,861 --> 00:42:49,796
Yeah... when you spoke with Mrs. Miller.

202
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:52,064
Did she say she was gonna meet anybody?

203
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,357
No.

204
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:55,532
Did she leave your office with anybody?

205
00:42:55,837 --> 00:42:56,826
No.

206
00:42:57,338 --> 00:42:58,862
What was she seeing you for?

207
00:42:59,173 --> 00:43:01,471
Oh nothing too serious. She was having
some problems with her marriage

208
00:43:01,743 --> 00:43:03,335
and I was helping her work them out.

209
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:04,906
What kind of problem!

210
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:06,942
Are you married Detective Marino?

211
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:10,111
Yeah.

212
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:11,409
Children?

213
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:12,681
Two sons.

214
00:43:12,954 --> 00:43:15,650
When was the last time you had
inter course with your wife?

215
00:43:18,493 --> 00:43:20,427
Now what the fuck is it to you?

216
00:43:20,695 --> 00:43:24,256
That's exactly how I feel about your
questions concerning Mrs. Miller.

217
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:31,336
Oh hey look, Doctor.

218
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:34,369
We got a brutally murder woman here...

219
00:43:34,642 --> 00:43:40,308
who passed the point of being
embarrassed by anything U might tell me

220
00:43:44,152 --> 00:43:45,176
I guess you're right.

221
00:43:45,453 --> 00:43:46,420
I'm sorry, but I'm just not used to

222
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:48,417
discussing the patient's case
with outsiders.

223
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,356
I'm not an outsider I'm a cop.
Now let's make it easy for you.

224
00:43:54,662 --> 00:43:56,357
Was she looking to get killed?

225
00:43:56,664 --> 00:43:57,995
You mean was she suicidal?
Yeah.

226
00:43:58,266 --> 00:43:58,755
No.

227
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:02,161
No... uh... so uh, why did she pick up
this Lockman character up?

228
00:44:02,437 --> 00:44:02,994
He could've been the killer.

229
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:03,703
But he wasn't.

230
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:05,371
Yeah but the next guy might have been.

231
00:44:05,673 --> 00:44:08,301
You know, if at first you don't succeed
Do you think she wanted to get killed.

232
00:44:08,676 --> 00:44:10,234
Don't you? Mm?

233
00:44:10,511 --> 00:44:14,242
Look we got some hot pants broad
cruising around for some action...

234
00:44:14,615 --> 00:44:18,415
that guy she picked up went down on her
in a cab, for Christ's sake...

235
00:44:18,686 --> 00:44:23,385
I got a blow by low description from
the cabby... ahhh...

236
00:44:23,658 --> 00:44:27,685
After she finishes with him, she comes
on to some weirdo in the elevator?

237
00:44:27,962 --> 00:44:31,022
Hey, there's all kinds of ways to
get killed in this city,

238
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:33,426
if you're looking for it.

239
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:39,665
Well... yes she did have a problem
about her sexual worth.

240
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:44,400
And this morning...
She asked me if I was attracted to her.

241
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,806
Yeah, but you're not a psycho.

242
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:50,716
You do know some though,
don't you Doc?

243
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:53,545
Yes of course.
I do some work it Bellevue.

244
00:44:54,756 --> 00:44:57,691
Hey, uh, could she have met one of
the nuts in your office?

245
00:44:57,959 --> 00:45:01,395
I mean some kind of weirdo she could've
turned on that might have followed her?

246
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,198
The term we use
Detective Marino is not weirdo

247
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:11,732
but a person suffering from emotional
dysfunction and a problem of maladaption

248
00:45:12,073 --> 00:45:14,303
And they never come to my office.

249
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:18,376
Are you sure,

250
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:23,380
How about new patient?

251
00:45:23,985 --> 00:45:27,614
I mean how do you know how nuts
they are until you see 'em?

252
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:29,550
Well of course that's possible,
but it's hardly likely...

253
00:45:29,824 --> 00:45:35,387
Doctor, you're not protecting
one of your patients now, are you?

254
00:45:35,663 --> 00:45:37,324
Absolutely not.

255
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:43,299
Well Doc, you've got to
look at it my way.

256
00:45:43,938 --> 00:45:47,396
See, we got no leads,
except a witness out there...

257
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:52,009
Who maybe... should take a look at
all your patients

258
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:52,769
that were around that morning.

259
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:57,347
And that way I can be absolutely sure
that my uh... weirdo

260
00:45:57,618 --> 00:46:00,246
isn't your person suffering from

261
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:05,584
emotional dysfunctions and problems
of maladaption.

262
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:10,629
Peter, come on. Let's go home.

263
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:45,499
Okay Doctor, I'm sorry, you're not more
uh, cooperative which means that

264
00:46:45,766 --> 00:46:48,894
I'm just gonna have to waste some time
in getting a court order

265
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,899
to check out your appointment book.

266
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:55,370
I'm sorry too but I feel I must protect
the confidentiality of my patients.

267
00:46:55,643 --> 00:47:00,842
Oh, of course, we're just
two professionals doing our job huh?

268
00:47:01,182 --> 00:47:03,013
It's too bad we can't work together.

269
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:09,047
Come on... thank you very much for
your help, I'll be in touch.

270
00:47:14,195 --> 00:47:16,720
Yes, thanks for waiting,
this is the answering service.

271
00:47:16,998 --> 00:47:18,226
Would you care to leave a message?

272
00:47:18,499 --> 00:47:20,467
Yes, I would. This is Dr. Elliott.

273
00:47:20,735 --> 00:47:21,565
How do spell that?

274
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:24,669
E double l Io double t.

275
00:47:24,939 --> 00:47:26,065
What is the message?

276
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,036
Would you please say that
I would very much like to see her

277
00:47:29,443 --> 00:47:31,172
and could she call me at my office.

278
00:47:33,514 --> 00:47:35,175
So, Miss Blake.

279
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:39,044
Uh, are you still living at
93 Nassau Street?

280
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,014
That's right.

281
00:47:40,288 --> 00:47:42,518
Mmm... Tell me, how did you happen to be

282
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,486
in that building that
Mrs. Miller was killed in?

283
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,584
I was visiting a friend.

284
00:47:48,062 --> 00:47:49,893
And who was that?

285
00:47:50,598 --> 00:47:55,968
Well... it's sort of embarrassing.
I'd rather not say.

286
00:47:56,337 --> 00:47:57,702
Why?

287
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,398
He's married.

288
00:48:01,776 --> 00:48:04,142
Ohhh... what kind of building is this,
huh?

289
00:48:04,412 --> 00:48:06,972
Everybody's getting laid after lunch.

290
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:13,748
I didn't say I was getting laid,
to use your expression.

291
00:48:15,456 --> 00:48:19,290
What's the matter huh?
I'm a little crude for you uh?

292
00:48:19,827 --> 00:48:21,351
That's right.

293
00:48:23,998 --> 00:48:26,660
Aw look Miss Blake,
let's cut this shit, huh?

294
00:48:26,934 --> 00:48:28,834
I got all the dope on you right here.

295
00:48:29,203 --> 00:48:32,570
Uh does this look familiar, uh?
Uh, let me see... March 5th.

296
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,330
Charged, Disorderly conduct...

297
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:37,077
Solicitation for the purpose
of prostitution.

298
00:48:37,345 --> 00:48:41,338
Arresting Officer Durham... apprehended
at the Park Avenue Hotel.

299
00:48:41,616 --> 00:48:44,585
Oooo... classy arrest.
Thank you.

300
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:46,410
Let's face it, you're a whore, huh?

301
00:48:46,687 --> 00:48:49,281
Or a Park Avenue whore,
but you're still a whore.

302
00:48:49,624 --> 00:48:52,024
Now, who were you fucking?

303
00:48:55,596 --> 00:48:58,895
Fuck you!
No... fuck you...

304
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:01,600
Hey, you're no witness,
you're a suspect!

305
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:02,767
Uh, what are you talking about?

306
00:49:03,037 --> 00:49:05,198
We got a murder weapon with a nice set
of your prints on it.

307
00:49:05,473 --> 00:49:07,464
Hey that's bullshit!
Why would I want to kill her?

308
00:49:07,742 --> 00:49:09,573
You were there with the razor.
You tell me!

309
00:49:09,844 --> 00:49:11,573
I told you, there was a blond woman
in the elevator...

310
00:49:11,846 --> 00:49:14,781
Yeah except nobody else saw this blond
woman enter or leave the building.

311
00:49:15,049 --> 00:49:18,143
Uh, you didn't notice if she had wings,
did you?

312
00:49:18,486 --> 00:49:20,920
She was in the elevator. I saw her.

313
00:49:21,255 --> 00:49:22,347
So what were you doing there?

314
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:24,849
I had a job.
Who?

315
00:49:25,126 --> 00:49:26,252
You want me to get in trouble don't you

316
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,391
You are in trouble.

317
00:49:27,662 --> 00:49:28,594
Hey, I didn't kill her.

318
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:30,396
So who were you fucking?

319
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:33,566
Ted... I didn't get his last name...
he's from out of town.

320
00:49:33,934 --> 00:49:35,401
Oh... Oh well that's great... yeah...

321
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:39,766
from out of town... oh... that's almost
as good as the Blonde from the elevator

322
00:49:40,174 --> 00:49:43,666
it's true. He was standing right
behind me, so the elevator door opens

323
00:49:43,944 --> 00:49:47,880
and that... woman inside...
all cut up and bleeding.

324
00:49:48,149 --> 00:49:50,617
I know all about Mrs. Miller.
We got her downstairs.

325
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:52,851
But what about this Blonde?
Did he see her too?

326
00:49:53,354 --> 00:49:54,582
I don't know.

327
00:49:57,224 --> 00:50:00,955
Well... er... Miss Miss Blake,

328
00:50:01,228 --> 00:50:03,788
you're gonna save you a lot of trouble
by finding this uh,

329
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:05,723
this Ted from out of town

330
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,525
and getting him in town and down town
and in here

331
00:50:08,803 --> 00:50:12,466
to sign this statement as to exactly
what he saw and when he saw it.

332
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,901
How the hell am I supposed to
know where he is?

333
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:17,201
Well if you can't find him,
I sure can't.

334
00:50:17,478 --> 00:50:22,415
And anyway, you got a lot better
motivation than I do... your ass.

335
00:50:24,051 --> 00:50:27,817
Now get the hell outta here.
I'm giving you 28 hours.

336
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:31,525
And don't try to blow town.
I'll be keeping tabs on you.

337
00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:35,291
Norma?
Liz... Where the hell have you been?

338
00:50:35,563 --> 00:50:39,465
I've been trying to get you all day.
Oh...

339
00:50:42,503 --> 00:50:45,495
Oh Ted was terrific... as a matter of
fact, that's why I'm calling,

340
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,966
I'd like to see him again...

341
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:54,042
When's he coming back?
Two weeks? That's no good.

342
00:50:54,348 --> 00:50:58,375
Um, do you have a number for him?
I'd like to give him a call.

343
00:51:01,188 --> 00:51:03,349
What do you mean your Escort Service
doesn't give out numbers?

344
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:05,216
I want to talk to him.

345
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:10,760
Trouble? No, I'm not in any trouble,
I just want to talk to the guy...

346
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:17,167
Okay, okay, thanks, thanks for nothing

347
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,605
You're just never in.

348
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:53,173
I've been at it myself,
running down that nosy bitch.

349
00:55:57,351 --> 00:55:59,376
I found out where she lives.

350
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,989
So, I'm just gonna wait right here
until she shows her face.

351
00:56:05,959 --> 00:56:09,451
And then I'm going to
cut those spying eyes out!

352
00:56:11,965 --> 00:56:13,796
What were you calling me about anyway?

353
00:56:14,735 --> 00:56:18,136
It wouldn't be about that murder
I read about in the papers.

354
00:56:18,439 --> 00:56:20,270
Hell of a way to lose a patient!

355
00:56:20,741 --> 00:56:22,174
But you shouldn't try to fuck 'em Doc!

356
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:24,070
Hi Max... it's Liz.

357
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:26,939
Uh look,
I wanna buy 60 shares of Auditron.

358
00:56:27,214 --> 00:56:28,078
What's it sell for?

359
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:30,613
I'm glad I took care of that cockteaser

360
00:56:32,286 --> 00:56:33,685
Fifteen sixty a share?

361
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:35,650
And you would've done
the same thing yourself.

362
00:56:35,923 --> 00:56:39,415
It's nine hundred and thirty-six... uh...
Hold it a minute, Max.

363
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:42,791
I guess that's why I used your razor.

364
00:56:43,063 --> 00:56:45,258
Hello.
But don't worry about it Doc...

365
00:56:45,566 --> 00:56:46,362
Hi Norma...

366
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,965
Just call the police...
I'll still be around...

367
00:56:48,202 --> 00:56:52,434
I'm sorry about yesterday...
Yes, I know, I was a bad girl...

368
00:56:52,706 --> 00:56:54,571
Remember, if Levy calls...

369
00:56:54,842 --> 00:56:55,900
Tonight?

370
00:56:56,143 --> 00:56:56,734
Tell him I'm okay...

371
00:56:57,077 --> 00:57:00,205
No, I really can't... no, um,
hold on just a minute...

372
00:57:00,447 --> 00:57:01,539
I'm talking to my mother.

373
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:03,816
Max, when do you need the money?

374
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:07,542
That's funny... No, I don't want to
sell anything. Isn't it?

375
00:57:07,788 --> 00:57:08,812
Hold it, Max.

376
00:57:10,257 --> 00:57:15,285
Norma do you think this guy might go
for five hundred?

377
00:57:15,963 --> 00:57:19,660
Great! Hold on just a minute,
I'm gonna say goodbye to my mother.

378
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:24,870
Okay, Max, I've got the money.
I'll have it for you tomorrow okay okay

379
00:57:27,107 --> 00:57:29,735
Hi Norma... do you think
you could put together

380
00:57:29,977 --> 00:57:34,607
a coffee break and a hot lunch...
for tomorrow

381
00:57:34,882 --> 00:57:38,875
Yeah, I need a thousand dollars for
my mother's operation...

382
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,746
No, no... it's nothing serious...
I'm sure she'll be fine.

383
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:47,124
Great! Okay, now, uh, what time tonight
8:30... mmmmm... where?

384
00:57:47,394 --> 00:57:48,759
It's been three or four years
since your surgery... uh huh...

385
00:57:48,996 --> 00:57:52,022
I wanna show a picture of you prior
to the uh...

386
00:57:52,266 --> 00:57:54,461
Okay... anything special?

387
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:57,898
Actually we stole it from people
Magazine which has an article...

388
00:57:58,138 --> 00:58:00,299
Oh thank God
straight fucks are still in style...

389
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:03,009
This is Nancy Hart, the transsexual...
Just in from Cleveland, huh?

390
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,404
Isn't that something?

391
00:58:04,645 --> 00:58:06,044
Okay... I'll be there.

392
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,304
You were a War Correspondent?

393
00:58:07,548 --> 00:58:11,040
Among other things and a Foreign
Correspondent in the Middle East.

394
00:58:11,285 --> 00:58:14,152
And I did a lot of police reporting

395
00:58:14,488 --> 00:58:17,787
and I dove on Spanish treasure wrecks
and...

396
00:58:18,058 --> 00:58:19,320
You did a lot of macho things, then?

397
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,551
This is very common among transsexuals.

398
00:58:21,895 --> 00:58:24,989
You find, uh, uh,
when I speak of transsexual

399
00:58:25,332 --> 00:58:27,300
I kind of speak of male to female

400
00:58:27,534 --> 00:58:30,435
because there're a whole lot of more of
them then going the other way.

401
00:58:30,704 --> 00:58:34,265
And an awful lot of them have uh,
real macho backgrounds.

402
00:58:34,508 --> 00:58:37,534
I know a Police cop, a West Pointer

403
00:58:37,878 --> 00:58:41,041
a couple of fighter pilots, uh,

404
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:43,713
they all... you know, most of
them tried real hard.

405
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:44,713
You were married twice?

406
00:58:45,052 --> 00:58:45,416
Mmmmhmmm...

407
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:46,983
You were also the father of
three children.

408
00:58:47,221 --> 00:58:48,017
Mmmmmmhmmmm...

409
00:58:48,255 --> 00:58:53,955
So... um... you, you enjoyed a... a, a,
I don't want to say normal,

410
00:58:54,228 --> 00:58:55,991
I guess that's a prejudicial way
to put it,

411
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:59,495
but you enjoyed the traditional role
of father.

412
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,097
You fathered three children...

413
00:59:01,335 --> 00:59:06,102
And you have engaged in at least
two heterosexual relationships.

414
00:59:06,506 --> 00:59:10,806
Oh well, now, I've always been
a devout heterosexual.

415
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,886
Cleveland? Excuse me?

416
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:29,094
Room 331. you're the guy
from Cleveland, right?

417
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:31,821
That's 331 and I'm from Cleveland.

418
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:35,965
Well hi, I'm Liz...
from the Escort Service.

419
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:38,460
You're kidding?

420
00:59:39,973 --> 00:59:40,530
It's me.

421
00:59:40,774 --> 00:59:44,369
Well, hey, hey, I'm glad to meet you.

422
00:59:44,978 --> 00:59:47,913
Well, are you gonna pump me right here
or invite me in?

423
00:59:48,181 --> 00:59:50,911
Oh I'm sorry, come in.
You know, could I get you anything?

424
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,110
93 Nassau Street.

425
01:00:22,149 --> 01:00:24,049
Well, come on, let's go.

426
01:00:37,664 --> 01:00:40,462
Uh, Look, forget that address
I just gave you.

427
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:42,565
Drop me at Columbus Circle.

428
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:47,564
Could you help me out?
Someone's following me.

429
01:00:49,476 --> 01:00:52,912
This is Dr. Elliott again Did Bobbi
pick up my messages yet?

430
01:00:53,413 --> 01:00:55,438
Yes she has.
She did?

431
01:00:55,682 --> 01:00:57,479
Yes she did.
When?

432
01:00:57,718 --> 01:00:59,379
Sorry, I wouldn't know.

433
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:05,556
Oh. Um, could you give her
another message, please?

434
01:01:05,892 --> 01:01:07,655
Yes. Yeah... Go ahead.

435
01:01:07,928 --> 01:01:10,419
It is urgent that I see her...

436
01:01:10,997 --> 01:01:15,696
I will be in my office all tonight
and after five tomorrow.

437
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:28,113
What's the going rate on running lights

438
01:01:39,326 --> 01:01:40,884
Did I lose her?

439
01:01:42,496 --> 01:01:44,464
You're doing swell, just swell.

440
01:01:49,202 --> 01:01:50,669
She's still coming'.

441
01:01:58,879 --> 01:02:03,009
Look, I didn't deliver, so why don't
you let me take you to dinner instead?

442
01:02:04,084 --> 01:02:06,518
Alright, you got a date.
Okay.

443
01:02:06,787 --> 01:02:07,685
Oh, look, I gotta go.

444
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:11,085
Okay. Listen, I'll give you a call.
Yeah, call me.

445
01:02:28,175 --> 01:02:29,802
Excuse me.

446
01:04:12,212 --> 01:04:14,874
What is she doing here for?
You know her?

447
01:04:20,186 --> 01:04:21,983
Hey Lady, what you looking for?

448

The train. They still stop here,
don't they?

449
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:28,621
Yeah, yeah... They stop here.
Stop down there too.

450
01:04:30,964 --> 01:04:32,989
Am I bothering you?

451
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:35,359
Naw, you ain't botherin' me.

452
01:04:35,869 --> 01:04:38,633
Good.
But you're botherin' me.

453
01:04:38,872 --> 01:04:39,770

Yeah, that's right.

455
01:04:42,876 --> 01:04:44,173
What're you gonna do about it man?

456
01:04:44,411 --> 01:04:45,878
I'm gonna break her... fuckin' ass.

457
01:04:46,146 --> 01:04:48,706
Hey why break it
when we can fuck it first, huh?

458
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:50,073
Hey Baby, where you going?

459
01:04:50,317 --> 01:04:51,648
Look, I don't want to crowd you guys.

460
01:04:51,885 --> 01:04:53,716
What're you down here
if you don't want to crowd us.

461
01:04:53,954 --> 01:04:55,182
Give me a break!

462
01:04:55,422 --> 01:04:57,652
Hey, wait a minute,
Where you goin', etc.

463
01:04:57,991 --> 01:04:59,925
You dumb ass!
Come 'on.

464
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:03,388
Come on, catch her!
Don't let her get away!

465
01:05:08,668 --> 01:05:09,532
Oooh!

466
01:05:09,769 --> 01:05:11,464
Take it easy lady.
This ain't the rush hour.

467
01:05:11,705 --> 01:05:13,764
Yeah well, where the fuck are you guys
when somebody needs you.

468
01:05:14,007 --> 01:05:15,565
I was almost attacked!
When?

469
01:05:15,809 --> 01:05:18,710
Right here, now. By those punks.

470
01:05:30,824 --> 01:05:32,416
I don't see nothin'.

471
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:33,921
Well, they were right here.

472
01:05:34,527 --> 01:05:36,791
I thought you said
you were attacked once...

473
01:05:43,169 --> 01:05:46,866
There are, but there's this Blonds
that's been following me...

474
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,798
Oh forget it.

475
01:08:33,873 --> 01:08:35,841
The Blonde must be one of
Elliott's parents.

476
01:08:36,142 --> 01:08:37,769
I was unloading my cameras when
I saw her come out of his office

477
01:08:38,011 --> 01:08:39,501
and I followed her to you.

478
01:08:39,746 --> 01:08:41,475
What was that stuff you sprayed on her?

479
01:08:41,714 --> 01:08:44,683
It's a kind of mace I made at home.
It's a pretty simple compound of sodium

480
01:08:44,951 --> 01:08:49,012
Look, save the Mr. Wise lecture.
I wouldn't know sodium from Adam.

481
01:08:49,889 --> 01:08:51,652
It sure worked.

482
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:55,190
It's temporary blindness.
It only lasts for about ten seconds.

483
01:08:58,665 --> 01:09:00,223
It saved my life.

484
01:09:00,867 --> 01:09:04,997
I know. I wished it had saved Mom's.

485
01:09:08,174 --> 01:09:10,608
You liked your Mom a lot didn't you?

486
01:09:12,545 --> 01:09:17,346
Yeah. I miss her.

487
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:25,052
You want some more coke?

488
01:09:26,192 --> 01:09:28,422
No. No, thank you.

489
01:09:29,362 --> 01:09:30,795
How do you like my painting?

490
01:09:35,969 --> 01:09:38,301
It's um, very nice.

491
01:09:38,538 --> 01:09:41,405
I bought it a couple of years ago for
five hundred dollars.

492
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,241
So it's really a great investment.

493
01:09:44,544 --> 01:09:49,675
I mean ten years from now,
it could be worth a million dollars.

494
01:09:51,351 --> 01:09:53,512
More if the artist dies, of course.

495
01:09:54,254 --> 01:09:59,385
Um, good luck with it.
Thanks.

496
01:10:00,526 --> 01:10:02,426
Doesn't your father wonder
where you are?

497
01:10:02,695 --> 01:10:04,822
Uh he's not my father.
He's my step father.

498
01:10:05,098 --> 01:10:06,861
Anyway I told him I was spending
the night at my friend Paul

499
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,124
so he'll cover for me.

500
01:10:08,468 --> 01:10:10,129
Well, I'll take you home tomorrow.

501
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:11,368
No, no, I don't want to go home.

502
01:10:11,638 --> 01:10:12,798
Look, Miss Blake,
I've got some pictures...

503
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:13,664
Call me Liz, okay?

504
01:10:13,973 --> 01:10:16,567
Okay, Liz. I've got some pictures of
that Blonde in my camera

505
01:10:16,809 --> 01:10:18,106
I had outside Elliott's office.

506
01:10:18,344 --> 01:10:21,745
Now we gotta get in, get Elliott's
disappointment book an get her name.

507
01:10:22,081 --> 01:10:25,175
That's what the police are for.
Come on, let's talk to Marino.

508
01:10:25,518 --> 01:10:26,450
Fine, you talk to Marino.

509
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,277
I'm going to find out the Blonde's name

510
01:10:28,988 --> 01:10:32,583
Who do you think you are, Superman?
You're just a kid for God's sake.

511
01:10:32,825 --> 01:10:34,850
Yeah, I'm the kid that saved your life.

512
01:10:39,799 --> 01:10:45,499
Alright, so... uh... look,
let me talk to Marino.

513
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:48,366
If he cops out, then I'll help you.

514
01:10:51,544 --> 01:10:56,709
Okay. You can't, can't mention my name.
Mike would kill me.

515
01:10:57,016 --> 01:11:01,248
I'm supposed to be uh... buh...
studying for a French exam.

516
01:11:02,588 --> 01:11:05,751
Well, your friend's covering for
you tonight, right?

517
01:11:06,726 --> 01:11:10,822
Well, I'm your friend too and
I'll be the best cover you ever had.

518
01:11:12,031 --> 01:11:13,555
Okay.

519
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,231
Well, you sure, you gonna be okay, here?

520
01:11:16,536 --> 01:11:17,628
Fine.

521
01:11:18,638 --> 01:11:22,768
Here you go... Goodnight.

522
01:11:23,042 --> 01:11:24,009
Goodnight.

523
01:11:28,214 --> 01:11:30,148
Hey Marino, I gotta talk to you.

524
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:31,405
Did your Out of Town turn up?

525
01:11:31,651 --> 01:11:32,174
No.

526
01:11:32,418 --> 01:11:33,908
Then you better send for
your overnight bags.

527
01:11:34,187 --> 01:11:36,121
Hey come on,
you know I didn't kill that woman.

528
01:11:36,389 --> 01:11:38,050
You're still my best bet.

529
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:42,090
For your information, she tried
to kill me last night.

530
01:11:42,528 --> 01:11:44,086
Really?

531
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:46,896
Is that supposed to be concern
in your voice?

532
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:50,567
Hey, I take a professional interest in
our citizens knocking each other off.

533
01:11:50,837 --> 01:11:52,270
Uh, where did this happen?

534
01:11:52,638 --> 01:11:54,970
She followed me from
the Sheraton into the subway.

535
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:57,233
I thought I lost her there but she was
waiting for me when I got home.

536
01:11:57,477 --> 01:11:58,239
She tried to slash me...

537
01:11:58,544 --> 01:12:00,034
Any witnesses to this one?
Yes.

538
01:12:00,346 --> 01:12:01,313
Who?

539
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:06,145
I can't tell you.

540
01:12:06,486 --> 01:12:07,612
Out of town again?

541
01:12:08,054 --> 01:12:10,386
No, I just promised.
I wouldn't say anything.

542
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:12,887
You know,
this has a familiar ring to it.

543
01:12:13,126 --> 01:12:15,924
Look Marino, I'm not interested
in your wise ass remarks.

544
01:12:16,162 --> 01:12:17,823
Someone's trying to kill me
and I need help.

545
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:20,532
I'll help you. I got a nice cell.
You'll be very safe in it.

546
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:21,798
Rey Eddie...

547
01:12:22,235 --> 01:12:25,830
Hey wait a minute. Look, I know the
murderer is one of Elliott's patients.

548
01:12:26,072 --> 01:12:26,697
How do you know that.

549
01:12:26,939 --> 01:12:28,531
Because she came out of his office.

550
01:12:28,775 --> 01:12:29,799
Did you see her?

551
01:12:31,577 --> 01:12:34,478
Well no, not exactly.
But I know she came out.

552
01:12:34,747 --> 01:12:36,578
You gotta get in there,
get his appointment book,

553
01:12:36,816 --> 01:12:38,374
her name's gotta be in it.

554
01:12:38,785 --> 01:12:41,413
I hope you make a better hooker
than you do a detective.

555
01:12:41,754 --> 01:12:44,279
I thought about Elliott's
appointment book a long time ago.

556
01:12:44,524 --> 01:12:44,956
So?

557
01:12:45,224 --> 01:12:47,852
So, you can't just walk in to
some Shrink's joint

558
01:12:48,094 --> 01:12:49,356
and start going through his books.

559
01:12:49,595 --> 01:12:50,823
You need a search warrant.

560
01:12:51,064 --> 01:12:52,190
And judges take a long time

561
01:12:52,432 --> 01:12:55,799
before they let you start snooping
around some Shrink's office.

562
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:02,066
Course, uh, that wouldn't prevent
a paranoid murder suspect

563
01:13:02,308 --> 01:13:04,833
from uh... breaking in.

564
01:13:05,144 --> 01:13:09,308
You know, uh, searching for
some evidence to defend her case.

565
01:13:09,549 --> 01:13:11,744
Yeah, well I get it.
You want me to break in for you.

566
01:13:11,984 --> 01:13:14,043
Hey, I don't want you to
do anything illegal.

567
01:13:14,287 --> 01:13:18,485
You can quote me on that.
But I'm booking you tomorrow.

568
01:13:18,758 --> 01:13:21,283
You go it? Tomorrow.

569
01:13:43,216 --> 01:13:44,308
I'm Dr. Levy.

570
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,677
How do you do? I'm Dr. Elliott.

571
01:13:49,088 --> 01:13:51,420
What can I do for you, Dr. Elliott?

572
01:13:52,058 --> 01:13:53,787
You're seeing a patient of mine.

573
01:13:54,327 --> 01:13:55,521
That's right.

574
01:13:55,795 --> 01:13:57,228
I believe she's dangerous.

575
01:13:57,463 --> 01:13:59,226
Really. In what way?

576
01:13:59,465 --> 01:14:00,523
She's causing me trouble

577
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:03,200
because I wouldn't approve
her sex change operation.

578
01:14:03,536 --> 01:14:05,367
What kind of trouble has she caused you

579
01:14:05,638 --> 01:14:08,163
She's threatened me several times
over the phone.

580
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:10,238
She also stole my razor.

581
01:14:11,344 --> 01:14:12,174
Why would she do that?

582
01:14:12,411 --> 01:14:14,003
Doctor, did you read about the woman

583
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:16,044
that was slashed to death in
an elevator?

584
01:14:16,382 --> 01:14:17,815
It was on the front page,
I could hardly miss...

585
01:14:18,084 --> 01:14:20,746
Kate Miller, the victim, was my patient

586
01:14:21,888 --> 01:14:24,118
You don't think that Bobbi had
anything to do with that?

587
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:28,156
My razor's gone Kate Miller
was killed with a razor.

588
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:30,326
Nobody else could have taken it?

589
01:14:30,563 --> 01:14:34,124
Doctor, I am not paranoid.
Bobbi has threatened me over the phone.

590
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,799
She said she was going to hurt me.

591
01:14:36,035 --> 01:14:38,469
My patient was slashed to death
and my razor's gone.

592
01:14:38,938 --> 01:14:42,066
Now you don't have to be a detective
to figure it out, do you?

593
01:14:43,409 --> 01:14:46,867
Come with me and uh,
we'll talk to the police.

594
01:14:47,146 --> 01:14:48,636
I've already been to the police.

595
01:14:49,348 --> 01:14:52,511
But I didn't tell them about Bobbi.
I wanted to talk to her first.

596
01:14:52,752 --> 01:14:55,312
I wanted to be absolutely sure
that it was her.

597
01:14:55,555 --> 01:14:57,216
But she wouldn't return my calls.

598
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,753
I was hoping you'd be able to help.

599
01:15:00,493 --> 01:15:04,793
Um, yes. I'll help. I'll talk to her.

600
01:15:05,064 --> 01:15:06,531
If I agree with your diagnosis...

601
01:15:06,899 --> 01:15:07,763
We'll go to the police.

602
01:15:07,934 --> 01:15:11,370
Thank you.
Please let me know what happens.

603
01:15:11,837 --> 01:15:14,305
Do you know why Bobbi came to see me
in the first place?

604
01:15:14,574 --> 01:15:16,041
No.

605
01:15:20,213 --> 01:15:21,578
Why don't we go to my office and...

606
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:24,146
We'll try to get in touch with her,
Hmmmm?

607
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:26,510
Oh I'm late for an appointment now.

608
01:15:26,919 --> 01:15:29,786
Why don't you call me at my office
when you're reached her.

609
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:33,287
All right.
You sure, you'll be at your office?

610
01:15:33,526 --> 01:15:35,084
Yes, I'm sure.

611
01:15:35,928 --> 01:15:37,395
I'll call you there.

612
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:50,641
Uh, Peter Miller,
I left some super 8 film.

613
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,637
There's four dollars there.

614
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,852
I timed Elliott's patients coming
out of his office.

615
01:16:08,094 --> 01:16:09,425
The fastest was 8 seconds.

616
01:16:09,662 --> 01:16:11,220
So I set my camera to go off
every 2 seconds

617
01:16:11,464 --> 01:16:13,659
so I'd be sure to get a good
about of everybody.

618
01:16:28,581 --> 01:16:29,912
That's her.

619
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:32,174
She must be his last appointment.

620
01:16:32,451 --> 01:16:34,282
We gotta get a look in that book.

621
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,451
Yeah, I know. Marino wants it too,
only I can get it for him faster.

622
01:16:39,191 --> 01:16:41,625
No legal red tape just my ass.

623
01:16:41,927 --> 01:16:42,621
Aw, look I'll get it.

624
01:16:42,928 --> 01:16:44,122
I mean nobody cares about my ass, right?

625
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:45,692
I'm just a grief struck kid.

626
01:16:46,432 --> 01:16:53,668
Yeah, but what a kid!
Okay, I got an idea.

627
01:16:56,909 --> 01:16:59,002
It was very nice of you to see me.

628
01:17:02,948 --> 01:17:05,314
It was nice of you to see me so soon.

629
01:17:06,085 --> 01:17:08,883
I try to keep my nights open for
returning phone calls

630
01:17:09,121 --> 01:17:11,851
or in case a patient
needs some extra help.

631
01:17:13,259 --> 01:17:14,886
I was worried about you.

632
01:17:16,228 --> 01:17:18,458
You've had a terrible experience.

633
01:17:19,899 --> 01:17:27,567
I know. I didn't realize it, but I've
been having these terrible nightmares.

634
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:33,337
Oh... what were they about?

635
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:39,546
Well... I have to get a cigarette.

636
01:17:41,987 --> 01:17:45,218
In this house that I've never been to
before... visiting a friend.

637
01:17:50,429 --> 01:17:51,726
He's not there...

638
01:17:53,933 --> 01:17:57,960
I'm watching T.V.
And the doorbell rings...

639
01:17:59,705 --> 01:18:05,610
it's a man... he's big... dark...

640
01:18:07,913 --> 01:18:11,110
he says his car broke down
and he needs to use the phone...

641
01:18:12,885 --> 01:18:16,981
I believe him... and let him in...
although,

642
01:18:17,223 --> 01:18:18,850
I know something's wrong...

643
01:18:22,795 --> 01:18:28,131
He closes the door...
Locks it and takes out a razor.

644
01:18:29,835 --> 01:18:31,769
He says he's not gonna hurt me...

645
01:18:36,942 --> 01:18:41,106
then he tells me
what he's gonna do to me...

646
01:18:43,382 --> 01:18:45,077
And how much I'm gonna like it...

647
01:18:46,419 --> 01:18:52,949
all the time he's talking...
I can see the bulge in his pants

648
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,628
He orders me to strip... I do it...

649
01:18:59,465 --> 01:19:05,597
Keeping one eye on the razor...
He drops his pants...

650
01:19:06,939 --> 01:19:11,069
He forces me down on my stomach...

651
01:19:11,577 --> 01:19:21,145
He kneels down behind me...
and rests the cold blade...

652
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:39,633
Forcing it... I'm sorry.

653
01:19:41,807 --> 01:19:43,297
What's the matter?

654
01:19:43,576 --> 01:19:46,204
It's just so dirty.

655
01:19:46,445 --> 01:19:47,810
Why do you say that?

656
01:19:48,714 --> 01:19:51,740
Look, I know what dirty is
and this is dirty.

657
01:19:56,055 --> 01:19:58,182
Well, why don't you just talk about it?

658
01:19:58,757 --> 01:20:00,850
I'm sure it's not so bad as you think.

659
01:20:02,261 --> 01:20:07,028
It's very bad, and you're talking to
an expert on bad.

660
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:11,362
Oh really?
Now what makes you such an expert?

661
01:20:12,404 --> 01:20:13,996
Cause, I'm a hooker.

662
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:15,500
Ah...

663
01:20:16,308 --> 01:20:21,007
And I've done most of the bad things,
you just read about.

664
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:25,008
Do you like doing these things?
Sometimes.

665
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:26,648
What do you like about it?

666
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,581
I like to turn men on.

667
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:34,188
I must do a pretty good job,
because they pay me a lot.

668
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,858
Do you ever have any sex
that's not paid for?

669
01:20:39,431 --> 01:20:41,058
Is that a proposal?

670
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:43,893
No...

671
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:47,634
It's what we psychiatrists call...
questions.

672
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:52,110
Yes.
Yes what?

673
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:55,505
Yes, I do... from men that turn me on.

674
01:20:57,182 --> 01:20:59,173
What sort of men turn you on?

675
01:21:02,254 --> 01:21:07,123
Mature, doctorly type... like you.

676
01:21:10,095 --> 01:21:14,930
Are you sexually attracted to me?
Yes, are you?

677
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:15,895
Attracted to you?

678
01:21:16,135 --> 01:21:17,363
Mmmmhmmm.

679
01:21:18,604 --> 01:21:19,901
Yes.

680
01:21:22,408 --> 01:21:24,876
But then, this isn't a social visit,
is it?

681
01:21:25,077 --> 01:21:25,736
You've come here for help

682
01:21:25,978 --> 01:21:28,845
and my job is to
offer you emotional assistance.

683
01:21:29,481 --> 01:21:35,886
How about some sexual assistance?
Do you wanna fuck me?

684
01:21:36,422 --> 01:21:38,788
Oh yes.
Then why don't you?

685
01:21:39,024 --> 01:21:39,888
Because I'm a Doctor and...

686
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:41,251
Fucked a lot of Doctors.

687
01:21:41,493 --> 01:21:43,518
And I'm married.
Fucked a lot of them too.

688
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:45,626
Don't you think we're getting off
the point?

689
01:21:47,066 --> 01:21:50,593
Do you mind if I take off my coat?
No.

690
01:22:03,816 --> 01:22:05,841
And the rest too?

691
01:22:07,252 --> 01:22:09,948
Now why would you want to
do a thing like that?

692
01:22:10,923 --> 01:22:14,484
Well... because of the size of
that bulge in your pants.

693
01:22:16,462 --> 01:22:18,396
I don't think you're so married.

694
01:22:31,143 --> 01:22:35,102
Well? What 'dya think?

695
01:22:39,451 --> 01:22:41,783
I think you're a very attractive woman.

696
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:46,153
Would you like to touch me?

697
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,389
Uh, yes and no. Yes, because...

698
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,291
Then, why don't you?

699
01:22:53,565 --> 01:22:55,032
I told you why.

700
01:22:58,337 --> 01:23:01,033
Oh that's right.
You're a married doctor.

701
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:04,867
I remember now.
I think you're full of shit.

702
01:23:05,377 --> 01:23:10,337
You do? Just because I happen to have
personal and professional ethics.

703
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:15,186
Look, Doctor, I think you're kinda shy.

704
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:20,515
So, uh, I'm gonna go powder my nose

705
01:23:20,893 --> 01:23:26,490
and when I come back, I hope to find
your clothes right next to mine.

706
01:23:27,533 --> 01:23:31,833
And if not, we can just get back to
the mind fuck.

707
01:25:26,785 --> 01:25:27,717
Ohhh...

708
01:26:15,067 --> 01:26:16,796
Dr. Elliott...

709
01:26:25,744 --> 01:26:26,904
Dr. Elliott?

710
01:26:30,682 --> 01:26:31,842
Dr. Elliott?

711
01:26:36,188 --> 01:26:38,019
You really are shy, aren't you?

712
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:50,760
There's the Blonde!

713
01:28:13,385 --> 01:28:14,613
So, you had me followed?

714
01:28:14,853 --> 01:28:20,189
That's right. Uh, you've met Betty Luce
one of our best young police persons.

715
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:23,223
So, when I told you I was attacked on
the subways you thought I was nuts.

716
01:28:23,462 --> 01:28:26,556
Now, Detective Luce told me
she lost you at Columbus Circle.

717
01:28:26,832 --> 01:28:29,027
I didn't figure there was another
Blonde following you.

718
01:28:29,267 --> 01:28:30,461
I mean, who would?

719
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:34,235
Yeah, and you wrote me off as a girl
with an over active imagination.

720
01:28:34,473 --> 01:28:35,735
Yeah, something like that.

721
01:28:35,974 --> 01:28:37,066
And she followed me to Elliott's.

722
01:28:37,309 --> 01:28:38,469
That's right.

723
01:28:39,411 --> 01:28:42,778
Thank God! What's wrong with that guy,
anyway?

724
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:44,946
He was a transsexual.
What?

725
01:28:45,283 --> 01:28:48,548
A transsexual.
About to make the final step

726
01:28:48,787 --> 01:28:50,516
but his male side couldn't
let him do it.

727
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:52,484
Male side?

728
01:28:52,824 --> 01:28:56,351
There was Dr. Elliott
and there was Bobbi.

729
01:28:56,595 --> 01:29:01,123
Bobbi came to me to get psychiatric
approve for a ser reassignment operation

730
01:29:01,366 --> 01:29:04,858
I thought he was unstable
and Elliott confirmed my diagnosis.

731
01:29:05,103 --> 01:29:07,867
Opposite sexes inhabiting the same body

732
01:29:08,106 --> 01:29:10,870
The sex change operation was to
resolve the conflict.

733
01:29:11,109 --> 01:29:16,342
But as much as Bobbi tried to get it,
Elliott blocked it.

734
01:29:17,716 --> 01:29:19,183
So Bobbi got even.

735
01:29:19,418 --> 01:29:20,976
By killing Mrs. Miller.

736
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:25,278
Yes, she aroused Elliott.
Just as you did, Miss Blake.

737
01:29:25,857 --> 01:29:28,849
You mean when Elliott got turned on,
Bobbi took over?

738
01:29:29,094 --> 01:29:34,794
Yes. It was lie uh, Bobbi's red alert.
Elliott's penis became erect and...

739
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:35,998
And Bobbi took control...

740
01:29:36,234 --> 01:29:39,397
Trying to kill anyone that made Elliott
masculine sexual.

741
01:29:39,638 --> 01:29:40,900
When Elliot came into my office,

742
01:29:41,139 --> 01:29:44,700
it was the first time
I saw Bobbi's masculine self.

743
01:29:44,943 --> 01:29:48,504
When he told me he thought Bobbi
had killed Mrs. Miller,

744
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:50,906
he was confessing himself.

745
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:54,249
I immediately called Detective Marino.

746
01:29:55,754 --> 01:29:58,723
So why the hell didn't you stop me from
going to Elliott's?

747
01:29:58,957 --> 01:30:03,053
Why? Because I was at a football game
with my kids, that's why.

748
01:30:03,295 --> 01:30:06,458
By the time I spoke to Dr. Levy,
you were already over there.

749
01:30:06,698 --> 01:30:09,633
So you never really thought
I killed Mrs. Miller?

750
01:30:10,102 --> 01:30:14,368
No. But I had to get into Elliott's
office to find out which weirdo did,

751
01:30:14,606 --> 01:30:19,066
so uh, I pressed you into service.
You kidding?

752
01:30:19,744 --> 01:30:21,769
So I had Miss Luce there tailing you

753
01:30:22,013 --> 01:30:24,641
to make sure you didn't get into
too much trouble.

754
01:30:26,685 --> 01:30:28,380
Thanks.

755
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,482
Well, it's always wonderful to be of
some assistance to the police.

756
01:30:33,725 --> 01:30:35,249
Are you kidding?

757
01:30:36,962 --> 01:30:39,487
So uh, what's gonna happen to Elliott?

758
01:30:52,277 --> 01:30:53,301
Well?

759
01:30:53,545 --> 01:30:56,412
See there's some men and women too who
think they're born in the wrong body.

760
01:30:56,648 --> 01:30:58,240
They're called transsexuals.

761
01:30:58,483 --> 01:31:01,077
And all they wanna do
is brave their sex changed.

762
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:07,290
How do you do that?

763
01:31:07,692 --> 01:31:11,651
Well, if you're a man that wants to
become a woman, you take female hormones

764
01:31:11,897 --> 01:31:14,024
What do they do?

765
01:31:14,266 --> 01:31:19,135
Well, your skin softens, you grow
breasts and you don't get hard anymore.

766
01:31:22,474 --> 01:31:24,169
Great.

767
01:31:24,576 --> 01:31:26,976
Sure, you wanna know about this?

768
01:31:27,212 --> 01:31:32,172
Yeah... it's giving me some wonderful
new ideas for a science project.

769
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:36,386
I mean, instead of building a computer,
I could build a woman... out of me.

770
01:31:36,621 --> 01:31:40,682
Great idea. In that case,
I'll give you all the details.

771
01:31:41,026 --> 01:31:42,459
The next step is surgery.

772
01:31:42,694 --> 01:31:46,630
A uh... Let me see if I can remember
the exact work Levy told me...

773
01:31:46,865 --> 01:31:48,662
Oh yeah... a appendectomy.

774
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:50,993
Mmm, what's that?

775
01:31:51,236 --> 01:31:56,640
Oh you know. When they take your penis
and slice it down the middle...

776
01:31:56,875 --> 01:31:59,776
yeah, yeah, that's um...
What I thought it was.

777
01:32:00,011 --> 01:32:04,948
Then, um, castration...

778
01:32:05,884 --> 01:32:10,446
Plastic reconstruction & the formation
of an artificial vagina.

779
01:32:10,689 --> 01:32:14,090
A vaginoplasty to those in the know.

780
01:32:16,027 --> 01:32:18,359
And I uh, I thought Elliott just put
on a dress!

781
01:32:18,597 --> 01:32:20,497
Oh he did... and a wig too.

782
01:32:20,732 --> 01:32:23,860
But you see that's no good in bed
when you gotta take everything off.

783
01:32:24,469 --> 01:32:26,369
What's gonna happen to him now?

784
01:32:26,705 --> 01:32:29,173
Well first he has to recover from
the gun wound.

785
01:32:29,407 --> 01:32:32,706
And then if he's ever sane enough to
get out of Bellevue, they'll try him.

786
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:41,050
Right. Something I'm really looking
forward to.

787
01:32:43,355 --> 01:32:47,416
Well, I think I'm going to stick to
my computer.

788
01:32:48,526 --> 01:32:51,552
That sounds like a very good idea.

789
01:32:56,534 --> 01:33:00,834
Look Liz, I gotta get home
and get to work.

790
01:33:02,574 --> 01:33:07,807
I'm gonna miss having you on my tail.
It made me feel kinda safe.

791
01:33:09,014 --> 01:33:12,677
Look, you wanna come home with me?
I'd love the company.

792
01:33:13,785 --> 01:33:15,753
Wouldn't Mike mind?

793
01:33:17,389 --> 01:33:21,382
Well uh, Mike's out of
town on a business trip.

794
01:33:21,926 --> 01:33:23,416
We got plenty of room.

795
01:33:23,662 --> 01:33:27,393
Great! I could sure use the vacation.

796
01:33:28,533 --> 01:33:31,434
Good... good... I'll get the check.

797
01:42:09,921 --> 01:42:14,119
No, no, no...

798
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:16,920
