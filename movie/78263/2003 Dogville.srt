00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,125
The film "DOGVILLE" as told
in nine chapters and a prologue.

2
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:40,125
PROLOGUE (which introduces us
to the town and its residents)

3
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:45,811
<i>This is the sad tale
of the township of Dogville.</i>

4
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:50,897
<i>Dogville was in the Rocky
Mountains in the US of A,</i>

5
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:54,068
<i>up here where the road
came to its definitive end</i>

6
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:57,724
<i>near the entrance to the old
abandoned silver mine.</i>

7
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:01,258
<i>The residents of Dogville
were good honest folks,</i>

8
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,879
<i>and they liked their township.</i>

9
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:06,319
<i>And while a sentimental soul
from the East Coast</i>

10
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:09,132
<i>had once dubbed
their main street Elm Street,</i>

11
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,318
<i>though no elm had ever
cast its shadow in Dogville,</i>

12
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:15,082
<i>they saw no reason
to change anything.</i>

13
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:19,095
<i>Most of the buildings
were pretty wretched,</i>

14
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:21,845
<i>more like shacks, frankly.</i>

15
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:25,108
<i>The house in which Tom lived
was the best, though,</i>

16
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:29,051
<i>and in good times, might almost
have passed for presentable.</i>

17
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:34,294
<i>That afternoon,
the radio was playing softly</i>

18
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:37,861
<i>for in his dotage,
Thomas Edison, Sr.</i>

19
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:41,967
<i>had developed a weakness
for music of the lighter kind.</i>

20
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:45,739
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

21
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:48,971
<i>- the President of the United States.</i>
- <i>My friends...</i>

22
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:51,552
<i>Tom, do me a favor, will you?</i>

23
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:53,806
<i>The radio?</i>

24
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:55,805
Just 'cause the music's over

25
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,072
and you might risk hearing
something useful?

26
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,415
I thought that's
why we had the radio.

27
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:03,381
Well, I need to rest, as you know.

28
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:07,501
Mock me if you like.

29
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:09,906
<i>Tom's father had been a doctor</i>

30
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,039
<i>and now received
a modest pension.</i>

31
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:15,242
<i>So it was no great disaster
for Tom to drift about</i>

32
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:18,105
<i>not doing anything
in particular.</i>

33
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:20,505
<i>Tom was a writer...</i>

34
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,995
<i>at any rate, by his own rights.</i>

35
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:27,321
<i>His output as committed to paper
was so far limited to the words</i>

36
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:29,939
<i>"great" and "small, "</i>

37
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,039
<i>followed by a question mark,</i>

38
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:34,172
<i>but nevertheless
meticulously archived</i>

39
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:37,225
<i>in one of his many
bureau drawers.</i>

40
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,640
Bye, Dad.

41
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:46,939
Evenin', Master Tom!

42
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:49,139
Evening, Master Olivia.

43
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,206
You don't forget
about the meeting tomorrow.

44
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:53,405
No.

45
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,839
<i>In order to postpone the time</i>

46
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:02,381
<i>at which he would have
to put pen to paper in earnest,</i>

47
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:05,811
<i>Tom had now come up
with a series of meetings</i>

48
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:08,306
<i>on moral rearmament,</i>

49
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,178
<i>with which he felt
obliged to benefit the town.</i>

50
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:13,639
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Tom.

51
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:16,639
Evening, Chuck.

52
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:18,705
Will we see you
at the meeting tomorrow?

53
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,039
I could do
without your lectures.

54
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:23,372
You know Vera...

55
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:26,165
wouldn't give me a moment's
peace till I said yes.

56
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,405
<i>Who gave Moses that bone?</i>

57
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:32,606
It's still got meat on it.

58
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,207
Jason did.

59
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,135
Jason gave that mutt
a bone with meat on it?!

60
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,685
When did we last see meat?

61
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,998
Next time you waste good food,
I'll take your knife away.

62
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,662
<i>Ought have known it was you
who was given meat to eat.</i>

63
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,318
<i>Moses is meant to be hungry!
To keep watch.</i>

64
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:50,705
Keep watch in Dogville?

65
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:52,706
What's there to steal?

66
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:55,454
These are wicked times,
Tom Edison.

67
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:59,035
Soon there'll be folks by
with even less than us.

68
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:08,965
<i>indeed, Tom was busy enough,</i>

69
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:11,405
<i>even though,
formally speaking,</i>

70
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:13,995
<i>not yet busy
with writing per Se.</i>

71
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,715
<i>And if a body
found it hard to grasp</i>

72
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,156
<i>what profession he was busy at,</i>

73
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:21,875
<i>he'd merely reply, "mining."</i>

74
00:04:22,274 --> 00:04:25,052
<i>For although he did not blast
his way through rock,</i>

75
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:28,254
<i>he'd blasted
through what was even harder--</i>

76
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:30,705
<i>namely, the human soul,</i>

77
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:33,615
<i>right into where it blistered.</i>

78
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,039
- Hey, Martha.
- Hello, Tom.

79
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:38,508
They're all coming, so you just
have those benches ready.

80
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:40,573
Yes, they're ready.

81
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:43,381
Oh, but Tom, I repeat,
if you need to use my organ,

82
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,878
I got to get special permission
from the regional director.

83
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:50,092
And I repeat,
we don't need the organ.

84
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,757
We can be spiritual without singing
or reading from the Bible.

85
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:56,732
It's almost 7:00,
don't forget your bell now.

86
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:00,573
<i>I imagine that'll do, Ma Ginger.</i>

87
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:03,471
I don't think it's good for the soil
with all that raking and hoeing.

88
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,518
<i>It's the soil
that gave life to us all.</i>

89
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:11,971
Don't give me any of your lip,
Thomas Edison, Jr.

90
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:14,492
I'll hoe as I darn well please.

91
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:17,618
Yeah, and spoil the whole thing.

92
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:19,940
I agree with Tom.

93
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:21,939
Yeah, but he likes eating
my pies, don't you?

94
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:24,341
They're tasty, no doubt about it.

95
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:27,364
So when it comes to hoeing,
who's right, Tom, you or me?

96
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,805
I'm not so sure it's that simple.

97
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:31,607
He's got you there, Ginger.

98
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:34,594
You cannot resist, can you, Gloria?

99
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:37,072
Hey, Ben, I'll get the doors.

100
00:05:37,307 --> 00:05:40,554
- That'll be fine, Tom.
<i>- Any news from the freight industry?</i>

101
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,072
ls everything going
to hell there too?

102
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:45,702
Don't poke fun
at the freight industry.

103
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,772
<i>It was 7:00 precisely</i>

104
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:55,255
<i>as Martha chimed the hour.</i>

105
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:59,537
<i>And Tom was due to play checkers
with his childhood friend Bill Henson.</i>

106
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:03,106
<i>Bill was dumb and knew it.</i>

107
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,471
<i>Far too dumb to qualify
as an engineer,</i>

108
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:08,872
<i>he was certainly sure of that.</i>

109
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:13,151
<i>After listening for a while
to the pile driver down the valley</i>

110
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,775
<i>that Ben insisted was working
on the foundation</i>

111
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,138
<i>of a new penitentiary,</i>

112
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,717
<i>Tom headed for the Henson home
in order to inflict upon Bill</i>

113
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,607
<i>yet another humiliating
defeat at checkers.</i>

114
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,628
<i>Some folks might say
the opportunity</i>

115
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,039
<i>to meet Bill's older sister Liz</i>

116
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,518
<i>was more of a draw
than the checkerboard.</i>

117
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,926
<i>And they might be right.</i>

118
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,962
<i>It was a fact that
in the Henson home</i>

119
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:41,625
<i>lay another horizon,</i>

120
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:45,025
<i>a horizon just as alluring
as the one beyond the valley...</i>

121
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,150
<i>a horizon bound by Liz Henson's
luscious curves...</i>

122
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:55,179
- Nobody's getting it?
<i>- ...a sweet, painful, seductive abyss.</i>

123
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,539
<i>- Hey, Liz.</i>
- Hey, Tom.

124
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,618
<i>Must you come by
every single day?</i>

125
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,806
Hmm?

126
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:05,083
It'd be a lot more fun if somebody
interesting appeared for a change.

127
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:08,005
You know, I really am
so lonesome in this town.

128
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:13,630
<i>The moment my fiancé writes that he's
gotten that job in Boulder, I'm off</i>

129
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:17,244
then the lot of you will have to find
some other girl's skirts to peek up.

130
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:19,373
Is Bill in?

131
00:07:19,374 --> 00:07:21,372
Well, isn't he always?

132
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,712
He studies and I help out
with the glasses,

133
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:27,241
even though everybody knows
that I'm the clever one.

134
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:31,218
<i>- Hey, Mrs. Henson.
- Good evening, Tom.</i>

135
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,639
Checkers time,
Bill ol' buddy!

136
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:38,071
What is that...?

137
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,338
You didn't hear the bell?

138
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:45,643
<i>As usual, Bill tried
to fake his way around actually playing.</i>

139
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:48,352
<i>He had not yet
fully comprehended</i>

140
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:51,424
<i>this meeting business,
he claimed.</i>

141
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:53,872
Maybe you should just let them be.

142
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,630
- I don't think so. I--
- What if they're just fine as they are?

143
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,605
You think they're fine?
I don't think so.

144
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:03,115
I think there is a lot
this country's forgotten.

145
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:06,541
I just try to refresh folks' memories
by way of illustration.

146
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,038
<i>So the illustration for tomorrow...</i>

147
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:12,105
I don't know.

148
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:16,871
See, if the people of Dogville
have a problem with acceptance,

149
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,858
what I really need is
something for them to accept.

150
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,708
Something tangible, like a gift.

151
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:28,668
Why in the heck would someone
up and give us a gift?

152
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,873
I don't know.

153
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:33,011
I'm gonna have
to do some thinking.

154
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:35,372
Wait, wait, wait-<i>--</i>

155
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,472
We're missing a piece.

156
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:42,739
We won't be able to play.

157
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,838
My mind is sharp tonight.

158
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:07,971
Night, Bill.

159
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:21,125
CHAPTER ONE in which Tom
hears gunfire and meets Grace.

160
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:25,834
<i>Despite considerable effort
on his part to prolong things,</i>

161
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,146
<i>Tom had achieved the triumph
of the checkerboard pretty quickly.</i>

162
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,898
<i>It had started to rain, and the wind
had become a regular gale</i>

163
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,474
<i>when Tom strolled home
through Elm Street.</i>

164
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:39,971
<i>If Tom were to prove</i>

165
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,628
<i>that the citizens of Dogville
had a problem receiving</i>

166
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,038
<i>in his lecture the next day,</i>

167
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:47,261
<i>he sorely lacked an illustration--</i>

168
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:49,240
<i>a gift.</i>

169
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,378
<i>Bill might have been right.</i>

170
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:55,337
<i>It hadn't exactly rained gifts
on this particular township.</i>

171
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:36,431
<i>There was no doubt in his mind.</i>

172
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:38,921
<i>They were gunshots.</i>

173
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:42,431
<i>The pile driver in the marshes
didn't sound like that at all.</i>

174
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,938
<i>The shots had come
from down in the valley,</i>

175
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,106
<i>or perhaps from Canyon Road,</i>

176
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:49,215
<i>some place in the direction
of Georgetown.</i>

177
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:55,057
<i>He listened for more shots for ages,</i>

178
00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:57,592
<i>but they were not repeated.</i>

179
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,238
<i>A tad disappointed,</i>

180
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,207
<i>Tom sat down
on the old ladies' bench to think,</i>

181
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:08,691
<i>to hang on to the feeling
of danger for a moment.</i>

182
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,448
<i>But it wasn't long
before his thoughts</i>

183
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,178
<i>were back on his favorite
subjects again.</i>

184
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,592
<i>And in the midst of the storm,
they metamorphosed</i>

185
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,938
<i>into articles and novels,</i>

186
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:22,914
<i>and great gatherings
that'd listen in silence to Tom</i>

187
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:25,861
<i>after the publication
of yet another volume</i>

188
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:29,081
<i>that scourged and purged
the human soul.</i>

189
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:33,761
<i>And he saw men-- and among them
even other writers--</i>

190
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:36,382
<i>throw their arms
around one another</i>

191
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:40,247
<i>as, through his words,
life had opened up for them anew.</i>

192
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:43,871
<i>It hadn't been easy.</i>

193
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:47,000
<i>But by his diligence and application
to narrative and drama,</i>

194
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,434
<i>his message had gotten through.</i>

195
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:53,015
<i>And asked about his technique,</i>

196
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:55,831
<i>he would have to say
but one word:</i>

197
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,639
<i>"illustration."</i>

198
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:21,624
<i>Tom could have spent another
half hour or more on the bench,</i>

199
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,688
<i>but another unusual noise
roused him.</i>

200
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:27,914
<i>It was Moses barking.</i>

201
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,742
<i>Oh, that wasn't
unusual in itself,</i>

202
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,628
<i>but it was the way
he barked that was new.</i>

203
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,038
<i>His barking was not loud,</i>

204
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:39,664
<i>but more of a snarl, as if the danger
was quite close at hand</i>

205
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:43,484
<i>and not merely
a passing raccoon or fox,</i>

206
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:46,994
<i>as if the dog was
standing face to face</i>

207
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:51,130
<i>with a force
to be taken seriously.</i>

208
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:53,705
<i>Hey, lady!</i>

209
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,105
<i>I wouldn't go up there
if I were you.</i>

210
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,685
<i>I know the mountain well.</i>

211
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,528
<i>I doubt if I'd get away
with my life.</i>

212
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,938
It's a very nasty drop.

213
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,888
Is there another way?

214
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:17,272
<i>Yeah.</i>

215
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,438
Where?

216
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,618
Back down the way
you came from,

217
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:26,971
back down to Georgetown.

218
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,839
Why do you need
to get up the mountain?

219
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,858
Did it have anything to do
with those gunshots?

220
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:41,291
Help me!
Help me, please.

221
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:44,191
Hide in the mine. In there.

222
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:55,272
Where is this road headed to?

223
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:57,206
Nowhere.
It's a dead end.

224
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,575
If you want the pass,
you'll have to turn around,

225
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,779
go back by way of Georgetown.
This place, it's called Dogville.

226
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:05,773
- Dogville?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

227
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,771
It figures. A stupid name
if I ever heard one.

228
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:12,130
- Hey, we're looking for somebody.
- Really? Who might that be?

229
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,787
My boss wants to talk to you.

230
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,225
- Young man?
- Yes, sir?

231
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:22,572
I'm looking for a girl.

232
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,757
<i>She may have made her way
to your town in her confusion.</i>

233
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,238
<i>I don't want any harm
to come to her.</i>

234
00:14:28,374 --> 00:14:30,542
<i>She's very precious to me.</i>

235
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:32,839
Well, sir...

236
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,237
nobody's been through Dogville.
Moses would have barked.

237
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,840
- He's very suspicious of strangers.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

238
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,827
<i>That's very wise of Moses.</i>

239
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,006
Please take my card...

240
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:48,104
and if perhaps you see a stranger,

241
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,793
then give me a call.

242
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,404
<i>I am in a position
to offer a considerable reward.</i>

243
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,925
Yes, sir. Thank you.

244
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,971
Was it you that fired those shots?

245
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,538
Well, they're gone.

246
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:22,141
<i>You want to come out now?</i>

247
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,448
You want a cup of coffee
before you go mountain climbing?

248
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:40,401
<i>- Yeah?
-</i> That'd be nice.

249
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,586
<i>The beautiful
fugitive's name was Grace.</i>

250
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:50,535
<i>She hadn't chosen Dogville
from a map</i>

251
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,988
<i>or sought out
the township for a visit.</i>

252
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,616
<i>Yet Tom felt right away
that she belonged.</i>

253
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:00,105
Shall I take the bone?

254
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:08,693
<i>She could have kept
her vulnerability to herself,</i>

255
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:13,009
<i>but she had elected to give
herself up to him at random...</i>

256
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:18,143
<i>as-- yes-- a gift.</i>

257
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:20,605
<i>"Generous,</i>

258
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,714
<i>very generous, "
thought Tom.</i>

259
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:25,071
Do you want to eat?

260
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:31,057
- You must be hungry--
- I can't.

261
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,438
I don't deserve that bread.

262
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,938
<i>I stole that bone.</i>

263
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,557
I'd never stolen anything before.

264
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,597
So now--
now I have to punish myself.

265
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,516
<i>I was raised to be arrogant.</i>

266
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:52,230
So, I... I had to teach myself
these things.

267
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,248
Well...

268
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:58,914
it may be best
for your education...

269
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:02,771
but, Grace, in this town,

270
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,771
in these times...

271
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,834
it's very impolite not to eat
what's set before you.

272
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,907
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

273
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,818
<i>Who were the men
in the car?</i>

274
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,171
Why would they want
to hurt you?

275
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,597
The man in the back of the car,
he's the boss.

276
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,005
I saw his face.

277
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,315
He gave me
his telephone number,

278
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:43,724
told me to call if I saw you.

279
00:17:44,073 --> 00:17:46,071
I'm sure he'd offer you
a big reward

280
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,272
if you told him where I was.

281
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:50,372
Yeah.

282
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,214
- Where is your family?
<i>- I don't have a family.</i>

283
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,828
All I had was a father.

284
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,067
Those gangsters
took him away from me.

285
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,437
What if I said you could stay here?

286
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,377
Here? Even if you meant it,
it's impossible.

287
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:19,817
It's a very small town.

288
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:23,453
I have to hide.
People will ask questions.

289
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:27,429
That might not matter,
not if they all wanted to help you too.

290
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,847
Are you saying that everybody
in this town is like you?

291
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:34,272
They're good people.

292
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:36,437
They're honest people.

293
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:39,214
<i>They've all been
in need themselves.</i>

294
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,918
They might well
turn you down, but...

295
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:45,941
I think it'd be worth
the trouble to ask.

296
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,417
<i>But I've got nothing
to offer them in return.</i>

297
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:51,430
<i>No, I think you have plenty
to offer Dogville.</i>

298
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,660
<i>To call the mood
of the audience at Tom's moral lecture</i>

299
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:06,414
<i>in the mission house
the next day "enthusiastic"</i>

300
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:09,084
<i>would have been going too far.</i>

301
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:11,339
<i>But they had come,</i>

302
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,587
<i>and Tom had launched
himself fearlessly</i>

303
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:18,099
<i>into his endeavor to illustrate
the human problem-- to receive.</i>

304
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,138
<i>The subject was obvious...</i>

305
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:28,466
<i>but quite dreadfully ill-considered
by this young man.</i>

306
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:31,141
<i>To compensate
for his lack of preparation,</i>

307
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:34,164
<i>Tom made diligent use
of his technique of lashing out</i>

308
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:38,113
<i>somewhat haphazardly
in all directions.</i>

309
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:42,040
<i>His father peered around covertly
to gauge the mood,</i>

310
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:44,941
<i>and sensing that the assembly
was not entirely happy</i>

311
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,447
<i>with his rather direct criticism,</i>

312
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:50,294
<i>he decided to forestall any protests.</i>

313
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:53,393
I'm sure that
you wish us well, Tom.

314
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,888
But, of any town,

315
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,366
I believe this one has
a very fine sense of community.

316
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:02,041
Living side by side,
we all know one another.

317
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:04,544
I'm a pretty fair judge
of character myself.

318
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:07,045
Honestly, Tom,
you've done it again!

319
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,984
Made us come here to listen
to a lot of nonsense.

320
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:12,804
What do you think you are,
some kind of philosopher?

321
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:16,603
- Observant, that's what I am.
- Lazy, I would say.

322
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,138
We shovel snow together.

323
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,417
- You shovel snow together?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

324
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:23,944
Every household clears
their own front walk!

325
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,854
I got to allow
that Tom's right on that.

326
00:20:27,273 --> 00:20:29,521
<i>- The roads don't get cleared proper--
-</i> Shh!

327
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:34,470
I'm sorry, Tom, you'll have to come up
with something better than that.

328
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,188
The whole country
would be better served

329
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:40,260
with a greater attitude
of openness and acceptance.

330
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,724
You're not suggesting
we all wouldn't help out

331
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:45,241
- if somebody needed help?
<i>- No, that's not the point.</i>

332
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:49,233
- We care for human beings up here!
- We'll probably never find out.

333
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:57,773
Since nobody seems to want
to admit that there is a problem...

334
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:02,371
let me illustrate.

335
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:07,483
I'm not going to use something
that's already happened.

336
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,207
<i>I'm going to use something
that's just about to happen.</i>

337
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:18,921
<i>And after providing
a quick summary of the events</i>

338
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:22,027
<i>of the previous evening
to the astonished people of Dogville,</i>

339
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:24,751
<i>Tom went down to the mine</i>

340
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,296
<i>to retrieve the fugitive
from her hideaway.</i>

341
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:38,371
Allow me to introduce Grace.

342
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:40,605
Grace, these are the...

343
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:42,604
citizens of Dogville.

344
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:44,871
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

345
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,831
Tom has told us
about your predicament, miss.

346
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,577
I really don't want to put
any of you in jeopardy.

347
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:57,629
Why don't you just go to the police?
They can take care of gangsters.

348
00:21:58,206 --> 00:22:02,562
- It's their job.
- I don't know that that's a good idea.

349
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,577
- In the transportation business-<i>-
- Ben!</i>

350
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:09,689
These men, they have
powerful connections...

351
00:22:12,273 --> 00:22:14,271
even with the police.

352
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:16,764
You think we should give
sanctuary to a fugitive?

353
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:19,540
A fugitive that gangsters
want to get a hold of?

354
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,938
Well, that would put us
in a pretty pickle--

355
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:24,238
Easy, Claire,
think of your asthma.

356
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:26,787
<i>Dogville's a good place
to hide, that's for certain.</i>

357
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:30,223
Exactly. The only way up here
is Canyon Road.

358
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:34,602
<i>That could easily be watched by
Ma Ginger's-- excuse me-- nosey cousin</i>

359
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,204
<i>who lives only yards
from the turnoff.</i>

360
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:40,091
<i>She has a telephone.
Martha, you could ring the bell,</i>

361
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,537
<i>tell the town
if people were coming.</i>

362
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:46,271
But, Tom, I chime the hours.

363
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,767
What if people get confused
with all the ringing?

364
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:51,750
Come now, Martha.
Surely we can use our old bell

365
00:22:52,172 --> 00:22:54,600
to save a life if need be.

366
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,634
<i>- Why should we?</i>
- Because we care, Chuck.

367
00:22:58,073 --> 00:23:00,560
- We care for human beings.
- That ain't what I mean.

368
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,307
How do we know this woman
is telling us the truth?

369
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:06,704
Maybe these gangsters
did shoot at her.

370
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,905
That don't make her
somebody to be trusted.

371
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:11,071
He's right.

372
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:15,154
Why would you trust me?

373
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:19,046
- I trust you.
- Tom, we're not gangsters.

374
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,684
We mind our own business.

375
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,617
We don't ask nothing
from nobody.

376
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:29,934
- So at last you admit it?
- If only there was some way

377
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:32,804
that we wouldn't doubt
the young lady's word,

378
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:36,543
<i>some way to know her,
then I think we'd all ignore the risk.</i>

379
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:41,093
<i>There is a way.
You said it yourself--</i>

380
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:44,493
by living side by side
with her.

381
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:47,160
<i>Dad, you're such a fine
judge of character.</i>

382
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:50,576
How long would it take a man
like you to unmask her?

383
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:53,070
A week?

384
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:55,105
Maybe two?

385
00:23:55,106 --> 00:23:57,324
Surely we can offer her
two weeks!

386
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:02,000
And if after that time, so much
as one man cries out, <i>"</i>Be gone!<i>"</i>

387
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:05,523
I promise I'll happily
send her packing myself.

388
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,777
Well, if Master Tom think
this is right for us,

389
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:19,317
and for the community, then,

390
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:21,671
that'll do for me.

391
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:24,480
He might be young,
but his heart is right.

392
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:28,243
And I've known his heart
for as long as it's been beating.

393
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:41,633
<i>No more words were spoken at
the town meeting in the mission house.</i>

394
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,950
<i>But it had been decided,
they all felt,</i>

395
00:24:45,406 --> 00:24:48,013
<i>that the fugitive would be
given two weeks.</i>

396
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:51,156
<i>And they would all be able
to look at themselves in the mirror</i>

397
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:54,213
<i>and know that they had done
what they could indeed,</i>

398
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,917
<i>and perhaps more
than most people would have done.</i>

399
00:25:00,606 --> 00:25:02,684
<i>So, that very afternoon,</i>

400
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,347
<i>Tom took Grace on a stroll
down Elm Street</i>

401
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,837
<i>to introduce her
to the town he loved.</i>

402
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:11,996
Well, this is where...

403
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:15,216
Olivia and June live.
June's a cripple.

404
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:19,709
<i>They live here as a token
of my dad's broad-mindedness.</i>

405
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:23,466
<i>Chuck and Vera, they have seven children
and they hate each other.</i>

406
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:26,050
<i>Next door, we have the Hensons.</i>

407
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:29,653
They make a living from grinding
the edges off cheap glasses

408
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:32,340
to try and make
them look expensive.

409
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:35,363
Moving on we have Jack McKay.

410
00:25:35,806 --> 00:25:38,113
Jack McKay, he's blind
and the whole town knows it,

411
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:42,452
but he thinks he can hide it
by never leaving his house.

412
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:45,090
In the old stable,
Ben keeps his truck.

413
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:49,035
He drinks, and he visits
the whorehouse...

414
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:52,003
once a month,
and he's ashamed of it.

415
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:54,484
Martha, she runs
the mission house

416
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,838
<i>until the new preacher comes,</i>

417
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,938
which will just never happen.

418
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:03,466
And that leaves
Ma Ginger and Gloria.

419
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:06,490
<i>They run this really
expensive store</i>

420
00:26:06,907 --> 00:26:10,803
where they exploit the fact
that nobody leaves town.

421
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:13,404
We used to leave to go vote,

422
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,313
but since they put in
the registration fee--

423
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,758
it's about a day's
wages for these people--

424
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:21,564
Dogville didn't feel
the democratic need anymore.

425
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:29,199
<i>Those awful figurines say more
about the people in this town</i>

426
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:32,013
<i>- than many words.</i>
- If this is the town that you love,

427
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:34,404
then you really have
a strange way of showing it.

428
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:39,490
All I see is...

429
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:43,216
a beautiful little town
in the midst of...

430
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,017
magnificent mountains.

431
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:50,650
A place where people
have hopes and dreams...

432
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:55,457
even under the hardest conditions.

433
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:01,405
<i>And seven figurines
that are not awful at all.</i>

434
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:07,400
<i>Calling Dogville beautiful
was original at least.</i>

435
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:11,687
<i>Grace was just casting
one more look at the figurines</i>

436
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:15,676
<i>she herself would have dismissed
as tasteless a few days earlier,</i>

437
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,237
<i>when she suddenly sensed</i>

438
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:20,554
<i>what would best
have been described</i>

439
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,804
<i>as a tiny change of light
over Dogville.</i>

440
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:49,374
<i>They're keeping an eye on you.</i>

441
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:51,771
<i>If you love them already,</i>

442
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:54,254
<i>they might need a little persuading.</i>

443
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:59,073
We've got two weeks
to get them to accept you.

444
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:02,995
You make it sound
like we're playing a game.

445
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,537
Well, yes...

446
00:28:05,773 --> 00:28:07,771
we are.

447
00:28:08,273 --> 00:28:10,990
Isn't saving your life
worth a little game?

448
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,456
- What do you want me to do?
- Do you mind physical labor?

449
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:19,070
No.

450
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,377
Dogville offered you two weeks.

451
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:25,504
Now you offer them.

452
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:39,125
CHAPTER TWO in which Grace follows Tom's
plan and embarks upon physical labour.

453
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:44,009
<i>The next day was
a beautiful day in Dogville.</i>

454
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:47,056
<i>The tender leaves on Ma Ginger's
gooseberry bushes</i>

455
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:50,280
<i>were unfurling despite
wise Tom's misgivings</i>

456
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,877
<i>as regards her gardening methods.</i>

457
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,237
<i>But more than that,</i>

458
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:57,404
<i>this first day of spring</i>

459
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:01,665
<i>had also been picked to be
Grace's first-ever day of work,</i>

460
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:05,323
<i>the day in which she was
to set off around Dogville</i>

461
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:09,172
<i>and offer herself
one hour per household per day.</i>

462
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,704
Excuse me.

463
00:29:14,273 --> 00:29:16,411
I'd like to offer you my help.

464
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:18,770
If there's anything
that you need...

465
00:29:20,406 --> 00:29:22,138
Yeah...

466
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:24,217
a carburetor that don't leak.

467
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:29,790
All right, here.
Let me take that.

468
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:33,273
Maybe I could help
around your home.

469
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,550
I don't really have a home, miss.

470
00:29:39,273 --> 00:29:42,290
- Just the garage.
- Oh.

471
00:29:42,772 --> 00:29:45,640
I'm in the freight business.
The road's my home.

472
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:48,038
I'm ready.
Good morning.

473
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,257
Miss Olivia's got a home.

474
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,886
She's looking to help out
in somebody's home.

475
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:57,623
A cleaning lady for a cleaning lady?!

476
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:00,137
You be talking nonsense, Mr. Ben.

477
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:03,541
- Have a good day.
<i>- All right.</i>

478
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:05,904
<i>See you later on.</i>

479
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:09,643
<i>And off Ben went
to Georgetown with the weekly shipment</i>

480
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:12,946
<i>of glasses that Mr. Henson had
so laboriously cleansed</i>

481
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:16,912
<i>with his polisher of any trace
of their cheap manufacture.</i>

482
00:30:21,306 --> 00:30:23,304
<i>So Grace turned into the alley,</i>

483
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:27,322
<i>which went by the exotic name
"Glunen Street"...</i>

484
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:33,335
<i>...to knock on the door of the blind,
but only too vain, man.</i>

485
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,638
Yes?

486
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:40,839
Good morning, Mr. McKay.
My name is Grace.

487
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,902
I was wondering if there's
anything I can do for you.

488
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:49,060
Oh, that's very kind
of you, Grace, but--

489
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,471
<i>I was thinking that perhaps
because of...</i>

490
00:30:51,772 --> 00:30:54,230
the situation that you're in...

491
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,297
What situation am I in?

492
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,737
<i>Ummm...</i>

493
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:02,205
you're...

494
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:05,133
you're on... your own.

495
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:08,970
Oh...

496
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:12,080
I've been on my own
for so long.

497
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:14,903
Anything that you might need?

498
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:18,038
I'm sorry.

499
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,196
Have you ever noticed
the wooden spire

500
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:24,333
on the roof of the mission house?

501
00:31:24,772 --> 00:31:27,460
At 5:00 in the afternoon,

502
00:31:27,906 --> 00:31:31,473
it points a shadow
at Ginger's grocery store,

503
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,756
right at the "O"

504
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:38,513
in "Open" on the sign
in the window.

505
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:43,712
Maybe it's telling people that
it's time to go shopping for supper.

506
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:47,773
Goodbye, Mr. McKay.

507
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,272
Goodbye, Grace.

508
00:31:51,273 --> 00:31:53,381
<i>Grace's interview
with Jack McKay</i>

509
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:57,106
<i>proved sadly symptomatic
of the attitude in Dogville--</i>

510
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:59,857
<i>reserved but friendly,</i>

511
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:02,517
<i>not without curiosity.</i>

512
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,644
<i>Only Jack had expressed his "no"
concisely and precisely.</i>

513
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:12,053
<i>Martha needed a monologue
almost an hour long</i>

514
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:14,504
<i>to arrive at the same conclusion.</i>

515
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:16,990
Oh my goodness.
I-- I-- I'd have to think

516
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:20,000
of work for you to do, because
I barely have enough work myself.

517
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:24,093
<i>So, not very much later,
Grace had ended up</i>

518
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:26,553
<i>next to Ma Ginger's
gooseberry bushes</i>

519
00:32:26,906 --> 00:32:29,923
<i>in a mood that was not
particularly good.</i>

520
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:34,403
<i>She could not tell
a gooseberry bush from a cactus,</i>

521
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:37,589
<i>but the meticulous order
in the yard appealed to her,</i>

522
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,377
<i>such as the metal chains
placed there</i>

523
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,790
<i>in order to shield
the second and third bushes</i>

524
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:45,137
<i>lest anybody decided
to make use</i>

525
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:49,245
<i>of the deplorably time-honored
shortcut to the old lady's bench.</i>

526
00:32:49,872 --> 00:32:52,240
<i>Grace pulled herself together</i>

527
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,687
<i>and headed towards the store.</i>

528
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:00,394
- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

529
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,490
Hello. We don't need
any help here either.

530
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:05,937
<i>I told that to Tom.</i>

531
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:08,170
Well, it doesn't matter anyway

532
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:10,337
because there's nothing I can do.

533
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:12,536
I've never worked
a day in my life, so...

534
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:19,796
You know, if you put some aloe
on those hands of yours,

535
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:22,205
<i>they'll be better by the morning.</i>

536
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:24,204
It's the wood shavings.

537
00:33:24,406 --> 00:33:26,404
I really do hate them.

538
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,583
But I do believe
I'll take your advice.

539
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:32,896
Your hands are surely the most
alabaster hands I've ever seen.

540
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:35,560
Here comes Tom.
How lucky we are!

541
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:39,486
- Hi, all. Liz.
<i>- Hello, Tom.</i>

542
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,472
Grace.

543
00:33:41,473 --> 00:33:44,280
- How is all going?
- Not very well, I'm afraid.

544
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:47,197
<i>- Really?
-</i> No. Nobody needs any help.

545
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,603
Well, I thought
that might be the case.

546
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:52,274
His plan to make
everybody like me

547
00:33:52,672 --> 00:33:54,670
has run into a few problems

548
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:56,937
because nobody wants me
to work for them.

549
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:59,866
I would really like to offer
something in return.

550
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,027
<i>You're all running a terrible risk
having me here...</i>

551
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:08,305
I mean, I'm willing to learn.

552
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:10,763
There must be somebody
who needs help.

553
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:14,009
- Mr. McKay's sight is not so good--
- Yes, I went to Mr. McKay.

554
00:34:14,472 --> 00:34:17,160
I went to Martha
and to Chuck and Vera's,

555
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:19,603
and nobody seems to need any help.

556
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:22,799
<i>They all think everyone else needs
something, and not themselves.</i>

557
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:25,271
Funny, that's exactly
what Tom said!

558
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:27,970
- I suppose he's pleased.
- Well...

559
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:31,240
Just to prove him wrong...

560
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:34,333
maybe you can lend a hand here.

561
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,929
But, Ginger, there really isn't
anything we need done.

562
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:40,986
<i>Perhaps there's something
you don't need doing.</i>

563
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:43,683
- Anything we don't need done?
<i>- Something--</i>

564
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:46,070
something that
you would like done,

565
00:34:46,206 --> 00:34:48,723
but that you don't think
is necessary.

566
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,137
What on earth would that be?

567
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:53,371
<i>Maybe
the gooseberry bushes?</i>

568
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:56,120
The gooseberries are
just fine. Thank you very much.

569
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:59,755
Not yours. The one that planted
themselves in the tall grass?

570
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:02,381
<i>We don't grow anything there.</i>

571
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,437
Exactly.

572
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:06,436
A bit of tidying up.

573
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:08,272
Who knows,

574
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,271
those bushes might
one day bear fruit.

575
00:35:10,572 --> 00:35:13,789
<i>Yeah, that's true.
That's true. Who knows?</i>

576
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:16,304
All right, girl.

577
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:18,706
Those alabaster hands of yours

578
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:22,668
are hereby engaged to weed
the wild gooseberry bushes.

579
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,171
<i>There you go.</i>

580
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:27,170
Thank you.

581
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:29,005
Around...

582
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:31,004
like this, you see?

583
00:35:31,306 --> 00:35:33,933
<i>Anything too close to them,
just be careful.</i>

584
00:35:34,372 --> 00:35:36,205
There you-- oh!

585
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:38,893
<i>After a few of the wild
little gooseberry bushes</i>

586
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:41,357
<i>had given up the ghost
in the care</i>

587
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:44,602
<i>of Grace's as yet unpracticed
alabaster hands,</i>

588
00:35:45,072 --> 00:35:47,260
<i>things began looking up
with the weeding...</i>

589
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,637
- Quick study.
<i>- ...and the town.</i>

590
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:54,702
<i>In fact, it turned out,
there were not so few things</i>

591
00:35:55,206 --> 00:35:58,982
<i>that the other townsfolk of Dogville
didn't need doing either.</i>

592
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:02,536
<i>As Ben had no home,</i>

593
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:06,471
<i>Grace's domestic experiments were
absolutely things he didn't need,</i>

594
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:10,698
<i>but he put up with them anyhow,
appearing with astonishing punctuality</i>

595
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:13,520
<i>when the act of domesticity
had been completed,</i>

596
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,904
<i>no matter how unpredictable
business hours</i>

597
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:19,375
<i>in the freight industry
might otherwise have been.</i>

598
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:27,152
<i>Olivia didn't need anyone to help June
to the toilet while she was at work,</i>

599
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:30,233
<i>as hitherto
they had coped splendidly</i>

600
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,187
<i>with Olivia's excellent
diaper arrangement.</i>

601
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:38,582
<i>If Jack McKay had needed
a partner for conversation,</i>

602
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,515
<i>he would surely have gone out
and gotten one for himself in the town.</i>

603
00:36:43,072 --> 00:36:46,528
<i>So, it was not out of need
that he allowed Grace to sit with him</i>

604
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:50,229
<i>in his dark parlor with the dramatic
drapes on one wall</i>

605
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:53,666
<i>for lengthy discussions regarding
the underestimated qualities</i>

606
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:56,386
<i>of the light on the East Coast.</i>

607
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:01,292
<i>As Martha wouldn't dream
of burdening the parish</i>

608
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:04,227
<i>with wear and tear
of the pedals and bellows</i>

609
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,947
<i>while waiting for a new
priest to be appointed,</i>

610
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:09,966
<i>she practiced without a note
ever leaving the organ.</i>

611
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:12,403
<i>And was therefore
not really in need</i>

612
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,167
<i>of anyone to turn her pages.</i>

613
00:37:15,572 --> 00:37:17,570
<i>And God knows</i>

614
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:21,745
<i>that Mr. and Mrs. Henson's son
did not need any help with his books,</i>

615
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:26,239
<i>and that the family had taken Grace in
for her own sake.</i>

616
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:28,917
My hands are getting
much better.

617
00:37:29,272 --> 00:37:31,270
Yes!

618
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,947
<i>And although
Liz's hands had improved</i>

619
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:36,238
<i>through Grace's good counsel,</i>

620
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:39,835
<i>Thomas Edison was a doctor,
and of indisputable health.</i>

621
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:42,403
<i>And he did not need
care or help</i>

622
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:45,572
<i>with the pills from the medicine
closet with its many secrets.</i>

623
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:54,105
<i>Actually, Chuck was the only one
"not yet hooked, " as Tom put it.</i>

624
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,703
<i>- Hooked?</i>
- Hooked.

625
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:58,843
You sound so arrogant.

626
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:01,204
<i>Arrogance is the worst thing!</i>

627
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:03,536
He doesn't like me.

628
00:38:05,305 --> 00:38:07,303
And he has every right
to feel that way.

629
00:38:07,438 --> 00:38:09,576
<i>Yeah. Listen...</i>

630
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:13,535
luckily, I've prepared
a Trojan horse.

631
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:16,104
- A what?
<i>- A Trojan horse.</i>

632
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:18,170
<i>We can get in by way of Vera.</i>

633
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:22,271
There's this lecture tomorrow
in Georgetown...

634
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:25,683
given by some professor.

635
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:30,145
It's some intellectual thing...

636
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:34,366
but not so intellectual
he can't tour the provinces with it.

637
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:38,201
Anyway, the point is,
Vera, she'd do anything to go.

638
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:41,396
<i>But she's got no one to mind
Achilles while she's gone.</i>

639
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,766
<i>She trusts the girls mastering
their iambic pentameters,</i>

640
00:38:45,238 --> 00:38:47,426
but not with the little one.

641
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:50,202
So this is where you come in--
I said that you

642
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:52,603
would watch him
tomorrow afternoon.

643
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,915
Now, I'll try and stall her
on her way home.

644
00:38:57,572 --> 00:38:59,880
With a bit of luck, Chuck
will get back before she does

645
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:02,580
and you can use the time
and all of your charm

646
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:04,970
<i>to try and win him over.</i>

647
00:39:04,972 --> 00:39:07,839
I will happily mind Achilles
if Vera will let me.

648
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,143
But if he doesn't like me,
he doesn't like me.

649
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:17,691
<i>Tom really was enchanted
by this unusual, mysterious creature.</i>

650
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:21,033
<i>And even though she did not
satisfy his curiosity</i>

651
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:23,720
<i>by saying anything
about her past,</i>

652
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:26,183
<i>so as not to put anyone
in danger,</i>

653
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,536
<i>she still fitted Tom's mission</i>

654
00:39:28,572 --> 00:39:32,728
<i>to educate Dogville on the subject
of acceptance like a glove.</i>

655
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,370
<i>Tom felt content.</i>

656
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,216
<i>Grace had been dangling
over the edge,</i>

657
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,416
<i>and he had been the one
to pull her back onto the path.</i>

658
00:39:41,872 --> 00:39:44,679
<i>It gave him a fine
sensation of mastery,</i>

659
00:39:45,138 --> 00:39:47,976
<i>new for him in terms
of the opposite sex.</i>

660
00:39:48,438 --> 00:39:52,304
<i>And his feelings unleashed
the best in his burgeoning love.</i>

661
00:40:03,572 --> 00:40:04,938
<i>Hello.</i>

662
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:07,546
- This is Dahlia...
- Mmm-mm.

663
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,139
...Olympia, Diana,

664
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:12,553
Athena, Pandora,

665
00:40:12,906 --> 00:40:14,904
<i>Jason, Achilles.</i>

666
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,203
Go play.

667
00:40:19,906 --> 00:40:21,871
Your children are lovely.

668
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:24,089
They are good kids.

669
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:26,470
Mmm.

670
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:28,637
And I love them.

671
00:40:33,772 --> 00:40:36,229
<i>Please don't say such
nice things about the kids.</i>

672
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,827
I cry too easily...

673
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:44,342
both in sorrow and in joy.

674
00:40:44,872 --> 00:40:47,040
<i>- Okay, Vera.
- Oh, hi.</i>

675
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,403
- Ready to go?
<i>- I'm ready.</i>

676
00:40:49,538 --> 00:40:51,676
<i>Thanks
for leaving the map out.</i>

677
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:54,037
I'd have probably
forgot it, I'm sure.

678
00:40:54,105 --> 00:40:55,971
How did you know
I was going that far?

679
00:40:55,972 --> 00:40:58,309
Last time I saw the thermos,

680
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:00,893
it was on the doorstep
and the map was beside it,

681
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:03,270
so I just thought...

682
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:06,082
when I saw the thermos this time
and no map that--

683
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:10,503
You're a sweet girl, Grace.

684
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,522
- Sweet as Miss Laura.
- Who's Miss Laura?

685
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,970
You gave yourself away again, Bill.

686
00:41:17,105 --> 00:41:21,461
I think Miss Laura is
what Ovid might call a Maenad.

687
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:25,136
Oh.

688
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:28,904
<i>Don't be ashamed, Ben.</i>

689
00:41:30,038 --> 00:41:32,846
We all have the right
to make the most of our lives.

690
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:35,413
I'm sure that those ladies
in those houses,

691
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:38,379
they bring a lot of joy
to a lot of men.

692
00:41:40,138 --> 00:41:42,136
Ain't nothing I'm proud of.

693
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:46,503
It really ain't.

694
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:50,236
<i>It's all right.</i>

695
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:05,883
I know what you're doing here.

696
00:42:07,272 --> 00:42:09,270
You do?

697
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:12,003
You want people to like you...

698
00:42:12,338 --> 00:42:14,336
so you don't have to go away.

699
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,270
You're very smart.

700
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:22,470
Yes, I like it here in Dogville.

701
00:42:22,805 --> 00:42:26,111
So you want me to read to you

702
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,637
<i>about the Cyclops?</i>

703
00:42:28,906 --> 00:42:31,513
I don't like the Cyclops.

704
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:35,169
Two eyes are prettier.

705
00:42:37,572 --> 00:42:39,570
Like yours.

706
00:42:43,805 --> 00:42:46,961
If you want my ma to like you
and let you stay,

707
00:42:47,472 --> 00:42:49,810
you just have to be nice to me.

708
00:42:52,538 --> 00:42:54,846
Maybe you should help me
clean up instead.

709
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:57,866
<i>- Come on.</i>
- My ma says I don't have to work.

710
00:42:58,305 --> 00:43:02,661
- Except in my head.
- But what about if I ask you?

711
00:43:03,338 --> 00:43:05,104
Please?

712
00:43:05,105 --> 00:43:07,103
Okay.

713
00:43:19,438 --> 00:43:21,404
What are you doing here?

714
00:43:21,405 --> 00:43:23,893
<i>Didn't I tell you
we don't need no help from you?</i>

715
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:26,962
- Ma asked her to mind me and Achilles--<i>
- <i>Quiet! Get out,</i>

716
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,403
the lot of you.

717
00:43:32,205 --> 00:43:34,373
<i>Same nonsense.</i>

718
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:37,316
<i>They'd have done just great
in antiquity, no doubt.</i>

719
00:43:38,705 --> 00:43:42,181
How's it going otherwise,
with the fooling act?

720
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:47,969
I wasn't trying to fool anyone.

721
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:52,432
I mean Dogville.
Has it got you fooled yet?

722
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:59,382
I thought you were implying
that I was trying to exploit the town.

723
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:02,306
Oh, wishful thinking.

724
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:06,471
This town is rotten...

725
00:44:06,472 --> 00:44:08,470
<i>from the inside out.</i>

726
00:44:08,505 --> 00:44:11,052
<i>Wouldn't miss it
if it fell into the gorge tomorrow.</i>

727
00:44:12,438 --> 00:44:14,436
<i>I see no charm here.</i>

728
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,837
You seem to.

729
00:44:20,772 --> 00:44:22,939
<i>Admit it,
you've fallen for Dogville.</i>

730
00:44:25,105 --> 00:44:27,123
The trees, the mountains...

731
00:44:27,472 --> 00:44:29,371
<i>the simple folk,</i>

732
00:44:29,372 --> 00:44:32,828
if all that ain't got you fooled yet,
I bet the cinnamon has.

733
00:44:33,372 --> 00:44:36,409
<i>That damn cinnamon
in those gooseberry pies.</i>

734
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:40,663
Dogville's got everything
you ever dreamed of in the big city.

735
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:43,103
You're worse than Tom.

736
00:44:44,805 --> 00:44:46,803
How do you know
what I've dreamed of?

737
00:44:51,372 --> 00:44:53,889
You're from the city yourself,
aren't you?

738
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:55,937
<i>That was a long time ago.</i>

739
00:44:55,938 --> 00:44:59,335
I'm not that stupid anymore. I found out
that people are the same all over--

740
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:01,869
<i>greedy as animals.</i>

741
00:45:02,772 --> 00:45:04,909
In a small town they're just
a bit less successful.

742
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:07,929
Feed them enough,
they'll eat till their bellies burst.

743
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,370
<i>That's why you want
to be rid of me,</i>

744
00:45:10,538 --> 00:45:13,315
because you can't stand
that I remind you

745
00:45:13,772 --> 00:45:15,770
of what it was
you came here to find.

746
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,216
I'm telling you for the last time
to get out of my home.

747
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:28,680
<i>Moses don't like you,
and I don't like you.</i>

748
00:45:29,038 --> 00:45:31,146
Kids are going crazy enough
from their ma's teaching.

749
00:45:31,505 --> 00:45:33,503
Thank you, Grace.

750
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:48,958
CHAPTER THREE in which Grace
indulges in a shady piece of provocation.

751
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:54,065
<i>The two weeks
had passed far too quickly.</i>

752
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:56,902
<i>Grace had enjoyed herself.</i>

753
00:45:57,305 --> 00:46:00,142
<i>All she could say was
that she was fond of them all,</i>

754
00:46:00,605 --> 00:46:04,501
<i>including the folk who had greeted her
with reluctance and hostility.</i>

755
00:46:06,105 --> 00:46:09,122
<i>Even though she might not have won
everybody over completely,</i>

756
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:12,002
<i>or even half way, as Tom put it,</i>

757
00:46:12,405 --> 00:46:14,403
<i>she cared for Dogville.</i>

758
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,613
<i>And she had shown the town her face.</i>

759
00:46:16,971 --> 00:46:18,969
<i>Her true face.</i>

760
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:21,270
<i>But was that enough?</i>

761
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:24,339
<i>During Jack McKay's
long lecture that evening,</i>

762
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:27,706
<i>she had found herself
in a heart-searching mood.</i>

763
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:32,067
<i>Whether heart searching or concern
for her future was the cause,</i>

764
00:46:32,672 --> 00:46:36,388
<i>the result was that
the otherwise so-lovable Grace</i>

765
00:46:36,971 --> 00:46:40,568
<i>indulged in a pretty shady
piece of provocation.</i>

766
00:46:41,138 --> 00:46:43,136
<i>So, you agree...</i>

767
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:45,479
<i>that the windows in St. Bridget's--</i>

768
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:47,869
the first time you saw them--

769
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,983
didn't live up
to their reputation?

770
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:53,205
<i>- Mmm-mm.</i>
<i>- I don't think it's the position...</i>

771
00:46:53,672 --> 00:46:56,569
of the church itself.

772
00:46:57,038 --> 00:46:59,466
No, no, maybe it's...

773
00:46:59,871 --> 00:47:01,869
the light in Los Angeles,

774
00:47:01,971 --> 00:47:05,128
and the mosaic glass
in those windows.

775
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,746
They kind of collide.

776
00:47:10,005 --> 00:47:12,223
I remember thinking that.

777
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:15,689
I think we've talked long enough

778
00:47:16,038 --> 00:47:18,256
about the way we remember
seeing things.

779
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:20,856
<i>- Don't you?
-</i> Well...

780
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,985
Why don't we talk
about something...

781
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:27,403
that we can see right now?

782
00:47:28,472 --> 00:47:30,610
There's not much
to see around here.

783
00:47:32,305 --> 00:47:34,303
Wretched town.

784
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:37,169
Why don't we talk
about the view?

785
00:47:39,005 --> 00:47:41,003
Well...

786
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:43,652
I don't go out much.

787
00:47:45,704 --> 00:47:48,042
<i>You know, the-- the-- the sun...</i>

788
00:47:48,438 --> 00:47:50,137
<i>my skin.</i>

789
00:47:50,138 --> 00:47:53,235
Yesterday, I was walking
in Chuck's apple trees.

790
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:58,082
If you go right up
to the edge of the cliff...

791
00:47:59,638 --> 00:48:01,976
you just manage to peer
around Ben's garage,

792
00:48:02,372 --> 00:48:05,089
and you get a view of your house
from the side facing the gorge.

793
00:48:05,538 --> 00:48:08,904
- Well.
- I didn't realize there was...

794
00:48:10,438 --> 00:48:12,775
windows behind there.

795
00:48:13,171 --> 00:48:15,169
Huge windows.

796
00:48:17,005 --> 00:48:19,433
It must be a wonderful view.

797
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:23,383
<i>Would you mind
if I opened them?</i>

798
00:49:04,971 --> 00:49:07,189
<i>You're no fool, Miss Grace.</i>

799
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:12,003
You're no fool.

800
00:49:13,305 --> 00:49:16,671
<i>You probably see that
those curtains are hard to open.</i>

801
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,203
I'm sorry.

802
00:49:21,205 --> 00:49:24,192
<i>And obviously concluded
it's because...</i>

803
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:27,479
- I'm sorry.
<i>- ...they're not used very often.</i>

804
00:49:30,038 --> 00:49:32,036
But the view is good.

805
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,802
Entrancing, even.

806
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:41,869
<i>So...</i>

807
00:49:43,905 --> 00:49:47,122
ask me why a man
who loves the light...

808
00:49:49,738 --> 00:49:51,906
hanged these heavy curtains.

809
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:02,661
Yes, I'm blind.

810
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,705
Not weak-sighted,

811
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:09,123
not myopic,

812
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:11,470
blind.

813
00:50:13,438 --> 00:50:15,955
So...

814
00:50:16,372 --> 00:50:18,479
please go...

815
00:50:22,638 --> 00:50:24,806
<i>and let me be that on my own.</i>

816
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:33,709
<i>In Switzerland,</i>

817
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:36,037
<i>they call it</i>

818
00:50:36,038 --> 00:50:39,754
the <i>Alpenglünen.</i>

819
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,137
That's the light

820
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:46,855
that reflects
from the highest peaks,

821
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:49,552
after the sun

822
00:50:49,938 --> 00:50:52,366
<i>goes down behind the mountains.</i>

823
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:56,976
And now it's gone.

824
00:51:21,005 --> 00:51:23,003
<i>It was in complete silence</i>

825
00:51:23,105 --> 00:51:26,092
<i>that the people of Dogville turned up
for the meeting at the mission house</i>

826
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:30,078
<i>two weeks to the day since
the beautiful fugitive had come to town.</i>

827
00:51:32,604 --> 00:51:36,500
<i>Grace was standing beside Tom,
watching them convene</i>

828
00:51:37,105 --> 00:51:40,441
<i>and knew inside herself
that this might well be the last time</i>

829
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:44,158
<i>she would see
these now-so-familiar faces.</i>

830
00:51:44,671 --> 00:51:46,749
<i>She had at least
two of them against her,</i>

831
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:50,202
<i>and even one
would have been too many.</i>

832
00:51:50,704 --> 00:51:52,702
Welcome,

833
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:54,137
good people of Dogville,

834
00:51:54,138 --> 00:51:56,136
two weeks--

835
00:51:56,272 --> 00:51:58,270
two weeks have passed

836
00:51:58,372 --> 00:52:01,408
and it's time for your verdict.

837
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:05,561
Is it right that she should be here
while we talk?

838
00:52:06,138 --> 00:52:08,186
<i>Well, Mrs. Henson,
when Grace first came,</i>

839
00:52:08,537 --> 00:52:10,585
she made no attempt
to hide her weakness from us,

840
00:52:10,938 --> 00:52:13,306
I think it's only right
that we'd be as open with her.

841
00:52:13,704 --> 00:52:16,312
Tell her to her face if we...

842
00:52:16,738 --> 00:52:18,736
want her to leave.

843
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,069
No, Mrs. Henson's right.

844
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:24,471
Nobody should be prevented
from speaking their mind

845
00:52:24,971 --> 00:52:27,049
<i>out of politeness.</i>

846
00:52:27,404 --> 00:52:29,622
I'll wait at the mine

847
00:52:30,005 --> 00:52:32,552
and if the vote says
that I should leave,

848
00:52:32,971 --> 00:52:34,969
then I'll take the path
across the...

849
00:52:35,138 --> 00:52:37,355
across the mountains
while it's still light.

850
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,736
<i>All of the things
that I've borrowed,</i>

851
00:52:40,038 --> 00:52:42,036
if you could return them
to everybody.

852
00:52:42,305 --> 00:52:45,551
- Of course.
- Nobody has to see me before I go.

853
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:49,228
Martha, if you'll just ring the bell,
then I'll understand.

854
00:52:49,738 --> 00:52:51,404
Well, I don't--

855
00:52:51,404 --> 00:52:53,402
how do you want me
to ring the bell?

856
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:56,895
Just ring it for every vote
that lets me stay.

857
00:52:57,404 --> 00:52:59,452
<i>I'll count.</i>

858
00:52:59,804 --> 00:53:02,491
<i>and if it doesn't reach 15, then...</i>

859
00:53:02,938 --> 00:53:05,335
then I'll leave.

860
00:53:13,238 --> 00:53:16,664
Tom is anxious
to speak in her behalf,

861
00:53:17,205 --> 00:53:19,253
but I think he's had
his allotted time.

862
00:53:19,604 --> 00:53:22,032
We know his view.
We respect it.

863
00:53:22,437 --> 00:53:24,435
And now
he must respect ours.

864
00:53:25,771 --> 00:53:27,769
<i>Grace pulled her bundle out</i>

865
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,239
<i>from under the bureau
to change into her own clothes</i>

866
00:53:30,638 --> 00:53:33,066
<i>only to discover
that somebody had been in it</i>

867
00:53:33,471 --> 00:53:35,469
<i>and left a loaf of bread.</i>

868
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,812
<i>Next to it
was a folded sheet of paper.</i>

869
00:53:40,272 --> 00:53:42,929
<i>It was a map Tom had drawn.</i>

870
00:53:43,371 --> 00:53:46,388
<i>He had known where the bundle was
and had put it there.</i>

871
00:53:46,871 --> 00:53:49,119
<i>It showed the path
across the mountain,</i>

872
00:53:49,504 --> 00:53:51,582
<i>and all the dangerous spots
were furnished</i>

873
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:54,335
<i>with witty horrific little sketches.</i>

874
00:53:56,337 --> 00:53:58,335
<i>But there was more...</i>

875
00:53:58,404 --> 00:54:00,862
<i>several people
had had the same idea.</i>

876
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:04,019
<i>They had eased gifts
into the bundle for her.</i>

877
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:08,717
<i>Jason's beloved little penknife
lay there, all polished and shiny.</i>

878
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,268
<i>And a pie
from Ma Ginger and Gloria.</i>

879
00:54:12,738 --> 00:54:15,485
<i>And some clothing
and matches and a hymnal.</i>

880
00:54:15,938 --> 00:54:18,216
<i>Grace opened it at number 18</i>

881
00:54:18,604 --> 00:54:21,261
<i>where Martha always had trouble
with the fingering,</i>

882
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:26,192
<i>and between the pages,
lay a dollar bill.</i>

883
00:54:26,704 --> 00:54:29,281
<i>Martha alone
could not have afforded it.</i>

884
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,199
<i>Grace had friends in Dogville.</i>

885
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,137
<i>That was for sure.</i>

886
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:38,534
<i>Whether they were few or many
did not matter a jot.</i>

887
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:41,288
<i>Grace had bared her throat
to the town</i>

888
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:44,568
<i>and it had responded
with a great gift...</i>

889
00:54:45,038 --> 00:54:47,036
<i>with friends.</i>

890
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:54,995
<i>No gangster could deprive her
of this meeting with the township,</i>

891
00:54:55,504 --> 00:54:58,221
<i>no matter how many guns
in the world.</i>

892
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:01,298
<i>And should the strokes of the bell
not reach 15,</i>

893
00:55:01,738 --> 00:55:04,575
<i>she knew now that she meant
something to the town</i>

894
00:55:05,038 --> 00:55:07,255
<i>and that her stay
had been of significance.</i>

895
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,636
<i>Not much perhaps,</i>

896
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:13,068
<i>but nevertheless
a trace she had left.</i>

897
00:55:13,604 --> 00:55:15,602
<i>And the first in her young life</i>

898
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:17,949
<i>in which she took pride.</i>

899
00:55:31,804 --> 00:55:35,081
<i>Grace stiffened
as the bell began its toll.</i>

900
00:56:11,704 --> 00:56:14,361
Twelve.

901
00:56:18,371 --> 00:56:20,070
14...

902
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:22,938
<i>14, Grace counted.</i>

903
00:56:23,404 --> 00:56:26,771
<i>So McKay must have
voted for her after all.</i>

904
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:29,302
<i>And if so,</i>

905
00:56:29,604 --> 00:56:32,032
<i>why not Chuck too?</i>

906
00:57:13,537 --> 00:57:15,535
Everyone?

907
00:57:16,404 --> 00:57:18,402
- And Chuck.
<i>- Chuck?!</i>

908
00:57:18,437 --> 00:57:20,435
<i>Everyone.</i>

909
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:23,435
I think they like you here.

910
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:42,167
CHAPTER FOUR
"Happy times in Dogville"

911
00:57:42,237 --> 00:57:45,164
<i>The period of spring and early summer</i>

912
00:57:45,638 --> 00:57:47,536
<i>proved a happy one for Grace.</i>

913
00:57:47,537 --> 00:57:51,073
<i>Martha rang the hours,
conducting her through the day,</i>

914
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:54,155
<i>so she could serve
as eyes for McKay,</i>

915
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,148
<i>- a mother for Ben,
-</i> Right.

916
00:57:57,571 --> 00:57:59,789
<i>A friend for Vera,</i>

917
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:02,598
<i>and brains for Bill.</i>

918
00:58:12,437 --> 00:58:14,435
<i>And one day it had
occurred to Grace</i>

919
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:16,769
<i>to tread the pedals herself</i>

920
00:58:17,104 --> 00:58:18,970
<i>so as to get Martha to agree</i>

921
00:58:18,971 --> 00:58:20,803
<i>to play a couple of proper notes</i>

922
00:58:20,804 --> 00:58:23,551
<i>just to empty the bellows naturally
so that they wouldn't be</i>

923
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:26,842
<i>left under pressure
and thus be spoiled.</i>

924
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:29,302
<i>And now they had tacitly agreed</i>

925
00:58:29,604 --> 00:58:32,501
<i>that as long as it was Grace
who trod the pedals</i>

926
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:35,488
<i>Martha could play
without feeling any guilt.</i>

927
00:58:40,638 --> 00:58:44,034
<i>To Tom's pop, the old doctor
who imagined he had a new ailment</i>

928
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:47,028
<i>every single day and was thus
increasingly addicted</i>

929
00:58:47,437 --> 00:58:50,454
<i>to the simpler coordination tests
from his medical school days,</i>

930
00:58:50,938 --> 00:58:52,770
<i>she had to be severe,</i>

931
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:56,107
<i>telling him that there was
nothing wrong with him.</i>

932
00:58:58,004 --> 00:59:00,612
<i>And now since the town
had agreed</i>

933
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,205
<i>that everyone was to give
according to his abilities,</i>

934
00:59:03,571 --> 00:59:05,679
<i>she received wages-- not much,</i>

935
00:59:06,037 --> 00:59:07,437
<i>but enough to save up</i>

936
00:59:07,437 --> 00:59:09,435
<i>for the first of the tiny
china figurines</i>

937
00:59:09,571 --> 00:59:11,819
<i>from the row of seven
that had stood for so long</i>

938
00:59:12,204 --> 00:59:14,632
<i>gathering dust in the window
of the store.</i>

939
00:59:16,571 --> 00:59:18,569
<i>And she dreamed that in time,</i>

940
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:20,889
<i>she would be able
to acquire them all.</i>

941
00:59:22,337 --> 00:59:24,270
- Don't make sense.
- I wanted to be--

942
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:27,518
<i>Slowly those alabaster hands
turned into a pair of hands</i>

943
00:59:28,037 --> 00:59:31,983
<i>that could have belonged to anyone
in any little rural community.</i>

944
00:59:32,604 --> 00:59:36,520
<i>And three weeks later,
she triumphantly moved into a place</i>

945
00:59:37,137 --> 00:59:39,325
<i>Tom and Ben had secretly restored--</i>

946
00:59:39,704 --> 00:59:41,702
<i>namely the old mill,</i>

947
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:44,558
<i>which had once held
the town's ore crusher,</i>

948
00:59:45,004 --> 00:59:48,691
<i>but of which only the heavy
flywheel now remained.</i>

949
00:59:55,604 --> 00:59:57,036
- Hmm?
- Thanks.

950
00:59:57,037 --> 00:59:59,035
See, that's what I'm talking about

951
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,168
with the freight industry.

952
01:00:01,337 --> 01:00:04,674
Miss Laura had thrown that out.
It was no use to anybody

953
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:07,282
just a good thing
in the wrong place, but--

954
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:09,636
From a truck, you know?

955
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:12,362
You shouldn't poke fun
at the freight industry, that's all.

956
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,538
No, you're right, Ben,
they shouldn't.

957
01:00:23,771 --> 01:00:25,769
Grace?

958
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:28,403
<i>What?</i>

959
01:00:28,404 --> 01:00:30,682
I just had to tell you I had
a really selfish reason

960
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,318
for voting to keep you
in Dogville.

961
01:00:37,537 --> 01:00:39,535
What was it?

962
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:43,038
It was such a relief
when you turned up,

963
01:00:43,404 --> 01:00:45,402
and you were the one
all the men had eyes for.

964
01:00:45,704 --> 01:00:47,752
<i>- </i> You know, Tom and them?

965
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:51,868
I had to put up with it for long.

966
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,568
Frankly, I just didn't have
the energy for it anymore.

967
01:00:56,937 --> 01:00:58,935
They'll always have eyes
for you, Liz.

968
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:03,035
You know that.

969
01:01:03,571 --> 01:01:05,819
- They will.
- Okay.

970
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,202
<i>- You're beautiful.</i>
- Thank you, Grace.

971
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:11,470
<i>The very latest development</i>

972
01:01:11,471 --> 01:01:13,639
<i>now that summer was at its peak</i>

973
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,637
<i>was that Grace had been given leave</i>

974
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:18,325
<i>to help Chuck in the orchard.</i>

975
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:21,318
<i>And every day at 5:00,
once their work was done,</i>

976
01:01:21,738 --> 01:01:25,044
<i>she could appreciate
that actually McKay was right.</i>

977
01:01:25,571 --> 01:01:27,503
<i>The shadow of the spire</i>

978
01:01:27,504 --> 01:01:30,341
<i>did indeed point at Ma Ginger's store.</i>

979
01:01:33,104 --> 01:01:35,762
<i>But today</i>

980
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:38,951
<i>the tower did not only announce
that it was time to go shopping,</i>

981
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:43,590
<i>but also-- by a signal which nobody,
despite Martha's initial concerns,</i>

982
01:01:44,237 --> 01:01:46,755
<i>could have confused
with the ringing of the hours--</i>

983
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,358
<i>a warning that somebody
was approaching</i>

984
01:01:49,738 --> 01:01:52,135
<i>by a canyon road
from Georgetown.</i>

985
01:01:52,537 --> 01:01:54,535
<i>For the first time in living memory</i>

986
01:01:54,704 --> 01:01:57,391
<i>law enforcers had come to Dogville.</i>

987
01:02:07,638 --> 01:02:09,636
Good evening, sir.

988
01:02:11,004 --> 01:02:13,222
<i>This the whole place?</i>

989
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:16,351
<i>- Is there a town hall?
- No.</i>

990
01:02:16,803 --> 01:02:18,941
I got me a notice
to paste up.

991
01:02:19,304 --> 01:02:21,103
We've got the mission house.

992
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,322
<i>- That do you?</i>
- Sure.

993
01:02:24,937 --> 01:02:26,537
<i>What'd she do?</i>

994
01:02:26,537 --> 01:02:28,535
Missing, that's all it says.

995
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:31,164
I guess somebody's
been missing her.

996
01:02:31,604 --> 01:02:34,121
Heard tell she was
last seen around here.

997
01:02:34,537 --> 01:02:37,024
We're putting these things up
all over the county.

998
01:02:38,638 --> 01:02:41,125
<i>If somebody sees her,
they ought to go to the police?</i>

999
01:02:41,537 --> 01:02:43,535
I guess that's the idea.

1000
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:18,161
These men were never
gonna give in easily.

1001
01:03:18,604 --> 01:03:22,500
<i>Now these posters,
they hang all over the county...</i>

1002
01:03:25,104 --> 01:03:27,412
which means nobody suspects
she's right here with us.

1003
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:29,736
No, but it was a policeman, Tom.

1004
01:03:29,737 --> 01:03:31,735
Isn't it a duty to respond
to the police?

1005
01:03:32,004 --> 01:03:34,841
I mean legally speaking.

1006
01:03:35,304 --> 01:03:37,931
I-- I'm sorry.

1007
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:40,738
I just--
when I get upset, I cough.

1008
01:03:41,137 --> 01:03:43,275
She's a missing person,
she hasn't done anything.

1009
01:03:43,638 --> 01:03:46,065
<i>- He even said so.</i>
- I think you should vote again.

1010
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:48,898
<i>Why?
We can't resort to plebiscites</i>

1011
01:03:49,304 --> 01:03:51,492
time and time again.

1012
01:03:53,104 --> 01:03:55,102
<i>Oh, come on,</i>

1013
01:03:55,237 --> 01:03:58,224
who's really got cold feet
because of a picture and piece of paper?

1014
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:19,833
CHAPTER FIVE
"Fourth of July after all"

1015
01:04:22,803 --> 01:04:24,801
<i>The fourth of July came</i>

1016
01:04:25,037 --> 01:04:28,164
<i>with huge clouds of seeds
from some remote meadow</i>

1017
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:31,857
<i>gracefully floating down Elm Street
in the early evening.</i>

1018
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:34,948
<i>Today was a day for celebration.</i>

1019
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,648
<i>Nobody was to worry
about the hard times.</i>

1020
01:04:38,037 --> 01:04:41,104
<i>And Grace could stop
at Ma Ginger's window quite content</i>

1021
01:04:41,604 --> 01:04:45,350
<i>to ascertain that only two
of the little china figurines remained.</i>

1022
01:04:45,937 --> 01:04:47,869
<i>And were thus the only two</i>

1023
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:50,857
<i>she had not yet been able
to save up enough to purchase.</i>

1024
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:57,968
- It looks great, girls.
- Mm-hmm.

1025
01:04:59,703 --> 01:05:02,191
Grace, will you put in
a couple of hours with me?

1026
01:05:02,603 --> 01:05:04,601
In the orchard again today?

1027
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:07,637
It's real nice down there
with the sunshine.

1028
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:10,102
Chuck, it's the Fourth of July.

1029
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:13,858
What are you talking
about sunshine for?

1030
01:05:14,271 --> 01:05:16,698
<i>Have you turned
into a romantic like me?</i>

1031
01:05:21,337 --> 01:05:23,335
- No.
<i>- We're gonna have fun.</i>

1032
01:05:24,571 --> 01:05:26,678
During the winter,
we'll all starve.

1033
01:05:27,037 --> 01:05:29,495
Even Ben's taking the day off.

1034
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:33,648
- Hi.
- Hey, Tom.

1035
01:05:34,004 --> 01:05:36,002
Gracie, you got a moment?

1036
01:05:38,371 --> 01:05:41,298
- Now?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1037
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,788
I've got something
interesting to tell you.

1038
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:46,003
Uh...

1039
01:05:46,004 --> 01:05:48,002
well, it has to be quick.

1040
01:05:55,137 --> 01:05:58,414
I got so much going on in my head.

1041
01:05:58,937 --> 01:06:00,955
That must be very tiring for you.

1042
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:06,297
I think I've done a pretty good analysis
of the folks in this town and...

1043
01:06:09,437 --> 01:06:11,804
I think I understand them...

1044
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:15,701
in a meaningful way.

1045
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:20,108
<i>But when I come to decipher you,</i>

1046
01:06:20,504 --> 01:06:22,502
<i>I get absolutely nowhere.</i>

1047
01:06:23,937 --> 01:06:25,935
You know, Liz--

1048
01:06:26,837 --> 01:06:28,835
Liz is easy to read.

1049
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:33,828
And there was some
attraction between us.

1050
01:06:37,603 --> 01:06:40,231
But as I can see right through her,

1051
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:43,567
intellectually, I mean,
I can see right through her.

1052
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:47,843
My desire was purely of a physical--

1053
01:06:49,904 --> 01:06:51,902
<i>physical nature.</i>

1054
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:56,369
But with you

1055
01:06:56,703 --> 01:06:58,701
it's...

1056
01:06:59,037 --> 01:07:01,644
<i>- What?
-</i> It's more-- it's more complicated.

1057
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:04,068
What are you trying to say?

1058
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,158
No, I should get it clearer
in my head first.

1059
01:07:12,337 --> 01:07:14,445
Are you trying to say that...

1060
01:07:17,104 --> 01:07:19,102
you're in love with me?

1061
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,168
No, I wouldn't--

1062
01:07:26,304 --> 01:07:28,302
Love is what--
it's not--

1063
01:07:31,737 --> 01:07:33,735
It's a big word-- yeah.

1064
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:40,068
Yeah.

1065
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:43,188
Well, that's good.

1066
01:07:43,536 --> 01:07:45,534
Hmm...

1067
01:07:46,637 --> 01:07:48,635
Because...

1068
01:07:52,037 --> 01:07:54,375
I think that I'm in love with you too.

1069
01:07:57,237 --> 01:07:59,235
Very interesting, isn't it?

1070
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:04,024
I mean it's interesting
in a psychological--

1071
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,335
Did they call you?
I think they're...

1072
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,468
calling you.

1073
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:21,068
I didn't hear them.

1074
01:08:23,737 --> 01:08:25,735
No.

1075
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,869
You should...

1076
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,918
probably get back anyway.

1077
01:08:35,337 --> 01:08:38,433
I'll see you at the wedding--
uh, celebration. Sorry.

- Bravo.
- Yay.

1084
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,402
<i>Well done!</i>

1085
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:16,817
This year I didn't bring
any notes with me

1086
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:20,078
'cause I'm not gonna pretend
I can read them.

1087
01:09:23,137 --> 01:09:25,275
Which brings me to a point,

1088
01:09:25,637 --> 01:09:27,715
a point I want to make.

1089
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:30,347
And that point is,

1090
01:09:30,737 --> 01:09:32,735
<i>you, Grace.</i>

1091
01:09:32,904 --> 01:09:35,302
<i>Yes, you've made Dogville</i>

1092
01:09:35,703 --> 01:09:38,131
<i>a wonderful place to live in.</i>

1093
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:41,669
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

1094
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:45,886
somebody tells me they ran
into grumpy old Chuck on the street

1095
01:09:46,536 --> 01:09:49,403
<i>and he was actually smiling.</i>

1096
01:09:51,237 --> 01:09:53,454
<i>Well, I've never
seen your smile, Grace,</i>

1097
01:09:53,837 --> 01:09:57,753
<i>but I will bet you
I could describe it.</i>

1098
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:00,069
Hmm?

1099
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,557
Because it obviously has every color

1100
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:05,837
that's refracted from the shiniest

1101
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:08,381
<i>prism in the world.</i>

1102
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,905
<i>And you probably have a face
to match that, huh?</i>

1103
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:13,203
<i>Does she have a face
to match that, Tom?</i>

1104
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:14,570
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Huh?</i>

1105
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,588
<i>- Yes, sir.
- I'll bet she does.</i>

1106
01:10:16,937 --> 01:10:19,544
We are proud
to have you among us.

1107
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,170
<i>Hm-mm!</i>

1108
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:24,446
And we thank you

1109
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,188
<i>for showing us who you are.</i>

1110
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:30,678
Here's to you, Grace.

1111
01:10:31,037 --> 01:10:33,175
<i>Stay with us as long
as you damn please.</i>

1112
01:10:33,536 --> 01:10:35,754
To Grace.

1113
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:52,635
Stop!

1114
01:10:57,070 --> 01:10:59,068
A police car
has just been seen in town

1115
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:01,687
and it's just made the turn
up Canyon Road.

1116
01:11:02,104 --> 01:11:04,621
- So he'll be here any minute.
- Should I ring the bell?

1117
01:11:06,603 --> 01:11:08,601
No, Martha,
Grace probably heard.

1118
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:12,918
- We'll get rid of him quickly-<i>-
-</i> Better go, honey, go.

1119
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:15,334
Don't worry.

1120
01:11:27,904 --> 01:11:31,061
Should have been celebrating myself
if this hadn't have come up.

1121
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:34,557
I got to change this
missing persons notice.

1122
01:11:36,004 --> 01:11:38,112
It's that lady again.

1123
01:11:39,436 --> 01:11:41,434
It's why she disappeared.

1124
01:11:43,203 --> 01:11:46,980
She's wanted in connection with some
bank robberies on the West Coast.

1125
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:50,118
<i>When did these robberies take place?</i>

1126
01:11:50,536 --> 01:11:52,469
Last couple of weeks.

1127
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:55,627
- All right.
- <i>You don't get much news up here?</i>

1128
01:11:56,137 --> 01:11:58,744
My dad's radio only plays music.

1129
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:03,561
All I know is they say
she's dangerous--

1130
01:12:04,004 --> 01:12:08,010
and that anyone with any information
about her better call us pronto.

1131
01:12:08,637 --> 01:12:10,635
<i>That's the law.</i>

1132
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:26,568
<i>Two weeks.</i>

1133
01:12:28,937 --> 01:12:30,935
Can't be our girl, Tom.

1134
01:12:31,203 --> 01:12:33,481
- No, she's been here all the time.
- <i>Right.</i>

1135
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:36,038
She couldn't have done
what they're accusing her of.

1136
01:12:37,637 --> 01:12:39,635
<i>No, that's true, Tom, you're right.</i>

1137
01:12:39,904 --> 01:12:42,211
Still it's an unpleasant business
just the same.

1138
01:12:50,203 --> 01:12:52,891
<i>Grace was the same and so was the town.</i>

1139
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:56,334
<i>That the gangsters had fixed
to have charges</i>

1140
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:58,938
<i>made against Grace
and their efforts to neutralize her</i>

1141
01:12:59,336 --> 01:13:01,444
<i>came as no surprise.</i>

1142
01:13:02,904 --> 01:13:05,771
<i>But everything had changed a little
yet again.</i>

1143
01:13:06,236 --> 01:13:09,573
I'm telling you, you have exactly
the same kind of little lump

1144
01:13:10,104 --> 01:13:12,761
in exactly the same spot
on the other side of your back.

1145
01:13:13,203 --> 01:13:15,281
- Really?
- I can only assume...

1146
01:13:17,737 --> 01:13:20,075
that it belongs on your body.

1147
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:22,638
But you are the doctor,

1148
01:13:23,004 --> 01:13:25,082
so...

1149
01:13:25,436 --> 01:13:27,434
It's very unlikely, don't you think,

1150
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,727
that a cancer would develop
in such precise symmetry?

1151
01:13:31,203 --> 01:13:33,481
- Mr. Edison, please-<i>-
-</i> No, don't you-- I mean--

1152
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:36,447
- we have been over this so many times.
- Anything's possible.

1153
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,868
I think you have to accept the fact

1154
01:13:39,203 --> 01:13:41,811
that you are an exceptionally healthy

1155
01:13:42,236 --> 01:13:44,234
elderly gentleman.

1156
01:13:44,403 --> 01:13:46,831
I'm gonna rest just the same.

1157
01:13:47,236 --> 01:13:49,234
<i>I'll see you in the morning.</i>

1158
01:13:49,303 --> 01:13:51,301
I hope so.

1159
01:13:51,403 --> 01:13:53,741
What? What did they say?

1160
01:13:54,136 --> 01:13:56,134
<i>Well...</i>

1161
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:01,237
I couldn't really argue
that anything had changed, but...

1162
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:05,889
by not telling the police they felt that
they were committing a crime themselves.

1163
01:14:10,203 --> 01:14:12,168
- I think I should leave.
<i>- No.</i>

1164
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:14,417
- Enough is enough.
<i>- I have suggested the opposite.</i>

1165
01:14:16,236 --> 01:14:20,132
<i>- You did?
-</i> From a business perspective--

1166
01:14:23,069 --> 01:14:25,587
from a business prospective your--

1167
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:28,521
your presence in Dogville
has become more costly...

1168
01:14:30,069 --> 01:14:33,226
<i>because it's more dangerous
for them to have you here--</i>

1169
01:14:33,737 --> 01:14:35,735
<i>not that they don't want you.</i>

1170
01:14:36,737 --> 01:14:39,544
It's just they feel
there should be some

1171
01:14:40,004 --> 01:14:42,002
counterbalance.

1172
01:14:43,004 --> 01:14:45,002
Some quid pro quo.

1173
01:14:45,004 --> 01:14:47,521
That sounds like words
the gangsters would use.

1174
01:14:47,937 --> 01:14:51,653
But there is also more of an incentive
for you to want to stay.

1175
01:14:55,169 --> 01:14:58,236
<i>See, with all of those wanted posters
hanging around the place,</i>

1176
01:14:58,737 --> 01:15:01,664
I can hardly think of anywhere else
you could hide.

1177
01:15:04,069 --> 01:15:07,056
So what's the counterbalance
that you suggest?

1178
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:09,534
Right, well...

1179
01:15:10,703 --> 01:15:12,981
they wanted you
to work longer hours.

1180
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:16,736
But instead, what I proposed

1181
01:15:16,737 --> 01:15:18,955
is that

1182
01:15:19,336 --> 01:15:21,964
you just pay a visit to folks
twice a day now.

1183
01:15:22,403 --> 01:15:25,470
That way it would seem
that you're willing to contribute more

1184
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:28,307
without actually lengthening
your day too much.

1185
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:31,360
<i>It's just a way of heading off
any unpleasantness.</i>

1186
01:15:37,937 --> 01:15:39,955
But it sounds--

1187
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:43,670
it sounds a little peculiar,
difficult to put into practice.

1188
01:15:44,203 --> 01:15:46,201
That's what I thought.

1189
01:15:47,336 --> 01:15:50,263
Martha, she said she'd ring her bell
every half hour

1190
01:15:50,737 --> 01:15:52,925
so you could keep track
of your new schedule.

1191
01:15:56,536 --> 01:15:58,534
Then they're all willing
to let me stay?

1192
01:15:58,737 --> 01:16:00,735
<i>No.</i>

1193
01:16:00,737 --> 01:16:03,664
Mrs. Henson, she also

1194
01:16:04,136 --> 01:16:06,184
thought we should cut your pay.

1195
01:16:06,536 --> 01:16:09,113
- So--
- Merely a symbolic gesture.

1196
01:16:09,536 --> 01:16:11,534
It was--

1197
01:16:12,303 --> 01:16:15,320
You see the word dangerous
on the poster worried her.

1198
01:16:17,803 --> 01:16:19,801
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

1199
01:16:19,837 --> 01:16:21,835
If I have to work

1200
01:16:21,969 --> 01:16:24,277
harder, longer hours for less pay,

1201
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:27,327
then I'm wiling to do that,
of course I am.

1202
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:31,468
I just want to be sure

1203
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:34,130
that they wouldn't prefer
that I left town.

1204
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,568
<i>Of course not.</i>

1205
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:40,868
<i>You think this is for the best?</i>

1206
01:16:41,903 --> 01:16:43,901
I know it is.

1207
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:49,234
I have to get some sleep.

1208
01:16:52,236 --> 01:16:54,814
My days are gonna be
much busier now.

1209
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:57,234
I'm sorry.

1210
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:23,067
<i>Tom.</i>

1211
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:27,668
I just need to know something.

1212
01:17:30,536 --> 01:17:33,872
You know the card
that the man in the car gave you?

1213
01:17:34,403 --> 01:17:36,401
<i>Yeah.</i>

1214
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,668
Did you show it to anyone?

1215
01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:44,920
Come on, Grace.

1216
01:17:46,936 --> 01:17:48,902
I burned it first thing.

1217
01:17:48,903 --> 01:17:50,901
I am being so silly,

1218
01:17:51,003 --> 01:17:53,001
of course you did.

1219
01:17:53,136 --> 01:17:55,134
<i>It's all right, it's all right.</i>

1220
01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:57,134
No, it's not all right.

1221
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:59,668
I-- I hate it for you
to see me like this.

1222
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:01,935
I can't bear that I'm doubting you.

1223
01:18:01,936 --> 01:18:04,923
I'm sorry. Good night.

1224
01:18:24,802 --> 01:18:27,020
<i>Everybody was really against</i>

1225
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:30,010
<i>any changes to Grace's
working conditions at all</i>

1226
01:18:30,436 --> 01:18:32,774
<i>when the subject occasionally
came up in conversation.</i>

1227
01:18:41,303 --> 01:18:44,020
<i>Oh, Ben had declared in sympathy
that he wouldn't accept</i>

1228
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,187
<i>any more work than before--
and Grace was grateful for that.</i>

1229
01:18:47,637 --> 01:18:51,113
<i>Even if he was a bit drunk
when he said so.</i>

1230
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:57,827
<i>Busy minutes became busy hours,</i>

1231
01:18:58,236 --> 01:19:01,253
<i>and busy hours became busy days.</i>

1232
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:05,573
<i>And irrespective of whether they thought
the idea of increasing Grace's services</i>

1233
01:19:06,169 --> 01:19:09,006
<i>had any fairness
and justification to it or not,</i>

1234
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:11,777
<i>it didn't seem to make anyone
any happier,</i>

1235
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:14,167
<i>more to the contrary.</i>

1236
01:19:15,036 --> 01:19:16,636
Oh...

1237
01:19:16,637 --> 01:19:19,624
Grace, oh,
you have to be more careful.

1238
01:19:20,103 --> 01:19:22,101
Liz wasn't very careful either,

1239
01:19:22,336 --> 01:19:24,168
<i>but she didn't break our glasses.</i>

1240
01:19:24,169 --> 01:19:26,856
I think you need to understand
that Mr. Henson

1241
01:19:27,303 --> 01:19:30,110
<i>works very hard
to grind off any traces of the molds.</i>

1242
01:19:31,536 --> 01:19:33,534
It makes the glass weak.

1243
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:37,293
<i>- I thought you knew that.</i>
- It won't happen again.

1244
01:19:37,769 --> 01:19:39,767
Of course I'll pay for it.

1245
01:19:39,836 --> 01:19:42,004
No, of course not,
you don't have to pay us for it.

1246
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:44,448
We'll get over it.

1247
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:49,257
<i>And off she went again
to keep her appointment with Chuck,</i>

1248
01:19:49,736 --> 01:19:51,814
<i>to free the last tree trunks
from the grass,</i>

1249
01:19:52,169 --> 01:19:54,657
<i>in order to keep
the ever busy mice away.</i>

1250
01:19:56,136 --> 01:19:58,134
<i>She was in a hurry
and took the shortcut</i>

1251
01:19:58,303 --> 01:20:00,168
<i>between the gooseberry bushes,</i>

1252
01:20:00,169 --> 01:20:02,167
<i>only to brought up by a shout.</i>

1253
01:20:02,336 --> 01:20:04,334
- Grace!
<i>- Yes.</i>

1254
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,134
Oh...

1255
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:12,686
I didn't see that you just
raked the path. I'm sorry.

1256
01:20:13,103 --> 01:20:16,200
It isn't that I just raked it,
the idea is

1257
01:20:16,702 --> 01:20:19,859
for people to pass
around the bushes completely.

1258
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:22,857
<i>I prefer it that way,
as you should know.</i>

1259
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:26,257
<i>I thought that these chains
were put up to--</i>

1260
01:20:26,736 --> 01:20:28,784
to make a path
between the bushes.

1261
01:20:29,136 --> 01:20:32,413
They were put up to protect the bushes.
It's not supposed to be a pathway.

1262
01:20:32,936 --> 01:20:35,214
But everyone goes this way.

1263
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:37,601
<i>Yeah, that's right,</i>

1264
01:20:37,802 --> 01:20:39,701
but they've been living here for years,

1265
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:41,700
you haven't been here that long.

1266
01:20:43,069 --> 01:20:45,067
<i>Are you saying that I'm less entitled</i>

1267
01:20:45,303 --> 01:20:47,551
to use the shortcut because

1268
01:20:47,936 --> 01:20:49,636
I haven't always lived here?

1269
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:51,303
Of course not.

1270
01:20:51,303 --> 01:20:54,020
No, I just thought it pleased you
to be here, that's all.

1271
01:20:55,802 --> 01:20:57,800
Go on, go on, it's all right.

1272
01:20:57,936 --> 01:20:59,934
- I'll see you this afternoon.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1273
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:03,287
And I'll rake those bushes
like they've never been raked before.

1274
01:21:03,769 --> 01:21:05,767
I promise.

1275
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:14,369
I'm sorry about that branch,

1276
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,368
there were so many apples on it.

1277
01:21:18,769 --> 01:21:21,726
I should have cut that branch,
but I got greedy.

1278
01:21:23,603 --> 01:21:25,601
<i>Is it greedy to want
to feed your family?</i>

1279
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:34,268
So how come you don't like me?

1280
01:21:38,236 --> 01:21:40,234
Why do you ask me that?

1281
01:21:40,236 --> 01:21:42,234
<i>When I get close to you,
you edge away.</i>

1282
01:21:45,403 --> 01:21:46,969
No, I don't.

1283
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:48,935
<i>You did so</i>

1284
01:21:48,936 --> 01:21:51,544
when we were thinning
the seedlings in the bottom row.

1285
01:21:52,936 --> 01:21:55,683
<i>How am I supposed to show you what I do
if I ain't allowed to touch you?</i>

1286
01:21:57,969 --> 01:21:59,967
You tried to kiss me.

1287
01:22:09,003 --> 01:22:11,900
Vera never took any interest
in the apples.

1288
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:14,368
<i>She hates the orchard.</i>

1289
01:22:15,736 --> 01:22:18,893
<i>This is the first time I ever met
anyone who understood about the apples.</i>

1290
01:22:22,069 --> 01:22:24,067
Sorry it made me so happy.

1291
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,014
- It's all right.
- No, it ain't all right.

1292
01:22:31,403 --> 01:22:34,090
I reckon the stuff about the apples
is just words in your mouth.

1293
01:22:35,836 --> 01:22:37,834
You can't really share my pleasure.

1294
01:22:38,736 --> 01:22:40,102
I do.

1295
01:22:40,103 --> 01:22:44,229
Vera wants me picking apples from trees
that are barely in the ground.

1296
01:22:46,069 --> 01:22:48,067
Things take time, that's love!

1297
01:22:49,503 --> 01:22:52,869
Seeing what they need
and respecting those needs,

1298
01:22:53,403 --> 01:22:56,180
if anyone understands that it's you.
At least I thought so.

1299
01:22:56,636 --> 01:22:59,094
- I do understand that.
- But you edge away when I get close.

1300
01:22:59,503 --> 01:23:00,902
N--

1301
01:23:00,903 --> 01:23:02,768
Why do you find me so repugnant?

1302
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,767
I don't find you repugnant, I--

1303
01:23:06,203 --> 01:23:08,201
Don't be upset.

1304
01:23:09,436 --> 01:23:11,833
I'm sorry if I doubted you.

1305
01:23:12,236 --> 01:23:14,234
It won't happen again...

1306
01:23:16,169 --> 01:23:18,167
I promise you.

1307
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,677
I wouldn't make that promise
if I was you.

1308
01:23:29,136 --> 01:23:31,414
When you fended me <i>off,
</i>a thought came into my mind.

1309
01:23:31,802 --> 01:23:34,080
<i>It made me ashamed.</i>

1310
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:36,468
A thought that you'd hate me for.

1311
01:23:37,936 --> 01:23:39,934
I would never hate you--

1312
01:23:40,736 --> 01:23:42,734
never.

1313
01:23:46,736 --> 01:23:48,734
<i>What?</i>

1314
01:23:49,936 --> 01:23:51,934
Chuck, I treated you unfairly,

1315
01:23:52,169 --> 01:23:54,337
it's all right
to have angry thoughts.

1316
01:23:58,103 --> 01:24:00,101
I thought of turning you in.

1317
01:24:02,702 --> 01:24:05,190
I thought of blackmailing you
into respecting me.

1318
01:24:15,036 --> 01:24:17,034
It means that much to you?

1319
01:24:18,903 --> 01:24:20,901
It does, doesn't it?

1320
01:24:22,702 --> 01:24:24,870
You've really been alone up here,
haven't you?

1321
01:24:26,636 --> 01:24:28,634
<i>You haven't had anyone
to comfort you.</i>

1322
01:24:29,903 --> 01:24:32,421
And I should ask you
for forgiveness.

1323
01:24:40,869 --> 01:24:42,867
<i>Still friends?</i>

1324
01:25:11,869 --> 01:25:13,434
Sorry. Are you asleep?

1325
01:25:13,435 --> 01:25:15,433
No.

1326
01:25:15,669 --> 01:25:17,667
<i>Want me to leave?</i>

1327
01:25:17,802 --> 01:25:19,800
No, I was just resting.

1328
01:25:20,069 --> 01:25:23,106
Awful lot to do
here in Dogville considering...

1329
01:25:24,903 --> 01:25:27,450
nobody needs anything done.

1330
01:25:29,669 --> 01:25:32,067
Jason wants to sit
on my lap all the time.

1331
01:25:36,903 --> 01:25:39,091
I think you're doing a wonderful job.

1332
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:43,837
<i>You give us all so much.</i>

1333
01:25:44,203 --> 01:25:46,890
What Mr. McKay said,
right on the button.

1334
01:25:47,336 --> 01:25:49,334
Right on the button.

1335
01:25:50,236 --> 01:25:52,403
He tried to put his hand
on my knee today.

1336
01:25:52,769 --> 01:25:54,817
Well, he's blind, after all.

1337
01:25:55,169 --> 01:25:57,187
It was probably an accident.

1338
01:26:00,802 --> 01:26:02,735
Ma Ginger

1339
01:26:02,736 --> 01:26:06,742
got angry at me
for running across the gravel path.

1340
01:26:09,569 --> 01:26:12,906
Well, good.
She gets angry at me.

1341
01:26:13,435 --> 01:26:15,202
<i>Mmm.</i>

1342
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:17,201
It just means you're one of us now.

1343
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:19,517
You can see through it all,
can't you?

1344
01:26:36,636 --> 01:26:39,064
I tell you, I'm gonna be asleep
in two minutes.

1345
01:26:39,469 --> 01:26:42,277
What if I don't want you
to go to sleep?

1346
01:26:42,736 --> 01:26:45,014
I don't think you have
a choice tonight.

1347
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:58,550
I do love you, Grace.

1348
01:27:00,369 --> 01:27:03,846
I'm glad you love me,
I love you too.

1349
01:27:04,402 --> 01:27:06,400
<i>I really do.</i>

1350
01:27:10,535 --> 01:27:12,783
I mean I yearn for you when...

1351
01:27:13,169 --> 01:27:15,167
when I'm not with you.

1352
01:27:17,802 --> 01:27:19,940
Hmm...

1353
01:27:20,302 --> 01:27:23,809
I yearn for you even when we're...
alone like this.

1354
01:27:27,103 --> 01:27:30,349
I yearn to be even closer to you,

1355
01:27:30,869 --> 01:27:33,147
to touch you the way
that people--

1356
01:27:33,535 --> 01:27:36,402
We have our whole lives
ahead of us.

1357
01:27:39,435 --> 01:27:43,561
The thing that I love about you is
that you don't demand anything of me,

1358
01:27:44,203 --> 01:27:48,069
that we can just-- just be together.

1359
01:27:48,669 --> 01:27:50,717
- Yeah.
- Oh...

1360
01:27:51,069 --> 01:27:54,375
Yearning
will only make it better.

1361
01:28:02,602 --> 01:28:04,600
<i>Thank you for your...</i>

1362
01:28:04,636 --> 01:28:07,593
<i>your words,
your wise, wise words.</i>

1363
01:28:10,402 --> 01:28:12,400
You're welcome.

1364
01:28:15,435 --> 01:28:17,433
You want your shoes off?

1365
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:39,458
CHAPTER SIX
in which Dogville bares its teeth.

1366
01:28:43,269 --> 01:28:45,347
Jason, what are you doing here?

1367
01:28:46,669 --> 01:28:48,717
That's wrong.

1368
01:28:49,069 --> 01:28:51,067
The words have to be
divided differently.

1369
01:28:53,903 --> 01:28:55,701
Stop it!

1370
01:28:55,702 --> 01:28:57,920
How's that for dividing
the words?

1371
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:02,936
This is not a good day.
Everybody should leave.

1372
01:29:03,402 --> 01:29:06,329
Everybody except Jason.
Jason, I want to talk to you alone.

1373
01:29:06,802 --> 01:29:09,729
<i>What is it?
What's going on?</i>

1374
01:29:11,535 --> 01:29:13,703
- I can be very bad.
- What...?

1375
01:29:14,069 --> 01:29:15,768
Bet my Pa told you.

1376
01:29:15,769 --> 01:29:17,767
I don't think that.

1377
01:29:17,802 --> 01:29:19,800
I think there is
another reason for this.

1378
01:29:21,469 --> 01:29:23,717
I would love to have you
on my lap all the time

1379
01:29:24,103 --> 01:29:26,101
but I can't,
not with the others here.

1380
01:29:28,302 --> 01:29:31,959
When somebody can't do all the things
they'd like to do for others,

1381
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:35,282
sometimes the people
they promised get mad.

1382
01:29:36,903 --> 01:29:39,071
That's what Mrs. Henson says.

1383
01:29:41,369 --> 01:29:43,268
Yes, that's true.

1384
01:29:43,269 --> 01:29:45,817
I suppose I know why you won't let me
sit in your lap anymore.

1385
01:29:47,235 --> 01:29:49,233
- Why?
<i>- Because I've been mean lately.</i>

1386
01:29:49,302 --> 01:29:53,578
Oh, come on, I'm sure you have
your reasons for that.

1387
01:29:54,235 --> 01:29:56,233
I've been mean to the others too.

1388
01:29:56,435 --> 01:29:58,773
Even baby Achilles.

1389
01:29:59,168 --> 01:30:01,796
And he's so tiny,
he can't put up a fight.

1390
01:30:04,003 --> 01:30:06,310
- It's not right.
- No, it's not.

1391
01:30:06,702 --> 01:30:08,700
I got it coming to me.

1392
01:30:09,636 --> 01:30:12,563
- I know, I deserve a spanking.
- What?

1393
01:30:13,036 --> 01:30:16,462
I should hit you?
I'm not gonna do that.

1394
01:30:17,003 --> 01:30:20,129
Your mother doesn't believe in physical
discipline, I'm not gonna hit you.

1395
01:30:20,636 --> 01:30:24,112
I know. She'd be awful mad
if she found out you whipped me.

1396
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:27,656
Oh-- I just said I won't do that, so...

1397
01:30:28,135 --> 01:30:30,883
It's good
having Ma on your side, right?

1398
01:30:32,369 --> 01:30:34,737
<i>It would be pretty serious
if she turned against you.</i>

1399
01:30:35,135 --> 01:30:38,352
I am the way I am. if people
in this town don't like me, then...

1400
01:30:38,869 --> 01:30:41,526
there's nothing I can do about that.

1401
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:43,967
I feel bad, I need to be punished.

1402
01:30:44,269 --> 01:30:47,576
In fact, I wouldn't have any respect for
you if you didn't give me a spanking.

1403
01:30:48,102 --> 01:30:50,500
I don't care how much fun
you think it would be

1404
01:30:50,903 --> 01:30:53,041
I'm not gonna spank you, Jason.

1405
01:30:54,836 --> 01:30:57,004
In that case...

1406
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:00,846
when Ma gets home... maybe I'll just
have to tell her you hit me.

1407
01:31:01,402 --> 01:31:02,935
But I just said that I wouldn't.

1408
01:31:02,936 --> 01:31:06,272
<i>I reckon Ma'll take my word for it.</i>

1409
01:31:06,802 --> 01:31:09,819
If you give me that spanking,
nobody's ever have to know.

1410
01:31:16,335 --> 01:31:18,333
Stop it. Get away from Achilles.
Stop it!

1411
01:31:19,969 --> 01:31:22,276
I gave his crib a shove.

1412
01:31:22,669 --> 01:31:25,596
- Not my fault it didn't tip over.
- Don't you touch him.

1413
01:31:26,068 --> 01:31:28,066
Move away from the crib.
Stop it, Jason!

1414
01:31:28,202 --> 01:31:30,370
Stop it!
All right, you want a spanking?

1415
01:31:30,736 --> 01:31:33,133
I'll give you a spanking.
Come here. Come here.

1416
01:31:36,302 --> 01:31:38,300
There... there we go.

1417
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:41,936
That wasn't hard. It's got to be hard
or it isn't punishment.

1418
01:31:42,502 --> 01:31:45,399
- All right.
- Harder.

1419
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:49,368
Oh, this is-- Come on!

1420
01:31:49,369 --> 01:31:51,387
That's enough.
That's enough punishment now.

1421
01:31:51,736 --> 01:31:54,453
Maybe I should go stand in the corner
and be ashamed?

1422
01:31:54,903 --> 01:31:58,029
I don't care! Stand in the corner,
do whatever you're gonna do.

1423
01:31:58,535 --> 01:32:00,533
<i>Hey, there's Pa!</i>

1424
01:32:05,235 --> 01:32:07,201
He's early...
I hope nothing's wrong.

1425
01:32:07,202 --> 01:32:09,660
<i>Just as Dogville
had done from its open,</i>

1426
01:32:10,068 --> 01:32:13,815
<i>frail shelf on the mountainside, quite
unprotected from any capricious storms,</i>

1427
01:32:14,402 --> 01:32:17,769
<i>- Grace too had laid herself open.</i>
- Ma Ginger says...

1428
01:32:18,302 --> 01:32:21,079
<i>And there she dangled
from her frail stalk</i>

1429
01:32:21,535 --> 01:32:23,992
<i>like the apple in the Garden of Eden,</i>

1430
01:32:24,402 --> 01:32:27,499
<i>an apple so swollen
that the juices almost ran.</i>

1431
01:32:30,135 --> 01:32:33,322
<i>And once again,
the police had come to Dogville.</i>

1432
01:32:35,569 --> 01:32:37,567
<i>I said I'd tell you--</i>

1433
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:40,139
to save Martha
the confusion about the ringing.

1434
01:32:40,535 --> 01:32:42,962
But I forgot.
They're already down by Canyon Road.

1435
01:32:43,369 --> 01:32:46,556
The fellow in the other car is from
the Federal Bureau of investigation.

1436
01:32:47,068 --> 01:32:49,346
- You forgot?
- Yeah.

1437
01:32:49,736 --> 01:32:51,734
<i>- Oh...</i>
- It's the busy time for the apples.

1438
01:32:51,836 --> 01:32:53,701
The FBI.

1439
01:32:53,702 --> 01:32:57,268
They were most interested in hearing
what I'd seen in the past six months.

1440
01:32:57,836 --> 01:33:00,583
<i>Anything related to that
wanted poster.</i>

1441
01:33:01,035 --> 01:33:03,113
They asked me if I'd seen
any signs in the woods

1442
01:33:03,469 --> 01:33:05,807
of anyone camping out there.

1443
01:33:06,202 --> 01:33:08,390
God only knows
what that woman is capable of.

1444
01:33:08,769 --> 01:33:11,076
You know
she is not capable of anything.

1445
01:33:11,469 --> 01:33:13,867
Well, that's what <i>you</i> say.

1446
01:33:14,269 --> 01:33:17,985
It sure didn't sound that way
coming from the laws.

1447
01:33:18,569 --> 01:33:20,787
<i>That's why I felt
I had to tell them what I knew.</i>

1448
01:33:24,002 --> 01:33:26,000
<i>What did you tell them?</i>

1449
01:33:26,269 --> 01:33:29,456
<i>I thought I'd seen something
in the woods recently.</i>

1450
01:33:29,968 --> 01:33:31,966
<i>An item of clothing, to be exact.</i>

1451
01:33:32,102 --> 01:33:35,469
Turned out it was just an old hat
Tom had lost.

1452
01:33:36,002 --> 01:33:38,430
- But could have been this.
<i>- Chuck, give me that.</i>

1453
01:33:38,836 --> 01:33:40,834
Expensive by the feel of it.

1454
01:33:41,102 --> 01:33:43,100
Your initials on it.

1455
01:33:46,168 --> 01:33:49,155
I imagine they'd draw the same
conclusions from this as anybody would.

1456
01:33:49,636 --> 01:33:54,261
I told the laws it will take me no time
at all to find this piece of clothing.

1457
01:33:55,935 --> 01:33:58,213
<i>I reckon we got us 10 minutes,
maybe 15,</i>

1458
01:33:58,602 --> 01:34:00,909
before they start knocking on doors.

1459
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,959
<i>I wouldn't try to run away.</i>

1460
01:34:04,402 --> 01:34:06,400
<i>They're sure to see you.</i>

1461
01:34:06,502 --> 01:34:09,659
- Why would I want to run away, Chuck?
<i>- I wouldn't try to holler either.</i>

1462
01:34:10,168 --> 01:34:13,295
- Why would I want to do that?
<i>- It wasn't me who wanted you here.</i>

1463
01:34:13,802 --> 01:34:16,489
You're far too beautiful
and frail for this place.

1464
01:34:18,102 --> 01:34:20,530
You tricked me into feeling
that I meant something to you.

1465
01:34:20,935 --> 01:34:23,393
It's your own damned fault
I need your respect, Grace.

1466
01:34:23,802 --> 01:34:26,729
- You have my respect, Chuck.
- I want your respect.

1467
01:34:27,202 --> 01:34:29,200
Don't...

1468
01:34:42,202 --> 01:34:44,200
This is wrong.

1469
01:34:45,769 --> 01:34:48,256
If I can force the flowers
to bloom early in spring...

1470
01:34:49,968 --> 01:34:52,276
I can force you.

1471
01:34:52,669 --> 01:34:54,667
Please...

1472
01:35:02,636 --> 01:35:05,413
No! Ow! Stop it!

1473
01:35:05,868 --> 01:35:07,866
Please stop, please.

1474
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:10,200
Please don't, please.

1475
01:35:11,835 --> 01:35:13,883
Please, please, look at me.

1476
01:35:14,235 --> 01:35:16,253
Look at me
and talk to me, please.

1477
01:35:16,602 --> 01:35:18,909
We're friends.
You're my friend.

1478
01:35:21,402 --> 01:35:25,058
- No, no, Grace, we're not.
- Stop it.

1479
01:36:24,435 --> 01:36:26,234
Have you seen Grace?

1480
01:36:26,235 --> 01:36:28,603
She's at my place.

1481
01:36:29,002 --> 01:36:32,039
- She busy?
- Not anymore. Go right in.

1482
01:36:57,168 --> 01:36:59,166
<i>Yet again Grace had made</i>

1483
01:36:59,302 --> 01:37:02,928
<i>a miraculous escape from her pursuers
with the aid of the people of Dogville.</i>

1484
01:37:03,502 --> 01:37:07,098
<i>Everyone had covered up for her,
including Chuck,</i>

1485
01:37:07,668 --> 01:37:10,566
<i>who had to admit
that it was probably Tom's hat</i>

1486
01:37:11,035 --> 01:37:14,102
<i>he'd mistakenly considered
so suspicious.</i>

1487
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:26,167
CHAPTER SEVEN in which Grace
finally gets enough of Dogville,

1488
01:37:26,333 --> 01:37:30,000
leaves the town,
and again sees the light of day.

1489
01:37:30,402 --> 01:37:33,419
<i>That evening, Tom had sensed at once</i>

1490
01:37:33,902 --> 01:37:37,967
<i>that something had taken place,
but had to plead with Grace for ages</i>

1491
01:37:38,602 --> 01:37:40,620
<i>before she finally broke down</i>

1492
01:37:40,968 --> 01:37:42,966
<i>and unburdened herself.</i>

1493
01:37:43,135 --> 01:37:45,101
I have to confront him, I mean...

1494
01:37:45,102 --> 01:37:47,150
- No, no.
<i>- I have no choice.</i>

1495
01:37:47,502 --> 01:37:49,900
- No one will accept what he did to you.
<i>- I don't want you to.</i>

1496
01:37:50,302 --> 01:37:52,989
I came here with all these ideas

1497
01:37:53,435 --> 01:37:56,452
and these stupid prejudices...

1498
01:37:59,335 --> 01:38:02,462
He's not strong, Tom.

1499
01:38:02,968 --> 01:38:05,776
<i>He looks strong, but he's not.</i>

1500
01:38:07,535 --> 01:38:10,492
I'm gonna start looking for a way
to get you out of here.

1501
01:38:23,669 --> 01:38:25,667
<i>The end of the summer had come</i>

1502
01:38:25,769 --> 01:38:29,665
<i>and in Elm Street, the second clutch
of Dogville's scatty squirrels</i>

1503
01:38:30,269 --> 01:38:33,076
<i>scooted in and out of the legs
of children and grown-ups alike,</i>

1504
01:38:33,535 --> 01:38:37,481
<i>searching in vain
for Elm Street's nonexistent elms.</i>

1505
01:38:39,235 --> 01:38:43,271
<i>The heat had turned the soil
among the gooseberry bushes to stone.</i>

1506
01:38:43,901 --> 01:38:47,238
<i>But Grace did not complain.
She threw herself into her work,</i>

1507
01:38:47,769 --> 01:38:52,214
<i>happy that it was something you could
actually grasp between your fingers.</i>

1508
01:38:52,901 --> 01:38:55,589
- Hey, Liz, hey, Vera.
<i>- Better watch out, Grace.</i>

1509
01:38:56,035 --> 01:38:58,553
<i>Vera's got it in for you today.</i>

1510
01:38:58,968 --> 01:39:01,396
What are you talking about?

1511
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:04,199
<i>Maybe you thought
he wouldn't tell me.</i>

1512
01:39:07,569 --> 01:39:09,757
Who?

1513
01:39:10,135 --> 01:39:12,133
You hit Jason.

1514
01:39:14,836 --> 01:39:17,703
- I did.
<i>- How could you do such a thing?</i>

1515
01:39:19,736 --> 01:39:23,921
I know it sounds implausible,
but he was asking for it.

1516
01:39:24,569 --> 01:39:27,875
It's true, Vera,
he's always asking for it.

1517
01:39:29,502 --> 01:39:31,810
I should have done it myself
a long time ago.

1518
01:39:32,202 --> 01:39:33,635
Liz!

1519
01:39:33,636 --> 01:39:35,634
It's your fault,
the way you've spoiled him.

1520
01:39:35,901 --> 01:39:37,899
I know how much
you love him, Vera.

1521
01:39:40,202 --> 01:39:42,134
So do I.

1522
01:39:42,135 --> 01:39:44,213
It won't happen again.

1523
01:39:44,569 --> 01:39:46,567
It really won't--

1524
01:39:46,769 --> 01:39:50,864
I know it won't, because I'll never
leave them with you again.

1525
01:39:51,502 --> 01:39:54,189
<i>That'd be far too dangerous
for any child of mine.</i>

1526
01:39:54,636 --> 01:39:57,972
- I've been tired.
- Well, maybe you should see

1527
01:39:58,502 --> 01:40:00,929
about sleeping at night
like most folks do.

1528
01:40:01,335 --> 01:40:03,942
Sleeping at night?

1529
01:40:04,369 --> 01:40:08,495
Martha saw
a certain Tom Edison Jr.

1530
01:40:09,135 --> 01:40:11,133
Sneak out of her shed

1531
01:40:11,469 --> 01:40:13,657
early this morning.

1532
01:40:18,702 --> 01:40:22,008
Grace, you won't hear anything from me
about whipping that idiot kid.

1533
01:40:22,535 --> 01:40:25,752
<i>I'm also grateful for you for turning
Tom's wandering eye away from my skirts,</i>

1534
01:40:26,269 --> 01:40:29,666
but on the other hand, I expected
more from you than that.

1535
01:40:32,135 --> 01:40:34,852
But if that's the kind of thing
you're after, then I'm sure

1536
01:40:35,302 --> 01:40:38,229
with your innocent looks you'll do
just fine in a place like Dogville.

1537
01:40:38,702 --> 01:40:40,700
It's not what I am after, Liz.

1538
01:40:40,736 --> 01:40:43,453
Oh no? We all saw you
take his hand at the picnic.

1539
01:40:43,901 --> 01:40:46,089
Maybe that wasn't flirting.

1540
01:40:48,002 --> 01:40:51,429
Yes, maybe I was flirting.

1541
01:41:00,569 --> 01:41:03,376
<i>Next day, the weather changed.</i>

1542
01:41:03,835 --> 01:41:07,022
<i>The fog came rolling down
from the mountains.</i>

1543
01:41:07,535 --> 01:41:10,022
<i>And although there were
no sunsets to be seen,</i>

1544
01:41:10,435 --> 01:41:13,622
<i>McKay thought it best
that she sat by him anyway.</i>

1545
01:41:14,135 --> 01:41:17,062
<i>She had sat by Jack McKay
so many times now.</i>

1546
01:41:17,535 --> 01:41:21,221
<i>But Jack had not got better
at judging the distance between them.</i>

1547
01:41:21,801 --> 01:41:26,157
<i>On the contrary, where fingers alone
had previously brushed her young flesh,</i>

1548
01:41:26,835 --> 01:41:29,293
<i>now it was a hand
that remained in place</i>

1549
01:41:29,702 --> 01:41:31,700
<i>throughout the allotted span.</i>

1550
01:41:34,768 --> 01:41:38,924
<i>The hours in the orchard were long now,
for the harvest was underway.</i>

1551
01:41:39,569 --> 01:41:42,995
<i>And Grace had long since given up
arguing with Chuck's perception</i>

1552
01:41:43,535 --> 01:41:47,011
<i>that respect for cultivation,
harvest and fruit</i>

1553
01:41:47,569 --> 01:41:50,905
<i>could be directly measured
in provision of carnality.</i>

1554
01:41:51,435 --> 01:41:54,302
<i>Though reluctant
to leave Grace alone,</i>

1555
01:41:54,768 --> 01:41:58,045
<i>Tom wandered around
quite often now, lost in thought</i>

1556
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:01,636
<i>as he tried to crack the problem
of possible escape.</i>

1557
01:42:02,135 --> 01:42:06,201
<i>And as Grace's wages no longer
found their way to her purse,</i>

1558
01:42:06,835 --> 01:42:08,833
<i>he had stepped in,</i>

1559
01:42:08,835 --> 01:42:11,053
<i>and together
they had triumphantly picked up</i>

1560
01:42:11,435 --> 01:42:15,181
<i>the last of the seven figurines
from Ma Ginger's window.</i>

1561
01:42:25,335 --> 01:42:28,352
- What's the matter?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

1562
01:42:28,835 --> 01:42:32,462
Are the police
on Canyon Road again?

1563
01:42:33,035 --> 01:42:35,053
<i>No...</i>

1564
01:42:37,269 --> 01:42:39,896
this is just girl talk.

1565
01:42:40,335 --> 01:42:43,522
It's funny you should mention
Canyon Road though,

1566
01:42:44,035 --> 01:42:46,433
right, Martha?
She was just there this morning.

1567
01:42:46,835 --> 01:42:48,833
- Yep.
- On the way home from church.

1568
01:42:48,968 --> 01:42:50,966
You see
so much more on foot.

1569
01:42:51,302 --> 01:42:53,300
You know, when you're in a car,

1570
01:42:53,302 --> 01:42:56,838
you never notice
the apple orchard for example.

1571
01:42:58,635 --> 01:43:00,633
You can only see it

1572
01:43:00,735 --> 01:43:03,483
<i>from one spot on Canyon Road.</i>

1573
01:43:03,935 --> 01:43:06,243
<i>- That's right--
- You know that spot, Martha?</i>

1574
01:43:06,635 --> 01:43:08,633
<i>Yes I do. Yep.</i>

1575
01:43:09,801 --> 01:43:11,601
<i>And...</i>

1576
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:14,029
did you stop there to enjoy the view
this morning?

1577
01:43:14,435 --> 01:43:17,332
It's harvest time, you know,
in the orchard, after all.

1578
01:43:17,801 --> 01:43:21,108
The old masters always loved
a good harvest theme,

1579
01:43:21,635 --> 01:43:23,633
<i>redolent with fertility,</i>

1580
01:43:23,968 --> 01:43:26,486
not to mention sensibility,

1581
01:43:26,901 --> 01:43:30,328
or even eroticism.

1582
01:43:33,269 --> 01:43:35,267
But how silly of me

1583
01:43:35,502 --> 01:43:38,569
to ask you that, Martha,
because you already said you did.

1584
01:43:39,068 --> 01:43:41,066
Mmm.

1585
01:43:42,701 --> 01:43:44,839
She saw you, Grace.

1586
01:43:48,735 --> 01:43:51,393
She saw you...

1587
01:43:54,235 --> 01:43:57,542
behind this pile of broken limbs--

1588
01:43:59,102 --> 01:44:01,350
with Chuck.

1589
01:44:04,701 --> 01:44:08,008
He said it wasn't the first time
you'd made advances towards him.

1590
01:44:10,302 --> 01:44:14,218
<i>He never told me before because he
wanted to spare my feelings.</i>

1591
01:44:16,469 --> 01:44:19,126
He's a withdrawn

1592
01:44:19,568 --> 01:44:22,086
and primitive man.

1593
01:44:23,601 --> 01:44:24,867
Vera--

1594
01:44:24,868 --> 01:44:27,296
But at heart, he's loyal!

1595
01:44:27,701 --> 01:44:29,699
And he's good.

1596
01:44:30,002 --> 01:44:32,549
What do you want
with my husband?

1597
01:44:34,068 --> 01:44:37,724
I don't want anything...

1598
01:44:38,302 --> 01:44:40,669
with your husband

1599
01:44:41,068 --> 01:44:43,436
or anybody.

1600
01:44:43,835 --> 01:44:46,413
What about Tom
and the hand-holding at the picnic?

1601
01:44:46,835 --> 01:44:50,172
That's different, I like Tom.

1602
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:52,869
But you don't like Chuck?

1603
01:44:53,235 --> 01:44:55,602
Liz and Martha are behind me

1604
01:44:56,002 --> 01:44:58,749
<i>when I tell you I'm gonna have
to teach you a lesson.</i>

1605
01:44:59,202 --> 01:45:01,979
I believe in education.

1606
01:45:05,668 --> 01:45:07,068
Vera!

1607
01:45:07,068 --> 01:45:09,066
<i>I believe smashing them</i>

1608
01:45:09,102 --> 01:45:11,440
is less a crime than making them.

1609
01:45:13,369 --> 01:45:15,367
<i>Vera, remember</i>

1610
01:45:15,435 --> 01:45:17,433
how I taught your children...

1611
01:45:17,501 --> 01:45:20,249
<i>- What?
-</i> Remember how happy you were...

1612
01:45:20,701 --> 01:45:23,598
<i>- when I taught your children--
-</i> When you what?

1613
01:45:24,068 --> 01:45:27,814
About the doctrine of stoicism
and they finally understood it?

1614
01:45:29,468 --> 01:45:31,806
<i>All right, for that
I'm gonna be lenient,</i>

1615
01:45:32,202 --> 01:45:35,269
I am going to break
two of your figurines first.

1616
01:45:38,235 --> 01:45:41,691
And if you can demonstrate

1617
01:45:42,235 --> 01:45:45,601
your knowledge
of the doctrine of stoicism

1618
01:45:46,135 --> 01:45:48,213
<i>by holding back your tears,</i>

1619
01:45:48,568 --> 01:45:50,566
<i>I'll stop.</i>

1620
01:45:51,968 --> 01:45:53,966
<i>Have you got that?</i>

1621
01:46:06,235 --> 01:46:09,691
<i>In her lifetime,
Grace had had considerable practice</i>

1622
01:46:10,235 --> 01:46:13,192
<i>at constraining her emotions
and would never have believed</i>

1623
01:46:13,668 --> 01:46:15,916
<i>it would be hard
to control them now.</i>

1624
01:46:17,335 --> 01:46:20,082
<i>But as the porcelain
pulverized on the floor,</i>

1625
01:46:20,534 --> 01:46:24,341
<i>it was as if it were
human tissue disintegrating.</i>

1626
01:46:25,968 --> 01:46:28,246
<i>The figurines were the offspring
of the meeting</i>

1627
01:46:28,635 --> 01:46:30,773
<i>between the township and her.</i>

1628
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:34,122
<i>They were the proof
that in spite of everything,</i>

1629
01:46:34,601 --> 01:46:37,848
<i>her suffering had created
something of value.</i>

1630
01:46:38,369 --> 01:46:41,795
<i>Grace could no longer cope.</i>

1631
01:46:42,335 --> 01:46:47,050
<i>For the first time
since her childhood, she wept.</i>

1632
01:47:17,035 --> 01:47:19,552
<i>Grace went to see Tom
that very night</i>

1633
01:47:19,968 --> 01:47:22,425
<i>and informed him that
she was ready to follow his advice</i>

1634
01:47:22,835 --> 01:47:24,833
<i>and leave the township.</i>

1635
01:47:24,935 --> 01:47:27,652
<i>And since Tom
had just made up his mind</i>

1636
01:47:28,102 --> 01:47:31,638
<i>that a third party would be needed
to ensure the success of an escape,</i>

1637
01:47:32,202 --> 01:47:35,189
<i>they agreed that Ben
possessed the greatest potential.</i>

1638
01:47:36,735 --> 01:47:40,511
<i>But it was a case where money
was required, Tom concluded.</i>

1639
01:47:41,102 --> 01:47:44,289
<i>And estimated
that considering the times and all,</i>

1640
01:47:44,801 --> 01:47:47,668
<i>$10 would suffice
for Ben and his truck.</i>

1641
01:47:48,135 --> 01:47:50,133
But we don't have $10.

1642
01:47:50,302 --> 01:47:52,669
Then we borrow it.

1643
01:47:53,068 --> 01:47:55,935
- From whom?
- From Dad.

1644
01:47:56,401 --> 01:47:58,769
He has more than that
in the medicine closet.

1645
01:47:59,168 --> 01:48:01,715
I'll talk to him in the morning,
arrange a loan.

1646
01:48:02,135 --> 01:48:04,133
But you have a word with Ben.

1647
01:48:04,468 --> 01:48:06,776
It's the end of the week,
he's bound to be flat broke.

1648
01:48:08,668 --> 01:48:11,296
Tell your father
that I will pay him back.

1649
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:13,733
Of course!

1650
01:48:17,635 --> 01:48:19,633
Thank you.

1651
01:48:22,468 --> 01:48:25,925
You're always... rescuing me.

1652
01:48:29,668 --> 01:48:32,415
I can't believe you go on
being there for me.

1653
01:48:35,434 --> 01:48:37,432
Good night.

1654
01:48:39,568 --> 01:48:41,566
<i>You should get some sleep.</i>

1655
01:48:50,368 --> 01:48:53,026
<i>Grace went to see Ben next morning.</i>

1656
01:48:54,635 --> 01:48:56,853
Ben?

1657
01:48:57,235 --> 01:48:59,233
<i>When Grace
presented the payment</i>

1658
01:48:59,568 --> 01:49:03,225
<i>as compensation between friends,
Ben did not object too heartily,</i>

1659
01:49:03,801 --> 01:49:06,958
<i>considering the trouble he could receive
from the rest of the townspeople</i>

1660
01:49:07,468 --> 01:49:09,606
<i>when they realized
what had happened.</i>

1661
01:49:09,968 --> 01:49:13,244
<i>Perhaps they'd all be relieved
that she was out of their lives,</i>

1662
01:49:13,768 --> 01:49:16,725
<i>but somehow
Grace wasn't too sure of that.</i>

1663
01:49:17,202 --> 01:49:20,418
<i>Ben agreed to drive her,
even though he wasn't out to profit</i>

1664
01:49:20,935 --> 01:49:23,862
<i>from other folks' misfortunes,
as he put it.</i>

1665
01:49:24,334 --> 01:49:27,052
I don't want to profit
from other folks' misfortunes.

1666
01:49:27,501 --> 01:49:28,634
No.

1667
01:49:28,635 --> 01:49:32,531
<i>The fact was Ben would have driven
to the gates of hell and back for $10.</i>

1668
01:49:33,135 --> 01:49:37,051
<i>And the criminal aspect bugged him less
than Grace would ever have guessed.</i>

1669
01:49:37,668 --> 01:49:41,005
<i>He had freighted
all kinds of things in his day.</i>

1670
01:49:41,534 --> 01:49:44,811
<i>The plan was for Grace
to hide among the apples.</i>

1671
01:49:45,334 --> 01:49:47,332
<i>"Knowing the exact time to harvest</i>

1672
01:49:47,601 --> 01:49:49,769
<i>is the greatest art of all, "
Chuck had said.</i>

1673
01:49:50,135 --> 01:49:52,034
<i>And the time had come</i>

1674
01:49:52,035 --> 01:49:54,842
<i>for the apples and for Grace.</i>

1675
01:49:55,301 --> 01:49:57,439
Grace, where you been?
If I'd have displayed

1676
01:49:57,801 --> 01:49:59,879
the same indifference
to the timing of my chores,

1677
01:50:00,234 --> 01:50:03,042
I'd be in for a whipping.
Now get a move on!

1678
01:50:03,501 --> 01:50:07,188
I'm sorry, Olivia,
I had to talk to Ben about something--

1679
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:08,968
June is near to bursting.

1680
01:50:08,968 --> 01:50:11,275
She can't use the pot on her own,
as you well know.

1681
01:50:11,668 --> 01:50:15,125
It ain't fittin' to toy with her 'cause
she crippled and can't help herself.

1682
01:50:19,601 --> 01:50:23,257
<i>The evening before the escape,
Tom tactically thought it best</i>

1683
01:50:23,835 --> 01:50:27,022
<i>not to press his desires of the flesh
too hard upon Grace.</i>

1684
01:50:28,501 --> 01:50:32,337
<i>And instead, he adopted
a more sensitive approach.</i>

1685
01:50:34,468 --> 01:50:38,035
There's a right and a wrong time
to plant seeds.

1686
01:50:38,601 --> 01:50:40,599
You can't plant seeds in the winter.

1687
01:50:42,401 --> 01:50:44,399
That's true,

1688
01:50:44,468 --> 01:50:46,466
but I love you...

1689
01:50:46,501 --> 01:50:48,609
- I know.
- ...and you love me.

1690
01:50:48,968 --> 01:50:52,154
And we will meet again
in love and in freedom.

1691
01:50:52,668 --> 01:50:55,066
Absolutely.

1692
01:50:55,468 --> 01:50:57,466
I shouldn't be ashamed
wanting you, should I?

1693
01:50:57,768 --> 01:51:00,665
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- No.

1694
01:51:01,135 --> 01:51:02,400
I know.

1695
01:51:02,401 --> 01:51:05,328
No, it's lovely.
It's lovely that we want each other.

1696
01:51:07,534 --> 01:51:09,842
- But not this way.
- No.

1697
01:51:10,234 --> 01:51:12,372
It's not right.

1698
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:24,349
<i>The next morning, when Grace</i>

1699
01:51:24,701 --> 01:51:27,308
<i>wanted to slip down
to Ben's as invisibly as possible,</i>

1700
01:51:27,735 --> 01:51:30,282
<i>it seemed to Grace
that the entire township</i>

1701
01:51:30,701 --> 01:51:33,099
<i>was out and about
at the same time.</i>

1702
01:51:33,501 --> 01:51:35,869
- Grace?
- Yes, Vera?

1703
01:51:36,268 --> 01:51:38,576
If you think that by hitting my child,

1704
01:51:38,968 --> 01:51:41,275
you can get out of working
for me, think again.

1705
01:51:41,668 --> 01:51:44,855
Why don't you just
come by as planned and we'll...

1706
01:51:45,368 --> 01:51:47,706
find something where
you won't be able to harm anyone.

1707
01:51:48,101 --> 01:51:50,099
Uh, at... 12:00?

1708
01:51:50,234 --> 01:51:51,867
Yes.

1709
01:51:51,868 --> 01:51:54,935
Why are you taking your copious
belongings around with you?

1710
01:51:55,434 --> 01:51:57,542
<i>Afraid you're gonna lose them?</i>

1711
01:51:57,901 --> 01:52:00,708
Grace, Ben is hauling apples today,
so we won't be loading glasses.

1712
01:52:01,167 --> 01:52:03,165
But that don't mean you're off work.

1713
01:52:03,201 --> 01:52:05,309
Dad wants you to repack
the whole last load.

1714
01:52:05,668 --> 01:52:08,245
Maybe you can do it better
and we'll have an extra crate.

1715
01:52:08,668 --> 01:52:11,275
<i>An old crate like that may not have
much value in your eyes,</i>

1716
01:52:11,701 --> 01:52:13,500
<i>but this is Dogville.</i>

1717
01:52:13,501 --> 01:52:15,499
We're not wealthy here.

1718
01:52:15,735 --> 01:52:17,568
And if your hands get a bit red,

1719
01:52:17,568 --> 01:52:19,906
I've got a tip about something
you can rub on them.

1720
01:52:20,301 --> 01:52:22,034
<i>Grace.</i>

1721
01:52:22,035 --> 01:52:24,172
- Oh, Martha.
- Hi.

1722
01:52:25,601 --> 01:52:28,058
We have to wash the flagstones
at the foot of the steps again.

1723
01:52:28,468 --> 01:52:31,095
<i>Dirt's gone and blown under the door.
I can't get the door open--</i>

1724
01:52:31,534 --> 01:52:33,532
Where have you been?

1725
01:52:33,801 --> 01:52:36,019
Harvest is the holiest time of the year.

1726
01:52:36,401 --> 01:52:39,029
Doesn't that sound like something
you could have said?

1727
01:52:39,468 --> 01:52:42,655
I'll be down in a minute, Chuck.

1728
01:52:43,167 --> 01:52:46,824
- I'll bring the crates down.
- Good.

1729
01:52:47,401 --> 01:52:50,009
<i>As Grace hastened
to the garage, she grew</i>

1730
01:52:50,434 --> 01:52:54,790
<i>more and more pleased with the decision
to keep her departure under wraps.</i>

1731
01:52:55,468 --> 01:52:59,944
<i>There was actually quite a bit of work
Dogville didn't need doing,</i>

1732
01:53:00,635 --> 01:53:04,141
<i>that its residents would have
to carry out for themselves in future.</i>

1733
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:07,188
Grace, I don't like having to say this,

1734
01:53:07,601 --> 01:53:10,878
but I'd like to ask if I could have
the money up front.

1735
01:53:11,401 --> 01:53:14,968
See, it's always the way
in the freight industry--

1736
01:53:15,534 --> 01:53:18,191
once you deliver a load,
you ain't got much to bargain with,

1737
01:53:18,635 --> 01:53:21,472
<i>- if you catch my drift.</i>
- Of course, here's the money.

1738
01:53:21,935 --> 01:53:24,242
Not that this is a professional job,
of course.

1739
01:53:24,635 --> 01:53:27,882
- Don't get out, till I give the say-so.
- All right, Ben.

1740
01:53:49,401 --> 01:53:52,528
<i>Canyon Road
snaked down the valley and away</i>

1741
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:55,372
<i>and Grace went too.</i>

1742
01:53:55,768 --> 01:53:57,533
<i>And with every bend,</i>

1743
01:53:57,534 --> 01:53:59,433
<i>the township and its noises</i>

1744
01:53:59,434 --> 01:54:02,011
<i>faded ever more mercifully
behind her.</i>

1745
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:54,532
- Something wrong?
- Yeah.

1746
01:54:55,001 --> 01:54:57,958
There are a hell of a lot
of police up ahead.

1747
01:54:59,568 --> 01:55:02,115
I wasn't expecting that.

1748
01:55:02,534 --> 01:55:05,191
It's more dangerous than I thought.

1749
01:55:05,635 --> 01:55:08,352
We'll have to go back.

1750
01:55:08,801 --> 01:55:10,500
- Back?
- Yeah.

1751
01:55:10,501 --> 01:55:13,428
- No, we can't do that.
- No, but--

1752
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:16,298
it's just, if this was a--

1753
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:18,809
- a professional transport job--
- No, Ben.

1754
01:55:19,167 --> 01:55:21,775
Paid proper like,
it would be a lot easier.

1755
01:55:24,468 --> 01:55:26,516
But it's been paid for.

1756
01:55:26,868 --> 01:55:29,765
Yeah, but in the freight industry

1757
01:55:30,234 --> 01:55:32,422
carrying a dangerous load,

1758
01:55:32,801 --> 01:55:34,799
it costs more.

1759
01:55:35,801 --> 01:55:38,608
A surcharge, they call it.

1760
01:55:39,067 --> 01:55:41,675
If this were a professional job,

1761
01:55:42,101 --> 01:55:45,088
I could just charge you.

1762
01:55:47,835 --> 01:55:50,582
But, Ben,
I don't have any more money.

1763
01:55:55,368 --> 01:55:58,435
Oh, that's no good then.

1764
01:56:02,101 --> 01:56:04,099
You said once...

1765
01:56:04,401 --> 01:56:06,399
you said once

1766
01:56:06,468 --> 01:56:08,865
that there aren't
many pleasures in my life.

1767
01:56:12,434 --> 01:56:15,061
You know I go to Miss Laura
once a week.

1768
01:56:15,501 --> 01:56:17,267
Yes.

1769
01:56:17,268 --> 01:56:20,255
And you, you got me to see that

1770
01:56:20,735 --> 01:56:23,482
it weren't nothing to be ashamed of.

1771
01:56:25,201 --> 01:56:27,539
And see...

1772
01:56:27,934 --> 01:56:31,181
I was gonna go there tonight.

1773
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:37,437
And of course, it costs me.

1774
01:56:42,201 --> 01:56:45,038
Not as much as--

1775
01:56:45,501 --> 01:56:49,717
not as much as a surcharge for--

1776
01:56:50,368 --> 01:56:52,366
for dangerous goods,

1777
01:56:52,468 --> 01:56:54,466
but still...

1778
01:56:55,967 --> 01:56:58,365
it does cost me, you know.

1779
01:56:58,768 --> 01:57:01,635
- No, Ben, no, please don't.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1780
01:57:02,101 --> 01:57:05,118
It's not personal, Grace,
it's not personal.

1781
01:57:05,601 --> 01:57:07,998
- I just...
- No.

1782
01:57:08,401 --> 01:57:10,828
I have to take due payment,
that's all.

1783
01:57:12,234 --> 01:57:15,421
- I don't have a choice.
- No, Ben.

1784
01:57:15,934 --> 01:57:18,652
I can't buck the freight industry,
can I?

1785
01:57:19,101 --> 01:57:22,198
- No.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1786
01:57:22,701 --> 01:57:25,478
We're parked in the square
in Georgetown.

1787
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:28,898
Right outside the church.

1788
01:57:29,134 --> 01:57:31,911
You'd better keep your voice down.

1789
01:57:35,601 --> 01:57:37,599
No, Ben.

1790
01:57:37,668 --> 01:57:41,064
This ain't something
I'm proud of, Grace.

1791
01:57:41,601 --> 01:57:44,118
Don't go thinking that.

1792
01:58:16,034 --> 01:58:18,402
<i>Grace fell asleep
on the long highway,</i>

1793
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,908
<i>thanks to her healthy ability</i>

1794
01:58:21,268 --> 01:58:24,165
<i>to push any unpleasantness
around her far away.</i>

1795
01:58:24,635 --> 01:58:27,502
<i>A generous God had blessed her
with the rare talent</i>

1796
01:58:27,967 --> 01:58:29,965
<i>of being able to look ahead</i>

1797
01:58:30,067 --> 01:58:32,065
<i>and only ahead.</i>

1798
01:58:33,767 --> 01:58:35,765
<i>And later
when the truck slowed down</i>

1799
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:37,898
<i>about to reach its destination</i>

1800
01:58:38,001 --> 01:58:40,459
<i>and she slowly returned
to consciousness,</i>

1801
01:58:40,867 --> 01:58:43,824
<i>she had no way of knowing
how long she had slept.</i>

1802
01:58:44,301 --> 01:58:48,277
<i>All she knew was that she would be happy
to see the light of day again.</i>

1803
01:58:50,268 --> 01:58:54,654
<i>And then she heard the dog.</i>

1804
01:59:00,067 --> 01:59:03,104
All your fondness for apples
seems less and less believable, see?

1805
01:59:03,601 --> 01:59:05,599
You bruised them.

1806
01:59:18,368 --> 01:59:21,235
We had a meeting last night
at the mission house.

1807
01:59:23,834 --> 01:59:26,991
They said you might be
gonna try to run away.

1808
01:59:27,501 --> 01:59:29,519
So when I discovered you'd--

1809
01:59:29,867 --> 01:59:32,055
hidden yourself away on my truck...

1810
01:59:33,501 --> 01:59:36,428
I didn't have no choice
but to bring you back to Dogville.

1811
01:59:38,834 --> 01:59:40,912
In the freight industry
we can't take sides.

1812
02:00:25,301 --> 02:00:27,299
<i>It didn't help Grace</i>

1813
02:00:27,368 --> 02:00:29,705
<i>that the first theft
ever registered in Dogville</i>

1814
02:00:30,101 --> 02:00:32,099
<i>had taken place
the previous evening</i>

1815
02:00:32,201 --> 02:00:34,918
<i>when most people were assembled
for the town meeting.</i>

1816
02:00:35,368 --> 02:00:38,734
<i>Old Tom Edison Sr.
had had a considerable sum of money</i>

1817
02:00:39,268 --> 02:00:42,694
<i>stolen from his medicine closet,
and suspicion soon fell on Grace,</i>

1818
02:00:43,234 --> 02:00:45,422
<i>who had apparently been
planning an escape</i>

1819
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:47,908
<i>that would surely require funding.</i>

1820
02:00:49,234 --> 02:00:51,232
<i>Grace chose to remain silent</i>

1821
02:00:51,501 --> 02:00:53,638
<i>in the face of these new charges.</i>

1822
02:00:54,967 --> 02:00:58,653
<i>And then Bill, who had lately
improved his engineering skills</i>

1823
02:00:59,234 --> 02:01:02,630
<i>to an astonishing degree,
had by way of his first design</i>

1824
02:01:03,167 --> 02:01:06,533
<i>implemented a kind
of escape prevention mechanism.</i>

1825
02:01:07,067 --> 02:01:09,554
<i>Beautiful, it might not have been,</i>

1826
02:01:09,967 --> 02:01:13,094
<i>but effective, he dared say it was.</i>

1827
02:01:23,634 --> 02:01:25,682
Grace,

1828
02:01:26,034 --> 02:01:28,661
we don't like having to do this.

1829
02:01:29,101 --> 02:01:31,239
<i>We don't have much of a choice,</i>

1830
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:34,088
<i>if we're to protect our community.</i>

1831
02:01:34,501 --> 02:01:36,638
Could you,
would you mind moving?

1832
02:01:37,001 --> 02:01:38,999
Try moving?

1833
02:01:58,667 --> 02:02:00,665
It works.

1834
02:02:00,967 --> 02:02:02,985
We had to make this heavy enough

1835
02:02:03,334 --> 02:02:05,641
<i>so that it could only move...</i>

1836
02:02:06,034 --> 02:02:07,866
<i>where the ground is level,</i>

1837
02:02:07,867 --> 02:02:10,385
<i>and the ground is level in town.</i>

1838
02:02:15,934 --> 02:02:18,392
May I go now?

1839
02:02:23,667 --> 02:02:26,854
I have to figure out
how I'm gonna get into my house.

1840
02:02:29,401 --> 02:02:32,767
Or is that part of the punishment,
having to sleep outdoors?

1841
02:02:33,301 --> 02:02:35,698
Oh, no, no, no, no, Grace.

1842
02:02:36,101 --> 02:02:38,528
Don't think of this as punishment,

1843
02:02:38,934 --> 02:02:41,152
not at all.

1844
02:02:41,533 --> 02:02:44,341
See, Bill, he made
the chain long enough

1845
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:47,048
<i>so that you can sleep in your bed.</i>

1846
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:59,598
Grace, 6:00.

1847
02:03:02,301 --> 02:03:05,138
Yes, Mrs. Henson.

1848
02:03:12,083 --> 02:03:16,333
CHAPTER EIGHT in which there is
a meeting where the truth is told

1849
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:19,917
and Tom leaves
(only to return later).

1850
02:03:28,767 --> 02:03:30,845
I'm...

1851
02:03:33,334 --> 02:03:35,701
I couldn't run the risk
of Dad turning me down.

1852
02:03:36,101 --> 02:03:38,908
They think it was me
that took the money.

1853
02:03:39,368 --> 02:03:42,025
'Cause I told them so.

1854
02:03:45,634 --> 02:03:47,632
You did what?

1855
02:03:47,767 --> 02:03:50,984
First, they suspected me, but then
I convinced them that it was you

1856
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:53,988
since you were the one
using the medicine closet.

1857
02:03:55,367 --> 02:03:56,967
Why?

1858
02:03:56,967 --> 02:03:59,215
It's good I'm here
to do the thinking for you.

1859
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:02,557
If we are to have the slightest chance
of getting you out of here...

1860
02:04:04,467 --> 02:04:07,454
they can never know
how close we really are.

1861
02:04:09,001 --> 02:04:12,158
They can't know
I'm trying to help you.

1862
02:04:14,301 --> 02:04:16,348
If they knew it was me
that took the money,

1863
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:19,068
I wouldn't be here
talking to you now.

1864
02:04:21,334 --> 02:04:24,291
Please, don't disappear, Tom.

1865
02:04:30,268 --> 02:04:32,985
I need you.

1866
02:04:35,367 --> 02:04:37,365
<i>I'll break this one
with some thinking.</i>

1867
02:04:48,533 --> 02:04:50,551
<i>It was not Grace's pride</i>

1868
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:53,447
<i>that kept her going
during the days when fall came</i>

1869
02:04:53,867 --> 02:04:55,865
<i>and the trees
were losing their leaves,</i>

1870
02:04:56,201 --> 02:04:58,628
<i>but more of the trancelike state
that descends</i>

1871
02:04:59,034 --> 02:05:01,282
<i>on animals
whose lives are threatened,</i>

1872
02:05:01,667 --> 02:05:04,155
<i>a state in which the body
reacts mechanically,</i>

1873
02:05:04,567 --> 02:05:08,663
<i>in a low, tough gear,
without too much painful reflection,</i>

1874
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:13,486
<i>like a patient passively
letting his disease hold sway.</i>

1875
02:05:14,134 --> 02:05:17,261
<i>And now that Vera
had received proof</i>

1876
02:05:17,767 --> 02:05:19,765
<i>that it was in fact Chuck</i>

1877
02:05:19,934 --> 02:05:24,120
<i>who'd forced his attentions on Grace,
she was meaner than ever.</i>

1878
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:30,068
<i>Had Grace had friends in Dogville,</i>

1879
02:05:30,433 --> 02:05:33,300
<i>they too fell like the leaves.</i>

1880
02:05:35,067 --> 02:05:37,145
<i>Most townspeople of the male sex</i>

1881
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:39,498
<i>now visited Grace at night</i>

1882
02:05:39,634 --> 02:05:41,712
<i>to fulfill their sexual needs.</i>

1883
02:05:43,567 --> 02:05:46,025
<i>It had occurred to the children
to give the bell an extra ring</i>

1884
02:05:46,433 --> 02:05:49,420
<i>every time such an act
had been consummated...</i>

1885
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:52,417
<i>much to Martha's confusion.</i>

1886
02:05:54,001 --> 02:05:56,169
<i>But since the chain
had been attached,</i>

1887
02:05:56,533 --> 02:05:59,161
<i>things had become easier
for everyone.</i>

1888
02:06:00,567 --> 02:06:04,074
<i>The harassments in bed did not have
to be kept so secret anymore,</i>

1889
02:06:04,634 --> 02:06:07,471
<i>because they couldn't really
be compared to a sexual act.</i>

1890
02:06:07,934 --> 02:06:10,361
<i>They were embarrassing,
in the way it is</i>

1891
02:06:10,767 --> 02:06:12,765
<i>when a hillbilly has his way
with a cow,</i>

1892
02:06:13,034 --> 02:06:15,032
<i>but no more than that.</i>

1893
02:06:16,267 --> 02:06:19,284
<i>Tom saw everything.
It pained him.</i>

1894
02:06:19,767 --> 02:06:23,044
<i>And the sexual visits
were a particularly severe blow.</i>

1895
02:06:23,567 --> 02:06:25,565
Good night.

1896
02:06:30,333 --> 02:06:33,370
<i>But he supported her
as best he could,</i>

1897
02:06:33,867 --> 02:06:35,865
<i>the way a spider supports</i>

1898
02:06:36,067 --> 02:06:39,663
<i>when it has been tangled
in its own web by the wind.</i>

1899
02:06:40,233 --> 02:06:42,751
<i>Tom.</i>

1900
02:06:48,567 --> 02:06:51,085
Everything I tried to do
went wrong.

1901
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:55,567
I can't come up with the answer
I was looking for.

1902
02:06:56,067 --> 02:06:58,494
You'll come up with it, you'll see.

1903
02:06:58,900 --> 02:07:01,357
You're very clever.

1904
02:07:02,734 --> 02:07:04,732
I provoked them.

1905
02:07:05,067 --> 02:07:07,254
I wouldn't worry about it.

1906
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,897
We provoked them, now it's time
for us to provoke ourselves.

1907
02:07:16,433 --> 02:07:18,431
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

1908
02:07:20,134 --> 02:07:23,610
by showing them some trust.
It all started with a meeting,

1909
02:07:24,166 --> 02:07:27,004
so it would be logical
to end it with one too.

1910
02:07:27,467 --> 02:07:30,944
You'll talk, they'll listen.
They can't refuse to listen.

1911
02:07:32,967 --> 02:07:37,063
- What will I say?
- Everything, you'll say everything.

1912
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:39,698
<i>- Everything?</i>
- Yeah, the truth, the truth,

1913
02:07:40,034 --> 02:07:42,811
just the truth
about each and every one of them.

1914
02:07:43,267 --> 02:07:45,265
I don't think
they're gonna want to hear that.

1915
02:07:45,467 --> 02:07:48,424
No, I know, I know.
It's like a child...

1916
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:51,477
who doesn't want
to take his medicine.

1917
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:55,436
They'll be furious at first,
but in the end, they'll see that it's--

1918
02:07:56,001 --> 02:07:57,999
it's for their own good.

1919
02:07:58,267 --> 02:08:00,265
Just don't be hateful.

1920
02:08:00,367 --> 02:08:02,765
Don't be reproving.

1921
02:08:03,166 --> 02:08:06,443
If anybody can do it,
Grace, you can.

1922
02:08:06,967 --> 02:08:11,352
They'll all realize that this web
of misunderstanding and injustice

1923
02:08:12,034 --> 02:08:14,281
has only one true victim
and that's you.

1924
02:08:14,667 --> 02:08:18,064
And from there it's only
one small step to forgiveness.

1925
02:08:19,567 --> 02:08:23,873
You've done some hard thinking,
Tom Edison.

1926
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:28,587
I'm sure it's an excellent plan.

1927
02:08:29,067 --> 02:08:31,114
I'm sure.

1928
02:08:49,533 --> 02:08:52,400
<i>if forgiveness
was close at hand in the mission house,</i>

1929
02:08:52,867 --> 02:08:55,764
<i>they were all hiding it well.</i>

1930
02:08:56,233 --> 02:08:59,100
<i>It hadn't been easy for Tom
to get them there.</i>

1931
02:08:59,567 --> 02:09:01,615
<i>Appealing to consciences</i>

1932
02:09:01,967 --> 02:09:05,363
<i>stowed farther and farther away
by their owners every day,</i>

1933
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:09,376
<i>as if they were as fragile
as Henson's glasses after polishing,</i>

1934
02:09:09,934 --> 02:09:11,932
<i>had proved quite a task.</i>

1935
02:09:13,267 --> 02:09:16,604
<i>But if one was going, the others
might as well come along too--</i>

1936
02:09:17,133 --> 02:09:19,351
<i>so nobody could talk
behind anybody's back.</i>

1937
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:25,008
<i>Tom had set the scene
for Grace's speech.</i>

1938
02:09:25,467 --> 02:09:28,564
<i>Now, she'd have to sink or swim</i>

1939
02:09:29,066 --> 02:09:31,934
<i>and sincerity be brought to bear.</i>

1940
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:34,398
<i>While Grace addressed</i>

1941
02:09:34,667 --> 02:09:37,444
<i>the silent congregation
in the mission house on Elm Street,</i>

1942
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:41,796
<i>the first of the early autumn
snowstorms embraced the town.</i>

1943
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:45,677
<i>The snowflakes dusted down
over the old buildings</i>

1944
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:48,858
<i>as if this were just any old town.</i>

1945
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:51,298
<i>And they played
in the branches and twigs,</i>

1946
02:09:51,634 --> 02:09:53,632
<i>from which the apples had hung.</i>

1947
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:55,698
<i>But luckily the harvest was home</i>

1948
02:09:55,967 --> 02:09:58,274
<i>and, via the freight industry,
had found a market</i>

1949
02:09:58,667 --> 02:10:01,004
<i>despite the ever-disappointing prices.</i>

1950
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:04,267
<i>Grace had presented
her story with clarity.</i>

1951
02:10:04,734 --> 02:10:07,421
<i>She had not embellished
or understated.</i>

1952
02:10:07,867 --> 02:10:12,432
<i>And just as she finished, the snowflakes
all at once stopped tumbling down,</i>

1953
02:10:13,133 --> 02:10:16,500
<i>leaving Dogville
clad in the daintiest,</i>

1954
02:10:17,033 --> 02:10:19,931
<i>whitest blanket of snow
imaginable.</i>

1955
02:10:27,166 --> 02:10:29,164
Hmph.

1956
02:10:40,033 --> 02:10:42,081
I don't think it went very well.

1957
02:10:42,433 --> 02:10:45,500
It's fine. You did good.

1958
02:10:52,867 --> 02:10:56,783
<i>The snow had
come early, perhaps too early--</i>

1959
02:10:57,400 --> 02:11:00,767
<i>a misplaced augury
of conciliation?</i>

1960
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:04,608
<i>Tom looked around, worried.</i>

1961
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,597
<i>Vera's teeth were clenched.
She was the first to speak.</i>

1962
02:11:09,166 --> 02:11:11,504
Copious lies, just lies.

1963
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,507
Yes, Tom, that didn't
accord with the perception

1964
02:11:14,933 --> 02:11:16,931
that I have of this town
and its residents.

1965
02:11:17,267 --> 02:11:20,694
I'm a doctor, damn it. I'm capable
of determining if I'm sick or not.

1966
02:11:21,233 --> 02:11:23,231
What do you have to say
for yourself, Tom?

1967
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:25,698
Maybe it's time you picked sides.

1968
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:28,208
Are you for us or against us?

1969
02:11:28,567 --> 02:11:31,374
Liz is right, we've been
far too indulgent with Tom.

1970
02:11:31,834 --> 02:11:35,170
<i>Tom, I got to tell you,
even I have trouble defending that girl.</i>

1971
02:11:35,700 --> 02:11:40,115
With your help, which I prefer
to think was accidental, Tom,

1972
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,576
she's been managed
to spread bitterness

1973
02:11:45,166 --> 02:11:48,643
and trouble throughout
this whole town. She has to go!

1974
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:50,898
<i>How do we get rid of her, Tom?</i>

1975
02:11:50,899 --> 02:11:53,037
<i>- How do we do it, Tom?
- I agree, Tom.</i>

1976
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:56,057
You brought her in here, you have
to figure out how to get her out.

1977
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,498
Without her lies
and accusations spreading.

1978
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:04,098
I asked you here to listen.

1979
02:12:07,233 --> 02:12:09,691
You only came
to defend yourselves.

1980
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:14,256
I'm sorry. It's quite a blow to me,

1981
02:12:14,899 --> 02:12:18,995
to see all of my friends
act this way...

1982
02:12:21,866 --> 02:12:23,974
so uncivilized.

1983
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:21,117
Your plan didn't work out
very well, did it?

1984
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,836
- You'll think of another one.
- No.

1985
02:13:27,433 --> 02:13:30,590
No more plans, I promise.

1986
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:39,287
They asked me to choose
between you and them.

1987
02:13:41,567 --> 02:13:45,373
That's not difficult
on a day like today, I love you.

1988
02:13:45,966 --> 02:13:49,972
You may be stronger,
it's true, with the ideals,

1989
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:52,598
the ideals we share.

1990
02:13:53,933 --> 02:13:56,361
I'm exhausted.

1991
02:13:58,300 --> 02:14:00,438
Lie down.

1992
02:14:06,899 --> 02:14:09,037
I've chosen, Grace,

1993
02:14:10,667 --> 02:14:13,034
I've chosen you.

1994
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,548
And now it's the time,

1995
02:14:19,966 --> 02:14:22,803
the time we've been waiting for.

1996
02:14:26,866 --> 02:14:29,733
We've freed ourselves of Dogville.

1997
02:14:35,733 --> 02:14:38,361
You're right.

1998
02:14:38,799 --> 02:14:42,546
You're right, Tom, it would be
so easy to make love right now.

1999
02:14:44,667 --> 02:14:47,124
They may kill us any minute,

2000
02:14:47,533 --> 02:14:50,190
it would be the perfect
romantic ending--

2001
02:14:50,634 --> 02:14:52,632
You know I feel it too.

2002
02:14:57,200 --> 02:15:00,067
It would be so beautiful,
but from...

2003
02:15:00,533 --> 02:15:04,748
from the point of view of our love,
so completely wrong.

2004
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,368
We were to meet in freedom.

2005
02:15:25,567 --> 02:15:27,874
You're cold now, Grace.

2006
02:15:37,766 --> 02:15:41,832
I just rejected everybody
I've ever known in your favor.

2007
02:15:44,166 --> 02:15:47,003
Wouldn't it be worth compromising
just one of your ideals

2008
02:15:47,467 --> 02:15:50,044
just a little to ease my pain?

2009
02:15:53,233 --> 02:15:56,070
<i>Everybody in this town
has had your body but me.</i>

2010
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:00,087
We're the ones
supposed to be in love.

2011
02:16:02,833 --> 02:16:04,831
<i>My darting Tom.</i>

2012
02:16:08,933 --> 02:16:11,421
You can have me if you want me.

2013
02:16:15,133 --> 02:16:17,131
Just do what the others do.

2014
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:20,847
Threaten me.

2015
02:16:21,233 --> 02:16:24,390
<i>Tell me that you'll turn me in
to the law, to the gangsters,</i>

2016
02:16:24,899 --> 02:16:27,387
and I promise you,

2017
02:16:27,799 --> 02:16:31,226
you can take
whatever it is you want from me.

2018
02:16:33,333 --> 02:16:35,551
I trust you.

2019
02:16:37,733 --> 02:16:40,481
But maybe you don't trust yourself.

2020
02:16:40,933 --> 02:16:44,360
Perhaps you've been tempted.

2021
02:16:44,899 --> 02:16:47,966
You've been tempted
to join the others and force me?

2022
02:16:48,467 --> 02:16:51,564
Perhaps that's why you're so upset.

2023
02:16:52,066 --> 02:16:54,144
All I've ever tried to do is help you.

2024
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:59,325
I'm just asking if you're afraid
you could be so human.

2025
02:17:00,066 --> 02:17:02,284
No, I'm not afraid of that,
not in the least.

2026
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:06,098
Good.

2027
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:13,006
Let tomorrow bring
what it's gonna bring.

2028
02:17:15,866 --> 02:17:17,864
It's not a crime

2029
02:17:18,166 --> 02:17:20,793
to doubt yourself, Tom.

2030
02:17:23,666 --> 02:17:26,763
But it's wonderful that you don't.

2031
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:30,607
I can't find the rest.

2032
02:17:33,833 --> 02:17:36,321
I think I should go out
for a couple of minutes.

2033
02:17:38,633 --> 02:17:41,471
Take a walk
or something to get it--

2034
02:17:43,633 --> 02:17:46,121
get it all out of my system.

2035
02:17:48,066 --> 02:17:50,144
Trudge the streets,

2036
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:52,667
listen to the wind as it passes

2037
02:17:53,033 --> 02:17:55,660
through the woods
up through the valley

2038
02:17:56,100 --> 02:17:58,348
and all that.

2039
02:18:01,766 --> 02:18:03,764
You go to sleep though.

2040
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:09,278
You go to sleep

2041
02:18:09,633 --> 02:18:12,121
and I'll be back

2042
02:18:12,532 --> 02:18:14,640
very soon.

2043
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,517
<i>Of course,
it was all a load of nonsense.</i>

2044
02:18:24,933 --> 02:18:29,289
<i>If anybody was capable of keeping
track of ideals and reality, he was.</i>

2045
02:18:29,966 --> 02:18:32,743
<i>After all, it was his job.</i>

2046
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:36,007
<i>Moral issues were his home ground.</i>

2047
02:18:36,467 --> 02:18:39,503
<i>To think that he might
doubt his own purity</i>

2048
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,078
<i>was really to think
very little of him.</i>

2049
02:18:42,433 --> 02:18:45,060
<i>Tom was angry.</i>

2050
02:18:47,799 --> 02:18:50,816
<i>And in the midst of it all,
he discovered why.</i>

2051
02:18:52,333 --> 02:18:54,850
<i>It was not because
he'd been wrongly accused,</i>

2052
02:18:55,267 --> 02:18:57,814
<i>but because the charges
were true.</i>

2053
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:02,756
<i>His anger consisted
of a most unpleasant feeling</i>

2054
02:19:03,267 --> 02:19:05,544
<i>of being found out.</i>

2055
02:19:08,233 --> 02:19:11,010
<i>It was all quite a blow
to the young philosopher.</i>

2056
02:19:11,466 --> 02:19:13,544
<i>And realistically enough,</i>

2057
02:19:13,899 --> 02:19:16,067
<i>he thought that if the doubt
was already present,</i>

2058
02:19:16,433 --> 02:19:19,300
<i>it could grow perhaps so great</i>

2059
02:19:19,766 --> 02:19:24,012
<i>that one day it would prove detrimental
to his entire moral mission.</i>

2060
02:19:24,666 --> 02:19:26,914
<i>Tom stopped.</i>

2061
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:29,517
<i>He almost began to shake
when the threat</i>

2062
02:19:29,899 --> 02:19:32,387
<i>to his career as a writer
dawned upon him.</i>

2063
02:19:32,799 --> 02:19:35,317
<i>It didn't take him long
to agree with himself</i>

2064
02:19:35,733 --> 02:19:38,011
<i>that the risk was
too great to run.</i>

2065
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:40,767
<i>The danger
Grace was to the town,</i>

2066
02:19:41,166 --> 02:19:43,164
<i>she was also to him.</i>

2067
02:19:43,466 --> 02:19:45,464
<i>Tom did not like it</i>

2068
02:19:45,466 --> 02:19:49,333
<i>and he was man enough
to take action to prevent it.</i>

2069
02:19:51,833 --> 02:19:56,249
<i>Fortunately, Tom was as conscientious
as regards his future profession</i>

2070
02:19:56,933 --> 02:19:58,931
<i>as he was practical.</i>

2071
02:19:58,933 --> 02:20:02,589
<i>He allowed sincerity and ideals
plenty of room in his life</i>

2072
02:20:03,166 --> 02:20:06,822
<i>without getting sentimental
about it, as he would put it.</i>

2073
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:10,876
<i>Throwing away a document
that might be of significance to Tom,</i>

2074
02:20:11,432 --> 02:20:13,540
<i>and with him
future generations of readers,</i>

2075
02:20:13,899 --> 02:20:16,676
<i>as a basis of a novel
or indeed a trilogy</i>

2076
02:20:17,133 --> 02:20:19,880
<i>was not an act
he was so stupid to commit.</i>

2077
02:20:20,333 --> 02:20:23,260
<i>Although he had to admit
that in a moment of weakness</i>

2078
02:20:23,733 --> 02:20:25,751
<i>he might have said he would.</i>

2079
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,367
<i>Before returning
to the meeting that night,</i>

2080
02:20:31,766 --> 02:20:35,482
<i>Tom opened the little drawer he had
opened the night of Grace's arrival</i>

2081
02:20:36,066 --> 02:20:38,403
<i>and found it still there--</i>

2082
02:20:38,799 --> 02:20:41,546
<i>the card from the gangster
in the car.</i>

2083
02:21:02,666 --> 02:21:06,123
<i>The next day, the sun was
shining in the brisk autumn sky</i>

2084
02:21:06,666 --> 02:21:08,854
<i>and the snow was
long since gone.</i>

2085
02:21:10,866 --> 02:21:12,864
<i>For the first time for ages</i>

2086
02:21:13,066 --> 02:21:15,373
<i>the pile driver could be heard
in the marshlands</i>

2087
02:21:15,766 --> 02:21:17,764
<i>as it hammered in the piles</i>

2088
02:21:17,866 --> 02:21:21,372
<i>of what might
or might not be a penitentiary.</i>

2089
02:21:21,933 --> 02:21:23,931
<i>Grace opened her eyes,</i>

2090
02:21:24,267 --> 02:21:27,573
<i>after an almost unconscious sleep
and was confused...</i>

2091
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:30,997
<i>Judging by the light coming
through the cracks in the walls</i>

2092
02:21:31,466 --> 02:21:34,653
<i>it had to be nearly midday,
"the gray hour"</i>

2093
02:21:35,166 --> 02:21:38,502
<i>as Jack McKay, for some reason,
called noon in Dogville...</i>

2094
02:21:39,033 --> 02:21:41,690
<i>being a man of many ideas
and proclivities,</i>

2095
02:21:42,133 --> 02:21:45,849
<i>quite a few of which Grace would have
preferred to remain ignorant of.</i>

2096
02:21:46,432 --> 02:21:49,120
<i>But why had nobody roused her?</i>

2097
02:21:49,566 --> 02:21:52,054
<i>Nobody had hammered
furiously at her door,</i>

2098
02:21:52,466 --> 02:21:54,804
<i>not a child had thrown
mud into her bed</i>

2099
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,657
<i>or broken
her remaining windowpanes.</i>

2100
02:21:58,066 --> 02:22:00,343
<i>Now she remembered.</i>

2101
02:22:00,733 --> 02:22:03,221
<i>She recalled
the meeting the previous day</i>

2102
02:22:03,633 --> 02:22:05,741
<i>and puzzled still more.</i>

2103
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:09,197
<i>Why had she not been confronted
with the outcome of that meeting</i>

2104
02:22:09,699 --> 02:22:11,697
<i>or even killed?</i>

2105
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,998
<i>It was quite unlike Dogville</i>

2106
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:16,977
<i>to restrain its indignation
on any point.</i>

2107
02:22:17,432 --> 02:22:19,950
<i>Perhaps things had
turned out well after all.</i>

2108
02:22:20,366 --> 02:22:23,763
- Good morning, Mrs. Henson,
- Oh, morning.

2109
02:22:24,299 --> 02:22:26,907
I would have come earlier, but I--

2110
02:22:27,332 --> 02:22:29,099
<i>I overslept.</i>

2111
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:32,027
Oh, never mind, Liz put
her back into it this morning.

2112
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:36,537
We thought some time off
would be good for you.

2113
02:22:40,299 --> 02:22:42,297
That was quite a speech
you made yesterday.

2114
02:22:42,399 --> 02:22:44,567
Gave us all something
to think about.

2115
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,747
- Hello, Liz.
- Hi, Grace.

2116
02:22:53,566 --> 02:22:55,564
Hi.

2117
02:22:59,499 --> 02:23:01,497
I overslept.

2118
02:23:02,299 --> 02:23:04,297
Morning, Miss Grace.

2119
02:23:05,232 --> 02:23:07,230
- Good morning.
- How you this morning?

2120
02:23:08,799 --> 02:23:11,606
- I overslept.
- Oh, that's all right.

2121
02:23:19,432 --> 02:23:21,298
It's Grace.

2122
02:23:21,299 --> 02:23:23,377
Hello, Grace.

2123
02:23:23,733 --> 02:23:25,731
Two seconds.

2124
02:23:25,833 --> 02:23:27,831
Good news.

2125
02:23:36,432 --> 02:23:38,430
I went back
to the meeting last night.

2126
02:23:40,399 --> 02:23:42,737
I wasn't gonna let them
get <i>off</i> so easy, but...

2127
02:23:45,499 --> 02:23:47,497
I'll be damned if the mood
hadn't changed.

2128
02:23:49,599 --> 02:23:51,597
I wouldn't say we won exactly,
not exactly,

2129
02:23:51,833 --> 02:23:54,170
but I think something very good
could come out of this--

2130
02:23:54,566 --> 02:23:58,602
- Why didn't you come back and tell me?
- No, I did, I did, but you were asleep.

2131
02:24:00,199 --> 02:24:02,197
And you looked like you needed it.

2132
02:24:03,366 --> 02:24:06,024
That made me suggest that maybe
you should have some time off.

2133
02:24:06,466 --> 02:24:08,514
And you know,

2134
02:24:08,866 --> 02:24:10,864
not one single person objected.

2135
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:18,907
- That sounds wonderful.
- I know it does, doesn't it?

2136
02:24:20,566 --> 02:24:23,313
The people in this town,
they surprise me again and again.

2137
02:24:25,432 --> 02:24:28,120
I might even have to revise
my theories a little bit.

2138
02:24:28,566 --> 02:24:30,754
You know how much I hate
doing that kind of thing.

2139
02:24:33,599 --> 02:24:36,816
You know, Grace, last night
when I came back

2140
02:24:37,332 --> 02:24:39,350
and I saw you

2141
02:24:39,699 --> 02:24:42,067
lying there asleep so sweetly,

2142
02:24:42,466 --> 02:24:44,464
I was suddenly inspired.

2143
02:24:44,799 --> 02:24:47,836
I wrote the first chapter of a story--

2144
02:24:48,332 --> 02:24:50,580
a story about a small town.

2145
02:24:50,966 --> 02:24:53,074
Guess where I got the inspiration?

2146
02:24:53,432 --> 02:24:56,119
<i>But I haven't come up with a name
for the town yet.</i>

2147
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,998
Why not just call it Dogville?

2148
02:25:00,033 --> 02:25:03,369
It wouldn't work, wouldn't work,
it's got to be universal.

2149
02:25:03,899 --> 02:25:06,037
A lot of writers
make that mistake, you see.

2150
02:25:06,399 --> 02:25:09,296
<i>- Hey, you want me to read it to you?
-</i> Uh...

2151
02:25:09,766 --> 02:25:11,784
if there's any love in it,
it comes from you.

2152
02:25:12,132 --> 02:25:14,130
Would you be offended
if I said no?

2153
02:25:16,199 --> 02:25:19,856
- No.
- If I really have the day to myself...

2154
02:25:20,432 --> 02:25:22,830
No, no.

2155
02:25:24,332 --> 02:25:26,330
Two people will
only hurt each other

2156
02:25:26,399 --> 02:25:28,767
if they doubt the love
they have in one another.

2157
02:25:30,833 --> 02:25:32,831
You can read it some other time.

2158
02:25:34,399 --> 02:25:35,999
You sit down some place,

2159
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,077
gaze out at the mountains.

2160
02:25:38,432 --> 02:25:40,570
It's what
the girl in my novel does.

2161
02:25:43,799 --> 02:25:45,565
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

2162
02:25:45,566 --> 02:25:47,564
I'll see you. Good news.

2163
02:25:53,399 --> 02:25:56,056
<i>Sensibly,
Grace chose to hope for the best,</i>

2164
02:25:56,499 --> 02:25:58,497
<i>rather than fear the worst,</i>

2165
02:25:58,532 --> 02:26:00,198
<i>and planned to spend the day</i>

2166
02:26:00,199 --> 02:26:02,277
<i>calmly washing her clothes
and herself--</i>

2167
02:26:02,633 --> 02:26:05,730
<i>which for some reason or another
she was sure none of the characters</i>

2168
02:26:06,232 --> 02:26:09,509
<i>from Tom's fictitious township
would dream of doing.</i>

2169
02:26:13,799 --> 02:26:17,635
<i>And then it was
as if Dogville just waited.</i>

2170
02:26:18,232 --> 02:26:20,660
<i>Even the wind dropped,</i>

2171
02:26:21,065 --> 02:26:23,873
<i>leaving the town
in an unfamiliar calm,</i>

2172
02:26:24,332 --> 02:26:28,718
<i>as if somebody had put
a large cheese-dish cover over it</i>

2173
02:26:29,399 --> 02:26:32,206
<i>and created the kind of quietness</i>

2174
02:26:32,666 --> 02:26:36,032
<i>that descends
while you're awaiting visitors.</i>

2175
02:26:36,566 --> 02:26:40,252
<i>After two days off
Grace had been put back to work,</i>

2176
02:26:40,833 --> 02:26:44,139
<i>but the quietness remained.</i>

2177
02:26:44,666 --> 02:26:47,243
<i>Indeed, it intensified.</i>

2178
02:26:47,666 --> 02:26:49,854
<i>Until on the fifth day...</i>

2179
02:26:50,232 --> 02:26:53,249
<i>it swelled into a strange mood</i>

2180
02:26:53,733 --> 02:26:57,479
<i>that all of a sudden brought all
the citizens to the street to listen.</i>

2181
02:27:00,332 --> 02:27:03,959
<i>They asked each other
if the phone was really still down,</i>

2182
02:27:04,532 --> 02:27:07,629
<i>or if they'd heard about Ben
having had to turn his truck around</i>

2183
02:27:08,132 --> 02:27:10,130
<i>on his way to Georgetown
that very morning</i>

2184
02:27:10,299 --> 02:27:13,256
<i>on account of a large tree
blocking the road.</i>

2185
02:27:13,733 --> 02:27:16,130
<i>They were not worried.</i>

2186
02:27:16,532 --> 02:27:18,610
<i>Worried was not the right word.</i>

2187
02:27:19,933 --> 02:27:22,420
<i>And then Tom spotted the cars.</i>

2188
02:27:22,833 --> 02:27:24,498
- How many cars?
- Eight, eight.

2189
02:27:24,499 --> 02:27:26,837
Tom has binoculars
but you can see them with the naked eye.

2190
02:27:27,232 --> 02:27:29,690
- There must be at least eight.
- I thought the road was blocked.

2191
02:27:30,099 --> 02:27:32,177
They must have come through
before the tree came down.

2192
02:27:35,499 --> 02:27:38,716
June's bed! The sheets need changing.
I'll be there in a minute.

2193
02:27:39,232 --> 02:27:41,920
- Hello, June.
- Shh.

2194
02:27:43,766 --> 02:27:47,192
<i>Grace had just started on
the bed which June had soiled yet again,</i>

2195
02:27:47,733 --> 02:27:51,978
<i>when an irritating feeling of wasting
her time forced itself upon her.</i>

2196
02:27:54,132 --> 02:27:57,199
<i>And it was without thinking
she then said the words...</i>

2197
02:27:57,699 --> 02:28:00,006
Nobody gonna sleep here.

2198
02:28:04,733 --> 02:28:06,731
<i>She didn't say them out loud</i>

2199
02:28:06,965 --> 02:28:10,002
<i>but even so,
was startled by the utterance</i>

2200
02:28:10,499 --> 02:28:12,607
<i>that had urged itself upon her.</i>

2201
02:28:14,566 --> 02:28:17,283
<i>Where had these
ominous words come from?</i>

2202
02:28:26,999 --> 02:28:31,245
<i>Darkness was falling as Grace made
her way home from work that evening.</i>

2203
02:28:31,898 --> 02:28:34,526
<i>The people on the square
overlooking the valley</i>

2204
02:28:34,965 --> 02:28:39,091
<i>had finally given up hope of seeing
anything else now the light had faded.</i>

2205
02:28:39,733 --> 02:28:42,750
<i>They trudged up Elm Street
in disappointment.</i>

2206
02:28:47,898 --> 02:28:49,732
- Tom.
- Hi, Grace.

2207
02:28:49,733 --> 02:28:51,751
There were some cars, but--

2208
02:28:52,099 --> 02:28:54,097
too dark, we can't see anymore.

2209
02:28:54,432 --> 02:28:57,499
We haven't seen
much of each other.

2210
02:28:57,999 --> 02:29:00,487
Yeah, I know. I've been busy
with my book, you know.

2211
02:29:00,898 --> 02:29:03,036
<i>Can I ask you something?</i>

2212
02:29:03,399 --> 02:29:05,417
<i>Yeah, anything.</i>

2213
02:29:08,733 --> 02:29:11,130
You couldn't bring yourself
to throw it away, could you?

2214
02:29:13,599 --> 02:29:16,176
<i>The number he gave you that night,
you couldn't throw it away.</i>

2215
02:29:16,599 --> 02:29:20,025
I told you how dangerous
that man was.

2216
02:29:20,566 --> 02:29:22,564
That was stupid.

2217
02:29:28,332 --> 02:29:30,440
<i>Stupid or not, Tom was soon</i>

2218
02:29:30,799 --> 02:29:33,895
<i>a passionate spokesman for
locking Grace in her shed that night.</i>

2219
02:29:36,399 --> 02:29:38,886
<i>If the vehicles were indeed
a sign that the call</i>

2220
02:29:39,299 --> 02:29:42,226
<i>Tom had placed five days earlier
on behalf of the community</i>

2221
02:29:42,699 --> 02:29:45,446
<i>to the number indicated
on the card from his bureau drawer</i>

2222
02:29:45,898 --> 02:29:47,896
<i>had at last led to action</i>

2223
02:29:48,132 --> 02:29:50,819
<i>and Grace was now
to be eliminated from their lives,</i>

2224
02:29:51,266 --> 02:29:54,832
<i>it would surely look good
if the town had also locked her up.</i>

2225
02:29:57,466 --> 02:30:00,892
<i>Grace was lying on the bed
when Jason was sent up with the key.</i>

2226
02:30:01,432 --> 02:30:03,680
<i>Grace heard it turn in the lock,</i>

2227
02:30:04,065 --> 02:30:07,222
<i>but she was deeply absorbed
by arguments and thoughts</i>

2228
02:30:07,733 --> 02:30:11,918
<i>on matters she had otherwise avoided
for the best part of a year now.</i>

2229
02:30:20,333 --> 02:30:27,667
CHAPTER NINE in which Dogville receives
the long-awaited visit and the film ends.

2230
02:30:31,332 --> 02:30:34,049
<i>From the moment when they'd finally
heard the sound of vehicles</i>

2231
02:30:34,499 --> 02:30:37,456
<i>starting one after the other from
the direction of the edge of the woods,</i>

2232
02:30:37,932 --> 02:30:40,040
<i>things had moved rapidly.</i>

2233
02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:44,345
<i>Tom had arranged a delegation
to provide a proper reception.</i>

2234
02:30:44,965 --> 02:30:50,060
<i>Dogville might be off the beaten track,
but it was hospitable, nonetheless.</i>

2235
02:31:03,832 --> 02:31:05,797
Welcome, gentlemen, welcome.

2236
02:31:05,798 --> 02:31:08,016
The town places itself
at your disposal.

2237
02:31:08,399 --> 02:31:11,416
I should have a large key to give you,
but I only have this small one.

2238
02:31:11,898 --> 02:31:13,896
- Where is she?
- Secured by this very key.

2239
02:31:14,065 --> 02:31:15,632
Where is she?

2240
02:31:15,633 --> 02:31:18,969
Okay-- if you're wondering
about that sound,

2241
02:31:19,499 --> 02:31:22,216
they're driving piles
for the new penitentiary.

2242
02:31:22,666 --> 02:31:25,413
Tell me, has the crime rate
really gone up in this country

2243
02:31:25,865 --> 02:31:27,863
as we're led to believe?

2244
02:31:27,898 --> 02:31:30,965
Maybe people just regard
things as criminal because, uh,

2245
02:31:31,466 --> 02:31:33,923
because they envy their success.

2246
02:31:34,332 --> 02:31:37,019
What's your opinion
on the subject?

2247
02:31:38,466 --> 02:31:41,123
Maybe you have none.
I'll get the door.

2248
02:31:41,566 --> 02:31:43,674
<i>- </i> Sorry.

2249
02:31:45,865 --> 02:31:47,943
Voila, as the French might say.

2250
02:31:48,299 --> 02:31:50,726
What the hell is this?

2251
02:31:51,132 --> 02:31:52,232
Who did that?

2252
02:31:52,232 --> 02:31:55,099
Billy, put your hand up!
Put your hand up!

2253
02:31:55,566 --> 02:31:57,498
Who's Billy? Come on,
just get your tools.

2254
02:31:57,499 --> 02:31:59,607
- It's okay.
- It's gonna be all right.

2255
02:32:04,199 --> 02:32:06,197
We felt safer
when she had the chain on.

2256
02:32:06,399 --> 02:32:09,386
You're probably more adept
at handling her kind.

2257
02:32:11,099 --> 02:32:13,676
None of us feel able

2258
02:32:14,099 --> 02:32:16,097
to accept money
for just helping people.

2259
02:32:16,399 --> 02:32:20,754
I mean, unless it would make you feel
better to divest yourself--

2260
02:32:21,432 --> 02:32:23,430
- Shut the hell up!
- Absolutely.

2261
02:32:28,399 --> 02:32:31,616
<i>Grace was no expert
in exclusive automobiles,</i>

2262
02:32:32,132 --> 02:32:34,590
<i>yet she recognized
with no difficulty</i>

2263
02:32:34,999 --> 02:32:37,397
<i>the sound of the vehicle
that was rounding the corner</i>

2264
02:32:37,798 --> 02:32:40,076
<i>from Canyon Road
at that very moment.</i>

2265
02:32:41,466 --> 02:32:43,464
<i>Alas, in Grace's memory</i>

2266
02:32:43,698 --> 02:32:47,355
<i>the legendary purr
of the Cadillac series 355 C</i>

2267
02:32:47,932 --> 02:32:52,528
<i>was inextricably linked with another
rather less sophisticated sound...</i>

2268
02:32:53,232 --> 02:32:56,419
<i>that of gunfire
directed against her person.</i>

2269
02:33:20,932 --> 02:33:22,930
Don't!

2270
02:33:46,665 --> 02:33:50,142
You need to justify your actions
before you shoot us?

2271
02:33:52,199 --> 02:33:54,197
That's new.

2272
02:33:58,165 --> 02:34:00,163
That could be interpreted
as weakness, Daddy.

2273
02:34:00,432 --> 02:34:02,799
<i>I'm disappointed in you.</i>

2274
02:34:03,199 --> 02:34:06,506
- I didn't come to shoot anybody.
<i>- You shot at me before.</i>

2275
02:34:07,032 --> 02:34:09,030
<i>Yes.</i>

2276
02:34:10,565 --> 02:34:12,873
<i>And so I regret that...</i>

2277
02:34:13,266 --> 02:34:15,264
<i>you ran away.</i>

2278
02:34:15,499 --> 02:34:19,395
But shooting at you
certainly didn't help matters.

2279
02:34:19,999 --> 02:34:22,247
Of course not,
you're far, far too stubborn.

2280
02:34:26,032 --> 02:34:28,200
If you don't want to kill me
then why did you come?

2281
02:34:28,565 --> 02:34:31,343
Our last conversation,
the one in which you told me what it was

2282
02:34:31,798 --> 02:34:35,774
you didn't like about me,
never really concluded, as you ran away.

2283
02:34:36,399 --> 02:34:39,585
I should be allowed to tell you
what I don't like about you.

2284
02:34:40,099 --> 02:34:44,894
That, I believe, would be a rule
of polite conversation, no?

2285
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:47,630
That's why you showed up?

2286
02:34:51,032 --> 02:34:53,400
And you call <i>me</i> stubborn?

2287
02:34:53,798 --> 02:34:57,714
You're sure you're not here to force me
to go back and become like you?

2288
02:34:58,332 --> 02:35:00,549
If I thought there was
a chance of forcing you...

2289
02:35:00,932 --> 02:35:04,119
but of course,
that would never happen.

2290
02:35:04,632 --> 02:35:07,879
You're more-- more than welcome

2291
02:35:08,399 --> 02:35:12,524
to return home,
become my daughter again anytime,

2292
02:35:13,165 --> 02:35:16,671
and I would even begin

2293
02:35:17,232 --> 02:35:22,447
<i>to share my power and responsibility
with you if you did.</i>

2294
02:35:23,232 --> 02:35:27,587
- Not that you care--
- So what is it?

2295
02:35:28,266 --> 02:35:31,073
What is it, the thing, the thing
that you don't like about me?

2296
02:35:31,531 --> 02:35:33,779
It was a word you used
that provoked me.

2297
02:35:34,165 --> 02:35:36,213
You called me arrogant.

2298
02:35:36,565 --> 02:35:39,752
To plunder, as it were, a God-given
right. I'd call that arrogant, Daddy.

2299
02:35:40,266 --> 02:35:43,452
But that is exactly
what I don't like about you.

2300
02:35:43,965 --> 02:35:47,122
- It's <i>you</i> that is arrogant.
- That's what you came here to say?

2301
02:35:51,332 --> 02:35:54,868
I'm not the one passing judgment, Daddy,
<i>you</i> are.

2302
02:35:55,432 --> 02:35:58,149
No, <i>you</i> do not pass judgment

2303
02:35:58,598 --> 02:36:02,225
because you sympathize with them.
A deprived childhood,

2304
02:36:02,798 --> 02:36:06,984
and a homicide really isn't
necessarily a homicide, right?

2305
02:36:07,632 --> 02:36:10,439
The only thing you can blame
is circumstances--

2306
02:36:10,898 --> 02:36:13,326
rapists and murderers

2307
02:36:13,732 --> 02:36:15,664
may be the victims,
according to you,

2308
02:36:15,665 --> 02:36:18,273
but I, I call them dogs.

2309
02:36:18,698 --> 02:36:20,696
And if they're lapping up
their own vomit,

2310
02:36:20,965 --> 02:36:22,963
the only way to stop them
is with the lash.

2311
02:36:23,165 --> 02:36:25,163
But dogs only obey
their own nature,

2312
02:36:25,431 --> 02:36:27,479
so why shouldn't
we forgive them?

2313
02:36:27,832 --> 02:36:31,109
Dogs can be taught
many useful things,

2314
02:36:31,632 --> 02:36:35,548
but not if we forgive them
every time they obey their own nature.

2315
02:36:48,165 --> 02:36:50,163
So I'm arrogant?

2316
02:36:50,366 --> 02:36:52,733
I'm arrogant
because I forgive people.

2317
02:36:53,132 --> 02:36:55,130
My God,

2318
02:36:55,165 --> 02:36:58,122
can't you see how condescending
you are when you say that?

2319
02:36:59,565 --> 02:37:03,022
I mean you have--
you have this preconceived notion

2320
02:37:03,565 --> 02:37:07,481
that nobody, listen-- that nobody
can possibly attain

2321
02:37:08,099 --> 02:37:11,905
the same high ethical standards as you,
so you exonerate them.

2322
02:37:12,498 --> 02:37:14,131
I cannot--

2323
02:37:14,132 --> 02:37:17,149
I cannot think of anything
more arrogant than that.

2324
02:37:17,632 --> 02:37:20,669
You, my child, my dear child,

2325
02:37:21,165 --> 02:37:23,303
you forgive others with excuses

2326
02:37:23,665 --> 02:37:26,033
that you would never in the world
permit for yourself.

2327
02:37:26,431 --> 02:37:29,009
Why shouldn't I be merciful? Why?

2328
02:37:29,431 --> 02:37:32,149
<i>No, no, no, you should,
you should be merciful</i>

2329
02:37:32,598 --> 02:37:34,786
<i>when there's time to be merciful.</i>

2330
02:37:35,165 --> 02:37:37,163
But, you must maintain
your own standards.

2331
02:37:37,465 --> 02:37:40,333
You owe them that,
you owe them that.

2332
02:37:40,798 --> 02:37:44,364
The penalty you deserve
for your transgression,

2333
02:37:44,932 --> 02:37:46,930
they deserve
for their transgressions.

2334
02:37:47,232 --> 02:37:49,509
- They're human beings, Dad.
- No, no, no, of course--

2335
02:37:49,898 --> 02:37:52,855
<i>but does every human being need to be
accountable for their actions?</i>

2336
02:37:53,331 --> 02:37:55,819
Of course they do, but you
don't even give them that chance.

2337
02:37:56,232 --> 02:37:58,569
And that is extremely arrogant.

2338
02:37:58,965 --> 02:38:02,032
I love you, I love you,
I love you to death,

2339
02:38:02,531 --> 02:38:05,928
but you are the most arrogant
person I have ever met.

2340
02:38:06,465 --> 02:38:08,923
And you call me arrogant.

2341
02:38:12,898 --> 02:38:14,896
I...

2342
02:38:15,099 --> 02:38:17,376
I have no more to say.

2343
02:38:19,431 --> 02:38:22,588
You're arrogant, I'm arrogant,
you've said it, now you can leave.

2344
02:38:23,099 --> 02:38:25,646
And without my daughter
I suppose.

2345
02:38:30,165 --> 02:38:32,163
<i>Hmm?</i>

2346
02:38:32,431 --> 02:38:34,619
- I said without my daughter.
- Mm, yes.

2347
02:38:36,365 --> 02:38:38,733
<i>- Well?</i>
- Yes!

2348
02:38:39,132 --> 02:38:41,180
You decide, you decide.

2349
02:38:44,498 --> 02:38:46,397
Grace, they--

2350
02:38:46,398 --> 02:38:48,476
they say you're having
some trouble here.

2351
02:38:50,032 --> 02:38:52,030
No.

2352
02:38:52,265 --> 02:38:54,373
No more trouble than back home.

2353
02:38:54,732 --> 02:38:57,040
I'm gonna give you a little time
to think about this,

2354
02:38:57,431 --> 02:39:00,298
<i>- perhaps you'll change your mind.</i>
- I won't.

2355
02:39:00,765 --> 02:39:02,763
<i>Listen, my love,</i>

2356
02:39:03,065 --> 02:39:05,282
<i>power is not so bad.</i>

2357
02:39:05,665 --> 02:39:08,682
I am sure that you can

2358
02:39:09,165 --> 02:39:11,792
find a way to make use of it
in your own fashion.

2359
02:39:14,965 --> 02:39:17,542
Take a walk and think about it.

2360
02:39:17,965 --> 02:39:19,963
The people who live here...

2361
02:39:21,832 --> 02:39:23,830
are doing their best

2362
02:39:24,032 --> 02:39:28,038
under very hard circumstances.

2363
02:39:28,665 --> 02:39:30,663
If you say so, Grace.

2364
02:39:33,032 --> 02:39:35,689
<i>But is their best...</i>

2365
02:39:38,065 --> 02:39:40,063
<i>really good enough?</i>

2366
02:39:41,498 --> 02:39:43,496
I do love you.

2367
02:39:53,531 --> 02:39:56,458
<i>Grace had already
thought for a long time.</i>

2368
02:39:56,932 --> 02:40:00,388
<i>She had known that if she were not shot
when the gangsters arrived,</i>

2369
02:40:00,932 --> 02:40:03,769
<i>she would be faced with her father's
suggestion that she return</i>

2370
02:40:04,231 --> 02:40:07,218
<i>to be become a conspirator with him
and his gang of thugs and felons.</i>

2371
02:40:07,698 --> 02:40:11,155
<i>And she did not need any walk
to reconsider her response to that...</i>

2372
02:40:12,999 --> 02:40:15,686
<i>even though the difference
between the people she knew back home</i>

2373
02:40:16,132 --> 02:40:18,130
<i>and the people she'd met in Dogville</i>

2374
02:40:18,431 --> 02:40:21,238
<i>had proven somewhat slighter
than she'd expected.</i>

2375
02:40:23,665 --> 02:40:27,122
<i>Grace looked at the gooseberry bushes,
so fragile in the smooth darkness.</i>

2376
02:40:28,665 --> 02:40:31,702
<i>It was good to know that
if you did not treat them ill,</i>

2377
02:40:32,198 --> 02:40:34,716
<i>they would be there come spring
as always,</i>

2378
02:40:35,132 --> 02:40:37,319
<i>and come summer
they'd again be bursting</i>

2379
02:40:37,698 --> 02:40:40,355
<i>with the quite incomprehensible
quantity of berries</i>

2380
02:40:40,798 --> 02:40:43,046
<i>that were so good in pies,</i>

2381
02:40:43,431 --> 02:40:45,429
<i>especially with cinnamon.</i>

2382
02:40:45,632 --> 02:40:48,409
<i>Grace looked around
at the frightened faces</i>

2383
02:40:48,865 --> 02:40:52,082
<i>behind the windowpanes
that were following her every step</i>

2384
02:40:52,598 --> 02:40:55,755
<i>and felt ashamed
of being part of inflicting that fear.</i>

2385
02:40:58,065 --> 02:41:00,063
<i>How could she ever hate them</i>

2386
02:41:00,132 --> 02:41:02,969
<i>for what was at bottom
merely their weakness?</i>

2387
02:41:03,431 --> 02:41:06,708
<i>She would probably have done
things like those that have befallen her</i>

2388
02:41:07,231 --> 02:41:09,309
<i>if she had lived
in one of these houses.</i>

2389
02:41:09,665 --> 02:41:13,201
<i>To measure them by her own yardstick,
as her father put it,</i>

2390
02:41:13,765 --> 02:41:15,763
<i>would she not, in all honesty,</i>

2391
02:41:16,099 --> 02:41:18,097
<i>have done the same as Chuck?</i>

2392
02:41:18,298 --> 02:41:21,255
<i>And Vera and Ben?
And Mrs. Henson?</i>

2393
02:41:22,732 --> 02:41:25,829
<i>And Tom?
And all these people in their houses?</i>

2394
02:41:30,431 --> 02:41:32,429
<i>Grace paused.</i>

2395
02:41:32,565 --> 02:41:34,673
<i>And while she did,</i>

2396
02:41:35,032 --> 02:41:37,809
<i>the clouds scattered
and let the moonlight through.</i>

2397
02:41:45,665 --> 02:41:48,852
<i>And Dogville underwent another
of those little changes of light.</i>

2398
02:42:03,265 --> 02:42:06,332
<i>It was as if the light previously
so merciful and faint,</i>

2399
02:42:06,832 --> 02:42:10,228
<i>finally refused to cover up
for the town any longer.</i>

2400
02:42:11,732 --> 02:42:14,279
<i>Suddenly you could
no longer imagine a berry</i>

2401
02:42:14,698 --> 02:42:16,886
<i>that would appear one day
on a gooseberry bush,</i>

2402
02:42:17,265 --> 02:42:19,923
<i>but only see the thorn
that was there right now.</i>

2403
02:42:21,498 --> 02:42:25,364
<i>The light now penetrated every
unevenness and flaw in the buildings,</i>

2404
02:42:25,965 --> 02:42:28,482
<i>and in the people.</i>

2405
02:42:31,965 --> 02:42:35,621
<i>And all of a sudden, she knew
the answer to her question all too well.</i>

2406
02:42:38,231 --> 02:42:40,229
<i>If she had acted like them</i>

2407
02:42:40,565 --> 02:42:43,842
<i>she could not have defended
a single one of her actions</i>

2408
02:42:44,365 --> 02:42:47,262
<i>and could not have condemned
them harshly enough.</i>

2409
02:42:47,732 --> 02:42:52,827
<i>It was as if her sorrow and pain
finally assumed their rightful place.</i>

2410
02:42:54,565 --> 02:42:57,962
<i>No, what they had done
was not good enough.</i>

2411
02:42:59,832 --> 02:43:03,928
<i>And if one had the power to put it
to rights, it was one's duty to do so,</i>

2412
02:43:04,565 --> 02:43:06,563
<i>for the sake of other towns,</i>

2413
02:43:06,832 --> 02:43:09,199
<i>for the sake of humanity</i>

2414
02:43:09,598 --> 02:43:12,755
<i>and not least,
for the sake of the human being</i>

2415
02:43:13,265 --> 02:43:15,843
<i>that was Grace herself.</i>

2416
02:43:24,164 --> 02:43:26,162
If I went back and...

2417
02:43:27,832 --> 02:43:29,830
became your daughter again,

2418
02:43:30,064 --> 02:43:33,101
when would I be given
the power you're talking about?

2419
02:43:37,098 --> 02:43:38,964
Now.

2420
02:43:38,965 --> 02:43:41,072
At once?

2421
02:43:41,431 --> 02:43:43,429
<i>Why not?</i>

2422
02:43:48,231 --> 02:43:50,369
So that would mean
that I would also take on

2423
02:43:50,732 --> 02:43:53,509
the immediate responsibility,
at once.

2424
02:43:54,932 --> 02:43:56,930
And I'd be a part
of the problem solving...

2425
02:43:58,598 --> 02:44:00,596
like the problem

2426
02:44:00,765 --> 02:44:02,763
<i>of Dogville.</i>

2427
02:44:08,431 --> 02:44:10,889
We could start
by shooting the dog

2428
02:44:11,298 --> 02:44:14,105
and nailing it to a wall over there,

2429
02:44:14,565 --> 02:44:16,903
beneath that lamp for example.

2430
02:44:18,498 --> 02:44:20,576
It might help,
it sometimes does, no?

2431
02:44:20,932 --> 02:44:23,389
It would only make the town
more frightened,

2432
02:44:23,798 --> 02:44:26,375
it would hardly make it
a better place.

2433
02:44:28,565 --> 02:44:30,563
And it could happen again.

2434
02:44:31,798 --> 02:44:33,796
Somebody...

2435
02:44:33,865 --> 02:44:36,052
somebody happening by,
revealing...

2436
02:44:41,498 --> 02:44:43,496
their frailty.

2437
02:44:47,765 --> 02:44:50,422
<i>That's what I want to use
the power for, if you don't mind.</i>

2438
02:44:54,832 --> 02:44:57,699
I want to make this world
a little better.

2439
02:45:01,064 --> 02:45:03,202
Yeah?

2440
02:45:03,565 --> 02:45:06,961
The damn kid won't shut up.
Says he wants to talk to you, miss.

2441
02:45:07,498 --> 02:45:09,576
<i>Can we just shoot him now?</i>

2442
02:45:09,931 --> 02:45:12,099
No, let me talk to him.

2443
02:45:16,931 --> 02:45:18,979
What? What is it?

2444
02:45:21,565 --> 02:45:23,753
A man can't really be blamed

2445
02:45:24,131 --> 02:45:26,097
for being scared, can he?

2446
02:45:26,098 --> 02:45:28,526
- No...
<i>- No.</i>

2447
02:45:28,931 --> 02:45:30,929
I'm scared, Grace.

2448
02:45:30,998 --> 02:45:33,716
<i>I used you and I am sorry.</i>

2449
02:45:34,164 --> 02:45:35,764
I am stupid. I am.

2450
02:45:35,765 --> 02:45:38,042
I'm maybe
even arrogant sometimes.

2451
02:45:40,798 --> 02:45:42,846
You are, Tom.

2452
02:45:44,231 --> 02:45:47,628
Although using people
is not very charming,

2453
02:45:48,164 --> 02:45:51,291
I think you have to agree
that this specific illustration

2454
02:45:51,798 --> 02:45:53,905
<i>has surpassed all expectations.</i>

2455
02:45:54,265 --> 02:45:56,263
It says so much about being human.

2456
02:45:56,598 --> 02:45:59,285
It's been painful, but I think
you'll also have to agree

2457
02:45:59,732 --> 02:46:02,659
- it's been edifying, wouldn't you say?
- Not now, Tom.

2458
02:46:03,131 --> 02:46:05,129
Not now.

2459
02:46:09,498 --> 02:46:12,565
If there's any town this world
would be better without, this is it.

2460
02:46:18,998 --> 02:46:21,336
-<i>Yes?</i>
- Shoot them, burn down the town.

2461
02:46:25,064 --> 02:46:26,664
<i>Oh...</i>

2462
02:46:26,665 --> 02:46:29,242
What? Something else, honey?

2463
02:46:30,665 --> 02:46:32,663
There's a family with kids.

2464
02:46:35,897 --> 02:46:38,415
Do the kids first
and make the mother watch.

2465
02:46:38,831 --> 02:46:42,258
Tell her you'll stop
if she can hold back her tears.

2466
02:46:47,064 --> 02:46:49,062
I owe her that.

2467
02:46:55,831 --> 02:46:58,549
I'm afraid she cries
a little too easily.

2468
02:47:01,431 --> 02:47:03,429
We'd better get you out of here.

2469
02:47:04,897 --> 02:47:07,205
I'm afraid you've learned
far too much already.

2470
02:47:11,164 --> 02:47:13,162
Come on, come on.

2471
02:47:15,064 --> 02:47:17,781
<i>Feeling cold, sweetie?
Would you like a wrap?</i>

2472
02:47:19,231 --> 02:47:20,897
<i>I'm fine.</i>

2473
02:47:23,732 --> 02:47:26,219
You want the curtains opened?
You don't need them anymore.

2474
02:47:27,897 --> 02:47:29,895
You think?

2475
02:47:35,164 --> 02:47:37,162
I think we should open them.

2476
02:47:39,231 --> 02:47:41,229
I think it's appropriate.

2477
02:47:58,698 --> 02:48:00,696
No!

2478
02:48:01,565 --> 02:48:03,563
- <i>No! No!</i>
- No, no.

2479
02:48:03,897 --> 02:48:05,895
No, No.

2480
02:48:10,665 --> 02:48:12,663
No!

2481
02:48:13,465 --> 02:48:15,463
- No, Dad, no.
- No.

2482
02:48:15,632 --> 02:48:17,630
<i>Dad!</i>

2483
02:48:21,964 --> 02:48:23,962
Chuck!

2484
02:48:27,731 --> 02:48:29,729
Mom!

2485
02:48:30,064 --> 02:48:32,252
<i>Mom, help, help!</i>

2486
02:48:33,665 --> 02:48:35,663
Mom!

2487
02:48:50,531 --> 02:48:52,264
Stay, Achilles.

2488
02:48:52,265 --> 02:48:55,042
Dear God.

2489
02:48:58,498 --> 02:49:01,455
<i>No! Oh God!</i>

2490
02:49:38,098 --> 02:49:40,116
Bingo, Grace.

2491
02:49:42,565 --> 02:49:44,563
Bingo.

2492
02:49:46,064 --> 02:49:49,161
I have to tell you, your illustration,
it beat the hell out of mine.

2493
02:49:52,265 --> 02:49:54,453
It's frightening, yes,

2494
02:49:54,831 --> 02:49:56,829
but so clear.

2495
02:49:58,164 --> 02:50:00,162
<i>Do you think I can
allow myself to use it</i>

2496
02:50:00,431 --> 02:50:03,148
as an inspiration in my writing?

2497
02:50:13,365 --> 02:50:15,363
Goodbye, Tom.

2498
02:50:41,265 --> 02:50:43,453
Some things
you have to do yourself.

2499
02:50:44,797 --> 02:50:46,795
Really?

2500
02:50:49,797 --> 02:50:52,105
That one you're gonna have
to explain to me on the way home.

2501
02:50:53,465 --> 02:50:56,242
<i>Suddenly there was a noise--</i>

2502
02:50:56,697 --> 02:51:00,444
<i>not so persuasive and powerful as it
had been on one rainy night in spring,</i>

2503
02:51:01,031 --> 02:51:04,218
<i>but loud enough to work its way
through the final sighs of the timber</i>

2504
02:51:04,731 --> 02:51:08,098
<i>that was rapidly burning out.</i>

2505
02:51:08,631 --> 02:51:11,648
<i>It came again, everyone heard it.</i>

2506
02:51:12,131 --> 02:51:15,198
<i>- Grace was the first to recognize it.</i>
- That's Moses.

2507
02:51:15,697 --> 02:51:18,385
<i>"That's Moses," she said
and jumped out of the car.</i>

2508
02:51:19,831 --> 02:51:22,608
<i>She quickly covered the distance
to the dog pen through what,</i>

2509
02:51:23,064 --> 02:51:26,221
<i>now the buildings were gone,
could scarcely be called a street,</i>

2510
02:51:26,731 --> 02:51:29,568
<i>and certainly not Elm Street,
as there wasn't a tree left</i>

2511
02:51:30,031 --> 02:51:33,018
<i>on Dogville's little mountain ledge,
let alone an elm.</i>

2512
02:51:33,498 --> 02:51:35,605
<i>It was Moses.</i>

2513
02:51:35,964 --> 02:51:38,332
<i>His survival was astonishing,
a miracle.</i>

2514
02:51:39,731 --> 02:51:41,663
No, no.

2515
02:51:41,664 --> 02:51:43,742
No, just let him be.

2516
02:51:44,098 --> 02:51:47,405
<i>They will have spotted the flames
in Georgetown by now.</i>

2517
02:51:47,931 --> 02:51:50,299
Someone will come and find him.

2518
02:51:55,831 --> 02:51:58,259
He's just angry
because I once took his bone.

2519
02:52:09,931 --> 02:52:11,897
<i>Whether Grace left Dogville,</i>

2520
02:52:11,897 --> 02:52:14,445
<i>or on the contrary
Dogville had left her--</i>

2521
02:52:14,864 --> 02:52:16,463
<i>and the world in general--</i>

2522
02:52:16,464 --> 02:52:18,512
<i>is a question
of a more artful nature</i>

2523
02:52:18,864 --> 02:52:21,491
<i>that few would
benefit from by asking,</i>

2524
02:52:21,931 --> 02:52:24,099
<i>and even fewer
by providing an answer.</i>

2525
02:52:24,464 --> 02:52:27,182
<i>And nor indeed
will it be answered here.</i>
