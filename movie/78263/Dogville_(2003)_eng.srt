1
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:39,250
This is the sad tale
of the township of Dogville.

2
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,187
Dogville was in the Rocky Mountains
in the US of A.

3
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:47,673
Up here where the road
came to its definiteve end

4
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:51,120
near the entrance to the old,
abandoned silver mine.

5
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,888
The residents of Dogville were good,

6
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:57,251
honest folks and they
liked their township.

7
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,986
And while a sentimental
soul from the East Coast

8
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:02,520
had once dubbed their
main street ELM STREET,

9
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,691
though no elm tree had ever
cast its shadow in Dogville,

10
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:09,253
they saw no reason to change anything.

11
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:13,091
Most of the buildings
were pretty wretched;

12
00:01:13,092 --> 00:01:15,269
More like shacks; frankly.

13
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,620
The house in which Tome lived
was the best, though,

14
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:23,558
and in good times might almost
have passed for presentable.

15
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,896
That afternoon the radio
was playing softly,

16
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,468
for in his dotage Thomas
Edison Senior had developed

17
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:36,164
a weakness for music
of the lighter kind.

18
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:41,784
Ladies and Gentlemen...
the President of the United States...

19
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:46,247
Tom, do me a favor, will you?
The radio!?

20
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,876
Just because the music's over and
you might risk hearing something useful?

21
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:54,463
I thought that's why we have the radio...

22
00:01:54,738 --> 00:01:57,257
Well, I need a rest, as you know.

23
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,302
Mock me if you like.

24
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:05,748
Tom's father had been a doctor
and now received a modest pension,

25
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:08,214
so it was no great
disaster for Tom

26
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:11,588
to drift about not doing
anything in particular.

27
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:16,341
Tom was a writer.
...at any rate by his own lights.

28
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:19,933
Oh, his output as committed
to paper was so far

29
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:23,056
limited to the words
"great" and "small",

30
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:25,225
followed by question mark,

31
00:02:25,226 --> 00:02:31,332
but nevertheless meticulously archived
in one of his many bureau drawers.

32
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:33,542
'Bye, Dad.

33
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:40,239
Evenin' Master Tom.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,384
Good evening, Master Olivia.

35
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,160
Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow.

36
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:45,470
Noooo

37
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:56,296
In order to postpone the time at which he
would have to put pen to pater in earnest,

38
00:02:56,297 --> 00:03:01,343
Tom had now come up with
a series of meetings on moral rearmament

39
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:04,846
with which he felt obliged
to benefit the town.

40
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:06,949
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Tom.

41
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:09,118
Good evening Chuck.

42
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:12,079
Will we see you at the meeting tomorrow?

43
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:14,523
Well, I could do without your lectures.

44
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:16,208
You know Vera.

45
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:19,711
Wouldn't give me moment's peace
till I said yes.

46
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:25,425
Who gave Moses that bone?
It's still got meat on it.

47
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,326
Jason did.

48
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:30,013
Jason gave that mutt a bone
with meat on it?

49
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:33,266
When did we last see meat?

50
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,794
Next time you waste good food,
I'll take your knife away.

51
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:38,855
I would know
it was you give'n meat to eat.

52
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,923
Moses was meant to be hungry!
To keep watch.

53
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:44,110
Keep watch in Dogville?

54
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:46,595
What's there to steal?

55
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:49,240
These are wicked time, Tom Edison.

56
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:53,035
Soon there'll be folks by
with even less than us.

57
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:04,588
Indeed..Tom was busy enough,
even though, formally speaking,

58
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:07,924
not yet busy with writing per Se.

59
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:12,537
And if a body found it hard to grasp
what profession he was busy at,

60
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:15,598
he'd merely reply "mining".

61
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:18,625
For although he did not blast
his way through rock,

62
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,354
he blasted through
what was even harder...

63
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:26,776
namely, the human soul...
right into where it glistered!

64
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:29,362
- Hey, Martha.
- Hello, Tom.

65
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:32,180
Listen, they're all comin',
so you just have those benches ready.

66
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:33,765
Yes, they're ready.

67
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:37,436
Oh, but Tom, I repeat,
if you need to use my organ

68
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:40,355
I got to get special permission
from the regional director, Tom.

69
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:43,584
Martha, and I repeat,
we don't need the organ.

70
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:47,087
We can be spiritual without singing
or reading from the Bible.

71
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,466
It's almost seven.
Don't forget your bell now.

72
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,285
I imagine that'll do Ma Ginger.

73
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:57,972
I don't think it's good for the soil
with all the raking and hoeing.

74
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:01,726
It's the soil that gave life to us all.

75
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,688
Don't give me any of your lip,
Thomas Edison Jr.

76
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,298
I'll hoe as I darn well please!

77
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:12,844
Yeah, and spoil the whole thing!
I agree with Tom.

78
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,263
Yeah, well he likes eating my pies,
don't you?

79
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:18,117
Well they're tasty.
No doubt about it.

80
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:21,203
Yeah. So when it comes to hoeing,
who's right, Tom, you or me?

81
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:23,313
I'm not so sure it's that simple.

82
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,148
He's got you there Ginger.

83
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:28,377
You can not resist,
can you, Gloria?

84
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,736
Hey, Ben, I'll get the doors!

85
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:31,988
I'll be fine, Tom.

86
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:34,490
Any news from the freight industry?

87
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:36,534
Is everything going to hell there too?

88
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:39,721
Don't poke fun at the freight industry.

89
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:48,795
It was seven o'clock precisely,
as Martha chimed the hour,

90
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:53,943
and Tom was due to play checkers
with his childhood friend Bill Henson.

91
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,779
Bill was dumb and knew it.

92
00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:02,868
Far too dumb to qualify as an engineer,
he was certainly sure of that.

93
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:06,925
After listening for a while to
the piledriver down the valley

94
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:11,345
that Ben insisted was working on the
foundation of a new penitentiary,

95
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:15,280
Tom headed for the Henson home
in order to inflict upon Bill

96
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:19,092
yet another humiliating
defeat at checkers.

97
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:24,176
Some folks might say the opportunity
to meet Bill's older sister,

98
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:27,207
Liz, was more of a draw
than the checkerboard,

99
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,644
and they might be right.

100
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:34,815
It was a fact that in the Henson home
lay another horizon.

101
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:39,528
A horizon just as alluring
as the one beyond the valley.

102
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:44,391
A horizon bound by Liz Henson's
luscious curves.

103
00:06:44,392 --> 00:06:49,313
- No one's getting it?
- A sweet, painful, seductive abyss.

104
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:51,147
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Tom.

105
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:55,277
Must you come by every single day?
Huh!?

106
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:58,547
It'd be a lot more fun if someone
interesting appeared for a change.

107
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:02,343
You know I really am so
lonesome in this town.

108
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:07,538
The moment my fiancee writes that he's
gotten that job in Bolder, I'm off.

109
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:10,749
Then the whole lot of you will have to
find some other girls' skirts to peek up.

110
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,935
Is.. uh.. Bill in?

111
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:15,646
Well, isn't he always?

112
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,632
He studies and I help out
with the glasses.

113
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:21,694
Even though everybody knows
that I'm the clever one.

114
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:24,905
- Hey, Mrs. Henson.
- Good evening, Tom.

115
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:28,200
Checkers time, Bill ol' Buddy.

116
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:31,245
Was that...?

117
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:33,830
You didn't hear the bell?

118
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,711
As usual Bill tried to fake
his way around actually playing.

119
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:44,716
He had not yet fully comprehend
this meeting business, he claimed.

120
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,493
Maybe you should just let them be?

121
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:49,220
I don't think so... I... I...

122
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:51,705
What if they're just fine as they are?

123
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:54,499
You think they're fine?
I don't think so.

124
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,710
I think there is a lot
this country has forgotten.

125
00:07:56,711 --> 00:08:00,731
I just try and refresh folk's memory
by way of illustration.

126
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,758
So... so the illustration for tomorrow?

127
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,319
Mmmh.. I don't know.

128
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:10,723
See if the people of Dogville have
a problem with the acceptance.

129
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:14,411
What they really need is something
for them to accept,

130
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,373
something tangible,
like a gift.

131
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,735
Why in the heck would someone
up and give us a gift?

132
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,296
I don't know.

133
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:26,464
I might have to do some thinking.

134
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:33,546
Wait, wait, .. the...
we're missing a piece.

135
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:36,391
We won't be able to play.

136
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:49,153
My mind is sharp tonight.

137
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,081
'Night, Bill.

138
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,040
Despite considerable effort
on his part to prolong things,

139
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,978
Tom had achieved the triumph
at the checkerboard pretty quickly.

140
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:28,090
It had started to rain and
the wind had become a regular gale

141
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:31,318
when Tom strolled home
through Elm Street.

142
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:35,027
If Tom were to prove that
the citizens of Dogville

143
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:38,460
had a problem receiving in
his lecture in the next day

144
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:42,954
he sorely lacked an illustration,
a gift.

145
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:45,148
Bill might have been right.

146
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:49,920
It hadn't exactly rained gifts
on this particular township.

147
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:30,441
There was no doubt in his mind.

148
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:32,794
They were gun shots.

149
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:36,905
The pile driver in the marshes
didn't sound like that at all.

150
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:39,159
The shots had come from down in the valley,

151
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,429
or perhaps from Canyon Road some place
in the direction of Georgetown.

152
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,771
He listened for more shots for ages.
But they were not repeated.

153
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:59,302
A tad disappointed, Tom sat down
on the old lady's bench to think,

154
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:03,073
to hang onto the feeling of danger
for a moment.

155
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:09,079
But it wasn't long before his thoughts
were back on his favorite subjects again,

156
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:12,233
and in the midst of the storm
they metamorphosed

157
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:15,192
into articles and novels
and great gatherings

158
00:11:15,193 --> 00:11:20,676
that'd listen in silence to Tom after
the publication of yet another volume

159
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:23,728
that scourged and
purged the human soul.

160
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:28,039
And he saw men,
and among them even other writers,

161
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,931
throw their arms round one another as,

162
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:34,947
through his words,
life had opened up for them anew.

163
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,481
It hadn't been easy.

164
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:42,059
But by his diligence and
application to narrative and drama

165
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,581
his message had gotten through,

166
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,118
and asked about his technique he would
have to say but one word:

167
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,163
"illustration".

168
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:15,918
Tom could have spent another
half hour or more on the bench,

169
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,813
but another unusual noise roused him.

170
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,483
It was Moses barking.

171
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:27,654
Oh, that wasn't unusual in itself,
but it was the way he barked that was new.

172
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:31,265
His barking was not loud,
but more of a snarl,

173
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:37,706
as if the danger was quite close at hand
and not merely a passing raccoon or fox.

174
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:45,005
As if the dog were standing face to face
with a force to be taken seriously.

175
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:51,302
Hey, Lady!
I wouldn't go up there if I were you.

176
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:58,416
I know the mountain well,
I doubt if I'd get away with my life.

177
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,436
It's a very nasty drop.

178
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,610
Is there another way?

179
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:10,445
Yeah.

180
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,617
Where?

181
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:20,789
Back down the way you came from.
Back down to Georgetown.

182
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,875
Why do you need to
get out of the mountain?

183
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:27,212
Did you have anything to do
with those gunshots?

184
00:13:33,117 --> 00:13:35,452
Help me, help me please.

185
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:38,139
You can hide in the mine,
in there!

186
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,841
Hey, where's this road headed to?

187
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:51,008
No where. It's a dead end.

188
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:55,429
If you want to pass, turn around,
go back by way of Georgetown.

189
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,349
This place... uh..
It's called Dogville.

190
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,954
Dogville? Well it figures,
it's a stupid name if I ever heard one.

191
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:04,980
Hey, we're looking for somebody...

192
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:07,041
Oh, really, who might that be?

193
00:14:09,027 --> 00:14:11,587
My boss wants to talk to ya.

194
00:14:11,906 --> 00:14:13,965
- Young man.
- Yes, sir.

195
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:20,161
I'm looking for a girl. She may have made
her way to your town in her confusion.

196
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:25,250
I don't want any harm to come to her.
You see, she's very precious to me.

197
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:28,711
Well sir, uh..
Nobody's been through Dogville recently.

198
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:32,674
Moses would have barked.
He's very suspicious of strangers.

199
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:36,928
Ah ha.. That's very wise Moses.

200
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:44,101
Please take my card and if perhaps..
Uh.. you see a stranger,

201
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:45,913
give me a call.

202
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:50,190
I am in a position to offer
a considerable reward.

203
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:53,211
Yes sir. Thank you.

204
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:57,131
Uh.. say was it you
that fired those shots?

205
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:16,900
Well they're gone.
You want to come out now?

206
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:29,996
You want a cup of coffee
before you go mountain-climbing?

207
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:35,335
That would be nice.

208
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:41,757
The beautiful fugitive's name was Grace.

209
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:47,037
She hadn't chosen Dogville from a map
or sought out the township for a visit,

210
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:51,350
yet Tom felt right away
that she belonged.

211
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,103
Shall I take the bone?

212
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,094
She could have kept
her vulnerability to herself,

213
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:07,449
but she had elected to give herself up
to him at random.

214
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:12,954
As.. yes.. a gift.

215
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:17,191
"Generous, very generous",
thought Tom.

216
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:23,781
You want to eat?
You must be hungry?

217
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,341
I can't.

218
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:29,095
I don't deserve that bread!

219
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,975
I stole that bone.
I haven't stolen anything before.

220
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:39,797
So now, now I have to punish myself.

221
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:47,195
I was raised to be arrogant,
so I had to teach myself these things.

222
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:54,327
Well, it may be best
for your education...

223
00:16:55,228 --> 00:17:00,667
Grace, in this town in these times...

224
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:05,588
it is very impolite not to eat
what's set before you.

225
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:09,800
I'm so sorry.

226
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:24,898
Who were the men in the car?
Why would they want to hurt you?

227
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:32,322
The man in the back of the car,
he's the boss. I saw his face.

228
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:38,036
He gave me his telephone number,
told me to call if I saw you.

229
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:42,856
I'm sure he'd offered you a big reward
if you told him where I was.

230
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:44,250
Yeah.

231
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,322
Where's your family?

232
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:52,198
I don't have a family.

233
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,969
All I had was a father...

234
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,392
but those gangsters took him away from me.

235
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:04,978
What if I said you could stay here?

236
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,379
Here?

237
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,900
But even if you meant it, it's impossible.

238
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:17,532
It's very small town, I have to hide.
People will ask questions.

239
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:22,245
Well, it might not matter.
Not if they all wanted to help you too.

240
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,315
Are you saying that everybody
in this town is like you?

241
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:31,170
They're good people.
You know, they're honest people.

242
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,697
They've all been in need themselves.

243
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:36,509
They might well turn you down, but...

244
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:40,078
I think it would be worth
the trouble to ask.

245
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,432
But I got nothing to offer them in return.

246
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:47,352
No, I think you have
plenty to offer Dogville.

247
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,106
To call the mood of the audience
at Tom's morale lecture

248
00:18:58,107 --> 00:18:59,930
in the mission house the next day,

249
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:05,185
"enthusiastic" would have been
going to far, but they had come.

250
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,726
And Tom had launched
himself fearlessly

251
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:11,024
into his endeavor to illustrate
the human problem:

252
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,127
To receive.

253
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,105
The subject was obvious,

254
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:23,147
but quite dreadfully ill-considered
by this young man.

255
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:27,874
To compensate for his lack of preparation
Tom made diligent use of his technique

256
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,270
of lashing out somewhat haphazardly
in all directions.

257
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,799
His father peered around covertly
to gauge the mood,

258
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,900
and sensing that the assembly
was not entirely happy

259
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,971
with this rather direct criticism,

260
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,015
he decided to forestall any protest.

261
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:48,202
Now I'm sure that you wish us well, Tom,

262
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:53,916
but um.. of any town, I believe this one
has a very fine sense of community.

263
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,735
Living side by side we
all know one another.

264
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:58,737
I'm a pretty fair judge
of character myself.

265
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:01,449
Honestly, Tom, you've done it again.

266
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,093
Made us come here to listen
to a lot of nonsense.

267
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:07,287
What do you think you are,
some kind of philosopher?

268
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,163
Observant, that's what I am.

269
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:13,084
Lazy, I would say.
We shovel snow together.

270
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:14,919
We shovel snow together?

271
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,795
Yeah.

272
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:18,714
Every household clears
their own front walk.

273
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:21,343
Yeah, I gotta allow that
Tom's right on that.

274
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:23,663
If roads don't get cleared properly...

275
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:29,141
I'm sorry Tom, you're going to have to
come up with something better than that.

276
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:31,764
But the whole country
would be better served

277
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:34,855
with a greater attitude of
openness and acceptance.

278
00:20:34,856 --> 00:20:38,275
You're suggesting that we all
wouldn't help out if someone needed help.

279
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:39,985
No, that's not the point.
That's not the point.

280
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:41,279
We care for human beings up here.

281
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,632
We would probably never find out.

282
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,307
Since nobody seems to want to admit
that there's a problem,

283
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,893
let me illustrate.

284
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:02,357
Now I'm not going to use something
that's already happened.

285
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:07,278
I'm going to use something
that's just about to happen.

286
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,766
And, after providing a quick summary
of the events of the previous evening

287
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:16,978
to the astonished people of Dogville,

288
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:23,085
Tom went down to the mine to retrieve
the fugitive from her hideaway.

289
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:37,015
Allow me to introduce Grace.
Grace, these are the citizens of Dogville.

290
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,559
- Hello.
- Hello.

291
00:21:42,963 --> 00:21:45,714
Tom has told us about
your predicament, Miss.

292
00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:48,550
I really don't want to put any of you
in jeopardy.

293
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:50,302
Why don't you just go to the police?

294
00:21:50,303 --> 00:21:54,014
They can take care of gangsters!
It's their job.

295
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:56,594
I, I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

296
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:59,019
The transportation business would uh...

297
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,920
Ben!

298
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:06,929
These men, they have powerful connections,
even with the police.

299
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:11,614
Do you think we should give
sanctuary to a fugitive?

300
00:22:11,615 --> 00:22:14,530
A fugitive that gangsters
wanna get a hold of.

301
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:16,786
That would put us in pretty pickle.

302
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:18,539
Easy, Claire...
think of your asthma.

303
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,416
Dogville is a good place to hide,
that's for certain.

304
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:24,478
Exactly.
The only way up here is Canyon Road.

305
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:27,582
That could easily
be watched by Ma Ginger's

306
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,661
Excuse me, nosey cousin who lives
only yards from the turn off.

307
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:34,720
She has a telephone.
Martha, you could ring the bell,

308
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,282
tell the town if people were coming.

309
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:43,520
But Tom, I chime the hours, what if
people get confused with all the ringing?

310
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:47,857
Come now, Martha. Surely we can use our
old bell to save a life, if need be.

311
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:50,336
Why should we?

312
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:53,863
Because we care, Chuck.
We care for other human beings.

313
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:55,507
No, that ain't what I mean.

314
00:22:55,824 --> 00:22:58,910
How do we know that this woman is
telling us the truth?

315
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:03,873
Maybe these gangsters did shoot at her, but
that don't make her somebody to be trusted.

316
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:09,271
He is right.
Why would you trust me?

317
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:11,439
I trust you!

318
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:14,384
Tom, we're not gangsters.

319
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:19,822
We mind our own business
we don't ask nothin' from nobody.

320
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:22,599
So at last you admit it!

321
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,938
If only there were some way,
we wouldn't doubt the young lady's word.

322
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,397
Some way to know her..

323
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:31,834
Then I think we would all ignore the risk.

324
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:35,820
But there is a way!
You said it yourself.

325
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:38,757
By living side by side with her.

326
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,909
Dad, you are such a fine
judge of character.

327
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,472
How long would it take a good man
like you to unmask her?

328
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:49,309
A week? Maybe two?

329
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:51,978
Surely we can offer her two weeks.

330
00:23:53,046 --> 00:23:56,840
And if after that time so much as
one man cries out 'BE GONE!'

331
00:23:56,841 --> 00:24:00,820
I promise I'll happily send her
packing herself.

332
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:11,440
Well, if Master Tom thinks
this is right for us,

333
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:12,856
and for the community,

334
00:24:12,857 --> 00:24:19,588
then that will do for me.
He might be young, but his heart is right.

335
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:23,342
And I've known his heart
for as long as it's been beating.

336
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:36,754
No more words were spoken
at the town meeting in the mission house.

337
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:42,944
But it had been decided, they all felt,
that the fugitive would be given two weeks.

338
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:46,346
And they would all be able to look
at themselves in the mirror and know

339
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:49,409
that they had done
what they could, indeed,

340
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:53,047
and perhaps more than
most people would have done.

341
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:59,630
So that very afternoon Tom
took Grace on a stroll down Elm Street

342
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:03,946
to introduce
her to the town "he loved".

343
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:08,701
Well, this is where Olivia and June live.

344
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:14,724
June is a cripple... They live here as
a token of my dad's broadmindedness.

345
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:18,770
Chuck and Vera have seven children
and they hate each other.

346
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:21,131
Next door we have the Hensons.

347
00:25:21,132 --> 00:25:24,956
They make a living from
grinding edges off cheap glasses

348
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,386
to try to make them look expensive.

349
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:29,213
And here we have Jack McKay.

350
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:32,808
Now, Jack McKay is blind
and the whole town knows it.

351
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:37,646
But he thinks he can hide it
by never leaving his house.

352
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:40,106
In the old stable Ben keeps his truck.

353
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:46,988
He drinks and he visits the whorehouse
once a month and he is ashamed of it.

354
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:49,500
Martha she runs the mission house

355
00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:53,939
until the new preacher comes
which will just never happen.

356
00:25:54,705 --> 00:26:01,377
That leaves Ma Ginger and Gloria.
They run this really expensive store,

357
00:26:01,378 --> 00:26:05,690
where they exploit the fact
that nobody leaves town.

358
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:10,528
Used to leave to go vote,
but since they put on the registration fee,

359
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:17,493
about a day's wage for these people, they
don't feel the democratic need any more.

360
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:25,400
Those awful figurines say more about
the people in this town, than many words.

361
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:30,005
If this is the town that you love, then you
really have a strange way of showing it.

362
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:39,282
All I see, is a beautiful little town
in the midst of magnificent mountains.

363
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:49,725
A place where people have hopes and
dreams even under the hardest conditions.

364
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:56,948
And seven figurines that
are not awful at all.

365
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,703
Calling Dogville beautiful was
original at least.

366
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:06,530
Grace was just casting
one more look at the figurines

367
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:10,805
she herself would have dismissed
as tasteless a few days earlier,

368
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:16,257
when she suddenly sensed
what would best have been described

369
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:19,980
as a tiny change of light
over Dogville.

370
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:44,142
They are keeping an eye on you.

371
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:49,373
If you love them already,
they might need a little persuading.

372
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:54,211
You've got two weeks
to get them to accept you.

373
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:57,506
You make it sound like
we are playing a game.

374
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:05,781
It is. We are. Isn't saving your life
worth a little game?

375
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:08,141
What do you want me to do?

376
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,268
Do you mind physical labour?

377
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:12,478
No!

378
00:28:13,463 --> 00:28:16,733
Dogville has offered you two weeks.

379
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:20,361
Now you offer them...

380
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:38,946
The next day was
a beautiful day in Dogville.

381
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:43,115
The tender leaves on Ma Ginger's
goosberry bushes were unfurling

382
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:48,055
despite wise Tom's misgivings
as regards her gardening methods.

383
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:52,053
But more than that,
this first day of spring

384
00:28:52,054 --> 00:28:57,046
had also Ben picked to be
Grace's first ever day of work.

385
00:28:57,047 --> 00:29:00,777
The day in which she was
to set off around Dogville

386
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:04,344
and offer herself one hour
per household per day.

387
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:05,696
Excuse me.

388
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:13,912
I would like to offer you my help..
If there is anything that you need?

389
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,960
Yeah.. A carburetor that don't leak..

390
00:29:21,988 --> 00:29:25,090
Alright here, let me take that.

391
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,717
Maybe I could help around your home?

392
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:35,058
I don't really have a home.
Just the garage.

393
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:40,754
I'm in the freight business.
The road is my home!

394
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:42,839
I'm ready. Good morning!

395
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,901
Miss Olivia has got a home.

396
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:49,346
She is looking to help out
in somebody's home.

397
00:29:49,347 --> 00:29:51,907
A cleanin' lady for a cleanin' lady?

398
00:29:52,516 --> 00:29:55,786
You be talkin' nonsense, Mister Ben!

399
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,103
Have a good day!

400
00:29:57,104 --> 00:30:00,541
Alright. See ya later on!

401
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:05,236
And off Ben went to Georgetown
with the weekly shipment of glasses

402
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:09,314
that Mr. Henson had so laboriously
cleansed with his polisher

403
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:12,103
of any trace of their
cheap manufacture.

404
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:22,520
So Grace turned into the alley which
went by the exotic name, Glunen Street

405
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:28,693
to knock on the door of the blind,
but only too vain, man.

406
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,529
Yes?

407
00:30:32,722 --> 00:30:36,200
Good morning, Mr. McKay.
My name is Grace.

408
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:40,746
I was wondering if there is anything
I can do for you?

409
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:44,190
Oh, that's very kind of you, Grace,
but...

410
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:48,921
I was thinking that perhaps because of
the situation that you are in...

411
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:51,965
What situation am I in?

412
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:59,556
Hmm... You are... on your own.

413
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:07,063
Oh, I have been on my own for so long.

414
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:10,024
Anything that you might need?

415
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:13,260
I'm sorry!

416
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:19,474
Have you ever noticed the wooden spire
on the roof of the mission house?

417
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:26,657
At 5 o'clock in the afternoon, it points
a shadow at Ginger's grocery store,

418
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:33,865
right at the O in OPEN
on the sign in the window.

419
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,260
Maybe it is telling people that it is time
to go shopping for supper.

420
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,972
Goodbye, Mr. McKay.

421
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:45,933
Bye, Grace!

422
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:48,418
Grace's interview with Jack McKay

423
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,074
proved sadly symptomatic
of the attitude in Dogville.

424
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:57,695
Reserved but friendly,
not without curiosity.

425
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:04,076
Only Jack had expressed his "no"
concisely and precisely:

426
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:09,564
Martha needed a monologue almost an hour
long to arrive at the same conclusion.

427
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:13,234
Oh my goodness... I, I, I'd have
to think of work for you to do,

428
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:15,795
because I have barely enough work myself.

429
00:32:16,404 --> 00:32:21,241
So not very much later Grace had ended
up next to Ma Ginger's gooseberry bushes

430
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:25,096
in a mood that was not particularly good.

431
00:32:26,456 --> 00:32:29,625
She could not tell a gooseberry bush
from a cactus,

432
00:32:29,626 --> 00:32:33,396
but the meticulous order in the yard
appealed to her,

433
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:35,496
such as the metal chains placed there

434
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,966
in order to shield the
second and third bushes,

435
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:42,824
lest anybody decided to make use of the
deplorably time-honored shortcut

436
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:44,583
to the old lady's bench.

437
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:50,329
Grace pulled herself together and
headed towards the store.

438
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:54,499
Hello!

439
00:32:55,609 --> 00:33:01,071
Hello. We don't need any help here either.
I told that to Tom.

440
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:05,677
Wow, it doesn't matter anyway,
because there is nothing I can do.

441
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:08,346
I have never worked a day in my life, so.

442
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:15,287
You know, if you put some aloe
on those hands of yours

443
00:33:15,288 --> 00:33:17,170
they'll be better by morning.

444
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:20,858
It's the wood shavings.
I really do hate them.

445
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,678
But I do believe I'll take your advice.

446
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:28,139
Your hands are surely the most
alabaster hands I've ever seen.

447
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,535
Here comes Tom, how lucky we are.

448
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:37,750
Hi, all. Grace.. how is all going?

449
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:40,109
- Not very well, I'm afraid.
- Really?

450
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,337
No. Nobody needs any help.

451
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:44,839
Well, I thought that might be the case.

452
00:33:44,864 --> 00:33:50,202
His plan to make everybody like me
has run into a few problems

453
00:33:50,203 --> 00:33:52,537
because nobody wants me to work for them.

454
00:33:52,538 --> 00:33:55,726
I would really like to
offer something in return.

455
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,979
You're all running a terrible risk
having me here.

456
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,214
I mean, I am willing to learn.

457
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:07,844
There must be someone who needs help.
Mr. McKay's sight is not good.

458
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:12,473
Yes, I went to Mr. McKay.
I went to Martha and to Chuck and Vera's,

459
00:34:12,474 --> 00:34:15,160
and nobody seems to need any help.

460
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:18,187
They all think everyone else needs
something, and not themselves.

461
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:22,334
Funny, that's exactly what Tom said.
I supposed he's pleased.

462
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:29,507
Just to prove him wrong,
maybe you can lend a hand here.

463
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:33,452
But Ginger, there really isn't anything
we need done.

464
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:35,847
Perhaps there's something
you don't need done?

465
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:38,040
Anything we don't need done?

466
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:44,063
Something.. something that you would like
done, but that you don't think is necessary.

467
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,131
What on earth would that be?

468
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:48,508
Maybe... maybe the gooseberry bushes.

469
00:34:48,509 --> 00:34:51,111
The gooseberries are just fine,
thank you very much.

470
00:34:51,178 --> 00:34:55,407
No. Not yours. The ones that planted
themselves in the tall grass.

471
00:34:55,974 --> 00:34:57,517
We don't grow anything there.

472
00:34:57,518 --> 00:35:01,329
Exactly. A bit of tiding up.

473
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:05,692
Who knows, those bushes might
one day bear fruit.

474
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:08,819
Yeah. That's true! Who knows..

475
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,588
All right, girl.

476
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:18,721
Those alabaster hands of yours are hereby
engaged to weed the wild gooseberry bushes.

477
00:35:19,914 --> 00:35:21,140
Thank you!

478
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:25,478
Around.. like this, you see.

479
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:29,649
Anything to close them...
just be careful, that's all.

480
00:35:31,383 --> 00:35:35,428
After a few of the wild little
gooseberry bushes had given up the ghost

481
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:40,016
in the care of Grace's as yet
unpracticed alabaster hands,

482
00:35:40,017 --> 00:35:44,913
things began looking up
with the weeding and the town.

483
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:50,616
In fact it turned out there
were not so few things that

484
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:54,642
the other townsfolk of Dogville
didn't need doing either.

485
00:35:55,448 --> 00:35:59,104
As Ben had no home, Grace's
domestic experiments

486
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:02,106
were absolutely things
he didn't need,

487
00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:06,638
but he put up with them anyhow,
appearing with astonishing punctuality

488
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,377
when the act of domesticity
had been completed,

489
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:11,940
no matter how unpredictable
business hours in

490
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:14,702
the freight industry might
otherwise have been.

491
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:23,140
Olivia didn't need anyone to help June
to the toilet while she was at work,

492
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:29,247
as hitherto they had coped splendidly
with Olivia's excellent diaper arrangement.

493
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:33,919
If Jack McKay had needed a
partner for conversation

494
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,182
he would surely have gone out and
gotten one for himself in the town.

495
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:43,453
So it was not out of need that he allowed
Grace to sit with him in his dark parlor

496
00:36:43,454 --> 00:36:48,062
with the dramatic drapes on one wall
for lengthy discussions regarding

497
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:52,113
the underestimated qualities of
the light on the East Coast.

498
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:56,776
As Martha wouldn't dream
of burdening the parish

499
00:36:56,777 --> 00:36:59,634
with wear and tear of
the pedals and bellows,

500
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,562
while waiting for the new
priest to be appointed,

501
00:37:02,563 --> 00:37:05,681
she practiced without a note
ever leaving the organ,

502
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:10,287
and was therefore not really
in need of anyone to turn her pages.

503
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:14,624
And God knows that
Mr. and Mrs. Henson's son

504
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,513
did not need any help with his books,

505
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:22,215
and that the family had taken Grace
for her own sake.

506
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,516
And although Liz's hands had improved
through Grace's good counsel,

507
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:35,267
Thomas Edison was a doctor
and of indisputable health

508
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:37,156
and he did not need care,

509
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:41,442
or help with the pills from the medicine
closet with its many secrets.

510
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:50,224
Actually Chuck was the only one
"not yet hooked", as Tom put it.

511
00:37:50,225 --> 00:37:56,623
Hooked? You sound so arrogant!
Arrogance is the worst thing!

512
00:37:56,815 --> 00:37:58,750
He doesn't like me.

513
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,487
And he has every right to feel that way.

514
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:08,718
Yeah. Listen!
Luckily I have prepared a Trojan horse.

515
00:38:09,285 --> 00:38:10,219
A what?

516
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:13,097
Trojan horse.
We can get in by way of Vera.

517
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:20,739
There is this.. lecture tomorrow
in Georgetown, given by some professor.

518
00:38:21,964 --> 00:38:26,235
Some intellectual thing.

519
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,281
But not so intellectual he can't tour the
provinces with it, anyway, the point is,

520
00:38:31,515 --> 00:38:33,535
Vera she would do anything to go,

521
00:38:33,536 --> 00:38:37,005
but she's got no one to mind Achilles
while she is gone.

522
00:38:37,103 --> 00:38:40,993
She trusts the girls mastering
their iambs and pentameters,

523
00:38:40,994 --> 00:38:42,858
but not with the little one.

524
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:44,772
So this is where you come in.

525
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:48,349
I said that you could
watch him tomorrow afternoon.

526
00:38:48,365 --> 00:38:53,034
Now, I will try and stall her on her
way home and with a bit of luck,

527
00:38:53,035 --> 00:38:55,329
Chuck'll get back before she does

528
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:00,083
and you can use the time and
all your charm to try and win him over.

529
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:03,753
I'll happily mind Achilles
if Vera will let me.

530
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:07,274
But if he doesn't like
me he doesn't like me.

531
00:39:08,175 --> 00:39:13,406
Tom really was enchanted by this
unusual, mysterious creature.

532
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:19,101
And even though she did not satisfy his
curiosity by saying anything about her past

533
00:39:19,102 --> 00:39:23,999
so as not to put anyone in danger,
she still fitted Tom's mission

534
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,763
to educate Dogville on the subject
of acceptance like a glove.

535
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,364
Tom felt content.

536
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:33,720
Grace had been dangling
over the edge,

537
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:37,118
and he had been the one
to pull her back onto the path.

538
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,475
It gave him a fine sensation of mastery,
new for him in terms of the opposite sex,

539
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:48,398
and his feelings unleashed the best
in his burgeoning love.

540
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:10,552
Hello. This is Dahlia, Olympia, Diana,
Athena, Pandora, Jason, Achilles.

541
00:40:15,198 --> 00:40:16,841
Your children are lovely.

542
00:40:16,866 --> 00:40:22,357
They are good kids. And I love them.

543
00:40:29,378 --> 00:40:34,608
Please don't say any such nice things
about the kids. I cry too easily.

544
00:40:36,426 --> 00:40:39,279
Both in sorrow and in joy.

545
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,199
- Hey, Vera.
- Oh, hi!

546
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:44,701
- Shall we go?
- I'm ready.

547
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:47,353
Thanks for leaving the map out.

548
00:40:47,354 --> 00:40:51,583
I'd a plum forgot it, I'm sure.
How did you know I was going that far?

549
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:56,486
The last time I saw the thermos, it was on
the doorstep and the map was beside it,

550
00:40:56,487 --> 00:41:01,926
so I just thought, when I saw the thermos
this time and no map, but...

551
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:06,555
You are a sweet girl, Grace.

552
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:08,974
Sweet as Miss Laura.

553
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:10,542
Who's Miss Laura?

554
00:41:10,543 --> 00:41:13,044
You gave yourself again, Ben.

555
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:17,816
I think Miss Laura is
what Ovid might call a Maenad.

556
00:41:22,263 --> 00:41:24,823
Oh, don't be ashamed, Ben.

557
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:28,559
We all have the right to
make the most of our lives.

558
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,291
I'm sure that those ladies in those houses
they bring a lot of joy to a lot of men.

559
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:41,380
Ain't nothing I'm proud of.
It really ain't.

560
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:01,358
I know what you are doing here.

561
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,361
You do?

562
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:10,158
You want people to like you,
so you don't have to go away.

563
00:42:11,685 --> 00:42:13,536
You are very smart.

564
00:42:15,855 --> 00:42:18,649
Yes, I like it here in Dogville.

565
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:24,380
Do you want me to read to you?
About the Cyclops?

566
00:42:24,864 --> 00:42:27,675
I don't like the Cyclops.

567
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:34,765
Two eyes are pretties, like yours.

568
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:42,950
If you want my Ma to like you,
and let you stay.

569
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:45,535
You'll just have to be nice to me.

570
00:42:48,303 --> 00:42:50,780
Maybe you should help me clean up instead.

571
00:42:51,056 --> 00:42:56,077
Ma says I don't have to work,
'cept in my head.

572
00:42:56,145 --> 00:43:00,248
Oh, but what about if I ask you, please?

573
00:43:00,356 --> 00:43:01,416
Ok.

574
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:17,097
What are you doing here?

575
00:43:17,123 --> 00:43:19,666
Didn't I tell you we don't need
no help from you?

576
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,627
Ma asked her to mind me and Achilles.

577
00:43:21,628 --> 00:43:24,938
Quiet! Get out! The lot of you.

578
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:29,526
The same nonsense!

579
00:43:30,094 --> 00:43:33,113
They'd have done just great in Antiquity,
no doubt.

580
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,909
How is it going otherwise,
with the fooling act?

581
00:43:41,604 --> 00:43:43,623
I wasn't trying to fool anyone?

582
00:43:44,983 --> 00:43:48,461
I mean Dogville.
Has it got you fooled yet?

583
00:43:51,614 --> 00:43:55,676
I thought you were implying
that I was trying to exploit the town.

584
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:58,262
Wishful thinking.

585
00:44:00,164 --> 00:44:04,184
This town is rotten from the inside out,

586
00:44:04,626 --> 00:44:07,604
and I wouldn't miss it,
if it fell into the gorge tomorrow.

587
00:44:07,963 --> 00:44:13,454
I see no charm here, but you seem to.

588
00:44:16,055 --> 00:44:19,282
Admit it you've fallen for Dogville.

589
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:24,579
The trees, the mountains,
the simple folk.

590
00:44:25,064 --> 00:44:28,499
And if all that ain't got you fooled yet,
I bet the cinnamon has.

591
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,586
That damned cinnamon
in those gooseberry pies.

592
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:37,092
Dogville has everything that you ever
dreamed of in the big city.

593
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:42,471
You are worse than Tom.
How do you know what I dreamed of?

594
00:44:47,043 --> 00:44:49,936
You're from the city yourself, aren't you?

595
00:44:49,963 --> 00:44:51,897
That was a long time ago.

596
00:44:52,048 --> 00:44:55,674
I am not that stupid anymore, I found
out that people are the same all over.

597
00:44:55,675 --> 00:44:57,360
Greedy as animals.

598
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,972
In a small town they're just a bit
less successful.

599
00:45:00,973 --> 00:45:03,849
Feed 'em enough they'll eat
till their bellies burst.

600
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:06,202
That's why you wanted to get rid of me...

601
00:45:06,811 --> 00:45:11,707
because you can't stand that I remind
you of what it was you came here to find.

602
00:45:19,657 --> 00:45:21,884
I'm telling you for the last time
to get out of my home.

603
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:24,178
Moses don't like you.
And I don't like you.

604
00:45:24,578 --> 00:45:27,246
The kids are going crazy enough
from their ma's teachin'.

605
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:29,016
Thank you, Grace!

606
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:52,413
The two seeks had passed far too quickly.
Grace had enjoyed herself.

607
00:45:52,898 --> 00:45:56,441
All she could say was that
she was fond of them all,

608
00:45:56,442 --> 00:46:01,130
including the folk who had greeted her
with reluctance and hostility.

609
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:05,381
Even though she might not have
won everybody over completely

610
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:07,604
or even half way, as Tom put it,

611
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:14,518
She cared for Dogville and she had shown
the town her face, her true face.

612
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,979
But was that enough?

613
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:20,500
During Jack McKay's
long lecture that evening

614
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:23,870
she had found herself
in a heart-searching mood.

615
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:28,347
Whether heart-searching or
concern for her future was the cause,

616
00:46:28,348 --> 00:46:32,697
the result was that the
otherwise so lovable Grace

617
00:46:32,698 --> 00:46:36,856
indulged in a pretty shady
piece of provocation.

618
00:46:36,857 --> 00:46:40,707
So you agree that
the windows of St. Bridget's,

619
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:43,107
at the first time you saw them,

620
00:46:43,108 --> 00:46:46,016
didn't live up to their reputation.

621
00:46:46,615 --> 00:46:52,471
I don't think it is the
position of the church itself.

622
00:46:52,496 --> 00:46:56,089
Maybe it's the light in Los Angeles...

623
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:02,160
and the mosaic glass in those windows
they kind of collide,

624
00:47:05,342 --> 00:47:07,694
I remember thinking that.

625
00:47:09,387 --> 00:47:14,158
I think we've talked long enough about
the way we remembering seeing things.

626
00:47:14,267 --> 00:47:15,576
Don't you?

627
00:47:17,103 --> 00:47:23,209
Why don't we talk about something
that we can see right now?

628
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:29,506
There is not much to see around here.
Wretched town.

629
00:47:30,741 --> 00:47:32,968
Why don't we talk about the view?

630
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:44,471
I don't go out much.
The sun and my skin.

631
00:47:45,672 --> 00:47:49,067
Yesterday I was walking
in Chuck's apple trees.

632
00:47:50,927 --> 00:47:57,809
If you go right up to the edge of the cliff
you just manage to peer round Ben's garage

633
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:01,579
and you get a view of your house
from the side facing the gorge.

634
00:48:02,188 --> 00:48:08,043
I didn't realize that there
was windows behind there.

635
00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:15,467
Huge windows.
There must be a wonderful view.

636
00:48:16,952 --> 00:48:19,471
Would you mind if I opened them?

637
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:07,392
You're no fool, Miss Grace.
You're no fool.

638
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,088
You probably see that those curtains
are hard to open.

639
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:14,274
Sorry!

640
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:23,741
And obviously concluded that it's because
they're not used very often.

641
00:49:25,893 --> 00:49:32,541
But the view's good, entrancing even.

642
00:49:36,278 --> 00:49:44,782
So, ask me, why a man who loves the light
hang these heavy curtains?

643
00:49:55,297 --> 00:49:59,817
Yes, I'm blind.

644
00:50:00,176 --> 00:50:01,876
Blind.

645
00:50:09,602 --> 00:50:17,530
So please go
and let me be that on my own.

646
00:50:27,704 --> 00:50:35,620
Is Switzerland they call it
the Alpengluehen.

647
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:43,401
That's the light that reflects
from the highest peaks

648
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:48,906
after the sun goes down
behind the mountains.

649
00:50:51,058 --> 00:50:52,993
But now it's gone.

650
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:19,965
It was in complete silence
that the people of Dogville

651
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:22,379
turned up for the meeting
at the mission house

652
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,609
two weeks to the day since the beautiful
fugitive had come to town.

653
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:33,014
Grace was standing beside Tom,
watching them convene,

654
00:51:33,015 --> 00:51:37,286
and knew inside herself that
this might well be the last time

655
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:40,313
she would see these
now so familiar faces.

656
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:46,044
She had at least two of them against her,
and even one would have been too many.

657
00:51:47,154 --> 00:51:50,031
Welcome good people of Dogville.

658
00:51:50,032 --> 00:51:57,764
Two weeks... two weeks have passed
and it is time for your verdict.

659
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:02,042
Is it right that she should
be here while we talk?

660
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:04,933
Well, Mrs. Henson, when Grace
first came she made no attempt

661
00:52:04,934 --> 00:52:06,380
to hide her weakness from us.

662
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:10,728
So I think it is only right
we be as open with her,

663
00:52:10,729 --> 00:52:14,665
tell her to her face
if we want her to leave.

664
00:52:15,097 --> 00:52:17,324
No, Mrs. Henson is right.

665
00:52:17,643 --> 00:52:22,871
Nobody should be prevented from
speaking their mind out of politeness.

666
00:52:23,856 --> 00:52:25,833
I'll wait at the mine.

667
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:29,003
And if the vote says
that I should leave,

668
00:52:29,004 --> 00:52:33,433
then I'll take the path across
the mountains, while it's still light.

669
00:52:34,366 --> 00:52:38,386
And the things I've borrowed,
if you could, return them to everybody.

670
00:52:38,412 --> 00:52:39,411
Of course!

671
00:52:39,412 --> 00:52:42,057
Nobody has to see me before I go.

672
00:52:42,415 --> 00:52:46,060
Martha, if you will just ring the bell
then I'll understand.

673
00:52:46,294 --> 00:52:49,397
I don't... how do...
am I gonna ring the bell?

674
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:53,734
Just ring it for every
vote that lets me stay.

675
00:52:53,968 --> 00:53:00,825
I will count. And if it doesn't
reach fifteen, then I'll leave.

676
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:15,489
Tom is anxious to speak in her behalf,
but I think he's had his allotted time.

677
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:21,011
We know his view. We respect it.
And now he must respect ours.

678
00:53:21,953 --> 00:53:26,790
Grace pulled her bundle out from under the
bureau to change into her own clothes,

679
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:31,604
only to discover that somebody had been
in it and left a loaf of bread.

680
00:53:33,507 --> 00:53:36,400
Next to it was a folded sheet of paper.

681
00:53:36,426 --> 00:53:39,261
It was a map Tom had drawn.

682
00:53:39,262 --> 00:53:42,973
He had known where the bundle was
and had put it there.

683
00:53:42,974 --> 00:53:45,392
It showed the path across the mountain.

684
00:53:45,393 --> 00:53:50,873
And all the dangerous spots were furnished
with witty horrific little sketches.

685
00:53:52,484 --> 00:53:54,358
But there was more.

686
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:57,134
Several people had the same idea.

687
00:53:57,135 --> 00:54:00,906
They had eased gifts
into the bundle for her.

688
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:05,870
Jason's beloved little penknife lay there,
all polished and shiny.

689
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:08,647
And a pie from Ma
Ginger and Gloria.

690
00:54:08,648 --> 00:54:12,111
And some clothing and
matches, and a hymnal.

691
00:54:12,377 --> 00:54:17,899
Grace opened it at number 18, where Martha
always had trouble with fingering.

692
00:54:19,217 --> 00:54:26,031
And between the pages lay a dollar bill
Martha alone could not have afforded it.

693
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,352
Grace had friends in Dogville.
That was for sure.

694
00:54:31,353 --> 00:54:35,249
Whether they were few or
many did not matter a jot.

695
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:40,796
Grace had bared her throat to the town
and it had responded with a great gift:

696
00:54:41,113 --> 00:54:43,173
With friends.

697
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:52,170
No gangster could deprive her
of this meeting with the township,

698
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:54,486
no matter how many guns in the world.

699
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:57,912
And should the strokes of
the bell did not reach 15,

700
00:54:57,913 --> 00:55:00,839
she knew now that she
meant something to the town

701
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,050
and that her stay had been of significance.

702
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:09,490
Not much, perhaps, but nevertheless,
a trace she had left.

703
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:14,328
And the first in her young life
in which she took pride.

704
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:32,053
Grace stiffened as the bell began its toll.

705
00:56:16,288 --> 00:56:19,766
Fourteen. Grace counted.

706
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:27,449
So McKay must have voted for her after all,
and if so, why not Chuck, too?

707
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:11,649
Everyone?

708
00:57:13,175 --> 00:57:14,860
- Chuck!
- Chuck!

709
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:16,737
Everyone.

710
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:20,741
I think they like you here.

711
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:44,306
The period of spring and early summer
proved a happy one for Grace.

712
00:57:44,747 --> 00:57:48,041
Martha rang the hours,
conducting her through the day.

713
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:53,105
So she could serve as eyes for McKay,
a mother for Ben,

714
00:57:54,006 --> 00:57:59,279
friend for Vera,
and brains for Bill...

715
00:58:08,729 --> 00:58:11,401
And one day it had
occurred to Grace

716
00:58:11,402 --> 00:58:15,277
to tread the pedals herself
so to get Martha to agree

717
00:58:15,278 --> 00:58:18,696
to play a couple of paper notes,
just to empty the bellows naturally

718
00:58:18,697 --> 00:58:22,926
so that they wouldn't be left under
pressure and thus be spoiled.

719
00:58:23,576 --> 00:58:29,165
And now they had tacitly agreed that as
long as it was Grace who trod the pedals,

720
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:32,435
Martha could play without
feeling any guilt.

721
00:58:36,631 --> 00:58:41,968
To Tom's pop, the old doctor, who imagined
he had a new ailment every single day

722
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:43,851
and was thus increasingly addicted

723
00:58:43,852 --> 00:58:47,266
to the simpler coordination tests
from his medical school days,

724
00:58:47,267 --> 00:58:52,204
she had to be severe, telling him
that there was nothing wrong with him.

725
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,874
And now, since the town had agreed

726
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:59,818
that everyone was to give
according to his abilities

727
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:01,720
she received wages, not much,

728
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:05,949
but enough to save up for
the first of the tiny china figurines

729
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,880
from the row of seven
that had stood for so long

730
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:11,482
gathering dust in the
window of the store.

731
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:17,561
And she dreamed that in time she would
be able to acquire them all.

732
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:24,126
Slowly those alabaster hands
turned into a pair of hands

733
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:28,499
that could have belonged to anyone
in any little rural community.

734
00:59:29,598 --> 00:59:33,698
And three weeks later she
triumphantly moved into a place

735
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:36,188
Tom and Ben had secretly restored,

736
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:41,275
namely the old mill, which had once held
the town's are crusher,

737
00:59:41,276 --> 00:59:45,630
but of which only the heavy
flywheel now remained.

738
00:59:52,745 --> 00:59:53,645
Thanks.

739
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,724
That's what I am talking about
with the freight industry.

740
00:59:57,416 --> 01:00:00,853
Miss Laura had thrown that out,
it was no use to anybody.

741
01:00:02,047 --> 01:00:06,525
A good thing, in the wrong place.
But with my truck... You know.

742
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,236
You shouldn't poke fun at
the freight industry, that's all.

743
01:00:10,512 --> 01:00:13,615
No, you're right, Ben.
They shouldn't.

744
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,122
Grace!

745
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:24,042
What?

746
01:00:24,734 --> 01:00:27,704
I just had to tell you that I
had a really selfish reason

747
01:00:27,705 --> 01:00:29,641
for voting to keep you in Dogville.

748
01:00:34,078 --> 01:00:35,344
What was it?

749
01:00:37,122 --> 01:00:42,601
It was such a relief when you turned up and
you were the one all the men had eyes for.

750
01:00:43,045 --> 01:00:48,774
You know, Tom and them.
I've had to put up with it for so long..

751
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:52,986
Frankly, I just didn't have
the energy for it anymore.

752
01:00:53,262 --> 01:00:55,739
They'll always have eyes for you, Liz.

753
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:03,263
You know that.. They will.
You are beautiful.

754
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:04,623
Thank you.

755
01:01:06,191 --> 01:01:10,462
The very latest development,
now that summer was at its peak,

756
01:01:10,487 --> 01:01:14,299
was that Grace had been given leave
to help Chuck in the orchard.

757
01:01:14,949 --> 01:01:18,209
And every day at 5,
once their work was done,

758
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,913
she could appreciate that
actually McKay was right;

759
01:01:21,914 --> 01:01:27,645
The shadow of the spire did indeed
point at Ma Ginger's store.

760
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:36,511
But today the tower did not only announce
that it was time to go shopping but also,

761
01:01:36,512 --> 01:01:40,074
by a signal which nobody despite
Martha's initial concern

762
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:43,295
could have confused with
the ringing of the hours,

763
01:01:43,393 --> 01:01:48,748
a warning that somebody was approaching
via Canyon Road from Georgetown.

764
01:01:48,815 --> 01:01:54,712
For the first time in living memory
law enforcers had come to Dogville!

765
01:02:03,704 --> 01:02:05,139
Evenin' sir.

766
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,810
Is this the whole place?

767
01:02:10,878 --> 01:02:13,564
- There's a town hall?
- No.

768
01:02:13,714 --> 01:02:15,691
I got me a notice to paste up.

769
01:02:15,716 --> 01:02:18,777
We got the mission house.
That do you?

770
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:20,404
Sure.

771
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:22,656
What'd she do?

772
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:28,370
Missing! That's all it says.
I guess somebody's been missing her.

773
01:02:28,437 --> 01:02:31,122
Heard tell she was last seen around here.

774
01:02:31,856 --> 01:02:34,292
We've putting these things
all over the county.

775
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,752
And if somebody sees her,
they ought to go to the police?

776
01:02:38,112 --> 01:02:40,131
I guess that's the idea.

777
01:03:12,062 --> 01:03:14,706
These men were never gonna give in easily.

778
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:20,128
Now these posters they hang
all over in the county.

779
01:03:21,654 --> 01:03:24,573
Which means nobody suspects
she's right here with us.

780
01:03:24,574 --> 01:03:28,493
But it was a policeman, Tom.
Isn't it a duty to respond to the police?

781
01:03:28,494 --> 01:03:36,937
I mean, legally speaking.
I'm sorry, I just.. when I get upset.

782
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:41,297
She's just a missing person.
She hasn't done anything. He even said so.

783
01:03:41,298 --> 01:03:42,925
I think you should vote again.

784
01:03:42,926 --> 01:03:48,613
Why? We can't resort to plebiscites
time and time again.

785
01:03:49,765 --> 01:03:56,496
Come on. Who's really got cold feet
because of her picture on a piece of paper?

786
01:04:19,376 --> 01:04:24,683
The 4th of July came with the huge
clouds of seeds from some remote meadow

787
01:04:24,684 --> 01:04:28,880
gracefully floating down Elm Street
in the early evening.

788
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:34,824
Today was a day for celebration.
Nobody was to worry about the hard times.

789
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:38,536
And Grace could stop at Ma Ginger's
window quite content:

790
01:04:38,813 --> 01:04:42,865
To ascertain that only two of the
little china figurines remained,

791
01:04:42,866 --> 01:04:44,483
and were thus the only two

792
01:04:44,484 --> 01:04:48,254
she had not yet been able to
save up enough to purchase.

793
01:04:52,575 --> 01:04:54,552
- It looks great, girls..
- Uh-huh..

794
01:04:56,662 --> 01:05:01,308
Grace, could you put in a couple of hours
with me in the orchard again today?

795
01:05:01,584 --> 01:05:04,436
It's really nice down
there with the sunshine!

796
01:05:04,503 --> 01:05:10,192
Chuck, it's the fourth of July!
What are you talking about sunshine for?

797
01:05:11,301 --> 01:05:14,362
Have you turned into a romantic like me?

798
01:05:18,308 --> 01:05:19,951
We're gonna have fun.

799
01:05:21,102 --> 01:05:23,246
And in the winter we'll all starve...

800
01:05:23,856 --> 01:05:26,834
Even Ben's taking the day off.

801
01:05:28,401 --> 01:05:30,461
- Hi!
- Hi, Tom!

802
01:05:30,612 --> 01:05:32,588
Grace, you've got a moment?

803
01:05:34,825 --> 01:05:35,925
Now?

804
01:05:36,993 --> 01:05:40,638
Yeah. I've got something
interesting to tell you.

805
01:05:42,415 --> 01:05:44,516
Well, it has to be quick.

806
01:05:52,132 --> 01:05:54,484
I've got so much going on in my head...

807
01:05:55,803 --> 01:05:58,572
That must be very tiring for you!

808
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:03,076
I think I've done a pretty good analysis
of the folks in this town

809
01:06:06,312 --> 01:06:12,418
and I think I understand them
in a meaningful way.

810
01:06:14,487 --> 01:06:20,343
But when I come to decipher you,
I get absolutely nowhere.

811
01:06:20,534 --> 01:06:25,306
You know Liz...
Liz is easy to read.

812
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:31,103
And there was some attraction between us,

813
01:06:33,922 --> 01:06:36,525
but as I can see right through her,

814
01:06:37,217 --> 01:06:40,570
intellectually I mean, I
can see right through her,

815
01:06:40,722 --> 01:06:48,453
my desire is purely of a physical nature.

816
01:06:50,897 --> 01:06:58,738
But with you, it's more...
it's more complicated.

817
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:00,757
What are you trying to say?

818
01:07:03,993 --> 01:07:06,721
No, I should get it clear in my head first.

819
01:07:09,123 --> 01:07:11,809
Are you trying to say that...

820
01:07:13,836 --> 01:07:16,188
you're in love with me?

821
01:07:17,965 --> 01:07:26,976
No, I wouldn't.. love is...
It's not... It's a big word...

822
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:30,417
Yeah.

823
01:07:34,772 --> 01:07:36,124
Yeah.

824
01:07:38,151 --> 01:07:39,585
That's good!

825
01:07:43,447 --> 01:07:44,840
Because...

826
01:07:48,786 --> 01:07:52,222
I think that I am in love with you, too.

827
01:07:53,749 --> 01:07:55,893
Very interesting, isn't it?

828
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,857
I mean it's interesting
in a psychological...

829
01:08:08,096 --> 01:08:12,575
Did they call you?
I think they are calling you.

830
01:08:15,604 --> 01:08:17,580
I didn't hear them.

831
01:08:20,942 --> 01:08:22,210
No.

832
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:29,508
You should probably get back anyway.

833
01:08:32,328 --> 01:08:35,848
I will see you at the wedding.
Next celebration..

834
01:09:10,781 --> 01:09:14,843
This year I didn't bring any notes with me.

835
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:18,305
Because I'm not gonna pretend
I can read them.

836
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:24,019
Which brings me to a point.
A point I wanna make.

837
01:09:24,878 --> 01:09:28,857
And that point is you, Grace.

838
01:09:29,716 --> 01:09:36,531
Yes. You have made Dogville
a wonderful place to live in.

839
01:09:37,182 --> 01:09:43,788
As a matter of fact, somebody tells me they
ran into grumpy old Chuck down the street

840
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,249
and he was actually smiling.

841
01:09:48,067 --> 01:09:55,049
Well, I've never seen your smile, Grace,
but I will bet you I could describe it.

842
01:09:56,951 --> 01:10:01,832
Because it obviously has
every color that's reflected

843
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:05,360
from the shiniest prism in the world.

844
01:10:06,084 --> 01:10:10,171
You probably have a face to match that.
Does she have a face to match that, Tom?

845
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:12,423
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm...? - Yes, sir.

846
01:10:12,424 --> 01:10:17,112
I bet she does.
We are proud to have you among us.

847
01:10:18,263 --> 01:10:24,577
And we thank you for
showing us who you are.

848
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:27,121
Here to you, Grace.

849
01:10:27,855 --> 01:10:30,583
Stay with us as long as you damn please.

850
01:10:54,214 --> 01:10:58,735
A police car has just been seen in town and
it has just made the turn up Canyon Road!

851
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:00,652
So he will be here any minute.

852
01:11:00,804 --> 01:11:02,322
Shall I ring the bell?

853
01:11:03,181 --> 01:11:06,200
No, Martha.
Grace probably heard.

854
01:11:07,436 --> 01:11:09,078
We'll get rid of 'em quickly.

855
01:11:10,188 --> 01:11:11,372
Don't worry.

856
01:11:24,952 --> 01:11:28,388
Should have been celebrating myself,
if this hadn't come up.

857
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:31,767
Have to change this missing person notice.

858
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:34,895
It's that lady again.

859
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:38,189
That's why she disappeared.

860
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:44,320
She's wanted in connection with some
bank robberies on the West Coast.

861
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:47,407
When did these robberies take place?

862
01:11:47,765 --> 01:11:49,451
Last couple of weeks.

863
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,079
You don't get much news up here,
do you?

864
01:11:53,104 --> 01:11:55,748
My dad's radio only plays music.

865
01:11:57,858 --> 01:12:00,836
Well, all know is that
they say she's dangerous,

866
01:12:00,945 --> 01:12:05,467
and that anyone with any information
about her had better call us pronto.

867
01:12:05,783 --> 01:12:07,342
That's the law.

868
01:12:22,757 --> 01:12:27,779
Two weeks!
Can't be our girl, Tom.

869
01:12:28,138 --> 01:12:30,138
No, she's been here all the time.

870
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:31,098
Right!

871
01:12:31,099 --> 01:12:33,576
She couldn't have done
what they are accusing her of.

872
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:36,537
No, that's true, Tom,
you are right.

873
01:12:36,687 --> 01:12:39,790
Still it's an unpleasant business
just the same.

874
01:12:47,156 --> 01:12:50,467
Grace was the same
and so was the town.

875
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,288
That the gangsters had fixed to
have charges made against Grace

876
01:12:55,289 --> 01:12:58,860
in their effort to neutralize her
came as no surprise.

877
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:03,380
But everything had changed a little
yet again.

878
01:13:03,381 --> 01:13:06,981
I'm telling you, you have exactly
the same kind of little lump

879
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:10,261
in exactly the same spot
on the other side of your back.

880
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:11,054
Really!

881
01:13:11,055 --> 01:13:21,747
I can only assume that it belongs
on your body, but you're the doctor, so...

882
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,843
Well, it's very unlikely,
don't you think?

883
01:13:24,844 --> 01:13:28,362
That a cancer would develop
in such precise symmetry.

884
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:32,361
Mr. Edison, please. We've
been over this so many times.

885
01:13:32,362 --> 01:13:34,243
Anything is possible.

886
01:13:34,244 --> 01:13:38,253
I think you have to accept
the fact that you are

887
01:13:38,254 --> 01:13:41,943
an exceptionally healthy
elderly gentleman.

888
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:44,877
I'm gonna rest just the same.

889
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,438
I'll see you in the morning.

890
01:13:46,796 --> 01:13:48,231
I hope so.

891
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:51,150
What? What did they say?

892
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:58,449
Well, they couldn't really argue
that anything had changed.

893
01:13:58,641 --> 01:14:03,663
But by not telling the police they felt
they were committing a crime themselves.

894
01:14:07,275 --> 01:14:09,235
- I think I should leave.
- No..

895
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,610
Enough is enough.

896
01:14:10,611 --> 01:14:12,546
I suggested the opposite.

897
01:14:13,489 --> 01:14:14,715
You did?

898
01:14:15,115 --> 01:14:18,719
From a business perspective...

899
01:14:20,037 --> 01:14:26,559
from a business perspective, your presence
in Dogville has become more costly.

900
01:14:27,169 --> 01:14:30,730
Because it's more dangerous
for them to have you here,

901
01:14:30,797 --> 01:14:33,107
not that they don't want you,

902
01:14:33,716 --> 01:14:39,322
since they feel there should be
some counterbalance,

903
01:14:40,098 --> 01:14:42,183
some quid pro quo.

904
01:14:42,184 --> 01:14:45,161
That sound like words
that the gangsters would use...

905
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:50,207
There is also more of an incentive
if you don't wanna stay.

906
01:14:52,151 --> 01:14:55,898
See, with all those wanted posters
hanging around the place,

907
01:14:55,899 --> 01:14:59,184
I can hardly think of
anywhere else you could hide.

908
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:04,263
So what's the counterbalance
that you suggested?

909
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:14,214
They wanted you to work longer hours,
but instead what I proposed is

910
01:15:14,215 --> 01:15:20,069
that you just pay a visit to folks
twice a day now.

911
01:15:20,094 --> 01:15:23,797
That way it would seem that you're
willing to contribute more,

912
01:15:23,798 --> 01:15:26,711
without actually lengthening
your day too much.

913
01:15:26,726 --> 01:15:29,787
It's just a way of heading off
any unpleasantness.

914
01:15:35,109 --> 01:15:42,115
Well, it sounds a little peculiar
and difficult to put into practice.

915
01:15:42,116 --> 01:15:44,218
That's what I thought.

916
01:15:44,534 --> 01:15:48,121
Martha she said she would ring
her bell every half hour,

917
01:15:48,122 --> 01:15:51,349
so you could keep track of
your new schedule.

918
01:15:54,128 --> 01:15:55,961
Then, they are all willing to let me stay?

919
01:15:55,962 --> 01:16:03,861
No. See, Mrs. Henson she also
thought we should cut your pay.

920
01:16:04,262 --> 01:16:08,151
Merely a symbolic gesture.
You see...

921
01:16:08,152 --> 01:16:13,047
the word dangerous
on that poster worried her.

922
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:17,744
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

923
01:16:17,745 --> 01:16:21,778
If I have to work harder,
longer hours for less pay,

924
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:25,007
then I'm willing to do that.
Of course, I am.

925
01:16:26,658 --> 01:16:31,871
I just wanna be sure that they
wouldn't prefer that I left town.

926
01:16:31,872 --> 01:16:33,473
Of course not.

927
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:38,353
You think this is for the best?

928
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:41,105
I know it is.

929
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:52,225
I have to get some sleep.
My days are gonna be much busier now.

930
01:16:52,767 --> 01:16:54,201
Sorry.

931
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:25,315
Tom, I just need to know something...

932
01:17:27,842 --> 01:17:31,571
you know the card that the man
in the car gave you...

933
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:32,697
Yeah.

934
01:17:38,519 --> 01:17:40,871
Did you show it to anyone?

935
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:46,293
Come on, Grace!
I burned it first thing.

936
01:17:46,693 --> 01:17:50,321
I've been so silly.
Of course you did.

937
01:17:50,322 --> 01:17:51,882
It's alright.

938
01:17:52,532 --> 01:17:57,286
No, it's not alright. I hate it
for you to see me like this.

939
01:17:57,287 --> 01:17:59,681
I can't bare that I'm doubting you.

940
01:17:59,999 --> 01:18:02,851
I'm sorry.
Good night.

941
01:18:22,979 --> 01:18:27,857
Everybody was really against any changes
to Grace's working conditions at all

942
01:18:27,858 --> 01:18:30,877
when the subject occasionally
came up in conversation.

943
01:18:38,743 --> 01:18:43,181
Oh, Ben had declared in sympathy that he
wouldn't accept any more work than before,

944
01:18:43,206 --> 01:18:45,308
and Grace was grateful for that,

945
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:49,312
even if he was a bit drunk
when he said so.

946
01:18:52,715 --> 01:18:59,280
Busy minute became busy hours,
and busy hours became busy days.

947
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:03,884
And irrespective of whether they thought
the idea of increasing Grace's services

948
01:19:03,885 --> 01:19:06,644
had any fairness and
justification to it or not,

949
01:19:06,645 --> 01:19:09,832
it didn't seem to make anyone any happier.

950
01:19:09,857 --> 01:19:12,251
More to the contrary.

951
01:19:14,028 --> 01:19:17,756
Grace, oh.. You have to be more careful.

952
01:19:18,032 --> 01:19:21,968
Liz wasn't very careful either,
but she didn't break our glasses.

953
01:19:22,244 --> 01:19:25,184
I think you need to understand
that Mr. Henson

954
01:19:25,185 --> 01:19:28,401
works very hard
to grind off any traces of mould.

955
01:19:28,833 --> 01:19:32,921
And it makes the glass weak.
I thought you knew that.

956
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:37,024
It won't happen again.
Of course, I'll pay for it.

957
01:19:37,675 --> 01:19:41,612
No, of course not. You don't have to
pay us for it. We'll get over it.

958
01:19:43,556 --> 01:19:46,841
And off she went to keep
her appointment with Chuck

959
01:19:46,842 --> 01:19:49,602
to free the last tree
trunks from the grass

960
01:19:49,603 --> 01:19:52,915
in order to keep the ever busy mice away.

961
01:19:53,607 --> 01:19:57,526
She was in a hurry and took the shortcut
between the gooseberry bushes,

962
01:19:57,527 --> 01:19:59,921
only to be brought up by a shout.

963
01:19:59,947 --> 01:20:01,966
- Grace!
- Yes!

964
01:20:04,618 --> 01:20:10,747
Oh, I didn't see that you just
raked the path. I'm sorry.

965
01:20:10,748 --> 01:20:12,977
It isn't that I've just raked it.

966
01:20:13,084 --> 01:20:17,880
The idea is that people can pass
around the bushes completely.

967
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:20,107
I prefer it that way,
as you should know.

968
01:20:21,259 --> 01:20:26,763
I thought that these chains were put up
to make a path between the bushes.

969
01:20:26,764 --> 01:20:29,057
They were put up there
to protect the bushes.

970
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:31,017
It is not supposed to be a pathway.

971
01:20:31,018 --> 01:20:32,954
But everyone goes this way.

972
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,190
Dear, that's right.
They have been living here for years.

973
01:20:37,191 --> 01:20:38,959
You haven't been here that long.

974
01:20:40,444 --> 01:20:44,427
Are you saying, that I am
less entitled to use the shortcut

975
01:20:44,428 --> 01:20:46,949
because I haven't
always lived here?

976
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:47,850
No, of course not.

977
01:20:48,576 --> 01:20:52,430
"No, I just thought it pleased you
to be here, that's all."

978
01:20:52,956 --> 01:20:55,308
"Go on.
Go on, it's alright."

979
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,459
I'll see you this afternoon..

980
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:02,607
"And I'll rake those bushes like they've
never been raked before, I promise."

981
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:14,493
I'm sorry about that branch.
There were so many apples on it.

982
01:21:16,311 --> 01:21:19,874
"I should have cut that branch,
but I got greedy."

983
01:21:21,024 --> 01:21:24,086
Is it greedy to want to feed your family?

984
01:21:29,699 --> 01:21:31,760
So how come you don't like me?

985
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,891
Why do you ask me that?

986
01:21:38,499 --> 01:21:40,601
"When I get close to you,
you edge away."

987
01:21:42,503 --> 01:21:45,523
"- No, I don't.
- You did so."

988
01:21:46,424 --> 01:21:49,193
When we were thinning the seedlings
in the bottom row.

989
01:21:50,261 --> 01:21:53,739
How am I supposed to show you what I do
if I ain't allow to touch you?

990
01:21:55,724 --> 01:21:57,743
You tried to kiss me.

991
01:22:06,109 --> 01:22:11,548
Vera never took any interest in the apples.
She hates the orchard.

992
01:22:13,158 --> 01:22:18,596
"The is the first time I've ever met
anyone, who understand about the apples."

993
01:22:19,622 --> 01:22:21,891
Sorry... it made me so happy.

994
01:22:26,045 --> 01:22:27,254
It's alright.

995
01:22:27,255 --> 01:22:29,964
"No, it ain't alright.
I reckon the stuff about..."

996
01:22:29,965 --> 01:22:32,369
"the apples is just
words in your mouth."

997
01:22:33,427 --> 01:22:35,822
If you can't really share my pleasure...

998
01:22:36,305 --> 01:22:37,656
I do.

999
01:22:38,808 --> 01:22:42,995
Vera wants me to picking apples
from trees that are barely in the ground.

1000
01:22:43,813 --> 01:22:46,331
Things take time. That's love!

1001
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:51,586
Seeing what they need and
respecting those needs.

1002
01:22:51,611 --> 01:22:54,071
"If anyone understands that, it's you.
At least I thought so."

1003
01:22:54,072 --> 01:22:55,447
I do understand that.

1004
01:22:55,448 --> 01:22:57,802
But you edge away when I get close.

1005
01:22:58,201 --> 01:23:02,138
- Why do you find me so repugnant?
- I don't find you repugnant.

1006
01:23:04,165 --> 01:23:05,892
Don't be upset.

1007
01:23:07,418 --> 01:23:11,689
I'm sorry if I doubted you.
It won't happen again.

1008
01:23:13,632 --> 01:23:15,401
I promise you.

1009
01:23:17,887 --> 01:23:20,782
I wouldn't make that promise if I were you.

1010
01:23:26,854 --> 01:23:29,873
"When you fended me off,
a thought came into my mind"

1011
01:23:29,982 --> 01:23:34,711
that made me ashamed.
A thought that you would hate me for.

1012
01:23:35,529 --> 01:23:39,340
"I would never hate you, never."

1013
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:45,221
What?

1014
01:23:47,624 --> 01:23:53,813
"Chuck, I've treated you unfairly.
It's alright to have angry thoughts."

1015
01:23:55,674 --> 01:23:58,692
I thought of turning you in!

1016
01:24:00,553 --> 01:24:03,238
I thought of blackmailing you
into respecting me.

1017
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:18,253
"It means that much to you?
It does, doesn't it?"

1018
01:24:20,614 --> 01:24:23,675
"You've really been alone up here,
haven't you?"

1019
01:24:24,117 --> 01:24:31,015
You haven't had anyone to comfort you
and I should ask you for forgiveness.

1020
01:24:38,422 --> 01:24:40,065
Still friends?

1021
01:25:09,494 --> 01:25:12,722
- Sorry... Were you asleep?
- No.

1022
01:25:13,624 --> 01:25:17,810
"- Do you want me to leave?
- No, I was just resting."

1023
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:24,884
"Awful lot to do here in Dogville,
considering nobody needs anything done."

1024
01:25:27,386 --> 01:25:30,864
Jason wants to sit on my lap all the time.

1025
01:25:34,602 --> 01:25:37,662
I think you're doing a wonderful job.

1026
01:25:39,314 --> 01:25:43,734
You give us all so much.
What Mr. McKay said...

1027
01:25:43,735 --> 01:25:47,380
right on the button..
Right on the button.

1028
01:25:47,822 --> 01:25:50,866
He tried to put his hands on my knee today.

1029
01:25:50,867 --> 01:25:54,804
"Oh, he is blind, after all.
Probably an accident."

1030
01:25:58,082 --> 01:26:04,914
And Ma Ginger got angry at me
for running across the gravel path.

1031
01:26:07,509 --> 01:26:11,153
"Well good. She gets angry at me,"

1032
01:26:13,138 --> 01:26:15,723
which just means that you're one of us now.

1033
01:26:15,724 --> 01:26:18,618
"You can see through it all, can't you?"

1034
01:26:34,535 --> 01:26:37,845
"I'll tell you, I'm gonna be asleep
in two minutes."

1035
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:40,723
What if I don't want you to go to sleep?

1036
01:26:40,957 --> 01:26:43,350
I don't think you have a choice tonight.

1037
01:26:54,512 --> 01:26:56,780
"I do love you, Grace."

1038
01:26:58,056 --> 01:27:04,371
"I'm glad you love me.
I love you, too. I really do."

1039
01:27:08,608 --> 01:27:14,631
"No, I mean, I yearn for you
when I am not with you."

1040
01:27:18,826 --> 01:27:22,888
I yearn for you even
when we're alone like this.

1041
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:32,005
"I yearn to be even closer to you...
to touch you, the way that people..."

1042
01:27:32,006 --> 01:27:34,983
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

1043
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:42,199
The thing that I love about you is
that you don't demand anything of me.

1044
01:27:42,224 --> 01:27:46,536
That we can just be together.

1045
01:27:46,645 --> 01:27:47,912
Yeah.

1046
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:53,418
Yearning will only make it better.

1047
01:28:00,658 --> 01:28:06,473
"Thank you for your words,
your wise wise words."

1048
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:10,267
You're welcome.

1049
01:28:13,337 --> 01:28:15,022
Do you want your shoes off?

1050
01:28:41,407 --> 01:28:45,927
"Jason, what are you doing here?
That's wrong."

1051
01:28:47,161 --> 01:28:50,056
The words have to be divided differently.

1052
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:53,559
Stop it.

1053
01:28:53,834 --> 01:28:56,562
How's that for dividing the words?

1054
01:28:58,756 --> 01:29:01,257
This is not a good day.
Everybody should leave.

1055
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:04,778
"Everybody except Jason.
Jason, I wanna talk to you alone."

1056
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:08,365
What is it?
What's going on?

1057
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:14,061
I can be very bad.
I bet my pa told you.

1058
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:18,124
I don't think that.
I think there is another reason for this.

1059
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:22,193
"I'd love to have you
on my lap all the time,"

1060
01:29:22,194 --> 01:29:24,640
"but I can't, not with
the others here."

1061
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:30,136
"When somebody can't do all the things
they'd like to do for others,"

1062
01:29:30,578 --> 01:29:33,973
sometimes the people they promised get mad.

1063
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:37,685
That's what Mrs. Henson says.

1064
01:29:39,587 --> 01:29:40,712
"Yes, that's true."

1065
01:29:40,713 --> 01:29:44,024
I suppose I know why you won't let
me sit in your lap anymore.

1066
01:29:45,259 --> 01:29:47,551
- Why?
- Because I've been mean lately.

1067
01:29:47,552 --> 01:29:51,907
"Oh, come on. I'm sure you have
your reasons for that."

1068
01:29:52,308 --> 01:29:57,162
"I have been mean to the others, too,
even baby Achilles."

1069
01:29:57,355 --> 01:30:00,540
And he's so tiny he can't put up a fight.

1070
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:04,961
"- It's not right
- No, it's not."

1071
01:30:04,986 --> 01:30:08,464
"I got it coming to me, I know."

1072
01:30:09,073 --> 01:30:10,657
I deserve a spanking.

1073
01:30:10,658 --> 01:30:14,136
What? I should hit you?
I'm not gonna do that.

1074
01:30:14,996 --> 01:30:18,456
Your mother doesn't believe in
physical discipline. I'm not gonna hit you.

1075
01:30:18,457 --> 01:30:23,103
I know. She'd be awful mad
if she found out you whipped me.

1076
01:30:23,837 --> 01:30:26,190
"Oh, I just said I won't do that."

1077
01:30:26,257 --> 01:30:29,374
"It's good having ma
on your side, right?"

1078
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:33,179
"It'd be pretty serious if
she turned against you."

1079
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:36,182
"I am the way I am.
If people in this town don't like me,"

1080
01:30:36,183 --> 01:30:39,244
then there is nothing I can do about that.

1081
01:30:39,978 --> 01:30:42,664
I feel bad I need to be punished.

1082
01:30:42,689 --> 01:30:46,108
"The fact is, I wouldn't have any respect
for you if you don't give me a spanking."

1083
01:30:46,109 --> 01:30:49,111
I don't care how much fun
you think it would be.

1084
01:30:49,112 --> 01:30:51,964
"I'm not gonna spank you, Jason."

1085
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:59,113
"In that case, when Ma gets home maybe
I'll just have to tell her you hit me."

1086
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:01,039
But I just said that I wouldn't!

1087
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,767
I reckon Ma'll take my word for it.

1088
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:08,564
"If you give me that spanking,
nobody's ever have to know."

1089
01:31:14,262 --> 01:31:17,322
Stop it. Get away from Achilles.
Stop it.

1090
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:22,393
I gave his crib a shove.
It's not my fault it didn't tip over.

1091
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:25,312
Don't you touch him.
Move away from the crib.

1092
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:27,790
"Stop it, Jason. Stop it!"

1093
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:29,775
All right. You want a spanking.
I'll give you a spanking...

1094
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:32,003
Come here.
Come here!

1095
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:37,800
- There! There we go.
- That wasn't hard.

1096
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:40,970
It's gotta be hard or it isn't punishment.

1097
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:43,722
- All right.
- Harder!

1098
01:31:45,916 --> 01:31:48,727
"Oh, this is... come on.
All right, that's enough."

1099
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:50,128
That is enough punishment now.

1100
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:53,756
Maybe I should go stand in the corner
and be ashamed?

1101
01:31:53,757 --> 01:31:57,319
I don't care.. Stand in the corner.
Do whatever you gotta do.

1102
01:31:57,344 --> 01:31:59,029
"Hey, there is Pa!"

1103
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:05,392
He's early. I hope there is nothing wrong.

1104
01:32:05,393 --> 01:32:09,675
"Just as Dogville had done from its open,
frail shelf on the mountainside,"

1105
01:32:09,676 --> 01:32:12,452
"quite unprotected
from any capricious storms,"

1106
01:32:13,067 --> 01:32:16,045
"Grace, too, had laid herself open."

1107
01:32:16,863 --> 01:32:22,343
And there she dangled from her frail stalk
like the apple in the Garden of Eden.

1108
01:32:22,618 --> 01:32:26,555
An apple so swollen that
the juices almost ran.

1109
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:32,477
And once again the police
had come to Dogville.

1110
01:32:34,296 --> 01:32:39,967
"I said I'd tell you, to save Martha the
confusion about the ringing. But I forgot."

1111
01:32:39,968 --> 01:32:41,887
They're already down by Canyon Road.

1112
01:32:41,888 --> 01:32:45,223
The fellow in the other car is from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1113
01:32:45,224 --> 01:32:47,325
- You forgot!
- Yah.

1114
01:32:48,017 --> 01:32:50,018
"It is the busy time for the apples,
you know."

1115
01:32:50,019 --> 01:32:51,120
The FBI?

1116
01:32:51,896 --> 01:32:55,792
"They were most interested in hearing
what I'd seen in the past six months,"

1117
01:32:55,942 --> 01:32:58,628
anything related to that wanted poster.

1118
01:32:58,903 --> 01:33:04,592
They asked me if I'd seen any signs
in the woods of anyone camping out there.

1119
01:33:04,617 --> 01:33:07,494
God only knows
what that woman's capable of.

1120
01:33:07,495 --> 01:33:09,579
"You know, she is not capable of anything."

1121
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:11,523
"Well, that's what you say."

1122
01:33:11,524 --> 01:33:15,696
" But it sure didn't sound that way
coming from the laws."

1123
01:33:17,296 --> 01:33:19,898
That's why I felt I had to tell 'em
what I knew.

1124
01:33:22,509 --> 01:33:24,277
What did you tell them?

1125
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,739
"Well, I thought I'd seen something
in the woods recently."

1126
01:33:28,099 --> 01:33:30,658
An item of clothing to be exact.

1127
01:33:30,725 --> 01:33:33,911
It turned out that it was just
an old hat Tom had lost.

1128
01:33:34,146 --> 01:33:37,022
- But it could've been this.
- Chuck.. give me..

1129
01:33:37,023 --> 01:33:41,752
"Expensive, by the feel of it,
and your initials on it."

1130
01:33:44,864 --> 01:33:48,533
I imagine they'd draw the same conclusion
from this as anybody would.

1131
01:33:48,534 --> 01:33:53,389
I told the law it'd take me no time at all
to find this piece of clothing.

1132
01:33:54,164 --> 01:33:57,216
"I reckon we got us
ten minutes, maybe fifteen,"

1133
01:33:57,217 --> 01:33:59,613
" 'fore they start knocking on doors."

1134
01:33:59,753 --> 01:34:04,441
I wouldn't try to run away.
They are sure to see you.

1135
01:34:04,633 --> 01:34:06,568
"Why would I wanna run away, Chuck?"

1136
01:34:06,593 --> 01:34:08,428
"I wouldn't try to holler, either."

1137
01:34:08,429 --> 01:34:10,447
Why would I wanna do that?

1138
01:34:10,472 --> 01:34:12,598
It wasn't me who wanted you here.

1139
01:34:12,599 --> 01:34:15,326
You were far to beautiful and frail
for this place.

1140
01:34:16,769 --> 01:34:19,438
You tricked me into feeling that
I meant something to you.

1141
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:22,041
"It's your own damn fault.
I need your respect, Grace."

1142
01:34:22,483 --> 01:34:25,795
- You have my respect.
- I want your respect.

1143
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:26,720
Don't...!

1144
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:42,769
This is wrong..

1145
01:34:44,338 --> 01:34:50,151
"If I can force the flowers to bloom
early in spring, I can force you..."

1146
01:34:51,177 --> 01:34:52,821
Please...

1147
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:07,877
"Stop it!
Please.. Please... Please, don't!"

1148
01:35:07,986 --> 01:35:10,754
Please! Please...

1149
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:14,466
"Please look at me, talk to me."

1150
01:35:14,658 --> 01:35:18,429
"We're friends, you and my family.."

1151
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,684
Stop it!

1152
01:36:22,765 --> 01:36:24,575
Have you seen Grace?

1153
01:36:25,143 --> 01:36:26,828
She's at my place.

1154
01:36:27,186 --> 01:36:30,748
- Is she busy?
- Not anymore. Go right in.

1155
01:36:55,755 --> 01:36:59,796
Yet again Grace had made a
miraculous escape from her pursuers

1156
01:36:59,797 --> 01:37:02,455
with the aid of the people of Dogville.

1157
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:07,516
"Everyone had covered up for her,
including Chuck, who had to admit"

1158
01:37:07,517 --> 01:37:12,997
that it was probably Tom's hat he'd
mistakenly considered so suspicious.

1159
01:37:27,953 --> 01:37:32,874
"That evening Tom had sensed at once
that something had taken place,"

1160
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:37,479
but had to plead with Grace for ages
before she finally broke down

1161
01:37:37,587 --> 01:37:40,339
and unburdened herself.

1162
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:42,609
- I have to confront him. I mean.
- No!

1163
01:37:42,634 --> 01:37:44,426
- I have no other choice.
- No.

1164
01:37:44,427 --> 01:37:46,397
No one will accept
what he did to you. No one.

1165
01:37:46,398 --> 01:37:47,540
I don't want you to.

1166
01:37:47,555 --> 01:37:53,869
I came here with all these ideas
and these stupid prejudices.

1167
01:37:56,647 --> 01:38:00,191
"He is not strong, Tom."

1168
01:38:00,192 --> 01:38:02,795
"He looks strong, but he's not."

1169
01:38:04,572 --> 01:38:08,133
I'm gonna start looking for a way
to get you out of here.

1170
01:38:20,796 --> 01:38:23,064
The end of the summer had come.

1171
01:38:23,089 --> 01:38:26,883
And in Elm Street the second clutch
of Dogville's scatty squirrels

1172
01:38:26,884 --> 01:38:30,540
scooted in and out of the legs
of children and grown-ups alike

1173
01:38:30,555 --> 01:38:34,617
searching in vain for Elm
Street's non-existent elms.

1174
01:38:36,102 --> 01:38:40,530
"The heat had turned the soil
among the gooseberry bushes to stone,"

1175
01:38:40,531 --> 01:38:42,482
"but Grace did not complain."

1176
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:44,735
"She threw herself into her work,"

1177
01:38:44,736 --> 01:38:49,381
happy that it was something you could
actually grasp between your fingers.

1178
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,742
"Hey, Liz!
Hey, Vera!"

1179
01:38:51,743 --> 01:38:55,178
"Better watch out, Grace.
Vera's got it in for you today."

1180
01:38:56,038 --> 01:38:58,014
What are you talking about?

1181
01:38:59,416 --> 01:39:02,018
Maybe you thought he wouldn't tell me?

1182
01:39:04,879 --> 01:39:06,106
Who?

1183
01:39:07,507 --> 01:39:09,901
You hit Jason.

1184
01:39:11,928 --> 01:39:13,279
I did.

1185
01:39:13,554 --> 01:39:16,073
How could you do such a thing?

1186
01:39:16,767 --> 01:39:21,203
"I know it sounds implausible,
but he was asking for it."

1187
01:39:21,646 --> 01:39:25,040
"It's true, Vera.
He's always asking for it."

1188
01:39:26,942 --> 01:39:29,878
I should have done that myself
a long time ago.

1189
01:39:30,321 --> 01:39:30,915
"Liz!"

1190
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:32,781
"It's your fault,
the way you've spoiled him."

1191
01:39:32,782 --> 01:39:38,929
"I know how much you love him,
Vera. So do I..."

1192
01:39:39,162 --> 01:39:43,225
It won't happen again.
It really won't.

1193
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:48,104
"No. I know it won't, because I'll
never leave them with you again."

1194
01:39:48,756 --> 01:39:51,548
That'd be far too dangerous
for any child of mine.

1195
01:39:51,549 --> 01:39:53,050
I've been tired.

1196
01:39:53,051 --> 01:39:58,614
"Well, maybe you should see about
sleeping at night, like most folks do."

1197
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,116
Sleeping at night?

1198
01:40:01,768 --> 01:40:09,528
Martha saw a certain Tom Edison Jr. sneak
out of her shed early this morning.

1199
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:19,217
"Grace, you won't hear anything from me
about whipping that idiot kid."

1200
01:40:19,451 --> 01:40:23,764
And I'm also grateful to you for turning
Tom's wandering eye away from my skirts.

1201
01:40:24,372 --> 01:40:27,267
"But on the other hand, I'd expected
more from you than that."

1202
01:40:29,586 --> 01:40:31,398
"But if that's
the kind of thing you're after,"

1203
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:33,005
"then I'm sure,
with your innocent look,"

1204
01:40:33,006 --> 01:40:35,883
you will do just fine
in a place like Dogville.

1205
01:40:35,884 --> 01:40:37,579
"It's not what I'm after, Liz."

1206
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:38,413
"Oh, no?"

1207
01:40:38,428 --> 01:40:43,240
We all saw you take his hand to the picnic.
Maybe that wasn't flirting?

1208
01:40:45,268 --> 01:40:49,079
Yes... Maybe I was flirting..

1209
01:40:58,030 --> 01:41:00,443
Next day the weather changed.

1210
01:41:00,444 --> 01:41:04,438
The fog came rolling down
from the mountains.

1211
01:41:04,536 --> 01:41:07,654
"And although there were
no sunsets to be seen,"

1212
01:41:07,655 --> 01:41:10,985
"McKay thought it best
that she sat by him anyway."

1213
01:41:11,209 --> 01:41:14,812
"She had sat by Jack McKay
so many times now,"

1214
01:41:14,838 --> 01:41:19,108
but Jack had not got better at
judging the distance between them.

1215
01:41:19,217 --> 01:41:24,179
"On the contrary, where fingers alone
had previously brushed her young flesh,"

1216
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:29,577
now it was a and that remained in place
throughout the allotted span.

1217
01:41:31,979 --> 01:41:36,709
"The hour in the orchard were long now,
for the harvest was under way."

1218
01:41:36,734 --> 01:41:39,386
"And Grace had long since
given up arguing..."

1219
01:41:39,387 --> 01:41:42,780
"with Chuck's perception that
respect for cultivation,"

1220
01:41:42,781 --> 01:41:48,220
"harvest, and fruit could be directly
measured in provision of carnality."

1221
01:41:49,412 --> 01:41:54,584
"Though reluctant to leave Grace alone,
Tom wandered around quite often now,"

1222
01:41:54,585 --> 01:41:59,188
lost in thought as he tried to crack
the problem of possible escape.

1223
01:41:59,923 --> 01:42:05,636
"And as Grace's wages no longer found
their way to her purse he had stepped in,"

1224
01:42:05,637 --> 01:42:08,689
and together they had
triumphantly picked up

1225
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:12,711
the last of the seven figurines
from Ma Ginger's windows.

1226
01:42:22,486 --> 01:42:24,129
What's the matter?

1227
01:42:25,113 --> 01:42:28,925
- Nothing.
- Are the police on Canyon Road again?

1228
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:34,242
No. This is just girl talk.

1229
01:42:37,667 --> 01:42:41,795
"It's funny you should mention
Canyon Road, though... right, Martha?"

1230
01:42:41,796 --> 01:42:44,673
- She was just there this morning.
- Yeah.

1231
01:42:44,674 --> 01:42:48,677
"On the way home from church...
-You see so much more on foot, you know."

1232
01:42:48,678 --> 01:42:53,991
"When you're in a car you never notice
the apple orchard, for example."

1233
01:42:56,685 --> 01:43:01,206
You can only see it from one spot
on Canyon Road.

1234
01:43:01,524 --> 01:43:05,252
"- Do you know that spot, Martha?
- Yes I do."

1235
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:11,508
And did you stop there to enjoy
the view this morning?

1236
01:43:11,534 --> 01:43:15,220
"It's harvest time, you know,
in the orchard after all."

1237
01:43:15,245 --> 01:43:18,747
The old masters always loved
a good harvest theme.

1238
01:43:18,748 --> 01:43:26,874
"Redolent, with fertility, not to mention
sensibility or even eroticism."

1239
01:43:30,885 --> 01:43:33,965
"But how silly of me
to ask you that, Martha,"

1240
01:43:33,966 --> 01:43:36,417
"because you already
said you did."

1241
01:43:39,685 --> 01:43:42,079
"She saw you, Grace.."

1242
01:43:46,443 --> 01:43:49,586
She saw you..

1243
01:43:51,738 --> 01:43:55,133
Behind this pile of broken limbs..

1244
01:43:56,618 --> 01:43:58,261
With Chuck...

1245
01:44:01,831 --> 01:44:06,227
He said it wasn't the first time
you'd made advances towards him.

1246
01:44:07,754 --> 01:44:12,316
He never told me before because
he wanted to spare my feelings.

1247
01:44:13,843 --> 01:44:19,156
"He's a withdrawn and primitive man,"

1248
01:44:21,809 --> 01:44:26,979
but at heart he's loyal
and he is good.

1249
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:30,417
What do you want with my husband?

1250
01:44:31,735 --> 01:44:38,194
I don't want anything with
your husband or anybody.

1251
01:44:41,036 --> 01:44:43,805
What about Tom and the hand-holding
at the picnic?

1252
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:46,808
That's different. I like Tom.

1253
01:44:48,543 --> 01:44:50,794
But you don't like Chuck.

1254
01:44:50,795 --> 01:44:53,726
"Liz and Martha are behind me,
when I tell you..."

1255
01:44:53,727 --> 01:44:56,467
"that I'm going to have
to teach you a lesson."

1256
01:44:56,468 --> 01:44:59,278
I believe in education.

1257
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:04,040
Vera!

1258
01:45:04,141 --> 01:45:09,288
No. I believe smashing them is
less a crime than making them.

1259
01:45:11,064 --> 01:45:15,168
Vera.. remember how I
taught your children..

1260
01:45:15,193 --> 01:45:16,173
"What?"

1261
01:45:16,174 --> 01:45:19,182
"Remember how happy
you were, when I..."

1262
01:45:19,239 --> 01:45:20,188
When you what?

1263
01:45:20,189 --> 01:45:23,075
When I taught your children
about the doctrine of stoicism

1264
01:45:23,076 --> 01:45:25,386
and they finally understood it.

1265
01:45:27,205 --> 01:45:29,540
"All right...
For that, I'm gonna be lenient."

1266
01:45:29,541 --> 01:45:33,311
"I'm going to break two
of your figurines first,"

1267
01:45:35,922 --> 01:45:39,580
"and if you can demonstrate
your knowledge..."

1268
01:45:39,581 --> 01:45:45,234
"of the doctrine of stoicism
by holding back your tears,"

1269
01:45:45,848 --> 01:45:50,786
I'll stop.
Have you got that?

1270
01:46:04,032 --> 01:46:09,329
"In her lifetime Grace had considerable
practice at constraining her emotions,"

1271
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:13,392
and would never have believed
it would be hard to control them now.

1272
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:17,967
But as the porcelain
pulverized on the floor

1273
01:46:17,968 --> 01:46:21,909
it was as if it were
human tissue disintegrating.

1274
01:46:23,467 --> 01:46:28,322
The figurines were the offspring of the
meeting between the township and her.

1275
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:31,899
"They were the proof
that in spite of everything,"

1276
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:35,255
"her suffering had created
something of value."

1277
01:46:35,896 --> 01:46:38,665
Grace could not longer cope.

1278
01:46:39,775 --> 01:46:45,422
"For the first time since her childhood,
she wept."

1279
01:47:14,767 --> 01:47:18,283
"Grace went to see Tom that very night,
and informed him..."

1280
01:47:18,284 --> 01:47:22,175
"that she was ready to follow his advice
and leave the township."

1281
01:47:23,066 --> 01:47:26,417
"And since Tom had just
made up his mind that a third party"

1282
01:47:26,418 --> 01:47:29,474
"would be needed to ensure
the success of an escape,"

1283
01:47:29,573 --> 01:47:33,510
they agreed that Ben possessed
the greatest potential.

1284
01:47:34,744 --> 01:47:38,765
"But it was a case where money
was required, Tom concluded,"

1285
01:47:38,873 --> 01:47:42,390
"and estimated,
that considering the times and all,"

1286
01:47:42,391 --> 01:47:45,837
"ten dollars would suffice
for Ben and his truck."

1287
01:47:45,838 --> 01:47:49,066
- But we don't have ten dollars.
- No. We borrow it.

1288
01:47:50,885 --> 01:47:53,529
- From whom?
- From Dad.

1289
01:47:54,306 --> 01:47:56,764
He has more than that
in the medicine closet.

1290
01:47:56,765 --> 01:47:59,451
I talk to him in the morning
and arrange a loan.

1291
01:48:00,102 --> 01:48:01,870
But you have a word with Ben...

1292
01:48:01,895 --> 01:48:04,748
"It's the end of the week,
he's bound to be flat broke."

1293
01:48:06,108 --> 01:48:08,793
Tell your father
that I will pay him back.

1294
01:48:09,110 --> 01:48:10,629
Of course.

1295
01:48:15,242 --> 01:48:16,467
Thank you.

1296
01:48:19,954 --> 01:48:23,516
You are always rescuing me.

1297
01:48:27,212 --> 01:48:30,439
I can't believe that you go on
being there for me.

1298
01:48:33,135 --> 01:48:34,277
Good night..

1299
01:48:37,346 --> 01:48:38,989
You should get some sleep.

1300
01:48:48,106 --> 01:48:51,042
Grace went to see Ben next morning.

1301
01:48:55,239 --> 01:48:59,117
"When Grace presented the payment
as compensation between friends,"

1302
01:48:59,118 --> 01:49:01,577
"Ben did not object too heartily,"

1303
01:49:01,578 --> 01:49:05,297
considering the trouble he could receive
from the rest of the towns-people

1304
01:49:05,298 --> 01:49:07,276
when they realized
what had happened.

1305
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:10,770
"Perhaps they'd all be relieved
that she was out of their lives,"

1306
01:49:11,087 --> 01:49:14,648
but somehow
Grace wasn't too sure of that.

1307
01:49:15,175 --> 01:49:16,863
"Ben agreed to drive her"

1308
01:49:16,864 --> 01:49:21,888
"even though he wasn't out to profit from
other folks' misfortunes, as he put it."

1309
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:24,933
I don't wanna profit from
other folks' misfortunes.

1310
01:49:24,934 --> 01:49:26,017
No...

1311
01:49:26,018 --> 01:49:27,207
The fact was...

1312
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:30,841
that Ben would have driven to the gates
of Hell and back for ten dollars

1313
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:35,193
And the criminal aspect bugged him less
than Grace would ever have guessed;

1314
01:49:35,194 --> 01:49:38,713
He had freighted all kinds of things
in his day.

1315
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:42,634
The plan was for Grace to hide
among the apples.

1316
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:47,763
"Knowing the exact time to harvest is the
greatest art of all, Chuck had said,"

1317
01:49:47,872 --> 01:49:52,834
and the time had come
for the apples and for Grace.

1318
01:49:52,835 --> 01:49:54,937
"Grace, where 've you been?"

1319
01:49:54,962 --> 01:49:56,670
If I'd displayed the same indifference

1320
01:49:56,671 --> 01:49:58,965
to the timing of my chores
I'd be in for a whippin'.

1321
01:49:58,966 --> 01:50:00,567
Now get a move on!

1322
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:05,139
"I'm sorry, Olivia.
I had to talk to Ben about something."

1323
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:06,573
June is near to bursting.

1324
01:50:06,598 --> 01:50:09,267
"She can't use the pot on her own,
as you well know."

1325
01:50:09,268 --> 01:50:10,755
It ain't fittin' to toy with her...

1326
01:50:10,756 --> 01:50:13,256
just 'cause she's crippled
and can't help herself.

1327
01:50:17,484 --> 01:50:21,009
"The evening before the escape
Tom tactically thought..."

1328
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:25,268
"it best not to press his desires
of the flesh too hard upon Grace,"

1329
01:50:25,867 --> 01:50:30,346
and instead he adopted a more
sensitive approach.

1330
01:50:32,165 --> 01:50:35,725
But there is a right
and a wrong time to plant seeds

1331
01:50:35,726 --> 01:50:38,572
and you can't plant
seeds in the winter.

1332
01:50:39,713 --> 01:50:43,901
That's true.
But I love you...

1333
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:46,904
- I know.
- And you love me

1334
01:50:47,138 --> 01:50:50,223
and we will meet again in love
and in freedom.

1335
01:50:50,224 --> 01:50:52,118
Absolutely.

1336
01:50:53,061 --> 01:50:55,417
"I shouldn't be ashamed
wanting you, should I?"

1337
01:50:55,418 --> 01:50:57,022
"It's nothing to be ashamed of."

1338
01:50:57,023 --> 01:50:58,373
No...

1339
01:50:59,524 --> 01:51:00,452
No.

1340
01:51:00,453 --> 01:51:03,305
No... no. It's lovely.
It's lovely that we want each other.

1341
01:51:05,196 --> 01:51:07,632
- But not this way.
- No.

1342
01:51:07,866 --> 01:51:09,759
It's not right.

1343
01:51:20,669 --> 01:51:24,001
"The next morning, when Grace
wanted to slip down to Ben's..."

1344
01:51:24,002 --> 01:51:25,576
"as invisibly as possible,"

1345
01:51:25,591 --> 01:51:28,424
it seemed to Grace
that the entire township

1346
01:51:28,425 --> 01:51:30,706
was up and about
at the same time.

1347
01:51:31,263 --> 01:51:32,066
"Grace!"

1348
01:51:32,067 --> 01:51:33,750
"Yes, Vera..."

1349
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:36,349
"If you think that by hitting my child"

1350
01:51:36,350 --> 01:51:39,297
"you can get out of working for me,
think again."

1351
01:51:39,312 --> 01:51:41,106
"Why don't you just come by as planned,"

1352
01:51:41,107 --> 01:51:46,252
and we'll find something
where you won't be able to harm anyone.

1353
01:51:46,277 --> 01:51:49,297
- At twelve o'clock?
- Yes.

1354
01:51:49,364 --> 01:51:53,176
Why are you taking your copious
belongings around with you?

1355
01:51:53,284 --> 01:51:55,344
Afraid you are gonna loose them?

1356
01:51:55,453 --> 01:51:58,514
"Grace, Ben's hauling apples today
so we won't be loading glasses."

1357
01:51:58,748 --> 01:52:00,508
But that don't mean
you're off work.

1358
01:52:00,509 --> 01:52:02,736
Dad wants you to repack
the whole last load.

1359
01:52:03,335 --> 01:52:05,896
Maybe you can do it better
and we'll have an extra crate.

1360
01:52:06,338 --> 01:52:09,640
"An old crate like that may not
have much value in your eyes,"

1361
01:52:09,641 --> 01:52:10,994
"but this is Dogville."

1362
01:52:11,176 --> 01:52:13,111
We're not wealthy here.

1363
01:52:14,013 --> 01:52:15,805
"And if your hands get a bit red, well,"

1364
01:52:15,806 --> 01:52:18,182
"I've got a tip about something
you can rub on 'em."

1365
01:52:18,183 --> 01:52:19,167
"Grace!"

1366
01:52:19,168 --> 01:52:21,338
"Oh, Martha..."

1367
01:52:23,563 --> 01:52:26,231
We have to wash the flagstones
at the foot of the steps again.

1368
01:52:26,232 --> 01:52:28,985
Dirt has gone blown under the door.
I can't get the door open.

1369
01:52:28,986 --> 01:52:34,298
Where have you been?
Harvest is the holiest time of the year.

1370
01:52:34,782 --> 01:52:37,176
Does it not sound like something
you could have said?

1371
01:52:37,953 --> 01:52:43,265
"I'll be down in a minute, Chuck.
I'll bring the crates down."

1372
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:44,809
Good.

1373
01:52:45,501 --> 01:52:47,811
"As Grace hastened to the garage,"

1374
01:52:47,837 --> 01:52:51,076
she grew more and more
pleased with the decision

1375
01:52:51,077 --> 01:52:53,285
to keep her departure under wrap.

1376
01:52:54,218 --> 01:52:58,596
There was actually quite a bit of work
Dogville didn't need doing

1377
01:52:58,597 --> 01:53:02,868
that its residents would have to
carry out for themselves in future.

1378
01:53:03,852 --> 01:53:06,405
"Yeah, er, Grace,
I don't like having to say this,"

1379
01:53:06,406 --> 01:53:09,342
"but I'd like to ask
if I could have the money up front."

1380
01:53:09,942 --> 01:53:12,986
"See, it's always the way
in the freight industry."

1381
01:53:12,987 --> 01:53:16,273
"Once you deliver a load
you ain't got much to bargain with,"

1382
01:53:16,274 --> 01:53:17,614
"if you catch my drift."

1383
01:53:17,615 --> 01:53:19,574
Of course. Here's the money.

1384
01:53:19,575 --> 01:53:22,619
"Not that this is a professional job,
of course."

1385
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,513
"- Don't get out..."
"- All right, Ben."

1386
01:53:24,997 --> 01:53:26,223
...'till I give the say-so!

1387
01:53:47,352 --> 01:53:53,374
"Canyon Road snaked down the valley
and away, and Grace went too,"

1388
01:53:53,608 --> 01:53:57,553
and with every bend
the township and its noises

1389
01:53:57,554 --> 01:54:00,850
faded ever more mercifully behind her.

1390
01:54:50,037 --> 01:54:52,014
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah.

1391
01:54:52,581 --> 01:54:56,060
There are a hell lot of...
A lot of police up ahead.

1392
01:54:57,628 --> 01:54:59,646
I wasn't expecting that.

1393
01:55:00,923 --> 01:55:06,236
It's more dangerous than I thought.
We'll have to go back.

1394
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:10,198
No! We can't do that.

1395
01:55:11,892 --> 01:55:13,034
It's just...

1396
01:55:13,268 --> 01:55:16,882
"If this was a professional
transport job, you know,..."

1397
01:55:16,883 --> 01:55:20,385
"paid proper like...
it'd be a lot easier, but..."

1398
01:55:22,485 --> 01:55:24,504
But it's been paid for...

1399
01:55:24,863 --> 01:55:31,861
"Yeah, but, in the freight industry
carrying dangerous load it cost more."

1400
01:55:33,662 --> 01:55:36,140
"A surcharge, they call it."

1401
01:55:37,166 --> 01:55:43,230
"If this were a professional job,
I could just charge you."

1402
01:55:45,632 --> 01:55:48,443
"But Ben, I don't have any more money."

1403
01:55:53,515 --> 01:55:56,242
"Oh, that's no good then."

1404
01:56:00,271 --> 01:56:07,187
"You said once, you said once, that there
aren't many pleasures in my life."

1405
01:56:10,448 --> 01:56:13,676
"And you know,
I go to Miss Laura once a week."

1406
01:56:14,994 --> 01:56:21,802
And you got me to see that it weren't
nothing to be ashamed of.

1407
01:56:26,673 --> 01:56:29,566
I was gonna go there tonight...

1408
01:56:31,968 --> 01:56:35,947
and of course it costs me.

1409
01:56:37,683 --> 01:56:42,036
"I mean, not as much as..."

1410
01:56:43,772 --> 01:56:51,112
"not as much as a surcharge
for dangerous goods, but still..."

1411
01:56:54,323 --> 01:56:56,425
"it does cost me, you know."

1412
01:56:57,034 --> 01:56:59,803
"No, Ben, no... please don't..."

1413
01:57:00,246 --> 01:57:04,641
"It's not personal, Grace.
It's not personal. I just..."

1414
01:57:06,293 --> 01:57:09,187
"I have to take due payment, that's all."

1415
01:57:10,005 --> 01:57:13,233
I don't...
I don't have a choice.

1416
01:57:14,009 --> 01:57:17,320
I can't buck the freight
in this big craft.

1417
01:57:20,765 --> 01:57:26,537
We're parked in the square in Georgetown.
Right outside the church.

1418
01:57:27,772 --> 01:57:30,041
You'd better keep your voice down.

1419
01:57:34,111 --> 01:57:35,779
"No, Ben..."

1420
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:41,594
"This ain't somethin' I'm proud of, Grace.
Don't go thinking that."

1421
01:58:14,275 --> 01:58:17,083
"Grace fell asleep on the long highway,"

1422
01:58:17,084 --> 01:58:22,575
"thanks to her healthy ability to push
any unpleasantness around her far away."

1423
01:58:22,576 --> 01:58:27,846
"A generous God had blessed her with the
rare talent of being able to look ahead,"

1424
01:58:28,205 --> 01:58:30,307
and only ahead.

1425
01:58:31,792 --> 01:58:36,027
"And later when the truck slowed
down about to reach its destination"

1426
01:58:36,028 --> 01:58:38,714
"and she slowly returned
to consciousness,"

1427
01:58:38,715 --> 01:58:42,384
she had no way of knowing
how long she had slept.

1428
01:58:42,385 --> 01:58:47,365
All she knew was that she would be
happy to see the light of day again.

1429
01:58:49,767 --> 01:58:52,328
And then she heard the dog.

1430
01:58:58,025 --> 01:59:01,630
All your fondness for apples seems
less and less believable.

1431
01:59:02,363 --> 01:59:03,923
You've bruised 'em.

1432
01:59:16,668 --> 01:59:19,771
We had a meeting last night
at the mission house.

1433
01:59:22,048 --> 01:59:25,467
"They said you might be
going to try to run away,"

1434
01:59:25,468 --> 01:59:30,156
"so when I discovered you'd hidden
yourself away on my truck,"

1435
01:59:31,475 --> 01:59:34,952
I didn't have no choice but
to bring you back to Dogville.

1436
01:59:36,605 --> 01:59:39,665
In the freight industry
we can't take sides.

1437
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:27,207
"It didn't help Grace that the
first theft ever registered in Dogville"

1438
02:00:27,208 --> 02:00:29,070
"had taken place
the previous evening,"

1439
02:00:29,071 --> 02:00:33,509
when most people were assembled
for the town meeting.

1440
02:00:33,867 --> 02:00:36,698
Old Tom Edison Senior
had a considerable sum

1441
02:00:36,699 --> 02:00:39,288
of money stolen
from his medicine closet

1442
02:00:39,289 --> 02:00:41,874
"and suspicion soon fell on Grace,"

1443
02:00:41,875 --> 02:00:46,980
who had apparently been planning an escape
that would surely require funding.

1444
02:00:47,255 --> 02:00:51,818
Grace chose to remain silent
in the face of these new charges.

1445
02:00:53,094 --> 02:00:57,253
"And then Bill, who had lately
improved his engineering skills"

1446
02:00:57,254 --> 02:00:59,168
"to an astonishing degree,"

1447
02:00:59,309 --> 02:01:02,316
"had, by way of his first
design, implemented"

1448
02:01:02,317 --> 02:01:04,966
"a kind of
escape prevention mechanism."

1449
02:01:05,273 --> 02:01:11,337
"Beautiful it might not have been,
but effective he dared say it was."

1450
02:01:22,289 --> 02:01:26,852
"Grace, we don't like having to do this."

1451
02:01:27,544 --> 02:01:32,399
We don't have much of a choice
if we are to protect our community.

1452
02:01:32,632 --> 02:01:37,028
Could you... Do you mind moving?
Try moving.

1453
02:01:57,156 --> 02:01:58,382
It works.

1454
02:01:59,491 --> 02:02:05,931
We had to make this heavy enough so that
it can only move where the ground's level.

1455
02:02:05,998 --> 02:02:09,476
And the ground is level in town.

1456
02:02:14,589 --> 02:02:16,649
May I go now?

1457
02:02:22,306 --> 02:02:25,908
I have to figure out
how I'm going to get into my house.

1458
02:02:27,977 --> 02:02:31,747
"Or is that part of the punishment,
having to sleep outdoors?"

1459
02:02:32,106 --> 02:02:34,774
"No, no no Grace."

1460
02:02:34,775 --> 02:02:39,046
Don't think of this as punishment.
Not at all!

1461
02:02:39,947 --> 02:02:45,135
"Bill, he made the chain long enough
so that you can sleep in your bed."

1462
02:02:56,046 --> 02:02:57,689
"Grace, six o'clock."

1463
02:03:00,884 --> 02:03:03,278
"Yes, Mrs. Henson."

1464
02:03:31,872 --> 02:03:34,206
I couldn't run the risk
of Dad turning me down.

1465
02:03:34,207 --> 02:03:37,060
"But, they think it was
me that took the money."

1466
02:03:37,878 --> 02:03:40,021
'Cause I told them so.

1467
02:03:44,008 --> 02:03:45,944
You did what?

1468
02:03:46,511 --> 02:03:49,638
"First they suspected me, but then
I convinced them that it was you,"

1469
02:03:49,639 --> 02:03:52,491
since you were the one
using the medicine closet.

1470
02:03:53,851 --> 02:03:54,869
Why?

1471
02:03:55,312 --> 02:03:57,229
Because I'm here to do
the thinking for you.

1472
02:03:57,230 --> 02:04:01,667
"If we are to have the slightest
chance of getting you out of here,"

1473
02:04:02,902 --> 02:04:05,879
they can never know how
close we really are.

1474
02:04:07,406 --> 02:04:11,093
They can't know I'm trying to help you.

1475
02:04:13,161 --> 02:04:15,376
"If they knew it was me
that took the money,"

1476
02:04:15,377 --> 02:04:17,442
"I wouldn't be here
talking to you now."

1477
02:04:20,335 --> 02:04:22,979
"Please don't disappear, Tom."

1478
02:04:28,885 --> 02:04:30,695
I need you.

1479
02:04:33,681 --> 02:04:37,201
I'll break this one...
with some thinking.

1480
02:04:47,152 --> 02:04:51,104
"It was not Grace's pride
that kept her going during the days"

1481
02:04:51,105 --> 02:04:54,700
"when fall came and the trees
were losing their leaves,"

1482
02:04:54,701 --> 02:04:58,317
"but more of the trance-like state
that descends on animals"

1483
02:04:58,318 --> 02:05:00,080
"whose lives are threatened,"

1484
02:05:00,081 --> 02:05:04,460
"a state in which the body reacts
mechanically, in a low, tough gear,"

1485
02:05:04,461 --> 02:05:07,546
without too much painful reflection.

1486
02:05:07,547 --> 02:05:12,318
Like a patient passively letting
his disease hold sway.

1487
02:05:13,262 --> 02:05:17,892
"And now that Vera had received proof
that it was in fact Chuck..."

1488
02:05:17,893 --> 02:05:20,767
"who'd forced his attentions on Grace,"

1489
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:23,204
she was meaner than ever.

1490
02:05:26,482 --> 02:05:32,087
"Had Grace had friends in Dogville they,
too, fell like the leaves."

1491
02:05:33,572 --> 02:05:38,298
The most towns-people of the male sex
now visited Grace at night

1492
02:05:38,299 --> 02:05:40,647
to fulfill their sexual needs.

1493
02:05:41,955 --> 02:05:44,915
It had occurred to the children
to give the bell an extra ring

1494
02:05:44,916 --> 02:05:50,647
"every time such an act had been
consummated, much to Martha's confusion."

1495
02:05:52,674 --> 02:05:57,737
But since the chain had been attached
things had become easier for everyone:

1496
02:05:59,139 --> 02:06:02,974
"the harassment in bed did not have to be
kept so secret anymore,"

1497
02:06:02,975 --> 02:06:06,644
because they couldn't really be
compared to a sexual act.

1498
02:06:06,645 --> 02:06:11,608
"They were embarrassing in the way it is
when a hillbilly has his way with a cow,"

1499
02:06:11,609 --> 02:06:13,168
but no more than that.

1500
02:06:15,113 --> 02:06:17,029
Tom saw everything.

1501
02:06:17,030 --> 02:06:22,469
"It pained him, and the sexual visits
were a particularly severe blow."

1502
02:06:29,126 --> 02:06:34,588
"But he supported her as best he could,
the way a spider supports,"

1503
02:06:34,589 --> 02:06:38,401
when it has been tangled
in its own web by the wind.

1504
02:06:39,343 --> 02:06:40,528
Tom!

1505
02:06:47,309 --> 02:06:50,287
Everything I tried to do went wrong.

1506
02:06:51,313 --> 02:06:54,649
I can't come up with the answer
I was looking for.

1507
02:06:54,650 --> 02:06:59,504
"You'll come up with it, you'll see.
You're very clever."

1508
02:07:01,032 --> 02:07:06,137
- We provoked them.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

1509
02:07:11,083 --> 02:07:12,145
We provoked them.

1510
02:07:12,146 --> 02:07:15,002
Now it is time for us
to provoke ourselves.

1511
02:07:15,003 --> 02:07:16,295
What do you mean?

1512
02:07:16,296 --> 02:07:21,134
"I mean, by showing them some trust."

1513
02:07:21,135 --> 02:07:25,613
"It all started with a meeting, so it
will be logical to end it with one, too."

1514
02:07:25,763 --> 02:07:30,075
You'll talk and they'll listen.
They can't refuse to listen.

1515
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:33,158
What will I say?

1516
02:07:33,159 --> 02:07:35,772
Everything.
You'll say everything.

1517
02:07:35,773 --> 02:07:36,645
"Everything?"

1518
02:07:36,646 --> 02:07:38,691
"Yeah, the truth. The Truth."

1519
02:07:38,692 --> 02:07:41,360
Just the truth about each and
every one of them.

1520
02:07:41,361 --> 02:07:43,613
I don't think they are
gonna want to hear that.

1521
02:07:43,614 --> 02:07:49,761
"I know, I know. It is like a child
who doesn't want to take his medicine."

1522
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:54,092
"They'll be furious at first,
but in the end"

1523
02:07:54,093 --> 02:07:56,667
"they'll see it is for their own good."

1524
02:07:56,668 --> 02:08:00,646
Just don't be hateful.
Don't be reproving.

1525
02:08:01,839 --> 02:08:04,567
"If anybody can do it,
Grace, you can."

1526
02:08:05,259 --> 02:08:10,127
They'll all realize that this weapon
and this understanding and injustice

1527
02:08:10,128 --> 02:08:12,918
has only one true victim
and that's you.

1528
02:08:13,059 --> 02:08:16,954
And from there it is only
one small step to forgiveness.

1529
02:08:18,023 --> 02:08:23,252
"You've done some hard
thinking, Tom Edison."

1530
02:08:23,902 --> 02:08:28,840
I'm sure it is an excellent plan.
I'm sure.

1531
02:08:48,134 --> 02:08:51,510
"If forgiveness was close at hand
in the mission house,"

1532
02:08:51,511 --> 02:08:53,499
"they were all hiding it well."

1533
02:08:54,849 --> 02:08:57,785
It hadn't been easy for Tom
to get them there.

1534
02:08:58,227 --> 02:09:04,374
Appealing to consciences stowed farther
and farther away by their owners every day

1535
02:09:04,399 --> 02:09:08,909
"as if they were as fragile as
Henson's glasses after polishing,"

1536
02:09:08,910 --> 02:09:10,849
"had proved quite a task."

1537
02:09:11,406 --> 02:09:15,409
"But if one was going, the others
might as well come along, too,"

1538
02:09:15,410 --> 02:09:18,346
so nobody could talk
behind anybody's back.

1539
02:09:20,415 --> 02:09:23,977
Tom had set the scene for Grace's speech.

1540
02:09:24,252 --> 02:09:29,899
"Now she'd have to sink or swim,
and sincerity be brought to bear."

1541
02:09:31,551 --> 02:09:34,319
While Grace addressed
the silent congregation

1542
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,388
in the mission house on Elm Street

1543
02:09:36,389 --> 02:09:40,701
the first of the early autumn snowstorms
embraced the town.

1544
02:09:41,185 --> 02:09:44,925
The snowflakes dusted down
over the old buildings

1545
02:09:44,926 --> 02:09:47,634
as if this were just any old town.

1546
02:09:47,901 --> 02:09:52,087
"And they played in the branches and twigs
from which the apples had hung,"

1547
02:09:52,112 --> 02:09:54,001
but luckily the harvest was home

1548
02:09:54,002 --> 02:09:56,908
and via the freight industry
had found a market

1549
02:09:56,909 --> 02:10:00,178
despite the ever disappointing prices.

1550
02:10:00,328 --> 02:10:03,288
Grace had presented
her story with clarity.

1551
02:10:03,289 --> 02:10:06,416
She had not embellished or understated.

1552
02:10:06,417 --> 02:10:11,606
"And just as she finished the snowflakes
all at once stopped tumbling down,"

1553
02:10:12,298 --> 02:10:19,222
"leaving Dogville clad in the daintiest,
whitest blanket of snow imaginable."

1554
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:40,592
I don't think it went very well.

1555
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:43,678
It's fine. You did good.

1556
02:10:51,627 --> 02:10:56,315
"The snow had come early,
perhaps too early."

1557
02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:59,777
A misplaced augury of conciliation.

1558
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:03,555
"Tom looked around, worried:"

1559
02:11:03,556 --> 02:11:07,642
Vera's teeth were clenched.
She was the first to speak.

1560
02:11:07,643 --> 02:11:10,311
Copious lies. Just lies.

1561
02:11:10,312 --> 02:11:13,196
"Yes, Tom. It doesn't accord
with the perceptions I got"

1562
02:11:13,197 --> 02:11:15,010
"of this town and
its residents."

1563
02:11:15,734 --> 02:11:19,737
"I'm a doctor, damn it, I don't need
anyone to tell me if I'm sick or not."

1564
02:11:19,738 --> 02:11:21,923
"What do you have to say
for yourself, Tom?"

1565
02:11:22,032 --> 02:11:24,426
Maybe it's time you picked sides!

1566
02:11:24,951 --> 02:11:27,244
Are you for us or against us?

1567
02:11:27,245 --> 02:11:30,163
Liz is right. We've been
far too indulgent with Tom.

1568
02:11:30,164 --> 02:11:33,976
"Tom, I got to tell you.
Even I have trouble defending that girl."

1569
02:11:34,419 --> 02:11:39,023
"With your help, which I prefer to think
was accidental, Tom,"

1570
02:11:39,548 --> 02:11:46,387
she has managed to spread bitterness
and troubles throughout this whole town.

1571
02:11:46,388 --> 02:11:49,015
"She has to go.
How do we get rid of her, Tom?"

1572
02:11:49,016 --> 02:11:50,641
"So how do we do it, Tom?"

1573
02:11:50,642 --> 02:11:55,062
"I agree, Tom. You brought her in here.
You got to figure out how to get her out."

1574
02:11:55,063 --> 02:11:57,666
Without her lies
and accusations spreading.

1575
02:12:00,569 --> 02:12:02,879
I asked you here to listen.

1576
02:12:05,866 --> 02:12:08,092
You only came to defend yourselves.

1577
02:12:08,451 --> 02:12:12,930
I'm sorry
it's quite a blow to me...

1578
02:12:14,165 --> 02:12:21,148
"to see all of my friends act this way,
so uncivilized."

1579
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:20,662
"Your plan didn't work
out very well, did it?"

1580
02:13:21,731 --> 02:13:24,457
"- You'll think of another one.
- No,"

1581
02:13:26,526 --> 02:13:29,671
"No more plans, I promise."

1582
02:13:34,951 --> 02:13:38,137
They asked me to choose
between you and them.

1583
02:13:40,248 --> 02:13:43,769
That's not difficult on a day like today.
I love you.

1584
02:13:44,835 --> 02:13:51,775
"You may be stronger, it's true,
but the ideals, the ideals we share."

1585
02:13:52,885 --> 02:13:58,490
You're exhausted. Lie down.

1586
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:11,294
"I've chosen, Grace.
I have chosen you."

1587
02:14:15,740 --> 02:14:20,721
Now it is the time!
The time we've been waiting for.

1588
02:14:25,667 --> 02:14:28,310
We free ourselves of Dogville.

1589
02:14:34,634 --> 02:14:41,281
"You're right. You're right, Tom.
It'd be so easy to make love right now."

1590
02:14:43,392 --> 02:14:49,355
They may kill us any minute..
It would be the perfect romantic ending.

1591
02:14:49,356 --> 02:14:52,125
I know. I feel it too. I love you.

1592
02:14:55,737 --> 02:14:58,548
"It would be so beautiful, but from ..."

1593
02:14:59,824 --> 02:15:04,680
"from the point of view of our love,
so completely wrong."

1594
02:15:08,749 --> 02:15:11,936
We were to meet in freedom.

1595
02:15:24,557 --> 02:15:26,950
"You're cold now, Grace."

1596
02:15:36,569 --> 02:15:41,130
I've just rejected everybody
I've ever known in your favor.

1597
02:15:43,366 --> 02:15:45,461
"Wouldn't it be worth compromising,"

1598
02:15:45,462 --> 02:15:48,773
"just one of your ideals
just a little to ease my pain?"

1599
02:15:51,999 --> 02:15:55,352
"Everybody in this town
has had your body, but me."

1600
02:15:56,337 --> 02:15:58,897
We're the ones supposed to be in love.

1601
02:16:01,759 --> 02:16:04,194
My darling Tom.

1602
02:16:07,806 --> 02:16:11,034
You can have me if you want me.

1603
02:16:13,979 --> 02:16:16,539
Just do what the others do.

1604
02:16:17,816 --> 02:16:19,542
Threaten me...

1605
02:16:19,859 --> 02:16:23,035
"Tell me that you'll
turn me in to the law,"

1606
02:16:23,036 --> 02:16:25,808
"to the gangsters, and I promise you,"

1607
02:16:27,033 --> 02:16:30,636
you can take whatever
it is you want from me.

1608
02:16:32,079 --> 02:16:34,140
I trust you...

1609
02:16:36,501 --> 02:16:40,271
but maybe you don't trust yourself?

1610
02:16:40,796 --> 02:16:47,343
"Perhaps you've been tempted, you've been
tempted to join the others and force me."

1611
02:16:47,344 --> 02:16:50,573
Perhaps that's why you're so upset.

1612
02:16:50,681 --> 02:16:53,366
All I've ever tried to do is help you.

1613
02:16:53,725 --> 02:16:58,580
I'm just asking if you're afraid
that you could be so human.

1614
02:16:58,605 --> 02:17:01,542
"No, I'm not afraid of that.
Not in the least."

1615
02:17:02,776 --> 02:17:04,545
Good.

1616
02:17:08,906 --> 02:17:12,093
Let tomorrow bring that it's gonna bring.

1617
02:17:14,579 --> 02:17:20,351
"It's not a crime to
doubt yourself, Tom.."

1618
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:25,064
but it's wonderful that you don't.

1619
02:17:27,467 --> 02:17:29,610
I can't find the rest.

1620
02:17:32,679 --> 02:17:35,491
Maybe I should go out
for a couple of minutes.

1621
02:17:37,559 --> 02:17:40,120
Take a walk or something...
I don't know.

1622
02:17:42,523 --> 02:17:44,833
To get it all out of my system.

1623
02:17:47,110 --> 02:17:49,212
Trudge the streets..

1624
02:17:50,113 --> 02:17:54,217
Listen to the wind as it passes through
the woods up through the valley

1625
02:17:55,034 --> 02:17:56,677
and all that.

1626
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:02,558
"You go to sleep, though..."

1627
02:18:06,253 --> 02:18:12,251
You go to sleep
and I will be back very soon.

1628
02:18:20,976 --> 02:18:23,978
Of course it was all a load of nonsense.

1629
02:18:23,979 --> 02:18:29,334
"If anybody was capable of keeping track
of ideals and reality, he was."

1630
02:18:29,360 --> 02:18:35,173
"After all, it was his job.
Moral issues were his home ground."

1631
02:18:35,948 --> 02:18:38,624
To think that he might
doubt his own purity

1632
02:18:38,625 --> 02:18:41,147
was really to think
very little of him.

1633
02:18:41,912 --> 02:18:44,432
Tom was angry.

1634
02:18:46,834 --> 02:18:50,521
"And in the midst of it all,
he discovered why."

1635
02:18:51,088 --> 02:18:54,215
"It was not because of he'd
been wrongly accused,"

1636
02:18:54,216 --> 02:18:57,152
but because the charges were true!

1637
02:18:58,595 --> 02:19:04,410
His anger consisted of a most unpleasant
feeling of being found out!

1638
02:19:07,228 --> 02:19:10,481
It was all quite a blow
to the young philosopher!

1639
02:19:10,482 --> 02:19:12,413
"And realistically enough,..."

1640
02:19:12,414 --> 02:19:17,279
"he thought that if the doubt
was already present, it could grow."

1641
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:19,429
Perhaps so great that one day

1642
02:19:19,430 --> 02:19:23,729
it would prove detrimental
to his entire moral mission.

1643
02:19:23,869 --> 02:19:26,121
Tom stopped.

1644
02:19:26,122 --> 02:19:31,626
He almost began to shake when the threat
to his career as a writer dawned upon him.

1645
02:19:31,627 --> 02:19:34,865
It didn't take him long
to agree with himself

1646
02:19:34,866 --> 02:19:37,382
that the risk was too great to run.

1647
02:19:37,383 --> 02:19:42,154
The danger Grace was to the town
she was also to him!

1648
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:44,430
Tom did not like it.

1649
02:19:44,431 --> 02:19:48,618
And he was man enough
to take action to prevent it.

1650
02:19:50,979 --> 02:19:55,694
Fortunately Tom was as conscientious
as regards his future profession...

1651
02:19:55,695 --> 02:19:57,662
as he was practical.

1652
02:19:57,694 --> 02:20:01,947
"He allowed sincerity and ideals
plenty of room in his life,"

1653
02:20:01,948 --> 02:20:05,885
"without getting ""sentimental"" about it,
as he would put it."

1654
02:20:06,661 --> 02:20:10,421
"Throwing away a document
that might be of significance to Tom"

1655
02:20:10,422 --> 02:20:12,954
"and with him
future generation of readers"

1656
02:20:12,955 --> 02:20:15,747
"as the basis of a novel
or indeed a trilogy,"

1657
02:20:15,794 --> 02:20:19,298
"was not an act he was
so stupid to commit,"

1658
02:20:19,299 --> 02:20:24,486
although he had to admit that in a moment
of weakness he might have said he would.

1659
02:20:27,889 --> 02:20:30,460
"Before returning to the
meeting that night"

1660
02:20:30,461 --> 02:20:34,714
"Tom opened the little drawer he
had open the night of Grace's arrival,"

1661
02:20:35,356 --> 02:20:37,498
and found it still there:

1662
02:20:37,732 --> 02:20:40,710
The card from the gangster in the car.

1663
02:21:01,880 --> 02:21:05,734
"The next day the sun was shining
in the brisk autumn sky,"

1664
02:21:05,759 --> 02:21:08,361
and the snow was long since gone.

1665
02:21:10,306 --> 02:21:12,746
For the first time for
ages the pile driver

1666
02:21:12,747 --> 02:21:14,600
could be heard in the marshlands

1667
02:21:14,601 --> 02:21:20,782
as it hammered in the piles for what might
or what might not be a penitentiary.

1668
02:21:21,149 --> 02:21:27,404
"Grace opened her eyes after an almost
unconscious sleep, and was confused."

1669
02:21:27,405 --> 02:21:30,862
"Judging by the light
coming through the cracks in the walls,"

1670
02:21:30,863 --> 02:21:32,575
"it had to be nearly midday."

1671
02:21:32,576 --> 02:21:37,890
"The grey hour as Jack McKay
for some reason called noon in Dogville,"

1672
02:21:37,957 --> 02:21:40,974
"being a man of many
ideas and proclivities,"

1673
02:21:40,975 --> 02:21:45,324
"quite a few of which Grace would
prefer to remain ignorant of."

1674
02:21:46,131 --> 02:21:48,674
But why had nobody roused her?

1675
02:21:48,675 --> 02:21:51,093
Nobody had hammered furiously at her door.

1676
02:21:51,094 --> 02:21:56,449
Not a child had thrown mud into her bed
or broken her remaining windowpanes.

1677
02:21:57,350 --> 02:21:59,685
Now she remembered.

1678
02:21:59,686 --> 02:22:05,124
"She recalled the meeting the previous day,
and puzzled still more."

1679
02:22:05,316 --> 02:22:11,005
Why had she not been confronted with the
outcome of that meeting? Or even killed?

1680
02:22:11,489 --> 02:22:16,260
It was quite unlike Dogville to restrain
its indignation at any point.

1681
02:22:16,368 --> 02:22:19,537
Perhaps things had turned
out well after all?

1682
02:22:19,538 --> 02:22:22,957
"- Good morning, Mrs. Henson.
- Oh.. good morning?"

1683
02:22:22,958 --> 02:22:28,063
I would have come earlier. I overslept.

1684
02:22:28,131 --> 02:22:31,608
"Oh, never mind.
Liz put her back into it this morning."

1685
02:22:32,968 --> 02:22:35,987
We thought some time off
would be good for you.

1686
02:22:39,391 --> 02:22:41,743
That was quite a speech
you made yesterday.

1687
02:22:41,935 --> 02:22:44,495
It gave us all something to think about.

1688
02:22:48,566 --> 02:22:51,252
"- Hello, Liz!
- Hi, Grace.."

1689
02:22:58,367 --> 02:23:00,761
I overslept.

1690
02:23:01,579 --> 02:23:04,997
- Good morning Miss Grace?
- Good morning..

1691
02:23:04,998 --> 02:23:09,086
- How are you this morning?
- I overslept.

1692
02:23:09,087 --> 02:23:11,313
"Oh, that's all right."

1693
02:23:17,178 --> 02:23:20,864
"Tom. Tom, I think it's Grace."

1694
02:23:21,348 --> 02:23:26,953
"Hello, Grace. Two seconds..
Good news."

1695
02:23:35,444 --> 02:23:37,963
I went back to the meeting last night.

1696
02:23:39,698 --> 02:23:42,635
I wasn't going to let
them get off so easily.

1697
02:23:44,370 --> 02:23:47,306
But I'll be damned if the
mood hadn't changed.

1698
02:23:48,499 --> 02:23:50,559
"I wouldn't say we won
exactly, not exactly,"

1699
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:53,156
"but I think something very good
can come out of this,"

1700
02:23:53,170 --> 02:23:55,379
- something very good.
- Why didn't you come back and tell me?

1701
02:23:55,380 --> 02:23:58,567
"I did, but you were asleep."

1702
02:23:58,925 --> 02:24:01,486
"And you know,
you looked like you needed it.."

1703
02:24:02,637 --> 02:24:05,889
and that made me suggest
that maybe you should have some time off.

1704
02:24:05,890 --> 02:24:10,953
"And you know,
not one single person objected."

1705
02:24:15,067 --> 02:24:16,876
That sounds wonderful.

1706
02:24:16,901 --> 02:24:18,961
"I know it does, doesn't it?"

1707
02:24:19,570 --> 02:24:23,091
The people of this town
they surprise me again and again.

1708
02:24:24,366 --> 02:24:27,910
I might even have to revise
my theories a little bit.

1709
02:24:27,911 --> 02:24:30,514
You know how much I hate
doing that kind of thing.

1710
02:24:32,708 --> 02:24:36,930
"You know, Grace,
last night when I came back"

1711
02:24:36,931 --> 02:24:41,242
"and I saw you
lying there asleep so sweetly,"

1712
02:24:41,508 --> 02:24:47,030
I was suddenly inspired.
I wrote the first chapter of a story.

1713
02:24:47,056 --> 02:24:49,490
A story about a small town.

1714
02:24:49,975 --> 02:24:52,118
Guess where I got the inspiration?

1715
02:24:52,852 --> 02:24:55,955
But I haven't come up with a name
for the town yet.

1716
02:24:57,024 --> 02:24:59,019
Why not just call it Dogville?

1717
02:24:59,020 --> 02:25:00,177
Wouldn't work.

1718
02:25:00,818 --> 02:25:03,111
"No, it wouldn't work.
It's got to be universal."

1719
02:25:03,112 --> 02:25:05,266
"Lot of writers make
that mistake, you see."

1720
02:25:05,906 --> 02:25:08,175
"Hey, do you want me to read it to you?"

1721
02:25:08,659 --> 02:25:11,285
"If there is any love in
it, it comes from you..."

1722
02:25:11,286 --> 02:25:14,306
"Would you be offended, if I said no?"

1723
02:25:15,290 --> 02:25:16,395
"No."

1724
02:25:16,396 --> 02:25:19,779
"If I really do have
the day to myself, I..."

1725
02:25:20,004 --> 02:25:22,522
No. No...

1726
02:25:23,882 --> 02:25:28,319
Two people only hurt each other if they
doubt the love they have for one another.

1727
02:25:30,014 --> 02:25:32,115
You can read it some other time.

1728
02:25:33,558 --> 02:25:37,745
You sit down some place
and gaze out at the mountains.

1729
02:25:37,980 --> 02:25:40,164
It's what the girl in my novel does.

1730
02:25:43,442 --> 02:25:47,171
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you. Good news!

1731
02:25:52,534 --> 02:25:57,622
"Sensibly, Grace chose to hope
for the best rather than fear the worst,"

1732
02:25:57,623 --> 02:26:01,876
"and planned to spend the day calmly
washing her clothes and herself,"

1733
02:26:01,877 --> 02:26:04,868
"which, for some reason
or another, she was sure"

1734
02:26:04,869 --> 02:26:09,619
"none of the characters from Tom's
fictitious township would dream of doing."

1735
02:26:13,096 --> 02:26:17,241
And then it was
as if Dogville just waited.

1736
02:26:18,226 --> 02:26:23,622
"Even the wind dropped,
leaving the town in an unfamiliar calm."

1737
02:26:24,398 --> 02:26:28,627
"as if somebody had put a large
cheese dish cover over it,"

1738
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:34,341
and created the kind of quietness that
descends while you are awaiting visitors.

1739
02:26:36,493 --> 02:26:41,252
"After two days off
Grace had been put back to work,"

1740
02:26:41,253 --> 02:26:43,902
"but the quietness remained."

1741
02:26:44,042 --> 02:26:52,009
Indeed it intensified until on the fifth
day it swelled into a strange mood

1742
02:26:53,051 --> 02:26:57,280
"that, all of a sudden, brought all
the citizens to the street to listen."

1743
02:26:59,724 --> 02:27:03,494
"They asked each other
if the phone was really still down,"

1744
02:27:03,728 --> 02:27:07,292
or if they'd heard about Ben
having had to turn his truck around

1745
02:27:07,293 --> 02:27:08,690
on his way to Georgetown

1746
02:27:08,691 --> 02:27:13,253
that very morning on account
of a large tree blocking the road.

1747
02:27:13,487 --> 02:27:15,547
They were not worried.

1748
02:27:15,824 --> 02:27:22,137
"Worried was not the right word,
and then Tom spotted the cars."

1749
02:27:24,081 --> 02:27:26,248
Tom has binoculars.
But you can see 'em with the naked eyes.

1750
02:27:26,249 --> 02:27:27,834
There must be at least eight!

1751
02:27:27,835 --> 02:27:29,543
I thought the road was blocked.

1752
02:27:29,544 --> 02:27:31,939
They must have come through
before the tree came down.

1753
02:27:34,925 --> 02:27:38,695
June's bed! The sheets need changing.
I'll be there in a minute.

1754
02:27:39,596 --> 02:27:40,947
"Hello, June."

1755
02:27:43,182 --> 02:27:47,411
"Grace had just started on the bed,
which June had soiled yet again,"

1756
02:27:47,645 --> 02:27:52,374
when an irritating feeling of wasting
her time forced itself upon her.

1757
02:27:53,484 --> 02:27:56,920
And it was without thinking
she then said the words:

1758
02:27:56,946 --> 02:27:59,381
Nobody gonna sleep here.

1759
02:28:04,286 --> 02:28:06,912
"She didn't say them out loud,"

1760
02:28:06,913 --> 02:28:12,227
but even so she was startled by the
utterance that had urged itself upon her.

1761
02:28:13,879 --> 02:28:17,273
Where had these ominous words come from?

1762
02:28:26,474 --> 02:28:31,454
Darkness was falling as Grace made
her way home from work that evening.

1763
02:28:31,562 --> 02:28:34,309
The people on the square
overlooking the valley

1764
02:28:34,310 --> 02:28:37,192
had finally given up hope
of seeing anything else

1765
02:28:37,193 --> 02:28:39,277
now the light had faded.

1766
02:28:39,278 --> 02:28:42,841
They trudged up Elm
Street in disappointment.

1767
02:28:47,411 --> 02:28:49,036
"- Tom?
- Hi, Grace."

1768
02:28:49,037 --> 02:28:54,059
"There were some cars, but it's too dark,
we can't see any more."

1769
02:28:54,084 --> 02:28:56,978
We haven't seen much of each other.

1770
02:28:57,462 --> 02:29:00,506
"Yah, I know. I've been busy
with my book, you know."

1771
02:29:00,507 --> 02:29:02,400
Can I ask you something?

1772
02:29:03,176 --> 02:29:04,902
"Yeah, anything."

1773
02:29:08,347 --> 02:29:11,325
"You couldn't bring yourself
to throw it away, could you?"

1774
02:29:12,893 --> 02:29:16,455
The number he gave you that night.
You couldn't throw it away.

1775
02:29:16,647 --> 02:29:21,752
I told you how dangerous that man was.
That was stupid.

1776
02:29:27,950 --> 02:29:31,401
"Stupid or not, Tom was soon
a passionate spokesman"

1777
02:29:31,402 --> 02:29:34,357
"for locking Grace
in her shed that night."

1778
02:29:35,791 --> 02:29:40,627
If the vehicles were indeed a sign that
the call Tom had placed five days earlier

1779
02:29:40,628 --> 02:29:42,913
on be half of the
community to the number

1780
02:29:42,914 --> 02:29:45,451
indicated on the card
from his bureau drawer

1781
02:29:45,466 --> 02:29:47,467
"had at last led to action,"

1782
02:29:47,468 --> 02:29:50,721
"and Grace was now to be
eliminated from their lives,"

1783
02:29:50,722 --> 02:29:55,034
it would surely look good
if the town had also locked her up.

1784
02:29:57,103 --> 02:30:01,206
Grace was lying on the bed
when Jason was sent up with the key.

1785
02:30:01,315 --> 02:30:03,900
"Grace heard it turn in the lock,"

1786
02:30:03,901 --> 02:30:08,240
but she was deeply absorbed by
arguments and thoughts on matters

1787
02:30:08,241 --> 02:30:12,269
she had otherwise avoided
for the best part of a year now.

1788
02:30:30,927 --> 02:30:32,915
From the moment when
they'd finally heard

1789
02:30:32,916 --> 02:30:35,347
the sound of vehicles
starting one after the other

1790
02:30:35,348 --> 02:30:37,474
"from the direction of
the edge of the woods,"

1791
02:30:37,475 --> 02:30:40,077
things had moved rapidly.

1792
02:30:40,436 --> 02:30:44,415
Tom had arranged a delegation
to provide a proper reception.

1793
02:30:45,065 --> 02:30:50,587
"Dogville might be off the beaten track,
but it was hospitable, nevertheless."

1794
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:05,727
Welcome gentlemen. Welcome.

1795
02:31:05,752 --> 02:31:08,253
The town places itself at your disposal!

1796
02:31:08,254 --> 02:31:11,506
I should have a large key to give to you.
But I only have this small one.

1797
02:31:11,507 --> 02:31:13,800
- Where is she?
- Secured by this very key.

1798
02:31:13,801 --> 02:31:15,444
Where is she?

1799
02:31:15,762 --> 02:31:19,014
Okay. If you are wondering
about that sound.

1800
02:31:19,015 --> 02:31:22,475
The driving piles
for the new penitentiary.

1801
02:31:22,476 --> 02:31:25,867
"Tell me, has the crime rate
really gone up in this country,"

1802
02:31:25,868 --> 02:31:27,480
"as we are lead to believe?"

1803
02:31:27,481 --> 02:31:31,170
"Maybe people just
regard things as criminal,"

1804
02:31:31,171 --> 02:31:33,861
"because they envy their success?"

1805
02:31:33,862 --> 02:31:37,758
What's your opinion on the subject?

1806
02:31:38,283 --> 02:31:42,971
Maybe you have none.
I'll get the door... sorry.

1807
02:31:45,541 --> 02:31:48,726
Voila! As the French might say.

1808
02:31:48,835 --> 02:31:50,561
What the hell is this?

1809
02:31:50,879 --> 02:31:52,462
Who did that?

1810
02:31:52,463 --> 02:31:55,233
"Billy, put your hand up,
put your hand up."

1811
02:32:03,808 --> 02:32:06,102
"We felt safer,
when she had the chain on."

1812
02:32:06,103 --> 02:32:09,006
"You are probably more adapted
at handling her kind."

1813
02:32:11,065 --> 02:32:16,528
None of us feel able to accept money
for just helping people.

1814
02:32:16,529 --> 02:32:21,157
I mean not unless it would make you
feel better to divert yourself.

1815
02:32:21,158 --> 02:32:23,593
- Shut the hell up!
- Absolutely.

1816
02:32:28,081 --> 02:32:31,818
"Grace was no expert in
exclusive automobiles,"

1817
02:32:31,819 --> 02:32:34,836
"yet she recognized
with no difficulty..."

1818
02:32:34,837 --> 02:32:38,632
the sound of the vehicle that was
rounding the corner from Canyon Road

1819
02:32:38,633 --> 02:32:39,994
at that very moment.

1820
02:32:41,135 --> 02:32:44,747
"Alas, in Grace's memory
the legendary purr"

1821
02:32:44,748 --> 02:32:49,142
"of the Cadillac series 355C
was inextricably linked"

1822
02:32:49,143 --> 02:32:52,871
"with another,
rather less sophisticated sound:"

1823
02:32:52,980 --> 02:32:57,000
that of gunfire directed
against her person.

1824
02:33:20,882 --> 02:33:22,191
Don't...!

1825
02:33:46,491 --> 02:33:50,553
You need to justify your actions
before you shoot us.

1826
02:33:51,828 --> 02:33:53,930
That's new.

1827
02:33:57,876 --> 02:34:02,146
"That could be interpreted as weakness,
Daddy... I'm disappointed in you!"

1828
02:34:03,089 --> 02:34:04,382
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

1829
02:34:04,383 --> 02:34:06,651
You shot at me before.

1830
02:34:06,926 --> 02:34:13,032
"Yes, I'm sorry. I regret that."

1831
02:34:13,349 --> 02:34:15,200
You ran away.

1832
02:34:15,477 --> 02:34:19,872
But shooting at you certainly
didn't help matters.

1833
02:34:19,897 --> 02:34:23,166
"Of course not.
You're far, far too stubborn."

1834
02:34:25,736 --> 02:34:28,155
"If you don't want to kill me,
then why did you come?"

1835
02:34:28,156 --> 02:34:30,878
"Our last conversation, the
one in which you told me"

1836
02:34:30,879 --> 02:34:32,866
"what it was you
didn't like about me"

1837
02:34:32,867 --> 02:34:36,413
"never really concluded, as you ran away."

1838
02:34:36,414 --> 02:34:39,915
I should be allowed to tell you
what I don't like about you.

1839
02:34:39,916 --> 02:34:45,855
That I believe would be
a rule of polite conversation.

1840
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:48,149
That's why you showed up?

1841
02:34:50,926 --> 02:34:53,404
And you call me stubborn.

1842
02:34:53,554 --> 02:34:57,825
You're sure you're not here to force me
to go back and become like you?

1843
02:34:57,933 --> 02:35:01,489
"If I thought there was
a chance of forcing you,"

1844
02:35:01,489 --> 02:35:04,424
"but of course that
will never happen."

1845
02:35:04,731 --> 02:35:12,523
You are more than welcome to return home
and become my daughter again anytime

1846
02:35:13,031 --> 02:35:22,082
and I would even begin to share my power
and responsibility with you if you did.

1847
02:35:23,291 --> 02:35:26,102
Not that you care.

1848
02:35:26,127 --> 02:35:27,728
So what is it?

1849
02:35:28,087 --> 02:35:31,256
"What is it, the thing...
the thing that you don't like about me?"

1850
02:35:31,257 --> 02:35:33,758
It was a word you used that provoked me.

1851
02:35:33,759 --> 02:35:36,403
You called me arrogant.

1852
02:35:36,554 --> 02:35:40,515
"To plunder, as it were, a God given
right. I'd call that arrogant, daddy."

1853
02:35:40,516 --> 02:35:43,768
But that is exactly what
I don't like about you.

1854
02:35:43,769 --> 02:35:45,561
It is you that is arrogant.

1855
02:35:45,562 --> 02:35:47,914
That's what you came here to say?

1856
02:35:51,234 --> 02:35:54,963
"I'm not the one passing judgment, Daddy.
You are."

1857
02:35:55,947 --> 02:36:00,451
"You do not pass judgment,
because you sympathize with them."

1858
02:36:00,452 --> 02:36:07,393
"A deprived childhood and a homicide really
isn't necessarily a homicide, right?"

1859
02:36:07,834 --> 02:36:10,585
The only thing you can
blame is circumstances.

1860
02:36:10,586 --> 02:36:15,507
"Rapists and murderers may be the victims,
according to you."

1861
02:36:15,508 --> 02:36:18,802
"But I, I call them dogs,"

1862
02:36:18,803 --> 02:36:23,097
and if they're lapping up their own vomit
the only way to stop them is with the lash.

1863
02:36:23,098 --> 02:36:25,392
But dogs only obey their own nature.

1864
02:36:25,393 --> 02:36:28,036
So why shouldn't we forgive them?

1865
02:36:28,271 --> 02:36:31,331
"Dogs can be taught many useful things,"

1866
02:36:31,357 --> 02:36:36,711
but not if we forgive them
every time they obey their own nature.

1867
02:36:48,164 --> 02:36:53,418
So I'm arrogant. I'm arrogant
because I forgive them?

1868
02:36:53,419 --> 02:36:54,770
My God..

1869
02:36:54,921 --> 02:36:58,941
Can't you see how condescending
you are when you say that?

1870
02:36:59,301 --> 02:37:03,836
"You have this preconceived
notion that nobody,"

1871
02:37:03,837 --> 02:37:07,932
"listen, that nobody
can't possibly attain"

1872
02:37:07,933 --> 02:37:12,229
"the same high ethical standards as you,
so you exonerate them."

1873
02:37:12,230 --> 02:37:17,400
I can not think of anything
more arrogant than that.

1874
02:37:17,401 --> 02:37:23,697
"You, my child... my dear child
you forgive others with excuses"

1875
02:37:23,698 --> 02:37:26,450
that you would never in the world
permit for yourself.

1876
02:37:26,451 --> 02:37:29,204
Why shouldn't I be merciful?
Why?

1877
02:37:29,205 --> 02:37:34,642
"No no no.. You should be merciful,
when there is time to be merciful."

1878
02:37:34,667 --> 02:37:40,231
But you must maintain your own standard.
You owe them that. You owe them that.

1879
02:37:40,923 --> 02:37:44,401
"The penalty you deserve
for your transgressions,"

1880
02:37:44,402 --> 02:37:47,221
"they deserve
for their transgressions."

1881
02:37:47,222 --> 02:37:48,680
They are human beings.

1882
02:37:48,681 --> 02:37:53,185
No no no.. Does every human being
need to be accountable for their action?

1883
02:37:53,186 --> 02:37:56,062
Of course they do.
But you don't even give them that chance.

1884
02:37:56,063 --> 02:37:58,647
All that is extremely arrogant.

1885
02:37:58,648 --> 02:38:02,127
I love you. I love you.
I love you to death.

1886
02:38:02,402 --> 02:38:06,363
But you are the most arrogant person
I've ever met.

1887
02:38:06,364 --> 02:38:08,675
And you call me arrogant!

1888
02:38:12,662 --> 02:38:16,807
I have no more to say.

1889
02:38:19,544 --> 02:38:23,546
You are arrogant. I'm arrogant.
You've said it. Now you can leave.

1890
02:38:23,547 --> 02:38:26,442
"And without my daughter, I suppose?"

1891
02:38:32,306 --> 02:38:34,825
"- I said, without my daughter?
- Hmm, yes!"

1892
02:38:36,144 --> 02:38:38,894
- Well..
- Yes.

1893
02:38:38,895 --> 02:38:42,945
"Well, you decide.
You decide..."

1894
02:38:42,946 --> 02:38:49,225
"Grace, they say you are
having some trouble here."

1895
02:38:49,823 --> 02:38:54,594
No. No more trouble than back home.

1896
02:38:54,744 --> 02:38:57,246
I'll give you a little
time to think about this.

1897
02:38:57,247 --> 02:38:59,602
Perhaps you will
change your mind.

1898
02:38:59,603 --> 02:39:00,484
I won't.

1899
02:39:00,666 --> 02:39:05,171
"Listen, my love.. power is not so bad..."

1900
02:39:05,172 --> 02:39:11,944
I am sure that you can find a way
to make use of it in your own fashion...

1901
02:39:14,888 --> 02:39:16,990
Take a walk and think about it.

1902
02:39:17,683 --> 02:39:29,110
The people who live here are doing their
best under very hard circumstances.

1903
02:39:29,111 --> 02:39:31,254
"If you say so, Grace."

1904
02:39:32,989 --> 02:39:40,221
But is their best really good enough?

1905
02:39:41,998 --> 02:39:43,307
Do they love you?

1906
02:39:53,467 --> 02:39:56,844
Grace had already thought for a long time.

1907
02:39:56,845 --> 02:40:00,890
She had known that if she were not shot
when the gangsters arrived

1908
02:40:00,891 --> 02:40:04,477
"she would be faced with her father's
suggestion that she return, to become"

1909
02:40:04,478 --> 02:40:07,692
a conspirator with him and
his gang of thugs and felons

1910
02:40:07,693 --> 02:40:09,398
and she did not need any walk

1911
02:40:09,399 --> 02:40:12,169
"to reconsider her response to that,"

1912
02:40:13,070 --> 02:40:16,511
even though the difference between
the people she knew back home

1913
02:40:16,512 --> 02:40:19,117
and the people she'd met
in Dogville had proven

1914
02:40:19,118 --> 02:40:22,386
somewhat slighter than she'd expected.

1915
02:40:23,496 --> 02:40:28,541
Grace looked at the gooseberry bushes
so fragile in the smooth darkness.

1916
02:40:28,542 --> 02:40:32,021
"It was good to know
that if you did not treat them ill,"

1917
02:40:32,047 --> 02:40:37,508
"they would be there, come spring as always,
and come summer they'd again be bursting"

1918
02:40:37,509 --> 02:40:43,264
"with the quite incomprehensible quantity
of berries that were so good in pies,"

1919
02:40:43,265 --> 02:40:45,450
specially with cinnamon.

1920
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:50,396
Grace looked around at the
frightened faces behind the windowpanes

1921
02:40:50,397 --> 02:40:52,768
"that were following her every step,"

1922
02:40:52,769 --> 02:40:56,471
"and felt ashamed
of being part of inflicting that fear."

1923
02:40:58,113 --> 02:41:02,967
How could she ever hate them for
what was at bottom merely their weakness?

1924
02:41:03,242 --> 02:41:07,013
She would probably have done things
like those that had befallen her

1925
02:41:07,039 --> 02:41:09,623
"if she'd lived in one of these houses,"

1926
02:41:09,624 --> 02:41:13,602
to measure them by her own yardstick
as her father put it.

1927
02:41:13,836 --> 02:41:18,788
"Would she not,
in all honesty, have done the same"

1928
02:41:18,789 --> 02:41:23,830
"as Chuck and Vera
and Ben and Mrs. Henson and Tom"

1929
02:41:24,097 --> 02:41:27,157
and all these people in their houses?

1930
02:41:30,519 --> 02:41:33,080
Grace paused.

1931
02:41:33,355 --> 02:41:38,334
"And while she did, the clouds scattered
and let the moonlight through"

1932
02:41:45,783 --> 02:41:50,137
and Dogville underwent another
of little changes of light.

1933
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:06,929
"It was as if the light,
previously so merciful and faint,"

1934
02:42:06,930 --> 02:42:11,366
finally refused to cover up
for the town any longer.

1935
02:42:12,350 --> 02:42:14,785
"Suddenly you could
no longer imagine a berry"

1936
02:42:14,786 --> 02:42:17,354
"that would appear one day
on a gooseberry bush,"

1937
02:42:17,355 --> 02:42:20,834
but only see the thorn
that was there right now.

1938
02:42:21,609 --> 02:42:27,093
The light now penetrated every
unevenness and flaw in the buildings...

1939
02:42:27,094 --> 02:42:29,019
and in... the people!

1940
02:42:32,161 --> 02:42:37,224
And all of a sudden she knew the answer
to her question all too well:

1941
02:42:38,209 --> 02:42:44,422
"If she had acted like them, she could not
have defensed a single one of her actions"

1942
02:42:44,423 --> 02:42:47,526
and could not have condemned them
harshly enough.

1943
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:54,282
It was as if her sorrow and pain finally
assumed their rightful place.

1944
02:42:54,433 --> 02:42:59,537
"No, what they had done was
not good enough."

1945
02:42:59,854 --> 02:43:04,399
"And if one had the power to put it to
rights, it was one's duty to do so,"

1946
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:08,964
"for the sake of the other towns,
for the sake of humanity,"

1947
02:43:09,822 --> 02:43:15,971
"and not least, for the sake of the
human being that was Grace herself."

1948
02:43:24,336 --> 02:43:30,734
"If I went back and became
your daughter again,"

1949
02:43:31,134 --> 02:43:33,987
when would I be given the power
you're talking about?

1950
02:43:38,391 --> 02:43:41,036
- Now?
- At once!

1951
02:43:41,227 --> 02:43:42,370
Why not?

1952
02:43:48,401 --> 02:43:54,423
So that would mean that I'd also take on
the immediate responsibilities at once.

1953
02:43:55,158 --> 02:43:57,843
I'd be a part in the problem solving...

1954
02:43:59,245 --> 02:44:02,848
like the problem.. of Dogville.

1955
02:44:08,629 --> 02:44:13,692
We can start by shooting a dog
and nailing it to a wall.

1956
02:44:13,717 --> 02:44:17,308
"Over there beneath
that lamp, for example."

1957
02:44:17,309 --> 02:44:20,750
"Well, it might help.
It sometimes does."

1958
02:44:20,932 --> 02:44:24,349
"It would only make the
town more frightened,"

1959
02:44:24,350 --> 02:44:27,131
"but hardly
make it a better place."

1960
02:44:29,232 --> 02:44:31,000
And it could happen again.

1961
02:44:31,777 --> 02:44:42,088
"Somebody happening by,
revealing their frailty."

1962
02:44:48,083 --> 02:44:51,478
"That's what I wanna use the power for,
if you don't mind."

1963
02:44:55,090 --> 02:44:59,319
I wanna make this world a little better.

1964
02:45:03,682 --> 02:45:07,410
"That damn kid won't shut up.
Says he wants to talk to you, Miss."

1965
02:45:07,644 --> 02:45:09,621
Can we just shoot him now?

1966
02:45:11,189 --> 02:45:13,124
Let me talk to him.

1967
02:45:17,612 --> 02:45:19,755
What? What is it?

1968
02:45:22,116 --> 02:45:26,512
"A man can't really be blamed
for being scared now, can he?"

1969
02:45:26,746 --> 02:45:28,806
- No. That's true.
- No!

1970
02:45:29,290 --> 02:45:31,266
"I'm scared, Grace."

1971
02:45:31,417 --> 02:45:34,377
I used you. And I'm sorry.

1972
02:45:34,378 --> 02:45:38,982
"I am stupid, I am.
Maybe even arrogant sometimes."

1973
02:45:41,134 --> 02:45:42,694
"You are, Tom."

1974
02:45:45,138 --> 02:45:49,600
"Although using people is not very
charming, I think you have to agree"

1975
02:45:49,601 --> 02:45:54,479
that this specific illustration
has surpassed all expectations.

1976
02:45:54,480 --> 02:45:56,666
It says so much about being human.

1977
02:45:56,899 --> 02:46:00,350
"It's been painful, but I think you also
have to agree it has been edifying."

1978
02:46:00,351 --> 02:46:01,597
"Wouldn't you say?"

1979
02:46:01,612 --> 02:46:05,591
"Not now, Tom.
Not now."

1980
02:46:09,788 --> 02:46:14,016
"If there is any town in this world
would be better without, this is it."

1981
02:46:20,339 --> 02:46:22,524
Shoot them and burn down the town.

1982
02:46:27,012 --> 02:46:30,115
"What?
Something else, honey?"

1983
02:46:30,974 --> 02:46:33,451
There is a family with kids...

1984
02:46:36,187 --> 02:46:39,373
do the kids first and
make the mother watch.

1985
02:46:39,692 --> 02:46:43,754
Tell her you will stop if she can
hold back her tears.

1986
02:46:47,658 --> 02:46:49,842
I owe her that.

1987
02:46:56,248 --> 02:46:59,518
I'm afraid she cries a little too easily.

1988
02:47:01,754 --> 02:47:04,564
We'd better get you out of here.

1989
02:47:05,841 --> 02:47:09,027
"I'm afraid, you've learned
far too much already."

1990
02:47:15,308 --> 02:47:19,120
"Are you cold, Sweetie.
Do you need a wrap?"

1991
02:47:19,812 --> 02:47:21,122
I'm fine.

1992
02:47:24,275 --> 02:47:27,713
You want the curtains opened?
You don't need them anymore.

1993
02:47:28,070 --> 02:47:29,755
What do you think?

1994
02:47:35,704 --> 02:47:41,767
I think we should open them.
I think it's appropriate.

1995
02:49:38,946 --> 02:49:40,548
"Bingo, Grace!"

1996
02:49:43,117 --> 02:49:44,134
Bingo!

1997
02:49:46,453 --> 02:49:50,349
"I have to tell you, your illustration
beat the hell out of mine."

1998
02:49:52,626 --> 02:49:57,480
"It's frightening, yes, but so clear."

1999
02:49:58,757 --> 02:50:04,529
Do you think that I can allow myself
to use it as an inspiration in my writing?

2000
02:50:13,729 --> 02:50:15,289
Goodbye Tom.

2001
02:50:42,090 --> 02:50:47,070
- Somethings you have to do yourself.
- Really

2002
02:50:50,516 --> 02:50:53,618
That one you're gonna have to explain
to me on the way home.

2003
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:57,079
Suddenly there was a noise.

2004
02:50:57,104 --> 02:51:02,084
"Not so persuasive and powerful as
it had been on a rainy night in spring,"

2005
02:51:02,109 --> 02:51:06,323
but loud enough to work its way
through the final sighs of the timber

2006
02:51:06,324 --> 02:51:08,225
that was rapidly burning out.

2007
02:51:09,241 --> 02:51:12,594
It came again.
Everyone heard it.

2008
02:51:12,619 --> 02:51:14,745
Grace was the first to recognize it.

2009
02:51:14,746 --> 02:51:16,223
"That's Moses,"

2010
02:51:16,457 --> 02:51:19,643
"That's Moses, she said,
and jumped out of the car."

2011
02:51:20,335 --> 02:51:23,731
"She quickly covered the distance
to the dog pen over what,"

2012
02:51:23,732 --> 02:51:27,425
"now the buildings were gone,
could scarcely be called a street,"

2013
02:51:27,426 --> 02:51:30,523
"and certainly not Elm Street
as there wasn't a tree left"

2014
02:51:30,524 --> 02:51:32,638
"on Dogville's little mountain ledge,"

2015
02:51:32,639 --> 02:51:34,407
let alone an elm.

2016
02:51:34,641 --> 02:51:36,558
It was Moses.

2017
02:51:36,559 --> 02:51:40,079
His survival was astonishing.
A miracle.

2018
02:51:41,230 --> 02:51:44,583
"No, just let him be."

2019
02:51:45,151 --> 02:51:48,379
They will have spotted the flames
in Georgetown by now.

2020
02:51:49,154 --> 02:51:51,507
Some one'll come and find him.

2021
02:51:56,412 --> 02:52:00,015
He's just angry
because I once took his bone.

2022
02:52:10,550 --> 02:52:13,739
"Whether Grace left Dogville
or on the contrary,"

2023
02:52:13,740 --> 02:52:17,014
Dogville had left her
(and the world in general)"

2024
02:52:17,015 --> 02:52:22,412
is a question of a more artful nature
that few would benefit from by asking

2025
02:52:22,437 --> 02:52:25,356
and even fewer by providing an answer.

2026
02:52:25,357 --> 02:52:28,751
And nor indeed will it be answered here!
