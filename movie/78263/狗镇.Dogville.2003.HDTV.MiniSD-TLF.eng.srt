1
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:44,152
Dogville was in the Rocky Mountains
in the US of A.

2
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:51,076
Up here where the road came to its
definiteve end near the entrance to the old,
abandoned silver mine.

3
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:57,207
The residents of Dogville were good,
honest folks and they liked their township.

4
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:02,587
And while a sentimental soul from the East Coast
had once dubbed their main street ELM STREET,

5
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:05,715
though no elm tree had ever
cast its shadow in Dogville,

6
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:09,219
they saw no reason to change anything.

7
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:15,225
Most of the buildings were pretty wretched;
more like shacks; frankly.

8
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:18,645
The house in which Tome lived
was the best, though,

9
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:23,525
and in good times might almost
have passed for presentable.

10
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:27,863
That afternoon the radio was playing softly,

11
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:36,121
for in his dotage Thomas Edison Senior
had developed a weakness for music of the lighter kind.

12
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:41,751
[Radio Presenter] Ladies and Gentlemen...
the President of the United States...

13
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,214
Tom, do me a favor, will you?
The radio!?

14
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:50,844
Just because the music's over and
you might risk hearing something useful?

15
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,431
I thought that's why we have the radio...

16
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:57,225
Well, I need a rest, as you know.

17
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,270
Mock me if you like.

18
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:05,775
[Narrator] Tom's father had been a doctor
and now received a modest pension,

19
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:11,615
so it was no great disaster for Tom
to drift about not doing anything in particular.

20
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:16,411
Tom was a writer.
...at any rate by his own lights.

21
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:23,126
Oh, his output as committed to paper
was so far limited to the words "great" and "small",

22
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:25,253
followed by question mark,

23
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:31,301
but nevertheless meticulously archived
in one of his many bureau drawers.

24
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:33,512
'Bye, Dad.

25
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,268
Evenin' Master Tom.

26
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,354
Good evening, Master Olivia.

27
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,189
Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow.

28
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,440
Noooo

29
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:56,326
[Narrator] In order to postpone the time
at which he would have to put pen to pater in earnest,

30
00:02:56,368 --> 00:03:01,331
Tom had now come up with
a series of meetings on moral rearmament

31
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,835
with which he felt obliged to benefit the town.

32
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,920
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Tom.

33
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:09,089
Good evening Chuck.

34
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:12,050
Will we see you at the meeting tomorrow?

35
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,553
Well, I could do without your lectures.

36
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,179
You know Vera.

37
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:19,683
Wouldn't give me moment's peace
till I said yes.

38
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,397
Who gave Moses that bone?
It's still got meat on it.

39
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:27,315
Jason did.

40
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,985
Jason gave that mutt a bone
with meat on it?

41
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:33,238
When did we last see meat?

42
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:36,867
Next time you waste good food,
I'll take your knife away.

43
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,827
I would know it was you give'n meat to eat.

44
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,913
Moses was meant to be hungry! To keep watch.

45
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:44,082
Keep watch in Dogville?

46
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:46,626
What's there to steal?

47
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:49,212
These are wicked time, Tom Edison.

48
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:53,008
Soon there'll be folks by
with even less than us.

49
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:04,561
[Narrator] Indeed..Tom was busy enough,
even though, formally speaking,

50
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:07,898
not yet busy with writing per se.

51
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:12,527
And if a body found it hard to grasp
what profession he was busy at,

52
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,572
he'd merely reply "mining".

53
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,658
For although he did not blast
his way through rock,

54
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,328
he blasted through what was even harder...

55
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:26,750
namely, the human soul...
right into where it glistered!

56
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:29,336
- Hey, Martha.
- Hello, Tom.

57
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,172
Listen, they're all comin',
so you just have those benches ready.

58
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:33,840
Yes, they're ready.

59
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,469
Oh, but Tom, I repeat,
if you need to use my organ

60
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,430
I got to get special permission
from the regional director, Tom.

61
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,558
Martha, and I repeat,
we don't need the organ.

62
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,062
We can be spiritual without singing
or reading from the Bible.

63
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:50,440
It's almost seven.
Don't forget your bell now.

64
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:54,319
I imagine that'll do Ma Ginger.

65
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,948
I don't think it's good for the soil
with all the raking and hoeing.

66
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:01,701
It's the soil that gave life to us all.

67
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,664
Don't give me any of your lip,
Thomas Edison Jr.

68
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,333
I'll hoe as I darn well please!

69
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:12,838
Yeah, and spoil the whole thing!
I agree with Tom.

70
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:15,257
Yeah, well he likes eating my pies,
don't you?

71
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,093
Well they're tasty.
No doubt about it.

72
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:21,179
Yeah. So when it comes to hoeing,
who's right, Tom, you or me?

73
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:23,348
I'm not so sure it's that simple.

74
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,225
He's got you there Ginger.

75
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:28,353
You can not resist,
can you, Gloria?

76
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,772
Hey, Ben, I'll get the doors!

77
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:31,982
I'll be fine, Tom.

78
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,484
Any news from the freight industry?

79
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,570
Is everything going to hell there too?

80
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:39,698
Don't poke fun at the freight industry.

81
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:48,790
[Narrator] It was seven o'clock precisely,
as Martha chimed the hour,

82
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:53,920
and Tom was due to play checkers
with his childhood friend Bill Henson.

83
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:56,756
Bill was dumb and knew it.

84
00:05:57,382 --> 00:06:02,846
Far too dumb to qualify as an engineer,
he was certainly sure of that.

85
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:11,313
After listening for a while to the piledriver
down the valley that Ben insisted was working
on the foundation of a new penitentiary,

86
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:15,275
Tom headed for the Henson home
in order to inflict upon Bill

87
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:19,070
yet another humiliating defeat at checkers.

88
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:27,245
Some folks might say the opportunity
to meet Bill's older sister, Liz, was more of a draw
than the checkerboard,

89
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,623
and they might be right.

90
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:34,794
It was a fact that in the Henson home
lay another horizon.

91
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,508
A horizon just as alluring
as the one beyond the valley.

92
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:44,471
A horizon bound by Liz Henson's
luscious curves.

93
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:49,392
- No one's getting it?
- A sweet, painful, seductive abyss.

94
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,186
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Tom.

95
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:55,315
Must you come by every single day?
Huh!?

96
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:58,527
It'd be a lot more fun if someone
interesting appeared for a change.

97
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:02,322
You know I really am so lonesome in this town.

98
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:07,536
The moment my fiancee writes
that he's gotten that job in Bolder, I'm off.

99
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:10,789
Then the whole lot of you will
have to find some other girls' skirts to peek up.

100
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,916
Is.. uh.. Bill in?

101
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,627
Well, isn't he always?

102
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,672
He studies and I help out with the glasses.

103
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:21,675
Even though everybody knows
that I'm the clever one.

104
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,886
- Hey, Mrs. Henson.
- Good evening, Tom.

105
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:28,181
Checkers time, Bill ol' Buddy.

106
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,226
Was that..??

107
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:33,812
You didn't hear the bell?

108
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:39,693
[Narrator] As usual Bill tried to fake
his way around actually playing.

109
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:44,698
He had not yet fully comprehend
this meeting business, he claimed.

110
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,534
Maybe you should just let them be?

111
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,202
I don't think so... I... I...

112
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,746
What if they're just fine as they are?

113
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:54,541
You think they're fine?
I don't think so.

114
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,710
I think there is a lot
this country has forgotten.

115
00:07:56,793 --> 00:08:00,714
I just try and refresh folk's memory
by way of illustration.

116
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:02,841
So... so the illustration for tomorrow?

117
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:05,302
mmmh.. I don't know.

118
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:10,724
See if the people of Dogville have
a problem with the acceptance.

119
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:14,394
What they really need is something
for them to accept,

120
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:18,356
something tangible,
like a gift.

121
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:22,819
Why in the heck would someone
up and give us a gift?

122
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,279
I don't know.

123
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,448
I might have to do some thinking.

124
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:33,830
Wait, wait, .. the ...
we're missing a piece.

125
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:36,374
We won't be able to play.

126
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,137
My mind is sharp tonight.

127
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:01,066
'Night, Bill.

128
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:20,085
[Narrator] Despite considerable effort
on his part to prolong things,

129
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,964
Tom had achieved the triumph
at the checkerboard pretty quickly.

130
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:28,176
It had started to rain and
the wind had become a regular gale

131
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:31,304
when Tom strolled home through Elm Street.

132
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:38,436
If Tom were to prove that the citizens of Dogville
had a problem receiving in his lecture in the next day

133
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:42,941
he sorely lacked an illustration,
a gift.

134
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,193
Bill might have been right.

135
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:49,906
It hadn't exactly rained gifts
on this particular township.

136
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:30,488
There was no doubt in his mind.

137
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,782
They were gun shots.

138
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:36,912
The pile driver in the marshes
didn't sound like that at all.

139
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:39,206
The shots had come from down in the valley,

140
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:43,418
or perhaps from Canyon Road some place
in the direction of Georgetown.

141
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:51,760
He listened for more shots for ages.
But they were not repeated.

142
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:59,351
A tad disappointed, Tom sat down
on the old lady's bench to think,

143
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,063
to hang onto the feeling of danger
for a moment.

144
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:09,069
But it wasn't long before his thoughts
were back on his favorite subjects again,

145
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:15,242
and in the midst of the storm they metamorphosed
into articles and novels and great gatherings

146
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:23,708
that'd listen in silence to Tom after the publication
of yet another volume that scourged and purged the human soul.

147
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:28,088
And he saw men,
and among them even other writers,

148
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:34,928
throw their arms round one another as,
through his words, life had opened up for them anew.

149
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:37,472
It hadn't been easy.

150
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:44,563
But by his diligence and application
to narrative and drama his message had gotten through,

151
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:50,110
and asked about his technique he would
have to say but one word:

152
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,154
"illustration".

153
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:15,969
Tom could have spent another
half hour or more on the bench,

154
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:19,806
but another unusual noise roused him.

155
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:22,475
It was Moses barking.

156
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:27,647
Oh, that wasn't unusual in itself,
but it was the way he barked that was new.

157
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:31,276
His barking was not loud,
but more of a snarl,

158
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,699
as if the danger was quite close at hand
and not merely a passing raccoon or fox.

159
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:44,998
as if the dog were standing face to face
with a force to be taken seriously.

160
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:51,296
Hey, Lady!
I wouldn't go up there if I were you.

161
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:58,428
I know the mountain well,
I doubt if I'd get away with my life.

162
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,430
It's a very nasty drop.

163
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,605
Is there another way?

164
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:10,440
Yeah.

165
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:15,612
Where?

166
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:20,784
Back down the way you came from.
Back down to Georgetown.

167
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,870
Why do you need to get out of the mountain?

168
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:27,207
Did you have anything to do
with those gunshots?

169
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,549
Help me, help me please.

170
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,134
You can hide in the mine,
in there!

171
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,854
Hey, where's this road headed to?

172
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:51,064
No where. It's a dead end.

173
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:55,485
If you want to pass, turn around,
go back by way of Georgetown.

174
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:58,405
This place... uh..
it's called Dogville.

175
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:01,950
Dogville? Well it figures,
it's a stupid name if I ever heard one.

176
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:05,036
Hey, we're looking for somebody...

177
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,038
Oh, really, who might that be?

178
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:11,585
My boss wants to talk to ya.

179
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:13,962
- Young man.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:20,260
I'm looking for a girl. She may have made
her way to your town in her confusion.

181
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,307
I don't want any harm to come to her.
You see, she's very precious to me.

182
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:28,768
Well sir, uh..
nobody's been through Dogville recently.

183
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,689
Moses would have barked.
He's very suspicious of strangers.

184
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:36,943
Ah ha.. That's very wise Moses.

185
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:44,117
Please take my card and if perhaps..
uh.. you see a stranger,

186
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:45,911
give me a call.

187
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:50,207
I am in a position to offer
a considerable reward.

188
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,210
Yes sir. Thank you.

189
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:57,130
uh.. say was it you that fired those shots?

190
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:16,900
Well they're gone.
You want to come out now?

191
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:29,996
You want a cup of coffee
before you go mountain-climbing?

192
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,335
That would be nice.

193
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:41,758
[Narrator] The beautiful fugitive's name was Grace.

194
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:47,097
She hadn't chosen Dogville from a map
or sought out the township for a visit,

195
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:51,351
yet Tom felt right away that she belonged.

196
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:54,104
Shall I take the bone?

197
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,113
[Narrator] She could have kept
her vulnerability to herself,

198
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:07,450
but she had elected to give herself up
to him at random.

199
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:12,956
As.. yes.. a gift.

200
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:17,210
"Generous, very generous",
thought Tom.

201
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:23,842
You want to eat?
You must be hungry?

202
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:25,343
I can't.

203
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:29,097
I don't deserve that bread!

204
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:34,978
I stole that bone.
I haven't stolen anything before.

205
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:39,858
So now, now I have to punish myself.

206
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:47,199
I was raised to be arrogant,
so I had to teach myself these things.

207
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:54,331
Well, it may be best for your education...

208
00:16:55,332 --> 00:17:00,670
Grace, in this town in these times...

209
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:05,592
it is very impolite not to eat
what's set before you.

210
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:09,804
I'm so sorry.

211
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:24,903
Who were the men in the car?
Why would they want to hurt you?

212
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:32,327
The man in the back of the car,
he's the boss. I saw his face.

213
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,041
He gave me his telephone number,
told me to call if I saw you.

214
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:42,879
I'm sure he'd offered you a big reward
if you told him where I was.

215
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,256
Yeah.

216
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:50,387
Where's your family?

217
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:52,264
I don't have a family.

218
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,975
All I had was a father...

219
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:01,398
but those gangsters took him away from me.

220
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:04,985
What if I said you could stay here?

221
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,444
Here?

222
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,906
But even if you meant it, it's impossible.

223
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:17,539
It's very small town, I have to hide.
People will ask questions.

224
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:22,252
Well, it might not matter.
Not if they all wanted to help you too.

225
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:26,423
Are you saying that everybody
in this town is like you?

226
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:31,178
They're good people.
You know, they're honest people.

227
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:33,722
They've all been in need themselves.

228
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:36,516
They might well turn you down, but...

229
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,187
I think it would be worth the trouble to ask.

230
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:43,440
But I got nothing to offer them in return.

231
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:47,360
No, I think you have plenty to offer Dogville.

232
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:59,998
[Narrator] To call the mood of the audience
at Tom's morale lecture in the mission house the next day,

233
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,295
"enthusiastic" would have been going to far,
but they had come.

234
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:11,051
And Tom had launched himself fearlessly
into his endeavor to illustrate the human problem:

235
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:13,136
To receive.

236
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:23,146
The subject was obvious, but quite
dreadfully ill-considered by this young man.

237
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:27,984
To compensate for his lack of preparation
Tom made diligent use of his technique

238
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:32,280
of lashing out somewhat haphazardly
in all directions.

239
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:36,910
His father peered around covertly
to gauge the mood,

240
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:42,040
and sensing that the assembly was not
entirely happy with this rather direct criticism,

241
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:45,126
he decided to forestall any protest.

242
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:48,213
Now I'm sure that you wish us well, Tom,

243
00:19:48,505 --> 00:19:53,927
but um.. of any town, I believe this one has
a very fine sense of community.

244
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:56,805
Living side by side we all know one another.

245
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:58,807
I'm a pretty fair judge of character myself.

246
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:01,560
Honestly, Tom, you've done it again.

247
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,104
Made us come here to listen
to a lot of nonsense.

248
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,357
What do you think you are,
some kind of philosopher?

249
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:09,234
Observant, that's what I am.

250
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:13,196
Lazy, I would say.
We shovel snow together.

251
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:14,990
We shovel snow together?

252
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:15,824
Yeah.

253
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:18,785
Every household clears their own front walk.

254
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:23,665
Yeah, I gotta allow that Tom's right on that.
If roads don't get
cleared properly...

255
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,212
I'm sorry Tom, you're going to have to
come up with something better than that.

256
00:20:29,254 --> 00:20:34,885
But the whole country would be better served
with a greater attitude of openness and accenpance.

257
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:38,346
You're suggesting that we all
wouldn't help out if someone needed help.

258
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:40,056
No, that's not the point.
That's not the point.

259
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:41,391
We care for human beings up here.

260
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:44,644
We would probably never find out.

261
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:53,320
Since nobody seems to want to admit
that there's a problem,

262
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,907
let me illustrate.

263
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,370
Now I'm not going to use something
that's already happened.

264
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:07,292
I'm going to use something
that's just about to happen.

265
00:21:10,754 --> 00:21:17,010
[Narrator] And, after providing a quick summary
of the events of the previous evening
to the astonished people of Dogville,

266
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:23,099
Tom went down to the mine to retrieve
the fugitive from her hideaway.

267
00:21:30,774 --> 00:21:37,030
Allow me to introduce Grace.
Grace, these are the citizens of Dogville.

268
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:39,574
- Hello.
- Hello.

269
00:21:43,078 --> 00:21:45,747
Tom has told us about your predicament, Miss.

270
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:48,583
I really don't want to put any of you
in jeopardy.

271
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,377
Why don't you just go to the police?

272
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:54,130
They can take care of gangsters!
It's their job.

273
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,094
I, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
The transportation
business would uh...

274
00:21:59,135 --> 00:21:59,678
Ben!

275
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:08,645
These men, they have powerful connections,
even with the police.

276
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:11,690
Do you think we should give
sanctuary to a fugitive?

277
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:16,862
A fugitive that gangsters wanna get a hold of.
That would put us in pretty pickle.

278
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,655
Easy, Claire...
think of your asthma.

279
00:22:18,655 --> 00:22:21,449
Dogville is a good place to hide,
that's for certain.

280
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:24,494
Exactly.
The only way up here is Canyon Road.

281
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:31,668
That could easily be watched by Ma Ginger's
-excuse me-nosey cousin who lives
only yards from the turn off.

282
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:34,796
She has a telephone.
Martha, you could ring the bell,

283
00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:37,299
tell the town if people were coming.

284
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:43,555
But Tom, I chime the hours,
what if people get confused with all the ringing?

285
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:47,934
Come now, Martha.
Surely we can use our old bell to save a life, if need be.

286
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:50,353
Why should we?

287
00:22:50,812 --> 00:22:53,940
Because we care, Chuck.
We care for other human beings.

288
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:55,525
No, that ain't what I mean.

289
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,987
How do we know that this woman is
telling us the truth?

290
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,909
Maybe these gangsters did shoot at her,
but that don't make her somebody to be trusted.

291
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:09,289
He is right.
Why would you trust me?

292
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,458
I trust you!

293
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,461
Tom, we're not gangsters.

294
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:19,841
We mind our own business
we don't ask nothin' from nobody.

295
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,636
So at last you admit it!

296
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:27,974
If only there were some way,
we wouldn't doubt the young lady's word.

297
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,476
some way to know her..

298
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:31,853
Then I think we would all ignore the risk.

299
00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:35,857
But there is a way!
You said it yourself.

300
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:38,777
By living side by side with her.

301
00:23:39,402 --> 00:23:41,988
Dad, you are such a fine judge of character.

302
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,492
How long would it take a good man
like you to unmask her?

303
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:49,329
A week? Maybe two?

304
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:51,998
Surely we can offer her two weeks.

305
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,920
And if after that time so much as
one man cries out 'BE GONE!'

306
00:23:56,962 --> 00:24:00,841
I promise I'll happily send her
packing herself.

307
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,978
Well, if Master Tom thinks this is right
for us, and for the
community,

308
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:19,609
then that will do for me.
He might be young, but his heart is right.

309
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,363
And I've known his heart
for as long las it's been beating.

310
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:36,793
[Narrator] No more words were spoken
at the town meeting in the mission house.

311
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:42,966
But it had been decided, they all felt,
that the fugitive would be given two weeks.

312
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:46,386
And they would all be able to look
at themselves in the mirror and know

313
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:53,059
that they had done what they could, indeed,
and perhaps more than most people would have done.

314
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:03,987
So that very afternoon Tom took Grace on a stroll
down Elm Street to introduce her to the town "he loved".

315
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,825
Well, this is where Olivia and June live.

316
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:14,748
June is a cripple...
They live here as a token of my dad's broadmindedness.

317
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:18,793
Chuck and Vera have seven children
and they hate each other.

318
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:27,469
Next door we have the Hensons.
They make a living from grinding edges off
cheap glasses to try to make them look expensive.

319
00:25:27,511 --> 00:25:32,891
And here we have Jack McKay.
Now, Jack McKay is blind and the whole town knows it.

320
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:37,687
But he thinks he can hide it
by never leaving his house.

321
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:40,190
In the old stable Ben keeps his truck.

322
00:25:40,232 --> 00:25:47,072
He drinks and he visits the whorehouse
once a month and he is ashamed of it.

323
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:53,954
Martha she runs the mission house
until the new preacher comes which will just never happen.

324
00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:01,461
That leaves Ma Ginger and Gloria.
They run this really expensive store,

325
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:05,715
where they exploit the fact
that nobody leaves town.

326
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:10,554
Used to leave to go vote,
but since they put on the registration fee,

327
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:17,519
about a day's wage for these people,
they don't feel the democratic need any more.

328
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:25,485
Those awful figurines say more about
the people in this town, than many words.

329
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:30,031
If this is the town that you love,
then you really have a strange way of showing it.

330
00:26:31,575 --> 00:26:41,209
All I see, is a beautiful little town
in the midst of magnificent mountains.

331
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:50,552
A place where people have hopes
and dreams even under the hardest conditions.

332
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:56,975
And seven figurines that are not awful at all.

333
00:26:58,977 --> 00:27:02,731
[Narrator] Calling Dogville beautiful was
original at least.

334
00:27:03,231 --> 00:27:10,822
Grace was just casting one more look
at the figurines she herself would have dismissed
as tasteless a few days earlier,

335
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:19,998
when she suddenly sensed
what would best have been described
as a tiny change of light over Dogville.

336
00:27:41,186 --> 00:27:44,272
They are keeping an eye on you.

337
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:49,402
If you love them already,
they might need a little persuading.

338
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:54,241
You've got two weeks
to get them to accept you.

339
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:57,536
You make it sound like
we are playing a game.

340
00:27:58,286 --> 00:28:06,211
It is. We are. Isn't saving your life
worth a little game?

341
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:08,171
What do you want me to do?

342
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:10,298
Do you mind physical labour?

343
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:12,509
No!

344
00:28:13,593 --> 00:28:16,763
Dogville has offered you two weeks.

345
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:20,392
now you offer them...

346
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:39,035
[Narrator] The next day was
a beautiful day in Dogville.

347
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:43,248
The tender leaves on Ma Ginger's
goosberry bushes were unfurling

348
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:48,086
despite wise Tom's misgivings
as regards her gardening methods.

349
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:57,095
But more than that, this first day of spring
had also benn picked to be Grace's first ever day of work.

350
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:04,477
The day in which she was to set off around
Dogville and ofeer herself one hour per household per day.

351
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:05,729
Excuse me.

352
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:13,945
I would like to offer you my help..
if there is anything that you need?

353
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:19,993
Yeah.. A carburetor that don't leak..

354
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,123
alright here, let me take that.

355
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:27,751
Maybe I could help around your home?

356
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:35,592
I don't really have a home.
Just the garage.

357
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:40,847
I'm in the freight business.
The road is my home!

358
00:29:40,889 --> 00:29:42,933
I'm ready. Good morning!

359
00:29:42,974 --> 00:29:44,935
Miss Olivia has got a home.

360
00:29:45,644 --> 00:29:49,397
She is looking to help out
in somebody's home.

361
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,942
A cleanin' lady for a cleanin' lady?

362
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:55,820
You be talkin' nonsense, Mister Ben!

363
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,197
Have a good day!

364
00:29:57,239 --> 00:30:00,575
Alright. See ya later on!

365
00:30:01,243 --> 00:30:05,372
[Narrator] And off Ben went to Georgetown
with the weekly shipment of glasses

366
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:12,128
that Mr. Henson had so laboriously cleansed
with his polisher of any trace of their cheap manufacture.

367
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:22,556
So Grace turned into the alley
which went by the exotic name, Glunen Street

368
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:28,728
to knock on the door of the blind,
but only too vain, man.

369
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:31,565
Yes?

370
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:36,236
Good morning, Mr. McKay.
My name is Grace.

371
00:30:36,444 --> 00:30:40,782
I was wondering if there is anything
I can do for you?

372
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:44,244
Oh, that's very kind of you, Grace,
but...

373
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:48,957
I was thinking that perhaps because of
the situation that you are in...

374
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,002
What situation am I in?

375
00:30:53,253 --> 00:31:00,093
Hmm... You are.. on your own.

376
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:07,100
Oh, I have been on my own for so long.

377
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:10,061
Anything that you might need?

378
00:31:11,605 --> 00:31:13,356
I'm sorry!

379
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:19,613
Have you ever noticed the wooden spire
on the roof of the mission house?

380
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:26,995
At 5 o'clock in the afternoon, it points
a shadow at Ginger's grocery store,

381
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:34,503
right at the O in OPEN
on the sign in the window.

382
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:39,299
Maybe it is telling people that it is time
to go shopping for supper.

383
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:43,011
Goodbye, Mr. McKay.

384
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:45,972
Bye, Grace!

385
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:52,103
[Narrator] Grace's interview with Jack McKay
proved sadly
symptomatic of the attitude in Dogville.

386
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:57,734
Reserved but friendly,
not without curiosity.

387
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:04,115
Only Jack had expressed his "no"
consicely and precisely:

388
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:09,663
Martha needed a monologue almost
an hour long to arrive at the same conclusion.

389
00:32:09,704 --> 00:32:13,333
Oh my goodness... I, I, I'd have to think of
work for you to do,

390
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:15,836
because I have barely enough work myself.

391
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:21,341
[Narrator] So not very much later Grace had
ended up next to Ma Ginger's gooseberry bushes

392
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:25,136
in a mood that was not particularly good.

393
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:29,683
She could not tell a gooseberry bush
from a cactus,

394
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:33,436
but the meticulous order in the yard
appealed to her,

395
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:38,024
such as the metal chains placed there
in order to shield the second and third bushes,

396
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:44,614
lest anybody decided to make use of
the deplorably time-honored shortcut to the old lady's bency.

397
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:50,370
Grace pulled herself together and
headed towards the store.

398
00:32:53,498 --> 00:32:54,541
Hello!

399
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:01,214
Hello. We don't need any help here either.
I told that to Tom.

400
00:33:01,214 --> 00:33:05,719
Wow, it doesn't matter anyway,
because there is nothing I can do.

401
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:08,388
I have never worked a day in my life, so.

402
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,230
You know, if you put some aloe on
those hands of yours they'll be better by morning.

403
00:33:17,314 --> 00:33:20,901
It's the wood shavings.
I really do hate them.

404
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:24,738
But I do believe I'll take your advice.

405
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:28,241
Your hands are surely the most
alabaster hands I've ever seen.

406
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:31,578
Here comes Tom, how lucky we are.

407
00:33:32,454 --> 00:33:37,792
Hi, all. Grace.. how is all going?

408
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:40,253
- Not very well, I'm afraid.
- Really?

409
00:33:40,253 --> 00:33:42,380
No. Nobody needs any help.

410
00:33:42,547 --> 00:33:44,883
Well, I thought that might be the case.

411
00:33:45,008 --> 00:33:50,263
His plan to make everybody like me
has run into a few problems

412
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:52,682
because nobody wants me to work for them.

413
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:55,769
I would really like to offer something in return.

414
00:33:56,978 --> 00:34:00,023
You're all running a terrible risk
having me here.

415
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:03,276
I mean, I am willing to learn.

416
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,989
There must be someone who needs help.
Mr. McKay's sight is not good.

417
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:12,577
Yes, I went to Mr. McKay.
I went to Martha and to Chuck and Vera's,

418
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,205
and nobody seems to need any help.

419
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,291
They all think everyone else needs
something, and not themselves.

420
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:22,379
Funny, that's exactly what Tom said.
I supposed he's pleased.

421
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:29,553
Just to prove him wrong,
maybe you can lend a hand here.

422
00:34:30,303 --> 00:34:33,557
But Ginger, there really isn't anything
we need done.

423
00:34:33,598 --> 00:34:35,892
Perhaps there's something
you don't need done?

424
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:38,144
Anything we don't need done?

425
00:34:38,186 --> 00:34:44,109
Something.. something that you would like
done, but that you don't think is necessay.

426
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:46,236
What on earth would that be?

427
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:48,613
Maybe... maybe the gooseberry bushes.

428
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:51,158
The gooseberries are just fine,
thank you very much.

429
00:34:51,324 --> 00:34:55,453
No. Not yours. The ones that planted
themselves in the tall grass.

430
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:57,622
We don't grow anything there.

431
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:01,376
Exactly. A bit of tiding up.

432
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,755
Who knows, those bushes might
one day bear fruit.

433
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,884
Yeah. That's true! Who knows..

434
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,635
All right, girl.

435
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:18,768
Those alabaster hands of yours are
hereby engaged to weed the wild gooseberry bushes.

436
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,188
Thank you!

437
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:25,525
Around.. like this, you see.

438
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:29,696
Anything to close them...
just be careful, that's all.

439
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:35,577
[Narrator] After a few of the wild little
gooseberry bushes had given up the ghost

440
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:40,123
in the care of Grace's as yet
unpracticed alabaster hands,

441
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:44,961
things began looking up
with the weeding and the town.

442
00:35:46,963 --> 00:35:54,679
In fact it turned out there were not so few things
that the other townsfold of Dogville didn't need doing either.

443
00:35:55,597 --> 00:36:02,145
As Ben had no home, Grace's domestic
experiments were absolutely things he didn't need,

444
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:09,486
but he put up with them anyhow,
appearing with astonishing punctuality
when the act of domesticity had been completed,

445
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:14,741
no matter how unpredictable business
hours in the freight industry might otherwise have been.

446
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:23,250
Olivia didn't need anyone to help June
to the toilet while she was at work,

447
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:29,297
as hitherto they had coped splendidly
with Olivia's excellent diaper arrangement.

448
00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:38,223
If Jack McKay had needed a partner
for conversation he would surely have gone out
and gotten one for himself in the town.

449
00:36:38,515 --> 00:36:43,562
So it was not out of need that he allowed
Grace to sit with him in his dark parlor

450
00:36:43,603 --> 00:36:52,154
with the dramatic drapes on one wall
for lengthy discussions regarding
the underestimated qualities of the light on the East Coast.

451
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:59,744
As Martha wouldn't dream of burdening
the parish with wear and tear of the pedals and bellows,

452
00:36:59,786 --> 00:37:05,792
while waiting for the new priest to be appointed,
she practiced without a note ever leaving the organ,

453
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:10,338
and was therefore not really
in need of anyone to turn her pages.

454
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:17,554
And God knows that Mr. and Mrs. Henson's son
did not need any help with his books,

455
00:37:18,096 --> 00:37:22,267
and that the family had taken Grace
for her own sake.

456
00:37:27,063 --> 00:37:31,568
And although Liz's hands had improved
through Grace's good counsel,

457
00:37:31,693 --> 00:37:37,199
Thomas Edison was a doctor and
of indisputable health and he did not need care,

458
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:41,495
or help with the pills from the medicine
closet with its many secrets.

459
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:50,295
Actually Chuck was the only one
"not yet hooked", as Tom put it.

460
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:56,676
Hooked? You sound so arrogant!
Arrogance is the worst thing!

461
00:37:56,968 --> 00:37:58,803
He doesn't like me.

462
00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:02,599
And he has every right to feel that way.

463
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:08,772
Yeah. Listen!
Luckily I have prepared a Trojan horse.

464
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:10,273
A what?

465
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,151
Trojan horse.
We can get in by way of Vera.

466
00:38:13,276 --> 00:38:21,993
There is this.. lecture tomorrow
in Georgetown, given by some professor.

467
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:26,289
Some intellectual thing.

468
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:31,336
But not so intellectual he can't tour
the provinces with it, anyway, the point is,

469
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:37,050
Vera she would do anything to go,
but she's got no one to mind Achilles while she is gone.

470
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:43,014
She trusts the girls mastering their iambs
and pentameters, but not with the little one.

471
00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:48,395
So this is where you come in.
I said that you could watch him tomorrow afternoon.

472
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:55,443
Now, I will try and stall her on her way home
and with a bit of luck, Chuck'll get back before she does

473
00:38:55,485 --> 00:39:00,198
and you can use the time and
all your charm to try and win him over.

474
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,827
I'll happily mind Achilles if Vera will let me.

475
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,330
But if he doesn't like me he doesn't like me.

476
00:39:08,331 --> 00:39:13,461
[Narrator] Tom really was enchanted by this
unusual, mysterious creature.

477
00:39:13,753 --> 00:39:19,217
And even though she did not satisfy
his curiosity by saying
anything about her past

478
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:28,810
so as not to put anyone in danger,
she still fitted Tom's mission to educate Dogville
on the subject of acceptance like a glove.

479
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:31,521
Tom felt content.

480
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:37,235
Grace had been dangling over the edge,
and he had been the one to pull her back onto the path.

481
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:43,533
It gave him a fine sensation of mastery,
new for him in terms of the opposite sex,

482
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,455
and his feelings unleashed the best
in his burgeoning love.

483
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:10,810
Hello. This is Dahlia, Olympia, Diana,
Athena, Pandora, Jason, Achilles.

484
00:40:15,357 --> 00:40:16,900
Your children are lovely.

485
00:40:17,025 --> 00:40:24,115
They are good kids. And I love them.

486
00:40:29,538 --> 00:40:34,668
Please don't say any such nice things
about the kids. I cry too easily.

487
00:40:36,586 --> 00:40:39,339
Both in sorrow and in joy.

488
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,259
- Hey, Vera.
- Oh, hi!

489
00:40:42,634 --> 00:40:44,761
- Shall we go?
- I'm ready.

490
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:47,430
Thanks for leaving the map out.

491
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:51,643
I'd a plum forgot it, I'm sure.
How did you know I was going that far?

492
00:40:51,977 --> 00:40:56,648
The last time I saw the thermos,
it was on the doorstep and the map was beside it,

493
00:40:56,648 --> 00:41:01,987
so I just thought, when I saw the thermos
this time and no map, but...

494
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,616
You are a sweet girl, Grace.

495
00:41:07,242 --> 00:41:09,035
Sweet as Miss Laura.

496
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:10,662
Who's Miss Laura?

497
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:13,165
You gave yourself again, Ben.

498
00:41:13,206 --> 00:41:17,878
I think Miss Laura is
what Ovid might call a Maenad.

499
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:24,885
Oh, don't be ashamed, Ben.

500
00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:28,638
We all have the right to make the most of our lives.

501
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:34,352
I'm sure that those ladies in those houses
they bring a lot of joy to a lot of men.

502
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:41,443
Ain't nothing I'm proud of.
It really ain't.

503
00:41:59,294 --> 00:42:01,421
I know what you are doing here.

504
00:42:03,173 --> 00:42:04,424
You do?

505
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:10,222
You want people to like you,
so you don't have to go away.

506
00:42:11,848 --> 00:42:13,600
You are very smart.

507
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:18,772
Yes, I like it here in Dogville.

508
00:42:18,813 --> 00:42:24,444
Do you want me to read to you?
About the Cyclops?

509
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:27,739
I don't like the Cyclops.

510
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:34,830
Two eyes are pretties, like yours.

511
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:45,590
If you want my Ma to like you, and let you stay.
You'll just have to be nice to me.

512
00:42:48,468 --> 00:42:50,846
Maybe you should help me clean up instead.

513
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:56,142
Ma says I don't have to work,
'cept in my head.

514
00:42:56,309 --> 00:43:00,313
Oh, but what about if I ask you, please?

515
00:43:00,522 --> 00:43:01,481
Ok.

516
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:17,164
What are you doing here?

517
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:19,791
Didn't I tell you we don't need
no help from you?

518
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,793
Ma asked her to mind me and Achilles.

519
00:43:21,793 --> 00:43:25,005
Quiet! Get out! The lot of you.

520
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:29,593
The same nonsense!

521
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,180
They'd have done just great in Antiquity,
no doubt.

522
00:43:34,306 --> 00:43:37,976
How is it going otherwise,
with the fooling act?

523
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:43,690
I wasn't trying to fool anyone?

524
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,528
I mean Dogville.
Has it got you fooled yet?

525
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:55,744
I thought you were implying
that I was trying to exploit the town.

526
00:43:56,286 --> 00:43:58,330
Wishful thinking.

527
00:44:00,332 --> 00:44:04,252
This town is rotten from the inside out,

528
00:44:04,794 --> 00:44:07,672
and I wouldn't miss it,
if it fell into the gorge tomorrow.

529
00:44:08,131 --> 00:44:15,722
I see no charm here, but you seem to.

530
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:19,351
Admit it you've fallen for Dogville.

531
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:24,648
The trees, the mountains,
the simple folk.

532
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:28,568
And if all that ain't got you fooled yet,
I bet the cinnamon has.

533
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:32,656
That damned cinnamon
in those gooseberry pies.

534
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:37,160
Dogville has everything that you ever
dreamed of in the big city.

535
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:42,541
You are worse than Tom.
How do you know what I dreamed of?

536
00:44:47,212 --> 00:44:50,006
You're from the city yourself, aren't you?

537
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:51,967
That was a long time ago.

538
00:44:52,217 --> 00:44:55,846
I am not that stupid anymore,
I found out that people are the same all over.

539
00:44:55,846 --> 00:44:57,430
Greedy as animals.

540
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,142
In a small town they're just a bit
less successful.

541
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:04,020
Feed 'em enough they'll eat
till their bellies burst.

542
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,273
That's why you wanted to get rid of me...

543
00:45:06,982 --> 00:45:11,778
because you can't stand that I remind
you of what it was you came here to find.

544
00:45:19,828 --> 00:45:21,955
I'm telling you for the last time
to get out of my home.

545
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,249
Moses don't like you.
And I don't like you.

546
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:27,377
The kids are going crazy enough
from their ma's teachin'.

547
00:45:27,419 --> 00:45:29,087
Thank you, Grace!

548
00:45:47,439 --> 00:45:52,486
[Narrator] The two seeks had passed far too quickly.
Grace had enjoyed herself.

549
00:45:53,069 --> 00:45:56,531
All she could say was that
she was fond of them all,

550
00:45:56,615 --> 00:46:01,203
including the folk who had greeted her
with reluctance and hostility.

551
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:07,667
Even though she might not have won everybody
over completely or even half way, as Tom put it,

552
00:46:08,418 --> 00:46:14,591
She cared for Dogville and she had shown
the town her face, her true face.

553
00:46:14,883 --> 00:46:17,052
But was that enough?

554
00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:23,934
During Jack McKay's long lecture that evening
she had found herself in a heart-searching mood.

555
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:28,438
Whether heart-searching or
concern for her future was the cause,

556
00:46:28,522 --> 00:46:37,030
the result was that the otherwise so lovable
Grace indulged in a pretty shady piece of provocation.

557
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:46,081
So you agree that the windows of St. Bridget's,
at the first time you saw them,
didn't live up to their reputation.

558
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:52,546
I don't think it is the position of the church itself.

559
00:46:52,671 --> 00:47:03,515
Maybe it's the light in Los Angeles and
the mosaic glass in those windows they kind of collide,

560
00:47:05,517 --> 00:47:07,769
I remember thinking that.

561
00:47:09,563 --> 00:47:14,234
I think we've talked long enough about
the way we remembering seeing things.

562
00:47:14,442 --> 00:47:15,652
Don't you?

563
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:23,285
Why don't we talk about something
that we can see right now?

564
00:47:23,994 --> 00:47:29,583
There is not much to see around here.
Wretched town.

565
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:33,044
Why don't we talk about the view?

566
00:47:37,424 --> 00:47:45,849
I don't go out much.
The sun and my skin.

567
00:47:45,849 --> 00:47:49,144
Yesterday I was walking in Chuck's apple trees.

568
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:57,986
If you go right up to the edge of the cliff
you just manage to peer round Ben's garage

569
00:47:57,986 --> 00:48:01,656
and you get a view of your house
from the side facing the gorge.

570
00:48:02,365 --> 00:48:08,121
I didn't realize that there was windows behind there.

571
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:15,545
Huge windows.
There must be a wonderful view.

572
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,549
Would you mind if I opened them?

573
00:49:01,091 --> 00:49:07,472
You're no fool, Miss Grace.
You're no fool.

574
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,186
You probably see that those curtains
are hard to open.

575
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,354
Sorry!

576
00:49:17,232 --> 00:49:23,822
And obviously concluded that it's because
they're not used very often.

577
00:49:26,074 --> 00:49:32,622
But the view's good, entrancing even.

578
00:49:36,459 --> 00:49:48,263
So, ask me, why a man who loves the light
hang these heavy curtains?

579
00:49:55,478 --> 00:49:59,900
Yes, I'm blind.

580
00:50:00,358 --> 00:50:07,491
Not weak sighted, not myopic: blind.

581
00:50:09,784 --> 00:50:21,213
So please go
and let me be that on my own.

582
00:50:27,886 --> 00:50:37,103
Is Switzerland they call it the Alpengulen.

583
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:43,485
That's the light that reflects
from the highest peaks

584
00:50:43,902 --> 00:50:48,990
after the sun goes down behind the mountains.

585
00:50:51,243 --> 00:50:53,078
But now it's gone.

586
00:51:17,352 --> 00:51:22,524
[Narrator] It was in complete silence
that the people of Dogville turned up for the meeting
at the mission house

587
00:51:22,566 --> 00:51:26,695
two weeks to the day since the beautiful
fugitive had come to town.

588
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:33,118
Grace was standing beside Tom,
watching them convene,

589
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:40,417
and knew inside herself that this might well be
the last time she would see these now so familiar faces.

590
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:46,131
She had at least two of them against her,
and even one would have been too many.

591
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,177
Welcome good people of Dogville.

592
00:51:50,218 --> 00:51:57,851
Two weeks.... two weeks have passed
and it is time for your verdict.

593
00:51:58,226 --> 00:52:02,189
Is it right that she should be here while we talk?

594
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:06,526
Well, Mrs. Henson, when Grace first came
she made no attempt to hide her weakness from us.

595
00:52:06,568 --> 00:52:14,743
So I think it is only right we be as open
with her, tell her to her face if we want her to leave.

596
00:52:15,285 --> 00:52:17,412
No, Mrs. Henson is right.

597
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:22,959
Nobody should be prevented from
speaking their mind out of politeness.

598
00:52:24,044 --> 00:52:25,921
I'll wait at the mine.

599
00:52:26,546 --> 00:52:33,512
And if the vote says that I should leave,
then I'll take the path across the mountains, while it's still light.

600
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:38,475
And the things I've borrowed, if you could,
return them to everybody.

601
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,601
Of course!

602
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:42,145
Nobody has to see me before I go.

603
00:52:42,604 --> 00:52:46,149
Martha, if you will just ring the bell
then I'll understand.

604
00:52:46,483 --> 00:52:49,486
I don't ... how do...
am I gonna ring the bell?

605
00:52:49,986 --> 00:52:53,824
Just ring it for every vote that lets me stay.

606
00:52:54,157 --> 00:53:00,914
I will count. And if it doesn't reach
fifteen, then I'll leave.

607
00:53:09,756 --> 00:53:15,595
Tom is anxious to speak in her behalf,
but I think he's had his allotted time.

608
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:21,101
We know his view. We respect it.
And now he must respect ours.

609
00:53:22,143 --> 00:53:26,940
[Narrator] Grace pulled her bundle out from
under the bureau to change into her own clothes,

610
00:53:26,982 --> 00:53:31,695
only to discover that somebody had been
in it and left a loaf of bread.

611
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:36,491
Next to it was a folded sheet of paper.

612
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:39,452
It was a map Tom had drawn.

613
00:53:39,452 --> 00:53:43,123
He had known where the bundle was
and had put it there.

614
00:53:43,165 --> 00:53:45,542
It showed the path across the mountain.

615
00:53:45,584 --> 00:53:50,964
And all the dangerous spots were
furnished with witty horrific little sketches.

616
00:53:52,674 --> 00:53:54,467
But there was more.

617
00:53:54,551 --> 00:54:01,057
Several people had the same idea.
They had eased gifts into the bundle for her.

618
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:05,979
Jason's beloved little penknife lay there,
all polished and shiny.

619
00:54:06,062 --> 00:54:12,194
And a pie from Ma Ginger and Gloria.
And some clothing and matches, and a hymnal.

620
00:54:12,569 --> 00:54:17,991
Grace opened it at number 18, where Martha
always had trouble with fingering.

621
00:54:19,409 --> 00:54:26,124
And between the pages lay a dollar bill
Martha alone could not have afforded it.

622
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:31,505
Grace had friends in Dogville.
That was for sure.

623
00:54:31,546 --> 00:54:35,342
Whether they were few or many did not matter a jot.

624
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:40,889
Grace had bared her throat to the town
and it had responded with a great gift:

625
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:43,266
with friends.

626
00:54:48,563 --> 00:54:54,569
No gangster could deprive her of this
meeting with the township,
no matter how many guns in the world.

627
00:54:55,070 --> 00:55:00,951
And should the strokes of the bell did not reach 15,
she knew now that she meant something to the town

628
00:55:01,034 --> 00:55:04,204
and that her stay had been of significance.

629
00:55:04,246 --> 00:55:09,584
Not much, perhaps, but nevertheless,
a trace she had left.

630
00:55:10,502 --> 00:55:14,422
And the first in her young life
in which she took pride.

631
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,149
Grace stiffened as the bell began its toll.

632
00:56:16,485 --> 00:56:19,863
Fourteen. Grace counted.

633
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:28,246
So McKay must have voted for her after all,
and if so, why not Chuck, too?

634
00:57:10,288 --> 00:57:11,748
Everyone?

635
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:14,960
- Chuck!
- Chuck!

636
00:57:15,293 --> 00:57:16,837
Everyone.

637
00:57:18,171 --> 00:57:20,841
I think they like you here.

638
00:57:39,526 --> 00:57:44,406
[Narrator] The period of spring and early summer
proved a happy one for Grace.

639
00:57:44,948 --> 00:57:48,201
Martha rang the hours,
conducting her through the day.

640
00:57:48,243 --> 00:57:53,206
So she could serve as eyes for McKay,
a mother for Ben,

641
00:57:54,207 --> 00:57:59,379
friend for Vera,
and brains for Bill...

642
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:15,479
And one day it had occurred to Grace
to tread the pedals herself so to get Martha to agree

643
00:58:15,479 --> 00:58:18,857
to play a couple of paper notes,
just to empty the bellows naturally

644
00:58:18,899 --> 00:58:23,028
so that they wouldn't be left under pressure
and thus be spoiled.

645
00:58:23,778 --> 00:58:29,326
And now they had tacitly agreed that
as long as it was Grace who trode the pedals,

646
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:32,537
Martha could play without feeling any guilt.

647
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:42,172
To Tom's pop, the old doctor, who imagined
he had a new ailment every single day

648
00:58:42,172 --> 00:58:47,469
and was thus increasingly addicted to
the simpler coordination tests
from his medical school days,

649
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:52,307
she had to be severe, telling him that
there was nothing wrong with him.

650
00:58:55,143 --> 00:58:59,981
And now, since the town had agreed that
everyone was to give according to his abilities

651
00:59:00,023 --> 00:59:06,154
she received wages, not much, but enough
to save up for the first of the tiny china figurines

652
00:59:06,154 --> 00:59:11,576
from the row of seven that had stood
for so long gathering dust in the window of the store.

653
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:17,666
And she dreamed that in time she would
be able to acquire them all.

654
00:59:20,627 --> 00:59:28,593
Slowly those alabaster hands turned
into a pair of hands that could have belonged to
anyone in any little rural community.

655
00:59:29,803 --> 00:59:36,351
And three weeks later she triumphantly
moved into a place Tom and Ben had secretly restored,

656
00:59:36,393 --> 00:59:41,439
namely the old mill, which had once held
the town's ore crusher,

657
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:45,735
but of which only the heavy
flywheel now remained.

658
00:59:52,951 --> 00:59:53,743
Thanks.

659
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:56,830
That's what I am talking about
with the freight industry.

660
00:59:57,622 --> 01:00:00,959
Miss Laura had thrown that out,
it was no use to anybody.

661
01:00:02,252 --> 01:00:06,631
A good thing, in the wrong place.
But with my truck... You know.

662
01:00:06,756 --> 01:00:09,342
You shouldn't poke fun at
the freight industry, that's all.

663
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:13,722
No, you're right, Ben.
They shouldn't.

664
01:00:20,187 --> 01:00:21,229
Grace!

665
01:00:23,315 --> 01:00:24,149
What?

666
01:00:24,941 --> 01:00:29,738
I just had to tell you that I had a really
selfish reason for voting to keep you in Dogville.

667
01:00:34,284 --> 01:00:35,452
What was it?

668
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:42,709
It was such a relief when you turned up
and you were the one all the men had eyes for.

669
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:48,882
You know, Tom and them.
I've had to put up with it for so long..

670
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:53,094
Frankly, I just didn't have
the energy for it anymore.

671
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,847
They'll always have eyes for you, Liz.

672
01:00:57,349 --> 01:01:03,772
You know that.. They will.
You are beautiful.

673
01:01:03,855 --> 01:01:04,731
Thank you.

674
01:01:06,399 --> 01:01:10,570
[Narrator] The very latest development,
now that summer was at its peak,

675
01:01:10,695 --> 01:01:14,407
was that Grace had been given leave
to help Chuck in the orchard.

676
01:01:15,158 --> 01:01:22,082
And every day at 5, once their work was done,
she could appreciate that actually McKay was right;

677
01:01:22,123 --> 01:01:27,754
the shadow of the spire did indeed
point at Ma Ginger's store.

678
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:36,680
But today the tower did not only announce
that it was time to go shopping but also,

679
01:01:36,721 --> 01:01:43,395
by a signal which nobody despite Martha's
initial concern could have confused with the ringing of the hours,

680
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:48,859
a warning that somebody was approaching
via Canyon Road from Georgetown.

681
01:01:49,025 --> 01:01:54,823
For the first time in living memory
law enforcers had come to Dogville!

682
01:02:03,915 --> 01:02:05,250
Evenin' sir.

683
01:02:07,669 --> 01:02:09,921
Is this the whole place?

684
01:02:11,089 --> 01:02:13,675
- There's a town hall?
- No.

685
01:02:13,925 --> 01:02:15,802
I got me a notice to paste up.

686
01:02:15,927 --> 01:02:18,889
We got the mission house.
That do you?

687
01:02:19,347 --> 01:02:20,515
Sure.

688
01:02:21,558 --> 01:02:22,767
What'd she do?

689
01:02:23,351 --> 01:02:28,482
Missing! That's all it says.
I guess somebody's been missing her.

690
01:02:28,648 --> 01:02:31,234
Heard tell she was last seen around here.

691
01:02:32,068 --> 01:02:34,404
We've putting these things
all over the county.

692
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:37,574
And if somebody sees her,
they ought to go to the police?

693
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:40,243
I guess that's the idea.

694
01:03:12,275 --> 01:03:14,820
These men were never gonna give in easily.

695
01:03:15,779 --> 01:03:20,242
Now these posters they hang
all over in the county.

696
01:03:21,868 --> 01:03:24,746
which means nobody suspects
she's right here with us.

697
01:03:24,788 --> 01:03:28,708
But it was a policeman, Tom.
Isn't it a duty to respond to the police?

698
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:37,050
I mean, legally speaking.
I'm sorry, I just.. when I get upset.

699
01:03:37,676 --> 01:03:41,471
She's just a missing person.
She hasn't done anything. He even said so.

700
01:03:41,513 --> 01:03:43,139
I think you should vote again.

701
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:48,728
Why? We can't resort to plebiscites
time and time again.

702
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:56,611
Come on. Who's really got cold feet
because of her picture on a piece of paper?

703
01:04:19,593 --> 01:04:28,977
[Narrator] The 4th of July came with the huge
clouds of seeds from some remote meadow
gracefully floating down Elm Street in the early evening.

704
01:04:29,186 --> 01:04:34,941
Today was a day for celebration.
Nobody was to worry about the hard times.

705
01:04:35,066 --> 01:04:38,653
And Grace could stop at Ma Ginger's
window quite content:

706
01:04:39,029 --> 01:04:44,701
to ascertain that only two of the little china
figurines remained, and were thus the only two

707
01:04:44,701 --> 01:04:48,371
she had not yet been able to
save up enough to purchase.

708
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,669
- It looks great, girls..
- Uh-huh..

709
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,426
Grace, could you put in a couple of hours
with me in the orchard again today?

710
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:04,554
It's really nice down there with the sunshine!

711
01:05:04,721 --> 01:05:10,310
Chuck, it's the fourth of July!
What are you talking about sunshine for?

712
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,481
Have you turned into a romantic like me?

713
01:05:18,527 --> 01:05:20,070
We're gonna have fun.

714
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:23,365
And in the winter we'll all starve...

715
01:05:24,074 --> 01:05:26,952
Even Ben's taking the day off.

716
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,580
- Hi!
- Hi, Tom!

717
01:05:30,831 --> 01:05:32,707
Grace, you've got a moment?

718
01:05:35,043 --> 01:05:36,044
Now?

719
01:05:37,212 --> 01:05:40,757
Yeah. I've got something
interesting to tell you.

720
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:44,636
Well, it has to be quick.

721
01:05:52,352 --> 01:05:54,604
I've got so much going on in my head...

722
01:05:56,022 --> 01:05:58,692
That must be very tiring for you!

723
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:03,196
I think I've done a pretty good analysis
of the folks in this town

724
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:12,539
and I think I understand them
in a meaningful way.

725
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:20,463
But when I come to decipher you,
I get absolutely nowhere.

726
01:06:20,755 --> 01:06:25,427
You know Liz...
Liz is easy to read.

727
01:06:28,388 --> 01:06:31,224
And there was some attraction between us,

728
01:06:34,144 --> 01:06:36,646
but as I can see right through her,

729
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,692
intellectually I mean, I can see right through her,

730
01:06:40,942 --> 01:06:48,575
my desire is purely of a physical nature.

731
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:58,960
But with you, it's more...
it's more complicated.

732
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,879
What are you trying to say?

733
01:07:04,216 --> 01:07:06,843
No, I should get it clear in my head first.

734
01:07:09,346 --> 01:07:11,932
Are you trying to say that ...

735
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:16,311
you're in love with me?

736
01:07:18,188 --> 01:07:29,699
No, I wouldn't.. love is...
It's not... It's a big word...

737
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:30,450
Yeah.

738
01:07:34,996 --> 01:07:36,248
Yeah.

739
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:39,709
That's good!

740
01:07:43,672 --> 01:07:44,965
because ...

741
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:52,347
I think that I am in love with you, too.

742
01:07:53,974 --> 01:07:56,017
Very interesting, isn't it?

743
01:07:57,894 --> 01:08:01,982
I mean it's interesting in a psychological...

744
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:12,701
Did they call you?
I think they are calling you.

745
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:17,706
I didn't hear them.

746
01:08:21,168 --> 01:08:22,335
No.

747
01:08:25,505 --> 01:08:29,634
You should probably get back anyway.

748
01:08:32,554 --> 01:08:35,974
I will see you at the wedding.
Next celebration..

749
01:09:11,009 --> 01:09:14,971
This year I didn't bring any notes with me.

750
01:09:15,347 --> 01:09:18,433
Because I'm not gonna pretend
I can read them.

751
01:09:20,268 --> 01:09:24,147
Which brings me to a point.
A point I wanna make.

752
01:09:25,106 --> 01:09:28,985
And that point is you, Grace.

753
01:09:29,945 --> 01:09:36,660
Yes. You have made Dogville
a wonderful place to live in.

754
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:43,917
As a matter of fact, somebody tells me
they ran into grumpy old Chuck down the street

755
01:09:44,209 --> 01:09:46,378
and he was actually smiling.

756
01:09:48,296 --> 01:09:55,178
Well, I've never seen your smile, Grace,
but I will bet you I could describe it.

757
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:05,480
Because it obviously has every color
that's reflected from the shiniest prism in the world.

758
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:10,318
You probably have a face to match that.
Does she have a face to match that, Tom?

759
01:10:10,402 --> 01:10:12,571
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm..?
- Yes, sir.

760
01:10:12,654 --> 01:10:17,242
I bet she does.
We are proud to have you among us.

761
01:10:18,493 --> 01:10:24,708
And we thank you for
showing us who you are.

762
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:27,252
Here to you, Grace.

763
01:10:28,086 --> 01:10:30,714
Stay with us as long as you damn please.

764
01:10:54,446 --> 01:10:58,867
A police car has just been seen in town and
it has just made the turn up Canyon Road!

765
01:10:59,534 --> 01:11:00,702
So he will be here any minute.

766
01:11:01,036 --> 01:11:02,454
Shall I ring the bell?

767
01:11:03,413 --> 01:11:06,333
No, Martha.
Grace probably heard.

768
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:09,211
We'll get rid of 'em quickly.

769
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,505
Don't worry.

770
01:11:25,185 --> 01:11:28,522
Should have been celebrating myself,
if this hadn't come up.

771
01:11:29,272 --> 01:11:31,900
Have to change this missing person notice.

772
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:35,028
It's that lady again.

773
01:11:36,571 --> 01:11:38,323
That's why she disappeared.

774
01:11:40,408 --> 01:11:44,454
She's wanted in connection with some
bank robberies on the West Coast.

775
01:11:45,163 --> 01:11:47,541
When did these robberies take place?

776
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:49,584
Last couple of weeks.

777
01:11:50,961 --> 01:11:53,213
You don't get much news up here,
do you?

778
01:11:53,338 --> 01:11:55,882
My dad's radio only plays music.

779
01:11:58,093 --> 01:12:00,971
Well, all know is that they say she's dangerous,

780
01:12:01,179 --> 01:12:05,600
and that anyone with any information
about her had better call us pronto.

781
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:07,477
That's the law.

782
01:12:22,993 --> 01:12:27,914
Two weeks!
Can't be our girl, Tom.

783
01:12:28,373 --> 01:12:30,375
No, she's been here all the time.

784
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:31,251
Right!

785
01:12:31,334 --> 01:12:33,712
She couldn't have done
what they are accusing her of.

786
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:36,673
No, that's true, Tom,
you are right.

787
01:12:36,923 --> 01:12:39,926
Still it's an unpleasant business
just the same.

788
01:12:47,392 --> 01:12:50,604
[Narrator] Grace was the same
and so was the town.

789
01:12:51,396 --> 01:12:58,987
That the gangsters had fixed to have
charges made against Grace in their effort
to neuralize her came as no surprise.

790
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:03,575
But everything had changed a little
yet again.

791
01:13:03,617 --> 01:13:10,457
I'm telling you, you have exactly the same
kind of little lump in exactly the same spot
on the other side of your back.

792
01:13:10,499 --> 01:13:11,291
Really!

793
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:21,885
I can only assume that it belongs
on your body, but you're the doctor, so...

794
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:28,600
Well, it's very unlikely, don't you think?
that a cancer would develop in such precise symmetry.

795
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:34,439
- Mr. Edison, please. We've been
over this so many times.
- Anything is possible.

796
01:13:34,481 --> 01:13:42,072
I think you have to accept the fact
that you are an exceptionally healthy elderly gentleman.

797
01:13:42,614 --> 01:13:45,033
I'm gonna rest just the same.

798
01:13:45,116 --> 01:13:46,576
I'll see you in the morning.

799
01:13:47,035 --> 01:13:48,370
I hope so.

800
01:13:48,954 --> 01:13:51,289
What? What did they say?

801
01:13:51,498 --> 01:13:58,588
Well, they couldn't really argue
that anything had changed.

802
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,802
But by not telling the police they felt
they were committing a crime themselves.

803
01:14:07,514 --> 01:14:09,391
- I think I should leave.
- No..

804
01:14:09,474 --> 01:14:10,809
Enough is enough.

805
01:14:10,851 --> 01:14:12,686
I suggested the opposite.

806
01:14:13,728 --> 01:14:14,855
You did?

807
01:14:15,355 --> 01:14:18,859
From a business perspective, ...

808
01:14:20,277 --> 01:14:26,700
from a business perspective,
your presence in Dogville has become more costly.

809
01:14:27,409 --> 01:14:30,871
Because it's more dangerous
for them to have you here,

810
01:14:31,037 --> 01:14:33,248
not that they don't want you,

811
01:14:33,957 --> 01:14:39,462
since they feel there should be
some counterbalance,

812
01:14:40,338 --> 01:14:42,382
some quid pro quo.

813
01:14:42,424 --> 01:14:45,302
That sound like words
that the gangsters would use...

814
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:50,348
There is also more of an incentive
if you don't wanna stay.

815
01:14:52,392 --> 01:14:59,316
See, with all those wanted posters
hanging around the place, I can hardly
think of anywhere else you could hide.

816
01:15:01,401 --> 01:15:04,404
So what's the counterbalance
that you suggested?

817
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:14,456
They wanted you to work longer hours,
but instead what I proposed is

818
01:15:14,456 --> 01:15:20,212
that you just pay a visit to folks
twice a day now.

819
01:15:20,337 --> 01:15:26,843
That way it would seem that you're willing
to contribute more, without actually
lengthening your day too much.

820
01:15:26,968 --> 01:15:29,930
It's just a way of heading off
any unpleasantness.

821
01:15:35,352 --> 01:15:42,359
Well, it sounds a little peculiar
and difficult to put into practice.

822
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:44,361
That's what I thought.

823
01:15:44,778 --> 01:15:48,281
Martha she said she would ring
her bell every half hour,

824
01:15:48,365 --> 01:15:51,493
so you could keep track of
your new schedule.

825
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:56,164
Then, they are all willing to let me stay?

826
01:15:56,206 --> 01:16:04,005
No. See, Mrs. Henson she also
thought we should cut your pay.

827
01:16:04,506 --> 01:16:13,181
Merely a symbolic gesture. You see...
the word dangerous on that poster worried her.

828
01:16:15,183 --> 01:16:21,982
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
If I have to work harder, longer hours for less pay,

829
01:16:22,023 --> 01:16:25,152
then I'm willing to do that.
Of course, I am.

830
01:16:26,903 --> 01:16:32,075
I just wanna be sure that they
wouldn't prefer that I left town.

831
01:16:32,117 --> 01:16:33,618
Of course not.

832
01:16:36,204 --> 01:16:38,498
You think this is for the best?

833
01:16:39,374 --> 01:16:41,251
I know it is.

834
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:52,971
I have to get some sleep. My days are
gonna be much busier now.

835
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:54,347
Sorry.

836
01:17:18,914 --> 01:17:25,462
Tom, I just need to know something...

837
01:17:28,089 --> 01:17:31,718
you know the card that the man
in the car gave you...

838
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:32,844
Yeah.

839
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:41,019
Did you show it to anyone?

840
01:17:41,728 --> 01:17:46,441
Come on, Grace!
I burned it first thing.

841
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:50,529
I've been so silly.
Of course you did.

842
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:52,030
It's alright.

843
01:17:52,781 --> 01:17:57,494
No, it's not alright. I hate it
for you to see me like this.

844
01:17:57,536 --> 01:17:59,830
I can't bare that I'm doubting you.

845
01:18:00,247 --> 01:18:02,999
I'm sorry.
Good night.

846
01:18:23,228 --> 01:18:28,024
[Narrator] Everybody was really against
any changes to Grace's working conditions at all

847
01:18:28,108 --> 01:18:31,027
when the subjuct occasionally
came up in conversation.

848
01:18:38,994 --> 01:18:43,331
Oh, Ben had declared in sympathy that
he wouldn't accept any more work than before,

849
01:18:43,456 --> 01:18:45,458
and Grace was grateful for that,

850
01:18:46,751 --> 01:18:49,462
even if he was a bit drunk
when he said so.

851
01:18:52,966 --> 01:18:59,431
Busy minute became busy hours,
and busy hours became busy days.

852
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:06,813
and irrespective of whether they thought
the idea of increasing Grace's services had
any fairness and justification to it or not,

853
01:19:06,897 --> 01:19:09,983
it didn't seem to make anyone any happier.

854
01:19:10,108 --> 01:19:12,402
More to the contrary.

855
01:19:14,279 --> 01:19:17,908
Grace, oh.. You have to be more careful.

856
01:19:18,283 --> 01:19:22,120
Liz wasn't very careful either,
but she didn't break our glasses.

857
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:28,543
I think you need to understand that Mr. Henson
works very hard to grind off any traces of moulds.

858
01:19:29,085 --> 01:19:33,089
and it makes the glass weak.
I thought you knew that.

859
01:19:33,173 --> 01:19:37,177
It won't happen again.
Of course, I'll pay for it.

860
01:19:37,928 --> 01:19:41,765
No, of course not. You don't have to
pay us for it. We'll get over it.

861
01:19:43,809 --> 01:19:49,856
[Narrator] And off she went to keep
her appointment with Chuck to free
the last tree trunks from the grass

862
01:19:49,856 --> 01:19:53,068
in order to keep the ever busy mice away.

863
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:57,739
She was in a hurry and took the shortcut
between the gooseberry bushes,

864
01:19:57,781 --> 01:20:00,075
only to be brought up by a shout.

865
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,118
- Grace!
- Yes!

866
01:20:04,871 --> 01:20:10,961
Oh, I didn't see that you just
raked the path. I'm sorry.

867
01:20:11,002 --> 01:20:13,129
It isn't that I've just raked it.

868
01:20:13,338 --> 01:20:18,051
The idea is that people can pass
around the bushes completely.

869
01:20:18,135 --> 01:20:20,262
I prefer it that way,
as you should know.

870
01:20:21,513 --> 01:20:27,018
I thought that these chains were put up
to make a path between the bushes.

871
01:20:27,018 --> 01:20:29,312
They were put up there to protect the bushes.

872
01:20:29,312 --> 01:20:31,189
It is not supposed to be a pathway.

873
01:20:31,273 --> 01:20:33,108
But everyone goes this way.

874
01:20:33,775 --> 01:20:37,404
Dear, that's right.
They have been living here for years.

875
01:20:37,445 --> 01:20:39,114
You haven't been here that long.

876
01:20:40,699 --> 01:20:47,122
Are you saying, that I am less entitled
to use the shortcut
because I haven't always lived here?

877
01:20:47,205 --> 01:20:47,998
No, of course not.

878
01:20:47,998 --> 01:20:52,169
No, I just thought it pleased you
to be here, that's all.

879
01:20:54,254 --> 01:20:55,297
Go on.
Go on, it's alright.

880
01:20:56,339 --> 01:20:57,382
I'll see you this afternoon..

881
01:20:59,468 --> 01:21:02,596
and I'll rake those bushes like they've
never been raked before, I promise.

882
01:21:10,058 --> 01:21:14,521
I'm sorry about that branch.
There were so many apples on it.

883
01:21:16,482 --> 01:21:19,943
I should have cut that brance,
but I got greedy.

884
01:21:21,153 --> 01:21:24,114
Is it greedy to want to feed your family?

885
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:31,788
So how come you don't like me?

886
01:21:35,709 --> 01:21:37,920
Why do you ask me that?

887
01:21:38,629 --> 01:21:40,631
When I get close to you,
you edge away.

888
01:21:42,633 --> 01:21:45,594
- No, I don't.
- You did so.

889
01:21:46,553 --> 01:21:49,223
When we were thinning the seedlings
in the bottom row.

890
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:53,769
How am I supposed to show you what I do
if I ain't allow to touch you?

891
01:21:55,854 --> 01:21:57,773
You tried to kiss me.

892
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:11,578
Vera never took any interest in the apples.
She hates the orchard.

893
01:22:13,288 --> 01:22:18,627
The is the first time I've ever met anyone,
who understand about the apples.

894
01:22:19,753 --> 01:22:21,922
Sorry... it made me so happy.

895
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,386
It's alright.

896
01:22:27,386 --> 01:22:32,391
No, it ain't alright. I reckon the stuff
about the apples is just words in your mouth.

897
01:22:33,559 --> 01:22:35,853
If you can't really share my pleasure...

898
01:22:36,436 --> 01:22:37,729
I do.

899
01:22:38,981 --> 01:22:43,026
Vera wants me to picking apples
from trees that are barely in the ground.

900
01:22:43,944 --> 01:22:46,363
Things take time. That's love!

901
01:22:47,072 --> 01:22:51,660
Seeing what they need and
respecting those needs.

902
01:22:51,743 --> 01:22:54,163
If anyone understands that, it's you.
At least I thought so.

903
01:22:54,204 --> 01:22:55,581
I do understand that.

904
01:22:55,581 --> 01:22:57,833
But you edge away when I get close.

905
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:02,171
- Why do you find me so repugnant?
- I don't find you repugnant.

906
01:23:04,298 --> 01:23:05,924
Don't be upset.

907
01:23:07,551 --> 01:23:11,722
I'm sorry if I doubted you.
It won't happen again.

908
01:23:13,765 --> 01:23:15,434
I promise you.

909
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:20,814
I wouldn't make that promise if I were you.

910
01:23:26,987 --> 01:23:29,907
When you fended me off,
a thought came into my mind

911
01:23:30,115 --> 01:23:34,745
that made me ashamed.
A thought that you would hate me for.

912
01:23:35,662 --> 01:23:39,374
I would never hate you, never.

913
01:23:44,421 --> 01:23:45,255
What?

914
01:23:47,758 --> 01:23:53,847
Chuck, I've treated you unfairly.
It's alright to have angry
thoughts.

915
01:23:55,808 --> 01:23:58,727
I thought of turning you in!

916
01:24:00,729 --> 01:24:03,315
I thought of blackmailing you
into respecting me.

917
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:18,330
It means that much to you?
It does, doesn't it?

918
01:24:20,749 --> 01:24:23,752
You've really been alone up here,
haven't you?

919
01:24:24,253 --> 01:24:31,051
You haven't had anyone to comfort you
and I should ask you for forgiveness.

920
01:24:38,559 --> 01:24:40,144
Still friends?

921
01:25:09,631 --> 01:25:12,759
- Sorry... Were you asleep?
- No.

922
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,848
- Do you want me to leave?
- No, I was just resting.

923
01:25:18,098 --> 01:25:25,522
Awful lot to do here in Dogville,
considering nobody needs anything done.

924
01:25:27,566 --> 01:25:30,903
Jason wants to sit on my lap all the time.

925
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,743
I think you're doing a wonderful job.

926
01:25:39,453 --> 01:25:43,832
You give us all so much.
What Mr. McKay said...

927
01:25:43,916 --> 01:25:47,419
right on the button..
right on the button.

928
01:25:47,961 --> 01:25:50,964
He tried to put his hands on my knee today.

929
01:25:51,006 --> 01:25:54,885
Oh, he is blind, after all.
Probably an accident.

930
01:25:58,222 --> 01:26:05,354
And Ma Ginger got angry at me
for running across the gravel path.

931
01:26:07,648 --> 01:26:11,193
Well good. She gets angry at me,

932
01:26:13,278 --> 01:26:15,781
which just means that you're one of us now.

933
01:26:15,906 --> 01:26:18,659
You can see through it all, can't you?

934
01:26:34,675 --> 01:26:37,928
I'll tell you, I'm gonna be asleep
in two minutes.

935
01:26:38,262 --> 01:26:40,764
What if I don't want you to go to sleep?

936
01:26:41,098 --> 01:26:43,392
I don't think you have a choice tonight.

937
01:26:54,653 --> 01:26:56,864
I do love you, Grace.

938
01:26:58,198 --> 01:27:04,413
I'm glad you love me.
I love you, too. I really do.

939
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:14,673
No, I mean, I yearn for you
when I am not with you.

940
01:27:18,969 --> 01:27:22,931
I yearn for you even
when we're alone like this.

941
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:32,107
I yearn to be even closer to you...
to touch you, the way that people...

942
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:35,027
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

943
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:42,242
The thing that I love about you is
that you don't demand anything of me.

944
01:27:42,367 --> 01:27:46,622
That we can just be together.

945
01:27:46,788 --> 01:27:47,956
Yeah.

946
01:27:50,042 --> 01:27:53,504
Yearning will only make it better.

947
01:28:00,803 --> 01:28:06,517
Thank you for your words,
your wise wise words.

948
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,312
You're welcome.

949
01:28:13,482 --> 01:28:15,108
Do you want your shoes off?

950
01:28:41,552 --> 01:28:45,973
Jason, what are you doing here?
That's wrong.

951
01:28:47,307 --> 01:28:50,102
The words have to be divided differently.

952
01:28:52,437 --> 01:28:53,605
Stop it.

953
01:28:54,022 --> 01:28:56,608
How's that for dividing the words?

954
01:28:58,902 --> 01:29:01,405
This is not a good day.
Everybody should leave.

955
01:29:01,446 --> 01:29:04,867
Everybody except Jason.
Jason, I wanna talk to you alone.

956
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:08,412
What is it?
What's going on?

957
01:29:09,705 --> 01:29:14,209
I can be very bad.
I bet my pa told you.

958
01:29:14,209 --> 01:29:18,172
I don't think that.
I think there is another reason for this.

959
01:29:19,631 --> 01:29:24,678
I'd love to have you on my lap all the time,
but I can't, not with the others here.

960
01:29:26,472 --> 01:29:30,225
When somebody can't do all the things
they'd like to do for others,

961
01:29:30,726 --> 01:29:34,021
sometimes the people they promised get mad.

962
01:29:35,314 --> 01:29:37,774
That's what Mrs. Henson says.

963
01:29:39,735 --> 01:29:40,819
Yes, that's true.

964
01:29:40,861 --> 01:29:44,072
I suppose I know why you won't let
me sit in your lap anymore.

965
01:29:45,407 --> 01:29:47,701
- Why?
- Because I've been mean lately.

966
01:29:47,743 --> 01:29:51,997
Oh, come on. I'm sure you have
your reasons for that.

967
01:29:52,456 --> 01:29:57,211
I have been mean to the others, too,
even baby Achilles.

968
01:29:57,503 --> 01:30:00,589
And he's so tiny he can't put up a fight.

969
01:30:02,049 --> 01:30:05,052
- It's not right
- No, it's not.

970
01:30:05,135 --> 01:30:08,514
I got it coming to me, I know.

971
01:30:09,223 --> 01:30:10,766
I deserve a spanking.

972
01:30:10,808 --> 01:30:14,228
What? I should hit you?
I'm not gonna do that.

973
01:30:15,145 --> 01:30:18,565
Your mother doesn't believe in
physical discipline. I'm not gonna hit you.

974
01:30:18,607 --> 01:30:23,153
I know. She'd be awful mad
if she found out you whipped me.

975
01:30:23,987 --> 01:30:26,240
Oh, I just said I won't do that.

976
01:30:26,406 --> 01:30:33,330
It's good having ma on your side, right?
It'd be pretty serious if she turned against you.

977
01:30:33,372 --> 01:30:36,291
I am the way I am.
If people in this town don't like me,

978
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:39,294
then there is nothing I can do about that.

979
01:30:40,128 --> 01:30:42,714
I feel bad I need to be punished.

980
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,218
The fact is, I wouldn't have any respect
for you if you don't give me a spanking.

981
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:49,221
I don't care how much fun you think it would be.

982
01:30:49,263 --> 01:30:52,015
I'm not gonna spank you, Jason.

983
01:30:53,016 --> 01:30:59,606
In that case, when Ma gets home
maybe I'll just have to tell her you hit me.

984
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:01,191
But I just said that I wouldn't!

985
01:31:01,233 --> 01:31:03,819
I reckon Ma'll take my word for it.

986
01:31:05,154 --> 01:31:08,615
If you give me that spanking,
nobody's ever have to know.

987
01:31:14,413 --> 01:31:17,374
Stop it. Get away from Achilles.
Stop it.

988
01:31:18,292 --> 01:31:22,504
I gave his crib a shove.
It's not my fault it didn't tip over.

989
01:31:22,546 --> 01:31:25,382
Don't you touch him.
Move away from the crib.

990
01:31:25,466 --> 01:31:27,843
Stop it, Jason. Stop it!

991
01:31:27,968 --> 01:31:29,887
All right. You want a spanking.
I'll give you a spanking...

992
01:31:29,928 --> 01:31:32,055
Come here.
Come here!

993
01:31:34,725 --> 01:31:37,853
- There! There we go.
- That wasn't hard.

994
01:31:38,187 --> 01:31:41,023
It's gotta be hard or it isn't punishment.

995
01:31:41,231 --> 01:31:43,775
- All right.
- Harder!

996
01:31:46,111 --> 01:31:48,780
Oh, this is... come on.
All right, that's enough.

997
01:31:48,989 --> 01:31:50,199
That is enough punishment now.

998
01:31:50,282 --> 01:31:53,869
Maybe I should go stand in the corner
and be ashamed?

999
01:31:53,911 --> 01:31:57,372
I don't care.. Stand in the corner.
Do whatever you gotta do.

1000
01:31:57,498 --> 01:31:59,082
Hey, there is Pa!

1001
01:32:02,294 --> 01:32:05,506
He's early. I hope there is nothing wrong.

1002
01:32:05,547 --> 01:32:13,138
[Narrator] Just as Dogville had done from
its open, frail shelf on the mountainside,
quite unprotected from any capricious storms,

1003
01:32:13,222 --> 01:32:16,099
Grace, too, had laid herself open.

1004
01:32:17,017 --> 01:32:22,397
And there she dangled from her frail stalk
like the apple in the Garden of Eden.

1005
01:32:22,773 --> 01:32:26,610
An apple so swollen that the juices almost ran.

1006
01:32:28,445 --> 01:32:32,533
And once again the police
had come to Dogville.

1007
01:32:34,451 --> 01:32:40,082
I said I'd tell you, to save Martha
the confusion about the ringing. But I forgot.

1008
01:32:40,165 --> 01:32:42,042
They're already down by Canyon Road.

1009
01:32:42,084 --> 01:32:45,337
The fellow in the other car is from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1010
01:32:45,379 --> 01:32:47,381
- You forgot!
- Yah.

1011
01:32:48,173 --> 01:32:50,175
It is the busy time for the apples,
you know.

1012
01:32:50,175 --> 01:32:51,176
The FBI?

1013
01:32:52,052 --> 01:32:55,889
They were most interested in hearing
what I'd seen in the past six months,

1014
01:32:56,098 --> 01:32:58,684
anything related to that wanted poster.

1015
01:32:59,059 --> 01:33:04,648
They asked me if I'd seen any signs
in the woods of anyone camping out there.

1016
01:33:04,773 --> 01:33:07,568
God only knows
what that woman's capable of.

1017
01:33:07,651 --> 01:33:09,736
You know, she is not capable of anything.

1018
01:33:09,736 --> 01:33:15,784
Well, that's what you say.
But it sure didn't sound that way coming from the laws.

1019
01:33:17,452 --> 01:33:19,955
That's why I felt I had to tell 'em
what I knew.

1020
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:24,334
What did you tell them?

1021
01:33:24,877 --> 01:33:27,796
Well, I thought I'd seen something
in the woods recently.

1022
01:33:28,255 --> 01:33:30,716
An item of clothing to be exact.

1023
01:33:30,883 --> 01:33:33,969
It turned out that it was just
an old hat Tom had lost.

1024
01:33:34,303 --> 01:33:37,181
- But it could've been this.
-  Chuck.. give me..

1025
01:33:37,181 --> 01:33:41,810
Expensive, by the feel of it,
and your initials on it.

1026
01:33:45,022 --> 01:33:48,692
I imagine they'd draw the same conclusion
from this as anybody would.

1027
01:33:48,692 --> 01:33:53,447
I told the law it'd take me no time at all
to find this piece of clothing.

1028
01:33:54,323 --> 01:33:59,703
I reckon we got us ten minutes, maybe fifteen,
'fore they start knocking on doors.

1029
01:33:59,912 --> 01:34:04,500
I wouldn't try to run away.
They are sure to see you.

1030
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:06,627
Why would I wanna run away, Chuck?

1031
01:34:06,752 --> 01:34:08,587
I wouldn't try to holler, either.

1032
01:34:08,587 --> 01:34:10,506
Why would I wanna do that?

1033
01:34:10,631 --> 01:34:12,674
It wasn't me who wanted you here.

1034
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,385
You were far to beautiful and frail
for this place.

1035
01:34:16,929 --> 01:34:19,556
You tricked me into feeling that
I meant something to you.

1036
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:22,142
It's your own damn fault.
I need your respect, Grace.

1037
01:34:22,643 --> 01:34:25,896
- You have my respect.
- I want your respect.

1038
01:34:25,979 --> 01:34:26,647
Don't...!

1039
01:34:40,911 --> 01:34:42,871
This is wrong..

1040
01:34:44,498 --> 01:34:50,212
If I can force the flowers to bloom
early in spring, I can force you...

1041
01:34:51,338 --> 01:34:52,881
Please...

1042
01:35:02,891 --> 01:35:07,938
Stop it!
Please.. Please... Please, don't!

1043
01:35:08,147 --> 01:35:10,816
Please! Please...

1044
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,528
Please look at me, talk to me.

1045
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:18,490
We're friends, you and my family..

1046
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:23,745
Stop it!

1047
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:24,640
Have you seen Grace?

1048
01:36:25,349 --> 01:36:26,892
She's at my place.

1049
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:30,854
- Is she busy?
- Not anymore. Go right in.

1050
01:36:55,921 --> 01:37:02,511
[Narrator] Yet again Grace had made
a miraculous escape from her pursuers
with the aid of the people of Dogville.

1051
01:37:03,095 --> 01:37:07,683
Everyone had covered up for her,
including Chuck, who had to admit

1052
01:37:07,724 --> 01:37:13,105
that it was probably Tom's hat he'd
mistakenly considered so suspicious.

1053
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:33,041
That evening Tom had sensed at once
that something had taken place,

1054
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:37,546
but had to plead with Grace for ages
before she finally broke down

1055
01:37:37,754 --> 01:37:40,466
and unburdened herself.

1056
01:37:40,507 --> 01:37:42,676
- I have to confront him. I mean.
- No!

1057
01:37:42,801 --> 01:37:44,511
- I have no other choice.
- No.

1058
01:37:44,595 --> 01:37:47,598
- No one will accept what he did to you. No one.
- I don't want you to.

1059
01:37:47,723 --> 01:37:53,937
I came here with all these ideas
and these stupid prejudices.

1060
01:37:56,815 --> 01:38:00,360
He is not strong, Tom.

1061
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,863
He looks strong, but he's not.

1062
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:08,202
I'm gonna start looking for a way
to get you out of here.

1063
01:38:20,964 --> 01:38:23,133
[Narrator] The end of the summer had come.

1064
01:38:23,258 --> 01:38:30,641
And in Elm Street the second clutch of
Dogville's scatty squirrels scooted in and out
of the legs of children and grown-ups alike

1065
01:38:30,724 --> 01:38:34,686
searching in vain for Elm Street's non-existent elms.

1066
01:38:36,271 --> 01:38:42,611
The heat had turned the soil among the gooseberry
bushes to stone, but Grace did not complain.

1067
01:38:42,653 --> 01:38:44,863
She threw herself into her work,

1068
01:38:44,905 --> 01:38:49,493
happy that it was something you could
actually grasp between your fingers.

1069
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:51,829
Hey, Liz!
Hey, Vera!

1070
01:38:51,912 --> 01:38:55,249
Better watch out, Grace.
Vera's got it in for you today.

1071
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:58,085
What are you talking about?

1072
01:38:59,586 --> 01:39:02,089
Maybe you thought he wouldn't tell me?

1073
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:06,176
Who?

1074
01:39:07,678 --> 01:39:09,972
You hit Jason.

1075
01:39:12,099 --> 01:39:13,350
I did.

1076
01:39:13,725 --> 01:39:16,145
How could you do such a thing?

1077
01:39:16,937 --> 01:39:21,275
I know it sounds implausible,
but he was asking for it.

1078
01:39:21,817 --> 01:39:25,112
It's true, Vera. He's always asking for it.

1079
01:39:27,114 --> 01:39:29,950
I should have done that myself
a long time ago.

1080
01:39:30,492 --> 01:39:32,828
- Liz!
- It's your fault, the way you've spoiled him.

1081
01:39:32,953 --> 01:39:39,042
I know how much you love him,
Vera. So do I...

1082
01:39:39,334 --> 01:39:43,297
It won't happen again.
It really won't.

1083
01:39:43,422 --> 01:39:48,218
No. I know it won't, because I'll
never leave them with you again.

1084
01:39:48,927 --> 01:39:51,638
That'd be far too dangerous
for any child of mine.

1085
01:39:51,722 --> 01:39:53,182
I've been tired.

1086
01:39:53,223 --> 01:39:58,729
Well, maybe you should see about
sleeping at night, like most folks do.

1087
01:39:58,812 --> 01:40:00,189
Sleeping at night?

1088
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:10,991
Martha saw a certain Tom Edison Jr.
sneak out of her shed early this morning.

1089
01:40:15,954 --> 01:40:19,333
Grace, you won't hear anything from me
about whipping that idiot kid.

1090
01:40:19,625 --> 01:40:23,837
And I'm also grateful to you for turning
Tom's wandering eye away from my skirts.

1091
01:40:24,546 --> 01:40:27,382
But on the other hand, I'd expected
more from you than that.

1092
01:40:29,802 --> 01:40:33,138
But if that's the kind of thing you're after,
then I'm sure, with your innocent look,

1093
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:35,974
you will do just fine
in a place like Dogville.

1094
01:40:36,058 --> 01:40:38,477
- It's not what I'm after, Liz.
- Oh, no?

1095
01:40:38,602 --> 01:40:43,357
We all saw you take his hand to the picnic.
Maybe that wasn't flirting?

1096
01:40:45,442 --> 01:40:49,154
Yes... Maybe I was flirting..

1097
01:40:58,205 --> 01:41:04,503
[Narrator] Next day the weather changed.
The fog came rolling down from the mountains.

1098
01:41:04,711 --> 01:41:11,093
And althought there were no sunsets to be seen,
McKay thought it best that she sat by him anyway.

1099
01:41:11,426 --> 01:41:14,888
She had sat by Jack McKay so many times now,

1100
01:41:15,013 --> 01:41:19,184
but Jack had not got better
at judging the distance between them.

1101
01:41:19,393 --> 01:41:24,273
On the contrary, where fingers alone
had previously brushed her young flesh,

1102
01:41:24,356 --> 01:41:29,695
now it was a and that remained in place
throughout the allotted span.

1103
01:41:32,156 --> 01:41:36,785
The hour in the orchard were long now,
for the harvest was under way.

1104
01:41:36,952 --> 01:41:42,916
And Grace had long since given up arguing
with Chuck's perception that respect for cultivation,

1105
01:41:42,958 --> 01:41:48,338
harvest, and fruit could be directly
measured in provision of carnality.

1106
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:54,678
Though reluctant to leave Grace alone,
Tom wantered around quite often now,

1107
01:41:54,761 --> 01:41:59,308
lost in thought as he tried to crack
the problem of possible escape.

1108
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:05,772
And as Grace's wages no longer found
their way to her purse he had stepped in,

1109
01:42:05,814 --> 01:42:12,821
and together they had triumphantly picked up
the last of the seven figurines
from Ma Ginger's windows.

1110
01:42:22,664 --> 01:42:24,208
What's the matter?

1111
01:42:25,292 --> 01:42:29,046
- Nothing.
- Are the police on Canyon Road again?

1112
01:42:30,339 --> 01:42:37,221
No. This is just girl talk.

1113
01:42:37,888 --> 01:42:41,892
It's funny you should mention Canyon Road,
though... right, Martha?

1114
01:42:41,975 --> 01:42:44,812
- She was just there this morning.
- Yeah.

1115
01:42:44,853 --> 01:42:48,774
- On the way home from church...
- You see so much more on foot, you know.

1116
01:42:48,899 --> 01:42:54,112
When you're in a car you never notice
the apple orchard, for example.

1117
01:42:56,865 --> 01:43:01,328
You can only see it from one spot
on Canyon Road.

1118
01:43:01,703 --> 01:43:05,332
- Do you know that spot, Martha?
- Yes I do.

1119
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,630
And did you stop there to enjoy
the view this morning?

1120
01:43:11,713 --> 01:43:15,342
It's harvest time, you know,
in the orchard after all.

1121
01:43:15,425 --> 01:43:18,929
The old masters always loved
a good harvest theme.

1122
01:43:18,929 --> 01:43:27,896
Redolent, with fertility, not to mention
sensibility or even eroticism.

1123
01:43:31,066 --> 01:43:36,530
But how silly of me to ask you that, Martha,
because you already said you did.

1124
01:43:39,867 --> 01:43:42,161
She saw you, Grace..

1125
01:43:46,665 --> 01:43:49,710
She saw you..

1126
01:43:51,962 --> 01:43:55,215
behind this pile of broken limbs..

1127
01:43:56,842 --> 01:43:58,343
with Chuck...

1128
01:44:02,055 --> 01:44:06,310
He said it wasn't the first time
you'd made advances towards him.

1129
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:12,441
He never told me before because
he wanted to spare my feelings.

1130
01:44:14,026 --> 01:44:19,281
He's a withdrawn and primitive man,

1131
01:44:21,992 --> 01:44:27,122
but at heart he's loyal
and he is good.

1132
01:44:27,164 --> 01:44:30,542
What do you want with my husband?

1133
01:44:31,919 --> 01:44:41,178
I don't want anything with
your husband or anybody.

1134
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:43,889
What about Tom and the hand-holding
at the picnic?

1135
01:44:44,515 --> 01:44:46,892
That's different. I like Tom.

1136
01:44:48,769 --> 01:44:50,896
But you don't like Chuck.

1137
01:44:50,979 --> 01:44:56,652
Liz and Martha are behind me, when I tell you
that I'm going to have to teach you a lesson.

1138
01:44:56,652 --> 01:44:59,404
I believe in education.

1139
01:45:03,367 --> 01:45:03,992
Vera!

1140
01:45:04,326 --> 01:45:09,373
No. I believe smashing them is
less a crime than making them.

1141
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:15,254
Vera.. remember how I taught your children..

1142
01:45:15,379 --> 01:45:19,258
- What?
- Remember how happy you were, when I...

1143
01:45:19,424 --> 01:45:23,220
- When you what?
- When I taught your children
about the doctrine of stoicism

1144
01:45:23,262 --> 01:45:25,514
and they finally understood it.

1145
01:45:27,391 --> 01:45:29,726
All right.. For that, I'm gonna be lenient.

1146
01:45:29,726 --> 01:45:33,397
I'm going to break two of your figurines first,

1147
01:45:36,108 --> 01:45:45,701
and if you can demonstrate your knowledge
of the doctrine of stoicism by holding back your tears,

1148
01:45:46,034 --> 01:45:50,873
I'll stop.
Have you got that?

1149
01:46:04,219 --> 01:46:09,516
[Narrator] In her lifetime Grace had
considerable practice at constraining her emotions,

1150
01:46:09,558 --> 01:46:13,479
and would never have believed
it would be hard to control them now.

1151
01:46:14,688 --> 01:46:22,029
But as the porcelain pulverized on the floor
it was as if it were human tissue disintegrating.

1152
01:46:23,655 --> 01:46:28,410
The figurines were the offspring of
the meeting between the
township and her.

1153
01:46:28,619 --> 01:46:35,334
They were the proof that in spite of everything,
her suffering had created something of value.

1154
01:46:36,126 --> 01:46:38,796
Grace could not longer cope.

1155
01:46:39,963 --> 01:46:45,511
For the first time since her childhood,
she wept.

1156
01:47:14,957 --> 01:47:22,256
Grace went to see Tom that very night,
and informed him that she was ready
to follow his advice and leave the township.

1157
01:47:23,298 --> 01:47:29,555
And since Tom had just made up his mind
that a third party would be needed
to ensure the success of an escape,

1158
01:47:29,763 --> 01:47:33,600
they agreed that Ben possessed
the greatest potential.

1159
01:47:34,935 --> 01:47:38,856
But it was a case where money
was required, Tom concluded,

1160
01:47:39,064 --> 01:47:45,946
and estimated, that considering the times and all,
ten dollars would suffice for Ben and his truck.

1161
01:47:46,029 --> 01:47:49,158
- But we don't have ten dollars.
- No. We borrow it.

1162
01:47:51,076 --> 01:47:53,620
- From whom?
- From Dad.

1163
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:56,874
He has more than that in the medicine closet.

1164
01:47:56,957 --> 01:47:59,543
I talk to him in the morning and arrange a loan.

1165
01:48:00,294 --> 01:48:02,004
But you have a word with Ben...

1166
01:48:02,087 --> 01:48:04,840
It's the end of the week,
he's bound to be flat broke.

1167
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:08,886
Tell your father that I will pay him back.

1168
01:48:09,303 --> 01:48:10,762
Of course.

1169
01:48:15,434 --> 01:48:16,560
Thank you.

1170
01:48:20,147 --> 01:48:23,650
You are always rescuing me.

1171
01:48:27,404 --> 01:48:30,532
I can't believe that you go on
being there for me.

1172
01:48:33,327 --> 01:48:34,369
Good night..

1173
01:48:37,539 --> 01:48:39,124
You should get some sleep.

1174
01:48:48,342 --> 01:48:51,178
[Narrator] Grace went to see Ben next morning.

1175
01:48:55,432 --> 01:48:59,311
When Grace presented the payment
as compensation between friends,

1176
01:48:59,353 --> 01:49:01,772
Ben did not object too heartily,

1177
01:49:01,772 --> 01:49:07,361
considering the trouble he could receive
from the rest of the towns-people
when they realized what had happened.

1178
01:49:07,528 --> 01:49:10,864
Perhaps they'd all be relieved
that she was out of their lives,

1179
01:49:11,281 --> 01:49:14,785
but somehow Grace wasn't too sure of that.

1180
01:49:15,369 --> 01:49:22,084
Ben agreed to drive her, even though he wasn't
out to profit from other folks' misfortunes, as he put it.

1181
01:49:22,084 --> 01:49:26,130
- I don't wanna profit from other folks' misfortunes.
- No..

1182
01:49:26,255 --> 01:49:30,926
[Narrator] The fact was that Ben would have driven
to the gates of Hell and back for ten dollars

1183
01:49:31,176 --> 01:49:35,305
And the criminal aspect bugged him less
than Grace would ever have guessed;

1184
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:38,809
he had freighted all kinds of things
in his day.

1185
01:49:39,226 --> 01:49:42,771
The plan was for Grace to hide
among the apples.

1186
01:49:42,855 --> 01:49:47,860
Knowing the exact time to harvest is the
greatest art of all, Chuck had said,

1187
01:49:48,068 --> 01:49:53,031
and the time had come
for the apples and for Grace.

1188
01:49:53,031 --> 01:49:55,033
Grace, where've you been?

1189
01:49:55,159 --> 01:49:59,121
If I'd displayed the same indifference
to the timing of my chores I'd be in for a whippin'

1190
01:49:59,163 --> 01:50:00,664
Now get a move on!

1191
01:50:01,457 --> 01:50:05,252
I'm sorry, Olivia.
I had to talk to Ben about something.

1192
01:50:05,335 --> 01:50:06,712
June is near to bursting.

1193
01:50:06,795 --> 01:50:09,465
She can't use the pot on her own,
as you well know.

1194
01:50:09,465 --> 01:50:13,343
It ain't fittin' to toy with her just 'cause
she's crippled and can't help herself.

1195
01:50:17,681 --> 01:50:25,856
[Narrator] The evening before the escape
Tom tactically thought it best not to press
his desires of the flesh too hard upon Grace,

1196
01:50:26,064 --> 01:50:30,444
and instead he adopted a more
sensitive approach.

1197
01:50:32,404 --> 01:50:38,702
But there is a right and a wrong time
to plant seeds and you can't plant seeds in the winter.

1198
01:50:39,912 --> 01:50:43,999
That's true.
But I love you...

1199
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:47,002
- I know.
- And you love me

1200
01:50:47,336 --> 01:50:50,380
and we will meet again in love
and in freedom.

1201
01:50:50,422 --> 01:50:52,216
Absolutely.

1202
01:50:53,258 --> 01:50:57,221
I shouldn't be ashamed wanting you, should I?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1203
01:50:57,221 --> 01:50:58,472
No...

1204
01:50:59,723 --> 01:51:03,393
- No.
- No.. no. It's lovely. It's lovely that we want each other.

1205
01:51:05,395 --> 01:51:07,773
- But not this way.
- No.

1206
01:51:08,106 --> 01:51:09,858
It's not right.

1207
01:51:20,869 --> 01:51:25,666
[Narrator] The next morning, when Grace
wanted to slip down to Ben's as invisibly as possible,

1208
01:51:25,791 --> 01:51:30,838
it seemed to Grace that the entire township
was up and about at the same time.

1209
01:51:31,463 --> 01:51:33,882
- Grace!
- Yes, Vera..

1210
01:51:34,091 --> 01:51:39,429
If you think that by hitting my child you can
get out of working for me, think again.

1211
01:51:39,513 --> 01:51:41,306
Why don't you just come by as planned,

1212
01:51:41,306 --> 01:51:46,353
and we'll find something
where you won't be able to harm anyone.

1213
01:51:46,478 --> 01:51:49,398
- At twelve o'clock?
- Yes.

1214
01:51:49,565 --> 01:51:53,277
Why are you taking your copious
belongings around with you?

1215
01:51:53,485 --> 01:51:55,445
Afraid you are gonna loose them?

1216
01:51:55,654 --> 01:51:58,657
Grace, Ben's hauling apples today
so we won't be loading glasses.

1217
01:51:58,949 --> 01:52:02,828
But that don't mean you're off work.
Dad wants you to repack the whole last load.

1218
01:52:03,537 --> 01:52:05,998
Maybe you can do it better
and we'll have an extra crate.

1219
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:11,128
An old crate like that may not have much
value in your eyes, but this is Dogville.

1220
01:52:11,378 --> 01:52:13,213
We're not wealthy here.

1221
01:52:14,256 --> 01:52:18,302
And if your hands get a bit red, well,
I've got a tip about something you can rub on 'em.

1222
01:52:18,385 --> 01:52:21,430
- Grace!
- Oh, Martha..

1223
01:52:23,765 --> 01:52:26,351
We have to wash the flagstones
at the foot of the steps again.

1224
01:52:26,477 --> 01:52:29,146
Dirt has gone blown under the door.
I can't get the door open.

1225
01:52:29,188 --> 01:52:34,401
Where have you been?
Harvest is the holiest time of the year.

1226
01:52:34,985 --> 01:52:37,321
Does it not sound like something
you could have said?

1227
01:52:38,197 --> 01:52:43,410
I'll be down in a minute, Chuck.
I'll bring the crates down.

1228
01:52:44,077 --> 01:52:44,912
Good.

1229
01:52:45,704 --> 01:52:47,956
[Narrator] As Grace hastened to the garage,

1230
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:53,378
she grew more and more pleased with
the decision to keep her departure under wrap.

1231
01:52:54,421 --> 01:52:58,759
There was actually quite a bit of work
Dogville didn't need doing

1232
01:52:58,801 --> 01:53:02,971
that its residents would have to carry out
for themselves in future.

1233
01:53:04,056 --> 01:53:09,478
Yeah, er, Grace, I don't like having to say this,
but I'd like to ask if I could have the money up front.

1234
01:53:10,187 --> 01:53:13,148
See, it's always the way in the freight industry.

1235
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:17,736
Once you deliver a load you ain't got much
to bargain with, if you catch my drift.

1236
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:19,696
Of course. Here's the money.

1237
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:22,825
Not that this is a professional job,
of course.

1238
01:53:22,825 --> 01:53:24,618
- Don't get out...
- All right, Ben.

1239
01:53:25,202 --> 01:53:26,370
'till I give the say-so!

1240
01:53:47,558 --> 01:53:53,522
[Narrator] Canyon Road snaked down the valley
and away, and Grace went too,

1241
01:53:53,814 --> 01:54:00,988
and with every bend the township and its noises
faded ever more mercifully behind her.

1242
01:54:50,245 --> 01:54:52,122
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah.

1243
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:56,168
There are a hell lot of.. a lot of police up ahead.

1244
01:54:57,878 --> 01:54:59,755
I wasn't expecting that.

1245
01:55:01,131 --> 01:55:06,345
It's more dangerous than I thought.
We'll have to go back.

1246
01:55:08,388 --> 01:55:10,307
No! we can't do that.

1247
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:13,143
It's just....

1248
01:55:13,477 --> 01:55:20,526
if this was a professional transport job,
you know, paid proper like...it'd be a lot easier, but...

1249
01:55:22,694 --> 01:55:24,655
But it's been paid for...

1250
01:55:25,072 --> 01:55:32,913
Yeah, but, in the freight industry carrying
dangerous load it cost more.

1251
01:55:33,872 --> 01:55:36,250
A surcharge, they call it.

1252
01:55:37,376 --> 01:55:43,382
If this were a professional job,
I could just charge you.

1253
01:55:45,843 --> 01:55:48,554
But Bun, I don't have any more money.

1254
01:55:53,767 --> 01:55:56,353
Oh, that's no good then.

1255
01:56:00,482 --> 01:56:07,698
You said once, you said once,
that there aren't many pleasures in my life.

1256
01:56:10,659 --> 01:56:13,829
And you know, I go to Miss Laura
once a week.

1257
01:56:15,205 --> 01:56:22,212
And you got me to see that it weren't
nothing to be ashamed of.

1258
01:56:26,925 --> 01:56:29,678
I was gonna go there tonight...

1259
01:56:32,181 --> 01:56:36,059
and of course it costs me.

1260
01:56:37,895 --> 01:56:42,191
I mean, not as much as...

1261
01:56:43,984 --> 01:56:51,825
not as much as a surcharge
for dangerous goods, but  still...

1262
01:56:54,536 --> 01:56:56,538
it does cost me, you know.

1263
01:56:57,289 --> 01:56:59,958
No, Ben, no... please don't..

1264
01:57:00,459 --> 01:57:04,755
It's not personal, Grace.
It's not personal. I just...

1265
01:57:06,507 --> 01:57:09,301
I have to take due payment, that's all.

1266
01:57:10,219 --> 01:57:13,347
I don't .. I don't have a choice.

1267
01:57:14,223 --> 01:57:17,434
I can't buck the freight in this big craft.

1268
01:57:21,021 --> 01:57:26,652
We're parked in the square in Georgetown.
Right outside the church.

1269
01:57:27,986 --> 01:57:30,197
You'd better keep your voice down.

1270
01:57:34,326 --> 01:57:35,911
No, Ben...

1271
01:57:35,994 --> 01:57:41,708
This ain't somethin' I'm proud of, Grace.
Don't go thinking that.

1272
01:58:14,491 --> 01:58:22,749
[Narrator] Grace fell asleep on the long highway,
thanks to her healthy ability to push
any unpleasantness around her far away.

1273
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:27,963
A generous God had blessed her with
the rare talent of being able to look ahead,

1274
01:58:28,422 --> 01:58:30,424
and only ahead.

1275
01:58:32,009 --> 01:58:38,932
And later when the truck slowed down
about to reach its destination and she slowly
returned to consciousness,

1276
01:58:38,932 --> 01:58:42,561
she had no way of knowing how long she had slept.

1277
01:58:42,603 --> 01:58:47,483
All she knew was that she would be
happy to see the light of day again.

1278
01:58:49,985 --> 01:58:52,488
And then she heard the dog.

1279
01:58:58,243 --> 01:59:01,747
All your fondness for apples seems
less and less believable.

1280
01:59:02,581 --> 01:59:04,041
You've bruised 'em.

1281
01:59:16,929 --> 01:59:19,890
We had a meeting last night
at the mission house.

1282
01:59:22,267 --> 01:59:25,604
They said you might be going to try to run away,

1283
01:59:25,687 --> 01:59:30,317
so when I discovered you'd hidden
yourself away on my truck,

1284
01:59:31,693 --> 01:59:35,072
I didn't have no choice but
to bring you back to Dogville.

1285
01:59:36,865 --> 01:59:39,785
In the freight industry we can't take sides.

1286
02:00:24,121 --> 02:00:29,251
[Narrator] It didn't help Grace that the first theft
ever registered in Dogville had taken place
the previous evening,

1287
02:00:29,293 --> 02:00:33,672
when most people were assembled
for the town meeting.

1288
02:00:34,131 --> 02:00:39,511
Old Tom Edison Senior had a considerable
sum of money stolen from his medicine closet

1289
02:00:39,511 --> 02:00:42,097
and suspicion soon fell on Grace,

1290
02:00:42,139 --> 02:00:47,102
who had apparently been planning an escape
that would surely require funding.

1291
02:00:47,478 --> 02:00:51,940
Grace chose to remain silent
in the face of these new charges.

1292
02:00:53,317 --> 02:00:59,281
And then Bill, who had lately improved his
engineering skills to an astonishing degree,

1293
02:00:59,573 --> 02:01:05,120
had, by way of his first design, implemented
a kind of escape prevention mechanism.

1294
02:01:05,496 --> 02:01:11,460
Beautiful it might not have been,
but effective he dared say it was.

1295
02:01:22,513 --> 02:01:26,975
Grace, we don't like having to do this.

1296
02:01:27,768 --> 02:01:32,523
We don't have much of a choice
if we are to protect our community.

1297
02:01:32,856 --> 02:01:37,152
Could you... Do you mind moving?
Try moving.

1298
02:01:57,381 --> 02:01:58,507
It works.

1299
02:01:59,758 --> 02:02:06,056
We had to make this heavy enough so that
it can only move where the ground's level.

1300
02:02:06,223 --> 02:02:09,601
And the ground is level in town.

1301
02:02:14,815 --> 02:02:16,775
May I go now?

1302
02:02:22,531 --> 02:02:26,034
I have to figure out
how I'm going to get into my house.

1303
02:02:28,203 --> 02:02:31,874
Or is that part of the punishment,
having to sleep outdoors?

1304
02:02:32,332 --> 02:02:34,960
No, no no Grace.

1305
02:02:35,002 --> 02:02:39,173
Don't think of this as punishment.
Not at all!

1306
02:02:40,215 --> 02:02:45,262
Bill, he made the chain long enough
so that you can sleep in your bed.

1307
02:02:56,315 --> 02:02:57,858
Grace, six o'clock.

1308
02:03:01,111 --> 02:03:03,405
Yes, Mrs. Henson.

1309
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:34,394
I couldn't run the risk of Dad turning me down.

1310
02:03:34,436 --> 02:03:37,189
But, they think it was me that took the money.

1311
02:03:38,106 --> 02:03:40,150
'Cause I told them so.

1312
02:03:44,238 --> 02:03:46,073
You did what?

1313
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:49,827
First they suspected me, but then
I convinced them that it was you,

1314
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:52,663
since you were the one
using the medicine closet.

1315
02:03:54,081 --> 02:03:54,998
Why?

1316
02:03:55,541 --> 02:03:57,417
Because I'm here to do the thinking for you.

1317
02:03:57,459 --> 02:04:01,797
If we are to have the slightest chance
of getting you out of
here,

1318
02:04:03,132 --> 02:04:06,009
they can never know how close we really are.

1319
02:04:07,678 --> 02:04:11,223
They can't know I'm trying to help you.

1320
02:04:13,392 --> 02:04:17,604
If they knew it was me that took the money,
I wouldn't be here talking to you now.

1321
02:04:20,566 --> 02:04:23,110
Please don't disappear, Tom.

1322
02:04:29,116 --> 02:04:30,826
I need you.

1323
02:04:33,954 --> 02:04:37,374
I'll break this one...
with some thinking.

1324
02:04:47,426 --> 02:04:54,892
[Narrator] It was not Grace's pride that kept
her going during the days when fall came
and the trees were losing their leaves,

1325
02:04:54,975 --> 02:05:00,314
but more of the trance-like state that descends
on animals whose lives are threatened,

1326
02:05:00,314 --> 02:05:04,693
a state in which the body reacts mechanically,
in a low, tough gear,

1327
02:05:04,693 --> 02:05:07,738
without too much painful reflection.

1328
02:05:07,779 --> 02:05:12,451
Like a patient passively letting
his disease hold sway.

1329
02:05:13,494 --> 02:05:20,959
And now that Vera had received proof that it was
in fact Chuck who'd forced his attentions on Grace,

1330
02:05:21,001 --> 02:05:23,337
she was meaner than ever.

1331
02:05:26,715 --> 02:05:32,221
Had Grace had friends in Dogville
they, too, fell like the leaves.

1332
02:05:33,806 --> 02:05:40,771
The most towns-people of the male sex now
visited Grace at night to fulfill their sexual needs.

1333
02:05:42,231 --> 02:05:45,067
It had occurred to the children
to give the bell an extra ring

1334
02:05:45,150 --> 02:05:50,781
every time such an act had been consummated,
much to Martha's confusion.

1335
02:05:52,950 --> 02:05:57,871
But since the chain had been attached
things had become easier for everyone:

1336
02:05:59,373 --> 02:06:03,210
the harassments in bed did not have to be
kept so secret anymore,

1337
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:06,797
because they couldn't really be
compared to a sexual act.

1338
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:11,802
They were embarrassing in the way it is
when a hillbilly has his way with a cow,

1339
02:06:11,844 --> 02:06:13,303
but no more than that.

1340
02:06:15,347 --> 02:06:17,224
Tom saw everything.

1341
02:06:17,266 --> 02:06:22,604
It pained him, and the sexual visits
were a particularly severe blow.

1342
02:06:29,361 --> 02:06:34,783
But he supported her as best he could,
the way a spider supports,

1343
02:06:34,825 --> 02:06:38,579
when it has been tangled
in its own web by the wind.

1344
02:06:39,580 --> 02:06:40,706
Tom!

1345
02:06:47,546 --> 02:06:50,466
Everything I tried to do went wrong.

1346
02:06:51,592 --> 02:06:54,845
I can't come up with the answe
I was looking for.

1347
02:06:54,887 --> 02:06:59,641
You'll come up with it, you'll see.
You're very clever.

1348
02:07:01,268 --> 02:07:06,273
- We provoked them.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

1349
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:15,157
We provoked them.
Now it is time for us to provoke ourselves.

1350
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:16,492
What do you mean?

1351
02:07:16,533 --> 02:07:21,288
I mean, by showing them some trust.

1352
02:07:21,371 --> 02:07:25,751
It all started with a meeting, so it will be
logical to end it with
one, too.

1353
02:07:26,001 --> 02:07:30,214
You'll talk and they'll listen.
They can't refuse to listen.

1354
02:07:32,299 --> 02:07:35,928
- What will I say?
- Everything. You'll say everything.

1355
02:07:36,011 --> 02:07:38,931
- Everything?
- Yeah, the truth. The Truth.

1356
02:07:38,931 --> 02:07:41,600
Just the truth about each and
every one of them.

1357
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,852
I don't think they are gonna want to hear that.

1358
02:07:43,894 --> 02:07:49,942
I know, I know. It is like a child
who doesn't want to take his medicine.

1359
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:56,865
They'll be furious at first, but in the end
they'll see it is for their own good.

1360
02:07:56,907 --> 02:08:00,786
Just don't be hateful. Don't be reproving.

1361
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:04,706
If anybody can do it,
Grace, you can.

1362
02:08:05,499 --> 02:08:13,048
They'll all realize that this weapon and
this understanding and injustice
has only one true victim and that's you.

1363
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:17,094
And from there it is only
one small step to forgiveness.

1364
02:08:18,262 --> 02:08:23,433
You've done some hard thinking, Tom Edison.

1365
02:08:24,184 --> 02:08:28,981
I'm sure it is an excellent plan.
I'm sure.

1366
02:08:48,375 --> 02:08:53,630
[Narrator] If forgiveness was close at hand
in the mission house, they were all hiding it well.

1367
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:57,926
It hadn't been easy for Tom to get them there.

1368
02:08:58,469 --> 02:09:04,558
Appealing to consciences stowed farther
and farther away by their owners every day

1369
02:09:04,641 --> 02:09:11,023
as if they were as fragile as Henson's
glasses after polishing, had proved quite a task.

1370
02:09:11,648 --> 02:09:15,652
But if one was going, the others
might as well come along, too,

1371
02:09:15,652 --> 02:09:18,489
so nobody could talk behind anybody's back.

1372
02:09:20,657 --> 02:09:24,161
Tom had set the scene for Grace's speech.

1373
02:09:24,495 --> 02:09:30,083
Now she'd have to sink or swim,
and sincerity be brought to bear.

1374
02:09:31,794 --> 02:09:36,590
While Grace addressed the silent congregation
in the mission house on Elm Street

1375
02:09:36,632 --> 02:09:40,844
the first of the early autumn snowstorms
embraced the town.

1376
02:09:41,428 --> 02:09:47,768
The snowflakes dusted down over the old
buildings as if this were just any old town.

1377
02:09:48,185 --> 02:09:52,272
And they played in the brances and twigs
from which the apples had hung,

1378
02:09:52,356 --> 02:09:57,110
but luckily the harvest was home and
via the freight industry had found a market

1379
02:09:57,152 --> 02:10:00,322
despite the ever disappointing prices.

1380
02:10:00,572 --> 02:10:03,534
Grace had presented her story with clarity.

1381
02:10:03,575 --> 02:10:06,662
She had not embellished or understated.

1382
02:10:06,662 --> 02:10:11,750
And just as she finished the snowflakes
all at once stopped tumbling down,

1383
02:10:12,543 --> 02:10:20,008
leaving Dogville clad in the daintiest,
whitest blanket of snow imaginable.

1384
02:10:38,485 --> 02:10:40,737
I don't think it went very well.

1385
02:10:40,946 --> 02:10:43,824
It's fine. You did good.

1386
02:10:51,874 --> 02:10:56,462
[Narrator] The snow had come early,
perhaps too early.

1387
02:10:56,587 --> 02:10:59,923
A misplaced augury of conciliation.

1388
02:11:00,966 --> 02:11:03,760
Tom looked around, worried:

1389
02:11:03,844 --> 02:11:07,848
Vera's teeth were clenched.
She was the first to speak.

1390
02:11:07,890 --> 02:11:10,517
Copious lies. Just lies.

1391
02:11:10,559 --> 02:11:15,147
Yes, Tom. It doesn't accord with the perceptions
I got of this town and its residents.

1392
02:11:15,981 --> 02:11:19,985
I'm a doctor, damn it, I don't need
anyone to tell me if I'm sick or not.

1393
02:11:20,027 --> 02:11:22,112
What do you have to say for yourself, Tom?

1394
02:11:22,321 --> 02:11:24,615
Maybe it's time you picked sides!

1395
02:11:25,199 --> 02:11:27,451
Are you for us or against us?

1396
02:11:27,493 --> 02:11:30,370
Liz is right. We've been
far too indulgent with Tom.

1397
02:11:30,412 --> 02:11:34,124
Tom, I got to tell you.
Even I have trouble defending that girl.

1398
02:11:34,666 --> 02:11:39,213
With your help, which I prefer to think
was accidental, Tom,

1399
02:11:39,797 --> 02:11:46,637
she has managed to spread bitterness
and troubles throughout this whole town.

1400
02:11:46,637 --> 02:11:49,264
She has to go.
How do we get rid of her, Tom?

1401
02:11:49,264 --> 02:11:50,849
So how do we do it, Tom?

1402
02:11:50,891 --> 02:11:55,312
I agree, Tom. You brought her in here.
You got to figure out how to get her out.

1403
02:11:55,312 --> 02:11:57,815
Without her lies and accusations spreading.

1404
02:12:00,818 --> 02:12:03,028
I asked you here to listen.

1405
02:12:06,115 --> 02:12:08,242
You only came to defend yourselves.

1406
02:12:08,700 --> 02:12:13,080
I'm sorry
it's quite a blow to me...

1407
02:12:14,414 --> 02:12:22,339
to see all of my friends act this way,
so uncivilized.

1408
02:13:17,102 --> 02:13:20,814
Your plan didn't work out very well, did it?

1409
02:13:21,982 --> 02:13:24,610
- You'll think of another one.
- No,

1410
02:13:26,779 --> 02:13:29,823
No more plans, I promise.

1411
02:13:35,204 --> 02:13:38,290
They asked me to choose between you and them.

1412
02:13:40,501 --> 02:13:43,921
That's not difficult on a day like today.
I love you.

1413
02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:51,929
You may be stronger, it's true,
but the ideals, the ideals we share.

1414
02:13:53,180 --> 02:13:58,644
You're exhausted. Lie down.

1415
02:14:05,692 --> 02:14:11,448
I've chosen, Grace.
I have chosen you.

1416
02:14:15,994 --> 02:14:20,874
Now it is the time!
The time we've been waiting for.

1417
02:14:25,921 --> 02:14:28,465
We free ourselves of Dogville.

1418
02:14:34,888 --> 02:14:41,436
You're right. You're right, Tom.
It'd be so easy to make love right now.

1419
02:14:43,647 --> 02:14:49,528
They may kill us any minute..
It would be the perfect romantic ending.

1420
02:14:49,611 --> 02:14:52,322
I know. I feel it too. I love you.

1421
02:14:55,993 --> 02:14:58,745
It would be so beautiful, but from ...

1422
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:04,835
from the point of view of our love,
so completely wrong.

1423
02:15:09,006 --> 02:15:12,092
We were to meet in freedom.

1424
02:15:24,813 --> 02:15:27,107
You're cold now, Grace.

1425
02:15:36,825 --> 02:15:41,288
I've just rejected everybody
I've ever known in your favor.

1426
02:15:43,624 --> 02:15:48,921
Wouldn't it be worth compromising,
just one of your ideals just a little to ease my pain?

1427
02:15:52,257 --> 02:15:55,511
Everybody in this town has
had your body, but me.

1428
02:15:56,595 --> 02:15:59,056
We're the ones supposed to be in love.

1429
02:16:02,017 --> 02:16:04,353
My darling Tom.

1430
02:16:08,065 --> 02:16:11,193
You can have me if you want me.

1431
02:16:14,238 --> 02:16:16,698
Just do what the others do.

1432
02:16:18,075 --> 02:16:19,701
Threaten me...

1433
02:16:20,119 --> 02:16:25,958
Tell me that you'll turn me in to the law,
to the gangsters and I promise you,

1434
02:16:27,292 --> 02:16:30,838
you can take whatever it is you want from me.

1435
02:16:32,339 --> 02:16:34,341
I trust you...

1436
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:40,430
but maybe you don't trust yourself?

1437
02:16:41,056 --> 02:16:47,604
Perhaps you've been tempted, you've been
tempted to join the others and force me.

1438
02:16:47,604 --> 02:16:50,732
Perhaps that's why you're so upset.

1439
02:16:50,941 --> 02:16:53,527
All I've ever tried to do is help you.

1440
02:16:53,986 --> 02:16:58,740
I'm just asking if you're afraid
that you could be so human.

1441
02:16:58,866 --> 02:17:01,702
No, I'm not afraid of that.
Not in the least.

1442
02:17:03,036 --> 02:17:04,705
Good.

1443
02:17:09,168 --> 02:17:12,254
Let tomorrow bring that it's gonna bring.

1444
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:20,512
It's not a crime to doubt yourself, Tom..

1445
02:17:22,931 --> 02:17:25,225
but it's wonderful that you don't.

1446
02:17:27,769 --> 02:17:29,813
I can't find the rest.

1447
02:17:32,941 --> 02:17:35,694
Maybe I should go out
for a couple of minutes.

1448
02:17:37,821 --> 02:17:40,282
Take a walk or something...
I don't know.

1449
02:17:42,785 --> 02:17:44,995
To get it all out of my system.

1450
02:17:47,414 --> 02:17:49,374
Trudge the streets..

1451
02:17:50,417 --> 02:17:54,379
Listen to the wind as it passes through
the woods up through the valley

1452
02:17:55,339 --> 02:17:56,840
and all that.

1453
02:18:01,053 --> 02:18:02,721
You go to sleep, though...

1454
02:18:06,517 --> 02:18:13,357
You go to sleep
and I will be back very soon.

1455
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:24,159
[Narrator] Of course it was all a load of nonsense.

1456
02:18:24,243 --> 02:18:29,498
If anybody was capable of keeping track
of ideals and reality, he was.

1457
02:18:29,623 --> 02:18:35,337
After all, it was his job.
Moral issues were his home ground.

1458
02:18:36,213 --> 02:18:41,301
To think that he might doubt his own purity
was really to think very little of him.

1459
02:18:42,177 --> 02:18:44,596
Tom was angry.

1460
02:18:47,099 --> 02:18:50,686
And in the midst of it all,
he discovered why.

1461
02:18:51,353 --> 02:18:54,439
It was not because of he'd been wrongly accused,

1462
02:18:54,481 --> 02:18:57,317
but because the charges were true!

1463
02:18:58,902 --> 02:19:04,575
His anger consisted of a most unpleasant
feeling of being found out!

1464
02:19:07,494 --> 02:19:10,747
It was all quite a blow to the young philosopher!

1465
02:19:10,789 --> 02:19:17,504
And realistically enough, he thought
that if the doubt was already present, it could grow.

1466
02:19:17,546 --> 02:19:23,886
Perhaps so great that one day it would prove
detrimental to his entire moral mission.

1467
02:19:24,136 --> 02:19:26,346
Tom stopped.

1468
02:19:26,388 --> 02:19:31,810
He almost began to shake when the threat
to his career as a writer dawned upon him.

1469
02:19:31,894 --> 02:19:37,649
It didn't take him long to agree with himself
that the risk was too great to run.

1470
02:19:37,649 --> 02:19:42,321
The danger Grace was to the town
she was also to him!

1471
02:19:42,488 --> 02:19:44,656
Tom did not like it.

1472
02:19:44,698 --> 02:19:48,786
And he was man enough
to take action to prevent it.

1473
02:19:51,288 --> 02:19:57,920
Fortunately Tom was as conscientious
as regards his future profession as he was practical.

1474
02:19:57,961 --> 02:20:02,174
He allowed sincerity and ideals
plenty of room in his life,

1475
02:20:02,216 --> 02:20:06,053
without getting "sentimental" about it,
as he would put it.

1476
02:20:06,970 --> 02:20:15,896
Throwing away a document that might be
of significance to Tom and with him future generation
of readers as the basis of a novel or indeed a trilogy,

1477
02:20:16,063 --> 02:20:19,566
was not an act he was so stupid to commit,

1478
02:20:19,566 --> 02:20:24,655
although he had to admit that in a moment
of weakness he might have said he would.

1479
02:20:28,158 --> 02:20:34,873
Before returning to the meeting that night
Tom opened the little drawer he had open
the night of Grace's arrival,

1480
02:20:35,624 --> 02:20:37,668
and found it still there:

1481
02:20:38,001 --> 02:20:40,879
the card from the gangster in the car.

1482
02:21:02,151 --> 02:21:05,946
[Narrator] The next day the sun was shining
in the brisk autumn sky,

1483
02:21:06,029 --> 02:21:08,532
and the snow was long since gone.

1484
02:21:10,576 --> 02:21:14,830
For the first time for ages the pile driver
could be heard in the marshlands

1485
02:21:14,872 --> 02:21:21,295
as it hammered in the piles for what might
or what might not be a penitentiary.

1486
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:27,634
Grace opened her eyes after an almost
unconscious sleep, and was confused.

1487
02:21:27,676 --> 02:21:32,764
Judging by the light coming through the cracks
in the walls, it had to be nearly midday.

1488
02:21:32,848 --> 02:21:38,061
"The grey hour" as Jack McKay
for some reason called noon in Dogville,

1489
02:21:38,228 --> 02:21:45,486
being a man of many ideas and proclivities,
quite a few of which Grace would prefer to remain ignorant of.

1490
02:21:46,403 --> 02:21:48,947
But why had nobody roused her?

1491
02:21:48,989 --> 02:21:51,325
Nobody had hammered furiously at her door.

1492
02:21:51,408 --> 02:21:56,663
Not a child had thrown mud into her bed
or broken her remaining windowpanes.

1493
02:21:57,664 --> 02:21:59,958
Now she remembered.

1494
02:21:59,958 --> 02:22:05,339
She recalled the meeting the previous day,
and puzzled still more.

1495
02:22:05,631 --> 02:22:11,178
Why had she not been confronted with
the outcome of that meeting? Or even killed?

1496
02:22:11,762 --> 02:22:16,433
It was quite unlike Dogville to restrain
its indignation at any point.

1497
02:22:16,683 --> 02:22:19,812
Perhaps things had turned out well after all?

1498
02:22:19,853 --> 02:22:23,190
- Good morning, Mrs. Henson.
- Oh.. good morning?

1499
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:28,237
I would have come earlier. I overslept.

1500
02:22:28,445 --> 02:22:31,782
Oh, never mind.
Liz put her back into it htis morning.

1501
02:22:33,242 --> 02:22:36,161
We thought some time off would be good for you.

1502
02:22:39,665 --> 02:22:41,917
That was quite a speech you made yesterday.

1503
02:22:42,251 --> 02:22:44,711
It gave us all something to think about.

1504
02:22:48,841 --> 02:22:51,468
- Hello, Liz!
- Hi, Grace..

1505
02:22:58,684 --> 02:23:00,936
I overslept.

1506
02:23:01,895 --> 02:23:05,274
- Good morning Miss Grace?
- Good morning..

1507
02:23:05,274 --> 02:23:09,361
- How are you this morning?
- I overslept.

1508
02:23:09,403 --> 02:23:11,488
Oh, that's all right.

1509
02:23:17,453 --> 02:23:21,039
Tom. Tom, I think it's Grace.

1510
02:23:21,665 --> 02:23:27,129
Hello, Grace. Two seconds..
Good news.

1511
02:23:35,721 --> 02:23:38,140
I went back to the meeting last night.

1512
02:23:39,975 --> 02:23:42,811
I wasn't going to let them get off so easily.

1513
02:23:44,688 --> 02:23:47,483
But I'll be damned if the mood hadn't changed.

1514
02:23:48,817 --> 02:23:53,363
I wouldn't say we won exactly, not exactly,
but I think something very good can come out of this,

1515
02:23:53,447 --> 02:23:55,616
- something very good.
- Why didn't you come back and tell me?

1516
02:23:55,657 --> 02:23:58,744
I did, but you were asleep.

1517
02:23:59,203 --> 02:24:01,663
And you know,
you looked like you needed it..

1518
02:24:02,915 --> 02:24:06,126
and that made me suggest
that maybe you should have some time off.

1519
02:24:06,168 --> 02:24:11,131
And you know,
not one single person objected.

1520
02:24:15,344 --> 02:24:17,054
That sounds wonderful.

1521
02:24:17,179 --> 02:24:19,139
I know it does, doesn't it?

1522
02:24:19,848 --> 02:24:23,268
The people of this town
they surprise me again and again.

1523
02:24:24,686 --> 02:24:28,190
I might even have to revise
my theories a little bit.

1524
02:24:28,190 --> 02:24:30,692
You know how much I hate
doing that kind of thing.

1525
02:24:32,986 --> 02:24:41,411
You know, Grace, last night when I came back
and I saw you lying there asleep so sweetly,

1526
02:24:41,787 --> 02:24:47,251
I was suddenly inspired.
I wrote the first chapter of a story.

1527
02:24:47,334 --> 02:24:49,670
A story about a small town.

1528
02:24:50,254 --> 02:24:52,297
Guess where I got the inspiration?

1529
02:24:53,132 --> 02:24:56,176
But I haven't come up with a name
for the town yet.

1530
02:24:57,302 --> 02:25:00,389
- Why not just call it Dogville?
- Wouldn't work.

1531
02:25:01,098 --> 02:25:05,435
No, it wouldn't work. It's got to be universal.
Lot of writers make that mistake, you see.

1532
02:25:06,186 --> 02:25:08,355
Hey, do you want me to read it to you?

1533
02:25:08,939 --> 02:25:11,567
If there is any love in it, it comes from you...

1534
02:25:11,567 --> 02:25:14,486
Would you be offended, if I said no?

1535
02:25:15,571 --> 02:25:19,950
- No.
- If I really do have the day to myself, I...

1536
02:25:20,284 --> 02:25:22,703
No. No..

1537
02:25:24,163 --> 02:25:28,542
Two people only hurt each other if they
doubt the love they have for one another.

1538
02:25:30,294 --> 02:25:32,296
You can read it some other time.

1539
02:25:33,839 --> 02:25:37,926
You sit down some place
and gaze out at the mountains.

1540
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:40,345
It's what the girl in my novel does.

1541
02:25:43,724 --> 02:25:47,352
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you. Good news!

1542
02:25:52,816 --> 02:25:57,821
[Narrator] Sensibly, Grace chose to hope
for the best rather than fear the worst,

1543
02:25:57,946 --> 02:26:02,117
and planned to spend the day calmly
washing her clothes and herself,

1544
02:26:02,159 --> 02:26:09,792
which, for some reason or another, she was sure
none of the characters from Tom's
fictitious township would dream of doing.

1545
02:26:13,378 --> 02:26:17,424
And then it was as if Dogville just waited.

1546
02:26:18,550 --> 02:26:23,806
Even the wind dropped,
leaving the town in an unfamiliar calm.

1547
02:26:24,681 --> 02:26:28,811
as if somebody had put a large
cheese dish cover over it,

1548
02:26:29,603 --> 02:26:34,566
and created the kind of quietness
that descends while you are awaiting visitors.

1549
02:26:36,777 --> 02:26:44,076
After two days off Grace had been put back
to work, but the quietness remained.

1550
02:26:44,368 --> 02:26:53,293
Indeed it intensified until on the fifth day
it swelled into a strange mood

1551
02:26:53,335 --> 02:26:57,464
that, all of a sudden, brought all the citizens
to the street to listen.

1552
02:27:00,008 --> 02:27:03,720
They asked each other
if the phone was really still down,

1553
02:27:04,054 --> 02:27:08,934
or if they'd heard about Ben having had to turn
his truck around on his way to Georgetown

1554
02:27:08,976 --> 02:27:13,439
that very morning on account
of a large tree blocking the road.

1555
02:27:13,814 --> 02:27:15,732
They were not worried.

1556
02:27:16,150 --> 02:27:22,322
"worried" was not the right word,
and then Tom spotted the cars.

1557
02:27:24,366 --> 02:27:26,452
Tom has binoculars.
But you can see 'em with the naked eyes.

1558
02:27:26,535 --> 02:27:28,120
There must be at least eight!

1559
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:29,788
I thought the road was blocked.

1560
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:32,166
They must have come through
before the tree came down.

1561
02:27:35,210 --> 02:27:38,881
June's bed! The sheets need changing.
I'll be there in a minute.

1562
02:27:39,882 --> 02:27:41,133
Hello, June.

1563
02:27:43,469 --> 02:27:47,598
[Narrator] Grace had just started on the bed,
which June had soiled yet again,

1564
02:27:47,931 --> 02:27:52,561
when an irritating feeling of wasting her time
forced itself upon her.

1565
02:27:53,770 --> 02:27:57,107
And it was without thinking
she then said the words:

1566
02:27:57,232 --> 02:27:59,568
Nobody gonna sleep here.

1567
02:28:04,573 --> 02:28:07,201
[Narrator] She didn't say them out loud,

1568
02:28:07,201 --> 02:28:12,414
but even so she was startled by the uttrance
that had urged itself upon her.

1569
02:28:14,166 --> 02:28:17,503
Where had these ominous words come from?

1570
02:28:26,762 --> 02:28:31,642
Darkness was falling as Grace made
her way home from work that evening.

1571
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:37,439
The people on the square overlooking the valley
had finally given up hope of seeing anything else

1572
02:28:37,481 --> 02:28:39,566
now the light had faded.

1573
02:28:39,566 --> 02:28:43,028
They trudged up Elm Street in disappointment.

1574
02:28:47,699 --> 02:28:49,326
- Tom?
- Hi, Grace.

1575
02:28:49,368 --> 02:28:54,248
There were some cars, but it's too dark,
we can't see any more.

1576
02:28:54,373 --> 02:28:57,167
We haven't seen much of each other.

1577
02:28:57,751 --> 02:29:00,796
Yah, I know. I've been busy
with my book, you know.

1578
02:29:00,838 --> 02:29:02,589
Can I ask you something?

1579
02:29:03,507 --> 02:29:05,092
Yeah, anything.

1580
02:29:08,679 --> 02:29:11,515
You couldn't bring yourself
to throw it away, could you?

1581
02:29:13,183 --> 02:29:16,645
The number he gave you that night.
You couldn't throw it away.

1582
02:29:16,937 --> 02:29:21,942
I told yhou how dangerous that man was.
That was stupid.

1583
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:34,538
[Narrator] Stupid or not, Tom was soon
a passionate spokesman for locking Grace
in her shed that night.

1584
02:29:36,081 --> 02:29:40,878
If the vehicles were indeed a sign
that the call Tom had placed five days earlier

1585
02:29:40,919 --> 02:29:45,632
on be half of the community to the number
indicated on the card from his bureau drawer

1586
02:29:45,757 --> 02:29:47,718
had at last led to action,

1587
02:29:47,759 --> 02:29:50,971
and Grace was now to be eliminated from their lives,

1588
02:29:51,013 --> 02:29:55,225
it would surely look good
if the town had also locked her up.

1589
02:29:57,394 --> 02:30:01,440
Grace was lying on the bed
when Jason was sent up with the key.

1590
02:30:01,607 --> 02:30:04,151
Grace heard it turn in the lock,

1591
02:30:04,234 --> 02:30:12,451
but she was deeply absorbed by arguments
and thoughts on matters she had otherwise
avoided for the best part of a
year now.

1592
02:30:31,261 --> 02:30:35,641
From the moment when they'd finally heard
the sound of vehicles starting one after the other

1593
02:30:35,682 --> 02:30:37,726
from the direction of the edge of the woods,

1594
02:30:37,768 --> 02:30:40,270
things had moved rapidly.

1595
02:30:40,729 --> 02:30:44,608
Tom had arranged a delegation
to provide a proper reception.

1596
02:30:45,359 --> 02:30:50,823
Dogville might be off the beaten track,
but it was hospitable, nevertheless.

1597
02:31:03,794 --> 02:31:05,963
Welcome gentlemen. Welcome.

1598
02:31:06,046 --> 02:31:08,507
The town places itself at your disposal!

1599
02:31:08,549 --> 02:31:11,760
I should have a large key to give to you.
But I only have this small one.

1600
02:31:11,802 --> 02:31:14,096
- Where is she?
- Secured by this very key.

1601
02:31:14,096 --> 02:31:15,639
Where is she?

1602
02:31:16,056 --> 02:31:19,268
Okay. If you are wondering about that sound.

1603
02:31:19,309 --> 02:31:22,729
The driving piles for the new penitentiary.

1604
02:31:22,771 --> 02:31:27,734
Tell me, has the crime rate really gone up
in this country, as we are lead to believe?

1605
02:31:27,776 --> 02:31:34,116
Maybe people just regard things as criminal,
because they envy their success?

1606
02:31:34,158 --> 02:31:37,953
What's your opinion on the subject?

1607
02:31:38,579 --> 02:31:43,208
Maybe you have none.
I'll get the door... sorry.

1608
02:31:45,878 --> 02:31:48,922
Voila! As the French might say.

1609
02:31:49,131 --> 02:31:50,757
What the hell is this?

1610
02:31:51,175 --> 02:31:52,676
Who did that?

1611
02:31:52,759 --> 02:31:55,429
Billy, put your hand up,
put your hand up.

1612
02:32:04,146 --> 02:32:09,193
We felt safer, when she had the chain on.
You are probably more adapted at handling her kind.

1613
02:32:11,361 --> 02:32:16,742
None of us feel able to accept money
for just helping people.

1614
02:32:16,825 --> 02:32:21,455
I mean not unless it would make you
feel better to diverst yourself.

1615
02:32:21,455 --> 02:32:23,791
- Shut the hell up!
- Absolutely.

1616
02:32:28,378 --> 02:32:35,135
[Narrator] Grace was no expert in exclusive
automobiles, yet she recognized with no difficulty

1617
02:32:35,135 --> 02:32:40,182
the sound of vehicle that was rounding the corner
from Canyon Road at that very moment.

1618
02:32:41,475 --> 02:32:49,399
Alas, in Grace's memory the legendary purr
of the Cadillac series 355C was inextricably linked

1619
02:32:49,441 --> 02:32:53,070
with another, rather less sophisticated sound:

1620
02:32:53,278 --> 02:32:57,241
that of gunfire directed against her person.

1621
02:33:21,181 --> 02:33:22,391
Don't..!

1622
02:33:46,790 --> 02:33:50,752
You need to justify your actions
before you shoot us.

1623
02:33:52,129 --> 02:33:54,131
That's new.

1624
02:33:58,177 --> 02:34:02,347
That could be interpreted as weakness,
Daddy... I'm disappointed in you!

1625
02:34:03,432 --> 02:34:04,683
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

1626
02:34:04,683 --> 02:34:06,852
You shot at me before.

1627
02:34:07,269 --> 02:34:13,233
Yes, I'm sorry. I regret that.

1628
02:34:13,650 --> 02:34:15,402
You ran away.

1629
02:34:15,778 --> 02:34:20,073
But shooting at you certainly
didn't help matters.

1630
02:34:20,199 --> 02:34:23,368
Of course not.
You're far, far too stubborn.

1631
02:34:26,038 --> 02:34:28,457
If you don't want to kill me,
then why did you come?

1632
02:34:28,499 --> 02:34:33,128
Our last conversation, the one in which
you told me what it was you didn't like about me

1633
02:34:33,170 --> 02:34:36,673
never really concluded, as you ran away.

1634
02:34:36,715 --> 02:34:40,219
I should be allowed to tell you
what I don't like about you.

1635
02:34:40,219 --> 02:34:46,099
That I believe would be
a rule of polite conversation.

1636
02:34:46,183 --> 02:34:48,352
That's why you showed up?

1637
02:34:51,230 --> 02:34:53,607
And you call me stubborn.

1638
02:34:53,857 --> 02:34:58,028
You're sure you're not here to force me
to go back and become like you?

1639
02:34:58,237 --> 02:35:04,618
If I thought there was a chance of forcing you,
but of course that will never happen.

1640
02:35:05,035 --> 02:35:13,127
You are more than welcome to return home
and become my daughter again anytime

1641
02:35:13,335 --> 02:35:23,387
and I would even begin to share my power
and responsibility with you if you did.

1642
02:35:23,595 --> 02:35:26,306
Not that you care.

1643
02:35:26,431 --> 02:35:27,933
So what is it?

1644
02:35:28,392 --> 02:35:31,520
What is it, the thing...
the thing that you don't like about me?

1645
02:35:31,562 --> 02:35:34,022
It was a word you used that provoked me.

1646
02:35:34,064 --> 02:35:36,608
You called me arrogant.

1647
02:35:36,859 --> 02:35:40,779
To plunder, as it were, a God given right.
I'd call that arrogant, daddy.

1648
02:35:40,821 --> 02:35:44,074
But that is exactly what I don't like about you.

1649
02:35:44,074 --> 02:35:45,784
It is you that is arrogant.

1650
02:35:45,868 --> 02:35:48,120
That's what you came here to say?

1651
02:35:51,540 --> 02:35:55,169
I'm not the one passing judgement, Daddy.
You are.

1652
02:35:56,253 --> 02:36:00,716
You do not pass judgement,
because you sympathize with them.

1653
02:36:00,799 --> 02:36:07,639
A deprived childhood and a homicide
really isn't necessarily a homicide, right?

1654
02:36:08,140 --> 02:36:10,851
The only thing you can blame is circumstances.

1655
02:36:10,893 --> 02:36:15,731
Rapists and murderers may be the victims,
according to you.

1656
02:36:15,814 --> 02:36:19,067
But I, I call them dogs,

1657
02:36:19,109 --> 02:36:23,363
and if they're lapping up their own vomit
the only way to stop them is with the lash.

1658
02:36:23,405 --> 02:36:25,657
But dogs only obey their own nature.

1659
02:36:25,699 --> 02:36:28,243
So why shouldn't we forgive them?

1660
02:36:28,577 --> 02:36:31,580
Dogs can be taught many useful things,

1661
02:36:31,663 --> 02:36:36,960
but not if we forgive them
every time they obey their own nature.

1662
02:36:48,472 --> 02:36:53,685
So I'm arrogant. I'm arrogant
because I forgive them?

1663
02:36:53,727 --> 02:36:54,978
My God..

1664
02:36:55,229 --> 02:36:59,149
Can't you see how condescending
you are when you say that?

1665
02:36:59,608 --> 02:37:08,200
You have this preconceived notion
that nobody, listne, that nobody can't possibly attain

1666
02:37:08,242 --> 02:37:12,454
the same high ethical standards as you,
so you exonorate them.

1667
02:37:12,538 --> 02:37:17,668
I can not think of anything
more arrogant than that.

1668
02:37:17,709 --> 02:37:23,924
You, my child... my dear child
you forgive others with excuses

1669
02:37:24,007 --> 02:37:26,760
that you would never in the world
permit for yourself.

1670
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:29,513
Why shouldn't I be merciful?
Why?

1671
02:37:29,513 --> 02:37:34,893
No no no.. You should be merciful,
when there is time to be merciful.

1672
02:37:34,977 --> 02:37:40,482
But you must maintain your own standard.
You owe them that. You owe them that.

1673
02:37:41,233 --> 02:37:47,489
The penalty you deserve for your transgressions,
they deserve for their transgressions.

1674
02:37:47,531 --> 02:37:48,991
They are human beings.

1675
02:37:48,991 --> 02:37:53,454
No no no.. Does every human being
need to be accountable for their action?

1676
02:37:53,495 --> 02:37:56,373
Of course they do.
But you don't even give them that chance.

1677
02:37:56,373 --> 02:37:58,959
All that is extremely arrogant.

1678
02:37:58,959 --> 02:38:02,337
I love you. I love you. I love you to death.

1679
02:38:02,713 --> 02:38:06,633
But you are the most arrogant person
I've ever met.

1680
02:38:06,675 --> 02:38:08,886
And you call me arrogant!

1681
02:38:12,973 --> 02:38:17,019
I have no more to say.

1682
02:38:19,855 --> 02:38:23,859
You are arrogant. I'm arrogant.
You've said it. Now you can leave.

1683
02:38:23,901 --> 02:38:26,653
And without my daughter, I suppose?

1684
02:38:32,618 --> 02:38:35,078
- I said, without my daughter?
- Hmm, yes!

1685
02:38:36,455 --> 02:38:39,124
- Well..
- Yes.

1686
02:38:39,208 --> 02:38:49,426
Well, you decide. you decide...
Grace, they say you are having some trouble here.

1687
02:38:50,135 --> 02:38:54,807
No. No more trouble than back home.

1688
02:38:55,057 --> 02:38:57,518
I'll give you a little time to think about this.

1689
02:38:57,559 --> 02:39:00,687
- Perhaps you will change your mind.
- I won't.

1690
02:39:00,979 --> 02:39:05,400
Listen, my love.. power is not so bad...

1691
02:39:05,484 --> 02:39:12,157
I am sure that you can find a way
to make use of it in your own fashion...

1692
02:39:15,202 --> 02:39:17,246
Take a walk and think about it.

1693
02:39:17,996 --> 02:39:29,383
The people who live here are doing their
best under very hard circumstances.

1694
02:39:29,424 --> 02:39:31,468
If you say so, Grace.

1695
02:39:33,345 --> 02:39:40,436
But is their best really good enough?

1696
02:39:42,312 --> 02:39:43,522
Do they love you?

1697
02:39:53,824 --> 02:39:57,119
Grace had already thought for a long time.

1698
02:39:57,161 --> 02:40:01,206
She had known that if she were not shot
when the gangsters arrived

1699
02:40:01,206 --> 02:40:04,710
she would be faced with her father's
suggestion that she return, to become

1700
02:40:04,793 --> 02:40:09,715
a conspirator with him and his gang of
thugs and felons and she did not need any walk

1701
02:40:09,756 --> 02:40:12,426
to reconsider her response to that,

1702
02:40:13,385 --> 02:40:19,391
even though the difference betwen the people
she knew back home and the people
she'd met in Dogville had proven

1703
02:40:19,433 --> 02:40:22,603
somewhat slighter than she'd expected.

1704
02:40:23,854 --> 02:40:28,776
Grace looked at the gooseberry bushes
so fragiles in the smooth darkness.

1705
02:40:28,859 --> 02:40:32,237
It was good to know
that if you did not treat them ill,

1706
02:40:32,404 --> 02:40:37,785
they would be there, come sping as always,
and come summer they'd again be bursting

1707
02:40:37,826 --> 02:40:43,499
with the quite incomprehensible quantity
of berries that were so good in pies,

1708
02:40:43,582 --> 02:40:45,667
specially with cinnamon.

1709
02:40:47,377 --> 02:40:50,631
Grace looked around at the frightened faces
behind the windowpanes

1710
02:40:50,714 --> 02:40:56,720
that were following her every step, and felt
ashamed of being part of inflicting that fear.

1711
02:40:58,430 --> 02:41:03,227
How could she ever hate them for
what was at bottom merely their weakness?

1712
02:41:03,560 --> 02:41:07,272
She would probably have done things
like those that had befallen her

1713
02:41:07,356 --> 02:41:09,858
if she'd lived in one of these houses,

1714
02:41:09,942 --> 02:41:13,821
to measure them by her own yardstick
as her father put it.

1715
02:41:14,196 --> 02:41:24,039
Would she not, in all honesty, have done
the same as Chuck and Vera and Ben and
Mrs. Henson and Tom

1716
02:41:24,456 --> 02:41:27,376
and all these people in their houses?

1717
02:41:30,838 --> 02:41:33,298
Grace paused.

1718
02:41:33,674 --> 02:41:38,554
And while she did, the clouds scattered
and let the moonlight through

1719
02:41:46,103 --> 02:41:50,357
and Dogville underwent another
of little changes of light.

1720
02:42:03,620 --> 02:42:07,249
It was as if the light,
previously so merciful and faint,

1721
02:42:07,291 --> 02:42:11,628
finally refused to cover up for the town any longer.

1722
02:42:12,671 --> 02:42:17,676
Suddenly you could no longer imagine a berry
that would appear one day on a gooseberry bush,

1723
02:42:17,676 --> 02:42:21,096
but only see the thorn that was there right now.

1724
02:42:21,930 --> 02:42:29,229
The light now penetrated every unevenness
and flaw in the buildings... and in...the people!

1725
02:42:32,483 --> 02:42:37,488
And all of a sudden she knew the answer
to her question all too well:

1726
02:42:38,530 --> 02:42:44,745
If she had acted like them, she could not have
defenced a single one of her actions

1727
02:42:44,745 --> 02:42:47,748
and could not have condemned them
harshly enough.

1728
02:42:48,582 --> 02:42:54,546
It was as if her sorrow and pain finally
assumed their rightful place.

1729
02:42:54,797 --> 02:42:59,760
No, what they had done was
not good enough.

1730
02:43:00,177 --> 02:43:04,681
And if one had the power to put it to rights,
it was one's duty to do so,

1731
02:43:04,723 --> 02:43:09,186
for the sake of the other towns,
for the sake of humanity,

1732
02:43:10,187 --> 02:43:16,193
and not least, for the sake of the human being
that was Grace herself.

1733
02:43:24,660 --> 02:43:30,999
If I went back and became your daughter again,

1734
02:43:31,500 --> 02:43:34,211
when would I be given the power
you're talking about?

1735
02:43:38,715 --> 02:43:41,260
- Now?
- At once!

1736
02:43:41,552 --> 02:43:42,594
Why not?

1737
02:43:48,725 --> 02:43:54,648
So that would mean that I'd also take on
the immediate responsibilities at once.

1738
02:43:55,482 --> 02:43:58,110
I'd be a part in the problem solving...

1739
02:43:59,570 --> 02:44:03,115
like the problem.. of Dogville.

1740
02:44:08,954 --> 02:44:13,917
We can start by shooting a dog
and nailing it to a wall.

1741
02:44:14,042 --> 02:44:20,966
Over there beneath that lamp, for example.
Well, it might help. It sometimes does.

1742
02:44:21,258 --> 02:44:27,347
It would only make the town more frightened,
but hardly make it a better place.

1743
02:44:29,558 --> 02:44:31,268
And it could happen again.

1744
02:44:32,144 --> 02:44:44,156
Somebody happening by,
revealing their frailty.

1745
02:44:48,452 --> 02:44:51,705
That's what I wanna use the power for,
if you don't mind.

1746
02:44:55,417 --> 02:44:59,546
I wanna make this world a little better.

1747
02:45:04,009 --> 02:45:07,638
That damn kid won't shup up.
Says he wants to talk to you, Miss.

1748
02:45:07,971 --> 02:45:09,890
Can we just shoot him now?

1749
02:45:11,517 --> 02:45:13,352
Let me talk to him.

1750
02:45:17,940 --> 02:45:19,983
What? What is it?

1751
02:45:22,444 --> 02:45:26,740
A man can't really be blamed
for being scared now, can he?

1752
02:45:27,116 --> 02:45:29,034
- No. That's true.
- No!

1753
02:45:29,618 --> 02:45:31,495
I'm scared, Grace.

1754
02:45:31,745 --> 02:45:34,623
I used you. And I'm sorry.

1755
02:45:34,748 --> 02:45:39,253
I am stupid, I am.
Maybe even arrogant sometimes.

1756
02:45:41,463 --> 02:45:42,923
You are, Tom.

1757
02:45:45,467 --> 02:45:49,847
Although using people is not very charming,
I think you have to agree

1758
02:45:49,930 --> 02:45:54,768
that this specific illustration
has surpassed all expectations.

1759
02:45:54,810 --> 02:45:56,937
It says so much about being human.

1760
02:45:57,229 --> 02:46:01,859
It's been painful, but I think you also have to
agree it has been edifying. Wouldn't you say?

1761
02:46:01,942 --> 02:46:05,821
Not now, Tom.
Not now.

1762
02:46:10,117 --> 02:46:14,246
If there is any town in this world
would be better without, this is it.

1763
02:46:20,711 --> 02:46:22,754
Shoot them and burn down the town.

1764
02:46:27,342 --> 02:46:30,345
What?
Something else, honey?

1765
02:46:31,305 --> 02:46:33,682
There is a family with kids...

1766
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:39,605
do the kids first and make the mother watch.

1767
02:46:40,063 --> 02:46:43,984
Tell her you will stop if she can
hold back her tears.

1768
02:46:47,988 --> 02:46:50,073
I owe her that.

1769
02:46:56,580 --> 02:46:59,792
I'm afraid she cries a little too easily.

1770
02:47:02,127 --> 02:47:04,797
We'd better get you out of here.

1771
02:47:06,173 --> 02:47:09,301
I'm afraid, you've learned
far too much already.

1772
02:47:15,641 --> 02:47:19,353
Are you cold, Sweetie.
Do you need a wrap?

1773
02:47:20,187 --> 02:47:21,355
I'm fine.

1774
02:47:24,608 --> 02:47:27,945
You want the curtains opened?
You don't need them anymore.

1775
02:47:28,403 --> 02:47:29,988
What do you think?

1776
02:47:36,036 --> 02:47:42,000
I think we should open them.
I think it's appropriate.

1777
02:49:39,284 --> 02:49:40,828
Bingo, Grace!

1778
02:49:43,455 --> 02:49:44,414
Bingo!

1779
02:49:46,792 --> 02:49:50,587
I have to tell you, your illustration
beat the hell out of mine.

1780
02:49:52,965 --> 02:49:57,719
It's frightening, yes, but so clear.

1781
02:49:59,138 --> 02:50:04,768
Do you think that I can allow myself
to use it as an inspiration in my writing?

1782
02:50:14,069 --> 02:50:15,529
Goodbye Tom.

1783
02:50:42,431 --> 02:50:47,311
- Somethings you have to do yourself.
- Really

1784
02:50:50,856 --> 02:50:53,901
That one you're gonna have to explain
to me on the way home.

1785
02:50:55,444 --> 02:50:57,321
[Narrator] Suddenly there was a noise.

1786
02:50:57,446 --> 02:51:02,367
Not so persuasive and powerful
as it had been on a rainy night in spring,

1787
02:51:02,451 --> 02:51:08,457
but loud enough to work its way through
the final sighs of the timber that was rapidly burning out.

1788
02:51:09,583 --> 02:51:12,836
It came again.
Everyone heard it.

1789
02:51:13,003 --> 02:51:15,088
Grace was the first to recognize it.

1790
02:51:15,088 --> 02:51:16,465
That's Moses,

1791
02:51:16,799 --> 02:51:19,885
That's Moses, she said,
and jumped out of the car.

1792
02:51:20,677 --> 02:51:27,768
She quickly covered the distance to the dog pen
over what, now the buildings were gone,
could scarcely be
called a street,

1793
02:51:27,768 --> 02:51:32,898
and certainly not Elm Street as there wasn't
a tree left on Dogville's little mountain ledge,

1794
02:51:32,981 --> 02:51:34,650
let alone an elm.

1795
02:51:34,983 --> 02:51:36,860
It was Moses.

1796
02:51:36,902 --> 02:51:40,322
His survival was astonishing.
A miracle.

1797
02:51:41,573 --> 02:51:44,827
No, just let him be.

1798
02:51:45,494 --> 02:51:48,622
They will have spotted the flames
in Georgetown by now.

1799
02:51:49,498 --> 02:51:51,750
Some one'll come and find him.

1800
02:51:56,755 --> 02:52:00,259
He's just angry
because I once took his bone.

1801
02:52:10,894 --> 02:52:17,317
Whether Grace left Dogville or on the contrary,
Dogville had left her (and the world in general)

1802
02:52:17,359 --> 02:52:22,656
is a question of a more artful nature
that few would benefit from by asking

1803
02:52:22,781 --> 02:52:25,617
and even fewer by providing an answer.

1804
02:52:25,742 --> 02:52:28,996
And nor indeed will it be answered here!
