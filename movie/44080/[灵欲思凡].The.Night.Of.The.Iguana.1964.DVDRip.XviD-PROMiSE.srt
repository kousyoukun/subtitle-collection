1
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,199
Let the words of my mouth,
and the meditation of my heart...

2
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:28,301
...be always acceptable in thy sight.

3
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,837
O Lord, my strength...

4
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,066
...and my redeemer.

5
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,716
The sermon for today...

6
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:45,251
...is taken from Proverbs.

7
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,950
Chapter 25...

8
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:50,115
...verse 28.

9
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:53,896
"He that hath no rule over his own spirit...

10
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:58,727
...is like a city that is broken down,
and without walls."

11
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:03,735
And I wonder as we examine our hearts
together in this place set aside for worship...

12
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:09,008
...how many of us here can say,
"I rule my own spirit."

13
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,740
For how weak is man.

14
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,679
How often do we...

15
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,352
How often...

16
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:22,224
How often do we stray from
the straight and narrow.

17
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:26,821
For only when we abide in the Lord
are we like cities without walls.

18
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:30,329
Only then can we defend ourselves
against Satan and his temptations.

19
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,361
We cannot rule ourselves alone.

20
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,934
God only is our... Is our...

21
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,139
God only is our help.

22
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,570
And our salvation.

23
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,442
All right! You know!

24
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,915
That's why you're here!
To see this city with its broken walls!

25
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,284
"Whenever two or three
are gathered in my name"...

26
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,790
...is what scripture says.
That's not why you're here.

27
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:01,555
Let's change the words. Let's rewrite
the order of the Morning Prayer.

28
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:05,690
Whenever two or three or 20 or 30
or 200 or 300...

29
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,303
...are gathered together
to make whispered comment...

30
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:12,771
...to sit in judgment upon
the condition of a... Of a what?

31
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,534
Yes, of a man of God.

32
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:18,441
I said, man of God, and I mean it!

33
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:22,717
Just what you all know, that your pastor,
your spiritual shepherd is...

34
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:28,153
Is the descendant of a clergyman,
the grandson of two bishops.

35
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:32,158
But there were collateral branches to the
family that went forth to brave dangers...

36
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:33,852
...and who were scalped.

37
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,797
Men with men's hearts,
the wild and free hearts of men!

38
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:41,901
They knew hunger
and they fed their appetites.

39
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:46,940
They fed their appetites.
Appetites that I have inherited.

40
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,178
I defy you! Shannon defies you!

41
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:54,805
Get out your tomahawks!
Get out your scalping knives!

42
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,181
Sharpen your scalping knives! Scalp me!

43
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:03,587
I will not and cannot continue to conduct
services in praise and worship of this...

44
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,752
...angry, petulant old man
in whom you believe.

45
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,127
You've turned your backs on the God
of love and compassion...

46
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,701
...and invented for yourself
this cruel, senile delinquent...

47
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,432
...who blames the world and all that
he created for his own faults.

48
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,670
Close your windows! Close your doors!

49
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:25,143
Close your hearts
against the truth about God!

50
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,153
Hello there.

51
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:26,131
- Where are they?
- Still inside the church.

52
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,293
I'm sick of dark old churches.

53
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,530
I like sunshine.

54
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:37,240
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting what
you were. I mean, what you are.

55
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:38,744
What?

56
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,282
Lovely, isn't it?

57
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,684
- Yeah.
- What do you call it again?

58
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,650
"Cup of gold."
Could you drink from it, really?

59
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:56,621
Champagne for two in <i>copa de oro</i>.

60
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:05,402
- Dr. Shannon.
- Miss Fellowes. Here you are, Miss Peebles.

61
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:09,676
The same brand even.
Fix you up in no time.

62
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,873
- Oh, I am grateful. How much do I owe you?
- Six pesos-fifty.

63
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,281
But it was only six pesos
in Ciudad Juárez.

64
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:21,787
- I have it written down right here.
- It doesn't matter, Judith, really, it doesn't.

65
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,394
Ciudad Juárez is 1200 miles behind us,
Miss Fellowes.

66
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:28,792
I thought it was too far to go
to save 4 cents.

67
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,609
- Are we downhearted?
- No.

68
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,012
Fantastic!

69
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,966
Did you see that?

70
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,403
Look. There's another.

71
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,545
What have those boys got, Dr. Shannon?

72
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:53,239
Iguanas. Giant lizards native
to this part of Mexico.

73
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,283
It is alleged they taste like chicken.

74
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:02,084
You mean they really
eat those awful-looking creatures?

75
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,185
- Hank, stop on the bridge.
- Stop?

76
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,694
Yeah, on the bridge.

77
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,654
What are we stopping for?

78
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,817
A moment of beauty, Miss Fellowes.

79
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:42,322
A fleeting glimpse
into the lost world...

80
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,329
...of innocence.

81
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:54,967
Look, Reverend,
we're behind schedule now.

82
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:57,245
Drive on, driver.

83
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:00,174
Okay.

84
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:05,609
My brother in Abilene,
that's Clarence Throxton...

85
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:08,723
...has a chain of 23 laundromats.

86
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,691
He says all he wants
on his tombstone is:

87
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,730
"He liberated the women of Texas
from the bondage of wash day."

88
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,662
Aren't they unbelievable?

89
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:22,998
Squawk, squawk, squawk,
ever since we started.

90
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:27,165
If they want all the comforts of home,
then why don't they stay at home?

91
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:30,972
My goodness, this has been
a rich experience.

92
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,341
It sure has.

93
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:34,540
Everything's gone wrong
from the first day.

94
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:39,211
Every calamity in the book.
The whole trip has been hoodooed.

95
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:42,951
You better get back, Miss Goodall,
where you belong.

96
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,355
You said it was going to be Charlotte.

97
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,621
All right. Charlotte.

98
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:52,962
- And I can't go on calling you Dr. Shannon.
- Just "Shannon" will be fine.

99
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:57,304
Couldn't it be Larry,
if you're gonna call me Charlotte?

100
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,940
Honey, have a heart.

101
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,976
I have, Larry. I've just discovered.

102
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,875
Now you change places with me,
Charlotte, dear.

103
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:10,084
I want to talk to Dr. Shannon
about our itinerary.

104
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:15,522
I'll see you later, Larry.

105
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:24,023
I assume you know that Charlotte
is underaged, Dr. Shannon?

106
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,930
What's that got to do with our itinerary?

107
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,697
If you know what's good for you,
leave her alone.

108
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:33,069
Miss Fellowes, are you aware you are
speaking to an ordained clergyman?

109
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:35,005
Stop leading her on.

110
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:39,011
I don't know what happened back
in Tierra Caliente and I don't want to know.

111
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,240
Because if I did know,
I'd have to take steps.

112
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,317
Don't make me take steps,
Dr. Shannon.

113
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,886
Now, nothing happened
back in Tierra Caliente.

114
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:50,389
The room clerk got our keys mixed up,
that's all. A mistake, pure and simple.

115
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,494
Whatever suspicions you may be harboring
are quite groundless.

116
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:55,857
I can assure you of that.

117
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,798
Just leave her alone.
Don't make me take steps.

118
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:04,101
All right, girls, ready for another song?

119
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:51,513
These pills aren't doing anything for me.
Not anything!

120
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,398
- Puncture.
- Blowout.

121
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,796
Burned-out brake linings.

122
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:07,993
Broken fan belt, three flat tires.

123
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,934
These are the unavoidable mishaps
of any trip, Miss Fellowes.

124
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:13,404
Won't take more than a few moments
to change wheels.

125
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:16,201
Says you, reverend.
We're fresh out of wheels to change.

126
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,836
We gotta get that tire off and put on
a patch. Take maybe half an hour.

127
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:22,142
You take care of it for me, Hank.

128
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,677
Judith!

129
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:29,052
- I need you!
- Oh, all right, Peebie.

130
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,116
It's lovely, isn't it?

131
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,418
Yeah.

132
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:01,320
Are you really a man of the cloth, Larry?

133
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,982
- Who says I'm not?
- No one. I just wondered.

134
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,855
How can you ask such a question?

135
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,294
Doesn't Blake's Tours advertise tours
personally conducted by the...

136
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,696
...Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon?

137
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,666
Could they make such a claim
without justification?

138
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,738
I'm so glad you are.

139
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,772
What do you mean by that?

140
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:23,303
Well, it's such a noble life.

141
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:26,937
I mean, being interested in people's souls
and all that.

142
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,780
You can bring so much to people.

143
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,783
Someone like me even.

144
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,184
I can talk to you.

145
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:38,486
Like, I'd never dream of going swimming
with Reverend Hotchkiss back home.

146
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:39,992
I mean, he's old.

147
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,528
Now, lie down on the back seat, Peebie.
Put your feet up.

148
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:51,537
- Driver, have you seen Miss Goodall?
- Yeah, I've seen her.

149
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:54,039
Well? Well, where is she?

150
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,076
He's got her. Out there.

151
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,454
Charlotte.

152
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:14,626
Charlotte.

153
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:16,992
Charlotte.

154
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,857
Charlotte.

155
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:21,500
- There was this boy back home.
- Charlotte.

156
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,433
He thought he was in love with me.

157
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:27,201
- Really, he made life just impossible.
- Charlotte.

158
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,844
So Daddy fixed it for me to take a trip.

159
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,345
Naturally, he wanted me to be
chaperoned in a strange country.

160
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,949
- Charlotte!
- Life's so odd.

161
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:38,916
- Yeah.
- lf it hadn't been for that silly boy...

162
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,352
...I might never have met you.

163
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,686
- Charlotte!
- Take my hand, Larry.

164
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,088
What for?

165
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:48,354
So we don't drift apart.

166
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:53,262
Charlotte, I command you
to come back here.

167
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,299
Charlotte Goodall.

168
00:15:57,806 --> 00:16:00,070
You only got to come on this trip
because of me!

169
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:04,735
Charlotte. Charlotte, you hear me?

170
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:09,809
Charlotte, I know you can hear me.
You are deliberately defying me.

171
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:14,251
Charlotte!
Charlotte! You stay away from that man!

172
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,485
You hear?

173
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:19,851
Charlotte, your mother put you
in my charge.

174
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:22,759
I am responsible. Charlotte!

175
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,767
You only got to come on this trip
because of me!

176
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:30,034
Charlotte!

177
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:41,642
Why, Miss Fellowes.

178
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,284
Dreadful girl.

179
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:48,346
Defied me.
You deliberately defied me!

180
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,958
What did you think we were doing
out there, Miss Fellowes? Spawning?

181
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:56,962
Oh, you beast! You beast!

182
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,532
You beast.

183
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,855
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
You... You get out of here!

184
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,193
- My God, it's 3:00 in the morning.
- I've got to see you.

185
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:14,631
- It's important. My whole life's at stake.
- Oh, well, my job's at stake.

186
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:17,363
You don't have to worry
about this measly old job.

187
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:21,168
My goodness. Back home, my daddy's
got three Ford agencies.

188
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:23,675
At the moment, I don't see a Ford
in my future.

189
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,245
Have you been drinking, Larry?

190
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,077
Honey girl, if I'd been drinking,
I wouldn't be here. I'd still be drinking.

191
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,220
Then what's wrong?
Why are you all hot and sweaty?

192
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:36,483
You won't misunderstand me, I mean,
my being here in your room.

193
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,285
Promise me you won't think...

194
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,420
That boy back home told me
that I had skin that no girl had any right to.

195
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,528
Said it should be licensed to have skin
as soft as mine is.

196
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:49,227
- Wasn't it silly of him?
- No.

197
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:51,599
Yes. I mean, no, no.
No, it should be licensed.

198
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,209
I mean, at least until you're...
Until you're old enough...

199
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:59,404
...for a driver's license. Now, you get out
of my room. You get off my bed.

200
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:03,608
I'll... I'll keep my eyes
shut until you've gone out of my room.

201
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,787
- Have I grown up too early, Larry?
- Yes. No, I mean... Yes, yes.

202
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,254
O Lord, lead me not into temptation.

203
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:14,225
And now, go on home.
I'll find my way all by myself.

204
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:17,263
- That's what I came to tell you.
- What?

205
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:18,899
I'm going home.

206
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,467
Tomorrow, from Puerto Vallarta.

207
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,265
I'm catching the plane at Puerto Vallarta.

208
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:29,376
I'll slip away from that possessive old bitch
while she's having her siesta...

209
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,705
...and be gone before she knows it.

210
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,609
You mustn't tell her where I've gone.

211
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,579
Let her sweat it a little.

212
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:39,243
Let her think
I've just disappeared into the jungle.

213
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:41,252
But I couldn't let you worry.

214
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:43,482
I had to say goodbye to you...

215
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,718
...or rather, <i>au revoir.</i>

216
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:48,727
Because when you bring them back...

217
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:51,195
...l'll be there waiting for you...

218
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:55,200
<i>... copa de oro</i> in my hair,
just over the border.

219
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,862
Honey, the border I'm crossing over
is the border of sanity, honey.

220
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,009
- No.
- Oh, honey, yes.

221
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,803
I've got it figured out, darling.

222
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,412
What you should have is a nice big church
in Thunderbird Heights...

223
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:07,980
Daddy's a big wheel there.

224
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,278
- and a wife who understands
the nobility of your mission.

225
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:15,355
- No, no.
- Yes, not no. I'll fix it. Daddy will fix it.

226
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,287
- No.
- Yes.

227
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:19,859
"He that hath no rule
over his own spirit is like a...

228
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,121
...city that has broken down
and without walls."

229
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:24,026
I'll rule your spirit.

230
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,427
I'll hold you.

231
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,127
- No. No, no. No.
- Yes. Yes, yes.

232
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,309
Charlotte.

233
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:48,079
Charlotte...

234
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,154
...l've told you how sorry I am.

235
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,420
You can afford to be generous.

236
00:21:56,431 --> 00:22:00,458
I was just beside myself with anger.

237
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:05,497
But I never meant to harm you.

238
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:10,678
I wouldn't harm you for all the world.

239
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,272
Charlotte.

240
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:21,189
Charlotte, you've got to forgive me.
I can't stand being so unhappy.

241
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:30,126
Shannon?

242
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:31,965
Shannon, open the door.

243
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,658
You hear me, Shannon.

244
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:36,497
You've got that child in there.
Open up right now.

245
00:22:36,738 --> 00:22:39,901
I've had it. She'll tell my father,
she'll tell everybody.

246
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,076
He's got her in there with him.
The door's locked.

247
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,311
Nobody's mixed any keys up this time.
I won't have it. I just won't have it.

248
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,457
You're through, Shannon.

249
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,856
And I'll see to that.

250
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:04,260
When I finish with you,
there won't be any place left to hide.

251
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:07,834
It's all right, Miss Fellowes.
Virtue is triumphant. Yours, of course.

252
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:11,495
Wait. Just you wait.

253
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:42,299
Good morning. We have a wonderful
trip ahead of us.

254
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:45,031
Some of the most beautiful
scenery in this part of Mexico.

255
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:48,176
I took the liberty of getting souvenirs
of our stay in Los Feliz.

256
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,901
I love you.

257
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,207
No charge. Compliments of the
Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon.

258
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,916
Miss Peebles.

259
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:12,527
Where's Miss Fellowes?

260
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,966
You think you could pull a stunt
like last night and get away with it?

261
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:18,197
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's in the fan.

262
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,934
This morning,
she had a wire all written out...

263
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:23,373
...to some Judge Fellowes back in Texas.

264
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,309
She wants your life story
from the first time you said "Mama."

265
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:29,279
- How do you know that?
- She asked me to send it, that's how.

266
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:32,386
I told her that was no part
of no driver's job.

267
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,785
- Good man, Hank.
- You ain't off the hook.

268
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:39,154
Miss Fellowes went over
to <i>Telegráfico</i> herself.

269
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,460
She aims to have your hide, Reverend.

270
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:48,694
Good morning, Miss Fellowes.

271
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,081
I'll... I'll drive.

272
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:20,232
We're there, Peebie, your troubles are over.
Now you can have a nice bath.

273
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:24,264
"The Ambos Mundos Hotel
in Puerto Vallarta...

274
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:28,273
...is a completely modern,
air-conditioned hotel...

275
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:32,770
...on a delightful plaza,
with excellent food and service."

276
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,318
Shannon? Shannon, that's our hotel.

277
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,024
Shannon. Stop.

278
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:57,763
Stop this instant.
Shannon. Shannon!

279
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:19,093
What the hell you trying to do, Reverend?
Get us all killed?

280
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:53,326
- You gone crazy or something?
- This is not the Ambos Mundos.

281
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:57,192
It says in the brochure we stop in Ambos
Mundos, in the heart of Puerto Vallarta.

282
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:01,801
Here we are, ladies, this is Mismaloya,
the garden spot of the West Coast.

283
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,995
You'll be grateful to me to your dying days.

284
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,970
In all of Mexico,
there's nothing to equal this.

285
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:10,669
The chef is a Chinese, specially
imported from Shanghai by me.

286
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:14,372
Just leave your bags.
The staff will take care of everything.

287
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,753
Take us right back
to Puerto Vallarta where we belong.

288
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,650
I'm expecting an important telegram.

289
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,586
- I can't take you no place.
- Why not?

290
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:26,522
Because Reverend's taken the
distributor head, that's why not.

291
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:28,458
Shannon.

292
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,564
Shannon, you won't get away with this!

293
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,771
Fred?

294
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:42,799
Fred?

295
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,451
Shannon.

296
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:56,788
What the hell are you doing
down here out of season?

297
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,620
Would you have one of your boys
lug this bag up for me?

298
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:02,018
Pepe.

299
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,265
Fred, where are you?

300
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,028
Fred can't hear you, baby.

301
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:12,173
Why? Gone fishing?

302
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,864
How long have you been off it?

303
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,907
- Off what?
- The wagon.

304
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:17,510
I'm not drunk.

305
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,979
- Oh, what's the matter with you then?
- Fever, just fever.

306
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,812
- Where's Fred?
- Dead.

307
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:30,183
- Did you say dead?
- That's what I said. Fred's dead.

308
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:33,894
How? When?

309
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:35,996
Oh, less than four weeks ago.

310
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:41,159
Died with his boots on, though. Hooked
into a big marlin, the marlin won.

311
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:44,999
I was counting on Fred to bail me out,
straighten me out and bail me out.

312
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:48,199
He was my hope of salvation.
I had all my chips on Fred.

313
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:51,812
- Baby, you're going to pieces, aren't you?
- Yeah, yeah. They...

314
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,572
They are tearing me to pieces.

315
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:56,717
I was hanging on until I could get
to the hammock on the veranda...

316
00:28:56,885 --> 00:29:00,446
...over the rainforest and still-water beach.
It's all that can pull me through.

317
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:03,455
Honey, just lie down the hammock.
I'll fix you a nice rum-coco.

318
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,719
No, no, no. If I start drinking
rum-cocos now, I'll never stop.

319
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:10,921
Reverend!
They want us to go back into town.

320
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:15,033
Well, tell them they can't go
back into town.

321
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,668
I thought Fred could tame them.

322
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,605
He was a fisherman, and I've got
a busload of man-eating sharks.

323
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,707
- I've gotta get those women up here.
- No, you don't.

324
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,338
We're closed in August.
We're always closed in August.

325
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,008
Quit blowing, and blow!

326
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:36,120
Maxine. Maxine, you gotta help me.

327
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:40,759
- Honey, you're really gone.
- Maxine, I can't lose this party.

328
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,365
Blake's Tours have put me on probation
because I had a bad party last month.

329
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,228
They tried to get me fired,
so now I'm on probation.

330
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:51,338
If I lose this party, I'll be fired for sure.
And what's next, Maxine?

331
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:54,031
There's nothing,
nothing lower than Blake's Tours.

332
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,144
Okay, okay, baby.
If it's that important to you...

333
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,047
...they can stay here.

334
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:04,007
Here comes your sidekick now.

335
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:06,278
His name's Hank. Hank.

336
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:08,479
- You gotta help me with him.
- Sure.

337
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:10,954
- I'll give him complimentary rum-coco.
- No, no, no.

338
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,093
Not until he's got the bus unloaded.

339
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:17,197
You ain't getting away with it.
Some of the ladies are in bad shape.

340
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:20,061
They'll walk back if you don't give me
that distributor head.

341
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:24,171
They'll drop like flies from sunstroke
in this heat. Hank, I need your cooperation.

342
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:29,439
This is a test of strength, Hank,
between two men and a crate of wet hens.

343
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,136
You know that, don't you?
I know what I'm doing, Hank.

344
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:33,473
Don't you forget that.

345
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:36,708
Now, the bell cow sent a telegram from
Los Feliz this morning, right?

346
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:39,683
That answer will come to their hotel
in Puerto Vallarta, right?

347
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,516
But if we're not there,
no answer can be delivered, right?

348
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,988
Lizzie Borden won't get to wield her ax.

349
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:49,596
That's why I brought them up here. Working
every minute. Now, all I need is a little time.

350
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,858
To reestablish myself in the esteem...

351
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:55,594
...of those old...
The good ladies of our party.

352
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,604
By this time tomorrow, they'll
be eating out of the palm of my hand.

353
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:04,268
Of that, you have the assurance
of the Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon.

354
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:07,279
What assurance you give
the kid you been leading on?

355
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,042
Leading on? Hank, if you are
to succeed in this business...

356
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:14,154
...you must give factual reports without
exaggeration. That's a definite exaggeration.

357
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:17,587
I've exercised every ingenuity
of which a man is capable...

358
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,251
...to keep at bay the advances
of this precocious jezebel.

359
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,458
That's a hell of a way to talk about
an innocent young girl.

360
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:28,224
You sure weren't doing no avoiding
when you got her up in your pad last night.

361
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:29,893
Ha-ha, very funny.

362
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:33,131
Without no exaggeration,
whatever happens to Reverend ain't enough.

363
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,674
Avoiding her? She laid it
on the line down there...

364
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:37,674
...why you shanghaied us up here.
- Hank...

365
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,938
I heard your story.
But that ain't her story.

366
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:43,747
She said that she planned
to take the plane from Puerto Vallarta...

367
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:46,751
...and you couldn't stand for it
to see her go.

368
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:50,556
Fantastic. That's fantastic.

369
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,556
Mrs. Faulk, honey...

370
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:56,390
...give him a menu. Give him one of your
sample menus to show the ladies.

371
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:59,294
One of your fantastic sample menus.

372
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:01,765
There you are, thank you.
There you are, Hank.

373
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:05,929
Now you go back down there and show
this fantastic sample menu to the ladies.

374
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:09,838
Describe the view from the hill,
the palatial appointments of the hotel...

375
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,410
...anything you like.

376
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,308
You get them up here, Hank.

377
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:19,348
A fine, upstanding young man.

378
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,286
So you appropriated the young chick
and the old hens are squawking, huh?

379
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,086
It's very serious. The child
is emotionally precocious.

380
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,956
- Bully for her.
- Also, she is traveling under the wing...

381
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,065
...of a military escort
of a butch vocal teacher.

382
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:36,662
I wonder how long it takes to sweat
the faculty of a Baptist Female College...

383
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:41,036
...out of a bus that's parked in the sun
when it's a 100 degrees in the shade.

384
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:43,539
- Well, they're staggering out of it now.
- They are?

385
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,908
I've won this round, I reckon.
Good old Hank.

386
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,709
Good old Hank better take cover.

387
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:59,454
Look at her, charging like
a bull elephant on a rampage.

388
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:01,891
Maxine, you gotta
help me with her, honey.

389
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,396
She's not only trying to get me fired,
she's also trying to pin on me...

390
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,727
...a rape charge,
a charge of statutory rape.

391
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,166
Statutory rape?
I've never known what that was.

392
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:14,866
That's when a man's seduced by a girl
under 20. That's not funny, Maxine.

393
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,473
Why do you always want
the young ones, honey?

394
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:21,206
I don't want any,
any, regardless of age.

395
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:23,850
Why do you take them, Shannon?
Huh, Shannon?

396
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:27,818
- Well, people need human contact, Maxine.
- Shannon!

397
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,217
Shannon! You're a fake.

398
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,120
Come on up, Miss Fellowes.
Everything's fixed.

399
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,651
Never do that, Miss Fellowes.

400
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:38,026
Not at high noon in a tropical country
in summer. Never charge uphill...

401
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:41,600
...like you're leading a troop of cavalry
attacking an impregnable position.

402
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,932
I don't want advice or instructions.
I want that distributor head.

403
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,374
This is one of the charming ladies of whom
I was speaking. Mrs. Faulk, Miss Fellowes.

404
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:52,069
- Hello.
- Is this man making a deal with you?

405
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:55,238
- What sort of deal?
- Is this man getting a kickback from you?

406
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:58,041
Look, honey,
nobody gets a kickback out of me.

407
00:33:58,352 --> 00:34:00,718
- I turn away more people...
- Have you got a telephone?

408
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,555
- Sure.
- I wanna make a call to Texas.

409
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:07,419
- Collect, of course.
- Right in the office there.

410
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,391
When the hell did you get
a telephone in here?

411
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:15,661
Old Fred, he finally got the telephone
company to run a wire up here.

412
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:18,772
Well, you get in there,
and find out who she's talking to.

413
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,808
And don't let her get through to
Blake's Tours. She's trying to get me fired.

414
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,537
We're almost there, Peebie.
Just a little further.

415
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:28,910
Miss Peebles, I am delighted.

416
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,308
I knew common sense would prevail.

417
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,216
You'll be enchanted with Mismaloya.
Look at this view.

418
00:34:34,388 --> 00:34:37,016
We're not here out of choice,
we're here out of necessity.

419
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,455
- Miss Peebles is ill. She requires a...
- A bathroom.

420
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:42,619
A bathroom, a bathroom.
Hank, get the luggage out of the bus.

421
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:45,027
Help yourselves, ladies.
Bungalows are all yours.

422
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,963
Here you are, Miss Peebles,
to comfort and privacy.

423
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:50,195
- Peebie,
- We couldn't help it, Judith, Peebie...

424
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:53,829
Just a temporary indisposition.
Mrs. Faulk is looking after her personally.

425
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,441
That's the service you get here.

426
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,910
Now you and Charlotte,
Miss Goodall, can share this one.

427
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:02,208
I want a room of my own.

428
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:05,648
That's perfectly all right with me.
She can have a room of her own.

429
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,813
I no longer assume any responsibility
for her actions. She's a free agent.

430
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:12,687
Until we get back to civilization.

431
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,859
Hank.

432
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,395
Let me have Miss Fellowes' bag.

433
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,624
Thank you.

434
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,925
This way, Miss Fellowes.

435
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:24,333
Miss Fellowes, did you get
your call through?

436
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,302
Circuits were busy,
they'll call me back.

437
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:29,204
Miss Fellowes, please,
please give me a minute.

438
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,969
Well? Well, what is it?

439
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:33,079
Well, it's just that like...

440
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:35,579
Like everybody else
at some time or other in life...

441
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,547
...my life has cracked up on me.

442
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,811
How does that compensate us?

443
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:43,286
Miss Fellowes, I've just confessed
to you that I'm at the end of my rope.

444
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:46,392
Please, Miss Fellowes, don't make me
feel that any human being...

445
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,587
...would put personal compensation
before the ugly bare fact...

446
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:53,131
...of a man who's at the end of his rope,
but who still has to try to go on.

447
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:56,168
Now you listen to me.
We girls have worked and slaved...

448
00:35:56,337 --> 00:36:00,171
...all year at Baptist Female College for
this Mexican tour, and the tour is a cheat.

449
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:01,569
Fantastic.

450
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,006
For days we've been holed
in that stifling bus...

451
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:05,873
...over the byways, off the highways.

452
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:08,675
Shook up and bumped up
so you could get your rake off.

453
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,841
All of the girls in this party
have dysentery.

454
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:14,078
That you cannot blame me for.
I passed out mimeographed instructions:

455
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,088
What to eat, what not to eat,
what to drink, what not to drink.

456
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,726
It's not what, but where
we ate that gave us dysentery.

457
00:36:19,894 --> 00:36:22,192
It's not dysentery, not
even amoebic. It's nothing...

458
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:23,853
It's Montezuma's revenge.

459
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,362
That's what we call it down here:
Aztec two-step.

460
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:31,699
Do you? Well, I intend to have
my revenge, Dr. Shannon.

461
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:36,243
Honey, I don't think even old Fred
could have calmed her down.

462
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,105
You go lie down.

463
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:14,840
- Okay, Shannon.
- What you gonna do?

464
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,682
Did you ever have a shave
by a lady barber?

465
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:20,116
I can shave myself, Maxine.

466
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:23,884
With those shakes?
How long you had them, Shannon?

467
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:28,290
They've been incubating ever since the trip
started. It's been a nightmare all the way.

468
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:32,728
Culminating with the Witch of Endor
threatening to hound me to the grave.

469
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,266
That's when blind panic took over.

470
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:37,233
That's when the spook moved in.

471
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:40,203
Is that all your spook is, honey?
Just panic?

472
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:44,640
Maxine, don't say "just panic"
like you'd say "just leprosy."

473
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,642
Panic's serious.

474
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:49,874
Who'd Madame Lafarge
put that phone call to?

475
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:52,144
- Some judge in Corpus Christi.
- I knew it.

476
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,345
- Where you going?
- To tear that phone out...

477
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,387
In a pig's eye!

478
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:59,720
That phone cost me 1200 pesos
to get in here.

479
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:02,692
You just lie back, baby,
and when I get you all prettied up...

480
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,990
...l'll go and cancel that call.

481
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,264
I see you got your gold cross on.

482
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,272
Thinking about going back to the church?

483
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:19,709
I wrote my old bishop last night,
a letter of complete capitulation.

484
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,848
How come you don't quit
kidding yourself?

485
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:25,076
You ain't thinking about going back
to no church...

486
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:28,744
...or you wouldn't be so scared of losing
this cotton-picking job of yours.

487
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,256
You know, folks don't go to church
to hear atheistical sermons being preached.

488
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:36,919
Damn it to hell. I never preached an atheist
sermon in church in all my life.

489
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:39,658
All right, baby, all right.

490
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,695
What size shoe you wear, baby?

491
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,471
I do not get the point of that question.

492
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,834
Well, these shoes look shot to me.

493
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,500
If I remember correctly
you only travel with one pair.

494
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:53,613
Now, old Fred's estate includes
one good pair of shoes.

495
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,610
And your feet look about the same size.

496
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:59,082
I loved old Fred, Maxine,
but I do not want to fill his shoes.

497
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,954
You could do worse, baby.

498
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,224
You could do worse.

499
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:17,361
Which way is the sea?

500
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:21,372
It's right down there, but we can't see it
because of the trees.

501
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:24,010
I can feel it and smell it.

502
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:26,442
It's the cradle of life.

503
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:03,444
Are these two with your party?

504
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:06,310
They look like a couple of loonies.

505
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:10,050
Life began in the sea.

506
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:13,422
Oh! Oh, how do you do?

507
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:15,661
Hello.

508
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,859
Have you ever tried helping a gentleman...

509
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,935
...who can't walk,
uphill through a rain forest?

510
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,337
No. I wouldn't even try it downhill.

511
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:28,366
Anything I can do for you folks?

512
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:31,511
Well, now that we've made it,
I don't regret the effort.

513
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,806
What a view for a painter!

514
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:37,815
They told me in the town
this was the ideal place for a painter.

515
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:40,146
And they weren't exaggerating.

516
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:43,314
Anything I can do for you?

517
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:46,585
Yes, yes, I'm looking for
the manager of the hotel.

518
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,557
Oh, that's me. Speaking.

519
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:52,722
You're the manager. Oh, good.
I'm Hannah Jelkes. How do you do?

520
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,425
- Mrs...?
- Faulk. Maxine Faulk.

521
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:57,093
You're looking for rooms?

522
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:59,899
Yes, yes, we are, but we've come
without reservations.

523
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:03,407
Well, honey, we're closed in August,
except for a few special guests.

524
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:06,239
Well, look at them.
If they're not special, who the hell is?

525
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:08,973
Honey, that old man ought to be
in a hospital.

526
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,347
No. Oh, no, no, he just sprained
his ankle a little this morning.

527
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,924
Come on, Grandpa. Two steps,
one, two. There you are.

528
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:22,188
Hannah, tell the lady
that my frailty is temporary.

529
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:25,196
I will soon be able to crawl
and then to toddle.

530
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:28,961
And before long I'll be leaping
around here like an old mountain goat.

531
00:41:29,136 --> 00:41:31,696
Yes, yes, Grandfather, I explained that.

532
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:37,242
Tell the lady that I know some hotels
don't want to take dogs, cats or monkeys.

533
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:42,178
And some don't even solicit the patronage
of infants in their late 90s.

534
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:43,782
But assure her...

535
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:47,717
...that if she'll forgive my
disgraceful longevity...

536
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:50,914
...and this temporary decrepitude...

537
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:55,687
...I will present her with the last signed
copy of my first volume of verse.

538
00:41:55,863 --> 00:41:58,696
Published in... When, Hannah?

539
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:02,632
The day that President William McKinley
was assassinated, Nonno.

540
00:42:02,803 --> 00:42:05,772
My grandfather is the poet
Jonathan Coffin.

541
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,931
He is 97 years young.

542
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,042
And he will be 98 years young...

543
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:13,703
...on the 5th of October.
- Old folks are remarkable.

544
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,678
Hey, the phone!
Did you cancel that call?

545
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:17,783
When the hell did I have time?

546
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,943
Did I talk too much?

547
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,020
Have I been talking too much again?

548
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:24,387
I'm afraid that he has.

549
00:42:24,558 --> 00:42:26,287
I don't think she's going to take us.

550
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,554
Her eyes said "no"
in big blue capital letters.

551
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,790
Oh, I shouldn't worry about that.
She'll take you in, all right.

552
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:36,494
The Judge Truman Fellowes
on the telephone.

553
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,036
Must be old butch's brother.
Wouldn't have a husband.

554
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:41,504
Anyway, I said she'd checked out,
canceled the call.

555
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:44,269
Maxine, you're larger than life.

556
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:48,074
Shall we register now?

557
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:50,445
You can register
any time you want.

558
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:52,950
But I gotta collect 6 dollars
from you right now...

559
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,815
...if you want your name in the pot.

560
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:56,522
Six dollars.

561
00:42:57,691 --> 00:43:00,125
Three dollars each.
You see, out of season like this...

562
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:02,558
...we operate on the modified
American plan.

563
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,756
Oh, I see. Yes, well...

564
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:08,993
...we usually operate on a
special basis ourselves.

565
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:11,003
What do you mean, operate?

566
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:14,172
Here is our card.

567
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:16,068
I think you may have heard of us.

568
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:17,835
We've had quite a few write-ups.

569
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:21,373
My grandfather is the oldest living
and practicing poet.

570
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:23,778
And he gives recitations.

571
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:27,546
I paint watercolors
and I'm a quick sketch artist.

572
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:30,656
We travel together
and we pay our way as we go...

573
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:32,519
...by my grandfather's recitations...

574
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,823
...and by the sale of quick character
sketches in charcoal and pastel.

575
00:43:38,098 --> 00:43:41,693
I usually pass among the tables
during lunch and dinner, slowly.

576
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,099
I wear an artist's smock...

577
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,637
...picturesquely dabbed with paint.

578
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:50,436
I don't push myself on people.
I just display my work.

579
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:53,842
And I smile sweetly at them,
and if invited to do so...

580
00:43:54,014 --> 00:43:56,608
...I sit down and make
a quick character sketch.

581
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,376
And Gramps?

582
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:02,185
I introduce him as the world's oldest
living and practicing poet.

583
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:05,549
If invited, he gives a recitation
of one of his poems.

584
00:44:06,093 --> 00:44:09,187
Of course, they were all written
a very long time ago...

585
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:11,593
...but do you know
he has started a new poem?

586
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:15,730
For the first time in 20 years
he has started another poem.

587
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,268
Hasn't finished it yet.

588
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:22,705
He still has his inspiration but his power
of concentration has weakened a little.

589
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:26,639
Right now, Gramps
ain't concentrating at all.

590
00:44:26,814 --> 00:44:28,941
He's just catching forty winks.

591
00:44:29,783 --> 00:44:31,182
Gramps.

592
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:33,113
Gramps.

593
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:35,081
Time to hit the sack, Gramps.

594
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,849
- Now, you just wait a minute.
- Please.

595
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:40,892
We've tried every hotel
in Puerto Vallarta.

596
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:42,995
They wouldn't take us.

597
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:46,394
I'm afraid I have to place myself
at your mercy.

598
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:50,227
Okay. Looks like you're in
for one night, but just one.

599
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:52,702
- Thank you.
- Where's your luggage?

600
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,100
No luggage?

601
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:58,870
I hid it behind some palmettos at the foot
of the path with Grandfather's wheelchair.

602
00:44:59,046 --> 00:45:00,308
Pepe.

603
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:06,749
They're chasing an iguana.

604
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:11,554
What will they do with it?

605
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:14,956
Tie him up, fatten him up
and eat him up.

606
00:45:26,073 --> 00:45:27,665
Pepe.

607
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:36,509
Okay, honey. You and Gramps
can have bungalow nine.

608
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:39,174
How's Gramps gonna get meals?
Let them have that suite.

609
00:45:39,353 --> 00:45:41,480
Wait a minute, Shannon,
that's the deluxe suite.

610
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:45,113
I know, Maxine, generosity
is the cornerstone of your nature.

611
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:47,317
Come on, Gramps.
Time to move.

612
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,756
That's it.

613
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:51,363
Did someone call for a recitation?

614
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:54,831
No, Nonno,
we're just going to our rooms.

615
00:45:56,904 --> 00:45:59,498
I'm dreadfully afraid
my grandfather had a slight stroke...

616
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,607
...in those high passes
through the Sierras.

617
00:46:01,775 --> 00:46:05,575
Old people have them. They're not regular
strokes, just little cerebral incidents.

618
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:09,648
Symptoms clear up so quickly, sometimes
old people don't realize they've had them.

619
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:20,456
Just rest for a few moments, Nonno.

620
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:30,003
<i>How calmly does the olive branch</i>

621
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,833
<i>Observe the sky begin to blanch</i>

622
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:37,802
<i>Without a cry, without a prayer</i>

623
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:41,672
<i>With no betrayal of despair</i>

624
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:49,613
I'll leave Nonno in here
and I'll take that room.

625
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,953
That's the one with the leaky roof,
but you won't find out about it...

626
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:56,823
...until it rains, and then it'll be too late
to do anything except swim out if it.

627
00:46:56,997 --> 00:47:00,228
- Oh, no, Mr...?
- Shannon, the Reverend T. Lawrence.

628
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,836
Mr. Shannon,
I'll find a dry spot if it rains.

629
00:47:04,004 --> 00:47:05,471
How many...?

630
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,630
How many times have you
been around the world?

631
00:47:07,808 --> 00:47:10,140
As many times as the world
has been around the sun.

632
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:13,609
And I feel as if I've gone
the whole way on foot.

633
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:15,781
Thank you, Mr. Shannon.

634
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:51,644
Operator.

635
00:47:52,386 --> 00:47:55,048
Operator, <i>aqui parlar</i> English<i>?</i>

636
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:58,919
- <i>Si, senora. Can I help you?</i>
- This is Miss Fellowes at Mismaloya.

637
00:47:59,092 --> 00:48:01,560
- <i>Si, senora.</i>
- What happened to my call to Texas?

638
00:48:01,728 --> 00:48:03,787
- <i>Where in Texas?</i>
- Corpus Christi.

639
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,159
- <i>I thought you'd checked out.</i>
- Checked out?

640
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:09,234
How could I check out?
He's got the distributor...

641
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:13,804
Operator, you put that
call through again...

642
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:18,274
...and I will hold the line
and wait if it takes all afternoon.

643
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,945
<i>Very well, senora.</i>

644
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:28,512
Seducer.

645
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,886
- What?
- Seducer.

646
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:36,362
- Now, what's the squawk now?
- Oh, Larry, why didn't you tell me?

647
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,861
Tell you what? What is this?

648
00:48:38,031 --> 00:48:41,398
- You've been exposed, Shannon.
- Your whole shameful past.

649
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:43,934
Posing as a minister of the gospel.

650
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:46,163
I am a minister. Anybody who says I'm not...

651
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,740
Honey, show them that gold cross,
that'll prove it.

652
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:53,073
You thought you outwitted me, didn't you,
having your paramour here cancel my call.

653
00:48:53,246 --> 00:48:56,579
Miss Fellowes, honey,
if paramour means what I think it does...

654
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,218
...you're gambling with your front teeth.

655
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:02,617
My brother has been in communication
with Blake's Tours.

656
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:05,690
They've assured him
that they will take action, drastic action.

657
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,952
Just what do you mean by that?

658
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:10,961
- I have a contract that provides...
- Your contract is worthless.

659
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,029
My brother is a judge.

660
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,761
And he has informed your employer
that they are not required to employ...

661
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:19,929
...a man who makes a career
of seducing young girls.

662
00:49:20,107 --> 00:49:23,235
"Seducing!"
Did you lead her to infer that...

663
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,469
Larry, how could you think that l...?

664
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:29,878
I said a career. All the way
from Pleasant Valley, Virginia...

665
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,076
...to that dreadful hotel
that you tricked us into last night.

666
00:49:33,253 --> 00:49:34,686
But that career is now ended.

667
00:49:34,988 --> 00:49:38,116
The Reverend Shannon, defrocked.

668
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,656
That's a lie. A base lie.

669
00:49:40,861 --> 00:49:44,422
I was never defrocked.
I was only locked out of my church.

670
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:46,560
Spreading a story like that is libel.

671
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,533
I could take legal action. And I will.
These ladies are my witnesses.

672
00:49:50,704 --> 00:49:53,138
Repeating a story like that will get you...

673
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:57,500
I'll show you. I'll show you all.

674
00:49:57,678 --> 00:50:00,169
You can't say that I was defrocked.

675
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:03,382
I'll show you. I'll show you.

676
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:10,222
Well, if you're not gonna eat him,
I guess I'd better see about some food.

677
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:19,493
What's this mess supposed to be?

678
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:20,997
Soup.

679
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:22,965
Well, it's burnt!

680
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:31,301
Chang...

681
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,839
...l've warned you before.

682
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:35,948
I don't allow this stuff on premises,
even if you're on vacation.

683
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,414
You remember the time you got it
in the enchiladas?

684
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:41,253
What are you
gonna do with them dogfish?

685
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:44,083
Me do nothing. Me on vacation.

686
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:48,717
Pedro can fry with plenty chili,
make hot.

687
00:50:55,869 --> 00:50:59,327
- Why not steam it, Mrs. Faulk?
- No guests allowed in the kitchen.

688
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:00,973
Mayn't I help?

689
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,703
Please let me.

690
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:05,845
I was born and bred in the fishing port
of Nantucket.

691
00:51:06,012 --> 00:51:08,913
And I've cooked every kind of fish
that swims in the sea.

692
00:51:09,082 --> 00:51:11,482
Except whales, but they're mammals.

693
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:14,119
I know what you're up to, honey.

694
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:17,814
You wanna make yourself useful so I'll
let you and old Gramps stay here free.

695
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,016
I wouldn't do anything so obvious.

696
00:51:20,193 --> 00:51:22,320
Not with a woman of your practicality.

697
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,896
No, my wanting to help in the kitchen...

698
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:27,192
May I have the knife, please?

699
00:51:27,467 --> 00:51:29,162
Machete.

700
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:32,330
It's just that I've noticed a certain...

701
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,942
...animosity towards
Mr. Shannon among the...

702
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:39,078
...ladies in his party,
particularly in the case of...

703
00:51:40,947 --> 00:51:44,781
...Miss Fellowes, and I think with
a soothing meal inside her...

704
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:46,509
...it might soothe her spirit.

705
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:50,689
Miss Jelkes, honey, you're a hustler.

706
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,883
A fantastic, cool hustler.

707
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,294
You're completely broke, huh?

708
00:51:56,797 --> 00:51:59,061
Yes, we are, completely.

709
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,596
You say that like you're proud of it.

710
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:03,998
I'm not proud of it,
or ashamed of it either.

711
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:06,571
It just happens to be
what's happened to us.

712
00:52:10,777 --> 00:52:12,176
You know what that means?

713
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:14,040
No, I don't think I do.

714
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,205
It's Chinese for "No sweat."

715
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,476
Our Chinese cook says it.

716
00:52:18,852 --> 00:52:20,945
Old Fred used to say...

717
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:24,716
...that those three words
summed up all the wisdom of the East.

718
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:27,920
- Fred?
- My husband.

719
00:52:28,361 --> 00:52:29,589
My late husband.

720
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:33,865
How lately did you lose him, Mrs. Faulk?

721
00:52:34,034 --> 00:52:36,502
Three, almost four weeks ago.

722
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,468
Maybe it hasn't dawned on me yet,
old Fred being gone for good.

723
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:42,574
It seems like he's out fishing.
He was always out fishing anyhow.

724
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:46,200
He hardly ever opened his mouth, except
when he got drunk and sang songs.

725
00:52:46,379 --> 00:52:49,712
He'd lie out in that hammock
and drink and sing all night long.

726
00:52:49,883 --> 00:52:51,407
No guest ever complained either.

727
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,179
Or I'd have shown them
the straight way down the hill.

728
00:52:54,454 --> 00:52:56,354
I'm sure you would.

729
00:52:57,691 --> 00:52:59,716
I loved old Fred.

730
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,518
More than anybody would guess, the way
I carried on. Except Fred, he knew.

731
00:53:03,697 --> 00:53:06,461
You see, he was 28 years older than me.

732
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:09,568
And we hadn't slept together in
I don't know when.

733
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:11,465
Fred used to say...

734
00:53:11,638 --> 00:53:15,472
...he guessed he was impotent. But if you
ask me, honey, he just plain lost interest.

735
00:53:17,844 --> 00:53:20,813
What other interest did he have,
Mrs. Faulk?

736
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:22,409
Only fishing.

737
00:53:22,582 --> 00:53:24,812
He'd catch them, throw them back in.

738
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:27,715
Unless they swallowed the hook,
we'd have them for supper.

739
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:29,788
Fred lived and let live.

740
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:35,083
When I hired them beach boys...

741
00:53:35,762 --> 00:53:36,820
...Fred care?

742
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:40,728
Did he raise hell when I started going
night swimming with them? Hell, no.

743
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:43,392
He just went night fishing all night long.

744
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:46,265
He must have been a remarkable man.

745
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:47,667
You said it.

746
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:51,675
People with troubles, and that's everybody,
used to come and spill them to old Fred.

747
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:54,905
And he could listen forever.
He was better than any head shrinker...

748
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:58,175
...because he knew what was
bugging you even before you told him.

749
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:01,252
That's why Shannon always made for
Mismaloya when he was spooked.

750
00:54:01,922 --> 00:54:05,949
I remember one time, he came down here
out of season like now.

751
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:07,559
And I went on the make for him.

752
00:54:07,727 --> 00:54:12,027
But Shannon wasn't having any,
on account of his friendship with Fred.

753
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:13,859
Well, they're all ready for steaming.

754
00:54:14,234 --> 00:54:17,670
So was I, Miss Jelkes, honey, so was I.

755
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:21,238
But I couldn't tell him
that Fred didn't give a damn.

756
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:23,534
It didn't seem fair to Fred.

757
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:28,912
You know I think you're quite a
remarkable person too, Mrs. Faulk.

758
00:54:29,082 --> 00:54:30,811
Don't you try to con me, honey.

759
00:54:30,984 --> 00:54:32,349
I understand me.

760
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,647
I still got my biological urges.

761
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,319
The beach boys?

762
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,556
Yup.

763
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:44,764
But even I know the difference
between loving somebody...

764
00:54:44,965 --> 00:54:48,332
...and just going to bed with them.
Even I know that.

765
00:55:03,081 --> 00:55:06,744
<i>Nelly was a lady</i>

766
00:55:06,919 --> 00:55:09,979
<i>Last night she died</i>

767
00:55:10,155 --> 00:55:14,114
<i>Toll the bell</i>
<i>For lovely Nell</i>

768
00:55:14,293 --> 00:55:16,818
<i>My dark Virginny bride</i>

769
00:55:17,396 --> 00:55:20,160
Don't you step in this room.
Don't step over that threshold.

770
00:55:20,332 --> 00:55:23,563
Don't complicate my life. I've got a fever.
Don't complicate my fever.

771
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:25,896
Larry, watch out.
You're walking on broken glass.

772
00:55:26,071 --> 00:55:27,299
- Never mind.
- Stand still.

773
00:55:27,473 --> 00:55:30,135
You're cutting your feet,
leaving blood stains on the floor.

774
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:32,800
- Who saw you come in here?
- Nobody but an iguana.

775
00:55:32,978 --> 00:55:35,640
- Your guardian angel will be in full cry.
- Let her howl.

776
00:55:35,814 --> 00:55:40,012
I hate her and I hate that little snitch
of a bitch that ruined you in Virginia.

777
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:43,018
You're ruining me in Mexico.
Get off your knees, it's indecent.

778
00:55:43,188 --> 00:55:46,521
Sit down over there. I want to
explain something to you. Look and listen.

779
00:55:46,925 --> 00:55:49,826
A man has got just so much
in his emotional bank balance.

780
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:52,088
But mine has run out.
It's stone dry.

781
00:55:52,264 --> 00:55:56,223
I can't draw a check on it now.
There's nothing left to draw out.

782
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:59,393
Oh, Lord, you've got blood stains on it.

783
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:01,835
I'm sorry to tell you
that you're as dangerous...

784
00:56:02,007 --> 00:56:04,100
...as you are young and lovely.

785
00:56:04,276 --> 00:56:08,610
And it's your being young and lovely
that makes you so dangerous.

786
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:15,049
And that gives you this destructive
potential over a destructible man.

787
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,585
We're not going back.

788
00:56:17,055 --> 00:56:18,488
We'll stay here together.

789
00:56:18,657 --> 00:56:22,650
Live here, be beachcombers like
Fletcher Christian and that native girl.

790
00:56:22,828 --> 00:56:27,288
Living in the sun.
You're going to marry me, Larry.

791
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:29,556
Oh, Lord, no, no.

792
00:56:29,735 --> 00:56:33,603
And nothing could be worse
for a girl in your unstable condition...

793
00:56:33,772 --> 00:56:37,833
...to be mixed up with a man
in my unstable condition.

794
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:41,002
Because two people
in unstable conditions...

795
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:45,479
...are like two countries
facing each other in unstable conditions.

796
00:56:45,651 --> 00:56:51,385
The destructive potential could blow
the whole world to bits...

797
00:56:51,557 --> 00:56:52,956
...past all repair.

798
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:54,953
You're walking barefoot on glass.

799
00:56:55,127 --> 00:56:57,789
I would walk on brimstone through hell...

800
00:56:57,963 --> 00:57:00,796
...to get you out of my room.
Now will you get out of my room.

801
00:57:00,966 --> 00:57:03,161
I don't believe you don't love me.

802
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:05,166
I love...
I love nobody.

803
00:57:05,337 --> 00:57:08,864
I know it's practically impossible
for anybody to realize they're not loved...

804
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:11,805
...when in love with somebody
they think they're in love with.

805
00:57:11,977 --> 00:57:14,571
You couldn't walk barefoot on glass
if you didn't love me.

806
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:20,275
I'm walking barefoot on glass
because you won't leave me alone.

807
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:24,315
All right, I'll do it too. I'll walk on glass
and I'll bleed to death with you.

808
00:57:24,623 --> 00:57:28,150
No, you won't do this. You will get
out of my room and out of my life.

809
00:57:28,327 --> 00:57:29,555
No, put me down. No!

810
00:57:30,729 --> 00:57:32,492
You will not come near me again,
understand?

811
00:57:32,664 --> 00:57:34,689
Put me down. I hate you!

812
00:57:34,866 --> 00:57:36,265
You've ruined my life.

813
00:57:36,435 --> 00:57:39,802
You've killed me, killed me!

814
00:57:39,972 --> 00:57:42,873
Put me down!

815
00:57:51,683 --> 00:57:53,241
What is this, Mr. Shannon?

816
00:57:53,418 --> 00:57:55,477
Hell and damnation.

817
00:57:55,654 --> 00:57:56,985
Your feet are bleeding.

818
00:57:57,155 --> 00:57:59,089
There's glass all over the floor
in my room.

819
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:03,421
Sit down. I have antiseptics
and surgical gauze in my room.

820
00:58:13,672 --> 00:58:17,369
Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.

821
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:21,368
That word "fantastic" seems to be
your favorite word, Mr. Shannon.

822
00:58:21,546 --> 00:58:22,945
Miss Jelkes...

823
00:58:23,115 --> 00:58:24,776
...we live on two levels.

824
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:26,178
Just two?

825
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:31,448
The fantastic level and the realistic level
are the two levels upon which we live.

826
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:33,648
But which is the real one really?

827
00:58:33,825 --> 00:58:35,725
I would say both, Mr. Shannon.

828
00:58:35,894 --> 00:58:39,125
But when you live
on the fantastic level...

829
00:58:39,297 --> 00:58:43,734
...as I have more and more lately,
but have to operate on the realistic level...

830
00:58:43,902 --> 00:58:45,802
...that's when you get spooked.

831
00:58:46,038 --> 00:58:48,700
And I am spooked, Miss Jelkes.

832
00:58:48,874 --> 00:58:51,707
<i>A chronicle no longer gold</i>

833
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,838
<i>A bargaining with mist of gold</i>

834
00:58:55,013 --> 00:58:56,310
There.

835
00:58:56,481 --> 00:58:59,348
Now I'll go and clear up
the broken glass in your room.

836
00:58:59,518 --> 00:59:02,578
Don't bother about that. If you'd be
kind enough to bring my shoes...

837
00:59:02,754 --> 00:59:05,780
...and could you let me have
my clerical collar? It's on the floor.

838
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:13,528
Are you planning to conduct a church
service here tonight, Mr. Shannon?

839
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:16,759
No, I just plan to do...

840
00:59:16,935 --> 00:59:18,300
...nothing.

841
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:21,701
Oh, and bring me that distributor head,
if you would.

842
00:59:24,509 --> 00:59:25,874
This?

843
00:59:26,878 --> 00:59:28,243
That's it.

844
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:35,479
If you're not going to conduct a service,
why get into this uncomfortable outfit?

845
00:59:35,654 --> 00:59:40,148
Because I've been accused of being
defrocked and lying about it, that's why.

846
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:46,264
I will demonstrate to these ladies that
I'm still a frocked minister of the gospel.

847
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:48,524
I'm afraid it's no use, Mr. Shannon.

848
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,760
The neckband's so frayed,
it won't hold the collar button.

849
00:59:51,937 --> 00:59:53,734
- Oh, damn.
- Hannah!

850
00:59:53,905 --> 00:59:55,896
Oh, God, he's fallen.

851
00:59:59,311 --> 01:00:00,972
Hey, Grandpa.

852
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,380
There you are.

853
01:00:11,423 --> 01:00:13,448
I wish my pulse were as steady as his.

854
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:16,150
Did you feel dizzy, Grandfather?

855
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:18,486
No, no.

856
01:00:18,897 --> 01:00:22,094
I was working on my new poem and...

857
01:00:23,101 --> 01:00:25,126
Where's my cane?

858
01:00:30,108 --> 01:00:32,133
There you are, Grandpa.

859
01:00:32,544 --> 01:00:37,948
I was beating time with my cane
and my cane slipped.

860
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:39,873
You'd better rest a while.

861
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:41,518
Yes.

862
01:00:41,686 --> 01:00:43,586
Rest a while.

863
01:00:43,955 --> 01:00:46,651
He'll be all right now,
we can talk outside.

864
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:49,594
Why are you breathing like that?

865
01:00:50,662 --> 01:00:52,220
Some people take a drink...

866
01:00:53,932 --> 01:00:56,298
...others take a pill.

867
01:00:57,636 --> 01:01:00,799
I just take a few deep breaths.

868
01:01:00,972 --> 01:01:02,337
Well...

869
01:01:02,507 --> 01:01:04,839
...don't be frightened about it.

870
01:01:06,845 --> 01:01:10,144
He was amazing, just amazing...

871
01:01:10,315 --> 01:01:16,049
...until he started having these little,
whatever they are, these spells.

872
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:17,949
When they started, I...

873
01:01:18,123 --> 01:01:23,186
...tried to persuade him to go back to
Nantucket but he said, "No. Mexico."

874
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:26,421
So Mexico it is.

875
01:01:26,598 --> 01:01:29,795
And he wouldn't rest anywhere,
until he got to the sea.

876
01:01:29,968 --> 01:01:33,131
"The cradle of life," as he calls it.

877
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,637
So here we are, Mr. Shannon.

878
01:01:36,808 --> 01:01:40,471
Like a couple of scarecrows
on this windy hilltop...

879
01:01:40,645 --> 01:01:42,670
...over the cradle of life.

880
01:01:42,848 --> 01:01:46,477
<i>The plummeting to earth and then...</i>

881
01:01:46,651 --> 01:01:48,346
Hannah? Hannah?

882
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,479
- Yes, Grandfather?
- I'm pretty sure I'm gonna finish it here.

883
01:01:52,657 --> 01:01:55,023
I have the same feeling myself,
Grandpa.

884
01:01:55,193 --> 01:01:57,991
I've never been surer of anything
in my life.

885
01:01:58,163 --> 01:02:01,030
I've never been surer of anything
in mine, either.

886
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,226
Of course, you'll finish the poem.
Why, it's nearly finished already.

887
01:02:05,403 --> 01:02:09,100
I'll be outside if you want me
to write something down.

888
01:02:12,544 --> 01:02:15,172
He'll probably sleep a while now.

889
01:02:17,816 --> 01:02:22,185
Miss Jelkes, may l...?
May I have one of your cigarettes?

890
01:02:23,321 --> 01:02:25,312
You must never smoke those.

891
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:28,926
They're made out of cigarette ends
taken out of the gutters.

892
01:02:29,094 --> 01:02:30,959
Have one of mine.

893
01:02:31,129 --> 01:02:36,123
English, imported, in an airtight tin.
It's my one luxury in life.

894
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:39,930
Yes, thank you, I will,
since you've thrown mine away.

895
01:02:40,105 --> 01:02:41,333
Well...

896
01:02:41,506 --> 01:02:45,169
...l'm going to tell you something
about yourself, Miss Jelkes.

897
01:02:45,343 --> 01:02:50,371
You are a lady,
a real one and a great one.

898
01:02:50,982 --> 01:02:53,974
What have I done to merit
that compliment from you?

899
01:02:54,152 --> 01:02:57,383
Well, you took out your cigarettes,
found out you only had two left.

900
01:02:57,555 --> 01:03:00,388
You can't afford to buy another pack
of even that cheap brand...

901
01:03:00,558 --> 01:03:03,322
...and so you put them away for later,
right?

902
01:03:03,628 --> 01:03:06,426
Mercilessly accurate, Mr. Shannon.

903
01:03:06,598 --> 01:03:11,058
But when I asked you for one, you gave
me it without slightest sign of reluctance.

904
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:15,133
I think you're making a big point
out of a small matter.

905
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:17,034
Oh, no, no.

906
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:21,907
I'm making a small point
out of a very, very large matter.

907
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:29,213
How long have you been inactive
in the church, Mr. Shannon?

908
01:03:30,288 --> 01:03:33,587
What's that got to do
with the price of rice in China?

909
01:03:33,758 --> 01:03:35,487
- Nothing.
- And what's it got to do...

910
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,185
...with the price of coffee in Brazil?

911
01:03:38,964 --> 01:03:41,694
I retract the question, with apologies.

912
01:03:41,866 --> 01:03:45,199
Very well, then,
I'll be glad to answer it. I...

913
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:48,828
I have been inactive
in the church for all but one year...

914
01:03:49,007 --> 01:03:52,841
...since I was ordained
a minister of the church.

915
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:55,479
That's quite a sabbatical, Mr. Shannon.

916
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:59,549
Yes, I had one parish for one year
and then...

917
01:04:00,051 --> 01:04:01,951
...I was not defrocked...

918
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,680
...I was locked out of the church.

919
01:04:09,995 --> 01:04:12,691
Are you...? You drawing me?

920
01:04:13,665 --> 01:04:15,530
I'm trying to.

921
01:04:16,768 --> 01:04:18,861
Why did they lock you out?

922
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:23,970
For fornication and conduct
unbecoming a man of the cloth.

923
01:04:24,776 --> 01:04:29,679
What were the circumstances
of the first offense?

924
01:04:29,848 --> 01:04:31,509
Fornication?

925
01:04:32,384 --> 01:04:37,515
A very young Sunday school teacher asked
to see me, privately, in my study and...

926
01:04:37,689 --> 01:04:39,122
...well, she...

927
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:42,418
She declared herself
to me, wildly.

928
01:04:42,794 --> 01:04:45,228
A declaration of love?

929
01:04:45,563 --> 01:04:48,657
Don't make fun of me, Miss Jelkes.

930
01:04:49,868 --> 01:04:51,529
I wasn't.

931
01:04:53,905 --> 01:04:56,635
I was the damnedest prig
in those days that you can imagine.

932
01:04:56,808 --> 01:05:00,300
I said to this girl, I said,
"Let us kneel down and pray together."

933
01:05:00,478 --> 01:05:01,877
And we did, we knelt.

934
01:05:02,047 --> 01:05:04,174
And then all of sudden, the...

935
01:05:04,482 --> 01:05:08,441
...kneeling position turned
into a reclining position.

936
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:14,082
The next day, she cut herself with
her father's straight blade razor.

937
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:17,127
- Fatally?
- No, no, no.

938
01:05:17,295 --> 01:05:19,354
Thanks to a Band-Aid.

939
01:05:19,697 --> 01:05:22,598
But it made a scandal.

940
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:25,429
Yes, I imagine that it
caused some comment.

941
01:05:25,603 --> 01:05:26,900
Yes, it did, it did that.

942
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:32,833
The next Sunday when I saw those smug,
accusing, disapproving faces uplifted...

943
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:36,469
...I had a sudden urge to shock.

944
01:05:36,648 --> 01:05:38,309
And I shocked them.

945
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:40,982
I chased them out of the church.

946
01:05:41,953 --> 01:05:44,217
And what was the upshot of it?

947
01:05:44,389 --> 01:05:48,382
They put me in a nice little private
asylum to recover from...

948
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,358
...a complete nervous breakdown.
That's the way they put it.

949
01:05:51,529 --> 01:05:53,690
And then when I got out I...

950
01:05:53,865 --> 01:05:55,560
I entered this line.

951
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:59,533
"Tours of God's world,
conducted by a minister of God."

952
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:02,036
To quote the pamphlet.

953
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,337
But on the side...

954
01:06:04,742 --> 01:06:06,903
...Shannon has been collecting evidence.

955
01:06:07,078 --> 01:06:11,014
- Evidence of what?
- Man's inhumanity to God.

956
01:06:13,017 --> 01:06:16,646
- What do you mean by that?
- The pain we cause him.

957
01:06:17,188 --> 01:06:20,123
We've poisoned his atmosphere.

958
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:22,623
We've slaughtered
his creatures of the wild.

959
01:06:22,794 --> 01:06:25,092
We've polluted his rivers.

960
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:30,091
We've even taken
God's noblest creation, man...

961
01:06:30,268 --> 01:06:33,396
...and brainwashed him into becoming
our own product, not God's.

962
01:06:33,571 --> 01:06:36,768
Hacked, stacked and canned.

963
01:06:42,413 --> 01:06:44,381
Am I...?
Am I moving too much?

964
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:47,444
No, of course not.

965
01:06:51,823 --> 01:06:53,723
Mr. Shannon?

966
01:06:54,025 --> 01:06:55,754
What do you do if...?

967
01:06:55,927 --> 01:06:58,225
If what?

968
01:06:58,396 --> 01:07:00,421
If Miss Fellowes has her way?

969
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:03,294
And gets me fired?

970
01:07:03,768 --> 01:07:05,793
Yes, what do you do then?

971
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:11,234
Well, I either go back
to the church, or I...

972
01:07:11,643 --> 01:07:13,076
I take the long swim.

973
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:16,145
- It's right out there.
- What is?

974
01:07:17,382 --> 01:07:18,713
China.

975
01:07:30,094 --> 01:07:33,359
- Was that the luncheon gong?
- Chow will be ready in a half-hour.

976
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:35,897
How you feeling, Miss Peebles, honey?
A bit better?

977
01:07:36,067 --> 01:07:38,592
- Thank you, I think I am.
- How about a little drink?

978
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:42,228
- That won't hurt you.
- Well...

979
01:07:42,941 --> 01:07:45,808
You look like the den mother.
How about you, Miss Fellowes?

980
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:49,378
Thank you, we'll just sit here
and wait until lunch is ready.

981
01:07:49,581 --> 01:07:51,481
Miss Fellowes, honey.

982
01:07:51,649 --> 01:07:53,173
I know you got a beef or two.

983
01:07:53,418 --> 01:07:56,649
But why don't you just relax
with a little complimentary rum-coco?

984
01:07:56,821 --> 01:08:00,552
Save them for your friend, Mr. Shannon.
I don't imbibe.

985
01:08:00,725 --> 01:08:02,716
Then how about a little pot?

986
01:08:02,894 --> 01:08:04,759
I don't usually serve it to my guests...

987
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:07,159
...but you look like
you need something special.

988
01:08:13,605 --> 01:08:15,197
May I see?

989
01:08:15,573 --> 01:08:18,303
I'm just a quick sketch artist,
Mr. Shannon.

990
01:08:18,476 --> 01:08:20,501
Not very talented.

991
01:08:21,446 --> 01:08:23,107
Are my eyes as wild as this?

992
01:08:23,281 --> 01:08:24,680
Yes, they are, Mr. Shannon.

993
01:08:24,849 --> 01:08:26,476
I have fever.

994
01:08:26,651 --> 01:08:29,484
- What gives with you two?
- What do you mean, what gives?

995
01:08:29,654 --> 01:08:31,747
I mean, am I butting in here?
Is three a crowd?

996
01:08:31,923 --> 01:08:34,118
No, indeed, not a bit.

997
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:36,793
What are you covering up there?
Let me see.

998
01:08:37,996 --> 01:08:40,658
What are you drawing him for?
He's broker than you are.

999
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:43,290
Perhaps you'd like to keep it,
Mrs. Faulk.

1000
01:08:43,468 --> 01:08:46,562
Thanks a hell of a lot, honey,
but one of him is enough.

1001
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:49,730
- Who wants a drink?
- Nothing for me, thank you.

1002
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:52,375
Just as well. You're in to me
for the rooms and meals.

1003
01:08:52,543 --> 01:08:54,738
- A little whiskey makes no difference.
- Lay off.

1004
01:08:55,179 --> 01:08:57,739
And you go to hell, why don't you!

1005
01:09:05,023 --> 01:09:06,923
Mr. Shannon, Mrs. Faulk.

1006
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:11,221
This is childish.
Stop it at once. It's disgraceful!

1007
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:14,464
It's disgraceful.

1008
01:09:17,702 --> 01:09:20,933
- Mrs. Faulk, you must realize...
- I realize you're a deadbeat.

1009
01:09:21,105 --> 01:09:23,005
Using that dying old man as a front...

1010
01:09:23,174 --> 01:09:26,405
...to get you into places when you
ain't got cash for one day in advance.

1011
01:09:26,778 --> 01:09:28,939
You're dragging him around
like a Chinese beggar...

1012
01:09:29,113 --> 01:09:32,549
...dragging around crippled children
to put the touch on the tourists.

1013
01:09:32,717 --> 01:09:34,446
I shall go into town.

1014
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:36,814
And I shall set up my easel in the plaza...

1015
01:09:36,988 --> 01:09:39,752
...and I shall peddle my watercolors,
and sketch tourists.

1016
01:09:39,924 --> 01:09:42,119
I am not a weak person, Mrs. Faulk.

1017
01:09:42,293 --> 01:09:44,318
My failure here is not typical of me.

1018
01:09:44,495 --> 01:09:46,929
- I'm not a weak person either, honey.
- Oh, no, indeed.

1019
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:49,566
- Your strength is awe-inspiring.
- You bet your...

1020
01:09:53,971 --> 01:09:56,462
How you going into town,
when you ain't got cab fare?

1021
01:09:56,941 --> 01:09:59,068
I shall go on shanks' mare, Mrs. Faulk.

1022
01:09:59,243 --> 01:10:02,371
I'm Nantucket born and bred.
Islanders are good walkers.

1023
01:10:02,547 --> 01:10:03,844
I shall pack our things.

1024
01:10:04,015 --> 01:10:06,381
And I shall put my grandfather
into his wheelchair...

1025
01:10:06,551 --> 01:10:09,714
...and push him back down this hill
to the road, all the way into town.

1026
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:12,447
He would prefer that
to staying where he is not wanted.

1027
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:15,884
And I would prefer it for him
and for myself, Mrs. Faulk.

1028
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,288
All right, calm down.

1029
01:10:17,462 --> 01:10:19,896
- I am perfectly calm, Mrs. Faulk.
- Well, I'm not.

1030
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:22,589
That's the trouble.
The trouble is Shannon.

1031
01:10:22,767 --> 01:10:25,395
- I caught the vibrations between you two.
- Mrs. Faulk.

1032
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:28,300
I'm a New England spinster
who is pushing 40.

1033
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:30,373
Well, who the hell isn't?

1034
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:32,668
I'm good at catching vibrations.

1035
01:10:32,844 --> 01:10:37,110
And there were vibrations between you,
mutual vibrations, the minute you got here.

1036
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:40,182
And just that, believe me, is enough
to put me in a lather.

1037
01:10:40,351 --> 01:10:41,841
And don't ask me why.
Look at him.

1038
01:10:42,019 --> 01:10:44,078
Broke, spooked, as good as fired.

1039
01:10:44,655 --> 01:10:47,852
Those are only his circumstances,
Mrs. Faulk...

1040
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:50,858
...not the man himself.
- Well, anyhow.

1041
01:10:51,028 --> 01:10:52,427
Forget what I said, honey.

1042
01:10:52,597 --> 01:10:55,430
I wasn't sore at you,
I was sore at Shannon.

1043
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,263
<i>And still the ripe fruit and the branch</i>

1044
01:10:59,437 --> 01:11:03,203
- <i>Observe the sky begin to blanch</i>
- I'll fix old Gramps a toddy.

1045
01:11:03,374 --> 01:11:05,740
- Old folks need it, need a toddy.
- <i>Without a cry...</i>

1046
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:07,605
That's very kind of you.

1047
01:11:07,779 --> 01:11:10,077
I'll make him a Manhattan
with two cherries in it.

1048
01:11:10,248 --> 01:11:11,977
So he'll live through lunch.

1049
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:13,515
Charlotte.

1050
01:11:13,684 --> 01:11:16,209
- Charlotte!
- What's eating her now?

1051
01:11:16,521 --> 01:11:19,513
Charlotte. Girls! Charlotte!

1052
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,658
What's the trouble now, Miss Fellowes?

1053
01:11:21,826 --> 01:11:23,418
Charlotte. Have you seen her?

1054
01:11:23,594 --> 01:11:26,154
She's disappeared.
Charlotte.

1055
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:28,195
- Charlotte!
- Charlotte.

1056
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:40,835
- Charlotte.
- Now be calm, Miss Fellowes.

1057
01:11:41,012 --> 01:11:42,707
Tell us quietly what has happened.

1058
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,340
She didn't come to luncheon. Her room
was empty, and she's not in my room.

1059
01:11:47,518 --> 01:11:50,009
I don't know what's happened.
She doesn't answer.

1060
01:11:50,188 --> 01:11:52,088
- Let's find her. Charlotte.
- Charlotte.

1061
01:11:52,256 --> 01:11:55,225
Charlotte.

1062
01:12:35,867 --> 01:12:38,233
- More.
- No more.

1063
01:12:38,402 --> 01:12:40,302
No more, I say.
Stop it.

1064
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:42,769
- <i>Senorita</i>, go home.
- I have no home.

1065
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,237
Go home, I say.

1066
01:12:44,408 --> 01:12:46,842
Take your dollars with you.
I'm a rich man.

1067
01:12:47,011 --> 01:12:51,380
I do not want your dollars.
I do not want you dancing to my music.

1068
01:12:51,549 --> 01:12:53,210
- More music.
- No more music.

1069
01:12:53,384 --> 01:12:56,717
<i>Senorita</i>, we do not want our sons
to know that young girls can be like you.

1070
01:12:59,657 --> 01:13:03,593
I won't go back up there.
Put me down. Let me go!

1071
01:13:19,677 --> 01:13:21,770
Attaboy, Hank.
Give it to them!

1072
01:13:24,282 --> 01:13:25,840
Hit them.

1073
01:13:27,351 --> 01:13:28,909
Knock them down.

1074
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:31,986
Attaboy, hit them.

1075
01:13:32,823 --> 01:13:34,256
Yeah, hit them again.

1076
01:13:35,526 --> 01:13:38,222
Yeah, give it to them, Hank.

1077
01:13:41,599 --> 01:13:43,464
Come on, hit them.

1078
01:13:47,104 --> 01:13:49,129
Come on, Hank.

1079
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:51,537
Knock them down! Knock them out!

1080
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:54,644
Yeah, come on, Hank, give it to them.

1081
01:13:59,617 --> 01:14:01,710
Come on, Hank!

1082
01:14:18,636 --> 01:14:22,663
Oh, Hank, you saved me.
You're so brave.

1083
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,799
My hero. Oh, Hank, take me home.

1084
01:14:26,978 --> 01:14:29,742
I mean home.
I'll tell Daddy it was you who saved me.

1085
01:14:29,914 --> 01:14:33,850
Daddy, he loves me.
He'll do anything to thank you.

1086
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,421
I wonder if any of you ladies
would be interested in seeing...

1087
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:41,080
...some samples of my work?

1088
01:14:41,258 --> 01:14:42,657
This one is entitled:

1089
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:45,328
<i>Moonlight Recollected by Daylight</i>.

1090
01:14:45,496 --> 01:14:50,433
And here, here is a character sketch
that I did in less than five minutes.

1091
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:55,095
The queen, when she was Princess
Elizabeth, on a tour of Africa years ago.

1092
01:14:55,306 --> 01:14:57,001
I couldn't get very close, of course.

1093
01:14:57,174 --> 01:14:59,369
- I had to use field glasses.
- No, thank you.

1094
01:14:59,543 --> 01:15:04,708
<i>Love's an old remembered song</i>
<i>A drunken fiddler plays</i>

1095
01:15:04,882 --> 01:15:08,477
<i>Stumbling crazily along</i>
<i>Crooked alleyways</i>

1096
01:15:08,653 --> 01:15:12,521
- Not now, Nonno.
- <i>When his heart is mad with music</i>

1097
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:15,887
- <i>He will play the</i>...
- Nonno, please.

1098
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:22,858
He thinks that someone called
for a recitation of one of his poems.

1099
01:15:23,034 --> 01:15:24,365
Don't you worry, honey.

1100
01:15:24,535 --> 01:15:27,129
In this crowd,
old Gramps is the life of the party.

1101
01:15:27,304 --> 01:15:29,465
Gramps, honey, here.

1102
01:15:29,707 --> 01:15:31,607
Finish your toddy.

1103
01:15:33,377 --> 01:15:35,845
I don't care what anybody says.

1104
01:15:36,013 --> 01:15:37,571
This fish is delicious.

1105
01:15:37,915 --> 01:15:40,543
Swing it this way.
I could handle another helping.

1106
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:45,653
And no funny stuff.
Keep those dukes on the platter.

1107
01:15:51,228 --> 01:15:52,525
What did he say?

1108
01:15:52,697 --> 01:15:56,758
He says you're a hell of a man
in action against a fish...

1109
01:15:56,934 --> 01:15:59,095
...if it's a dead fish.

1110
01:16:05,109 --> 01:16:07,100
Very funny.

1111
01:16:07,912 --> 01:16:11,177
Daddy always says the only difference
between a success and a failure...

1112
01:16:11,348 --> 01:16:15,079
...is that a success knows an opportunity
when he sees it, and a failure doesn't.

1113
01:16:15,252 --> 01:16:17,686
Well, don't worry about me
recognizing an opportunity.

1114
01:16:17,855 --> 01:16:21,256
Oh, Hank. When I tell Daddy,
he'll be so proud of you.

1115
01:16:21,425 --> 01:16:23,723
Hannah?
What was the take?

1116
01:16:23,894 --> 01:16:26,590
Grandfather, please stop shouting.

1117
01:16:26,764 --> 01:16:29,824
Did they cross your palm
with silver or paper, Hannah?

1118
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,458
Nonno, no more shouting,
we're having lunch.

1119
01:16:33,637 --> 01:16:34,934
Chow time, Gramps.

1120
01:16:35,106 --> 01:16:37,267
How much did they come across with?

1121
01:16:37,641 --> 01:16:39,302
He won't stop shouting.

1122
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:42,242
Gramps. Five dollars.

1123
01:16:42,413 --> 01:16:44,142
I'm putting it in your pocket.

1124
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,508
We can't accept gratuities,
Mr. Shannon.

1125
01:16:46,684 --> 01:16:49,016
Oh, hell, it was only pesos.

1126
01:16:49,286 --> 01:16:51,880
Yeah, we're going to clean up
in this place.

1127
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:54,524
You bet we're going
to clean up here, Gramps.

1128
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:58,020
If there's a cocktail lounge,
we ought to work that first.

1129
01:16:58,195 --> 01:17:00,663
Strike while the iron is hot.

1130
01:17:00,898 --> 01:17:02,525
While it's hot.

1131
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,361
Hello?

1132
01:17:04,535 --> 01:17:06,230
Hello?

1133
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:09,464
Speaking.

1134
01:17:10,074 --> 01:17:12,099
Anything I can do for you?

1135
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,773
Who?

1136
01:17:15,646 --> 01:17:16,908
Shannon.

1137
01:17:17,081 --> 01:17:20,608
You're wanted on the blower.
El Paso. Person-to-person.

1138
01:17:21,852 --> 01:17:24,343
This is the moment you've awaited,
Miss Fellowes.

1139
01:17:24,522 --> 01:17:28,117
That will be my esteemed,
but not by me, employer.

1140
01:17:28,292 --> 01:17:32,228
I will now demonstrate to you
how a man of integrity brings an almost...

1141
01:17:32,396 --> 01:17:36,890
...insoluble situation
to a triumphant conclusion.

1142
01:17:54,451 --> 01:17:57,682
The Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon
speaking.

1143
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:02,957
Well, Mr. Blake, how are you?
Nice of you to call.

1144
01:18:03,127 --> 01:18:06,722
Wish you were down here with us.
The air's like spring wine down here...

1145
01:18:06,897 --> 01:18:08,524
...at this time of year.

1146
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:11,964
What do you mean, on the sauce?
You know me better than that, Mr. Blake.

1147
01:18:13,604 --> 01:18:16,038
I don't care what any
judge in Corpus Christi says.

1148
01:18:16,207 --> 01:18:20,337
You know and I know that I am a
regularly ordained minister of the gospel.

1149
01:18:20,511 --> 01:18:24,880
- <i>Shannon, you're fired as of right now.</i>
- Now, wait a minute, you big fat zero.

1150
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:26,482
Let me tell you something.

1151
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:29,710
A tour conductor is like
the captain of a ship.

1152
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:33,288
Once the bus leaves the terminal
he is in sole command.

1153
01:18:33,457 --> 01:18:35,584
And let me assure you...

1154
01:18:35,759 --> 01:18:38,057
...that Shannon runs a taut bus.

1155
01:18:38,362 --> 01:18:40,887
A very taut bus. I've taken it past...

1156
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:43,932
...deadly shoals and all the perils
of the deep.

1157
01:18:44,101 --> 01:18:47,901
Figuratively speaking, of course.
And I remain in command.

1158
01:18:48,205 --> 01:18:52,141
I have here in my pocket
the symbol of my command.

1159
01:18:52,309 --> 01:18:54,174
Right here, in my pocket.

1160
01:18:54,345 --> 01:18:57,746
You cannot fire a man
who has the distributor head.

1161
01:18:57,915 --> 01:19:00,008
Shannon can fire Blake's Tours...

1162
01:19:00,184 --> 01:19:02,812
...but Blake's Tours cannot fire Shannon.

1163
01:19:02,987 --> 01:19:06,252
- This tour will end in peace and unity.
- <i>You're fired, Shannon!</i>

1164
01:19:06,423 --> 01:19:09,551
Shannon will emerge triumphant.

1165
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:15,887
Well, Hank, aren't you proud of me?
As a member of my crew...

1166
01:19:16,066 --> 01:19:18,000
...aren't you proud of me?

1167
01:19:18,168 --> 01:19:23,196
Hank, you know that... That shiner
gives you character, Hank.

1168
01:19:23,374 --> 01:19:25,308
Hey, lay off, you big baboon.

1169
01:19:25,476 --> 01:19:27,967
I got it. I got it, I got it. I got it!

1170
01:19:28,145 --> 01:19:30,375
That's to show how I hate you.

1171
01:19:30,547 --> 01:19:32,742
I hate you.

1172
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:37,081
Foe. I thought you were my friend
and you turned out to be my foe. Foe.

1173
01:19:37,254 --> 01:19:39,745
You're all through, Reverend.
You've had it.

1174
01:19:39,957 --> 01:19:42,016
Relax, baby. The party's over.

1175
01:19:42,192 --> 01:19:43,784
Okay, folks, let's get cracking.

1176
01:19:43,961 --> 01:19:46,555
Get your duds together, we're
ready to blow this goat shed.

1177
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:48,789
- Goat shed?
- Come on, I'll help you get packed.

1178
01:19:48,966 --> 01:19:51,992
You got rooms in Puerto Vallarta.
I'll have you there in 20 minutes.

1179
01:19:52,169 --> 01:19:55,366
From now on, this tour is gonna be
conducted like a respectable tour.

1180
01:19:55,539 --> 01:19:58,167
Respectable? Why these ladies have had,
some of them...

1181
01:19:58,342 --> 01:20:02,005
...most of them, if not all of them,
for the first time in their lives...

1182
01:20:02,179 --> 01:20:05,808
...contact, social contact, with a
gentleman born and bred...

1183
01:20:05,983 --> 01:20:08,952
...whom under no other circumstances
could they possibly have met.

1184
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:11,451
The son of a clergyman
and the grandson of two bishops.

1185
01:20:11,622 --> 01:20:12,987
Churchmen on both sides
of the family.

1186
01:20:17,795 --> 01:20:20,093
- How's old Gramps doing?
- He's sleeping just now.

1187
01:20:20,264 --> 01:20:22,198
Through that riot?

1188
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,666
Will Mr. Shannon be all right,
do you think?

1189
01:20:25,836 --> 01:20:28,566
All right? Honey, I don't know.

1190
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:33,142
He cracks up like this so regular,
you can set a calendar by it.

1191
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,777
About twice a year.

1192
01:20:34,945 --> 01:20:36,970
He's done it twice down here.

1193
01:20:37,147 --> 01:20:40,207
Fred used to say it had something to do
with the moon.

1194
01:20:41,118 --> 01:20:44,281
I sure wish old Fred was here right now.

1195
01:20:45,756 --> 01:20:47,656
Oh, my God!

1196
01:20:47,825 --> 01:20:50,385
- What is it, Mrs. Faulk?
- Honey, I advise you not to look.

1197
01:20:50,561 --> 01:20:54,088
Just take my word for it.
Old Shannon is out-Shannoning Shannon.

1198
01:20:56,633 --> 01:21:01,036
Shannon, you beast. You beast.
You, you... You unutterable beast!

1199
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:04,234
Did you see what he did?

1200
01:21:04,408 --> 01:21:08,344
All right, ladies, now keep calm.
Keep calm, ladies. Just follow me.

1201
01:21:09,213 --> 01:21:11,113
Follow me down the hill.

1202
01:21:11,715 --> 01:21:13,706
Make sure you get my bag.

1203
01:21:20,391 --> 01:21:22,450
Shannon.

1204
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:26,460
You've avenged yourself for
all time on Miss Fellowes' suitcase.

1205
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:29,793
I've heard of a dog cocking his leg.

1206
01:21:31,068 --> 01:21:33,332
Why don't you buzz off
on your broomstick?

1207
01:21:33,504 --> 01:21:35,472
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to him.

1208
01:21:35,806 --> 01:21:38,969
I'm going to have you blacklisted
in every travel agency in America.

1209
01:21:39,309 --> 01:21:43,609
What about Africa, Tasmania,
Bechuanaland, Tonmawr?

1210
01:21:43,781 --> 01:21:45,681
Please, Miss Fellowes, leave him alone.

1211
01:21:45,849 --> 01:21:48,943
As soon as I get back, I'm gonna swear
out a warrant for your arrest.

1212
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:52,720
Molesting a minor, kidnapping,
malicious damage to private property.

1213
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:54,289
Indecent exposure.

1214
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:57,985
What subject do you teach
back in that college of yours, honey?

1215
01:21:58,162 --> 01:22:02,189
- Voice, if that's got anything to do with it.
- Well, geography's my speciality.

1216
01:22:02,366 --> 01:22:04,425
Did you know that if it wasn't for
the dykes...

1217
01:22:04,601 --> 01:22:07,126
...the plains of Texas would be engulfed
by the Gulf?

1218
01:22:07,304 --> 01:22:08,532
Maxine.

1219
01:22:08,705 --> 01:22:10,570
Let's level a while, butch, old gal.

1220
01:22:10,741 --> 01:22:13,175
Do you know what you're sore about,
really sore about?

1221
01:22:13,343 --> 01:22:17,074
That little quail of yours
has a natural preference for men instead of...

1222
01:22:17,247 --> 01:22:18,612
Maxine!

1223
01:22:22,019 --> 01:22:23,316
What is she talking about?

1224
01:22:24,088 --> 01:22:27,114
You'd better go now, Miss Fellowes.
The party's over.

1225
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,555
Right now, I'm no longer
in a position to...

1226
01:22:29,726 --> 01:22:32,695
...discharge my responsibility
of protecting you.

1227
01:22:32,863 --> 01:22:36,321
Responsibility from which
you discharged me.

1228
01:22:36,633 --> 01:22:38,328
Just go, Miss Fellowes.

1229
01:22:38,502 --> 01:22:40,129
Just go.

1230
01:22:48,112 --> 01:22:51,411
What did you shut me up for?
It's time somebody told that old dame off.

1231
01:22:52,249 --> 01:22:53,978
Miss Fellowes is a highly moral person.

1232
01:22:54,151 --> 01:22:57,643
And if she ever recognized the truth
about herself, it would destroy her.

1233
01:22:58,122 --> 01:23:00,818
Well, she's done a pretty good job
of destroying you.

1234
01:23:01,225 --> 01:23:02,852
Maxine.

1235
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,221
Don't rob me of the credit
for my own small accomplishments.

1236
01:23:10,434 --> 01:23:14,336
Jehoshaphat, the bill!
They haven't paid the cotton-picking bill!

1237
01:23:15,906 --> 01:23:18,568
All right, ladies, take your seats,
we'll be out of here.

1238
01:23:18,742 --> 01:23:22,371
I don't know, I kind of hate to leave
this nice place.

1239
01:23:22,546 --> 01:23:24,309
Peebie.

1240
01:23:25,482 --> 01:23:28,178
- Charlotte, you get in next.
- Climb in, Miss Fellowes.

1241
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:30,479
Charlotte's sitting up front with me.

1242
01:23:32,489 --> 01:23:34,013
Hey!

1243
01:23:34,191 --> 01:23:35,749
Just a flipping minute.

1244
01:23:35,926 --> 01:23:38,622
- What is it now?
- 300 pesos, that's what it is now.

1245
01:23:38,795 --> 01:23:41,093
- Twenty-four dollars.
- What about my suitcase?

1246
01:23:41,265 --> 01:23:43,699
Miss Fellowes, honey,
you ain't gonna blame that on me.

1247
01:23:43,867 --> 01:23:46,927
I blame your tout that brought us
here. Collect the money from him.

1248
01:23:47,104 --> 01:23:51,063
Miss Fellowes, you've been doing a lot of
complaining about the food on this trip.

1249
01:23:51,241 --> 01:23:54,108
You figure you're gonna do any better
in a Mexican jail?

1250
01:23:55,612 --> 01:23:59,139
- Attagirl.
- One, two, three.

1251
01:24:00,317 --> 01:24:03,514
And watch out for the fleas
at the Ambos Mundos.

1252
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:06,679
All you have to do is sponge down
with a little kerosene.

1253
01:24:06,857 --> 01:24:10,918
The manager keeps a big supply
right in the lobby.

1254
01:24:11,828 --> 01:24:14,797
There go your ladies, Mr. Shannon.

1255
01:24:17,301 --> 01:24:19,963
The spook's triumphant.

1256
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:22,497
He's won his point.

1257
01:24:22,973 --> 01:24:25,999
He's proved there's no place
for Shannon...

1258
01:24:26,176 --> 01:24:28,610
...on the realistic level.

1259
01:24:29,079 --> 01:24:33,140
The last thin thread
that bound him there...

1260
01:24:33,317 --> 01:24:35,217
...is broken.

1261
01:24:36,053 --> 01:24:37,987
Now, Lord...

1262
01:24:38,222 --> 01:24:40,349
...letteth thy servant...

1263
01:24:40,524 --> 01:24:42,958
...depart in peace.

1264
01:24:43,126 --> 01:24:46,653
Mr. Shannon, stop that.
You're cutting yourself doing that.

1265
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:48,354
Here. Please. Let me help.

1266
01:24:48,532 --> 01:24:51,467
- Let me take it off.
- I've got to break the chain.

1267
01:24:51,635 --> 01:24:54,604
No, no, no. Now, wait. Wait.

1268
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:57,173
There.

1269
01:24:57,341 --> 01:24:58,899
There, I have it.

1270
01:24:59,076 --> 01:25:00,304
Thank you.

1271
01:25:00,477 --> 01:25:03,275
It's yours. You keep it.

1272
01:25:03,513 --> 01:25:05,242
Where are you going?

1273
01:25:05,415 --> 01:25:08,509
The long swim. To China.

1274
01:25:11,421 --> 01:25:13,946
Mrs. Faulk, stop him.

1275
01:25:15,192 --> 01:25:16,989
Mrs. Faulk.

1276
01:25:18,095 --> 01:25:19,960
Mrs. Faulk, stop him.

1277
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:23,156
You must stop him. Please stop him.

1278
01:25:52,562 --> 01:25:54,052
Knock him out if you have to.

1279
01:25:54,431 --> 01:25:55,762
Hang one on him.

1280
01:26:13,183 --> 01:26:14,411
Baby.

1281
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:16,552
You've got the daddy of all spooks.

1282
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,449
This is a blue plate special.

1283
01:26:18,622 --> 01:26:22,285
- Let me out of here!
- You lie doggone now. Quiet down.

1284
01:26:22,459 --> 01:26:25,121
You know and I know that half this show
you're putting on...

1285
01:26:25,295 --> 01:26:27,957
...is playacting. Only trouble is,
sharks don't know that.

1286
01:26:28,131 --> 01:26:29,962
Let me loose.

1287
01:26:30,133 --> 01:26:34,433
Honey, you scared me out of seven years'
growth tonight, you ain't gonna do it again.

1288
01:26:34,604 --> 01:26:35,935
Mrs. Faulk?

1289
01:26:36,139 --> 01:26:39,233
I wonder if you'd mind
making a pot of this tea?

1290
01:26:39,409 --> 01:26:42,469
Miss Jelkes, does this strike you
as the right time for a tea party?

1291
01:26:42,646 --> 01:26:46,309
But this isn't ordinary tea. It's poppy
seed tea. It has a very calming effect.

1292
01:26:46,483 --> 01:26:47,575
Let me go!

1293
01:26:48,518 --> 01:26:51,487
- Tea, it's a hell of a solution.
- Please believe me, Mrs. Faulk.

1294
01:26:51,655 --> 01:26:54,522
I've had experience of someone
in Mr. Shannon's condition.

1295
01:26:54,691 --> 01:26:57,285
And I do know whereof I speak.

1296
01:26:58,295 --> 01:26:59,990
Untie me!

1297
01:27:02,866 --> 01:27:06,233
Poppy seed makes a mild
sedative drink...

1298
01:27:06,403 --> 01:27:10,669
...that helps you get through nights
that are hard for you to get through.

1299
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:13,903
We could all use some tonight.

1300
01:27:14,077 --> 01:27:15,408
Because for all of us...

1301
01:27:15,579 --> 01:27:19,037
...you, me, my grandfather...

1302
01:27:19,216 --> 01:27:21,207
...this won't be an easy night
to get through.

1303
01:27:21,385 --> 01:27:24,081
<i>Without a cry, without a prayer</i>

1304
01:27:24,254 --> 01:27:27,417
- <i>With no betrayal of despair</i>
- Untie me.

1305
01:27:27,591 --> 01:27:29,491
- Not yet.
- I'm panicking.

1306
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:31,422
- I know.
- A man can die of panic.

1307
01:27:31,595 --> 01:27:34,462
Not when he enjoys it as much
as you do, Mr. Shannon.

1308
01:27:34,631 --> 01:27:36,258
What do you mean by that insult?

1309
01:27:36,433 --> 01:27:40,494
You think I like being tied in this hammock,
trussed up like a hog in a slaughterhouse?

1310
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:44,936
No, who wouldn't like to atone
for the sins of themselves...

1311
01:27:45,108 --> 01:27:48,544
...and the world if it could be
done in a hammock with ropes...

1312
01:27:48,712 --> 01:27:51,704
...instead of on a cross with nails?

1313
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:54,146
On a green hilltop...

1314
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:58,651
...instead of on Golgotha,
the place of the skulls.

1315
01:27:59,089 --> 01:28:01,785
Isn't that a comparatively
comfortable...

1316
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:07,328
...almost voluptuous crucifixion to suffer
for the sins of the world, Mr. Shannon?

1317
01:28:07,497 --> 01:28:10,330
- Why have you turned against me?
- I haven't turned against you.

1318
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,298
Thought you were sexless, but you've
suddenly turned into a woman.

1319
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:14,630
You know how I know that?

1320
01:28:14,805 --> 01:28:18,263
Because you, not me, are taking
pleasure in my being tied up.

1321
01:28:18,442 --> 01:28:20,672
All women, whether they want
to face it or not...

1322
01:28:20,844 --> 01:28:22,971
...want to see a man
in a tied-up situation.

1323
01:28:23,146 --> 01:28:27,139
They spend their lives trying to get a man
into a tied-up situation.

1324
01:28:27,317 --> 01:28:30,252
Their lives are fulfilled when
they get as many men as they can...

1325
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:32,354
...into a tied-up situation.

1326
01:28:32,522 --> 01:28:35,958
I'd like to untie you right now,
but I can't.

1327
01:28:36,126 --> 01:28:37,718
You believe in people being tied up?

1328
01:28:37,894 --> 01:28:41,830
Only when they might take
the long swim to China.

1329
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:45,961
The long swim to China...

1330
01:28:46,136 --> 01:28:47,535
Shannon!

1331
01:28:47,704 --> 01:28:49,137
- Oh, yeah.
- Stop.

1332
01:28:49,306 --> 01:28:51,968
Stop it. Stop it, Shannon.

1333
01:28:52,175 --> 01:28:54,643
I'm gonna call Dr. Lopez.

1334
01:28:54,811 --> 01:28:58,076
And I'm gonna have you carted off
to the <i>Casa de Locos.</i>

1335
01:28:58,248 --> 01:29:00,682
- And you'll be put in a cell, alone!
- Off, off!

1336
01:29:00,851 --> 01:29:03,115
With hay on the floor and a bucket.
And that's all!

1337
01:29:03,286 --> 01:29:04,651
Off! Off! Off!

1338
01:29:04,821 --> 01:29:06,152
Off!

1339
01:29:06,323 --> 01:29:09,190
- Here, Mr. Shannon, drink this.
- Untie me!

1340
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:12,123
You can holler
and howl to your heart's content...

1341
01:29:12,295 --> 01:29:14,695
...in the <i>Casa de Locos.</i>
All day and all night.

1342
01:29:14,865 --> 01:29:18,665
I'm a citizen with inalienable rights. Get
me the consul. I demand to see the consul!

1343
01:29:18,835 --> 01:29:21,668
Please, Mr. Shannon,
drink this poppy seed tea.

1344
01:29:21,838 --> 01:29:24,398
How can I with the widow Faulk
sitting on me?

1345
01:29:24,574 --> 01:29:27,304
Here, give me that tea. I made it.
I'll give it to him.

1346
01:29:27,477 --> 01:29:29,707
Drink this, you buzzard!

1347
01:29:30,614 --> 01:29:32,673
It's scalding.

1348
01:29:32,849 --> 01:29:35,374
Thank you, Maxine.
That's all I needed.

1349
01:29:35,552 --> 01:29:37,349
To have my mouth burned raw.

1350
01:29:37,521 --> 01:29:40,684
Now, if you could put some splinters
of bamboo under my fingernails...

1351
01:29:40,857 --> 01:29:45,021
...and have my eyelids cut off...
- Mrs. Faulk, let me.

1352
01:29:45,328 --> 01:29:46,625
Okay, honey.

1353
01:29:46,796 --> 01:29:48,627
You take over completely.

1354
01:29:48,798 --> 01:29:50,459
He's entirely yours.

1355
01:29:50,634 --> 01:29:52,761
May I make a further suggestion,
Maxine?

1356
01:29:52,936 --> 01:29:55,598
Why don't you go moonlight bathing
with your beach boys.

1357
01:29:55,772 --> 01:30:00,573
Don't let my presence stop you, any more
than old Fred's presence used to stop you.

1358
01:30:01,144 --> 01:30:03,544
You bastard!

1359
01:30:04,281 --> 01:30:05,612
Pepe.

1360
01:30:05,782 --> 01:30:07,613
Pedro.

1361
01:30:08,919 --> 01:30:11,854
You no-good bastard!

1362
01:30:16,393 --> 01:30:18,918
That was cruel, Mr. Shannon.

1363
01:30:19,095 --> 01:30:20,892
Childishly cruel.

1364
01:30:21,064 --> 01:30:25,899
I can't stand for a person I respect
to behave like a small, cruel boy.

1365
01:30:26,069 --> 01:30:30,096
Now, what do you respect in me,
Miss Thin-Standing-Up-Female-Buddha?

1366
01:30:30,307 --> 01:30:32,867
I respect anybody who has had to...

1367
01:30:33,043 --> 01:30:35,739
...fight and howl for his decency.

1368
01:30:35,912 --> 01:30:39,109
- What decency?
- Yes. His decency.

1369
01:30:39,282 --> 01:30:40,510
And his...

1370
01:30:40,684 --> 01:30:42,345
His bit of goodness.

1371
01:30:42,519 --> 01:30:45,181
Far more than I respect
those lucky ones who've...

1372
01:30:45,355 --> 01:30:48,222
...had theirs handed out to them at birth...

1373
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:54,296
...and never afterwards snatched
away from them by unbearable torments.

1374
01:30:54,464 --> 01:30:56,864
<i>A chronicle no longer gold</i>

1375
01:30:57,734 --> 01:31:00,669
<i>A bargaining with mist and mold</i>

1376
01:31:00,837 --> 01:31:04,273
Listen to him,
saying them over and over.

1377
01:31:04,441 --> 01:31:06,932
The lines of his new poem.

1378
01:31:07,177 --> 01:31:10,635
Like a blind man climbing a staircase
that leads nowhere.

1379
01:31:10,814 --> 01:31:12,475
Should you be in there
helping him?

1380
01:31:12,649 --> 01:31:16,847
He'll call me when he needs me.
Drink this, Mr. Shannon.

1381
01:31:19,689 --> 01:31:22,385
I have no right to ask the question...

1382
01:31:22,559 --> 01:31:26,120
...but why did you go to such lengths
to protect Miss Fellowes...

1383
01:31:26,296 --> 01:31:28,389
...for whom you have no high regard...

1384
01:31:28,732 --> 01:31:32,998
...and to equal lengths to hurt Mrs. Faulk,
for whom you have?

1385
01:31:33,169 --> 01:31:35,137
Maxine's indestructible.

1386
01:31:35,305 --> 01:31:36,772
Is she?

1387
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:38,669
Or does she just give that impression?

1388
01:31:38,842 --> 01:31:42,243
The only impression Maxine
gives is herself. Maxine's Maxine.

1389
01:31:42,412 --> 01:31:46,542
And I'm a no-good bastard.
Lay it to the drink. I'm a bad drunk.

1390
01:31:46,716 --> 01:31:49,549
You were drunk when you came
to Miss Fellowes' rescue.

1391
01:31:49,986 --> 01:31:51,578
I got drunker.

1392
01:31:54,457 --> 01:31:57,085
Drink isn't your problem, Mr. Shannon.

1393
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,320
And what is my problem, Miss Jelkes?

1394
01:32:00,497 --> 01:32:02,624
The oldest one in the world.

1395
01:32:02,799 --> 01:32:06,200
The need to believe in someone,
or something.

1396
01:32:06,703 --> 01:32:09,604
Almost anyone. Almost anything.

1397
01:32:09,773 --> 01:32:13,072
- Your voice sounds hopeless about it.
- Oh, no, I'm not hopeless about it.

1398
01:32:13,243 --> 01:32:16,872
In fact, I've...
I've discovered something to believe in.

1399
01:32:17,547 --> 01:32:18,946
What?

1400
01:32:21,518 --> 01:32:24,851
Broken barriers between people.

1401
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:27,555
A wanting to help each other.

1402
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:29,418
Through nights like this.

1403
01:32:29,592 --> 01:32:31,617
One-night stands.

1404
01:32:32,495 --> 01:32:37,023
One-night communications
between them.

1405
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,134
On a veranda...

1406
01:32:39,302 --> 01:32:42,533
...outside their separate cubicles.

1407
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:46,873
You don't mean physically, do you?

1408
01:32:48,344 --> 01:32:50,869
- No.
- I didn't think you did.

1409
01:32:51,047 --> 01:32:57,247
<i>An intercourse not well-designed</i>
<i>For beings of a golden kind</i>

1410
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:00,514
<i>Whose native green must arch above</i>

1411
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:03,989
<i>The earth's obscene, corrupting love</i>

1412
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,287
Is that what you advocate for me?

1413
01:33:06,463 --> 01:33:09,523
Is that what you call a human
relationship, you and Grandpa there?

1414
01:33:09,799 --> 01:33:12,962
Yes, Mr. Shannon. Yes. Yes, I do.

1415
01:33:13,136 --> 01:33:16,503
We make a home for each other,
my grandfather and I.

1416
01:33:16,673 --> 01:33:19,870
Oh, I don't mean a regular home,
because...

1417
01:33:20,043 --> 01:33:22,273
...I don't regard a home as a...

1418
01:33:22,445 --> 01:33:25,346
As a place, a building...

1419
01:33:25,515 --> 01:33:27,506
...bricks, wood, stone.

1420
01:33:28,785 --> 01:33:30,650
I think of a home...

1421
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:34,051
...as something two people have
between them.

1422
01:33:34,224 --> 01:33:35,987
In which each can...

1423
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,855
...nest, rest...

1424
01:33:39,028 --> 01:33:41,121
...live in, emotionally speaking.

1425
01:33:41,297 --> 01:33:43,765
Does that make any sense to you,
Mr. Shannon?

1426
01:33:43,933 --> 01:33:45,525
Yes, but...

1427
01:33:45,702 --> 01:33:47,397
Well, go on. But what?

1428
01:33:48,605 --> 01:33:51,073
Oh, leave it, I'd only say something
to hurt you.

1429
01:33:52,008 --> 01:33:54,067
I'm not thin-skinned, Mr. Shannon.

1430
01:33:54,677 --> 01:33:57,908
Very well. When a bird builds a nest
to rest in and live in...

1431
01:33:58,081 --> 01:34:01,517
...he doesn't build it in a falling-down tree.
- I'm not a bird, Mr. Shannon.

1432
01:34:01,684 --> 01:34:05,381
He builds with an eye to the permanence
of the location, and for the purpose of...

1433
01:34:05,555 --> 01:34:08,285
...mating and propagating the species.

1434
01:34:08,458 --> 01:34:12,895
I still say I'm not a bird, Mr. Shannon.
I'm a human being.

1435
01:34:13,062 --> 01:34:16,554
And when one of that unique species...

1436
01:34:16,733 --> 01:34:18,792
...builds its nest in the heart of another...

1437
01:34:18,968 --> 01:34:21,766
...the questions of permanence
and propagation...

1438
01:34:21,938 --> 01:34:25,840
...aren't the first, or even
the last things to be considered.

1439
01:34:26,242 --> 01:34:28,767
What is important...

1440
01:34:28,978 --> 01:34:30,878
...is that one is never alone.

1441
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:23,829
You've been asking all the questions,
Miss Jelkes. May I ask one of you?

1442
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,060
Ask it. There's no limit on questions
here tonight.

1443
01:35:27,237 --> 01:35:28,670
And on answers?

1444
01:35:28,838 --> 01:35:32,604
None that I can think of, Mr. Shannon,
between you and me.

1445
01:35:32,775 --> 01:35:35,369
This, then, is the question.

1446
01:35:35,678 --> 01:35:37,873
Have you never in your life
had any kind of...

1447
01:35:38,047 --> 01:35:39,742
...love life?

1448
01:35:41,684 --> 01:35:43,777
Would you mind repeating the question?

1449
01:35:43,953 --> 01:35:49,118
Have you never in your life or travels
had any encounter with any experience of...

1450
01:35:49,292 --> 01:35:52,750
...what Larry the Crackpot
would describe as a love life?

1451
01:35:54,664 --> 01:35:57,428
There are worse things than chastity,
Mr. Shannon.

1452
01:35:58,001 --> 01:35:59,764
Yes, lunacy and death.

1453
01:35:59,936 --> 01:36:02,427
Well, if you don't want to answer
the question...

1454
01:36:02,772 --> 01:36:05,297
No, no, I don't mind answering.

1455
01:36:06,442 --> 01:36:07,841
Yes.

1456
01:36:08,011 --> 01:36:13,210
Yes. I have had two experiences...
Well, encounters with.

1457
01:36:13,783 --> 01:36:15,011
Two.

1458
01:36:15,485 --> 01:36:17,578
Yes, I said two.

1459
01:36:19,155 --> 01:36:20,645
When I was 16.

1460
01:36:21,491 --> 01:36:23,220
Sixteen.

1461
01:36:23,993 --> 01:36:25,984
Yes, 16.

1462
01:36:28,898 --> 01:36:31,196
When I was 16...

1463
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:33,869
...every Saturday I would go
to the Saturday matinee...

1464
01:36:34,037 --> 01:36:36,267
...at the Nantucket Movie Theater.

1465
01:36:36,439 --> 01:36:40,170
That was soon after my parents were
killed in an automobile accident...

1466
01:36:40,343 --> 01:36:42,675
...and I was very alone.

1467
01:36:43,446 --> 01:36:46,279
Well, one day a young man...

1468
01:36:46,449 --> 01:36:49,509
...sat down beside me
and pushed his knee against mine.

1469
01:36:50,219 --> 01:36:55,282
I moved over but he moved over too,
and continued the pressure.

1470
01:36:55,491 --> 01:36:57,550
I jumped up and screamed...

1471
01:36:57,727 --> 01:37:00,924
...and he was arrested
for molesting a minor.

1472
01:37:01,564 --> 01:37:03,532
Is he still in the Nantucket jail?

1473
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,968
No. No, I got him out.

1474
01:37:06,135 --> 01:37:09,002
I told the police it was a Garbo picture.

1475
01:37:09,205 --> 01:37:10,729
It was a Garbo picture.

1476
01:37:11,074 --> 01:37:13,269
And that I was just overexcited.

1477
01:37:13,443 --> 01:37:15,138
And the second?

1478
01:37:16,379 --> 01:37:20,042
The second experience
is much more recent.

1479
01:37:20,516 --> 01:37:25,249
Only four years ago,
when Nonno and I were in Hong Kong.

1480
01:37:26,522 --> 01:37:27,750
One evening...

1481
01:37:27,924 --> 01:37:31,325
...in the Palm Court of Cliff Hotel...

1482
01:37:31,494 --> 01:37:34,657
...we met this middle-aged, sort of...

1483
01:37:34,831 --> 01:37:37,766
...nondescript Australian salesman.

1484
01:37:37,934 --> 01:37:42,701
You know, plump, bald, spotted,
and terribly over-friendly.

1485
01:37:43,406 --> 01:37:46,239
I did a sketch of him
that was shamelessly flattering...

1486
01:37:46,409 --> 01:37:48,707
...for which he paid me
more than my usual price.

1487
01:37:48,878 --> 01:37:51,142
Ten Malayan dollars.

1488
01:37:51,547 --> 01:37:56,450
Then, he asked me out
in a sampan with him.

1489
01:37:57,053 --> 01:38:00,250
Well, he'd been so generous...

1490
01:38:00,423 --> 01:38:02,288
...I accepted.

1491
01:38:02,525 --> 01:38:03,958
I did.

1492
01:38:04,127 --> 01:38:05,424
I accepted.

1493
01:38:06,462 --> 01:38:08,987
Grandfather went up to bed.

1494
01:38:09,165 --> 01:38:11,861
And I went out in the sampan...

1495
01:38:12,035 --> 01:38:15,004
...with the Aussie underwear salesman.

1496
01:38:16,806 --> 01:38:19,798
I noticed he became more and more...

1497
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:22,043
What?

1498
01:38:22,812 --> 01:38:24,803
Agitated.

1499
01:38:25,681 --> 01:38:28,548
Well, finally, he leant towards me.

1500
01:38:28,718 --> 01:38:31,687
We were vis-a-vis in the sampan.

1501
01:38:31,854 --> 01:38:36,917
And he looked intensely and passionately
into my eyes and said:

1502
01:38:37,093 --> 01:38:40,654
"Miss Jelkes, would you do me a favor?

1503
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:43,321
Would you do something for me?"

1504
01:38:43,766 --> 01:38:45,757
"What?" I asked.

1505
01:38:45,968 --> 01:38:47,868
"Well," he said:

1506
01:38:48,037 --> 01:38:50,232
"If I turn my back...

1507
01:38:50,406 --> 01:38:52,874
...if I look the other way...

1508
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:58,747
...will you take off some piece
of your clothing and let me hold it?

1509
01:38:58,915 --> 01:39:00,507
Just hold it."

1510
01:39:01,017 --> 01:39:04,282
And what did you do in this situation?

1511
01:39:04,821 --> 01:39:06,812
I did as he asked.

1512
01:39:07,123 --> 01:39:08,784
And he kept his promise.

1513
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:12,621
He kept his back turned
until I said "Ready"...

1514
01:39:12,929 --> 01:39:15,625
...and threw him the piece of my clothing.

1515
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:19,358
But what did he do with it?

1516
01:39:19,769 --> 01:39:22,237
I don't know.
I looked the other way.

1517
01:39:23,005 --> 01:39:26,566
- And that experience, you call that a...?
- A love experience?

1518
01:39:26,742 --> 01:39:28,209
Yes, I do, Mr. Shannon.

1519
01:39:28,611 --> 01:39:32,547
That sad little, dirty little episode,
you call it a...

1520
01:39:32,715 --> 01:39:36,879
Sad, it certainly was for the poor little
man. But why do you call it dirty?

1521
01:39:39,322 --> 01:39:42,655
You mean
you weren't disgusted by it?

1522
01:39:42,825 --> 01:39:45,988
Nothing human disgusts me,
Mr. Shannon.

1523
01:39:46,162 --> 01:39:49,598
Unless it's unkind or violent.

1524
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,132
And I told you how...

1525
01:39:53,402 --> 01:39:55,165
How gentle he was.

1526
01:39:56,105 --> 01:39:59,268
Apologetic, shy.

1527
01:39:59,575 --> 01:40:01,770
And really very...

1528
01:40:02,378 --> 01:40:03,811
...well...

1529
01:40:04,614 --> 01:40:06,673
...delicate about it.

1530
01:40:09,018 --> 01:40:14,718
However, I do grant you
that it was rather on the fantastic level.

1531
01:40:15,525 --> 01:40:16,822
What are you doing?

1532
01:40:16,993 --> 01:40:18,585
Untying you.

1533
01:40:18,761 --> 01:40:20,729
Why? Why now?

1534
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:26,400
I think the spook is exorcised, Mr. Shannon.
You've ceased to struggle.

1535
01:40:26,569 --> 01:40:31,029
And acceptance of life is surely
the first requisite for living it.

1536
01:40:39,549 --> 01:40:43,815
Who was the person you told Maxine
you'd helped through a crackup like this?

1537
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,447
Oh, that.

1538
01:40:48,124 --> 01:40:49,853
Myself.

1539
01:40:51,127 --> 01:40:52,992
Oh. Oh, you?

1540
01:40:53,429 --> 01:40:55,158
Oh, yes.

1541
01:40:55,765 --> 01:40:58,791
I had a spook like yours once.

1542
01:40:59,035 --> 01:41:01,833
I just had a different name for him.

1543
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:05,469
I used to call him the "blue devil."

1544
01:41:05,641 --> 01:41:10,806
- And we had quite a contest between us.
- Which you...

1545
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,572
Which you won.

1546
01:41:13,149 --> 01:41:15,743
I couldn't afford to lose.

1547
01:41:16,219 --> 01:41:19,985
How did you...?
How did you beat this blue devil of yours?

1548
01:41:20,356 --> 01:41:22,551
I showed him I could endure him.

1549
01:41:22,725 --> 01:41:26,126
- And made him respect my endurance.
- How?

1550
01:41:26,862 --> 01:41:29,194
Just by enduring.

1551
01:41:29,365 --> 01:41:32,766
Endurance is something that spooks
and blue devils respect.

1552
01:41:32,935 --> 01:41:35,267
And they respect all the tricks...

1553
01:41:35,438 --> 01:41:39,374
...that panicky people use to outwit
and outlast their panic.

1554
01:41:39,542 --> 01:41:42,773
Like taking a few deep,
deep breaths?

1555
01:41:42,945 --> 01:41:45,175
Or rum-cocos.

1556
01:41:45,681 --> 01:41:49,139
Or even beach boys.

1557
01:41:49,452 --> 01:41:53,013
Anything. Everything we do
to give them the slip.

1558
01:41:53,189 --> 01:41:56,158
So keep on going.

1559
01:41:56,325 --> 01:41:57,815
To where?

1560
01:41:59,829 --> 01:42:02,525
To somewhere like this, perhaps.

1561
01:42:03,699 --> 01:42:07,362
After long and difficult travels...

1562
01:42:07,536 --> 01:42:11,836
...the subterranean travels
that the spooked and bedeviled take...

1563
01:42:12,008 --> 01:42:16,877
...through the unlighted sides of
their own natures until finally...

1564
01:42:17,046 --> 01:42:19,514
...they see a faint gray light.

1565
01:42:19,682 --> 01:42:22,344
And keep climbing towards it.

1566
01:42:22,785 --> 01:42:25,083
Are you still following
that faint gray light?

1567
01:42:25,254 --> 01:42:28,712
Any light is a good light to see by
at the end of a long, dark tunnel...

1568
01:42:28,891 --> 01:42:31,519
...that you thought would be
never-ending.

1569
01:42:31,694 --> 01:42:36,063
That only God or death
could put a stop to.

1570
01:42:36,232 --> 01:42:38,496
Especially when you...

1571
01:42:39,435 --> 01:42:43,599
Since I was
far from sure about God.

1572
01:42:43,806 --> 01:42:45,933
Are you still unsure about him?

1573
01:42:47,343 --> 01:42:50,278
Not as unsure as I was.

1574
01:42:55,184 --> 01:42:57,345
He's still struggling.

1575
01:42:59,422 --> 01:43:02,880
Yes. He's got to the end of his rope.

1576
01:43:03,059 --> 01:43:04,890
And any further, he cannot get.

1577
01:43:05,061 --> 01:43:09,691
Can you honestly tell me
that he is not able to feel pain and panic?

1578
01:43:09,865 --> 01:43:14,063
- You mean, he's one of God's creatures?
- Yes, if you want to put it that way.

1579
01:43:15,004 --> 01:43:18,496
Mr. Shannon, cut him loose.

1580
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:22,500
All right.

1581
01:43:22,912 --> 01:43:27,315
We'll play God tonight, like kids play houses
with old broken crates and boxes.

1582
01:43:27,483 --> 01:43:30,350
We'll cut the lizard loose
so that he can go back to his bushes.

1583
01:43:30,519 --> 01:43:34,319
Because God won't do it
and we are playing God here tonight.

1584
01:43:41,063 --> 01:43:42,690
Mr. Shannon.

1585
01:43:52,742 --> 01:43:54,175
I knew you'd do that.

1586
01:44:06,389 --> 01:44:09,017
What the hell are you doing, Shannon?

1587
01:44:13,662 --> 01:44:17,291
I just cut loose one of God's creatures
at the end of his rope.

1588
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,995
What for?

1589
01:44:20,336 --> 01:44:23,134
So that one of God's creatures
could be free from panic...

1590
01:44:23,305 --> 01:44:27,571
...and scamper home safe and free.
A little act of grace, Maxine.

1591
01:44:28,511 --> 01:44:30,945
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!
Where are you?

1592
01:44:31,113 --> 01:44:33,980
Here, Grandfather.
Right here.

1593
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:39,417
It finished! Quick, before I forget it,
pencil and paper. Hurry, please!

1594
01:44:46,529 --> 01:44:49,589
- Ready?
- Yes. All ready, Grandfather.

1595
01:44:51,367 --> 01:44:55,201
<i>How calmly does the olive branch</i>

1596
01:44:56,205 --> 01:44:59,663
<i>Observe the sky begin to blanch</i>

1597
01:45:00,342 --> 01:45:03,470
<i>Without a cry, without a prayer</i>

1598
01:45:04,113 --> 01:45:07,173
<i>With no betrayal of despair</i>

1599
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:13,187
<i>Some time while night obscures the tree</i>

1600
01:45:13,756 --> 01:45:17,123
<i>The zenith of its life will be</i>

1601
01:45:17,293 --> 01:45:20,091
<i>Gone past forever</i>

1602
01:45:20,863 --> 01:45:23,127
<i>And from thence</i>

1603
01:45:23,766 --> 01:45:27,702
<i>A second history will commence</i>

1604
01:45:28,671 --> 01:45:31,970
<i>A chronicle no longer gold</i>

1605
01:45:32,341 --> 01:45:36,072
<i>A bargaining with mist and mold</i>

1606
01:45:36,745 --> 01:45:40,408
<i>And finally, the broken stem</i>

1607
01:45:40,983 --> 01:45:42,814
<i>The plummeting to earth</i>

1608
01:45:43,586 --> 01:45:47,283
<i>And then, an intercourse</i>

1609
01:45:47,456 --> 01:45:52,359
<i>Not well designed for beings</i>
<i>Of a golden kind</i>

1610
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:55,286
<i>Whose native green must arch above</i>

1611
01:45:55,464 --> 01:45:59,457
<i>The earth's obscene, corrupting love</i>

1612
01:46:00,503 --> 01:46:03,995
<i>And still the ripe fruit and the branch</i>

1613
01:46:04,173 --> 01:46:08,041
<i>Observe the sky begin to blanch</i>

1614
01:46:08,811 --> 01:46:11,871
<i>Without a cry, without a prayer</i>

1615
01:46:12,948 --> 01:46:16,384
<i>With no betrayal of despair</i>

1616
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,647
<i>Oh, courage</i>

1617
01:46:20,589 --> 01:46:24,992
<i>Could you not as well</i>
<i>Select a second place to dwell</i>

1618
01:46:26,495 --> 01:46:29,692
<i>Not only in that golden tree</i>

1619
01:46:30,799 --> 01:46:34,758
<i>But in the frightened heart of me?</i>

1620
01:46:37,239 --> 01:46:39,366
Have you got that, Hannah?

1621
01:46:40,309 --> 01:46:42,243
Yes, Grandfather.

1622
01:46:42,411 --> 01:46:45,539
- All of it?
- Every word.

1623
01:46:46,482 --> 01:46:49,610
- And it's finished?
- Yes.

1624
01:46:49,785 --> 01:46:54,518
- Finally finished?
- Yes, finally finished.

1625
01:46:55,024 --> 01:46:56,685
And it's good.

1626
01:46:57,459 --> 01:46:59,222
Beautiful.

1627
01:47:00,029 --> 01:47:04,193
- Is it good?
- Beautiful, Grandfather.

1628
01:47:05,568 --> 01:47:08,969
Oh, Grandfather, I'm so happy for you.

1629
01:47:09,371 --> 01:47:12,602
Thank you for writing such a lovely poem.

1630
01:47:12,975 --> 01:47:15,273
It was worth the long wait.

1631
01:47:17,713 --> 01:47:20,682
Can you sleep a little now?

1632
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:23,380
I'll fetch your shawl.

1633
01:47:24,186 --> 01:47:26,677
I'd like to pray now.

1634
01:47:56,518 --> 01:47:58,213
Oh, God.

1635
01:48:00,456 --> 01:48:03,857
Please can't we stop now?

1636
01:48:37,192 --> 01:48:39,092
He won't need the shawl.

1637
01:48:40,029 --> 01:48:43,692
God has played God
and set him free.

1638
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,318
<i>Oh, courage</i>

1639
01:49:14,163 --> 01:49:15,858
<i>Could you not as well</i>

1640
01:49:16,031 --> 01:49:18,727
<i>Have found a second place to dwell</i>

1641
01:49:20,102 --> 01:49:22,161
<i>Not only in that golden tree</i>

1642
01:49:23,672 --> 01:49:27,403
<i>But in the frightened heart of me?</i>

1643
01:50:07,216 --> 01:50:08,683
Miss Jelkes.

1644
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:12,144
What are you doing?
You're not gonna leave us today, are you?

1645
01:50:12,321 --> 01:50:15,654
There's no reason to delay.
Everything has been done.

1646
01:50:15,824 --> 01:50:18,486
Thanks to your kindness
and Mrs. Faulk's...

1647
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:21,823
...Dr. Lopez and all the good people
in the village.

1648
01:50:27,803 --> 01:50:31,330
I know now why he insisted
we go on with this trip.

1649
01:50:31,507 --> 01:50:32,997
He knew it was the end.

1650
01:50:33,175 --> 01:50:37,009
And he wanted it to come where he could
be buried peacefully on a green hilltop...

1651
01:50:37,179 --> 01:50:40,444
...within sight and sound of the sea,
his "cradle of life."

1652
01:50:41,383 --> 01:50:44,250
- You're going on, are you?
- Yes, naturally.

1653
01:50:44,419 --> 01:50:46,853
- Where?
- Well, first I shall go into town...

1654
01:50:47,022 --> 01:50:48,489
...and try my luck in the plaza.

1655
01:50:48,657 --> 01:50:50,386
What luck do you expect in the plaza?

1656
01:50:50,559 --> 01:50:54,757
Do you expect the old lady selling tacos
to buy your sketches like hotcakes?

1657
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:58,832
There'll be some tourists, and I shall give
them what is known as the "hard sell."

1658
01:50:59,001 --> 01:51:01,834
Miss Jelkes, you're not operating
on the realistic level.

1659
01:51:02,004 --> 01:51:04,837
Yes, I am. We are operating
on a realistic level...

1660
01:51:05,007 --> 01:51:07,407
...when we are doing the things
that have to be done.

1661
01:51:07,576 --> 01:51:12,673
But you can't go on alone. Think of how
it will feel after so many years.

1662
01:51:13,248 --> 01:51:15,876
I shall know how it feels when I feel it.

1663
01:51:16,618 --> 01:51:18,916
Miss Jelkes, I wonder...

1664
01:51:19,788 --> 01:51:21,688
Yes. What do you wonder?

1665
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:24,058
Well, I was wondering...

1666
01:51:24,226 --> 01:51:28,560
...if it was possible for us
to travel together.

1667
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:31,255
I mean, travel together.

1668
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,729
Do you really think we could?

1669
01:51:33,902 --> 01:51:38,737
I don't see why not,
both of us sort of at loose ends.

1670
01:51:39,508 --> 01:51:45,913
I feel sure the impracticality of it
would be all too clear to you later.

1671
01:51:46,315 --> 01:51:49,751
I think it would only prove awkward
and embarrassing for both of us.

1672
01:51:49,918 --> 01:51:52,045
- Miss Jelkes...
- I wonder if Mrs. Faulk is about?

1673
01:51:52,221 --> 01:51:54,985
- I would like to thank her.
- Yeah.

1674
01:51:55,724 --> 01:51:59,524
She's about.
And about to make an announcement.

1675
01:51:59,695 --> 01:52:01,663
Sit down, you two.

1676
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:03,522
Sit down.

1677
01:52:09,538 --> 01:52:12,530
I got a proposition to make,
a business proposition.

1678
01:52:12,708 --> 01:52:14,767
You know, Miss Jelkes, honey,
you impress me.

1679
01:52:15,043 --> 01:52:18,137
Very favorably. The way
you dished up that fish and all.

1680
01:52:18,313 --> 01:52:22,340
So favorably, in fact, that I'm prepared
to make you the following proposition.

1681
01:52:23,085 --> 01:52:24,950
What proposition, Mrs. Faulk?

1682
01:52:25,921 --> 01:52:27,684
I want a Coke.

1683
01:52:30,826 --> 01:52:32,851
Beer. Beer!

1684
01:52:38,333 --> 01:52:41,564
My proposition is this:
that you take over here.

1685
01:52:42,371 --> 01:52:45,397
The place furnishes a living
plus a neat little profit.

1686
01:52:45,874 --> 01:52:50,641
I take in about 4000 a year,
after expenses.

1687
01:52:50,812 --> 01:52:52,439
Four thousand dollars.

1688
01:52:52,614 --> 01:52:55,139
It wouldn't surprise me
if you couldn't do even better...

1689
01:52:55,317 --> 01:52:59,083
...provided Shannon there
didn't drink up your share of the profits.

1690
01:53:00,255 --> 01:53:01,654
Well, that's the deal.

1691
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:04,158
We split the profits fifty-fifty.

1692
01:53:04,326 --> 01:53:07,193
Even-steven.
Share and share alike.

1693
01:53:07,362 --> 01:53:09,330
Does that make any sense to you?

1694
01:53:10,532 --> 01:53:13,160
Maxine. Are you all right?

1695
01:53:13,435 --> 01:53:16,233
Of course I'm all right.
What do you mean, am I all right?

1696
01:53:16,405 --> 01:53:20,899
My only reason for including you
on this deal is a man's presence is required.

1697
01:53:21,076 --> 01:53:25,775
There's gotta be a man. That's one of
the basic principles of hotel administration.

1698
01:53:25,948 --> 01:53:29,008
There's gotta be a man to make
the place attractive to the ladies.

1699
01:53:29,184 --> 01:53:31,414
Wives of the men that go fishing.

1700
01:53:31,787 --> 01:53:34,688
Matter of fact, my offer is contingent
on the presence of a man.

1701
01:53:34,856 --> 01:53:38,121
- There's no deal unless Shannon stays on.
- What about you, Mrs. Faulk?

1702
01:53:38,293 --> 01:53:40,693
Me? I'm fed up with this place.

1703
01:53:40,862 --> 01:53:43,626
Fed up to the teeth, into the gums
and the jawbone.

1704
01:53:43,799 --> 01:53:46,199
- Jungle rot's set in.
- Where are you going?

1705
01:53:46,368 --> 01:53:49,565
Well, I'm not going on any
of your Blake Tours, that's for sure!

1706
01:53:49,738 --> 01:53:51,399
I'm heading north.

1707
01:53:51,974 --> 01:53:54,340
El Paso, maybe. Yeah, I like El Paso.

1708
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:57,244
Air-conditioned cocktail lounges.

1709
01:53:57,412 --> 01:54:01,815
Fifteen-to-one martinis and mirrors that
don't scare you when they look at you!

1710
01:54:02,084 --> 01:54:06,282
You know, I'm a young woman. Attractive,
too, if I can get to a decent beauty parlor.

1711
01:54:06,455 --> 01:54:10,118
Don't you worry about the widow Faulk.
She'll have a ball!

1712
01:54:13,795 --> 01:54:16,821
- Fantastic.
- Yes, Mr. Shannon.

1713
01:54:16,999 --> 01:54:18,830
Fantastic is what it is.

1714
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:23,030
You were building your nest
and you didn't even know it.

1715
01:54:23,505 --> 01:54:25,200
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1716
01:54:25,374 --> 01:54:28,571
- At least let me drive you into town.
- No, thank you, I prefer to walk.

1717
01:54:28,744 --> 01:54:33,044
What you could do for me, though,
is have my luggage sent in after me.

1718
01:54:33,281 --> 01:54:35,647
Oh, I almost forgot.

1719
01:54:35,817 --> 01:54:40,618
I found this in the pocket of my smock
when I was packing this morning.

1720
01:54:40,789 --> 01:54:43,314
Yes, I want you to have it.

1721
01:54:43,492 --> 01:54:45,517
I couldn't possibly accept,
Mr. Shannon.

1722
01:54:45,694 --> 01:54:49,130
No, take it, please. Hock it.
It'll pay your way back to the States.

1723
01:54:49,297 --> 01:54:50,628
That's a real amethyst...

1724
01:54:50,799 --> 01:54:54,394
...so don't let the local loan shark
give you less than 1800 pesos for it.

1725
01:54:54,569 --> 01:54:57,629
Its value has been well-established
over the years.

1726
01:54:58,807 --> 01:55:00,638
Very well, Mr. Shannon.

1727
01:55:00,809 --> 01:55:03,972
I'll send the pawn ticket
back to you so that you can redeem it.

1728
01:55:55,564 --> 01:55:58,328
- What are you doing, Maxine?
- Packing.

1729
01:56:03,405 --> 01:56:04,929
Go on, fall apart.

1730
01:56:05,373 --> 01:56:08,740
Everything's falling apart,
including you and Shannon!

1731
01:56:09,044 --> 01:56:12,036
Complimentary rum-coco.
It's a speciality of the Costa Verde.

1732
01:56:12,214 --> 01:56:16,378
I don't want a rum-coco. If I wanted
a rum-coco, I'd make a rum-coco.

1733
01:56:18,687 --> 01:56:22,885
She's gone, Maxine.
The poem's finished.

1734
01:56:24,359 --> 01:56:27,522
You mean she's not gonna
take me up on my proposition?

1735
01:56:28,330 --> 01:56:30,855
Oh, she's not.

1736
01:56:31,867 --> 01:56:33,266
I am.

1737
01:56:34,202 --> 01:56:35,760
That is, if you...

1738
01:56:36,204 --> 01:56:39,605
If you really need a man around here.

1739
01:57:05,233 --> 01:57:10,136
It's not hot yet, Shannon.
Why don't we go down to the beach.

1740
01:57:10,839 --> 01:57:12,397
Well, I can...

1741
01:57:12,841 --> 01:57:16,277
I can get down the hill, Maxine,
but I'm not too sure about getting...

1742
01:57:16,444 --> 01:57:17,968
...back up.

1743
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:23,549
I'll get you back up, baby.
I'll always get you back up.

1744
01:57:35,063 --> 01:57:37,054
