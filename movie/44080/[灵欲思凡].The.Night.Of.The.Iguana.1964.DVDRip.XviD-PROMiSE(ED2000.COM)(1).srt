1
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,179
愿我口中的言语，

2
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:28,281
...在你面前总是可以接受的。

3
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,817
主啊，我的力量......

4
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,046
......和我的救赎。

5
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,696
今天讲道...

6
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:45,231
......从箴言服用。

7
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,930
第25章...

8
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:50,095
...... 28节。

9
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:53,876
“他的人有过自己的精神没有规则...

10
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:58,707
...就像一个城市，被分解，

11
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:03,715
我不知道当我们审视我们的心

12
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,988
......我们有多少人在这里可以说，

13
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,720
对于如何弱的人。

14
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,659
我们多久？

15
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,332
多久...

16
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:22,204
我们是否经常从流浪

17
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:26,801
因为只有当我们住在主

18
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:30,309
只有这样，我们才能保护自己

19
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,341
我们不能排除自己孤单。

20
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,914
只有上帝是我们的...是我们...

21
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,119
只有上帝是我们的帮助。

22
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,550
而我们的救赎。

23
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,422
好吧！你懂！

24
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,895
这就是为什么你在这里！

25
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,264
“每当两个或三个

26
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,770
...就是圣经上说。

27
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:01,535
让我们改变的话。让我们重写

28
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:05,670
每当两个或三个或20或30

29
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,283
...聚集在一起

30
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:12,751
...在审判坐

31
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,514
是的，上帝的人。

32
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:18,421
我说，神人，我的意思吧！

33
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:22,697
究竟是什么大家都知道，你的牧师，

34
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:28,133
是一个牧师的后裔，

35
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:32,138
但也有侧枝的

36
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:33,832
...和谁是黄牛。

37
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,777
男和男的心，

38
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:41,881
他们知道饥饿

39
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:46,920
他们喂养他们的胃口。

40
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,158
我不怕你！香违抗你！

41
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:54,785
走出你的战斧！

42
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,161
提高你的刀倒票！我的头皮！

43
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:03,567
我不会，无法继续进行

44
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,732
...愤怒，暴躁的老人

45
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,107
你把你的背部上的神
爱心和同情心的...

46
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,681
...并发明了自己
这个残酷的，老年欠费...

47
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,412
...谁指责世界，所有的
他为自己的错误产生。

48
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,650
闭上你的窗户！关闭你的门！

49
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:25,123
关闭你的心
对神的真理！

50
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,133
你好。

51
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:26,111
- 他们在哪？
- 还有教堂里。

52
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,273
我生病了暗古老的教堂。

53
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,510
我喜欢阳光。

54
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:37,220
对不起。我一直忘了什么
你之前是。我的意思是，你是什么。
55
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:38,724
什么？

56
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,262
可爱，不是吗？

57
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,664
- 是啊。
- 你再打电话吗？

58
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,630
“黄金杯”。
你可以从它喝，真的吗？

59
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:56,601
香槟两个人到<I>杯 - 德奥罗</ I>。

60
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:05,382
- 香农博士。
- 费洛斯小姐。在这里，您是，皮布尔斯小姐。

61
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:09,656
同一品牌甚至。
修复您在任何时间。

62
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,853
- 哦，我很感激。我欠你多少？
- 六比索五十。

63
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,261
但当时只有六比索
在菊城EZr。

64
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:21,767
菊城在我们身后1200英里，
费洛斯小姐。

65
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,374
我认为这是过了头去
节省4美分。

66
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:28,772
我认为这是过了头去
节省4美分。

67
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,589
- 我们是心灰意冷？
- 号

68
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,992
太棒了！

69
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,946
你看到了吗？

70
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,383
看。还有另一种。

71
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,525
有什么那些男孩了，香农博士？

72
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:53,219
绿鬣蜥。巨型蜥蜴本土
墨西哥的这一部分。

73
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,263
据称它们的味道像鸡肉。

74
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:02,064
你的意思是他们真的
吃那些可怕的前瞻性的生物？

75
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,165
- 汉克，停在桥上。
- 停止？

76
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,674
是啊，在桥上。

77
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,634
什么是我们停下来？

78
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,797
美丽的时刻，费洛斯小姐。

79
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:42,302
一个短暂的一瞥
到失落的世界...


80
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,309
......无辜的。

81
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:54,947
你看，牧师，
我们进度落后了。


82
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:57,225
驱动上，司机。


83
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:00,154
好的。

84
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:05,589
我在阿比林的哥哥，
这就是克拉伦斯Throxton ...

85
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:08,703
......有23洗衣店链。

86
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,671
他说，所有他想要的
在他的墓碑是：


87
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,710
“他解放了得克萨斯州的妇女
从洗一天的束缚“。


88
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,642
他们不是不可思议？

89
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:22,978
发牢骚，发牢骚，发牢骚，
自从我们开始。


90
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:27,145
如果他们想要的所有舒适的家，
那么他们为什么不留在家里？

91
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:30,952
我的妈呀，这一直是
一个丰富的经验。


92
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,321
它肯定有。


93
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:34,520
一切都错了
从第一天开始。


94
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:39,191
书中的每个灾难。
整个行程已经hoodooed。

95
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:42,931
你最好马上回来，古多尔小姐，
你来自哪里。

96
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,335
你说这将是夏洛特。


97
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,601
好吧。夏洛特。

98
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:52,942
- 我不能去给你打电话香农博士。
- 只是“香”将被罚款。

99
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:57,284
难道不是很拉里，
如果你要叫我夏洛？


100
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,920
亲爱的，有心脏。

101
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,956
我有，拉里。我刚刚发现。

102
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,855
现在你改变的地方和我在一起，
夏洛特，亲爱的。


103
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:10,064
我想跟香农博士
我们的行程。

104
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:15,502
后来我去看看你，拉里。

105
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:24,003
我想你知道，夏洛特
是未成年，香农博士？
106
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,910
什么那跟我们的行程呢？

107
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,677
如果你知道什么是对你有好处，
放过她。

108
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:33,049
费洛斯小姐，你知道你是
讲一个牧师剃度？

109
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:34,985
停止导致她。

110
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:38,991
我不知道发生了什么回来
在火卡连特，我也不想知道。

111
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,220
因为如果我知道，
我不得不采取措施。


112
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,297
不要让我采取措施，
香农博士。

113
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,866
现在，什么都没有发生
早在火卡连特。


114
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:50,369
房间登记员拿到了钥匙混在一起，
就这样。一个错误，纯粹而简单。

115
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,474
不管怀疑你可能窝藏
相当空穴来风。

116
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:55,837
我可以向你保证，你。


117
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,778
刚刚离开她。
不要让我采取措施。


118
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:04,081
好了，女孩，准备另一首歌曲？


119
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:51,493
这些药丸是不是做了我什么。
没有什么！


120
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,378
- 刺。
- 吹熄。

121
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,776
烧坏的制动衬片。

122
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:07,973
残破的风扇皮带，三爆胎。

123
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,914
这些都是不可避免的灾祸
任何行程，费洛斯小姐。


124
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:13,384
将不会超过几分钟
改变车轮。

125
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:16,181
说你，可敬的。
我们刚从车轮改变。


126
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,816
我们得拿到过的轮胎，换上
一个补丁。就拿也许半小时。

127
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:22,122
你照顾它对于我来说，汉克。

128
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,657
朱迪思！

129
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:29,032
- 我需要你！
- 哦，没事，Peebie。

130
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,096
它的可爱，不是吗？

131
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,398
是啊。

132
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:01,300
你真的是布，拉里的一个人吗？

133
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,962
- 谁说我不是？
- 没有人。我只是想知道。

134
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,835
你怎么能问这样的问题？

135
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,274
不布雷克的旅游宣传之旅
亲手所进行的...

136
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,676
...牧师T.劳伦斯香？

137
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,646
他们可以做出这样的索赔
没有正当理由？

138
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,718
我很高兴你。

139
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,752
你是什??么意思？

140
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:23,283
那么，它的这种高尚生活。

141
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:26,917
我的意思是，作为感兴趣的人们的灵魂
和所有。

142
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,760
你可以把这么多的人。

143
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,763
像我这样连。

144
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,164
我可以和你谈谈。

145
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:38,466
就像，我从来没有梦想去游泳
与牧师霍奇基斯回了家。

146
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:39,972
我的意思是，他是老了。


147
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,508
现在，躺在后座上，Peebie。
把你的脚。


148
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:51,517
- 司机，你见过古德尔小姐？
- 是的，我见过她。

149
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:54,019
好？好吧，她在哪里？

150
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,056
他得到了她。在那里。

151
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,434
夏洛特。


152
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:14,606
夏洛特。

153
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:16,972
夏洛特。

154
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,837
夏洛特。

155
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:21,480
- There was this boy back home.
- Charlotte.

156
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,413
He thought he was in love with me.

157
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:27,181
- Really, he made life just impossible.
- Charlotte.

158
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,824
So Daddy fixed it for me to take a trip.

159
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,325
Naturally, he wanted me to be
chaperoned in a strange country.

160
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,929
- Charlotte!
- Life's so odd.

161
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:38,896
- Yeah.
- lf it hadn't been for that silly boy...

162
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,332
...I might never have met you.

163
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,666
- Charlotte!
- Take my hand, Larry.

164
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,068
What for?

165
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:48,334
So we don't drift apart.

166
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:53,242
Charlotte, I command you
to come back here.

167
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,279
Charlotte Goodall.

168
00:15:57,806 --> 00:16:00,050
You only got to come on this trip
because of me!

169
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:04,715
Charlotte. Charlotte, you hear me?

170
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:09,789
Charlotte, I know you can hear me.
You are deliberately defying me.

171
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:14,231
Charlotte!
Charlotte! You stay away from that man!

172
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,465
You hear?

173
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:19,831
Charlotte, your mother put you
in my charge.

174
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:22,739
I am responsible. Charlotte!

175
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,747
You only got to come on this trip
because of me!

176
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:30,014
Charlotte!

177
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:41,622
Why, Miss Fellowes.

178
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,264
Dreadful girl.

179
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:48,326
Defied me.
You deliberately defied me!

180
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,938
What did you think we were doing
out there, Miss Fellowes? Spawning?

181
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:56,942
Oh, you beast! You beast!

182
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,512
You beast.

183
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,835
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
You... You get out of here!

184
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,173
- My God, it's 3:00 in the morning.
- I've got to see you.

185
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:14,611
- It's important. My whole life's at stake.
- Oh, well, my job's at stake.

186
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:17,343
You don't have to worry
about this measly old job.

187
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:21,148
My goodness. Back home, my daddy's
got three Ford agencies.

188
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:23,655
At the moment, I don't see a Ford
in my future.

189
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,225
Have you been drinking, Larry?

190
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,057
Honey girl, if I'd been drinking,
I wouldn't be here. I'd still be drinking.

191
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,200
Then what's wrong?
Why are you all hot and sweaty?

192
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:36,463
You won't misunderstand me, I mean,
my being here in your room.

193
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,265
Promise me you won't think...

194
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,400
That boy back home told me
that I had skin that no girl had any right to.

195
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,508
Said it should be licensed to have skin
as soft as mine is.

196
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:49,207
- Wasn't it silly of him?
- No.

197
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:51,579
Yes. I mean, no, no.
No, it should be licensed.

198
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,189
I mean, at least until you're...
Until you're old enough...

199
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:59,384
...for a driver's license. Now, you get out
of my room. You get off my bed.

200
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:03,588
I'll... I'll keep my eyes
shut until you've gone out of my room.

201
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,767
- Have I grown up too early, Larry?
- Yes. No, I mean... Yes, yes.

202
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,234
O Lord, lead me not into temptation.

203
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:14,205
And now, go on home.
I'll find my way all by myself.

204
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:17,243
- That's what I came to tell you.
- What?

205
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:18,879
I'm going home.

206
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,447
Tomorrow, from Puerto Vallarta.

207
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,245
I'm catching the plane at Puerto Vallarta.

208
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:29,356
I'll slip away from that possessive old bitch
while she's having her siesta...

209
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,685
...and be gone before she knows it.

210
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,589
You mustn't tell her where I've gone.

211
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,559
Let her sweat it a little.

212
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:39,223
Let her think
I've just disappeared into the jungle.

213
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:41,232
But I couldn't let you worry.

214
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:43,462
I had to say goodbye to you...

215
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,698
...or rather, au revoir.

216
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:48,707
Because when you bring them back...

217
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:51,175
...l'll be there waiting for you...

218
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:55,180
... copa de oro in my hair,
just over the border.

219
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,842
Honey, the border I'm crossing over
is the border of sanity, honey.

220
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,989
- No.
- Oh, honey, yes.

221
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,783
I've got it figured out, darling.

222
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,392
What you should have is a nice big church
in Thunderbird Heights...

223
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:07,960
Daddy's a big wheel there.

224
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,258
- and a wife who understands
the nobility of your mission.

225
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:15,335
- No, no.
- Yes, not no. I'll fix it. Daddy will fix it.

226
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,267
- No.
- Yes.

227
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:19,839
"He that hath no rule
over his own spirit is like a...

228
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,101
...city that has broken down
and without walls."

229
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:24,006
I'll rule your spirit.

230
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,407
I'll hold you.

231
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,107
- No. No, no. No.
- Yes. Yes, yes.

232
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,289
Charlotte.

233
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:48,059
Charlotte...

234
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,134
...l've told you how sorry I am.

235
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,400
You can afford to be generous.

236
00:21:56,431 --> 00:22:00,438
I was just beside myself with anger.

237
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:05,477
But I never meant to harm you.

238
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:10,658
I wouldn't harm you for all the world.

239
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,252
Charlotte.

240
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:21,169
Charlotte, you've got to forgive me.
I can't stand being so unhappy.

241
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:30,106
Shannon?

242
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:31,945
Shannon, open the door.

243
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,638
You hear me, Shannon.

244
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:36,477
You've got that child in there.
Open up right now.

245
00:22:36,738 --> 00:22:39,881
I've had it. She'll tell my father,
she'll tell everybody.

246
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,056
He's got her in there with him.
The door's locked.

247
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,291
Nobody's mixed any keys up this time.
I won't have it. I just won't have it.

248
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,437
You're through, Shannon.

249
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,836
And I'll see to that.

250
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:04,240
When I finish with you,
there won't be any place left to hide.

251
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:07,814
It's all right, Miss Fellowes.
Virtue is triumphant. Yours, of course.

252
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:11,475
Wait. Just you wait.

253
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:42,279
Good morning. We have a wonderful
trip ahead of us.

254
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:45,011
Some of the most beautiful
scenery in this part of Mexico.

255
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:48,156
I took the liberty of getting souvenirs
of our stay in Los Feliz.

256
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,881
I love you.

257
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,187
No charge. Compliments of the
Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon.

258
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,896
Miss Peebles.

259
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:12,507
Where's Miss Fellowes?

260
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,946
You think you could pull a stunt
like last night and get away with it?

261
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:18,177
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's in the fan.

262
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,914
This morning,
she had a wire all written out...

263
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:23,353
...to some Judge Fellowes back in Texas.

264
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,289
She wants your life story
from the first time you said "Mama."

265
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:29,259
- How do you know that?
- She asked me to send it, that's how.

266
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:32,366
I told her that was no part
of no driver's job.

267
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,765
- Good man, Hank.
- You ain't off the hook.

268
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:39,134
Miss Fellowes went over
to Telegrfico herself.

269
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,440
She aims to have your hide, Reverend.

270
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:48,674
Good morning, Miss Fellowes.

271
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,061
I'll... I'll drive.

272
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:20,212
We're there, Peebie, your troubles are over.
Now you can have a nice bath.

273
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:24,244
"The Ambos Mundos Hotel
in Puerto Vallarta...

274
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:28,253
...is a completely modern,
air-conditioned hotel...

275
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:32,750
...on a delightful plaza,
with excellent food and service."

276
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,298
Shannon? Shannon, that's our hotel.

277
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,004
Shannon. Stop.

278
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:57,743
Stop this instant.
Shannon. Shannon!

279
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:19,073
What the hell you trying to do, Reverend?
Get us all killed?

280
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:53,306
- You gone crazy or something?
- This is not the Ambos Mundos.

281
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:57,172
It says in the brochure we stop in Ambos
Mundos, in the heart of Puerto Vallarta.

282
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:01,781
Here we are, ladies, this is Mismaloya,
the garden spot of the West Coast.

283
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,975
You'll be grateful to me to your dying days.

284
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,950
In all of Mexico,
there's nothing to equal this.

285
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:10,649
The chef is a Chinese, specially
imported from Shanghai by me.

286
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:14,352
Just leave your bags.
The staff will take care of everything.

287
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,733
Take us right back
to Puerto Vallarta where we belong.

288
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,630
I'm expecting an important telegram.

289
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,566
- I can't take you no place.
- Why not?

290
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:26,502
Because Reverend's taken the
distributor head, that's why not.

291
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:28,438
Shannon.

292
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,544
Shannon, you won't get away with this!

293
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,751
Fred?

294
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:42,779
Fred?

295
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,431
Shannon.

296
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:56,768
What the hell are you doing
down here out of season?

297
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,600
Would you have one of your boys
lug this bag up for me?

298
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:01,998
Pepe.

299
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,245
Fred, where are you?

300
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,008
Fred can't hear you, baby.

301
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:12,153
Why? Gone fishing?

302
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,844
How long have you been off it?

303
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,887
- Off what?
- The wagon.

304
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:17,490
I'm not drunk.

305
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,959
- Oh, what's the matter with you then?
- Fever, just fever.

306
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,792
- Where's Fred?
- Dead.

307
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:30,163
- Did you say dead?
- That's what I said. Fred's dead.

308
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:33,874
How? When?

309
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:35,976
Oh, less than four weeks ago.

310
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:41,139
Died with his boots on, though. Hooked
into a big marlin, the marlin won.

311
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:44,979
I was counting on Fred to bail me out,
straighten me out and bail me out.

312
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:48,179
He was my hope of salvation.
I had all my chips on Fred.

313
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:51,792
- Baby, you're going to pieces, aren't you?
- Yeah, yeah. They...

314
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,552
They are tearing me to pieces.

315
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:56,697
I was hanging on until I could get
to the hammock on the veranda...

316
00:28:56,885 --> 00:29:00,426
...over the rainforest and still-water beach.
It's all that can pull me through.

317
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:03,435
Honey, just lie down the hammock.
I'll fix you a nice rum-coco.

318
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,699
No, no, no. If I start drinking
rum-cocos now, I'll never stop.

319
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:10,901
Reverend!
They want us to go back into town.

320
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:15,013
Well, tell them they can't go
back into town.

321
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,648
I thought Fred could tame them.

322
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,585
He was a fisherman, and I've got
a busload of man-eating sharks.

323
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,687
- I've gotta get those women up here.
- No, you don't.

324
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,318
We're closed in August.
We're always closed in August.

325
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,988
Quit blowing, and blow!

326
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:36,100
Maxine. Maxine, you gotta help me.

327
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:40,739
- Honey, you're really gone.
- Maxine, I can't lose this party.

328
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,345
Blake's Tours have put me on probation
because I had a bad party last month.

329
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,208
They tried to get me fired,
so now I'm on probation.

330
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:51,318
If I lose this party, I'll be fired for sure.
And what's next, Maxine?

331
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:54,011
There's nothing,
nothing lower than Blake's Tours.

332
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,124
Okay, okay, baby.
If it's that important to you...

333
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,027
...they can stay here.

334
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:03,987
Here comes your sidekick now.

335
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:06,258
His name's Hank. Hank.

336
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:08,459
- You gotta help me with him.
- Sure.

337
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:10,934
- I'll give him complimentary rum-coco.
- No, no, no.

338
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,073
Not until he's got the bus unloaded.

339
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:17,177
You ain't getting away with it.
Some of the ladies are in bad shape.

340
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:20,041
They'll walk back if you don't give me
that distributor head.

341
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:24,151
They'll drop like flies from sunstroke
in this heat. Hank, I need your cooperation.

342
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:29,419
This is a test of strength, Hank,
between two men and a crate of wet hens.

343
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,116
You know that, don't you?
I know what I'm doing, Hank.

344
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:33,453
Don't you forget that.

345
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:36,688
Now, the bell cow sent a telegram from
Los Feliz this morning, right?

346
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:39,663
That answer will come to their hotel
in Puerto Vallarta, right?

347
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,496
But if we're not there,
no answer can be delivered, right?

348
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,968
Lizzie Borden won't get to wield her ax.

349
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:49,576
That's why I brought them up here. Working
every minute. Now, all I need is a little time.

350
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,838
To reestablish myself in the esteem...

351
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:55,574
...of those old...
The good ladies of our party.

352
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,584
By this time tomorrow, they'll
be eating out of the palm of my hand.

353
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:04,248
Of that, you have the assurance
of the Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon.

354
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:07,259
What assurance you give
the kid you been leading on?

355
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,022
Leading on? Hank, if you are
to succeed in this business...

356
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:14,134
...you must give factual reports without
exaggeration. That's a definite exaggeration.

357
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:17,567
I've exercised every ingenuity
of which a man is capable...

358
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,231
...to keep at bay the advances
of this precocious jezebel.

359
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,438
That's a hell of a way to talk about
an innocent young girl.

360
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:28,204
You sure weren't doing no avoiding
when you got her up in your pad last night.

361
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:29,873
Ha-ha, very funny.

362
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:33,111
Without no exaggeration,
whatever happens to Reverend ain't enough.

363
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,654
Avoiding her? She laid it
on the line down there...

364
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:37,654
...why you shanghaied us up here.
- Hank...

365
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,918
I heard your story.
But that ain't her story.

366
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:43,727
She said that she planned
to take the plane from Puerto Vallarta...

367
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:46,731
...and you couldn't stand for it
to see her go.

368
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:50,536
Fantastic. That's fantastic.

369
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,536
Mrs. Faulk, honey...

370
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:56,370
...give him a menu. Give him one of your
sample menus to show the ladies.

371
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:59,274
One of your fantastic sample menus.

372
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:01,745
There you are, thank you.
There you are, Hank.

373
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:05,909
Now you go back down there and show
this fantastic sample menu to the ladies.

374
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:09,818
Describe the view from the hill,
the palatial appointments of the hotel...

375
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,390
...anything you like.

376
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,288
You get them up here, Hank.

377
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:19,328
A fine, upstanding young man.

378
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,266
So you appropriated the young chick
and the old hens are squawking, huh?

379
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,066
It's very serious. The child
is emotionally precocious.

380
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,936
- Bully for her.
- Also, she is traveling under the wing...

381
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,045
...of a military escort
of a butch vocal teacher.

382
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:36,642
I wonder how long it takes to sweat
the faculty of a Baptist Female College...

383
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:41,016
...out of a bus that's parked in the sun
when it's a 100 degrees in the shade.

384
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:43,519
- Well, they're staggering out of it now.
- They are?

385
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,888
I've won this round, I reckon.
Good old Hank.

386
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,689
Good old Hank better take cover.

387
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:59,434
Look at her, charging like
a bull elephant on a rampage.

388
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:01,871
Maxine, you gotta
help me with her, honey.

389
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,376
She's not only trying to get me fired,
she's also trying to pin on me...

390
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,707
...a rape charge,
a charge of statutory rape.

391
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,146
Statutory rape?
I've never known what that was.

392
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:14,846
That's when a man's seduced by a girl
under 20. That's not funny, Maxine.

393
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,453
Why do you always want
the young ones, honey?

394
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:21,186
I don't want any,
any, regardless of age.

395
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:23,830
Why do you take them, Shannon?
Huh, Shannon?

396
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:27,798
- Well, people need human contact, Maxine.
- Shannon!

397
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,197
Shannon! You're a fake.

398
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,100
Come on up, Miss Fellowes.
Everything's fixed.

399
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,631
Never do that, Miss Fellowes.

400
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:38,006
Not at high noon in a tropical country
in summer. Never charge uphill...

401
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:41,580
...like you're leading a troop of cavalry
attacking an impregnable position.

402
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,912
I don't want advice or instructions.
I want that distributor head.

403
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,354
This is one of the charming ladies of whom
I was speaking. Mrs. Faulk, Miss Fellowes.

404
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:52,049
- Hello.
- Is this man making a deal with you?

405
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:55,218
- What sort of deal?
- Is this man getting a kickback from you?

406
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:58,021
Look, honey,
nobody gets a kickback out of me.

407
00:33:58,352 --> 00:34:00,698
- I turn away more people...
- Have you got a telephone?

408
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,535
- Sure.
- I wanna make a call to Texas.

409
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:07,399
- Collect, of course.
- Right in the office there.

410
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,371
When the hell did you get
a telephone in here?

411
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:15,641
Old Fred, he finally got the telephone
company to run a wire up here.

412
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:18,752
Well, you get in there,
and find out who she's talking to.

413
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,788
And don't let her get through to
Blake's Tours. She's trying to get me fired.

414
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,517
We're almost there, Peebie.
Just a little further.

415
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:28,890
Miss Peebles, I am delighted.

416
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,288
I knew common sense would prevail.

417
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,196
You'll be enchanted with Mismaloya.
Look at this view.

418
00:34:34,388 --> 00:34:36,996
We're not here out of choice,
we're here out of necessity.

419
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,435
- Miss Peebles is ill. She requires a...
- A bathroom.

420
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:42,599
A bathroom, a bathroom.
Hank, get the luggage out of the bus.

421
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:45,007
Help yourselves, ladies.
Bungalows are all yours.

422
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,943
Here you are, Miss Peebles,
to comfort and privacy.

423
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:50,175
- Peebie,
- We couldn't help it, Judith, Peebie...

424
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:53,809
Just a temporary indisposition.
Mrs. Faulk is looking after her personally.

425
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,421
That's the service you get here.

426
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,890
Now you and Charlotte,
Miss Goodall, can share this one.

427
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:02,188
I want a room of my own.

428
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:05,628
That's perfectly all right with me.
She can have a room of her own.

429
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,793
I no longer assume any responsibility
for her actions. She's a free agent.

430
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:12,667
Until we get back to civilization.

431
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,839
Hank.

432
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,375
Let me have Miss Fellowes' bag.

433
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,604
Thank you.

434
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,905
This way, Miss Fellowes.

435
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:24,313
Miss Fellowes, did you get
your call through?

436
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,282
Circuits were busy,
they'll call me back.

437
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:29,184
Miss Fellowes, please,
please give me a minute.

438
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,949
Well? Well, what is it?

439
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:33,059
Well, it's just that like...

440
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:35,559
Like everybody else
at some time or other in life...

441
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,527
...my life has cracked up on me.

442
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,791
How does that compensate us?

443
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:43,266
Miss Fellowes, I've just confessed
to you that I'm at the end of my rope.

444
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:46,372
Please, Miss Fellowes, don't make me
feel that any human being...

445
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,567
...would put personal compensation
before the ugly bare fact...

446
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:53,111
...of a man who's at the end of his rope,
but who still has to try to go on.

447
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:56,148
Now you listen to me.
We girls have worked and slaved...

448
00:35:56,337 --> 00:36:00,151
...all year at Baptist Female College for
this Mexican tour, and the tour is a cheat.

449
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:01,549
Fantastic.

450
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,986
For days we've been holed
in that stifling bus...

451
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:05,853
...over the byways, off the highways.

452
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:08,655
Shook up and bumped up
so you could get your rake off.

453
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,821
All of the girls in this party
have dysentery.

454
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:14,058
That you cannot blame me for.
I passed out mimeographed instructions:

455
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,068
What to eat, what not to eat,
what to drink, what not to drink.

456
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,706
It's not what, but where
we ate that gave us dysentery.

457
00:36:19,894 --> 00:36:22,172
It's not dysentery, not
even amoebic. It's nothing...

458
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:23,833
It's Montezuma's revenge.

459
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,342
That's what we call it down here:
Aztec two-step.

460
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:31,679
Do you? Well, I intend to have
my revenge, Dr. Shannon.

461
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:36,223
Honey, I don't think even old Fred
could have calmed her down.

462
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,085
You go lie down.

463
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:14,820
- Okay, Shannon.
- What you gonna do?

464
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,662
Did you ever have a shave
by a lady barber?

465
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:20,096
I can shave myself, Maxine.

466
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:23,864
With those shakes?
How long you had them, Shannon?

467
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:28,270
They've been incubating ever since the trip
started. It's been a nightmare all the way.

468
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:32,708
Culminating with the Witch of Endor
threatening to hound me to the grave.

469
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,246
That's when blind panic took over.

470
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:37,213
That's when the spook moved in.

471
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:40,183
Is that all your spook is, honey?
Just panic?

472
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:44,620
Maxine, don't say "just panic"
like you'd say "just leprosy."

473
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,622
Panic's serious.

474
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:49,854
Who'd Madame Lafarge
put that phone call to?

475
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:52,124
- Some judge in Corpus Christi.
- I knew it.

476
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,325
- Where you going?
- To tear that phone out...

477
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,367
In a pig's eye!

478
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:59,700
That phone cost me 1200 pesos
to get in here.

479
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:02,672
You just lie back, baby,
and when I get you all prettied up...

480
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,970
...l'll go and cancel that call.

481
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,244
I see you got your gold cross on.

482
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,252
Thinking about going back to the church?

483
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:19,689
I wrote my old bishop last night,
a letter of complete capitulation.

484
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,828
How come you don't quit
kidding yourself?

485
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:25,056
You ain't thinking about going back
to no church...

486
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:28,724
...or you wouldn't be so scared of losing
this cotton-picking job of yours.

487
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,236
You know, folks don't go to church
to hear atheistical sermons being preached.

488
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:36,899
Damn it to hell. I never preached an atheist
sermon in church in all my life.

489
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:39,638
All right, baby, all right.

490
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,675
What size shoe you wear, baby?

491
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,451
I do not get the point of that question.

492
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,814
Well, these shoes look shot to me.

493
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,480
If I remember correctly
you only travel with one pair.

494
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:53,593
Now, old Fred's estate includes
one good pair of shoes.

495
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,590
And your feet look about the same size.

496
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:59,062
I loved old Fred, Maxine,
but I do not want to fill his shoes.

497
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,934
You could do worse, baby.

498
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,204
You could do worse.

499
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:17,341
Which way is the sea?

500
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:21,352
It's right down there, but we can't see it
because of the trees.

501
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:23,990
I can feel it and smell it.

502
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:26,422
It's the cradle of life.

503
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:03,424
Are these two with your party?

504
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:06,290
They look like a couple of loonies.

505
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:10,030
Life began in the sea.

506
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:13,402
Oh! Oh, how do you do?

507
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:15,641
Hello.

508
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,839
Have you ever tried helping a gentleman...

509
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,915
...who can't walk,
uphill through a rain forest?

510
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,317
No. I wouldn't even try it downhill.

511
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:28,346
Anything I can do for you folks?

512
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:31,491
Well, now that we've made it,
I don't regret the effort.

513
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,786
What a view for a painter!

514
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:37,795
They told me in the town
this was the ideal place for a painter.

515
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:40,126
And they weren't exaggerating.

516
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:43,294
Anything I can do for you?

517
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:46,565
Yes, yes, I'm looking for
the manager of the hotel.

518
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,537
Oh, that's me. Speaking.

519
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:52,702
You're the manager. Oh, good.
I'm Hannah Jelkes. How do you do?

520
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,405
- Mrs...?
- Faulk. Maxine Faulk.

521
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:57,073
You're looking for rooms?

522
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:59,879
Yes, yes, we are, but we've come
without reservations.

523
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:03,387
Well, honey, we're closed in August,
except for a few special guests.

524
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:06,219
Well, look at them.
If they're not special, who the hell is?

525
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:08,953
Honey, that old man ought to be
in a hospital.

526
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,327
No. Oh, no, no, he just sprained
his ankle a little this morning.

527
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,904
Come on, Grandpa. Two steps,
one, two. There you are.

528
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:22,168
Hannah, tell the lady
that my frailty is temporary.

529
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:25,176
I will soon be able to crawl
and then to toddle.

530
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:28,941
And before long I'll be leaping
around here like an old mountain goat.

531
00:41:29,136 --> 00:41:31,676
Yes, yes, Grandfather, I explained that.

532
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:37,222
Tell the lady that I know some hotels
don't want to take dogs, cats or monkeys.

533
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:42,158
And some don't even solicit the patronage
of infants in their late 90s.

534
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:43,762
But assure her...

535
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:47,697
...that if she'll forgive my
disgraceful longevity...

536
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:50,894
...and this temporary decrepitude...

537
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:55,667
...I will present her with the last signed
copy of my first volume of verse.

538
00:41:55,863 --> 00:41:58,676
Published in... When, Hannah?

539
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:02,612
The day that President William McKinley
was assassinated, Nonno.

540
00:42:02,803 --> 00:42:05,752
My grandfather is the poet
Jonathan Coffin.

541
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,911
He is 97 years young.

542
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,022
And he will be 98 years young...

543
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:13,683
...on the 5th of October.
- Old folks are remarkable.

544
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,658
Hey, the phone!
Did you cancel that call?

545
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:17,763
When the hell did I have time?

546
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,923
Did I talk too much?

547
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,000
Have I been talking too much again?

548
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:24,367
I'm afraid that he has.

549
00:42:24,558 --> 00:42:26,267
I don't think she's going to take us.

550
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,534
Her eyes said "no"
in big blue capital letters.

551
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,770
Oh, I shouldn't worry about that.
She'll take you in, all right.

552
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:36,474
The Judge Truman Fellowes
on the telephone.

553
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,016
Must be old butch's brother.
Wouldn't have a husband.

554
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:41,484
Anyway, I said she'd checked out,
canceled the call.

555
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:44,249
Maxine, you're larger than life.

556
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:48,054
Shall we register now?

557
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:50,425
You can register
any time you want.

558
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:52,930
But I gotta collect 6 dollars
from you right now...

559
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,795
...if you want your name in the pot.

560
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:56,502
Six dollars.

561
00:42:57,691 --> 00:43:00,105
Three dollars each.
You see, out of season like this...

562
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:02,538
...we operate on the modified
American plan.

563
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,736
Oh, I see. Yes, well...

564
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:08,973
...we usually operate on a
special basis ourselves.

565
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:10,983
What do you mean, operate?

566
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:14,152
Here is our card.

567
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:16,048
I think you may have heard of us.

568
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:17,815
We've had quite a few write-ups.

569
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:21,353
My grandfather is the oldest living
and practicing poet.

570
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:23,758
And he gives recitations.

571
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:27,526
I paint watercolors
and I'm a quick sketch artist.

572
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:30,636
We travel together
and we pay our way as we go...

573
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:32,499
...by my grandfather's recitations...

574
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,803
...and by the sale of quick character
sketches in charcoal and pastel.

575
00:43:38,098 --> 00:43:41,673
I usually pass among the tables
during lunch and dinner, slowly.

576
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,079
I wear an artist's smock...

577
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,617
...picturesquely dabbed with paint.

578
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:50,416
I don't push myself on people.
I just display my work.

579
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:53,822
And I smile sweetly at them,
and if invited to do so...

580
00:43:54,014 --> 00:43:56,588
...I sit down and make
a quick character sketch.

581
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,356
And Gramps?

582
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:02,165
I introduce him as the world's oldest
living and practicing poet.

583
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:05,529
If invited, he gives a recitation
of one of his poems.

584
00:44:06,093 --> 00:44:09,167
Of course, they were all written
a very long time ago...

585
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:11,573
...but do you know
he has started a new poem?

586
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:15,710
For the first time in 20 years
he has started another poem.

587
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,248
Hasn't finished it yet.

588
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:22,685
He still has his inspiration but his power
of concentration has weakened a little.

589
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:26,619
Right now, Gramps
ain't concentrating at all.

590
00:44:26,814 --> 00:44:28,921
He's just catching forty winks.

591
00:44:29,783 --> 00:44:31,162
Gramps.

592
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:33,093
Gramps.

593
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:35,061
Time to hit the sack, Gramps.

594
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,829
- Now, you just wait a minute.
- Please.

595
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:40,872
We've tried every hotel
in Puerto Vallarta.

596
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:42,975
They wouldn't take us.

597
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:46,374
I'm afraid I have to place myself
at your mercy.

598
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:50,207
Okay. Looks like you're in
for one night, but just one.

599
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:52,682
- Thank you.
- Where's your luggage?

600
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,080
No luggage?

601
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:58,850
I hid it behind some palmettos at the foot
of the path with Grandfather's wheelchair.

602
00:44:59,046 --> 00:45:00,288
Pepe.

603
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:06,729
They're chasing an iguana.

604
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:11,534
What will they do with it?

605
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:14,936
Tie him up, fatten him up
and eat him up.

606
00:45:26,073 --> 00:45:27,645
Pepe.

607
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:36,489
Okay, honey. You and Gramps
can have bungalow nine.

608
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:39,154
How's Gramps gonna get meals?
Let them have that suite.

609
00:45:39,353 --> 00:45:41,460
Wait a minute, Shannon,
that's the deluxe suite.

610
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:45,093
I know, Maxine, generosity
is the cornerstone of your nature.

611
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:47,297
Come on, Gramps.
Time to move.

612
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,736
That's it.

613
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:51,343
Did someone call for a recitation?

614
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:54,811
No, Nonno,
we're just going to our rooms.

615
00:45:56,904 --> 00:45:59,478
I'm dreadfully afraid
my grandfather had a slight stroke...

616
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,587
...in those high passes
through the Sierras.

617
00:46:01,775 --> 00:46:05,555
Old people have them. They're not regular
strokes, just little cerebral incidents.

618
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:09,628
Symptoms clear up so quickly, sometimes
old people don't realize they've had them.

619
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:20,436
Just rest for a few moments, Nonno.

620
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:29,983
How calmly does the olive branch

621
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,813
Observe the sky begin to blanch

622
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:37,782
Without a cry, without a prayer

623
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:41,652
With no betrayal of despair

624
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:49,593
I'll leave Nonno in here
and I'll take that room.

625
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,933
That's the one with the leaky roof,
but you won't find out about it...

626
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:56,803
...until it rains, and then it'll be too late
to do anything except swim out if it.

627
00:46:56,997 --> 00:47:00,208
- Oh, no, Mr...?
- Shannon, the Reverend T. Lawrence.

628
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,816
Mr. Shannon,
I'll find a dry spot if it rains.

629
00:47:04,004 --> 00:47:05,451
How many...?

630
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,610
How many times have you
been around the world?

631
00:47:07,808 --> 00:47:10,120
As many times as the world
has been around the sun.

632
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:13,589
And I feel as if I've gone
the whole way on foot.

633
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:15,761
Thank you, Mr. Shannon.

634
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:51,624
Operator.

635
00:47:52,386 --> 00:47:55,028
Operator, aqui parlar English?

636
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:58,899
- Si, senora. Can I help you?
- This is Miss Fellowes at Mismaloya.

637
00:47:59,092 --> 00:48:01,540
- Si, senora.
- What happened to my call to Texas?

638
00:48:01,728 --> 00:48:03,767
- Where in Texas?
- Corpus Christi.

639
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,139
- I thought you'd checked out.
- Checked out?

640
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:09,214
How could I check out?
He's got the distributor...

641
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:13,784
Operator, you put that
call through again...

642
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:18,254
...and I will hold the line
and wait if it takes all afternoon.

643
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,925
Very well, senora.

644
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:28,492
Seducer.

645
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,866
- What?
- Seducer.

646
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:36,342
- Now, what's the squawk now?
- Oh, Larry, why didn't you tell me?

647
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,841
Tell you what? What is this?

648
00:48:38,031 --> 00:48:41,378
- You've been exposed, Shannon.
- Your whole shameful past.

649
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:43,914
Posing as a minister of the gospel.

650
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:46,143
I am a minister. Anybody who says I'm not...

651
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,720
Honey, show them that gold cross,
that'll prove it.

652
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:53,053
You thought you outwitted me, didn't you,
having your paramour here cancel my call.

653
00:48:53,246 --> 00:48:56,559
Miss Fellowes, honey,
if paramour means what I think it does...

654
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,198
...you're gambling with your front teeth.

655
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:02,597
My brother has been in communication
with Blake's Tours.

656
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:05,670
They've assured him
that they will take action, drastic action.

657
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,932
Just what do you mean by that?

658
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:10,941
- I have a contract that provides...
- Your contract is worthless.

659
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,009
My brother is a judge.

660
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,741
And he has informed your employer
that they are not required to employ...

661
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:19,909
...a man who makes a career
of seducing young girls.

662
00:49:20,107 --> 00:49:23,215
"Seducing!"
Did you lead her to infer that...

663
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,449
Larry, how could you think that l...?

664
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:29,858
I said a career. All the way
from Pleasant Valley, Virginia...

665
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,056
...to that dreadful hotel
that you tricked us into last night.

666
00:49:33,253 --> 00:49:34,666
But that career is now ended.

667
00:49:34,988 --> 00:49:38,096
The Reverend Shannon, defrocked.

668
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,636
That's a lie. A base lie.

669
00:49:40,861 --> 00:49:44,402
I was never defrocked.
I was only locked out of my church.

670
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:46,540
Spreading a story like that is libel.

671
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,513
I could take legal action. And I will.
These ladies are my witnesses.

672
00:49:50,704 --> 00:49:53,118
Repeating a story like that will get you...

673
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:57,480
I'll show you. I'll show you all.

674
00:49:57,678 --> 00:50:00,149
You can't say that I was defrocked.

675
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:03,362
I'll show you. I'll show you.

676
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:10,202
Well, if you're not gonna eat him,
I guess I'd better see about some food.

677
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:19,473
What's this mess supposed to be?

678
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:20,977
Soup.

679
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:22,945
Well, it's burnt!

680
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:31,281
Chang...

681
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,819
...l've warned you before.

682
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:35,928
I don't allow this stuff on premises,
even if you're on vacation.

683
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,394
You remember the time you got it
in the enchiladas?

684
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:41,233
What are you
gonna do with them dogfish?

685
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:44,063
Me do nothing. Me on vacation.

686
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:48,697
Pedro can fry with plenty chili,
make hot.

687
00:50:55,869 --> 00:50:59,307
- Why not steam it, Mrs. Faulk?
- No guests allowed in the kitchen.

688
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:00,953
Mayn't I help?

689
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,683
Please let me.

690
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:05,825
I was born and bred in the fishing port
of Nantucket.

691
00:51:06,012 --> 00:51:08,893
And I've cooked every kind of fish
that swims in the sea.

692
00:51:09,082 --> 00:51:11,462
Except whales, but they're mammals.

693
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:14,099
I know what you're up to, honey.

694
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:17,794
You wanna make yourself useful so I'll
let you and old Gramps stay here free.

695
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,996
I wouldn't do anything so obvious.

696
00:51:20,193 --> 00:51:22,300
Not with a woman of your practicality.

697
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,876
No, my wanting to help in the kitchen...

698
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:27,172
May I have the knife, please?

699
00:51:27,467 --> 00:51:29,142
Machete.

700
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:32,310
It's just that I've noticed a certain...

701
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,922
...animosity towards
Mr. Shannon among the...

702
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:39,058
...ladies in his party,
particularly in the case of...

703
00:51:40,947 --> 00:51:44,761
...Miss Fellowes, and I think with
a soothing meal inside her...

704
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:46,489
...it might soothe her spirit.

705
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:50,669
Miss Jelkes, honey, you're a hustler.

706
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,863
A fantastic, cool hustler.

707
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,274
You're completely broke, huh?

708
00:51:56,797 --> 00:51:59,041
Yes, we are, completely.

709
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,576
You say that like you're proud of it.

710
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:03,978
I'm not proud of it,
or ashamed of it either.

711
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:06,551
It just happens to be
what's happened to us.

712
00:52:10,777 --> 00:52:12,156
You know what that means?

713
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:14,020
No, I don't think I do.

714
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,185
It's Chinese for "No sweat."

715
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,456
Our Chinese cook says it.

716
00:52:18,852 --> 00:52:20,925
Old Fred used to say...

717
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:24,696
...that those three words
summed up all the wisdom of the East.

718
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:27,900
- Fred?
- My husband.

719
00:52:28,361 --> 00:52:29,569
My late husband.

720
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:33,845
How lately did you lose him, Mrs. Faulk?

721
00:52:34,034 --> 00:52:36,482
Three, almost four weeks ago.

722
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,448
Maybe it hasn't dawned on me yet,
old Fred being gone for good.

723
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:42,554
It seems like he's out fishing.
He was always out fishing anyhow.

724
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:46,180
He hardly ever opened his mouth, except
when he got drunk and sang songs.

725
00:52:46,379 --> 00:52:49,692
He'd lie out in that hammock
and drink and sing all night long.

726
00:52:49,883 --> 00:52:51,387
No guest ever complained either.

727
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,159
Or I'd have shown them
the straight way down the hill.

728
00:52:54,454 --> 00:52:56,334
I'm sure you would.

729
00:52:57,691 --> 00:52:59,696
I loved old Fred.

730
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,498
More than anybody would guess, the way
I carried on. Except Fred, he knew.

731
00:53:03,697 --> 00:53:06,441
You see, he was 28 years older than me.

732
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:09,548
And we hadn't slept together in
I don't know when.

733
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:11,445
Fred used to say...

734
00:53:11,638 --> 00:53:15,452
...he guessed he was impotent. But if you
ask me, honey, he just plain lost interest.

735
00:53:17,844 --> 00:53:20,793
What other interest did he have,
Mrs. Faulk?

736
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:22,389
Only fishing.

737
00:53:22,582 --> 00:53:24,792
He'd catch them, throw them back in.

738
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:27,695
Unless they swallowed the hook,
we'd have them for supper.

739
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:29,768
Fred lived and let live.

740
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:35,063
When I hired them beach boys...

741
00:53:35,762 --> 00:53:36,800
...Fred care?

742
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:40,708
Did he raise hell when I started going
night swimming with them? Hell, no.

743
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:43,372
He just went night fishing all night long.

744
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:46,245
He must have been a remarkable man.

745
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:47,647
You said it.

746
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:51,655
People with troubles, and that's everybody,
used to come and spill them to old Fred.

747
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:54,885
And he could listen forever.
He was better than any head shrinker...

748
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:58,155
...because he knew what was
bugging you even before you told him.

749
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:01,232
That's why Shannon always made for
Mismaloya when he was spooked.

750
00:54:01,922 --> 00:54:05,929
I remember one time, he came down here
out of season like now.

751
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:07,539
And I went on the make for him.

752
00:54:07,727 --> 00:54:12,007
But Shannon wasn't having any,
on account of his friendship with Fred.

753
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:13,839
Well, they're all ready for steaming.

754
00:54:14,234 --> 00:54:17,650
So was I, Miss Jelkes, honey, so was I.

755
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:21,218
But I couldn't tell him
that Fred didn't give a damn.

756
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:23,514
It didn't seem fair to Fred.

757
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:28,892
You know I think you're quite a
remarkable person too, Mrs. Faulk.

758
00:54:29,082 --> 00:54:30,791
Don't you try to con me, honey.

759
00:54:30,984 --> 00:54:32,329
I understand me.

760
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,627
I still got my biological urges.

761
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,299
The beach boys?

762
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,536
Yup.

763
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:44,744
But even I know the difference
between loving somebody...

764
00:54:44,965 --> 00:54:48,312
...and just going to bed with them.
Even I know that.

765
00:55:03,081 --> 00:55:06,724
Nelly was a lady

766
00:55:06,919 --> 00:55:09,959
Last night she died

767
00:55:10,155 --> 00:55:14,094
Toll the bell
For lovely Nell

768
00:55:14,293 --> 00:55:16,798
My dark Virginny bride

769
00:55:17,396 --> 00:55:20,140
Don't you step in this room.
Don't step over that threshold.

770
00:55:20,332 --> 00:55:23,543
Don't complicate my life. I've got a fever.
Don't complicate my fever.

771
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:25,876
Larry, watch out.
You're walking on broken glass.

772
00:55:26,071 --> 00:55:27,279
- Never mind.
- Stand still.

773
00:55:27,473 --> 00:55:30,115
You're cutting your feet,
leaving blood stains on the floor.

774
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:32,780
- Who saw you come in here?
- Nobody but an iguana.

775
00:55:32,978 --> 00:55:35,620
- Your guardian angel will be in full cry.
- Let her howl.

776
00:55:35,814 --> 00:55:39,992
I hate her and I hate that little snitch
of a bitch that ruined you in Virginia.

777
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:42,998
You're ruining me in Mexico.
Get off your knees, it's indecent.

778
00:55:43,188 --> 00:55:46,501
Sit down over there. I want to
explain something to you. Look and listen.

779
00:55:46,925 --> 00:55:49,806
A man has got just so much
in his emotional bank balance.

780
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:52,068
But mine has run out.
It's stone dry.

781
00:55:52,264 --> 00:55:56,203
I can't draw a check on it now.
There's nothing left to draw out.

782
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:59,373
Oh, Lord, you've got blood stains on it.

783
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:01,815
I'm sorry to tell you
that you're as dangerous...

784
00:56:02,007 --> 00:56:04,080
...as you are young and lovely.

785
00:56:04,276 --> 00:56:08,590
And it's your being young and lovely
that makes you so dangerous.

786
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:15,029
And that gives you this destructive
potential over a destructible man.

787
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,565
We're not going back.

788
00:56:17,055 --> 00:56:18,468
We'll stay here together.

789
00:56:18,657 --> 00:56:22,630
Live here, be beachcombers like
Fletcher Christian and that native girl.

790
00:56:22,828 --> 00:56:27,268
Living in the sun.
You're going to marry me, Larry.

791
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:29,536
Oh, Lord, no, no.

792
00:56:29,735 --> 00:56:33,583
And nothing could be worse
for a girl in your unstable condition...

793
00:56:33,772 --> 00:56:37,813
...to be mixed up with a man
in my unstable condition.

794
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:40,982
Because two people
in unstable conditions...

795
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:45,459
...are like two countries
facing each other in unstable conditions.

796
00:56:45,651 --> 00:56:51,365
The destructive potential could blow
the whole world to bits...

797
00:56:51,557 --> 00:56:52,936
...past all repair.

798
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:54,933
You're walking barefoot on glass.

799
00:56:55,127 --> 00:56:57,769
I would walk on brimstone through hell...

800
00:56:57,963 --> 00:57:00,776
...to get you out of my room.
Now will you get out of my room.

801
00:57:00,966 --> 00:57:03,141
I don't believe you don't love me.

802
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:05,146
I love...
I love nobody.

803
00:57:05,337 --> 00:57:08,844
I know it's practically impossible
for anybody to realize they're not loved...

804
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:11,785
...when in love with somebody
they think they're in love with.

805
00:57:11,977 --> 00:57:14,551
You couldn't walk barefoot on glass
if you didn't love me.

806
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:20,255
I'm walking barefoot on glass
because you won't leave me alone.

807
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:24,295
All right, I'll do it too. I'll walk on glass
and I'll bleed to death with you.

808
00:57:24,623 --> 00:57:28,130
No, you won't do this. You will get
out of my room and out of my life.

809
00:57:28,327 --> 00:57:29,535
No, put me down. No!

810
00:57:30,729 --> 00:57:32,472
You will not come near me again,
understand?

811
00:57:32,664 --> 00:57:34,669
Put me down. I hate you!

812
00:57:34,866 --> 00:57:36,245
You've ruined my life.

813
00:57:36,435 --> 00:57:39,782
You've killed me, killed me!

814
00:57:39,972 --> 00:57:42,853
Put me down!

815
00:57:51,683 --> 00:57:53,221
What is this, Mr. Shannon?

816
00:57:53,418 --> 00:57:55,457
Hell and damnation.

817
00:57:55,654 --> 00:57:56,965
Your feet are bleeding.

818
00:57:57,155 --> 00:57:59,069
There's glass all over the floor
in my room.

819
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:03,401
Sit down. I have antiseptics
and surgical gauze in my room.

820
00:58:13,672 --> 00:58:17,349
Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.

821
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:21,348
That word "fantastic" seems to be
your favorite word, Mr. Shannon.

822
00:58:21,546 --> 00:58:22,925
Miss Jelkes...

823
00:58:23,115 --> 00:58:24,756
...we live on two levels.

824
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:26,158
Just two?

825
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:31,428
The fantastic level and the realistic level
are the two levels upon which we live.

826
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:33,628
But which is the real one really?

827
00:58:33,825 --> 00:58:35,705
I would say both, Mr. Shannon.

828
00:58:35,894 --> 00:58:39,105
But when you live
on the fantastic level...

829
00:58:39,297 --> 00:58:43,714
...as I have more and more lately,
but have to operate on the realistic level...

830
00:58:43,902 --> 00:58:45,782
...that's when you get spooked.

831
00:58:46,038 --> 00:58:48,680
And I am spooked, Miss Jelkes.

832
00:58:48,874 --> 00:58:51,687
A chronicle no longer gold

833
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,818
A bargaining with mist of gold

834
00:58:55,013 --> 00:58:56,290
There.

835
00:58:56,481 --> 00:58:59,328
Now I'll go and clear up
the broken glass in your room.

836
00:58:59,518 --> 00:59:02,558
Don't bother about that. If you'd be
kind enough to bring my shoes...

837
00:59:02,754 --> 00:59:05,760
...and could you let me have
my clerical collar? It's on the floor.

838
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:13,508
Are you planning to conduct a church
service here tonight, Mr. Shannon?

839
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:16,739
No, I just plan to do...

840
00:59:16,935 --> 00:59:18,280
...nothing.

841
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:21,681
Oh, and bring me that distributor head,
if you would.

842
00:59:24,509 --> 00:59:25,854
This?

843
00:59:26,878 --> 00:59:28,223
That's it.

844
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:35,459
If you're not going to conduct a service,
why get into this uncomfortable outfit?

845
00:59:35,654 --> 00:59:40,128
Because I've been accused of being
defrocked and lying about it, that's why.

846
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:46,244
I will demonstrate to these ladies that
I'm still a frocked minister of the gospel.

847
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:48,504
I'm afraid it's no use, Mr. Shannon.

848
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,740
The neckband's so frayed,
it won't hold the collar button.

849
00:59:51,937 --> 00:59:53,714
- Oh, damn.
- Hannah!

850
00:59:53,905 --> 00:59:55,876
Oh, God, he's fallen.

851
00:59:59,311 --> 01:00:00,952
Hey, Grandpa.

852
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,360
There you are.

853
01:00:11,423 --> 01:00:13,428
I wish my pulse were as steady as his.

854
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:16,130
Did you feel dizzy, Grandfather?

855
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:18,466
No, no.

856
01:00:18,897 --> 01:00:22,074
I was working on my new poem and...

857
01:00:23,101 --> 01:00:25,106
Where's my cane?

858
01:00:30,108 --> 01:00:32,113
There you are, Grandpa.

859
01:00:32,544 --> 01:00:37,928
I was beating time with my cane
and my cane slipped.

860
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:39,853
You'd better rest a while.

861
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:41,498
Yes.

862
01:00:41,686 --> 01:00:43,566
Rest a while.

863
01:00:43,955 --> 01:00:46,631
He'll be all right now,
we can talk outside.

864
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:49,574
Why are you breathing like that?

865
01:00:50,662 --> 01:00:52,200
Some people take a drink...

866
01:00:53,932 --> 01:00:56,278
...others take a pill.

867
01:00:57,636 --> 01:01:00,779
I just take a few deep breaths.

868
01:01:00,972 --> 01:01:02,317
Well...

869
01:01:02,507 --> 01:01:04,819
...don't be frightened about it.

870
01:01:06,845 --> 01:01:10,124
He was amazing, just amazing...

871
01:01:10,315 --> 01:01:16,029
...until he started having these little,
whatever they are, these spells.

872
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:17,929
When they started, I...

873
01:01:18,123 --> 01:01:23,166
...tried to persuade him to go back to
Nantucket but he said, "No. Mexico."

874
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:26,401
So Mexico it is.

875
01:01:26,598 --> 01:01:29,775
And he wouldn't rest anywhere,
until he got to the sea.

876
01:01:29,968 --> 01:01:33,111
"The cradle of life," as he calls it.

877
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,617
So here we are, Mr. Shannon.

878
01:01:36,808 --> 01:01:40,451
Like a couple of scarecrows
on this windy hilltop...

879
01:01:40,645 --> 01:01:42,650
...over the cradle of life.

880
01:01:42,848 --> 01:01:46,457
The plummeting to earth and then...

881
01:01:46,651 --> 01:01:48,326
Hannah? Hannah?

882
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,459
- Yes, Grandfather?
- I'm pretty sure I'm gonna finish it here.

883
01:01:52,657 --> 01:01:55,003
I have the same feeling myself,
Grandpa.

884
01:01:55,193 --> 01:01:57,971
I've never been surer of anything
in my life.

885
01:01:58,163 --> 01:02:01,010
I've never been surer of anything
in mine, either.

886
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,206
Of course, you'll finish the poem.
Why, it's nearly finished already.

887
01:02:05,403 --> 01:02:09,080
I'll be outside if you want me
to write something down.

888
01:02:12,544 --> 01:02:15,152
He'll probably sleep a while now.

889
01:02:17,816 --> 01:02:22,165
Miss Jelkes, may l...?
May I have one of your cigarettes?

890
01:02:23,321 --> 01:02:25,292
You must never smoke those.

891
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:28,906
They're made out of cigarette ends
taken out of the gutters.

892
01:02:29,094 --> 01:02:30,939
Have one of mine.

893
01:02:31,129 --> 01:02:36,103
English, imported, in an airtight tin.
It's my one luxury in life.

894
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:39,910
Yes, thank you, I will,
since you've thrown mine away.

895
01:02:40,105 --> 01:02:41,313
Well...

896
01:02:41,506 --> 01:02:45,149
...l'm going to tell you something
about yourself, Miss Jelkes.

897
01:02:45,343 --> 01:02:50,351
You are a lady,
a real one and a great one.

898
01:02:50,982 --> 01:02:53,954
What have I done to merit
that compliment from you?

899
01:02:54,152 --> 01:02:57,363
Well, you took out your cigarettes,
found out you only had two left.

900
01:02:57,555 --> 01:03:00,368
You can't afford to buy another pack
of even that cheap brand...

901
01:03:00,558 --> 01:03:03,302
...and so you put them away for later,
right?

902
01:03:03,628 --> 01:03:06,406
Mercilessly accurate, Mr. Shannon.

903
01:03:06,598 --> 01:03:11,038
But when I asked you for one, you gave
me it without slightest sign of reluctance.

904
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:15,113
I think you're making a big point
out of a small matter.

905
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:17,014
Oh, no, no.

906
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:21,887
I'm making a small point
out of a very, very large matter.

907
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:29,193
How long have you been inactive
in the church, Mr. Shannon?

908
01:03:30,288 --> 01:03:33,567
What's that got to do
with the price of rice in China?

909
01:03:33,758 --> 01:03:35,467
- Nothing.
- And what's it got to do...

910
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,165
...with the price of coffee in Brazil?

911
01:03:38,964 --> 01:03:41,674
I retract the question, with apologies.

912
01:03:41,866 --> 01:03:45,179
Very well, then,
I'll be glad to answer it. I...

913
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:48,808
I have been inactive
in the church for all but one year...

914
01:03:49,007 --> 01:03:52,821
...since I was ordained
a minister of the church.

915
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:55,459
That's quite a sabbatical, Mr. Shannon.

916
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:59,529
Yes, I had one parish for one year
and then...

917
01:04:00,051 --> 01:04:01,931
...I was not defrocked...

918
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,660
...I was locked out of the church.

919
01:04:09,995 --> 01:04:12,671
Are you...? You drawing me?

920
01:04:13,665 --> 01:04:15,510
I'm trying to.

921
01:04:16,768 --> 01:04:18,841
Why did they lock you out?

922
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:23,950
For fornication and conduct
unbecoming a man of the cloth.

923
01:04:24,776 --> 01:04:29,659
What were the circumstances
of the first offense?

924
01:04:29,848 --> 01:04:31,489
Fornication?

925
01:04:32,384 --> 01:04:37,495
A very young Sunday school teacher asked
to see me, privately, in my study and...

926
01:04:37,689 --> 01:04:39,102
...well, she...

927
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:42,398
She declared herself
to me, wildly.

928
01:04:42,794 --> 01:04:45,208
A declaration of love?

929
01:04:45,563 --> 01:04:48,637
Don't make fun of me, Miss Jelkes.

930
01:04:49,868 --> 01:04:51,509
I wasn't.

931
01:04:53,905 --> 01:04:56,615
I was the damnedest prig
in those days that you can imagine.

932
01:04:56,808 --> 01:05:00,280
I said to this girl, I said,
"Let us kneel down and pray together."

933
01:05:00,478 --> 01:05:01,857
And we did, we knelt.

934
01:05:02,047 --> 01:05:04,154
And then all of sudden, the...

935
01:05:04,482 --> 01:05:08,421
...kneeling position turned
into a reclining position.

936
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:14,062
The next day, she cut herself with
her father's straight blade razor.

937
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:17,107
- Fatally?
- No, no, no.

938
01:05:17,295 --> 01:05:19,334
Thanks to a Band-Aid.

939
01:05:19,697 --> 01:05:22,578
But it made a scandal.

940
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:25,409
Yes, I imagine that it
caused some comment.

941
01:05:25,603 --> 01:05:26,880
Yes, it did, it did that.

942
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:32,813
The next Sunday when I saw those smug,
accusing, disapproving faces uplifted...

943
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:36,449
...I had a sudden urge to shock.

944
01:05:36,648 --> 01:05:38,289
And I shocked them.

945
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:40,962
I chased them out of the church.

946
01:05:41,953 --> 01:05:44,197
And what was the upshot of it?

947
01:05:44,389 --> 01:05:48,362
They put me in a nice little private
asylum to recover from...

948
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,338
...a complete nervous breakdown.
That's the way they put it.

949
01:05:51,529 --> 01:05:53,670
And then when I got out I...

950
01:05:53,865 --> 01:05:55,540
I entered this line.

951
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:59,513
"Tours of God's world,
conducted by a minister of God."

952
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:02,016
To quote the pamphlet.

953
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,317
But on the side...

954
01:06:04,742 --> 01:06:06,883
...Shannon has been collecting evidence.

955
01:06:07,078 --> 01:06:10,994
- Evidence of what?
- Man's inhumanity to God.

956
01:06:13,017 --> 01:06:16,626
- What do you mean by that?
- The pain we cause him.

957
01:06:17,188 --> 01:06:20,103
We've poisoned his atmosphere.

958
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:22,603
We've slaughtered
his creatures of the wild.

959
01:06:22,794 --> 01:06:25,072
We've polluted his rivers.

960
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:30,071
We've even taken
God's noblest creation, man...

961
01:06:30,268 --> 01:06:33,376
...and brainwashed him into becoming
our own product, not God's.

962
01:06:33,571 --> 01:06:36,748
Hacked, stacked and canned.

963
01:06:42,413 --> 01:06:44,361
Am I...?
Am I moving too much?

964
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:47,424
No, of course not.

965
01:06:51,823 --> 01:06:53,703
Mr. Shannon?

966
01:06:54,025 --> 01:06:55,734
What do you do if...?

967
01:06:55,927 --> 01:06:58,205
If what?

968
01:06:58,396 --> 01:07:00,401
If Miss Fellowes has her way?

969
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:03,274
And gets me fired?

970
01:07:03,768 --> 01:07:05,773
Yes, what do you do then?

971
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:11,214
Well, I either go back
to the church, or I...

972
01:07:11,643 --> 01:07:13,056
I take the long swim.

973
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:16,125
- It's right out there.
- What is?

974
01:07:17,382 --> 01:07:18,693
China.

975
01:07:30,094 --> 01:07:33,339
- Was that the luncheon gong?
- Chow will be ready in a half-hour.

976
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:35,877
How you feeling, Miss Peebles, honey?
A bit better?

977
01:07:36,067 --> 01:07:38,572
- Thank you, I think I am.
- How about a little drink?

978
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:42,208
- That won't hurt you.
- Well...

979
01:07:42,941 --> 01:07:45,788
You look like the den mother.
How about you, Miss Fellowes?

980
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:49,358
Thank you, we'll just sit here
and wait until lunch is ready.

981
01:07:49,581 --> 01:07:51,461
Miss Fellowes, honey.

982
01:07:51,649 --> 01:07:53,153
I know you got a beef or two.

983
01:07:53,418 --> 01:07:56,629
But why don't you just relax
with a little complimentary rum-coco?

984
01:07:56,821 --> 01:08:00,532
Save them for your friend, Mr. Shannon.
I don't imbibe.

985
01:08:00,725 --> 01:08:02,696
Then how about a little pot?

986
01:08:02,894 --> 01:08:04,739
I don't usually serve it to my guests...

987
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:07,139
...but you look like
you need something special.

988
01:08:13,605 --> 01:08:15,177
May I see?

989
01:08:15,573 --> 01:08:18,283
I'm just a quick sketch artist,
Mr. Shannon.

990
01:08:18,476 --> 01:08:20,481
Not very talented.

991
01:08:21,446 --> 01:08:23,087
Are my eyes as wild as this?

992
01:08:23,281 --> 01:08:24,660
Yes, they are, Mr. Shannon.

993
01:08:24,849 --> 01:08:26,456
I have fever.

994
01:08:26,651 --> 01:08:29,464
- What gives with you two?
- What do you mean, what gives?

995
01:08:29,654 --> 01:08:31,727
I mean, am I butting in here?
Is three a crowd?

996
01:08:31,923 --> 01:08:34,098
No, indeed, not a bit.

997
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:36,773
What are you covering up there?
Let me see.

998
01:08:37,996 --> 01:08:40,638
What are you drawing him for?
He's broker than you are.

999
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:43,270
Perhaps you'd like to keep it,
Mrs. Faulk.

1000
01:08:43,468 --> 01:08:46,542
Thanks a hell of a lot, honey,
but one of him is enough.

1001
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:49,710
- Who wants a drink?
- Nothing for me, thank you.

1002
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:52,355
Just as well. You're in to me
for the rooms and meals.

1003
01:08:52,543 --> 01:08:54,718
- A little whiskey makes no difference.
- Lay off.

1004
01:08:55,179 --> 01:08:57,719
And you go to hell, why don't you!

1005
01:09:05,023 --> 01:09:06,903
Mr. Shannon, Mrs. Faulk.

1006
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:11,201
This is childish.
Stop it at once. It's disgraceful!

1007
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:14,444
It's disgraceful.

1008
01:09:17,702 --> 01:09:20,913
- Mrs. Faulk, you must realize...
- I realize you're a deadbeat.

1009
01:09:21,105 --> 01:09:22,985
Using that dying old man as a front...

1010
01:09:23,174 --> 01:09:26,385
...to get you into places when you
ain't got cash for one day in advance.

1011
01:09:26,778 --> 01:09:28,919
You're dragging him around
like a Chinese beggar...

1012
01:09:29,113 --> 01:09:32,529
...dragging around crippled children
to put the touch on the tourists.

1013
01:09:32,717 --> 01:09:34,426
I shall go into town.

1014
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:36,794
And I shall set up my easel in the plaza...

1015
01:09:36,988 --> 01:09:39,732
...and I shall peddle my watercolors,
and sketch tourists.

1016
01:09:39,924 --> 01:09:42,099
I am not a weak person, Mrs. Faulk.

1017
01:09:42,293 --> 01:09:44,298
My failure here is not typical of me.

1018
01:09:44,495 --> 01:09:46,909
- I'm not a weak person either, honey.
- Oh, no, indeed.

1019
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:49,546
- Your strength is awe-inspiring.
- You bet your...

1020
01:09:53,971 --> 01:09:56,442
How you going into town,
when you ain't got cab fare?

1021
01:09:56,941 --> 01:09:59,048
I shall go on shanks' mare, Mrs. Faulk.

1022
01:09:59,243 --> 01:10:02,351
I'm Nantucket born and bred.
Islanders are good walkers.

1023
01:10:02,547 --> 01:10:03,824
I shall pack our things.

1024
01:10:04,015 --> 01:10:06,361
And I shall put my grandfather
into his wheelchair...

1025
01:10:06,551 --> 01:10:09,694
...and push him back down this hill
to the road, all the way into town.

1026
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:12,427
He would prefer that
to staying where he is not wanted.

1027
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:15,864
And I would prefer it for him
and for myself, Mrs. Faulk.

1028
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,268
All right, calm down.

1029
01:10:17,462 --> 01:10:19,876
- I am perfectly calm, Mrs. Faulk.
- Well, I'm not.

1030
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:22,569
That's the trouble.
The trouble is Shannon.

1031
01:10:22,767 --> 01:10:25,375
- I caught the vibrations between you two.
- Mrs. Faulk.

1032
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:28,280
I'm a New England spinster
who is pushing 40.

1033
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:30,353
Well, who the hell isn't?

1034
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:32,648
I'm good at catching vibrations.

1035
01:10:32,844 --> 01:10:37,090
And there were vibrations between you,
mutual vibrations, the minute you got here.

1036
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:40,162
And just that, believe me, is enough
to put me in a lather.

1037
01:10:40,351 --> 01:10:41,821
And don't ask me why.
Look at him.

1038
01:10:42,019 --> 01:10:44,058
Broke, spooked, as good as fired.

1039
01:10:44,655 --> 01:10:47,832
Those are only his circumstances,
Mrs. Faulk...

1040
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:50,838
...not the man himself.
- Well, anyhow.

1041
01:10:51,028 --> 01:10:52,407
Forget what I said, honey.

1042
01:10:52,597 --> 01:10:55,410
I wasn't sore at you,
I was sore at Shannon.

1043
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,243
And still the ripe fruit and the branch

1044
01:10:59,437 --> 01:11:03,183
- Observe the sky begin to blanch
- I'll fix old Gramps a toddy.

1045
01:11:03,374 --> 01:11:05,720
- Old folks need it, need a toddy.
- Without a cry...

1046
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:07,585
That's very kind of you.

1047
01:11:07,779 --> 01:11:10,057
I'll make him a Manhattan
with two cherries in it.

1048
01:11:10,248 --> 01:11:11,957
So he'll live through lunch.

1049
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:13,495
Charlotte.

1050
01:11:13,684 --> 01:11:16,189
- Charlotte!
- What's eating her now?

1051
01:11:16,521 --> 01:11:19,493
Charlotte. Girls! Charlotte!

1052
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,638
What's the trouble now, Miss Fellowes?

1053
01:11:21,826 --> 01:11:23,398
Charlotte. Have you seen her?

1054
01:11:23,594 --> 01:11:26,134
She's disappeared.
Charlotte.

1055
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:28,175
- Charlotte!
- Charlotte.

1056
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:40,815
- Charlotte.
- Now be calm, Miss Fellowes.

1057
01:11:41,012 --> 01:11:42,687
Tell us quietly what has happened.

1058
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,320
She didn't come to luncheon. Her room
was empty, and she's not in my room.

1059
01:11:47,518 --> 01:11:49,989
I don't know what's happened.
She doesn't answer.

1060
01:11:50,188 --> 01:11:52,068
- Let's find her. Charlotte.
- Charlotte.

1061
01:11:52,256 --> 01:11:55,205
Charlotte.

1062
01:12:35,867 --> 01:12:38,213
- More.
- No more.

1063
01:12:38,402 --> 01:12:40,282
No more, I say.
Stop it.

1064
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:42,749
- Senorita, go home.
- I have no home.

1065
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,217
Go home, I say.

1066
01:12:44,408 --> 01:12:46,822
Take your dollars with you.
I'm a rich man.

1067
01:12:47,011 --> 01:12:51,360
I do not want your dollars.
I do not want you dancing to my music.

1068
01:12:51,549 --> 01:12:53,190
- More music.
- No more music.

1069
01:12:53,384 --> 01:12:56,697
Senorita, we do not want our sons
to know that young girls can be like you.

1070
01:12:59,657 --> 01:13:03,573
I won't go back up there.
Put me down. Let me go!

1071
01:13:19,677 --> 01:13:21,750
Attaboy, Hank.
Give it to them!

1072
01:13:24,282 --> 01:13:25,820
Hit them.

1073
01:13:27,351 --> 01:13:28,889
Knock them down.

1074
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:31,966
Attaboy, hit them.

1075
01:13:32,823 --> 01:13:34,236
Yeah, hit them again.

1076
01:13:35,526 --> 01:13:38,202
Yeah, give it to them, Hank.

1077
01:13:41,599 --> 01:13:43,444
Come on, hit them.

1078
01:13:47,104 --> 01:13:49,109
Come on, Hank.

1079
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:51,517
Knock them down! Knock them out!

1080
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:54,624
Yeah, come on, Hank, give it to them.

1081
01:13:59,617 --> 01:14:01,690
Come on, Hank!

1082
01:14:18,636 --> 01:14:22,643
Oh, Hank, you saved me.
You're so brave.

1083
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,779
My hero. Oh, Hank, take me home.

1084
01:14:26,978 --> 01:14:29,722
I mean home.
I'll tell Daddy it was you who saved me.

1085
01:14:29,914 --> 01:14:33,830
Daddy, he loves me.
He'll do anything to thank you.

1086
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,401
I wonder if any of you ladies
would be interested in seeing...

1087
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:41,060
...some samples of my work?

1088
01:14:41,258 --> 01:14:42,637
This one is entitled:

1089
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:45,308
Moonlight Recollected by Daylight.

1090
01:14:45,496 --> 01:14:50,413
And here, here is a character sketch
that I did in less than five minutes.

1091
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:55,075
The queen, when she was Princess
Elizabeth, on a tour of Africa years ago.

1092
01:14:55,306 --> 01:14:56,981
I couldn't get very close, of course.

1093
01:14:57,174 --> 01:14:59,349
- I had to use field glasses.
- No, thank you.

1094
01:14:59,543 --> 01:15:04,688
Love's an old remembered song
A drunken fiddler plays

1095
01:15:04,882 --> 01:15:08,457
Stumbling crazily along
Crooked alleyways

1096
01:15:08,653 --> 01:15:12,501
- Not now, Nonno.
- When his heart is mad with music

1097
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:15,867
- He will play the...
- Nonno, please.

1098
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:22,838
He thinks that someone called
for a recitation of one of his poems.

1099
01:15:23,034 --> 01:15:24,345
Don't you worry, honey.

1100
01:15:24,535 --> 01:15:27,109
In this crowd,
old Gramps is the life of the party.

1101
01:15:27,304 --> 01:15:29,445
Gramps, honey, here.

1102
01:15:29,707 --> 01:15:31,587
Finish your toddy.

1103
01:15:33,377 --> 01:15:35,825
I don't care what anybody says.

1104
01:15:36,013 --> 01:15:37,551
This fish is delicious.

1105
01:15:37,915 --> 01:15:40,523
Swing it this way.
I could handle another helping.

1106
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:45,633
And no funny stuff.
Keep those dukes on the platter.

1107
01:15:51,228 --> 01:15:52,505
What did he say?

1108
01:15:52,697 --> 01:15:56,738
He says you're a hell of a man
in action against a fish...

1109
01:15:56,934 --> 01:15:59,075
...if it's a dead fish.

1110
01:16:05,109 --> 01:16:07,080
Very funny.

1111
01:16:07,912 --> 01:16:11,157
Daddy always says the only difference
between a success and a failure...

1112
01:16:11,348 --> 01:16:15,059
...is that a success knows an opportunity
when he sees it, and a failure doesn't.

1113
01:16:15,252 --> 01:16:17,666
Well, don't worry about me
recognizing an opportunity.

1114
01:16:17,855 --> 01:16:21,236
Oh, Hank. When I tell Daddy,
he'll be so proud of you.

1115
01:16:21,425 --> 01:16:23,703
Hannah?
What was the take?

1116
01:16:23,894 --> 01:16:26,570
Grandfather, please stop shouting.

1117
01:16:26,764 --> 01:16:29,804
Did they cross your palm
with silver or paper, Hannah?

1118
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,438
Nonno, no more shouting,
we're having lunch.

1119
01:16:33,637 --> 01:16:34,914
Chow time, Gramps.

1120
01:16:35,106 --> 01:16:37,247
How much did they come across with?

1121
01:16:37,641 --> 01:16:39,282
He won't stop shouting.

1122
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:42,222
Gramps. Five dollars.

1123
01:16:42,413 --> 01:16:44,122
I'm putting it in your pocket.

1124
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,488
We can't accept gratuities,
Mr. Shannon.

1125
01:16:46,684 --> 01:16:48,996
Oh, hell, it was only pesos.

1126
01:16:49,286 --> 01:16:51,860
Yeah, we're going to clean up
in this place.

1127
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:54,504
You bet we're going
to clean up here, Gramps.

1128
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:58,000
If there's a cocktail lounge,
we ought to work that first.

1129
01:16:58,195 --> 01:17:00,643
Strike while the iron is hot.

1130
01:17:00,898 --> 01:17:02,505
While it's hot.

1131
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,341
Hello?

1132
01:17:04,535 --> 01:17:06,210
Hello?

1133
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:09,444
Speaking.

1134
01:17:10,074 --> 01:17:12,079
Anything I can do for you?

1135
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,753
Who?

1136
01:17:15,646 --> 01:17:16,888
Shannon.

1137
01:17:17,081 --> 01:17:20,588
You're wanted on the blower.
El Paso. Person-to-person.

1138
01:17:21,852 --> 01:17:24,323
This is the moment you've awaited,
Miss Fellowes.

1139
01:17:24,522 --> 01:17:28,097
That will be my esteemed,
but not by me, employer.

1140
01:17:28,292 --> 01:17:32,208
I will now demonstrate to you
how a man of integrity brings an almost...

1141
01:17:32,396 --> 01:17:36,870
...insoluble situation
to a triumphant conclusion.

1142
01:17:54,451 --> 01:17:57,662
The Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon
speaking.

1143
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:02,937
Well, Mr. Blake, how are you?
Nice of you to call.

1144
01:18:03,127 --> 01:18:06,702
Wish you were down here with us.
The air's like spring wine down here...

1145
01:18:06,897 --> 01:18:08,504
...at this time of year.

1146
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:11,944
What do you mean, on the sauce?
You know me better than that, Mr. Blake.

1147
01:18:13,604 --> 01:18:16,018
I don't care what any
judge in Corpus Christi says.

1148
01:18:16,207 --> 01:18:20,317
You know and I know that I am a
regularly ordained minister of the gospel.

1149
01:18:20,511 --> 01:18:24,860
- Shannon, you're fired as of right now.
- Now, wait a minute, you big fat zero.

1150
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:26,462
Let me tell you something.

1151
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:29,690
A tour conductor is like
the captain of a ship.

1152
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:33,268
Once the bus leaves the terminal
he is in sole command.

1153
01:18:33,457 --> 01:18:35,564
And let me assure you...

1154
01:18:35,759 --> 01:18:38,037
...that Shannon runs a taut bus.

1155
01:18:38,362 --> 01:18:40,867
A very taut bus. I've taken it past...

1156
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:43,912
...deadly shoals and all the perils
of the deep.

1157
01:18:44,101 --> 01:18:47,881
Figuratively speaking, of course.
And I remain in command.

1158
01:18:48,205 --> 01:18:52,121
I have here in my pocket
the symbol of my command.

1159
01:18:52,309 --> 01:18:54,154
Right here, in my pocket.

1160
01:18:54,345 --> 01:18:57,726
You cannot fire a man
who has the distributor head.

1161
01:18:57,915 --> 01:18:59,988
Shannon can fire Blake's Tours...

1162
01:19:00,184 --> 01:19:02,792
...but Blake's Tours cannot fire Shannon.

1163
01:19:02,987 --> 01:19:06,232
- This tour will end in peace and unity.
- You're fired, Shannon!

1164
01:19:06,423 --> 01:19:09,531
Shannon will emerge triumphant.

1165
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:15,867
Well, Hank, aren't you proud of me?
As a member of my crew...

1166
01:19:16,066 --> 01:19:17,980
...aren't you proud of me?

1167
01:19:18,168 --> 01:19:23,176
Hank, you know that... That shiner
gives you character, Hank.

1168
01:19:23,374 --> 01:19:25,288
Hey, lay off, you big baboon.

1169
01:19:25,476 --> 01:19:27,947
I got it. I got it, I got it. I got it!

1170
01:19:28,145 --> 01:19:30,355
That's to show how I hate you.

1171
01:19:30,547 --> 01:19:32,722
I hate you.

1172
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:37,061
Foe. I thought you were my friend
and you turned out to be my foe. Foe.

1173
01:19:37,254 --> 01:19:39,725
You're all through, Reverend.
You've had it.

1174
01:19:39,957 --> 01:19:41,996
Relax, baby. The party's over.

1175
01:19:42,192 --> 01:19:43,764
Okay, folks, let's get cracking.

1176
01:19:43,961 --> 01:19:46,535
Get your duds together, we're
ready to blow this goat shed.

1177
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:48,769
- Goat shed?
- Come on, I'll help you get packed.

1178
01:19:48,966 --> 01:19:51,972
You got rooms in Puerto Vallarta.
I'll have you there in 20 minutes.

1179
01:19:52,169 --> 01:19:55,346
From now on, this tour is gonna be
conducted like a respectable tour.

1180
01:19:55,539 --> 01:19:58,147
Respectable? Why these ladies have had,
some of them...

1181
01:19:58,342 --> 01:20:01,985
...most of them, if not all of them,
for the first time in their lives...

1182
01:20:02,179 --> 01:20:05,788
...contact, social contact, with a
gentleman born and bred...

1183
01:20:05,983 --> 01:20:08,932
...whom under no other circumstances
could they possibly have met.

1184
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:11,431
The son of a clergyman
and the grandson of two bishops.

1185
01:20:11,622 --> 01:20:12,967
Churchmen on both sides
of the family.

1186
01:20:17,795 --> 01:20:20,073
- How's old Gramps doing?
- He's sleeping just now.

1187
01:20:20,264 --> 01:20:22,178
Through that riot?

1188
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,646
Will Mr. Shannon be all right,
do you think?

1189
01:20:25,836 --> 01:20:28,546
All right? Honey, I don't know.

1190
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:33,122
He cracks up like this so regular,
you can set a calendar by it.

1191
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,757
About twice a year.

1192
01:20:34,945 --> 01:20:36,950
He's done it twice down here.

1193
01:20:37,147 --> 01:20:40,187
Fred used to say it had something to do
with the moon.

1194
01:20:41,118 --> 01:20:44,261
I sure wish old Fred was here right now.

1195
01:20:45,756 --> 01:20:47,636
Oh, my God!

1196
01:20:47,825 --> 01:20:50,365
- What is it, Mrs. Faulk?
- Honey, I advise you not to look.

1197
01:20:50,561 --> 01:20:54,068
Just take my word for it.
Old Shannon is out-Shannoning Shannon.

1198
01:20:56,633 --> 01:21:01,016
Shannon, you beast. You beast.
You, you... You unutterable beast!

1199
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:04,214
Did you see what he did?

1200
01:21:04,408 --> 01:21:08,324
All right, ladies, now keep calm.
Keep calm, ladies. Just follow me.

1201
01:21:09,213 --> 01:21:11,093
Follow me down the hill.

1202
01:21:11,715 --> 01:21:13,686
Make sure you get my bag.

1203
01:21:20,391 --> 01:21:22,430
Shannon.

1204
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:26,440
You've avenged yourself for
all time on Miss Fellowes' suitcase.

1205
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:29,773
I've heard of a dog cocking his leg.

1206
01:21:31,068 --> 01:21:33,312
Why don't you buzz off
on your broomstick?

1207
01:21:33,504 --> 01:21:35,452
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to him.

1208
01:21:35,806 --> 01:21:38,949
I'm going to have you blacklisted
in every travel agency in America.

1209
01:21:39,309 --> 01:21:43,589
What about Africa, Tasmania,
Bechuanaland, Tonmawr?

1210
01:21:43,781 --> 01:21:45,661
Please, Miss Fellowes, leave him alone.

1211
01:21:45,849 --> 01:21:48,923
As soon as I get back, I'm gonna swear
out a warrant for your arrest.

1212
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:52,700
Molesting a minor, kidnapping,
malicious damage to private property.

1213
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:54,269
Indecent exposure.

1214
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:57,965
What subject do you teach
back in that college of yours, honey?

1215
01:21:58,162 --> 01:22:02,169
- Voice, if that's got anything to do with it.
- Well, geography's my speciality.

1216
01:22:02,366 --> 01:22:04,405
Did you know that if it wasn't for
the dykes...

1217
01:22:04,601 --> 01:22:07,106
...the plains of Texas would be engulfed
by the Gulf?

1218
01:22:07,304 --> 01:22:08,512
Maxine.

1219
01:22:08,705 --> 01:22:10,550
Let's level a while, butch, old gal.

1220
01:22:10,741 --> 01:22:13,155
Do you know what you're sore about,
really sore about?

1221
01:22:13,343 --> 01:22:17,054
That little quail of yours
has a natural preference for men instead of...

1222
01:22:17,247 --> 01:22:18,592
Maxine!

1223
01:22:22,019 --> 01:22:23,296
What is she talking about?

1224
01:22:24,088 --> 01:22:27,094
You'd better go now, Miss Fellowes.
The party's over.

1225
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,535
Right now, I'm no longer
in a position to...

1226
01:22:29,726 --> 01:22:32,675
...discharge my responsibility
of protecting you.

1227
01:22:32,863 --> 01:22:36,301
Responsibility from which
you discharged me.

1228
01:22:36,633 --> 01:22:38,308
Just go, Miss Fellowes.

1229
01:22:38,502 --> 01:22:40,109
Just go.

1230
01:22:48,112 --> 01:22:51,391
What did you shut me up for?
It's time somebody told that old dame off.

1231
01:22:52,249 --> 01:22:53,958
Miss Fellowes is a highly moral person.

1232
01:22:54,151 --> 01:22:57,623
And if she ever recognized the truth
about herself, it would destroy her.

1233
01:22:58,122 --> 01:23:00,798
Well, she's done a pretty good job
of destroying you.

1234
01:23:01,225 --> 01:23:02,832
Maxine.

1235
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,201
Don't rob me of the credit
for my own small accomplishments.

1236
01:23:10,434 --> 01:23:14,316
Jehoshaphat, the bill!
They haven't paid the cotton-picking bill!

1237
01:23:15,906 --> 01:23:18,548
All right, ladies, take your seats,
we'll be out of here.

1238
01:23:18,742 --> 01:23:22,351
I don't know, I kind of hate to leave
this nice place.

1239
01:23:22,546 --> 01:23:24,289
Peebie.

1240
01:23:25,482 --> 01:23:28,158
- Charlotte, you get in next.
- Climb in, Miss Fellowes.

1241
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:30,459
Charlotte's sitting up front with me.

1242
01:23:32,489 --> 01:23:33,993
Hey!

1243
01:23:34,191 --> 01:23:35,729
Just a flipping minute.

1244
01:23:35,926 --> 01:23:38,602
- What is it now?
- 300 pesos, that's what it is now.

1245
01:23:38,795 --> 01:23:41,073
- Twenty-four dollars.
- What about my suitcase?

1246
01:23:41,265 --> 01:23:43,679
Miss Fellowes, honey,
you ain't gonna blame that on me.

1247
01:23:43,867 --> 01:23:46,907
I blame your tout that brought us
here. Collect the money from him.

1248
01:23:47,104 --> 01:23:51,043
Miss Fellowes, you've been doing a lot of
complaining about the food on this trip.

1249
01:23:51,241 --> 01:23:54,088
You figure you're gonna do any better
in a Mexican jail?

1250
01:23:55,612 --> 01:23:59,119
- Attagirl.
- One, two, three.

1251
01:24:00,317 --> 01:24:03,494
And watch out for the fleas
at the Ambos Mundos.

1252
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:06,659
All you have to do is sponge down
with a little kerosene.

1253
01:24:06,857 --> 01:24:10,898
The manager keeps a big supply
right in the lobby.

1254
01:24:11,828 --> 01:24:14,777
There go your ladies, Mr. Shannon.

1255
01:24:17,301 --> 01:24:19,943
The spook's triumphant.

1256
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:22,477
He's won his point.

1257
01:24:22,973 --> 01:24:25,979
He's proved there's no place
for Shannon...

1258
01:24:26,176 --> 01:24:28,590
...on the realistic level.

1259
01:24:29,079 --> 01:24:33,120
The last thin thread
that bound him there...

1260
01:24:33,317 --> 01:24:35,197
...is broken.

1261
01:24:36,053 --> 01:24:37,967
Now, Lord...

1262
01:24:38,222 --> 01:24:40,329
...letteth thy servant...

1263
01:24:40,524 --> 01:24:42,938
...depart in peace.

1264
01:24:43,126 --> 01:24:46,633
Mr. Shannon, stop that.
You're cutting yourself doing that.

1265
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:48,334
Here. Please. Let me help.

1266
01:24:48,532 --> 01:24:51,447
- Let me take it off.
- I've got to break the chain.

1267
01:24:51,635 --> 01:24:54,584
No, no, no. Now, wait. Wait.

1268
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:57,153
There.

1269
01:24:57,341 --> 01:24:58,879
There, I have it.

1270
01:24:59,076 --> 01:25:00,284
Thank you.

1271
01:25:00,477 --> 01:25:03,255
It's yours. You keep it.

1272
01:25:03,513 --> 01:25:05,222
Where are you going?

1273
01:25:05,415 --> 01:25:08,489
The long swim. To China.

1274
01:25:11,421 --> 01:25:13,926
Mrs. Faulk, stop him.

1275
01:25:15,192 --> 01:25:16,969
Mrs. Faulk.

1276
01:25:18,095 --> 01:25:19,940
Mrs. Faulk, stop him.

1277
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:23,136
You must stop him. Please stop him.

1278
01:25:52,562 --> 01:25:54,032
Knock him out if you have to.

1279
01:25:54,431 --> 01:25:55,742
Hang one on him.

1280
01:26:13,183 --> 01:26:14,391
Baby.

1281
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:16,532
You've got the daddy of all spooks.

1282
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,429
This is a blue plate special.

1283
01:26:18,622 --> 01:26:22,265
- Let me out of here!
- You lie doggone now. Quiet down.

1284
01:26:22,459 --> 01:26:25,101
You know and I know that half this show
you're putting on...

1285
01:26:25,295 --> 01:26:27,937
...is playacting. Only trouble is,
sharks don't know that.

1286
01:26:28,131 --> 01:26:29,942
Let me loose.

1287
01:26:30,133 --> 01:26:34,413
Honey, you scared me out of seven years'
growth tonight, you ain't gonna do it again.

1288
01:26:34,604 --> 01:26:35,915
Mrs. Faulk?

1289
01:26:36,139 --> 01:26:39,213
I wonder if you'd mind
making a pot of this tea?

1290
01:26:39,409 --> 01:26:42,449
Miss Jelkes, does this strike you
as the right time for a tea party?

1291
01:26:42,646 --> 01:26:46,289
But this isn't ordinary tea. It's poppy
seed tea. It has a very calming effect.

1292
01:26:46,483 --> 01:26:47,555
Let me go!

1293
01:26:48,518 --> 01:26:51,467
- Tea, it's a hell of a solution.
- Please believe me, Mrs. Faulk.

1294
01:26:51,655 --> 01:26:54,502
I've had experience of someone
in Mr. Shannon's condition.

1295
01:26:54,691 --> 01:26:57,265
And I do know whereof I speak.

1296
01:26:58,295 --> 01:26:59,970
Untie me!

1297
01:27:02,866 --> 01:27:06,213
Poppy seed makes a mild
sedative drink...

1298
01:27:06,403 --> 01:27:10,649
...that helps you get through nights
that are hard for you to get through.

1299
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:13,883
We could all use some tonight.

1300
01:27:14,077 --> 01:27:15,388
Because for all of us...

1301
01:27:15,579 --> 01:27:19,017
...you, me, my grandfather...

1302
01:27:19,216 --> 01:27:21,187
...this won't be an easy night
to get through.

1303
01:27:21,385 --> 01:27:24,061
Without a cry, without a prayer

1304
01:27:24,254 --> 01:27:27,397
- With no betrayal of despair
- Untie me.

1305
01:27:27,591 --> 01:27:29,471
- Not yet.
- I'm panicking.

1306
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:31,402
- I know.
- A man can die of panic.

1307
01:27:31,595 --> 01:27:34,442
Not when he enjoys it as much
as you do, Mr. Shannon.

1308
01:27:34,631 --> 01:27:36,238
What do you mean by that insult?

1309
01:27:36,433 --> 01:27:40,474
You think I like being tied in this hammock,
trussed up like a hog in a slaughterhouse?

1310
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:44,916
No, who wouldn't like to atone
for the sins of themselves...

1311
01:27:45,108 --> 01:27:48,524
...and the world if it could be
done in a hammock with ropes...

1312
01:27:48,712 --> 01:27:51,684
...instead of on a cross with nails?

1313
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:54,126
On a green hilltop...

1314
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:58,631
...instead of on Golgotha,
the place of the skulls.

1315
01:27:59,089 --> 01:28:01,765
Isn't that a comparatively
comfortable...

1316
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:07,308
...almost voluptuous crucifixion to suffer
for the sins of the world, Mr. Shannon?

1317
01:28:07,497 --> 01:28:10,310
- Why have you turned against me?
- I haven't turned against you.

1318
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,278
Thought you were sexless, but you've
suddenly turned into a woman.

1319
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:14,610
You know how I know that?

1320
01:28:14,805 --> 01:28:18,243
Because you, not me, are taking
pleasure in my being tied up.

1321
01:28:18,442 --> 01:28:20,652
All women, whether they want
to face it or not...

1322
01:28:20,844 --> 01:28:22,951
...want to see a man
in a tied-up situation.

1323
01:28:23,146 --> 01:28:27,119
They spend their lives trying to get a man
into a tied-up situation.

1324
01:28:27,317 --> 01:28:30,232
Their lives are fulfilled when
they get as many men as they can...

1325
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:32,334
...into a tied-up situation.

1326
01:28:32,522 --> 01:28:35,938
I'd like to untie you right now,
but I can't.

1327
01:28:36,126 --> 01:28:37,698
You believe in people being tied up?

1328
01:28:37,894 --> 01:28:41,810
Only when they might take
the long swim to China.

1329
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:45,941
The long swim to China...

1330
01:28:46,136 --> 01:28:47,515
Shannon!

1331
01:28:47,704 --> 01:28:49,117
- Oh, yeah.
- Stop.

1332
01:28:49,306 --> 01:28:51,948
Stop it. Stop it, Shannon.

1333
01:28:52,175 --> 01:28:54,623
I'm gonna call Dr. Lopez.

1334
01:28:54,811 --> 01:28:58,056
And I'm gonna have you carted off
to the Casa de Locos.

1335
01:28:58,248 --> 01:29:00,662
- And you'll be put in a cell, alone!
- Off, off!

1336
01:29:00,851 --> 01:29:03,095
With hay on the floor and a bucket.
And that's all!

1337
01:29:03,286 --> 01:29:04,631
Off! Off! Off!

1338
01:29:04,821 --> 01:29:06,132
Off!

1339
01:29:06,323 --> 01:29:09,170
- Here, Mr. Shannon, drink this.
- Untie me!

1340
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:12,103
You can holler
and howl to your heart's content...

1341
01:29:12,295 --> 01:29:14,675
...in the Casa de Locos.
All day and all night.

1342
01:29:14,865 --> 01:29:18,645
I'm a citizen with inalienable rights. Get
me the consul. I demand to see the consul!

1343
01:29:18,835 --> 01:29:21,648
Please, Mr. Shannon,
drink this poppy seed tea.

1344
01:29:21,838 --> 01:29:24,378
How can I with the widow Faulk
sitting on me?

1345
01:29:24,574 --> 01:29:27,284
Here, give me that tea. I made it.
I'll give it to him.

1346
01:29:27,477 --> 01:29:29,687
Drink this, you buzzard!

1347
01:29:30,614 --> 01:29:32,653
It's scalding.

1348
01:29:32,849 --> 01:29:35,354
Thank you, Maxine.
That's all I needed.

1349
01:29:35,552 --> 01:29:37,329
To have my mouth burned raw.

1350
01:29:37,521 --> 01:29:40,664
Now, if you could put some splinters
of bamboo under my fingernails...

1351
01:29:40,857 --> 01:29:45,001
...and have my eyelids cut off...
- Mrs. Faulk, let me.

1352
01:29:45,328 --> 01:29:46,605
Okay, honey.

1353
01:29:46,796 --> 01:29:48,607
You take over completely.

1354
01:29:48,798 --> 01:29:50,439
He's entirely yours.

1355
01:29:50,634 --> 01:29:52,741
May I make a further suggestion,
Maxine?

1356
01:29:52,936 --> 01:29:55,578
Why don't you go moonlight bathing
with your beach boys.

1357
01:29:55,772 --> 01:30:00,553
Don't let my presence stop you, any more
than old Fred's presence used to stop you.

1358
01:30:01,144 --> 01:30:03,524
You bastard!

1359
01:30:04,281 --> 01:30:05,592
Pepe.

1360
01:30:05,782 --> 01:30:07,593
Pedro.

1361
01:30:08,919 --> 01:30:11,834
You no-good bastard!

1362
01:30:16,393 --> 01:30:18,898
That was cruel, Mr. Shannon.

1363
01:30:19,095 --> 01:30:20,872
Childishly cruel.

1364
01:30:21,064 --> 01:30:25,879
I can't stand for a person I respect
to behave like a small, cruel boy.

1365
01:30:26,069 --> 01:30:30,076
Now, what do you respect in me,
Miss Thin-Standing-Up-Female-Buddha?

1366
01:30:30,307 --> 01:30:32,847
I respect anybody who has had to...

1367
01:30:33,043 --> 01:30:35,719
...fight and howl for his decency.

1368
01:30:35,912 --> 01:30:39,089
- What decency?
- Yes. His decency.

1369
01:30:39,282 --> 01:30:40,490
And his...

1370
01:30:40,684 --> 01:30:42,325
His bit of goodness.

1371
01:30:42,519 --> 01:30:45,161
Far more than I respect
those lucky ones who've...

1372
01:30:45,355 --> 01:30:48,202
...had theirs handed out to them at birth...

1373
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:54,276
...and never afterwards snatched
away from them by unbearable torments.

1374
01:30:54,464 --> 01:30:56,844
A chronicle no longer gold

1375
01:30:57,734 --> 01:31:00,649
A bargaining with mist and mold

1376
01:31:00,837 --> 01:31:04,253
Listen to him,
saying them over and over.

1377
01:31:04,441 --> 01:31:06,912
The lines of his new poem.

1378
01:31:07,177 --> 01:31:10,615
Like a blind man climbing a staircase
that leads nowhere.

1379
01:31:10,814 --> 01:31:12,455
Should you be in there
helping him?

1380
01:31:12,649 --> 01:31:16,827
He'll call me when he needs me.
Drink this, Mr. Shannon.

1381
01:31:19,689 --> 01:31:22,365
I have no right to ask the question...

1382
01:31:22,559 --> 01:31:26,100
...but why did you go to such lengths
to protect Miss Fellowes...

1383
01:31:26,296 --> 01:31:28,369
...for whom you have no high regard...

1384
01:31:28,732 --> 01:31:32,978
...and to equal lengths to hurt Mrs. Faulk,
for whom you have?

1385
01:31:33,169 --> 01:31:35,117
Maxine's indestructible.

1386
01:31:35,305 --> 01:31:36,752
Is she?

1387
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:38,649
Or does she just give that impression?

1388
01:31:38,842 --> 01:31:42,223
The only impression Maxine
gives is herself. Maxine's Maxine.

1389
01:31:42,412 --> 01:31:46,522
And I'm a no-good bastard.
Lay it to the drink. I'm a bad drunk.

1390
01:31:46,716 --> 01:31:49,529
You were drunk when you came
to Miss Fellowes' rescue.

1391
01:31:49,986 --> 01:31:51,558
I got drunker.

1392
01:31:54,457 --> 01:31:57,065
Drink isn't your problem, Mr. Shannon.

1393
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,300
And what is my problem, Miss Jelkes?

1394
01:32:00,497 --> 01:32:02,604
The oldest one in the world.

1395
01:32:02,799 --> 01:32:06,180
The need to believe in someone,
or something.

1396
01:32:06,703 --> 01:32:09,584
Almost anyone. Almost anything.

1397
01:32:09,773 --> 01:32:13,052
- Your voice sounds hopeless about it.
- Oh, no, I'm not hopeless about it.

1398
01:32:13,243 --> 01:32:16,852
In fact, I've...
I've discovered something to believe in.

1399
01:32:17,547 --> 01:32:18,926
What?

1400
01:32:21,518 --> 01:32:24,831
Broken barriers between people.

1401
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:27,535
A wanting to help each other.

1402
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:29,398
Through nights like this.

1403
01:32:29,592 --> 01:32:31,597
One-night stands.

1404
01:32:32,495 --> 01:32:37,003
One-night communications
between them.

1405
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,114
On a veranda...

1406
01:32:39,302 --> 01:32:42,513
...outside their separate cubicles.

1407
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:46,853
You don't mean physically, do you?

1408
01:32:48,344 --> 01:32:50,849
- No.
- I didn't think you did.

1409
01:32:51,047 --> 01:32:57,227
An intercourse not well-designed
For beings of a golden kind

1410
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:00,494
Whose native green must arch above

1411
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:03,969
The earth's obscene, corrupting love

1412
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,267
Is that what you advocate for me?

1413
01:33:06,463 --> 01:33:09,503
Is that what you call a human
relationship, you and Grandpa there?

1414
01:33:09,799 --> 01:33:12,942
Yes, Mr. Shannon. Yes. Yes, I do.

1415
01:33:13,136 --> 01:33:16,483
We make a home for each other,
my grandfather and I.

1416
01:33:16,673 --> 01:33:19,850
Oh, I don't mean a regular home,
because...

1417
01:33:20,043 --> 01:33:22,253
...I don't regard a home as a...

1418
01:33:22,445 --> 01:33:25,326
As a place, a building...

1419
01:33:25,515 --> 01:33:27,486
...bricks, wood, stone.

1420
01:33:28,785 --> 01:33:30,630
I think of a home...

1421
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:34,031
...as something two people have
between them.

1422
01:33:34,224 --> 01:33:35,967
In which each can...

1423
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,835
...nest, rest...

1424
01:33:39,028 --> 01:33:41,101
...live in, emotionally speaking.

1425
01:33:41,297 --> 01:33:43,745
Does that make any sense to you,
Mr. Shannon?

1426
01:33:43,933 --> 01:33:45,505
Yes, but...

1427
01:33:45,702 --> 01:33:47,377
Well, go on. But what?

1428
01:33:48,605 --> 01:33:51,053
Oh, leave it, I'd only say something
to hurt you.

1429
01:33:52,008 --> 01:33:54,047
I'm not thin-skinned, Mr. Shannon.

1430
01:33:54,677 --> 01:33:57,888
Very well. When a bird builds a nest
to rest in and live in...

1431
01:33:58,081 --> 01:34:01,497
...he doesn't build it in a falling-down tree.
- I'm not a bird, Mr. Shannon.

1432
01:34:01,684 --> 01:34:05,361
He builds with an eye to the permanence
of the location, and for the purpose of...

1433
01:34:05,555 --> 01:34:08,265
...mating and propagating the species.

1434
01:34:08,458 --> 01:34:12,875
I still say I'm not a bird, Mr. Shannon.
I'm a human being.

1435
01:34:13,062 --> 01:34:16,534
And when one of that unique species...

1436
01:34:16,733 --> 01:34:18,772
...builds its nest in the heart of another...

1437
01:34:18,968 --> 01:34:21,746
...the questions of permanence
and propagation...

1438
01:34:21,938 --> 01:34:25,820
...aren't the first, or even
the last things to be considered.

1439
01:34:26,242 --> 01:34:28,747
What is important...

1440
01:34:28,978 --> 01:34:30,858
...is that one is never alone.

1441
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:23,809
You've been asking all the questions,
Miss Jelkes. May I ask one of you?

1442
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,040
Ask it. There's no limit on questions
here tonight.

1443
01:35:27,237 --> 01:35:28,650
And on answers?

1444
01:35:28,838 --> 01:35:32,584
None that I can think of, Mr. Shannon,
between you and me.

1445
01:35:32,775 --> 01:35:35,349
This, then, is the question.

1446
01:35:35,678 --> 01:35:37,853
Have you never in your life
had any kind of...

1447
01:35:38,047 --> 01:35:39,722
...love life?

1448
01:35:41,684 --> 01:35:43,757
Would you mind repeating the question?

1449
01:35:43,953 --> 01:35:49,098
Have you never in your life or travels
had any encounter with any experience of...

1450
01:35:49,292 --> 01:35:52,730
...what Larry the Crackpot
would describe as a love life?

1451
01:35:54,664 --> 01:35:57,408
There are worse things than chastity,
Mr. Shannon.

1452
01:35:58,001 --> 01:35:59,744
Yes, lunacy and death.

1453
01:35:59,936 --> 01:36:02,407
Well, if you don't want to answer
the question...

1454
01:36:02,772 --> 01:36:05,277
No, no, I don't mind answering.

1455
01:36:06,442 --> 01:36:07,821
Yes.

1456
01:36:08,011 --> 01:36:13,190
Yes. I have had two experiences...
Well, encounters with.

1457
01:36:13,783 --> 01:36:14,991
Two.

1458
01:36:15,485 --> 01:36:17,558
Yes, I said two.

1459
01:36:19,155 --> 01:36:20,625
When I was 16.

1460
01:36:21,491 --> 01:36:23,200
Sixteen.

1461
01:36:23,993 --> 01:36:25,964
Yes, 16.

1462
01:36:28,898 --> 01:36:31,176
When I was 16...

1463
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:33,849
...every Saturday I would go
to the Saturday matinee...

1464
01:36:34,037 --> 01:36:36,247
...at the Nantucket Movie Theater.

1465
01:36:36,439 --> 01:36:40,150
That was soon after my parents were
killed in an automobile accident...

1466
01:36:40,343 --> 01:36:42,655
...and I was very alone.

1467
01:36:43,446 --> 01:36:46,259
Well, one day a young man...

1468
01:36:46,449 --> 01:36:49,489
...sat down beside me
and pushed his knee against mine.

1469
01:36:50,219 --> 01:36:55,262
I moved over but he moved over too,
and continued the pressure.

1470
01:36:55,491 --> 01:36:57,530
I jumped up and screamed...

1471
01:36:57,727 --> 01:37:00,904
...and he was arrested
for molesting a minor.

1472
01:37:01,564 --> 01:37:03,512
Is he still in the Nantucket jail?

1473
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,948
No. No, I got him out.

1474
01:37:06,135 --> 01:37:08,982
I told the police it was a Garbo picture.

1475
01:37:09,205 --> 01:37:10,709
It was a Garbo picture.

1476
01:37:11,074 --> 01:37:13,249
And that I was just overexcited.

1477
01:37:13,443 --> 01:37:15,118
And the second?

1478
01:37:16,379 --> 01:37:20,022
The second experience
is much more recent.

1479
01:37:20,516 --> 01:37:25,229
Only four years ago,
when Nonno and I were in Hong Kong.

1480
01:37:26,522 --> 01:37:27,730
One evening...

1481
01:37:27,924 --> 01:37:31,305
...in the Palm Court of Cliff Hotel...

1482
01:37:31,494 --> 01:37:34,637
...we met this middle-aged, sort of...

1483
01:37:34,831 --> 01:37:37,746
...nondescript Australian salesman.

1484
01:37:37,934 --> 01:37:42,681
You know, plump, bald, spotted,
and terribly over-friendly.

1485
01:37:43,406 --> 01:37:46,219
I did a sketch of him
that was shamelessly flattering...

1486
01:37:46,409 --> 01:37:48,687
...for which he paid me
more than my usual price.

1487
01:37:48,878 --> 01:37:51,122
Ten Malayan dollars.

1488
01:37:51,547 --> 01:37:56,430
Then, he asked me out
in a sampan with him.

1489
01:37:57,053 --> 01:38:00,230
Well, he'd been so generous...

1490
01:38:00,423 --> 01:38:02,268
...I accepted.

1491
01:38:02,525 --> 01:38:03,938
I did.

1492
01:38:04,127 --> 01:38:05,404
I accepted.

1493
01:38:06,462 --> 01:38:08,967
Grandfather went up to bed.

1494
01:38:09,165 --> 01:38:11,841
And I went out in the sampan...

1495
01:38:12,035 --> 01:38:14,984
...with the Aussie underwear salesman.

1496
01:38:16,806 --> 01:38:19,778
I noticed he became more and more...

1497
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:22,023
What?

1498
01:38:22,812 --> 01:38:24,783
Agitated.

1499
01:38:25,681 --> 01:38:28,528
Well, finally, he leant towards me.

1500
01:38:28,718 --> 01:38:31,667
We were vis-a-vis in the sampan.

1501
01:38:31,854 --> 01:38:36,897
And he looked intensely and passionately
into my eyes and said:

1502
01:38:37,093 --> 01:38:40,634
"Miss Jelkes, would you do me a favor?

1503
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:43,301
Would you do something for me?"

1504
01:38:43,766 --> 01:38:45,737
"What?" I asked.

1505
01:38:45,968 --> 01:38:47,848
"Well," he said:

1506
01:38:48,037 --> 01:38:50,212
"If I turn my back...

1507
01:38:50,406 --> 01:38:52,854
...if I look the other way...

1508
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:58,727
...will you take off some piece
of your clothing and let me hold it?

1509
01:38:58,915 --> 01:39:00,487
Just hold it."

1510
01:39:01,017 --> 01:39:04,262
And what did you do in this situation?

1511
01:39:04,821 --> 01:39:06,792
I did as he asked.

1512
01:39:07,123 --> 01:39:08,764
And he kept his promise.

1513
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:12,601
He kept his back turned
until I said "Ready"...

1514
01:39:12,929 --> 01:39:15,605
...and threw him the piece of my clothing.

1515
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:19,338
But what did he do with it?

1516
01:39:19,769 --> 01:39:22,217
I don't know.
I looked the other way.

1517
01:39:23,005 --> 01:39:26,546
- And that experience, you call that a...?
- A love experience?

1518
01:39:26,742 --> 01:39:28,189
Yes, I do, Mr. Shannon.

1519
01:39:28,611 --> 01:39:32,527
That sad little, dirty little episode,
you call it a...

1520
01:39:32,715 --> 01:39:36,859
Sad, it certainly was for the poor little
man. But why do you call it dirty?

1521
01:39:39,322 --> 01:39:42,635
You mean
you weren't disgusted by it?

1522
01:39:42,825 --> 01:39:45,968
Nothing human disgusts me,
Mr. Shannon.

1523
01:39:46,162 --> 01:39:49,578
Unless it's unkind or violent.

1524
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,112
And I told you how...

1525
01:39:53,402 --> 01:39:55,145
How gentle he was.

1526
01:39:56,105 --> 01:39:59,248
Apologetic, shy.

1527
01:39:59,575 --> 01:40:01,750
And really very...

1528
01:40:02,378 --> 01:40:03,791
...well...

1529
01:40:04,614 --> 01:40:06,653
...delicate about it.

1530
01:40:09,018 --> 01:40:14,698
However, I do grant you
that it was rather on the fantastic level.

1531
01:40:15,525 --> 01:40:16,802
What are you doing?

1532
01:40:16,993 --> 01:40:18,565
Untying you.

1533
01:40:18,761 --> 01:40:20,709
Why? Why now?

1534
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:26,380
I think the spook is exorcised, Mr. Shannon.
You've ceased to struggle.

1535
01:40:26,569 --> 01:40:31,009
And acceptance of life is surely
the first requisite for living it.

1536
01:40:39,549 --> 01:40:43,795
Who was the person you told Maxine
you'd helped through a crackup like this?

1537
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,427
Oh, that.

1538
01:40:48,124 --> 01:40:49,833
Myself.

1539
01:40:51,127 --> 01:40:52,972
Oh. Oh, you?

1540
01:40:53,429 --> 01:40:55,138
Oh, yes.

1541
01:40:55,765 --> 01:40:58,771
I had a spook like yours once.

1542
01:40:59,035 --> 01:41:01,813
I just had a different name for him.

1543
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:05,449
I used to call him the "blue devil."

1544
01:41:05,641 --> 01:41:10,786
- And we had quite a contest between us.
- Which you...

1545
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,552
Which you won.

1546
01:41:13,149 --> 01:41:15,723
I couldn't afford to lose.

1547
01:41:16,219 --> 01:41:19,965
How did you...?
How did you beat this blue devil of yours?

1548
01:41:20,356 --> 01:41:22,531
I showed him I could endure him.

1549
01:41:22,725 --> 01:41:26,106
- And made him respect my endurance.
- How?

1550
01:41:26,862 --> 01:41:29,174
Just by enduring.

1551
01:41:29,365 --> 01:41:32,746
Endurance is something that spooks
and blue devils respect.

1552
01:41:32,935 --> 01:41:35,247
And they respect all the tricks...

1553
01:41:35,438 --> 01:41:39,354
...that panicky people use to outwit
and outlast their panic.

1554
01:41:39,542 --> 01:41:42,753
Like taking a few deep,
deep breaths?

1555
01:41:42,945 --> 01:41:45,155
Or rum-cocos.

1556
01:41:45,681 --> 01:41:49,119
Or even beach boys.

1557
01:41:49,452 --> 01:41:52,993
Anything. Everything we do
to give them the slip.

1558
01:41:53,189 --> 01:41:56,138
So keep on going.

1559
01:41:56,325 --> 01:41:57,795
To where?

1560
01:41:59,829 --> 01:42:02,505
To somewhere like this, perhaps.

1561
01:42:03,699 --> 01:42:07,342
After long and difficult travels...

1562
01:42:07,536 --> 01:42:11,816
...the subterranean travels
that the spooked and bedeviled take...

1563
01:42:12,008 --> 01:42:16,857
...through the unlighted sides of
their own natures until finally...

1564
01:42:17,046 --> 01:42:19,494
...they see a faint gray light.

1565
01:42:19,682 --> 01:42:22,324
And keep climbing towards it.

1566
01:42:22,785 --> 01:42:25,063
Are you still following
that faint gray light?

1567
01:42:25,254 --> 01:42:28,692
Any light is a good light to see by
at the end of a long, dark tunnel...

1568
01:42:28,891 --> 01:42:31,499
...that you thought would be
never-ending.

1569
01:42:31,694 --> 01:42:36,043
That only God or death
could put a stop to.

1570
01:42:36,232 --> 01:42:38,476
Especially when you...

1571
01:42:39,435 --> 01:42:43,579
Since I was
far from sure about God.

1572
01:42:43,806 --> 01:42:45,913
Are you still unsure about him?

1573
01:42:47,343 --> 01:42:50,258
Not as unsure as I was.

1574
01:42:55,184 --> 01:42:57,325
He's still struggling.

1575
01:42:59,422 --> 01:43:02,860
Yes. He's got to the end of his rope.

1576
01:43:03,059 --> 01:43:04,870
And any further, he cannot get.

1577
01:43:05,061 --> 01:43:09,671
Can you honestly tell me
that he is not able to feel pain and panic?

1578
01:43:09,865 --> 01:43:14,043
- You mean, he's one of God's creatures?
- Yes, if you want to put it that way.

1579
01:43:15,004 --> 01:43:18,476
Mr. Shannon, cut him loose.

1580
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:22,480
All right.

1581
01:43:22,912 --> 01:43:27,295
We'll play God tonight, like kids play houses
with old broken crates and boxes.

1582
01:43:27,483 --> 01:43:30,330
We'll cut the lizard loose
so that he can go back to his bushes.

1583
01:43:30,519 --> 01:43:34,299
Because God won't do it
and we are playing God here tonight.

1584
01:43:41,063 --> 01:43:42,670
Mr. Shannon.

1585
01:43:52,742 --> 01:43:54,155
I knew you'd do that.

1586
01:44:06,389 --> 01:44:08,997
What the hell are you doing, Shannon?

1587
01:44:13,662 --> 01:44:17,271
I just cut loose one of God's creatures
at the end of his rope.

1588
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,975
What for?

1589
01:44:20,336 --> 01:44:23,114
So that one of God's creatures
could be free from panic...

1590
01:44:23,305 --> 01:44:27,551
...and scamper home safe and free.
A little act of grace, Maxine.

1591
01:44:28,511 --> 01:44:30,925
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!
Where are you?

1592
01:44:31,113 --> 01:44:33,960
Here, Grandfather.
Right here.

1593
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:39,397
It finished! Quick, before I forget it,
pencil and paper. Hurry, please!

1594
01:44:46,529 --> 01:44:49,569
- Ready?
- Yes. All ready, Grandfather.

1595
01:44:51,367 --> 01:44:55,181
How calmly does the olive branch

1596
01:44:56,205 --> 01:44:59,643
Observe the sky begin to blanch

1597
01:45:00,342 --> 01:45:03,450
Without a cry, without a prayer

1598
01:45:04,113 --> 01:45:07,153
With no betrayal of despair

1599
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:13,167
Some time while night obscures the tree

1600
01:45:13,756 --> 01:45:17,103
The zenith of its life will be

1601
01:45:17,293 --> 01:45:20,071
Gone past forever

1602
01:45:20,863 --> 01:45:23,107
And from thence

1603
01:45:23,766 --> 01:45:27,682
A second history will commence

1604
01:45:28,671 --> 01:45:31,950
A chronicle no longer gold

1605
01:45:32,341 --> 01:45:36,052
A bargaining with mist and mold

1606
01:45:36,745 --> 01:45:40,388
And finally, the broken stem

1607
01:45:40,983 --> 01:45:42,794
The plummeting to earth

1608
01:45:43,586 --> 01:45:47,263
And then, an intercourse

1609
01:45:47,456 --> 01:45:52,339
Not well designed for beings
Of a golden kind

1610
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:55,266
Whose native green must arch above

1611
01:45:55,464 --> 01:45:59,437
The earth's obscene, corrupting love

1612
01:46:00,503 --> 01:46:03,975
And still the ripe fruit and the branch

1613
01:46:04,173 --> 01:46:08,021
Observe the sky begin to blanch

1614
01:46:08,811 --> 01:46:11,851
Without a cry, without a prayer

1615
01:46:12,948 --> 01:46:16,364
With no betrayal of despair

1616
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,627
Oh, courage

1617
01:46:20,589 --> 01:46:24,972
Could you not as well
Select a second place to dwell

1618
01:46:26,495 --> 01:46:29,672
Not only in that golden tree

1619
01:46:30,799 --> 01:46:34,738
But in the frightened heart of me?

1620
01:46:37,239 --> 01:46:39,346
Have you got that, Hannah?

1621
01:46:40,309 --> 01:46:42,223
Yes, Grandfather.

1622
01:46:42,411 --> 01:46:45,519
- All of it?
- Every word.

1623
01:46:46,482 --> 01:46:49,590
- And it's finished?
- Yes.

1624
01:46:49,785 --> 01:46:54,498
- Finally finished?
- Yes, finally finished.

1625
01:46:55,024 --> 01:46:56,665
And it's good.

1626
01:46:57,459 --> 01:46:59,202
Beautiful.

1627
01:47:00,029 --> 01:47:04,173
- Is it good?
- Beautiful, Grandfather.

1628
01:47:05,568 --> 01:47:08,949
Oh, Grandfather, I'm so happy for you.

1629
01:47:09,371 --> 01:47:12,582
Thank you for writing such a lovely poem.

1630
01:47:12,975 --> 01:47:15,253
It was worth the long wait.

1631
01:47:17,713 --> 01:47:20,662
Can you sleep a little now?

1632
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:23,360
I'll fetch your shawl.

1633
01:47:24,186 --> 01:47:26,657
I'd like to pray now.

1634
01:47:56,518 --> 01:47:58,193
Oh, God.

1635
01:48:00,456 --> 01:48:03,837
Please can't we stop now?

1636
01:48:37,192 --> 01:48:39,072
He won't need the shawl.

1637
01:48:40,029 --> 01:48:43,672
God has played God
and set him free.

1638
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,298
Oh, courage

1639
01:49:14,163 --> 01:49:15,838
Could you not as well

1640
01:49:16,031 --> 01:49:18,707
Have found a second place to dwell

1641
01:49:20,102 --> 01:49:22,141
Not only in that golden tree

1642
01:49:23,672 --> 01:49:27,383
But in the frightened heart of me?

1643
01:50:07,216 --> 01:50:08,663
Miss Jelkes.

1644
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:12,124
What are you doing?
You're not gonna leave us today, are you?

1645
01:50:12,321 --> 01:50:15,634
There's no reason to delay.
Everything has been done.

1646
01:50:15,824 --> 01:50:18,466
Thanks to your kindness
and Mrs. Faulk's...

1647
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:21,803
...Dr. Lopez and all the good people
in the village.

1648
01:50:27,803 --> 01:50:31,310
I know now why he insisted
we go on with this trip.

1649
01:50:31,507 --> 01:50:32,977
He knew it was the end.

1650
01:50:33,175 --> 01:50:36,989
And he wanted it to come where he could
be buried peacefully on a green hilltop...

1651
01:50:37,179 --> 01:50:40,424
...within sight and sound of the sea,
his "cradle of life."

1652
01:50:41,383 --> 01:50:44,230
- You're going on, are you?
- Yes, naturally.

1653
01:50:44,419 --> 01:50:46,833
- Where?
- Well, first I shall go into town...

1654
01:50:47,022 --> 01:50:48,469
...and try my luck in the plaza.

1655
01:50:48,657 --> 01:50:50,366
What luck do you expect in the plaza?

1656
01:50:50,559 --> 01:50:54,737
Do you expect the old lady selling tacos
to buy your sketches like hotcakes?

1657
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:58,812
There'll be some tourists, and I shall give
them what is known as the "hard sell."

1658
01:50:59,001 --> 01:51:01,814
Miss Jelkes, you're not operating
on the realistic level.

1659
01:51:02,004 --> 01:51:04,817
Yes, I am. We are operating
on a realistic level...

1660
01:51:05,007 --> 01:51:07,387
...when we are doing the things
that have to be done.

1661
01:51:07,576 --> 01:51:12,653
But you can't go on alone. Think of how
it will feel after so many years.

1662
01:51:13,248 --> 01:51:15,856
I shall know how it feels when I feel it.

1663
01:51:16,618 --> 01:51:18,896
Miss Jelkes, I wonder...

1664
01:51:19,788 --> 01:51:21,668
Yes. What do you wonder?

1665
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:24,038
Well, I was wondering...

1666
01:51:24,226 --> 01:51:28,540
...if it was possible for us
to travel together.

1667
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:31,235
I mean, travel together.

1668
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,709
Do you really think we could?

1669
01:51:33,902 --> 01:51:38,717
I don't see why not,
both of us sort of at loose ends.

1670
01:51:39,508 --> 01:51:45,893
I feel sure the impracticality of it
would be all too clear to you later.

1671
01:51:46,315 --> 01:51:49,731
I think it would only prove awkward
and embarrassing for both of us.

1672
01:51:49,918 --> 01:51:52,025
- Miss Jelkes...
- I wonder if Mrs. Faulk is about?

1673
01:51:52,221 --> 01:51:54,965
- I would like to thank her.
- Yeah.

1674
01:51:55,724 --> 01:51:59,504
She's about.
And about to make an announcement.

1675
01:51:59,695 --> 01:52:01,643
Sit down, you two.

1676
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:03,502
Sit down.

1677
01:52:09,538 --> 01:52:12,510
I got a proposition to make,
a business proposition.

1678
01:52:12,708 --> 01:52:14,747
You know, Miss Jelkes, honey,
you impress me.

1679
01:52:15,043 --> 01:52:18,117
Very favorably. The way
you dished up that fish and all.

1680
01:52:18,313 --> 01:52:22,320
So favorably, in fact, that I'm prepared
to make you the following proposition.

1681
01:52:23,085 --> 01:52:24,930
What proposition, Mrs. Faulk?

1682
01:52:25,921 --> 01:52:27,664
I want a Coke.

1683
01:52:30,826 --> 01:52:32,831
Beer. Beer!

1684
01:52:38,333 --> 01:52:41,544
My proposition is this:
that you take over here.

1685
01:52:42,371 --> 01:52:45,377
The place furnishes a living
plus a neat little profit.

1686
01:52:45,874 --> 01:52:50,621
I take in about 4000 a year,
after expenses.

1687
01:52:50,812 --> 01:52:52,419
Four thousand dollars.

1688
01:52:52,614 --> 01:52:55,119
It wouldn't surprise me
if you couldn't do even better...

1689
01:52:55,317 --> 01:52:59,063
...provided Shannon there
didn't drink up your share of the profits.

1690
01:53:00,255 --> 01:53:01,634
Well, that's the deal.

1691
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:04,138
We split the profits fifty-fifty.

1692
01:53:04,326 --> 01:53:07,173
Even-steven.
Share and share alike.

1693
01:53:07,362 --> 01:53:09,310
Does that make any sense to you?

1694
01:53:10,532 --> 01:53:13,140
Maxine. Are you all right?

1695
01:53:13,435 --> 01:53:16,213
Of course I'm all right.
What do you mean, am I all right?

1696
01:53:16,405 --> 01:53:20,879
My only reason for including you
on this deal is a man's presence is required.

1697
01:53:21,076 --> 01:53:25,755
There's gotta be a man. That's one of
the basic principles of hotel administration.

1698
01:53:25,948 --> 01:53:28,988
There's gotta be a man to make
the place attractive to the ladies.

1699
01:53:29,184 --> 01:53:31,394
Wives of the men that go fishing.

1700
01:53:31,787 --> 01:53:34,668
Matter of fact, my offer is contingent
on the presence of a man.

1701
01:53:34,856 --> 01:53:38,101
- There's no deal unless Shannon stays on.
- What about you, Mrs. Faulk?

1702
01:53:38,293 --> 01:53:40,673
Me? I'm fed up with this place.

1703
01:53:40,862 --> 01:53:43,606
Fed up to the teeth, into the gums
and the jawbone.

1704
01:53:43,799 --> 01:53:46,179
- Jungle rot's set in.
- Where are you going?

1705
01:53:46,368 --> 01:53:49,545
Well, I'm not going on any
of your Blake Tours, that's for sure!

1706
01:53:49,738 --> 01:53:51,379
I'm heading north.

1707
01:53:51,974 --> 01:53:54,320
El Paso, maybe. Yeah, I like El Paso.

1708
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:57,224
Air-conditioned cocktail lounges.

1709
01:53:57,412 --> 01:54:01,795
Fifteen-to-one martinis and mirrors that
don't scare you when they look at you!

1710
01:54:02,084 --> 01:54:06,262
You know, I'm a young woman. Attractive,
too, if I can get to a decent beauty parlor.

1711
01:54:06,455 --> 01:54:10,098
Don't you worry about the widow Faulk.
She'll have a ball!

1712
01:54:13,795 --> 01:54:16,801
- Fantastic.
- Yes, Mr. Shannon.

1713
01:54:16,999 --> 01:54:18,810
Fantastic is what it is.

1714
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:23,010
You were building your nest
and you didn't even know it.

1715
01:54:23,505 --> 01:54:25,180
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1716
01:54:25,374 --> 01:54:28,551
- At least let me drive you into town.
- No, thank you, I prefer to walk.

1717
01:54:28,744 --> 01:54:33,024
What you could do for me, though,
is have my luggage sent in after me.

1718
01:54:33,281 --> 01:54:35,627
Oh, I almost forgot.

1719
01:54:35,817 --> 01:54:40,598
I found this in the pocket of my smock
when I was packing this morning.

1720
01:54:40,789 --> 01:54:43,294
Yes, I want you to have it.

1721
01:54:43,492 --> 01:54:45,497
I couldn't possibly accept,
Mr. Shannon.

1722
01:54:45,694 --> 01:54:49,110
No, take it, please. Hock it.
It'll pay your way back to the States.

1723
01:54:49,297 --> 01:54:50,608
That's a real amethyst...

1724
01:54:50,799 --> 01:54:54,374
...so don't let the local loan shark
give you less than 1800 pesos for it.

1725
01:54:54,569 --> 01:54:57,609
Its value has been well-established
over the years.

1726
01:54:58,807 --> 01:55:00,618
Very well, Mr. Shannon.

1727
01:55:00,809 --> 01:55:03,952
I'll send the pawn ticket
back to you so that you can redeem it.

1728
01:55:55,564 --> 01:55:58,308
- What are you doing, Maxine?
- Packing.

1729
01:56:03,405 --> 01:56:04,909
Go on, fall apart.

1730
01:56:05,373 --> 01:56:08,720
Everything's falling apart,
including you and Shannon!

1731
01:56:09,044 --> 01:56:12,016
Complimentary rum-coco.
It's a speciality of the Costa Verde.

1732
01:56:12,214 --> 01:56:16,358
I don't want a rum-coco. If I wanted
a rum-coco, I'd make a rum-coco.

1733
01:56:18,687 --> 01:56:22,865
She's gone, Maxine.
The poem's finished.

1734
01:56:24,359 --> 01:56:27,502
You mean she's not gonna
take me up on my proposition?

1735
01:56:28,330 --> 01:56:30,835
Oh, she's not.

1736
01:56:31,867 --> 01:56:33,246
I am.

1737
01:56:34,202 --> 01:56:35,740
That is, if you...

1738
01:56:36,204 --> 01:56:39,585
If you really need a man around here.

1739
01:57:05,233 --> 01:57:10,116
It's not hot yet, Shannon.
Why don't we go down to the beach.

1740
01:57:10,839 --> 01:57:12,377
Well, I can...

1741
01:57:12,841 --> 01:57:16,257
I can get down the hill, Maxine,
but I'm not too sure about getting...

1742
01:57:16,444 --> 01:57:17,948
...back up.

1743
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:23,529
I'll get you back up, baby.
I'll always get you back up.

1744
01:57:35,063 --> 01:57:37,034
