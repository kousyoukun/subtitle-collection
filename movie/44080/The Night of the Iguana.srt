1
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:34,727
Let the words of my mouth,
and the meditation of my heart...

2
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:37,726
...be always acceptable in thy sight.

3
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:40,121
O Lord, my strength...

4
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,282
...and my redeemer.

5
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:51,526
The sermon for today...

6
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:53,961
...is taken from Proverbs.

7
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:56,561
Chapter 25...

8
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,642
...verse 28.

9
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,244
"He that hath no rule
over his own spirit...

10
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:06,882
...is like a city that is broken down,
and without walls."

11
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:11,684
And I wonder as we examine our hearts
together in this place of worship...

12
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:16,761
...how many of us here can say,
"I rule my own spirit."

13
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:20,321
For how weak is man.

14
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:22,209
How often do we...

15
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,768
How often...

16
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:29,405
How often do we stray from
the straight and narrow.

17
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:33,850
For only when we abide in the Lord
are we like cities without walls.

18
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:37,208
Only then can we defend ourselves
against Satan and his temptations.

19
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:40,131
We cannot rule ourselves alone.

20
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:43,530
God only is our... Is our...

21
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:48,528
God only is our help.

22
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:50,842
And our salvation.

23
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,565
All right! You know!

24
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:58,844
That's why you're here!
To see this city with its broken walls!

25
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:01,127
"Whenever two or three
are gathered in my name"...

26
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,521
...is what scripture says.
That's not why you're here.

27
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,167
Let's change the words. Let's rewrite
the order of the Morning Prayer.

28
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:11,119
Whenever two or three or 20 or 30
or 200 or 300...

29
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,600
...are gathered together
to make whispered comment...

30
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:17,889
...to sit in judgment upon
the condition of a... Of a what?

31
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:19,609
Yes, of a man of God.

32
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:23,326
I said, man of God, and I mean it!

33
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:27,445
Just what you all know, that your
pastor, your spiritual shepherd is...

34
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:32,639
Is the descendant of a clergyman,
the grandson of two bishops.

35
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:36,486
But there were collateral branches to the
family that went forth to brave dangers...

36
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,130
...and who were scalped.

37
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,842
Men with men's hearts,
the wild and free hearts of men!

38
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:45,850
They knew hunger
and they fed their appetites.

39
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:50,687
They fed their appetites.
Appetites that I have inherited.

40
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:54,720
I defy you! Shannon defies you!

41
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:58,201
Get out your tomahawks!
Get out your scalping knives!

42
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,443
Sharpen your scalping knives! Scalp me!

43
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:06,639
I will not and cannot continue to conduct
services in praise and worship of this...

44
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:09,689
...angry, petulant old man
in whom you believe.

45
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:12,923
You've turned your backs on the God
of love and compassion...

46
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:16,322
...and invented for yourself
this cruel, senile delinquent...

47
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:20,882
...who blames the world and all that
he created for his own faults.

48
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:23,965
Close your windows! Close your doors!

49
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,248
Close your hearts
against the truth about God!

50
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,570
Hello there.

51
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,322
- Where are they?
- Still inside the church.

52
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:25,402
I'm sick of dark old churches.

53
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:27,562
I like sunshine.

54
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting what
you were. I mean, what you are.

55
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:35,445
What?

56
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:39,808
Lovely, isn't it?

57
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:43,041
- Yeah.
- What do you call it again?

58
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:48,767
"Cup of gold."
Could you drink from it, really?

59
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:52,607
Champagne for two in <i>copa de oro</i>.

60
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,159
Dr. Shannon.

61
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,003
Miss Fellowes.
Here you are, Miss Peebles.

62
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:05,086
The same brand even.
Fix you up in no time.

63
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:09,130
- I am grateful. How much do I owe you?
- Six pesos-fifty.

64
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,408
But it was only six pesos
in Ciudad Juárez.

65
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:16,723
- I've it written down right here.
- It doesn't matter, Judith, it doesn't.

66
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:20,167
Ciudad Juárez is 1200 miles behind us,
Miss Fellowes.

67
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:23,448
I thought it was too far to go
to save 4 cents.

68
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:36,684
- Are we downhearted?
- No.

69
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:18,329
Fantastic!

70
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:36,481
Did you see that?

71
00:08:36,731 --> 00:08:38,847
Look. There's another.

72
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,888
What have those boys got, Dr. Shannon?

73
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:44,441
Iguanas. Giant lizards native
to this part of Mexico.

74
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:47,330
It is alleged they taste like chicken.

75
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:52,929
You mean they really
eat those awful-looking creatures?

76
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:56,843
- Hank, stop on the bridge.
- Stop?

77
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:59,241
Yeah, on the bridge.

78
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:26,041
What are we stopping for?

79
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:28,122
A moment of beauty, Miss Fellowes.

80
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:31,489
A fleeting glimpse
into the lost world...

81
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,403
...of innocence.

82
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:43,642
Look, Reverend,
we're behind schedule now.

83
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:45,810
Drive on, driver.

84
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:48,609
Okay.

85
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:53,841
My brother in Abilene,
that's Clarence Throxton...

86
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,809
...has a chain of 23 laundromats.

87
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,600
He says all he wants
on his tombstone is:

88
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:04,480
"He liberated the women of Texas
from the bondage of wash day."

89
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,369
Aren't they unbelievable?

90
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:10,524
Squawk, squawk, squawk,
ever since we started.

91
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:14,525
If they want all the comforts of home,
then why don't they stay at home?

92
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:18,161
My goodness, this has been
a rich experience.

93
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:19,480
It sure has.

94
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:21,562
Everything's gone wrong
from the first day.

95
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:26,043
Every calamity in the book.
The whole trip has been hoodooed.

96
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,651
You better get back, Miss Goodall,
where you belong.

97
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,961
You said it was going to be Charlotte.

98
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,122
All right. Charlotte.

99
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:39,240
- I can't go on calling you Dr. Shannon.
- Just "Shannon" will be fine.

100
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:43,400
Couldn't it be Larry,
if you're gonna call me Charlotte?

101
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:45,926
Honey, have a heart.

102
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,844
I have, Larry. I've just discovered.

103
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:51,650
Now you change places with me,
Charlotte, dear.

104
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:55,640
I want to talk to Dr. Shannon
about our itinerary.

105
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:00,880
I'll see you later, Larry.

106
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:09,044
I assume you know that Charlotte
is underaged, Dr. Shannon?

107
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,805
What's that got to do with our itinerary?

108
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,485
If you know what's good for you,
leave her alone.

109
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:17,723
Miss Fellowes, are you aware you are
speaking to an ordained clergyman?

110
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,563
Stop leading her on.

111
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:23,406
I don't know what happened back in
Tierra Caliente and I don't want to know.

112
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:25,562
Because if I did know,
I'd have to take steps.

113
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:27,528
Don't make me take steps,
Dr. Shannon.

114
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:30,000
Now, nothing happened
back in Tierra Caliente.

115
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:34,323
The room clerk got our keys mixed up,
that's all. A mistake, pure and simple.

116
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:37,289
Whatever suspicions you may be
harboring are quite groundless.

117
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:39,567
I can assure you of that.

118
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:44,282
Just leave her alone.
Don't make me take steps.

119
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,486
All right, girls, ready for another song?

120
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:32,924
These pills aren't doing anything for me.
Not anything!

121
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:44,322
- Puncture.
- Blowout.

122
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:46,641
Burned-out brake linings.

123
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,767
Broken fan belt, three flat tires.

124
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:51,570
These are the unavoidable mishaps
of any trip, Miss Fellowes.

125
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,926
Won't take more than a few moments
to change wheels.

126
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:56,600
Says you, reverend.
We're fresh out of wheels to change.

127
00:12:56,771 --> 00:13:00,127
We gotta get that tire off and put on
a patch. Take maybe half an hour.

128
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,327
You take care of it for me, Hank.

129
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:04,769
Judith!

130
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:08,924
- I need you!
- Oh, all right, Peebie.

131
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:33,930
It's lovely, isn't it?

132
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,130
Yeah.

133
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:39,886
Are you really a man of the cloth, Larry?

134
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:43,407
- Who says I'm not?
- No one. I just wondered.

135
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,209
How can you ask such a question?

136
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:48,488
Doesn't Blake's Tours advertise tours
personally conducted by the...

137
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,801
...Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon?

138
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:53,644
Could they make such a claim
without justification?

139
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:55,642
I'm so glad you are.

140
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,563
What do you mean by that?

141
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,963
Well, it's such a noble life.

142
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,441
I mean, being interested in people's souls
and all that.

143
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,167
You can bring so much to people.

144
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:09,083
Someone like me even.

145
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:11,401
I can talk to you.

146
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:15,530
Like, I'd never dream of going swimming
with Reverend Hotchkiss back home.

147
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:16,965
I mean, he's old.

148
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:24,201
Now, lie down on the back seat, Peebie.
Put your feet up.

149
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:28,046
- Driver, have you seen Miss Goodall?
- Yeah, I've seen her.

150
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:30,441
Well? Well, where is she?

151
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:33,364
He's got her. Out there.

152
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:46,209
Charlotte.

153
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:50,203
Charlotte.

154
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:52,443
Charlotte.

155
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:54,240
Charlotte.

156
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,761
- There was this boy back home.
- Charlotte.

157
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:58,649
He thought he was in love with me.

158
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:02,247
- Really, he made life just impossible.
- Charlotte.

159
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:04,766
So Daddy fixed it for me to take a trip.

160
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:08,128
Naturally, he wanted me to be
chaperoned in a strange country.

161
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,646
- Charlotte!
- Life's so odd.

162
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:13,484
- Yeah.
- Lf it hadn't been for that silly boy...

163
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:15,801
...I might never have met you.

164
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:19,008
- Charlotte!
- Take my hand, Larry.

165
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:20,365
What for?

166
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:22,522
So we don't drift apart.

167
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:27,243
Charlotte, I command you
to come back here.

168
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,125
Charlotte Goodall.

169
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:33,761
You only got to come on this trip
because of me!

170
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:38,239
Charlotte. Charlotte, you hear me?

171
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:43,122
Charlotte, I know you can hear me.
You are deliberately defying me.

172
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:47,364
Charlotte!
Charlotte! You stay away from that man!

173
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:49,529
You hear?

174
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,767
Charlotte, your mother put you
in my charge.

175
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:55,525
I am responsible. Charlotte!

176
00:15:57,571 --> 00:16:00,324
You only got to come on this trip
because of me!

177
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:02,523
Charlotte!

178
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:13,649
Why, Miss Fellowes.

179
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:15,210
Dreadful girl.

180
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:20,083
Defied me.
You deliberately defied me!

181
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:24,482
What did you think we were doing
out there, Miss Fellowes? Spawning?

182
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,326
Oh, you beast! You beast!

183
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:30,800
You beast.

184
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:33,891
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
You... You get out of here!

185
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:37,088
- My God, it's 3:00 in the morning.
- I've got to see you.

186
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:40,368
- It's important. My whole life's at stake.
- Oh, well, my job's at stake.

187
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:42,999
You don't have to worry
about this measly old job.

188
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:46,641
My goodness. Back home, my daddy's
got three Ford agencies.

189
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:49,041
At the moment, I don't see a Ford
in my future.

190
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,530
Have you been drinking, Larry?

191
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:54,206
Honey girl, if I'd been drinking,
I wouldn't be here. I'd still be drinking.

192
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:57,249
Then what's wrong?
Why are you all hot and sweaty?

193
00:18:57,411 --> 00:19:01,324
You won't misunderstand me, I mean,
my being here in your room.

194
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:03,049
Promise me you won't think...

195
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:07,966
That boy back home told me that I had
skin that no girl had any right to.

196
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:10,971
Said it should be licensed to have skin
as soft as mine is.

197
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:13,565
- Wasn't it silly of him?
- No.

198
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,801
Yes. I mean, no, no.
No, it should be licensed.

199
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:19,281
I mean, at least until you're...
Until you're old enough...

200
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:23,330
...for a driver's license. Now, you get
out of my room. You get off my bed.

201
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:27,325
I'll... I'll keep my eyes
shut until you've gone out of my room.

202
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:31,326
- Have I grown up too early, Larry?
- Yes. No, I mean... Yes, yes.

203
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:33,721
O Lord, lead me not into temptation.

204
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:37,520
And now, go on home.
I'll find my way all by myself.

205
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:40,444
- That's what I came to tell you.
- What?

206
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,010
I'm going home.

207
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:44,446
Tomorrow, from Puerto Vallarta.

208
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:47,171
I'm catching the plane at Puerto Vallarta.

209
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:52,041
I'll slip away from that possessive old
bitch while she's having her siesta...

210
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:54,281
...and be gone before she knows it.

211
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:56,123
You mustn't tell her where I've gone.

212
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,009
Let her sweat it a little.

213
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:01,527
Let her think
I've just disappeared into the jungle.

214
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,443
But I couldn't let you worry.

215
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:05,567
I had to say goodbye to you...

216
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,722
...or rather, <i>au revoir.</i>

217
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:10,610
Because when you bring them back...

218
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:12,966
...I'll be there waiting for you...

219
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:16,806
<i>... copa de oro</i> in my hair,
just over the border.

220
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:20,327
Honey, the border I'm crossing over
is the border of sanity, honey.

221
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,368
- No.
- Oh, honey, yes.

222
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:24,123
I've got it figured out, darling.

223
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,567
What you should have is a nice big
church in Thunderbird Heights...

224
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:29,084
Daddy's a big wheel there.

225
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:32,243
- And a wife who understands
the nobility of your mission.

226
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:36,120
- No, no.
- Yes, not no. I'll fix it. Daddy will fix it.

227
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,009
- No.
- Yes.

228
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:40,446
"He that hath no rule
over his own spirit is like a...

229
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:42,647
...city that has broken down
and without walls."

230
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:44,449
I'll rule your spirit.

231
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:45,805
I'll hold you.

232
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:49,361
- No. No, no. No.
- Yes. Yes, yes.

233
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:02,969
Charlotte.

234
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:07,530
Charlotte...

235
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:10,484
...I've told you how sorry I am.

236
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:14,563
You can afford to be generous.

237
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:19,410
I was just beside myself with anger.

238
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:24,243
But I never meant to harm you.

239
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:29,206
I wouldn't harm you for all the world.

240
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,604
Charlotte.

241
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:39,284
Charlotte, you've got to forgive me.
I can't stand being so unhappy.

242
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,843
Shannon?

243
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:49,604
Shannon, open the door.

244
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:51,250
You hear me, Shannon.

245
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,971
You've got that child in there.
Open up right now.

246
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:57,248
I've had it. She'll tell my father,
she'll tell everybody.

247
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:05,087
He's got her in there with him.
The door's locked.

248
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:09,130
Nobody's mixed any keys up this time.
I won't have it. I just won't have it.

249
00:22:14,211 --> 00:22:15,963
You're through, Shannon.

250
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:17,325
And I'll see to that.

251
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:20,608
When I finish with you,
there won't be any place left to hide.

252
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:24,002
It's all right, Miss Fellowes.
Virtue is triumphant. Yours, of course.

253
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:27,527
Wait. Just you wait.

254
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:57,086
Good morning. We have a wonderful
trip ahead of us.

255
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,685
Some of the most beautiful
scenery in this part of Mexico.

256
00:22:59,851 --> 00:23:02,684
I took the liberty of getting souvenirs
of our stay in Los Feliz.

257
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:04,364
I love you.

258
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:09,448
No charge. Compliments of the
Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon.

259
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:13,003
Miss Peebles.

260
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:26,040
Where's Miss Fellowes?

261
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:29,362
You think you could pull a stunt
like last night and get away with it?

262
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:31,487
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's in the fan.

263
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:34,127
This morning,
she had a wire all written out...

264
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,441
...to some Judge Fellowes back in Texas.

265
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:39,284
She wants your life story
from the first time you said "Mama."

266
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,124
- How do you know that?
- She asked me to send it, that's how.

267
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,089
I told her that was no part
of no driver's job.

268
00:23:45,251 --> 00:23:48,368
- Good man, Hank.
- You ain't off the hook.

269
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:51,603
Miss Fellowes went over
to <i>Telegráfico</i> herself.

270
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:58,601
She aims to have your hide, Reverend.

271
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,762
Good morning, Miss Fellowes.

272
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:12,604
I'll... I'll drive.

273
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:31,001
We're there, Peebie, your troubles
are over. Now you can have a nice bath.

274
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:34,847
"The Ambos Mundos Hotel
in Puerto Vallarta...

275
00:24:35,011 --> 00:24:38,686
...is a completely modern,
air-conditioned hotel...

276
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:43,005
...on a delightful plaza,
with excellent food and service."

277
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:56,965
Shannon? Shannon, that's our hotel.

278
00:25:00,971 --> 00:25:03,405
Shannon. Stop.

279
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:07,007
Stop this instant.
Shannon. Shannon!

280
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:27,444
What the hell you trying to do,
Reverend? Get us all killed?

281
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:00,289
- You gone crazy or something?
- This is not the Ambos Mundos.

282
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:03,966
It says in the brochure we stop in Ambos
Mundos, in the heart of Puerto Vallarta.

283
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:08,409
Here we are, ladies, this is Mismaloya,
the garden spot of the West Coast.

284
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:10,527
You'll be grateful to me
to your dying days.

285
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:13,364
In all of Mexico,
there's nothing to equal this.

286
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:16,921
The chef is a Chinese, specially
imported from Shanghai by me.

287
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:20,447
Just leave your bags.
The staff will take care of everything.

288
00:26:23,251 --> 00:26:25,606
Take us right back
to Puerto Vallarta where we belong.

289
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:27,443
I'm expecting an important telegram.

290
00:26:27,611 --> 00:26:29,283
- I can't take you no place.
- Why not?

291
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:32,124
Because Reverend's taken the
distributor head, that's why not.

292
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,963
Shannon.

293
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:35,962
Shannon, you won't get away with this!

294
00:26:43,491 --> 00:26:44,810
Fred?

295
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,724
Fred?

296
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:57,928
Shannon.

297
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:01,121
What the hell are you doing
down here out of season?

298
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:03,851
Would you have one of your boys
lug this bag up for me?

299
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:06,164
Pepe.

300
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:12,126
Fred, where are you?

301
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,849
Fred can't hear you, baby.

302
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:15,888
Why? Gone fishing?

303
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,530
How long have you been off it?

304
00:27:17,691 --> 00:27:19,488
- Off what?
- The wagon.

305
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:21,004
I'm not drunk.

306
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:25,289
- Oh, what's the matter with you then?
- Fever, just fever.

307
00:27:25,451 --> 00:27:28,011
- Where's Fred?
- Dead.

308
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:33,163
- Did you say dead?
- That's what I said. Fred's dead.

309
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:36,728
How? When?

310
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,722
Oh, less than four weeks ago.

311
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:43,690
Died with his boots on, though. Hooked
into a big marlin, the marlin won.

312
00:27:43,851 --> 00:27:47,366
I was counting on Fred to bail me out,
straighten me out and bail me out.

313
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:50,443
He was my hope of salvation.
I had all my chips on Fred.

314
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:53,887
- You're going to pieces, aren't you?
- Yeah, yeah. They...

315
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:55,609
They are tearing me to pieces.

316
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:58,604
I was hanging on until I could get
to the hammock on the veranda...

317
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:02,207
...over the rainforest and still-water
beach. It's all that can pull me through.

318
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:05,090
Honey, just lie down the hammock.
I'll fix you a nice rum-coco.

319
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:08,209
No, no, no. If I start drinking
rum-cocos now, I'll never stop.

320
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:12,245
Reverend!
They want us to go back into town.

321
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:16,166
Well, tell them they can't go
back into town.

322
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:18,683
I thought Fred could tame them.

323
00:28:18,851 --> 00:28:22,480
He was a fisherman, and I've got
a busload of man-eating sharks.

324
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:26,403
- I've gotta get those women up here.
- No, you don't.

325
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,881
We're closed in August.
We're always closed in August.

326
00:28:30,051 --> 00:28:32,440
Quit blowing, and blow!

327
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:36,402
Maxine. Maxine, you gotta help me.

328
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:40,840
- Honey, you're really gone.
- Maxine, I can't lose this party.

329
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:44,287
Blake's Tours have put me on probation
because I had a bad party last month.

330
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:47,045
They tried to get me fired,
so now I'm on probation.

331
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:50,999
If I lose this party, I'll be fired for sure.
And what's next, Maxine?

332
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:53,560
There's nothing,
nothing lower than Blake's Tours.

333
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,564
Okay, okay, baby.
If it's that important to you...

334
00:28:57,451 --> 00:28:59,328
...they can stay here.

335
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:03,162
Here comes your sidekick now.

336
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:05,322
His name's Hank. Hank.

337
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:07,447
- You gotta help me with him.
- Sure.

338
00:29:07,611 --> 00:29:09,806
- I'll give him complimentary rum-coco.
- No, no, no.

339
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:11,848
Not until he's got the bus unloaded.

340
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:15,801
You ain't getting away with it.
Some of the ladies are in bad shape.

341
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,531
They'll walk back if you don't give me
that distributor head.

342
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:22,479
They'll drop like flies from sunstroke in
this heat. Hank, I need your cooperation.

343
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,527
This is a test of strength, Hank, between
two men and a crate of wet hens.

344
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:30,125
You know that, don't you?
I know what I'm doing, Hank.

345
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:31,406
Don't you forget that.

346
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:34,529
Now, the bell cow sent a telegram from
Los Feliz this morning, right?

347
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:37,364
That answer will come to their hotel
in Puerto Vallarta, right?

348
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:40,091
But if we're not there,
no answer can be delivered, right?

349
00:29:40,251 --> 00:29:43,402
Lizzie Borden won't get to wield her ax.
That's why I brought them up here.

350
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:46,847
Working every minute.
Now, all I need is a little time.

351
00:29:47,011 --> 00:29:50,003
To reestablish myself in the esteem...

352
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,605
...of those old...
The good ladies of our party.

353
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:56,446
By this time tomorrow, they'll
be eating out of the palm of my hand.

354
00:29:56,611 --> 00:30:00,923
Of that, you have the assurance
of the Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon.

355
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:03,801
What assurance you give
the kid you been leading on?

356
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,485
Leading on? Hank, if you are
to succeed in this business...

357
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:08,642
...you must give factual reports
without exaggeration.

358
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:10,403
That's a definite exaggeration.

359
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:13,722
I've exercised every ingenuity
of which a man is capable...

360
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:17,247
...to keep at bay the advances
of this precocious jezebel.

361
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:20,291
That's a hell of a way to talk about
an innocent young girl.

362
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:23,927
You sure weren't doing no avoiding when
you got her up in your pad last night.

363
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:25,524
Ha-ha, very funny.

364
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,603
Without no exaggeration, whatever
happens to Reverend ain't enough.

365
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:31,046
Avoiding her? She laid it
on the line down there...

366
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:32,963
...why you shanghaied us up here.
- Hank...

367
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,167
I heard your story.
But that ain't her story.

368
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,802
She said that she planned
to take the plane from Puerto Vallarta...

369
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:41,690
...and you couldn't stand for it
to see her go.

370
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:45,324
Fantastic. That's fantastic.

371
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:47,243
Mrs. Faulk, honey...

372
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:50,926
...give him a menu. Give him one of your
sample menus to show the ladies.

373
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:53,730
One of your fantastic sample menus.

374
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:56,086
There you are, thank you.
There you are, Hank.

375
00:30:56,251 --> 00:31:00,085
Now you go back down there and show
this fantastic sample menu to the ladies.

376
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:03,800
Describe the view from the hill,
the palatial appointments of the hotel...

377
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:05,324
...anything you like.

378
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:07,129
You get them up here, Hank.

379
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:12,925
A fine, upstanding young man.

380
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:16,720
So you appropriated the young chick
and the old hens are squawking, huh?

381
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:19,405
It's very serious. The child
is emotionally precocious.

382
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,171
- Bully for her.
- Also, she is traveling under the wing...

383
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:25,129
...of a military escort
of a butch vocal teacher.

384
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:29,561
I wonder how long it takes to sweat
the faculty of a Baptist Female College...

385
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:33,724
...out of a bus that's parked in the sun
when it's a 100 degrees in the shade.

386
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:36,121
- Well, they're staggering out of it now.
- They are?

387
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:39,363
I've won this round, I reckon.
Good old Hank.

388
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,045
Good old Hank better take cover.

389
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:51,405
Look at her, charging like
a bull elephant on a rampage.

390
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:53,721
Maxine, you gotta
help me with her, honey.

391
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:57,088
She's not only trying to get me fired,
she's also trying to pin on me...

392
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:59,321
...a rape charge,
a charge of statutory rape.

393
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:01,686
Statutory rape?
I've never known what that was.

394
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:06,208
That's when a man's seduced by a girl
under 20. That's not funny, Maxine.

395
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:09,650
Why do you always want
the young ones, honey?

396
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:12,279
I don't want any,
any, regardless of age.

397
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:14,806
Why do you take them, Shannon?
Huh, Shannon?

398
00:32:14,971 --> 00:32:18,600
- People need human contact, Maxine.
- Shannon!

399
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:19,965
Shannon! You're a fake.

400
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:22,725
Come on up, Miss Fellowes.
Everything's fixed.

401
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,170
Never do that, Miss Fellowes.

402
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:28,403
Not at high noon in a tropical country
in summer. Never charge uphill...

403
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,802
...like you're leading a troop of cavalry
attacking an impregnable position.

404
00:32:31,971 --> 00:32:35,008
I don't want advice or instructions.
I want that distributor head.

405
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:37,681
This is one of the charming ladies
of whom I was speaking.

406
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:39,284
Mrs. Faulk, Miss Fellowes.

407
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:41,885
- Hello.
- Is this man making a deal with you?

408
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:44,929
- What sort of deal?
- Is this man getting a kickback from you?

409
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,605
Look, honey,
nobody gets a kickback out of me.

410
00:32:47,891 --> 00:32:50,166
- I turn away more people...
- Have you got a telephone?

411
00:32:50,611 --> 00:32:52,886
- Sure.
- I wanna make a call to Texas.

412
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,607
- Collect, of course.
- Right in the office there.

413
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:01,367
When the hell did you get
a telephone in here?

414
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:04,489
Old Fred, he finally got the telephone
company to run a wire up here.

415
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:07,484
Well, you get in there,
and find out who she's talking to.

416
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:11,326
And don't let her get through to Blake's
Tours. She's trying to get me fired.

417
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,959
We're almost there, Peebie.
Just a little further.

418
00:33:14,131 --> 00:33:17,203
Miss Peebles, I am delighted.

419
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:19,482
I knew common sense would prevail.

420
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:22,290
You'll be enchanted with Mismaloya.
Look at this view.

421
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:24,965
We're not here out of choice,
we're here out of necessity.

422
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:27,326
- Miss Peebles is ill. She requires a...
- A bathroom.

423
00:33:27,491 --> 00:33:30,369
A bathroom, a bathroom.
Hank, get the luggage out of the bus.

424
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:32,647
Help yourselves, ladies.
Bungalows are all yours.

425
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,484
Here you are, Miss Peebles,
to comfort and privacy.

426
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:37,607
- Peebie,
- We couldn't help it, Judith, Peebie...

427
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:41,081
Just a temporary indisposition.
Mrs. Faulk is looking after her personally.

428
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:42,650
That's the service you get here.

429
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:46,929
Now you and Charlotte,
Miss Goodall, can share this one.

430
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,127
I want a room of my own.

431
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:52,442
That's perfectly all right with me.
She can have a room of her own.

432
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:56,445
I no longer assume any responsibility
for her actions. She's a free agent.

433
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:59,171
Until we get back to civilization.

434
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,245
Hank.

435
00:34:01,411 --> 00:34:03,686
Let me have Miss Fellowes' bag.

436
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:05,842
Thank you.

437
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:08,050
This way, Miss Fellowes.

438
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:10,361
Miss Fellowes, did you get
your call through?

439
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:12,249
Circuits were busy,
they'll call me back.

440
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:15,005
Miss Fellowes, please,
please give me a minute.

441
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:16,729
Well? Well, what is it?

442
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:18,722
Well, it's just that like...

443
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,121
Like everybody else
at some time or other in life...

444
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,009
...my life has cracked up on me.

445
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:25,207
How does that compensate us?

446
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:28,522
Miss Fellowes, I've just confessed
to you that I'm at the end of my rope.

447
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,489
Please, Miss Fellowes, don't make me
feel that any human being...

448
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:34,563
...would put personal compensation
before the ugly bare fact...

449
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:37,962
...of a man who's at the end of his rope,
but who still has to try to go on.

450
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:41,123
Now you listen to me. We girls
have worked and slaved all year...

451
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:44,727
...at Baptist Female College for this
Mexican tour, and the tour is a cheat.

452
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:46,040
Fantastic.

453
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,406
For days we've been holed
in that stifling bus...

454
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:50,209
...over the byways, off the highways.

455
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:52,885
Shook up and bumped up
so you could get your rake off.

456
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:54,962
All of the girls in this party
have dysentery.

457
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:58,043
That you cannot blame me for.
I passed out mimeographed instructions:

458
00:34:58,211 --> 00:35:00,930
What to eat, what not to eat,
what to drink, what not to drink.

459
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:03,480
It's not what, but where
we ate that gave us dysentery.

460
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:05,846
It's not dysentery, not
even amoebic. It's nothing...

461
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:07,444
It's Montezuma's revenge.

462
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:09,846
That's what we call it down here:
Aztec two-step.

463
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:14,960
Do you? Well, I intend to have
my revenge, Dr. Shannon.

464
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:19,321
Honey, I don't think even old Fred
could have calmed her down.

465
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:21,083
You go lie down.

466
00:35:53,331 --> 00:35:56,323
- Okay, Shannon.
- What you gonna do?

467
00:35:56,771 --> 00:35:59,046
Did you ever have a shave
by a lady barber?

468
00:35:59,211 --> 00:36:01,406
I can shave myself, Maxine.

469
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:05,005
With those shakes?
How long you had them, Shannon?

470
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:09,244
They've been incubating ever since
the trip started. It's been a nightmare.

471
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:13,484
Culminating with the Witch of Endor
threatening to hound me to the grave.

472
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,926
That's when blind panic took over.

473
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,809
That's when the spook moved in.

474
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:20,644
Is that all your spook is, honey?
Just panic?

475
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:24,929
Maxine, don't say "just panic"
like you'd say "just leprosy."

476
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:26,843
Panic's serious.

477
00:36:27,011 --> 00:36:29,923
Who'd Madame Lafarge
put that phone call to?

478
00:36:30,091 --> 00:36:32,127
- Some judge in Corpus Christi.
- I knew it.

479
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,202
- Where you going?
- To tear that phone out...

480
00:36:34,371 --> 00:36:36,168
In a pig's eye!

481
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:39,368
That phone cost me 1200 pesos
to get in here.

482
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,204
You just lie back, baby,
and when I get you all prettied up...

483
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:44,441
...I'll go and cancel that call.

484
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:52,362
I see you got your gold cross on.

485
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:54,283
Thinking about going back to the church?

486
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:58,524
I wrote my old bishop last night,
a letter of complete capitulation.

487
00:36:58,691 --> 00:37:00,602
How come you don't quit
kidding yourself?

488
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:03,683
You ain't thinking about going back
to no church...

489
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:07,201
...or you wouldn't be so scared of losing
this cotton-picking job of yours.

490
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:11,526
You know, folks don't go to church to
hear atheistical sermons being preached.

491
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:15,047
Damn it to hell. I never preached
an atheist sermon in church in all my life.

492
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:17,679
All right, baby, all right.

493
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:20,601
What size shoe you wear, baby?

494
00:37:21,411 --> 00:37:23,242
I do not get the point of that question.

495
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:25,527
Well, these shoes look shot to me.

496
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:28,080
If I remember correctly
you only travel with one pair.

497
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:31,049
Now, old Fred's estate includes
one good pair of shoes.

498
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:32,969
And your feet look about the same size.

499
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:36,282
I loved old Fred, Maxine,
but I do not want to fill his shoes.

500
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:39,040
You could do worse, baby.

501
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:41,242
You could do worse.

502
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:53,844
Which way is the sea?

503
00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:57,686
It's right down there, but we can't see it
because of the trees.

504
00:37:57,851 --> 00:38:00,206
I can feel it and smell it.

505
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:02,521
It's the cradle of life.

506
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:38,050
Are these two with your party?

507
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:40,762
They look like a couple of loonies.

508
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:44,365
Life began in the sea.

509
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:47,604
Oh! Oh, how do you do?

510
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:49,724
Hello.

511
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:53,765
Have you ever tried
helping a gentleman...

512
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,729
...who can't walk,
uphill through a rain forest?

513
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,970
No. I wouldn't even try it downhill.

514
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:01,924
Anything I can do for you folks?

515
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:04,924
Well, now that we've made it,
I don't regret the effort.

516
00:39:05,091 --> 00:39:07,161
What a view for a painter!

517
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:11,006
They told me in the town
this was the ideal place for a painter.

518
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:13,241
And they weren't exaggerating.

519
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,282
Anything I can do for you?

520
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:19,409
Yes, yes, I'm looking for
the manager of the hotel.

521
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:21,289
Oh, that's me. Speaking.

522
00:39:21,451 --> 00:39:25,285
You're the manager. Oh, good.
I'm Hannah Jelkes. How do you do?

523
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:27,885
- Mrs...?
- Faulk. Maxine Faulk.

524
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:29,484
You're looking for rooms?

525
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:32,165
Yes, yes, we are, but we've come
without reservations.

526
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:35,528
Well, honey, we're closed in August,
except for a few special guests.

527
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:38,251
Well, look at them.
If they're not special, who the hell is?

528
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:40,879
Honey, that old man ought to be
in a hospital.

529
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:44,123
No. Oh, no, no, he just sprained
his ankle a little this morning.

530
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:49,445
Come on, Grandpa. Two steps,
one, two. There you are.

531
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:53,570
Hannah, tell the lady
that my frailty is temporary.

532
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:56,450
I will soon be able to crawl
and then to toddle.

533
00:39:56,611 --> 00:40:00,047
And before long I'll be leaping
around here like an old mountain goat.

534
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:02,679
Yes, yes, Grandfather, I explained that.

535
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:04,807
Tell the lady that I know
some hotels...

536
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:07,963
...don't want to take dogs,
cats or monkeys.

537
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:12,727
And some don't even solicit
the patronage of infants in their late 90s.

538
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:14,244
But assure her...

539
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:18,040
...that if she'll forgive my
disgraceful longevity...

540
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:21,089
...and this temporary decrepitude...

541
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:25,688
...I will present her with the last signed
copy of my first volume of verse.

542
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:28,570
Published in... When, Hannah?

543
00:40:28,731 --> 00:40:32,326
The day that President William McKinley
was assassinated, Nonno.

544
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:35,324
My grandfather is the poet
Jonathan Coffin.

545
00:40:35,491 --> 00:40:37,402
He is 97 years young.

546
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:39,448
And he will be 98 years young...

547
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:42,967
...on the 5th of October.
- Old folks are remarkable.

548
00:40:43,131 --> 00:40:44,849
Hey, the phone!
Did you cancel that call?

549
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:46,842
When the hell did I have time?

550
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,922
Did I talk too much?

551
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:50,922
Have I been talking too much again?

552
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:53,203
I'm afraid that he has.

553
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:55,009
I don't think she's going to take us.

554
00:40:55,171 --> 00:40:58,163
Her eyes said "no"
in big blue capital letters.

555
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,243
Oh, I shouldn't worry about that.
She'll take you in, all right.

556
00:41:02,851 --> 00:41:04,807
The Judge Truman Fellowes
on the telephone.

557
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:07,246
Must be old butch's brother.
Wouldn't have a husband.

558
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:09,606
Anyway, I said she'd checked out,
canceled the call.

559
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:12,285
Maxine, you're larger than life.

560
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:15,931
Shall we register now?

561
00:41:16,531 --> 00:41:18,203
You can register
any time you want.

562
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:20,601
But I gotta collect 6 dollars
from you right now...

563
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:22,363
...if you want your name in the pot.

564
00:41:22,651 --> 00:41:24,004
Six dollars.

565
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:27,486
Three dollars each.
You see, out of season like this...

566
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,801
...we operate on the modified
American plan.

567
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:32,883
Oh, I see. Yes, well...

568
00:41:33,051 --> 00:41:35,963
...we usually operate on a
special basis ourselves.

569
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:37,890
What do you mean, operate?

570
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:40,926
Here is our card.

571
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:42,769
I think you may have heard of us.

572
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:44,444
We've had quite a few write-ups.

573
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:47,843
My grandfather is the oldest living
and practicing poet.

574
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:50,161
And he gives recitations.

575
00:41:50,331 --> 00:41:53,767
I paint watercolors
and I'm a quick sketch artist.

576
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:56,764
We travel together
and we pay our way as we go...

577
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,523
...by my grandfather's recitations...

578
00:41:58,691 --> 00:42:02,684
...and by the sale of quick character
sketches in charcoal and pastel.

579
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:07,327
I usually pass among the tables
during lunch and dinner, slowly.

580
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,641
I wear an artist's smock...

581
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:12,086
...picturesquely dabbed with paint.

582
00:42:12,251 --> 00:42:15,721
I don't push myself on people.
I just display my work.

583
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:19,008
And I smile sweetly at them,
and if invited to do so...

584
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:21,639
...I sit down and make
a quick character sketch.

585
00:42:21,811 --> 00:42:23,324
And Gramps?

586
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:27,008
I introduce him as the world's oldest
living and practicing poet.

587
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:30,209
If invited, he gives a recitation
of one of his poems.

588
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:33,723
Of course, they were all written
a very long time ago...

589
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:36,007
...but do you know
he has started a new poem?

590
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:39,960
For the first time in 20 years
he has started another poem.

591
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:41,450
Hasn't finished it yet.

592
00:42:41,611 --> 00:42:46,685
He still has his inspiration but his power
of concentration has weakened a little.

593
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:50,445
Right now, Gramps
ain't concentrating at all.

594
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:52,647
He's just catching forty winks.

595
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:54,804
Gramps.

596
00:42:55,051 --> 00:42:56,643
Gramps.

597
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:58,529
Time to hit the sack, Gramps.

598
00:42:58,691 --> 00:43:01,205
- Now, you just wait a minute.
- Please.

599
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,124
We've tried every hotel
in Puerto Vallarta.

600
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,122
They wouldn't take us.

601
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:09,408
I'm afraid I have to place myself
at your mercy.

602
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:13,089
Okay. Looks like you're in
for one night, but just one.

603
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:15,446
- Thank you.
- Where's your luggage?

604
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:18,290
- No luggage?
- I hid it behind some palmettos...

605
00:43:18,451 --> 00:43:21,363
...at the foot of the path
with Grandfather's wheelchair.

606
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:22,725
Pepe.

607
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:28,926
They're chasing an iguana.

608
00:43:31,771 --> 00:43:33,523
What will they do with it?

609
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:36,763
Tie him up, fatten him up
and eat him up.

610
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:48,964
Pepe.

611
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:57,451
Okay, honey. You and Gramps
can have bungalow nine.

612
00:43:57,611 --> 00:44:00,000
How's Gramps gonna get meals?
Let them have that suite.

613
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:02,207
Wait a minute, Shannon,
that's the deluxe suite.

614
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:05,727
I know, Maxine, generosity
is the cornerstone of your nature.

615
00:44:05,891 --> 00:44:07,802
Come on, Gramps.
Time to move.

616
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:09,199
That's it.

617
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:11,680
Did someone call for a recitation?

618
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:15,002
No, Nonno,
we're just going to our rooms.

619
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:19,479
I'm dreadfully afraid
my grandfather had a slight stroke...

620
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:21,528
...in those high passes
through the Sierras.

621
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:25,320
Old people get them. They're not regular
strokes, just little cerebral incidents.

622
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:29,245
Symptoms clear up quickly, sometimes
old people don't realize they had them.

623
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:39,602
Just rest for a few moments, Nonno.

624
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:48,761
<i>How calmly does the olive branch</i>

625
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:52,446
<i>Observe the sky begin to blanch</i>

626
00:44:52,811 --> 00:44:56,247
<i>Without a cry, without a prayer</i>

627
00:44:56,531 --> 00:44:59,967
<i>With no betrayal of despair</i>

628
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:07,563
I'll leave Nonno in here
and I'll take that room.

629
00:45:07,731 --> 00:45:10,768
That's the one with the leaky roof,
but you won't find out about it...

630
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:14,480
...until it rains, and then it'll be too late
to do anything except swim out if it.

631
00:45:14,651 --> 00:45:17,723
- Oh, no, Mr...?
- Shannon, the Reverend T. Lawrence.

632
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:21,201
Mr. Shannon,
I'll find a dry spot if it rains.

633
00:45:21,371 --> 00:45:22,770
How many...?

634
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:24,842
How many times have you
been around the world?

635
00:45:25,011 --> 00:45:27,241
As many times as the world
has been around the sun.

636
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:30,562
And I feel as if I've gone
the whole way on foot.

637
00:45:30,851 --> 00:45:32,648
Thank you, Mr. Shannon.

638
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:07,043
Operator.

639
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:10,331
Operator, <i>aquí parlar</i> English<i>?</i>

640
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:14,040
<i>- Sí, señora. Can I help you?</i>
- This is Miss Fellowes at Mismaloya.

641
00:46:14,211 --> 00:46:16,566
<i>- Sí, señora.</i>
- What happened to my call to Texas?

642
00:46:16,731 --> 00:46:18,687
<i>- Where in Texas?</i>
- Corpus Christi.

643
00:46:18,851 --> 00:46:20,967
<i>- I thought you'd checked out.</i>
- Checked out?

644
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:23,929
How could I check out?
He's got the distributor...

645
00:46:25,091 --> 00:46:28,288
Operator, you put that
call through again...

646
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:32,603
...and I will hold the line
and wait if it takes all afternoon.

647
00:46:32,771 --> 00:46:34,204
<i>Very well, señora.</i>

648
00:46:40,451 --> 00:46:42,407
Seducer.

649
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:45,650
- What?
- Seducer.

650
00:46:47,131 --> 00:46:49,929
- Now, what's the squawk now?
- Oh, Larry, why didn't you tell me?

651
00:46:50,091 --> 00:46:51,365
Tell you what? What is this?

652
00:46:51,531 --> 00:46:54,762
- You've been exposed, Shannon.
- Your whole shameful past.

653
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:57,206
Posing as a minister of the gospel.

654
00:46:57,371 --> 00:46:59,327
I am a minister.
Anybody who says I'm not...

655
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:01,800
Honey, show them that gold cross,
that'll prove it.

656
00:47:01,971 --> 00:47:05,964
You thought you outwitted me, having
your paramour here cancel my call.

657
00:47:06,131 --> 00:47:09,328
Miss Fellowes, honey,
if paramour means what I think it does...

658
00:47:09,491 --> 00:47:11,846
...you're gambling with your front teeth.

659
00:47:12,011 --> 00:47:15,128
My brother has been in communication
with Blake's Tours.

660
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:18,044
They've assured him
that they will take action, drastic action.

661
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:20,247
Just what do you mean by that?

662
00:47:20,411 --> 00:47:23,130
- I have a contract that provides...
- Your contract is worthless.

663
00:47:23,331 --> 00:47:25,083
My brother is a judge.

664
00:47:25,251 --> 00:47:28,687
And he has informed your employer
that they are not required to employ...

665
00:47:28,851 --> 00:47:31,729
...a man who makes a career
of seducing young girls.

666
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:34,883
"Seducing!"
Did you lead her to infer that...

667
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:37,042
Larry, how could you think that l...?

668
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:41,250
I said a career. All the way
from Pleasant Valley, Virginia...

669
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:44,323
...to that dreadful hotel
that you tricked us into last night.

670
00:47:44,491 --> 00:47:45,890
But that career is now ended.

671
00:47:46,171 --> 00:47:49,163
The Reverend Shannon, defrocked.

672
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:51,606
That's a lie. A base lie.

673
00:47:51,811 --> 00:47:55,201
I was never defrocked.
I was only locked out of my church.

674
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:57,249
Spreading a story like that is libel.

675
00:47:57,411 --> 00:48:01,086
I could take legal action. And I will.
These ladies are my witnesses.

676
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:03,560
Repeating a story like that will get you...

677
00:48:04,851 --> 00:48:07,763
I'll show you. I'll show you all.

678
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:10,320
You can't say that I was defrocked.

679
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:13,404
I'll show you. I'll show you.

680
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:19,963
Well, if you're not gonna eat him,
I guess I'd better see about some food.

681
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:28,849
What's this mess supposed to be?

682
00:48:29,011 --> 00:48:30,285
Soup.

683
00:48:30,451 --> 00:48:32,169
Well, it's burnt!

684
00:48:38,691 --> 00:48:40,170
Chang...

685
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:41,645
...I've warned you before.

686
00:48:41,811 --> 00:48:44,609
I don't allow this stuff on premises,
even if you're on vacation.

687
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:47,001
You remember the time you got it
in the enchiladas?

688
00:48:47,851 --> 00:48:49,728
What are you
gonna do with them dogfish?

689
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:52,451
Me do nothing. Me on vacation.

690
00:48:52,611 --> 00:48:56,889
Pedro can fry with plenty chili,
make hot.

691
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:07,041
- Why not steam it, Mrs. Faulk?
- No guests allowed in the kitchen.

692
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:08,610
Mayn't I help?

693
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:10,285
Please let me.

694
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:13,284
I was born and bred in the fishing port
of Nantucket.

695
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,249
And I've cooked every kind of fish
that swims in the sea.

696
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,686
Except whales, but they're mammals.

697
00:49:19,411 --> 00:49:21,242
I know what you're up to, honey.

698
00:49:21,411 --> 00:49:24,767
You wanna make yourself useful so I'll
let you and old Gramps stay here free.

699
00:49:24,931 --> 00:49:26,887
I wouldn't do anything so obvious.

700
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:29,087
Not with a woman of your practicality.

701
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:31,560
No, my wanting to help in the kitchen...

702
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:33,767
May I have the knife, please?

703
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:35,643
Machete.

704
00:49:36,211 --> 00:49:38,679
It's just that I've noticed a certain...

705
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:42,161
...animosity towards
Mr. Shannon among the...

706
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:45,164
...ladies in his party,
particularly in the case of...

707
00:49:46,971 --> 00:49:50,646
...Miss Fellowes, and I think with
a soothing meal inside her...

708
00:49:50,811 --> 00:49:52,290
...it might soothe her spirit.

709
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,289
Miss Jelkes, honey, you're a hustler.

710
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,363
A fantastic, cool hustler.

711
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:01,690
You're completely broke, huh?

712
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:04,321
Yes, we are, completely.

713
00:50:04,611 --> 00:50:06,761
You say that like you're proud of it.

714
00:50:06,931 --> 00:50:09,081
I'm not proud of it,
or ashamed of it either.

715
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:11,526
It just happens to be
what's happened to us.

716
00:50:15,571 --> 00:50:16,924
You know what that means?

717
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:18,683
No, I don't think I do.

718
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:20,762
It's Chinese for "No sweat."

719
00:50:20,931 --> 00:50:22,967
Our Chinese cook says it.

720
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:25,322
Old Fred used to say...

721
00:50:25,491 --> 00:50:28,927
...that those three words
summed up all the wisdom of the East.

722
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:32,001
- Fred?
- My husband.

723
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:33,600
My late husband.

724
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:37,726
How lately did you lose him, Mrs. Faulk?

725
00:50:37,891 --> 00:50:40,246
Three, almost four weeks ago.

726
00:50:40,411 --> 00:50:43,084
Maybe it hasn't dawned on me yet,
old Fred being gone for good.

727
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:46,049
It seems like he's out fishing.
He was always out fishing anyhow.

728
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:49,567
He hardly ever opened his mouth, except
when he got drunk and sang songs.

729
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:52,928
He'd lie out in that hammock
and drink and sing all night long.

730
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,524
No guest ever complained either.

731
00:50:54,691 --> 00:50:57,205
Or I'd have shown them
the straight way down the hill.

732
00:50:57,451 --> 00:50:59,282
I'm sure you would.

733
00:51:00,571 --> 00:51:02,527
I loved old Fred.

734
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:06,161
More than anybody would guess, the
way I carried on. Except Fred, he knew.

735
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:08,970
You see, he was 28 years older than me.

736
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:11,964
And we hadn't slept together in
I don't know when.

737
00:51:12,131 --> 00:51:14,599
Fred used to say
he guessed he was impotent.

738
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:17,604
But if you ask me, honey,
he just plain lost interest.

739
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:22,724
What other interest did he have,
Mrs. Faulk?

740
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:24,285
Only fishing.

741
00:51:24,451 --> 00:51:26,567
He'd catch them, throw them back in.

742
00:51:26,731 --> 00:51:29,370
Unless they swallowed the hook,
we'd have them for supper.

743
00:51:29,531 --> 00:51:31,328
Fred lived and let live.

744
00:51:34,051 --> 00:51:36,440
When I hired them beach boys...

745
00:51:37,091 --> 00:51:38,080
...Fred care?

746
00:51:38,251 --> 00:51:41,846
Did he raise hell when I started going
night swimming with them? Hell, no.

747
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:44,400
He just went night fishing all night long.

748
00:51:45,091 --> 00:51:47,161
He must have been a remarkable man.

749
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:49,526
You said it.
People with troubles...

750
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:52,330
...and that's everybody,
used to come and spill them to old Fred.

751
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:55,449
And he could listen forever.
He was better than any head shrinker...

752
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:58,569
...because he knew what was
bugging you even before you told him.

753
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:01,529
That's why Shannon always made for
Mismaloya when he was spooked.

754
00:52:02,171 --> 00:52:06,050
I remember one time, he came
down here out of season like now.

755
00:52:06,211 --> 00:52:07,564
And I went on the make for him.

756
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:11,849
But Shannon wasn't having any,
on account of his friendship with Fred.

757
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:13,603
Well, they're all ready for steaming.

758
00:52:13,971 --> 00:52:17,247
So was I, Miss Jelkes, honey, so was I.

759
00:52:17,411 --> 00:52:20,687
But I couldn't tell him
that Fred didn't give a damn.

760
00:52:20,891 --> 00:52:22,882
It didn't seem fair to Fred.

761
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:28,042
You know I think you're quite a
remarkable person too, Mrs. Faulk.

762
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,883
Don't you try to con me, honey.

763
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:31,325
I understand me.

764
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:34,528
I still got my biological urges.

765
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,125
The beach boys?

766
00:52:36,931 --> 00:52:38,250
Yup.

767
00:52:39,011 --> 00:52:43,243
But even I know the difference
between loving somebody...

768
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:46,682
...and just going to bed with them.
Even I know that.

769
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:04,233
<i>Nelly was a lady</i>

770
00:53:04,397 --> 00:53:07,628
<i>Last night she died</i>

771
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:11,312
<i>Toll the bell</i>
<i>For lovely Nell</i>

772
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:13,866
<i>My dark Virginny bride</i>

773
00:53:14,597 --> 00:53:17,270
Don't you step in this room.
Don't step over that threshold.

774
00:53:17,437 --> 00:53:20,509
Don't complicate my life. I've got
a fever. Don't complicate my fever.

775
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:22,747
Larry, watch out.
You're walking on broken glass.

776
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:24,111
- Never mind.
- Stand still.

777
00:53:24,277 --> 00:53:26,837
You're cutting your feet,
leaving blood stains on the floor.

778
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:29,386
- Who saw you come in here?
- Nobody but an iguana.

779
00:53:29,557 --> 00:53:32,117
- Your guardian angel will be in full cry.
- Let her howl.

780
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:36,316
I hate her and I hate that little snitch
of a bitch that ruined you in Virginia.

781
00:53:36,477 --> 00:53:39,196
You're ruining me in Mexico.
Get off your knees, it's indecent.

782
00:53:39,357 --> 00:53:42,554
Sit down over there. I want to explain
something to you. Look and listen.

783
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:45,715
A man has got just so much
in his emotional bank balance.

784
00:53:45,877 --> 00:53:47,868
But mine has run out.
It's stone dry.

785
00:53:48,037 --> 00:53:51,871
I can't draw a check on it now.
There's nothing left to draw out.

786
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:54,915
Oh, Lord, you've got blood stains on it.

787
00:53:55,077 --> 00:53:57,227
I'm sorry to tell you
that you're as dangerous...

788
00:53:57,397 --> 00:53:59,388
...as you are young and lovely.

789
00:53:59,557 --> 00:54:03,709
And it's your being young and lovely
that makes you so dangerous.

790
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:09,907
And that gives you this destructive
potential over a destructible man.

791
00:54:10,077 --> 00:54:11,396
We're not going back.

792
00:54:11,837 --> 00:54:13,190
We'll stay here together.

793
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:17,191
Live here, be beachcombers like
Fletcher Christian and that native girl.

794
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:21,635
Living in the sun.
You're going to marry me, Larry.

795
00:54:22,397 --> 00:54:23,830
Oh, Lord, no, no.

796
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:27,706
And nothing could be worse
for a girl in your unstable condition...

797
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:31,756
...to be mixed up with a man
in my unstable condition.

798
00:54:31,917 --> 00:54:34,795
Because two people
in unstable conditions...

799
00:54:34,957 --> 00:54:39,075
...are like two countries
facing each other in unstable conditions.

800
00:54:39,237 --> 00:54:44,755
The destructive potential could blow
the whole world to bits...

801
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:46,270
...past all repair.

802
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:48,189
You're walking barefoot on glass.

803
00:54:48,357 --> 00:54:50,917
I would walk on brimstone through hell...

804
00:54:51,077 --> 00:54:53,796
...to get you out of my room.
Now will you get out of my room.

805
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,027
I don't believe you don't love me.

806
00:54:56,197 --> 00:54:57,949
I love...
I love nobody.

807
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:01,507
I know it's practically impossible for
anybody to realize they're not loved...

808
00:55:01,677 --> 00:55:04,350
...when in love with somebody
they think they're in love with.

809
00:55:04,517 --> 00:55:06,985
You couldn't walk barefoot on glass
if you didn't love me.

810
00:55:07,157 --> 00:55:12,470
I'm walking barefoot on glass
because you won't leave me alone.

811
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:16,352
All right, I'll do it too. I'll walk on glass
and I'll bleed to death with you.

812
00:55:16,637 --> 00:55:20,027
No, you won't do this. You will get
out of my room and out of my life.

813
00:55:20,197 --> 00:55:21,346
No, put me down. No!

814
00:55:22,477 --> 00:55:24,195
You will not come near me again,
understand?

815
00:55:24,357 --> 00:55:26,268
Put me down. I hate you!

816
00:55:26,437 --> 00:55:27,790
You've ruined my life.

817
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:31,188
You've killed me, killed me!

818
00:55:31,357 --> 00:55:34,110
Put me down!

819
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:44,076
What is this, Mr. Shannon?

820
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:46,228
Hell and damnation.

821
00:55:46,397 --> 00:55:47,671
Your feet are bleeding.

822
00:55:47,837 --> 00:55:49,668
There's glass all over the floor
in my room.

823
00:55:49,837 --> 00:55:53,830
Sit down. I have antiseptics
and surgical gauze in my room.

824
00:56:03,677 --> 00:56:07,226
Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.

825
00:56:07,717 --> 00:56:11,073
That word "fantastic" seems to be
your favorite word, Mr. Shannon.

826
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:12,556
Miss Jelkes...

827
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:14,309
...we live on two levels.

828
00:56:14,477 --> 00:56:15,671
Just two?

829
00:56:15,837 --> 00:56:20,706
The fantastic level and the realistic level
are the two levels upon which we live.

830
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,833
But which is the real one really?

831
00:56:22,997 --> 00:56:24,828
I would say both, Mr. Shannon.

832
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:28,069
But when you live
on the fantastic level...

833
00:56:28,237 --> 00:56:32,515
...as I have more and more lately, but
have to operate on the realistic level...

834
00:56:32,677 --> 00:56:34,474
...that's when you get spooked.

835
00:56:34,717 --> 00:56:37,277
And I am spooked, Miss Jelkes.

836
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:40,156
<i>A chronicle no longer gold</i>

837
00:56:40,637 --> 00:56:43,151
<i>A bargaining with mist of gold</i>

838
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,545
There.

839
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:47,470
Now I'll go and clear up
the broken glass in your room.

840
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:50,595
Don't bother about that. If you'd be
kind enough to bring my shoes...

841
00:56:50,757 --> 00:56:53,635
...and could you let me have
my clerical collar? It's on the floor.

842
00:56:57,437 --> 00:57:01,066
Are you planning to conduct a church
service here tonight, Mr. Shannon?

843
00:57:01,237 --> 00:57:04,195
No, I just plan to do...

844
00:57:04,357 --> 00:57:05,631
...nothing.

845
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,914
Oh, and bring me that distributor head,
if you would.

846
00:57:11,597 --> 00:57:12,916
This?

847
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:15,196
That's it.

848
00:57:18,197 --> 00:57:22,110
If you're not going to conduct a service,
why get into this uncomfortable outfit?

849
00:57:22,277 --> 00:57:26,589
Because I've been accused of being
defrocked and lying about it, that's why.

850
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:32,468
I will demonstrate to these ladies that
I'm still a frocked minister of the gospel.

851
00:57:32,637 --> 00:57:34,628
I'm afraid it's no use, Mr. Shannon.

852
00:57:34,797 --> 00:57:37,755
The neckband's so frayed,
it won't hold the collar button.

853
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:39,635
- Oh, damn.
- Hannah!

854
00:57:39,797 --> 00:57:41,708
Oh, God, he's fallen.

855
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:46,589
Hey, Grandpa.

856
00:57:47,557 --> 00:57:49,832
There you are.

857
00:57:56,597 --> 00:57:58,553
I wish my pulse were as steady as his.

858
00:57:58,717 --> 00:58:01,151
Did you feel dizzy, Grandfather?

859
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:03,393
No, no.

860
00:58:03,757 --> 00:58:06,829
I was working on my new poem and...

861
00:58:07,797 --> 00:58:09,753
Where's my cane?

862
00:58:14,517 --> 00:58:16,473
There you are, Grandpa.

863
00:58:16,837 --> 00:58:22,036
I was beating time with my cane
and my cane slipped.

864
00:58:22,437 --> 00:58:23,870
You'd better rest a while.

865
00:58:24,037 --> 00:58:25,470
Yes.

866
00:58:25,637 --> 00:58:27,434
Rest a while.

867
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:30,391
He'll be all right now,
we can talk outside.

868
00:58:31,317 --> 00:58:33,194
Why are you breathing like that?

869
00:58:34,237 --> 00:58:35,716
Some people take a drink...

870
00:58:37,357 --> 00:58:39,632
...others take a pill.

871
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:43,954
I just take a few deep breaths.

872
00:58:44,117 --> 00:58:45,436
Well...

873
00:58:45,597 --> 00:58:47,827
...don't be frightened about it.

874
00:58:49,757 --> 00:58:52,908
He was amazing, just amazing...

875
00:58:53,077 --> 00:58:58,595
...until he started having these little,
whatever they are, these spells.

876
00:58:59,237 --> 00:59:00,386
When they started, I...

877
00:59:00,557 --> 00:59:05,426
...tried to persuade him to go back to
Nantucket but he said, "No. Mexico."

878
00:59:05,597 --> 00:59:08,509
So Mexico it is.

879
00:59:08,677 --> 00:59:11,749
And he wouldn't rest anywhere,
until he got to the sea.

880
00:59:11,917 --> 00:59:14,954
"The cradle of life," as he calls it.

881
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:18,310
So here we are, Mr. Shannon.

882
00:59:18,477 --> 00:59:21,992
Like a couple of scarecrows
on this windy hilltop...

883
00:59:22,157 --> 00:59:24,113
...over the cradle of life.

884
00:59:24,277 --> 00:59:27,747
<i>The plummeting to earth and then...</i>

885
00:59:27,917 --> 00:59:29,555
Hannah? Hannah?

886
00:59:29,717 --> 00:59:33,505
- Yes, Grandfather?
- I'm pretty sure I'm gonna finish it here.

887
00:59:33,677 --> 00:59:35,952
I have the same feeling myself,
Grandpa.

888
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:38,790
I've never been surer of anything
in my life.

889
00:59:38,957 --> 00:59:41,710
I've never been surer of anything
in mine, either.

890
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:45,756
Of course, you'll finish the poem.
Why, it's nearly finished already.

891
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:49,466
I'll be outside if you want me
to write something down.

892
00:59:52,757 --> 00:59:55,271
He'll probably sleep a while now.

893
00:59:57,797 --> 01:00:01,995
Miss Jelkes, may l...?
May I have one of your cigarettes?

894
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:04,988
You must never smoke those.

895
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:08,467
They're made out of cigarette ends
taken out of the gutters.

896
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:10,434
Have one of mine.

897
01:00:10,597 --> 01:00:15,387
English, imported, in an airtight tin.
It's my one luxury in life.

898
01:00:15,557 --> 01:00:19,027
Yes, thank you, I will,
since you've thrown mine away.

899
01:00:19,197 --> 01:00:20,346
Well...

900
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:24,032
...I'm going to tell you something
about yourself, Miss Jelkes.

901
01:00:24,197 --> 01:00:29,032
You are a lady,
a real one and a great one.

902
01:00:29,637 --> 01:00:32,515
What have I done to merit
that compliment from you?

903
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:35,749
Well, you took out your cigarettes,
found out you only had two left.

904
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:38,636
You can't afford to buy another pack
of even that cheap brand...

905
01:00:38,797 --> 01:00:41,470
...and so you put them away for later,
right?

906
01:00:41,757 --> 01:00:44,430
Mercilessly accurate, Mr. Shannon.

907
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:48,875
But when I asked you for one, you gave
me it without any sign of reluctance.

908
01:00:49,757 --> 01:00:52,794
I think you're making a big point
out of a small matter.

909
01:00:53,037 --> 01:00:54,595
Oh, no, no.

910
01:00:54,757 --> 01:00:59,273
I'm making a small point
out of a very, very large matter.

911
01:01:01,797 --> 01:01:06,268
How long have you been inactive
in the church, Mr. Shannon?

912
01:01:07,317 --> 01:01:10,468
What's that got to do
with the price of rice in China?

913
01:01:10,637 --> 01:01:12,309
- Nothing.
- And what's it got to do...

914
01:01:12,477 --> 01:01:14,911
...with the price of coffee in Brazil?

915
01:01:15,637 --> 01:01:18,276
I retract the question, with apologies.

916
01:01:18,437 --> 01:01:21,634
Very well, then,
I'll be glad to answer it. I...

917
01:01:21,797 --> 01:01:25,107
I have been inactive
in the church for all but one year...

918
01:01:25,277 --> 01:01:28,952
...since I was ordained
a minister of the church.

919
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:31,472
That's quite a sabbatical, Mr. Shannon.

920
01:01:31,637 --> 01:01:35,391
Yes, I had one parish for one year
and then...

921
01:01:35,877 --> 01:01:37,674
...I was not defrocked...

922
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:40,305
...I was locked out of the church.

923
01:01:45,397 --> 01:01:47,991
Are you...? You drawing me?

924
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,714
I'm trying to.

925
01:01:51,877 --> 01:01:53,913
Why did they lock you out?

926
01:01:54,717 --> 01:01:58,790
For fornication and conduct
unbecoming a man of the cloth.

927
01:01:59,557 --> 01:02:04,267
What were the circumstances
of the first offense?

928
01:02:04,437 --> 01:02:06,029
Fornication?

929
01:02:06,877 --> 01:02:11,792
A young Sunday school teacher asked
to see me, privately in my study and...

930
01:02:11,957 --> 01:02:13,310
...well, she...

931
01:02:13,477 --> 01:02:16,514
She declared herself
to me, wildly.

932
01:02:16,837 --> 01:02:19,192
A declaration of love?

933
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:22,475
Don't make fun of me, Miss Jelkes.

934
01:02:23,637 --> 01:02:25,229
I wasn't.

935
01:02:27,517 --> 01:02:30,111
I was the damnedest prig
in those days that you can imagine.

936
01:02:30,277 --> 01:02:33,633
I said to this girl, I said,
"Let us kneel down and pray together."

937
01:02:33,797 --> 01:02:35,150
And we did, we knelt.

938
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:37,353
And then all of sudden, the...

939
01:02:37,637 --> 01:02:41,471
...kneeling position turned
into a reclining position.

940
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:46,876
The next day, she cut herself with
her father's straight blade razor.

941
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:49,786
- Fatally?
- No, no, no.

942
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:51,913
Thanks to a Band-Aid.

943
01:02:52,237 --> 01:02:55,035
But it made a scandal.

944
01:02:55,197 --> 01:02:57,757
Yes, I imagine that it
caused some comment.

945
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:00,909
Yes, it did, it did that.
The next Sunday when I saw those...

946
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:04,831
...smug, accusing,
disapproving faces uplifted...

947
01:03:04,997 --> 01:03:08,353
...I had a sudden urge to shock.

948
01:03:08,517 --> 01:03:10,109
And I shocked them.

949
01:03:10,397 --> 01:03:12,672
I chased them out of the church.

950
01:03:13,597 --> 01:03:15,747
And what was the upshot of it?

951
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:19,751
They put me in a nice little private
asylum to recover from...

952
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:22,590
...a complete nervous breakdown.
That's the way they put it.

953
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,827
And then when I got out I...

954
01:03:24,997 --> 01:03:26,635
I entered this line.

955
01:03:26,797 --> 01:03:30,426
"Tours of God's world,
conducted by a minister of God."

956
01:03:30,597 --> 01:03:32,827
To quote the pamphlet.

957
01:03:33,317 --> 01:03:35,069
But on the side...

958
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,507
...Shannon has been collecting evidence.

959
01:03:37,677 --> 01:03:41,465
- Evidence of what?
- Man's inhumanity to God.

960
01:03:43,397 --> 01:03:46,867
- What do you mean by that?
- The pain we cause him.

961
01:03:47,397 --> 01:03:50,195
We've poisoned his atmosphere.

962
01:03:50,357 --> 01:03:52,587
We've slaughtered
his creatures of the wild.

963
01:03:52,757 --> 01:03:54,952
We've polluted his rivers.

964
01:03:55,437 --> 01:03:59,749
We've even taken
God's noblest creation, man...

965
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:02,909
...and brainwashed him into becoming
our own product, not God's.

966
01:04:03,077 --> 01:04:06,149
Hacked, stacked and canned.

967
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:13,468
Am I...?
Am I moving too much?

968
01:04:14,837 --> 01:04:16,395
No, of course not.

969
01:04:20,597 --> 01:04:22,428
Mr. Shannon?

970
01:04:22,717 --> 01:04:24,355
What do you do if...?

971
01:04:24,517 --> 01:04:26,747
If what?

972
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:28,828
If Miss Fellowes has her way?

973
01:04:28,997 --> 01:04:31,591
And gets me fired?

974
01:04:32,037 --> 01:04:33,993
Yes, what do you do then?

975
01:04:35,757 --> 01:04:39,227
Well, I either go back
to the church, or I...

976
01:04:39,597 --> 01:04:40,996
I take the long swim.

977
01:04:41,157 --> 01:04:43,910
- It's right out there.
- What is?

978
01:04:45,117 --> 01:04:46,391
China.

979
01:04:57,317 --> 01:05:00,434
- Was that the luncheon gong?
- Chow will be ready in a half-hour.

980
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:02,872
How you feeling, Miss Peebles, honey?
A bit better?

981
01:05:03,037 --> 01:05:05,471
- Thank you, I think I am.
- How about a little drink?

982
01:05:05,637 --> 01:05:08,913
- That won't hurt you.
- Well...

983
01:05:09,637 --> 01:05:12,356
You look like the den mother.
How about you, Miss Fellowes?

984
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:15,793
Thank you, we'll just sit here
and wait until lunch is ready.

985
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:17,794
Miss Fellowes, honey.

986
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:19,436
I know you got a beef or two.

987
01:05:19,677 --> 01:05:22,749
But why don't you just relax
with a little complimentary rum-coco?

988
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:26,512
Save them for your friend, Mr. Shannon.
I don't imbibe.

989
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:28,588
Then how about a little pot?

990
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:30,554
I don't usually serve it to my guests...

991
01:05:30,717 --> 01:05:32,833
...but you look like
you need something special.

992
01:05:39,037 --> 01:05:40,550
May I see?

993
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:43,556
I'm just a quick sketch artist,
Mr. Shannon.

994
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:45,628
Not very talented.

995
01:05:46,557 --> 01:05:48,149
Are my eyes as wild as this?

996
01:05:48,317 --> 01:05:49,636
Yes, they are, Mr. Shannon.

997
01:05:49,797 --> 01:05:51,389
I have fever.

998
01:05:51,557 --> 01:05:54,276
- What gives with you two?
- What do you mean, what gives?

999
01:05:54,437 --> 01:05:56,428
I mean, am I butting in here?
Is three a crowd?

1000
01:05:56,597 --> 01:05:58,713
No, indeed, not a bit.

1001
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:01,272
What are you covering up there?
Let me see.

1002
01:06:02,437 --> 01:06:04,997
What are you drawing him for?
He's broker than you are.

1003
01:06:05,597 --> 01:06:07,508
Perhaps you'd like to keep it,
Mrs. Faulk.

1004
01:06:07,677 --> 01:06:10,635
Thanks a hell of a lot, honey,
but one of him is enough.

1005
01:06:10,797 --> 01:06:13,675
- Who wants a drink?
- Nothing for me, thank you.

1006
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:16,192
Just as well. You're in to me
for the rooms and meals.

1007
01:06:16,357 --> 01:06:18,473
- A little whiskey makes no difference.
- Lay off.

1008
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:21,351
And you go to hell, why don't you!

1009
01:06:28,357 --> 01:06:30,154
Mr. Shannon, Mrs. Faulk.

1010
01:06:30,317 --> 01:06:34,276
This is childish.
Stop it at once. It's disgraceful!

1011
01:06:35,557 --> 01:06:37,388
It's disgraceful.

1012
01:06:40,517 --> 01:06:43,589
- Mrs. Faulk, you must realize...
- I realize you're a deadbeat.

1013
01:06:43,757 --> 01:06:45,588
Using that dying old man as a front...

1014
01:06:45,757 --> 01:06:48,829
...to get you into places when you
ain't got cash for one day in advance.

1015
01:06:49,197 --> 01:06:51,267
You're dragging him around
like a Chinese beggar...

1016
01:06:51,437 --> 01:06:54,747
...dragging around crippled children
to put the touch on the tourists.

1017
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:56,555
I shall go into town.

1018
01:06:56,717 --> 01:06:58,833
And I shall set up my easel in the plaza...

1019
01:06:58,997 --> 01:07:01,636
...and I shall peddle my watercolors,
and sketch tourists.

1020
01:07:01,797 --> 01:07:03,913
I am not a weak person, Mrs. Faulk.

1021
01:07:04,077 --> 01:07:06,033
My failure here is not typical of me.

1022
01:07:06,197 --> 01:07:08,506
- I'm not a weak person either, honey.
- Oh, no, indeed.

1023
01:07:08,677 --> 01:07:11,066
- Your strength is awe-inspiring.
- You bet your...

1024
01:07:15,277 --> 01:07:17,666
How you going into town,
when you ain't got cab fare?

1025
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,187
I shall go on shanks' mare, Mrs. Faulk.

1026
01:07:20,357 --> 01:07:23,349
I'm Nantucket born and bred.
Islanders are good walkers.

1027
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:24,745
I shall pack our things.

1028
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:27,192
And I shall put my grandfather
into his wheelchair...

1029
01:07:27,357 --> 01:07:30,394
...and push him back down this hill
to the road, all the way into town.

1030
01:07:30,557 --> 01:07:32,991
He would prefer that
to staying where he is not wanted.

1031
01:07:33,317 --> 01:07:36,309
And I would prefer it for him
and for myself, Mrs. Faulk.

1032
01:07:36,477 --> 01:07:37,626
All right, calm down.

1033
01:07:37,797 --> 01:07:40,152
- I am perfectly calm, Mrs. Faulk.
- Well, I'm not.

1034
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:42,751
That's the trouble.
The trouble is Shannon.

1035
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:45,431
- I saw the vibrations between you two.
- Mrs. Faulk.

1036
01:07:45,597 --> 01:07:48,191
I'm a New England spinster
who is pushing 40.

1037
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:50,188
Well, who the hell isn't?

1038
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:53,793
I'm good at catching vibrations. And
there were vibrations between you...

1039
01:07:53,957 --> 01:07:56,676
...mutual vibrations,
the minute you got here.

1040
01:07:56,837 --> 01:07:59,590
And just that, believe me, is enough
to put me in a lather.

1041
01:07:59,757 --> 01:08:01,190
And don't ask me why.
Look at him.

1042
01:08:01,357 --> 01:08:03,348
Broke, spooked, as good as fired.

1043
01:08:03,877 --> 01:08:06,949
Those are only his circumstances,
Mrs. Faulk...

1044
01:08:07,117 --> 01:08:09,836
...not the man himself.
- Well, anyhow.

1045
01:08:09,997 --> 01:08:11,350
Forget what I said, honey.

1046
01:08:11,517 --> 01:08:14,236
I wasn't sore at you,
I was sore at Shannon.

1047
01:08:14,397 --> 01:08:17,912
<i>And still the ripe fruit and the branch</i>

1048
01:08:18,077 --> 01:08:21,672
<i>- Observe the sky begin to blanch</i>
- I'll fix old Gramps a toddy.

1049
01:08:21,837 --> 01:08:24,112
- Old folks need it, need a toddy.
<i>- Without a cry...</i>

1050
01:08:24,277 --> 01:08:25,915
That's very kind of you.

1051
01:08:26,077 --> 01:08:28,272
I'll make him a Manhattan
with two cherries in it.

1052
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,109
So he'll live through lunch.

1053
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:31,551
Charlotte.

1054
01:08:31,717 --> 01:08:34,151
- Charlotte!
- What's eating her now?

1055
01:08:34,437 --> 01:08:37,315
Charlotte. Girls! Charlotte!

1056
01:08:37,477 --> 01:08:39,388
What's the trouble now, Miss Fellowes?

1057
01:08:39,557 --> 01:08:41,070
Charlotte. Have you seen her?

1058
01:08:41,237 --> 01:08:43,705
She's disappeared.
Charlotte.

1059
01:08:43,877 --> 01:08:45,629
- Charlotte!
- Charlotte.

1060
01:08:55,837 --> 01:08:57,793
- Charlotte.
- Now be calm, Miss Fellowes.

1061
01:08:57,957 --> 01:08:59,549
Tell us quietly what has happened.

1062
01:08:59,717 --> 01:09:04,029
She didn't come to luncheon. Her room
was empty, and she's not in my room.

1063
01:09:04,197 --> 01:09:06,586
I don't know what's happened.
She doesn't answer.

1064
01:09:06,757 --> 01:09:08,554
- Let's find her. Charlotte.
- Charlotte.

1065
01:09:08,717 --> 01:09:11,550
Charlotte.

1066
01:09:50,557 --> 01:09:52,832
- More.
- No more.

1067
01:09:52,997 --> 01:09:54,794
No more, I say.
Stop it.

1068
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:57,152
- <i>Señorita</i>, go home.
- I have no home.

1069
01:09:57,317 --> 01:09:58,591
Go home, I say.

1070
01:09:58,757 --> 01:10:01,066
Take your dollars with you.
I'm a rich man.

1071
01:10:01,237 --> 01:10:05,435
I do not want your dollars.
I do not want you dancing to my music.

1072
01:10:05,597 --> 01:10:07,189
- More music.
- No more music.

1073
01:10:07,357 --> 01:10:10,554
<i>Señorita</i>, we do not want our sons
to know that young girls can be like you.

1074
01:10:13,357 --> 01:10:17,145
I won't go back up there.
Put me down. Let me go!

1075
01:10:32,557 --> 01:10:34,593
Attaboy, Hank.
Give it to them!

1076
01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:38,476
Hit them.

1077
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:41,430
Knock them down.

1078
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:44,347
Attaboy, hit them.

1079
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:46,556
Yeah, hit them again.

1080
01:10:47,757 --> 01:10:50,351
Yeah, give it to them, Hank.

1081
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:55,394
Come on, hit them.

1082
01:10:58,877 --> 01:11:00,833
Come on, Hank.

1083
01:11:00,997 --> 01:11:03,113
Knock them down! Knock them out!

1084
01:11:03,277 --> 01:11:06,110
Yeah, come on, Hank, give it to them.

1085
01:11:10,877 --> 01:11:12,868
Come on, Hank!

1086
01:11:29,117 --> 01:11:32,996
Oh, Hank, you saved me.
You're so brave.

1087
01:11:33,157 --> 01:11:36,945
My hero. Oh, Hank, take me home.

1088
01:11:37,117 --> 01:11:39,756
I mean home.
I'll tell Daddy it was you who saved me.

1089
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:43,705
Daddy, he loves me.
He'll do anything to thank you.

1090
01:11:46,277 --> 01:11:49,030
I wonder if any of you ladies
would be interested in seeing...

1091
01:11:49,197 --> 01:11:50,630
...some samples of my work?

1092
01:11:50,797 --> 01:11:52,150
This one is entitled:

1093
01:11:52,357 --> 01:11:54,712
<i>Moonlight Recollected by Daylight</i>.

1094
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:59,587
And here, here is a character sketch
that I did in less than five minutes.

1095
01:11:59,757 --> 01:12:04,069
The queen, when she was Princess
Elizabeth, on a tour of Africa years ago.

1096
01:12:04,277 --> 01:12:05,915
I couldn't get very close, of course.

1097
01:12:06,077 --> 01:12:08,193
- I had to use field glasses.
- No, thank you.

1098
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:13,306
<i>Love's an old remembered song</i>
<i>A drunken fiddler plays</i>

1099
01:12:13,477 --> 01:12:16,913
<i>Stumbling crazily along</i>
<i>Crooked alleyways</i>

1100
01:12:17,077 --> 01:12:20,786
- Not now, Nonno.
- <i>When his heart is mad with music</i>

1101
01:12:20,957 --> 01:12:24,029
<i>- He will play the...</i>
- Nonno, please.

1102
01:12:27,717 --> 01:12:30,709
He thinks that someone called
for a recitation of one of his poems.

1103
01:12:30,877 --> 01:12:32,151
Don't you worry, honey.

1104
01:12:32,317 --> 01:12:34,785
In this crowd,
old Gramps is the life of the party.

1105
01:12:34,957 --> 01:12:37,027
Gramps, honey, here.

1106
01:12:37,277 --> 01:12:39,074
Finish your toddy.

1107
01:12:40,797 --> 01:12:43,152
I don't care what anybody says.

1108
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,830
This fish is delicious.

1109
01:12:45,157 --> 01:12:47,671
Swing it this way.
I could handle another helping.

1110
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:52,556
And no funny stuff.
Keep those dukes on the platter.

1111
01:12:57,917 --> 01:12:59,145
What did he say?

1112
01:12:59,317 --> 01:13:03,230
He says you're a hell of a man
in action against a fish...

1113
01:13:03,397 --> 01:13:05,467
...if it's a dead fish.

1114
01:13:11,237 --> 01:13:13,148
Very funny.

1115
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:17,034
Daddy always says the only difference
between a success and a failure...

1116
01:13:17,197 --> 01:13:20,792
...is that a success knows an opportunity
when he sees it, and a failure doesn't.

1117
01:13:20,957 --> 01:13:23,266
Well, don't worry about me
recognizing an opportunity.

1118
01:13:23,437 --> 01:13:26,713
Oh, Hank. When I tell Daddy,
he'll be so proud of you.

1119
01:13:26,877 --> 01:13:29,072
Hannah?
What was the take?

1120
01:13:29,237 --> 01:13:31,831
Grandfather, please stop shouting.

1121
01:13:31,997 --> 01:13:34,909
Did they cross your palm
with silver or paper, Hannah?

1122
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:38,433
Nonno, no more shouting,
we're having lunch.

1123
01:13:38,597 --> 01:13:39,825
Chow time, Gramps.

1124
01:13:39,997 --> 01:13:42,067
How much did they come across with?

1125
01:13:42,437 --> 01:13:44,029
He won't stop shouting.

1126
01:13:44,597 --> 01:13:46,827
Gramps. Five dollars.

1127
01:13:46,997 --> 01:13:48,669
I'm putting it in your pocket.

1128
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:50,908
We can't accept gratuities,
Mr. Shannon.

1129
01:13:51,077 --> 01:13:53,307
Oh, hell, it was only pesos.

1130
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:56,065
Yeah, we're going to clean up
in this place.

1131
01:13:56,237 --> 01:13:58,592
You bet we're going
to clean up here, Gramps.

1132
01:13:58,957 --> 01:14:01,949
If there's a cocktail lounge,
we ought to work that first.

1133
01:14:02,117 --> 01:14:04,506
Strike while the iron is hot.

1134
01:14:04,717 --> 01:14:06,275
While it's hot.

1135
01:14:06,437 --> 01:14:08,029
Hello?

1136
01:14:08,197 --> 01:14:09,835
Hello?

1137
01:14:10,917 --> 01:14:12,953
Speaking.

1138
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:15,473
Anything I can do for you?

1139
01:14:16,357 --> 01:14:18,029
Who?

1140
01:14:18,877 --> 01:14:20,071
Shannon.

1141
01:14:20,237 --> 01:14:23,627
You're wanted on the blower.
El Paso. Person-to-person.

1142
01:14:24,837 --> 01:14:27,226
This is the moment you've awaited,
Miss Fellowes.

1143
01:14:27,397 --> 01:14:30,833
That will be my esteemed,
but not by me, employer.

1144
01:14:30,997 --> 01:14:34,751
I will now demonstrate to you how
a man of integrity brings an almost...

1145
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:39,229
...insoluble situation
to a triumphant conclusion.

1146
01:14:56,077 --> 01:14:59,194
The Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon
speaking.

1147
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:04,228
Well, Mr. Blake, how are you?
Nice of you to call.

1148
01:15:04,397 --> 01:15:07,867
Wish you were down here with us.
The air's like spring wine down here...

1149
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:09,595
...at this time of year.

1150
01:15:09,757 --> 01:15:12,874
What do you mean, on the sauce? You
know me better than that, Mr. Blake.

1151
01:15:14,437 --> 01:15:16,792
I don't care what any
judge in Corpus Christi says.

1152
01:15:16,957 --> 01:15:20,916
You know and I know that I am a
regularly ordained minister of the gospel.

1153
01:15:21,077 --> 01:15:25,275
<i>- Shannon, you're fired as of right now.</i>
- Now, wait a minute, you big fat zero.

1154
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:26,790
Let me tell you something.

1155
01:15:26,957 --> 01:15:29,915
A tour conductor is like
the captain of a ship.

1156
01:15:30,077 --> 01:15:33,308
Once the bus leaves the terminal
he is in sole command.

1157
01:15:33,477 --> 01:15:35,547
And let me assure you...

1158
01:15:35,717 --> 01:15:37,912
...that Shannon runs a taut bus.

1159
01:15:38,197 --> 01:15:40,631
A very taut bus. I've taken it past...

1160
01:15:40,797 --> 01:15:43,550
...deadly shoals and all the perils
of the deep.

1161
01:15:43,717 --> 01:15:47,346
Figuratively speaking, of course.
And I remain in command.

1162
01:15:47,637 --> 01:15:51,391
I have here in my pocket
the symbol of my command.

1163
01:15:51,557 --> 01:15:53,354
Right here, in my pocket.

1164
01:15:53,517 --> 01:15:56,793
You cannot fire a man
who has the distributor head.

1165
01:15:56,957 --> 01:15:58,948
Shannon can fire Blake's Tours...

1166
01:15:59,117 --> 01:16:01,631
...but Blake's Tours cannot fire Shannon.

1167
01:16:01,797 --> 01:16:04,948
- This tour will end in peace and unity.
- <i>You're fired, Shannon!</i>

1168
01:16:05,117 --> 01:16:08,109
Shannon will emerge triumphant.

1169
01:16:10,877 --> 01:16:14,187
Well, Hank, aren't you proud of me?
As a member of my crew...

1170
01:16:14,357 --> 01:16:16,188
...aren't you proud of me?

1171
01:16:16,357 --> 01:16:21,192
Hank, you know that... That shiner
gives you character, Hank.

1172
01:16:21,357 --> 01:16:23,234
Hey, lay off, you big baboon.

1173
01:16:23,397 --> 01:16:25,786
I got it. I got it, I got it. I got it!

1174
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:28,073
That's to show how I hate you.

1175
01:16:28,237 --> 01:16:30,353
I hate you.

1176
01:16:30,517 --> 01:16:34,510
Foe. I thought you were my friend
and you turned out to be my foe. Foe.

1177
01:16:34,677 --> 01:16:37,066
You're all through, Reverend.
You've had it.

1178
01:16:37,277 --> 01:16:39,233
Relax, baby. The party's over.

1179
01:16:39,397 --> 01:16:40,955
Okay, folks, let's get cracking.

1180
01:16:41,117 --> 01:16:43,585
Get your duds together, we're
ready to blow this goat shed.

1181
01:16:43,757 --> 01:16:45,748
- Goat shed?
- Come on, I'll help you get packed.

1182
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:48,829
You got rooms in Puerto Vallarta.
I'll have you there in 20 minutes.

1183
01:16:48,997 --> 01:16:52,034
From now on, this tour is gonna be
conducted like a respectable tour.

1184
01:16:52,197 --> 01:16:54,757
Respectable? Why these ladies have had,
some of them...

1185
01:16:54,917 --> 01:16:58,432
...most of them, if not all of them,
for the first time in their lives...

1186
01:16:58,597 --> 01:17:02,067
...contact, social contact, with a
gentleman born and bred...

1187
01:17:02,237 --> 01:17:05,070
...whom under no other circumstances
could they possibly have met.

1188
01:17:05,237 --> 01:17:07,467
The son of a clergyman
and the grandson of two bishops.

1189
01:17:07,637 --> 01:17:08,865
Churchmen on both sides
of the family.

1190
01:17:13,557 --> 01:17:15,752
- How's old Gramps doing?
- He's sleeping just now.

1191
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:17,794
Through that riot?

1192
01:17:18,837 --> 01:17:21,112
Will Mr. Shannon be all right,
do you think?

1193
01:17:21,277 --> 01:17:23,871
All right? Honey, I don't know.

1194
01:17:24,037 --> 01:17:28,269
He cracks up like this so regular,
you can set a calendar by it.

1195
01:17:28,437 --> 01:17:29,836
About twice a year.

1196
01:17:29,997 --> 01:17:31,953
He's done it twice down here.

1197
01:17:32,117 --> 01:17:35,075
Fred used to say it had something to do
with the moon.

1198
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:38,954
I sure wish old Fred was here right now.

1199
01:17:40,357 --> 01:17:42,188
Oh, my God!

1200
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,825
- What is it, Mrs. Faulk?
- Honey, I advise you not to look.

1201
01:17:44,997 --> 01:17:48,353
Just take my word for it.
Old Shannon is out-Shannoning Shannon.

1202
01:17:50,797 --> 01:17:55,029
Shannon, you beast. You beast.
You, you... You unutterable beast!

1203
01:17:55,997 --> 01:17:58,113
Did you see what he did?

1204
01:17:58,277 --> 01:18:02,031
All right, ladies, now keep calm.
Keep calm, ladies. Just follow me.

1205
01:18:02,877 --> 01:18:04,674
Follow me down the hill.

1206
01:18:05,277 --> 01:18:07,188
Make sure you get my bag.

1207
01:18:13,597 --> 01:18:15,553
Shannon.

1208
01:18:16,197 --> 01:18:19,394
You've avenged yourself for
all time on Miss Fellowes' suitcase.

1209
01:18:19,557 --> 01:18:22,594
I've heard of a dog cocking his leg.

1210
01:18:23,837 --> 01:18:25,987
Why don't you buzz off
on your broomstick?

1211
01:18:26,157 --> 01:18:28,034
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to him.

1212
01:18:28,357 --> 01:18:31,394
I'm going to have you blacklisted
in every travel agency in America.

1213
01:18:31,717 --> 01:18:35,869
What about Africa, Tasmania,
Bechuanaland, Tonmawr?

1214
01:18:36,037 --> 01:18:37,834
Please, Miss Fellowes, leave him alone.

1215
01:18:37,997 --> 01:18:40,989
As soon as I get back, I'm gonna swear
out a warrant for your arrest.

1216
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:44,593
Molesting a minor, kidnapping,
malicious damage to private property.

1217
01:18:44,757 --> 01:18:46,110
Indecent exposure.

1218
01:18:46,277 --> 01:18:49,633
What subject do you teach
back in that college of yours, honey?

1219
01:18:49,797 --> 01:18:53,676
- Voice, if that has anything to do with it.
- Well, geography's my speciality.

1220
01:18:53,837 --> 01:18:55,828
Did you know that if it wasn't for
the dykes...

1221
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:58,431
...the plains of Texas would be engulfed
by the Gulf?

1222
01:18:58,597 --> 01:18:59,746
Maxine.

1223
01:18:59,917 --> 01:19:01,714
Let's level a while, butch, old gal.

1224
01:19:01,877 --> 01:19:04,186
Do you know what you're sore about,
really sore about?

1225
01:19:04,357 --> 01:19:07,952
That little quail of yours has a natural
preference for men instead of...

1226
01:19:08,117 --> 01:19:09,436
Maxine!

1227
01:19:12,677 --> 01:19:13,951
What is she talking about?

1228
01:19:14,677 --> 01:19:17,589
You'd better go now, Miss Fellowes.
The party's over.

1229
01:19:17,757 --> 01:19:19,907
Right now, I'm no longer
in a position to...

1230
01:19:20,077 --> 01:19:22,910
...discharge my responsibility
of protecting you.

1231
01:19:23,077 --> 01:19:26,433
Responsibility from which
you discharged me.

1232
01:19:26,717 --> 01:19:28,355
Just go, Miss Fellowes.

1233
01:19:28,517 --> 01:19:30,075
Just go.

1234
01:19:37,717 --> 01:19:40,868
What did you shut me up for? It's time
somebody told that old dame off.

1235
01:19:41,677 --> 01:19:43,349
Miss Fellowes is a highly moral person.

1236
01:19:43,517 --> 01:19:46,873
And if she ever recognized the truth
about herself, it would destroy her.

1237
01:19:47,317 --> 01:19:49,911
Well, she's done a pretty good job
of destroying you.

1238
01:19:50,277 --> 01:19:51,869
Maxine.

1239
01:19:52,157 --> 01:19:56,036
Don't rob me of the credit
for my own small accomplishments.

1240
01:19:59,117 --> 01:20:02,871
Jehoshaphat, the bill!
They haven't paid the cotton-picking bill!

1241
01:20:04,357 --> 01:20:06,917
All right, ladies, take your seats,
we'll be out of here.

1242
01:20:07,077 --> 01:20:10,592
I don't know, I kind of hate to leave
this nice place.

1243
01:20:10,757 --> 01:20:12,429
Peebie.

1244
01:20:13,557 --> 01:20:16,151
- Charlotte, you get in next.
- Climb in, Miss Fellowes.

1245
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:18,353
Charlotte's sitting up front with me.

1246
01:20:20,277 --> 01:20:21,756
Hey!

1247
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,396
Just a flipping minute.

1248
01:20:23,557 --> 01:20:26,151
- What is it now?
- 300 pesos, that's what it is now.

1249
01:20:26,317 --> 01:20:28,512
- Twenty-four dollars.
- What about my suitcase?

1250
01:20:28,677 --> 01:20:31,032
Miss Fellowes, honey,
you ain't gonna blame that on me.

1251
01:20:31,197 --> 01:20:34,109
I blame your tout that brought us
here. Collect the money from him.

1252
01:20:34,277 --> 01:20:38,111
Miss Fellowes, you've been doing a lot of
complaining about the food on this trip.

1253
01:20:38,277 --> 01:20:40,996
You figure you're gonna do any better
in a Mexican jail?

1254
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:45,827
- Attagirl.
- One, two, three.

1255
01:20:46,957 --> 01:20:50,029
And watch out for the fleas
at the Ambos Mundos.

1256
01:20:50,197 --> 01:20:53,075
All you have to do is sponge down
with a little kerosene.

1257
01:20:53,237 --> 01:20:57,150
The manager keeps a big supply
right in the lobby.

1258
01:20:57,997 --> 01:21:00,830
There go your ladies, Mr. Shannon.

1259
01:21:03,237 --> 01:21:05,797
The spook's triumphant.

1260
01:21:06,197 --> 01:21:08,233
He's won his point.

1261
01:21:08,677 --> 01:21:11,589
He's proved there's no place
for Shannon...

1262
01:21:11,757 --> 01:21:14,112
...on the realistic level.

1263
01:21:14,557 --> 01:21:18,436
The last thin thread
that bound him there...

1264
01:21:18,597 --> 01:21:20,428
...is broken.

1265
01:21:21,237 --> 01:21:23,068
Now, Lord...

1266
01:21:23,317 --> 01:21:25,353
...letteth thy servant...

1267
01:21:25,517 --> 01:21:27,872
...depart in peace.

1268
01:21:28,037 --> 01:21:31,393
Mr. Shannon, stop that.
You're cutting yourself doing that.

1269
01:21:31,557 --> 01:21:33,036
Here. Please. Let me help.

1270
01:21:33,197 --> 01:21:36,030
- Let me take it off.
- I've got to break the chain.

1271
01:21:36,197 --> 01:21:39,030
No, no, no. Now, wait. Wait.

1272
01:21:39,637 --> 01:21:41,468
There.

1273
01:21:41,637 --> 01:21:43,150
There, I have it.

1274
01:21:43,317 --> 01:21:44,511
Thank you.

1275
01:21:44,677 --> 01:21:47,350
It's yours. You keep it.

1276
01:21:47,557 --> 01:21:49,229
Where are you going?

1277
01:21:49,397 --> 01:21:52,355
The long swim. To China.

1278
01:21:55,157 --> 01:21:57,591
Mrs. Faulk, stop him.

1279
01:21:58,757 --> 01:22:00,509
Mrs. Faulk.

1280
01:22:01,557 --> 01:22:03,354
Mrs. Faulk, stop him.

1281
01:22:03,517 --> 01:22:06,429
You must stop him. Please stop him.

1282
01:22:34,597 --> 01:22:36,030
Knock him out if you have to.

1283
01:22:36,397 --> 01:22:37,671
Hang one on him.

1284
01:22:54,397 --> 01:22:55,546
Baby.

1285
01:22:55,717 --> 01:22:57,628
You've got the daddy of all spooks.

1286
01:22:57,797 --> 01:22:59,435
This is a blue plate special.

1287
01:22:59,597 --> 01:23:03,112
- Let me out of here!
- You lie doggone now. Quiet down.

1288
01:23:03,277 --> 01:23:05,837
You know and I know
that half this show you're putting on...

1289
01:23:05,997 --> 01:23:08,557
...is playacting. Only trouble is,
sharks don't know that.

1290
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,311
- Let me loose.
- Honey, you scared me...

1291
01:23:11,477 --> 01:23:14,753
...out of seven years' growth tonight,
you ain't gonna do it again.

1292
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:16,191
Mrs. Faulk?

1293
01:23:16,397 --> 01:23:19,389
I wonder if you'd mind
making a pot of this tea?

1294
01:23:19,557 --> 01:23:22,469
Miss Jelkes, does this strike you
as the right time for a tea party?

1295
01:23:22,637 --> 01:23:26,152
But this isn't ordinary tea. It's poppy
seed tea. It has a very calming effect.

1296
01:23:26,317 --> 01:23:27,386
Let me go!

1297
01:23:28,277 --> 01:23:31,110
- Tea, it's a hell of a solution.
- Please believe me, Mrs. Faulk.

1298
01:23:31,277 --> 01:23:34,030
I've had experience of someone
in Mr. Shannon's condition.

1299
01:23:34,197 --> 01:23:36,665
And I do know whereof I speak.

1300
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:39,275
Untie me!

1301
01:23:42,037 --> 01:23:45,268
Poppy seed makes a mild
sedative drink...

1302
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:49,510
...that helps you get through nights
that are hard for you to get through.

1303
01:23:50,517 --> 01:23:52,633
We could all use some tonight.

1304
01:23:52,797 --> 01:23:54,071
Because for all of us...

1305
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:57,547
...you, me, my grandfather...

1306
01:23:57,717 --> 01:23:59,628
...this won't be an easy night
to get through.

1307
01:23:59,797 --> 01:24:02,391
<i>Without a cry, without a prayer</i>

1308
01:24:02,557 --> 01:24:05,594
<i>- With no betrayal of despair</i>
- Untie me.

1309
01:24:05,757 --> 01:24:07,554
- Not yet.
- I'm panicking.

1310
01:24:07,717 --> 01:24:09,435
- I know.
- A man can die of panic.

1311
01:24:09,597 --> 01:24:12,350
Not when he enjoys it as much
as you do, Mr. Shannon.

1312
01:24:12,517 --> 01:24:15,634
What do you mean by that insult? You
think I like being tied in this hammock...

1313
01:24:15,797 --> 01:24:18,106
...trussed up like a hog
in a slaughterhouse?

1314
01:24:18,277 --> 01:24:22,395
No, who wouldn't like to atone
for the sins of themselves...

1315
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:25,833
...and the world if it could be
done in a hammock with ropes...

1316
01:24:25,997 --> 01:24:28,875
...instead of on a cross with nails?

1317
01:24:29,037 --> 01:24:31,232
On a green hilltop...

1318
01:24:31,397 --> 01:24:35,549
...instead of on Golgotha,
the place of the skulls.

1319
01:24:35,957 --> 01:24:38,551
Isn't that a comparatively
comfortable...

1320
01:24:38,717 --> 01:24:43,871
...almost voluptuous crucifixion to suffer
for the sins of the world, Mr. Shannon?

1321
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:46,756
- Why have you turned against me?
- I haven't turned against you.

1322
01:24:46,917 --> 01:24:49,590
Thought you were sexless, but you've
suddenly turned into a woman.

1323
01:24:49,757 --> 01:24:50,872
You know how I know that?

1324
01:24:51,037 --> 01:24:54,347
Because you, not me, are taking
pleasure in my being tied up.

1325
01:24:54,517 --> 01:24:56,667
All women, whether they want
to face it or not...

1326
01:24:56,837 --> 01:24:58,873
...want to see a man
in a tied-up situation.

1327
01:24:59,037 --> 01:25:02,871
They spend their lives trying to get
a man into a tied-up situation.

1328
01:25:03,037 --> 01:25:05,835
Their lives are fulfilled when
they get as many men as they can...

1329
01:25:05,997 --> 01:25:07,874
...into a tied-up situation.

1330
01:25:08,037 --> 01:25:11,313
I'd like to untie you right now,
but I can't.

1331
01:25:11,477 --> 01:25:12,990
You believe in people being tied up?

1332
01:25:13,157 --> 01:25:16,945
Only when they might take
the long swim to China.

1333
01:25:18,397 --> 01:25:20,911
The long swim to China...

1334
01:25:21,077 --> 01:25:22,430
Shannon!

1335
01:25:22,597 --> 01:25:23,950
- Oh, yeah.
- Stop.

1336
01:25:24,117 --> 01:25:26,677
Stop it. Stop it, Shannon.

1337
01:25:26,877 --> 01:25:29,232
I'm gonna call Dr. Lopez.

1338
01:25:29,397 --> 01:25:32,514
And I'm gonna have you carted off
to the <i>Casa de Locos.</i>

1339
01:25:32,677 --> 01:25:35,032
- And you'll be put in a cell, alone!
- Off, off!

1340
01:25:35,197 --> 01:25:37,347
With hay on the floor and a bucket.
And that's all!

1341
01:25:37,517 --> 01:25:38,836
Off! Off! Off!

1342
01:25:38,997 --> 01:25:40,271
Off!

1343
01:25:40,437 --> 01:25:43,190
- Here, Mr. Shannon, drink this.
- Untie me!

1344
01:25:43,357 --> 01:25:45,996
You can holler
and howl to your heart's content...

1345
01:25:46,157 --> 01:25:48,466
...in the <i>Casa de Locos.</i>
All day and all night.

1346
01:25:48,637 --> 01:25:50,195
I'm a citizen with inalienable rights.

1347
01:25:50,357 --> 01:25:52,268
Get me the consul.
I demand to see the consul!

1348
01:25:52,437 --> 01:25:55,156
Please, Mr. Shannon,
drink this poppy seed tea.

1349
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:57,785
How can I with the widow Faulk
sitting on me?

1350
01:25:57,957 --> 01:26:00,551
Here, give me that tea. I made it.
I'll give it to him.

1351
01:26:00,717 --> 01:26:02,867
Drink this, you buzzard!

1352
01:26:03,717 --> 01:26:05,708
It's scalding.

1353
01:26:05,877 --> 01:26:08,311
Thank you, Maxine.
That's all I needed.

1354
01:26:08,477 --> 01:26:10,195
To have my mouth burned raw.

1355
01:26:10,357 --> 01:26:13,394
Now, if you could put some splinters
of bamboo under my fingernails...

1356
01:26:13,557 --> 01:26:17,550
...and have my eyelids cut off...
- Mrs. Faulk, let me.

1357
01:26:17,837 --> 01:26:19,065
Okay, honey.

1358
01:26:19,237 --> 01:26:20,989
You take over completely.

1359
01:26:21,157 --> 01:26:22,749
He's entirely yours.

1360
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:24,987
May I make a further suggestion,
Maxine?

1361
01:26:25,157 --> 01:26:27,717
Why don't you go moonlight bathing
with your beach boys.

1362
01:26:27,877 --> 01:26:29,310
Don't let my presence stop you...

1363
01:26:29,477 --> 01:26:32,469
...any more than old Fred's presence
used to stop you.

1364
01:26:32,997 --> 01:26:35,306
You bastard!

1365
01:26:36,037 --> 01:26:37,311
Pepe.

1366
01:26:37,477 --> 01:26:39,229
Pedro.

1367
01:26:40,477 --> 01:26:43,275
You no-good bastard!

1368
01:26:47,637 --> 01:26:50,071
That was cruel, Mr. Shannon.

1369
01:26:50,237 --> 01:26:51,955
Childishly cruel.

1370
01:26:52,117 --> 01:26:56,747
I can't stand for a person I respect
to behave like a small, cruel boy.

1371
01:26:56,917 --> 01:27:00,796
Now, what do you respect in me,
Miss Thin-Standing-Up-Female-Buddha?

1372
01:27:00,997 --> 01:27:03,431
I respect anybody who has had to...

1373
01:27:03,597 --> 01:27:06,191
...fight and howl for his decency.

1374
01:27:06,357 --> 01:27:09,429
- What decency?
- Yes. His decency.

1375
01:27:09,597 --> 01:27:10,746
And his...

1376
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:12,509
His bit of goodness.

1377
01:27:12,677 --> 01:27:15,237
Far more than I respect
those lucky ones who've...

1378
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:18,150
...had theirs handed out
to them at birth...

1379
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:23,994
...and never afterwards snatched
away from them by unbearable torments.

1380
01:27:24,157 --> 01:27:26,432
<i>A chronicle no longer gold</i>

1381
01:27:27,277 --> 01:27:30,110
<i>A bargaining with mist and mold</i>

1382
01:27:30,277 --> 01:27:33,553
Listen to him,
saying them over and over.

1383
01:27:33,717 --> 01:27:36,106
The lines of his new poem.

1384
01:27:36,357 --> 01:27:39,667
Like a blind man climbing a staircase
that leads nowhere.

1385
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:41,429
Should you be in there
helping him?

1386
01:27:41,597 --> 01:27:45,636
He'll call me when he needs me.
Drink this, Mr. Shannon.

1387
01:27:48,357 --> 01:27:50,917
I have no right to ask the question...

1388
01:27:51,077 --> 01:27:54,513
...but why did you go to such lengths
to protect Miss Fellowes...

1389
01:27:54,677 --> 01:27:56,668
...for whom you have no high regard...

1390
01:27:56,997 --> 01:28:01,115
...and to equal lengths
to hurt Mrs. Faulk, for whom you have?

1391
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:03,154
Maxine's indestructible.

1392
01:28:03,317 --> 01:28:04,716
Is she?

1393
01:28:04,877 --> 01:28:06,549
Or does she just give that impression?

1394
01:28:06,717 --> 01:28:09,948
The only impression Maxine
gives is herself. Maxine's Maxine.

1395
01:28:10,117 --> 01:28:14,110
And I'm a no-good bastard.
Lay it to the drink. I'm a bad drunk.

1396
01:28:14,277 --> 01:28:16,996
You were drunk when you came
to Miss Fellowes' rescue.

1397
01:28:17,397 --> 01:28:18,910
I got drunker.

1398
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:24,191
Drink isn't your problem, Mr. Shannon.

1399
01:28:24,357 --> 01:28:27,315
And what is my problem, Miss Jelkes?

1400
01:28:27,477 --> 01:28:29,513
The oldest one in the world.

1401
01:28:29,677 --> 01:28:32,953
The need to believe in someone,
or something.

1402
01:28:33,437 --> 01:28:36,190
Almost anyone. Almost anything.

1403
01:28:36,357 --> 01:28:39,554
- Your voice sounds hopeless about it.
- Oh, no, I'm not hopeless about it.

1404
01:28:39,717 --> 01:28:43,187
In fact, I've...
I've discovered something to believe in.

1405
01:28:43,837 --> 01:28:45,156
What?

1406
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:50,834
Broken barriers between people.

1407
01:28:51,077 --> 01:28:53,432
A wanting to help each other.

1408
01:28:53,637 --> 01:28:55,229
Through nights like this.

1409
01:28:55,397 --> 01:28:57,308
One-night stands.

1410
01:28:58,157 --> 01:29:02,514
One-night communications
between them.

1411
01:29:02,677 --> 01:29:04,508
On a veranda...

1412
01:29:04,677 --> 01:29:07,794
...outside their separate cubicles.

1413
01:29:09,717 --> 01:29:11,947
You don't mean physically, do you?

1414
01:29:13,357 --> 01:29:15,791
- No.
- I didn't think you did.

1415
01:29:15,957 --> 01:29:21,907
<i>An intercourse not well-designed</i>
<i>For beings of a golden kind</i>

1416
01:29:22,077 --> 01:29:25,035
<i>Whose native green must arch above</i>

1417
01:29:25,197 --> 01:29:28,348
<i>The earth</i> '<i>s obscene, corrupting love</i>

1418
01:29:28,517 --> 01:29:30,587
Is that what you advocate for me?

1419
01:29:30,757 --> 01:29:33,669
Is that what you call a human
relationship, you and grandpa there?

1420
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:36,994
Yes, Mr. Shannon. Yes. Yes, I do.

1421
01:29:37,157 --> 01:29:40,354
We make a home for each other,
my grandfather and I.

1422
01:29:40,517 --> 01:29:43,589
Oh, I don't mean a regular home,
because...

1423
01:29:43,757 --> 01:29:45,907
...I don't regard a home as a...

1424
01:29:46,077 --> 01:29:48,830
As a place, a building...

1425
01:29:48,997 --> 01:29:50,908
...bricks, wood, stone.

1426
01:29:52,157 --> 01:29:53,954
I think of a home...

1427
01:29:54,117 --> 01:29:57,189
...as something two people have
between them.

1428
01:29:57,357 --> 01:29:59,075
In which each can...

1429
01:29:59,237 --> 01:30:01,797
...nest, rest...

1430
01:30:01,957 --> 01:30:03,993
...live in, emotionally speaking.

1431
01:30:04,157 --> 01:30:06,512
Does that make any sense to you,
Mr. Shannon?

1432
01:30:06,677 --> 01:30:08,190
Yes, but...

1433
01:30:08,357 --> 01:30:09,995
Well, go on. But what?

1434
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:13,512
Oh, leave it, I'd only say something
to hurt you.

1435
01:30:14,437 --> 01:30:18,749
- I'm not thin-skinned, Mr. Shannon.
- Very well. When a bird builds a nest...

1436
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:21,795
...to rest in and live in he doesn't build
it in a falling-down tree.

1437
01:30:22,157 --> 01:30:23,556
I'm not a bird, Mr. Shannon.

1438
01:30:23,717 --> 01:30:27,232
He builds with an eye to the permanence
of the location, and for the purpose of...

1439
01:30:27,397 --> 01:30:30,036
...mating and propagating the species.

1440
01:30:30,197 --> 01:30:34,429
I still say I'm not a bird, Mr. Shannon.
I'm a human being.

1441
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:37,953
And when one of that unique species...

1442
01:30:38,117 --> 01:30:40,108
...builds its nest
in the heart of another...

1443
01:30:40,277 --> 01:30:42,950
...the questions of permanence
and propagation...

1444
01:30:43,117 --> 01:30:46,871
...aren't the first, or even
the last things to be considered.

1445
01:30:47,237 --> 01:30:49,671
What is important...

1446
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:51,708
...is that one is never alone.

1447
01:31:39,317 --> 01:31:42,468
You've been asking all the questions,
Miss Jelkes. May I ask one of you?

1448
01:31:42,637 --> 01:31:45,595
Ask it. There's no limit on questions
here tonight.

1449
01:31:45,757 --> 01:31:47,110
And on answers?

1450
01:31:47,277 --> 01:31:50,906
None that I can think of, Mr. Shannon,
between you and me.

1451
01:31:51,077 --> 01:31:53,545
This, then, is the question.

1452
01:31:53,837 --> 01:31:55,953
Have you never in your life
had any kind of...

1453
01:31:56,117 --> 01:31:57,755
...Iove life?

1454
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:01,633
Would you mind repeating the question?

1455
01:32:01,797 --> 01:32:06,746
Have you never in your life or travels had
any encounter with any experience of...

1456
01:32:06,917 --> 01:32:10,227
...what Larry the Crackpot
would describe as a love life?

1457
01:32:12,037 --> 01:32:14,710
There are worse things than chastity,
Mr. Shannon.

1458
01:32:15,237 --> 01:32:16,955
Yes, lunacy and death.

1459
01:32:17,117 --> 01:32:19,506
Well, if you don't want to answer
the question...

1460
01:32:19,837 --> 01:32:22,271
No, no, I don't mind answering.

1461
01:32:23,357 --> 01:32:24,676
Yes.

1462
01:32:24,837 --> 01:32:29,831
Yes. I have had two experiences...
Well, encounters with.

1463
01:32:30,397 --> 01:32:31,546
Two.

1464
01:32:32,037 --> 01:32:34,028
Yes, I said two.

1465
01:32:35,557 --> 01:32:36,990
When I was 16.

1466
01:32:37,797 --> 01:32:39,435
Sixteen.

1467
01:32:40,197 --> 01:32:42,108
Yes, 16.

1468
01:32:44,877 --> 01:32:47,072
When I was 16...

1469
01:32:47,277 --> 01:32:49,632
...every Saturday I would go
to the Saturday matinee...

1470
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:51,947
...at the Nantucket Movie Theater.

1471
01:32:52,117 --> 01:32:55,712
That was soon after my parents were
killed in an automobile accident...

1472
01:32:55,877 --> 01:32:58,107
...and I was very alone.

1473
01:32:58,837 --> 01:33:01,556
Well, one day a young man...

1474
01:33:01,717 --> 01:33:04,675
...sat down beside me
and pushed his knee against mine.

1475
01:33:05,317 --> 01:33:10,186
I moved over but he moved over too,
and continued the pressure.

1476
01:33:10,397 --> 01:33:12,353
I jumped up and screamed...

1477
01:33:12,517 --> 01:33:15,589
...and he was arrested
for molesting a minor.

1478
01:33:16,197 --> 01:33:18,108
Is he still in the Nantucket jail?

1479
01:33:18,557 --> 01:33:20,434
No. No, I got him out.

1480
01:33:20,597 --> 01:33:23,350
I told the police it was a Garbo picture.

1481
01:33:23,557 --> 01:33:24,990
It was a Garbo picture.

1482
01:33:25,317 --> 01:33:27,433
And that I was just overexcited.

1483
01:33:27,597 --> 01:33:29,235
And the second?

1484
01:33:30,437 --> 01:33:33,952
The second experience
is much more recent.

1485
01:33:34,397 --> 01:33:38,913
Only four years ago,
when Nonno and I were in Hong Kong.

1486
01:33:40,157 --> 01:33:41,306
One evening...

1487
01:33:41,477 --> 01:33:44,753
...in the Palm Court of Cliff Hotel...

1488
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:47,954
...we met this middle-aged, sort of...

1489
01:33:48,117 --> 01:33:50,915
...nondescript Australian salesman.

1490
01:33:51,077 --> 01:33:55,673
You know, plump, bald, spotted,
and terribly over-friendly.

1491
01:33:56,357 --> 01:33:59,076
I did a sketch of him
that was shamelessly flattering...

1492
01:33:59,237 --> 01:34:01,432
...for which he paid me
more than my usual price.

1493
01:34:01,597 --> 01:34:03,747
Ten Malayan dollars.

1494
01:34:04,157 --> 01:34:08,833
Then, he asked me out
in a sampan with him.

1495
01:34:09,437 --> 01:34:12,509
Well, he'd been so generous...

1496
01:34:12,677 --> 01:34:14,429
...I accepted.

1497
01:34:14,677 --> 01:34:16,030
I did.

1498
01:34:16,197 --> 01:34:17,471
I accepted.

1499
01:34:18,437 --> 01:34:20,871
Grandfather went up to bed.

1500
01:34:21,037 --> 01:34:23,631
And I went out in the sampan...

1501
01:34:23,797 --> 01:34:26,630
...with the Aussie underwear salesman.

1502
01:34:28,357 --> 01:34:31,235
I noticed he became more and more...

1503
01:34:32,037 --> 01:34:33,390
What?

1504
01:34:34,117 --> 01:34:36,028
Agitated.

1505
01:34:36,877 --> 01:34:39,630
Well, finally, he leant towards me.

1506
01:34:39,797 --> 01:34:42,630
We were vis-à-vis in the sampan.

1507
01:34:42,797 --> 01:34:47,666
And he looked intensely and passionately
into my eyes and said:

1508
01:34:47,837 --> 01:34:51,227
"Miss Jelkes, would you do me a favor?

1509
01:34:51,397 --> 01:34:53,786
Would you do something for me?"

1510
01:34:54,237 --> 01:34:56,148
"What?" I asked.

1511
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:58,154
"Well," he said:

1512
01:34:58,317 --> 01:35:00,433
"If I turn my back...

1513
01:35:00,597 --> 01:35:02,952
...if I look the other way...

1514
01:35:03,877 --> 01:35:08,587
...will you take off some piece
of your clothing and let me hold it?

1515
01:35:08,757 --> 01:35:10,270
Just hold it."

1516
01:35:10,757 --> 01:35:13,908
And what did you do in this situation?

1517
01:35:14,437 --> 01:35:16,348
I did as he asked.

1518
01:35:16,637 --> 01:35:18,229
And he kept his promise.

1519
01:35:18,397 --> 01:35:21,912
He kept his back turned
until I said "Ready"...

1520
01:35:22,197 --> 01:35:24,791
...and threw him
the piece of my clothing.

1521
01:35:26,437 --> 01:35:28,348
But what did he do with it?

1522
01:35:28,757 --> 01:35:31,112
I don't know.
I looked the other way.

1523
01:35:31,877 --> 01:35:35,267
- And that experience, you call that a...?
- A love experience?

1524
01:35:35,437 --> 01:35:36,836
Yes, I do, Mr. Shannon.

1525
01:35:37,237 --> 01:35:40,991
That sad little, dirty little episode,
you call it a...

1526
01:35:41,157 --> 01:35:45,150
Sad, it certainly was for the poor little
man. But why do you call it dirty?

1527
01:35:47,517 --> 01:35:50,714
You mean
you weren't disgusted by it?

1528
01:35:50,877 --> 01:35:53,914
Nothing human disgusts me,
Mr. Shannon.

1529
01:35:54,077 --> 01:35:57,353
Unless it's unkind or violent.

1530
01:35:58,517 --> 01:36:00,747
And I told you how...

1531
01:36:00,997 --> 01:36:02,715
How gentle he was.

1532
01:36:03,597 --> 01:36:06,634
Apologetic, shy.

1533
01:36:06,917 --> 01:36:09,033
And really very...

1534
01:36:09,637 --> 01:36:10,990
...well...

1535
01:36:11,757 --> 01:36:13,748
...delicate about it.

1536
01:36:15,997 --> 01:36:21,310
However, I do grant you
that it was rather on the fantastic level.

1537
01:36:22,237 --> 01:36:23,465
What are you doing?

1538
01:36:23,637 --> 01:36:25,150
Untying you.

1539
01:36:25,317 --> 01:36:27,228
Why? Why now?

1540
01:36:27,517 --> 01:36:32,671
I think the spook is exorcised,
Mr. Shannon. You've ceased to struggle.

1541
01:36:32,837 --> 01:36:37,115
And acceptance of life is surely
the first requisite for living it.

1542
01:36:45,277 --> 01:36:49,350
Who was the person you told Maxine
you'd helped through a crackup like this?

1543
01:36:50,317 --> 01:36:51,875
Oh, that.

1544
01:36:53,477 --> 01:36:55,149
Myself.

1545
01:36:56,357 --> 01:36:58,154
Oh. Oh, you?

1546
01:36:58,597 --> 01:37:00,235
Oh, yes.

1547
01:37:00,837 --> 01:37:03,715
I had a spook like yours once.

1548
01:37:03,957 --> 01:37:06,630
I just had a different name for him.

1549
01:37:07,037 --> 01:37:10,109
I used to call him the "blue devil."

1550
01:37:10,277 --> 01:37:15,226
- And we had quite a contest between us.
- Which you...

1551
01:37:15,397 --> 01:37:16,955
Which you won.

1552
01:37:17,477 --> 01:37:19,991
I couldn't afford to lose.

1553
01:37:20,437 --> 01:37:24,032
How did you...? How did you beat
this blue devil of yours?

1554
01:37:24,397 --> 01:37:26,513
I showed him I could endure him.

1555
01:37:26,677 --> 01:37:29,953
- And made him respect my endurance.
- How?

1556
01:37:30,637 --> 01:37:32,867
Just by enduring.

1557
01:37:33,037 --> 01:37:36,313
Endurance is something that spooks
and blue devils respect.

1558
01:37:36,477 --> 01:37:38,707
And they respect all the tricks...

1559
01:37:38,877 --> 01:37:42,631
...that panicky people use to outwit
and outlast their panic.

1560
01:37:42,797 --> 01:37:45,914
Like taking a few deep,
deep breaths?

1561
01:37:46,077 --> 01:37:48,193
Or rum-cocos.

1562
01:37:48,677 --> 01:37:52,033
Or even beach boys.

1563
01:37:52,317 --> 01:37:55,707
Anything. Everything we do
to give them the slip.

1564
01:37:55,877 --> 01:37:58,755
So keep on going.

1565
01:37:58,917 --> 01:38:00,350
To where?

1566
01:38:02,277 --> 01:38:04,837
To somewhere like this, perhaps.

1567
01:38:05,957 --> 01:38:09,472
After long and difficult travels...

1568
01:38:09,637 --> 01:38:13,789
...the subterranean travels
that the spooked and bedeviled take...

1569
01:38:13,957 --> 01:38:18,587
...through the unlighted sides of
their own natures until finally...

1570
01:38:18,757 --> 01:38:21,146
...they see a faint gray light.

1571
01:38:21,317 --> 01:38:23,877
And keep climbing towards it.

1572
01:38:24,277 --> 01:38:26,472
Are you still following
that faint gray light?

1573
01:38:26,637 --> 01:38:29,947
Any light is a good light to see by
at the end of a long, dark tunnel...

1574
01:38:30,117 --> 01:38:32,677
...that you thought would be
never-ending.

1575
01:38:32,837 --> 01:38:36,989
That only God or death
could put a stop to.

1576
01:38:37,157 --> 01:38:39,352
Especially when you...

1577
01:38:40,237 --> 01:38:44,230
Since I was
far from sure about God.

1578
01:38:44,437 --> 01:38:46,473
Are you still unsure about him?

1579
01:38:47,837 --> 01:38:50,635
Not as unsure as I was.

1580
01:38:55,357 --> 01:38:57,427
He's still struggling.

1581
01:38:59,397 --> 01:39:02,753
Yes. He's got to the end of his rope.

1582
01:39:02,917 --> 01:39:04,669
And any further, he cannot get.

1583
01:39:04,837 --> 01:39:09,274
Can you honestly tell me that he is not
able to feel pain and panic?

1584
01:39:09,437 --> 01:39:13,476
- You mean, he's one of God's creatures?
- Yes, if you want to put it that way.

1585
01:39:14,357 --> 01:39:17,713
Mr. Shannon, cut him loose.

1586
01:39:20,117 --> 01:39:21,550
All right.

1587
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:26,155
We'll play God tonight, like kids play
houses with old broken crates and boxes.

1588
01:39:26,317 --> 01:39:29,070
We'll cut the lizard loose
so that he can go back to his bushes.

1589
01:39:29,237 --> 01:39:32,866
Because God won't do it
and we are playing God here tonight.

1590
01:39:39,357 --> 01:39:40,915
Mr. Shannon.

1591
01:39:50,557 --> 01:39:51,910
I knew you'd do that.

1592
01:40:03,637 --> 01:40:06,151
What the hell are you doing, Shannon?

1593
01:40:10,597 --> 01:40:14,112
I just cut loose one of God's creatures
at the end of his rope.

1594
01:40:15,077 --> 01:40:16,669
What for?

1595
01:40:16,997 --> 01:40:19,716
So that one of God's creatures
could be free from panic...

1596
01:40:19,877 --> 01:40:23,950
...and scamper home safe and free.
A little act of grace, Maxine.

1597
01:40:24,917 --> 01:40:27,192
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!
Where are you?

1598
01:40:27,357 --> 01:40:30,110
Here, Grandfather.
Right here.

1599
01:40:30,277 --> 01:40:35,305
It finished! Quick, before I forget it,
pencil and paper. Hurry, please!

1600
01:40:42,117 --> 01:40:45,075
- Ready?
- Yes. All ready, Grandfather.

1601
01:40:46,757 --> 01:40:50,432
<i>How calmly does the olive branch</i>

1602
01:40:51,397 --> 01:40:54,753
<i>Observe the sky begin to blanch</i>

1603
01:40:55,397 --> 01:40:58,389
<i>Without a cry, without a prayer</i>

1604
01:40:58,997 --> 01:41:01,955
<i>With no betrayal of despair</i>

1605
01:41:02,957 --> 01:41:07,712
<i>Some time while night obscures the tree</i>

1606
01:41:08,237 --> 01:41:11,468
<i>The zenith of its life will be</i>

1607
01:41:11,637 --> 01:41:14,310
<i>Gone past forever</i>

1608
01:41:15,077 --> 01:41:17,227
<i>And from thence</i>

1609
01:41:17,837 --> 01:41:21,625
<i>A second history will commence</i>

1610
01:41:22,557 --> 01:41:25,708
<i>A chronicle no longer gold</i>

1611
01:41:26,077 --> 01:41:29,626
<i>A bargaining with mist and mold</i>

1612
01:41:30,277 --> 01:41:33,792
<i>And finally, the broken stem</i>

1613
01:41:34,357 --> 01:41:36,109
<i>The plummeting to earth</i>

1614
01:41:36,837 --> 01:41:40,386
<i>And then, an intercourse</i>

1615
01:41:40,557 --> 01:41:45,267
<i>Not well designed for beings</i>
<i>Of a golden kind</i>

1616
01:41:45,637 --> 01:41:48,071
<i>Whose native green must arch above</i>

1617
01:41:48,237 --> 01:41:52,071
<i>The earth's obscene, corrupting love</i>

1618
01:41:53,077 --> 01:41:56,433
<i>And still the ripe fruit and the branch</i>

1619
01:41:56,597 --> 01:42:00,306
<i>Observe the sky begin to blanch</i>

1620
01:42:01,037 --> 01:42:03,995
<i>Without a cry, without a prayer</i>

1621
01:42:04,997 --> 01:42:08,307
<i>With no betrayal of despair</i>

1622
01:42:09,397 --> 01:42:11,433
<i>Oh, courage</i>

1623
01:42:12,357 --> 01:42:16,555
<i>Could you not as well</i>
<i>Select a second place to dwell</i>

1624
01:42:17,997 --> 01:42:21,069
<i>Not only in that golden tree</i>

1625
01:42:22,117 --> 01:42:25,951
<i>But in the frightened heart of me?</i>

1626
01:42:28,317 --> 01:42:30,353
Have you got that, Hannah?

1627
01:42:31,237 --> 01:42:33,114
Yes, Grandfather.

1628
01:42:33,277 --> 01:42:36,269
- All of it?
- Every word.

1629
01:42:37,157 --> 01:42:40,194
- And it's finished?
- Yes.

1630
01:42:40,357 --> 01:42:44,873
- Finally finished?
- Yes, finally finished.

1631
01:42:45,357 --> 01:42:46,949
And it's good.

1632
01:42:47,717 --> 01:42:49,389
Beautiful.

1633
01:42:50,157 --> 01:42:54,150
- Is it good?
- Beautiful, Grandfather.

1634
01:42:55,477 --> 01:42:58,753
Oh, Grandfather, I'm so happy for you.

1635
01:42:59,117 --> 01:43:02,234
Thank you for writing
such a lovely poem.

1636
01:43:02,597 --> 01:43:04,792
It was worth the long wait.

1637
01:43:07,117 --> 01:43:09,950
Can you sleep a little now?

1638
01:43:10,437 --> 01:43:12,553
I'll fetch your shawl.

1639
01:43:13,317 --> 01:43:15,706
I'd like to pray now.

1640
01:43:44,357 --> 01:43:45,949
Oh, God.

1641
01:43:48,117 --> 01:43:51,393
Please can't we stop now?

1642
01:44:23,357 --> 01:44:25,154
He won't need the shawl.

1643
01:44:26,077 --> 01:44:29,592
God has played God
and set him free.

1644
01:44:56,517 --> 01:44:57,996
<i>Oh, courage</i>

1645
01:44:58,797 --> 01:45:00,435
<i>Could you not as well</i>

1646
01:45:00,597 --> 01:45:03,191
<i>Have found a second place to dwell</i>

1647
01:45:04,517 --> 01:45:06,473
<i>Not only in that golden tree</i>

1648
01:45:07,917 --> 01:45:11,512
<i>But in the frightened heart of me?</i>

1649
01:45:49,677 --> 01:45:51,076
Miss Jelkes.

1650
01:45:51,517 --> 01:45:54,429
What are you doing? You're not
gonna leave us today, are you?

1651
01:45:54,597 --> 01:45:57,794
There's no reason to delay.
Everything has been done.

1652
01:45:57,957 --> 01:46:00,517
Thanks to your kindness
and Mrs. Faulk's...

1653
01:46:00,677 --> 01:46:03,714
...Dr. Lopez and all the good people
in the village.

1654
01:46:09,437 --> 01:46:12,827
I know now why he insisted
we go on with this trip.

1655
01:46:12,997 --> 01:46:15,227
He knew it was the end.
And he wanted it to come...

1656
01:46:15,397 --> 01:46:18,275
...where he could be buried
peacefully on a green hilltop...

1657
01:46:18,437 --> 01:46:21,554
...within sight and sound of the sea,
his "cradle of life."

1658
01:46:22,437 --> 01:46:25,190
- You're going on, are you?
- Yes, naturally.

1659
01:46:25,357 --> 01:46:27,712
- Where?
- Well, first I shall go into town...

1660
01:46:27,877 --> 01:46:29,276
...and try my luck in the plaza.

1661
01:46:29,437 --> 01:46:31,075
What luck do you expect in the plaza?

1662
01:46:31,237 --> 01:46:35,276
Do you expect the old lady selling tacos
to buy your sketches like hotcakes?

1663
01:46:35,437 --> 01:46:39,191
There'll be some tourists, and I shall give
them what is known as the "hard sell."

1664
01:46:39,357 --> 01:46:42,076
Miss Jelkes, you're not operating
on the realistic level.

1665
01:46:42,237 --> 01:46:44,956
Yes, I am. We are operating
on a realistic level...

1666
01:46:45,117 --> 01:46:47,392
...when we are doing the things
that have to be done.

1667
01:46:47,557 --> 01:46:52,472
But you can't go on alone. Think of how
it will feel after so many years.

1668
01:46:52,997 --> 01:46:55,557
I shall know how it feels when I feel it.

1669
01:46:56,237 --> 01:46:58,432
Miss Jelkes, I wonder...

1670
01:46:59,277 --> 01:47:01,108
Yes. What do you wonder?

1671
01:47:01,477 --> 01:47:03,388
Well, I was wondering...

1672
01:47:03,557 --> 01:47:07,709
...if it was possible for us
to travel together.

1673
01:47:07,877 --> 01:47:10,266
I mean, travel together.

1674
01:47:10,997 --> 01:47:12,669
Do you really think we could?

1675
01:47:12,837 --> 01:47:17,467
I don't see why not,
both of us sort of at loose ends.

1676
01:47:18,197 --> 01:47:24,352
I feel sure the impracticality of it
would be all too clear to you later.

1677
01:47:24,717 --> 01:47:28,027
I think it would only prove awkward
and embarrassing for both of us.

1678
01:47:28,197 --> 01:47:30,233
- Miss Jelkes...
- I wonder if Mrs. Faulk is about?

1679
01:47:30,397 --> 01:47:33,036
- I would like to thank her.
- Yeah.

1680
01:47:33,757 --> 01:47:37,386
She's about.
And about to make an announcement.

1681
01:47:37,557 --> 01:47:39,434
Sit down, you two.

1682
01:47:39,717 --> 01:47:41,230
Sit down.

1683
01:47:46,997 --> 01:47:49,875
I got a proposition to make,
a business proposition.

1684
01:47:50,037 --> 01:47:52,028
You know, Miss Jelkes, honey,
you impress me.

1685
01:47:52,277 --> 01:47:55,235
Very favorably. The way
you dished up that fish and all.

1686
01:47:55,397 --> 01:47:59,276
So favorably, in fact, that I'm prepared
to make you the following proposition.

1687
01:47:59,997 --> 01:48:01,794
What proposition, Mrs. Faulk?

1688
01:48:02,717 --> 01:48:04,389
I want a Coke.

1689
01:48:07,397 --> 01:48:09,353
Beer. Beer!

1690
01:48:14,597 --> 01:48:17,714
My proposition is this:
That you take over here.

1691
01:48:18,477 --> 01:48:21,389
The place furnishes a living
plus a neat little profit.

1692
01:48:21,837 --> 01:48:26,433
I take in about 4000 a year,
after expenses.

1693
01:48:26,597 --> 01:48:28,155
Four thousand dollars.

1694
01:48:28,317 --> 01:48:30,751
It wouldn't surprise me
if you couldn't do even better...

1695
01:48:30,917 --> 01:48:34,512
...provided Shannon there
didn't drink up your share of the profits.

1696
01:48:35,637 --> 01:48:36,990
Well, that's the deal.

1697
01:48:37,477 --> 01:48:39,388
We split the profits fifty-fifty.

1698
01:48:39,557 --> 01:48:42,276
Even-steven.
Share and share alike.

1699
01:48:42,437 --> 01:48:44,348
Does that make any sense to you?

1700
01:48:45,477 --> 01:48:48,037
Maxine. Are you all right?

1701
01:48:48,277 --> 01:48:50,950
Of course I'm all right.
What do you mean, am I all right?

1702
01:48:51,117 --> 01:48:55,349
My only reason for including you on this
deal is a man's presence is required.

1703
01:48:55,517 --> 01:48:56,745
There's gotta be a man.

1704
01:48:56,917 --> 01:49:00,114
That's one of the basic principles
of hotel administration.

1705
01:49:00,277 --> 01:49:03,235
There's gotta be a man to make
the place attractive to the ladies.

1706
01:49:03,397 --> 01:49:05,513
Wives of the men that go fishing.

1707
01:49:05,877 --> 01:49:08,675
Matter of fact, my offer is contingent
on the presence of a man.

1708
01:49:08,837 --> 01:49:11,954
- There's no deal unless Shannon stays.
- What about you, Mrs. Faulk?

1709
01:49:12,117 --> 01:49:14,426
Me? I'm fed up with this place.

1710
01:49:14,597 --> 01:49:17,236
Fed up to the teeth, into the gums
and the jawbone.

1711
01:49:17,397 --> 01:49:19,706
- Jungle rot's set in.
- Where are you going?

1712
01:49:19,877 --> 01:49:22,914
Well, I'm not going on any
of your Blake Tours, that's for sure!

1713
01:49:23,077 --> 01:49:24,669
I'm heading north.

1714
01:49:25,237 --> 01:49:27,512
El Paso, maybe. Yeah, I like El Paso.

1715
01:49:28,437 --> 01:49:30,268
Air-conditioned cocktail lounges.

1716
01:49:30,437 --> 01:49:34,669
Fifteen-to-one martinis and mirrors that
don't scare you when they look at you!

1717
01:49:34,917 --> 01:49:38,956
I'm a young woman. Attractive, too,
if I can get to a decent beauty parlor.

1718
01:49:39,117 --> 01:49:42,632
Don't you worry about the widow Faulk.
She'll have a ball!

1719
01:49:46,157 --> 01:49:49,069
- Fantastic.
- Yes, Mr. Shannon.

1720
01:49:49,237 --> 01:49:50,989
Fantastic is what it is.

1721
01:49:51,557 --> 01:49:55,027
You were building your nest
and you didn't even know it.

1722
01:49:55,477 --> 01:49:57,115
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1723
01:49:57,277 --> 01:50:00,349
- At least let me drive you into town.
- No, thank you, I prefer to walk.

1724
01:50:00,517 --> 01:50:04,635
What you could do for me, though,
is have my luggage sent in after me.

1725
01:50:04,837 --> 01:50:07,112
Oh, I almost forgot.

1726
01:50:07,277 --> 01:50:11,873
I found this in the pocket of my smock
when I was packing this morning.

1727
01:50:12,037 --> 01:50:14,471
Yes, I want you to have it.

1728
01:50:14,637 --> 01:50:16,593
I couldn't possibly accept,
Mr. Shannon.

1729
01:50:16,757 --> 01:50:20,033
No, take it, please. Hock it.
It'll pay your way back to the States.

1730
01:50:20,197 --> 01:50:21,471
That's a real amethyst...

1731
01:50:21,637 --> 01:50:25,107
...so don't let the local loan shark
give you less than 1800 pesos for it.

1732
01:50:25,277 --> 01:50:28,189
Its value has been well-established
over the years.

1733
01:50:29,317 --> 01:50:31,069
Very well, Mr. Shannon.

1734
01:50:31,237 --> 01:50:34,274
I'll send the pawn ticket
back to you so that you can redeem it.

1735
01:51:23,757 --> 01:51:26,430
- What are you doing, Maxine?
- Packing.

1736
01:51:31,277 --> 01:51:32,756
Go on, fall apart.

1737
01:51:33,157 --> 01:51:36,388
Everything's falling apart,
including you and Shannon!

1738
01:51:36,677 --> 01:51:39,555
Complimentary rum-coco.
It's a speciality of the Costa Verde.

1739
01:51:39,717 --> 01:51:43,710
I don't want a rum-coco. If I wanted
a rum-coco, I'd make a rum-coco.

1740
01:51:45,957 --> 01:51:49,950
She's gone, Maxine.
The poem's finished.

1741
01:51:51,397 --> 01:51:54,434
You mean she's not gonna
take me up on my proposition?

1742
01:51:55,197 --> 01:51:57,631
Oh, she's not.

1743
01:51:58,597 --> 01:51:59,916
I am.

1744
01:52:00,837 --> 01:52:02,316
That is, if you...

1745
01:52:02,757 --> 01:52:05,988
If you really need
a man around here.

1746
01:52:30,597 --> 01:52:35,273
It's not hot yet, Shannon.
Why don't we go down to the beach.

1747
01:52:35,957 --> 01:52:37,470
Well, I can...

1748
01:52:37,877 --> 01:52:41,153
I can get down the hill, Maxine,
but I'm not too sure about getting...

1749
01:52:41,317 --> 01:52:42,796
...back up.

1750
01:52:43,477 --> 01:52:48,153
I'll get you back up, baby.
I'll always get you back up.
