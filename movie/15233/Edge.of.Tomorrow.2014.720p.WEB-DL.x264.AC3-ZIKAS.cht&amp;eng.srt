Okay, so all I have to do is wait to have these visions,

你知道就算我找到了匙
Well, let's just say we find keys, you know?

就算_走了那架直升C
Get that helicopter started.

984

我既]有鸺  也]有
We don't have our jackets or ammunition.

985
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:33,588
R上就要天黑了
And it's gonna be dark in a few hours.

986
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,760
我不如回到才那r舍
Might be better just going back to the farmhouse,

987
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:43,056
找c什N有用的，在那Y^一夜
seeing what we could salvage. You know, spend the night there.

早上再回@
Come back here in the morning.

蜷s在篝火旁，再_上一瓶好酒
And curl up by the fire and open a bottle of wine?

我X得我是重置
We should just reset.

991

- @是死路一l - 嘿，等，只是
- It's a dead end. - Hey, hold... just...

992
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:56,439
如果你J槎]差的
If it's all the same to you,

993
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:59,281
我累了，我很痛苦，我可重新再硪淮
I'm tired, I'm in pain. I'd rather just start fresh.

994
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:01,950
先休息一下 咖啡煮好了
I'll tell you what, take a few minutes. Coffee's ready.

995
01:06:02,534 --> 01:06:04,454
我去找找匙，能找到
I'll look around for the keys, that's productive.

996

十分
Ten minutes.

997
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:06,121

好
Fine.

1000
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:14,629
你居然能找到咖啡
I can't believe you found coffee.

1001
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:18,007
xx
Thank you.

1002
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,720

How many times?

1010
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:09,434
匙在哪
Where are the keys?

1011
01:07:10,977 --> 01:07:12,457
- 匙到底在哪 - 好
- Where are the Goddamn keys? - Okay.

1012
01:07:15,774 --> 01:07:17,484
你_的，Π
You can fly it, can't you?

1013
01:07:17,651 --> 01:07:18,859
不…
No. Well... yes.

1014
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:21,820
我只起w，降落]W
I mean, I can take off, I'm still working on my landing.

1015
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:23,782
那在@e质颤N？直在浪Mrg
What are we still doing here? You're wasting time!

1016

l右擎你就死
You start that engine, you die!

你最多只能活到@
This is as far as you go.

1019

o我做什N
No matter what I do.

1020
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:36,628
你都死在@e
This is as far as you ever make it.

1021
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:47,806
20a以外藏著一「MB」(Mimics)
There's a Mimic buried twenty yards away.

1022
01:07:48,306 --> 01:07:50,183
你l右擎，它就攻裟
It attacks when you start the engine.

1023
01:07:51,726 --> 01:07:53,937
拿上你的武器上直升C，P奇
Get your weapon and get in the helicopter, Cage.

1024
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:56,064
回到那遇到更多
There's more than a field battle there.

1025
01:07:58,692 --> 01:08:00,151
我z只有一能回去
Only one of us ever makes it.

Get in.

1027
01:08:01,069 --> 01:08:02,455
唯一]有^的方案就是
The only thing we haven't tried is a version where

1028
01:08:02,467 --> 01:08:04,227
你回去，回到r舍去
you walk away, just go back to the farmhouse.

1029
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:07,325
有吃的，你在@旱戎我回
There's food, you wait there until I get back.

1030
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,451

You'll be safe.

1031
01:08:08,577 --> 01:08:10,763
我是士兵，我是自的
I'm a soldier, I volunteered.

1032
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:11,788
我不_
I'm not walking away.

1033
01:08:11,913 --> 01:08:13,039
那你死的
You die here!

1034
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:14,456
死在@
Right here!

1035
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:17,794
我救不了你
I...can't save you.

1036
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,672
而之後我若去⒘甩
And if I go on and kill the Omega.

1037
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:21,840
你的死
You're dead.

1038
01:08:22,382 --> 01:08:23,382
成榧榷ㄊ
Forever.

1039
01:08:23,508 --> 01:08:25,385
我怎N佑心屈N重要
Why does it matter what happens to me?

1040
01:08:29,389 --> 01:08:32,434
我希望]^你
I wish I didn't know you.

1041
01:08:34,978 --> 01:08:35,978
可是]k法
But I do.

1042
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:09,030
我的中g名…
My middle name...

1043
01:10:10,282 --> 01:10:11,283
是_斯
is Rose.

1044
01:10:31,845 --> 01:10:33,471
站起  U物
On your feet, maggot!

1045
01:10:44,983 --> 01:10:46,943
好消息是你有希望  二等兵
Looks there's hope for your, Private.

1046
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:49,362
那就是⒓舆@龉s的痿Y
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

1047
01:10:50,197 --> 01:10:51,573
是ゴ蟮木仁乐
Battle is the great redeemer.

1048
01:10:51,823 --> 01:10:54,303
也是一大熔t  能N出真正的英雄
The fire and crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.

1049
01:10:54,327 --> 01:10:55,328
The one place...

1050
01:11:06,922 --> 01:11:07,922
什N事
Yes?

1051
01:11:09,007 --> 01:11:10,634
l你跟我f了
Who said you could talk to me?

1052
01:11:14,596 --> 01:11:16,431
y道我有|西幔渴勘
Do I have something on my face, soldier?

1053
01:11:20,143 --> 01:11:21,686
很抱歉打_你了
I'm sorry to disturb you, Sergeant.

1054
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:46,687
好了，上隽耍我得穿得正式c
Alright, man. Let's get this show on the road. I gotta suite up.

1055
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:50,674
你的^盔呢
Where's your helmet?

1056
01:11:52,384 --> 01:11:53,760
我不打算戴
I'm not gonna wear one.

1057
01:11:54,219 --> 01:11:55,470
很不方便
It's a distraction.

1058
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:58,890
你喝酒了吧
Have you been drinking?

1059
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:01,577
再o我三556的簧A
I need three more clips of five-five-six,

1060
01:12:01,601 --> 01:12:04,062
八w手雷，有一K池
eight grenades and an extra battery.

1061
01:12:08,233 --> 01:12:09,233
快c
Get it!

1062
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,199
嘿
Oy!

1063
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,201
同W
Oy, mate!

1064
01:12:19,327 --> 01:12:21,247
你的衣服好像不太
I think there's something wrong with your suite!

1065
01:12:22,622 --> 01:12:23,957
Y面b的是死人
There's a dead guy in it.

1066
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:26,083
耶！
Yeah!

1067
01:12:26,334 --> 01:12:26,918
韬簦∥成功了
Wooh-hoo! We made it!

1068
01:12:26,919 --> 01:12:29,254
感xn天，我成功了！耶
Thank God, we made it! Yeah...!

1069
01:14:31,877 --> 01:14:32,878
了Y呀！
Finish it!

1070
01:15:27,516 --> 01:15:29,100
它不在那
It isn't there.

1071
01:15:29,309 --> 01:15:30,829
Ω不在那？
What do you mean the Omega isn't there?

1072
01:15:30,853 --> 01:15:32,205
我猜它砭]在那
My guess is it never was.

1073
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:33,563
它知道我要
They knew we were coming.

1074
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:36,107
它伏袅宋，幻象就是陷阱
They ambushed us. The visions were a trap.

1075
01:15:37,651 --> 01:15:40,153
就像瑞塔在凡登看到的幻象一
Just like Rita's visions were a trap at Verdun.

1076
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:43,466
它可以⑽业]
It could have killed me, but it didn't.

1077
01:15:43,823 --> 01:15:44,823
它想要我的血
It's after my blood.

1078
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,493
那它知道你是l了
So they know who you are, they...

1079
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,200
它想恢湍芰
They want their power back.

1080
01:15:49,201 --> 01:15:50,921
就算@次]成，早晚也
And they're gonna get it one way or another,

1081
01:15:50,945 --> 01:15:52,784
除非我能找到Ω
unless we find the Omega.

1082
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:55,583
]e的k法了，我完了
There... there isn't any other way, we're finished!

1083
01:15:55,607 --> 01:15:56,837
不，我]完
No, we're not finished.

1084
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,060
那]用，我o法它工作
It doesn't work. I can't get it to work...

1085
01:15:59,084 --> 01:16:00,495
你在白m做^一原型
You built a prototype at Whitehall.

1086
01:16:00,507 --> 01:16:02,427
]e，托你的福，我榇G了工作
Yes! And I got fired for it, thank you very much.

1087
01:16:03,176 --> 01:16:04,844
- @到底是什N|西 - @是Dl器
- What is this thing, anyway? - It's a transponder.

1088
01:16:04,845 --> 01:16:06,647
把它放到αw
You stick it into the Alpha and it taps into

1089
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:08,472
它跟Ω之ga生信息波段
the wavelength connecting it to the Omega.

1090
01:16:08,473 --> 01:16:09,975
@就是它的工作原理
That's the idea anyway.

1091
01:16:10,308 --> 01:16:13,186
但我]法它工作，F有的O涓本不行
But I can't get it to work, not with the equipment I have on hand.

1092
01:16:15,814 --> 01:16:17,124
哪河心阈枰的O
How do we get you what you need?

1093
01:16:17,148 --> 01:16:18,482
才她不是f了
Well, that's the thing. I mean...

1094
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:21,486
在白mY的那，差不多都可以M行y了
when I was at Whitehall I built one, I was even ready to test it,

1095
01:16:21,736 --> 01:16:23,256
我跟主管R笠葬
but when I told my superiors about it,

1096
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,280
就把工作G了
well I lost my job.

1097
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:25,866
都X得他了
They thought he was crazy.

1098
01:16:26,241 --> 01:16:27,868
所以我需要去趟白m
So all we need to do is go to Whitehall.

1099
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:30,871
等到接近大T，你就被捕的
He'd be arrested ten feet from the front doors.

1100
01:16:30,996 --> 01:16:32,622
精神病院、解剖，得
Psyche ward dissection, remember?

1101
01:16:33,748 --> 01:16:35,588
嘿、嘿、嘿！你忘了一件事
Hey, hey, hey! Aren't you forgetting something?

1102
01:16:35,612 --> 01:16:37,919
Dl器要在活的α身上才管用
The transponder requires a live Alpha to make it work.

1103
01:16:38,044 --> 01:16:39,379
我不需要
We don't need one.

1104
01:16:40,046 --> 01:16:41,631
我有更好的x
We got the next best thing.

1105
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:47,846
等中代表F出r要加快_步
When the Chinese delegation comes out, you pick up the pace.

1106
01:16:50,182 --> 01:16:52,851
那戴S袖章的砘锩看味寄苷J出你
There's a guy with a yellow arm band that always recognizes you.

1107
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:55,604
所以你要低著^，在我右走
So just keep your head down and stay to my right.

1108
01:17:02,402 --> 01:17:03,987
值貌诲e
Nicely done.

1109
01:17:07,008 --> 01:17:07,508
三
Three.

1110
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:08,241
二
Two.

1111
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,151
一
One.

1112
01:17:09,275 --> 01:17:10,275
走
Go.

1113
01:17:23,965 --> 01:17:24,965
D身
Turn.

1114
01:17:25,509 --> 01:17:27,594
好的，^m走，眼睛往前看
Okay, keep walking. Just go straight ahead.

1115
01:17:29,304 --> 01:17:30,722
_e森
Robinson

1116
01:17:31,431 --> 01:17:33,117
我f^了e打_我
I've asked not to be disturbed.

1117
