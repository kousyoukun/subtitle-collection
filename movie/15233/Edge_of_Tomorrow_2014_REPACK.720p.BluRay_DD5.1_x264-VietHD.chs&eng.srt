00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,350
听我说  这里正在发生
Take it  I'll tell you what  we're having an earth

00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,400
美国威秀影片公司联合出品

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,400
明日边缘

5
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,480
可以开始了
start talking.

6
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,510
不知道能不能播出去
I'm not sure if we're even on the air.

7
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,530
应该说
Uh  this is uh

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,330
这是一系列爆炸
a series of explosions

9
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,520
这是一起严重的事件
This is a major incident

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,120
这场严重的突发事件
The emergency is a major incident

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,670
撞击产生爆炸的瞬间
That's a meteor hit.

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,790
一场严重的入侵事件
It does now appear to be a major attack

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,390
自从五年前降落在汉堡市境外
Since they landed outside Hamburg five years ago

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,470
它们已经横扫了整个欧洲大陆
they have steadily advanced across Europe.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,280
我们已经损失了几百万人
We've suffered millions of casualties and yet

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,780
各国政府要员目前已经开始撤离了
The evacuation of key government officials continuing

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,370
很显然我们无力阻止它们
Nothing we have done has been able to stop their advance

18
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,030
在人员方面 欧洲
Human costs the Europeans

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,240
已经付出了高昂的代价  它们有模仿能力
have paid the highest, They appear to mimic

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,370
甚至超越我们的的各种行为
and even anticipate our actions

21
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,500
如果不能在法国打败它们
We could not defeat them in France

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,500
就得在伦敦街头跟他们较量
we'll be fighting them in the streets of London

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,070
然后是纽约  东京
then New York, then Tokyo.

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,440
这是一场生死之战
All of humanity is at stake.

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,420
五年后  我们终于取得了胜利
After five years, we finally have a victory.

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,880
这是从凡尔登传回的画面
These pictures are just in from Verdun.

27
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,810
值得称道的是这次胜利伤亡少  损害低
And the coalition victory was how low casualties were

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,470
应该说这的确是一场了不起的胜利
We have seen a stunning victory here today.

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,350
联合防御军
The United Defense Force

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,640
你怎么才能让人们相信
How do you convince people

31
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,750
这场战争我们必胜
that this is a fight that can be won?

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,620
这是外星人对全球的侵略战争
This is an alien invasion and a global war.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,270
有了新型战甲技术和很少的训练
With the new jack in technology and limited amount of training

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,400
我们就能创造出超级战士
we've been able to create super soldiers.

35
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,950
瑞塔·沃塔斯基 就是凡尔登的天使
Look at Rita Vrataski   The Angel of Verdun

36
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,110
无论从速度还是力量上来看
They're calling her

37
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,830
她都可以说是
The Angel of Verdun

38
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,750
她被看成是这场战争的新希望
You can see that's the new hope for this war

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,640
有了新型战甲技术和很少的训练
With the new jack in technology and limited amount of training

40
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,800
瑞塔·沃塔斯基一天就可以杀掉
Rita Vrataski was able to kill hundreds of Mimics

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,950
几百个模仿者外星人
She was able to kill hundreds of Mimics on only her first day in combat.

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,520
如果全军都是这样的战士
Imagine any army of Rita Vrataski's.

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,360
我们在英吉利海峡抵挡住它们
We're managing to hold them back at the English Channel

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,240
问题是能挡多久  这种观点过于轻率
but for how long? It is a dangerous task

45
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,040
难免人们对此持怀疑态度
and it's easy to understand why people are so suspicious about this

46
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,350
超过70个国家加入了联合防御部队
Over seventy nations are joining the United Defense Force

47
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,310
以期将其击退  一劳永逸
which hopes to push them back once and for all.

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,720
我们控制住了局面
We've got 'em contained

49
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,040
有了这项新技术  绝对能打败它们
and with this new technology   we're gonna defeat 'em.

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,130
歼灭计划将会成为
Operation Downfall is going to be the largest

51
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,120
人类历史上规模最大的机甲战斗
mechanized invasion in the history of mankind.

52
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,580
我们一定会赢
We will be victorious.

53
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,830
因为我们会...
We fight.

54
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,130
和他们抗争到底
That's what we do.

55
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,840
(伦敦)
LONDON

56
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,310
我是威廉·凯奇少校
Major William Cage.

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,640
美国军方媒体的
United Stated military.

58
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,000
欢迎您来伦敦  少校
Welcome to London   Major.

59
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,060
(联合防御部队总部)
UNITED DEFENSE FORCE HEADQUARTERS

60
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,150
将军可以见你了
The General will see you now.

61
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,660
谢谢
Thank you.

62
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,700
行动计划是这样的
Operation Downfall

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,200
整个联合防御部队  从法国
the entire might of the UDF invading from France

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,440
地中海  斯勘的纳维亚直入
the Mediterranean   Scandinavia

65
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,110
缓解东部前线的压力
relieving pressure in the Eastern front and allowing

66
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,330
好让俄国和中国部队把敌人赶回去
the Russians and Chinese to push the enemy back

67
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,070
而全军在中部集合后
and we all meet in the middle

68
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,250
再一路把"拟态"(Mimics)斩尽杀绝
exterminating this Mimic scourge along the way.

69
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,620
很多优秀的战士明天会战死   少校
A lot of good soldiers are going to die tomorrow   Major

70
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,270
等硝烟散去...裹尸袋被送回来的时候
and when the smoke clears and the body bags start coming home

71
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,150
就会需要有个人来背黑锅
people tend to look for someone to blame

72
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,510
比如说   我
someone like me.

73
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,720
希望能有人为我说句公道话
Ideally I'd prefer a different scenario.

74
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,510
请吧
Please.

75
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,350
也许能写本畅销的回忆录
A best selling memoir perhaps?

76
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,600
或者从此走上政坛
Maybe a career in politics?

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,690
对我来说  马上想到的有...
Off the top of my head   I would go with the

78
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,530
"胸怀大志"
"The Sense of Manifest Destiny."

79
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,030
"白手起家却又平步青云"
"Rags to Riches: Rags Rise Through The Ranks."

80
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,740
"天生的领导者"
"Born to Deliver." You see people.

81
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,890
人们就喜欢听这类话题
Well   they'd love that sort of thing.

82
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,090
你理解错了  少校
You misunderstand   Major.

83
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,870
我不是请你推销我  而是推销这场反击战
I didn't ask you here to sell me   I want you to sell the invasion.

84
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,390
好的
Okay.

85
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,930
船一小时后出发
You ship out to the coast in one hour.

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,630
你的拍摄团队已经在等你了
Your comrade is standing by.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,750
你们之后会去展开第一波攻击的海滩上
You'll be on the beach with the first wave.

88
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,690
抱歉...我问一下
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,800
第一波攻击将在海滩展开
The first wave   the beach?

90
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,470
也就是说海滩将成为前线
You mean  The front?

91
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,470
法国
France.

92
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,260
卫星显示海岸线上有极少量的敌人
Satellite show minimum enemy movement down the coast.

93
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,890
在做些许的抵抗
Little resistance.

94
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,760
到时应该会很精彩刺激
It'd be exciting

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,880
刺激到可以向子孙们说故事
something to tell your grandchildren.

96
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,480
很感激你对我的信心  将军
Well   I appreciate the confidence   General.

97
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,270
但我、我就是为了回避这种事情才只做现在这工作
I do  I do this to avoid doing that.

98
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,360
我、我、我在大学曾经是备役军官
I I  I was an ROTC in college

99
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,390
战争爆发后
and war broke out

100
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,780
我没了我的广告公司  所以我现在...
I lost my advertising firm and

101
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
才在这里做这种工作
here I am.

102
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,870
所以我有我的专长
I do what I do.

103
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,200
你...做你该做的事
You  you do what you do.

104
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,380
但...我真的不算当过兵
But  I'm not a soldier really.

105
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,670
对  你当然不是
No   of course you're not.

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,000
所以我才让你跟几十万士兵在一起
That's why I'm embedding you with several hundred thousand men and women who are.

107
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,320
我很荣幸   将军  但我承受不起
Well it is an honor   General. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline.

108
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,350
我是见血就晕
I can't stand the sight of blood

109
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,180
被纸割伤都受不了
not so much as a paper cut.

110
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,330
呃...不过
Uh  but

111
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,110
呃...既然话都说到这儿了
uh  it's sitting here thinking about this

112
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,460
我倒是有几个认识的人可以向你推荐一下
a couple of names come to mind that I feel like I could recommend to you inste

113
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,450
少校  这不是商量  是命令
It's not an offer   Major   it's an order.

114
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,160
将军  别忘了我是一名美国军官
General   I'm an officer in the United States Military.

115
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,940
你没权利命令我
You don't even have that authority

116
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,500
我跟你的长官说过了
I've spoken to your C.O.

117
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,210
你现在受我指挥
You are now under my command.

118
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,000
当然你还保留目前的军阶
You will retain your present rank of course.

119
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,720
我秘书会再跟你详谈
My secretary has all the details.

120
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,970
好好干吧   少校
Do a good job   Major.

121
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,110
祝你好运
Good luck.

122
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,180
你可以走了
Dismissed.

123
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,570
将军
General.

124
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,660
我已经鼓动了几百万人
I just inspired millions of people

125
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,500
加入你的军队
to join your army.

126
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,960
当裹尸袋被运送回国
And when the body bags come home

127
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,540
肯定要有个人出来背黑锅
and they're looking for someone to blame.

128
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,420
你觉得我该怎么写  才能让人们
How hard do you think it would be for me to convince people

129
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,050
不骂你
to blame you?

130
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,760
我想将军也不想那样吧
I'd imagine a General would prefer to avoid that.

131
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,890
你是在威胁我吗  少校
Are you blackmailing me   Major?

132
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,150
我只是...
I would prefer

133
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,690
不想明天到海滩去拍摄那些勇士的英雄壮举
not to be filming acts of heroism and valor on that beach tomorrow.

134
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,620
你明天不用去了
You won't be.

135
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,040
很高兴能达成协议
I'm glad we could uh  work this out.

136
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,610
那将军  不介意的话  我先...
Now   if you'll excuse me   General   I

137
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,090
谢谢
Thank you.

138
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
把他抓起来
Arrest this man.

139
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
啊
What?

140
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
不要跑
Stop running!

141
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,800
航机将在10分钟后关门
Flight closing in 10 minutes.

142
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,570
站起来  废物
On your feet   maggot!

143
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,870
不许这样跟长官说话  中士
Now that's no way to address an officer   Sergeant.

144
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,820
我就是这样对待新兵的
That's how I address a slack-jawed recruit right

145
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,790
接着还会用鞋跟往新兵的屁眼塞
before I bust his hole with my boot heel.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
废物
Maggot!

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
孩子  等等
Hold up there   son.

148
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
要帮忙吗  先生
Can I help you   sir?

149
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,260
中士  这里是哪里
Where the hell am I   Sergeant?

150
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,220
希思罗前线指挥基地
Forward Operating Base   Heathrow.

151
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,510
你刚刚是跟新兵一起来的
You just came in with the fresh recruits.

152
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,300
我看着像新兵吗
Do I strike you as a fresh recruit?

153
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,930
不  长官  你不像
No   sir   you do not.

154
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,020
我是威廉姆·凯奇少校  是美国军官
My name is Major William Cage   I'm an American officer

155
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,770
军官
Officer?

156
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,980
这里是新兵营
This is Processing.

157
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,730
军官不会来这的  而却到这了  中士
There's no officers down here. I got this   Sergeant.

158
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,360
那你到底为什么会跑到新兵营来的
How the hell did you end up in Processing?

159
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
怎么了
What was it?

160
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,070
玩了一整晚的牌  单身派对
Poker night? Bachelor party?

161
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,030
中士  若你不介意的话
If it's all the same to you   Sergeant.

162
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,370
我想跟华盛顿的指挥官解释一下
I'd like to explain that to my Commanding Officer in Washington.

163
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,020
如果你能告诉我电话在哪...
So if you just take me to the phone

164
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
你不听说吗
Haven't you heard?

165
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,790
战争随时都可能开始
We're t-minusing our whole S.H. out

166
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,840
我们要深入法国
we're fixing to invade France.

167
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,760
整个基地都封闭了  不准通电话  接或打都不行
This whole F.O.P is on lockdown   no calls   in or out.

168
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
你叫法雷尔
You're name's Farell?

169
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,990
没错
That's right.

170
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,140
二等士官长法雷尔
Master Sergeant Farell.

171
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,940
二等士官长法雷尔  美国人
Master Sergeant Farell   you're an American.

172
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,180
不  我从肯塔基来的
No   sir. I'm from Kentucky.

173
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,980
好吧  好 看看我
Okay   well  Look at me.

174
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,900
再看看这里
And look at where I am.

175
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,860
我是被迫的
I've been railroaded.

176
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,200
很明显地我不该在这里
It's obvious   I don't belong here.

177
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,740
所以拜托了  士官长
So please   Sergeant.

178
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,450
想办法让我打个电话
There has to be a way I can make a phone call.

179
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,880
我会带你去的
I'll get you sorted out   sir.

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
谢谢
Thank you.

181
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,210
这边走
Right this way.

182
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,550
士官长  你住肯塔基的哪
Where are you from in Kentucky   Sergeant?

183
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,920
一个叫科学山丘的小镇
Little town called Science Hill.

184
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,030
听过吗   现在听过了
Heard of it? I have now.

185
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,310
那你从哪来   新泽西州的蔓越莓镇
How about you   where are you from? Cranberry   New Jersey.

186
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,140
那边出产蔓越莓
They grow our cranberries there   do they?

187
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,950
产番茄  我吃过最好吃的番茄
Tomatoes   best I've ever had.

188
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,440
那为什么叫蔓越莓镇
Why do they called Cranberry then?

189
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,400
那为什么叫科学山丘
Why do they call it Science Hill?

190
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,070
没问过  无所谓
Never asked   don't care.

191
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,740
你先请
After you.

192
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,580
你不是带我去打电话吗  士官长
You're not taking me to a phone   are you   Sergeant?

193
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,640
不  我不是
No   I'm not.

194
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,170
看来你说的话  只有你的名字是真的
Seems about the only honest thing you've said to me so far is your name.

195
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,130
这上面说你是个逃兵
Says here you're a deserter.

196
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,380
说你因为冒充美国军官而被抓
Says here you were caught impersonating an officer

197
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,280
说你会试图往外打电话
It says here you'd likely try to make an outside call

198
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,180
甚至还会威胁到行动的安全
even compromise security of this operation.

199
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,810
说你只要能逃避打仗  什么都干得出来
Anything to get out of combat duty tomorrow.

200
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,850
但这些都不会发生
But that's not gonna happen.

201
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
都不会的
Ever.

202
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,060
二等兵凯奇
Private Cage.

203
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,830
人言可畏
Rumor is a terrible thing.

204
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,830
不用等到晚上  这些人对你的看法就会达成一致
And not following these men   we'll all reach the same conclusion.

205
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,910
你是个满口谎言的懦夫
That you're a coward and a liar

206
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,830
把自己的生命看得比其他生物的还重要
putting your life above theirs.

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,840
不过你还有希望  二等兵
The good new is there's hope for you   Private.

208
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,340
那就是参加这场光荣的战争
Hope in the form of glorious combat

209
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,880
战争是伟大的救世主
battle is the great redeemer

210
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,090
也是一个大熔炉  能锤炼出真正的英雄
fire and crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.

211
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,140
战场上没有高低贵贱之分
The one place where all men truly share the same rank

212
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,350
无论你来的时候是什么样的废物
regardless of what kind of parasitic scum they were going in.

213
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,620
全队都听着
Squad!

214
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,480
这位是二等兵凯奇
This here is Private Cage.

215
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,310
二等兵凯奇
Private Cage.

216
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
J分队
J Squad.

217
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,140
那不是军官制服吗
Isn't that an Officer's uniform?

218
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,990
他可能只是在炫耀他的装扮
Or he's showing off us the cufflinks.

219
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,680
看来大家早上过得都非常充实
I see everyone is having a productive morning.

220
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,080
看到你们这水准的人让我倍感自豪
You know it gives me a swell of pride knowing soldiers of your

221
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,710
因为明天是你们去冲锋陷阵
caliber will be leading the charge tomorrow.

222
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,130
长矛之尖
Tip of the spear.

223
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,050
利剑之刃
Edge of the knife.

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,760
通通都用来刺屁股
Crack of my ass.

225
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,320
二等兵  基梅尔
Private Kimmel

226
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,970
我对在军营里赌博是什么观点
what is my view of gambling in the barracks?

227
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,450
你不喜欢  法雷尔士官长
Dislike it   Sergeant Farell.

228
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,970
南希  我为什么不喜欢
Nance   why do I dislike it?

229
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,120
这会鼓励大家靠运气取胜 而不是靠自身素质
Cause it maintains the notion that our fate is in hands other than our own.

230
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,230
在命运面前 我们永远不变的态度是什么
And what is my definitive position on the concept of fate?

231
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,230
全体告诉我
Chorus.

232
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,480
纪律严明  时刻准备 做命运的主人
Through readiness and discipline   we are masters of our fate.

233
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,490
你们也许会觉得这很荒唐
You might call that notion ironic

234
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,030
但相信我
but trust me

235
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
你们会理解的
you'll come around.

236
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,660
二等兵凯奇是个逃兵
Private Cage is a deserter.

237
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,080
我要你们每一个人亲自负责教导他
I'm making you all personally responsible for his deliverance.

238
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,210
明天早上6点  他必须进入备战状态
He will be combat ready at 06:00 tomorrow.

239
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,960
备战状态
Combat ready?

240
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,610
二等兵凯奇  他幻想自己不属于这里
Private Cage is under the delusion that he does not belong here

241
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,340
我们必须制止他的这种幻想
we must dissuade him of this delusion.

242
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,680
如果他试图逃跑
If he tries to run

243
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,510
你们可以随便揍他  揍到他没法站着撒尿
feel free dissuade him until he can't piss standing up.

244
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,810
士官长  你听我说
You have to listen to me

245
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,660
我不可能在这备战
I will never be combat ready

246
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
我嫉妒你  凯奇
I envy you   Cage.

247
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,400
明天早上你将接受洗礼  重获新生
Tomorrow morning you will be baptized   born again.

248
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,520
体能训练十分钟
PT   ten minutes!

249
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,580
服装不对  二等兵
You're not in uniform  Private.

250
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,300
新的一天
It's a new day   people!

251
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,260
命运在召唤
Destiny calls.

252
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,090
这世界只要我们做一件事
The world expects only one thing from us

253
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
取得胜利
that we will win!

254
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,930
来吧  基梅尔  开工了
Come on   Kimmel! Let's have it!

255
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,900
天呀...基梅尔
Oh   for Christ's sakes   Kimmel!

256
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,690
这样多自在
I gotta be free   man!

257
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,150
好了  上场了  我得穿的正式点
Alright   man. Let's get this show on the road   I gotta suite up.

258
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,780
那是什么鬼声音
What's that noise? That

259
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,150
我们走吧
Let's go!

260
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,590
拜托  先生
Listen   man!

261
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,900
我真的不是跟他们一伙的
I've never been in one of these.

262
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,550
是啊  我以前从来没玩过3P呢
Yeah   well   I've never been with two girls at the same time before.

263
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,740
如果你能帮我找两个女人来  我绝对能搞定
But you can bet when that day comes   I'll make it work.

264
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,620
呃...基梅尔
Uh  Kimmel?

265
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,250
我叫格瑞夫
It's Griff.

266
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,130
格瑞夫、格瑞夫  你听我说
Griff. Griff   listen to me.

267
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
你想想
Think about this   man.

268
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,670
我可能会伤到别人
I could hurt somebody.

269
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,420
枪有保险装置的
Not with the safety on your one.

270
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
啊
What?

271
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,430
保险装置在哪
Where is the safety?

272
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
这就对了
Exactly!

273
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,430
(严禁穿越)
DO NOT CROSS

274
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,520
是时间了
It's time.

275
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,390
我的天呀  是钢筋铁骨娘
Bloody hell! It's the full metal

276
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
动起来
Move!

277
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,850
格瑞夫 士官长
Griff. Serge?

278
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,350
照顾一下二等兵凯奇
Take care of Private Cage!

279
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,790
什么  一整天吗
What   all day?

280
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,020
我有预感  他撑不了一整天
Something tells me he won't be needing it that long.

281
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,370
格瑞夫
Griff!

282
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,610
凯奇
Cage!

283
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,010
我们丢了德国
We lost Germany.

284
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
又丢了法国
We lost France.

285
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,240
今天再输  那就没必要再打了
If we lose today we won't get to fight in battle.

286
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,100
我知道你们的压力很大
Now I know the pressure on you is enormous.

287
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
2分钟后空降
Two minutes to drop.

288
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,580
害怕是正常的
It's alright to be scared..

289
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,940
记着  没有恐惧就没有勇气
Remember   there's no courage without fear.

290
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,570
嘿

293
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,110
是啊

294
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,990
里面装着死人
There's a dead guy in it.

295
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,540
出去后可要小心你背后  先生
Hey   watch your back out there   sir.

296
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,250
没人会在你后面罩你的
No one else will.

297
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,060
1分钟
One minute!

298
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,210
1分钟后空降
One minute to drop!

299

302
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,020
告诉我怎么打开武器上的保险
How do I turn the safety off of my weapon?

303
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,520
我的天呀
Oh   my God!

304
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,990

Let's go! Let's go!

313
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,720
跳了  跳了
Drop! Drop!

314
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,350
凯奇  不跳会死的
Cage   drop or die!

315
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,730
耶  呜呼
Yeah! Wooh!

316
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,230
我们成功了
We made it!

317

318
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,260
发生什...
What the ?!

319
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,340
二等兵凯奇
Private Cage!

320
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,050
你走错方向了
You're going the wrong way!

321
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,550
你会错过机会
You're gonna miss your moment!

322
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,590
这什么鬼地狱
What the hell?

323
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,310
它们不应该知道我们来
They're not supposed to know we're even coming.

324
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,350
老兄  我们进了屠宰场
It's a slaughter house   man!

325
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
是个屠宰场
It's a slaughter house!

326
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,980
冷静点  福特
Pull yourself together   Ford!

327
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,440
全员  都起来
On your feet   people!

328
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,900
整队
Get in line!

329
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,520
南希  给我敌人的位置
Nance   get me a sitrep!

330
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,750
保险装置
Safety?

331
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,990
格瑞夫、福特  到前面去
Griff   Ford   go to the front!

332
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,320
我的保险装置
My safety?

333
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,070
要怎么打开枪的保险...
How do I get my safety ?

334
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,090
我在等你呀  南希
I'm waiting   Nance!

335
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,120
找到位置了  500公尺外  快速接近中
I got traces! Five hundred meters and they're coming in fast!

336
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,620
他妈贱货
Son of a bitch.

337
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,790
如果想待在那条上  就把阵行排好
Put a line if you want to stay that way.

338
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,790
待在各自的攻击位置
On your position!

339
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,380
开始行动
Move!

340
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,150
他们来了
Here they come.

341
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,380
来势汹汹  数量多的惊人
Mean as hell and filthy as grass.

342
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,870
等他们再靠近点
Wait till the other ride's on us!

343
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,470
再几秒
Few more seconds!

344
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,060
喂
Hey!

345
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,060
退后
Fall back!

346
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,420
重新装弹
Reload!

347
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,130
重新装弹
Reload!

348
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
站起来  废物
On your feet   maggot!

349
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,280
在我用鞋跟塞你屁眼前  快列队  废物
Get in line before I bust your hole with my boot heel   maggot!

350
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,920
孩子  先等等
Hold up there   son.

351
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,970
要帮忙吗  先生
Can I help you   sir?

352
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,600
法雷尔士官长
Sergeant Farell

353
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,850
没错  就是我
That is my name.

354
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,810
我知道怎么回事了
I think I get it.

355
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,150
怎么了
What was it?

356
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
打了一整晚的牌
Poker night?

357
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
单身派对
Bachelor party?

358
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,530
我也不知道
I'm not sure.

359
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
常有的事
It happens.

360
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,870
我会为你带路的  先生
I'll get you sorted out   sir.

361
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,830
我帮你拿
Let me take those for you.

362
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,620
今天...是什么日子
What  what day is it?

363
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,210
对你而言...
For you

364
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
是审判日
Judgment day.

365
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,140
好消息是你还有希望  二等兵
The good new is there's hope for your   Private.

366
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,720
那就是参加这场光荣的战斗
Hope in the form of glorious combat

367
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,930
战争是伟大的救世主
battle is the great redeemer

368
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
是一个大熔炉
the fire and crucible

369
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,390
能锤炼出真正的...
in which the only true heroes

370
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,930
能锤炼出真正的英雄
In which the only true heroes are forged.

371
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,310
你刚刚是不是打断我的话了  二等兵
Did you just interrupt me   Private?

372
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
士官长
Sergeant.

373
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,950
你肯定不会相信我待会要跟你说的事情
You're  you're not gonna believe what I'm about to tell you.

374
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,110
不  我不信
No   I'm not.

375
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,240
刚才说到哪儿了
Now   where was I?

376
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,870
一个大熔炉
The Fire and crucible.

377
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,170
一个大熔炉...
The Fire and crucible

378
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,980
能锤炼出真正的英雄
in which the only true heroes are forged.

379
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,420
战场上没有高低贵贱之分
The one place where all men truly share the same rank

380
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,920
无论你来的时候是什么样的废物
regardless of what kind of parasitic scum they were going in.

381
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,390
小队  这位是二等兵凯奇
Squad! This here is Private Cage.

382
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,520
二等兵凯奇  这是J小队
Private Cage. J Squad.

383
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,500
那不是军官制服吗
Isn't that an Officers uniform?

384
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,190
他可能只是穿来炫耀他的衣服
He's showing off us the cufflinks.

385
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,900
要知道  看到你们这批水准的人让我倍感自豪
You know it gives me a swell of pride knowing soldiers of your

386
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,950
因为明天是你们去冲锋陷阵
caliber will be leading the charge tomorrow.

387
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,490
长矛之尖
Tip of the spear.

388
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,610
利剑之刃
Edge of the knife.

389
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,830
通通都是拿去刺屁屁的
Crack of my ass.

390
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,700
二等兵基梅尔  我对在军营里赌博是什么观点
Private Kimmel   what is my view of gambling in the barracks?

391
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,350
你不喜欢  法莱尔士官长
Dislike it   Sergeant Farell.

392
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,920
南希  我为什么不喜欢
Nance   why do I dislike it?

393
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,000
这会鼓励大家靠运气取胜 而不是靠自身素质
Cause it maintains the notion that our fate is in hands other than our own.

394
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,170
在命运面前  我们永远不变的是什么
And what is my definitive position on the concept of fate?

395
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,380
全体告诉我
Chorus.

396
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,220
纪律严明  时刻准备 做命运的主人
Through readiness and discipline we are masters of our fate.

397
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,260
你们也许会觉得这很荒唐
You might call that notion ironic

398
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,310
但相信我
but trust me.

399
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,390
你们会理解的
You'll come around.

400
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,770
我的天呀  基梅尔
Oh   for Christ's sakes   Kimmel!

401
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,190
这样多自在
I gotta be free   man!

402
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,330
好了  上场了  我得穿的正式点
Alright   man. Let's get this show on the road   I gotta suite up.

403
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,610
(开启状态)
Disengage.

404
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,700
老兄你在搞什么
Hey   what the hell's wrong with you   man?

405
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,910
难道你以前没穿过这个
Haven't you been in one of these before?

406
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,580
也许吧
Maybe.

407
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,360
知道保险装置在哪吗
Do you know where the safety is?

408
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,210
不太清楚
I'm not sure.

409
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,170
很好
Good.

410
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,560
我知道你们的压力很大
Now I know the pressure on you is enormous.

411
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,550
2分钟后空降
Two minutes to drop.

412
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,050
害怕是很正常的
It's alright to be scared.

413
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,470
记住  没有恐惧  就没有勇气
Remember   there's no courage without fear.

414
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,730
同学
Hey   Oy   mate!

415
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,060
你的衣服好像不太对劲
I think there's something wrong with your suite!

416
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
是啊
Yeah!

417
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,190
里面装的是死人
There's a dead guy in it.

418
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,820
出去后可要小心后面
Hey   watch your back out there   sir.

419
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,280
没人会在后面罩你

你们有人曾见过我吗

00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,110
二等兵 趴下做
Private give me

563
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,110
50个  是吗
Fifty   Serge?

564
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,040
没错
That's right.

565
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,250
50个
Fifty.

566
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,450
全排
Platoon.

567
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,500
给我做50个伏地挺身
Drop and give me fifty.

568
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,170
感谢二等兵凯奇
Compliments of Private Cage!

569
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,880
谢谢  中士
Thank you   Serge.

570
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,420
一
And one! One!

571
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,210
二
And two! Two!

572
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,550
三
And three! Three.

573
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,520
噢  这智障的脑子里到底装了些什么
Oh! What the hell were you thinking?

574
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,060
你还有希望  二等兵
There's hope for your   Private.

575
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,980
那就是参加这场光荣的战斗
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

576
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,280
战争是伟大的救世主
Battle is the great redeemer.

577
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,780
二
Two.

578
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
三
Three.

579
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,450
(请勿穿越)
DO NOT CROSS

580
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,080
打扰一下  弗拉塔斯基中士
Excuse me   Sergeant Vrataski?

581
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
打扰一下
Excuse me.

582
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
弗拉塔斯基中士
Sergeant Vrataski?

583
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,690
打扰一下
Excuse me.

584
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,440
什么事
Ya?

585
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,150
谁让你跟我说话了
Yes! Who said you could talk to me?

586
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,250
我脸上有东西吗
Have I got something on my face   soldier?

587
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,280
你干的  是你干的
You did. You did.

588
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,910
明天在海滩
Tomorrow   at the beach.

589
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,950
明天在海滩
Tomorrow   at the beach.

590
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,910
我们相遇
We meet.

591
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,750
你要我苏醒之后来找你
You said to find you when I wake up.

592
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,650
你肯定知道些什么
You do know what's happening to me.

593
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
跟我来
Come with me.

594
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
现在
Now.

595
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,730
否则  最好的结果是被关进精神病院
Cause the best case scenario is you're gonna end up in a psych ward.

596
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,530
最坏的结果  是被当试验品解剖
The worst case you'll get dissected for study.

597
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,180
明白了吗
Are we clear?

598
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,530
了解
Yes?

599
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,180
了解
Yes.

600
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,690
第一次死是什么情况
First time you died   what happened?

601
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,980
你杀了个"拟态"(Mimics)
You killed a Mimic?

602
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
描述一下
Describe it.

603
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,670
很特别
Uh  it was different.

604
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,690
体型大
It was a bigger.

605
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,900
蓝色的
Blueish.

606
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,820
你被它的血液喷到了
And you got covered in its blood.

607
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,660
没错  被喷到了
As a matter of fact   I did.

608
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,280
它们事先知道了
They know we're coming.

609
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,490
所以明天在海滩
On the beach tomorrow.

610
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,240
是场屠杀
It's a slaughter   isn't it?

611
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,000
你是怎么知道的
How do you know this?

612
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,750
你能不能  等等
Could you just  Wait!

613
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
等等
Wait! Wait!

614
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,510
能不能请你跟我解释一下
Would you please just explain to me what the hell is happening?

615
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,260
这到底是怎么回事
What happened to you happened to me.

616
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,090
我曾经也经历过  但后来又没了  就这样
I had it   I lost it. Okay?

617
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,280
你这样挺好的  所以有治疗方案  我怎么摆脱这个
I mean   that's great   there's a cure. How do I get rid of this?

618
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,680
我需要你的帮助
First I need your help.

619
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,680
我能怎么帮你
Help with what exactly?

620
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,390
打赢战争
Winning the war.

621
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,350
跟我来  快
Let's go   come on!

622
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
瑞塔  什么意思
Rita   what is this?

623
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,410
瑞塔  你来这儿干什么  你该先告诉我的
Rita   what are you doing here? You've got to give me some warning.

624
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,170
他是谁
Who's this?

625
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,570
他就是有我在凡尔登之前遇到的现象的人
He's me   before Verdun.

626
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,730
他会帮我们的
He's gonna help us.

627
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,200
什、你说他是
What   you mean   he's ?

628
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
对
Yes.

629
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,410
什么时候死的  在哪   在沙滩  明天
When did he die? Where? On the beach   tomorrow.

630
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,880
我在背后竖起了几根手指
How many fingers am I holding up behind my back?

631
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,540
我怎么会知道
How should I know that?

632
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
好吧
Okay.

633
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,790
这是我们第一次这样对话
So this is the first time we've had this conversation?

634
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,240
给他试试这个
We should try this on him?

635
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,190
这是什么鬼东西 没用的
What the hell is that? It doesn't work.

636
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,580
他看见什么了吗   什么看见
Has he had any visions yet? Visions of what?

637
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,720
还得需要点时间
Okay   so there's still time.

638
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,690
是的 时间  等等  抱歉
Yes. Time? Look   I  I'm sorry.

639
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,910
他是谁
What  who is this?

640
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
你是谁
Who are you?

641
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,730
我是卡特博士
I'm Dr. Carter.

642
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,190
粒子物理高等微生物学
Particle Physics Advanced Microbiology.

643
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,410
他是唯一相信你经历的人
He's also the only other person who'll believe what's happening to you.

644
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,120
没人比他更了解模仿者外星人
No one understands Mimic biology   better than him.

645
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,910
他是白宫的首席分析师
He's a top analyst at the Whitehall.

646
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,040
那已经是遇见瑞塔之前的事了 现在我只是个
Ye  well   I mean   I was until I met Rita and now I'm just a a

647
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,420
精神有问题的机械师
"mechanic with psychiatric delusions."

648
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,880
卡特  给他看看
Carter   show him.

649
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,910
好  首先  你不是在跟军队作战
Right   the first of all   you're not fighting an army.

650
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,310
你得把它想成是一个单独的生物体
You have to think of this as a single organism.

651
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,060
看  这些触手让它们行动非常灵活
Now these common drones   they act like its claws.

652
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:07,080
α  就是你杀死的那种  数量没那么多
That Alpha's   like the one that you killed   are much more rare.

653
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,460
我估计618万才会有一只
Yeah   they're like one in six point one eight million   by my guess.

654
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,990
它们会预知敌人的行动
They act as the enemies

655
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,860
就像中枢神经系统一样
They're like its central nervous system.

656
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:17,530
而这个  就是大脑
But this  is the brain.

657
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,410
它们的指挥部
It controls them all.

658
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,540
它就是Ω
And this is the Omega.

659
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,290
它有一种控制时间的能力
And the Omega has the ability to control time.

660
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,420
一但α被杀
Whenever an Alpha is killed

661
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,630
一种自动反应就会被触发
an automatic response is triggered.

662
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,680
Ω就会重启当天
The Omega starts the day over again.

663
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,010
它会记住即将发生的事
But you see this time it can remember what's going to happen

664
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,600
就像你一样
just like you do.

665
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,610
在我们行动之前  它会预知我们要干什么
It-it knows exactly what we're going to do before we're gonna do it.

666
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,140
能预知未来的敌人  很难战胜
And an enemy that knows the future can't lose.

667
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,530
如果这样  凡尔登那次是怎么赢的
But if that's true   how did you win in Verdun?

668
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,360
是对方故意的让我们赢的
We were allowed to win.

669
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,860
它想让我们相信  我们能赢
This thing wants us to believe we can win.

670
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,120
诱使我们不惜一切代价投入这场战争
It wants us to throw everything we have into the invasion.

671
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,200
其实这场战争  不是我们的收官之战
Operation Downfall isn't our end game.

672
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,710
而是敌人的
It's the enemy's.

673
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,080
要明白  这是一种
The thing you've got to understand is this is a

674
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,960
经过完美进化的霸主级生物
perfectly evolved world conquering organism.

675
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,300
能想像成  会有成千上万的这样的东西
For all we know   there are thousands   millions   of those asteroids

676
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,930
漂浮在宇宙中  就像病毒一样
floating around the cosmos like a virus.

677
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,350
它们就等着在合适的条件下登入地球
And it's just waiting to crash land into a world with just the right conditions.

678
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,690
最终目的是攻击地球上的人类  然后
All they need is for the dominant life form to attack and

679
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,430
它们会横扫一切  统治整个地球
And they'll be nothing to stop the Mimics from conquering the rest of the world.

680
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,900
除非你阻挡它们
Unless you change the outcome.

681
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
我
Me?

682
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,620
你杀掉阿尔法的时候
When you killed that Alpha   you inadvertently

683
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,060
无意中进入了敌人的神经系统
entered the enemy's nervous system.

684
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
凯奇
Cage.

685
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:43,000
你掌握了它控制时间的能力  可以随时重启当天
You've seized control of the Omega's ability to reset the day.

686
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,870
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

687
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,960
这东西唯一的弱点
Perhaps this organism's only vulnerability

688
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,250
对付它最有效的手段  就是人性
its  its only vulnerability  is humanity.

689
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,720
不管怎么样  你拥有了这个能力
Regardless of that   you control the power now.

690
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,340
就像当初我在凡尔登时一样
Just as I did in Verdun.

691
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,510
所以我能重启时间
So I'm resetting the day?

692
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,180
好
Okay.

693
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,560
需要怎么操控这能力
How do I control it?

694
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,650
你必须死
You have to die.

695
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,110
天天死
Every day.

696
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,190
直到Ω被摧毁
Until the Omega is destroyed.

697
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,250
首先  你的演示很精彩
Fist of all   that was a terrific presentation.

698
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,250
非常完美
Terrific.

699
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,050
我认识将军
I know the General.

700
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,670
我们应该向他汇报
We should take this to him.

701
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,890
告诉将军你们说的这一切  而不是...
You just tell him everything you told me   he would know

702
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,050
我去见过将军  凯奇
I went to see the General   Cage.

703
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,680
而且是无数次
Many number of times.

704
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,990
精神病院、解剖研究
Psyche ward   dissection.

705
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,020
记得吗
Remember?

706
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,020
那你们希望我怎么做
What are you expecting from me?

707
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,900
你有没有看到什么异象
Have you seen anything strange?

708
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,660
你在开玩笑吗
Is he shitting me?

709
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,050
幻象
Visions.

710
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,880
幻象  你看见过这样的幻象吗
Visions! Have you seen any visions like that?

711
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,160
Ω对力量失去控制会有感知
The Omega centers when its losing control of its power.

712
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,620
现在它一直在用精神力量搜寻你
Even now its mentally searching to find you.

713
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,170
一旦你快被找到时  就会产生各种幻象
When its close to finding you   you will start having visions.

714
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,670
你就会看见它
You'll start to see that.

715
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,300
甚至能看到它在哪
You'll even see where it is.

716
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,340
你也看过幻象
And you had these visions?

717
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
是的
Yes.

718
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,850
你亲眼见过它  真的看过  对吗
But eventually you saw it   I mean   you actually saw it. Right?

719
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,190
我从没见过它
Never in the flesh.

720
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,780
那这一切都只是些
So this is all just some

721
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,070
理论
theory?

722
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,580
你们无法确定这些事情是确实存在的
You don't know if this thing even exists.

723
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,450
幻象告诉我  它就在凡尔登
The visions showed me it was at Verdun.

724
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,450
我看过了
I could see it!

725
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,120
我...我只是
I I just

726
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,000
在找到它之前失去了这种能力
lost the power before I could get to it.

727
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,130
等我们拿下凡尔登
And by the time we took Verdun

728
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Ω早跑了
the Omega was gone.

729
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:09,020
好  那我要做的就是等待这些幻象
Okay   so all I have to do is wait to have these visions

730
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,480
然后再告诉你们这家伙在哪儿
and then tell you where this Omega thing is?

731
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:13,690
不  凯奇
No   Cage.

732
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,150
你要带我去那
You're gonna get me there

733
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,360
由我来干掉它
and I'm gonna kill it.

734
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,030
带你去
Get you there?

735
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,160
我根本没接受过战斗训练
I mean   I'm not even trained for combat.

736
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,300
重新装弹
Reload.

737
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:44,090
重新装弹
Reload.

738
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,610
没事吧  凯奇
You alright   Cage?

739
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,030
好像哪儿摔断了
I think I broke something.

740
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:08,370
哪
What?

741
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:10,450
我的背
My back.

742
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,830
我现在只能感觉到嘴唇
The only thing I can feel are my lips.

743
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,880
你仔细听好了  这是条很重要的规则
Now listen carefully. This is a very important rule.

744
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:19,710
也是唯一的规则
This is the only rule.

745
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,630
如果在战斗中受伤  你要保证自己死去
You get injured on the field   you better make sure you die.

746
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,590
为什么
Why?

747
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:29,010
上次我在战斗中被击中了
Last time I was in combat   I was hit.

748
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,390
当时失血很多  差点儿就死了
I was bleeding out   just not fast enough.

749
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,190
输了三袋血后  我在战地医院苏醒过来
I woke up in a field hospital with three pints of someone else's blood

750
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,310
人已经废了
and I was out.

751
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,360
失去了那种能力  你明白吗
I lost the power   do you understand?

752
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,740
所以再来一遍吧
Then you better start over   don't you?

753
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,740
什么
What?

754
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,040
没人知道二等兵凯奇怎么了
No one knows what happened to Private Cage?

755
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,580
斯金纳你这笨蛋  他就在你旁边
Skinner   you dumb ass   he was right next to you

756
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,460
别告诉我你不知道那家伙跑哪去了
you're telling me you don't know where that slippery son of a bitch went?

757
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,480
不  中士
No   Serge!

758
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,670
好吧
Alright.

759
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,170
那就再来50个  怎么样
Let's do another fifty   shall we? Oh   no!

760
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:03,670
一
And one!

761
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:05,110
不  等等
No! Wait   wait!

762
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,170
我叫威廉姆·凯奇
My name is Will Cage.

763
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,880
我们在沙滩见过
I we met on the beach.

764
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,330
是将在沙滩见  明天
We meet on the beach   tomorrow.

765
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,720
我们是一类人
I have what you had.

766
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,150
好了  再来一遍
Alright   let's go again.

767
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,690
你没有时间多想
You don't have time to think.

768
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,380
记住  光知道它们的位置还不够
Remember   it's now enough knowing where they're going to be

769
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,450
必须知道怎么杀掉它们
you have to know how to kill them.

770
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,200
好的...等等  等等
That's it  hold on! Hold on!

771
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,750
听我说  听我说
Listen! Listen!

772
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:40,710
好吧  动手吧
Okay   do it.

773
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,630
站起来  废物
On your feet   maggot!

774
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,940
停
Stop!

775
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:49,970
等等等等
Wait   wait   wait   wait!

776
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,300
停下来  等  等一下
Stop! Wait! Wait a second!

777
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,560
等一下
Wait a second!

778
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,390
等一下
Wait a second!

779
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,300
我一直在想
You know   I've been thinking.

780
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,840
这东西在我的血液里
I mean   this thing's in my blood.

781
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,110
也许有什么办法  我可以把它传给你
So maybe there's some way I can transfer it to you.

782
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,320
我试过了  跟本不行
I've tried everything   it doesn't work.

783
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:08,900
你有没有...
And have you

784
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,660
你知道的
You know?

785
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,550
试过所有的可能性
Tried all  all the options?

786
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,580
喔  你想说做爱
Oh   you mean sex?

787
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,580
对  试过了
Yep   tried it.

788
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,720
试过几次
How many times?

789
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:20,750
行了
Alright.

790
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:24,920
左边  左边  左边  左边
Left   left   left   left!

791
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,260
睁大你的眼睛
Keep your eyes open.

792
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,430
再来
Again!

793
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,140
再来
Again!

794
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,430
再来
Again!

795
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,270
再来
Again!

796
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:51,030
等等  我觉得可以了
Just wait   wait! I think I'm okay.

797
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,910
站起来  废物
On your feet   maggot! Maggot! Maggot!

798
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,410
我已经很客气了  废物  快动起来
Now   I'm done being nice to you   maggot! Now move!

799
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:01,470
你没事吧  凯奇
You okay   Cage?

800
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,170
喔  没事没事  我很好
Oh   yeah! Yeah   I'm good! I'm good!

801
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,600
你的腿断了
You're leg's broken.

802
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,920
没这回事  我还能感觉到脚趾
No! I  I can still feel my toes.

803
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,970
噢...不是吧
Oh   come on!

804
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,700
瑞塔  这什么意思  你来这干什么  你该先告诉我的
Rita! Rita! What is this? What are you doing here?

805
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,170
他是谁
Look   who's this guy?

806
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,370
他就是我有凡尔登之前的 有凡尔登之前的
He's me  before Verdun. before Verdun.

807
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,730
什么  你是说他是
What  what do you mean? He's ?

808
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,580
对
Yes! Yes!

809
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,750
什么时候死的  在哪
When did he die? Where?

810
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,140
在沙滩  明天
On the beach   tomorrow.

811
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,460
我是威廉姆·凯奇  你是卡特博士
I'm Will Cage   you're Dr. Carter.

812
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,380
我们曾有这次对话  你在背后竖起两根手指
We've had this conversation before. You have two fingers behind your back.

813
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,670
我看过幻象
I've had the visions.

814
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,920
见过Ω了
I've seen the Omega.

815
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,990
我们明天会败得很惨
It's  pretty much game over tomorrow

816
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,680
所以我们可以不必在这浪费时间了
So can we move this along?

817
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,020
好吧
Okay.

818
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,730
在哪儿
Where?

819
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,140
那有水坝  在山里
There's a dam   it's in the mountains.

820
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,150
我看见了德文标识
I saw German writing.

821
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,400
你能找到它的位置吗
Do you think you can work out where that is?

822
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:08,450
Well   I mean there can't be too many places that fit that
Well   I mean there can't be too many places that fit that

823
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,150
我来试试吧
I'll see what I can do.

824
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,820
训练结束了
Training's over.

825
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,320
我们明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

826
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,280
我们还不知道去哪儿 很快就会知道了
We don't even know where we're going. We will   soon enough.

827
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,920
你现在要想想  怎么在海滩上保住命
In the mean time   you need to figure out a way to get us off that beach.

828
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,980
然后呢  我们去哪
What next? Where are we going?

829
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,670
哪条路  快想
Yeah  Which way? Focus!

830
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:49,360
哪条路
Which way?

831
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,440
我在想  我在想
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

832
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,400
好...噢干
Okay  Oh   man!

833
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,320
我们走了多远
How far do we make it?

834
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:58,120
这真的很难说
Well   it's  hard to say.

835
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,990
等等
Hold!

836
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:03,330
好  走
Okay   go!

837
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,250
他妈贱货
Son of a bitch!

838
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,330
我想是往左挪步、躲避 好
I thought stepping left   ducking. Fine.

839
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,810
说清楚  往左挪步
Just for the record   stepping left

840
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:12,060
往左挪步、往右躲避 已经很具体了
Stepping left   ducking right. It was pretty specific.

841
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,130
往左挪步  往右躲避
Stepping left   ducking right.

842
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,670
继续
Move on.

843
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,760
等等
Hold on!

844
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,100
现在记住  要穿过战壕  正前方
Now remember   across the trench   twelve o'clock

845
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,270
注意你的右侧
then look to your right.

846
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,390
还是不够具体  明白吗
You're not being specific   you understand?

847
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,360
好
Oh   okay.

848
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,940
必须要非常具体  否则我死定了
You need to be specific   otherwise I'm dead.

849
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,240
瑞塔
Rita.

850
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,160
凯奇
Cage!

851
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,200
一步一步走到战壕的顶端
That takes us up to the top and then the trench.

852
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,410
向左挪步  那有"拟态"(Mimics)
I'm gonna step left   there's gonna be a Mimic there which

853
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:46,960
我会杀掉它
I'll kill

854
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,310
载运机爆炸  我要向西北前进30步
There's an explosion   I'm gonna run thirty paces to the north west.

855
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,470
到达战壕顶端时要蹲下  然后应该向左转
I'm gonna duck at the top of that trench   and then I'm gonna turn left.

856
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,360
我脸上有东西吗
I got something on my face?

857
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,980
没有
No!

858
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,910
凯奇
Cage!

859
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,770
我们在到处找你
We've been looking everywhere for you!

860
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:29,910
凯奇
Cage!

861
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,020
大家
Guys.

862
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,590
大家  今天
Guys can we just

863
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,710
就歇一歇吧
not do this today?

864
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:39,170
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

865
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,590
因为找不到你  法雷尔都快把我们折磨死了
Farell almost strung us up by our bullocks for losing track of you!

866
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,060
好了  斯金纳
Okay   Skinner.

867
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,270
你看着
Watch this.

868
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,940
现在我闭上眼睛
Now I'm gonna close my eyes.

869
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,770
好了 是的
Ready? Yeah.

870
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,700
我一点都没埋怨你
I didn't mind the extra push ups.

871
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,130
新的一天
It's a new day   people!

872
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,420
命运在召唤
Destiny calls.

873
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,090
这世界只要我们做一件事
The world expects only one thing from us:

874
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,210
取得胜利
That we will win!

875
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:39,030
从前线传回的战况  联合防御部队伤亡惨重
The current situation on the front line show heavy casualties

876
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,010
是时候让那些东西看看我们的实力了
It's about time we showed those things what we're made of.

877
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,570
我父亲可是不列颠战争中的飞行员
My father flew in the battle of Britain

878
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,410
美国人是三年后才参战的
three years before the yanks came into the war.

879
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,080
我们势不可挡  绝对有种
Couldn't be broken   backbone.

880
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,620
我叔叔乔治参加过诺曼地登陆
My Uncle George landed on the beach of Normandy   yeah.

881
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,590
真的  让他们打  这仗我们早就拿下了
In their day   this war would have been over by now.

882
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:59,420
这些家伙到底想要什么
What do they want with us anyway?

883
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,510
这还用问吗  矿产
It's obvious   isn't it? Minerals.

884
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:02,470
矿产
Minerals?

885
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,950
对  金属矿产 他们要的是氧气
Yeah   minerals. Oxygen   they want.

886
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,340
这有什么区别
What difference does it make?

887
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,970
他们来了  也赢了
They're here   they're winning.

888
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,230
无论想要什么  都会得到的
And whatever it is   they're gonna get it.

889
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:13,980
你不是该去那吗
Shouldn't you be over there?

890
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,400
我早去过了
I've been over there.

891
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:18,940
比谁去的次数都多
More times than anybody.

892
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,490
不怕告诉你们  我已经死过很多次了
As a matter of fact   I'm usually long dead by now.

893
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,450
懦夫
Coward.

894
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,830
怎么回事  停电了
What's going on? The power's gone.

895
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,740
我找到Ω了  它一定在这
I found the Omega. I found it. It has to be here.

896
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,940
德国卡内拉大坝  肯定是这儿
Groser Dam   Germany. This as got to be it.

897
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:48,310
跟描述完全一致
It fits the description perfectly.

898
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,530
是  你找到了
Yes   you found it.

899
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,660
又一次地
Again.

900
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,330
那又能怎么样  我们根本到不了那
What difference does it make? Cause we're never gonna get there.

901
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,580
不管我们怎么做
No matter what we do

902
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,880
不管我们怎么精心策划
no matter how carefully we plan

903
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,460
都过不了海滩那一关
we can't get off that beach.

904
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,770
你能做到的  你能
You can do this. You can.

905
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,940
你每天都到这来  我来训练你
You keep coming here everyday and I'll train you.

906
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,480
已经训练过了
You already have.

907
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,060
我在等你呀  南希
I'm waiting   Nance!

908
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:46,920
50公尺外快速接近中
Five hundred meters and closing fast!

909
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,170
怎么回事
What the ?!

910
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,310
重新装弹
Reloading.

911
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,240
接着怎么做
What's next?

912
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:15,620
一直向前
Straight shot.

913
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,260
到山那儿
Up the hill.

914
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,290
好
Okay.

915
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,160
中士
Hey   Serge.

916
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,330
新来那家伙
The new guy

917
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,420
他叫什么来着
what's his name again?

918
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,720
得有交通工具才能深入到内陆
We need a vehicle to get further inland.

919
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,170
有什么问题吗
Then what's the problem?

920
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,480
问题是那里肯定有伏击
The problem is the ambush waiting for us down

921
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,800
还没找到车就会被杀掉
there   they kill before we find a working car.

922
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,760
好  那现在怎么办
Okay   so what's the current plan?

923
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,980
还有两辆车可以试试  小型货车
The two cars I haven't tried are the Minivan

924
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,520
好
Yep.

925
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,810
和绿色越野车 好
And the green SUV. Okay.

926
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,010
我去找越野车  把"拟态"(Mimics)引过去
I'll head for the SUV   draw the Mimics to me

927
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:45,650
你去找小型货车
You go for the Minivan.

928
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,980
发动之后就直接开走
You get it started   just go   take off.

929
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,820
不用等我 好
Do not wait for me. Okay.

930
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:54,490
对了  发动前一定别忘了把拖车解开
Well  just don't forget to disconnect the caravan before you take off.

931
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,770
你要的是速度
You are going to be in a hurry

932
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,700
别拖着个累赘
you don't want any dead weight.

933
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,100
拜托
Come on.

934
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,200
快呀  凯奇
Come on   Cage!

935
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,790
我看不见
Can't see!

936
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,920
你能吗
Did you ?

937
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:02,020
政府提醒市民不要外出 保持镇定
Stay where you are   remain calm.

938
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,350
如果你在车里  请锁上车不要出来
If you are in a vehicle   please lock the doors and stay inside.

939
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,990
敌人已经到了伦敦
The enemy has reached London.

940
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:17,660
重复一遍
Repeat.

941
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,780
伦敦也受到了袭击
London is under attack.

942
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:25,870
车技不错
That's good driving.

943
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,170
我忘了解开拖车了
I forgot to unhook the trailer.

944
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,630
你不太爱说话
You don't talk much.

945
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,840
不喜欢说话
Not a fan.

946
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,340
说话
Of talking?

947
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:21,470
不太喜欢说话  对
Not a fan of talking   no.

948
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,220
不过  你还是跟我说了
You know   you eventually do talk to me.

949
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,840
你曾经跟我说过
It's usually around Lyon

950
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,060
你和你的家人一起去过里昂市
you tell me about the time you went there with your family.

951
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,150
你弟弟走丢了
Your brother got lost.

952
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:37,110
我从没去过里昂市
I've never been to Lyon.

953
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:39,400
还说过你的中间名
You tell me your middle name.

954
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,030
佩顿
Peyton.

955
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,620
那不是我的中间名
That's not my middle name.

956
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,380
你是在拱廊找到你弟弟的
You found your brother in the arcade   by the way.

957
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,130
那应该都是我胡编的  为了让你安静点
Well maybe I made it all up just to keep you quiet.

958
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,340
反正我们聊过
But you do talk to me.

959
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,610
凯奇  我没有必要去了解你
Cage   I do not need to get to know you.

960
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,910
如果你是聪明人  就别跟我打关系
And if you knew what was good for you   you wouldn't want to get to know me either.

961
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,930
多想想怎么保命吧
It's the only way you make it through this thing.

962
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,230
那你认识亨德里克吗
What about Hendricks   you get to know him?

963
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,230
你怎么知道这个名字
How do you know that name?

964
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:13,730
你说的
You mention him.

965
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,360
不可能
That's not possible.

966
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,890
不然我怎么知道 我什么时候说的
Then how do I know his name? When did I mention him?

967
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,920
在什么情况下
Under what circumstance?

968
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,860
因为他  你才不跟我说话
Is he why you won't talk to me?

969
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,620
最好别再提他的名字
Don't ever mention his name again.

970
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,330
为什么
Why

971
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,890
你爱他   他死了
are you in love with him? He's dead!

972
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,300
我亲眼看他死过300次
And I watched him die three hundred times

973
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:42,180
而且记得所有细节  记得任何事
and I remember  every detail   I remember everything.

974
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,340
所以我不想再谈这些
So I don't need to talk about it.

975
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,770
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

976
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,230
战争就是这样
It's just war.

977
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,880
什么都没有  我们走吧
There's nothing here   keep going.

978
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:22,820
得先找到钥匙
We have to find the keys.

979
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:25,450
弄点儿油就行了
Let's just siphon the gas.

980
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,610
有飞机为什么还要开车
And why drive when we can fly?

981
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,450
这东西
In that thing?

982
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,410
我知道了  你肯定恐高
Let me guess   you're afraid of heights.

983
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,080
我是害怕坠机
I'm afraid of crashing.

984
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:34,910
这又没什么可丢人的
I'm not at all ashamed to admit it.

985
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,250
没事的  凯奇  能克服
You'll be fine   Cage. You'll learn.

986
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,210
怎么了 没什么  我没事
What is it? It's nothing   I'm fine.

987
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:43,590
怎么了 没什么
What is it? It's nothing.

988
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:45,170
瑞塔
Rita.

989
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,010
我看看
Let me see.

990
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,370
得找到直升机的钥匙
We have to find the keys to the helicopter.

991
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,180
肯定在附近什么地方
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

992
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,830
直升机的油是满的
You know the heli's full of fuel

993
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,540
我找到一根软管
I found a hose.

994
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,670
用飞的  凯奇
We're flying   Cage.

995
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:27,800
你知道就算我们找到了钥匙
Well   let's just say we find keys   you know?

996
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,180
就算开走了那架直升机
Get that helicopter started.

997
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,760
我们既没有战甲  也没有弹药
We don't have our jackets or ammunition.

998
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,970
马上就要天黑了
And it's gonna be dark in a few hours.

999
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,150
我们还不如回到刚才那个农舍
Might be better just going back to the farmhouse

1000
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,440
找点什么有用的  在那里过一夜
seeing what we could salvage. You know   spend the night there.

1001
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,180
早上再回这儿
Come back here in the morning.

1002
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:49,090
蜷缩在篝火旁边  再开上一瓶好酒
And curl up by the fire and open a bottle of wine?

1003
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,370
我觉得我们还是应该重置
We should just reset.

1004
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:56,580
这是死路一条 嘿  等  只是
It's a dead end. Hey   hold  just

1005
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,820
如果你认为都没差的话
If it's all the same to you

1006
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,670
我累了  我很痛苦  我宁可重新再来一次
I'm tired   I'm in pain. I'd rather just start fresh.

1007
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:03,340
先休息一下 咖啡煮好了
I'll tell you what   take a few minutes. Coffee's ready.

1008
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,840
我去找找钥匙  应该能找到
I'll look around for the keys   that's productive.

1009
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:06,860
十分钟
Ten minutes.

1010
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:07,510
好
Okay.

1011
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,970
然后我杀掉你
And then I'm killing you.

1012
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,880
好
Fine.

1013
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,010
你居然能找到咖啡
I can't believe you found coffee.

1014
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,390
谢谢
Thank you.

1015
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,110
加糖  对吗
Oh. Sugar   right?

1016
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,520
对
Yeah.

1017
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,090
谢谢
Thank you.

1018
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,120
等等  三勺
Hold on   three.

1019
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,320
你喜欢加三勺
You like three.

1020
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:50,300
那儿有件衬衣  你应该能穿
There's a shirt over there   it should be your size.

1021
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,680
我们来这里几次了
How many times have we been here?

1022
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,400
来过几次
How many times?

1023
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:10,820
钥匙在哪
Where are the keys?

1024
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,840
钥匙到底在哪 好
Where are the Goddamn keys? Okay.

1025
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,870
你会开的  对吧
You can fly it   can't you?

1026
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,240
不会...会
No. Well  yes.

1027
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:23,210
我只会起飞  降落还没学会
I mean   I can take off   I'm still working on my landing.

1028
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,170
那还在这里干什么  简直在浪费时间
What are we still doing here? You're wasting time!

1029
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:26,130
瑞塔
Rita.

1030
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,630
发动引擎你就会死
You start that engine   you die!

1031
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,260
你最多只能活到这
This is as far as you go.

1032
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,050
无论我做什么
No matter what I do.

1033
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,010
你都会死在这里
This is as far as you ever make it.

1034
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,190
20码以外藏着一个"拟态"(Mimics)
There's a Mimic buried twenty yards away.

1035
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,570
你发动引擎  它就会攻击你
It attacks when you start the engine.

1036
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,320
拿上你的武器上直升机  凯奇
Get your weapon and get in the helicopter   Cage.

1037
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,450
回到那边会遇到更多
There's more than a field battle there.

1038
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,540
我们俩只有一个能回去
Only one of us ever makes it.

1039
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:02,250
上来
Get in.

1040
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:03,840
唯一没有试过的方案就是
The only thing we haven't tried is a version where

1041
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,610
你回去  回到农舍去
you walk away   just go back to the farmhouse.

1042
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,710
有吃的  你在这儿等着我回来
There's food   you wait there until I get back.

1043
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,840
你会安全的
You'll be safe.

1044
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,150
我是士兵  我是自愿的
I'm a soldier   I volunteered.

1045
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:13,170
我不会让开
I'm not walking away.

1046
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,420
那你会死的
You die here!

1047
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,840
死在这
Right here!

1048
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,180
我救不了你
I can't save you.

1049
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:22,060
而之后我若去杀了Ω
And if I go on and kill the Omega.

1050
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,230
你的死
You're dead.

1051
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:24,770
会成为既定事实
Forever.

1052
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,770
我怎么样有那么重要吗
Why does it matter what happens to me?

1053
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:33,820
我希望没见过你
I wish I didn't know you.

1054
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,360
可是没办法
But I do.

1055
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:10,420
我的中间名...
My middle name

1056
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:12,670
是罗斯
is Rose.

1057
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:34,860
站起来  废物
On your feet   maggot!

1058
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:48,330
好消息是你还有希望  二等兵
Looks there's hope for your   Private.

1059
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,750
那就是参加这场光荣的战斗
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

1060
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,960
战争是伟大的救世主
Battle is the great redeemer.

1061
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:55,690
也是一个大熔炉  能锤炼出真正的英雄
The fire and crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.

1062
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,710
The one place
The one place

1063
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:09,310
什么事
Yes?

1064
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:12,020
谁让你跟我说话了
Who said you could talk to me?

1065
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,820
难道我脸有东西吗  士兵
Do I have something on my face   soldier?

1066
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:23,070
很抱歉打扰你了
I'm sorry to disturb you   Sergeant.

1067
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:48,070
好了  上场了  我得穿得正式点儿
Alright   man. Let's get this show on the road. I gotta suite up.

1068
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:52,060
你的头盔呢
Where's your helmet?

1069
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:55,150
我不打算戴
I'm not gonna wear one.

1070
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,860
很不方便
It's a distraction.

1071
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,280
你喝酒了吧
Have you been drinking?

1072
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,960
再给我三个556的弹簧夹
I need three more clips of five-five-six

1073
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:05,450
八颗手雷  还有一块电池
eight grenades and an extra battery.

1074
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:10,620
快点
Get it!

1075
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:18,580
嘿
Oy!

1076
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:19,590
同学
Oy   mate!

1077
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:22,630
你的衣服好像不太对劲
I think there's something wrong with your suite!

1078
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,340
里面装的是死人
There's a dead guy in it.

1079
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,470
耶
Yeah!

1080
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,300
呜呼  我们成功了
Wooh-hoo! We made it!

1081
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,640
感谢苍天  我们成功了  耶
Thank God   we made it! Yeah !

1082
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,260
了结呀
Finish it!

1083
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,490
它不在那
It isn't there.

1084
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:32,210
Ω不在那
What do you mean the Omega isn't there?

1085
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,590
我猜它从来就没在那儿
My guess is it never was.

1086
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:34,950
它们知道我们要来
They knew we were coming.

1087
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,490
它们伏击了我们  幻象就是个陷阱
They ambushed us. The visions were a trap.

1088
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,540
就像瑞塔在凡尔登看到的幻象一样
Just like Rita's visions were a trap at Verdun.

1089
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:44,850
它可以杀我但没杀
It could have killed me   but it didn't.

1090
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:46,210
它想要我的血
It's after my blood.

1091
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,880
那它们知道你是谁了
So they know who you are   they

1092
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:50,590
它们想恢复能力
They want their power back.

1093
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:52,310
就算这次没成  早晚也会
And they're gonna get it one way or another

1094
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,170
除非我们能找到Ω
unless we find the Omega.

1095
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:56,970
没别的办法了  我们完了
There  there isn't any other way   we're finished!

1096
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:58,220
不  我们还没完
No   we're not finished.

1097
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:00,450
那个没用  我无法让它工作
It doesn't work. I can't get it to work

1098
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:01,880
你在白宫做过一个原型
You built a prototype at Whitehall.

1099
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,810
没错  托你的福  我为此丢了工作
Yes! And I got fired for it   thank you very much.

1100
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,230
这到底是什么东西 这是个转发器
What is this thing   anyway? It's a transponder.

1101
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:08,030
把它放到α体内
You stick it into the Alpha and it taps into

1102
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,860
它会跟Ω之间产生信息波段
the wavelength connecting it to the Omega.

1103
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,360
这就是它的工作原理
That's the idea anyway.

1104
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:14,570
但我没法让它工作  现有的设备根本不行
But I can't get it to work   not with the equipment I have on hand.

1105
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,510
哪儿有你需要的设备
How do we get you what you need?

1106
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:19,870
刚才她不是说了吗
Well   that's the thing. I mean

1107
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:22,870
在白宫里的那个  差不多都可以进行测试了
when I was at Whitehall I built one   I was even ready to test it

1108
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,640
我跟主管汇报以后
but when I told my superiors about it

1109
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:25,670
就把工作丢了
well I lost my job.

1110
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:27,250
都觉得他疯了
They thought he was crazy.

1111
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,250
所以我们需要去趟白宫
So all we need to do is go to Whitehall.

1112
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,260
等到接近大门  你就会被捕的
He'd be arrested ten feet from the front doors.

1113
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,010
精神病院、解剖试验  记得吗
Psyche ward dissection   remember?

1114
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,970
嘿、嘿、嘿  你们还忘了一件事
Hey   hey   hey! Aren't you forgetting something?

1115
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,300
转发器要在活的α身上才管用
The transponder requires a live Alpha to make it work.

1116
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:40,760
我们不需要
We don't need one.

1117
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,020
我们有更好的选择
We got the next best thing.

1118
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,230
等中国代表团出来时要加快脚步
When the Chinese delegation comes out   you pick up the pace.

1119
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:54,240
那个戴黄袖章的家伙每次都能认出你
There's a guy with a yellow arm band that always recognizes you.

1120
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,990
所以你要低着头  在我右边走
So just keep your head down and stay to my right.

1121
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,370
干得不错
Nicely done.

1122
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,890
三
Three.

1123
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:09,630
二
Two.

1124
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,540
一
One.

1125
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:11,660
走
Go.

1126
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:26,350
转身
Turn.

1127
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:28,980
好的  继续走  眼睛往前看
Okay   keep walking. Just go straight ahead.

1128
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:32,110
罗宾森
Robinson

1129
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:34,500
我说过了别打扰我
I've asked not to be disturbed.

1130
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:35,650
你最好有个好理由
This had better be critical.

1131
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:36,990
人类的生死存亡
Fate of mankind.

1132
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,200
这个理由够吗
Critical enough?

1133
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:40,240
我不是活见鬼了吧
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

1134
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:42,080
我已经见过很多次了
I've had more than my share of that.

1135
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,000
坐下  将军  离那桌子远一点
Sit down   General   and stay away from your desk.

1136
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:48,080
我要是你  就不会当儿戏
I'd take her very seriously if I were you.

1137
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,540
真是让人佩服  少校
I have to hand it to you   Major.

1138
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,130
你离开这间办公室的时候  从没想到你会回来
When you left this office today   I never imagined you'd be back

1139
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,260
更别说是载誉归来的战斗英雄
let alone with my most decorated soldier.

1140
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,900
我给你讲个故事吧  将军
I'm here to tell you a story   General.

1141
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:01,200
一开始听着肯定会觉得很荒唐
And at first it's gonna sound ridiculous

1142
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,180
但你越往下听
but the longer I talk the more rational

1143
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,060
会越觉得合理
it's going to appear.

1144
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,560
告诉他  一会打回去
Tell him you'll call back.

1145
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:05,780
告诉谁
Tell who?

1146
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:07,600
是博蒙特少校  从哈利法克斯打来的
Major General Beaumont calling from Halifax

1147
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,810
他的飞机没能按时起飞
His plane's just been delayed.

1148
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,020
天气不好
Bad weather.

1149
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,480
你好
Yes?

1150
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:16,400
谢谢  博蒙特  一会儿打给你
Thank you   Beaumont. I'll call you back.

1151
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,660
明天的战斗是场屠杀
Tomorrow's invasion is a slaughter.

1152
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,900
我到海滩上  不超过五分钟就会死
I'm dead within five minutes of landing on that beach

1153
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,820
那些被你送上去的士兵也一样
along with every other soldier you are sending.

1154
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:27,200
因为敌人早就知道我们的计划
And that's because the enemy knows we're coming.

1155
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,910
我怎么知道的
Now how do I know this?

1156
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,620
我临死前杀了一个"拟态"(Mimics)
Before I died I killed a Mimic

1157
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:31,750
只是它有点特别
only this one was different.

1158
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
它传了一些东西到我的血液里
It passed something onto me in my blood.

1159
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:36,670
我能在同一天里周而复始地活着
Now I relive the same day over and over again.

1160
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,090
就跟它们一样
Just like they do.

1161
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:40,510
弗拉塔斯基中士在凡尔登也一样
Just like Sergeant Vrataski at Verdun.

1162
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:42,720
告诉你的秘书  你这一切正常
Tell your secretary everything's fine.

1163
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,010
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

1164
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,480
我很抱歉  将军  不知道您有客人
Oh   I'm sorry   General. I thought you were alone.

1165
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,600
没事
It's fine.

1166
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:53,690
她打印好了文件等你签字
She typed up those orders for you to authorize

1167
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:56,370
但忘了格林威治燃油丢弃计划那部分
but she left out the word eferring to the fuel duct in Greenwich.

1168
01:18:58,820 --> 01:18:59,820
你叫艾丽丝
Your name is Iris.

1169
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,570
你的生日是9月17号
You're birthday is September 17th.

1170
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:05,910
将军私下动用了一些关系
The General probably pulled some strings stationed your only son in Australia

1171
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:07,620
把你的独生子安排到了澳大利亚  以远离战争
as far from the war as possible.

1172
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:10,540
你刚接到电话  将军的晚餐预约取消了
Tell the General his dinner's been canceled   the call came in just now.

1173
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:14,250
晚餐预约取消了
Your dinner was canceled.

1174
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,750
你忘了燃油部分
You forgot the fuel dump.

1175
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:19,550
谢谢你  艾丽丝  出去吧
Thank you   Iris. That will be all.

1176
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,810
凯奇  动手吧 瑞塔
Cage   Let's go. Rita.

1177
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,410
我们应该
Let me just  What are you doing?

1178
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,560
好了  别再向他开枪了
Please   don't shoot him yet.

1179
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:34,610
好吗  我们应该
Okay? Just

1180
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:39,940
将军
General.

1181
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:42,400
这场对话我们不是第一次进行
Th  this isn't the first time we've had this conversation.

1182
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,740
就因为你非常固执
Cause that's  because you're  you're stubborn.

1183
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,450
你不相信我告诉你的  卡特博士是正确的
You won't believe me when I tell you that Dr. Carter was right

1184
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:52,370
敌人可以随意控制时间
That the enemy can manipulate time.

1185
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,580
我们注定失败
The invasion will fail

1186
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,290
无论你让多少战士去送死
no matter how many bodies you throw at it.

1187
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,130
赢得这场战争的唯一办法就是
And the only way to win this war

1188
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:01,170
找到"拟态"的核心能量
is by finding this power source within the cord

1189
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,090
消灭它
and killing it.

1190
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:04,050
而找到这种能量的关键
And the only means of finding it

1191
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,760
就在那个保险箱里
is in that safe right there.

1192
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,310
无论这场谈话我们进行多少次
No matter how many times that we have this conversation

1193
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,640
你都不相信  明天敌人就会攻陷伦敦
you refuse to accept that the enemy breaks through to London tomorrow

1194
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:15,020
我们会失败
and we lose.

1195
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:16,230
败的干净彻底
We lose everything.

1196
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,740
就算真是这样
Let's say for one moment

1197
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,950
又怎么合理地解释
that I can't rationally explain

1198
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:32,160
你这金口玉牙的本事
your impressive parlor tricks.

1199
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,670
卡特博士说过...
Dr. Carter told me

1200
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:39,540
需要活着的"拟态"(Mimics)它才能起作用
this device requires a live Mimic to work.

1201
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:40,750
你要它有什么用
What use is it to you?

1202
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,800
这是我的问题  正好相反
That's my concern. On the contrary.

1203
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,510
按你说的  这是关系到全世界
According to you   this concerns the whole world.

1204
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:49,850
那你会怎么做  如果你相信我刚才说的话
Well what would you do if you believed everything I just told you?

1205
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,560
我会找到那个...Ω
I would locate this  Omega.

1206
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,040
把它炸得粉身碎骨
And bomb it out of existence.

1207
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,000
用这种思维模式跟它斗
You're not mentally equipped to fight this thing

1208
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,060
永远赢不了
and you never will be.

1209
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,250
现在怎么办
What do we do now?

1210
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:19,880
不知道  还没到过这一步
I don't know. We've never gotten this far.

1211
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,150
挺容易的
That was easy.

1212
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,470
站住
Stop! Stop right there!

1213
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,680
不许动
Don't move!

1214
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,800
都不许动
Nobody move!

1215
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,720
扔掉武器
Drop it!

1216
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,680
这东西怎么用
What am I supposed to do this?

1217
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:45,710
插进你的大腿
Stick it in your leg!

1218
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,240
快
Do it!

1219
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:06,840
凯奇  感受到了什么
Cage   what happened?

1220
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:09,050
告诉我
Talk to me!

1221
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,140
我感觉到它了  我正在往那去
I feel it   it  it's taking me there.

1222
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:14,100
你看见什么了
What do you see?

1223
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,350
是罗浮宫
It's  it's the Louvre.

1224
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,730
的哪  还有其他的吗
Where? Where else?

1225
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:21,440
我在罗浮宫里  好多的水
I'm inside now. It's flooded.

1226
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:25,820
在往下去有个车库  博物馆地下的车库
I'm going down a garage   a garage underneath the museum.

1227
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:27,570
能看见Ω吗
The Omega   do you see it?

1228
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:35,490
它在巴黎
It's in Paris!

1229
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:54,390
瑞塔
Rita!

1230
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:37,390
你在干什么
What have you done?

1231
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,310
你在干什么
What have you done?

1232
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:44,020
你没事的  只是需要输血
You'll be fine. You just needed blood.

1233
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:46,610
你不知道你在干什么
You don't know what you've just done.

1234
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,610
我不能跟你闲聊
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

1235
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:50,190
跟我一起的
I was with someone.

1236
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,990
瑞塔·弗拉塔斯基  还活着吗
Rita Vrataski. Is she alive?

1237
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,950
瑞塔·弗拉塔斯基
Rita Vrataski?

1238
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:57,620
拜托
Please.

1239
01:23:58,490 --> 01:23:59,490
告诉我
Just tell me that.

1240
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:03,420
拜托告诉我
Please tell me.

1241
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,540
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1242
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,870
我解开这东西最多用不了三分钟  凯奇
I was out of those things in three minutes flat   Cage.

1243
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:45,870
你怎么了
What's wrong with you?

1244
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:48,960
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

1245
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:50,710
还没
Not yet.

1246
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,920
抱歉  凯奇
I'm sorry   Cage.

1247
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,070
不  等等
No! Wait   wait   wait!

1248
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:59,760
我完了  没能力了
I'm out! I'm out!

1249
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:00,930
我被输了血
They gave me blood!

1250
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:06,480
失去那能力了
I lost the power.

1251
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:09,770
能感觉到
I feel it.

1252
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,820
我无法再重置时间了
I can't reset the day anymore.

1253
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,290
必须杀掉Ω
We have to kill the Omega

1254
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,330
赶在开战之前
before the invasion starts.

1255
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:33,960
剩下不到三小时了
That gives us less than three hours.

1256
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,590
及时赶到巴黎需要一艘载运机
We need a drop ship to get to Paris in time.

1257
01:25:38,670 --> 01:25:40,180
还需要更多的士兵
We need more soldiers too.

1258
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,890
谁会疯狂到跟我们去巴黎
No one's crazy enough to follow us to Paris.

1259
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,020
凯奇
Cage!

1260
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:52,310
凯奇
Cage!

1261
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:52,860
大家
Guys!

1262
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:54,380
我们都在到处找你
We've been looking everywhere for you!

1263
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,380
听我说
Just listen

1264
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,040
因为找不到你法雷尔都快把我们折磨死了
Farell almost strung us up by our bullocks for losing track of you!

1265
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:59,150
听着
Just listen.

1266
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:01,240
听我给你们讲个故事
But you're gonna want to hear this story.

1267
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,460
一开始听着肯定会觉得很荒唐
Now it's gonna sound ridiculous at first   but the

1268
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:05,580
但是往下听  就会越来越觉得合理
longer I talk the more rational it's going to appear.

1269
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:06,930
是吗
Yeah?!

1270
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,580
知道我学校的名字
He named the school I went to

1271
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,960
还说出了我二年级老师的名字
and then he tells me my second grade teacher

1272
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:13,480
叫钩子波莉老师
was called Miss Pollyhook.

1273
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,020
她不让他去厕所  害得他尿了裤子
She wouldn't let him go to the bathroom   made him wet his pants.

1274
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:17,460
你闭嘴
Shut up!

1275
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:21,340
听着  我就是告诉你们  他什么事都知道
Look   I'm telling you   he knows everything

1276
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,240
我们所有的事
about all of us.

1277
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:24,260
放屁
Bullshit.

1278
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:25,910
是吗
Yeah?

1279
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:28,180
他还说  你的名字不是福特
He says your name ain't really Ford.

1280
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:30,680
福特其实是你的朋友
He says Ford was your friend

1281
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:32,600
在参战的第一天就阵亡了
died in combat on his first day.

1282
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:35,560
你代替了他  还给他家里人寄钱
You took his place   send your checks to his family.

1283
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,900
隐藏得可够深的
You slippery bitch.

1284
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,030
凯奇说敌人知道我们的计划
Cage says the enemy knows us too.

1285
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,740
正在海滩等我们
They're waiting for us on the beach

1286
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,010
我们都会死
and we all die.

1287
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:44,530
那根本就是一场屠杀
The whole invasion is a slaughter.

1288
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:46,660
真是好极了
Well   this is great.

1289
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:49,500
战前动员做的不错
Really good confidence booster for tomorrow.

1290
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,200
谢谢  凯奇
Thanks   cage.

1291
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,450
我们还有机会  对吗
But we can change it   right?

1292
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:54,370
我们肯定能做点什么
I mean   there has to be somethin' that we can do.

1293
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:55,980
总会有取胜的办法的
There has to be  a way that we can win.

1294
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
是有个机会
There is a chance.

1295
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,120
但很渺茫
It's a slim one.

1296
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:04,290
需要你们跟我走  马上
But it means coming with me   right now.

1297
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,750
大家听着
Listen   pal.

1298
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:08,670
我不管你知道多少我们的私事
I don't really care what you think you know about us.

1299
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,290
我们刚认识你
We just met you.

1300
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:14,210
凭什么让我们跟着你去打仗
Come on   why would we follow him into combat?

1301
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,800
没指望你们跟我走
I don't expect you to follow me.

1302
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,180
你们可以跟她走
I expect you to follow her.

1303
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:29,850
这不是钢筋铁骨娘吗...J小队
That's the full metal bi  J Squad.

1304
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,270
她是瑞塔·弗拉塔斯基
This is Rita Vrataski.

1305
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:35,070
大家都叫她...对
Otherwise known as  Yeah   yeah.

1306
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,440
凡尔登的天使
The Angel of Verdun.

1307
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:49,460
好吧
Okay.

1308
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,260
新的一天
It's a new day   people!

1309
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:01,890
命运在召唤
Destiny calls.

1310
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:04,760
这世界只要我们做一件事
The world expects only one thing from us:

1311
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,810
取得胜利
That we will win!

1312
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:07,930
如果你们今天不全力拚搏
Rest assured they enemy will thank you

1313
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:09,640
最高兴的肯定是敌人
for not giving a hundred percent today.

1314
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,020
J小队
Squad!

1315
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:15,360
J小队去哪了
Where's J Squad?

1316
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:34,920
好了  听着
Right   okay.

1317
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,460
这个Ω  能随意控制时间
So this Omega   it controls time?

1318
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:40,710
把这帮新世代的混蛋炸回老家
Exploding it into pieces and sending its bullocks back to where it came from!

1319
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:41,740
就都结束了
And then we go home!

1320
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:43,490
对  但它还有α保护着
Right   it's guarded by an Alpha

1321
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,140
连它一起杀  明白
Just kill it   okay?

1322
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,700
不
No!

1323
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,370
你们没听凯奇说吗
You heard what Cage said.

1324
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:49,600
不能杀掉α
Do not kill an Alpha.

1325
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:52,230
杀掉α  Ω会把一整天重置一遍
If we kill an Alpha   the Omega will reset this whole day.

1326
01:28:53,230 --> 01:28:54,900
我们都不会记得这次谈话
We'll never even remember we had this conversation.

1327
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:56,470
它们却知道我们
They're gonna know we're coming.

1328
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:59,580
如果遇到α要杀我  那我该怎么做
So what am I supposed to do if one of those Alpha's is about to kill me?

1329
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:00,940
为全队牺牲自己
Take a hit for the team.

1330
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:06,070
我们空降之后
When we're on the ground

1331
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:08,890
它们很快就会知道我们到了  我们没多少时间
there's not gonna be a lot of time before they know we're there.

1332
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,040
要设置一个观察哨
We're gonna need eyes up here.

1333
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,210
我参加  凯奇
I'm going in   Cage.

1334
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,180
还有三十秒到达
Thirty seconds   still contact.

1335
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:46,170
基梅尔
Kimmel.

1336
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,200
不
No!

1337
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:57,250
福特  快走
Ford! Let's go!

1338
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:58,380
凯奇
Cage!

1339
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,340
我们该走了
We gotta go!

1340
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:01,460
跳
Drop!

1341
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:03,010
凯奇  它们知道我们要来
Cage   they know we're coming in!

1342
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:06,380
跳
Drop!

1343
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,200
跳
Drop!

1344
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:10,220
得挂上  弹出去
You're not hooked in!

1345
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:30,070
你怎么那么慢
What took you so long?

1346
01:32:32,990 --> 01:32:34,200
还有活着的吗
Where are the others?

1347
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,930
我们快没弹药了  我还有双刃砍刀
We're low on ammo   I've got one claymine.

1348
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:43,330
福特  你没弹药了
Ford   you're out.

1349
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:46,250
格瑞夫的弹药库只剩一半子弹了  而他也动弹不了
Griff has only got half a magazine left and he can hardly move.

1350
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:48,050
你不是能看到未来吗
I thought you could see the future?

1351
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:49,550
我刚来到今天
I haven't lived this day.

1352
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,200
不知道会发生什么
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1353
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,090
别纠结了
It doesn't matter.

1354
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:56,100
想想怎么干掉它们
What matters is we finish this.

1355
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:57,930
怎么干
With what?

1356
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:02,020
格瑞夫不能动了  我们死了三个人
I mean   Griff can't even walk. We're three men down.

1357
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:02,850
算了吧
Come on!

1358
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:05,270
听着  别浪费时间了  集中弹药
Look   we're running out of time. Collect your ammo.

1359
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:08,020
我们和金字塔之间有上千个"拟态"(Mimics)
There must be a thousand Mimics between us and that pyramid.

1360
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,160
你说怎么做  难道直接走正门吗
So what are we gonna do? Just walk up to the front door   is that it?

1361
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:12,280
不能待在这儿等死
If we stay here   we die.

1362
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,400
是吗
Yeah?

1363
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:14,570
肯定过不去
We'll never get through.

1364
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:16,370
能过去的
We could.

1365
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:19,660
用那个
In that.

1366
01:33:21,450 --> 01:33:22,750
那东西飞不起来
That ship will never fly.

1367
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,330
不用飞起来
It doesn't need to fly.

1368
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,420
只要能带着我们快速地
It just needs to get us across there

1369
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:29,630
穿过那里就够了
with speed.

1370
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:33,800
如果引擎还能启动 用动力杆操控就行
If the engines are still running   we could steer with the power levers.

1371
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:36,180
斯金纳
Skinner.

1372
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:37,850
清出一条路
Clear a path.

1373
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,200
现在再试一次 不  还没反应
Try it again now. No   it's not reading.

1374
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:46,520
状态控制杆拉低
Condition lever low.

1375
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:55,030
主电源打开
Electrical power on.

1376
01:33:58,070 --> 01:33:59,080
格瑞夫
Griff!

1377
01:34:00,410 --> 01:34:01,870
我们要走了  快点
We gotta go! Come on!

1378
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:06,960
我帮不上什么忙了
I'm not gonna be any good in there   mate.

1379
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,590
让我给你们争取点时间吧
Let me buy you some time.

1380
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:15,920
电源启动了
The power's on.

1381
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:17,930
会成功的
This is gonna work.

1382
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:19,680
喂
Hey!

1383
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:22,140
快点  我们要走了
Hey   come on   man! We gotta go!

1384
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,020
别等我们了
Don't wait for us!

1385
01:34:24,350 --> 01:34:26,480
斯金纳、格瑞夫  快点
Skinner   Griff   come on!

1386
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:30,250
可以出发了  他们呢   斯金纳和格瑞夫呢
We're good to go   where are they? Where's Skinner and Griff?

1387
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:31,940
他们不来了
They're not coming!

1388
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,750
走吧  必须离开了
Go   brother. You gotta go   man.

1389
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,500
我们下辈子再见吧
I'll see you in the next life.

1390
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:56,630
见鬼
Bullocks!

1391
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:00,970
快闪开
Move over! Move over!

1392
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,020
我们得走了
We gotta go!

1393
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:05,850
我们必须离开了  快
No   we gotta go now!

1394
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:10,770
他们来了  凯奇
