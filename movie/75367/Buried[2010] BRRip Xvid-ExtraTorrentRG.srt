Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

8
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,875
Okay. What was it?
What's the number? What's the number?

00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,045
1-2-1...

10
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,465
FUCK!

11
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,145
Where is it?

12
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,210
- 911. Please hold.
-No! Wait! Please!

13
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,925
- Yes. 911.
-Hello. I'm buried.

14
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,845
You have to help me.
You have to help me. I can't breathe.

15
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,305
-Sir?
-I'm buried in a coffin. Please, help.

16
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,890
-Send someone to find me.
-Sin slow down.

17
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,850
-What is your name?
-Paul. Paul Conroy.

18
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,269
Okay, Mn Conroy.
Can you tell me your location?

19
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,188
I don't know. I'm in a coffin.

20
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,357
I don't know where.
Please, help. I'm scared.

21
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,525
-You’re in a coffin?
-Yes.

22
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:32,860
It's like one of those old,
wooden ones.

23
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,029
-Are you at a funeral home?
-No. No. No.

24
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,155
I don't know. No.

25
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,406
How are you calling me right now?

26
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,491
What?

27
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,869
If you’re buried in a coffin,
where are you calling me from?

28
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,746
From a cell phone.
There was an old cell phone in the coffin.

29
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,332
-You're calling me from your cell phone?
-Yes.

30
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,250
Yes. Yes. No, no.
It's not my cell phone,

31
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:49,627
but, yes, I'm calling from a cell phone.

32
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,380
There was a cell phone in the coffin
when you climbed in?

33
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,964
Yes. What?

34
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,551
-I didn’t climb in, though.
-How did you end up in the coffin, sir?

35
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,345
-I was put here.
-In the coffin?

36
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,889
Yes. Please, help.

37
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,642
-And you’re saying the coffin is buried?
-Yes. Yeah.

38
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,977
I'm a truck driver.
I'm an American.

39
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,397
It's hot in here, and I can't breathe.

40
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,066
-Please.
-Do you know your location, sir?

41
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,985
-I told you, somewhere in Iraq. Please, help.
-Iraq?

42
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,947
Yes. I'm a truck driver.
I'm an American. I work for CRT.

43
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,366
-Are you a soldier; sir?
-No, please, you have to listen to me.

44
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,243
I'm a truck driver.
I'm an American.

45
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:26,122
I’m a civilian contractor working in Iraq.
We were attacked in Baqubah.

46
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:30,042
And they... They shot all of them.

47
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:32,753
-They shot who, sir?
-All of the other drivers.

48
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:35,005
And you are saying this happened in Iraq?
The country?

49
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,174
Yeah. Please, listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.

50
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:41,011
They gave me a safety number and it was in
my wallet, and I don't know where it is now.

51
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:45,224
Mn Conroy this is 911 emergency
in Youngstown, Ohio.

52
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,476
-Ohio?
-Yes, sir.

53
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,230
I'm not sure exactly how you called here
if you're in another country but if you'd like,

54
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,773
I can patch you through
to the sheriff's department.

55
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,443
You don't understand. Forget it.

56
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:07,204
Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay.

57
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:22,219
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

58
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:25,806
Pick up.

59
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,520
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.

60
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:34,690
Please leave a message after the beep.
Thanks!

61
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,609
Yeah, Linda. Linda, honey, it's me.

62
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:40,321
I need you... I need you... I need you to
contact the National Guard right away,

63
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,822
or the Pentagon.

64
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:46,494
Tell them that we were attacked
in the Diyala province, in Baqubah.

65
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,662
They need to find me. Okay?

66
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,707
Please, baby,
you've got to help them find me.

67
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,008
-Hi, this is Linda.

68
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,220
Please leave a message.
Thanks and have a great day.

69
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,597

on your screen right away. Okay?

72
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:15,064
I don't know what the hell is going on, but...

73
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,483
...I'm buried in a box.

74
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:20,277
I'm buried in a box.

75
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,323
I can't breathe in here.

76
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,285

I don't know. The FBI,
wherever they are.

79
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:24,550
Do you have a specific city

80
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,760
Anywhere. Any city.

85
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:41,525

-Is this the FBI?
-Yes, it is, sir.

95
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,725
Okay. I'm calling from Iraq.

96
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,602
I'm buried in the desert somewhere.
I need you to help me.

97
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,020
Whoa. Whoa. Sin slow down.

98
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,813
-When were you in Iraq?
-Now.

99
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,649
Now. I'm there now. I'm a truck driver.

100
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,151
I work for CRT.
I've been here for nine months.

101
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,488
-May I have your name, please, sir?
-it's Paul Conroy.

102
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,864
-Paul Conroy.

103
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:29,948
Yeah.

104
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,117
Okay Paul, explain to me what's going on.

105
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,328
All right, all right. Okay.

106
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,123
All right, me and a convoy of other drivers

107
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:41,085
were delivering some kitchen supplies
to a community center.

108
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,963
And then some kids,
they started throwing rocks at the trucks.

109
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:50,135
And then, an IED went off up ahead
and it blew up one of the other trucks.

110
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,389
And then these guys,
they came out from behind the houses

111
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:56,266
and they started shooting everyone
right there on the street.

112
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,852
-Were you shot at?
-I don't know.

113
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:01,480
I don't know.
I was way in the back of the convoy.

114
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,774
I guess I got hit in the head
by one of the other...

115
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,444
By one of the rocks and I blacked out,
and that's the last thing that I remember.

116
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,906
And then I woke up here,
tied up, in a coffin.

117
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,534
-Who put you there?
-I guess whoever ambushed us.

118
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,536
-A bunch of kids?
-No. No, no, no, no, no.

119
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,372
Some kids, the kids,
they threw the rocks at us.

120
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:22,209
These guys, some Iraqis, some insurgents.
I don't fucking know.

121
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,628
They just... They popped out
and they started shooting everybody...

122
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,172
-right there on the street.
-I thought you said they didn't shoot at you.

123
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,507
They didn't! I don't know.
They shot them!

124
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,217
Sin you're gonna have to stop shouting.

125
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,511
I'm shouting
because you're not listening to me!

126
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,471
I need you to help me!

127
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,517
Okay. Okay, okay. I got it.

128
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:43,230
Can you trace the call?
GPS or something?

129
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,817
Why is it that they didn't shoot you?

130
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,989
I don't know. I have no idea.
They didn't. That's all I know.

131
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,201
What’s your social security number, Paul?

132
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,245
Why?

133
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,873
Why? Who cares?

134
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,666
I'm buried in the middle of the fucking desert,

135
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,543
who cares
what my social security number is?

136
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,755
I'm an American citizen.
Just send someone to find me.
Please!

137
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,257
Do you have any idea where...

138
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,342
What? Hold on, hold on.
I can't hear you.

139
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,554
What did you...
Hold on, hold on. No, no, no. I can't...

140
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,098
Shit!

141
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,894
Fuck.

142
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:30,778
Come on.

143
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,674
Thank you for calling
Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

144
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:53,967
How may I direct your call?

145
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,928
Somebody.
I need to talk to somebody right away.

146
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,138
-It's an emergency.
-Who is this, please?

147
00:18:58,222 --> 00:18:59,556
It's Paul Conroy.

148
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,850
I'm a driver for you guys.
I'm calling from Iraq.

149
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,394
-My convoy was attacked.
-Sin if this is a crisis situation,

150
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,146
you need to contact
the safety number you were...

151
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,314
I know. I know. I know.

152
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,274
I don't have it anymore.
The people took it.

153
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,317
Who took it, sir?

154
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,320
I don't... I don't know. The Iraqis, I think.
I blacked out.

155
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,656
I'm going to ,out you through

-Who's that?
-Director of personnel. Please hold.

157
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,995
Personnel? No, no, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,376

00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,549

161
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:34,883
-As the...

162

This is Paul Conroy.
I'm from Hastings, Michigan.

167
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,146
I'm a driver for CRT.

168
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,109
My convoy was ambushed by terrorists,
or insurgents. I don't know.

169
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,152
I don't know who it was.
And I'm stuck.

170
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:57,531
I'm buried in a coffin in the ground,
and I need help.

171
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,950
Please send help.
I'm begging you.

172
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,035
I think I'm in Baqubah
in the Diyala province.

173
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,746
I'm not sure.
Please. Please send help right away.

174
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,249
I can't breathe in here. I can't breathe.

175
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,042
I didn't know who else to call.
Please, send...

176
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,796
Fuck! Fuck!

Come on.

180
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:06,076
Hello? Is anybody there?

181
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,412
Hello?

182
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,710
-Hello?
- Breathe no breathe, American?

183
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,837
-Breathe no breathe?
-Wait, wait. Hold... Hold on.

184
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,089
I don't know what you're saying.
Who is this?

185
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,716
American can breathe no breathe?

186
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,843
No, I can't breathe.
Please get me out of here.

187
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,344
-Get out?
-Yeah, yeah. Get me out.

188
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,179
Get me out. Please help.

189
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,515
-Soldier
-No, no. I'm not a soldier.

190
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:31,268
I'm a truck driver.
Just a contractor.

191
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,311
-Contractor?
-Yeah, yeah, a contractor.

192
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,022
That's all. No soldier.

193
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,315
-Blackwater
-No. Not for Blackwater.

194
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,694
I'm not a security contractor.
I'm just a truck driver. That's all.

195
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,571
-You American?
-Yeah.

196
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,032
Then you soldier

197
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,037
No, I'm not.

198
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:56,001
I'm here, unarmed.
But you still shot at us.

199
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,546
In head and in throat,
so you tell no more lies.

200
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,716
No, I'm not lying. We were all drivers.

201
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,177
-Drive what?
-Trucks. Trucks.

202
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,928
The trucks you see driving around
with supplies.

203
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:10,307
That's me. That's us. That's all.
Not a soldier. Truck driver.

204
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,643
-Five million, money.
-What?

205
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:18,398
Five million, money tonight, 9:00 p.m.,
or you stay. Buried like dog.

206
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,694
-$5 million? From who?
-Your family.

207
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:26,907
My family doesn't have $5 million.
If they did, I wouldn't be here.

208
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,575
From embassy.

209
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:33,663
I don't know.
Yeah, yeah, from the embassy.

210
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:37,584
If you let me out of here,
they'll pay you the money. Yeah.

211
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,670
9:00 p.m., five million, money.

212
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:55,073
Oh, God. What's your number?

213
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,085
- What city and listing, please?
-Hastings, Michigan.

214
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,795
I'm looking for Donna Mitchell.

215
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,009
I have two Donna Mitchells, sir.

216
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:17,512
One on Federal Road
and one on Ardmore Avenue.

217
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:21,057
Ardmore Avenue. I think. No. Shit!

218
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,726
I don't know.
Yeah, just give me that one.

219
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,562
-Ardmore Avenue?
-Yes, Ardmore Avenue.

220
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,148
Please hold for your number

221
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,816
The number you requested...

222
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,987
269-148

223
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,741

224
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,372

225
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,167
Where is everybody?

226
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,381
- Hello?
-Donna, it's Paul.

227
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,675
-Hey. How's it going?
-Okay.

228
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,845
I need to talk to Linda.
She's not answering her phone.

229
00:27:58,928 --> 00:27:59,888
I've got a problem.

230
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,389
I've been held hostage
by a group of guys that...

231
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,892
Fooled you. I'm not really home.

232
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:07,520
But if you leave a message, i'll get back
to you as soon as I get in. Bye-bye.

233
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,775
Donna, I need to talk to Linda.
It's an absolute emergency.

234
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,152
Have her call me. Use star 69
to find out the number of this phone

235
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:15,987
and have her call me at this number, okay?

236
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,864
- Paul?
-Donna.

237
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:20,617
-What do you want?
-I need to talk to Linda. Where is she?

238
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,660
I don't know. I haven 't talked to her all day.
Call her cell. ..

239
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,788
-Are you at your computer right now?
-Yeah. Why?

240
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:28,291
Okay, I need you to look up a number for me
to the State Department.

241
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,710

- What?
-Donna, I'm very sorry that I yelled at you.

254
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,346
I shouldn't have done that.

255
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,557
But I'm only going to ask you one more time
to get me this number,

256
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,143
and if you don't, I'm gonna die.

257
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:30,311
-What?
-Please, I don't have time to explain.

258
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,981

00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,622

264
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,717
United States Department of State.

265
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,470
I'm an American citizen, working in Iraq.
I've been taken hostage.

266
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:05,972
-I need to speak to someone right away.
-Where are you calling from, sir?

267
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:10,059
From Iraq. I'm a truck driver.
I work for CRT.
Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

268
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,604
My convoy was attacked
and I'm being held for ransom.

269
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:15,482
-Are the kidnappers with you?
-No. I'm buried somewhere.

270
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,609
-You're buried?
-Yeah. Yeah, in a coffin.

271
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,486
It's a wooden box, an old wooden coffin.

272
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,362
Did you try contacting the military out there?

273
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,865
They gave me a number to call,
a safety number.

274
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,992
-But the people took it.
-The people holding you hostage?

275
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:28,161
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-I don't know.

276
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,830
-Hold on. Let me connect you...
-No, don't put me on hold! No!

277
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:42,217
-Rebecca Browning.
-Hello?

278
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,552
Yes, hello.
I was just informed of your situation.

279
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,845
Yeah, my situation.

280
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,764
I'm running out of time
and you guys keep putting me on hold.

281
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,516
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-I'm sorry.

282
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,683
Don't be sorry. Just help me.

283
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,477
I just have a few questions for you,
Mn Conroy.

284
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,104
-You've got to be kidding me.
-it's important that I get this information.

285
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:58,483
-It’ll help make a rescue attempt...
-Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.

286
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,652
-How do you know my name?
-I'm sorry?

287
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:05,448
My name, I didn't give it to you.
I didn't give it to the other guy either.

288
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,534
What's going on right now?

289
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:11,621
We received a call from a representative
at CRT. You left him a message?

290
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,206
-Yeah?
-He contacted us right away.

291
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:14,415
So if you know what the hell is going on,

292
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,667
then what have you done
to get me out of here?

293
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,752
Well, there 's little we can do
from Washington.

294
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,421
So that's it?
I'm just supposed to sit here and rot

295
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,589
because there's little you can do?

296
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:22,674
-No.
-Then what?

297
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:25,051
I need to know where you were
when your convoy was ambushed.

298
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,345
-In Baqubah, in the Diyala province.
-Okay.

299
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,055
And has contact been made
with the kidnappers?

300
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,724
Yeah. The guy says he wants $5 million
by 9:00 tonight.

301
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,726
Okay or else...

302
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,271
Or else he'll take me to SeaWorld.

303
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,983
-What the hell do you think, lady?
-We'll do everything we can.

304
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:42,318
So you'll pay them then? Yeah?

305
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,445
-No. That we can't do.
-Wait, wait. Why?

306
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:46,030
It’s the policy
of the United States government

307
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,365
to not negotiate with terrorists.

308
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:48,825
Not the policy of the
United States government?

309
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,243
Lady, come on!

310
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,787
You're sitting in an air conditioned office,
this is easy for you to say.

311
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,124
You're not the one stuck in a coffin,
buried in the goddamn desert!

312
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,876
-I understand your frustration...
-Frustration?

313
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,463
Lady, I'm going to fucking die in here.
Understand that?

314
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,264
-Hello?
-I'm here.

315
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,933
Then say something.
Tell me how you can get me out of here.

316
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,018
Okay.

317
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,562
What's the number on the phone
that you're calling from?

318
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,648
-I don't Know. Did it come up on your end?
-No. it's listed as unavailable.

319
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,859
Tell me this, can you remember a number?

320
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,777
Yeah. No. I have a... I have a pencil.

321
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:27,697
-Okay write this down.
-Okay, just a sec.

322
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:30,617
Okay. Go ahead.

323
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,201
-410...
-Yeah.

324
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:33,536
...195...

325
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,581
-5453.
-5453.

326
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,708
-Who's that?
-That's Dan Brenner

327
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:42,545
He's the commander of the hostage
working group over in Iraq.

328
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:44,964
Hostage working group?

329
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:48,635
Formed it in 2004
to deal with situations such as yours.

330
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:51,929
Situations.
I love how you keep calling it that.

331
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,473
-Did you write down the number?
-Yeah.

332
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,850
Good. Now, just hold on,
I 'll connect you with him now.

333
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:58,436
-He should be expecting you.
-What about the news? I wanna call them.

334
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,812
No, don't call the news.

335
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,356
-I repeat, do not contact the news.
-Why?

336
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:03,232
-It will only complicate things further..
-That's bullshit.

337
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:04,984
-You're just covering your own ass.
-No, I'm covering yours.

338
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,736
You don't go looking for something
you don't know is missing.

339
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:07,820
Everyone who needs to know
about this does.

340
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:10,448
-I need all the help I can get.
-We are running out of time, Paul.

341
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:13,951
That's why you need to contact Dan Brenner
right away.

342
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:15,745
Fine.

343
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,623
I'm transferring you now.

344
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,729
-Brenner
-Dan Brenner?

345
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,357
-ls this Paul Conroy?
-Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Paul.

346
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,275
Paul, I was informed of what's going on.

347
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,612
I want you to know that we're already
working on trying to get you out of there.

348
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:50,863
Thank you, God.

349
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:53,825
I was told that we have until 9:00 p. m.
ls that right?

350
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,034
-That's what he said.
-All right.

351
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,120
That doesn't give us a whole lot of time.

352
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:00,081
And just so I have this right,
the kidnappers buried you in the ground?

353
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,290
Yeah. It's an old, wooden coffin.

354
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:04,460
Okay my guess is that
since you're able to get a cell signal,

355
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:07,171
-you're no more than a few feet underground.
-Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

356
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:10,299
What about battery life?
How much does the phone have left?

357
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:14,971
-It's just less than half.
-Okay you have to conserve that battery.

358
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,890
Our best bet of finding you
by tracking your cell signal.

359
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:21,185
-ls the ringer set on a sound or vibrate?
-Vibrate.

360
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,438
I need you to press
and hold down the asterisk key

361
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:26,107
to change it to a ring tone.
It will use less power

362
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,776
-What about my Zippo?
-You have a lighter?

363
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,404
-Yeah.
-Use it to look around for markings,

364
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,072
logo, whatever you can find.
-Won’t it use up oxygen?

365
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:34,741
Don 't worry about that now.
Just try to find...

366
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:37,118
-It's just so dark in here without it.
-I understand, Paul.

367
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:41,289
Try to find anything in there that
might indicate where that coffin was made.

368
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:44,751
-You guys have to hurry.
-We're working as fast as we can, Paul.

369
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,544
Do you Know
if there were any other survivors?

370
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:48,463
-From your convoy?
-Yeah .

371
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,673
Still unclear at this point.

372
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,593
I just wanted to do right by my family.
That's all.

373
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:56,971
I didn't know
it was going to be like this out here.

374
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,557
I don't think any of us did.

375
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,604
-That's him. He's calling.
-The kidnapper?

376
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,397
-Yeah. What should I do?
-You know his number?

377
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:07,523
-Yeah.
-Give it to me.

378
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,108
-Okay. What about the call?
-Give me the number first.

379
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:10,318
-He's going to hang up.
-Take the call.

380
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,029
-I... Okay.
-That's okay, just take the call.

381
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:15,198
Hello! Hello.

382
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,867
Two hour; four minute.

383
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:23,539
-You have to give me more time.
-You talk to embassy?

384
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,541
-Give the money?
-Yeah, yeah. I talked to someone.

385
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,335
The government.
They said that they won't pay the money.

386
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:28,544
-No pay?
-No.

387
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:30,588
They said they don't negotiate with terrorists.

388
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:33,049
Terrorists? I am terrorist?

389
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:36,719
Yeah.
Yeah. You're a terrorist, you son of a bitch.

390
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,222
You terrified, so I am terrorist?

391
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:42,058
What did I ever do to you?

392
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:43,976
-Ever do?
-Yeah.

393
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:49,398
Yeah. I'm here because it's a job,
to make money.

394
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:52,151
-That's it.
-I have job until you come.

395
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:54,654
-Now my family have nothing.
-That's not my fault!

396
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:59,158
9/11 was not my fault, but you still here.
Saddam was not my fault, but you still here.

397
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:02,078
I told you, I'm only here to work.
To help rebuild.

398
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,454
Rebuild what you destroyed.

399
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:08,000
Stop! Stop! Just please, stop!
I'm just a guy. I'm just a truck driver. Okay?

400
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,627
I'm nobody that makes decisions
about anything.

401
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,587
I just want to go home.

402
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,010
Hello?

403
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:22,306
-You make video. Ransom video.
-Yeah, yeah!

404
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,933
I'll make a video.
If you let me go, I'll make a video.

405
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,018
No. You make video now.

406
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,437
-What? How?
-Use video on phone.

407
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:32,567
Near foot. You read note near foot in box.

408
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,863
-I don't see it.
-Near foot.

409
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:39,365
-Read note inside box.
-Okay, okay.

410
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:43,369
-If I make the video, you let me go?
-Only if we get money.

411
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,038
Nobody's going to pay $5 million for me.

412
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:49,000
We take less. One million, money.

413
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,294
If they pay, you'll let me go?

414
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:55,172
One million, money.

415
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,465
OW!

416
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:07,049
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.

417
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:09,552
Please leave a message after the beep.
Thanks!

418
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:15,182
We’re sorry, your call
cannot be completed. Please, dial again.

419
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,392
Shit.

420
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:30,156
- Paul?
-Here's his number.

421
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,409
-Hold on. All right, go ahead.
-Okay. Hold on.

422
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:39,582
It's 07-902-24-921.

423
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:43,669
Okay. This is huge, Paul.
Unless they're using a cloned line,

424
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:46,505
we should be able to find
where this is coming from in minutes.

425
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,424
Okay. What about me?
Can you track my cell signal?

426
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,176
We 're having a lot of trouble with yours.

427
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:51,844
Seems to be an EDS line,

428
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,804
probably through
one of the Egyptian carriers.

429
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:55,639
What does that mean?

430
00:41:56,682 --> 00:42:00,186
-That it's just not going to be easy.
-He wants me to make a ransom video.

431
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:02,938
No. Hold off for as long as you can.

432
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:04,523
If it gets me out of here, I'm making it.

433
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:07,818
The last thing we want
is for this to end up all over Al Jazeera.

434
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:08,903
-We'?
- Yes.

435
00:42:08,986 --> 00:42:10,738
This can't turn into an international incident.

436
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:13,324
That's all you people care about, isn't it?
Don't you care about me?

437
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:14,450
-We do.
-What about me?

438
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,785
We do, Paul, we do. That's why we're here.

439
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:19,455
No, no, no, you don't!
You don't care about me.

440
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:20,623
You don't care about any of us.

441
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:23,000
I've had eight friends killed out here,
six of them today.

442
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,545
-Listen, Paul. You just...
-We don't have any guns, any armor.

443
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:28,797
-Nothing.
-That's because you're not soldiers.

444
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,549
Tell that to the people
who put me in this box!

445
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:33,844
-Paul, listen.
-Tell that to the people who shot my friends!

446
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:36,889
-We're doing the best we can.
-No, you're not! You're not!

447
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,432
-Okay, calm down.
-I've been out here nine months.

448
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,100
I know how it works. All you guys care about

449
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:41,894
is your secret plans
and your back-room politics.

450
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:43,270
You know, if I was a diplomat,

451
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:46,106
or a hostage working group leader,
or what the fuck your title is,

452
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,233
I'd be out of here by now.

453
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,069
But I'm not, so I'm just supposed to
sit in here, shut my mouth and die.

454
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:52,905
Okay, I need you to stay focused, Paul.

455
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:53,989
Fuck you, Dan.

456
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:56,909
Paul, listen to me.
Finding you is our primary concern.

457
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,911
Bottom line. And we 're searching for you

458
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:01,247
just as hard as we would be
for a four-star general,

459
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,415
so don't literally waste your breath
suggesting otherwise.

460
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:06,252
I can't... I can't...

461
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:07,753
Are you injured, Paul? Are you okay?

462
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,922
I don't know. Who are they?

463
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,674
The people who put me in here,
who are they?

464
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:15,177
They're just that, people.
No different from you and me.

465
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,930
-I'm not a terrorist.
-Neither are they.

466
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,014
How do you know?

467
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:23,185
If you were homeless, starving...
Actually I take that back.

468
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,480
If your family was homeless and starving,
what would you do for them?

469
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:29,566
-I wouldn't kill somebody.
-How can you be sure?

470
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,695
What difference does it make?

471
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:35,447
They're criminals, desperate ones at that.

472
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:38,033
They don't care about anything
other than getting the money.

473
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:39,994
So pay them, just pay them.

474
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:43,539
Trust me, if it was an option,
I would do that in a heartbeat.

475
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,961
How many others have there been?

476
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:50,462
-Since I got here?
-Yeah.

477
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:53,507
Dozens. Journalists, contractors, soldiers.

478
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:58,053
Dozens have been taken. it's one of
the only functioning businesses out here.

479
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,139
How many have you rescued?

480
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,688
-How many?
-Not many.

481
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,857
-Tell me their names.
-No.

482
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,986
-Any of them.
-Who?

483
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,905
Make me believe
that they really do matter to you.

484
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:18,907
That they really do matter to you.

485
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,286
-Mark White.
-Who was Mark White?

486
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:27,750
A kid from New Hampshire.
Twenty-six years old. Med student.

487
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,253
Came over here to help out local doctors.

488
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:33,130
What happened to him?

489
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:36,633
-Insurgents grabbed him.
-When?

490
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,385
About three weeks ago.

491
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:45,351
You remember his name?

492
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:47,519
I remember all their names.

493
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,940
Is he... Did he?

494
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:54,610
Yeah. Yeah, he's alive.

495
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:56,904
-Where is he now?
-Home.

496
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:00,491
Probably happy to be back at school.

497
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:05,496
I want to get out of here.

498
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:07,915
We found him. We’ll find you, too.

499
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,001
How?

500
00:45:11,377 --> 00:45:14,546
We already have a solid lead
on the number you gave us.

501
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,591
-You do?
-Yeah. A unit's on its way over there now.

502
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,968
That's good.

503
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:22,471
-That feels good.
-Yeah.

504
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:27,309
What... What should I do in the meantime?

505
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:30,229
I know it's hard, but try to relax.

506
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:33,524
The more worked up you are,
the more air you're going to use.

507
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:35,734
Okay, I know.

508
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:40,864
I know. it's hard, 'cause I have anxiety.

509
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:43,659
I take pills for it.

510
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:46,078
-Do you have them with you?
-Yeah.

511
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,162
Good. Take them.

512
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:50,249
You need to preserve your oxygen level
any way you can.

513
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:51,458
Okay.

514
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:55,254
-ls your Zippo still lit?
-No, not anymore.

515
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,756
-All right. Good.
-I feel nauseous.

516
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,591
-You have to calm down.
-Okay.

517
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,844
And you need to save that battery.

518
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:05,013
We 're expecting some intel
in about 10 minutes.

519
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:06,974
-Call me back then.
-Okay.

520
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:10,102
-Just hang in there, Paul.
-I'm trying, okay.

521
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,695
-What?
- You make video?

522
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:20,946
-No.
-You make video!

523
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,156
-Let me out and I'll make it.
-No!

524
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:23,949
-You make video now.
-I can't read the paper.

525
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:25,451
-Make video now!
-I can't.

526
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:27,327
I don't know what you want me to say.
I can't read the paper.

527
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:29,121
You make video! Now!

528
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:31,623
Fuck!

529
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,360
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on, come on.

530
00:47:01,278 --> 00:47:02,404
Come on!

531
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:05,782
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

532
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:39,608
Fuck.

533
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,141
Shit.

534
00:49:56,078 --> 00:49:58,080
Mountain View Nursing Home.

535
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:02,626
Hi. I was hoping that
I could speak with Maryanne Conroy, please.

536
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:05,087
Okay.

537
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:09,966
Let me bring the cordless phone to her room.
Hold on one moment, please.

538
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:20,477
Mrs. Conroy, you have e telephone cell, dean

539
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:22,938

544
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,910

545
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,538

546
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:41,832
-I'm fine.

547
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,459
Who are you?

548
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:47,504

549
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,465
-Paulie.
-Yeah .

550
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:56,304
Remember? Used to live on Colfax Street,
in the duplex. You remember?

551
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:58,849
-Paulie?
-Yeah .

552
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,936

00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:04,730
It is.

554
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:10,444
-How's everything at the home?
-Very nice.

555
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:14,823
Your father and I
have been playing Gin Rummy every night.

556
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:18,702
Yeah.

557
00:51:19,828 --> 00:51:21,830
I don’t think Pop’s there with you, Mom.

558
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:25,000
How are you doing, sweetie?

559
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:27,461
Not very good.

560
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:33,967
This might be the last time that I talk to you.

561
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,802
That's nice, honey.

562
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:41,516
Did you get the flowers I sent you
a few months ago?

563
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:46,730
-Flowers?
-Yeah, I sent you... Never mind.

564
00:51:48,774 --> 00:51:51,568
Look, I'm gonna get going now, okay?

565
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,905
I just wanted to call and talk to you.

566
00:51:55,614 --> 00:51:57,199
I love you, Mom.

567
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,745
I said, I love you, Mom.
Do you want to tell me that you love me?

568
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:06,249

580
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:23,034

00:53:23,118 --> 00:53:24,452
-You make video now!

-No, wait!

I'll make the video!
I'll make the video! Please, please, please.

586
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:34,629
I have to hang up now to make the video.
Is that okay?

587
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,132
You have three minute to send video.

588
00:54:01,156 --> 00:54:02,407
My name is Paul Conroy.

589
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,951
I'm an American citizen
from Hastings, Michigan.

590
00:54:05,035 --> 00:54:08,997
I'm a civilian truck driver
for Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

591
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,791
And I have been taken hostage
somewhere in Iraq.

592
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:15,837
I need $1 million by 9:00 tonight,
Baghdad time,

593
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:19,341
or I'll be left to die here in this coffin
that I'm buried in.

594
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:22,802
I'm told that if the money is paid...

595
00:54:24,763 --> 00:54:27,349
I'm told that if the money is paid,
I will be let go.

596
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:29,851
If it is not, I will be left to die here.

597
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:35,231
These threats are real
and will be followed through on.

598
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:56,464
Oh, my God.

599
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:03,805
I got you.

600
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:14,941
I got you, you motherfucker.

601
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,866
I got you. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

602
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:28,079
Fucking A. Okay.

603
01:02:34,085 --> 01:02:36,712
Come on, come on, come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

604
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:38,923
Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message.

605
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:41,217
Thanks and have a great day.

606
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,554
Linda, I figured out the number of the phone.
I got it.

607
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:46,597
I got it!

608
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:51,394
Okay. It's 0792-42-884.

609
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:55,148
Use the international calling code to dial it.
I got it, baby.

610
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,026
I love you. Call me as soon as you get this.
Call me. I love you.

611
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:04,407
Oh, shit.

612
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:07,702
Shit.

613
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,037
Okay.

614
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:53,831
Fuck. Come on.

615
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,304
Fuck.

616
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,420
My name is Pamela Lutti.

617
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:44,131
I'm a food service worker at FOB Anaconda,

618
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:47,718
employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

619
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,850
My captors' requests have gone unanswered.

620
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,936
Please. Please, don’t!

621
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:16,831
My name is Pamela Lutti.

622
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:18,833
-Please, don’t!

623
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:24,589
If you’re buried in a coffin,
where are you calling from?

624
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:29,927
The number you requested,

625
01:05:30,011 --> 01:05:36,392
269-948-1998.

626
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:40,271
They're criminals,
desperate ones at that.

627
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:42,273
They don't care about anything
other than getting...

628
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:44,650
At CRT,
we work with our clients to provide...

629
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:46,944
Sin you're gonna
have to stop shouting.

630
01:05:51,699 --> 01:05:54,827
Five million, money
tonight, 9:00 p. m., or you stay.

631
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:57,997
Finding you is our primary concern.
Bottom line.

632
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:06,881
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.

633
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:09,675
Please, leave a message after the beep.
Thanks!

634
01:06:47,963 --> 01:06:49,924
Why the hell did you make that video?

635
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:52,635
-It's all a bunch of lies.
-What is?

636
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:53,969
What are you talking about?

637
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:56,097
-All Of it.
-All Of What?

638
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:59,767
You don't give a shit about any of us.
We're nothing to you people.

639
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,644
We’re going to find you.I

640
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:04,021
Fuck off, Dan. You're babysitting.

641
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:06,649
Just gonna stay on the phone with me
until I die.

642
01:07:06,732 --> 01:07:09,026
Okay.
You can’t start breaking on me now, Paul.

643
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:13,030
-You have to stay strong.
-They shot her and you didn't do anything.

644
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:15,408
We didn't even know
she'd been taken hostage.

645
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:18,703
-She sent three videos.
-Yeah. That's what they told her to say.

646
01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:20,621
-Why?
-I don't know.

647
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,957
What do you know?

648
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:28,629
That your ransom video
already has 47,000 hits on YouTube.

649
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:33,259
And all the major networks are playing it,
including Al Jazeera.

650
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:36,804
So now your captors have no choice
but to follow through.

651
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:39,306
I found out the number to this phone.

652
01:07:40,391 --> 01:07:42,351
-How?
-Who cares?

653
01:07:43,352 --> 01:07:45,688
I figured it out and you didn’t. Why?

654
01:07:48,399 --> 01:07:50,025
Because I didn't.

655
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:52,570
Just like you and every other person
on the planet,

656
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:55,823
there are some things I know,
and there are some things I don't.

657
01:07:57,825 --> 01:07:59,869
Then how am I ever gonna get out of here?

658
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:04,165
Their signal was cloned, like we figured.
But we're close. Really close.

659
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:08,335
I'm near a mosque.

660
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:11,255
I heard a call to prayer over the PA.

661
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:14,550
Good. Good.
That means that we're in the right area.

662
01:08:15,176 --> 01:08:16,177
You're...

663
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:18,596
You're nearby?

664
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:23,559
I spoke with soldiers from the 3rd ID
who were escorting your convoy.

665
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,061
They're alive?

666
01:08:26,604 --> 01:08:30,524
Not all of them.
Both Bradley tanks were hit with IEDs.

667
01:08:31,025 --> 01:08:33,611
The rest got caught in small arms fire

668
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:37,364
What the hell happened out there, Paul?

669
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,074
Paul?

670
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:40,868
--Wait.

671
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:42,453
Paul?

672
01:09:27,832 --> 01:09:28,916
FUCK!

673
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,187
Come on. Come on.

674
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:54,441
Come on. Come on. Come on.

675
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:56,485
--Come on.

676
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:57,987
Hello?

677
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:00,406
- Hello, who's there?
- ls this Paul Conroy?

678
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:02,575
Yeah, yeah, yeah. it's Paul. Who are you?

679
01:10:02,658 --> 01:10:04,451
Paul, my name 's Alan Davenport.

680
01:10:04,577 --> 01:10:07,037
I'm the Personnel Director
here at Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

681
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:08,289
Yeah, yeah. I left you a message.

682
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:12,251
You did. I also heard from Rebecca Browning
over at the State Department.

683
01:10:12,334 --> 01:10:14,378
Are you able to speak
on the status of your situation?

684
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:18,340
It's worse. There was an explosion or
something, and the sand's coming through.

685
01:10:18,424 --> 01:10:20,926
I probably have about half an hour
before it fills right up.

686
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:23,387
Slow down. You should try to stay calm.

687
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:25,973
0 CD 0 CD 0.
Q)

688
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:29,560
The hostage-takers, Dan Brenner
from the hostage working group...

689
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:32,438
Okay, Paul. I'm with you.
Now, how about the media?

690
01:10:32,521 --> 01:10:33,898
I know your ransom video leaked,

691
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:36,066
but have you spoken directly to anyone
about what's going on?

692
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:37,568
-No. No, no, no, no.
-Good, good, good, good.

693
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:38,944
It needs to stay that way.

694
01:10:39,028 --> 01:10:42,323
It's important we keep this situation
as contained as possible.

695
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:44,575
The situation is in a coffin!

696
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:47,912
I think it's pretty contained!
Help me! Help me!

697
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:49,914
What are you doing right now to help me?

698
01:10:49,997 --> 01:10:52,333
I know you're upset.
But from what I've been told,

699
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:55,419
they're extremely close
to getting you out of there.

700
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:57,379
So hopefully it won't be too much longer

701
01:10:57,463 --> 01:11:00,716
-Thank God.
-Yeah, thank God.

702
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:05,346
Now, I'm going to switch on a recorder
right now.

703
01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:07,556
-What?
-Just a second.

704
01:11:10,643 --> 01:11:12,227
This is Alan Davenport,

705
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:16,231
Personnel Director
at Crestin, Roland and Thomas Incorporated.

706
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,693
The date is October 23, 2006.

707
01:11:19,777 --> 01:11:22,863
I'm speaking with Paul Conroy.

708
01:11:22,947 --> 01:11:26,992
Mr Conroy are you aware
that I'm recording this conversation?

709
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:29,536
-What?
-Please answer the question.

710
01:11:29,662 --> 01:11:31,372
-Shit.
-Mn Conroy?

711
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:32,581
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

712
01:11:32,665 --> 01:11:34,792
And do I have your permission to do so?

713
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:37,503
Why do you need my permission?
What's this about?

714
01:11:37,586 --> 01:11:39,296
I need you to answer yes or no, please.

715
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,548
-Yes! Yes, all right?
-Thank you.

716
01:11:41,632 --> 01:11:44,510
Now, Mr Conroy,
when were you hired by CRT?

717
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:47,972
I don't... Nine months ago.
Around January. What is all this?

718
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:51,308
I have your official date of hire
as January 4th.

719
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:52,977
-ls that correct?
-Who cares?

720
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,561
This is fucking crazy.

721
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:57,606
-January 4th. ls that correct?
-Yes!

722
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:01,026
And during your initial training,
before being sent to Iraq,

723
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:05,239
you were made aware of the dangers inherent
to the position for which you were hired.

724
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:08,242
You mean when I came down there to Dallas,
and you guys said that all of the trucks

725
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,369
would be armored
and have bulletproof glass?

726
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:13,247
You mean when you told us
that things were safer than ever over here?

727
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,832
Is that when...
Is that when I was made aware?

728
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:17,668
I need you to answer yes or no, please.

729
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:19,378
Yes.

730
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:24,383
During that time, did you also receive
and sign an employment contract with CRT,

731
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:26,552
which thoroughly explained company policy

732
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,429
as it pertained
to your specific terms of employment?

733
01:12:28,554 --> 01:12:30,264
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I signed a bunch of things. Yeah.

734
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:34,143
-Yes or no?
-Yes! I signed the contract. Yes.

735
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:36,937
It's our understanding
that you were taken hostage in Iraq

736
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:39,148
two hours ago, is that also correct?

737
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:42,860
Yes! I think that’s a fair assessment of the situation,
you fucking dick.

738
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,194
What's the point of all this?

739
01:12:44,278 --> 01:12:48,407
Our legal department requires that
we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees,

740
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:53,495
confirming that they understand the reasons
for their forced separation from the company.

741
01:12:53,579 --> 01:12:57,249
As of this morning, your employment with CRT was officially terminated.

742
01:12:57,332 --> 01:12:59,668
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. What?

743
01:12:59,752 --> 01:13:02,171
It was brought to our attention
that you were engaging

744
01:13:02,254 --> 01:13:06,383
in relations with a fellow CRT employee,
Pamela Lutti.

745
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:09,803
-No. No, no. Hold on, hold on.
-Stipulated in your contract

746
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:13,557
was a fraternization clause,
in which it was stated quite clearly

747
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,184
-that any relationship...
-Stop, stop, stop. Please.

748
01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:17,436
...be it romantic or sexual in nature...

749
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,063
-We were just friends.
-. . . deemed inappropriate

750
01:13:19,146 --> 01:13:21,899
by CRT senior officials
is grounds for immediate termination.

751
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:24,902
Hold on. Okay?
We were just friends. We were just friends.

752
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:27,571
-Our records indicate differently.
-Your records are wrong.

753
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:29,948
We 're also legally required to inform you

754
01:13:30,032 --> 01:13:32,076
that because you were technically no longer

755
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,621
under the employ of CRT
at the time of your abduction,

756
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:38,165
we cannot be held accountable for any injury

757
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:42,920
that may befall upon you after
your official date and time of termination.

758
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:46,256
Therefore, in your case,
that includes this incident,

759
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:49,051
or any consequences that may result from it.

760
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:54,473
What about my insurance money?
My family's gonna need that money.

761
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:58,227
Given that you were alive
up until the time of your termination...

762
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,853
Don't do this.

763
01:14:00,771 --> 01:14:03,107
-Do you understand everything?
-Don't do this!

764
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:06,485
Do you understand
everything you've been told, Mn Conroy?

765
01:14:10,197 --> 01:14:11,782
Mn Conroy?

766
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:15,369
You're a piece of shit.

767
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,998
That concludes our interview
with Paul Conroy.

768
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:22,376
I am now turning off the recorder

769
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:26,630
You put me here.

770
01:14:31,135 --> 01:14:32,469
I'm sorry.

771
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:30,420
Answer the phone.
Answer the phone.

772
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:53,527
Come on. Why won't you answer the phone?

773
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:10,687
Paul, is that you?

774
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:12,272
They're dead.

775
01:18:12,481 --> 01:18:14,566
-How do you know that?
-I just do.

776
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:18,862
Three F-16s leveled parts of the city
a few minutes ago.

777
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:20,947
Yeah, I know.

778
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:23,116
Yeah, that was fun for me.

779
01:18:26,453 --> 01:18:28,455
Did they know I was here?

780
01:18:29,915 --> 01:18:31,833
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

781
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:34,544
Did they care?

782
01:18:39,758 --> 01:18:43,678
These people that took me, if they're dead,

783
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,140
they can't tell you where I am.

784
01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:50,352
We can still try to track down your signal.

785
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:53,313
You tried that already.

786
01:18:53,522 --> 01:18:55,482
We can try again.

787
01:19:04,032 --> 01:19:06,410
-It's over, isn't it?
-No.

788
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,998
Yeah.

789
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:19,172
What should I do?

790
01:19:21,842 --> 01:19:23,176
I don't know.

791
01:19:25,262 --> 01:19:26,638
It's weird.

792
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:29,015
What is?

793
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:32,185
Knowing.

794
01:19:35,522 --> 01:19:38,316
I wish this could have gone differently Paul.

795
01:19:40,444 --> 01:19:41,778
Yeah.

796
01:19:44,448 --> 01:19:45,824
Me, too.

797
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:05,552
My name is Paul Steven Conroy.

798
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:12,934
Social security number, 048-32-1198.
Date of birth. 3/23/76.

799
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:19,941
This video will serve as my last will
and testament.

800
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:23,612
Um...

801
01:20:25,572 --> 01:20:27,782
To my wife, Linda Conroy,

802
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:32,370
I leave you the $700 in my personal savings,

803
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:37,751
and whatever's left in my annuity.

804
01:20:39,044 --> 01:20:42,923
To my son, Shane Conroy,

805
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:48,428
I don’t know

806
01:20:49,763 --> 01:20:52,974
I don't have... My clothes.

807
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:57,812
I leave you my clothes,
which you will grow into.

808
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:01,942
Not these ones.

809
01:21:05,946 --> 01:21:07,948
I don't really have...

810
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:12,035
I wish that I had more for you, but...

811
01:21:14,246 --> 01:21:18,250
Maybe if I was a famous baseball player,
or some guy who wore a suit to work...

812
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,629
Then I'd have more.

813
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:27,092
But, you know, you can be
one of those people if you want. Um...

814
01:21:28,802 --> 01:21:31,221
Yeah. Yeah.

815
01:21:32,222 --> 01:21:35,934
Just promise me that when you get older
that you'll take good care of your mom.

816
01:21:36,017 --> 01:21:38,728
And, I don't know.

817
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:42,816
You always try to do the right thing.

818
01:21:46,611 --> 01:21:48,947
I love you very much, Shane.

819
01:21:51,783 --> 01:21:56,413
Maybe I never said that enough. Maybe I did.
I don't know.

820
01:21:57,622 --> 01:22:00,667
That probably means I didn't. And...

821
01:22:08,174 --> 01:22:11,303
I'm sorry, Linda.
I should have listened to you.

822
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:22,374
You're not dead. Hello? Hello?

823
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:23,875
Where is money?

824
01:23:24,793 --> 01:23:26,461
-I don't know.
-What don't know?

825
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:28,004
-I don’t know where it is.
-Liar!

826
01:23:28,088 --> 01:23:29,547
No, I'm not lying! I swear.

827
01:23:29,631 --> 01:23:31,883
-Swear?
-Yeah, I swear.

828
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:33,510
-I'm telling the truth.
-From embassy.

829
01:23:33,593 --> 01:23:34,844
-No.
-You get money now!

830
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:36,012
-I can't!
-You will!

831
01:23:36,096 --> 01:23:37,889
-I need more time. Please.
-No more time!

832
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:39,516
There's sand pouring in here.

833
01:23:39,599 --> 01:23:42,977
It's everywhere. Let me out of here,
and I promise you I will get you the money.

834
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:44,854
-You show blood.
-What?

835
01:23:44,938 --> 01:23:47,357
-You show blood, they give money.
-No.

836
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,151
You cut finger; send video.

837
01:23:50,235 --> 01:23:51,945
-No, I'm not doing that.
-Yes!

838
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:53,029
-No.
-No?

839
01:23:53,113 --> 01:23:54,864
No, that's right, no. You let me out of here,

840
01:23:54,948 --> 01:23:56,741
and I'll out off my whole goddamn hand
if you want.

841
01:23:56,825 --> 01:23:58,243
-You have wife?
-Yeah, I do.

842
01:23:58,326 --> 01:24:01,204
And a son. I have a young son.
And I want to see them again. Please, sir.

843
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:02,539
-Sir?
-Yes. Sir.

844
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:04,082
I say that out of respect to you.

845
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:08,586
243, North Walnut Street.
Hastings, Michigan, USA.

846
01:24:08,795 --> 01:24:11,715
That's my... Why did you say that?

847
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,801
You show blood, or they show blood.

848
01:24:14,884 --> 01:24:17,929
No. You're nobody, all of you.

849
01:24:18,555 --> 01:24:19,597
You can't get to them.

850
01:24:19,681 --> 01:24:20,849
-No?
-No.

851
01:24:20,932 --> 01:24:23,393
You're peasants.
You're fucking criminals, that's all.

852
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:24,644
You don't even know where Michigan is.

853
01:24:24,728 --> 01:24:26,604
Detroit. Ann Arbor

854
01:24:26,688 --> 01:24:29,607
You looked at a map.
You looked at a map.

855
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:34,320
You show blood, or they show blood.
Send video by five minutes.

856
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:51,755
Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message.
Thanks and have a great day.

857
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:55,550
Linda! Linda, listen to me,
you and Shane have to go somewhere, okay?

858
01:24:55,633 --> 01:24:58,303
Do not go back to the house.
Do not go back to the house.

859
01:24:58,386 --> 01:25:00,930
Just go anywhere but to the house.
Okay? These guys, they know where we live.

860
01:25:01,014 --> 01:25:02,432
They have my driver's license.

861
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:05,894
Just go to the sheriff's station
if you have to, just do not go home.

862
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:12,358
Holy God.

863
01:25:13,193 --> 01:25:14,444
Fuck.

864
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:17,489
Fuck.

865
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:22,118
This is Daniel Brenner
Please leave a message at the tone.

866
01:25:22,202 --> 01:25:24,662
Brenner, where are you?
The guy's still alive!

867
01:25:24,746 --> 01:25:26,790
He just called me. He's still alive.

868
01:25:27,749 --> 01:25:28,750
Fuck.

869
01:25:31,669 --> 01:25:34,422
They can't find them. They can't.

870
01:25:35,507 --> 01:25:38,551
There's no way. No, no, no, no, no.

871
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,221
They can't find them. They can't find them.
They can't find them.

872
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,771
Fuck.

873
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,821
My name is Pamela Lutti.

874
01:25:58,613 --> 01:26:01,658
I'm a food service worker at FOB Anaconda,

875
01:26:01,991 --> 01:26:04,786
employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

876
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:08,206
My captors' requests have gone unanswered.

877
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:10,208
Please. Please, don’t!

878
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:17,882
Fuck.

879
01:27:46,763 --> 01:27:49,766
- Around to the other side!
- Move it, move it, move it!

880
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:51,184
I see him! Move it!

881
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:54,354
Get back! Everybody, get back!

882
01:27:55,271 --> 01:27:58,441
Civilian has been located. Civilian has been located.

883
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:00,693
Are you okay? Talk to me.

884
01:28:00,777 --> 01:28:02,737
Paul, are you okay?

885
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:22,048
Yeah?

886
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:23,967
-Paul? Paul, it’s Brenner.

887
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:27,428
-Are you there, Paul?
-I'm here?

888
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:30,598
We 're coming for you now.
You hear me? We know where you are.

889
01:28:30,682 --> 01:28:31,975
-You're coming?
-We are, Paul.

890
01:28:32,058 --> 01:28:34,310
-We 're almost there now.
-How do you know?

891
01:28:34,394 --> 01:28:37,730
Coalition forces picked up
a Shi'ite insurgent just outside of Baghdad.

892
01:28:37,814 --> 01:28:39,857
Said he knew
where an American was buried alive.

893
01:28:39,941 --> 01:28:41,943
He agreed to show us where if we let him go.

894
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:44,487
-You're coming for me?
-We are practically there already.

895
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,531
-You have... You have to hurry.
-We are, Paul.

896
01:28:46,614 --> 01:28:48,825
You have to hurry. The sand... The sand...

897
01:28:48,908 --> 01:28:50,702
You just hang in there three more minutes.

898
01:28:50,785 --> 01:28:52,745
This will all be over soon, I promise, Paul.

899
01:28:52,829 --> 01:28:54,330
Okay. Okay. I believe you.

900
01:28:54,414 --> 01:28:57,083
Three minutes, Paul.
I just need you to hang on for three minutes.

901
01:28:57,166 --> 01:28:59,085
-Thank you.
-This will all be over soon. I promise you...

902
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:01,671
-I have to go! Call me right back.
-No, no, no! Paul, Paul, Paul!

903
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:04,173
-Call me right back. Please!
-No, wait, Paul!

904
01:29:05,425 --> 01:29:07,760
Linda! Linda!

905
01:29:07,885 --> 01:29:10,221
Paul? Paul, is that you?

906
01:29:10,304 --> 01:29:12,223
-Tell me it's you.
-It's me.

907
01:29:12,306 --> 01:29:14,642
Oh, my God, Paul!
What are they doing to you?

908
01:29:14,726 --> 01:29:16,769
-Please tell me you're okay.
-I'm okay.

909
01:29:16,853 --> 01:29:19,313
I just saw the news.
I left my cell phone at home.

910
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:21,065
They know where I am.
They're coming to get me.

911
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:23,026
The Americans are coming for me.

912
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:24,777
-They are?
-it's going to be okay.

913
01:29:24,861 --> 01:29:26,988
Thank God. Thank God.

914
01:29:27,864 --> 01:29:30,366
They're coming. They're on their way.
