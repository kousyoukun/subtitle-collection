So if you know what the hell is going on,

295
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,660
那你們做了什麼來救我出去

296
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,750
我們從華盛頓能做到的不多
Well, there 's little we can do from Washington.

297
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,420

我只能在這裏等著腐爛而死?

00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,670
-不是的 -那怎樣?

-No. That we can't do. -Wait, wait. Why?

309
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,030
這是美國政府的政策
It's the policy of the United States government

310
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,360
永遠不跟恐怖分子談判
to not negotiate with terrorists.

311
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,820
不要跟我講美國政府的政策
Not the policy of the United States government?

312
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,240
小姐 求你了

You're not the one stuck in a coffin, buried in the goddamn desert!

329
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,700
-那是誰?-那是丹 布倫娜
-Who's that? -That's Dan Brenner

330
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,540
他是伊拉克人質解救小組的指揮官
He's the commander of the hostage working group over in Iraq.

331
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,960
人質解救小組?
Hostage working group?

332
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,630
在2004年成立來解決類似你這樣處境的人
Formed it in 2004 to deal with situations such as yours.

333

-他應該在等你電話會 -新聞媒體怎樣 我想打給他們
-He should be expecting you. -What about the news? I wanna call them.

338
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,350
-我重複 不要聯繫新聞媒體 -為什麼
-I repeat, do not contact the news. -Why?

339
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,230
-這只會讓情況更加糟糕 -屁話
-It will only complicate things further.. -That's bullshit.

340
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,980
-你只是想掩蓋你們的不作為 -不 我只是為了保護你
-You're just covering your own ass. -No, I'm covering yours.

341
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,730
你不去找某樣東西 你就不知道它不見了
You don't go looking for something you don't know is missing.

342
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,820
每個人都需要知道我到底怎樣了
Everyone who needs to know about this does.

343
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,440
-我需要一切幫助 -我們快沒時間了 保羅
-I need all the help I can get. -We are running out of time, Paul.

344
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,950
所以你要馬上聯繫丹 布倫娜
That's why you need to contact Dan Brenner right away.

345
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,740

-ls this Paul Conroy? -Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Paul.

349
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,270
保羅 我剛被告知你的情況
Paul, I was informed of what's going on.

350
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,610
我希望你知道我們早已經正在想法救你了
I want you to know that we're already working on trying to get you out of there.

351
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,860
謝謝 上帝
Thank you, God.

352
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,820
我被告知截止時間是今晚9點 對嗎?
I was told that we have until 9:00 p. m. ls that right?

353
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,030
-那就是綁匪說的 -好的
-That's what he said. -All right.

354
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,120
我們的時間不多
That doesn't give us a whole lot of time.

355
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,080
那些綁匪把你埋在了地下?
And just so I have this right, the kidnappers buried you in the ground?

356
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,290
是的 是一個老的木製棺材
Yeah. It's an old, wooden coffin.

357
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,460
所以我猜你的手機能夠收到信號
Okay my guess is that since you're able to get a cell signal,

358
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,170
-你被埋的應該只有幾尺深而已 -是啊 我不知道 應該是吧
-you're no more than a few feet underground. -Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

359
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,290
你的手機電量怎樣?還能維持多長時間
What about battery life? How much does the phone have left?

360
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,970
-隻剩下一半了 -好的 你必須省著點用
-It's just less than half. -Okay you have to conserve that battery.

361
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,890
我們最大的希望是通過跟蹤你的手機找到你
Our best bet of finding you by tracking your cell signal.

362
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:21,180
-鈴聲是設置在響鈴還是震動狀態? -震動
-ls the ringer set on a sound or vibrate? -Vibrate.

363
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,430
我需要你按住*號鍵不放
I need you to press and hold down the asterisk key

364
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,100
轉為響鈴狀態 這樣比較節約電
to change it to a ring tone. It will use less power

365
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,770
-那我的zippo呢?-你有一個打火機?
-What about my Zippo? -You have a lighter?

366
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,400
-是的 -用它來找找附近的標記
-Yeah. -Use it to look around for markings,

367
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,070
商標之類的 -這會燃燒掉氧氣嗎?
logo, whatever you can find. -Won't it use up oxygen?

368
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,740
現在不用擔心這個 試試找找
Don 't worry about that now. Just try to find...

369
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,110
-沒有打火機這裏好暗好暗 -我理解 保羅
-It's just so dark in here without it. -I understand, Paul.

370
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,280
試試找出能夠象徵棺材產地的標記
Try to find anything in there that might indicate where that coffin was made.

371
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,750
-你們要盡快 -我們已經在盡我們最大的努力了 保羅
-You guys have to hurry. -We're working as fast as we can, Paul.

372
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,540
你知道還有生還者嗎?
Do you Know if there were any other survivors?

373
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,460
-你的車隊的人嗎? -是的
-From your convoy? -Yeah .

374
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,670
這點還不清楚
Still unclear at this point.

375
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,590
我僅僅只是想做些對我家庭有用的事
I just wanted to do right by my family. That's all.

376
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,970
我不知道會發生今天這樣的事
I didn't know it was going to be like this out here.

Saddam was not my fault, but you still here.

404
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,620
我沒有權力做任何決定
I'm nobody that makes decisions about anything.

405
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,580
我只是想回家
I just want to go home.

406
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,010
喂?
Hello?

409
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,010

-如果我拍了視頻 你們讓我走?  -除非我們收到了錢
-If I make the video, you let me go? -Only if we get money.

415
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,030
沒人會為了我給這500萬美金的
Nobody's going to pay $5 million for me.

416
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,000
那我們拿少點 100萬
We take less. One million, money.

417
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,290
如果他們付錢 你會讓我走?

418
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,170
100萬

We're sorry, your call cannot be completed. Please, dial again.

422
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,390

00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,150
-保羅? -這是他的號碼

It's 07-902-24-921.

426
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:43,660
好的數據很龐大 除非他們使用克隆電話
Okay. This is huge, Paul. Unless they're using a cloned line,

427
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,500
我們可以在幾分鐘內查到這是在哪裏撥出的電話
we should be able to find where this is coming from in minutes.

428
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,420
好的 我呢?你能追蹤到我的手機信號嗎?
Okay. What about me? Can you track my cell signal?

429
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,170
追蹤你的手機我們遇到很多麻煩
We 're having a lot of trouble with yours.

430
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,840
看起來像是EDS的線路
Seems to be an EDS line,

431
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,800
或許是通過埃及中轉的
probably through one of the Egyptian carriers.

432
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,630
什麼意思?
What does that mean?

433
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,180
-就是追蹤你的電話很難 -他要我拍一個索取贖金視頻
-That it's just not going to be easy. -He wants me to make a ransom video.

434
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,930
不 盡量拖延時間
No. Hold off for as long as you can.

435
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,520
如果這能讓我離開這裏 我會拍的
If it gets me out of here, I'm making it.

436
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,810
我們最不想見到的就是這個視頻在半島電視播放
The last thing we want is for this to end up all over Al Jazeera.

437
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,900
-我們? -是的
-We'? - Yes.

438
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,730
這個不能成為國際性事故
This can't turn into an international incident.

439
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,320
這就是你們在意的?你們在意我嗎?
That's all you people care about, isn't it? Don't you care about me?

440
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,450
-我們當然在意 -我呢?
-We do. -What about me?

441
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,780
我們真的在意你 保羅 這就是我為什麼在這裏的原因
We do, Paul, we do. That's why we're here.

442
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,450
不 不 不 你們不在乎我
No, no, no, you don't! You don't care about me.

443
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,620
你不在乎我們任何人
You don't care about any of us.

444
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,000
我有8個朋友在外面被殺了 今天就死了6個
I've had eight friends killed out here, six of them today.

445
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,540
-聽著 保羅 -我們沒有槍 沒有武裝
-Listen, Paul. You just... -We don't have any guns, any armor.

446
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,790
-什麼都沒有 -那是因為你們不是軍人
-Nothing. -That's because you're not soldiers.

447
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,540
這話你去跟那些把我困在這裏的人
Tell that to the people who put me in this box!

448
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,840
-保羅 聽著 -去跟那些殺了我朋友的人說
-Paul, listen. -Tell that to the people who shot my friends!

449
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,880
-我們在盡最大的努力 -不 你們沒有
-We're doing the best we can. -No, you're not! You're not!

450
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,430
-請冷靜一點 -我來這裏9個月了
-Okay, calm down. -I've been out here nine months.

451
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,100
我知道的 你們這些人僅僅在乎
I know how it works. All you guys care about

452
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,890
你們的秘密計劃和後門政策
is your secret plans and your back-room politics.

453
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,270
你知道 如果我是一個外交官
You know, if I was a diplomat,

454
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,100
或者是人質解救小組的領導 或者哪個單位的領導
or a hostage working group leader, or what the fuck your title is,

455
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,230
我早就出去了
I'd be out of here by now.

456
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:50,060
但我不是 所以我只有坐在這裏 閉上我的嘴等死
But I'm not, so I'm just supposed to sit in here, shut my mouth and die.

457
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,900
我需要你注意力集中一點 保羅
Okay, I need you to stay focused, Paul.

458
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
草泥馬 丹
Fuck you, Dan.

459
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,900
保羅 聽我說 找到你是我們的首要大事
Paul, listen to me. Finding you is our primary concern.

460
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,910
底線是 找你就像
Bottom line. And we 're searching for you

461
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,240
找四星上將一樣努力
just as hard as we would be for a four-star general,

462
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,410
所以我建議你不要在浪費力氣了
so don't literally waste your breath suggesting otherwise.

463
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,250
我不能...我不能...
I can't... I can't...

464
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,750
你受傷了嗎 保羅 你還好嗎
Are you injured, Paul? Are you okay?

465
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,920
我不知道  他們是誰
I don't know. Who are they?

466
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,670
那些把我困在這裏的人是誰
The people who put me in here, who are they?

467
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,170
他們只是人 跟你我沒什麼區別
They're just that, people. No different from you and me.

468
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,930
-我不是一個恐怖分子 -他們也不是
-I'm not a terrorist. -Neither are they.

469
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,010
你怎麼知道
How do you know?

470
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,180
如果你也是無家可歸 挨餓...我收回那句話
If you were homeless, starving... Actually I take that back.

471
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,480
如果你的家庭買不起房  挨餓 你會為了他們做什麼
If your family was homeless and starving, what would you do for them?

472
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,560
-我不會殺人 -你怎麼能這麼肯定?
-I wouldn't kill somebody. -How can you be sure?

473
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,690
有區別嗎
What difference does it make?

474
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,440
他們是孤注一擲的罪犯
They're criminals, desperate ones at that.

475
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,030
除了錢 他們什麼都不在乎
They don't care about anything other than getting the money.

476
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,990
所以付錢 付給他們錢
So pay them, just pay them.

477
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:43,530
相信我 如果可以這麼做 我會毫不猶豫的給錢
Trust me, if it was an option, I would do that in a heartbeat.

478
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,960

01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:57,990
找到你是目前最緊急的事
DAN: Finding you is our primary concern. Bottom line.

635
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,880
感謝致電康羅伊一家 我們目前不在家
SHANE: Thanks for calling the Conroys. We're not home right now.

請在B一聲後留言 謝謝
Please, leave a message after the beep. Thanks!

637
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,920
為什麼你要拍那個視頻
DAN: Why the hell did you make that video?

638
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,630
-全都是一堆謊言 -什麼?
-It's all a bunch of lies. -What is?

639
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:53,960
你在說什麼
What are you talking about?

640
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,090
-全部 -什麼全部
-All Of it. -All Of What?

641
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:59,760
你根本就不在乎我們 我們對你們來說是個屁
You don't give a shit about any of us. We're nothing to you people.

642
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,640
我們會找到你的
We're going to find you.I

643
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,020
滾開 丹 你以為你是保姆嗎
Fuck off, Dan. You're babysitting.

644
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,640
你就陪我講電話直到我死去吧
Just gonna stay on the phone with me until I die.

645
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,020
你不能放棄啊 保羅
Okay. You can't start breaking on me now, Paul.

646
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:13,030
-你要堅強  -他們殺了她而你們什麼都沒做
-You have to stay strong. -They shot her and you didn't do anything.

647
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:15,400
我們不知道她被綁架了
We didn't even know she'd been taken hostage.

648
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:18,700
-她發了三段視頻 -是的  那是他們逼她這麼說的
-She sent three videos. -Yeah. That's what they told her to say.

649
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,620
-為什麼 -我不知道
-Why? -I don't know.

650
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,950
你知道什麼
What do you know?

651
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,670
你的要求贖金視頻在youtube上
That your ransom video already has

652
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:28,620
已經被點擊了47  000次了
47,000 hits on YouTube.

653
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,250
所有主流媒體包括半島電視台都在播放那個片段
And all the major networks are playing it, including Al Jazeera.

654
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,800
所以現在綁匪沒有選擇只能繼續堅持下去
So now your captors have no choice but to follow through.

655
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,300
我找到這台手機的號碼了
I found out the number to this phone.

656
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,350
-怎麼找的?  -誰在意?
-How? -Who cares?

657
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,680
我找到了 而你沒有找到 這是為什麼
I figured it out and you didn't. Why?

658
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,020
因為我沒有
Because I didn't.

659
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,570
就像你和其他在這個星球上的人
Just like you and every other person on the planet,

660
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:55,820
有些事我知道 有些事我不知道
there are some things I know, and there are some things I don't.

661
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,860
那我是不是永遠都出不去了?
Then how am I ever gonna get out of here?

662
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:04,160
正如我預料的 他們的信號是克隆的 我們就快找到了
Their signal was cloned, like we figured. But we're close. Really close.

663
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,330
我在一個清真寺附近
I'm near a mosque.

664
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:11,250
我聽到了擴音機上的祈禱文
I heard a call to prayer over the PA.

665
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:14,550
很好 那意味著我們在正確的區域內
Good. Good. That means that we're in the right area.

666
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,170
你在....
You're...

667
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:18,590
你在附近?
You're nearby?

668
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,550
我跟護送你們車隊的士兵談過
I spoke with soldiers from the 3rd ID who were escorting your convoy.

669
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,060
他們還活著?
They're alive?

670
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,520
不是全部 基本都被路邊的簡易炸彈炸傷了
Not all of them. Both Bradley tanks were hit with IEDs.

671
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,610
其餘的被一些流彈擊傷
The rest got caught in small arms fire

672
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,360
到底發生了什麼 保羅
What the hell happened out there, Paul?

673
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,070
保羅
Paul?

674
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:40,860
等等
Wait.

675
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,450
保羅
Paul?

676
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:28,910
我操
FUCK!

677
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,180
快 快
Come on. Come on.

678
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,440
快 快
Come on. Come on. Come on.

679
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,480
快
Come on.

680
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:57,980
喂
Hello?

681
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,400

Hello, who's there? ALAN: ls this Paul Conroy?

682
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,570
是的 我是保羅 你是誰
Yeah, yeah, yeah. it's Paul. Who are you?

683
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:04,450
保羅 我是阿蘭 達文普
Paul, my name 's Alan Davenport.

684
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:07,030
我是CRT公司的人事部主管
I'm the Personnel Director here at Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

685
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,280
嗯  我給你留了口信
Yeah, yeah. I left you a message.

686
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:12,250
是的 我也從政府部門的麗貝卡 布朗寧那裏聽說了
You did. I also heard from Rebecca Browning over at the State Department.

687
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:14,370
你現在的狀況可以說話嗎
Are you able to speak on the status of your situation?

688
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:18,340
更糟了 剛才好像有場爆炸 現在沙子開始灌進來了
It's worse. There was an explosion or something, and the sand's coming through.

689
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,920
估計還有半小時就能灌滿這裏了
I probably have about half an hour before it fills right up.

690
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:23,380
你應該嘗試冷靜下來
Slow down. You should try to stay calm.

691
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:29,560
那個綁匪 丹 布倫娜來自人質解救小組
The hostage-takers, Dan Brenner from the hostage working group...

692
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:32,430
好的 保羅 那些媒體怎樣了?
Okay, Paul. I'm with you. Now, how about the media?

693
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,890
我知道你的贖金視頻洩露了
I know your ransom video leaked,

694
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,060
但是你有跟其他人直接溝通過這件事嗎
but have you spoken directly to anyone about what's going on?

695
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:37,560
-沒有 沒有  -很好 很好
-No. No, no, no, no. -Good, good, good, good.

696
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,940
你必須這樣
It needs to stay that way.

697
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:42,320
把情況控制好是非常重要的
It's important we keep this situation as contained as possible.

698
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,570
目前的情況是我在一個棺材裏
The situation is in a coffin!

699
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:47,910
我想這控制的非常好 救我 救我
I think it's pretty contained! Help me! Help me!

700
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,910
你正在做什麼來救我
What are you doing right now to help me?

701
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:52,330
我知道你很沮喪 但是我被告知
I know you're upset. But from what I've been told,

702
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:55,410
他們距離你已經很近了
they're extremely close to getting you out of there.

703
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,370
所以希望不會太長時間
So hopefully it won't be too much longer

704
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:00,710
-謝謝上帝 -是啊 謝謝上帝
-Thank God. -Yeah, thank God.

705
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,340
現在 我要打開錄音機
Now, I'm going to switch on a recorder right now.

706
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,550
-什麼?  -等等
-What? -Just a second.

707
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,220

今天是2006年10月23日
The date is October 23, 2006.

710
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:22,860
我正在和保羅 康羅伊講話
I'm speaking with Paul Conroy.

711
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:26,990
康羅伊先生 我在錄這段話的時候你是否清醒?
Mr Conroy are you aware that I'm recording this conversation?

712
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:29,530
-什麼?  -請回答這個問題

我有得到你的允許嗎?
And do I have your permission to do so?

716
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,500
你為什麼需要我的許可?你到底在說什麼
Why do you need my permission? What's this about?

717
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,290

Now, Mr Conroy, when were you hired by CRT?

720
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:47,970
我不..9個月以前 大概在1月 到底怎麼了
I don't... Nine months ago. Around January. What is all this?

721
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:51,300
我這裏的官方記錄顯示你受雇於1月4號
I have your official date of hire as January 4th.

722
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,970

723
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,560
這真他媽的神經病

724
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,600
-1月4號 正確嗎  -正確
-January 4th. ls that correct? -Yes!

725
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:01,020
在你的前期訓練中  在被派遣到伊拉克前
And during your initial training, before being sent to Iraq,

726
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:05,230
你已經意識到了你所在的職位要承擔的風險
you were made aware of the dangers inherent to the position for which you were hired.

727
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,240
你指的是我去達拉斯時你們承諾的所有卡車
You mean when I came down there to Dallas, and you guys said that all of the trucks

728
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,360
都有武裝和防彈玻璃?
would be armored and have bulletproof glass?

729
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:13,240
你指的是你告訴我們這個比任何時候都安全?
You mean when you told us that things were safer than ever over here?

730
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,830
是那個時候..是那個時候我意識到的嗎?

731
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,660
我需要你回答 是還是不是
I need you to answer yes or no, please.

Yes.

733
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:24,380
在那個時候 你是否也收到和CRT
During that time, did you also receive and sign an employment contract with CRT,

734
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,550
簽署了詳細說明公司政策
which thoroughly explained company policy

735
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,420
和包含了特定條款的就業合同
as it pertained to your specific terms of employment?

736
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:30,260
是 是 是 我簽了一堆東西

738
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:36,930
我們也知道了2小時以前
It's our understanding that you were taken hostage in Iraq

739
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,140
你在伊拉克被劫持為人質  正確嗎?
two hours ago, is that also correct?

740
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:42,860
是 我認為那是對目前狀況相當客觀的評價 你個大屌哥
Yes! I think that's a fair assessment of the situation, you fucking dick.

741
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,190
這些有什麼意義?
What's the point of all this?

742
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:48,400
我們的法律部門要求要一份員工宣誓過的證詞
Our legal department requires that we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees,

743
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:53,490
來證明他們明白公司必須強制解除合同的原因
confirming that they understand the reasons for their forced separation from the company.

744
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:57,240
從今天早上起 你和CRT公司的合同已經被取消了
As of this morning, your employment with CRT was officially terminated.

745
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:59,660

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

746
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,170
我們注意到你和一位
It was brought to our attention that you were engaging

747
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:06,380
前CRT員工帕梅拉 拉蒂有關係
in relations with a fellow CRT employee, Pamela Lutti.

748
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:09,800
-不 不 不 等等 -你的合同有
-No. No, no. Hold on, hold on. -Stipulated in your contract

749
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:13,550
交友條款 裏面說的很清楚
was a fraternization clause, in which it was stated quite clearly

750
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,180
-任何....   - 等等 請等等
-that any relationship... -Stop, stop, stop. Please.

751
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,430
戀愛還是性關係...
...be it romantic or sexual in nature...

752
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:19,060
-我們只是朋友  -被認為是不恰當的
-We were just friends. -. . . deemed inappropriate

753
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,890
CRT有權立即終止合同關係
by CRT senior officials is grounds for immediate termination.

754
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,900
等等 好嗎  我們只是朋友
Hold on. Okay? We were just friends. We were just friends.

755
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:27,570
-我們的記錄可不是這樣 -你的記錄是錯的
-Our records indicate differently. -Your records are wrong.

756
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,940
我們也正式通知你
We 're also legally required to inform you

757
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,070
因為你從法律上來說
that because you were technically no longer

758
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:35,620
在你被綁架時你已經不是CRT的員工
under the employ of CRT at the time of your abduction,

759
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,160
所以我們不會負責解雇你後
we cannot be held accountable for any injury

760
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:42,920
