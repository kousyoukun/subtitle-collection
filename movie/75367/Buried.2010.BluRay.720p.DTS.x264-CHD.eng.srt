I shouldn't have done that.

321
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,557
But I'm only going to ask you one more time
to get me this number,

00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,143
and if you don't, I'm gonna die.

00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,470
I'm an American citizen, working in Iraq.
I've been taken hostage.

-Where are you calling from, sir?

From Iraq. I'm a truck driver.
I work for CRT.
Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

337
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,604
My convoy was attacked
and I'm being held for ransom.

-Are the kidnappers with you?
-No. I'm buried somewhere.

-You're buried?
-Yeah. Yeah, in a coffin.

00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,486
It's a wooden box, an old wooden coffin.

341
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,362
Did you try contacting the military out there?

342

a safety number.

-Hello?

00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,552
Yes, hello.
I was just informed of your situation.

349
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,845
Yeah, my situation.

350
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,764
I'm running out of time
and you guys keep putting me on hold.

351
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,516
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-I'm sorry.

352
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,683
Don't be sorry. Just help me.

353
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,477
I just have a few questions for you,
Mn Conroy.

-You've got to be kidding me.
-it's important that I get this information.

-It’ll help make a rescue attempt...
-Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.

00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,652
-How do you know my name?
-I'm sorry?

357
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:05,448
My name, I didn't give it to you.
I didn't give it to the other guy either.

358
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,534
What's going on right now?

359
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:11,621
We received a call from a representative
at CRT. You left him a message?

360
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,206
-Yeah?
-He contacted us right away.

361
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:14,415
So if you know what the hell is going on,

362
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,667
then what have you done
to get me out of here?

363
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,752
Well, there 's little we can do
from Washington.

364
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,421
So that's it?
I'm just supposed to sit here and rot

365
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,589
because there's little you can do?

366
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:22,674
-No.
-Then what?

367
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:25,051
I need to know where you were
when your convoy was ambushed.

368
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,345
-In Baqubah, in the Diyala province.
-Okay.

369
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,055
And has contact been made
with the kidnappers?

370
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,724
Yeah. The guy says he wants $5 million
by 9:00 tonight.

371
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,726
Okay or else...

372
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,271
Or else he'll take me to SeaWorld.

373
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,983
-What the hell do you think, lady?
-We'll do everything we can.

374
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:42,318
So you'll pay them then? Yeah?

375
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,445
-No. That we can't do.
-Wait, wait. Why?

376
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:46,030
It’s the policy
of the United States government

377
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,365
to not negotiate with terrorists.

378
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:48,825
Not the policy of the
United States government?

379
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,243
Lady, come on!

380
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,787
You're sitting in an air conditioned office,
this is easy for you to say.

381
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,124
You're not the one stuck in a coffin,
buried in the goddamn desert!

-I understand your frustration...
-Frustration?

(SIGHS) Okay.

388
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,562

that you're calling from?

389
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,648
-I don't Know. Did it come up on your end?
-No. it's listed as unavailable.

390
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,859

00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:30,617

to deal with situations such as yours.

I love how you keep calling it that.

402
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,473
-Did you write down the number?
-Yeah.

403
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,850

I 'll connect you with him now.

-What about the news? I wanna call them.

405
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,812
No, don't call the news.

406
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,356
-I repeat, do not contact the news.
-Why?

-It will only complicate things further..
-That's bullshit.

-You're just covering your own ass.
-No, I'm covering yours.

you don't know is missing.

about this does.

-Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Paul.

418
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,275
Paul, I was informed of what's going on.

419
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,612
I want you to know that we're already
working on trying to get you out of there.

Thank you, God.

421

ls that right?

-That's what he said.
-All right.

423
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,120
That doesn't give us a whole lot of time.

424
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:00,081
And just so I have this right,
the kidnappers buried you in the ground?

425
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,290
Yeah. It's an old, wooden coffin.

426
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:04,460
Okay my guess is that
since you're able to get a cell signal,

427
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:07,171
-you're no more than a few feet underground.
-Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

428
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:10,299
What about battery life?
How much does the phone have left?

429
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:14,971
-It's just less than half.
-Okay you have to conserve that battery.

430
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,890
Our best bet of finding you
by tracking your cell signal.

431
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:21,185
-ls the ringer set on a sound or vibrate?
-Vibrate.

432
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,438
I need you to press
and hold down the asterisk key

433
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:26,107
to change it to a ring tone.
It will use less power

434
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,776
-What about my Zippo?
-You have a lighter?

435
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,404
-Yeah.
-Use it to look around for markings,

436
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,072
logo, whatever you can find.
-Won’t it use up oxygen?

437
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:34,741
Don 't worry about that now.
Just try to find...

438
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:37,118
-It's just so dark in here without it.
-I understand, Paul.

439
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:41,289
Try to find anything in there that
might indicate where that coffin was made.

440
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:44,751
-You guys have to hurry.
-We're working as fast as we can, Paul.

441
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,544
Do you Know
if there were any other survivors?

442
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:48,463
-From your convoy?
-Yeah .

443
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,673
Still unclear at this point.

444
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,593
I just wanted to do right by my family.
That's all.

445
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:56,971
I didn't know
it was going to be like this out here.

446
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,557
I don't think any of us did.

461
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:33,049
Terrorists? I am terrorist?

462
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:36,719
(SCOFFING) Yeah.
Yeah. You're a terrorist, you son of a bitch.

463
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,222
You terrified, so I am terrorist?

464
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:42,058
What did I ever do to you?

465
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:43,976
-Ever do?
-Yeah.

466
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:49,398
Yeah. I'm here because it's a job,
to make money.

467
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:52,151
-That's it.
-I have job until you come.

468
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:54,654
-Now my family have nothing.
-That's not my fault!

469
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:59,158
9/11 was not my fault, but you still here.
Saddam was not my fault, but you still here.

470
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:02,078
I told you, I'm only here to work.
To help rebuild.

471
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,454
Rebuild what you destroyed.

472
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:08,000
Stop! Stop! Just please, stop!
I'm just a guy. I'm just a truck driver. Okay?

473
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,627
I'm nobody that makes decisions
about anything.

474
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,587
I just want to go home.

Hello?

476
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:22,306
-You make video. Ransom video.
-Yeah, yeah!

477
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,933
I'll make a video.
If you let me go, I'll make a video.

478
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,018
No. You make video now.

479
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,437
-What? How?
-Use video on phone.

480
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:32,567
Near foot. You read note near foot in box.

481
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,863
-I don't see it.
-Near foot.

482
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:39,365
-Read note inside box.
-Okay, okay.

483
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:43,369
-If I make the video, you let me go?
-Only if we get money.

484
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,038
Nobody's going to pay $5 million for me.

485
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:49,000
We take less. One million, money.

486
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,294

Unless they're using a cloned line,

No, no, no, you don't!
You don't care about me.

You don't care about any of us.

six of them today.

-We don't have any guns, any armor.

-Nothing.
-That's because you're not soldiers.

who put me in this box!

-Tell that to the people who shot my friends!

-No, you're not! You're not!

533
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,432
-Okay, calm down.
-I've been out here nine months.

534
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,100
I know how it works. All you guys care about

535
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:41,894
is your secret plans
and your back-room politics.

536
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:43,270
You know, if I was a diplomat,

537
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:46,106
or a hostage working group leader,
or what the fuck your title is,

538
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,233
I'd be out of here by now.

539
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,069
But I'm not, so I'm just supposed to
sit in here, shut my mouth and die.

540
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:52,905
Okay, I need you to stay focused, Paul.

541
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:53,989
Fuck you, Dan.

542
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:56,909
Paul, listen to me.
Finding you is our primary concern.

543
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,911
Bottom line. And we 're searching for you

544
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:01,247
just as hard as we would be
for a four-star general,

545
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,415
so don't literally waste your breath
suggesting otherwise.

I can't... I can't... (PANTING)

547
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:07,753
Are you injured, Paul? Are you okay?

548
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,922
I don't know. Who are they?

549
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,674
The people who put me in here,
who are they?

550
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:15,177
They're just that, people.
No different from you and me.

551
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,930
-I'm not a terrorist.
-Neither are they.

552
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,014
How do you know?

553
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:23,185
If you were homeless, starving...
Actually I take that back.

554
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,480
If your family was homeless and starving,
what would you do for them?

555
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:29,566
-I wouldn't kill somebody.
-How can you be sure?

556
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,695
What difference does it make?

557
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:35,447
They're criminals, desperate ones at that.

558
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:38,033
They don't care about anything
other than getting the money.

559
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:39,994
So pay them, just pay them.

560
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:43,539
Trust me, if it was an option,
I would do that in a heartbeat.

561
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,961
How many others have there been?

562
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:50,462
-Since I got here?
-Yeah.

563
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:53,507
Dozens. Journalists, contractors, soldiers.

564
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:58,053
Dozens have been taken. it's one of
the only functioning businesses out here.

565
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,139
How many have you rescued?

566
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,688
-How many?
-Not many.

567
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,857
-Tell me their names.
-No.

568
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,986
-Any of them.
-Who?

569
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,905
Make me believe
that they really do matter to you.

570
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:18,907
That they really do matter to you.

-Mark White.
-Who was Mark White?

572
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:27,750
A kid from New Hampshire.
Twenty-six years old. Med student.

573
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,253
Came over here to help out local doctors.

574
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:33,130
What happened to him?

575
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:36,633
-Insurgents grabbed him.
-When?

576
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,385
About three weeks ago.

577
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:45,351
You remember his name?

578
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:47,519
I remember all their names.

579
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,940
Is he... Did he?

580
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:54,610
Yeah. Yeah, he's alive.

581
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:56,904
-Where is he now?
-Home.

582
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:00,491
Probably happy to be back at school.

583
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:05,496
I want to get out of here.

584
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:07,915
We found him. We’ll find you, too.

585
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,001
How?

586
00:45:11,377 --> 00:45:14,546
We already have a solid lead
on the number you gave us.

-Yeah. A unit's on its way over there now.

-That feels good.
-Yeah.

590
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:27,309
What... What should I do in the meantime?

591
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:30,229
I know it's hard, but try to relax.

592

the more air you're going to use.

595
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:43,659
I take pills for it.

-Yeah.

597

Good. Take them.

598

she'd been taken hostage.

-She sent three videos.
-Yeah. That's what they told her to say.

I don't... Nine months ago.
Around January. What is all this?

861
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:51,308
I have your official date of hire
as January 4th.

-ls that correct?
-Who cares?

-January 4th. ls that correct?
-Yes!

865
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:01,026
And during your initial training,
before being sent to Iraq,

866
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:05,239
you were made aware of the dangers inherent
to the position for which you were hired.

867
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:08,242
You mean when I came down there to Dallas,
and you guys said that all of the trucks

868
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,369
would be armored
and have bulletproof glass?

869
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:13,247
You mean when you told us
that things were safer than ever over here?

870
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,832
Is that when...
Is that when I was made aware?

871
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:17,668
I need you to answer yes or no, please.

872

Yes.

873
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:24,383
During that time, did you also receive
and sign an employment contract with CRT,

to your specific terms of employment?

-Yes or no?
-Yes! I signed the contract. Yes.

that you were taken hostage in Iraq

we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees,

for their forced separation from the company.
