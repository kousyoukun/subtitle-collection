because there's little you can do?

294
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,713
<i>-No.</i>
-Then what?

295
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,112
<i>l need to know where you were</i>
<i>when your convoy was ambushed.</i>

296
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,377
-ln Baqubah, in the Diyala province.
<i>-Okay.</i>

297
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,077
<i>And has contact been made</i>
<i>with the kidnappers?</i>

298
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,747
Yeah. The guy says he wants $5 million
by 9:00 tonight.

299
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,756
<i>Okay, or else...</i>

300
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,326
Or else he'll take me to SeaWorld.

301
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:40,022
-What the hell do you think, lady?
<i>-We'll do everything we can.</i>

302
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,361
So you'll pay them then? Yeah?

303
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,458
<i>-No. That we can't do.</i>
-Wait, wait. Why?

304
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,059
<i>lt's the policy</i>
<i>of the United States government</i>

305
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,398
<i>to not negotiate with terrorists.</i>

306
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:48,870
Not the policy
of the United States government?

307
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,304
Lady, come on!

308
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,842
You're sitting in an air conditioned office,
this is easy for you to say.

309
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,175
You're not the one stuck in a coffin,
buried in the goddamn desert!

310
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,909
<i>-l understand your frustration...</i>
-Frustration?

311
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,509
Lady, l'm going to fucking die in here.
Understand that?

312
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,318
-Hello?
<i>-l'm here.</i>

313
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,989
Then say something.
Tell me how you can get me out of here.

314
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,065
<i>Okay.</i>

315
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,600
<i>What's the number on the phone</i>
<i>that you're calling from?</i>

316
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,169

317
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,703
<i>No. lt's listed as unavailable.</i>

318
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,898
<i>Tell me this, can you remember a number?</i>

319
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,838
Yeah. No. l have a.. . l have a pencil.

320
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,741
<i>-Okay, write this down.</i>
-Okay, just a sec.

321
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,677
Okay. Go ahead.

322
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,249
<i>-4 10...</i>
-Yeah.

328
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,690
<i>Formed it in 2004 to deal</i>

l love how you keep calling it that.

330
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,537
<i>-Did you write down the number?</i>
-Yeah.

331

333
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,873
<i>No, don't call the news.</i>

334
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,411
<i>-l repeat, do not contact the news.</i>
-Why?

335
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,343
<i>-lt will only complicate things further...</i>
-That's bullshit.

336
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,210
-You're just covering your own ass.
<i>-No, l'm covering yours.</i>

337
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,783
You don't go looking for something
you don't know is missing.

338
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:07,873
<i>Everyone who needs to know about</i>

-l need all the help l can get.
<i>-We are running out of time, Paul.</i>

341
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,784
Fine.

342
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,025
<i>l'm transferring you now.</i>

343
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,775
<i>-Brenner.</i>
-Dan Brenner?

344
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,411
<i>-ls this Paul Conroy?</i>
-Yeah, yeah, it's me. lt's Paul.

345
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,319
<i>Paul, l was informed of what's going on.</i>

346
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,358
<i>l want you to know</i>
<i>that we're already working</i>

<i>-on trying to get you out of there.</i>
-Thank you, God.

348
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,862
<i>l was told that we have until 9</i>/<i>00 p.m .</i>
<i>ls that right?</i>

349
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,057
-That's what he said.
<i>-All right.</i>

350
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,157
<i>That doesn't give us a whole lot of time.</i>

351
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,135
<i>And just so l have this right,</i>
<i>the kidnappers buried you in the ground?</i>

352
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,330
Yeah. lt's an old, wooden coffin.

353
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,499
<i>Okay, my guess is that</i>
<i>since you're able to get a cell signal,</i>

354
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,133
<i>you're no more than</i>
<i>a few feet underground.</i>

355
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,439
-Yeah, l don't know. Maybe.
<i>-What about battery life?</i>

356
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:12,209
<i>-How much does the phone have left?</i>
-lt's just less than half.

357
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:15,012
<i>Okay, you have to conserve that battery.</i>

358
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,917
<i>Our best bet of finding you</i>
<i>is by tracking your cell signal.</i>

359
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,219
<i>-ls the ringer set on a sound or vibrate?</i>
-Vibrate.

360
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,486
<i>l need you to press</i>
<i>and hold down the asterisk key</i>

361
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:26,154
<i>to change it to a ring tone.</i>
<i>lt will use less power.</i>

362
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,824
-What about my Zippo?
<i>-You have a lighter?</i>

363
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,458
-Yeah.
<i>-Use it to look around for markings,</i>

364
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,093
<i>-a logo, whatever you can find.</i>
-Won't it use up oxygen?

365
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,796
<i>Don't worry about that now.</i>
<i>Just try to find...</i>

366
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,170
-lt's just so dark in here without it.
<i>-l understand, Paul.</i>

367
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:41,336
<i>Try to find anything in there that might</i>
<i>indicate where that coffin was made.</i>

368
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,813
-You guys have to hurry.
<i>-We're working as fast as we can, Paul.</i>

369
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,577
Do you know if there were
any other survivors?

370
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,515
<i>-From your convoy?</i>
-Yeah.

371
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,712
<i>Still unclear at this point.</i>

372

l just wanted to do right by my family.
That's all.

373

like this out here.

374

-That's him. He's calling.
<i>-The kidnapper?</i>

376
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,430
-Yeah. What should l do?
<i>-You know his number?</i>

377
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:07,561
-Yeah.
<i>-Give it to me.</i>

378

-Okay. What about the call?
<i>-Give me the number first.</i>

<i>-No pay?</i>
-No.

387

<i>-Terrorists? l am terrorist?</i>

No, no, no, you don't!
You don't care about me.

You don't care about any of us.
l've had eight friends

You know, if l was a diplomat,

They're alive?

There was an explosion or something,

687
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:18,379
and the sand's coming through.

688

<i>to getting you out of there.</i>

703
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,415
<i>So hopefully, it won't be too much longer.</i>

What is all this?

721
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:51,334
<i>l have your official date of hire</i>

<i>-January 4th. ls that correct?</i>
-Yes!

725
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:01,079

<i>for which you were hired.</i>

728
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:06,877
You mean when l came
down there to Dallas,

729
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,286
and you guys said that all of the trucks

would be armored
and have bulletproof glass?

731
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,290
You mean when you told us that things
were safer than ever over here?

732
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:14,862
