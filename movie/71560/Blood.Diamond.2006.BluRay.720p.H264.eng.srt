1
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,453
Sierra Leone, 1999

2
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,292
Civil war rages for control
of the diamond fields.

3
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:49,090
Thousands have died
and millions have become refugees.

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,344
None of whom has ever seen a diamond.

5
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,986
Dia.

6
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,406
Don't want to be late.

7
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,452
English boys don't go
to school every day.

8
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,496
Every day. Just like you.

9
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,000
So you can become a doctor,
not mend the nets like your father...

10
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,420
Now get out of bed before I tan your
behind with my fishing rod.

11
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,384
You listen to your father.

12
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,015
And be careful on the road.

13
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,212
Teacher say this country
was founded as a utopia.

14
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,923
Do you know
what that word means, Papa?

15
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,467
Well, she says someday
when the war is over...

16
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,053
...our world will be a paradise.

17
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,597
And all this you learn in one day?

18
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,891
And math and science.

19
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:08,104
This is too much learning. Tomorrow,
you will stay home and mend the nets, yes?

20
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,438
No, Papa.

21
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,899
What? So now you want
to go to school every day?

22
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,809
- Stay.
- Papa.

23
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,394
- Stay!
- Papa!

24
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,057
Jassie!

25
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,100
Solomon.

26
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,782
Come, come, come.

27
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,872
Pick it up. Quick.

28
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,334
- Papa! Papa!
- Jassie.

29
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,379
- Dia, run!
- Papa!

30
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,552
- Papa! Papa!
- Dia, run!

31
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,846
Papa!

32
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,073
Bring forward the next one. Bastard.

33
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,908
Bring forward the next one.

34
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,996
- Long sleeve or short sleeve?
- No.

35
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,000
Young man. You must understand.

36
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,836
The government wants you to vote, okay?

37
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,673
They gonna tell you say,
"The future is in your hands. "

38
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,092
We now the future.

39
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,844
So we take your hands.

40
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,430
- No.
- No more hands, no more voting.

41
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,933
Chop him.

42
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,566
Spread the word.
The Revolutionary United Front is coming.

43
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,405
- RUF!
- RUF! RUF!

44
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,910
Bring forward the next one.
Bring him forward. Bring him forward.

45
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,707
Long sleeve or short sleeve?

46
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,626
- Short sleeve!
- Chop him.

47
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,129
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

48
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,966
Not this one. Look at him.

49
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,469
- Put him in the truck.
- Let's go.

50
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,054
Bring him to the mines.

51
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,389
He can work. He can work.
Move, move, move.

52
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,308
Next one, next one, next one.

53
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,482
Throughout the history of Africa...

54
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,193
...whenever a substance
of value is found...

55
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,361
G8 Conference on Diamonds
Antwerp, Belgium

56
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,906
...the locals die
in great number and in misery.

57
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,787
Now, this was true of ivory,
rubber, gold and oil.

58
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,330
It is now true of diamonds.

59
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,002
According to a devastating report
by Global Witness...

60
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,007
...these stones are being used
to purchase arms and finance civil war.

61
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,968
We must act to prohibit...

62
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,473
...the direct or indirect import
of all rough diamonds from conflict zones.

63
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,106
May I remind you...

64
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:25,194
...that the U.S. is responsible for two-thirds
of all diamond purchases worldwide...

65
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,989
...and I don't anticipate
that demand diminishing.

66
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,367
We must remember
that these stones...

67
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:36,539
...comprise only a small percentage
of the legitimate diamond industry...

68
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:41,544
...whose trade is crucial to the economies
of many emerging nations.

69
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,005
The Freetown government
and their white masters...

70
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,800
...have raped your land
to feed their greed.

71
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,052
RUF have freed you.

72
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,556
- No more slave and master here.
- It's true.

73
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:58,853
Current estimates are that conflict stones
account for only 15 percent of the market.

74
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,397
But in a multi-billion-dollar-a-year
industry...

75
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,650
...that means hundreds of millions
of dollars are available...

76
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,735
...for weapons in these conflict zones.

77
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,363
RUF is fighting for the people!

78
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,283
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

79
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,329
Any bastard think he would joke
with me diamond, I go cut he throat.

80
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,666
Stop!

81
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:26,088
And we are joined today
by members of that diamond industry...

82
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,925
...who wholeheartedly
endorse your proposal.

83
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,762
I hope you join me
in applauding their presence here.

84
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,183
Mr. Van De Kaap and Mr. Simmons.

85
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,776
Give it to me.

86
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,647
Don't worry. We'll be fine, huh?

87
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,151
Listen. You take off
as soon as I'm out the door.

88
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,779
You don't land
until I raise you on the sat phone.

89
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,615
You be careful, Danny.

90
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:39,328
Don't worry. They want these guns
too much to do anything stupid.

91
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,177
Where is Commander Zero?

92
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,515
I am Captain Rambo.

93
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,936
Right. Right, I've seen your films, huh?

94
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,566
I'm looking for Commander Zero, huh?

95
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,568
He's inside. You talk to me.

96
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,697
You are here to help us
in our struggle against the government.

97
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,449
I'm here to do business
with Commander Zero, all right?

98
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,259
All right.

99
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:39,680
You are the man, huh?
You are the man.

100
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,018
Here, huh?

101
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,033
Hey. I'm talking to you! Stop!

102
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,243
- Commander Zero.
- Hey.

103
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,079
- I go kill you, eh?
- It's fine, huh? It's fine.

104
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,916
Commander Zero. Commander Zero.

105
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,086
Mr. Archer, come here.

106
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,887
You get something for me?

107
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,639
And yourself get something for me, huh?

108
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,099
First you bring back the plane.

109
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,102
Are you craze?
You get for pay me first for them.

110
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,081
This no fine, huh?

111
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,624
This no fine.

112
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,292
That's all you get!

113
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:55,464
Then your boys can use those crummy AK's
against the government's troops...

114
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,091
...and their new weapons, huh?

115
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,551
Maybe I could kill you
and take what you bring.

116
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,637
Then you get one more dead body...

117
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,473
...instead of airplane
way full with grenade launchers.

118
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,643
So I'm think I'm gonna go
to them government.

119
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,229
Them government,
at least them go pay me, huh?

120
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,273
Wait, wait. Wait, my friend.

121
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,613
This is the thing you want? Here.

122
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,949
So many I not know
what to do with them all.

123
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,619
Hey, Archer, next time,
you bring satellite TV, eh?

124
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,539
- I wanna see Baywatch.
- Yeah.

125
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,165
Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,649
Hello, hello, hello.

127
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,777
Papers, please.

128
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,196
Danny Archer, National Geographic.

129
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,868
You crossing into Liberia.

130
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,705
I've got a letter from the minister of interior
and a Liberian visa as well.

131
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,332
I'm doing a story on the Marrakaz,
who, as you know...

132
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,836
...are allowed to cross the border
in order to get into grazing grounds.

133
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,338
You ever read National Geographic, huh?

134
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,049
- You're under arrest for smuggling.
- No, no, no.

135
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,927
Listen here, my friend.
Listen here, all right?

136
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,554
I am good friends
with Colonel Coetzee.

137
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,017
Colonel Coetzee would not be pleased
that you've interfered with his business.

138
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,936
Now, you know who I am, all right?

139
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,939
You don't wanna make trouble for me
or my friends, all right?

140
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,817
Now, look, why don't I just
look the other way, all right?

141
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,613
You take one or two of those stones
and get something lacquer for the wife...

142
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:28,617
...or maybe the mistress, all right?
We'll solve the problem right here, huh?

143
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,079
We'll go back to Freetown
and ask Colonel Coetzee...

144
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,249
...how he wishes
to thank his business associate.

145
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,084
Guys, take him away.

146
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,966
Hey! What the fuck?
What's going on there?

147
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,010
Come on! Fix that shit now!

148
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,430
Wasting my time here!
What in the shit is that?

149
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,267
Fuck that stuff! Fix that shit!
Damn, now need to work.

150
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,352
- Can't work. What's going on there?
- Boss.

151
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,397
- Fix that thing.
- I wanna go toilet. I must go now, now.

152
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,859
- I can't hold it in, boss.
- Go, go.

153
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,194
Get to work. Go to work, go to work.

154
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,449
Fuckheads wasting my time now.
How am I work in this shit?

155
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,205
Stop!

156
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,209
Spread your fingers.

157
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,795
Open.

158
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,979
Make it quick.

159
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:02,896
Give it to me.

160
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,565
The government troops are coming!

161
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,115
Go, go, go-!

162
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,522
No, no, no!

163
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,400
No! I'm not a rebel!

164
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,320
I am not a rebel! I am not R.U.F.!

165
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:29,775
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!

166
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:42,621
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!

167
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:59,471
RUF! RUF! RUF!

168
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,728
Hey.

169
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,314
What did you do with it?

170
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,608
I'm talking to you, you hear me?

171
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,238
Where the diamond? The pink one.

172
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,157
- I saw you take it.
- You're mad. I do not know you.

173
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:23,245
Liar! I saw it with my own eyes.

174
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:28,083
This big. Biggest I have ever seen.

175
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:32,838
My brothers, I go give $1000...

176
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,466
...to the man who cuts the diamond
out of this bastard.

177
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:40,095
You the craze! You the craze!

178
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,930
Where is the diamond?

179
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,267
Where is the diamond?
Do you see a diamond?

180
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:51,231
You devils have taken my family!
My home! I done lost everything!

181
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,569
Here, look. What is left?

182
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,612
What is left?

183
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,448
If there is a diamond,
you are the one who has taken it!

184
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,617
Liar! The man is a liar!

185
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:07,038
I know your name, Solomon Vandy!
You have a name!

186
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,293
You have a family!
And I'll catch them!

187
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,295
And I'll find them!

188
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,273
Please tell me you brought me
cigarettes, bru, please.

189
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,858
I just have to tell you, Danny.

190
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:38,069
The colonel's not going to be happy
about you losing the diamonds.

191
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,114
Forget the colonel.
There's a fisherman in there, all right?

192
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,909
He might've found a pink. Big one.

193
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,202
What about the colonel?
He'll want that stone.

194
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,830
Screw the colonel.
I'll contact our friends in London.

195
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,834
If this stone is as big as I think,
we're gonna need a real buyer, all right?

196
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,129
What? What?

197
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,007
London wants nothing more
to do with you.

198
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,678
"Arrest in Sierra Leone of Daniel Archer,
former mercenary and smuggler... "

199
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,514
"Retains close ties
to Van De Kaap diamond cartel.

200
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,809
Sources say they deny
any affiliation whatso-"

201
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,062
Fucking hell.

202
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,649
Listen, his name
is Solomon Vandy, all right?

203
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:19,486
Van De Kaap is gonna want that stone,
whatever they say. You just get him out.

204
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,237
Get him out.

205
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:29,162
Yeah, can you tell Mr. Simmons
that Danny Archer called. Right.

206
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,333
Archer. A-R-C-H-E-R.

207
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,150
Afternoon, darling, huh?

208
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,238
Big white man all alone.
That is no fine.

209
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:07,867
- I'm safe, huh? No HIV.
- Yeah, yeah. I've heard that one before.

210
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,287
Archer, I know where to get
nice baby diamond just for you.

211
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,373
- Not now, next time.
- Come on, Archer.

212
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,834
I said not now, next time. Bugger off.

213
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,846
Solomon Vandy?

214
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,724
What do you want?

215
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,769
It seems you made a friend in prison.

216
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,088
- Hey.
- How the body, Mr. Archer?

217
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,048
The body fine, M'Ed.

218
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,013
So you want something nice, huh?

219
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,391
The best you can get ahold of, all right?

220
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,104
Take me a few days,
but I go find you something special.

221
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,107
All right. You hear
they took Marampa yesterday?

222
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,776
- Really?
- Now, come on.

223
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,612
You know every move they make.
When are they gonna hit us?

224
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,200
Oh, I imagine they come
do some shopping very soon.

225
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,620
Yeah, yeah.
Got any smokes back there?

226
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,372
Yeah.

227
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,258
Who's that, huh?

228
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,094
All right.

229
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:41,312
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks.

230
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,148
You listening to this?

231
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,775
I am profoundly sorry.

232
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:49,529
The world is falling apart,
and all we hear about is Blowjobgate.

233
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,573
I believe he's sorry.

234
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,160
When was the last time the world
wasn't falling apart, huh?

235
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:01,082
A cynic. Why don't you sit down
and make me miserable?

236
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,795
- Danny Archer.
- Maddy Bowen.

237
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,755
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

238
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,592
- American, huh?
- Guilty.

239
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,011
Well, Americans usually are.

240
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,889
Says the white South African?

241
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,933
I'm from Rhodesia.

242
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,271
We say Zimbabwe now,
don't we?

243
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,691
- Do we?
- Last time I checked.

244
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,027
Don't tell me,
you're here to make a difference.

245
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,447
- And you're here to make a buck?
- I'm here for lack of a better idea.

246
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,074
- That's a shame.
- Not really.

247
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,493
Peace Corps types only
stay around long enough...

248
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,579
...to realize they're not helping anyone.

249
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,623
Government only wants
to stay in power...

250
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,667
...until they've stolen enough
to go into exile somewhere else.

251
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,462
And the rebels, they're not sure
they want to take over.

252
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,964
Otherwise,
they'd have to govern this mess.

253
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,467
- But TIA, right, M'Ed?
- TIA.

254
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:53,843
What's TIA?

255
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,389
- "This is Africa," huh?
- Right.

256
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,434
- You want another?
- Sure.

257
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,774
So which one are you?

258
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,487
- Smuggler?
- Am I?

259
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,615
Somehow you don't strike me
as the UNICEF type.

260
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,618
How about soldier of fortune?

261
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,663
Or is that too much of a cliche?

262
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,164
Diamonds?

263
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,460
- If I told you I was a missionary...?
- For Van De Kaap?

264
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,756
Better watch that type of talk,
Miss Bowen.

265
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:35,009
In America, it's bling-bling,
but out here, it's bling-bang, huh?

266
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,429
I wouldn't want you
getting in any trouble.

267
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,975
How much trouble
do you think I would get into...

268
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,395
...for talking about blood diamonds?

269
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,276
- You're a journalist.
- That's right.

270
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,823
Piss off, huh?

271
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,414
For five years, this country has reported
almost no diamond exports...

272
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:08,251
...while Liberia, right next door,
has exported 2 billion dollars' worth.

273
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,462
Very odd, considering that Liberia
has no diamonds to speak of.

274
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,630
I'm shocked.

275
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,134
Van De Kaap denies trading blood
diamonds, but admits it's impossible...

276
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,638
...to tell where a diamond comes from
unless their smuggler gets caught.

277
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,515
What do you want from me, huh?

278
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:27,228
You know all about Van De Kaap.
Help me out. Off the record.

279
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:31,899
Well, off the record, I like to get kissed
before I get fucked, huh?

280
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,695
Shit.

281
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,523
- Cordell. How is it, Shona?
- Long time, pal.

282
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,069
- How's Alice?
- She's well, thanks.

283
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,071
Tim must be in school, right?

284
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,573
- Big kids, big problems, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

285
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,326
I heard you got into a spot of trouble
in the bush, huh?

286
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,912
Well, you know the bush, right, bru?

287
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,248
- Company doing well?
- Can't complain.

288
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,043
Eleven wars in the continent.
We're keeping busy.

289
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,629
So, what, you're here on holiday, huh?

290
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,257
- How's the colonel?
- He sends his regards.

291
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,136
Good, good. Score us a loose, huh?

292
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,431
Smoking will kill you, bru.

293
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,933
Only if I live, right?

294
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,148
That's for breaking my TV, bru.

295
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:02,573
Tell the colonel he'll get his money.
I'll come see him soon.

296
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,540
Ten more.

297
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,626
Come. Come.

298
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,217
Go on.

299
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,360
Dia. Dia. Come here.
Get away from there.

300
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,613
Go. Go, Mama.

301
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,699
Stay down.

302
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,954
Please...

303
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,207
I must talk to someone. My family's
name is not on the list.

304
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,876
Go to Kissy, there is another list.

305
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,253
I have been to Kissy, and Waterloo, and
Port Loko, and-

306
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,714
Talk to the whites.

307
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,510
Excuse me,
my name's Solomon Vandy-

308
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,762
- Check the list.
- I have checked the list.

309
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,392
- File papers at the Office for Refugees.
- Sir, I have filed papers with the office.

310
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,561
Then God help you,
because I can't.

311
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:14,812
- Please, sir-
- Next.

312
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,106
- Sir- Sir, no, please.
- Hey, hey. Me, me, me.

313
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:21,068
Husband here. One year we look.

314
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,742
Hurry, Mom. Go.

315
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,248
Dia! Dia!

316
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,416
- Jassie!
- Dia!

317
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,210
- Mama!
- Dia!

318
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,545
Jassie! Mama!

319
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,937
Cape Town,
South Africa

320
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,612
He's been waiting.
What took you?

321
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,699
What are you gonna do,
shoot me right here, huh, Shona?

322
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,953
Now, don't be a wanker, man. Get in.

323
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,445
- Hello, Danny.
- Colonel.

324
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,406
You look well.

325
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,742
Clean living and a pure heart,
I suppose, huh?

326
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,786
Walk with me.

327
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,374
It seems the rebels have taken back
the diamond fields, Danny.

328
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,876
The government
of Sierra Leone has contracted us...

329
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,004
...to go in there
and take the rebels down.

330
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,797
So you sell the rebels weapons...

331
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,633
...the government hires you
when they use them? Nice, sir.

332
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,970
I assume you're asking
for mining concessions, huh?

333
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:14,265
We save the government,
they show their gratitude.

334
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,726
And you get rich, right?

335
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,607
How long have I known you, Danny?

336
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:26,193
I was... I was 19, sir.

337
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:30,990
And you survived.
A lot of boys didn't. Why is that?

338
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,036
Just lucky, I guess.

339
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,834
No, you were a good soldier.
But I made you better, didn't I?

340
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,631
Yes, sir. Yes, you did.

341
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,842
And over the years,
didn't I protect you...

342
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:54,221
...teach you about diamonds,
cut you in on the deals?

343
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,059
- Some might call it that, yeah.
- But not you...

344
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,688
...because you done with me now, eh?
On to bigger things.

345
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,277
I need a man that knows
his way around up there.

346
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:12,239
Unless, of course,
you wanna cut me in. Something pink?

347
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,825
Sir...

348
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,119
Our deal went bad,
and you owe me money.

349
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,038
I'll take a stone as payment.

350
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:23,084
Look, do you think if I found a stone
like that, I'd still be on this continent?

351
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:27,088
- Come on.
- Danny, give me your hand.

352
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,803
That's red earth. It's in our skin.

353
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,681
The Shona say the color
comes from all the blood...

354
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,433
...that's being spilled
fighting over the land.

355
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:46,023
This is home.
You'll never leave Africa.

356
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,445
If you say so, sir.

357
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:10,631
So, what did you do, bury it?

358
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,386
Yeah. Yeah, I would have
buried it, huh?

359
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:19,598
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about? Come on, bru.

360
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,183
I'm late for work.

361
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,894
Pink, huh? The biggest one
he'd ever seen.

362
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,188
You were in the mining camps,
weren't you, bru?

363
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,859
Why else would that rebel with
the bandaged eye make up such a story?

364
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,278
Go ask him.

365
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,835
Thank you.

366
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:00,264
Your mothers and fathers,
your brothers and sisters are dead.

367
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,308
- You are dead! You have been reborn.
- No!

368
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:05,686
- We are your family now.
- No! No!

369
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,905
Your parents are weak.

370
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,910
They're the farmers.
They're the fishermen.

371
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,997
They've done nothing
but suck the blood from this country.

372
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:30,836
But you are the heroes
who will save this nation.

373
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,047
You are not children anymore.

374
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,008
You're men.

375
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,388
No one has ever given you respect...

376
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,642
...but with this in your hand,
they go fear you.

377
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,311
If you do not get
the respect you deserve...

378
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,772
...you will take it
by shedding their blood.

379
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,901
- Repeat after me, shed their blood.
- Shed their blood.

380
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,154
- Louder! Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Shed their blood!

381
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,449
Make them hear you in Freetown.
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

382
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,202
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

383
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,247
- Dia Vandy, stand up.
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

384
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,333
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Put your hand on the gun.

385
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,878
Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

386
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,090
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Now squeeze the trigger.

387
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:21,011
Come on, Dia. Pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger!

388
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,717
I know, I know.
It's hard to be a man.

389
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,970
Sit up. Come.

390
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:07,474
But you are a soldier
of the revolution now.

391
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,519
And I am your commander.

392
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,897
Whatever you need...

393
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,317
...guns, CDs, food...

394
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,154
...come to me.
I will take care of you.

395
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:29,830
Today, you are promoted
to the rank of captain.

396
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,462
Dia Vandy...

397
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,882
...boss man.

398
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,276
How's it, bru?

399
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,988
- You got something for me, huh?
- Yeah.

400
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,159
- So, what's new, M'Ed?
- Fucking RUF.

401
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,870
Tried to hit the government building
across the street.

402
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:14,708
Shit, man, half the people
be soldiers today, RUF tomorrow.

403
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,253
- Might be time to get your family out, huh?
- And go where?

404
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,174
Just fire up the chopper
and fly away like you people?

405
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,385
This my country, man.

406
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,013
We here long before you came,
long after you gone.

407
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,192
- Hi. I'm Maddy Bowen.
- How about you dance with me?

408
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,737
- No, I don't dance.
- Neither do I. Come on.

409
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,328
- So, Danny...
- Archer.

410
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:52,705
Archer.

411
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:57,251
When did you first start
moving stones? Was it Angola?

412
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:03,632
Then you did the whole
mercenary thing. Was that fun?

413
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,846
So, what are you?
Nihilist? Opportunist?

414
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,181
Maybe I wasn't breast-fed
as a child, huh?

415
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,769
You think I haven't met
people like you before?

416
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,273
- I think you get off on people like me.
- You think?

417
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,570
When did you first start
working for Van De Kaap?

418
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,780
Christ, you never stop, do you?

419
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:31,410
No, I never stop.

420
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,704
Do you want me to stop?

421
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,959
Why don't we go back to your place,
see what's in the minibar, huh?

422
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,253
I'm a print journalist. I drank it.

423
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,257
Is it possible that you don't care
how many people die...

424
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,301
...because of the deals you do?

425
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:50,721
People here kill each other as a way of life.
Always been like that.

426
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,807
So you can just watch it
and go about your day?

427
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,227
Maybe we should all just
write about it, then.

428
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,730
Look, thanks for the dance, huh?

429
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,319
- And a shot too, huh, M'Ed?
- Sure.

430
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,449
You're a hard case, huh?

431
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,619
Tell me something,
how long you been here in Africa, huh?

432
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,122
Three months. And before that,
Afghanistan and Bosnia.

433
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,500
You come here
with your laptop computer...

434
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,629
...and your malaria medicine
and your little bottles of hand sanitizer.

435
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,424
Think you're gonna change
the outcome, huh?

436
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,177
Let me tell you something.
You sell blood diamonds too.

437
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,845
- Really?
- Yeah.

438
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,013
Tell me, how is that?

439
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,474
Who do you think buys
the stones that I bring out?

440
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:39,269
Dreamy American girls who all want
a storybook wedding and a big, shiny rock...

441
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:43,023
...like the ones in the advertisements
of your politically-correct magazines.

442
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:46,193
So, please, don't come here
and make judgments on me, all right?

443
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,865
I provide a service. The world wants what
we have, and they want it cheap.

444
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,285
We're in business together.
Get over yourself, darling.

445
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:59,873
Okay, just to clarify, not all American girls
want a storybook wedding...

446
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,918
...just like not all Africans kill each other
as a way of life.

447
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,504
And yeah, it's a shit, shit world,
but you know what?

448
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:09,550
Good things are done every day,
just, apparently, not by you.

449
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,179
This place is about to explode.

450
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,473
I wanna spend my time
with someone else.

451
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,571
You are listening to BBC World Service.

452
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,491
In Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United Front
forces have been sighted...

453
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,411
...within 10 kilometers
of the capital city of Freetown.

454
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,247
The minister of the interior
has expressed confidence...

455
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,749
...that the government troops
can repel the attack.

456
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,211
All foreign nationals are being advised
to leave the country.

457
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,547
There are also unconfirmed reports...

458
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:52,759
...that atrocities are being committed by
both sides in the rapidly worsening situation.

459
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,889
The United Nations has described
the refugee situation as critical.

460
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,861
Don't tell me you're gonna try
and sell it yourself.

461
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,572
To who?
And for what price, my friend?

462
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,782
You need my help,
whether you like it or not.

463
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,994
- What are you talking about?
- Here, let me help you with that.

464
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:23,040
You hear that? You hear that?
They came into the city overnight.

465
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,500
It's started.
What are you gonna do now, huh?

466
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,963
Listen, the right stone can buy anything.
Information, safety, even freedom.

467
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,591
But a big stone does not stay secret
for very long.

468
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:36,011
The moment you tell anyone about it,
your life is absolutely worthless.

469
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,306
The only reason you're alive is
you haven't told anyone where it is.

470
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,766
Am I right? Am I?

471
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,185
Who do you think got you
out of jail, huh?

472
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:46,438
- That makes us partners.
- I am not your partner!

473
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,107
What if I helped you find your family?

474
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,817
What do you know of my family?

475
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,987
The relief agencies are useless,
the hospitals are overwhelmed.

476
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,782
- There are other ways, bru.
- Liar.

477
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,160
Look at me. I know people, huh?
White people.

478
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,497
Without me, you're just another
black man in Africa, all right?

479
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,585
Oh, shit.

480
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,922
We got no time.
What's it gonna be?

481
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,091
You would say anything.
How can I trust you?

482
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:17,678
I don't give a fuck about you, all right?
That diamond could be priceless!

483
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:22,099
We split it, and you get your family.
What's it gonna be, yes or no? Yes or no?

484
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,851
- Where will we go? Where do we go?
- Come on, follow me!

485
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,926
Stay low!

486
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,054
Get your ass over here!

487
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,150
Wait!

488
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,235
Now!

489
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:21,950
Come on, come on.

490
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,372
Come on!

491
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,182
Come on.

492
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,558
Fuck!

493
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,652
No, this way.

494
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,613
Fire!

495
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,255
Fuck! Go, go, go!

496
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,132
Go!

497
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,977
Shit!

498
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,813
No! No!

499
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,989
This way.

500
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,011
This way. Stay low.

501
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,191
Come on. Go, go, go. Come on.

502
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,950
Come on!

503
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,875
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

504
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,694
Fire!

505
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:48,300
- Is there another way?
- That bridge is the only way across, huh?

506
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,635
So, what do we do?

507
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:06,192
- You are RUF, huh? And I am your prisoner.
- What do you mean?

508
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,446
You wanna see your son again, don't you?
You stay behind me.

509
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,781
Wait, wait. Wait.

510
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,495
Bring that pink chicken skin
over here, huh?

511
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,040
Now let me shoot that pink ass, boy.

512
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,702
Where are we going?

513
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:01,039
Lungi's under government control.

514
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:05,669
I'm gonna try to locate a sat phone
to get in contact with my pilot, all right?

515
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,213
I have agreed to nothing.

516
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,591
You're in a bit of a conundrum there,
my friend.

517
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:16,012
You know what that means?
It means you have no choice.

518
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:33,071
So you're a fisherman, huh?

519
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:37,075
- What do you catch mostly?
- Fish.

520
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,876
Come on.

521
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,640
- Hello.
- Back away from the fence.

522
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,393
Listen, I'm from
the Cape Herald, all right?

523
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,479
My wallet, my credentials,
everything got left in Freetown.

524
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,315
We barely got out with our lives.
Can we just get through?

525
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,527
Back away from the fence.

526
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,158
But you are not a journalist.

527
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,784
I'm trying to get us to Kono.

528
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,328
- Do you understand that, huh?
- Getting B-roll. Wait.

529
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,081
Listen, I'm coming back.
I'm coming back just now.

530
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:28,334
How's it, my bru?
Have you got an extra smoke?

531
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,211
- Here.
- Oh, cheers.

532
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:33,423
I'm looking for someone, an American
by the name of Maddy Bowen.

533
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,342
- If you saw her, you would not forget it.
- Yeah, I know her.

534
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,510
- Is it?
- Yeah.

535
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:41,306
Can you tell her Danny Archer's looking
for her? I've got the story she wants.

536
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:44,684
Okay, but I'm going out for a bit.
If I see her before, I'll tell her.

537
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,061
Magic. Listen, we'll be
right down the road, huh?

538
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,106
- Sweet. Cheers, bru.
- Cheers.

539
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:54,903
It is as I said.
You will say anything.

540
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,077
- You don't mind waiting?
- No worries.

541
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:07,123
- Thank you so much. I'll just be a sec.
- All right, Maddy.

542
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:11,878
Hi.

543
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,838
You got out.

544
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:17,050
Yes. Hello again.

545
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,552
- This is Solomon Vandy.
- Hi.

546
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,262
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

547
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:25,016
So I'm on deadline. I've been waiting
four hours to use the phone.

548
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:29,479
- I've got someone holding my place in line.
- I understand. Come with me, huh?

549
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,232
All right. Here it is.

550
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,318
- There's a company called Tiara Diamonds.
- Right?

551
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,779
They get the stones
that I smuggle into Liberia.

552
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:40,323
Now, Van De Kaap
has no visible ties to Tiara...

553
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:43,785
...but through a series of cross holdings
and offshore bank accounts...

554
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,079
- ... they actually own it.
- You can prove this?

555
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,959
- If you help me out, yeah.
- Right, here it comes.

556
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,670
Before you say anything,
look at that man. You see him?

557
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:58,716
His entire village was burned down.
His wife and children, they got away.

558
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:02,095
He's been working in the mining camps,
trying to get his family back.

559
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,847
He cannot get through the red tape.

560
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,766
All I'm asking is this,
that you help him, huh?

561
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,977
And how do you know this man?

562
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:13,439
- I know him. I know him.
- Oh, come on, Archer.

563
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,441
You're using him.

564
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:21,281
I'm using him, and you are using me,
and this is how it works, isn't it?

565
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,242
Come on. Look, you've got access
to U.N. databases.

566
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,286
- You can track his family for him.
- Why?

567
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,622
This whole country's at war.
Why should I help just one person?

568
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,255
I can't believe I just said that.

569
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,136
My family's here, in Guinea?

570
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:45,597
Yes, according to the manifest.

571
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:48,308
I do not know how to thank you.

572
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:03,323
Tassin Camp
Forecariah, Guinea

573
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:17,003
Thank you. Thank you.

574
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,686
This is what a million people looks like.

575
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,944
At the moment, the second largest
refugee camp in Africa.

576
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:47,200
Might catch a minute of this on CNN,
somewhere between Sports and Weather.

577
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,044
- Hello.
- Yeah, hello?

578
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,546
I've spoken with Colonel Coedoo...

579
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,883
...and highlighted the names
we're looking for.

580
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,218
- Move away.
- What him doing?

581
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:06,761
Okay, I'm gonna check for you.

582
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,472
- Wait me there.
- Okay, thank you.

583
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:10,890
We are here to help you.

584
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,351
This woman says she has
spoken to Coedoo.

585
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,271
An entire country made homeless.

586
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,569
Two multiplied by three
is equal to six.

587
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:27,240
Two multiplied by four
is equal to eight.

588
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:30,660
Two multiplied by five
is equal to 10.

589
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:33,913
Two multiplied by six
is equal to 12.

590
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,161
Jassie.

591
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:18,291
Jassie!

592
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:21,002
- Jassie.
- Solo.

593
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,546
Jassie. Jassie.

594
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:37,435
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

595
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:38,811
Where is Dia?

596
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,980
Dia. Dia.

597
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,191
Where is Dia?

598
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:45,568
Where is my son?

599
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,154
Jassie!

600
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:52,700
Where is my son?

601
00:56:54,036 --> 00:57:01,084
They took him.

602
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:07,507
There are only two children
on the manifest.

603
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,176
- Where is my son?
- Oh, Christ.

604
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,345
Where is my son?

605
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:14,263
- Away from the fence.
- Where is my son?

606
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,681
Move away from the fence.

607
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,935
- Let them out! Let them out!
- Keep away from the fence.

608
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:24,440
Let them out!

609
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,025
Away from the fence.

610
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,860
Let them out!

611
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,821
- They'll shoot you!
- Jassie!

612
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,365
No! Solo!

613
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,826
Do you want your wife and child
to watch you die?

614
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:38,329
Solo! Solo!

615
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:52,343
They said they're concerned that
some of the refugees might be rebels...

616
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,597
...so they refused to release them
until there's a cease-fire.

617
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,768
I'm so sorry, Solomon.

618
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,813
What you want, Mr. Archer,
is beyond those hills...

619
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,149
...where I buried it.

620
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:34,302
You say the mine is on the Sewa River.
Where exactly?

621
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:36,971
Solomon.

622
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,849
I do not need a map.

623
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:44,437
Yeah, well, I do.
Look, we are down here, huh?

624
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:46,355
The press convoy
is on its way to Kono.

625
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,817
You say the diamond mine is up here.
Where did you bury it?

626
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:56,365
When we get to Kono,
we're gonna have to walk, all right?

627
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,285
You damn well better be able to find it.

628
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:05,458
My son is a very good student.

629
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:09,295
He walks five kilometers
to the Sister School...

630
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:12,798
...every morning to study English.

631
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:17,720
He's going to be a doctor one day.

632
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:45,915
"In the 90-degree heat,
Solomon Vandy drops to his knees...

633
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:49,752
...rattling the wire
with his powerful hands. "

634
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,050
- What?
- Nothing.

635
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,179
Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?

636
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,933
You're right. It's shit.

637
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:07,436
It's like one of those infomercials.

638
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:12,441
You know, the little black babies
with swollen bellies and flies in their eyes.

639
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:16,529
So here I've got dead mothers,
I've got severed limbs, but it's nothing new.

640
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,282
It might be enough
to make people cry if they read it...

641
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,908
...maybe even write a check...

642
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:23,452
...but it's not gonna be enough
to make it stop.

643
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:28,332
I am sick of writing about victims,
but it's all I can fucking do.

644
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,042
Because I need facts.

645
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:34,714
I need names. I need dates.
I need pictures. I need bank accounts.

646
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,302
People back home
wouldn't buy a ring...

647
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,721
...if they knew it cost
someone else their hand.

648
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,557
But I can't write that story...

649
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:48,227
...until I get facts
that can be verified...

650
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:53,566
...which is to say, until I find someone
who will go on record.

651
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,235
So if that is not you...

652
01:00:56,403 --> 01:01:00,531
...and you're not really gonna help me,
and we're not really gonna screw...

653
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,909
...then why don't you get the fuck
out of my face...

654
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,995
...and let me do my work?

655
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:18,090
Do you know that Solomon thinks
his son's gonna be a doctor one day?

656
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:24,013
Maybe his baby dies in that camp.
Maybe his daughter gets raped.

657
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,515
Who knows, maybe both.

658
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,353
Do you realize that
that diamond...

659
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,272
...is the only chance he has
of getting his family out?

660
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,693
- You don't give a rat's ass about his family.
- Do you understand that?

661
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:45,242
Listen, I need to get to Kono, all right?

662
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,495
The only way
is with the press convoy.

663
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,039
I'm a journalist,
and he's my cameraman, all right?

664
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,749
- No.
- Please, Maddy.

665
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,542
- Please.
- No!

666
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,225
After I smuggle the stones
across the border...

667
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:13,145
...local buyers get them
to a middleman in Monrovia.

668
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,275
Go on.

669
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:24,657
He pays off Customs and then certifies
that the diamonds were mined in Liberia.

670
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:27,159
That way, they can be legally exported.

671
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,830
Now, once they've reached
the buyers in Antwerp...

672
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,499
...diamonds are brought
to the sorting tables...

673
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,292
...no more questions are asked.

674
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,212
By the time they get to India...

675
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:42,133
...the dirty stones are mixed with
the clean stones from all over the world...

676
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,552
...and then they become
like any other diamonds.

677
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,929
And Van De Kaap
knows about all this?

678
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:49,598
Yeah.

679
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,435
When I get to London,
I meet with Simmons.

680
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:56,313
Supply and demand. You control the supply,
and you keep the demand high.

681
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:57,940
- Agreed.
- Good.

682
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,484
Now, there's an underground vault...

683
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:04,196
...where they put all the stones
they buy up to keep off the market...

684
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,198
...so they can keep the price high.

685
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:10,369
If rebels wanna flood the market
with a billion dollars' worth of rough...

686
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:13,622
...a company like Van De Kaap,
who says that they're rare...

687
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,458
...can't afford to let that happen.

688
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,877
Especially when they're telling
some poor sod...

689
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,546
...he's supposed to shell out
three months' salary...

690
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,047
...for an engagement ring.

691
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:25,217
Now, technically speaking,
they're not financing the war...

692
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:28,220
...but creating a situation
where it pays to keep it going.

693
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:31,640
- You understand?
- Yes. And where's my proof?

694
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:42,234
Names, dates and numbered accounts.

695
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,406
You publish one word of this story
before I give them the stone...

696
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:49,617
...and I'm dead, huh?

697
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:54,163
After I give it to them,
then... I leave this continent forever.

698
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,209
If you don't come out
with the diamond?

699
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,753
Then write whatever you want.

700
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,714
I'm already dead.

701
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:14,225
Now, remember. All you say is,
"I am the cameraman," all right?

702
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,310
Listen, I cannot do this.

703
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:19,104
- Why not?
- Because I am not a journalist.

704
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,774
- Of course you're not.
- Well, then how can I say I am?

705
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:25,152
Because you do. Because that's how
you get your son back, all right?

706
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,738
Now get on the bus. Go.

707
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,299
I am the cameraman.

708
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:55,432
You are writing about
what is happening here?

709
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,226
Yes.

710
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:01,605
So when people in your country read it,
they will come help us, yes?

711
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,399
Probably not.

712
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:07,361
- You heard of a Stinger?
- What?

713
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:11,991
Your friend, Maddy. She's like a full-on,
heat-seeking missile, bru.

714
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,868
I mean, I saw her go into Afghanistan...

715
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:18,163
...like about 200 clicks
into Taliban land.

716
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,166
When the military said no,
she just took a bus, bru.

717
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,670
Came back with 3000 words,
and she still looked so good.

718
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,672
- Like hot, you know?
- All right.

719
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,591
Calm down to the frantic now, huh?

720
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,011
- What's that?
- What's going on?

721
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,388
Looks like it was an RPG.

722
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,390
Open the door. Let us out.

723
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:38,684
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on. Go, go, go.

724
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,104
Go, go! Move, move, move!

725
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,816
We've just happened upon
the sight of an ambush...

726
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,278
...fifteen kilometers
from the Liberian border...

727
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:52,072
- ... near the Moa River...
- As you can see behind me...

728
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,782
...just a few minutes ago...

729
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,285
- ... an ambulance has...
- Got movement in the bush.

730
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,537
- Check out the head of the road.
- Spread out.

731
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,414
- at this site.
Dozens of-

732
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,375
Many are injured.

733
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,680
Get back on the bus, huh?
Get back on! Come on!

734
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,474
- Maddy!
- Move it! Move it!

735
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:19,642
Get back on the bus!

736
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,393
Solomon! Solomon!

737
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,062
- Let's go.
- Solomon, come here!

738
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,647
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

739
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,524
- Get in the bus!
- Move, move, move! Come on, come on.

740
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,693
- Move!
- Get in the bus. Let's go.

741
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,071
Get in, get in.
Goddamn it, get in! Get in!

742
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,657
- Let me inside!
- There's no fucking space!

743
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,076
- Let them on the bus.
- You give him your seat.

744
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:40,245
What if we just take your place, huh?
What if we take your place?

745
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,332
That's enough. He can ride with me.
Oi, he can ride with me.

746
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,085
Maddy! Let's go!
Maddy, let's go. Come on!

747
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:02,101
Nothing like a little bang-bang
to get the heart started, Maddy.

748
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:06,188
- Whatever you say, Corbauld.
- Come on, love. Don't be like that.

749
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:09,817
Story's played out, hasn't it?
Government bad, rebels worse.

750
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,778
No one gives a toss anymore.
Know what I mean?

751
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,482
This medicine will make you strong...

752
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,444
...make you invisible to your enemies.

753
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,821
Bullets will bounce off you.

754
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:10,419
Superboy Killer, yes, huh?
Commando.

755
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:13,505
Foreigners are the cause of the problems.

756
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:19,970
Poppy Sankoh say,
"Overthrow those who would exploit you. "

757
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,348
I am Baby Killer.

758
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,773
- I am the Master of Disaster.
- You will be strong.

759
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,527
I am Born Trouble.

760
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,036
I am See Me No More.

761
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:56,507
You'd think they'd want
at least one decent road in this place.

762
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:02,054
I'm gonna have to start charging
an entrance fee. Oh, God!

763
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,168
Get down!

764
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:43,512
- Look out!
- Shit!

765
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,609
- You all right?
- Fine.

766
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,533
Shit!

767
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:20,465
Hold on!

768
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:32,978
Come on.

769
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,696
- Everyone all right, huh?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

770
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,323
Let me see that. You okay?

771
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,574
- Yeah.
- All right.

772
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:51,204
Quietly, now. Quietly.

773
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:13,810
Come on.

774
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:39,211
Kamajors. Local militia
protecting their homes, huh?

775
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:41,213
- Do not look them in the eye.
- No.

776
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:43,382
Who are you?

777
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,259
We are friends.

778
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,390
We are not R.U.F.!
We are not government!

779
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,433
We will kill all of you!

780
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,229
Excuse me. Excuse me?

781
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,525
Hi, I'm Maddy Bowen
with Vital Affairs magazine.

782
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,736
Wonder if I could take your picture.
I'm just gonna get my camera.

783
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,864
I've heard about your struggle.
I'd love to know more about it.

784
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,659
Would you mind if I took your picture?
Everyone together?

785
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,744
Everyone could all come in together.

786
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:16,081
- Who is this woman?
- We are friends.

787
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,291
Is that okay?
If everyone could come closer.

788
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,421
If you come over here and come in
nice and close. That's good.

789
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:26,091
Yeah. That's great.
And we'll get one with all of us.

790
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,135
There you go. That's perfect.

791
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,469
Reminds me of my wife.

792
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,472
How about one together?
Us together, what do you think?

793
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,599
I'll come in like this, yeah?

794
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:36,435
Cheese.

795
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,939
So do you think
they've read your work?

796
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,233
Shut up.

797
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,457
Hey, get them, get them, get them.

798
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,795
- I got a score. I got a score.
- You missed.

799
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,631
Where have you come from?

800
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,968
- Where did you come from?
- Where have you come from?

801
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:13,889
That's right. Yeah.
From New York. From America.

802
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:15,974
I don't have anything for you.

803
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,644
Don't bother the people now.
Let them come in.

804
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,859
Thank you, Ubani.

805
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:30,113
You can leave them here. I take
responsibility.

806
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,908
Good. Now they are your problem.

807
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:38,080
My name is Benjamin Margai.

808
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,832
Danny Archer. This is Maddy Bowen.

809
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,086
- Hello. How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

810
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,004
Welcome brother.

811
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,924
I am Solomon Vandy, from Shenge.

812
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,718
What should I make of your companions?

813
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,722
He- She is... They are journalists.

814
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,265
Ah. And I suppose you are, too.

815
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,186
I'm the cameraman?

816
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:06,733
The Belgians were the first
to chop off limbs in Africa.

817
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:11,279
King Leopold took one hand
for every hundredth slave in the Congo...

818
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,532
...to keep them in line.

819
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,119
Many of these children
were taken by the RUF.

820
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,287
We have taken them back.

821
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,541
Some of them have been
made to do horrible things.

822
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,752
We are trying
to bring them back to life.

823
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,546
Let me show you.

824
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,883
Imagine doing all this, huh?

825
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,095
What's your excuse?

826
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:41,226
Well, it's gotten hard to go back
to sipping lattes and talking interest rates.

827
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,104
So you're an action junkie, huh?

828
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:47,357
Three out of five ex-boyfriends
recently polled...

829
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:51,945
...say that I prefer to be
in a constant state of crisis.

830
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,739
Maybe I just give a shit.

831
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,411
You were good today.

832
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:03,206
You know that?

833
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,834
You too.

834
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,715
"- that sometimes they forgot
to close the door.

835
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:14,926
She also wrote
about her sister Josie...

836
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:20,557
...who was very ill
and who had to be taken to hospital. "

837
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:23,768
Cheers.

838
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,191
So how many attacks
have there been in the area?

839
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:32,277
I have known most of the rebels
since they were children.

840
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:36,948
The local commander is still afraid
I will come after him with my ruler.

841
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:41,870
So you think because your intentions
are good, they'll spare you, huh?

842
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,873
My heart always told me
that people are inherently good.

843
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,250
My experience suggests otherwise.

844
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,211
But what about you, Mr. Archer?

845
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:52,088
In your long career as a journalist...

846
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:55,091
...would you say that people
are mostly good?

847
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:58,595
No.

848
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:00,388
I'd say they're just people.

849
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:04,476
Exactly. It is what they do
that makes them good or bad.

850
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:07,896
A moment of love,
even in a bad man...

851
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:10,649
...can give meaning to a life.

852
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:14,444
None of us knows which path
will lead us to God.

853
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,657
Hey!

854
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:08,540
It's palm wine.

855
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,719
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, yeah. It takes getting used to, huh?

856
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,387
God.

857
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:25,307
- Drank that as a boy.
- In Rhodesia?

858
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,727
I take notes.

859
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,148
The Shona...

860
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:36,735
The Shona have a word for me.

861
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:42,240
- It means "white boy in Africa. "
- When did you leave?

862
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:44,576
I didn't leave.

863
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:49,080
I got sent away to South Africa
in 1978 when the munts overran us.

864
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:50,874
Then you joined the army?

865
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:55,920
Yeah. Yeah, I did my time in Angola.

866
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,757
- The 32 Battalion.
- That's right.

867
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:04,429
You know, contrary to what
you might think about us...

868
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:08,099
...we fought with the blacks, huh?
Yeah. Side by side.

869
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:11,978
There was no apartheid in a foxhole.
The colonel always used to tell us that.

870
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:15,565
- This is Colonel Coetzee?
- Yeah.

871
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:21,196
Then, of course, it's 1994.
No more army.

872
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:23,198
No more apartheid.

873
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:26,743
Truth and reconciliation
and all of that rubbish, you know.

874
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,411
Kumbaya.

875
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,956
We fought and died together,
you know?

876
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:35,377
Black and white. Most people back home
didn't even know we were at war.

877
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,420
We thought we were
fighting Communism...

878
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:41,466
...but in the end, it was all about
who gets what, you know?

879
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:44,677
Ivory, oil, gold:

880
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,389
Diamonds.

881
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:53,603
So one day I decided,
"Fuck it," you know?

882
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,814
"I'm gonna get mine. "

883
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:57,565
You gonna steal his diamond?

884
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:08,785
That diamond is my ticket
out of this godforsaken continent.

885
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,829
That doesn't answer the question.

886
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:25,552
My dad came home
from the war in '69.

887
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:29,681
And it took him...

888
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,934
...about 20 years to get right.

889
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,104
What?

890
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:43,278
You Americans love to talk
about your feelings, huh?

891
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:45,697
So, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

892
01:19:45,865 --> 01:19:48,032
- Got a thing for messed-up vets now?
- Shut up.

893
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:51,494
You lost both your parents.

894
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:55,206
That's a polite way
of putting it, yeah.

895
01:19:57,877 --> 01:20:00,211
Mom was raped and shot...

896
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,134
...and Dad was decapitated
and hung from a hook in the barn.

897
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,387
I was 9.

898
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:14,601
Boohoo, right?

899
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:20,482
Sometimes I wonder...

900
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:26,654
...will God ever forgive us
for what we've done to each other?

901
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:33,161
Then I look around and I realize...

902
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,540
...God left this place a long time ago.

903
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,257
It's...

904
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,470
What's the point, huh?

905
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:35,974
Oh, shit. Keep moving, huh?

906
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:37,892
- What?
- Drive at them. They'll panic.

907
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:40,311
Do you know where the word
"infantry" comes from?

908
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,815
It means "child soldier. "
They are just children.

909
01:21:43,983 --> 01:21:47,652
- Stop! Stop! RUF on the road!
- Hi. Hello. Hello.

910
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:49,946
Hello, little brothers.

911
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:52,657
- RUF on the road!
- Yeah, yeah. What is your names?

912
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:55,451
I'm Dead Body.
Who is this motherfucker?

913
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,287
We are teachers on our way to Kono.

914
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:59,664
Only RUF on the road.

915
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,791
- RUF only!
- Yes, yes, I understand that.

916
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,334
- Only RUF!
- But son, this is-

917
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:07,171
Don't move! Don't move! Fuck.

918
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:12,760
Jesus Christ! Maddy, press your hand
against the exit wound there, huh?

919
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,221
- Got it.
- Keep it there, huh?

920
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:17,181
Whatever you do,
don't talk, all right?

921
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:19,183
Is there any wine left in that jug?

922
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,185
- Here.
- Pour it all over everything, huh?

923
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:25,690
The colonel's gonna have a medic
at the airstrip in Kono.

924
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:28,860
- How far is it?
- You said not to talk.

925
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,320
A comedian, huh?

926
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,878
- How's his pulse?
- I can feel it sometimes.

927
01:22:57,348 --> 01:23:00,308
- Hold it right there.
- Stop.

928
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:01,726
Papers, please.

929
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:07,106
Excuse me.

930
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:10,234
I was just trying
to keep pressure on the wound.

931
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,904
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- You'll be all right, huh?

932
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:14,906
Will you?

933
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:18,576
I'll check on him in the tent
in a little bit. Thank you.

934
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,161
Hey.

935
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,705
Look who's alive, eh?

936
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,207
I told the H you'd be back.

937
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:29,087
I'm afraid we're evacuating
all non-military personnel, miss.

938
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:31,089
Transport touches down at 1600.

939
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,049
She's with me, all right?

940
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:36,928
No exceptions, pal. This is gonna be ugly.
Colonel doesn't want an audience.

941
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:39,889
Is I.R.'s presence here
known to other African nations?

942
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:43,434
- She's with you?
- Yeah.

943
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,437
Come on. The colonel's this way.

944
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,439
Give me a minute, huh?

945
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:54,112
We block their escape
by blowing the bridge.

946
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:57,448
That's correct.

947
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,493
You made it out. Well done.

948
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:02,620
Negative, Kilo Foxtrot, stand by.

949
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,958
- Colonel, sir.
- So must be real, then.

950
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:09,335
The pink.

951
01:24:09,837 --> 01:24:12,463
Well, you're part
of this operation now.

952
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:16,134
First we snuff everything that moves
out there, then we find your diamond.

953
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:17,927
Colonel?

954
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,888
Go get kitted. Yes?

955
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:29,188
Move, move, move!

956
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,650
- Go get your kit.
- Will do, chum. Will do.

957
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:39,365
It's go time, all right?
Meet me behind the tents.

958
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,162
How's Benjamin?

959
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,830
They say he'll live.

960
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,416
Good. Good.

961
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,633
Listen, Maddy...

962
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:00,803
...I need you to do me one last favor.

963
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:03,181
Yeah?

964
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:06,851
Tell that guard
you wanna put him...

965
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:09,687
...on the cover of Soldier of Fortune
magazine for me.

966
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:16,944
You're going in.

967
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,618
You and Solomon.

968
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:26,788
You're going in now.

969
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,832
Your plane leaves
in a few minutes, huh?

970
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:34,378
You're an idiot.

971
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:41,552
- What if I wanted to go in with you?
- I'd say no.

972
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,721
- What if I insist?
- I'd insist back.

973
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,062
It's my story.

974
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:54,607
Your story is Van De Kaap, all right?
That stone is mine.

975
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:58,236
I'm not leaving here without it,
you understand?

976
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:02,573
Please, just give me two minutes.

977
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,716
Yeah.

978
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,729
- Hello.
- Hi.

979
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:37,108
My name is Maddy Bowen.
I'm with Vital Affairs magazine.

980
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:39,777
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

981
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:41,445
Well, that depends what they are.

982
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:45,616
Oh, I see you're familiar
with our devious ways, aren't you?

983
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,244
Okay, so I'll start
with something simple.

984
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:03,509
And before that you were with
the South African Defense-?

985
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,344
- Defense Force, correct.
- Of course.

986
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,973
And was that with Colonel Coetzee?
Were you in Angola?

987
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:10,641
Angola, yeah.

988
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:15,229
That is all I really need to know.
Thank you so much.

989
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:16,898
- Thank you.
- Okay.

990
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:28,326
Thank you, huh?

991
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,912
Just keeping my end of the deal.

992
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:32,830
Good luck to you, Solomon.

993
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:34,624
Okay.

994
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:39,629
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- Thank you for all you have done.

995
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:49,680
- Listen, I-
- No, you listen.

996
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,187
In another life maybe, all right?

997
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,440
Yeah. Sure.

998
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:00,983
Yeah.

999
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,448
You find yourself a good man,
all right, Maddy?

1000
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:16,415
You know, I've got three sisters.

1001
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:19,210
They're all married to good men.

1002
01:28:21,088 --> 01:28:22,171
I prefer my life.

1003
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,261
Here is my office phone...

1004
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:31,806
...home phone, cell phone.

1005
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:37,061
I'm used to being pursued,
but what the heck.

1006
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,408
You better get on that plane, huh?

1007
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:54,036
You should get on that plane.

1008
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,005
So should you.

1009
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:11,595
You gonna call me?

1010
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:16,934
Soon as I'm near a phone, yeah.

1011
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:20,229
Yeah, right.

1012
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:45,296
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1013
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,469
Oh, shit.

1014
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:54,472
Nabil? Yeah, I'll call you
when we get closer, all right?

1015
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,266
You keep me posted. Right.

1016
01:29:57,434 --> 01:30:01,228
All right. I set the pace, huh?
Two-hour marches, five-minute breaks.

1017
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:05,232
If I hold my hand up like this, you stop.
If I point to the dirt, you lie flat.

1018
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,986
If I say go, you move like your life
depended on it. Understood?

1019
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,822
- Yes, boss.
- Come on.

1020
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:23,751
Tell me about the stone.

1021
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:26,545
Is it clear or is it milky?

1022
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:28,255
Clear.

1023
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,841
And the color, is it strong?

1024
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:32,218
Does it hold the light?

1025
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,470
It is as you say.

1026
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:38,057
- About the size of a bird's egg?
- Yes.

1027
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:42,394
One hundred carats.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

1028
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:25,354
Dia!

1029
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,233
Stop the truck!

1030
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:31,694
I thought it was Dia.

1031
01:32:25,624 --> 01:32:27,166
Wake up.

1032
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:32,129
Don't worry, they're gone, huh?

1033
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:36,592
You know, I once had this buddy...

1034
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,636
...named Mabhoko.

1035
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:42,640
We used to hunt bush meat
together as kids, huh?

1036
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:44,808
Baboons.

1037
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:47,811
Baboons, they were
the hardest to catch. They're...

1038
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:50,272
They're cunning.

1039
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,524
Cunning creatures.

1040
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:55,444
Fast, strong.

1041
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:57,821
Got good eyesight.

1042
01:32:58,323 --> 01:33:02,368
We would always find them
by the smell of their shit.

1043
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:07,665
And that's how we learned to track
your black terrorists in Angola, huh?

1044
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:13,170
By the smell of your shit.

1045
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:15,673
It's not...

1046
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,592
It's not the same as a baboon's.

1047
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:24,390
But, you know, after you skin it...

1048
01:33:25,684 --> 01:33:27,935
...the flesh of a baboon...

1049
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:30,604
...isn't that much different
than a man's, you know.

1050
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:37,945
I'll tell you, I can track anything.

1051
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,376
You risk my life like that again...

1052
01:33:57,716 --> 01:33:59,883
...and I'll peel your face
back off your head.

1053
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,638
Do you understand?

1054
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:14,940
Make us a fire.

1055
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,102
Hello my brother. Are you lost?

1056
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,813
We are headed for the mines in Kono.

1057
01:34:56,441 --> 01:35:00,527
You don't want to go that way. The
R.U.F. is in the next village.

1058
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,489
Thank you, my brother.

1059
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:07,451
And tell the poomui not to shoot me.

1060
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:12,998
He is crazy for diamonds like everybody else.

1061
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,376
Let's hope they don't discover oil here.

1062
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:20,798
Then we'd have real problems.

1063
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:22,800
Thank you, my brother.

1064
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,804
What'd he say?

1065
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:29,139
We are going the right way.

1066
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,982
Hold up there, my man.
It's this way, huh?

1067
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,653
Where do you think you are going?

1068
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:45,989
Stop!

1069
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:47,991
I said, stop!

1070
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:49,993
He is not down there, all right?

1071
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:55,666
All right. You're gonna need
some of that old discipline, huh?

1072
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:58,127
Now you listen here, my boy,
and you listen well.

1073
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:00,254
You are not going down there.
Are we clear?

1074
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:02,047
You are not the master.

1075
01:36:02,215 --> 01:36:05,843
Right now, that is exactly what I am,
and you'd better remember it, Kaffir!

1076
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:22,359
Don't you fucking move, huh?

1077
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,486
Don't you move. Don't you move, huh?

1078
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:26,989
- My son is there!
- Your son is gone!

1079
01:36:27,157 --> 01:36:28,490
- He is alive!
- He's gone!

1080
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:31,201
He's alive! He's there
with those crazy people!

1081
01:36:32,412 --> 01:36:35,873
I am his father! His father!
I should have protected him!

1082
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:40,210
I must go find him.
I cannot live without knowing!

1083
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:42,629
Shoot me if you want, but I'm going.

1084
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:48,218
Why should it matter,
I'm dead already.

1085
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,312
We wait until dark, huh?

1086
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:28,884
Are you satisfied?

1087
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:34,389
All right, come on.

1088
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:41,313
- is fighting for Sierra Leone

1089
01:37:41,481 --> 01:37:44,566
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone

1090
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:47,653
Go tell my parents
They may see me no more

1091
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,906
In the battlefield
We're fighting forever

1092
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:53,951
Go tell my parents
They may see me no more

1093
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:55,619
In the battlefield...

1094
01:37:58,164 --> 01:38:00,123
You are how old?

1095
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:02,084
Me? I'm 31.

1096
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:04,419
And you have no wife?

1097
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:07,756
- No.
- No children?

1098
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:10,217
No.

1099
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:12,010
And no home?

1100
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:13,845
No.

1101
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:16,974
But you have money, yes?

1102
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:19,393
Yeah, some.

1103
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:21,562
But not enough?

1104
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:25,649
No.

1105
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:30,862
If you get this diamond,
you will have enough money, yes?

1106
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,032
Yes.

1107
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,994
Then you will get
a wife and children?

1108
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:38,579
Probably not, no.

1109
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:45,294
What?

1110
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:47,754
I am confused.

1111
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,299
Yeah?

1112
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:53,260
That makes two of us, my bru.

1113
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:59,266
Oh, Christ.
I've gotta quit smoking, huh?

1114
01:38:59,851 --> 01:39:01,852
Why don't you?

1115
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:04,521
I'll tell you what, Solomon.

1116
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:09,318
You find me this diamond,
and I'll quit right then and there, huh?

1117
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:19,703
- You were born in Zimbabwe?
- Oh, yeah.

1118
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:23,040
- Is it beautiful there?
- Sure you're not a reporter?

1119
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:26,918
Because you ask a hell of a lot
of questions, my man.

1120
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:38,263
My grandfather told
many stories of war.

1121
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:41,350
How the Mende fought the Temne.

1122
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:45,228
Or how two tribes would fight
when somebody had stolen a woman.

1123
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:58,700
I understand white people
want our diamonds, yes?

1124
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:05,457
But how can my own people
do this to each other?

1125
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:15,801
I know good people...

1126
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:18,845
...who say there is something
wrong with us...

1127
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:20,389
...inside our black skin.

1128
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:23,892
That we were better off
when the white man ruled.

1129
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:28,605
But my son is good.

1130
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:32,359
And when he grows up...

1131
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:33,777
...and peace comes...

1132
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:40,450
...this place will be a paradise.

1133
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,794
We'll get your son back, huh?

1134
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:34,838
Where is it exactly?

1135
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:39,259
Through the camp, by the river.

1136
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:45,557
Christ.

1137
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,684
Okay.

1138
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:50,187
I'm gonna make contact
with the colonel.

1139
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:51,855
He'll send in an air strike.

1140
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:55,275
- What is that?
- A chopper, huh? An attack helicopter.

1141
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:57,986
- We use it as a diversion.
- What if my son is there?

1142
01:41:58,154 --> 01:41:59,446
- He isn't.
- How do you know?

1143
01:41:59,614 --> 01:42:03,200
I said we do it my way now, all right?
Don't fuck with me.

1144
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:15,545
Cordell, it's Danny.

1145
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:18,048
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up and listen, all right?

1146
01:42:18,216 --> 01:42:21,051
You tell the colonel I've found the stone.

1147
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:24,221
No, I haven't got it in my hands,
but I'm OP-ing its location.

1148
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:25,972
It's a major rebel camp, my man.

1149
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,517
You tell him to send in the dakadak.

1150
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:31,937
Because I stole a GPS, that's how.

1151
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:34,689
If you shut up and listen,
I could give the coordinates.

1152
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:38,151
Zero-nine-zero-five-four-two-four, north.

1153
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:42,906
Three-two-seven-two-nine
three-zero-five-zero, east.

1154
01:42:43,074 --> 01:42:45,325
I'll call back at midnight to confirm.

1155
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,039
You can look all night,
my friend, right?

1156
01:42:51,207 --> 01:42:53,875
I promise you he is not there.

1157
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:01,299
They're coming in the morning, all right?

1158
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:03,927
No movement, my friend. You stay still.

1159
01:43:05,847 --> 01:43:08,265
When it gets dark,
then we move in closer.

1160
01:43:30,454 --> 01:43:33,456
Solomon. Shit.

1161
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:45,635
I can do it.

1162
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:46,887
- Help me.
- Help him.

1163
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:49,139
Thank you, Papa.

1164
01:44:31,057 --> 01:44:33,308
Hey, you smell.

1165
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:35,977
That's fine.

1166
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:50,241
- Ready? I'm winning.
- Okay, let's go.

1167
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:52,077
Play, man.

1168
01:44:53,663 --> 01:44:56,539
- Play. Play the card.
- Play.

1169
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:24,484
Dia.

1170
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:29,239
Leave me alone.

1171
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:33,493
- Dia. I'm your papa. Come with me.
- Hey.

1172
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:35,412
- Dia.
- Get away from me.

1173
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:37,372
- Dia. Dia!
- I do not know you. Traitor!

1174
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:40,250
- Enemy! Enemy!
- What the hell are you doing?

1175
01:45:40,418 --> 01:45:41,626
- What are you doing?
- I don't know you!

1176
01:45:41,794 --> 01:45:43,086
- What's wrong?
- I hate you!

1177
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:45,005
- Dia, come with me!
- I hate you!

1178
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:46,715
Get away from me!

1179
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:51,052
- Get him!
- Don't shoot!

1180
01:45:51,554 --> 01:45:53,763
- Don't shoot! Don't-! Don't shoot!
- I hate you!

1181
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:55,849
- Fisherman! Traitor!
- Don't shoot!

1182
01:45:56,017 --> 01:45:58,268
Get away from me!

1183
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:07,527
I knew you would come back.

1184
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:11,489
I have dug and dug and dug,
but I've found nothing.

1185
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:13,575
Nothing.

1186
01:46:13,826 --> 01:46:15,326
Dig, dig, dig!

1187
01:46:15,494 --> 01:46:17,787
You will find it for me.

1188
01:46:18,789 --> 01:46:21,082
You will dig up
what you have come back for.

1189
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:22,292
No.

1190
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,878
Why should the diamond
go to the foreign devils?

1191
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:28,882
We will use it
to make the country strong.

1192
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:31,968
RUF is fighting for the people!

1193
01:46:34,305 --> 01:46:37,390
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

1194
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:41,978
Pick it up.

1195
01:46:43,147 --> 01:46:46,149
Why? You are going to kill me anyway.

1196
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:49,402
I do not need to kill you,
Solomon Vandy.

1197
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,449
If you do not bring me the diamond...

1198
01:46:54,617 --> 01:46:56,826
...I will find the rest of your family.

1199
01:46:56,994 --> 01:46:59,454
Just as I have found your son.

1200
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:03,917
I will rape your wife
in front of your eyes...

1201
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:07,003
...slit her throat...

1202
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:10,006
...and I will keep your daughters
for myself.

1203
01:47:15,387 --> 01:47:17,847
You think I am a devil...

1204
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:20,350
...but only because I have lived in hell.

1205
01:47:21,977 --> 01:47:24,646
I want to get out.

1206
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:27,357
You will help me.

1207
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:31,486
I don't remember.

1208
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:34,614
Find it or your family will die!

1209
01:47:35,533 --> 01:47:37,408
Now pick it up!

1210
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:54,384
- Go!
- Bastards!

1211
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:55,927
Shoot it!

1212
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:01,891
Dia!

1213
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:16,197
Come, boy. Come. This way. This way.

1214
01:48:17,074 --> 01:48:18,283
Dia!

1215
01:48:41,182 --> 01:48:42,765
Colonel, we think Archer's there.

1216
01:48:42,933 --> 01:48:45,768
I don't give a damn who's down there.
Kill them all.

1217
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:57,405
Dia!

1218
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:13,463
I'm coming!

1219
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:18,635
- Dia!
- Bastard!

1220
01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:43,159
No!

1221
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,597
Dia!

1222
01:51:10,831 --> 01:51:13,750
- We found his digger, sir.
- Keep him close.

1223
01:51:15,753 --> 01:51:17,920
- Danny boy.
- Colonel.

1224
01:51:18,088 --> 01:51:21,466
- Thanks for calling it in.
- Yeah, yeah. Always happy to help, huh?

1225
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:24,969
So where is it? The stone?

1226
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:27,096
We split, huh? Fifty-fifty, all right?

1227
01:51:27,264 --> 01:51:28,890
Look around you, Danny boy.

1228
01:51:29,058 --> 01:51:32,018
You're not in a position
to be dictating terms.

1229
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:34,270
Then you will never find it, sir.

1230
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:36,105
That's correct.

1231
01:51:37,775 --> 01:51:40,401
- But he will.
- Come. Up.

1232
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:44,280
Introduce me to your digger.

1233
01:51:45,824 --> 01:51:47,492
Solomon Vandy.

1234
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:49,827
This is Colonel Coetzee.
He wants the diamond.

1235
01:51:49,995 --> 01:51:53,039
- No more than you.
- Fuck.

1236
01:51:53,207 --> 01:51:55,208
You gonna show us where it's hidden?

1237
01:51:57,878 --> 01:51:59,587
Does he speak English?

1238
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:02,799
He will only tell me, sir.
I promise you that.

1239
01:52:03,634 --> 01:52:06,677
- Let me talk to him, huh?
- Go on.

1240
01:52:13,435 --> 01:52:15,812
All right, my friend.

1241
01:52:15,979 --> 01:52:17,897
End of the line here, huh?

1242
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:21,317
- You just tell him where it is, all right?
- I do not trust him.

1243
01:52:21,485 --> 01:52:24,946
I don't trust him either,
but we haven't got much of a choice here.

1244
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:29,784
I promise you
he will shoot us both in the head.

1245
01:52:30,202 --> 01:52:32,995
Right, tell him, huh?
Tell him where it is, huh?

1246
01:52:33,163 --> 01:52:35,748
- Go on. Come on.
- I'm not feeling the love, Danny.

1247
01:52:36,959 --> 01:52:39,794
All right.
No more messing about, all right?

1248
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:42,964
I said tell him where it is!
Tell him where it is! Now!

1249
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,799
Tell him!

1250
01:52:45,968 --> 01:52:47,760
- No.
- Fucking-

1251
01:52:47,928 --> 01:52:50,638
Danny, there are other ways
to do this, okay?

1252
01:52:50,806 --> 01:52:52,432
Yeah, yeah.

1253
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:03,609
- If he tells us, do we have a deal, sir?
- Seventy-thirty.

1254
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:06,195
Sixty-forty. I've already lined up a buyer.

1255
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:08,030
Agreed.

1256
01:53:13,203 --> 01:53:14,745
Come here.

1257
01:53:17,332 --> 01:53:20,751
This is his son. Vandy will do
whatever you want for his sake, all right?

1258
01:53:20,919 --> 01:53:25,715
Danny, you're a pisser, man. Well done.
Boys, we move out.

1259
01:53:28,469 --> 01:53:30,761
What do you say, Mr. Vandy?

1260
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:34,140
- You ready to take a walk?
- Come on.

1261
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:42,023
Come on.

1262
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:58,080
So who's the buyer?
I'm guessing London.

1263
01:53:58,248 --> 01:54:01,542
Well, they no longer accept
conflict diamonds, huh?

1264
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:04,170
Wouldn't hurt to interest
some other parties.

1265
01:54:04,713 --> 01:54:07,715
- Start a bidding war.
- What, one war's not enough for you, huh?

1266
01:54:08,634 --> 01:54:10,343
I missed you, Danny.

1267
01:54:10,636 --> 01:54:14,805
See? It is here.
He has tried to find it.

1268
01:54:14,973 --> 01:54:17,683
All right, Mr. Vandy.
Time for you to start digging.

1269
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:34,992
Hey, boet, have you got a smoke?

1270
01:54:35,452 --> 01:54:37,370
Smoking will kill you.

1271
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:39,622
Sorry.

1272
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:44,627
It's all right.

1273
01:54:44,795 --> 01:54:46,921
Time I quit smoking anyway,
huh, Solomon?

1274
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:02,770
- It's gone.
- What?

1275
01:55:02,938 --> 01:55:05,022
Someone has taken it.

1276
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:09,902
This is where I buried it.
It isn't here.

1277
01:55:10,362 --> 01:55:13,739
Well, then there's no reason
for any of you to stay alive. Is there?

1278
01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:19,745
Wait, wait, wait.

1279
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:22,164
I know, I know. I know where it is.

1280
01:55:22,624 --> 01:55:24,625
- I know where it is.
- It better be there.

1281
01:55:29,798 --> 01:55:30,798
Yes.

1282
01:55:30,966 --> 01:55:34,343
Oh, here, here.
It is here.

1283
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:36,178
- Yeah? Yeah, there it is.
- Yes.

1284
01:55:37,347 --> 01:55:38,723
Fuck!

1285
01:55:57,367 --> 01:55:59,327
TIA, huh, Danny?

1286
01:56:00,704 --> 01:56:02,330
TIA.

1287
01:56:09,212 --> 01:56:12,715
Keep digging, huh?
They'll be here any second. Come on.

1288
01:56:14,885 --> 01:56:16,177
Keep digging.

1289
01:56:29,024 --> 01:56:31,734
- It had better be there, huh?
- Yes, yes.

1290
01:56:34,780 --> 01:56:36,405
Have you got it?

1291
01:56:37,824 --> 01:56:41,077
- Have you got it, huh?
- Yes, got it. Oh, yes.

1292
01:56:42,537 --> 01:56:43,788
Oh, yes.

1293
01:56:45,957 --> 01:56:47,583
Solomon.

1294
01:56:54,383 --> 01:56:57,343
Dia, what are you doing?

1295
01:56:57,844 --> 01:56:59,345
Dia.

1296
01:57:00,222 --> 01:57:01,514
Look at me.

1297
01:57:01,682 --> 01:57:03,599
What are you doing?

1298
01:57:06,103 --> 01:57:08,270
You are Dia Vandy.

1299
01:57:08,438 --> 01:57:09,772
Of the proud Mende tribe.

1300
01:57:15,696 --> 01:57:20,574
You are a good boy
who loves soccer and school.

1301
01:57:22,869 --> 01:57:25,996
Your mother loves you so much.

1302
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:31,252
She waits by the fire making plantains...

1303
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:34,088
...and red palm oil stew
with your sister N'Yanda...

1304
01:57:36,341 --> 01:57:38,634
...and the new baby.

1305
01:57:47,519 --> 01:57:49,812
The cows wait for you.

1306
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:55,776
And Babu, the wild dog
who minds no one but you.

1307
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:01,657
I know they made you do bad things...

1308
01:58:01,825 --> 01:58:04,326
...but you are not a bad boy.

1309
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:09,915
I am your father...

1310
01:58:11,626 --> 01:58:13,919
...who loves you.

1311
01:58:15,172 --> 01:58:18,966
And you will come home with me
and be my son again.

1312
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:46,744
Solomon, we've got to move, huh?

1313
01:58:46,912 --> 01:58:48,496
We've got to-

1314
01:58:51,666 --> 01:58:54,376
Go, go! Move!

1315
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,714
Move. Move.

1316
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:00,174
Move, move, move!

1317
01:59:00,342 --> 01:59:03,385
Move! Move! Move!

1318
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:06,222
How far?

1319
01:59:06,389 --> 01:59:08,432
There's an airstrip
at the top of that gorge.

1320
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,726
A plane will meet us, huh?

1321
01:59:11,102 --> 01:59:13,479
Hey, stop. Stop.

1322
01:59:15,732 --> 01:59:19,735
Give it to me.
Come on, give it to me, huh?

1323
01:59:27,244 --> 01:59:30,329
Keep moving. They'll be tracking us.

1324
01:59:36,628 --> 01:59:38,712
Nabil, where are you?

1325
01:59:39,756 --> 01:59:42,424
I'm nearly there.
Tell me what's happening.

1326
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:46,053
We're about 10 K's out, huh?
We've got it, my friend.

1327
01:59:46,221 --> 01:59:48,097
- Who is we?
- The fisherman and his son.

1328
01:59:48,265 --> 01:59:49,890
Lose them.

1329
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:06,115
It's at the top of that ridge there, huh?

1330
02:00:06,283 --> 02:00:07,616
You must stop and rest.

1331
02:00:07,784 --> 02:00:10,619
What? And give up the damn stone?

1332
02:00:10,787 --> 02:00:12,830
Keep moving. Come on.

1333
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:49,825
Come. Come, come.

1334
02:01:36,915 --> 02:01:39,208
I can't. Stop.

1335
02:01:39,376 --> 02:01:41,460
- Okay.
- Stop.

1336
02:02:09,906 --> 02:02:11,031
Come on.

1337
02:02:11,616 --> 02:02:14,243
No! God, no. Stop.

1338
02:02:15,328 --> 02:02:18,664
Christ. No more. No more.

1339
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:04,293
Take it, huh?

1340
02:03:06,713 --> 02:03:09,923
- Mr. Archer-
- Take it, take it.

1341
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:18,766
I thought you would steal it from me.

1342
02:03:20,602 --> 02:03:24,229
Yeah, yeah, it occurred to me, huh?

1343
02:03:35,158 --> 02:03:36,825
Listen...

1344
02:03:39,788 --> 02:03:42,164
...this is Maddy's card, huh?

1345
02:03:42,332 --> 02:03:44,500
You call her when
you get to Conakry, all right?

1346
02:03:48,755 --> 02:03:50,714
And don't trust that pilot for a second.

1347
02:03:50,882 --> 02:03:53,967
You point this at his head
if he fucks around, all right?

1348
02:03:54,135 --> 02:03:55,594
I can carry you.

1349
02:04:08,525 --> 02:04:09,983
You take your boy home, huh?

1350
02:04:15,156 --> 02:04:17,825
You take him home, huh?

1351
02:04:22,372 --> 02:04:24,123
- Go! Go!
- Go. Come on.

1352
02:04:24,958 --> 02:04:26,041
Go on!

1353
02:04:31,798 --> 02:04:33,674
Come on. Come on.

1354
02:04:40,473 --> 02:04:42,850
Archer, you're a dead man!

1355
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:44,852
Yeah, yeah.

1356
02:05:15,550 --> 02:05:16,925
Dia.

1357
02:05:38,114 --> 02:05:39,281
Hello. Maddy Bowen.

1358
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:41,366
Yeah.

1359
02:05:41,701 --> 02:05:43,368
Thought I'd never call, huh?

1360
02:05:44,287 --> 02:05:48,332
And I'm so glad you did.
Excuse me.

1361
02:05:50,293 --> 02:05:51,460
When am I gonna see you?

1362
02:05:52,629 --> 02:05:58,342
Maddy, I want you to do me
one more favor, huh?

1363
02:05:59,052 --> 02:06:03,597
I want you to go meet Solomon
in Conakry.

1364
02:06:03,806 --> 02:06:06,475
In Guinea?
Why do you want me to go to Guinea?

1365
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:11,563
We found his son...

1366
02:06:12,523 --> 02:06:15,943
...but he's gonna need some help,
you understand?

1367
02:06:16,694 --> 02:06:17,819
Maddy?

1368
02:06:20,615 --> 02:06:22,491
You're hurt.

1369
02:06:23,117 --> 02:06:24,159
Are you hurt?

1370
02:06:24,327 --> 02:06:27,496
Yeah, well, I've got
a little problem here.

1371
02:06:32,085 --> 02:06:35,796
Okay. You-
You tell me where you are.

1372
02:06:39,050 --> 02:06:40,092
Archer?

1373
02:06:52,230 --> 02:06:56,984
I'm looking at an incredible view
right now.

1374
02:06:58,361 --> 02:07:00,028
I wish you were here, Maddy.

1375
02:07:00,196 --> 02:07:03,865
Okay, then I'm coming to be with you.
You just tell me where you are.

1376
02:07:07,036 --> 02:07:08,370
I don't think so.

1377
02:07:08,538 --> 02:07:11,873
Are you still in Kono? Because I can
get someone there to help you.

1378
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:16,336
Maddy, you find someplace safe
for the boy, all right?

1379
02:07:16,504 --> 02:07:18,880
And keep him out of sight.

1380
02:07:19,507 --> 02:07:22,217
And get Solomon to London.

1381
02:07:25,388 --> 02:07:28,140
He's bringing something with him.

1382
02:07:28,808 --> 02:07:30,726
But he's gonna need your help.

1383
02:07:31,978 --> 02:07:33,812
Why aren't you bringing it yourself?

1384
02:07:35,315 --> 02:07:40,402
I'm saying it's a real story now.

1385
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:43,030
And you can write the hell out of it.

1386
02:07:50,246 --> 02:07:52,748
I'm really happy I met you.

1387
02:07:54,334 --> 02:07:55,334
You know that?

1388
02:07:58,671 --> 02:08:00,797
Yeah, I'm...

1389
02:08:02,008 --> 02:08:05,093
I'm really happy I met you too.

1390
02:08:05,678 --> 02:08:09,681
And I wish I could be there with you.

1391
02:08:10,558 --> 02:08:12,517
That's all right.

1392
02:08:15,063 --> 02:08:17,439
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1393
02:09:11,077 --> 02:09:13,412
When we get to the stairs,
you just keep walking...

1394
02:09:13,579 --> 02:09:15,622
...and I'll wait for you here.

1395
02:09:16,165 --> 02:09:17,707
You're not coming.

1396
02:09:17,875 --> 02:09:21,169
I'm not here. Good luck.

1397
02:09:42,817 --> 02:09:45,485
You must understand, Mr. Vandy...

1398
02:09:45,653 --> 02:09:51,700
...that your diamond could have ended up
nowhere else but with us.

1399
02:09:55,037 --> 02:09:57,998
- It is not enough.
- I assure you, 2 million pounds...

1400
02:09:58,166 --> 02:10:02,043
...is more than anyone else will offer you
for that stone under the circumstances.

1401
02:10:02,211 --> 02:10:04,880
I want what was promised to me
by Mr. Archer.

1402
02:10:08,384 --> 02:10:10,886
- What was promised to you?
- My family.

1403
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:13,221
When they are here,
you will get the stone.

1404
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:15,557
I will have the money too.

1405
02:10:16,851 --> 02:10:18,393
Well, may I see what I'm buying?

1406
02:10:18,561 --> 02:10:21,313
You will get the stone
once my family is here.

1407
02:10:22,064 --> 02:10:23,899
How do I even know you've got it?

1408
02:12:31,777 --> 02:12:34,529
Can you comment on the diamonds
mined in Sierra Leone?

1409
02:12:34,697 --> 02:12:38,617
I'm not going to comment
on some sensationalist magazine article.

1410
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:41,369
- What about Liberia?
- No comment. No comment.

1411
02:12:41,537 --> 02:12:43,955
- Mr. Van De Kaap-
- That's all I have to say.

1412
02:12:44,123 --> 02:12:45,540
The natural resources
of a country...

1413
02:12:45,708 --> 02:12:47,375
Kimberley, South Africa
January, 2000

1414
02:12:47,543 --> 02:12:50,503
...are the property of its people.
They are not ours to steal...

1415
02:12:51,839 --> 02:12:57,302
...or exploit in the name of our comfort,
our corporations, or our consumerism.

1416
02:13:07,229 --> 02:13:09,272
They're ready for you, sir.

1417
02:13:10,775 --> 02:13:13,193
The Third World is not a world apart.

1418
02:13:13,361 --> 02:13:18,031
And the witness you will hear today
speaks on its behalf.

1419
02:13:18,199 --> 02:13:22,077
Let us hear the voice of that world.
Let us learn from that voice.

1420
02:13:22,244 --> 02:13:25,747
And let us ignore it no more.

1421
02:13:25,915 --> 02:13:29,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Solomon Vandy.
