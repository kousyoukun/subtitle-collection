1
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:37,380
Sierra Leone, 1 999

2
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:43,223
Civil war rages for control
of the diamond fields.

3
00:00:45,426 --> 00:00:48,987
Thousands have died
and millions have become refugees.

4
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:53,258
None of whom has ever seen a diamond.

5
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,880
Dia.

6
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,309
Don't want to be late.

7
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:17,355
English boys don't go
to school every day.

8
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,393
Every day. Just like you.

9
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:23,894
So you can become a doctor,
not mend the nets like your father...

10
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:27,326
Now get out of bed before l tan your
behind with my fishing rod.

11
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:33,303
You listen to your father.

12
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:38,945
And be careful on the road.

13
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,108
Teacher say this country
was founded as a utopia.

14
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:53,845
Do you know
what that word means, Papa?

15
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:56,387
Well, she says someday
when the war is over...

16
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:58,957
...our world will be a paradise.

17
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,492
And all this you learn in one day?

18
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:03,789
And math and science.

19
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:08,033
This is too much learning. Tomorrow,
you will stay home and mend the nets, yes?

20
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:09,328
No, Papa.

21
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:11,801
What? So now you want
to go to school every day?

22
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,729
-Stay.
-Papa.

23
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:48,307
-Stay!
-Papa!

24
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:25,971
Jassie!

25
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,004
Solomon.

26
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,695
Come, come, come.

27
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:49,800
Pick it up. Quick.

28
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:53,232
-Papa! Papa!
-Jassie.

29
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:56,308
-Dia, run!
-Papa!

30
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:03,474
-Papa! Papa!
-Dia, run!

31
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,744
Papa!

32
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:23,971
Bring forward the next one. Bastard.

33
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:25,799
Bring forward the next one.

34
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,907
-Long sleeve or short sleeve?
-No.

35
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:33,907
Young man. You must understand.

36
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:36,743
The government wants you to vote, okay?

37
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:40,580
They gonna tell you say,
''The future is in your hands.''

38
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,985
We now the future.

39
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:44,749
So we take your hands.

40
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:47,359
-No.
-No more hands, no more voting.

41
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:50,859
Chop him.

42
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:58,471
Spread the word.
The Revolutionary United Front is coming.

43
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:04,307
-RUF!
-RUF! RUF!

44
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:09,810
Bring forward the next one.
Bring him forward. Bring him forward.

45
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:14,613
Long sleeve or short sleeve?

46
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:17,522
-Short sleeve!
-Chop him.

47
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:20,051
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

48
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:23,887
Not this one. Look at him.

49
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:26,389
-Put him in the truck.
-Let's go.

50
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:27,966
Bring him to the mines.

51
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:30,296
He can work. He can work.
Move, move, move.

52
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:32,234
Next one, next one, next one.

53
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:39,405
Throughout the history of Africa...

54
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,110
...whenever a substance
of value is found...

55
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:44,274
G8 Conference on Diamonds
Antwerp, Belgium

56
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:46,818
...the locals die
in great number and in misery.

57
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:52,690
Now, this was true of ivory,
rubber, gold and oil.

58
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,259
lt is now true of diamonds.

59
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,891
According to a devastating report
by Global Witness...

60
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:04,902
...these stones are being used
to purchase arms and finance civil war.

61
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:07,870
We must act to prohibit...

62
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:12,376
...the direct or indirect import
of all rough diamonds from conflict zones.

63
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:20,008
May I remind you...

64
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:25,124
...that the U.S. is responsible for two-thirds
of all diamond purchases worldwide...

65
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:28,887
...and I don't anticipate
that demand diminishing.

66
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:31,294
We must remember
that these stones...

67
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:36,425
...comprise only a small percentage
of the legitimate diamond industry...

68
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:41,473
...whose trade is crucial to the economies
of many emerging nations.

69
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:44,907
The Freetown government
and their white masters...

70
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,707
...have raped your land
to feed their greed.

71
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:49,975
RUF have freed you.

72
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:53,484
-No more slave and master here.
-It's true.

73
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:58,751
Current estimates are that conflict stones
account for only 1 5 percent of the market.

74
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:01,326
But in a multi-billion-dollar-a-year
industry...

75
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:04,555
...that means hundreds of millions
of dollars are available...

76
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:06,632
...for weapons in these conflict zones.

77
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,268
RUF is fighting for the people!

78
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:12,200
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

79
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:17,242
Any bastard think he would joke
with me diamond, l go cut he throat.

80
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:20,572
Stop!

81
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:26,014
And we are joined today
by members of that diamond industry...

82
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,819
...who wholeheartedly
endorse your proposal.

83
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,653
l hope you join me
in applauding their presence here.

84
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:37,092
Mr. Van De Kaap and Mr. Simmons.

85
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:47,701
Give it to me.

86
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:24,540
Don't worry. We'll be fine, huh?

87
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:29,081
Listen. You take off
as soon as l'm out the door.

88
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,684
You don't land
until l raise you on the sat phone.

89
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:34,515
You be careful, Danny.

90
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:39,216
Don't worry. They want these guns
too much to do anything stupid.

91
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:55,098
Where is Commander Zero?

92
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:59,439
l am Captain Rambo.

93
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:03,846
Right. Right, l've seen your films, huh?

94
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:09,488
l'm looking for Commander Zero, huh?

95
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,488
He's inside. You talk to me.

96
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:14,628
You are here to help us
in our struggle against the government.

97
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:17,355
l'm here to do business
with Commander Zero, all right?

98
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:35,180
All right.

99
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:39,581
You are the man, huh?
You are the man.

100
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,918
Here, huh?

101
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,938
Hey. l'm talking to you! Stop!

102
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:01,165
-Commander Zero.
-Hey.

103
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:04,004
-l go kill you, eh?
-lt's fine, huh? lt's fine.

104
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:07,807
Commander Zero. Commander Zero.

105
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:11,007
Mr. Archer, come here.

106
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:19,787
You get something for me?

107
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,554
And yourself get something for me, huh?

108
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,022
First you bring back the plane.

109
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:27,028
Are you craze?
You get for pay me first for them.

110
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:46,976
This no fine, huh?

111
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:48,519
This no fine.

112
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:50,221
That's all you get!

113
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:55,387
Then your boys can use those crummy AK's
against the government's troops...

114
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:56,995
...and their new weapons, huh?

115
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:59,462
Maybe l could kill you
and take what you bring.

116
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,533
Then you get one more dead body...

117
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:04,364
...instead of airplane
way full with grenade launchers.

118
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,534
So l'm think l'm gonna go
to them government.

119
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,142
Them government,
at least them go pay me, huh?

120
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,177
Wait, wait. Wait, my friend.

121
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:19,515
This is the thing you want? Here.

122
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:21,847
So many l not know
what to do with them all.

123
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:25,516
Hey, Archer, next time,
you bring satellite TV, eh?

124
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:28,456
-l wanna see Baywatch.
-Yeah.

125
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:30,096
Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:55,544
Hello, hello, hello.

127
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:58,686
Papers, please.

128
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:01,083
Danny Archer, National Geographic.

129
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:05,795
You crossing into Liberia.

130
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:09,595
l've got a letter from the minister of interior
and a Liberian visa as well.

131
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,238
l'm doing a story on the Marrakaz,
who, as you know...

132
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:15,739
...are allowed to cross the border
in order to get into grazing grounds.

133
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,235
You ever read National Geographic, huh?

134
00:13:59,686 --> 00:14:01,950
-You're under arrest for smuggling.
-No, no, no.

135
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:04,818
Listen here, my friend.
Listen here, all right?

136
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:07,460
l am good friends
with Colonel Coetzee.

137
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:11,930
Colonel Coetzee would not be pleased
that you've interfered with his business.

138
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:13,828
Now, you know who l am, all right?

139
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:16,868
You don't wanna make trouble for me
or my friends, all right?

140
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:20,734
Now, look, why don't l just
look the other way, all right?

141
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:24,537
You take one or two of those stones
and get something lacquer for the wife...

142
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:28,545
...or maybe the mistress, all right?
We'll solve the problem right here, huh?

143
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:31,979
We'll go back to Freetown
and ask Colonel Coetzee...

144
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:35,144
...how he wishes
to thank his business associate.

145
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:36,983
Guys, take him away.

146
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:25,868
Hey! What the fuck?
What's going on there?

147
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,904
Come on! Fix that shit now!

148
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:31,340
Wasting my time here!

149
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:35,172
Fuck that stuff! Fix that shit!

150
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:37,283
-Can't work. What's going on there?
-Boss.

151
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:40,318
-Fix that thing.
-l wanna go toilet. l must go now, now.

152
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:43,786
-l can't hold it in, boss.
-Go, go.

153
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:46,092
Get to work. Go to work, go to work.

154
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,355
Fuckheads wasting my time now.
How am l work in this shit?

155
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,136
Stop!

156
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,140
Spread your fingers.

157
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:03,708
Open.

158
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:20,889
Make it quick.

159
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:58,492
Give it to me.

160
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:02,793
Give it to me.

161
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:05,471
The government troops are coming!

162
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,010
Go, go, go--!

163
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:45,442
No, no, no!

164
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:48,308
No! l'm not a rebel!

165
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:52,213
l am not a rebel! l am not R.U.F.!

166
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,687
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!

167
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:33,792
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!

168
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,090
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!

169
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:42,531
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!

170
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:51,200
RUF! RUF! RUF!

171
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:54,176
RUF! RUF! RUF!

172
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:56,747
RUF! RUF! RUF!

173
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,385
RUF! RUF! RUF!

174
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:06,657
Hey.

175
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,228
What did you do with it?

176
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:11,523
l'm talking to you, you hear me?

177
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:16,127
Where the diamond? The pink one.

178
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:19,067
-l saw you take it.
-You're mad. l do not know you.

179
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:23,175
Liar! l saw it with my own eyes.

180
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:27,980
This big. Biggest l have ever seen.

181
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:32,748
My brothers, l go give $ 1 000...

182
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,377
...to the man who cuts the diamond
out of this bastard.

183
00:19:36,556 --> 00:19:40,014
You the craze! You the craze!

184
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:41,820
Where is the diamond?

185
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:45,192
Where is the diamond?
Do you see a diamond?

186
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:51,135
You devils have taken my family!
My home! l done lost everything!

187
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:55,466
Here, look. What is left?

188
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:57,542
What is left?

189
00:19:57,711 --> 00:20:00,373
lf there is a diamond,
you are the one who has taken it!

190
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,515
Liar! The man is a liar!

191
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:06,949
l know your name, Solomon Vandy!
You have a name!

192
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,216
You have a family!
And l'll catch them!

193
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,188
And l'll find them!

194
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,172
Please tell me you brought me
cigarettes, bru, please.

195
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:34,779
l just have to tell you, Danny.

196
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:37,974
The colonel's not going to be happy
about you losing the diamonds.

197
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:41,018
Forget the colonel.
There's a fisherman in there, all right?

198
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:43,815
He might've found a pink. Big one.

199
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,117
What about the colonel?
He'll want that stone.

200
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:48,761
Screw the colonel.
l'll contact our friends in London.

201
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:52,763
lf this stone is as big as l think,
we're gonna need a real buyer, all right?

202
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:56,031
What? What?

203
00:20:56,202 --> 00:20:58,898
London wants nothing more
to do with you.

204
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:03,603
''Arrest in Sierra Leone of Daniel Archer,
former mercenary and smuggler....''

205
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:06,405
''Retains close ties
to Van De Kaap diamond cartel.

206
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:09,707
Sources say they deny
any affiliation whatso--''

207
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:11,976
Fucking hell.

208
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:15,546
Listen, his name
is Solomon Vandy, all right?

209
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:19,385
Van De Kaap is gonna want that stone,
whatever they say. You just get him out.

210
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,151
Get him out.

211
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:29,066
Yeah, can you tell Mr. Simmons
that Danny Archer called. Right.

212
00:21:29,502 --> 00:21:33,233
Archer. A-R-C-H-E-R.

213
00:21:57,397 --> 00:21:59,058
Afternoon, darling, huh?

214
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:03,134
Big white man all alone.
That is no fine.

215
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:07,763
-l'm safe, huh? No HlV.
-Yeah, yeah. l've heard that one before.

216
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:11,206
Archer, l know where to get
nice baby diamond just for you.

217
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:13,278
-Not now, next time.
-Come on, Archer.

218
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:15,744
l said not now, next time. Bugger off.

219
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:09,767
Solomon Vandy?

220
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,635
What do you want?

221
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:15,673
lt seems you made a friend in prison.

222
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:42,997
-Hey.
-How the body, Mr. Archer?

223
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,966
The body fine, M'Ed.

224
00:23:50,176 --> 00:23:51,939
So you want something nice, huh?

225
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:55,309
The best you can get ahold of, all right?

226
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:59,009
Take me a few days,
but l go find you something special.

227
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:02,018
All right. You hear
they took Marampa yesterday?

228
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:04,690
-Really?
-Now, come on.

229
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:07,520
You know every move they make.
When are they gonna hit us?

230
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:12,131
Oh, l imagine they come
do some shopping very soon.

231
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:15,529
Yeah, yeah.
Got any smokes back there?

232
00:24:15,702 --> 00:24:17,260
Yeah.

233
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:28,175
Who's that, huh?

234
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:31,007
All right.

235
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,219
-Can l offer you a cigarette?
-Oh, no, thanks.

236
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:43,053
You listening to this?

237
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:45,697
I am profoundly sorry.

238
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:49,426
The world is falling apart,
and all we hear about is Blowjobgate.

239
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,498
I believe he's sorry.

240
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:55,072
When was the last time the world
wasn't falling apart, huh?

241
00:24:57,143 --> 00:25:01,011
A cynic. Why don't you sit down
and make me miserable?

242
00:25:03,516 --> 00:25:05,711
-Danny Archer.
-Maddy Bowen.

243
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:07,682
-Pleased to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

244
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:10,488
-American, huh?
-Guilty.

245
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:12,921
Well, Americans usually are.

246
00:25:13,393 --> 00:25:15,793
Says the white South African?

247
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:18,820
l'm from Rhodesia.

248
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,158
We say Zimbabwe now,
don't we?

249
00:25:23,336 --> 00:25:26,601
-Do we?
-Last time l checked.

250
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:28,934
Don't tell me,
you're here to make a difference.

251
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:32,339
-And you're here to make a buck?
-l'm here for lack of a better idea.

252
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,976
-That's a shame.
-Not really.

253
00:25:35,148 --> 00:25:37,412
Peace Corps types only
stay around long enough...

254
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:39,484
...to realize they're not helping anyone.

255
00:25:39,652 --> 00:25:41,517
Government only wants
to stay in power...

256
00:25:41,688 --> 00:25:44,589
...until they've stolen enough
to go into exile somewhere else.

257
00:25:44,757 --> 00:25:47,385
And the rebels, they're not sure
they want to take over.

258
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,892
Otherwise,
they'd have to govern this mess.

259
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:52,361
-But TlA, right, M'Ed?
-TlA.

260
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:53,760
What's TlA?

261
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,302
-''This is Africa,'' huh?
-Right.

262
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:01,339
-You want another?
-Sure.

263
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:07,669
So which one are you?

264
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:12,413
-Smuggler?
-Am l?

265
00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:15,520
Somehow you don't strike me
as the UNlCEF type.

266
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:18,524
How about soldier of fortune?

267
00:26:18,992 --> 00:26:21,552
Or is that too much of a cliche?

268
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:23,059
Diamonds?

269
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:27,358
-lf l told you l was a missionary...?
-For Van De Kaap?

270
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:31,662
Better watch that type of talk,
Miss Bowen.

271
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:34,932
ln America, it's bling-bling,
but out here, it's bling-bang, huh?

272
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:38,336
l wouldn't want you
getting in any trouble.

273
00:26:39,612 --> 00:26:41,876
How much trouble
do you think l would get into...

274
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,313
...for talking about blood diamonds?

275
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:51,181
-You're a journalist.
-That's right.

276
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:56,720
Piss off, huh?

277
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:04,332
For five years, this country has reported
almost no diamond exports...

278
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:08,167
...while Liberia, right next door,
has exported 2 billion dollars' worth.

279
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:11,367
Very odd, considering that Liberia
has no diamonds to speak of.

280
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:12,533
l'm shocked.

281
00:27:12,712 --> 00:27:16,045
Van De Kaap denies trading blood
diamonds, but admits it's impossible...

282
00:27:16,215 --> 00:27:20,549
...to tell where a diamond comes from
unless their smuggler gets caught.

283
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,415
What do you want from me, huh?

284
00:27:22,588 --> 00:27:27,116
You know all about Van De Kaap.
Help me out. Off the record.

285
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,820
Well, off the record, l like to get kissed
before l get fucked, huh?

286
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,594
Shit.

287
00:28:08,935 --> 00:28:12,427
-Cordell. How is it, Shona?
-Long time, pal.

288
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:15,972
-How's Alice?
-She's well, thanks.

289
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:17,973
Tim must be in school, right?

290
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:20,476
-Big kids, big problems, you know?
-Yeah, yeah.

291
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:23,240
l heard you got into a spot of trouble
in the bush, huh?

292
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:25,816
Well, you know the bush, right, bru?

293
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:29,146
-Company doing well?
-Can't complain.

294
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:31,950
Eleven wars in the continent.
We're keeping busy.

295
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,559
So, what, you're here on holiday, huh?

296
00:28:36,262 --> 00:28:38,162
-How's the colonel?
-He sends his regards.

297
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:42,028
Good, good. Score us a loose, huh?

298
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,331
Smoking will kill you, bru.

299
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:46,833
Only if l live, right?

300
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:54,078
That's for breaking my TV, bru.

301
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:02,478
Tell the colonel he'll get his money.
l'll come see him soon.

302
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:10,456
Ten more.

303
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,531
Come. Come.

304
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:21,129
Go on.

305
00:29:35,321 --> 00:29:39,257
Dia. Dia. Come here.
Get away from there.

306
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:42,521
Go. Go, Mama.

307
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:44,629
Stay down.

308
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:49,857
Please...

309
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:53,103
l must talk to someone. My family's
name is not on the list.

310
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:54,805
Go to Kissy, there is another list.

311
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:57,171
l have been to Kissy, and Waterloo, and
Port Loko, and--

312
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:59,636
Talk to the whites.

313
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:04,409
Excuse me,
my name's Solomon Vandy--

314
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:06,677
-Check the list.
-l have checked the list.

315
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:11,313
-File papers at the Office for Refugees.
-Sir, l have filed papers with the office.

316
00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:13,482
Then God help you,
because l can't.

317
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:14,717
-Please, sir--
-Next.

318
00:30:14,894 --> 00:30:17,021
-Sir-- Sir, no, please.
-Hey, hey. Me, me, me.

319
00:30:17,196 --> 00:30:20,962
Husband here. One year we look.

320
00:30:25,471 --> 00:30:27,632
Hurry, Mom. Go.

321
00:30:32,812 --> 00:30:34,177
Dia! Dia!

322
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:35,336
-Jassie!
-Dia!

323
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:37,107
-Mama!
-Dia!

324
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:39,444
Jassie! Mama!

325
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,863
Cape Town,
South Africa

326
00:31:01,707 --> 00:31:04,540
He's been waiting.
What took you?

327
00:31:05,244 --> 00:31:08,611
What are you gonna do,
shoot me right here, huh, Shona?

328
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:11,875
Now, don't be a wanker, man. Get in.

329
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,350
-Hello, Danny.
-Colonel.

330
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,316
You look well.

331
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:51,650
Clean living and a pure heart,
l suppose, huh?

332
00:31:51,991 --> 00:31:53,686
Walk with me.

333
00:31:55,461 --> 00:31:58,294
lt seems the rebels have taken back
the diamond fields, Danny.

334
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,796
The government
of Sierra Leone has contracted us...

335
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:02,935
...to go in there
and take the rebels down.

336
00:32:03,102 --> 00:32:04,694
So you sell the rebels weapons...

337
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,532
...the government hires you
when they use them? Nice, sir.

338
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:10,874
l assume you're asking
for mining concessions, huh?

339
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:14,171
We save the government,
they show their gratitude.

340
00:32:14,347 --> 00:32:16,645
And you get rich, right?

341
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:22,511
How long have l known you, Danny?

342
00:32:22,955 --> 00:32:26,118
l was.... l was 1 9, sir.

343
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:30,887
And you survived.
A lot of boys didn't. Why is that?

344
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:34,960
Just lucky, l guess.

345
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:41,738
No, you were a good soldier.
But l made you better, didn't l?

346
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:46,544
Yes, sir. Yes, you did.

347
00:32:46,712 --> 00:32:49,738
And over the years,
didn't l protect you...

348
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:54,108
...teach you about diamonds,
cut you in on the deals?

349
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:57,949
-Some might call it that, yeah.
-But not you...

350
00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:02,587
...because you done with me now, eh?
On to bigger things.

351
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:08,199
l need a man that knows
his way around up there.

352
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:12,133
Unless, of course,
you wanna cut me in. Something pink?

353
00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:14,729
Sir....

354
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:17,034
Our deal went bad,
and you owe me money.

355
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,938
l'll take a stone as payment.

356
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:22,979
Look, do you think if l found a stone
like that, l'd still be on this continent?

357
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:26,983
-Come on.
-Danny, give me your hand.

358
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:33,720
That's red earth. lt's in our skin.

359
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:36,593
The Shona say the color
comes from all the blood...

360
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:39,322
...that's being spilled
fighting over the land.

361
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:45,929
This is home.
You'll never leave Africa.

362
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:51,370
lf you say so, sir.

363
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:10,521
So, what did you do, bury it?

364
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:15,292
Yeah. Yeah, l would have
buried it, huh?

365
00:34:15,468 --> 00:34:19,495
-What are you talking about?
-What am l talking about? Come on, bru.

366
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:21,105
l'm late for work.

367
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:23,798
Pink, huh? The biggest one
he'd ever seen.

368
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:26,103
You were in the mining camps,
weren't you, bru?

369
00:34:26,278 --> 00:34:29,770
Why else would that rebel with
the bandaged eye make up such a story?

370
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:32,179
Go ask him.

371
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:47,727
Thank you.

372
00:34:57,376 --> 00:35:00,174
Your mothers and fathers,
your brothers and sisters are dead.

373
00:35:00,346 --> 00:35:02,211
-You are dead! You have been reborn.
-No!

374
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:05,612
-We are your family now.
-No! No!

375
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:15,824
Your parents are weak.

376
00:35:16,395 --> 00:35:20,832
They're the farmers.
They're the fishermen.

377
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,894
They've done nothing
but suck the blood from this country.

378
00:35:26,272 --> 00:35:30,732
But you are the heroes
who will save this nation.

379
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,978
You are not children anymore.

380
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:35,913
You're men.

381
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:41,280
No one has ever given you respect...

382
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:44,547
...but with this in your hand,
they go fear you.

383
00:35:44,723 --> 00:35:47,214
lf you do not get
the respect you deserve...

384
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:49,691
...you will take it
by shedding their blood.

385
00:35:49,862 --> 00:35:53,821
-Repeat after me, shed their blood.
-Shed their blood.

386
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:57,059
-Louder! Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
-Shed their blood!

387
00:35:57,236 --> 00:36:00,364
Make them hear you in Freetown.
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

388
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:03,099
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

389
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:06,176
-Dia Vandy, stand up.
-Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

390
00:36:06,345 --> 00:36:09,246
-Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
-Put your hand on the gun.

391
00:36:09,415 --> 00:36:11,007
Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

392
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:12,775
Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

393
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:15,978
-Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
-Now squeeze the trigger.

394
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:20,925
Come on, Dia. Pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger!

395
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,622
l know, l know.
lt's hard to be a man.

396
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:02,891
Sit up. Come.

397
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:07,368
But you are a soldier
of the revolution now.

398
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:10,440
And l am your commander.

399
00:37:10,943 --> 00:37:12,808
Whatever you need...

400
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:16,209
...guns, CDs, food...

401
00:37:16,382 --> 00:37:20,045
...come to me.
l will take care of you.

402
00:37:23,355 --> 00:37:29,760
Today, you are promoted
to the rank of captain.

403
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:36,357
Dia Vandy...

404
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,801
...boss man.

405
00:37:57,556 --> 00:37:59,183
How's it, bru?

406
00:37:59,725 --> 00:38:02,888
-You got something for me, huh?
-Yeah.

407
00:38:03,662 --> 00:38:07,063
-So, what's new, M'Ed?
-Fucking RUF.

408
00:38:07,232 --> 00:38:09,757
Tried to hit the government building
across the street.

409
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:14,599
Shit, man, half the people
be soldiers today, RUF tomorrow.

410
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:18,174
-Might be time to get your family out, huh?
-And go where?

411
00:38:18,344 --> 00:38:22,075
Just fire up the chopper
and fly away like you people?

412
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:24,279
This my country, man.

413
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,908
We here long before you came,
long after you gone.

414
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:40,092
-Hi. l'm Maddy Bowen.
-How about you dance with me?

415
00:38:40,265 --> 00:38:43,632
-No, l don't dance.
-Neither do l. Come on.

416
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:51,241
-So, Danny....
-Archer.

417
00:38:51,543 --> 00:38:52,601
Archer.

418
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:57,173
When did you first start
moving stones? Was it Angola?

419
00:38:58,951 --> 00:39:03,547
Then you did the whole
mercenary thing. Was that fun?

420
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,753
So, what are you?
Nihilist? Opportunist?

421
00:39:08,961 --> 00:39:11,088
Maybe l wasn't breast-fed
as a child, huh?

422
00:39:13,232 --> 00:39:15,666
You think l haven't met
people like you before?

423
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:19,201
-l think you get off on people like me.
-You think?

424
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,465
When did you first start
working for Van De Kaap?

425
00:39:25,044 --> 00:39:26,671
Christ, you never stop, do you?

426
00:39:27,946 --> 00:39:31,313
No, l never stop.

427
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:33,609
Do you want me to stop?

428
00:39:34,987 --> 00:39:38,889
Why don't we go back to your place,
see what's in the minibar, huh?

429
00:39:39,058 --> 00:39:41,151
l'm a print journalist. l drank it.

430
00:39:42,428 --> 00:39:45,158
ls it possible that you don't care
how many people die...

431
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,230
...because of the deals you do?

432
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:50,630
People here kill each other as a way of life.
Always been like that.

433
00:39:50,903 --> 00:39:53,736
So you can just watch it
and go about your day?

434
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,133
Maybe we should all just
write about it, then.

435
00:39:57,309 --> 00:39:59,641
Look, thanks for the dance, huh?

436
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:05,214
-And a shot too, huh, M'Ed?
-Sure.

437
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:10,351
You're a hard case, huh?

438
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:13,514
Tell me something,
how long you been here in Africa, huh?

439
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:17,024
Three months. And before that,
Afghanistan and Bosnia.

440
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:19,422
You come here
with your laptop computer...

441
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:23,534
...and your malaria medicine
and your little bottles of hand sanitizer.

442
00:40:24,303 --> 00:40:27,329
Think you're gonna change
the outcome, huh?

443
00:40:27,506 --> 00:40:30,100
Let me tell you something.
You sell blood diamonds too.

444
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:31,765
-Really?
-Yeah.

445
00:40:31,944 --> 00:40:32,933
Tell me, how is that?

446
00:40:33,112 --> 00:40:35,376
Who do you think buys
the stones that l bring out?

447
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:39,176
Dreamy American girls who all want
a storybook wedding and a big, shiny rock...

448
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:42,912
...like the ones in the advertisements
of your politically-correct magazines.

449
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:46,080
So, please, don't come here
and make judgments on me, all right?

450
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:51,793
l provide a service. The world wants what
we have, and they want it cheap.

451
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:55,195
We're in business together.
Get over yourself, darling.

452
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:59,763
Okay, just to clarify, not all American girls
want a storybook wedding...

453
00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:02,839
...just like not all Africans kill each other
as a way of life.

454
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:05,408
And yeah, it's a shit, shit world,
but you know what?

455
00:41:05,577 --> 00:41:09,445
Good things are done every day,
just, apparently, not by you.

456
00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:14,075
This place is about to explode.

457
00:41:14,353 --> 00:41:16,378
l wanna spend my time
with someone else.

458
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:30,492
You are listening to BBC World Service.

459
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:34,400
In Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United Front
forces have been sighted...

460
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:37,303
...within 1 0 kilometers
of the capital city of Freetown.

461
00:41:37,476 --> 00:41:40,138
The minister of the interior
has expressed confidence...

462
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:42,678
...that the government troops
can repel the attack.

463
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:46,113
All foreign nationals are being advised
to leave the country.

464
00:41:46,285 --> 00:41:48,446
There are also unconfirmed reports...

465
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,681
...that atrocities are being committed by
both sides in the rapidly worsening situation.

466
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:56,794
The United Nations has described
the refugee situation as critical.

467
00:42:08,373 --> 00:42:10,773
Don't tell me you're gonna try
and sell it yourself.

468
00:42:10,943 --> 00:42:13,468
To who?
And for what price, my friend?

469
00:42:13,645 --> 00:42:15,670
You need my help,
whether you like it or not.

470
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:18,907
-What are you talking about?
-Here, let me help you with that.

471
00:42:19,084 --> 00:42:22,952
You hear that? You hear that?
They came into the city overnight.

472
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:25,419
lt's started.
What are you gonna do now, huh?

473
00:42:25,591 --> 00:42:29,891
Listen, the right stone can buy anything.
lnformation, safety, even freedom.

474
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:32,496
But a big stone does not stay secret
for very long.

475
00:42:32,664 --> 00:42:35,929
The moment you tell anyone about it,
your life is absolutely worthless.

476
00:42:36,101 --> 00:42:39,229
The only reason you're alive is
you haven't told anyone where it is.

477
00:42:39,404 --> 00:42:40,666
Am l right? Am l?

478
00:42:41,073 --> 00:42:43,098
Who do you think got you
out of jail, huh?

479
00:42:43,275 --> 00:42:46,335
-That makes us partners.
-l am not your partner!

480
00:42:46,511 --> 00:42:49,002
What if l helped you find your family?

481
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:50,705
What do you know of my family?

482
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:53,908
The relief agencies are useless,
the hospitals are overwhelmed.

483
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:56,680
-There are other ways, bru.
-Liar.

484
00:42:56,855 --> 00:43:00,086
Look at me. l know people, huh?
White people.

485
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:03,387
Without me, you're just another
black man in Africa, all right?

486
00:43:06,765 --> 00:43:08,494
Oh, shit.

487
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:11,827
We got no time.
What's it gonna be?

488
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:13,995
You would say anything.
How can l trust you?

489
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:17,573
l don't give a fuck about you, all right?
That diamond could be priceless!

490
00:43:17,743 --> 00:43:22,009
We split it, and you get your family.
What's it gonna be, yes or no? Yes or no?

491
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,774
-Where will we go? Where do we go?
-Come on, follow me!

492
00:43:56,214 --> 00:43:57,841
Stay low!

493
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:00,946
Get your ass over here!

494
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:13,055
Wait!

495
00:44:13,498 --> 00:44:15,159
Now!

496
00:44:20,305 --> 00:44:21,863
Come on, come on.

497
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:27,276
Come on!

498
00:44:43,495 --> 00:44:45,087
Come on.

499
00:44:45,263 --> 00:44:46,457
Fuck!

500
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:57,572
No, this way.

501
00:44:58,009 --> 00:44:59,499
Fire!

502
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:17,160
Fuck! Go, go, go!

503
00:45:17,462 --> 00:45:19,054
Go!

504
00:45:29,074 --> 00:45:30,871
Shit!

505
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:32,703
No! No!

506
00:45:41,186 --> 00:45:42,915
This way.

507
00:46:02,774 --> 00:46:04,935
This way. Stay low.

508
00:46:16,354 --> 00:46:18,117
Come on. Go, go, go. Come on.

509
00:46:25,096 --> 00:46:26,859
Come on!

510
00:46:32,237 --> 00:46:34,762
lt's okay. lt's okay, it's okay.

511
00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:02,592
Fire!

512
00:48:44,436 --> 00:48:48,202
-ls there another way?
-That bridge is the only way across, huh?

513
00:48:48,373 --> 00:48:50,534
So, what do we do?

514
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:06,120
-You are RUF, huh? And l am your prisoner.
-What do you mean?

515
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:09,351
You wanna see your son again, don't you?
You stay behind me.

516
00:49:10,061 --> 00:49:11,688
Wait, wait. Wait.

517
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:17,395
Bring that pink chicken skin
over here, huh?

518
00:49:17,569 --> 00:49:19,969
Now let me shoot that pink ass, boy.

519
00:49:55,674 --> 00:49:57,608
Where are we going?

520
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:00,936
Lungi's under government control.

521
00:50:01,112 --> 00:50:05,572
l'm gonna try to locate a sat phone
to get in contact with my pilot, all right?

522
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,116
l have agreed to nothing.

523
00:50:08,987 --> 00:50:11,478
You're in a bit of a conundrum there,
my friend.

524
00:50:11,656 --> 00:50:15,922
You know what that means?
lt means you have no choice.

525
00:50:29,808 --> 00:50:32,971
So you're a fisherman, huh?

526
00:50:33,144 --> 00:50:36,978
-What do you catch mostly?
-Fish.

527
00:50:45,356 --> 00:50:46,789
Come on.

528
00:50:59,003 --> 00:51:00,527
-Hello.
-Back away from the fence.

529
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:03,299
Listen, l'm from
the Cape Herald, all right?

530
00:51:03,475 --> 00:51:06,410
My wallet, my credentials,
everything got left in Freetown.

531
00:51:06,578 --> 00:51:09,240
We barely got out with our lives.
Can we just get through?

532
00:51:09,414 --> 00:51:12,440
Back away from the fence.

533
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,082
But you are not a journalist.

534
00:51:18,256 --> 00:51:19,689
l'm trying to get us to Kono.

535
00:51:19,858 --> 00:51:22,258
-Do you understand that, huh?
-Getting B-roll. Wait.

536
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:24,987
Listen, l'm coming back.
l'm coming back just now.

537
00:51:25,163 --> 00:51:28,223
How's it, my bru?
Have you got an extra smoke?

538
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:30,128
-Here.
-Oh, cheers.

539
00:51:30,301 --> 00:51:33,327
l'm looking for someone, an American
by the name of Maddy Bowen.

540
00:51:33,505 --> 00:51:36,269
-lf you saw her, you would not forget it.
-Yeah, l know her.

541
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:37,430
-ls it?
-Yeah.

542
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:41,204
Can you tell her Danny Archer's looking
for her? l've got the story she wants.

543
00:51:41,379 --> 00:51:44,576
Okay, but l'm going out for a bit.
lf l see her before, l'll tell her.

544
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:46,979
Magic. Listen, we'll be
right down the road, huh?

545
00:51:47,152 --> 00:51:50,019
-Sweet. Cheers, bru.
-Cheers.

546
00:51:51,389 --> 00:51:54,825
lt is as l said.
You will say anything.

547
00:52:01,332 --> 00:52:02,993
-You don't mind waiting?
-No worries.

548
00:52:03,168 --> 00:52:07,036
-Thank you so much. l'll just be a sec.
-All right, Maddy.

549
00:52:10,408 --> 00:52:11,807
Hi.

550
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:13,739
You got out.

551
00:52:13,912 --> 00:52:16,972
Yes. Hello again.

552
00:52:17,148 --> 00:52:19,480
-This is Solomon Vandy.
-Hi.

553
00:52:19,651 --> 00:52:21,175
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

554
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:24,920
So l'm on deadline. l've been waiting
four hours to use the phone.

555
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:29,389
-l've got someone holding my place in line.
-l understand. Come with me, huh?

556
00:52:30,028 --> 00:52:32,121
All right. Here it is.

557
00:52:32,297 --> 00:52:35,232
-There's a company called Tiara Diamonds.
-Right?

558
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,698
They get the stones
that l smuggle into Liberia.

559
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:40,235
Now, Van De Kaap
has no visible ties to Tiara...

560
00:52:40,405 --> 00:52:43,704
...but through a series of cross holdings
and offshore bank accounts...

561
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:46,002
-...they actually own it.
-You can prove this?

562
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:50,870
-lf you help me out, yeah.
-Right, here it comes.

563
00:52:51,049 --> 00:52:53,574
Before you say anything,
look at that man. You see him?

564
00:52:54,018 --> 00:52:58,614
His entire village was burned down.
His wife and children, they got away.

565
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,987
He's been working in the mining camps,
trying to get his family back.

566
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,752
He cannot get through the red tape.

567
00:53:03,928 --> 00:53:06,692
All l'm asking is this,
that you help him, huh?

568
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:08,890
And how do you know this man?

569
00:53:09,534 --> 00:53:13,368
-l know him. l know him.
-Oh, come on, Archer.

570
00:53:13,805 --> 00:53:15,363
You're using him.

571
00:53:16,941 --> 00:53:21,207
l'm using him, and you are using me,
and this is how it works, isn't it?

572
00:53:21,379 --> 00:53:24,143
Come on. Look, you've got access
to U.N. databases.

573
00:53:24,315 --> 00:53:26,215
-You can track his family for him.
-Why?

574
00:53:26,384 --> 00:53:29,547
This whole country's at war.
Why should l help just one person?

575
00:53:35,193 --> 00:53:37,161
l can't believe l just said that.

576
00:53:40,398 --> 00:53:43,026
My family's here, in Guinea?

577
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:45,499
Yes, according to the manifest.

578
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:48,200
l do not know how to thank you.

579
00:53:59,884 --> 00:54:03,251
Tassin Camp
Forecariah, Guinea

580
00:54:14,198 --> 00:54:16,894
Thank you. Thank you.

581
00:54:31,316 --> 00:54:33,580
This is what a million people looks like.

582
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:40,855
At the moment, the second largest
refugee camp in Africa.

583
00:54:41,426 --> 00:54:47,126
Might catch a minute of this on CNN,
somewhere between Sports and Weather.

584
00:54:56,607 --> 00:54:57,938
-Hello.
-Yeah, hello?

585
00:54:58,109 --> 00:55:00,475
l've spoken with Colonel Coedoo...

586
00:55:00,912 --> 00:55:03,779
...and highlighted the names
we're looking for.

587
00:55:03,948 --> 00:55:05,142
-Move away.
-What him doing?

588
00:55:05,316 --> 00:55:06,681
Okay, l'm gonna check for you.

589
00:55:06,851 --> 00:55:09,376
-Wait me there.
-Okay, thank you.

590
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:10,813
We are here to help you.

591
00:55:10,989 --> 00:55:13,253
This woman says she has
spoken to Coedoo.

592
00:55:13,424 --> 00:55:17,190
An entire country made homeless.

593
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:23,465
Two multiplied by three
is equal to six.

594
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:27,161
Two multiplied by four
is equal to eight.

595
00:55:27,338 --> 00:55:30,569
Two multiplied by five
is equal to 1 0.

596
00:55:30,742 --> 00:55:33,836
Two multiplied by six
is equal to 1 2.

597
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:13,077
Jassie.

598
00:56:14,218 --> 00:56:15,708
Jassie!

599
00:56:16,454 --> 00:56:18,183
Jassie!

600
00:56:18,356 --> 00:56:19,516
-Jassie.
-Solo.

601
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:20,918
-Jassie.
-Solo.

602
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:23,457
Jassie. Jassie.

603
00:56:25,563 --> 00:56:27,326
-Solomon.
-Jassie.

604
00:56:36,107 --> 00:56:37,335
-Solomon.
-Jassie.

605
00:56:37,742 --> 00:56:38,731
Where is Dia?

606
00:56:39,077 --> 00:56:40,874
Dia. Dia.

607
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:43,108
Where is Dia?

608
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:45,473
Where is my son?

609
00:56:46,918 --> 00:56:48,044
Jassie!

610
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,809
Where is my son?

611
00:56:51,622 --> 00:56:52,611
Where is my son?

612
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:54,947
They took him.

613
00:56:58,763 --> 00:57:00,993
They took him.

614
00:57:05,403 --> 00:57:07,394
There are only two children
on the manifest.

615
00:57:07,572 --> 00:57:10,097
-Where is my son?
-Oh, Christ.

616
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:12,239
Where is my son?

617
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,173
-Away from the fence.
-Where is my son?

618
00:57:14,345 --> 00:57:15,607
Move away from the fence.

619
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,840
-Let them out! Let them out!
-Keep away from the fence.

620
00:57:20,251 --> 00:57:21,445
Let them out!

621
00:57:22,954 --> 00:57:24,353
Let them out!

622
00:57:24,956 --> 00:57:25,945
Away from the fence.

623
00:57:26,324 --> 00:57:27,757
Let them out!

624
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:29,722
-They'll shoot you!
-Jassie!

625
00:57:29,894 --> 00:57:32,260
No! Solo!

626
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:34,728
Do you want your wife and child
to watch you die?

627
00:57:35,433 --> 00:57:38,231
Solo! Solo!

628
00:57:47,678 --> 00:57:52,240
They said they're concerned that
some of the refugees might be rebels...

629
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:56,514
...so they refused to release them
until there's a cease-fire.

630
00:57:57,922 --> 00:58:00,686
l'm so sorry, Solomon.

631
00:58:01,058 --> 00:58:03,720
What you want, Mr. Archer,
is beyond those hills...

632
00:58:03,895 --> 00:58:06,056
...where l buried it.

633
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:34,223
You say the mine is on the Sewa River.
Where exactly?

634
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,883
Solomon.

635
00:58:37,895 --> 00:58:39,760
l do not need a map.

636
00:58:39,931 --> 00:58:44,334
Yeah, well, l do.
Look, we are down here, huh?

637
00:58:44,502 --> 00:58:46,265
The press convoy
is on its way to Kono.

638
00:58:46,437 --> 00:58:49,736
You say the diamond mine is up here.
Where did you bury it?

639
00:58:53,077 --> 00:58:56,274
When we get to Kono,
we're gonna have to walk, all right?

640
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:59,211
You damn well better be able to find it.

641
00:59:01,152 --> 00:59:05,384
My son is a very good student.

642
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:09,185
He walks five kilometers
to the Sister School...

643
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,727
...every morning to study English.

644
00:59:14,565 --> 00:59:17,625
He's going to be a doctor one day.

645
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:45,828
''ln the 90-degree heat,
Solomon Vandy drops to his knees...

646
00:59:45,997 --> 00:59:49,660
...rattling the wire
with his powerful hands.''

647
00:59:53,204 --> 00:59:55,968
-What?
-Nothing.

648
00:59:58,075 --> 01:00:00,100
Do you think l'm exploiting his grief?

649
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,842
You're right. lt's shit.

650
01:00:04,615 --> 01:00:07,345
lt's like one of those infomercials.

651
01:00:07,518 --> 01:00:12,353
You know, the little black babies
with swollen bellies and flies in their eyes.

652
01:00:12,523 --> 01:00:16,425
So here l've got dead mothers,
l've got severed limbs, but it's nothing new.

653
01:00:16,594 --> 01:00:19,188
lt might be enough
to make people cry if they read it...

654
01:00:19,363 --> 01:00:20,830
...maybe even write a check...

655
01:00:20,998 --> 01:00:23,364
...but it's not gonna be enough
to make it stop.

656
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:28,230
l am sick of writing about victims,
but it's all l can fucking do.

657
01:00:28,406 --> 01:00:29,930
Because l need facts.

658
01:00:30,107 --> 01:00:34,635
l need names. l need dates.
l need pictures. l need bank accounts.

659
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:39,206
People back home
wouldn't buy a ring...

660
01:00:39,383 --> 01:00:41,647
...if they knew it cost
someone else their hand.

661
01:00:42,286 --> 01:00:44,447
But l can't write that story...

662
01:00:44,622 --> 01:00:48,149
...until l get facts
that can be verified...

663
01:00:48,326 --> 01:00:53,457
...which is to say, until l find someone
who will go on record.

664
01:00:54,632 --> 01:00:56,156
So if that is not you...

665
01:00:56,334 --> 01:01:00,430
...and you're not really gonna help me,
and we're not really gonna screw...

666
01:01:00,604 --> 01:01:03,835
...then why don't you get the fuck
out of my face...

667
01:01:04,008 --> 01:01:05,908
...and let me do my work?

668
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:17,987
Do you know that Solomon thinks
his son's gonna be a doctor one day?

669
01:01:20,758 --> 01:01:23,921
Maybe his baby dies in that camp.
Maybe his daughter gets raped.

670
01:01:24,261 --> 01:01:26,422
Who knows, maybe both.

671
01:01:28,499 --> 01:01:30,262
Do you realize that
that diamond...

672
01:01:30,434 --> 01:01:33,198
...is the only chance he has
of getting his family out?

673
01:01:33,371 --> 01:01:37,603
-You don't give a rat's ass about his family.
-Do you understand that?

674
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,139
Listen, l need to get to Kono, all right?

675
01:01:45,316 --> 01:01:47,409
The only way
is with the press convoy.

676
01:01:47,585 --> 01:01:49,951
l'm a journalist,
and he's my cameraman, all right?

677
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:51,645
-No.
-Please, Maddy.

678
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:53,449
-Please.
-No!

679
01:02:06,771 --> 01:02:09,137
After l smuggle the stones
across the border...

680
01:02:10,307 --> 01:02:13,037
...local buyers get them
to a middleman in Monrovia.

681
01:02:16,881 --> 01:02:18,178
Go on.

682
01:02:19,683 --> 01:02:24,552
He pays off Customs and then certifies
that the diamonds were mined in Liberia.

683
01:02:24,722 --> 01:02:27,088
That way, they can be legally exported.

684
01:02:27,658 --> 01:02:30,752
Now, once they've reached
the buyers in Antwerp...

685
01:02:30,928 --> 01:02:33,419
...diamonds are brought
to the sorting tables...

686
01:02:33,597 --> 01:02:35,189
...no more questions are asked.

687
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:38,130
By the time they get to lndia...

688
01:02:38,302 --> 01:02:42,033
...the dirty stones are mixed with
the clean stones from all over the world...

689
01:02:42,206 --> 01:02:44,470
...and then they become
like any other diamonds.

690
01:02:44,642 --> 01:02:46,837
And Van De Kaap
knows about all this?

691
01:02:48,446 --> 01:02:49,504
Yeah.

692
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,342
When I get to London,
I meet with Simmons.

693
01:02:52,783 --> 01:02:56,219
Supply and demand. You control the supply,
and you keep the demand high.

694
01:02:56,387 --> 01:02:57,854
-Agreed.
-Good.

695
01:02:58,022 --> 01:03:00,388
Now, there's an underground vault...

696
01:03:00,558 --> 01:03:04,119
...where they put all the stones
they buy up to keep off the market...

697
01:03:04,295 --> 01:03:06,126
...so they can keep the price high.

698
01:03:06,897 --> 01:03:10,298
lf rebels wanna flood the market
with a billion dollars' worth of rough...

699
01:03:10,468 --> 01:03:13,528
...a company like Van De Kaap,
who says that they're rare...

700
01:03:13,704 --> 01:03:15,365
...can't afford to let that happen.

701
01:03:15,539 --> 01:03:17,803
Especially when they're telling
some poor sod...

702
01:03:17,975 --> 01:03:20,466
...he's supposed to shell out
three months' salary...

703
01:03:20,644 --> 01:03:21,975
...for an engagement ring.

704
01:03:22,146 --> 01:03:25,138
Now, technically speaking,
they're not financing the war...

705
01:03:25,316 --> 01:03:28,149
...but creating a situation
where it pays to keep it going.

706
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,550
-You understand?
-Yes. And where's my proof?

707
01:03:38,028 --> 01:03:42,158
Names, dates and numbered accounts.

708
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:47,328
You publish one word of this story
before l give them the stone...

709
01:03:47,505 --> 01:03:49,530
...and l'm dead, huh?

710
01:03:49,707 --> 01:03:54,076
After l give it to them,
then...l leave this continent forever.

711
01:03:56,313 --> 01:03:58,110
lf you don't come out
with the diamond?

712
01:03:58,282 --> 01:04:00,682
Then write whatever you want.

713
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:03,612
l'm already dead.

714
01:04:10,461 --> 01:04:14,124
Now, remember. All you say is,
''l am the cameraman,'' all right?

715
01:04:14,298 --> 01:04:16,232
Listen, l cannot do this.

716
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,028
-Why not?
-Because l am not a journalist.

717
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:21,694
-Of course you're not.
-Well, then how can l say l am?

718
01:04:21,872 --> 01:04:25,069
Because you do. Because that's how
you get your son back, all right?

719
01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:27,642
Now get on the bus. Go.

720
01:04:44,328 --> 01:04:47,229
l am the cameraman.

721
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,331
You are writing about
what is happening here?

722
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,129
Yes.

723
01:04:57,308 --> 01:05:01,506
So when people in your country read it,
they will come help us, yes?

724
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:03,304
Probably not.

725
01:05:04,915 --> 01:05:07,281
-You heard of a Stinger?
-What?

726
01:05:07,451 --> 01:05:11,911
Your friend, Maddy. She's like a full-on,
heat-seeking missile, bru.

727
01:05:12,089 --> 01:05:14,785
l mean, l saw her go into Afghanistan...

728
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:18,087
...like about 200 clicks
into Taliban land.

729
01:05:18,262 --> 01:05:21,095
When the military said no,
she just took a bus, bru.

730
01:05:21,265 --> 01:05:24,564
Came back with 3000 words,
and she still looked so good.

731
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,600
-Like hot, you know?
-All right.

732
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,499
Calm down to the frantic now, huh?

733
01:05:30,107 --> 01:05:31,938
-What's that?
-What's going on?

734
01:05:33,077 --> 01:05:34,305
Looks like it was an RPG.

735
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:36,309
Open the door. Let us out.

736
01:05:36,647 --> 01:05:38,581
-Let's go, let's go.
-Come on. Go, go, go.

737
01:05:40,551 --> 01:05:42,018
Go, go! Move, move, move!

738
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:45,721
We've just happened upon
the sight of an ambush...

739
01:05:46,857 --> 01:05:49,189
...fifteen kilometers
from the Liberian border...

740
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,988
-...near the Moa River....
-As you can see behind me...

741
01:05:52,162 --> 01:05:53,686
...just a few minutes ago...

742
01:05:53,864 --> 01:05:56,196
-...an ambulance has....
-Got movement in the bush.

743
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,425
-Check out the head of the road.
-Spread out.

744
01:05:58,602 --> 01:06:00,331
--at this site.
Dozens of--

745
01:06:01,338 --> 01:06:03,272
Many are injured.

746
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:16,580
Get back on the bus, huh?
Get back on! Come on!

747
01:06:16,754 --> 01:06:18,381
-Maddy!
-Move it! Move it!

748
01:06:18,555 --> 01:06:19,544
Get back on the bus!

749
01:06:19,723 --> 01:06:21,281
Solomon! Solomon!

750
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:22,948
-Let's go.
-Solomon, come here!

751
01:06:23,127 --> 01:06:24,560
-Go, go, go.
-Come on, come on.

752
01:06:24,762 --> 01:06:27,424
-Get in the bus!
-Move, move, move! Come on, come on.

753
01:06:27,765 --> 01:06:29,596
-Move!
-Get in the bus. Let's go.

754
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:31,962
Get in, get in.
Goddamn it, get in! Get in!

755
01:06:32,136 --> 01:06:34,570
-Let me inside!
-There's no fucking space!

756
01:06:34,738 --> 01:06:37,002
-Let them on the bus.
-You give him your seat.

757
01:06:37,174 --> 01:06:40,143
What if we just take your place, huh?
What if we take your place?

758
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:43,245
That's enough. He can ride with me.
Oi, he can ride with me.

759
01:06:43,414 --> 01:06:45,974
Maddy! Let's go!
Maddy, let's go. Come on!

760
01:06:58,896 --> 01:07:02,024
Nothing like a little bang-bang
to get the heart started, Maddy.

761
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:06,097
-Whatever you say, Corbauld.
-Come on, love. Don't be like that.

762
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:09,728
Story's played out, hasn't it?
Government bad, rebels worse.

763
01:07:10,274 --> 01:07:12,708
No one gives a toss anymore.
Know what l mean?

764
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:50,413
This medicine will make you strong...

765
01:07:50,948 --> 01:07:53,348
...make you invisible to your enemies.

766
01:07:53,517 --> 01:07:55,747
Bullets will bounce off you.

767
01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:10,329
Superboy Killer, yes, huh?
Commando.

768
01:08:11,502 --> 01:08:13,436
Foreigners are the cause of the problems.

769
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:19,873
Poppy Sankoh say,
''Overthrow those who would exploit you.''

770
01:08:21,745 --> 01:08:23,235
l am Baby Killer.

771
01:08:27,017 --> 01:08:30,680
-l am the Master of Disaster.
-You will be strong.

772
01:08:34,024 --> 01:08:35,457
l am Born Trouble.

773
01:08:41,865 --> 01:08:43,924
l am See Me No More.

774
01:08:53,477 --> 01:08:56,412
You'd think they'd want
at least one decent road in this place.

775
01:08:57,848 --> 01:09:01,978
l'm gonna have to start charging
an entrance fee. Oh, God!

776
01:09:31,849 --> 01:09:33,077
Get down!

777
01:09:41,191 --> 01:09:43,421
-Look out!
-Shit!

778
01:09:55,939 --> 01:09:57,497
-You all right?
-Fine.

779
01:10:03,146 --> 01:10:04,443
Shit!

780
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:08,882
Hold on!

781
01:10:18,996 --> 01:10:20,395
Hold on!

782
01:10:31,675 --> 01:10:32,903
Come on.

783
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:42,612
-Everyone all right, huh?
-Yeah, l'm fine.

784
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:44,252
Let me see that. You okay?

785
01:10:44,421 --> 01:10:45,479
-Yeah.
-All right.

786
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:51,117
Quietly, now. Quietly.

787
01:11:12,282 --> 01:11:13,715
Come on.

788
01:11:34,935 --> 01:11:39,099
Kamajors. Local militia
protecting their homes, huh?

789
01:11:39,273 --> 01:11:41,138
-Do not look them in the eye.
-No.

790
01:11:41,709 --> 01:11:43,301
Who are you?

791
01:11:43,644 --> 01:11:46,169
We are friends.

792
01:11:48,148 --> 01:11:51,311
We are not R.U.F.!
We are not government!

793
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,350
We will kill all of you!

794
01:11:55,623 --> 01:11:57,113
Excuse me. Excuse me?

795
01:11:58,058 --> 01:12:01,425
Hi, l'm Maddy Bowen
with Vital Affairs magazine.

796
01:12:01,595 --> 01:12:04,655
Wonder if l could take your picture.
l'm just gonna get my camera.

797
01:12:04,832 --> 01:12:07,767
l've heard about your struggle.
l'd love to know more about it.

798
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:10,563
Would you mind if l took your picture?
Everyone together?

799
01:12:10,905 --> 01:12:12,668
Everyone could all come in together.

800
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:16,000
-Who is this woman?
-We are friends.

801
01:12:16,176 --> 01:12:18,201
ls that okay?
lf everyone could come closer.

802
01:12:19,246 --> 01:12:22,340
lf you come over here and come in
nice and close. That's good.

803
01:12:22,516 --> 01:12:25,974
Yeah. That's great.
And we'll get one with all of us.

804
01:12:26,253 --> 01:12:28,050
There you go. That's perfect.

805
01:12:28,222 --> 01:12:29,382
Reminds me of my wife.

806
01:12:29,857 --> 01:12:32,382
How about one together?
Us together, what do you think?

807
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,528
l'll come in like this, yeah?

808
01:12:35,329 --> 01:12:36,318
Cheese.

809
01:12:38,499 --> 01:12:40,831
So do you think
they've read your work?

810
01:12:41,001 --> 01:12:43,128
Shut up.

811
01:12:56,016 --> 01:12:58,348
Hey, get them, get them, get them.

812
01:12:59,987 --> 01:13:03,684
-l got a score. l got a score.
-You missed.

813
01:13:04,391 --> 01:13:06,552
Where have you come from?

814
01:13:07,127 --> 01:13:09,857
-Where did you come from?
-Where have you come from?

815
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:13,798
That's right. Yeah.
From New York. From America.

816
01:13:13,968 --> 01:13:15,868
l don't have anything for you.

817
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:19,539
Don't bother the people now.
Let them come in.

818
01:13:23,243 --> 01:13:25,768
Thank you, Ubani.

819
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:30,016
You can leave them here. l take
responsibility.

820
01:13:30,184 --> 01:13:32,812
Good. Now they are your problem.

821
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:37,987
My name is Benjamin Margai.

822
01:13:38,692 --> 01:13:40,751
Danny Archer. This is Maddy Bowen.

823
01:13:40,928 --> 01:13:43,988
-Hello. How are you?
-Very well, thank you.

824
01:13:44,164 --> 01:13:45,927
Welcome brother.

825
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,830
l am Solomon Vandy, from Shenge.

826
01:13:49,536 --> 01:13:51,629
What should l make of your companions?

827
01:13:53,307 --> 01:13:55,639
He-- She is... They are journalists.

828
01:13:55,976 --> 01:13:57,170
Ah. And l suppose you are, too.

829
01:13:58,812 --> 01:14:01,110
l'm the cameraman?

830
01:14:03,717 --> 01:14:06,652
The Belgians were the first
to chop off limbs in Africa.

831
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:11,189
King Leopold took one hand
for every hundredth slave in the Congo...

832
01:14:11,358 --> 01:14:13,451
...to keep them in line.

833
01:14:14,094 --> 01:14:17,029
Many of these children
were taken by the RUF.

834
01:14:17,197 --> 01:14:19,188
We have taken them back.

835
01:14:19,366 --> 01:14:22,460
Some of them have been
made to do horrible things.

836
01:14:22,636 --> 01:14:25,662
We are trying
to bring them back to life.

837
01:14:25,839 --> 01:14:27,466
Let me show you.

838
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:31,808
lmagine doing all this, huh?

839
01:14:33,113 --> 01:14:35,013
What's your excuse?

840
01:14:35,816 --> 01:14:41,152
Well, it's gotten hard to go back
to sipping lattes and talking interest rates.

841
01:14:41,388 --> 01:14:44,016
So you're an action junkie, huh?

842
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,256
Three out of five ex-boyfriends
recently polled...

843
01:14:47,428 --> 01:14:51,865
...say that l prefer to be
in a constant state of crisis.

844
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:54,663
Maybe l just give a shit.

845
01:14:58,338 --> 01:14:59,327
You were good today.

846
01:15:01,775 --> 01:15:03,106
You know that?

847
01:15:04,244 --> 01:15:05,734
You too.

848
01:15:08,682 --> 01:15:11,617
''--that sometimes they forgot
to close the door.

849
01:15:11,785 --> 01:15:14,845
She also wrote
about her sister Josie...

850
01:15:15,456 --> 01:15:20,450
...who was very ill
and who had to be taken to hospital.''

851
01:15:22,496 --> 01:15:23,690
Cheers.

852
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,094
So how many attacks
have there been in the area?

853
01:15:29,269 --> 01:15:32,170
l have known most of the rebels
since they were children.

854
01:15:32,339 --> 01:15:36,867
The local commander is still afraid
l will come after him with my ruler.

855
01:15:38,312 --> 01:15:41,770
So you think because your intentions
are good, they'll spare you, huh?

856
01:15:41,949 --> 01:15:44,782
My heart always told me
that people are inherently good.

857
01:15:44,952 --> 01:15:47,147
My experience suggests otherwise.

858
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:49,118
But what about you, Mr. Archer?

859
01:15:49,556 --> 01:15:51,990
ln your long career as a journalist...

860
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,992
...would you say that people
are mostly good?

861
01:15:57,064 --> 01:15:58,497
No.

862
01:15:58,766 --> 01:16:00,290
l'd say they're just people.

863
01:16:00,467 --> 01:16:04,403
Exactly. lt is what they do
that makes them good or bad.

864
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:07,802
A moment of love,
even in a bad man...

865
01:16:08,075 --> 01:16:10,543
...can give meaning to a life.

866
01:16:10,711 --> 01:16:14,340
None of us knows which path
will lead us to God.

867
01:16:17,084 --> 01:16:18,574
Hey!

868
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:08,432
lt's palm wine.

869
01:17:17,711 --> 01:17:20,646
-Jesus Christ.
-Yeah, yeah. lt takes getting used to, huh?

870
01:17:20,814 --> 01:17:22,304
God.

871
01:17:22,482 --> 01:17:25,212
-Drank that as a boy.
-ln Rhodesia?

872
01:17:27,387 --> 01:17:28,615
l take notes.

873
01:17:31,325 --> 01:17:33,054
The Shona....

874
01:17:34,361 --> 01:17:36,659
The Shona have a word for me.

875
01:17:38,498 --> 01:17:42,127
-lt means ''white boy in Africa.''
-When did you leave?

876
01:17:42,769 --> 01:17:44,464
l didn't leave.

877
01:17:44,638 --> 01:17:48,972
l got sent away to South Africa
in 1 978 when the munts overran us.

878
01:17:49,309 --> 01:17:50,776
Then you joined the army?

879
01:17:53,647 --> 01:17:55,808
Yeah. Yeah, l did my time in Angola.

880
01:17:55,983 --> 01:17:58,679
-The 32 Battalion.
-That's right.

881
01:18:01,054 --> 01:18:04,319
You know, contrary to what
you might think about us...

882
01:18:04,491 --> 01:18:07,983
...we fought with the blacks, huh?
Yeah. Side by side.

883
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:11,892
There was no apartheid in a foxhole.
The colonel always used to tell us that.

884
01:18:12,065 --> 01:18:15,466
-This is Colonel Coetzee?
-Yeah.

885
01:18:17,704 --> 01:18:21,105
Then, of course, it's 1 994.
No more army.

886
01:18:21,275 --> 01:18:23,106
No more apartheid.

887
01:18:23,277 --> 01:18:26,644
Truth and reconciliation
and all of that rubbish, you know.

888
01:18:26,813 --> 01:18:28,303
Kumbaya.

889
01:18:29,082 --> 01:18:31,846
We fought and died together,
you know?

890
01:18:32,019 --> 01:18:35,284
Black and white. Most people back home
didn't even know we were at war.

891
01:18:35,455 --> 01:18:37,320
We thought we were
fighting Communism...

892
01:18:37,491 --> 01:18:41,359
...but in the end, it was all about
who gets what, you know?

893
01:18:41,528 --> 01:18:44,588
lvory, oil, gold:

894
01:18:45,532 --> 01:18:47,295
Diamonds.

895
01:18:50,537 --> 01:18:53,506
So one day l decided,
''Fuck it,'' you know?

896
01:18:54,141 --> 01:18:55,699
''l'm gonna get mine.''

897
01:18:55,876 --> 01:18:57,468
You gonna steal his diamond?

898
01:19:04,985 --> 01:19:08,682
That diamond is my ticket
out of this godforsaken continent.

899
01:19:08,889 --> 01:19:10,720
That doesn't answer the question.

900
01:19:21,368 --> 01:19:25,464
My dad came home
from the war in '69.

901
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:29,606
And it took him...

902
01:19:30,744 --> 01:19:32,837
...about 20 years to get right.

903
01:19:34,715 --> 01:19:36,012
What?

904
01:19:38,885 --> 01:19:43,185
You Americans love to talk
about your feelings, huh?

905
01:19:43,357 --> 01:19:45,621
So, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

906
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:47,919
-Got a thing for messed-up vets now?
-Shut up.

907
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:51,397
You lost both your parents.

908
01:19:52,299 --> 01:19:55,132
That's a polite way
of putting it, yeah.

909
01:19:57,771 --> 01:20:00,103
Mom was raped and shot...

910
01:20:02,943 --> 01:20:06,037
...and Dad was decapitated
and hung from a hook in the barn.

911
01:20:07,581 --> 01:20:09,310
l was 9.

912
01:20:12,919 --> 01:20:14,511
Boohoo, right?

913
01:20:18,258 --> 01:20:20,385
Sometimes l wonder...

914
01:20:23,497 --> 01:20:26,557
...will God ever forgive us
for what we've done to each other?

915
01:20:30,203 --> 01:20:33,070
Then l look around and l realize...

916
01:20:33,974 --> 01:20:37,432
...God left this place a long time ago.

917
01:20:44,151 --> 01:20:46,176
lt's....

918
01:20:48,455 --> 01:20:50,389
What's the point, huh?

919
01:21:33,834 --> 01:21:35,859
Oh, shit. Keep moving, huh?

920
01:21:36,036 --> 01:21:37,799
-What?
-Drive at them. They'll panic.

921
01:21:37,971 --> 01:21:40,235
Do you know where the word
''infantry'' comes from?

922
01:21:40,407 --> 01:21:43,706
lt means ''child soldier.''
They are just children.

923
01:21:43,877 --> 01:21:47,540
-Stop! Stop! RUF on the road!
-Hi. Hello. Hello.

924
01:21:48,782 --> 01:21:49,840
Hello, little brothers.

925
01:21:50,016 --> 01:21:52,541
-RUF on the road!
-Yeah, yeah. What is your names?

926
01:21:53,053 --> 01:21:55,351
l'm Dead Body.
Who is this motherfucker?

927
01:21:55,522 --> 01:21:57,183
We are teachers on our way to Kono.

928
01:21:57,357 --> 01:21:59,587
Only RUF on the road.

929
01:21:59,759 --> 01:22:01,693
-RUF only!
-Yes, yes, l understand that.

930
01:22:01,895 --> 01:22:03,226
-Only RUF!
-But son, this is--

931
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:07,091
Don't move! Don't move! Fuck.

932
01:22:09,336 --> 01:22:12,669
Jesus Christ! Maddy, press your hand
against the exit wound there, huh?

933
01:22:12,839 --> 01:22:15,137
-Got it.
-Keep it there, huh?

934
01:22:15,308 --> 01:22:17,071
Whatever you do,
don't talk, all right?

935
01:22:17,244 --> 01:22:19,075
ls there any wine left in that jug?

936
01:22:19,246 --> 01:22:21,111
-Here.
-Pour it all over everything, huh?

937
01:22:22,649 --> 01:22:25,584
The colonel's gonna have a medic
at the airstrip in Kono.

938
01:22:25,752 --> 01:22:28,744
-How far is it?
-You said not to talk.

939
01:22:29,022 --> 01:22:30,216
A comedian, huh?

940
01:22:44,404 --> 01:22:46,804
-How's his pulse?
-l can feel it sometimes.

941
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:00,219
-Hold it right there.
-Stop.

942
01:23:00,387 --> 01:23:01,615
Papers, please.

943
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:07,020
Excuse me.

944
01:23:07,194 --> 01:23:10,129
l was just trying
to keep pressure on the wound.

945
01:23:10,297 --> 01:23:12,822
-He's lost a lot of blood.
-You'll be all right, huh?

946
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,797
Will you?

947
01:23:15,502 --> 01:23:18,494
l'll check on him in the tent
in a little bit. Thank you.

948
01:23:18,738 --> 01:23:20,069
Hey.

949
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:22,598
Look who's alive, eh?

950
01:23:22,776 --> 01:23:24,107
l told the H you'd be back.

951
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:29,014
l'm afraid we're evacuating
all non-military personnel, miss.

952
01:23:29,182 --> 01:23:31,013
Transport touches down at 1 600.

953
01:23:31,184 --> 01:23:32,947
She's with me, all right?

954
01:23:33,153 --> 01:23:36,816
No exceptions, pal. This is gonna be ugly.
Colonel doesn't want an audience.

955
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:39,788
ls l.R.'s presence here
known to other African nations?

956
01:23:41,294 --> 01:23:43,319
-She's with you?
-Yeah.

957
01:23:44,464 --> 01:23:46,329
Come on. The colonel's this way.

958
01:23:46,499 --> 01:23:48,330
Give me a minute, huh?

959
01:23:51,504 --> 01:23:54,029
We block their escape
by blowing the bridge.

960
01:23:55,675 --> 01:23:57,370
That's correct.

961
01:23:58,111 --> 01:24:00,409
You made it out. Well done.

962
01:24:00,614 --> 01:24:02,548
Negative, Kilo Foxtrot, stand by.

963
01:24:03,216 --> 01:24:06,879
-Colonel, sir.
-So must be real, then.

964
01:24:08,054 --> 01:24:09,248
The pink.

965
01:24:09,756 --> 01:24:12,350
Well, you're part
of this operation now.

966
01:24:12,525 --> 01:24:16,017
First we snuff everything that moves
out there, then we find your diamond.

967
01:24:16,196 --> 01:24:17,823
Colonel?

968
01:24:18,365 --> 01:24:20,799
Go get kitted. Yes?

969
01:24:27,107 --> 01:24:29,098
Move, move, move!

970
01:24:29,309 --> 01:24:32,574
-Go get your kit.
-Will do, chum. Will do.

971
01:24:36,116 --> 01:24:39,279
lt's go time, all right?
Meet me behind the tents.

972
01:24:42,389 --> 01:24:44,084
How's Benjamin?

973
01:24:44,257 --> 01:24:45,724
They say he'll live.

974
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:48,322
Good. Good.

975
01:24:55,735 --> 01:24:57,532
Listen, Maddy...

976
01:24:58,938 --> 01:25:00,701
...l need you to do me one last favor.

977
01:25:01,741 --> 01:25:03,106
Yeah?

978
01:25:05,078 --> 01:25:06,739
Tell that guard
you wanna put him...

979
01:25:06,913 --> 01:25:09,575
...on the cover of Soldier of Fortune
magazine for me.

980
01:25:15,622 --> 01:25:16,850
You're going in.

981
01:25:21,261 --> 01:25:23,525
You and Solomon.

982
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:26,688
You're going in now.

983
01:25:27,534 --> 01:25:29,729
Your plane leaves
in a few minutes, huh?

984
01:25:32,339 --> 01:25:34,307
You're an idiot.

985
01:25:38,611 --> 01:25:41,478
-What if l wanted to go in with you?
-l'd say no.

986
01:25:41,648 --> 01:25:43,639
-What if l insist?
-l'd insist back.

987
01:25:49,756 --> 01:25:50,950
lt's my story.

988
01:25:51,124 --> 01:25:54,525
Your story is Van De Kaap, all right?
That stone is mine.

989
01:25:54,694 --> 01:25:58,130
l'm not leaving here without it,
you understand?

990
01:25:59,599 --> 01:26:02,466
Please, just give me two minutes.

991
01:26:19,219 --> 01:26:20,618
Yeah.

992
01:26:31,931 --> 01:26:33,626
-Hello.
-Hi.

993
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,031
My name is Maddy Bowen.
l'm with Vital Affairs magazine.

994
01:26:37,203 --> 01:26:39,671
l was wondering
if l could ask you a few questions.

995
01:26:39,839 --> 01:26:41,363
Well, that depends what they are.

996
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:45,500
Oh, l see you're familiar
with our devious ways, aren't you?

997
01:26:46,246 --> 01:26:48,146
Okay, so l'll start
with something simple.

998
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,422
And before that you were with
the South African Defense--?

999
01:27:03,596 --> 01:27:05,257
-Defense Force, correct.
-Of course.

1000
01:27:05,432 --> 01:27:08,868
And was that with Colonel Coetzee?
Were you in Angola?

1001
01:27:09,035 --> 01:27:10,559
Angola, yeah.

1002
01:27:12,172 --> 01:27:15,141
That is all l really need to know.
Thank you so much.

1003
01:27:15,341 --> 01:27:16,808
-Thank you.
-Okay.

1004
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,219
Thank you, huh?

1005
01:27:28,388 --> 01:27:30,822
Just keeping my end of the deal.

1006
01:27:31,424 --> 01:27:32,721
Good luck to you, Solomon.

1007
01:27:33,026 --> 01:27:34,516
Okay.

1008
01:27:35,695 --> 01:27:39,529
-l hope you find what you're looking for.
-Thank you for all you have done.

1009
01:27:46,973 --> 01:27:49,567
-Listen, l--
-No, you listen.

1010
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:56,080
ln another life maybe, all right?

1011
01:27:57,517 --> 01:27:59,348
Yeah. Sure.

1012
01:27:59,519 --> 01:28:00,884
Yeah.

1013
01:28:05,225 --> 01:28:07,352
You find yourself a good man,
all right, Maddy?

1014
01:28:13,299 --> 01:28:16,325
You know, l've got three sisters.

1015
01:28:16,503 --> 01:28:19,131
They're all married to good men.

1016
01:28:21,007 --> 01:28:22,065
l prefer my life.

1017
01:28:24,711 --> 01:28:29,171
Here is my office phone...

1018
01:28:29,349 --> 01:28:31,715
...home phone, cell phone.

1019
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:36,983
l'm used to being pursued,
but what the heck.

1020
01:28:48,167 --> 01:28:50,294
You better get on that plane, huh?

1021
01:28:52,038 --> 01:28:53,938
You should get on that plane.

1022
01:29:02,115 --> 01:29:03,912
So should you.

1023
01:29:10,390 --> 01:29:11,516
You gonna call me?

1024
01:29:15,328 --> 01:29:16,818
Soon as l'm near a phone, yeah.

1025
01:29:17,764 --> 01:29:20,130
Yeah, right.

1026
01:29:41,955 --> 01:29:45,220
-Where is he?
-l don't know.

1027
01:29:49,796 --> 01:29:51,388
Oh, shit.

1028
01:29:51,664 --> 01:29:54,394
Nabil? Yeah, l'll call you
when we get closer, all right?

1029
01:29:54,567 --> 01:29:57,161
You keep me posted. Right.

1030
01:29:57,337 --> 01:30:01,137
All right. l set the pace, huh?
Two-hour marches, five-minute breaks.

1031
01:30:01,307 --> 01:30:05,141
lf l hold my hand up like this, you stop.
lf l point to the dirt, you lie flat.

1032
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:08,872
lf l say go, you move like your life
depended on it. Understood?

1033
01:30:09,048 --> 01:30:11,710
-Yes, boss.
-Come on.

1034
01:30:21,995 --> 01:30:23,656
Tell me about the stone.

1035
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:26,458
ls it clear or is it milky?

1036
01:30:26,633 --> 01:30:28,157
Clear.

1037
01:30:28,334 --> 01:30:30,734
And the color, is it strong?

1038
01:30:30,903 --> 01:30:32,131
Does it hold the light?

1039
01:30:32,305 --> 01:30:34,364
lt is as you say.

1040
01:30:34,807 --> 01:30:37,970
-About the size of a bird's egg?
-Yes.

1041
01:30:38,144 --> 01:30:42,308
One hundred carats.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

1042
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:25,255
Dia!

1043
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,128
Stop the truck!

1044
01:31:29,896 --> 01:31:31,591
l thought it was Dia.

1045
01:32:25,518 --> 01:32:27,076
Wake up.

1046
01:32:28,921 --> 01:32:32,015
Don't worry, they're gone, huh?

1047
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:36,487
You know, l once had this buddy...

1048
01:32:36,662 --> 01:32:38,527
...named Mabhoko.

1049
01:32:39,298 --> 01:32:42,529
We used to hunt bush meat
together as kids, huh?

1050
01:32:43,336 --> 01:32:44,701
Baboons.

1051
01:32:44,871 --> 01:32:47,738
Baboons, they were
the hardest to catch. They're....

1052
01:32:48,841 --> 01:32:50,172
They're cunning.

1053
01:32:50,343 --> 01:32:52,436
Cunning creatures.

1054
01:32:52,712 --> 01:32:55,340
Fast, strong.

1055
01:32:55,515 --> 01:32:57,745
Got good eyesight.

1056
01:32:58,251 --> 01:33:02,278
We would always find them
by the smell of their shit.

1057
01:33:02,455 --> 01:33:07,586
And that's how we learned to track
your black terrorists in Angola, huh?

1058
01:33:11,664 --> 01:33:13,097
By the smell of your shit.

1059
01:33:14,133 --> 01:33:15,600
lt's not....

1060
01:33:15,768 --> 01:33:18,498
lt's not the same as a baboon's.

1061
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:24,301
But, you know, after you skin it...

1062
01:33:25,611 --> 01:33:27,841
...the flesh of a baboon...

1063
01:33:28,114 --> 01:33:30,514
...isn't that much different
than a man's, you know.

1064
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,856
l'll tell you, l can track anything.

1065
01:33:50,102 --> 01:33:52,263
You risk my life like that again...

1066
01:33:57,643 --> 01:33:59,770
...and l'll peel your face
back off your head.

1067
01:34:02,281 --> 01:34:04,545
Do you understand?

1068
01:34:12,792 --> 01:34:14,851
Make us a fire.

1069
01:34:48,527 --> 01:34:51,985
Hello my brother. Are you lost?

1070
01:34:52,899 --> 01:34:54,730
We are headed for the mines in Kono.

1071
01:34:56,369 --> 01:35:00,430
You don't want to go that way. The
R.U.F. is in the next village.

1072
01:35:01,941 --> 01:35:03,408
Thank you, my brother.

1073
01:35:04,577 --> 01:35:07,341
And tell the poomui not to shoot me.

1074
01:35:09,615 --> 01:35:12,914
He is crazy for diamonds like everybody else.

1075
01:35:13,419 --> 01:35:15,284
Let's hope they don't discover oil here.

1076
01:35:17,623 --> 01:35:20,717
Then we'd have real problems.

1077
01:35:21,661 --> 01:35:22,685
Thank you, my brother.

1078
01:35:25,131 --> 01:35:26,723
What'd he say?

1079
01:35:26,899 --> 01:35:29,026
We are going the right way.

1080
01:35:36,175 --> 01:35:38,905
Hold up there, my man.
lt's this way, huh?

1081
01:35:40,379 --> 01:35:42,574
Where do you think you are going?

1082
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:45,911
Stop!

1083
01:35:46,185 --> 01:35:47,880
l said, stop!

1084
01:35:48,321 --> 01:35:49,879
He is not down there, all right?

1085
01:35:51,924 --> 01:35:55,587
All right. You're gonna need
some of that old discipline, huh?

1086
01:35:55,761 --> 01:35:58,025
Now you listen here, my boy,
and you listen well.

1087
01:35:58,197 --> 01:36:00,165
You are not going down there.
Are we clear?

1088
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:01,960
You are not the master.

1089
01:36:02,134 --> 01:36:05,763
Right now, that is exactly what l am,
and you'd better remember it, Kaffir!

1090
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,251
Don't you fucking move, huh?

1091
01:36:22,421 --> 01:36:24,389
Don't you move. Don't you move, huh?

1092
01:36:24,557 --> 01:36:26,889
-My son is there!
-Your son is gone!

1093
01:36:27,059 --> 01:36:28,390
-He is alive!
-He's gone!

1094
01:36:28,561 --> 01:36:31,121
He's alive! He's there
with those crazy people!

1095
01:36:32,331 --> 01:36:35,767
l am his father! His father!
l should have protected him!

1096
01:36:36,235 --> 01:36:40,137
l must go find him.
l cannot live without knowing!

1097
01:36:40,306 --> 01:36:42,536
Shoot me if you want, but l'm going.

1098
01:36:44,643 --> 01:36:48,101
Why should it matter,
l'm dead already.

1099
01:36:55,955 --> 01:36:58,219
We wait until dark, huh?

1100
01:37:27,386 --> 01:37:28,785
Are you satisfied?

1101
01:37:31,757 --> 01:37:34,282
All right, come on.

1102
01:37:39,031 --> 01:37:41,226
--is fighting for Sierra Leone

1103
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:44,460
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone

1104
01:37:44,637 --> 01:37:47,572
Go tell my parents
They may see me no more

1105
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:50,800
In the battlefield
We're fighting forever

1106
01:37:50,976 --> 01:37:53,877
Go tell my parents
They may see me no more

1107
01:37:54,046 --> 01:37:55,513
In the battlefield....

1108
01:37:58,084 --> 01:38:00,052
You are how old?

1109
01:38:00,219 --> 01:38:01,982
Me? l'm 31 .

1110
01:38:02,154 --> 01:38:04,315
And you have no wife?

1111
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:07,657
-No.
-No children?

1112
01:38:08,828 --> 01:38:10,125
No.

1113
01:38:10,296 --> 01:38:11,923
And no home?

1114
01:38:12,098 --> 01:38:13,759
No.

1115
01:38:14,467 --> 01:38:16,867
But you have money, yes?

1116
01:38:17,036 --> 01:38:19,300
Yeah, some.

1117
01:38:19,472 --> 01:38:21,463
But not enough?

1118
01:38:23,976 --> 01:38:25,534
No.

1119
01:38:26,278 --> 01:38:30,772
lf you get this diamond,
you will have enough money, yes?

1120
01:38:32,918 --> 01:38:33,942
Yes.

1121
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:36,918
Then you will get
a wife and children?

1122
01:38:37,089 --> 01:38:38,488
Probably not, no.

1123
01:38:40,559 --> 01:38:41,548
What?

1124
01:38:43,662 --> 01:38:45,186
What?

1125
01:38:45,598 --> 01:38:47,657
l am confused.

1126
01:38:48,734 --> 01:38:50,201
Yeah?

1127
01:38:50,369 --> 01:38:53,167
That makes two of us, my bru.

1128
01:38:55,674 --> 01:38:59,166
Oh, Christ.
l've gotta quit smoking, huh?

1129
01:38:59,778 --> 01:39:01,746
Why don't you?

1130
01:39:02,014 --> 01:39:04,414
l'll tell you what, Solomon.

1131
01:39:04,683 --> 01:39:09,211
You find me this diamond,
and l'll quit right then and there, huh?

1132
01:39:16,629 --> 01:39:19,621
-You were born in Zimbabwe?
-Oh, yeah.

1133
01:39:19,798 --> 01:39:22,961
-ls it beautiful there?
-Sure you're not a reporter?

1134
01:39:23,369 --> 01:39:26,827
Because you ask a hell of a lot
of questions, my man.

1135
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:38,177
My grandfather told
many stories of war.

1136
01:39:38,417 --> 01:39:41,250
How the Mende fought the Temne.

1137
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:45,151
Or how two tribes would fight
when somebody had stolen a woman.

1138
01:39:55,234 --> 01:39:58,601
l understand white people
want our diamonds, yes?

1139
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:05,371
But how can my own people
do this to each other?

1140
01:40:13,652 --> 01:40:15,711
l know good people...

1141
01:40:15,888 --> 01:40:18,755
...who say there is something
wrong with us...

1142
01:40:19,124 --> 01:40:20,284
...inside our black skin.

1143
01:40:20,459 --> 01:40:23,792
That we were better off
when the white man ruled.

1144
01:40:25,698 --> 01:40:28,496
But my son is good.

1145
01:40:30,069 --> 01:40:32,264
And when he grows up...

1146
01:40:32,438 --> 01:40:33,666
...and peace comes...

1147
01:40:37,676 --> 01:40:40,338
...this place will be a paradise.

1148
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:50,688
We'll get your son back, huh?

1149
01:41:32,398 --> 01:41:34,730
Where is it exactly?

1150
01:41:36,268 --> 01:41:39,169
Through the camp, by the river.

1151
01:41:43,776 --> 01:41:45,471
Christ.

1152
01:41:45,944 --> 01:41:47,571
Okay.

1153
01:41:48,213 --> 01:41:50,078
l'm gonna make contact
with the colonel.

1154
01:41:50,249 --> 01:41:51,773
He'll send in an air strike.

1155
01:41:52,217 --> 01:41:55,186
-What is that?
-A chopper, huh? An attack helicopter.

1156
01:41:55,354 --> 01:41:57,879
-We use it as a diversion.
-What if my son is there?

1157
01:41:58,057 --> 01:41:59,354
-He isn't.
-How do you know?

1158
01:41:59,525 --> 01:42:03,120
l said we do it my way now, all right?
Don't fuck with me.

1159
01:42:13,038 --> 01:42:15,438
Cordell, it's Danny.

1160
01:42:15,607 --> 01:42:17,939
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up and listen, all right?

1161
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:20,977
You tell the colonel l've found the stone.

1162
01:42:21,146 --> 01:42:24,115
No, l haven't got it in my hands,
but l'm OP-ing its location.

1163
01:42:24,283 --> 01:42:25,875
lt's a major rebel camp, my man.

1164
01:42:26,051 --> 01:42:28,417
You tell him to send in the dakadak.

1165
01:42:28,987 --> 01:42:31,854
Because l stole a GPS, that's how.

1166
01:42:32,024 --> 01:42:34,584
lf you shut up and listen,
l could give the coordinates.

1167
01:42:35,027 --> 01:42:38,053
Zero-nine-zero-five-four-two-four, north.

1168
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:42,792
Three-two-seven-two-nine
three-zero-five-zero, east.

1169
01:42:42,968 --> 01:42:45,232
l'll call back at midnight to confirm.

1170
01:42:48,006 --> 01:42:50,941
You can look all night,
my friend, right?

1171
01:42:51,110 --> 01:42:53,772
l promise you he is not there.

1172
01:42:59,017 --> 01:43:01,212
They're coming in the morning, all right?

1173
01:43:01,387 --> 01:43:03,821
No movement, my friend. You stay still.

1174
01:43:05,758 --> 01:43:08,192
When it gets dark,
then we move in closer.

1175
01:43:30,349 --> 01:43:33,341
Solomon. Shit.

1176
01:43:44,129 --> 01:43:45,528
l can do it.

1177
01:43:45,697 --> 01:43:46,789
-Help me.
-Help him.

1178
01:43:46,965 --> 01:43:49,024
Thank you, Papa.

1179
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:33,206
Hey, you smell.

1180
01:44:34,413 --> 01:44:35,880
That's fine.

1181
01:44:48,193 --> 01:44:50,161
-Ready? l'm winning.
-Okay, let's go.

1182
01:44:50,329 --> 01:44:51,990
Play, man.

1183
01:44:53,565 --> 01:44:56,466
-Play. Play the card.
-Play.

1184
01:45:23,262 --> 01:45:24,388
Dia.

1185
01:45:27,432 --> 01:45:29,127
Leave me alone.

1186
01:45:30,168 --> 01:45:33,399
-Dia. l'm your papa. Come with me.
-Hey.

1187
01:45:33,572 --> 01:45:35,301
-Dia.
-Get away from me.

1188
01:45:35,474 --> 01:45:37,271
-Dia. Dia!
-l do not know you. Traitor!

1189
01:45:37,643 --> 01:45:40,134
-Enemy! Enemy!
-What the hell are you doing?

1190
01:45:40,312 --> 01:45:41,540
-What are you doing?
-l don't know you!

1191
01:45:41,713 --> 01:45:43,010
-What's wrong?
-l hate you!

1192
01:45:43,181 --> 01:45:44,910
-Dia, come with me!
-l hate you!

1193
01:45:45,083 --> 01:45:46,607
Get away from me!

1194
01:45:49,087 --> 01:45:50,952
-Get him!
-Don't shoot!

1195
01:45:51,456 --> 01:45:53,686
-Don't shoot! Don't--! Don't shoot!
-l hate you!

1196
01:45:53,859 --> 01:45:55,759
-Fisherman! Traitor!
-Don't shoot!

1197
01:45:55,928 --> 01:45:58,158
Get away from me!

1198
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:07,431
l knew you would come back.

1199
01:46:07,906 --> 01:46:11,398
l have dug and dug and dug,
but l've found nothing.

1200
01:46:11,577 --> 01:46:13,477
Nothing.

1201
01:46:13,745 --> 01:46:15,235
Dig, dig, dig!

1202
01:46:15,414 --> 01:46:17,712
You will find it for me.

1203
01:46:18,684 --> 01:46:20,982
You will dig up
what you have come back for.

1204
01:46:21,153 --> 01:46:22,177
No.

1205
01:46:22,354 --> 01:46:24,788
Why should the diamond
go to the foreign devils?

1206
01:46:25,524 --> 01:46:28,789
We will use it
to make the country strong.

1207
01:46:29,261 --> 01:46:31,855
RUF is fighting for the people!

1208
01:46:34,199 --> 01:46:37,293
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

1209
01:46:40,138 --> 01:46:41,867
Pick it up.

1210
01:46:43,075 --> 01:46:46,044
Why? You are going to kill me anyway.

1211
01:46:46,211 --> 01:46:49,305
l do not need to kill you,
Solomon Vandy.

1212
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:54,345
lf you do not bring me the diamond...

1213
01:46:54,519 --> 01:46:56,749
...l will find the rest of your family.

1214
01:46:56,922 --> 01:46:59,356
Just as l have found your son.

1215
01:47:00,459 --> 01:47:03,826
l will rape your wife
in front of your eyes...

1216
01:47:04,630 --> 01:47:06,928
...slit her throat...

1217
01:47:07,532 --> 01:47:09,898
...and l will keep your daughters
for myself.

1218
01:47:15,307 --> 01:47:17,741
You think l am a devil...

1219
01:47:17,909 --> 01:47:20,241
...but only because l have lived in hell.

1220
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:24,542
l want to get out.

1221
01:47:25,150 --> 01:47:27,243
You will help me.

1222
01:47:30,088 --> 01:47:31,385
l don't remember.

1223
01:47:31,556 --> 01:47:34,525
Find it or your family will die!

1224
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:37,325
Now pick it up!

1225
01:47:52,878 --> 01:47:54,311
-Go!
-Bastards!

1226
01:47:54,479 --> 01:47:55,844
Shoot it!

1227
01:48:00,819 --> 01:48:01,808
Dia!

1228
01:48:13,899 --> 01:48:16,094
Come, boy. Come. This way. This way.

1229
01:48:16,968 --> 01:48:18,196
Dia!

1230
01:48:41,093 --> 01:48:42,685
Colonel, we think Archer's there.

1231
01:48:42,861 --> 01:48:45,694
l don't give a damn who's down there.
Kill them all.

1232
01:48:56,041 --> 01:48:57,303
Dia!

1233
01:49:12,057 --> 01:49:13,354
l'm coming!

1234
01:49:16,895 --> 01:49:18,556
-Dia!
-Bastard!

1235
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,085
No!

1236
01:50:03,175 --> 01:50:04,506
Dia!

1237
01:51:10,742 --> 01:51:13,677
-We found his digger, sir.
-Keep him close.

1238
01:51:15,647 --> 01:51:17,842
-Danny boy.
-Colonel.

1239
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:21,383
-Thanks for calling it in.
-Yeah, yeah. Always happy to help, huh?

1240
01:51:21,553 --> 01:51:24,886
So where is it? The stone?

1241
01:51:25,056 --> 01:51:26,990
We split, huh? Fifty-fifty, all right?

1242
01:51:27,158 --> 01:51:28,785
Look around you, Danny boy.

1243
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:31,929
You're not in a position
to be dictating terms.

1244
01:51:32,097 --> 01:51:34,190
Then you will never find it, sir.

1245
01:51:34,366 --> 01:51:35,993
That's correct.

1246
01:51:37,669 --> 01:51:40,297
-But he will.
-Come. Up.

1247
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:44,170
lntroduce me to your digger.

1248
01:51:45,744 --> 01:51:47,405
Solomon Vandy.

1249
01:51:47,579 --> 01:51:49,740
This is Colonel Coetzee.
He wants the diamond.

1250
01:51:49,915 --> 01:51:52,941
-No more than you.
-Fuck.

1251
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:55,109
You gonna show us where it's hidden?

1252
01:51:57,789 --> 01:51:59,484
Does he speak English?

1253
01:51:59,658 --> 01:52:02,684
He will only tell me, sir.
l promise you that.

1254
01:52:03,528 --> 01:52:06,588
-Let me talk to him, huh?
-Go on.

1255
01:52:13,338 --> 01:52:15,704
All right, my friend.

1256
01:52:15,874 --> 01:52:17,808
End of the line here, huh?

1257
01:52:17,976 --> 01:52:21,241
-You just tell him where it is, all right?
-l do not trust him.

1258
01:52:21,413 --> 01:52:24,849
l don't trust him either,
but we haven't got much of a choice here.

1259
01:52:26,551 --> 01:52:29,679
l promise you
he will shoot us both in the head.

1260
01:52:30,121 --> 01:52:32,885
Right, tell him, huh?
Tell him where it is, huh?

1261
01:52:33,058 --> 01:52:35,652
-Go on. Come on.
-l'm not feeling the love, Danny.

1262
01:52:36,861 --> 01:52:39,694
All right.
No more messing about, all right?

1263
01:52:39,864 --> 01:52:42,856
l said tell him where it is!
Tell him where it is! Now!

1264
01:52:43,034 --> 01:52:44,695
Tell him!

1265
01:52:45,870 --> 01:52:47,667
-No.
-Fucking--

1266
01:52:47,839 --> 01:52:50,535
Danny, there are other ways
to do this, okay?

1267
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:52,336
Yeah, yeah.

1268
01:53:00,518 --> 01:53:03,510
-lf he tells us, do we have a deal, sir?
-Seventy-thirty.

1269
01:53:03,688 --> 01:53:06,088
Sixty-forty. l've already lined up a buyer.

1270
01:53:06,257 --> 01:53:07,918
Agreed.

1271
01:53:13,098 --> 01:53:14,656
Come here.

1272
01:53:17,235 --> 01:53:20,671
This is his son. Vandy will do
whatever you want for his sake, all right?

1273
01:53:20,839 --> 01:53:25,606
Danny, you're a pisser, man. Well done.
Boys, we move out.

1274
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:30,678
What do you say, Mr. Vandy?

1275
01:53:31,149 --> 01:53:34,050
-You ready to take a walk?
-Come on.

1276
01:53:40,325 --> 01:53:41,917
Come on.

1277
01:53:54,873 --> 01:53:57,967
So who's the buyer?
l'm guessing London.

1278
01:53:58,176 --> 01:54:01,441
Well, they no longer accept
conflict diamonds, huh?

1279
01:54:01,613 --> 01:54:04,081
Wouldn't hurt to interest
some other parties.

1280
01:54:04,616 --> 01:54:07,608
-Start a bidding war.
-What, one war's not enough for you, huh?

1281
01:54:08,553 --> 01:54:10,248
l missed you, Danny.

1282
01:54:10,555 --> 01:54:14,719
See? lt is here.
He has tried to find it.

1283
01:54:14,893 --> 01:54:17,589
All right, Mr. Vandy.
Time for you to start digging.

1284
01:54:32,644 --> 01:54:34,908
Hey, boet, have you got a smoke?

1285
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:37,280
Smoking will kill you.

1286
01:54:38,049 --> 01:54:39,539
Sorry.

1287
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:44,520
lt's all right.

1288
01:54:44,689 --> 01:54:46,816
Time l quit smoking anyway,
huh, Solomon?

1289
01:55:01,339 --> 01:55:02,670
-lt's gone.
-What?

1290
01:55:02,841 --> 01:55:04,934
Someone has taken it.

1291
01:55:06,044 --> 01:55:09,810
This is where l buried it.
lt isn't here.

1292
01:55:10,281 --> 01:55:13,648
Well, then there's no reason
for any of you to stay alive. ls there?

1293
01:55:17,989 --> 01:55:19,650
Wait, wait, wait.

1294
01:55:19,824 --> 01:55:22,054
l know, l know. l know where it is.

1295
01:55:22,527 --> 01:55:24,518
-l know where it is.
-lt better be there.

1296
01:55:29,701 --> 01:55:30,690
Yes.

1297
01:55:30,869 --> 01:55:34,236
Oh, here, here.
lt is here.

1298
01:55:34,405 --> 01:55:36,066
-Yeah? Yeah, there it is.
-Yes.

1299
01:55:37,242 --> 01:55:38,641
Fuck!

1300
01:55:57,295 --> 01:55:59,229
TlA, huh, Danny?

1301
01:56:00,632 --> 01:56:02,224
TlA.

1302
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:12,598
Keep digging, huh?
They'll be here any second. Come on.

1303
01:56:14,812 --> 01:56:16,074
Keep digging.

1304
01:56:28,927 --> 01:56:31,657
-lt had better be there, huh?
-Yes, yes.

1305
01:56:34,699 --> 01:56:36,291
Have you got it?

1306
01:56:37,735 --> 01:56:41,000
-Have you got it, huh?
-Yes, got it. Oh, yes.

1307
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:43,702
Oh, yes.

1308
01:56:45,877 --> 01:56:47,469
Solomon.

1309
01:56:54,285 --> 01:56:57,254
Dia, what are you doing?

1310
01:56:57,755 --> 01:56:59,245
Dia.

1311
01:57:00,124 --> 01:57:01,421
Look at me.

1312
01:57:01,593 --> 01:57:03,493
What are you doing?

1313
01:57:06,030 --> 01:57:08,157
You are Dia Vandy.

1314
01:57:08,366 --> 01:57:09,663
Of the proud Mende tribe.

1315
01:57:15,607 --> 01:57:20,476
You are a good boy
who loves soccer and school.

1316
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:25,908
Your mother loves you so much.

1317
01:57:28,353 --> 01:57:31,151
She waits by the fire making plantains...

1318
01:57:31,322 --> 01:57:33,984
...and red palm oil stew
with your sister N'Yanda...

1319
01:57:36,261 --> 01:57:38,525
...and the new baby.

1320
01:57:47,438 --> 01:57:49,702
The cows wait for you.

1321
01:57:49,874 --> 01:57:55,676
And Babu, the wild dog
who minds no one but you.

1322
01:57:58,249 --> 01:58:01,582
l know they made you do bad things...

1323
01:58:01,753 --> 01:58:04,221
...but you are not a bad boy.

1324
01:58:07,425 --> 01:58:09,825
l am your father...

1325
01:58:11,529 --> 01:58:13,827
...who loves you.

1326
01:58:15,099 --> 01:58:18,865
And you will come home with me
and be my son again.

1327
01:58:44,295 --> 01:58:46,661
Solomon, we've got to move, huh?

1328
01:58:46,831 --> 01:58:48,389
We've got to--

1329
01:58:51,569 --> 01:58:54,265
Go, go! Move!

1330
01:58:57,041 --> 01:58:58,599
Move. Move.

1331
01:58:58,776 --> 01:59:00,073
Move, move, move!

1332
01:59:00,244 --> 01:59:03,270
Move! Move! Move!

1333
01:59:04,882 --> 01:59:06,110
How far?

1334
01:59:06,284 --> 01:59:08,343
There's an airstrip
at the top of that gorge.

1335
01:59:08,519 --> 01:59:10,612
A plane will meet us, huh?

1336
01:59:11,022 --> 01:59:13,388
Hey, stop. Stop.

1337
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:19,653
Give it to me.
Come on, give it to me, huh?

1338
01:59:27,171 --> 01:59:30,231
Keep moving. They'll be tracking us.

1339
01:59:36,547 --> 01:59:38,606
Nabil, where are you?

1340
01:59:39,684 --> 01:59:42,312
l'm nearly there.
Tell me what's happening.

1341
01:59:42,487 --> 01:59:45,945
We're about 1 0 K's out, huh?
We've got it, my friend.

1342
01:59:46,124 --> 01:59:48,024
-Who is we?
-The fisherman and his son.

1343
01:59:48,192 --> 01:59:49,784
Lose them.

1344
02:00:03,941 --> 02:00:06,034
lt's at the top of that ridge there, huh?

1345
02:00:06,210 --> 02:00:07,507
You must stop and rest.

1346
02:00:07,678 --> 02:00:10,511
What? And give up the damn stone?

1347
02:00:10,681 --> 02:00:12,740
Keep moving. Come on.

1348
02:00:47,385 --> 02:00:49,717
Come. Come, come.

1349
02:01:36,834 --> 02:01:39,132
l can't. Stop.

1350
02:01:39,303 --> 02:01:41,362
-Okay.
-Stop.

1351
02:02:09,834 --> 02:02:10,926
Come on.

1352
02:02:11,536 --> 02:02:14,130
No! God, no. Stop.

1353
02:02:15,239 --> 02:02:18,572
Christ. No more. No more.

1354
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:04,215
Take it, huh?

1355
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:09,821
-Mr. Archer--
-Take it, take it.

1356
02:03:16,901 --> 02:03:18,664
l thought you would steal it from me.

1357
02:03:20,504 --> 02:03:24,133
Yeah, yeah, it occurred to me, huh?

1358
02:03:35,086 --> 02:03:36,713
Listen...

1359
02:03:39,690 --> 02:03:42,090
...this is Maddy's card, huh?

1360
02:03:42,259 --> 02:03:44,420
You call her when
you get to Conakry, all right?

1361
02:03:48,666 --> 02:03:50,634
And don't trust that pilot for a second.

1362
02:03:50,801 --> 02:03:53,861
You point this at his head
if he fucks around, all right?

1363
02:03:54,038 --> 02:03:55,505
l can carry you.

1364
02:04:08,419 --> 02:04:09,886
You take your boy home, huh?

1365
02:04:15,059 --> 02:04:17,721
You take him home, huh?

1366
02:04:22,266 --> 02:04:24,029
-Go! Go!
-Go. Come on.

1367
02:04:24,869 --> 02:04:25,961
Go on!

1368
02:04:31,709 --> 02:04:33,574
Come on. Come on.

1369
02:04:40,384 --> 02:04:42,750
Archer, you're a dead man!

1370
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:44,751
Yeah, yeah.

1371
02:05:15,453 --> 02:05:16,818
Dia.

1372
02:05:38,042 --> 02:05:39,202
Hello. Maddy Bowen.

1373
02:05:39,443 --> 02:05:41,274
Yeah.

1374
02:05:41,612 --> 02:05:43,273
Thought l'd never call, huh?

1375
02:05:44,181 --> 02:05:48,242
And l'm so glad you did.
Excuse me.

1376
02:05:50,221 --> 02:05:51,381
When am l gonna see you?

1377
02:05:52,523 --> 02:05:58,257
Maddy, l want you to do me
one more favor, huh?

1378
02:05:58,963 --> 02:06:03,491
l want you to go meet Solomon
in Conakry.

1379
02:06:03,701 --> 02:06:06,397
ln Guinea?
Why do you want me to go to Guinea?

1380
02:06:09,406 --> 02:06:11,465
We found his son...

1381
02:06:12,443 --> 02:06:15,844
...but he's gonna need some help,
you understand?

1382
02:06:16,614 --> 02:06:17,706
Maddy?

1383
02:06:20,518 --> 02:06:22,383
You're hurt.

1384
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:24,078
Are you hurt?

1385
02:06:24,255 --> 02:06:27,418
Yeah, well, l've got
a little problem here.

1386
02:06:31,996 --> 02:06:35,693
Okay. You--
You tell me where you are.

1387
02:06:38,969 --> 02:06:39,993
Archer?

1388
02:06:52,149 --> 02:06:56,882
l'm looking at an incredible view
right now.

1389
02:06:58,289 --> 02:06:59,916
l wish you were here, Maddy.

1390
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:03,753
Okay, then l'm coming to be with you.
You just tell me where you are.

1391
02:07:06,964 --> 02:07:08,295
l don't think so.

1392
02:07:08,465 --> 02:07:11,798
Are you still in Kono? Because l can
get someone there to help you.

1393
02:07:11,969 --> 02:07:16,235
Maddy, you find someplace safe
for the boy, all right?

1394
02:07:16,407 --> 02:07:18,807
And keep him out of sight.

1395
02:07:19,410 --> 02:07:22,140
And get Solomon to London.

1396
02:07:25,282 --> 02:07:28,046
He's bringing something with him.

1397
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:30,653
But he's gonna need your help.

1398
02:07:31,889 --> 02:07:33,720
Why aren't you bringing it yourself?

1399
02:07:35,226 --> 02:07:40,289
l'm saying it's a real story now.

1400
02:07:41,198 --> 02:07:42,927
And you can write the hell out of it.

1401
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:52,665
l'm really happy l met you.

1402
02:07:54,245 --> 02:07:55,234
You know that?

1403
02:07:58,582 --> 02:08:00,709
Yeah, l'm....

1404
02:08:01,919 --> 02:08:04,979
l'm really happy l met you too.

1405
02:08:05,589 --> 02:08:09,582
And I wish I could be there with you.

1406
02:08:10,461 --> 02:08:12,429
That's all right.

1407
02:08:14,965 --> 02:08:17,365
l'm exactly where l'm supposed to be.

1408
02:09:10,988 --> 02:09:13,320
When we get to the stairs,
you just keep walking...

1409
02:09:13,490 --> 02:09:15,515
...and l'll wait for you here.

1410
02:09:16,093 --> 02:09:17,617
You're not coming.

1411
02:09:17,795 --> 02:09:21,060
l'm not here. Good luck.

1412
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:45,382
You must understand, Mr. Vandy...

1413
02:09:45,556 --> 02:09:51,620
...that your diamond could have ended up
nowhere else but with us.

1414
02:09:54,932 --> 02:09:57,901
-lt is not enough.
-l assure you, 2 million pounds...

1415
02:09:58,068 --> 02:10:01,936
...is more than anyone else will offer you
for that stone under the circumstances.

1416
02:10:02,106 --> 02:10:04,802
l want what was promised to me
by Mr. Archer.

1417
02:10:08,278 --> 02:10:10,803
-What was promised to you?
-My family.

1418
02:10:11,148 --> 02:10:13,139
When they are here,
you will get the stone.

1419
02:10:13,817 --> 02:10:15,444
l will have the money too.

1420
02:10:16,754 --> 02:10:18,278
Well, may l see what l'm buying?

1421
02:10:18,455 --> 02:10:21,219
You will get the stone
once my family is here.

1422
02:10:21,992 --> 02:10:23,789
How do l even know you've got it?

1423
02:12:31,688 --> 02:12:34,452
Can you comment on the diamonds
mined in Sierra Leone?

1424
02:12:34,625 --> 02:12:38,527
l'm not going to comment
on some sensationalist magazine article.

1425
02:12:38,695 --> 02:12:41,289
-What about Liberia?
-No comment. No comment.

1426
02:12:41,465 --> 02:12:43,865
-Mr. Van De Kaap--
-That's all l have to say.

1427
02:12:44,034 --> 02:12:45,433
The natural resources
of a country...

1428
02:12:45,602 --> 02:12:47,263
Kimberley, South Africa
January, 2000

1429
02:12:47,437 --> 02:12:50,406
...are the property of its people.
They are not ours to steal...

1430
02:12:51,742 --> 02:12:57,203
...or exploit in the name of our comfort,
our corporations, or our consumerism.

1431
02:13:07,124 --> 02:13:09,183
They're ready for you, sir.

1432
02:13:10,694 --> 02:13:13,094
The Third World is not a world apart.

1433
02:13:13,263 --> 02:13:17,927
And the witness you will hear today
speaks on its behalf.

1434
02:13:18,101 --> 02:13:21,969
Let us hear the voice of that world.
Let us learn from that voice.

1435
02:13:22,139 --> 02:13:25,666
And let us ignore it no more.

1436
02:13:25,842 --> 02:13:29,175
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Solomon Vandy.

1437
