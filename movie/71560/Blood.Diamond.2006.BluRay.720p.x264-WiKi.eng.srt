1
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:09,999
Dia.

2
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,474
English boys don't go
to school every day.

3
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,227
Teacher say this country
was founded as a utopia.

4
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,964
Do you know
what that word means, Papa?

5
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,506
Well, she says someday
when the war is over...

6
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,076
...our world will be a paradise.

7
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,611
And all this you learn in one day?

8
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,908
And math and science.

9
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:08,152
This is too much learning. Tomorrow,
you will stay home and mend the nets, yes?

10
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,447
No, Papa.

11
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,920
What? So now you want
to go to school every day?

12
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,848
- Stay.
- Papa.

13
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,426
- Stay!
- Papa!

14
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,090
Jassie!

15
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,123
Solomon.

16
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,814
Come, come, come.

17
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,919
Pick it up. Quick.

18
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,351
- Papa! Papa!
- Jassie.

19
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,427
- Dia, run!
- Papa!

20
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,593
- Papa! Papa!
- Dia, run!

21
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,863
Papa!

22
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,090
Bring forward the next one. Bastard.

23
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,918
Bring forward the next one.

24
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,026
- Long sleeve or short sleeve?
- No.

25
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,026
Young man. You must understand.

26
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,862
The government wants you to vote, okay?

27
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:40,699
They gonna tell you say,
"The future is in your hands."

28
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,104
We now the future.

29
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,868
So we take your hands.

30
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,478
- No.
- No more hands, no more voting.

31
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,978
Chop him.

32
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:58,590
Spread the word.
The Revolutionary United Front is coming.

33
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,426
- RUF!
- RUF! RUF!

34
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:09,929
Bring forward the next one.
Bring him forward. Bring him forward.

35
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,732
Long sleeve or short sleeve?

36
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,641
- Short sleeve!
- Chop him.

37
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,170
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

38
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,006
Not this one. Look at him.

39
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,508
- Put him in the truck.
- Let's go.

40
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,085
Bring him to the mines.

41
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,415
He can work. He can work.
Move, move, move.

42
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,353
Next one, next one, next one.

43
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,524
Throughout the history of Africa...

44
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,229
...whenever a substance
of value is found...

45
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,937
...the locals die
in great number and in misery.

46
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:52,809
Now, this was true of ivory,
rubber, gold and oil.

47
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,378
It is now true of diamonds.

48
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,010
According to a devastating report
by Global Witness...

49
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:05,021
...these stones are being used
to purchase arms and finance civil war.

50
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,989
We must act to prohibit...

51
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,495
...the direct or indirect import
of all rough diamonds from conflict zones.

52
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,127
May I remind you...

53
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:25,243
...that the U.S. Is responsible for two-thirds
of all diamond purchases worldwide...

54
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:29,006
...and I don't anticipate
that demand diminishing.

55
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,413
We must remember
that these stones...

56
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:36,544
...comprise only a small percentage
of the legitimate diamond industry...

57
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:41,592
...whose trade is crucial to the economies
of many emerging nations.

58
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,026
The Freetown government
and their white masters...

59
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,826
...have raped your land
to feed their greed.

60
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,094
RUF have freed you.

61
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,603
- No more slave and master here.
- It's true.

62
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:58,870
Current estimates are that conflict stones
account for only 15 percent of the market.

63
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,445
But in a multi-billion-dollar-a-year
industry...

64
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,674
...that means hundreds of millions
of dollars are available...

65
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,751
...for weapons in these conflict zones.

66
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,387
RUF is fighting for the people!

67
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,319
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

68
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:17,361
Any bastard think he would joke
with me diamond, I go cut he throat.

69
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,691
Stop!

70
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:26,133
And we are joined today
by members of that diamond industry...

71
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,938
...who wholeheartedly
endorse your proposal.

72
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,772
I hope you join me
in applauding their presence here.

73
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,211
Mr. Van De Kaap and Mr. Simmons.

74
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,820
Give it to me.

75
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,659
Don't worry. We'll be fine, huh?

76
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:29,200
Listen. You take off
as soon as I'm out the door.

77
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,803
You don't land
until I raise you on the sat phone.

78
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,634
You be careful, Danny.

79
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:39,335
Don't worry. They want these guns
too much to do anything stupid.

80
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,217
Where is Commander Zero?

81
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,558
I am Captain Rambo.

82
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,965
Right. Right, I've seen your films, huh?

83
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,607
I'm looking for Commander Zero, huh?

84
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,607
He's inside. You talk to me.

85
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,747
You are here to help us
in our struggle against the government.

86
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,474
I'm here to do business
with Commander Zero, all right?

87
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,299
All right.

88
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,700
You are the man, huh?
You are the man.

89
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,037
Here, huh?

90
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,057
Hey. I'm talking to you! Stop!

91
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,284
- Commander Zero.
- Hey.

92
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,123
- I go kill you, eh?
- It's fine, huh? It's fine.

93
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,926
Commander Zero. Commander Zero.

94
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,126
Mr. Archer, come here.

95
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,906
You get something for me?

96
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,673
And yourself get something for me, huh?

97
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,147
Are you craze?
You get for pay me first for them.

98
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,095
This no fine, huh?

99
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,638
This no fine.

100
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,114
...and their new weapons, huh?

101
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,581
Maybe I could kill you
and take what you bring.

102
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,652
Then you get one more dead body...

103
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,483
...instead of airplane
way full with grenade launchers.

104
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,653
So I'm think I'm gonna go
to them government.

105
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,261
Them government,
at least them go pay me, huh?

106
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,296
Wait, wait. Wait, my friend.

107
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,634
This is the thing you want? Here.

108
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,966
So many I not know
what to do with them all.

109
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,635
Hey, Archer, next time,
you bring satellite TV, eh?

110
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,575
- I wanna see Baywatch.
- Yeah.

111
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,215
Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,663
Hello, hello, hello.

113
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,805
Papers, please.

114
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,202
Danny Archer, National Geographic.

115
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,914
You crossing into Liberia.

116
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,714
I've got a letter from the minister of interior
and a Liberian visa as well.

117
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,357
I'm doing a story on the Marrakaz,
who, as you know...

118
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,858
...are allowed to cross the border
in order to get into grazing grounds.

119
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,354
You ever read National Geographic, huh?

120
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,069
- You're under arrest for smuggling.
- No, no, no.

121
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,937
Listen here, my friend.
Listen here, all right?

122
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,579
I am good friends
with Colonel Coetzee.

123
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:12,049
Colonel Coetzee would not be pleased
that you've interfered with his business.

124
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,947
Now, you know who I am, all right?

125
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,987
You don't wanna make trouble for me
or my friends, all right?

126
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,853
Now, look, why don't I just
look the other way, all right?

127
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,656
You take one or two of those stones
and get something lacquer for the wife...

128
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,664
...or maybe the mistress, all right?
We'll solve the problem right here, huh?

129
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,098
We'll go back to Freetown
and ask Colonel Coetzee...

130
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,263
...how he wishes
to thank his business associate.

131
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,102
Guys, take him away.

132
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,987
Hey! What the fuck?
What's going on there?

133
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,023
Come on! Fix that shit now!

134
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,459
Wasting my time here!
What in the shit is that?

135
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,291
Fuck that stuff! Fix that shit!
Damn, now need to work.

136
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,402
- Can't work. What's going on there?
- Boss.

137
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,437
- Fix that thing.
- I wanna go toilet. I must go now, now.

138
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,905
- I can't hold it in, boss.
- Go, go.

139
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,211
Get to work. Go to work, go to work.

140
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,474
Fuckheads wasting my time now.
How am I work in this shit?

141
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,255
Stop!

142
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,259
Spread your fingers.

143
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,827
Open.

144
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,008
Make it quick.

145
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,611
Give it to me.

146
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,912
Give it to me.

147
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,590
The government troops are coming!

148
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,129
Go, go, go...!

149
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,561
No, no, no!

150
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,427
No! I'm not a rebel!

151
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,806
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!

152
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,911
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!

153
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,209
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!

154
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,650
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!

155
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,319
RUF! RUF! RUF!

156
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,295
RUF! RUF! RUF!

157
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,866
RUF! RUF! RUF!

158
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,504
RUF! RUF! RUF!

159
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,776
Hey.

160
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,347
What did you do with it?

161
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,642
I'm talking to you, you hear me?

162
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,246
Where the diamond? The pink one.

163
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,186
- I saw you take it.
- You're mad. I do not know you.

164
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:23,294
Liar! I saw it with my own eyes.

165
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,099
This big. Biggest I have ever seen.

166
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,867
My brothers, I go give $ 1000...

167
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,496
...to the man who cuts the diamond
out of this bastard.

168
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,133
You the craze! You the craze!

169
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,939
Where is the diamond?

170
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:45,311
Where is the diamond?
Do you see a diamond?

171
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:51,254
You devils have taken my family!
My home! I done lost everything!

172
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,585
Here, look. What is left?

173
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,661
What is left?

174
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,492
If there is a diamond,
you are the one who has taken it!

175
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,634
Liar! The man is a liar!

176
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:07,068
I know your name, Solomon Vandy!
You have a name!

177
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:11,335
You have a family!
And I'll catch them!

178
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,307
And I'll find them!

179
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,291
Please tell me you brought me
cigarettes, bru, please.

180
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,898
I just have to tell you, Danny.

181
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,093
The colonel's not going to be happy
about you losing the diamonds.

182
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,137
Forget the colonel.
There's a fisherman in there, all right?

183
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,934
He might've found a pink. Big one.

184
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,236
What about the colonel?
He'll want that stone.

185
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,880
Screw the colonel.
I'll contact our friends in London.

186
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:52,882
If this stone is as big as I think,
we're gonna need a real buyer, all right?

187
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,150
What? What?

188
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,017
London wants nothing more
to do with you.

189
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,722
"Arrest in Sierra Leone of Daniel Archer,
former mercenary and smuggler..."

190
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,524
"Retains close ties
to Van De Kaap diamond can'tel.

191
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,826
Sources say they deny
any affiliation whatso..."

192
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,095
Fucking hell.

193
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,665
Listen, his name
is Solomon Vandy, all right?

194
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:19,504
Van De Kaap is gonna want that stone,
whatever they say. You just get him out.

195
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,270
Get him out.

196
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:29,185
Yeah, can you tell Mr. Simmons
that Danny Archer called. Right.

197
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,352
Archer. A-R-C-H-E-R.

198
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,177
Afternoon, darling, huh?

199
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:03,253
Big white man all alone.
That is no fine.

200
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:07,882
- I'm safe, huh? No HIV.
- Yeah, yeah. I've heard that one before.

201
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,325
Archer, I know where to get
nice baby diamond just for you.

202
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,397
- Not now, next time.
- Come on, Archer.

203
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,863
I said not now, next time. Bugger off.

204
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,886
Solomon Vandy?

205
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,754
What do you want?

206
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,792
It seems you made a friend in prison.

207
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,116
- Hey.
- How the body, Mr. Archer?

208
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,085
The body fine, M'Ed.

209
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,058
So you want something nice, huh?

210
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,428
The best you can get ahold of, all right?

211
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:59,128
Take me a few days,
but I go find you something special.

212
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,137
All right. You hear
they took Marampa yesterday?

213
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,809
- Really?
- Now, come on.

214
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:07,639
You know every move they make.
When are they gonna hit us?

215
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:12,250
Oh, I imagine they come
do some shopping very soon.

216
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,648
Yeah, yeah.
Got any smokes back there?

217
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,379
Yeah.

218
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,294
Who's that, huh?

219
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,126
All right.

220
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,338
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks.

221
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,172
You listening to this?

222
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,816
I am profoundly sorry.

223
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,545
The world is falling apart,
and all we hear about is Blowjobgate.

224
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:51,617
I believe he's sorry.

225
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,191
When was the last time the world
wasrt falling apart, huh?

226
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:01,130
A cynic. Why don't you sit down
and make me miserable?

227
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,830
- Danny Archer.
- Maddy Bowen.

228
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,801
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

229
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,607
- American, huh?
- Guilty.

230
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,040
Well, Americans usually are.

231
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,912
Says the white South African?

232
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,939
I'm from Rhodesia.

233
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,277
We say Zimbabwe now,
don't we?

234
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,720
- Do we?
- Last time I checked.

235
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,053
Don't tell me,
you're here to make a difference.

236
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:32,458
- And you're here to make a buck?
- I'm here for lack of a better idea.

237
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,095
- That's a shame.
- Not really.

238
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,531
Peace Corps types only
stay around long enough...

239
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,603
...to realize they're not helping anyone.

240
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,636
Government only wants
to stay in power...

241
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,708
...until they've stolen enough
to go into exile somewhere else.

242
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,504
And the rebels, they're not sure
they want to take over.

243
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,011
Otherwise,
they'd have to govern this mess.

244
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,480
- But TIA, right, M'Ed?
- TIA.

245
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,879
What's TIA?

246
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:58,421
- "This is Africa," huh?
- Right.

247
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,458
- You want another?
- Sure.

248
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,788
So which one are you?

249
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:12,532
- Smuggler?
- Am I?

250
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,639
Somehow you don't strike me
as the UNICEF type.

251
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,643
How about soldier of fortune?

252
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:21,671
Or is that too much of a cliche?

253
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,178
Diamonds?

254
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,477
- Lf I told you I was a missionary...
- For Van De Kaap?

255
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,781
Better watch that type of talk,
Miss Bowen.

256
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,051
In America, it's bling-bling,
but out here, it's bling-bang, huh?

257
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,455
I wouldn't want you
getting in any trouble.

258
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,995
How much trouble
do you think I would get into...

259
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,432
...for talking about blood diamonds?

260
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,300
- You're a journalist.
- That's right.

261
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:56,839
Piss off, huh?

262
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:04,451
For five years, this country has reported
almost no diamond exports...

263
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:08,286
...while Liberia, right next door,
has exported 2 billion dollars' won'th.

264
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,486
Very odd, considering that Liberia
has no diamonds to speak of.

265
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:12,652
I'm shocked.

266
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:16,164
Van De Kaap denies trading blood
diamonds, but admits it's impossible...

267
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:20,668
...to tell where a diamond comes from
unless their smuggler gets caught.

268
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,534
What do you want from me, huh?

269
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:27,235
You know all about Van De Kaap.
Help me out. Off the record.

270
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,939
Well, off the record, I like to get kissed
before I get fucked, huh?

271
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,713
Shit.

272
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,546
- Cordell. How is it, Shona?
- Long time, pal.

273
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:16,091
- How's Alice?
- She's well, thanks.

274
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,092
Tim must be in school, right?

275
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,595
- Big kids, big problems, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

276
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,359
I heard you got into a spot of trouble
in the bush, huh?

277
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,935
Well, you know the bush, right, bru?

278
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,265
- Company doing well?
- Can't complain.

279
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,069
Eleven wars in the continent.
We're keeping busy.

280
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,678
So, what, you're here on holiday, huh?

281
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,281
- How's the colonel?
- He sends his regards.

282
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,147
Good, good. Score us a loose, huh?

283
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,450
Smoking will kill you, bru.

284
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,952
Only if I live, right?

285
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,197
That's for breaking my TV, bru.

286
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,597
Tell the colonel he'll get his money.
I'll come see him soon.

287
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,575
Ten more.

288
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,650
Come. Come.

289
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,248
Go on.

290
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,376
Dia. Dia. Come here.
Get away from there.

291
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,640
Go. Go, Mama.

292
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,748
Stay down.

293
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,528
Excuse me,
my name's Solomon Vandy...

294
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,796
- Check the list.
- I have checked the list.

295
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:11,432
- File papers at the Office for Refugees.
- Sir, I have filed papers with the office.

296
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,601
Then God help you,
because I can't.

297
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:14,836
- Please, sir...
- Next.

298
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,140
- Sir... Sir, no, please.
- Hey, hey. Me, me, me.

299
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:21,081
Husband here. One year we look.

300
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,751
Hurry, Mom. Go.

301
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,296
Dia! Dia!

302
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,455
- Jassie!
- Dia!

303
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,226
- Mama!
- Dia!

304
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,563
Jassie! Mama!

305
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,659
He's been waiting.
What took you?

306
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,730
What are you gonna do,
shoot me right here, huh, Shona?

307
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,994
Now, don't be a wanker, man. Get in.

308
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,469
- Hello, Danny.
- Colonel.

309
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,435
You look well.

310
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,769
Clean living and a pure heart,
I suppose, huh?

311
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,805
Walk with me.

312
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,413
It seems the rebels have taken back
the diamond fields, Danny.

313
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,915
The government
of Sierra Leone has contracted us...

314
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,054
...to go in there
and take the rebels down.

315
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,813
So you sell the rebels weapons...

316
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,651
...the government hires you
when they use them? Nice, sir.

317
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,993
I assume you're asking
for mining concessions, huh?

318
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:14,290
We save the government,
they show their gratitude.

319
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,764
And you get rich, right?

320
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,630
How long have I known you, Danny?

321
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,237
I was... I was 19, sir.

322
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:31,006
And you survived.
A lot of boys didn't. Why is that?

323
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,079
Just lucky, I guess.

324
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:41,857
No, you were a good soldier.
But I made you better, didn't I?

325
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,663
Yes, sir. Yes, you did.

326
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,857
And over the years,
didn't I protect you...

327
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:54,227
...teach you about diamonds,
cut you in on the deals?

328
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:58,068
- Some might call it that, yeah.
- But not you...

329
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:02,706
...because you done with me now, eh?
On to bigger things.

330
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,318
I need a man that knows
his way around up there.

331
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,252
Unless, of course,
you wanna cut me in. Something pink?

332
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,848
Sir...

333
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,153
Our deal went bad,
and you owe me money.

334
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,057
I'll take a stone as payment.

335
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,098
Look, do you think if I found a stone
like that, I'd still be on this continent?

336
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:27,102
- Come on.
- Danny, give me your hand.

337
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,839
That's red earth. It's in our skin.

338
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,712
The Shona say the color
comes from all the blood...

339
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,441
...that's being spilled
fighting over the land.

340
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:46,048
This is home.
You'll never leave Africa.

341
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:51,489
If you say so, sir.

342
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:10,640
So, what did you do, bury it?

343
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,411
Yeah. Yeah, I would have
buried it, huh?

344
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:19,614
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about? Come on, bru.

345
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,224
I'm late for work.

346
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,917
Pink, huh? The biggest one
he'd ever seen.

347
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,222
You were in the mining camps,
werert you, bru?

348
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,889
Why else would that rebel with
the bandaged arm make up such a story?

349
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,298
Go ask him.

350
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,846
Thank you.

351
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,293
Your mothers and fathers,
your brothers and sisters are dead.

352
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,330
- You are dead! You have been reborn.
- No!

353
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,731
- We are your family now.
- No! No!

354
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,943
Your parents are weak.

355
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:20,951
They're the farmers.
They're the fishermen.

356
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,013
They've done nothing
but suck the blood from this country.

357
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:30,851
But you are the heroes
who will save this nation.

358
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,097
You are not children anymore.

359
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,032
You're men.

360
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,399
No one has ever given you respect...

361
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,666
...but with this in your hand,
they go fear you.

362
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,333
If you do not get
the respect you deserve...

363
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,810
...you will take it
by shedding their blood.

364
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,940
- Repeat after me, shed their blood.
- Shed their blood.

365
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:57,178
- Louder! Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Shed their blood!

366
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,483
Make them hear you in Freetown.
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

367
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,218
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

368
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:06,295
- Dia Vandy, stand up.
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

369
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,365
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Put your hand on the gun.

370
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,126
Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

371
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,894
Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

372
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:16,097
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Now squeeze the trigger.

373
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:21,044
Come on, Dia. Pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger!

374
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:59,741
I know, I know.
It's hard to be a man.

375
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:03,010
Sit up. Come.

376
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:07,487
But you are a soldier
of the revolution now.

377
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,559
And I am your commander.

378
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,927
Whatever you need...

379
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:16,328
...guns, CDs, food...

380
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,164
...come to me.
I will take care of you.

381
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:29,879
Today, you are promoted
to the rank of captain.

382
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,476
Dia Vandy...

383
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,920
...boss man.

384
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,302
How's it, bru?

385
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:03,007
- You got something for me, huh?
- Yeah.

386
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,182
- So, what's new, M'Ed?
- Fucking RUF.

387
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,876
Tried to hit the government building
across the street.

388
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:14,718
Shit, man, half the people
be soldiers today, RUF tomorrow.

389
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:18,293
- Might be time to get your family out, huh?
- And go where?

390
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:22,194
Just fire up the chopper
and fly away like you people?

391
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,398
This my country, man.

392
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:28,027
We here long before you came,
long after you gone.

393
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,211
- Hi. I'm Maddy Bowen.
- How about you dance with me?

394
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,751
- No, I don't dance.
- Neither do I. Come on.

395
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,360
- So, Danny...
- Archer.

396
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,720
Archer.

397
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:57,292
When did you first start
moving stones? Was it Angola?

398
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,666
Then you did the whole
mercenary thing. Was that fun?

399
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,872
So, what are you?
Nihilist? Opportunist?

400
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,207
Maybe I wasrt breast-fed
as a child, huh?

401
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,785
You think I haven't met
people like you before?

402
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:19,320
- I think you get off on people like me.
- You think?

403
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,584
When did you first start
working for Van De Kaap?

404
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:26,790
Christ, you never stop, do you?

405
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,432
No, I never stop.

406
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,728
Do you want me to stop?

407
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:39,008
Why don't we go back to your place,
see what's in the minibar, huh?

408
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,270
I'm a print journalist. I drank it.

409
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,277
Is it possible that you don't care
how many people die...

410
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,349
...because of the deals you do?

411
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,749
People here kill each other as a way of life.
Always been like that.

412
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,855
So you can just watch it
and go about your day?

413
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,252
Maybe we should all just
write about it, then.

414
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,760
Look, thanks for the dance, huh?

415
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:05,333
- And a shot too, huh, M'Ed?
- Sure.

416
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,470
You're a hard case, huh?

417
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,633
Tell me something,
how long you been here in Africa, huh?

418
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:17,143
Three months. And before that,
Afghanistan and Bosnia.

419
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,541
You come here
with your laptop computer...

420
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:23,653
...and your malaria medicine
and your little bottles of hand sanitizer.

421
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,448
Think you're gonna change
the outcome, huh?

422
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,219
Let me tell you something.
You sell blood diamonds too.

423
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,884
- Really?
- Yeah.

424
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,052
Tell me, how is that?

425
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:35,495
Who do you think buys
the stones that I bring out?

426
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:39,295
Dreamy American girls who all want
a storybook wedding and a big, shiny rock...

427
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,031
...like the ones in the advertisements
of your politically-correct magazines.

428
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,199
So, please, don't come here
and make judgments on me, all right?

429
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:51,912
I provide a service. The world wants what
we have, and they want it cheap.

430
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,314
We're in business together.
Get over yourself, darling.

431
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:59,882
Okay, just to clarify, not all American girls
want a storybook wedding...

432
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,958
...just like not all Africans kill each other
as a way of life.

433
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,527
And yeah, it's a shit, shit world,
but you know what?

434
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:09,564
Good things are done every day,
just, apparently, not by you.

435
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,194
This place is about to explode.

436
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,497
I wanna spend my time
with someone else.

437
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,611
You are listening to BBC World Service.

438
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,519
In Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United Front
forces have been sighted...

439
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,422
...within 10 kilometers
of the capital city of Freetown.

440
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,257
The minister of the interior
has expressed confidence...

441
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,797
...that the government troops
can repel the attack.

442
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:46,232
All foreign nationals are being advised
to leave the country.

443
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:48,565
There are also unconfirmed reports...

444
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:52,800
...that atrocities are being committed by
both sides in the rapidly worsening situation.

445
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,913
The United Nations has described
the refugee situation as critical.

446
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,892
Don't tell me you're gonna try
and sell it yourself.

447
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:13,587
To who?
And for what price, my friend?

448
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,789
You need my help,
whether you like it or not.

449
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:19,026
- What are you talking about?
- Here, let me help you with that.

450
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:23,071
You hear that? You hear that?
They came into the city overnight.

451
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,538
It's started.
What are you gonna do now, huh?

452
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:30,010
Listen, the right stone can buy anything.
Information, safety, even freedom.

453
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:32,615
But a big stone does not stay secret
for very long.

454
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:36,048
The moment you tell anyone about it,
your life is absolutely won'thless.

455
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,348
The only reason you're alive is
you haven't told anyone where it is.

456
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:40,785
Am I right? Am I?

457
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,217
Who do you think got you
out of jail, huh?

458
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,454
- That makes us partners.
- I am not your partner!

459
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,121
What if I helped you find your family?

460
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,824
What do you know of my family?

461
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:54,027
The relief agencies are useless,
the hospitals are overwhelmed.

462
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,799
- There are other ways, bru.
- Liar.

463
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,205
Look at me. I know people, huh?
White people.

464
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:03,506
Without me, you're just another
black man in Africa, all right?

465
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,613
Oh, shit.

466
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,946
We got no time.
What's it gonna be?

467
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:14,114
You would say anything.
How can I trust you?

468
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,692
I don't give a fuck about you, all right?
That diamond could be priceless!

469
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:22,128
We split it, and you get your family.
What's it gonna be, yes or no? Yes or no?

470
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,893
- Where will we go? Where do we go?
- Come on, follow me!

471
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,960
Stay low!

472
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,065
Get your ass over here!

473
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,174
Wait!

474
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,278
Now!

475
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:21,982
Come on, come on.

476
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,395
Come on!

477
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,206
Come on.

478
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,576
Fuck!

479
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,691
No, this way.

480
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,618
Fire!

481
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,279
Fuck! Go, go, go!

482
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,173
Go!

483
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,990
Shit!

484
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,822
No! No!

485
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,034
This way.

486
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,054
This way. Stay low.

487
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,236
Come on. Go, go, go. Come on.

488
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,978
Come on!

489
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,881
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

490
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:02,711
Fire!

491
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:48,321
- Is there another way?
- That bridge is the only way across, huh?

492
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,653
So, what do we do?

493
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:06,239
- You are RUF, huh? And I am your prisoner.
- What do you mean?

494
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,470
You wanna see your son again, don't you?
You stay behind me.

495
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,807
Wait, wait. Wait.

496
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,514
Bring that pink chicken skin
over here, huh?

497
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,088
Now let me shoot that pink ass, boy.

498
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:57,727
Where are we going?

499
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,055
Lungi's under government control.

500
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:05,691
I'm gonna try to locate a sat phone
to get in contact with my pilot, all right?

501
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,235
I have agreed to nothing.

502
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,597
You're in a bit of a conundrum there,
my friend.

503
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:16,041
You know what that means?
It means you have no choice.

504
00:50:29,927 --> 00:50:33,090
So you're a fisherman, huh?

505
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:37,097
- What do you catch mostly?
- Fish.

506
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:46,908
Come on.

507
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,646
- Hello.
- Back away from the fence.

508
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,418
Listen, I'm from
the Cape Herald, all right?

509
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:06,529
My wallet, my credentials,
everything got left in Freetown.

510
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:09,359
We barely got out with our lives.
Can we just get through?

511
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,559
Back away from the fence.

512
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,201
But you are not a journalist.

513
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,808
I'm trying to get us to Kono.

514
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:22,377
- Do you understand that, huh?
- Getting B-roll. Wait.

515
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:25,106
Listen, I'm coming back.
I'm coming back just now.

516
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:28,342
How's it, my bru?
Have you got an extra smoke?

517
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,247
- Here.
- Oh, cheers.

518
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,446
I'm looking for someone, an American
by the name of Maddy Bowen.

519
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:36,388
- Lf you saw her, you would not forget it.
- Yeah, I know her.

520
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,549
- Is it?
- Yeah.

521
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:41,323
Can you tell her Danny Archer's looking
for her? I've got the story she wants.

522
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:44,695
Okay, but I'm going out for a bit.
If I see her before, I'll tell her.

523
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,098
Magic. Listen, we'll be
right down the road, huh?

524
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:50,138
- Sweet. Cheers, bru.
- Cheers.

525
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,944
It is as I said.
You will say anything.

526
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,112
- You don't mind waiting?
- No worries.

527
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:07,155
- Thank you so much. I'll just be a sec.
- All right, Maddy.

528
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,926
Hi.

529
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,858
You got out.

530
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:17,091
Yes. Hello again.

531
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,599
- This is Solomon Vandy.
- Hi.

532
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,294
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

533
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,039
So I'm on deadline. I've been waiting
four hours to use the phone.

534
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:29,508
- I've got someone holding my place in line.
- I understand. Come with me, huh?

535
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,240
All right. Here it is.

536
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:35,351
- There's a company called Tiara Diamonds.
- Right?

537
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,817
They get the stones
that I smuggle into Liberia.

538
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,354
Now, Van De Kaap
has no visible ties to Tiara...

539
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,823
...but through a series of cross holdings
and offshore bank accounts...

540
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,121
...they actually own it.
- You can prove this?

541
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:50,989
- Lf you help me out, yeah.
- Right, here it comes.

542
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,693
Before you say anything,
look at that man. You see him?

543
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:58,733
His entire village was burned down.
His wife and children, they got away.

544
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:02,106
He's been working in the mining camps,
trying to get his family back.

545
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,871
He cannot get through the red tape.

546
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:06,811
All I'm asking is this,
that you help him, huh?

547
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:09,009
And how do you know this man?

548
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:13,487
- I know him. I know him.
- Oh, come on, Archer.

549
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,482
You're using him.

550
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,326
I'm using him, and you are using me,
and this is how it works, isn't it?

551
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:24,262
Come on. Look, you've got access
to U.N. Databases.

552
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,334
- You can track his family for him.
- Why?

553
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,666
This whole country's at war.
Why should I help just one person?

554
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,280
I can't believe I just said that.

555
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:43,145
My family's here, in Guinea?

556
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,618
Yes, according to the manifest.

557
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,319
I do not know how to thank you.

558
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:17,013
Thank you. Thank you.

559
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,699
This is what a million people looks like.

560
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,974
At the moment, the second largest
refugee camp in Africa.

561
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:47,245
Might catch a minute of this on CNN,
somewhere between Sports and Weather.

562
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,057
- Hello.
- Yeah, hello?

563
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,594
I've spoken with Colonel Coedoo...

564
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,898
...and highlighted the names
we're looking for.

565
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,261
- Move away.
- What him doing?

566
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,800
Okay, I'm gonna check for you.

567
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,495
- Wait me there.
- Okay, thank you.

568
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,932
We are here to help you.

569
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,372
This woman says she has
spoken to Coedoo.

570
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:17,309
An entire country made homeless.

571
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:23,584
Two multiplied by three
is equal to six.

572
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:27,280
Two multiplied by four
is equal to eight.

573
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:30,688
Two multiplied by five
is equal to 10.

574
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,955
Two multiplied by six
is equal to 12.

575
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,196
Jassie.

576
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,827
Jassie!

577
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,302
Jassie!

578
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:19,635
- Jassie.
- Solo.

579
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,037
- Jassie.
- Solo.

580
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,576
Jassie. Jassie.

581
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,445
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

582
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,454
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

583
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:40,993
Dia. Dia.

584
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,227
Where is Dia?

585
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:48,163
Jassie!

586
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,112
They took him.

587
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,513
There are only two children
on the manifest.

588
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:10,216
- Where is my son?
- Oh, Christ.

589
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,358
Where is my son?

590
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,292
- Away from the fence.
- Where is my son?

591
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,726
Move away from the fence.

592
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,959
- Let them out! Let them out!
- Keep away from the fence.

593
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,564
Let them out!

594
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:26,064
Away from the fence.

595
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:29,841
- They'll shoot you!
- Jassie!

596
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,379
No! Solo!

597
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,847
Do you want your wife and child
to watch you die?

598
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:38,350
Solo! Solo!

599
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:52,359
They said they're concerned that
some of the refugees might be rebels...

600
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:56,633
...so they refused to release them
until there's a cease-fire.

601
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,805
I'm so sorry, Solomon.

602
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,839
What you want, Mr. Archer,
is beyond those hills...

603
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,175
...where I buried it.

604
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:34,342
You say the mine is on the Sewa River.
Where exactly?

605
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,002
Solomon.

606
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,879
I do not need a map.

607
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:44,453
Yeah, well, I do.
Look, we are down here, huh?

608
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,384
The press convoy
is on its way to Kono.

609
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,855
You say the diamond mine is up here.
Where did you bury it?

610
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,393
When we get to Kono,
we're gonna have to walk, all right?

611
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,330
You damn well better be able to find it.

612
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:05,503
My son is a very good student.

613
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:09,304
He walks five kilometers
to the Sister School...

614
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,846
...every morning to study English.

615
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:17,744
He's going to be a doctor one day.

616
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:45,947
"In the 90-degree heat,
Solomon Vandy drops to his knees...

617
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:49,779
...rattling the wire
with his powerful hands."

618
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:56,087
- What?
- Nothing.

619
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,219
Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?

620
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:03,961
You're right. It's shit.

621
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:07,464
It's like one of those infomercials.

622
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:12,472
You know, the little black babies
with swollen bellies and flies in their eyes.

623
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:16,544
So here I've got dead mothers,
I've got severed limbs, but it's nothing new.

624
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:19,307
It might be enough
to make people cry if they read it...

625
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:20,949
...maybe even write a check...

626
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,483
...but it's not gonna be enough
to make it stop.

627
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:28,349
I am sick of writing about victims,
but it's all I can fucking do.

628
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:30,049
Because I need facts.

629
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:34,754
I need names. I need dates.
I need pictures. I need bank accounts.

630
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,325
People back home
wouldn't buy a ring...

631
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,766
...if they knew it cost
someone else their hand.

632
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:44,566
But I can't write that story...

633
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:48,268
...until I get facts
that can be verified...

634
01:00:48,445 --> 01:00:53,576
...which is to say, until I find someone
who will go on record.

635
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:56,275
So if that is not you...

636
01:00:56,453 --> 01:01:00,549
...and you're not really gonna help me,
and we're not really gonna screw...

637
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,954
...then why don't you get the fuck
out of my face...

638
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,027
...and let me do my work?

639
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:18,106
Do you know that Solomon thinks
his sors gonna be a doctor one day?

640
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:24,040
Maybe his baby dies in that camp.
Maybe his daughter gets raped.

641
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,541
Who knows, maybe both.

642
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,381
Do you realize that
that diamond...

643
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,317
...is the only chance he has
of getting his family out?

644
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:37,722
- You don't give a rat's ass about his family.
- Do you understand that?

645
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,258
Listen, I need to get to Kono, all right?

646
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,528
The only way
is with the press convoy.

647
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,070
I'm a journalist,
and he's my cameraman, all right?

648
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,764
- No.
- Please, Maddy.

649
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:53,568
- Please.
- No!

650
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,256
After I smuggle the stones
across the border...

651
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:13,156
...local buyers get them
to a middleman in Monrovia.

652
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,297
Go on.

653
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:24,671
He pays off Customs and then certifies
that the diamonds were mined in Liberia.

654
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,207
That way, they can be legally exported.

655
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:30,871
Now, once they've reached
the buyers in Antwerp...

656
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,538
...diamonds are brought
to the sorting tables...

657
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,308
...no more questions are asked.

658
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,249
By the time they get to India...

659
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,152
...the dirty stones are mixed with
the clean stones from all over the world...

660
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:44,589
...and then they become
like any other diamonds.

661
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,956
And Van De Kaap
knows about all this?

662
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:49,623
Yeah.

663
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:52,461
When I get to London,
I meet with Simmons.

664
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:56,338
Supply and demand. You control the supply,
and you keep the demand high.

665
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:57,973
- Agreed.
- Good.

666
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,507
Now, there's an underground vault...

667
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:04,238
...where they put all the stones
they buy up to keep off the market...

668
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:06,245
...so they can keep the price high.

669
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:10,417
If rebels wanna flood the market
with a billion dollars' won'th of rough...

670
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:13,647
...a company like Van De Kaap,
who says that they're rare...

671
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,484
...can't afford to let that happen.

672
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,922
Especially when they're telling
some poor sod...

673
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:20,585
...he's supposed to shell out
three months' salary...

674
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,094
...for an engagement ring.

675
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:25,257
Now, technically speaking,
they're not financing the war...

676
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:28,268
...but creating a situation
where it pays to keep it going.

677
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:31,669
- You understand?
- Yes. And where's my proof?

678
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:42,277
Names, dates and numbered accounts.

679
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:47,447
You publish one word of this story
before I give them the stone...

680
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:49,649
...and I'm dead, huh?

681
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:54,195
After I give it to them,
then... I leave this continent forever.

682
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:58,229
If you don't come out
with the diamond?

683
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,801
Then write whatever you want.

684
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:03,731
I'm already dead.

685
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:14,243
Now, remember. All you say is,
"I am the cameraman," all right?

686
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,351
Listen, I cannot do this.

687
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:19,147
- Why not?
- Because I am not a journalist.

688
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,813
- Of course you're not.
- Well, then how can I say I am?

689
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:25,188
Because you do. Because that's how
you get your son back, all right?

690
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,761
Now get on the bus. Go.

691
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:47,348
I am the cameraman.

692
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,450
You are writing about
what is happening here?

693
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,248
Yes.

694
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:01,625
So when people in your country read it,
they will come help us, yes?

695
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,423
Probably not.

696
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:07,400
- You heard of a Stinger?
- What?

697
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:12,030
Your friend, Maddy. She's like a full-on,
heat-seeking missile, bru.

698
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,904
I mean, I saw her go into Afghanistan...

699
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,206
...like about 200 clicks
into Taliban land.

700
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:21,214
When the military said no,
she just took a bus, bru.

701
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,683
Came back with 3000 words,
and she still looked so good.

702
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,719
- Like hot, you know?
- All right.

703
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:28,618
Calm down to the frantic now, huh?

704
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,057
- What's that?
- What's going on?

705
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:34,424
Looks like it was an RPG.

706
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,428
Open the door. Let us out.

707
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,700
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on. Go, go, go.

708
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,137
Go, go! Move, move, move!

709
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,840
We've just happened upon
the sight of an ambush...

710
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,308
...fifteen kilometers
from the Liberian border...

711
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:52,107
...near the Moa River...
- As you can see behind me...

712
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:53,805
...just a few minutes ago...

713
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:56,315
...an ambulance has...
- Got movement in the bush.

714
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:58,544
- Check out the head of the road.
- Spread out.

715
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,450
- At this site.
Dozens of...

716
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,391
Many are injured.

717
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,699
Get back on the bus, huh?
Get back on! Come on!

718
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:18,500
- Maddy!
- Move it! Move it!

719
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:19,663
Get back on the bus!

720
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,400
Solomon! Solomon!

721
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:23,067
- Let's go.
- Solomon, come here!

722
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:24,679
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

723
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:27,543
- Get in the bus!
- Move, move, move! Come on, come on.

724
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:29,715
- Move!
- Get in the bus. Let's go.

725
01:06:29,886 --> 01:06:32,081
Get in, get in.
Goddamn it, get in! Get in!

726
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:34,689
- Let me inside!
- There's no fucking space!

727
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:37,121
- Let them on the bus.
- You give him your seat.

728
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:40,262
What if we just take your place, huh?
What if we take your place?

729
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:43,364
That's enough. He can ride with me.
Oi, he can ride with me.

730
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:46,093
Maddy! Let's go!
Maddy, let's go. Come on!

731
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:02,143
Nothing like a little bang-bang
to get the heart started, Maddy.

732
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:06,216
- Whatever you say, Corbauld.
- Come on, love. Don't be like that.

733
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:09,847
Story's played out, hasn't it?
Government bad, rebels worse.

734
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,827
No one gives a toss anymore.
Know what I mean?

735
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:50,532
This medicine will make you strong...

736
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,467
...make you invisible to your enemies.

737
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,866
Bullets will bounce off you.

738
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:10,448
Superboy Killer, yes, huh?
Commando.

739
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:13,555
Foreigners are the cause of the problems.

740
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:19,992
Poppy Sankoh say,
"Overthrow those who would exploit you."

741
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,354
I am Baby Killer.

742
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:30,799
- I am the Master of Disaster.
- You will be strong.

743
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:35,576
I am Born Trouble.

744
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:44,043
I am See Me No More.

745
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,531
You'd think they'd want
at least one decent road in this place.

746
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:02,097
I'm gonna have to start charging
an entrance fee. Oh, God!

747
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:33,196
Get down!

748
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,540
- Look out!
- Shit!

749
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,616
- You all right?
- Fine.

750
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:04,562
Shit!

751
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,001
Hold on!

752
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:20,514
Hold on!

753
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,022
Come on.

754
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,731
- Everyone all right, huh?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

755
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,371
Let me see that. You okay?

756
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,598
- Yeah.
- All right.

757
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,236
Quietly, now. Quietly.

758
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,834
Come on.

759
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:39,210
Kamajors. Local militia
protecting their homes, huh?

760
01:11:39,384 --> 01:11:41,249
- Do not look them in the eye.
- No.

761
01:11:55,734 --> 01:11:57,224
Excuse me. Excuse me?

762
01:11:58,169 --> 01:12:01,536
Hi, I'm Maddy Bowen
with vital Affairs magazine.

763
01:12:01,706 --> 01:12:04,766
Wonder if I could take your picture.
I'm just gonna get my camera.

764
01:12:04,943 --> 01:12:07,878
I've heard about your struggle.
I'd love to know more about it.

765
01:12:08,046 --> 01:12:10,674
Would you mind if I took your picture?
Everyone together?

766
01:12:11,016 --> 01:12:12,779
Everyone could all come in together.

767
01:12:16,287 --> 01:12:18,312
Is that okay?
If everyone could come closer.

768
01:12:19,357 --> 01:12:22,451
If you come over here and come in
nice and close. That's good.

769
01:12:22,627 --> 01:12:26,085
Yeah. That's great.
And we'll get one with all of us.

770
01:12:26,364 --> 01:12:28,161
There you go. That's perfect.

771
01:12:29,968 --> 01:12:32,493
How about one together?
Us together, what do you think?

772
01:12:32,671 --> 01:12:34,639
I'll come in like this, yeah?

773
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,429
Cheese.

774
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:40,942
So do you think
they've read your work?

775
01:12:41,112 --> 01:12:43,239
Shut up.

776
01:12:56,127 --> 01:12:58,459
Hey, get them, get them, get them.

777
01:13:00,098 --> 01:13:03,795
- I got a score. I got a score.
- You missed.

778
01:13:04,502 --> 01:13:06,663
Where have you come from?

779
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:09,968
- Where did you come from?
- Where have you come from?

780
01:13:11,076 --> 01:13:13,909
That's right. Yeah.
From New York. From America.

781
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:15,979
I don't have anything for you.

782
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:38,098
My name is Benjamin Margai.

783
01:13:38,803 --> 01:13:40,862
Danny Archer. This is Maddy Bowen.

784
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:44,099
- Hello. How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

785
01:13:58,923 --> 01:14:01,221
I'm the cameraman?

786
01:14:03,828 --> 01:14:06,763
The Belgians were the first
to chop off limbs in Africa.

787
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:11,300
King Leopold took one hand
for every hundredth slave in the Congo...

788
01:14:11,469 --> 01:14:13,562
...to keep them in line.

789
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:17,140
Many of these children
were taken by the RUF.

790
01:14:17,308 --> 01:14:19,299
We have taken them back.

791
01:14:19,477 --> 01:14:22,571
Some of them have been
made to do horrible things.

792
01:14:22,747 --> 01:14:25,773
We are trying
to bring them back to life.

793
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:27,577
Let me show you.

794
01:14:29,621 --> 01:14:31,919
Imagine doing all this, huh?

795
01:14:33,224 --> 01:14:35,124
What's your excuse?

796
01:14:35,927 --> 01:14:41,263
Well, it's gotten hard to go back
to sipping lattes and talking interest rates.

797
01:14:41,499 --> 01:14:44,127
So you're an action junkie, huh?

798
01:14:45,069 --> 01:14:47,367
Three out of five ex-boyfriends
recently polled...

799
01:14:47,539 --> 01:14:51,976
...say that I prefer to be
in a constant state of crisis.

800
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:54,774
Maybe I just give a shit.

801
01:14:58,449 --> 01:14:59,438
You were good today.

802
01:15:01,886 --> 01:15:03,217
You know that?

803
01:15:04,355 --> 01:15:05,845
You too.

804
01:15:08,793 --> 01:15:11,728
"...that sometimes they forgot
to close the door.

805
01:15:11,896 --> 01:15:14,956
She also wrote
about her sister Josie...

806
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:20,561
...who was very ill
and who had to be taken to hospital."

807
01:15:22,607 --> 01:15:23,801
Cheers.

808
01:15:26,611 --> 01:15:29,205
So how many attacks
have there been in the area?

809
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,281
I have known most of the rebels
since they were children.

810
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:36,978
The local commander is still afraid
I will come after him with my ruler.

811
01:15:38,423 --> 01:15:41,881
So you think because your intentions
are good, they'll spare you, huh?

812
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,893
My heart always told me
that people are inerently good.

813
01:15:45,063 --> 01:15:47,258
My experience suggests otherwise.

814
01:15:47,432 --> 01:15:49,229
But what about you, Mr. Archer?

815
01:15:49,667 --> 01:15:52,101
In your long career as a journalist...

816
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:55,103
...would you say that people
are mostly good?

817
01:15:57,175 --> 01:15:58,608
No.

818
01:15:58,877 --> 01:16:00,401
I'd say they're just people.

819
01:16:00,578 --> 01:16:04,514
Exactly. It is what they do
that makes them good or bad.

820
01:16:04,682 --> 01:16:07,913
A moment of love,
even in a bad man...

821
01:16:08,186 --> 01:16:10,654
...can give meaning to a life.

822
01:16:10,822 --> 01:16:14,451
None of us knows which path
will lead us to God.

823
01:16:17,195 --> 01:16:18,685
Hey!

824
01:17:06,678 --> 01:17:08,543
It's palm wine.

825
01:17:17,822 --> 01:17:20,757
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, yeah. It takes getting used to, huh?

826
01:17:20,925 --> 01:17:22,415
God.

827
01:17:22,593 --> 01:17:25,323
- Drank that as a boy.
- In Rhodesia?

828
01:17:27,498 --> 01:17:28,726
I take notes.

829
01:17:31,436 --> 01:17:33,165
The Shona...

830
01:17:34,472 --> 01:17:36,770
The Shona have a word for me.

831
01:17:38,609 --> 01:17:42,238
- It means "white boy in Africa."
- When did you leave?

832
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,575
I didn't leave.

833
01:17:44,749 --> 01:17:49,083
I got sent away to South Africa
in 1978 when the munts overran us.

834
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:50,887
Then you joined the army?

835
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:55,919
Yeah. Yeah, I did my time in Angola.

836
01:17:56,094 --> 01:17:58,790
- The 32 Battalion.
- That's right.

837
01:18:01,165 --> 01:18:04,430
You know, contrary to what
you might think about us...

838
01:18:04,602 --> 01:18:08,094
...we fought with the blacks, huh?
Yeah. Side by side.

839
01:18:08,272 --> 01:18:12,003
There was no apartheid in a foxhole.
The colonel always used to tell us that.

840
01:18:12,176 --> 01:18:15,577
- This is Colonel Coetzee?
- Yeah.

841
01:18:17,815 --> 01:18:21,216
Then, of course, it's 1994.
No more army.

842
01:18:21,386 --> 01:18:23,217
No more apartheid.

843
01:18:23,388 --> 01:18:26,755
Truth and reconciliation
and all of that rubbish, you know.

844
01:18:26,924 --> 01:18:28,414
Kumbaya.

845
01:18:29,193 --> 01:18:31,957
We fought and died together,
you know?

846
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:35,395
Black and white. Most people back home
didn't even know we were at war.

847
01:18:35,566 --> 01:18:37,431
We thought we were
fighting Communism...

848
01:18:37,602 --> 01:18:41,470
...but in the end, it was all about
who gets what, you know?

849
01:18:41,639 --> 01:18:44,699
Lvory, oil, gold:

850
01:18:45,643 --> 01:18:47,406
Diamonds.

851
01:18:50,648 --> 01:18:53,617
So one day I decided,
"Fuck it," you know?

852
01:18:54,252 --> 01:18:55,810
"I'm gonna get mine."

853
01:18:55,987 --> 01:18:57,579
You gonna steal his diamond?

854
01:19:05,096 --> 01:19:08,793
That diamond is my ticket
out of this godforsaken continent.

855
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,831
That doesn't answer the question.

856
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:25,575
My dad came home
from the war in '69.

857
01:19:27,852 --> 01:19:29,717
And it took him...

858
01:19:30,855 --> 01:19:32,948
...about 20 years to get right.

859
01:19:34,826 --> 01:19:36,123
What?

860
01:19:38,996 --> 01:19:43,296
You Americans love to talk
about your feelings, huh?

861
01:19:43,468 --> 01:19:45,732
So, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

862
01:19:45,903 --> 01:19:48,030
- Got a thing for messed-up vets now?
- Shut up.

863
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:51,508
You lost both your parents.

864
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:55,243
That's a polite way
of putting it, yeah.

865
01:19:57,882 --> 01:20:00,214
Mom was raped and shot...

866
01:20:03,054 --> 01:20:06,148
...and Dad was decapitated
and hung from a hook in the barn.

867
01:20:07,692 --> 01:20:09,421
I was 9.

868
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:14,622
Boohoo, right?

869
01:20:18,369 --> 01:20:20,496
Sometimes I wonder...

870
01:20:23,608 --> 01:20:26,668
...will God ever forgive us
for what we've done to each other?

871
01:20:30,314 --> 01:20:33,181
Then I look around and I realize...

872
01:20:34,085 --> 01:20:37,543
...God left this place a long time ago.

873
01:20:44,262 --> 01:20:46,287
It's...

874
01:20:48,566 --> 01:20:50,500
What's the point, huh?

875
01:21:33,945 --> 01:21:35,970
Oh, shit. Keep moving, huh?

876
01:21:36,147 --> 01:21:37,910
- What?
- Drive at them. They'll panic.

877
01:21:38,082 --> 01:21:40,346
Do you know where the word
"infantry" comes from?

878
01:21:40,518 --> 01:21:43,817
It means "child soldier."
They are just children.

879
01:21:43,988 --> 01:21:47,651
- Stop! Stop! RUF on the road!
- Hi. Hello. Hello.

880
01:21:48,893 --> 01:21:49,951
Hello, little brothers.

881
01:21:50,127 --> 01:21:52,652
- RUF on the road!
- Yeah, yeah. What is your names?

882
01:21:53,164 --> 01:21:55,462
I'm Dead Body.
Who is this motherfucker?

883
01:21:55,633 --> 01:21:57,294
We are teachers on our way to Kono.

884
01:21:57,468 --> 01:21:59,698
Only RUF on the road.

885
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:01,804
- RUF only!
- Yes, yes, I understand that.

886
01:22:02,006 --> 01:22:03,337
- Only RUF!
- But son, this is...

887
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:07,202
Don't move! Don't move! Fuck.

888
01:22:09,447 --> 01:22:12,780
Jesus Christ! Maddy, press your hand
against the exit wound there, huh?

889
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:15,248
- Got it.
- Keep it there, huh?

890
01:22:15,419 --> 01:22:17,182
Whatever you do,
don't talk, all right?

891
01:22:17,355 --> 01:22:19,186
Is there any wine left in that jug?

892
01:22:19,357 --> 01:22:21,222
- Here.
- Pour it all over everything, huh?

893
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,695
The colonel's gonna have a medic
at the airstrip in Kono.

894
01:22:25,863 --> 01:22:28,855
- How far is it?
- You said not to talk.

895
01:22:29,133 --> 01:22:30,327
A comedian, huh?

896
01:22:44,515 --> 01:22:46,915
- How's his pulse?
- I can feel it sometimes.

897
01:22:57,361 --> 01:23:00,330
- Hold it right there.
- Stop.

898
01:23:00,498 --> 01:23:01,726
Papers, please.

899
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:07,131
Excuse me.

900
01:23:07,305 --> 01:23:10,240
I was just trying
to keep pressure on the wound.

901
01:23:10,408 --> 01:23:12,933
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- You'll be all right, huh?

902
01:23:13,611 --> 01:23:14,908
Will you?

903
01:23:15,613 --> 01:23:18,605
I'll check on him in the tent
in a little bit. Thank you.

904
01:23:18,849 --> 01:23:20,180
Hey.

905
01:23:20,718 --> 01:23:22,709
Look who's alive, eh?

906
01:23:22,887 --> 01:23:24,218
I told the H you'd be back.

907
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:29,125
I'm afraid we're evacuating
all non-military personnel, miss.

908
01:23:29,293 --> 01:23:31,124
Transport touches down at 1600.

909
01:23:31,295 --> 01:23:33,058
She's with me, all right?

910
01:23:33,264 --> 01:23:36,927
No exceptions, pal. This is gonna be ugly.
Colonel doesn't want an audience.

911
01:23:37,101 --> 01:23:39,899
Is I.R.'s presence here
known to other African nations?

912
01:23:41,405 --> 01:23:43,430
- She's with you?
- Yeah.

913
01:23:44,575 --> 01:23:46,440
Come on. The colonel's this way.

914
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,441
Give me a minute, huh?

915
01:23:51,615 --> 01:23:54,140
We block their escape
by blowing the bridge.

916
01:23:55,786 --> 01:23:57,481
That's correct.

917
01:23:58,222 --> 01:24:00,520
You made it out. Well done.

918
01:24:00,725 --> 01:24:02,659
Negative, Kilo Foxtrot, stand by.

919
01:24:03,327 --> 01:24:06,990
- Colonel, sir.
- So must be real, then.

920
01:24:08,165 --> 01:24:09,359
The pink.

921
01:24:09,867 --> 01:24:12,461
Well, you're part
of this operation now.

922
01:24:12,636 --> 01:24:16,128
First we snuff everything that moves
out there, then we find your diamond.

923
01:24:16,307 --> 01:24:17,934
Colonel?

924
01:24:18,476 --> 01:24:20,910
Go get kitted. Yes?

925
01:24:27,218 --> 01:24:29,209
Move, move, move!

926
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:32,685
- Go get your kit.
- Will do, chum. Will do.

927
01:24:36,227 --> 01:24:39,390
It's go time, all right?
Meet me behind the tents.

928
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,195
How's Benjamin?

929
01:24:44,368 --> 01:24:45,835
They say he'll live.

930
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:48,433
Good. Good.

931
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:57,643
Listen, Maddy...

932
01:24:59,049 --> 01:25:00,812
...I need you to do me one last favor.

933
01:25:01,852 --> 01:25:03,217
Yeah?

934
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:06,850
Tell that guard
you wanna put him...

935
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:09,686
...on the cover of Soldier of Fortune
magazine for me.

936
01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:16,961
You're going in.

937
01:25:21,372 --> 01:25:23,636
You and Solomon.

938
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:26,799
You're going in now.

939
01:25:27,645 --> 01:25:29,840
Your plane leaves
in a few minutes, huh?

940
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:34,418
You're an idiot.

941
01:25:38,722 --> 01:25:41,589
- What if I wanted to go in with you?
- I'd say no.

942
01:25:41,759 --> 01:25:43,750
- What if I insist?
- I'd insist back.

943
01:25:49,867 --> 01:25:51,061
It's my story.

944
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:54,636
Your story is Van De Kaap, all right?
That stone is mine.

945
01:25:54,805 --> 01:25:58,241
I'm not leaving here without it,
you understand?

946
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:02,577
Please, just give me two minutes.

947
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:20,729
Yeah.

948
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:33,737
- Hello.
- Hi.

949
01:26:33,911 --> 01:26:37,142
My name is Maddy Bowen.
I'm with vital Affairs magazine.

950
01:26:37,314 --> 01:26:39,782
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

951
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:41,474
Well, that depends what they are.

952
01:26:41,652 --> 01:26:45,611
Oh, I see you're familiar
with our devious ways, aren't you?

953
01:26:46,357 --> 01:26:48,257
Okay, so I'll start
with something simple.

954
01:27:00,871 --> 01:27:03,533
And before that you were with
the South African Defense...?

955
01:27:03,707 --> 01:27:05,368
- Defense Force, correct.
- Of course.

956
01:27:05,543 --> 01:27:08,979
And was that with Colonel Coetzee?
Were you in Angola?

957
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:10,670
Angola, yeah.

958
01:27:12,283 --> 01:27:15,252
That is all I really need to know.
Thank you so much.

959
01:27:15,452 --> 01:27:16,919
- Thank you.
- Okay.

960
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:28,330
Thank you, huh?

961
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:30,933
Just keeping my end of the deal.

962
01:27:31,535 --> 01:27:32,832
Good luck to you, Solomon.

963
01:27:33,137 --> 01:27:34,627
Okay.

964
01:27:35,806 --> 01:27:39,640
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- Thank you for all you have done.

965
01:27:47,084 --> 01:27:49,678
- Listen, l...
- No, you listen.

966
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:56,191
In another life maybe, all right?

967
01:27:57,628 --> 01:27:59,459
Yeah. Sure.

968
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:00,995
Yeah.

969
01:28:05,336 --> 01:28:07,463
You find yourself a good man,
all right, Maddy?

970
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:16,436
You know, I've got three sisters.

971
01:28:16,614 --> 01:28:19,242
They're all married to good men.

972
01:28:21,118 --> 01:28:22,176
I prefer my life.

973
01:28:24,822 --> 01:28:29,282
Here is my office phone...

974
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:31,826
...home phone, cell phone.

975
01:28:33,931 --> 01:28:37,094
I'm used to being pursued,
but what the heck.

976
01:28:48,278 --> 01:28:50,405
You better get on that plane, huh?

977
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:54,049
You should get on that plane.

978
01:29:02,226 --> 01:29:04,023
So should you.

979
01:29:10,501 --> 01:29:11,627
You gonna call me?

980
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:16,929
Soon as I'm near a phone, yeah.

981
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:20,241
Yeah, right.

982
01:29:42,066 --> 01:29:45,331
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

983
01:29:49,907 --> 01:29:51,499
Oh, shit.

984
01:29:51,775 --> 01:29:54,505
Nabil? Yeah, I'll call you
when we get closer, all right?

985
01:29:54,678 --> 01:29:57,272
You keep me posted. Right.

986
01:29:57,448 --> 01:30:01,248
All right. I set the pace, huh?
Two-hour marches, five-minute breaks.

987
01:30:01,418 --> 01:30:05,252
If I hold my hand up like this, you stop.
If I point to the dirt, you lie flat.

988
01:30:05,422 --> 01:30:08,983
If I say go, you move like your life
depended on it. Understood?

989
01:30:09,159 --> 01:30:11,821
- Yes, boss.
- Come on.

990
01:30:22,106 --> 01:30:23,767
Tell me about the stone.

991
01:30:23,941 --> 01:30:26,569
Is it clear or is it milky?

992
01:30:26,744 --> 01:30:28,268
Clear.

993
01:30:28,445 --> 01:30:30,845
And the color, is it strong?

994
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:32,242
Does it hold the light?

995
01:30:32,416 --> 01:30:34,475
It is as you say.

996
01:30:34,918 --> 01:30:38,081
- About the size of a bird's egg?
- Yes.

997
01:30:38,255 --> 01:30:42,419
One hundred carats.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

998
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:25,366
Dia!

999
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:29,239
Stop the truck!

1000
01:31:30,007 --> 01:31:31,702
I thought it was Dia.

1001
01:32:25,629 --> 01:32:27,187
Wake up.

1002
01:32:29,032 --> 01:32:32,126
Don't worry, they're gone, huh?

1003
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:36,598
You know, I once had this buddy...

1004
01:32:36,773 --> 01:32:38,638
...named Mabhoko.

1005
01:32:39,409 --> 01:32:42,640
We used to hunt bush meat
together as kids, huh?

1006
01:32:43,447 --> 01:32:44,812
Baboons.

1007
01:32:44,982 --> 01:32:47,849
Baboons, they were
the hardest to catch. They're...

1008
01:32:48,952 --> 01:32:50,283
They're cunning.

1009
01:32:50,454 --> 01:32:52,547
Cunning creatures.

1010
01:32:52,823 --> 01:32:55,451
Fast, strong.

1011
01:32:55,626 --> 01:32:57,856
Got good eyesight.

1012
01:32:58,362 --> 01:33:02,389
We would always find them
by the smell of their shit.

1013
01:33:02,566 --> 01:33:07,697
And that's how we learned to track
your black terrorists in Angola, huh?

1014
01:33:11,775 --> 01:33:13,208
By the smell of your shit.

1015
01:33:14,244 --> 01:33:15,711
It's not...

1016
01:33:15,879 --> 01:33:18,609
It's not the same as a baboors.

1017
01:33:20,851 --> 01:33:24,412
But, you know, after you skin it...

1018
01:33:25,722 --> 01:33:27,952
...the flesh of a baboon...

1019
01:33:28,225 --> 01:33:30,625
...isn't that much different
than a mars, you know.

1020
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:37,967
I'll tell you, I can track anything.

1021
01:33:50,213 --> 01:33:52,374
You risk my life like that again...

1022
01:33:57,754 --> 01:33:59,881
...and I'll peel your face
back off your head.

1023
01:34:02,392 --> 01:34:04,656
Do you understand?

1024
01:34:12,903 --> 01:34:14,962
Make us a fire.

1025
01:35:25,242 --> 01:35:26,834
What'd he say?

1026
01:35:27,010 --> 01:35:29,137
We are going the right way.

1027
01:35:36,286 --> 01:35:39,016
Hold up there, my man.
It's this way, huh?

1028
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:42,685
Where do you think you are going?

1029
01:35:44,361 --> 01:35:46,022
Stop!

1030
01:35:46,296 --> 01:35:47,991
I said, stop!

1031
01:35:48,432 --> 01:35:49,990
He is not down there, all right?

1032
01:35:52,035 --> 01:35:55,698
All right. You're gonna need
some of that old discipline, huh?

1033
01:35:55,872 --> 01:35:58,136
Now you listen here, my boy,
and you listen well.

1034
01:35:58,308 --> 01:36:00,276
You are not going down there.
Are we clear?

1035
01:36:00,444 --> 01:36:02,071
You are not the master.

1036
01:36:02,245 --> 01:36:05,874
Right now, that is exactly what I am,
and you'd better remember it, Kaffir!

1037
01:36:21,031 --> 01:36:22,362
Don't you fucking move, huh?

1038
01:36:22,532 --> 01:36:24,500
Don't you move. Don't you move, huh?

1039
01:36:24,668 --> 01:36:27,000
- My son is there!
- Your son is gone!

1040
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:28,501
- He is alive!
- He's gone!

1041
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:31,232
He's alive! He's there
with those crazy people!

1042
01:36:32,442 --> 01:36:35,878
I am his father! His father!
I should have protected him!

1043
01:36:36,346 --> 01:36:40,248
I must go find him.
I cannot live without knowing!

1044
01:36:40,417 --> 01:36:42,647
Shoot me if you want, but I'm going.

1045
01:36:44,754 --> 01:36:48,212
Why should it matter,
I'm dead already.

1046
01:36:56,066 --> 01:36:58,330
We wait until dark, huh?

1047
01:37:27,497 --> 01:37:28,896
Are you satisfied?

1048
01:37:31,868 --> 01:37:34,393
All right, come on.

1049
01:37:39,142 --> 01:37:41,337
- Is fighting for Sierra Leone

1050
01:37:41,511 --> 01:37:44,571
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone

1051
01:37:44,748 --> 01:37:47,683
Go tell my parents
They may see me no more

1052
01:37:47,851 --> 01:37:50,911
In the battlefield
We're fighting forever

1053
01:37:51,087 --> 01:37:53,988
Go tell my parents
They may see me no more

1054
01:37:54,157 --> 01:37:55,624
In the battlefield...

1055
01:37:58,195 --> 01:38:00,163
You are how old?

1056
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:02,093
Me? I'm 31.

1057
01:38:02,265 --> 01:38:04,426
And you have no wife?

1058
01:38:04,901 --> 01:38:07,768
- No.
- No children?

1059
01:38:08,939 --> 01:38:10,236
No.

1060
01:38:10,407 --> 01:38:12,034
And no home?

1061
01:38:12,209 --> 01:38:13,870
No.

1062
01:38:14,578 --> 01:38:16,978
But you have money, yes?

1063
01:38:17,147 --> 01:38:19,411
Yeah, some.

1064
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:21,574
But not enough?

1065
01:38:24,087 --> 01:38:25,645
No.

1066
01:38:26,389 --> 01:38:30,883
If you get this diamond,
you will have enough money, yes?

1067
01:38:33,029 --> 01:38:34,053
Yes.

1068
01:38:34,231 --> 01:38:37,029
Then you will get
a wife and children?

1069
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,599
Probably not, no.

1070
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:41,659
What?

1071
01:38:43,773 --> 01:38:45,297
What?

1072
01:38:45,709 --> 01:38:47,768
I am confused.

1073
01:38:48,845 --> 01:38:50,312
Yeah?

1074
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:53,278
That makes two of us, my bru.

1075
01:38:55,785 --> 01:38:59,277
Oh, Christ.
I've gotta quit smoking, huh?

1076
01:38:59,889 --> 01:39:01,857
Why don't you?

1077
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:04,525
I'll tell you what, Solomon.

1078
01:39:04,794 --> 01:39:09,322
You find me this diamond,
and I'll quit right then and there, huh?

1079
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:19,732
- You were born in Zimbabwe?
- Oh, yeah.

1080
01:39:19,909 --> 01:39:23,072
- Is it beautiful there?
- Sure you're not a reporter?

1081
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:26,938
Because you ask a hell of a lot
of questions, my man.

1082
01:39:34,591 --> 01:39:38,288
My grandfather told
many stories of war.

1083
01:39:38,528 --> 01:39:41,361
How the Mende fought the Temne.

1084
01:39:41,531 --> 01:39:45,262
Or how two tribes would fight
when somebody had stolen a woman.

1085
01:39:55,345 --> 01:39:58,712
I understand white people
want our diamonds, yes?

1086
01:40:01,751 --> 01:40:05,482
But how can my own people
do this to each other?

1087
01:40:13,763 --> 01:40:15,822
I know good people...

1088
01:40:15,999 --> 01:40:18,866
...who say there is something
wrong with us...

1089
01:40:19,235 --> 01:40:20,395
...inside our black skin.

1090
01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:23,903
That we were better off
when the white man ruled.

1091
01:40:25,809 --> 01:40:28,607
But my son is good.

1092
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:32,375
And when he grows up...

1093
01:40:32,549 --> 01:40:33,777
...and peace comes...

1094
01:40:37,787 --> 01:40:40,449
...this place will be a paradise.

1095
01:40:48,331 --> 01:40:50,799
We'll get your son back, huh?

1096
01:41:32,509 --> 01:41:34,841
Where is it exactly?

1097
01:41:36,379 --> 01:41:39,280
Through the camp, by the river.

1098
01:41:43,887 --> 01:41:45,582
Christ.

1099
01:41:46,055 --> 01:41:47,682
Okay.

1100
01:41:48,324 --> 01:41:50,189
I'm gonna make contact
with the colonel.

1101
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,884
He'll send in an air strike.

1102
01:41:52,328 --> 01:41:55,297
- What is that?
- A chopper, huh? An attack helicopter.

1103
01:41:55,465 --> 01:41:57,990
- We use it as a diversion.
- What if my son is there?

1104
01:41:58,168 --> 01:41:59,465
- He isn't.
- How do you know?

1105
01:41:59,636 --> 01:42:03,231
I said we do it my way now, all right?
Don't fuck with me.

1106
01:42:13,149 --> 01:42:15,549
Cordell, it's Danny.

1107
01:42:15,718 --> 01:42:18,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up and listen, all right?

1108
01:42:18,221 --> 01:42:21,088
You tell the colonel I've found the stone.

1109
01:42:21,257 --> 01:42:24,226
No, I haven't got it in my hands,
but I'm OP-ing its location.

1110
01:42:24,394 --> 01:42:25,986
It's a major rebel camp, my man.

1111
01:42:26,162 --> 01:42:28,528
You tell him to send in the dakadak.

1112
01:42:29,098 --> 01:42:31,965
Because I stole a GPS, that's how.

1113
01:42:32,135 --> 01:42:34,695
If you shut up and listen,
I could give the coordinates.

1114
01:42:35,138 --> 01:42:38,164
Zero-nine-zero-five-four-two-four, north.

1115
01:42:38,341 --> 01:42:42,903
Three-two-seven-two-nine
three-zero-five-zero, east.

1116
01:42:43,079 --> 01:42:45,343
I'll call back at midnight to confirm.

1117
01:42:48,117 --> 01:42:51,052
You can look all night,
my friend, right?

1118
01:42:51,221 --> 01:42:53,883
I promise you he is not there.

1119
01:42:59,128 --> 01:43:01,323
They're coming in the morning, all right?

1120
01:43:01,498 --> 01:43:03,932
No movement, my friend. You stay still.

1121
01:43:05,869 --> 01:43:08,303
When it gets dark,
then we move in closer.

1122
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:33,452
Solomon. Shit.

1123
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:45,639
I can do it.

1124
01:43:45,808 --> 01:43:46,900
- Help me.
- Help him.

1125
01:43:47,076 --> 01:43:49,135
Thank you, Papa.

1126
01:44:31,087 --> 01:44:33,317
Hey, you smell.

1127
01:44:34,524 --> 01:44:35,991
That's fine.

1128
01:44:48,304 --> 01:44:50,272
- Ready? I'm winning.
- Okay, let's go.

1129
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,101
Play, man.

1130
01:44:53,676 --> 01:44:56,577
- Play. Play the card.
- Play.

1131
01:45:23,373 --> 01:45:24,499
Dia.

1132
01:45:27,543 --> 01:45:29,238
Leave me alone.

1133
01:45:30,279 --> 01:45:33,510
- Dia. I'm your papa. Come with me.
- Hey.

1134
01:45:33,683 --> 01:45:35,412
- Dia.
- Get away from me.

1135
01:45:35,585 --> 01:45:37,382
- Dia. Dia!
- I do not know you. Traitor!

1136
01:45:37,754 --> 01:45:40,245
- Enemy! Enemy!
- What the hell are you doing?

1137
01:45:40,423 --> 01:45:41,651
- What are you doing?
- I don't know you!

1138
01:45:41,824 --> 01:45:43,121
- What's wrong?
- I hate you!

1139
01:45:43,292 --> 01:45:45,021
- Dia, come with me!
- I hate you!

1140
01:45:45,194 --> 01:45:46,718
Get away from me!

1141
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:51,063
- Get him!
- Don't shoot!

1142
01:45:51,567 --> 01:45:53,797
- Don't shoot! Don't...! Don't shoot!
- I hate you!

1143
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:55,870
- Fisherman! Traitor!
- Don't shoot!

1144
01:45:56,039 --> 01:45:58,269
Get away from me!

1145
01:46:05,381 --> 01:46:07,542
I knew you would come back.

1146
01:46:08,017 --> 01:46:11,509
I have dug and dug and dug,
but I've found nothing.

1147
01:46:11,688 --> 01:46:13,588
Nothing.

1148
01:46:13,856 --> 01:46:15,346
Dig, dig, dig!

1149
01:46:15,525 --> 01:46:17,823
You will find it for me.

1150
01:46:18,795 --> 01:46:21,093
You will dig up
what you have come back for.

1151
01:46:21,264 --> 01:46:22,288
No.

1152
01:46:22,465 --> 01:46:24,899
Why should the diamond
go to the foreign devils?

1153
01:46:25,635 --> 01:46:28,900
We will use it
to make the country strong.

1154
01:46:29,372 --> 01:46:31,966
RUF is fighting for the people!

1155
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:37,404
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

1156
01:46:40,249 --> 01:46:41,978
Pick it up.

1157
01:46:43,186 --> 01:46:46,155
Why? You are going to kill me anyway.

1158
01:46:46,322 --> 01:46:49,416
I do not need to kill you,
Solomon Vandy.

1159
01:46:52,261 --> 01:46:54,456
If you do not bring me the diamond...

1160
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:56,860
...I will find the rest of your family.

1161
01:46:57,033 --> 01:46:59,467
Just as I have found your son.

1162
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:03,937
I will rape your wife
in front of your eyes...

1163
01:47:04,741 --> 01:47:07,039
...slit her throat...

1164
01:47:07,643 --> 01:47:10,009
...and I will keep your daughters
for myself.

1165
01:47:15,418 --> 01:47:17,852
You think I am a devil...

1166
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:20,352
...but only because I have lived in hell.

1167
01:47:21,991 --> 01:47:24,653
I want to get out.

1168
01:47:25,261 --> 01:47:27,354
You will help me.

1169
01:47:30,199 --> 01:47:31,496
I don't remember.

1170
01:47:31,667 --> 01:47:34,636
Find it or your family will die!

1171
01:47:35,571 --> 01:47:37,436
Now pick it up!

1172
01:47:52,989 --> 01:47:54,422
- Go!
- Bastards!

1173
01:47:54,590 --> 01:47:55,955
Shoot it!

1174
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:01,919
Dia!

1175
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:16,205
Come, boy. Come. This way. This way.

1176
01:48:17,079 --> 01:48:18,307
Dia!

1177
01:48:41,204 --> 01:48:42,796
Colonel, we think Archer's there.

1178
01:48:42,972 --> 01:48:45,805
I don't give a damn who's down there.
Kill them all.

1179
01:48:56,152 --> 01:48:57,414
Dia!

1180
01:49:12,168 --> 01:49:13,465
I'm coming!

1181
01:49:17,006 --> 01:49:18,667
- Dia!
- Bastard!

1182
01:49:41,831 --> 01:49:43,196
No!

1183
01:50:03,286 --> 01:50:04,617
Dia!

1184
01:51:10,853 --> 01:51:13,788
- We found his digger, sir.
- Keep him close.

1185
01:51:15,758 --> 01:51:17,953
- Danny boy.
- Colonel.

1186
01:51:18,127 --> 01:51:21,494
- Thanks for calling it in.
- Yeah, yeah. Always happy to help, huh?

1187
01:51:21,664 --> 01:51:24,997
So where is it? The stone?

1188
01:51:25,167 --> 01:51:27,101
We split, huh? Fifty-fifty, all right?

1189
01:51:27,269 --> 01:51:28,896
Look around you, Danny boy.

1190
01:51:29,071 --> 01:51:32,040
You're not in a position
to be dictating terms.

1191
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:34,301
Then you will never find it, sir.

1192
01:51:34,477 --> 01:51:36,104
That's correct.

1193
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:40,408
- But he will.
- Come. Up.

1194
01:51:42,051 --> 01:51:44,281
Introduce me to your digger.

1195
01:51:45,855 --> 01:51:47,516
Solomon Vandy.

1196
01:51:47,690 --> 01:51:49,851
This is Colonel Coetzee.
He wants the diamond.

1197
01:51:50,026 --> 01:51:53,052
- No more than you.
- Fuck.

1198
01:51:53,229 --> 01:51:55,220
You gonna show us where it's hidden?

1199
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,595
Does he speak English?

1200
01:51:59,769 --> 01:52:02,795
He will only tell me, sir.
I promise you that.

1201
01:52:03,639 --> 01:52:06,699
- Let me talk to him, huh?
- Go on.

1202
01:52:13,449 --> 01:52:15,815
All right, my friend.

1203
01:52:15,985 --> 01:52:17,919
End of the line here, huh?

1204
01:52:18,087 --> 01:52:21,352
- You just tell him where it is, all right?
- I do not trust him.

1205
01:52:21,524 --> 01:52:24,960
I don't trust him either,
but we haven't got much of a choice here.

1206
01:52:26,662 --> 01:52:29,790
I promise you
he will shoot us both in the head.

1207
01:52:30,232 --> 01:52:32,996
Right, tell him, huh?
Tell him where it is, huh?

1208
01:52:33,169 --> 01:52:35,763
- Go on. Come on.
- I'm not feeling the love, Danny.

1209
01:52:36,972 --> 01:52:39,805
All right.
No more messing about, all right?

1210
01:52:39,975 --> 01:52:42,967
I said tell him where it is!
Tell him where it is! Now!

1211
01:52:43,145 --> 01:52:44,806
Tell him!

1212
01:52:45,981 --> 01:52:47,778
- No.
- Fucking...

1213
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:50,646
Danny, there are other ways
to do this, okay?

1214
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:52,447
Yeah, yeah.

1215
01:53:00,629 --> 01:53:03,621
- Lf he tells us, do we have a deal, sir?
- Seventy-thirty.

1216
01:53:03,799 --> 01:53:06,199
Sixty-forty. I've already lined up a buyer.

1217
01:53:06,368 --> 01:53:08,029
Agreed.

1218
01:53:13,209 --> 01:53:14,767
Come here.

1219
01:53:17,346 --> 01:53:20,782
This is his son. Vandy will do
whatever you want for his sake, all right?

1220
01:53:20,950 --> 01:53:25,717
Danny, you're a pisser, man. Well done.
Boys, we move out.

1221
01:53:28,491 --> 01:53:30,789
What do you say, Mr. Vandy?

1222
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:34,161
- You ready to take a walk?
- Come on.

1223
01:53:40,436 --> 01:53:42,028
Come on.

1224
01:53:54,984 --> 01:53:58,078
So who's the buyer?
I'm guessing London.

1225
01:53:58,287 --> 01:54:01,552
Well, they no longer accept
conflict diamonds, huh?

1226
01:54:01,724 --> 01:54:04,192
Wouldrt hurt to interest
some other parties.

1227
01:54:04,727 --> 01:54:07,719
- Start a bidding war.
- What, one war's not enough for you, huh?

1228
01:54:08,664 --> 01:54:10,359
I missed you, Danny.

1229
01:54:10,666 --> 01:54:14,830
See? It is here.
He has tried to find it.

1230
01:54:15,004 --> 01:54:17,700
All right, Mr. Vandy.
Time for you to start digging.

1231
01:54:32,755 --> 01:54:35,019
Hey, boet, have you got a smoke?

1232
01:54:35,491 --> 01:54:37,391
Smoking will kill you.

1233
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:39,650
Sorry.

1234
01:54:42,731 --> 01:54:44,631
It's all right.

1235
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,927
Time I quit smoking anyway,
huh, Solomon?

1236
01:55:01,450 --> 01:55:02,781
- It's gone.
- What?

1237
01:55:02,952 --> 01:55:05,045
Someone has taken it.

1238
01:55:06,155 --> 01:55:09,921
This is where I buried it.
It isn't here.

1239
01:55:10,392 --> 01:55:13,759
Well, then there's no reason
for any of you to stay alive. Is there?

1240
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:19,761
Wait, wait, wait.

1241
01:55:19,935 --> 01:55:22,165
I know, I know. I know where it is.

1242
01:55:22,638 --> 01:55:24,629
- I know where it is.
- It better be there.

1243
01:55:29,812 --> 01:55:30,801
Yes.

1244
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:34,347
Oh, here, here.
It is here.

1245
01:55:34,516 --> 01:55:36,177
- Yeah? Yeah, there it is.
- Yes.

1246
01:55:37,353 --> 01:55:38,752
Fuck!

1247
01:55:57,406 --> 01:55:59,340
TIA, huh, Danny?

1248
01:56:00,743 --> 01:56:02,335
TIA.

1249
01:56:09,251 --> 01:56:12,709
Keep digging, huh?
They'll be here any second. Come on.

1250
01:56:14,923 --> 01:56:16,185
Keep digging.

1251
01:56:29,038 --> 01:56:31,768
- It had better be there, huh?
- Yes, yes.

1252
01:56:34,810 --> 01:56:36,402
Have you got it?

1253
01:56:37,846 --> 01:56:41,111
- Have you got it, huh?
- Yes, got it. Oh, yes.

1254
01:56:42,551 --> 01:56:43,813
Oh, yes.

1255
01:56:45,988 --> 01:56:47,580
Solomon.

1256
01:56:54,396 --> 01:56:57,365
Dia, what are you doing?

1257
01:56:57,866 --> 01:56:59,356
Dia.

1258
01:57:01,704 --> 01:57:03,604
What are you doing?

1259
01:57:08,477 --> 01:57:09,774
Of the proud Mende tribe.

1260
01:57:15,718 --> 01:57:20,587
You are a good boy
who loves soccer and school.

1261
01:57:22,891 --> 01:57:26,019
Your mother loves you so much.

1262
01:57:28,464 --> 01:57:31,262
She waits by the fire making plantains...

1263
01:57:31,433 --> 01:57:34,095
...and red palm oil stew
with your sister N'Yanda...

1264
01:57:36,372 --> 01:57:38,636
...and the new baby.

1265
01:57:47,549 --> 01:57:49,813
The cows wait for you.

1266
01:57:49,985 --> 01:57:55,787
And Babu, the wild dog
who minds no one but you.

1267
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:01,693
I know they made you do bad things...

1268
01:58:01,864 --> 01:58:04,332
...but you are not a bad boy.

1269
01:58:07,536 --> 01:58:09,936
I am your father...

1270
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:13,938
...who loves you.

1271
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:18,976
And you will come home with me
and be my son again.

1272
01:58:44,406 --> 01:58:46,772
Solomon, we've got to move, huh?

1273
01:58:46,942 --> 01:58:48,500
We've got to...

1274
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:54,376
Go, go! Move!

1275
01:58:57,152 --> 01:58:58,710
Move. Move.

1276
01:58:58,887 --> 01:59:00,184
Move, move, move!

1277
01:59:00,355 --> 01:59:03,381
Move! Move! Move!

1278
01:59:04,993 --> 01:59:06,221
How far?

1279
01:59:06,395 --> 01:59:08,454
There's an airstrip
at the top of that gorge.

1280
01:59:08,630 --> 01:59:10,723
A plane will meet us, huh?

1281
01:59:11,133 --> 01:59:13,499
Hey, stop. Stop.

1282
01:59:15,771 --> 01:59:19,764
Give it to me.
Come on, give it to me, huh?

1283
01:59:27,282 --> 01:59:30,342
Keep moving. They'll be tracking us.

1284
01:59:36,658 --> 01:59:38,717
Nabil, where are you?

1285
01:59:39,795 --> 01:59:42,423
I'm nearly there.
Tell me what's happening.

1286
01:59:42,598 --> 01:59:46,056
We're about 10 K's out, huh?
We've got it, my friend.

1287
01:59:46,235 --> 01:59:48,135
- Who is we?
- The fisherman and his son.

1288
01:59:48,303 --> 01:59:49,895
Lose them.

1289
02:00:04,052 --> 02:00:06,145
It's at the top of that ridge there, huh?

1290
02:00:06,321 --> 02:00:07,618
You must stop and rest.

1291
02:00:07,789 --> 02:00:10,622
What? And give up the damn stone?

1292
02:00:10,792 --> 02:00:12,851
Keep moving. Come on.

1293
02:00:47,496 --> 02:00:49,828
Come. Come, come.

1294
02:01:36,945 --> 02:01:39,243
I can't. Stop.

1295
02:01:39,414 --> 02:01:41,473
- Okay.
- Stop.

1296
02:02:09,945 --> 02:02:11,037
Come on.

1297
02:02:11,647 --> 02:02:14,241
No! God, no. Stop.

1298
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:18,683
Christ. No more. No more.

1299
02:03:02,631 --> 02:03:04,326
Take it, huh?

1300
02:03:06,735 --> 02:03:09,932
- Mr. Archer...
- Take it, take it.

1301
02:03:17,012 --> 02:03:18,775
I thought you would steal it from me.

1302
02:03:20,615 --> 02:03:24,244
Yeah, yeah, it occurred to me, huh?

1303
02:03:35,197 --> 02:03:36,824
Listen...

1304
02:03:39,801 --> 02:03:42,201
...this is Maddy's card, huh?

1305
02:03:42,370 --> 02:03:44,531
You call her when
you get to Conakry, all right?

1306
02:03:48,777 --> 02:03:50,745
And don't trust that pilot for a second.

1307
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:53,972
You point this at his head
if he fucks around, all right?

1308
02:03:54,149 --> 02:03:55,616
I can carry you.

1309
02:04:08,530 --> 02:04:09,997
You take your boy home, huh?

1310
02:04:15,170 --> 02:04:17,832
You take him home, huh?

1311
02:04:22,377 --> 02:04:24,140
- Go! Go!
- Go. Come on.

1312
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:26,072
Go on!

1313
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:33,685
Come on. Come on.

1314
02:04:40,495 --> 02:04:42,861
Archer, you're a dead man!

1315
02:04:43,031 --> 02:04:44,862
Yeah, yeah.

1316
02:05:15,564 --> 02:05:16,929
Dia.

1317
02:05:38,153 --> 02:05:39,313
Hello. Maddy Bowen.

1318
02:05:39,554 --> 02:05:41,385
Yeah.

1319
02:05:41,723 --> 02:05:43,384
Thought I'd never call, huh?

1320
02:05:44,292 --> 02:05:48,353
And I'm so glad you did.
Excuse me.

1321
02:05:50,332 --> 02:05:51,492
When am I gonna see you?

1322
02:05:52,634 --> 02:05:58,368
Maddy, I want you to do me
one more favor, huh?

1323
02:05:59,074 --> 02:06:03,602
I want you to go meet Solomon
in Conakry.

1324
02:06:03,812 --> 02:06:06,508
In Guinea?
Why do you want me to go to Guinea?

1325
02:06:09,517 --> 02:06:11,576
We found his son...

1326
02:06:12,554 --> 02:06:15,955
...but he's gonna need some help,
you understand?

1327
02:06:16,725 --> 02:06:17,817
Maddy?

1328
02:06:20,629 --> 02:06:22,494
You're hurt.

1329
02:06:23,131 --> 02:06:24,189
Are you hurt?

1330
02:06:24,366 --> 02:06:27,529
Yeah, well, I've got
a little problem here.

1331
02:06:32,107 --> 02:06:35,804
Okay. You...
You tell me where you are.

1332
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:40,104
Archer?

1333
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:56,993
I'm looking at an incredible view
right now.

1334
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:00,027
I wish you were here, Maddy.

1335
02:07:00,201 --> 02:07:03,864
Okay, then I'm coming to be with you.
You just tell me where you are.

1336
02:07:07,075 --> 02:07:08,406
I don't think so.

1337
02:07:08,576 --> 02:07:11,909
Are you still in Kono? Because I can
get someone there to help you.

1338
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:16,346
Maddy, you find someplace safe
for the boy, all right?

1339
02:07:16,518 --> 02:07:18,918
And keep him out of sight.

1340
02:07:19,521 --> 02:07:22,251
And get Solomon to London.

1341
02:07:25,393 --> 02:07:28,157
He's bringing something with him.

1342
02:07:28,830 --> 02:07:30,764
But he's gonna need your help.

1343
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,831
Why aren't you bringing it yourself?

1344
02:07:35,337 --> 02:07:40,400
I'm saying it's a real story now.

1345
02:07:41,309 --> 02:07:43,038
And you can write the hell out of it.

1346
02:07:50,251 --> 02:07:52,776
I'm really happy I met you.

1347
02:07:54,356 --> 02:07:55,345
You know that?

1348
02:07:58,693 --> 02:08:00,820
Yeah, I'm...

1349
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:05,090
I'm really happy I met you too.

1350
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:09,693
And I wish I could be there with you.

1351
02:08:10,572 --> 02:08:12,540
That's all right.

1352
02:08:15,076 --> 02:08:17,476
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1353
02:09:11,099 --> 02:09:13,431
When we get to the stairs,
you just keep walking...

1354
02:09:13,601 --> 02:09:15,626
...and I'll wait for you here.

1355
02:09:16,204 --> 02:09:17,728
You're not coming.

1356
02:09:17,906 --> 02:09:21,171
I'm not here. Good luck.

1357
02:09:42,831 --> 02:09:45,493
You must understand, Mr. Vandy...

1358
02:09:45,667 --> 02:09:51,731
...that your diamond could have ended up
nowhere else but with us.

1359
02:09:55,043 --> 02:09:58,012
- It is not enough.
- I assure you, 2 million pounds...

1360
02:09:58,179 --> 02:10:02,047
...is more than anyone else will offer you
for that stone under the circumstances.

1361
02:10:02,217 --> 02:10:04,913
I want what was promised to me
by Mr. Archer.

1362
02:10:08,389 --> 02:10:10,914
- What was promised to you?
- My family.

1363
02:10:11,259 --> 02:10:13,250
When they are here,
you will get the stone.

1364
02:10:13,928 --> 02:10:15,555
I will have the money too.

1365
02:10:16,865 --> 02:10:18,389
Well, may I see what I'm buying?

1366
02:10:18,566 --> 02:10:21,330
You will get the stone
once my family is here.

1367
02:10:22,103 --> 02:10:23,900
How do I even know you've got it?

1368
02:12:31,799 --> 02:12:34,563
Can you comment on the diamonds
mined in Sierra Leone?

1369
02:12:34,736 --> 02:12:38,638
I'm not going to comment
on some sensationalist magazine article.

1370
02:12:38,806 --> 02:12:41,400
- What about Liberia?
- No comment. No comment.

1371
02:12:41,576 --> 02:12:43,976
- Mr. Van De Kaap...
- That's all I have to say.

1372
02:12:44,145 --> 02:12:45,544
The natural resources
of a country...

1373
02:12:47,548 --> 02:12:50,517
...are the property of its people.
They are not ours to steal...

1374
02:12:51,853 --> 02:12:57,314
...or exploit in the name of our comfort,
our corporations, or our consumerism.

1375
02:13:07,235 --> 02:13:09,294
They're ready for you, sir.

1376
02:13:10,805 --> 02:13:13,205
The Third World is not a world apart.

1377
02:13:13,374 --> 02:13:18,038
And the witness you will hear today
speaks on its behalf.

1378
02:13:18,212 --> 02:13:22,080
Let us hear the voice of that world.
Let us learn from that voice.

1379
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:25,777
And let us ignore it no more.

1380
02:13:25,953 --> 02:13:29,286
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Solomon Vandy.

1381
02:23:17,544 --> 02:23:19,535
