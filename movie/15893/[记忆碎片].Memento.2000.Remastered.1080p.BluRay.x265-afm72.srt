1
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,770
片名：记忆碎片

2
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,450
我在哪里？某间旅馆房内
So where are you? You're in some motel room.

3
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,660
一觉醒来  发觉自己在旅馆房内
You just wake up, and you're in a motel room.

4
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,080
钥匙在这里  似乎刚刚住进来
There's the key. It feels like maybe it'sjust the first time you've been there...

5
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,750
但…又似乎住了一个星期
but... perhaps you've been there for a week...

6
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,380
甚至三个月
three months.

7
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,670
很难说  我不知道
It's kind of hard to say. I don't know.

8
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,210
只是间普通的房间
It's just an anonymous room.

9
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,380
这个人…
This guy.

10
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,720
他已经来了
He's here already.

11
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,810
莱尼
Lenny!

12
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,270
是莱纳
It's Leonard...

13
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,020
我告诉过你
like I told you before.

14
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,700
是吗？我一定是忘了
Did you? I must have forgot.

15
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,980
我大概提到过我的病
I guess I've already told you about my condition.

16
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,150
每次见面都提
Only every time I see you.

17
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,790
- 我的车   - 这是你的车
- My car.      - This is your car.

18
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,920
想耍我
You're in a playful mood.

19
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,290
你不应该捉弄有缺陷的人
It's not good to make fun of someone's handicap.

20
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,130
只是开开玩笑
Just trying to have a little fun.

21
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
绞起玻璃窗
Roll up your window.

22
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,250
- 是破的   - 我可以修理
- It's broken.      - I can get that fixed foryou.

23
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,690
- 你想去哪？福尔摩斯先生？ - 我要去一个地方
- So where to, Sherlock?        - I got a lead on a place.

24
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,700
你去那里到底想搞什么名堂？
What the hell you wanna go there for?

25
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,160
- 你认识这地方？  - 只是间破屋子
- You know it?      - Yeah. It'sjust this fucked-up building.

26
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,530
- 为什么要去？ - 想不起来了
- Why do you wanna go there?      - Don't remember.

27
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,890
- 似乎有人   - 车已经停了好几年了
- Looks like somebody's home.      - That thing's been here for years.

28
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,690
路上的痕迹是新的
What are you talking about? These tracks are only a few days old.

29
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,440
你懂得认痕迹？
Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?

30
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,490
来吧
Come on!

31
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,330
进去看看
Let's take a look inside.

32
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,470
泰迪
"Teddy."

33
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,480
不要受他骗  是他  杀了他
"Don't believe his lies. He is the one. Kill him."

34
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,820
我终于找到他了  我找了多久？
I finally found him. How long have I been looking?

35
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,360
找到什么了吗？
Find anything?

36
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,570
大概没有
Didn't think so.

37
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,030
我们走吧
Let's go.

38
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,950
算了
Fuck this.

39
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,910
杀人偿命
You're gonna pay for what you did.

40
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,040
- 一命还一命   - 莱纳
- Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.      - Leonard.

41
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,170
神经病  你搞错了
You don't have a clue, you freak.

42
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,550
先向我太太认错  然后受死
Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out.

43
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,600
莱纳  你真是糊里糊涂的
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

44
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,140
- 知道我叫什么吗？ - 泰迪
- You don't even know my name.      - Teddy.

45
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,390
你靠照片才知道
That's 'cause you read it off a fucking picture.

46
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,770
你不知道自已是谁
You don't know who you are.

47
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,480
我叫莱纳•谢尔比  旧金山人
I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco.

48
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,400
那是以前的你  不是现在的你
That's who you were. That's not what you've become.

49
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,990
- 住口    - 你想知道吗？
- Shut your mouth.      - You want to know, Lenny?

50
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,370
来
Come on.

51
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,240
我们到地下室去
Come on. Let's go down to the basement.

52
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,330
我们一起下去
Let's go down, you and me, together.

53
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,410
你会知道自己真正是谁
Then you'll know who you really are.

54
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,920
不
No!

55
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,470
只是间普通的房子
It'sjust an anonymous room.

56
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,550
抽屉空空如也  只管打开看看
There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway.

57
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,060
只有本基甸社送的圣经  我当然诚心阅读了
Nothing except the Gideon Bible, which I, of course, read religiously.

58
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,150
你知道自己是谁  对自己的身份有点印象
You know who you are, and you know kind of all about yourself.

59
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,820
至于过日常生活  字条十分有用
Butjust for day-to-day stuff, notes are really useful.

60
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,610
萨米•杰克斯也靠字条
Sammy Jankis had the same problem...

61
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,660
不过他缺乏条理
but he really had no system.

62
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,120
他拼命写字条
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes...

63
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,120
却乱放一通
but he'd get them all mixed up.

64
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,960
要有效果  就要有条理
You really do need a system if you're gonna make it work.

65
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,210
"不要受他的骗"

66
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,190
"他是凶手  杀了他"

67
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,260
- 嘿    - 嘿
- Hi.      - Hi.

68
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,200
- 我是304号房的住客  - 有什么可以效劳的  莱纳？
- I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.      - What can I do for you, Leonard?

69
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,560
我叫波特
Burt.

70
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,980
波特  我可能说过  我不接电话
Burt. I'm not sure. I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.

71
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,900
- 你不记得？ - 我不习惯讲电话
- You don't know?      - I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.

72
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,650
对  你喜欢面谈
Right. You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them.

73
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,160
对
Yeah.

74
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,870
你不记得说过？
You don't remember saying that?

75
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,200
- 我有种病   - 病？
- That's the thing. I have this condition.      - A condition?

76
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,660
- 我的记忆   - 失忆？
- It's my memory.      - Amnesia?

77
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,540
不是  我没有短期记忆
No, no. It's different from that. I have no short-term memory.

78
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,590
我知道自己是谁  不过…
I know who I am. I know all about myself.

79
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,130
自从受了伤  我没有新记忆  什么都记不住
Since my injury, I can't make new memories. Everything fades.

80
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,430
我会忘记为什么跟你谈
If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started.

81
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,220
我会忘记跟你谈过
Next time I see you, I'm not gonna remember this conversation.

82
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,890
我甚至记不得见过你
I don't even know if I've met you before.

83
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,060
假如我行动古怪  无礼…
So, if I seem a little strange or rude or something...

84
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,110
我都说过  是不是？
I've told you this before, haven't I?

85
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,280
是  确实太奇怪了
Yeah. I don't mean to mess with you, but it's so weird.

86
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,570
- 你完全记不得我？ - 记不得
- You don't remember me at all?      - No.

87
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,490
- 可是我们经常交谈    - 可以肯定
- We've talked a bunch of times.      - I'm sure we have.

88
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,620
你最后记得的是什么？
What's the last thing you remember?

89
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,200
我太太
My wife.

90
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,080
是怎样的？
What's it like?

91
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,260
像是刚刚醒来
It's like waking. It's like you just woke up.

92
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,550
一定很不爽
That must suck.

93
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,960
全部都调转过来
It's all backwards.

94
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,100
你或许知道要做什么  可是记不得做过什么
Maybe you get an idea what you want to do next, but you don't remember what you just did.

95
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,520
- 我却刚刚相反   - 我在这里住了多久？
- I'm exactly the opposite...      - How long have I been staying here?

96
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,650
- 几天   - 而你替我阻挡来电？
- Couple of days.      - And you're holding my calls?

97
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,840
- 就像你吩咐的   - 除了这个人
- Like you said.      - Okay, but this guy's an exception.

98
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,410
- 认识他吗？ - 他是你的朋友
- You know this guy?      - Yeah, it's your friend, right?

99
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,570
你怎么知道？
What makes you think he's my friend?

100
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,620
- 我见过你们在一起   - 他不是我的朋友
- I just saw you together, that's all.      - He's not my friend.

101
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,540
- 那好吧   - 假如他打电话来…
- Okay.      - If he calls or if he shows up here...

102
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,420
或者亲自来  通知我
give me a call in my room, okay?

103
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,080
他叫泰迪？
His name's Teddy?

104
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,130
- 泰迪  对了   - 好的
- Teddy, yeah.      - All right.

105
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,380
我希望没有给你添麻烦
Look, I hope my condition's not gonna be a problem for you.

106
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,720
只要你记得结账就行
No, not as long as you remember to pay the bill.

107
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,930
好的
Yeah. Okay.

108
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,310
- 40块    - 40块
- Forty.      - Forty.

109
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,060
那个人…
This guy...

110
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,850
已经来了
He's here already.

111
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,980
莱尼
Lenny!

112
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,440
"剃"

113
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,240
要有效  就要有条理
You really need a system if you're gonna make it work.

114
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,360
要相信自己的笔迹
You kind of learn to trust your own handwriting.

115
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,490
那是日常生活的重要部分  你为自己写备忘字条
That becomes an important part of your life. You write yourself notes.

116
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,910
放字条的地方...也很重要
Where you put your notes... That also becomes important.

117
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,580
外衣要有六个口袋
You need a jacket that's got like six pockets in it.

118
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,880
各个口袋有各自的功能
Particular pockets for particular things.

119
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,800
要养成井井有条的习惯
You just kind of learn to know where things go and how the system works.

120
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,930
要防范别人故意混淆你
And you have to be wary of other people writing stuff for you that is not gonna make sense...

121
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,970
替你乱写字条
or is gonna lead you astray.

122
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,350
世上总有那种人
I don't know. I guess people try and take advantage of somebody with this condition.

123
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,520
如果你把把关键的资料…
If you have a piece of information which is vital...

124
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,020
纹在身上  是个能行得通的办法
writing on your body instead of on a piece of paper can be the answer.

125
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,400
可以永久备忘
It's just a permanent way of keeping a note.

126
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,370
哪位？
Who is this?

127
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,050
"记住萨米•杰克斯"
"Remember Sammy Jankis."

128
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,370
"事实…"

129
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,990
先生  你忘记拿走这个了
Excuse me, sir. You left these at your table.

130
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,790
谢谢
Thanks.

131
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,620
林肯街怎么走？
Lincoln Street?

132
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,830
沿第六街一直向东走
Go straight out on Sixth Street. Go east all the way...

133
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,130
- 等一下  我要写下来   - 很容易  只是直走
- Hold on. I'm gonna write this down.      - It's easy. Just go straight...

134
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,670
我的确需要写下来
Trust me. I need to write this down.

135
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,180
"特惠旅馆"
"The Discount Inn."

136
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
特惠旅馆
Discount Inn.

137
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,790
娜塔莉娅
Natalie.

138
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,570
我的车
My car.

139
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,970
泰迪
Teddy.

140
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,470
"莱纳收"   "娜塔莉娅寄"

141
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,210
约翰•爱德华•盖玛
"John Edward Gammell."

142
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,490
他自称泰迪
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

143
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,370
"不要受他骗"
"Don't believe his lies."

144
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,800
- 喂？ - 盖玛先生？
- Yeah?      - Mr. Gammell?

145
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,760
- 莱尼  是你吗？ - 你是约翰•盖玛？
- Lenny, is that you?      - John Gammell?

146
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,260
是泰迪啊  不要走开  我马上来
Lenny, it's Teddy. Stay there. I'll be right over.

147
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,770
好的  我等你
Okay. I'll be waiting.

148
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,730
"照片  房子  车  朋友 敌人"

149
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,380
"提防自己的弱点"

150
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,170
"相信事实"

151
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,110
"记忆误人"

152
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,610
"事实1：男人"    "事实2：白种"

153
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,660
白种男人
"White. Male."

154
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,250
名叫约翰…
"First name: John."

155
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,250
姓盖玛…
"Last name: G" for Gammell.

156
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,710
"事实5：毒贩"    "事实6：车牌 SG1371U"

157
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,430
毒贩  车牌
"Drugs. License plate."

158
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,430
"SG13...

00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,350

160
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,990
"车牌 SG1371U"

161
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,440
是他
It's him.

162
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,370
"泰迪"

163
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,010
终于找到了你这个贱人
I found you, you fuck.

164
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:24,810
"不要受他骗  是他"

165
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:47,700
"约翰•G奸杀我妻子"

166
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,090
"杀了他"

167
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,010
我记不得跟你谈过
You said we talked before. I don't remember that.

168
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,600
不是失忆症  我只是记不得受伤以后的事
Yeah, but it's not amnesia. I remember everything up until my injury.

169
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,390
我没有新记忆  所以我不记得和你谈过
I just can't make new memories. So I can't remember talking to you.

170
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,440
我们谈了萨米•杰克斯？
What did we talk about? Oh, Sammy Jankis.

171
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,860
因为萨米•杰克斯和我…
I guess I tell people about Sammy to help them understand.

172
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,690
都有短期失忆
Sammy's story helps me understand my own situation.

173
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,510
萨米为自己写备忘字条  不过他乱放字条
Sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.

174
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,370
我的方法更有效
I have a more graceful solution to the memory problem.

175
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,170
我有条不紊
I'm disciplined and organized.

176
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,790
所以能够应付日常生活
I use habit and routine to make my life possible.

177
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,210
萨米没有推动力去帮自己记忆
Sammy had no drive, no reason to make it work.

178
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,290
我呢？我有推动力
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.

179
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,160
"今午一点见娜塔莉娅取消息"
"Today, 1:00 p.m. Meet Natalie for info."

180
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,830
"她也失去爱人"
"She has also lost someone."

181
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,330
"会同情你  帮你"
"She will help you out of pity."

182
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,060
- 你是娜塔莉娅？ - 你不记得我
- Natalie?      - You don't remember me.

183
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,060
- 对不起  我应该解释  我有…   - 你解释过  莱尼
- Sorry. I should have explained. I have this...      - You did explain, Lenny.

184
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,520
请叫我莱纳  我太太叫我莱尼
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.

185
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,190
- 我知道  你说过   - 可能也说过讨厌被人叫莱尼
- Yeah, I know. You told me.      - Then I probably told you how much I hated it.

186
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,690
是的
Yeah.

187
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,200
可以取下墨镜吗？
Do you mind taking your glasses off? It's hard for me to...

188
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,240
谢谢  你有消息给我？
Thanks. So you have information for me?

189
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,080
- 你的字条那样写？ - 对
- Is that what your little note says?      - Yeah.

190
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,040
单靠字条生活  一定很辛苦
Must be tough living your life according to a couple of scraps of paper.

191
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,920
洗衣单和杂货单调乱
You mix your laundry list with your grocery list...

192
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,170
那就麻烦了
and you'll end up eating your underwear for breakfast.

193
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,010
所以你甚至把备忘纹在身上
I guess that's why you have those freaky tattoos.

194
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,260
日子确实不好过
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

195
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,910
记不得你  对不起  不要见怪
I'm sorry I don't rememberyou. It's nothing personal.

196
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,960
我的确有消息给你
I do have information for you.

197
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,230
你给我个车牌
You gave me a license plate number.

198
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,530
我去交通部查过
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

199
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,470
猜猜是谁的
Guess what name came up.

200
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,660
约翰•爱德华•盖玛   约翰•G
John Edward Gammell. John G.

201
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,370
- 你认识他？ - 不
- Do you know him?      - No.

202
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,540
不过照片上的人看起来很熟悉
But his face on his driver's license looked really familiar.

203
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
他可能来过酒吧
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

204
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,710
这是他的车牌和照片副本
Here's a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all.

205
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,300
你真的要这样做？
Are you sure you want this?

206
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,170
- 我有没有说过他做过什么？ - 有
- Have I told you what this man did?      - Yeah.

207
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,010
那你就不用问了
Then you shouldn't have to ask.

208
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,800
不过  你即使报了仇...
But even if you get revenge, you're not gonna remember it.

209
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,970
你也不会记得
You're not even gonna know that it happened.

210
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,390
妻子的仇不可不报  记不记得无所谓
My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make any difference whether I know about it.

211
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,730
即使记不得  依然值得做
Just because there are things I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless.

212
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,780
即使闭上眼睛  世界并没有消失
The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?

213
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,490
我可以拍张照片来提醒自已
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself...

214
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,240
或者再纹个备忘录在身上
get another freaky tattoo.

215
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,120
再说说她的事吧
Tell me about her again.

216
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,710
为什么？
Why?

217
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,710
因为你喜欢记起她
Because you like to remember her.

218
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,380
她漂亮
She was beautiful.

219
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,010
- 对我来说  她是完美的  - 不要顺口说
- To me, she was perfect.      - No. Don't just recite the words.

220
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,060
闭上眼睛去回忆她
Close your eyes... and remember her.

221
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,140
我可以感受到细节
You can just feel the details.

222
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,950
一些平时懒得回忆的细节
The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.

223
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,960
那些非常时刻…
And you can feel these extreme moments...

224
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,460
重现眼前
even if you don't want to.

225
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,630
印象愈发清晰
You put these together, and you get the feel of a person.

226
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,140
我更加怀念她
Enough to know how much you miss them...

227
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,650
也更加痛恨凶手
and how much you hate the person who took them away.

228
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,660
我写了个地址在上面
I added an address in here.

229
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,210
也许有用  是近郊的一间荒屋
It might be useful. It's an abandoned place outside of town.

230
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,210
我的朋友曾经在那里贩毒
A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.

231
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,340
四周没有人
It's isolated.

232
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,340
好极了
Sounds perfect.

233
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,310
- 我应不应该付你…  - 不用  我不是为钱
- Do I owe you any...      - I wasn't helping you for money.

234
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,600
- 对不起  - 没关系
- I'm sorry.      - It's okay.

235
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,810
我知道你有病
See, you have this condition.

236
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,820
还住在优惠旅馆？你落在我家里的
Are you still staying at the Discount Inn, room 304? You left it at my place.

237
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,820
嗯
Yeah.

238
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,490
- 旅馆招待好吗？ - 我记不得了
- They treating you okay?      - I don't remember.

239
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,870
你和我有个共同点
You know what we have in common?

240
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,840
我们都懂得生存
We are both survivors.

241
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,260
保重  莱纳
You take care, Leonard.

242
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,870
"记住萨米•杰克斯"
"Remember Sammy Jankis."

243
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,750
我本来在保险公司工作
I met Sammy through work. Insurance. I was an investigator.

244
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,710
负责调查保险索赔
I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phony.

245
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,880
专长是辨别真与假
I had to see through people's bullshit.

246
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,760
这专长现在派上了大用场
It was useful experience, 'cause now it's my life.

247
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,680
现在我靠观察去辨认…
When I meet someone, I don't know if I've met them before.

248
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,680
眼前的人是不是相识的
I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.

249
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,060
我知道观言辨色…
My job taught me the best way to find out what someone knew was just let them talk...

250
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,520
是了解人的最好办法
and watch the eyes and the body language.

251
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,190
譬如  一个人一边谈话一边擦鼻子…
If someone scratches their nose while they're talking, experts tell you it means they're lying.

252
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,780
那个人可能在说谎或者紧张  紧张的原因很多
It really means they're nervous. People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.

253
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,070
视乎情形而定
It's all about context.

254
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,030
对  我是观人高手
Yeah, I was good.

255
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,120
第一个观察的人是萨米
Sammy was my first real challenge.

256
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,170
莱尼  还以为你离开了本地
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.

257
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,550
- 情况有变    - 看得出来
- Things change.         - So I see.

258
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,720
- 我叫泰迪  - 我大概提到过我的病
- My name's Teddy.      - I guess I've told you about my condition.

259
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,300
每次见面都提  来  我请你吃午餐
Only every time I see you. Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

260
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,690
- 我有没有提过萨米•杰克斯？ - 有
- Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?      - Yeah.

261
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,320
我听得好厌  约翰•G呢？你认为他还在？
I'm sick of hearing about the guy. What about John G? You think he's still here?

262
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,650
- 谁？ - 约翰•G  你要找的人
- Who?      - Johnny G, the guy you're looking for.

263
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,320
- 你为了找他  才留在本地？ - 也许吧
- That's why you haven't left town, am I right?      - Maybe.

264
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,700
- 莱纳  你非小心不可   - 为什么？
- Leonard, look. You have to be very careful.      - Why?

265
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,200
你提过有人想误导你…
The other day you mentioned that maybe somebody was trying to set you up...

266
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,040
让你杀错人
get you to kill the wrong guy.

267
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,210
我会凭事实去判断
I go on facts, not recommendations, but thank you.

268
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,340
怎能凭字条、照片去决定杀谁？
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.

269
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,220
- 为什么不能？ - 因为字条未必可靠
- Why not?      - Because your notes could be unreliable.

270
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,970
- 记忆也未必可靠    - 拜托
- Memory's unreliable.      - Oh, please!

271
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,390
记忆不准确  甚至不合用
No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good.

272
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,010
问问警察吧  目击证供未必可靠
Ask the police. Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

273
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,060
警察不是凭记忆缉凶
The cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff.

274
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,940
警察搜集事实  做笔记  然后作出结论
They collect facts, they make notes, and they draw conclusions.

275
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,060
凭事实  不是凭记忆
Facts, not memories.

276
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,610
我以前是调查员  所以知道
That's how you investigate. I know. It's what I used to do.

277
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,900
形状、颜色等细节  未必记得准
Memory can change the shape of a room. It can change the color of a car.

278
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,070
可以记错
And memories can be distorted.

279
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,330
记忆只是一种演绎  不是纪录
They're just an interpretation. They're not a record.

280
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,990
掌握事实  就不用靠记忆
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

281
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,290
你非报仇不可？
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

282
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,170
他杀死我的妻子  夺去我的记忆
He killed my wife. He took away my fucking memory.

283
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,090
毁灭我生存的能力
He destroyed my ability to live.

284
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,510
你还活着
You're living.

285
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,810
完全为了报仇
Only for revenge.

286
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,220
那么我们把这坏蛋找出来  你住在哪里？
Then we'll get the bastard. Where you staying?

287
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,270
特惠旅馆
The Discount Inn.

288
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,820
我不知道是哪间房  我没有钥匙
I don't know what room. I haven't got my key.

289
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,730
可能落在了房里
Probably left it in your room.

290
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,990
我是房客  不见了钥匙
Hi. I'm checked in here, but I think I've misplaced my key.

291
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,630
你好  莱纳  可能在房里
How you doing, Leonard? Probably in the room, right?

292
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,900
- 我的钥匙呢？ - 糟糕
- Don't see my key anywhere.      - Shit.

293
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,070
进错房间了  你现在住304号房
This is the wrong room. You're in 304 now.

294
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
- 对不起  我搞错了  - 这不是我的房间？
- I'm sorry. I fucked up.      - This is not my room?

295
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,740
不是  我们走吧
No. Let's go.

296
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,830
为什么有我的笔迹？
Why is this my handwriting?

297
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,790
以前是  现在你住304
This was your room, but now you're in 304.

298
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,130
- 我什么时候住过这间？ - 上个星期
- When was I in here?      - Last week.

299
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,670
不过我再多租你一间
But then I rented you another room on top of it.

300
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,880
- 为什么？ - 生意冷淡
- Why?      - Business is slow.

301
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,840
…你既然有这种病…
I told my boss about your condition and stuff...

302
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,140
我们于是多租一间给你
and he said, "Try and rent him another room."

303
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,270
我究竟租了几间？
How many rooms am I checked into in this shit-hole?

304
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,810
只是两间  到目前为止
Just two, so far.

305
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,560
起码你坦白承认占我便宜
At least you're being honest about ripping me off.

306
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,190
你反正不会记得
You're not gonna remember anyway.

307
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,190
用不着那样坦白
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

308
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,910
莱纳  每次都应该取收条
Leonard, always get a receipt.

309
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,200
我会记下来
Yeah. I'm gonna write that down.

310
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,650
"今午一点见娜塔莉娅取消息"

311
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,250
- 现在几点了？ - 12点45分
- What time is it?      - Quarter to 1:00.

312
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,500
你房间的…
Your room's...

313
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,350
- 娜塔莉娅    - 你记不得我
- Natalie?      - You don't remember me.

314
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,600
萨米•杰克斯的保险索赔十分奇特
I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.

315
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,400
是我接手的第一宗案子
Mr. Samuel R. Jankis. Strangest case ever.

316
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,280
萨米58岁  半退休会计师
You know, the guy's a 58-year-old semiretired accountant.

317
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,030
遇到交通意外  本来不算严重
He and his wife had been in this car accident. Nothing too serious.

318
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,820
奇怪的是  他记不住东西
But he's acting funny. He can't get a handle on what's going on.

319
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,580
医生怀疑脑部受伤
The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus.

320
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,210
但无法证实萨米的记忆只有几分钟
Nothing conclusive, but Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.

321
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,040
于是什么都不能做  医药费昂贵
Can't work, can't do shit. The medical bills pile up.

322
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,840
他的妻子通知了保险公司  公司派我调查
His wife calls the insurance company, and I get sent in.

323
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,800
我初次查案  于是查得格外认真
Now, this is my first big claims investigation, so I really check into it.

324
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:26,100
萨米思考没问题  不过他没有新记忆
Sammy can think just fine, but he can't make any new memories.

325
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,520
只记得几分钟内的事
He could only remember things for a couple of minutes.

326
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,310
- 这位是莱纳先生   - 他看电视...
- This is Mr. Shelby.    - He'd watch TV...

327
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,730
但过目就忘
but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing.

328
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,650
记得后面的  却忘了前面的  他喜欢看广告  因为广告简短
He couldn't remember how it began. He liked commercials. They were short.

329
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,820
萨米  到时间打针了
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

330
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,780
不可思议的是…
The crazy part was that this guy...

331
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,070
这个连电视也没法看的人…
who couldn't even follow the plot of Green Acres anymore...

332
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,240
却能够做复杂的事
could do the most complicated things...

333
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,320
"胰岛素"

334
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,710
只要意外前学会的…
as long as he learned them before the accident...

335
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,290
专心去做就行
and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.

336
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,130
轻点
Be gentle.

337
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,510
医生说有一种罕见的病叫"杆脉失忆"
The doctors assure me there's a real condition called anterograde memory loss...

338
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,550
也就是短期失忆
or short-term memory loss.

339
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,640
很罕见  但确实有
It's rare, but legit.

340
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,390
不过  我每次见到他…
But every time I see him...

341
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,140
从他的眼神察觉到…
I catch this look...

342
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,810
他好像有点认得我
this slight look of recognition.

343
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,730
他却自称一点都认不得
But he says he can't remember me at all.

344
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,940
萨米  不要紧  我开  我开
Sammy, it's okay. I got it. I got it.

345
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,860
- 你好  莱纳先生   - 你好  杰克斯太太
- Hi, Mr. Shelby.      - Hi, Mrs. Jankis.

346
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,910
我怀疑他在演戏
I can read people, and I'm thinking: Bad actor.

347
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,500
于是要求再做检验
So now I'm suspicious, and I order more tests.

348
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,080
醒来
Awake.

349
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,800
我在哪里？
Where am I?

350
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,430
某人的卧室
Somebody's bedroom.

351
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,100
一定是她的房间
It must be her room.

352
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,220
不过  她是谁？
But who is she?

353
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,440
只是我
It's only me.

354
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,660
- 睡得好吗？ - 好  你呢？
- Did you sleep okay?      - Yeah. You?

355
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,120
糟糕  我有地方要去
Oh, shit. I gotta be someplace.

356
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,630
- 相当怪异   - 这很有用
- It's pretty weird.      - It's useful.

357
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,630
你从不把电话写在手上？
You never write a phone number on your hand?

358
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:28,180
我今天要去交通部查查车牌的事
I should be able to talk to my friend today about the license plate.

359
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,600
- 对  车牌   - 约翰•G的车牌
- Yeah, the license plate.      - John G.'s license plate.

360
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,830
你把车牌纹在你的大腿上
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

361
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,080
娜塔莉娅
"Natalie."

362
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,670
她也失去爱人
"She has also lost someone.

363
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,170
会同情你  帮你
She will help you out of pity."

364
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,850
只要是本州的车牌…
If it's registered in this state...

365
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,930
几秒钟就能查出车主资料
it should only take a couple seconds to pull up his license and registration.

366
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,810
我一有资料就通知你
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

367
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,900
不如现在就约定什么时候见面吧
Do you think we could just arrange a meeting now? I'm not too good on the phone.

368
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:36,080
多谢你这样帮我…
It's great that you that you're helping me like this.

369
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,670
我帮你  因为你帮过我
I'm helping you because you helped me.

370
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,640
那么  下次见面你会记得我吗？
So next time you see me, will you remember me?

371
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,660
我认为你会
I think you will.

372
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

373
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,590
莱尼  可以把衣服还给我吗？
Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?

374
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,310
莱尼  还以为你离开了本地
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.

375
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,770
萨米不能够用一般的方法去学习
Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.

376
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:50,190
不过  我认为他可以用惯性法
But I find something in my research: Conditioning.

377
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,280
重复又重复去学  一定能学会
Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.

378
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,780
就像骑单车一样  熟能生巧
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike. You just get better through practice.

379
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,370
没有短期记忆  也可以学会
It's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory.

380
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,540
我请医生检验萨米对惯性的反应
So I had the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning.

381
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,790
随便拣三件东西
Just pick up any three objects.

382
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,040
这就算检验？
That's a test?

383
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,210
我考会计执照  遇上你们就好了
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

384
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,970
对不起
Sorry.

385
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,760
搞什么？
Ow! What the fuck?

386
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,060
- 是检验  萨米   - 检验你个死人头
- It's a test, Sammy.      - Test this, you fucking quack.

387
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,560
有几样通了电
Some of the objects were electrified.

388
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,020
会让他稍微触电
They'd give him a small shock. They kept repeating the test...

389
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,070
通电的总是相同那几样
always with the same objects electrified.

390
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,740
目的是看看萨米能不能无须记忆…
The point was to see if Sammy could learn to avoid the electrified objects...

391
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,820
单凭本能去避开通电的
not by memory, but by instinct.

392
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,510
娜塔莉娅  是不是？这个该死的达德是谁？
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

393
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,800
达德

394
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,230
- 大概再不用理会他了   - 你给我惹了什么麻烦？
- Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.      - What the fuck have you got me into?

395
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,810
进来吧
Come inside.

396
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,990
- 他是谁？ - 冷静点
- Who is he?      - Calm down. Okay?

397
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,570
这件事你主动帮我  跟你的调查没有关系
This is my problem. You offered to help. It has nothing to do with your investigation.

398
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,160
你给我惹了什么麻烦？
How did you get me into this?

399
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,280
你知道他打伤我  就主动帮我
You offered to help when you saw what he did to my face.

400
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,950
- 我怎么知道他打你？  - 因为我告诉了你
- How do I know he did that to your face?      - Because I came straight to you after he did it.

401
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,290
并请你帮忙
I showed you what he did, and I asked you to help me.

402
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,330
- 而我相信你的一面之词？ - 是
- And I just take your word?      - Yeah.

403
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,710
有些事情不对劲
Something doesn't feel right.

404
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,340
有人愚弄我  想误导我去杀错人
I think someone's fucking with me, trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

405
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,840
- 你有没有？ - 有没有什么？
- Did you?      - What?

406
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,340
- 杀他？ - 当然没有
- Kill him?      - Of course not!

407
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,470
嘿
Hey.

408
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,390
坐下来  好吗？
Sit down, okay? Sit.

409
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,310
这件事跟你无关
This has nothing to do with you.

410
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,770
你帮我  我很感激
You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

411
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,560
要用火烧
You have to burn them.

412
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,150
莱纳  你是自愿帮我的  相信你自己吧
Leonard, you decided to help me. Trust yourself.

413
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
相信自己的判断
Trust your own judgment. You can question everything.

414
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,080
- 你不能什么都怀疑   - 有些事情可以肯定
- You can never know anything for sure.      - There are things you know for sure.

415
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,290
比如呢？
Such as?

416
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,580
我敲一敲会有什么声音
I know what that's gonna sound like when I knock on it.

417
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,670
我捡起来会有什么感觉
I know what that's gonna feel like when I pick it up.

418
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,420
所谓肯定…只是自以为错不了的记忆
See? Certainties. It's the kind of memory you take for granted.

419
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,430
我只有未受伤前的记忆
You know, I can remember so much.

420
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,720
主要是…关于她
The feel of the world... and her.

421
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,150
她已经不在人世
She's gone.

422
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,190
我现在只能靠写字条过日子
And the present is trivia, which I scribble down as fucking notes!

423
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,200
不要焦急  放松
Hey. Come on. Try and relax. Come on.

424
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,620
放松不容易
It's not easy for me to relax, you know?

425
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,370
脱掉外衣吧
Come on. Take your jacket off.

426
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,000
脱吧
Now. Come on.

427
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,540
嘿
Hey.

428
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,420
想不到你是那种人
Didn't think you were the type.

429
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,470
是反转的
It's backwards.

430
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,220
过来
Come here.

431
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,980
过来
Come here.

432
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,920
这里呢？
What about here?

433
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,670
也许等找到他的时候
Maybe it's for when I find him.

434
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,840
我也失去过爱人
I've lost somebody too.

435
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,260
一定很难过
I'm sorry.

436
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,560
他叫杰米
His name was Jimmy.

437
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,680
- 发生了什么事？ - 他去见人
- What happened to him?      - He went to meet somebody.

438
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,730
一去不回
He never came back.

439
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,480
- 见谁？ - 一个叫泰迪的人
- Who did he go to meet?      - A guy called Teddy.

440
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,780
警察找不到他？
What do the police think?

441
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,740
警察不会理会杰米那种人
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.

442
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,370
你找到那个约翰•G…
When you find this guy, this John G...

443
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,410
打算怎样？
what are you gonna do?

444
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,080
我要杀掉他
I'm gonna kill him.

445
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,670
我也许可以帮你找他
Maybe I can help you find him.

446
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,180
我不知道她起床了多久
I don't even know how long she's been gone.

447
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,560
我醒来时  她已经不在
It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here...

448
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,440
大概是上了洗手间吧
because she's gone to the bathroom or something.

449
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,490
不过  总觉得…
But somehow I just...

450
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,530
她不会再回到床上来
I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.

451
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,590
假如我能够伸手过去摸摸她那边的床...
If I could just reach over and touch her side of the bed...

452
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,380
就会知道是冷的
I would know that it was cold.

453
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,510
不过  我不能
But I can't.

454
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,440
我知道她不会再回来
I know I can't have her back.

455
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,150
我不想早上醒来  以为她还在
But I don't want to wake up in the morning thinking she's still here.

456
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:26,070
我独自躺在这里  不知道躺了多久
I lie here not knowing how long I've been alone.

457
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,920
我怎么能够康复？
How can I heal?

458
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,470
感觉不到时间…我怎么能够康复？
How am I supposed to heal if I can't... feel time?

459
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,790
她也失去了爱人
"She has also lost someone.

460
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,330
会同情你  帮你
She will help you out of pity."

461
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,610
他们检验了萨米几个月
They kept testing Sammy for months...

462
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,490
通电的总是相同的几样
always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge.

463
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,330
搞什么鬼？
Ow! What the fuck?

464
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,830
- 是检验  萨米  - 验你个死人头
- It's a test, Sammy.      - Test this, you fucking quack!

465
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,620
萨米即使完全短期失忆…
Even with total short-term memory loss...

466
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,460
应该能够靠本能避免捡错物件
Sammy should have learned to instinctively stop picking up the wrong objects.

467
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,590
谁都能靠惯性去学习  萨米完全不能
All the previous cases responded to conditioning. Sammy didn't respond at all.

468
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,260
于是证实他所患的是心理病  不是生理病
It was enough to suggest that his condition was psychological, not physical.

469
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,800
保险不保心理  我们拒绝赔偿
We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

470
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,600
医药费由杰克斯太太负担  我升职
His wife got stuck with the bills, and I got a big promotion.

471
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,980
惯性对萨米起不了作用
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless.

472
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,980
对我却有效
But it works for me.

473
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,440
我不像萨米
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

474
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,940
我能够靠习惯而生活
Habit and routine make my life possible.

475
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,950
靠惯性  靠本能
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

476
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,960
一觉醒来
Awake.

477
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,210
我在哪里？
Where am I?

478
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,420
旅馆房间里
Motel room.

479
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,560
某家旅馆房间里
Some anonymous motel room.

480
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,480
虽然抽屉空空如也  我还是要打开来看看
Nothing in the drawers, but I'll take a look anyway.

481
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,030
只有一本基甸社送的圣经
Nothing except the Gideon Bible.

482
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,250
开门
Lenny! Open up!

483
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,050
等一等
Just a minute.

484
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,670
开门
Open the door.

485
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,010
莱尼？
Lenny.

486
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,870
"泰迪" "5550134"

487
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,760
开门
Open the door.

488
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,770
快开门
Come on!

489
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,360
泰迪
Hi, Teddy.

490
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,690
你玩够了没有？
Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

491
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,960
我明白了
I get it.

492
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,500
隔壁有人在亲热
Amorous neighbors.

493
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,040
你来做什么？
What are you doing here?

494
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,840
是你叫我来的  你说要我帮忙
You called me. You said you needed my help.

495
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,470
我是看在朋友的份上才帮你的
I've had more rewarding friendships than this one.

496
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,890
虽然总是得忍受你一遍遍地唠叨
Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes.

497
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,640
怎么回事？
What the fuck is that?

498
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,150
- 是谁？ - 你不认识？
- Who the fuck is that?      - You don't know him?

499
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,860
不认识  我应该认识吗？
No! Should I?

500
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,570
等一等
Wait a minute.

501
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,110
- 是不是约翰•G？ - 相信不是
- Is that John G?      - I don't think so.

502
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,490
- 你没有记下来？ - 我还没记就睡着了
- You don't think so? You didn't write it down?      - I might've fallen asleep before I did.

503
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,570
真离谱
For Christ's sakes!

504
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,410
问他吧
Ask him.

505
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,040
你叫什么？
What's your name?

506
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,130
你的名字
Your name.

507
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,540
- 达德    - 谁打伤了你？
- Dodd.      - Who did this to you?

508
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,210
- 什么？ - 谁打伤了你？
- What?      - Who did this to you?

509
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,800
你
You did.

510
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,310
- 我不会帮你杀人  - 不  让我想想
- I'm not gonna help you kill that guy.      - No, just let me think for a minute.

511
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,800
达德

512
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,000
"弄走他  问娜塔莉娅"

513
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,520
娜塔莉娅  谁是娜塔莉娅？
Okay, Natalie. Who's Natalie?

514
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,070
- 哪个娜塔莉娅？ - 为什么问？
- Natalie who?      - Why?

515
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,240
- 说不定我认识她  - 我们要把他弄走
- Maybe I know her.      - Look. We gotta get him out of here.

516
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,780
好的  好的
All right, all right.

517
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,870
他一定有车
He's gotta have a car, right?

518
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,540
送他上车  然后吓跑他
We take him down to his car, tell him to get the fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

519
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,700
他在流血  怎么出去？
We can't walk him out of here tied up and bleeding.

520
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,250
- 他怎样上来的？ - 不知道
- How the fuck did you get him up here?      - I don't know.

521
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,290
你不知道？
You don't know.

522
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,380
我知道这不是我的房间
Yes, I do. This is not my room.

523
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,260
一定是他的  我们自己走吧
It must be his room. Great! Let's go.

524
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,300
- 不可以把他留在这里  - 为什么？
- No, no. We can't just leave him here.      - Why not?

525
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,930
女工发现  会报警  他认得我们
Because the maid's gonna walk in. She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

526
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,640
先替他松绑...
Okay. We untie him...

527
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,600
清理一下  然后用枪押走
we clean him up, and we march him out of here with a gun in his back.

528
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,650
枪？哪里有枪？
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

529
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,490
一定是他的  我这种人不会有枪
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

530
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,720
你有枪就不得了
Fucking hope not.

531
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,160
哪一部？
Which one?

532
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,710
不如偷了他的车  作为惩戒
We should probably steal his car. You know, teach him a lesson.

533
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,750
住口
Shut up.

534
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,260
你开着美州豹  当然不想偷
That's all right for you to say. You're the one with the Jag.

535
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,220
上车  我载他  你随后来
Get in. I'm gonna ride with him. You follow us.

536
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,220
把你的车钥匙拿来
Give me your keys.

537
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,510
你开自己的车吧
Take your own car.

538
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,500
- 他害怕吗？ - 他怕你那撇小胡子
- So was he scared?      - Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache.

539
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,300
扯蛋  你应该偷他的车
Fuck you. You should have stolen his car.

540
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,430
- 这辆有什么不好？ - 你想交换吗？
- Why? What's wrong with this one?      - Nothing. You want to trade?

541
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,850
你打算怎么样？
So what do you do now?

542
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,390
我要查个清楚
I'm going to find out what the fuck that was all about.

543
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,800
娜塔莉娅  是不是？这个该死的达德是谁？
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

544
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,290
"达德"

545
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,070
萨米的妻子要负担…
Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him...

546
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,240
丈夫沉重的医药费
and fighting the company's decision.

547
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,410
不过  她耿耿于怀的不是钱
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

548
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,500
我没说过萨米在假装
I never said that Sammy was faking.

549
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,210
萨米  我想你替我办一件事
Sammy, I have an idea.

550
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,960
我只说是心理病  不是生理病
Just that his problem was mental, not physical.

551
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,300
我要你把这支笔装到口袋里
I want you to have a pen in your pocket, okay?

552
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,930
- 而是不明白丈夫的病况  - 还要带着一本记事簿
- But she couldn't understand.      - You're gonna have a pad in your pocket.

553
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:29,010
- 我做错了什么？ - 你没有做错什么
- I did something wrong?      - You did something wrong!

554
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,220
你当然做错了  我们得想想办法
We're gonna deal with it. We're gonna try harder.

555
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,430
她觉得  假如自己的丈夫…
She looks into his eyes and sees the same person.

556
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,650
患的不是生理病  应该可以痊愈
If it's not a physical problem, he should just snap out of it.

557
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,440
- 爱伦打过电话来    - 爱伦打过电话来？
- Ellen called!      - Ellen called?

558
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:44,150
- 爱伦今天不能来  爱伦不来了  - 对不起
- Ellen can't come today! Ellen can't come!      - Okay. I'm sorry!

559
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,360
- 对不起 我已经尽力了   - 要更加努力
- I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry.      - Try harder!

560
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,250
我让她怀疑丈夫患心理病
So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt...

561
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,960
就像我让医生怀疑一样
just like he gave it to the doctors.

562
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,460
我从未说过他假装
But I never said that he was faking. I never said that.

563
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,180
我不觉得喝醉过
I don't feel drunk.

564
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,880
- 喂  - 糟糕！
- Hello?      - Shit.

565
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,380
打扫
Housekeeping.

566
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,550
- 现在不方便    - 对不起
- Not right now.      - I'm sorry.

567
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:51,740
好吧
Okay.

568
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:00,580
为娜塔莉娅收拾达德  叫泰迪帮忙
"Dodd. Put him onto Teddy orjust get rid of him for Natalie."

569
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,750
达德
Dodd.

570
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,800
收拾他  问娜塔莉娅
Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.

571
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,810
泰迪  泰迪
Teddy, Teddy.

572
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,490
请留下你的电话号码
Leave your number. You know what to do.

573
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,740
这个信息是给泰迪的
Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

574
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,870
我在顶峰旅馆  6号房
I'm at the Mountcrest Inn of Fifth Street, room six.

575
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,950
请尽快来  很重要
I need you to come over as soon as you get this. It's important.

576
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,290
我是莱纳  拜拜
This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

577
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,090
妈的
Fuck.

578
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:02,140
杰克斯太太不明白  记忆是强逼不来的
What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was that you can't bully someone into remembering.

579
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,230
施压只有弄巧反拙
The more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.

580
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,980
给我打电话  好吗？
Then call me back?

581
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,710
我在做什么？
Okay. What am I doing?

582
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,680
我在追这个人
I'm chasing this guy.

583
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,930
不  他在追我
No. He's chasing me.

584
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,370
妈的
Fuck.

585
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,090
达德  白种人
"Dodd. White guy.

586
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,130
顶峰旅馆
Mountcrest Inn on Fifth Street."

587
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,760
我不会放过你  贱种
I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.

588
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,590
顶峰旅馆

589
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,760
妈的
Fuck.

590
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,760
对不起
Sorry.

591
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,300
我需要武器
I need a weapon.

592
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,720
这件合用
This'll do.

593
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,870
我不觉得喝醉过
I don't feel drunk.

594
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,970
"事实5：毒贩"

595
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,540
我认识他吗？
Do I know this guy?

596
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,540
他好像认识我
He seems to know me.

597
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,800
怎么回事？
What the fuck?

598
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,560
- 我喜欢你的这辆车    - 谢谢
- I like your car.      - Thank you.

599
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,650
- 在哪里买的？ - 你有兴趣买？
- Where'd you get it?      - Are you interested in buying one?

600
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,190
你觉得我不起眼？
I haven't made a strong enough impression on you?

601
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,280
不用太自卑
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

602
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,910
我在做什么？
Okay. What am I doing?

603
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,010
"事实5：毒贩"

604
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,300
哪位？
Who is this?

605
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,840
哎呦
Ouch. 

606
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,790
- 你怎么可以读完又读？ - 好看嘛
- How can you read that again?      - It's good.

607
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,920
你似乎读过上千次
Yeah, but you've read it, like, a thousand times.

608
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,590
我喜欢读
I enjoy it.

609
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,590
读小说  不知道下文才有趣
I always thought the pleasure of a book was in wanting to know what happens next.

610
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,390
不要那样扫兴
Don't be a prick.

611
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:55,050
我完全因为喜欢读而读
I'm not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.

612
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,680
让我读下去  好不好？
Just let me read, please.

613
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,900
可能以前烧过
Probably tried this before.

614
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,870
可能已经烧掉你很多遗物
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

615
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,410
总是忘不了你
Can't remember to forget you.

616
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:40,810
是
Yeah.

617
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:42,600
嗯
Uh-huh.

618
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,570
情况跟我所掌握的资料一致
Sir, that'd certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries.

619
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:51,530
我希望多了解毒品方面的事
I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle. Can you hang on a sec?

620
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,370
警方报告提到凶手车里有毒品
The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house.

621
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,540
车是失窃的  车上遍布凶手的指纹
The car was stolen, but his prints were all over it.

622
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,340
我认识一位警察  报告是他给我的
I got friends in the department. They gave me a copy of it.

623
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,710
我做保险  有机会认识警察
I dealt with the police a lot in my insurancejob.

624
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,880
因为我这个病  我没法记得整份报告
With my condition, it's really tough. I can't keep it all in mind at once.

625
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:18,220
只好记要紧的  报告有几页不见了
I have to summarize the different sections. And there's pages missing.

626
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,470
并不完整
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

627
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,810
有部分被删掉了  奇怪
I don't know why these are crossed out.

628
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,810
不过  警方并不追缉约翰•G
But they weren't even looking for John G.

629
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,650
认为没有必要
The stuffthey found in the car fit in with what they believed had happened...

630
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,650
所以不了了之
so they didn't chase any of it up.

631
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:06,850
亲爱的
Honey.

632
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,150
亲爱的  很晚了
Honey, it's late.

633
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,300
没事吧？
Everything okay?

634
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,400
你没事吧？
You okay in there?

635
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,610
满意吗？
Was it good for you?

636
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,740
什么？要我锁门？
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

637
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,750
不用
No.

638
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,080
你走吧
I'd like you to leave now.

639
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,150
凶手车里有毒品  是个关键
There's something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn't ring true for me.

640
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,740
警方说凶手是吸毒的
Because the police claim the guy was an addict...

641
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,820
打劫我家  是为了有钱买毒品
needing money to score, which I think is bullshit...

642
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,160
他已经有大批毒品  还用打劫吗？
'cause he's not gonna go breaking into places while he's still got a stash that big.

643
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,290
我认为约翰•G用毒品栽赃嫁货
I think John G. Left it there or planted it there.

644
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,620
你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

645
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,090
对了  怪不得
Shit. That's true. It fits.

646
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,750
那么他是毒贩了
So he's a dealer.

647
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,340
等一等
Hang on a sec.

648
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:08,760
事实5：毒贩

649
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,480
现在有头绪了
Now we're getting somewhere.

650
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,150
特惠旅馆
"Discount Inn."

651
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,220
特惠旅馆

652
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,280
女伴服务

653
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,330
金发女郎  好
Yeah, okay. Blonde's fine.

654
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,830
对了
That's what they say.

655
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,040
特惠旅馆  304号房间
The Discount Inn. 304.

656
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,090
我叫莱纳
Leonard.

657
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,920
想怎么样？
What then?

658
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,220
我们上床  你等我睡着
We just go to bed. You wait for me to fall asleep.

659
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,390
然后上厕所  用力关门
You go into the bathroom and you slam the door.

660
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:29,010
- 用力关门？ -用力到吵醒我
- Slam it?      - Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

661
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,060
- 只是这样吗？ - 只是这样
- And that's it?      - That's it.

662
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,900
先把这些东西四处放
First I just need you to put these things around the room.

663
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,070
假装是你的东西 你的卧室
Just pretend they're your things and that this is your bedroom.

664
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:59,750
- 要我穿上去吗？ - 不用  就好像你刚刚脱下来
- Should I wear it?      - No. Just like you took it off or something.

665
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:05,130
我不要你用  对不起
I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

666
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,930
只要你随便放在房里
I just mean put them around the room...

667
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:11,600
就像是你的东西
as ifthey were your things.

668
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,100
你喜欢怎么样就怎么样好了
Whatever gets you off.

669
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,630
我不怪警方不理会
I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously.

670
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:47,050
我的病不容易明白
This is a difficult condition for people to understand.

671
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,390
看看萨米•杰克斯吧  杰克斯太太实在受不了
Look at Sammy Jankis. His own wife couldn't deal with it.

672
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,010
怎么都不能让他恢复记忆
I told you about how she tried to get him to snap out of it.

673
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,430
她终于来办公室见我
Eventually she came to see me at the office. I found out all kinds of shit.

674
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,400
说用尽办法强逼萨米记忆
She told me about life with Sammy, how she treated him.

675
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,940
谢谢你见我
Thank you for seeing me.

676
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,770
甚至要萨米把食物收藏起来
It got to the point where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house.

677
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,610
要他记着收藏地点
Then she'd stop feeding him to see if his hunger...

678
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,650
否则就挨饿
would make him remember where he'd hidden the food.

679
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,620
她不是狠心  只是希望萨米康复
She wasn't a cruel person. She just wanted old Sammy back.

680
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:16,500
你认为萨米在假装
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you've decided that he's faking.

681
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:19,210
公司并没有说萨米假装
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is faking anything...

682
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,210
只是认为他的病不是…
just that his condition can't be shown to be...

683
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:24,750
我只想知道你的真正看法
I just want to know what your honest opinion about Sammy is.

684
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,760
案件在上诉  我们不应该讨论
We shouldn't even be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal.

685
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,090
- 我不会提出上诉  - 那么你想怎么样？
- I'm not appealing the decision.      - Then why are you here?

686
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:33,640
当我看到萨米
Try to understand. When I look at Sammy...

687
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,180
我看的不是植物人
I don't see some... vegetable.

688
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,350
而是以前的萨米
I see my same old Sammy.

689
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,940
我总是抱有希望  总希望他完全是心理作祟
What do you think that's like for me to suspect he might be imagining this whole problem...

690
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,110
总希望有办法…
and that if I just could say the right thing...

691
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,990
让他痊愈
he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal?

692
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:00,330
如果萨米确实无药可救
If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone...

693
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:04,540
那么我会抛开过去  爱现在的萨米
then I could say good-bye and start loving this new Sammy.

694
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,380
一天抱有希望  一天就死心不息
As long as I have doubt, I can't say good-bye and move on.

695
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,220
你要我怎么样？
What do you want from me?

696
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,470
我要你撇开公事半分钟
I want you to forget the company you work for for 30 seconds...

697
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:18,220
告诉我萨米是不是假装
and tell me if you really believe that Sammy's faking his condition.

698
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:23,480
我需要知道…你真正的想法
I need to know... what you honestly believe.

699
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:32,400
我相信萨米有记忆能力
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.

700
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,410
谢谢你
Thank you.

701
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,000
我以为帮了她  以为她只是要一个答案
I thought I helped her. I thought she just needed some kind of answer.

702
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:49,090
以为什么答案都不重要
I didn't think it was important what the answer was...

703
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,920
以为她只要一个可信的答案
just that she had one to believe.

704
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,860
- 这么好的车  你应该上锁  - 你是谁？
- A car this nice you should lock.      - Who the fuck are you?

705
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,280
- 你的朋友泰迪   - 证明一下
- Teddy, your buddy.      - Prove it.

706
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,990
你告诉过我萨米的事
Sammy. Remember Sammy? You told me about Sammy!

707
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:19,030
天啊
Geez!

708
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,040
你在我车里干什么？
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

709
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,250
你连幽默感也没有了？
What, your sense of humor went with the memory?

710
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:26,290
- 你为什么在这里  知道吗？ - 有未了结的事
- Do you even know why you're here?      - Unfinished business.

711
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,750
莱尼  告诉你吧
Lenny, let me inform you.

712
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,210
你的事已经了结
Your business here is very much finished.

713
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,300
- 你为了娜塔莉娅  所以还在这里  - 谁是娜塔莉娅？
- You're still here because of Natalie.      - Who's Natalie?

714
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,510
傻瓜  你刚从谁的家走出来？
Schmuck, whose house do you think you just walked out of?

715
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:43,310
对  看看照片吧  你肯定有她的照片
That's right. Take a look at your pictures. I bet you got one of her.

716
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:47,520
拍得好啊  大摄影师
Nice shot, Leibovitz.

717
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:51,360
记下来吧  不要相信她
You'll wanna make a note. You can't trust her.

718
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,820
为什么？
Yeah? Why's that?

719
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:56,160
因为她看出你有钱…
Because by now she's taken a look at this suit and the car...

720
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,620
打算利用你  捞点油水
and she's starting to figure out ways of turning the situation to her advantage.

721
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,040
她已经把你搭上手了
She's already got you staying with her, for Christ's sakes.

722
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,710
你不可以回她的家  我介绍你入住间旅馆吧
You can't go back in there. Let me give you the name of a motel.

723
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:11,670
- 碰到我  算你运气好  - 那女的为什么碰不得？
- You're lucky I ran into you. That broad's bad news.      - What do you mean, "bad news"?

724
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,050
她涉及毒品
She's involved with drugs.

725
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:16,430
看到了吗？
Look. These. You see these?

726
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,470
这是她工作的酒吧
This is the bar where she works.

727
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,600
她的男朋友是毒贩
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

728
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,310
她替他办事  传递消息
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

729
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:26,270
他把讯息写在纸的背后
He writes messages on the back of these.

730
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,900
她趁斟酒时给他  偷偷替他传递
Then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks.

731
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:33,070
- 关我什么事？ - 因为她惹上了麻烦…
- Why should I care?      - Because when she gets jammed up...

732
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,320
打算利用你来替她解决
she's gonna use you to protect herself.

733
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,610
谁想找她的麻烦？
From who?

734
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,450
想知道她男朋友下落的人
Guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.

735
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:43,080
那人要找她出气  总有人受罪
Guys are gonna come after her. Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.

736
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,210
一定有人受罪  也许她想用你来挡灾
Somebody always pays. Maybe she'll make it you.

737
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,790
是吗？也许她想利用你来挡灾  是不是？
Oh, yeah? Maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?

738
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,790
你担心她利用我来对付你
You worried that she's gonna use me against you?

739
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,880
- 不会  - 为什么不会？
- No.      - Why not?

740
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:57,220
因为她不认识我
Because she doesn't know who I am.

741
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:01,260
- 你为什么跟着我？ - 也许我想帮你
- Why are you following me?      - Maybe I wanna help.

742
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,770
她完全不知道你在调查什么  天才
She doesn't know anything about your investigation, okay, Einstein?

743
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:07,520
记下来吧
So write this down.

744
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,270
她提议帮你  其实是为了自已
When she offers to help, it'll be for her own reasons.

745
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:17,150
我没有骗你  用我这支笔记下来
I'm not lying. Take my pen. Write this down.

746
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,410
"不要相信她"
"Do not trust her."

747
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:30,330
- 现在高兴了没有？ - 你离开本地我才高兴
- There. You happy now?      - I won't be happy until you leave town.

748
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,330
为什么？
Why not?

749
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:35,920
你留下来  迟早有人会问
You ever wonder how long you can hang around here before people start asking questions?

750
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,090
问什么？
What sort of questions?

751
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:39,300
问你自己应该问的问题
The same sort of questions you should be asking yourself.

752
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,930
- 例如呢？ - 你为什么穿着名牌西服？开着名牌车？
- Like what?      - Like, how did you get this suit, the car?

753
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:43,640
- 我有钱    - 从哪里来的？
- I have money.      - From what?

754
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:47,900
我太太去世了  我以前在保险公司工作  买足了保险
My wife's death. I used to work in insurance. We were well covered.

755
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,940
你痛失娇妻  于是去买美州豹？
So in your griefyou wandered into a Jaguar dealership.

756
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,440
回答不出来吧
You don't have a clue, do you?

757
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:00,070
- 你连自已是谁都不知道    - 我知道
- You don't even know who you are.      - Yes, I do.

758
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,910
我没有失忆  意外前的事我统统记得
I don't have amnesia. I remember everything right up until the incident.

759
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,780
我叫莱纳•谢尔比  旧金山人
I am Leonard Shelby. I am from San Francisco...

760
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:10,500
那是以前的身份  你不知道现在的身份
That's who you were. You do not know who you are...

761
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:14,500
意外发生后…你变成怎么样的人
what you've become since... the incident.

762
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,130
你到处扮侦探
You wander around playing detective.

763
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:19,800
连扮了多久都不知道
You don't even know how long ago it was.

764
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:25,600
让我问问你  你推销保险  够钱穿名牌西装
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?

765
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,480
- 不是推销  是调查    - 对  你是调查员
- I didn't sell insurance. I investigated it.      - Right. You're an investigator.

766
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:35,020
- 你预先应该调查自已  - 谢谢你的忠告
- Maybe you should start investigating yourself.      - Thank you for the advice.

767
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:39,820
帮个忙  不要回到她家去
Look, do me a favor. Don't go back in there.

768
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,610
住旅馆好不好？
Will you take the motel out of town?

769
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,160
拜拜  莱尼
It's been fun, Lenny.

770
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,130
不要相信她
"Do not trust her."

771
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:58,610
"泰迪" "5550134"

772
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,920
"不要受他的骗"
"Don't believe his lies."

773
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:13,840
"特惠旅馆"

774
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,060
算了  我自己租房住
Fuck it. I need my own place.

775
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,400
"特惠旅馆"

776
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:26,950
杰克斯太太不应该逼我回答那种问题
No. She shouldn't have given me that responsibility.

777
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:29,700
我是保险调查员  不是医生
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.

778
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,330
对
Yeah. I guess.

779
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,790
我有很多顾虑
But I've got all sorts of other considerations.

780
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,090
法律责任  大笔的赔款…
Legal responsibility, large financial...

781
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,410
"绝不要接听电话"

782
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,550
哪位？
Who is this?

783
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:00,020
记下来  记下所发生的事情  记下来
Write this down. Write down what happened. Write it down.

784
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:02,440
集中精神  记着  找支笔
Concentrate. Keep it in mind. Find a pen.

785
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,200
发生了什么事？
What happened?

786
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,330
还用问？他打我
What does it look like? He beat the shit out of me.

787
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:13,790
谁？
Who?

788
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:15,620
谁？
Who?

789
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:17,750
达德啊！达德打我
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd. Dodd beat the shit out of me.

790
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:19,750
- 为什么？ - 为什么？都是因为你
- Why?      - Why? Because of you.

791
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,550
我照你的吩咐  去找他
Because I did what you told me to do! Go in and reason with him!

792
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:26,170
- 告诉他泰迪的事  结果挨打  - 冷静点
- Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea!      - Calm down. Take it easy.

793
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,090
不要怕
You're safe. It's okay.

794
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,970
坐下来
Come on. Just sit down.

795
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,970
坐
Sit down.

796
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,980
坐
Here. Sit down.

797
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,900
不要怕
Okay. You're okay.

798
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,270
我拿些冰来给你敷脸
I'll just get some ice for your face.

799
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,200
拿着
Here.

800
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,040
我按照你的吩咐去做
I did exactly what you told me to do.

801
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,290
我去找达德
I went to Dodd...

802
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,800
告诉他杰米的钱、毒品…
and I told him that I didn't have any of Jimmy's money...

803
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,340
都不在我身上
or the drugs...

804
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:14,140
肯定统统被那个泰迪拿走了
and that this Teddy must have taken everything.

805
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,850
他怎么说的？
And what did he say?

806
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,850
他不相信我
He didn't believe me.

807
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,440
限我明天交出毒品  否则就杀我
He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

808
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,990
说完了就打我
Then he just started hitting me.

809
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:31,620
他在哪里？
Where is he?

810
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,620
- 为什么问？ - 我要去见他
- Why?      - I'll go see him.

811
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,700
然后呢？
And?

812
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:39,000
打他  叫他去找泰迪
I'll give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

813
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:41,500
他会杀了你的  莱尼
He'll kill you, Lenny.

814
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,420
我太太叫我莱尼
My wife used to call me Lenny.

815
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,920
是吗？
Yeah?

816
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,590
我讨厌莱尼这个名字
Yeah. I hated it.

817
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,180
达德这个人惹不得
This guy is so dangerous.

818
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:57,810
- 我们另想办法吧  - 不不
- Let's just think of something else, okay?      - No, no.

819
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:01,940
你告诉我他的模样 还有哪里能找到他就行了
You just tell me what he looks like... and where I can find him.

820
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:05,570
- 你有笔吧？ - 在手袋里
- Have you got a pen?      - In my purse.

821
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,490
他也许会找你
He'll probably find you.

822
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,910
- 什么意思？ - 我告诉他你的车
- What do you mean?      - I told him about your car.

823
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:22,710
为什么？
Why?

824
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:28,050
我挨不住打  只好说点东西
He was beating the shit out of me. I had to tell him something.

825
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:30,880
写下来吧
Just write it all down.

826
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,270
小心
Be careful.

827
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,280
不用担心
I'll be fine.

828
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:00,410
- 这么名贵的车  你应该上锁  - 你是谁？
- A car this nice you should lock.      - Who the fuck are you?

829
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,090
"绝不要接听电话"

830
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,760
柜台吗？
Front desk?

831
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:20,430
我是21号房的莱纳
Burt. Right. This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.

832
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,600
对  我不要接听电话
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't want any calls.

833
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,770
对  什么电话都不听
Nope. None at all.

834
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,660
- 什么事？ - 有人来过
- What's wrong?      - Somebody's come already.

835
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,700
- 是谁？ - 他自称达德
- Who?      - He calls himself Dodd.

836
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,200
他想要什么？
What does he want?

837
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:45,250
追问杰米和他的钱的下落  他以为我私吞了
He wants to know what happened to Jimmy and his money. He thinks I took it.

838
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:46,460
你有没有？
Did you?

839
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:48,840
没有
No.

840
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,800
- 怎么回事？ - 妈的
- What's this all about?      - Fuck!

841
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,760
你什么都不知道  你无知得相当舒服
You don't have a fucking clue, do you? You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't ya?

842
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:02,390
- 我有种病  - 我知道你的病
- I have this condition.      - I know all about your fucking condition, Leonard!

843
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,890
我可能比你更清楚  你什么都不知道
Probably know more about it than you do. You don't have a fucking clue about anything else.

844
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,060
什么事？
What happened?

845
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:09,980
杰米去见了一个叫泰迪的人
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet some guy named Teddy.

846
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,780
他拿了很多钱去  却一去不返
He took a lot of money with him, and he never came back.

847
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:16,450
杰米的拍档以为我是合谋  我连你认不认识泰迪都不知道
Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know if you know this Teddy, or how well.

848
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:18,200
- 我也不知道    - 不要维护他
- Neither do I.      - Don't protect him!

849
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,320
- 我没有维护他  - 帮帮我
- I'm not.      - Help me.

850
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:20,660
怎么帮？
How?

851
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,910
替我铲除达德
Get rid of Dodd for me.

852
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,040
- 什么？ - 杀掉他  我付你钱
- What?      - Kill him. I'll pay you.

853
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:28,170
什么？我不会为钱杀人
What do you think I am? I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

854
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,290
如果为爱呢？
What then? Love?

855
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:32,090
那么会为什么？
What would you kill for?

856
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:34,760
- 你肯为太太杀人   - 那是另一回事
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?      - That's different.

857
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,340
- 对我是同一回事   - 不要谈我太太
- Not to me. I wasn't fucking married to her.      - Hey, don't talk about my wife.

858
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:41,080
我要谈谁  就谈谁
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

859
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,220
无论我说什么  你都记不得
I can say whatever I want and you won't remember.

860
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,430
骂你老婆是婊子  我们还可以做朋友
I could call your wife a fucking whore and we could still be friends.

861
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,730
- 冷静点   - 你根本不知道害怕
- Calm down.      - Easy for you to say. You can't get scared.

862
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:51,400
- 你个白痴   - 不要冲动  这事跟我无关
- You don't know how, you fucking idiot!      - Take it easy. This has nothing to do with me.

863
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,990
可能有关！你怎么知道无关？
Maybe it does. How the fuck would you know? You don't know a fucking thing!

864
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:59,410
- 你不怕死  不过会生气？ - 会
- You can't get scared, but can you get angry?      - Yes.

865
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:01,830
你这个该死的猪
You pathetic piece of shit.

866
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:03,990
无论我说什么…
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

867
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,660
你都莫名其妙  死蠢材
and you won't have a fucking clue, you fucking retard!

868
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,250
- 住口    - 知不知道？我会利用你
- Shut your mouth.      - You know what? I'm gonna use you.

869
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,840
我声明会利用你
I'm telling you now, because I'm gonna enjoy it so much more...

870
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,460
你个神经病照样会给我利用
if I know that you could stop me if you weren't such a fucking freak.

871
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:17,340
你丢掉了笔？
Did you lose your pen?

872
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,840
太倒霉了  神经病  否则你会记下…
That's too bad, freak. Otherwise, you could write yourself a little note...

873
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:24,510
娜塔莉娅恨透你了  同时认为你老婆是个婊子
about how much Natalie hates your retarded guts and that I called your wife a fuckin' whore.

874
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,310
- 不要再说了   - 不准再说你老婆是婊子？
- Don't say another fuckin' word.      - About your whore of a wife?

875
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:33,150
据说短期失忆这种病
I read about your condition, Leonard.

876
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:37,820
其中一个成因… 是性病
You know what one of the causes of short-term memory loss is? Venereal disease.

877
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:42,780
也许你的淫贱老婆搞过有性病的男人
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife sucked one too many diseased cocks...

878
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:44,980
把你传染成了白痴
and turned you into a fucking retard!

879
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:50,480
死神经病
You sad, sad freak.

880
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,250
我想说什么就说什么
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

881
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,760
你不会记得
and you won't remember.

882
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:59,630
我们依然做好朋友
We'll still be best friends...

883
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,260
甚至做情人
or maybe even lovers.

884
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:06,680
妈的
Fuck.

885
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,690
再见
I'll see you soon.

886
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,410
集中精神  找支笔记下来
Stay focused. Find a pen.

887
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:27,620
记下来  记下来
Gotta write this down. Gotta write it down.

888
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,670
集中精神…
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

889
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:35,340
记住  记住…
Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.

890
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,720
找支笔  我要找支笔
Come on. Gotta find a pen. I gotta find a pen.

891
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,760
记下来  统统记下来
Write this down. Write this down, exactly what happened.

892
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,720
记下所发生的事情
Gonna write down exactly what happened. Come on.

893
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,140
快点！我要找支笔！
I gotta find a pen. Geez! Come on.

894
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,640
集中精神
Keep focused. Keep focused.

895
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,190
记住  快找支笔
Keep it in mind. Come on. Find a pen.

896
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:57,110
记下来  记下所发生的事情
Write this note. Write down what happened.

897
01:16:57,190 --> 01:17:00,490
集中精神  记下来
Write it down. Concentrate. Keep it in mind.

898
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,290
发生了什么事？
What happened?

899
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,460
还用问？他打我
What does it look like? He beat the shit out of me.

900
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:13,790
谁？
Who?

901
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:15,580
谁？
Who?

902
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:18,000
达德啊！达德打我
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd. Dodd beat the shit out of me.

903
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,720
喂
Hello?

904
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:34,560
我是柜台的波特
It's Burt, from the front desk.

905
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,230
- 什么事？  - 你吩咐过不接电话
- Yeah?      - I know you said you didn't want any calls.

906
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,860
可是这个人自称警察
But this guy called. He's on the phone now. He says he's a cop.

907
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,400
- 警察？ - 是的
- A cop?      - Yeah.

908
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:47,030
他说…他有你要的资料
He says you're really gonna wanna know what he has to say.

909
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,700
我不喜欢讲电话  我要面对面谈
I'm not too good on the phone. I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them.

910
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,670
去沙发歇歇吧  会很舒服的
You can crash on the couch. It's comfortable.

911
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,550
坐吧
Just have a seat.

912
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,090
谢谢
Thanks.

913
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,060
你认为需要多久？
How long do you think it's gonna take you?

914
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,810
多久才找得到杀妻仇人？
You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife?

915
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:20,520
要看他是在本地还是在外地
That depends on if he's here in town or if he's moved on.

916
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:23,740
我有他的资料
I have my file here.

917
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:29,870
让我问问你  你既然资料齐全…
Can I ask you something? If you have all of that information...

918
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:32,330
为什么警方不替你缉凶？
then why haven't the police found him for you?

919
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,750
- 警方不肯缉凶    - 为什么？
- They're not looking for him.      - Why not?

920
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:40,750
他们认为已经没有凶手  我把经过告诉了他们
They don't think he exists. You see, I told them what I remembered.

921
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,960
我正在睡觉
I was asleep.

922
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,170
突然醒来
Something woke me up.

923
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:54,100
她的床是凉的  她已下床很久了
Her side ofthe bed was cold. She'd obviously been out of bed for a while.

924
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:54,660
肯定有第二个凶手
There had to be a second man.

925
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:57,330
他从后面袭击我
Somebody hit me from behind. I remember.

926
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:59,330
此后  我什么都不记得了
It's about the last thing that I do remember.

927
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,170
警方不相信有第二个凶手
Look. The police did not believe me. If we check the police...

928
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:06,550
警方怎么解释案情？怎么解释枪和其他？
How did they explain what you do remember? The gun and stuff.

929
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,300
约翰•G很狡猾
John G. was clever.

930
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,890
很狡猾
He was clever.

931
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:17,680
他拿掉死者的枪  换上袭击过我的棍子
See, he took the dead man's gun, he replaced it with the sap that he hit me with.

932
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:22,350
留下我的枪和贼车  于是误导了警方
He left my gun and he left the get away car. He gave the police a complete package.

933
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,190
警方在死者手中的棍子上发现了我的血迹
They found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand.

934
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:29,190
并且只找到我的枪
And they only found my gun.

935
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,910
于是断定只有一个凶手
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

936
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:36,580
我认为有第二个  可是我伤了脑子
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.

937
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:39,290
警方不会相信有脑病的人
The cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition.

938
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:43,460
如果需要  你可以在这里住几天
Leonard, you can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help you.

939
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,050
谢谢
Thanks.

940
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:49,590
我要上班去了
I have to go back to work.

941
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,930
不用客气
So, just make yourself at home.

942
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:55,850
随便看电视  随便吃东西
You can watch TV oryou can have some food, whatever you want, okay?

943
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:59,100
- 不用客气   - 一件事
- Make yourself at home.      - One thing.

944
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:05,440
- 我想记得你   - 我叫娜塔莉娅
- Something to remember you by.      - My name is Natalie.

945
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,820
娜塔莉娅
"Natalie."

946
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:29,430
"记住萨米•杰克斯"

947
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,190
- 什么事？  - 有人来过
- What's wrong?      - Somebody's come already.

948
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,440
"接我电话"

949
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,490
- 免费   - 谢谢
- On the house.      - Thanks.

950
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,990
你确实有问题
You really do have a problem.

951
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,500
正如警察所说的一样
Just like that cop said.

952
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,250
你有病
Your condition.

953
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,840
没有人十全十美
Nobody's perfect.

954
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:55,840
你最后记得的是什么？
What's the last thing that you do remember?

955
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:01,100
- 我太太  - 真是多情
- My wife.      - That's sweet.

956
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,060
垂死…
Dying.

957
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,430
我太太垂死的情形
I remember my wife dying.

958
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,110
我替你换一杯
Let me get you another one.

959
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:15,030
这个杯子有灰尘
I think this one's dusty.

960
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:21,530
你为什么找我？想要什么？
Why are you calling me? What do you want?

961
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:25,080
我知道你是警察   我犯了法？
I know you're a cop, but what do you want? Have I done something wrong?

962
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,120
还是做了坏事？
I don't know. Something bad, maybe.

963
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:34,590
为什么问我？我记不得了  你反正不会相信
Why are you asking me? I can't remember what I've done. You wouldn't believe me anyway.

964
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:37,590
你不会相信我有这种病
Because of my condition. You don't believe someone with this condition.

965
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,640
就像我不相信萨米一样！
Nobody believed Sammy! I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

966
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,970
"费迪斯酒吧"
"Ferdy's Bar."

967
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,930
"下班来  娜塔莉娅"
"Come by after. Natalie."

968
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,830
啤酒  麻烦你
I'll have a beer, please.

969
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,910
- 要什么？ - 啤酒  麻烦你
- What do you want?      - A beer, please.

970
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:08,410
你穿成那模样来喝啤酒？
You can't just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer.

971
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,830
- 你们有服装规定？ - 你为什么来这儿？
- What, is there a dress code?      - Why are you here?

972
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,880
- 我想找个叫娜塔莉娅的人  - 我就是
- I'm meeting someone called Natalie.      - That's me.

973
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,170
我们见过面  是不是？
Yeah. We met before, right?

974
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:19,800
- 那么我来做什么？ - 不知道  你自己说好了
- Then why am I here?      - I don't know. Why don't you tell me.

975
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,340
我记不得  我没有短期记忆
I don't remember. I have no short-term memory. It's not amnesia.

976
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:25,100
- 原来你是那个失忆的人  - 你怎么知道？
- You're the memory guy.      - How do you know about me?

977
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,640
我男朋友提过你
My boyfriend told me about you.

978
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:31,640
- 你男朋友叫什么？ - 杰米•格兰斯  认识吗？
- Yeah? Who's your boyfriend?      - Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

979
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,270
不认识
No.

980
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,820
他认识你  提到过你
He knows you. He told me about you.

981
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,990
说你住在特惠旅馆
He said you were staying at the Discount.

982
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:43,110
前不久有警察来找过你
In fact, a cop came by earlier, was looking for you.

983
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,370
说要找一个…
Said he was looking for a guy who can't remember anything...

984
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,790
懵懵懂懂的人
wouldn't know how he got here or what he'd done.

985
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:50,410
说我这里很多这种人
Said I get a lot of guys around here like that.

986
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,960
酗酒是短期失忆的一个原因
Chronic alcoholism is one cause of short-term memory loss.

987
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,760
- 你叫泰迪？ - 不是  我叫莱纳
- Are you Teddy?      - No. My name's Leonard.

988
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,970
- 泰迪派你来的？ - 我不知道
- Did Teddy send you?      - I don't know.

989
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:05,220
- 杰米现在怎样了？ - 我也不知道
- What's happened to Jimmy?      - I don't know that either.

990
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,680
- 对不起  - 你什么都不记得了？
- Sorry.      - You don't remember anything?

991
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:11,100
记不得去过哪里 做过什么
You don't remember where you've been or what you've just done.

992
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,810
记不得  我没有短期记忆  什么都忘掉了
No. I can't make new memories. Everything just fades.

993
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,610
- 那么你来做什么？ - 我在口袋里找到这个
- Then why did you come here?      - I found this in my pocket.

994
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,400
你的口袋？
Your pocket.

995
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:50,180
酒吧赌注  有兴趣参加吗？
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

996
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,600
- 不用客气   - 彩金好多
- No, thanks.      - It's for a lot of money.

997
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:56,150
参加嘛  是慈善的
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity. Help me out.

998
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:09,700
谢谢你
Thank you.

999
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,220
- 免费   - 谢谢
- On the house.      - Thanks.

1000
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,390
谁也不相信我
It's completely fucked because nobody believes you.

1001
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,860
脑部受损  连说话也没有人信
It's amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility.

1002
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,730
我以前不信萨米  应该有此报应
I guess it's some kind of poetic justice for not believing Sammy.

1003
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,990
患我这种病的人…
You know the truth about my condition, Officer?

1004
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,820
什么都不知道
You don't know anything.

1005
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:51,080
生气生得莫名其妙
You feel angry, you don't know why.

1006
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,910
内疚得莫名其妙
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

1007
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:57,370
无论什么  十分钟就忘掉
You could do anything and not have the faintest idea 10 minutes later.

1008
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:59,830
萨米的事…
Like Sammy. What if I've done something like Sammy?

1009
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:03,800
我有没有告诉你萨米和他太太的事？
I didn't tell you what happened to Sammy and his wife?

1010
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:08,720
她到我办公室见我  我以为她在试探
She came to see me at my office. I thought she was trying to catch me off guard...

1011
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,720
我没有对她说真心话
so I didn't tell her what I really thought, but I never said that he was faking...

1012
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,720
只说他的病是心理上的  而不是生理的
just that his condition was mental, not physical.

1013
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:16,770
她回家  替萨米做最后的测试
I found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam.

1014
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,440
萨米  到时间替我打针了
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

1015
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:39,420
她深信萨米爱她
She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her.

1016
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,540
于是用这个测试办法
So she found a way to test him.

1017
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,850
萨米  到时间替我打针了
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

1018
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,860
她以为可以拆穿他
She really thought she'd call his bluff.

1019
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:12,450
打了
There you go.

1020
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:16,870
否则  她不想再活下去
Or she just didn't wanna live with the things she'd put him through.

1021
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:27,840
萨米
Sammy.

1022
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,130
到时间替我打针了
It's time for my shot.

1023
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,390
不会痛
It won't hurt.

1024
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,560
她不省人事  接着就死了
She went into a coma and never recovered.

1025
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:29,820
萨米不明白  也不能解释
Sammy couldn't understand or explain what happened.

1026
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:34,030
从此长住疗养院
He's been in a home ever since.

1027
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:36,530
连妻子去世也不知道
He doesn't even know that his wife is dead.

1028
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:39,990
我看错了萨米  看错了他太太
I was wrong about Sammy, and I was wrong about his wife.

1029
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,000
她不是为钱
She wasn't interested in the money.

1030
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,250
只是想了解病情
She just needed to understand his problem.

1031
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:47,750
他对惯性没有反应  可是他不是骗子
His brain didn't respond to conditioning. But he wasn't a con man.

1032
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,260
她以为萨米没有变
When she looked into his eyes, she thought he could be the same person.

1033
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:53,720
我也以为萨米认得我
When I looked into his eyes, I thought I saw recognition.

1034
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,930
我现在知道是假装的
Now I know. You fake it.

1035
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,850
他假装认得人
If you think you're supposed to recognize somebody, you just pretend to.

1036
01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:01,600
也许是为了博取赞许
You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors.

1037
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,480
也许是为了冒充正常
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1038
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:09,820
什么毒贩？
What drug dealer?

1039
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:17,890
"事实6：车牌 SG1371U"

1040
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,930
"纹身店"

1041
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:23,370
"事实6：车牌…"

1042
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:38,340
- 莱尼  你好  - 这是私人地方
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?      - It's private back here.

1043
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:41,430
- 我们是认识的   - 你怎么知道我在这里？
- It's okay. We know each other. Right, kid?      - How did you know I was in here?

1044
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,520
你把美洲豹停在前面
The Jag's out front. Should have put it around back.

1045
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:47,100
你还在这里做什么？北方有很多纹身店
What are you still doing here, Lenny? There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

1046
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:49,690
我想趁还没忘记  纹下来
I guess I wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind.

1047
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:52,230
- 把车匙给我吧  我帮你开走   - 不要紧
- Give me the keys. I'll move it.      - It'll be all right for a minute.

1048

出去等吧
Wait out there.

1049
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:57,240

01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:05,040

Fact six: Car license SG137IU.

1051
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:13,340
等一等  好不好？
Look. Wait a minute, will ya?

1052
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,880
- 我要送你离开本地  - 为什么？
- We gotta get you out of here.      - Why?

1053
01:31:18,970 --> 01:31:22,260
多此一问  你要我说多少遍？
Man. Come on, Leonard. How many times I gotta tell you?

1054
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:24,720
- 你在这里已经不安全了   - 为什么？
- It's not safe for you to hang around here anymore.      - Why not?

1055
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:26,730
警察在找你
Because that cop's looking for you.

1056
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:29,400
我要给你弄个新身份  新衣服
I gotta get you a new identity, some new clothes.

1057
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:32,110
暂时换辆汽车  穿上去
A different car would do for now. So put these on.

1058
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:33,570
什么警察？
What cop?

1059
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:37,740
一个坏警察  他介绍你住特惠旅馆
He's a bad cop. He's the one that checked you into the Discount Inn.

1060
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:41,660
他已经找你好几天了  蒙骗你  把信封塞进你门底下
He's been calling you for days, telling you shit, slipping envelopes under your door. Shit like that.

1061
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:44,450
- 你怎知道？  - 他告诉我  以为好笑
- How do you know this?      - He told me. He thinks it's funny.

1062
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,540
- 他在玩你   - 你胡说
- He's been laughing at you.      - You're full of shit.

1063
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:49,460
不是  他知道你不爱讲电话…
I'm not. He knows you're no good on the phone, so he's been calling you.

1064
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,540
所以找上门
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

1065
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:54,420
把信封塞进你门里  吓到你听电话
so he slips shit under your door to scare you into answering the phone again...

1066
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,170
骗你说约翰•G是毒贩
giving you a line of crap about John G. Being some local drug dealer.

1067
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,510
- 杰米•格兰斯  - 谁是杰米•格兰斯？
- Jimmy Grants.      - Who's Jimmy Grants?

1068
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:02,550
杰米是毒贩
Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1069
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,930
警察在调查他
The cop wants to know how his operation's run.

1070
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,020
无论如何  你牵涉进去了
He's got some score in mind. Somehow you're involved.

1071
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,270
你怎么认识他的？
Uh-huh. How do you know him?

1072
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:14,570
我是线人  他是外地警察  于是走在一起
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out oftown. The local boys put us together.

1073
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:16,980
假如他知道我帮你  一定会宰了我
If he knew I was helping you, he'd fucking kill me.

1074
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:20,860
换上这些衣服吧  然后快点离开本地
So take these clothes, put them on and get the fuck out of here.

1075
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:23,570
莱纳  快走吧
Come on, Leonard. Just go.

1076

1077
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:43,100
"不要受他骗"

1078
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,180
你胡说
You are full of shit.

1079
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:50,060
"下班后来找娜塔莉娅"
"Come by after. Natalie."

1080

"Ferdy's Bar."

1081
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:26,680
"费迪斯酒吧"

1082
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,810
杰米
Hey, Jimmy.

1083
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:41,650
对不起  我认错了人
I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else.

1084
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,650
对不起
Sorry.

1085
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:45,740
不要紧
That's okay.

1086
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:56,200
"下班后来找娜塔莉娅"

1087
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,170
杰米•格兰斯在女友的酒吧贩毒？
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out ofthe bar where his girlfriend works?

1088
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:06,510
他不会带她来  他会自己来吧？
But he's not gonna bring her along. He'll come by himself, right?

1089
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:10,810
最好以贩毒罪名指控他
I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.

1090
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:15,020
探长  我随时都准备好
No, Officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1091
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:18,270

You're in the lobby? What do you look like?

1092
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:21,530

01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:14,160

1098
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,440
- 是探长还是盖玛探员？  - 知道吗？
- Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?      - You know what?

1099
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,740
不要写姓盖玛  写泰迪好了
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1100
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,450

- 我的电话在下面   - 你不来？
- My number's on the bottom if you need me.      - You're not coming?

1103
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:59,830
不来  不方便去
No. It wouldn't be appropriate.

1104
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:07,460
拍得不错  拍得我瘦了些
Nice picture. I look thin.

1105
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:12,470
莱尼
Hey, Lenny.

1106
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:14,560

Make him beg.

1110
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:56,110
- 你在这里做什么？ - 你是杰米•格兰斯？
- What the fuck are you doing here?      - You Jimmy Grants?

1111
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,200
还有另一个杰米吗？白痴
Expecting any other Jimmys out here, Memory Man?

1112
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:02,540
- 你记得我？ - 我记得你
- Do you remember me?      - Yeah, I remember you.

1113
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:05,040
泰迪在哪里？
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1114
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:05,830
怎么样？
Well?

1115

脱掉
Strip!

1118
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:23,980
我的拍档不是善男信女
My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off.

1119
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,640
住口
Don't say anything else.

1120
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:28,150
- 早知到那贱种不可靠   - 脱掉
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!      - Take it off.

1121
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,320

- 把钱拿走吧！    - 我不要你的臭钱！
- Take the money and walk away!      - I don't want your fuckin' money.

1128
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:53,960

- 你要什么？  - 我想要回我的生活
- What do you want from me?      - I want my fuckin' life back!

1131
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:38,820
他说萨米  他认识萨米？
He said "Sammy". How does he know about Sammy?

1132
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,280
糟糕
Oh, fuck.

1133
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,880
我做了什么？
What have I done?

1134
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:07,470
先生  帮帮忙  有人受了重伤
Mister, I need help. There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.

1135
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,810
- 需要看医生   - 好
- We gotta get him to a doctor.      - All right.

1136
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,900
我不知道发生了什么  我有失忆症
I don't know what happened. I've got this memory thing.

1137
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:16,190
- 我认识你吗？ - 不认识  我是警察
- Do I know you?      - No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

你们在这里干什么？
What the hell were you guys doing down here?

1140
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:26,070
我不记得  我有病
I don't remember. I have this condition.

1141
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,870
他比你惨  他死了
I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cause this guy's dead.

1142
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:31,500
哎唷  莱尼  痛死我了
Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!

1143

So you remember me now, huh? You are a fuckin' cop.

1144
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:38,040
是我帮你找到他
Yeah. And I'm the guy that helped you find him.

1145
01:41:38,130 --> 01:41:40,010
起来  起来
Get up. Get up.

1146
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:42,130
莱尼  你误会了
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1147
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,890
他是谁？他认识我
Who is that? He knew me.

1148
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:49,600
当然  他强奸你老婆  打伤你
Of course he did. He raped your wife. He fucked up your brain.

1149
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,730
胡说！他不是凶手
Bullshit. He's not the guy.

1150
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:56,150
他叫杰米•格兰斯  又名约翰•G  查查你的纹身吧
His name is James F. Grants. John G. Check your tattoos.

1151
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:58,650
- 为什么他带20万来？ - 什么？
- What was he bringing the 200 grand for?      - What?

1152
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:03,030
- 用来干什么？ - 我告诉他我有大批安非他命
- What was it for?      - A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

1153
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:06,570
- 你们买卖毒品？ - 是  还有你的事
- Is this a drug deal?      - No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1154
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:10,290
杰米是你的仇家  我只是乘机捞油水
Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy. I just figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1155
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:14,000
- 他怎么认识我的？ - 特惠旅馆
- How did he know me?      - The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.

1156
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:17,380
旅馆的人是他朋友
The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came snooping around.

1157
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:20,000
一看你拍照  就通知杰米
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture ofthe dump.

1158
01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:22,460
- 你在利用我  - 不  你分得一半的钱
- You're fucking using me.      - No! You get half!

1159
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:25,180
他认识萨米！怎么会认识萨米？
He knew about Sammy! Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1160
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:28,640
你见人就说萨米的事
You tell everybody about Sammy, everybody who'll listen.

1161
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:30,850
"记得萨米•杰克斯吗？"
"Remember Sammy Jankis?" "Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1162
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:33,850
你愈说愈精彩
Great story. Gets better every time you tell it.

1163
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:36,730
这也没什么错  我们都这么做
So you lie to yourself to be happy.

1164
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:38,860
你在自己骗自已
There's nothing wrong with that. We all do it.

1165
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:42,070
你只记得你想记得的事
Who cares if there's a few little details you'd rather not remember?

1166
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:46,860
- 你说什么？ - 不知道
- What the fuck are you talking about?      - I don't know.

1167
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:49,570
你太太事后还活着
Your wife surviving the assault.

1168
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:52,290
她不相信你有病
Her not believing your condition.

1169
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:56,540
她内心痛苦无比
The torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside.

1170
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:58,420
胰岛素
The insulin.

1171
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:02,420
那是萨米  不是我
That's Sammy, not me. I told you about Sammy.

1172
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:05,510
对  你不断这样对自己说
Yeah, right. Like you tell yourselfover and over again.

1173
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,590
用惯性法来帮自己记忆
Conditioning yourself to remember.

1174
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:10,260
- 用重复又重复的方法来学习   - 萨米让太太自杀
- Learning through repetition.      - Sammy let his wife kill herself.

1175
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:15,390
- 萨米进了医院   - 萨米是老千  是假装的
- Sammy ended up in an institution.      - Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1176
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,640
我从没说萨米假装
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1177
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:20,690
你暴露出他的真面目...他的骗局
You exposed him for what he was... a fraud.

1178
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:22,730
不过  我是错的
But I was wrong. That's the whole point.

1179
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,550
- 萨米的妻子来找我   - 萨米没有妻子
- See, Sammy's wife came to me.      - Sammy didn't have a wife.

1180
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:32,240
你的妻子才有糖尿病
It was your wife who had diabetes.

1181
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:39,620
疼
Ouch.

1182
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,920
我太太没有糖尿病
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1183
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,340
你肯定？
You sure?

1184
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:54,260
- 不要！  - 她没有糖尿病
- Ouch. Cut it out.      - She wasn't diabetic.

1185
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:59,060
我难道不清楚我太太？你有什么不妥？
You think I don't know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong with you?

1186
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:02,560
你只记得你想记得的事
I guess I can only make you remember the things you wanna be true.

1187
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:05,030
- 就像杰米一样    - 他不是我的仇人
- Like old Jimmy down there.      - He's not the right guy.

1188
01:44:05,110 --> 01:44:07,280
对你来说  他是
He was to you.

1189
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:10,780
你报了仇  趁记得  好好开心吧
Come on. You got your revenge. Enjoy it while you still remember.

1190
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:13,370
是不是真正的仇人  有什么关系？
What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?

1191
01:44:13,450 --> 01:44:16,080
- 有很大的关系   - 你反正不会记得的
- It makes all the difference.      - Why? You're never gonna know.

1192
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:17,450
- 我会的   - 你不会
- Yes, I will.      - No, you won't.

1193
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:19,000
我会的  我总之会的
I will. Somehow I'll know.

1194
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,500
- 你不会记得！   - 这次我会
- You won't remember!      - When it's done, I will know. It'll be different.

1195
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:26,000
我本来以为你会  但你记不得
I thought so too. In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

1196
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:31,550
对  真正的约翰•G
That's right. The real John G.

1197
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:35,220
一年多前我帮你找到他  他已经死了
I helped you find him over a year ago. He's already dead.

1198
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:38,180
- 不要再骗我   - 莱尼
- Don't lie to me anymore.      - Look, Lenny.

1199
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:41,690
你太太的档案是我给你的  我相信你
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case. I believed you.

1200
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:44,310
认为你应该报仇
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

1201
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,690
我帮你找到另外的凶手
I'm the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night...

1202
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:50,110
那个打你的头  强奸你老婆的人
the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.

1203
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:53,160
我们找到他  你杀了他
We found him. You killed him.

1204
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:59,660
可是你记不得  于是我帮你再去找
But you didn't remember. So I helped you start looking again...

1205
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:02,500
找那个你已经杀掉的人
Looking for the guy you already killed.

1206
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:04,290
是吗？那么他是谁？
Yeah? So who was he?

1207
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:06,750
是谁有什么关系？
Just some guy. Does it even matter who?

1208
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:11,380
没有原因  也没有阴谋  只是倒霉罢了
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy. Just bad fucking luck.

1209
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:16,350
两个吸毒的以为你太太独自在家  搞出了事
Couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1210
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:21,310
你杀了他  我还以为你记得
But when you killed him, I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1211
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:23,850
不过  你忘掉了
But it didn't stick.

1212
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:27,290
什么都不记得  这次也不会记得
Like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.

1213
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:36,490
照片是我拍的  在你报仇的时候拍的
I took that picture... just when you did it.

1214
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:39,910
看  你多开心
Look how happy you are.

1215
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:43,000
我想你再开心点
I wanted to see that face again.

1216
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,880
- 多谢啊  - 你这个混蛋
- Gee, thanks.      - Fuck you.

1217
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:49,710
你有仇报  生活就有目的
I gave you a reason to live, and you were more than happy to help.

1218
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:53,970
你记不得真相  你自已制造真相
You don't want the truth. You make up your own truth.

1219
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:56,010
例如那警察档案
Like your police file.

1220
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,850
谁撕掉里面的12页纸？
It was complete when I gave it to you. Who took out the 12 pages?

1221
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:02,480
- 可能是你    - 不是我  是你
- You, probably.      - No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1222
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,270
- 我为什么撕掉？ - 为了替自己制造一个解不开的谜
- Why would I do that?      - To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1223
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,270
你知道有多少个镇吗？
You know how many towns?

1224
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,530
有多少个约翰•G？
How many John G.'s or James G.'s?

1225
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:12,650
我就是个约翰•G
Shit, Lenny. I'm a fucking John G.

1226
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:15,990
- 你叫泰迪    - 我妈妈叫我泰迪
- Your name is Teddy.      - My mother calls me Teddy.

1227
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:18,950
我的姓名是约翰•爱德华•盖玛
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1228
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,080

Cheer up.

1229
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:22,910
你要找  不愁没有约翰•G
There's plenty of John G.'s for us to find.

1230
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:28,710
你只知道发牢骚
All you do is moan.

1231
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:31,130
只有我知道你做过什么
I'm the one that has to live with what you've done.

1232
01:46:31,210 --> 01:46:32,920
我在幕后指导
I'm the one that put it all together.

1233
01:46:33,010 --> 01:46:37,680
你只是在扮侦探  你活在梦中
You wander around, you're playing detective. You're living a dream, kid.

1234
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:41,850
为亡妻怀念  有生活的目的
A dead wife to pine for. A sense of purpose to your life.

1235
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:45,870
即使没有我  你也不会罢手
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end even if I wasn't in the picture.

- 我应该杀了你   - 收手吧  莱尼
- I should kill you.      - Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1237
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:53,420
你不是杀手  所以你才那么在行
You're not a killer. That's why you're so good at it.

1238
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:59,120
干什么？知道几点吗？
What are you doing? You know what time it is?

1239
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,280
喝啤酒去吧  我请客
It's beer o'clock. I'm buying.

1240
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:04,410
操
Fuck.

1241

我不是杀手
I'm not a killer.

I'm just someone who wanted to make things right.

1245
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:37,760
"不要受他的骗"

1246
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:48,500
应不应该忘记你让我做的事？
Can I just let myself forget what you made me do?

1247
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:05,010
你以为我想再去解另一个谜？
You think I just want another puzzle to solve?

1248
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:07,520
再去找另一个约翰•G？
Another John G. To look for?

1249
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:10,600
你也是约翰•G
You're a John G.

1250

Yes, I will.

Hey, that's not your car!

- It is now.      - Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1258
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:51,980

- Why not?      - Because the guy you just killed owns it!

有人会认得
Somebody'll recognize it!

被人误当成死人  比误当成杀手好
I think I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

帮我找车钥匙
Help me find my keys.

我要相信世界不是我想象出来的
I have to believe in a world outside my own mind.

1266
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:38,110
我要相信我所做的事仍然有意义
I have to believe that my actions still have meaning...

世界仍然存在
the world's still here.

1270

我相不相信世界仍然存在？
Do I believe the world's still here?

1271
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:55,790
世界仍然存在？
Is it still out there?

Yeah.
