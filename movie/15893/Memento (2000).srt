00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,510
(Cries out)

2
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,872
So where are you?

3
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,916
You're in some motel room.

4
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,070
Youjust wake up and you're in...

5
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,355
..in a motel room. There's the key.

6
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,955
lt feels like maybe it's the first time
you've been here but...

7
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,508
..perhaps you've been there for a week,...

8
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,068
..three months, it's...

9
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,276
lt's kind of hard to say, l... l don't know.

10
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,351
lt'sjust an anonymous room.

11
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,037
This guy. He's here already.

12
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,989
Lenny!

13
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,352
lt's Leonard.

14
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,992
- Like l told you before.
- Did you? l must have forgot.

15
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,670
l guess l've already told you
about my condition.

16
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,320
Oh, well, only every time l see you.

17
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,439
- My car.
- This is your car.

18
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,953
Oh, you're in a playful mood.

19
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,189
- lt's not good to make fun of a handicap.
- Just trying to have a little fun.

20
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,116
(starts engine)

21
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,878
- Roll up your window.
- Hm?

22
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,790
- lt's broken.
- l can get that fixed for you.

23
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,958
- So, where to, Sherlock?
- l got a lead on a place.

24
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,191
- What the hell you wanna go there for?
- You know it?

25
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,874
Yeah, it's just this fucked up building.
Why do you wanna go there?

26
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,116
Don't remember.

27
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,039
- Looks like somebody's home.
- Ah, that thing's been here for years.

28
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,471
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

29
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,154
Tracks? What are you, Pocahontas?

30
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,633
Come on.

31
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,230
Let's take a look inside.

32
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,156
Teddy.

33
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,233
Don't believe his lies.
He is the one. Kill him.

34
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,276
l've finally found him.

35
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,430
How long have l been looking?

36
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,516
Find anything?

37
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,916
Didn't think so.

38
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,274
Let's go, huh?

39
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,555
Oh, fuck this.

40
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,232
You're gonna pay for what you did.

41
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,918
Beg forgiveness and then you pay.

42
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,313
You don't have a clue, you freak!

43
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,029
Beg my wife's forgiveness
before l blow your brains out.

44
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,953
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

45
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,395
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.

46
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,550
Cos you read it off a fucking picture.

47
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,791
(breathless) You don't know who you are.

48
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,237
- l'm Leonard Shelby from San Francisco.
- That's who you were. That's not...

49
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,151
..what you've become.

50
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,391
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny? Come on.

51
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,716
Come on, let's go down to the basement.

52
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,633
Let's go down, you and me together.

53
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,757
Then you'll know who you really are.

54
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,836
- (Teddy) No!
- (gunshot)

55
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,356
lt'sjust an anonymous room.

56
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,829
There's nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.

57
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,275
Nothing except the Gideon Bible,...

58
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,069
..which l, of course, read religiously.
(laughs) Hm.

59
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,948
You know who you are
and you know kind of all about yourself.

60
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,716
Butjust for day-to-day stuff,
notes are really useful.

61
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,597
Sammy Jankis had the same problem
but he really had no system.

62
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,832
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount
of notes but he'd get them all mixed up.

63
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,956
You really do need a system if...

64
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,996
..ifyou're gonna make it work.

65
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,916
(presses bell)

66
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,471
- Hi.
- Hi.

67
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,677
- l'm Mr Shelby from 304.
- What can l do for you, Leonard?

68
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,557
- Um...
- Burt.

69
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,837
Burt. l'm not sure, l think
l may have asked you to hold my calls.

70
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,639
- You don't know?
- l'm not too good on the phone.

71
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,393
You said you like to look people in the eye
when you talk to them.

72
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,708
Yeah, yeah.

73
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,475
- You don't remember saying that.
- l have this condition.

74
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,835
- A condition?
- lt's my memory.

75
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,434
- Amnesia?
- No, no, it's different from that.

76
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,559
l have no short-term memory.
l know all about myself, l just...

77
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,315
Since my injury l can't make
new memories. Everything fades.

78
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,790
lf we talk for too long
l'll forget how we started...

79
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,440
..and next time l see you
l won't remember this conversation.

80
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,909
l don't even know if l've met you before.

81
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,914
So if l seem a little strange
or rude, or something, uh...

82
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,274
l've told you this before, haven't l?

83
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,273
l don't mean to mess with you
but it's so weird.

84
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,476
- You don't remember me at all?
- No.

85
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,279
- We've talked a bunch of times.
- l'm sure we have.

86
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,276
What's the last thing you remember?

87
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,436
My wife.

88
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,716
What's it like?

89
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,596
lt's like waking.

90
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,996
lt's like you just woke up.

91
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,556
That must suck.

92
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,198
lt's all backwards.

93
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,078
Like, maybe you got an idea
about what you want to do next...

94
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,276
..but you don't remember
what you just did.

95
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,828
l mean, l'm exactly the opposite...

96
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,878
- How long have l been staying here?
- Couple of days.

97
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,315
- And you're holding my calls?
- Like you said.

98
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,709
OK, but this guy's an exception.

99
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,119
You know this guy?

100
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,195
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?
- What makes you think that?

101
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,510
- l saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.

102
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,953
OK.

103
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,589
lf he calls or shows up here,
give me a call in my room, OK?

104
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,636
- What, his name's Teddy?
- Teddy, yeah.

105
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,472
All right.

106
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,638
Look, l hope my condition's
not gonna be a problem for you.

107
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,995
Not as long as you remember
to pay the bill.

108
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,556
Yeah. OK.

109
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,914
Forty.

110
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,033
This guy.

111
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,989
He's here already.

112
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,632
Lenny!

113
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,719
You really need a system
ifyou're gonna make it work.

114
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,157
You kinda learn to trust your handwriting.
lt becomes an important part ofyour life.

115
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,028
You write yourself notes.
Where you put them is really important.

116
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,714
You need ajacket that's got,
like, six pockets,...

117
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,791
..particular pockets
for particular things.

118
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,078
Youjust kinda learn to know where
things go and how the system works.

119
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,435
You have to be wary of other people
writing stuff foryou...

120
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,478
..that is not going to make sense
or is gonna lead you astray.

121
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,676
l don't know what makes people
take advantage...

122
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,716
..of somebody with this condition.

123
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,554
lfyou have a piece of information
which... is...

124
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,079
..vital, writing on your body instead of
on a piece ofpaper can be the answer.

125
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,116
lt's a permanent way of keeping a note.

126
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,156
(phone rings)

127
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,712
Who is this?

128
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,793
Remember Sammy Jankis.

129
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,155
(door opens)

130
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,270
- Sir, you left these at your table.
- Thanks.

131
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,271
Ah, Lincoln Street?

132
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,112
Just go straight out on Sixth Street,...

133
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,270
- ..go east through town...
- l'm gonna write this down.

134
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,511
- Oh, it's easy. Go straight out...
- Trust me, l need to write this down.

135
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,116
The Discount lnn.

136
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,876
Discount lnn.

137
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,596
Natalie.

138
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,838
My car.

139
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,436
Teddy.

140
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,716
John Edward Gammell.

141
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,238
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

142
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,837
Don't believe his lies.

143
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,196
(dials)

144
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,836
(ringing tone)

145
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,476
- Yeah?
- Mr Gammell?

146
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,516
- Lenny, is that you?
- John Gammell?

147
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,909
Lenny, it's Teddy.
Stay there. l'll be right over.

148
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,958
- OK. l'll be waiting.
- (line goes dead)

149
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,956
White male.

150
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,070
First name, John.

151
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,835
Last name G for Gammell.

152
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,592
Drugs.

153
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,272
License plate.

154
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,630
SG1 3...

155
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,393
..7lU.

156
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,876
lt's him.

157
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,674
l've found you, you fuck.

158
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,835
You said we talked before.
l don't remember that.

159
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,876
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.

160
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,269
l remember up until my injury,
l just can't make new memories.

161
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,510
So l can't remember talking to you.
What did we talk about?

162
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,556
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

163
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,200
l guess l tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

164
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,397
Sammy's story helps me understand
my own situation.

165
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,040
Sammy wrote himself
endless amounts of notes.

166
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,917
But he got mixed up.

167
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,229
l have a more graceful solution
to the memory problem.

168
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,756
l'm disciplined and organised.

169
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,513
l use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

170
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,876
Sammy had no drive,...

171
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,916
..no reason to make it work.

172
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,395
Me?

173
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,798
Yeah,...

174
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,836
..l got a reason.

175
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,036
(activates alarm)

176
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,358
Today, 1pm, meet Natalie for info.

177
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,519
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out ofpity.

178
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,275
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

179
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,920
- l should've explained. l have this cond...
- You did explain, Lenny.

180
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,518
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.

181
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,036
- l know, you told me.
- Then l probably told you l hated it.

182
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,951
Yeah.

183
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,838
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
lt's hard for me to...

184
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,110
Thanks.

185
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,668
So, you have information for me?

186
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,399
- ls that what your little note says?
- Yeah.

187
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,790
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper.

188
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,190
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list
and you'll end up eating your underwear.

189
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,875
l guess that's why you have
those freaky tattoos.

190
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,475
Yeah, it's tough. lt's almost impossible.

191
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,876
Look, l'm sorry l don't remember you.
lt's nothing personal.

192
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,314
l do have information for you.

193
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,830
You gave me a license-plate number.

194
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,239
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

195
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,078
Guess what name came up?

196
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,477
John Edward Gammell. John G.

197
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,788
Do you know him?

198
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,475
No. But his face on his driver's licence
looked really familiar.

199
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,120
l think he's been in the bar, maybe.

200
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,510
Here's a copy of his licence,
his registration, photo and all.

201
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,556
Are you sure you want this?

202
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,234
- Have l told you what this man did?
- Yeah.

203
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,550
Well, then you shouldn't have to ask.

204
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,790
Even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.

205
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,836
You're not even gonna know it happened.

206
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,117
My wife deserves vengeance. lt doesn't
make any difference if l know about it.

207
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,430
Just because
there are things l don't remember...

208
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,750
..doesn't make my actions meaningless.

209
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,196
The world doesn't just disappear
when you close your eyes.

210
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,830
Anyway, maybe l'll take a photograph
to remind myself.

211
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,876
Get another freaky tattoo.

212
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,110
Tell me about her again.

213
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,473
Why?

214
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,199
Because you like to remember her.

215
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,956
She was beautiful.

216
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,590
- To me she was perfect.
- No.

217
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,433
Don't just recite the words.

218
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,756
Close your eyes and remember her.

219
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,916
You can just feel the details.

220
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,711
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

221
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,038
And you can feel these extreme moments.

222
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,838
Even ifyou don't want to.

223
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,278
You put these together
and you get the feel of a person.

224
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,557
Enough to know
how much you miss them.

225
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,439
And how much you hate the person
who took them away.

226
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,192
l, um, l added an address in here.

227
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,590
lt might be useful.
lt's an abandoned place outside of town.

228
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,478
Um, l guy l knew
used to do bigger deals there.

229
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,432
lt's isolated.

230
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,476
Sounds perfect.

231
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,072
- Do l owe you any...
- l wasn't helping you for money.

232
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,276
- l'm sorry.
- lt's OK.

233
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,351
See, you have this condition.

234
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,108
You still staying at the Discount lnn?
Room 304? Left it at my place.

235
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,832
Yeah.

236
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,319
- They treating you OK?
- l don't remember.

237
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,036
You know what we have in common?

238
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,235
We are both survivors.

239
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,476
You take care, Leonard.

240
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,110
Remember Sammy Jankis.

241
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,079
l met Sammy through work. lnsurance.
l was an investigator.

242
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,549
l'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phoney.

243
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,596
l had to see through people's bullshit.

244
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,274
lt was useful experience
cos now it's my life.

245
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,511
When l meet someone,
l don't know if l've met them before.

246
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,955
l have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

247
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,191
Myjob taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was let them talk.

248
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,077
Watch the eyes and the body language.

249
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,073
lf someone scratches their nose,
experts tell you it means they're lying.

250
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,516
lt really means they're nervous. People
get nervous for all sorts of reasons.

251
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,749
lt's all about context.

252
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,796
Yeah, l was good.

253
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,792
Sammy was my first real challenge.

254
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,992
(engine starts)

255
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,117
Yo, Lenny! l thought you'd split for good.

256
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,509
- Well, things change.
- So l see.

257
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,558
- My name's Teddy.
- l guess l've told you about my condition.

258
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,474
Only every time l see ya.
Come on, l'll buy you lunch.

259
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,030
- Have l told you about Sammy Jankis?
- Mmm. Yeah.

260
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,076
l'm sick of hearing about the guy.

261
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,276
What about John G?
You think he's still here?

262
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,828
- Who?
- Johnny G, the guy you're looking for.

263
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,275
- That's why you haven't left town, right?
- Maybe.

264
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,511
- Leonard, you have to be very careful.
- Why?

265
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,558
You mentioned that maybe somebody
was trying to set you up.

266
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,153
Get you to kill the wrong guy.

267
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,676
l go on facts, not recommendations,
but thank you.

268
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,672
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.

269
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,433
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.

270
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,158
- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please.

271
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,755
No, really. Memory's not perfect,
it's not even that good. Ask the police.

272
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,149
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

273
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,629
The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

274
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,598
- They collect facts and draw conclusions.
- That's not what l'm saying.

275
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,750
Facts, not memories.

276
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,070
That's how you investigate.
l know, it's what l used to do.

277
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,948
Memory can change the shape of a room,
it can change the colour of a car.

278
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,356
And memories can be distorted.

279
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,396
They're an interpretation, not a record.

280
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,471
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

281
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,438
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

282
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,910
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

283
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,228
He destroyed my ability to live.

284
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,353
You're living.

285
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,072
Only for revenge.

286
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,356
Well, then we'll get the bastard.

287
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,510
Where are you staying?

288
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,238
The Discount lnn. l don't know what room.
l haven't got my key.

289
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,436
Probably left it in your room.

290
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,515
(rings bell)

291
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,035
Hi.

292
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,270
l'm checked in here
but l think l've misplaced my key.

293
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,433
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?

294
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,794
- l don't see my key anywhere.
- Oh, shit. This is the wrong room.

295
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,677
You're in 304. l'm sorry. l fucked up.

296
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,433
- This is not my room?
- No. Come on, let's go.

297
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,317
Then why is this my handwriting?

298
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,118
Well,... this was your room
but now you're in 304.

299
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,350
- When was l in here?
- Last week.

300
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,716
- Then l rented you another room on top.
- Why?

301
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,237
Business is slow, l mean, l told my boss
about your condition and stuff,...

302
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,958
..he said rent him another room.

303
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,190
So how many rooms am l checked into
in this shit hole?

304
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,635
Just two. So far.

305
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,436
Well,...

306
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,034
..at least you're being honest
about ripping me off.

307
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,511
- You're not going to remember anyway.
- You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

308
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,239
Leonard. Always get a receipt.

309
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,230
Oh, yeah. l'll write that down.

310
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,431
- Hey, what time is it?
- Quarter to one.

311
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,512
Excuse me.

312
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,158
Your room's...

313
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,396
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

314
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,518
l'd just become an investigator
when l came across Sammy.

315
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,149
Mr Samuel R Jankis, strangest case ever.

316
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,277
The guy's a 58-year-old,
semiretired accountant.

317
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,555
He and his wife were in this car accident,
nothing serious.

318
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,677
But he's acting funny,
he can't get a handle on what's going on.

319
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,635
The doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive.

320
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,235
Sammy can't remember anything
for more than a couple of minutes.

321
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,673
Can't work, can't do shit.

322
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,877
The medical bills pile up, his wife calls
the insurance company and l get sent in.

323
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,949
This is my first big claims investigation
so l really check into it.

324
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,589
Sammy can thinkjust fine
but he can't make new memories.

325
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,114
He can only remember things
for a couple of minutes.

326
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,837
He'd watch TV but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing,...

327
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,911
..he couldn't remember how it began.

328
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,230
He liked commercials. They were short.

329
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,151
Sammy. lt's time for my shot.

330
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,152
The crazy part was that this guy,...

331
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,674
..who couldn't follow
the plot of Green Acres any more,...

332
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,751
..could do the most complicated things,...

333
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,990
..as long as he learned them
before the accident...

334
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,510
..and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing.

335
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,273
The doctors assure me...

336
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,433
..there's a real condition, anterial-grade
memory loss, or short-term memory loss.

337
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,431
lt's rare but legit.

338
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,473
But every time l see him,...

339
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,830
..l catch this look,...

340
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,198
..this... slight look of recognition.

341
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,955
But he says he can't remember me at all.

342
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,516
Sammy, it's OK. l got it.

343
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,155
- Hi, Mr Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs Jankis.

344
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,392
Now, l can read people
and l'm thinking ''bad actor''.

345
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,074
So now l'm suspicious
and l order more tests.

346
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,316
Awake.

347
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,154
Oh, where am l?

348
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,595
Somebody's bedroom.

349
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,515
Oh, it must be her room.

350
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,436
But who is she?

351
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,871
lt's only me.

352
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,912
- Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah. You?

353
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,396
Oh, shit. Shit.

354
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,152
l gotta be someplace.

355
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,233
lt's pretty weird.

356
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,875
lt's useful. You never
write a phone number on your hand?

357
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,078
l, um, l should be able
to talk to my friend today...

358
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,118
- ..about the license plate.
- Yeah, the license plate.

359
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,555
John G's license plate.

360
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,236
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

361
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,756
Natalie.

362
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,594
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out ofpity.

363
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,517
lf it's registered in this state,...

364
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,795
..it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his licence and registration.

365
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,235
l'll call you as soon as l talk to him.

366
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,153
Could we arrange a meeting now?
l'm not too good on the phone.

367
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,270
You know, it's great that you...

368
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,232
Well, that you're...

369
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,078
..helping me...

370
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,673
..like this.

371
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,957
l'm helping you because you helped me.

372
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,955
So next time you see me,...

373
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,439
..will you remember me?

374
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,910
(softly) l think you will.

375
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,996
(softly) l'm sorry.

376
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,670
Lenny, before you go,
could l have my shirt back, please?

377
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,756
(engine starts)

378
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,158
Yo, Lenny! l thought you'd split for good.

379
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,113
Sammy couldn't pick up
any new skills at all.

380
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,509
But l find something in my research.

381
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,113
Conditioning.

382
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,033
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

383
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,317
lt's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You get better through practice.

384
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,550
lt's a different part of the brain
from the short-term memory.

385
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,076
So l had the doctors
test Sammy's response to conditioning.

386
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,119
- Pick up any three objects.
- That's a test?

387
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,475
Where were you guys when l did my CPA?

388
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,913
Sorry.

389
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,399
Ta-da!

390
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,190
- (buzz)
- Ow! What the fuck?

391
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,589
- lt's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.

392
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,112
Some of the objects were electrified.
They'd give him a shock.

393
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,192
They kept repeating the test,
always with the same objects electrified.

394
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,590
The point was to see if Sammy could
learn to avoid the electrified objects,...

395
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,830
..not by memory, but by instinct.

396
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,316
(activates alarm)

397
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,516
(knocks on door)

398
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,280
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

399
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,234
Guess l don't have to worry about him
any more.

400
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,197
- What the fuck have you got me into?
- Shh. Come inside.

401
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,153
- Who is he?
- Calm down. OK?

402
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,596
This is my problem. You offered to help.
lt's nothing to do with your investigation.

403
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,113
How did you get me into this?

404
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,156
You offered to help me
when you saw what he did to my face.

405
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,630
- How do l know he did that to your face?
- l came straight to you after he did it.

406
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,915
l showed you what he did
and l asked you to help me.

407
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,753
- Oh, and l just take your word?
- Yeah.

408
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,310
Something doesn't feel right.

409
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,709
l think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

410
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,074
- Did you?
- What?

411
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,912
Kill him?

412
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,356
- Course not!
- Hey. Sit down, OK? Sit.

413
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,795
This has nothing to do with you.
You helped me out and l'm grateful.

414
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,112
You have to burn them.

415
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,354
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust your own judgement.

416
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,750
You can question everything,
you can never know anything for sure.

417
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,400
- There are things you know for sure.
- Such as?

418
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,909
l know what that's gonna sound like
when l knock on it. (knocks)

419
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,276
l know what that's gonna feel like
when l pick it up. See?

420
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,033
Certainties. lt's the kind of memory
you take for granted.

421
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,353
You know, l can remember so much.

422
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,396
The feel of the world...

423
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,836
And her.

424
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,356
She's gone.

425
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,194
And the present is trivia
which l scribble down as fucking notes.

426
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,840
Hey, come on. Try and relax. Come on.

427
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,878
- lt's not easy for me to relax.
- Shh. Shhh.

428
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,270
Come on, take your jacket off.

429
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,555
(softly) Here. Come on.

430
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,712
(softly) Hey.

431
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,996
Didn't think you were the type.

432
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,916
lt's backwards.

433
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,440
Come here. Come here.

434
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,116
What about here?

435
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,955
Maybe it's... for when l find him.

436
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,073
l've lost somebody too.

437
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,236
l'm sorry.

438
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,151
His name was Jimmy.

439
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,515
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.

440
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,436
He never came back.

441
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,398
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.

442
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,196
What do the police think?

443
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,035
They don't look too hard
for guys like Jimmy.

444
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,240
When you find this guy, this...

445
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,437
..John G, what are you gonna do?

446
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,716
l'm gonna kill him.

447
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,119
Maybe l can help you find him.

448
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,675
l don't even know how long
she's been gone.

449
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,189
lt's like l've woken up in bed
and she's not here...

450
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,833
..because she's gone to the bathroom
or something.

451
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,315
But somehow l just...

452
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,192
l just know
she's never gonna come back to bed.

453
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,991
lf l could just...

454
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,949
..reach over
and touch her side of the bed,...

455
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,873
..l would know that it was cold.

456
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,190
But l can't.

457
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,676
l know l can't have her back.

458
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,116
But l don't want to wake up in the morning
thinking she's still here.

459
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,997
l lie here not knowing
how long l've been alone.

460
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,556
So how...

461
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,196
How can l heal?

462
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,552
How am l supposed to heal if l can't...

463
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,396
..feel time?

464
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,071
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out ofpity.

465
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,839
They kept testing Sammy for months.

466
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,753
Always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.

467
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,836
- (buzz)
- Ow! What the fuck?

468
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,229
- lt's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!

469
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,311
Even with total short-term memory loss,...

470
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,631
..Sammy should have learned instinctively
to stop picking up the wrong objects.

471
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,599
Other cases responded to conditioning,
Sammy didn't respond at all.

472
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,116
lt suggested that his condition
was psychological not physical.

473
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,557
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

474
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,996
His wife got stuck with the bills
and l got a big promotion.

475
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,434
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy,
so he became helpless.

476
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,476
But it works for me.

477
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,551
l live the way Sammy couldn't.

478
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,029
Habit and routine make my life possible.

479
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,793
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

480
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,792
(muffled cries)

481
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,556
(smash)

482
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,356
Awake.

483
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,596
Where am l?

484
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,996
Motel room.

485
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,396
Oh.

486
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,639
Some anonymous motel room.

487
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,356
Nothing in the drawers.
But l'll take a look anyway.

488
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,436
Nothing except the Gideon Bi...

489
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,317
Bible.

490
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,030
- (knock on door)
- Hey! Open up!

491
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,316
- (muffled cries)
- Just a minute!

492
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,197
Open the door!

493
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,673
- (muffled cries)
- (knocks) Lenny?

494
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,398
(knocking continues) Open the door!

495
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,356
Come on!

496
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,396
- Hi, Teddy.
- Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

497
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,718
- Oh!
- (muffled cries)

498
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,996
(sighs)

499
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,908
- (muffled cries)
- Oh, l get it.

500
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,109
- Amorous neighbours.
- What are you doing here?

501
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,749
(laughs) You called me.
You said you needed my help.

502
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,150
You know, l've had more
rewarding friendships than this one.

503
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,516
Although l do get to keep telling
the same jokes.

504
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,238
What the fuck is that?

505
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,873
Who the fuck is that?

506
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,916
- You don't know him?
- No! Should l?

507
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,079
- Wait a minute. ls that John G?
- l don't think so.

508
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,116
You don't think so?
You didn't write it down?

509
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,397
- l might have fallen asleep before l did.
- For Christ sakes!

510
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,396
Ask him.

511
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,474
What's your name? Your name?

512
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,796
- Dodd.
- And who did this to you?

513
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,836
- What?
- Who did this to you?

514
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,436
You did.

515
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,114
- l'm not going to help you kill that guy.
- No, no. Just let me think for a minute.

516
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,316
(muffled cries)

517
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,518
OK, Natalie. Who's Natalie? Natalie who?

518
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,750
- Why?
- Maybe l know her.

519
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,308
Look, we gotta get him out of here.

520
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,356
All right, all right, all right.

521
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,231
He's got to have a car, right?

522
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,471
We take him to his car, tell him to get the
fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

523
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,516
We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.

524
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,909
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- l don't know!

525
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,355
- You don't know.
- (muffled banging)

526
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,388
Yes, l do. This is not my room.
lt must be his room. Great. Let's go.

527
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,436
- No, no, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?

528
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,469
Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops. He can lD us.

529
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,353
OK. We untie him, we clean him up...

530
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,431
..and we march him out of here
with a gun in his back.

531
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,511
A gun. Why would l have a gun?

532
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,673
lt must be his. l don't think
they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

533
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,712
Fucking hope not.

534
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,756
Which one?

535
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,754
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

536
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,673
- Shut up.
- lt's all right for you, you've got the Jag.

537
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,718
All right, get in.
l'm gonna ride with him, you follow us.

538
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,756
Give me your keys.

539
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,796
Take your own car.

540
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,716
So was he scared?

541
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,631
l think it was your sinister moustache.

542
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,439
Fuck you. Should have stolen his car.

543
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,308
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?

544
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,511
So what do you do now?

545
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,672
l'm gonna find out
what the fuck that was all about.

546
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,876
(knocks)

547
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,548
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

548
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,990
Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him.

549
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,038
And fighting the company's decision.

550
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,080
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

551
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,515
l never said that Sammy was faking.

552
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,556
Sammy, l have an idea.

553
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,837
Just that his problem was mental,
not physical.

554
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,514
You're gonna have a pen in your pocket.

555
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,352
She couldn't understand.

556
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,954
- l did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!

557
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,237
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try a little harder.

558
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,198
She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person...

559
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,794
..and if it's not a physical problem,
he should snap out of it.

560
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,835
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called.

561
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,753
Ellen called.
Ellen... Ellen can't come today!

562
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,308
- Ellen can't come!
- l'm so sorry! l'm sorry!

563
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,630
- l'm trying! l'm sorry!
- (sobs)

564
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,150
So, Leonard Shelby from the insurance
company gives her the seed of doubt.

565
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,754
Just like he gave it to the doctors.

566
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,149
But l never said that he was faking.

567
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,196
l never said that.

568
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,354
Hm. l don't feel drunk.

569
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,998
(door closes)

570
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,116
(toilet flushes)

571
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,671
- Hello? Housekeeping.
- Oh, shit!

572
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,313
- Not right now!
- Oh, l'm sorry.

573
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,115
Dodd. Put him onto Teddy
orjust get rid of him for Natalie.

574
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,796
Dodd.

575
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,476
Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.

576
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,838
Teddy, Teddy.

577
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,996
(dialling tone)

578
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,596
(ringing)

579
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,196
Yeah, leave your number,
you know what to do.

580
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,192
- (beep)
- Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

581
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,350
l'm at the Mount Crest lnn on Fifth Street,
room six.

582
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,193
l need you to come over
as soon as you get this. lt's important.

583
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,316
Oh, this is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

584
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,312
Phew!

585
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,352
Fuck!

586
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,439
Mrs Jankis didn't understand that you
can't bully someone into remembering.

587
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,478
The more pressure you're under,
the harder it gets.

588
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,157
Ah. Well, then, call me back?

589
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,551
(car alarm, car horn)

590
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,756
OK. So what am l doing?

591
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,558
Oh, l'm chasing this guy.

592
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,838
No. He's chasing me.

593
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,275
(car alarm, car horn)

594
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,356
(clicks off alarm)

595
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,713
(tyres squeal)

596
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,351
Ah! Fuck!

597
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:08,074
Dodd, white guy,
Mount Crest lnn on Fifth Street.

598
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,197
l'll get thejump on you, you fucker.

599
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,156
Oh, fuck!

600
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,236
Sorry.

601
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,276
l need a weapon.

602
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,555
This'll do.

603
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,629
Hm. l don't feel drunk.

604
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,476
(clicks off alarm)

605
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,876
(car horn)

606
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,236
(car horn)

607
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,476
Do l know this guy?

608
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,350
- (car horn)
- He seems to know me.

609
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,956
- What the fuck?
- (tyres squeal)

610
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,475
- l like your car.
- Thank you.

611
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,471
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?

612
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,915
What, l haven't made
a strong enough impression on you?

613
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,560
- l wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
- (taps on window)

614
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,195
(car alarm, car horn)

615
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,395
OK. So what am l doing?

616
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,556
(phone rings)

617
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,276
Who is this?

618
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,916
(clicks off alarm)

619
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,476
(activates car alarm)

620
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,118
Ouch! Cut it out.

621
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,677
- How can you read that again?
- lt's good.

622
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,276
- You've read it, like, a thousand times.
- l enjoy it.

623
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,114
l thought the pleasure of a book was
in wanting to know what happens next.

624
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,590
Don't be a prick.
l'm not reading it to annoy you. l enjoy it.

625
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,994
Just let me read. Please?

626
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,550
Probably tried this before.

627
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,752
Probably burned truckloads ofyour stuff.

628
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,240
Can't remember to forget you.

629
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,273
Yeah.

630
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,396
Uh-huh.

631
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,474
Well, sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

632
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,552
l was hoping for more on the drugs angle.
Will you hang on a sec?

633
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,919
The police report mentioned the drugs
found in the car outside my house.

634
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,991
The car was stolen.
His prints were all over it.

635
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,036
l got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy.

636
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,997
l dealt with the police a lot
in my insurance job.

637
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:52,438
With my condition it's really tough.
l can't keep it all in mind at once.

638
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,158
l have to summarise the sections.

639
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,312
There are pages missing.
l guess l've been trying to log them all.

640
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,550
l don't know why these are crossed out.

641
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,631
They weren't even looking for John G.

642
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,393
The stuff they found in the car fit in with
what they believed had happened,...

643
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,550
..so they didn't chase it up.

644
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,556
(door slams)

645
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,753
Honey?

646
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,116
Honey, it's late.

647
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,076
Everything OK?

648
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,753
(muffled cry)

649
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,872
(taps on door)

650
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,149
- (muffled gasp)
- You OK in there?

651
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,394
(sniffs) Was it good for you?

652
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,436
(laughs softly)

653
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,273
What? Was l supposed to lock the door?

654
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,152
(softly) No.

655
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,396
l'd like you to leave now.

656
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,716
(clicks off alarm)

657
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,476
There's something about the drugs
stashed in the car that doesn't ring true.

658
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,599
The police claim the guy was an addict
needing money to score. lt's bullshit.

659
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,832
He's not gonna go breaking into places
while he's still got a stash that big.

660
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,588
Well, l think John G left it there.
Or planted it there.

661
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,316
How do you know that?

662
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,156
Oh, shit, that's true. lt fits.

663
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,196
So he's a dealer.

664
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,670
Hang on a sec.

665
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,110
Now we're getting somewhere.

666
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,114
Discount lnn.

667
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,476
(activates alarm)

668
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,996
(activates alarm)

669
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,398
Yeah, OK.

670
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,436
Blonde's fine.

671
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,196
Well, that's what they say.

672
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,195
The Discount lnn. 304.

673
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,992
Leonard.

674
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,913
Well, what then?

675
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,958
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.

676
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,156
You go into the bathroom
and slam the door.

677
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,674
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

678
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,591
- And that's it?
- That's it.

679
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,075
Ah...

680
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,198
Yeah, first l just need you
to put these things around the room.

681
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,195
Pretend they're your things
and this is your bedroom.

682
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,110
- Should l wear it?
- No, no, no. Uh, just like you took it off.

683
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,318
l don't want you to use it. l'm sorry.

684
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,239
l just mean put them around the room,
as if they were your... your things.

685
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,716
Whatever gets you off.

686
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,236
(door slams)

687
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,951
l can't blame the cops
for not taking me seriously.

688
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,838
This is a difficult condition to understand.
Look at Sammy Jankis.

689
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,911
His own wife couldn't deal with it.

690
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,594
l told you how she tried to get him
to snap out of it.

691
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,910
She came to see me at the office.
l found out all kinds of shit.

692
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,356
She told me about life with Sammy.
How she treated him.

693
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,839
Thank you for seeing me.

694
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,480
She'd get Sammy to hide food
around the house,...

695
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,233
..then she'd stop feeding him to see
if his hunger would make him remember.

696
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,471
l've taken him to a parking lot and, uh...

697
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,996
She wasn't a cruel person.
Shejust wanted her old Sammy back.

698
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,753
You know all about Sammy
and you've decided he's faking.

699
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,479
The company's position
isn't that Sammy's faking anything,...

700
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,755
..just that his condition
can't be shown to be...

701
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,717
l just want to know
your honest opinion about Sammy.

702
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,551
We shouldn't be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

703
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,791
- l'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?

704
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,557
Try to understand, when l look at Sammy,
l don't see some... vegetable.

705
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,074
l see my same old Sammy.

706
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,796
What do you think that's like for me,...

707
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,917
..to suspect that he might be imagining
this whole problem?

708
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,991
That if l just could say the right thing,...

709
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,073
..he'd snap out of it
and go back to being normal.

710
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,396
lf l...

711
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,837
lf l knew that my old Sammy
were truly gone,...

712
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,710
..then l could say goodbye
and start loving this new Sammy.

713
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,478
As long as l have doubt
l can't say goodbye and move on.

714
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,516
What do you want from me?

715
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,558
l want you to forget the company
you work for for thirty seconds...

716
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,916
..and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition.

717
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,156
l need to know...

718
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,675
..what you honestly believe.

719
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,554
l believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.

720
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,192
Thank you.

721
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,636
l thought l'd helped her.

722
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,554
l thought she just needed an answer.
l didn't think it was important what it was.

723
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,720
Just that she had one to believe.

724
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,479
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

725
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,279
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it!

726
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,113
Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!

727
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,673
- Jeez!
- What the fuck are you doing in my car?

728
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,151
What, your sense of humour went with the
memory? Do you know why you're here?

729
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,196
- Unfinished business.
- Lenny,...

730
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,955
..let me inform you,
your business here is very much finished.

731
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,918
- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?

732
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,754
Schmuck! Whose house
do you think you just walked out of?

733
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:00,319
That's right, take a look at your pictures.
l bet you got one of her.

734
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,595
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz(!)

735
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,280
You'll want to make a note.
You can't trust her.

736
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,679
Why's that?

737
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,957
Because by now
she's taken a look at the suit and the car...

738
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:16,033
..and she's figuring out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.

739
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,036
She's already got you staying with her,
for Christ sakes. You can't go back there.

740
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,951
Let me give you the name of a motel.

741
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,554
You're lucky l ran into you.
That broad's bad news.

742
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,030
- What do you mean, ''bad news''?
- She's involved with drugs.

743
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,348
Look. See these?

744
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,275
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

745
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,999
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

746
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,640
He writes messages
on the back of these,...

747
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,280
..then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

748
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,194
- Why should l care?
- Because when she gets jammed up,...

749
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,236
..she's gonna use you to protect herself.

750
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,753
From who?

751
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,354
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.

752
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,635
Guys are gonna come after her.

753
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,439
Somebody's got to pay, Lenny.
Somebody always pays.

754
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,873
Maybe she'll make it you.

755
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,316
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe she'll make it you. ls that it?

756
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,516
You worried
that she's gonna use me against you?

757
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,556
- No.
- Why not?

758
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,438
Because she doesn't know who l am.

759
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,833
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe l wanna help.

760
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,879
She doesn't know anything
about your investigation. OK, Einstein?

761
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,030
So write this down.

762
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,559
When she offers to help,
it'll be for her own reasons.

763
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,551
l'm not lying.
Take my pen, write this down.

764
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,756
Do not trust her.

765
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,556
There. You happy now?

766
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,393
- l won't be happy until you leave town.
- Why not?

767
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,358
You ever wonder
how long you can hang around here...

768
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,670
- ..before people start asking questions?
- What sort of questions?

769
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,796
The same questions
you should be asking yourself.

770
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,474
- Like what?
- Like how did you get this suit, the car?

771
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,959
- l have money.
- From what?

772
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,271
My wife's death. l used to work
in insurance. We were well covered.

773
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,112
Oh!

774
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,672
So in your grief
you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?

775
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,714
You don't have a clue, do you?
You don't even know who you are.

776
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,028
Yes, l do.

777
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,635
l don't have amnesia. l remember
everything right up until the incident.

778
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,676
l am Leonard Shelby,
l am from San Francisco...

779
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,716
That's who you were.

780
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,236
You do not know who you are.
What you've become since...

781
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,796
..the incident.

782
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:29,636
You wander around playing detective.
You don't even know how long ago it was.

783
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,277
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?

784
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,955
- l didn't sell insurance, l investigated it.
- Right, right. You're an investigator.

785
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:44,231
- Maybe you should investigate yourself.
- Oh, thank you for the advice.

786
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,793
Look, do me a favour,
don't go back in there.

787
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,472
Will you take the motel out of town?

788
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,195
lt's been fun, Lenny.

789
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,516
Do not trust her.

790
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,076
Don't believe his lies.

791
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,520
Oh, fuck it. l need my own place.

792
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,116
(starts engine)

793
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,073
No. She shouldn't have given me
that responsibility.

794
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,796
l'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.

795
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,150
Yeah, yeah, l guess.

796
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,754
l've got all sorts of other considerations.

797
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,149
Legal responsibility, large financ...

798
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,118
- Who is this?
- (line goes dead)

799
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,868
Write this down.
Write down what happened.

800
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,350
Write it down. Come on, concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a p...

801
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,193
- What happened?
- He beat the shit out of me.

802
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,633
Who?

803
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,193
Who?

804
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,755
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

805
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,909
Why?

806
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,310
Because of you! Because l did what
you told me to do, reason with him,...

807
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,836
- ..tell him about Teddy. Great idea!
- Calm down. Calm down, take it easy.

808
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,672
You're safe. lt's OK.

809
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,351
Come on. Just sit down. Sit down.

810
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,590
Here, sit down.

811
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,036
OK. You're OK.

812
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,873
l'll just get some ice for your face.

813
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,352
Here.

814
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,078
l did exactly what you told me to do.

815
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,196
l went to Dodd...

816
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,314
..and l told him
that l didn't have any of Jimmy's money,...

817
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,596
..or the drugs.

818
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:16,832
And that this Teddy
must have taken everything.

819
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,478
And what did he say?

820
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,915
He didn't believe me.

821
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,911
He said if l don't have the drugs
by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

822
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,834
And then he just...
he just started hitting me.

823
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,596
Where is he?

824
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,478
- Why?
- l'll go see him.

825
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,633
l'll give him some bruises of his own
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

826
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,070
Oh, he'll kill you, Lenny.

827
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,278
- My wife used to call me Lenny.
- Yeah?

828
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,716
Yeah, l hated it.

829
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:56,552
Oh, this guy is so dangerous.
Let's just think of something else, OK?

830
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,789
No, no, no.
You just tell me what he looks like.

831
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,314
And where l can find him.
Have you got a pen?

832
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,156
ln my purse.

833
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,594
He'll, um,... he'll probably find you.

834
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,908
What do you mean?

835
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,877
l told him about your car.

836
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,552
Why?

837
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,838
He was beating the shit out of me,
l had to tell him something.

838
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,396
Just write it all down.

839
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,876
Be careful.

840
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,036
l'll be fine.

841
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,718
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

842
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,554
(phone rings)

843
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,156
(phone rings)

844
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,910
Front desk? Burt, right.
This is Mr Shelby in room 21 .

845
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,876
Yeah, that's it, l don't want any calls.

846
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,916
No, none at all.

847
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,795
(door opens)

848
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,350
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

849
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,396
- Who?
- Calls himself Dodd.

850
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,833
What does he want?

851
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,753
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy
and his money. He thinks l took it.

852
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,875
Did you?

853
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,193
No.

854
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,595
- What's this all about?
- You don't have a fucking clue, do you?

855
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,716
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't you?

856
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,395
- Look, l have this condition.
- l know all about your fucking condition!

857
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,870
l probably know more about it than you,
you don't have a clue about anything else.

858
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,669
- What happened?
- Jimmy went to meet a guy named Teddy.

859
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,320
He took a lot of money with him
and never came back.

860
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,278
Jimmy's partners think l set him up.
l don't know if you know this Teddy.

861
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,432
- Neither do l.
- Don't protect him! Help me.

862
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,478
- How?
- Get rid of Dodd for me.

863
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,915
- What?
- Kill him. l'll pay you.

864
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,912
What do you think l am?
l'm not gonna kill someone for money.

865
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,549
What, then? Love?
What would you kill for?

866
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,234
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.

867
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,835
- Not to me, l wasn't married to her!
- Hey, don't talk about my wife.

868
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,876
l can talk about whoever the fuck l want!

869
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,315
l can say whatever l want
and you won't remember!

870
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,470
l can call your wife a fucking whore
and we can still be friends.

871
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,118
- Calm down.
- You can't get scared!

872
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,794
You don't know how, you fucking idiot!

873
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,791
This has nothing to do with me.

874
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,668
How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!

875
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,877
- Hey, can you get angry?
- Yes.

876
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,155
You pathetic piece of shit!

877
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:00,598
l can say whatever the fuck l want and
you won't have a clue, you fucking retard!

878
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:04,639
l'm gonna use you. l'm telling you now
because l'm gonna enjoy it much more...

879
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:08,633
..if l know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak.

880
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,109
Did you lose your pen? Too bad, freak.

881
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:15,034
Otherwise you could write yourself a note
about how much Natalie hates your guts...

882
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,951
..and that l called your wife a whore!

883
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,951
- Don't say another fucking word!
- About your whore of a wife?

884
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,399
l read about your condition, Leonard.

885
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:30,679
You know one of the causes of short-term
memory loss? Venereal disease.

886
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,512
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife...

887
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:36,195
..sucked one too many diseased cocks
and turned you into a retard!

888
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,639
(softly) You sad, sad freak.

889
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,829
l can say whatever the fuck l want
and you won't remember.

890
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,280
We'll still be best friends.

891
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,115
Or maybe even lovers.

892
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,395
Fuck!

893
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,276
l'll see you soon.

894
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,956
- (door opens and closes)
- Stay focused.

895
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,996
Find a pen.

896
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,435
l'm gonna write this down.
l'm gonna write it down.

897
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,116
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate.

898
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,556
Keep it in mind,
keep it in mind, keep it in mind.

899
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,035
Come on. l've got to find a pen.
l've got to find a pen.

900
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,908
Now, write this down, write this down.
Exactly what happened.

901
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,639
l'm gonna write down what happened.
Come on, come on! l've got to find a pen!

902
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,598
Jeez! Come on! Come on, keep focused.

903
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,510
Keep focused.

904
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,151
Keep... Keep it in mind.
Come on, find a pen.

905
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,674
Write this note.
Write down what happened. Write it down.

906
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,990
Come on, concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a p...

907
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,389
What happened?

908
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,436
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

909
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,476
- Who?
- Who?

910
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,757
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

911
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,076
- (knock at door)
- Hello?

912
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,470
lt's Burt, from the front desk.

913
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,433
Yeah?

914
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,672
l know you said you didn't want any calls
but this guy on the phone says he's a cop.

915
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,716
- A cop?
- Yeah.

916
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,917
He says you're really gonna wanna know
what he has to say.

917
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,151
l'm not too good on the phone.
l need to look people in the eye.

918
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,719
Well, what...

919
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,312
You can, um, you can crash on the couch.

920
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,153
lt's comfortable. Just have a seat.

921
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,992
Thanks.

922
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,035
So, how long do you think
it's gonna take you?

923
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,435
Hm?

924
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,876
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife.

925
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:07,997
Oh, it depends on if he's here in town
or if he's moved on. l have my file here.

926
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,756
Can l ask you something?

927
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:17,039
lf you have all that information,
why haven't the police found him for you?

928
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,318
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?

929
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,913
They don't think he exists.

930
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:28,917
You see, l told them what l remembered.
l was asleep. Something woke me up.

931
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,312
(clock ticks)

932
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,949
Her side of the bed was cold.
She'd obviously been gone for a while.

933
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,793
(muffled cry)

934
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,199
(muffled cry)

935
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,199
(muffled cry)

936
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,795
(crash)

937
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,274
There had to be a second man.

938
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,835
Somebody hit me from behind.
l remember.

939
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,512
lt's the last thing l do remember.

940
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,194
Look, the police didn't believe me.
lf we check...

941
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,955
How did they explain what you
do remember? The gun and stuff?

942
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,636
John G was clever.

943
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,712
He was clever.

944
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,555
He took the dead man's gun and
replaced it with the sap he hit me with.

945
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,599
He left my gun and the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.

946
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:07,196
They found the sap with my blood on it
in the dead man's hand.

947
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,589
And they only found my gun.

948
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,433
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

949
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:16,235
l was the only guy who disagreed
with the facts and l had brain damage.

950
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,035
The cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.

951
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,759
Leonard. You can stay here
for a couple of days if it will help you.

952
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,316
Oh, thanks.

953
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,837
l have to go back to work,
so, um, just make yourself at home.

954
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,275
You can watch TV or have some food.

955
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,794
Whatever you want, OK?
Make yourself at home.

956
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,359
One thing.

957
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,991
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.

958
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,436
Natalie.

959
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,713
(door opens)

960
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,076
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

961
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,390
(phone rings)

962
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,556
(phone rings)

963
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,756
(ringing stops)

964
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,798
(phone rings)

965
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,318
- On the house.
- Thanks.

966
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,319
(laughs)

967
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:19,234
My, you really do have a problem.
Just like that cop said.

968
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,517
- Hm?
- Your condition.

969
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,470
Well, nobody's perfect.

970
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,789
What's the last thing
that you do remember?

971
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,836
- My wife.
- That's sweet.

972
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:35,750
Dying.

973
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,955
l remember my wife dying.

974
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,233
Let me, um, get you another one.

975
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,197
l think this one's dusty.

976
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,078
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?

977
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:58,516
l know you're a cop. What do you want?
Have l done something wrong?

978
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,155
l don't know, something bad, maybe.

979
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,875
Look, why are you asking me?
l can't remember what l've done.

980
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,916
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

981
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,833
Because of my condition, you don't
believe someone with this condition.

982
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,514
Nobody believed Sammy!
l didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

983
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,276
Ferdy's bar.

984
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,749
Come by after. Natalie.

985
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,957
- A beer, please.
- What do you want?

986
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:36,995
A beer, please.

987
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,389
You can't just waltz in here
dressed like that and ask for a beer.

988
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,710
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?

989
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,633
- l'm meeting someone called Natalie.
- Well, that's me.

990
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,314
Yeah, we met before, right?

991
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,310
- Then why am l here?
- l don't know, why don't you tell me?

992
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,356
l don't remember.
l have no short-term memory.

993
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,158
Oh, you're that memory guy.

994
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,835
- How do you know about me?
- My boyfriend told me about you.

995
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,674
- Oh, yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

996
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,193
No.

997
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:09,400
He knows you. He told me about you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.

998
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,631
ln fact, a cop came by earlier
and was looking for you.

999
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,756
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything,...

1000
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,796
..wouldn't know how he'd got here
or what he'd done.

1001
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,711
l get a lot of guys round here like that.

1002
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:23,078
Chronic alcoholism
is one cause of short-term memory loss.

1003
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,678
- Are you Teddy?
- No, my name's Leonard.

1004
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,796
- Did Teddy send you?
- l don't know.

1005
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,356
What's happened to Jimmy?

1006
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:35,989
- l don't know that, either. Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?

1007
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,516
You don't remember where you've been
or what you've just done?

1008
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,956
l can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.

1009
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,719
- Then why did you come here?
- l found this in my pocket.

1010
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,916
Your pocket?

1011
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,873
(man hawks)

1012
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,999
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

1013
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,435
- No, thanks.
- lt's for a lot of money.

1014
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,554
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

1015
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,596
(hawks)

1016
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,198
Thank you.

1017
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,398
- On the house.
- Thanks.

1018
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,156
(man laughs)

1019
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:02,436
lt's completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

1020
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:06,029
lt's amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

1021
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,350
l guess it's poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

1022
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:13,036
You know the truth about my condition,
officer? You don't know anything.

1023
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,989
You feel angry, you don't know why.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

1024
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,436
You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea ten minutes later.

1025
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,398
Like Sammy.
What if l'd done something like Sammy?

1026
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,234
l didn't tell you?
What happened to Sammy and his wife?

1027
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,390
She came to see me at my office.

1028
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:35,190
l didn't tell her what l really thought
but l never said that he was faking.

1029
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,396
Just that his condition was mental,
not physical.

1030
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,994
l found out later that she went home
and gave Sammy his final exam.

1031
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,479
Sammy? lt's time for my shot.

1032
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,798
She knew beyond a doubt
that he loved her,

1033
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,474
so she found a way to test him.

1034
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,396
Sammy? lt's time for my shot.

1035
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,276
Hm.

1036
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,875
- She really thought she'd call his bluff.
- There you go.

1037
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,476
Or shejust didn't want to live with
the things she'd put him through.

1038
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,193
Sammy?

1039
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,633
lt's time for my shot.

1040
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,278
lt won't hurt.

1041
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,471
She went into a coma
and never recovered.

1042
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,677
Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.

1043
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,715
Oh!

1044
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:54,078
He's been in a home ever since.
He doesn't even know his wife is dead.

1045
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:57,391
l was wrong about Sammy
and l was wrong about his wife.

1046
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,473
She wasn't interested in the money.
She needed to understand his problem.

1047
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,109
His brain didn't respond to conditioning
but he wasn't a con man.

1048
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:08,476
And when she looked into his eyes,
she thought he could be the same person.

1049
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,551
When l looked into his eyes,
l thought l saw recognition.

1050
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,596
Now l know you fake it.

1051
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,638
lf you think you're supposed to recognise
somebody, you pretend to.

1052
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:19,156
You bluff it to get a pat on the head
from the doctors.

1053
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,198
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1054
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,796
What drug dealer?

1055
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,516
(tyres squeal)

1056
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,352
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- lt's private back here.

1057
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,318
- lt's OK, we know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know l was in here?

1058
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,311
The Jag's out front.

1059
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,278
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlours up north.

1060
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,716
l guess l wanted to get something down
before it slipped my mind.

1061
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,677
- Give me the keys, l'll move it.
- lt'll be all right.

1062
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,716
- Wait out there.
- Oh, for Christ...

1063
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,836
Give me a minute,
l've got to get something for you.

1064
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,670
Fact six. Car licence SG13 7lU.

1065
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:27,718
Look, wait a minute, will ya?

1066
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,475
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?

1067
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,393
Oh, man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times l gotta tell you?

1068
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,835
- lt's not safe for you to hang around.
- Why not?

1069
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,117
Because that cop's looking for you.
l gotta get you a new identity,...

1070
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:44,431
..some new clothes, a different car
would do for now. Put these on.

1071
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,317
Whoa, whoa. What cop?

1072
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:50,313
He's a bad cop. He's the one
that checked you into the Discount lnn.

1073
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:54,154
He's been calling you for days, slipping
envelopes under your door, shit like that.

1074
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:58,074
- How do you know this?
- He told me. He's been laughing at you.

1075
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,513
- You're full of shit.
- No, l'm not.

1076
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,556
He knows you're no good on the phone
so he's been calling you up.

1077
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,551
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

1078
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:06,313
..so he slips shit under your door
to scare you into answering it,...

1079
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:11,349
..giving you a line of crap about John G
being a local drug dealer. Jimmy Grants.

1080
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,113
- Who's Jimmy Grants?
- Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1081
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,556
The cop wants to know how his operation
is run. He's got some score in mind.

1082
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:20,074
- Somehow you're involved.
- How do you know him?

1083
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:25,598
l'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.

1084
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,950
lf he knew l was helping you,
he'd fucking kill me.

1085
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:31,669
So take these clothes, put them on
and get the fuck out of here.

1086
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,557
Come on, Leonard, just go.

1087
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,871
You are full of shit.

1088
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,591
Come by after. Natalie.

1089
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,071
Ferdy's bar.

1090
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,153
(knocks on window)

1091
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,356
Hey, Jimmy.

1092
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,838
l'm sorry, l, uh,
thought you were somebody else.

1093
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,992
Sorry.

1094
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,036
That's OK.

1095
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:10,119
This Jimmy Grants deals drugs
out of the bar where his girlfriend works?

1096
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,029
But he's not going to bring her along?
He'll come by himself, right?

1097
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,874
l always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.

1098
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,356
No, officer. l'm as ready as l'll ever be.

1099
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,238
You're in the lobby?
What do you look like?

1100
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,390
l'll be right there.

1101
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:08,636
Lenny!

1102
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,756
Officer Gammell?

1103
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,596
Yeah. Come on.

1104
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,513
- Hey, smile.
- Oh, don't, uh... Not here.

1105
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,276
Over here.

1106
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,160
ls it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?

1107
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,118
You know what?
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1108
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,714
- Why?
- l'm undercover.

1109
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,959
This is the directions, where he's going.

1110
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,793
- My number's on the bottom if you...
- You're not coming?

1111
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,553
Nah, it wouldn't be appropriate.

1112
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,920
Nice picture. l look thin.

1113
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,913
Hey, Lenny!

1114
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,753
Make him beg.

1115
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,956
Teddy!

1116
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,115
Hey, Teddy!

1117
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,792
Teddy!

1118
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,592
Jimmy.

1119
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:53,157
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?

1120
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,151
Expecting any other Jimmys,
memory man?

1121
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:59,313
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, l remember you.

1122
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,709
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1123
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:02,835
Well?

1124
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:08,191
Motherfuck!

1125
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,076
What are you doing?

1126
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,309
Strip.

1127
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,755
- You're making a big fucking mistake!
- Strip!

1128
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:19,238
My associates are not the kind of people
you wanna piss off.

1129
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,912
Don't say anything else.

1130
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,878
- l knew l couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.

1131
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,916
Your pants, too.

1132
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,435
- Why?
- l don't wanna get blood on them.

1133
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,354
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!
Did he tell you what l was bringing?

1134
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:41,228
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- l've got two hundred grand in the car!

1135
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,880
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?

1136
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:46,190
- Just take the money and walk away.
- l don't want your fucking money.

1137
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,589
Then, what?

1138
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,831
- What do you want from me?
- l want my fucking life back!

1139
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:20,709
(softly) Sammy.

1140
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,276
He said Sammy.
How does he know about Sammy?

1141
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,316
Oh, fuck.

1142
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,316
What have l done?

1143
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:54,709
Hey, mister! l need help!

1144
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,236
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.
We gotta get him to a doctor.

1145
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,435
All right.

1146
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,835
l don't know what happened.
l've got this memory thing.

1147
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:05,753
- Do l know you?
- No. Don't worry, l'm a cop.

1148
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,991
- ls he still breathing?
- Well, l don't know. Maybe.

1149
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:13,870
- What the hell were you guys doing?
- l don't remember, l have this condition.

1150
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,838
l hope it's not as serious as his
cos this guy's dead.

1151
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,989
- Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!
- So you remember me now, huh?

1152
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:25,517
- You are a fucking cop!
- And l'm the guy that helped you find him.

1153
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,912
- Get up! Get up!
- Lenny, you got the wrong idea!

1154
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,671
Who is that? He knew me.

1155
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:37,320
Of course he did, he raped your wife,
he fucked up your brain.

1156
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,356
Bullshit! He's not the guy.

1157
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,149
His name is James F Grants. John G.
Check your tattoos.

1158
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,834
- Why did he bring two hundred grand?
- What?

1159
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,955
- What was it for?
- Amphetamines l told him l had.

1160
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:53,476
- ls this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1161
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:56,916
Look, Jimmy's your guy. l figured
we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1162
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,753
- How did he know me?
- The Discount lnn.

1163
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:04,038
He dealt out of there. The guy at the front
desk let him know if anybody came round.

1164
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:06,315
He called Jimmy
the minute he saw you taking a picture.

1165
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,709
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half.

1166
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,189
He knew about Sammy,
why would l tell him about Sammy?!

1167
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,511
You tell everybody about Sammy!
Everybody who'll listen!

1168
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,636
''Remember Sammy Jankis?''
''Remember Sammy Jankis?''

1169
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,518
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

1170
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,514
So you lie to yourself to be happy.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1171
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,388
We all do it. Who cares if there's a few
little details you'd rather not remember?

1172
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,996
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- l don't know.

1173
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:36,710
Your wife surviving the assault.
Her not believing your condition.

1174
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,554
The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.

1175
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,068
The insulin.

1176
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,914
That's Sammy, not me.
l told you about Sammy.

1177
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,878
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1178
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:53,316
Condtitioning yourself to remember,
learning through repetition.

1179
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,119
Sammy let his wife kill herself.
Sammy ended up in an institution.

1180
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,351
Sammy was a con man. A faker.

1181
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,510
l never said that Sammy was faking.

1182
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,353
You exposed him for what he was.
A fraud.

1183
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,396
l was wrong. That's the whole point.

1184
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,637
- See, Sammy's wife came to me...
- Sammy didn't have a wife.

1185
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,993
lt was your wife who had diabetes.

1186
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,595
Ouch!

1187
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,710
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1188
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,396
You sure?

1189
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,517
Ouch! Cut it out!

1190
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,556
She wasn't diabetic.

1191
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:41,235
You think l don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1192
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:44,320
l guess l can only make you remember
the things you want to be true.

1193
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,959
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

1194
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,110
He was to you.

1195
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:52,431
Come on, you got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

1196
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,954
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

1197
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,076
- lt makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

1198
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,878
- Yes, l will.
- No, you won't.

1199
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,269
- Somehow l'll know.
- You won't remember!

1200
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,759
When it's done, l will know.

1201
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,798
l thought so, too, l was sure of it,
but you didn't!

1202
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:14,075
That's right. The real John G.
l helped you find him over a year ago.

1203
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:16,913
- He's already dead.
- Don't lie to me any more.

1204
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,991
Look, Lenny,...

1205
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:22,152
..l was the cop assigned
to your wife's case, l believed you.

1206
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,629
l thought you deserved
a chance for revenge.

1207
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:27,951
l'm the one that helped you find
the other guy in your bathroom that night.

1208
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:30,190
The guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

1209
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,589
We found him, you killed him.

1210
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,992
But you didn't remember.

1211
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:41,549
So l helped you start looking again,
looking for the guy you already killed.

1212
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:46,156
- Oh, yeah? So who was he?
- Just some guy. Does it matter who?

1213
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:50,597
No reason, Lenny, no conspiracy,
just bad fucking luck.

1214
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:54,236
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realise your wife didn't live alone.

1215
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:59,919
But when you killed him
l was so convinced that you'd remember.

1216
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:03,029
But it didn't stick.

1217
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,236
Like nothing ever sticks,
like this won't stick.

1218
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,276
l took that picture.

1219
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,476
Just when you did it.

1220
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:20,910
Look how happy you are.
l wanted to see that face again.

1221
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,389
- Oh, gee, thanks(!)
- Fuck you.

1222
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:27,359
l gave you a reason to live
and you were more than happy to help.

1223
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:32,992
You don't want the truth. You make up
your own truth, like your police file.

1224
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:36,638
lt was complete when l gave it to you.
Who took out the twelve pages?

1225
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,039
You, probably.

1226
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,429
- No, it wasn't me, see, it was you.
- Why would l do that?

1227
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:43,239
To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1228
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,231
Do you know how many towns,...

1229
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:49,359
..how many John Gs or James Gs?
l mean, shit, Lenny, l'm a fucking John G.

1230
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:52,512
- Your name's Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

1231
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,556
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1232
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:59,191
Cheer up. There's plenty of John Gs
for us to find.

1233
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:06,758
All you do is moan! l'm the one
that has to live with what you've done.

1234
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:08,796
l'm the one that put it all together.

1235
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,351
You, you wander around, you're playing
detective. You're living a dream, kid.

1236
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:16,318
A dead wife to pine for,
a sense of purpose to your life,...

1237
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:20,632
..a romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if l wasn't in the picture.

1238
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,917
- l should kill you.
- Quit it! Lenny, come on.

1239
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,878
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

1240
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,876
Come on, what are you doing?

1241
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,999
You know what time it is?
lt's beer o'clock, l'm buying.

1242
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:39,636
Fuck!

1243
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:49,715
l'm not a killer.

1244
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,310
l'mjust someone
who wanted to make things right.

1245
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:02,228
Can ljust let myself forget
what you've told me?

1246
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,996
Can ljust let myself forget
what you made me do?

1247
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,476
You think ljust want another puzzle
to solve? Another John G to look for?

1248
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:41,755
You're a John G.

1249
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:46,111
So you can be my John G.

1250
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,873
Do l lie to myself to be happy?

1251
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,234
ln your case, Teddy,...

1252
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,236
..yes, l will.

1253
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,236
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

1254
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:19,278
- lt is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1255
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,590
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1256
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,875
Somebody'll recognise it.

1257
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:28,232
You know, l think l'd rather
be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

1258
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:31,549
l might hang on to this for a while.

1259
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,157
Lenny.

1260
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,674
Look, don't...
Will you help me find the keys?

1261
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,716
Help me find my keys!

1262
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,596
Lenny!

1263
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:47,550
Lenny!

1264
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:04,356
l have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.

1265
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,396
l have to believe
that my actions still have meaning.

1266
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:09,313
Even if l can't remember them.

1267
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:15,074
l have to believe that when my eyes
are closed, the world's still here.

1268
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:18,515
Do l believe the world's still here?

1269
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,839
ls it still out there?

1270
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,512
Yeah.

1271
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:32,439
We all need memories
to remind ourselves who we are.

1272
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,358
l'm no different.

1273
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,593
(tyres screech)

1274
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,038
Now, where was l?

1275
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:01,798
# We lay in each other's arms

1276
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:07,437
# But the room isjust an empty space

1277
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,634
# l guess we lived it out

1278
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:14,439
# Something in the air

1279
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:16,633
# We smile too fast

1280
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:20,076
# Then can't think of a thing to say

1281
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:24,474
# Lived with the best times

1282
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,956
# Left with the worst

1283
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,389
# l've danced with you too long

1284
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,036
# Nothing left to save

1285
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:45,395
# There's something in the air

1286
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:49,949
# Something in my eye

1287
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:54,039
# l've danced with you too long

1288
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,156
# Yeah

1289
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:01,388
# Something in the air

1290
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:05,959
# Something in my eye

1291
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,670
# Abracadoo

1292
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:21,796
# l lose you

1293
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,954
# We can't avoid the clash

1294
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,116
# The big mistake

1295
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,195
# Now we're gonna pay and pay

1296
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:39,314
# l guess you know
l never wanted anyone more than you

1297
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,519
# Lived all our best times

1298
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,468
# Left with the worst

1299

1300
