1
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,440
So where are you? You're in some motel room.

2
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,660
You just wake up, and you're in a motel room.

3
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,580
There's the key.

4
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,080
It feels like maybe it's just the first time you've been there...

5
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,750
but... perhaps you've been there for a week...

6
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,370
three months.

7
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,670
It's kind of hard to say. I don't know.

8
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,210
It's just an anonymous room.

9
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,380
This guy.

10
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,720
He's here already.

11
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,800
Lenny!

12
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,270
It's Leonard...

13
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,020
like I told you before.

14
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Did you? I must have forgot.

15
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,980
I guess I've already told you about my condition.

16
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,150
Only every time I see you.

17
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,790
-My car. -This is your car.

18
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,920
You're in a playful mood.

19
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,290
It's not good to make fun of someone's handicap.

20
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,130
Just trying to have a little fun.

21
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Roll up your window.

22
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,650
-It's broken. -I can get that fixed for you.

23
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,690
-So where to, Sherlock? -I got a lead on a place.

24
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,690
What the hell you wanna go there for?

25
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,160
-You know it? -Yeah. It's just this fucked-up building.

26
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,530
-Why do you wanna go there? -Don't remember.

27
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,390
-Looks like somebody's home. -That thing's been here for years.

28
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,690
What are you talking about? These tracks are only a few days old.

29
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,440
Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?

30
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,490
Come on!

31
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,330
Let's take a look inside.

32
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,470
"Teddy."

33
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,480
"Don't believe his lies. He is the one. Kill him."

34
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,320
I finally found him. How long have I been looking?

35
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,360
Find anything?

36
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,570
Didn't think so.

37
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,030
Let's go.

38
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,950
Fuck this.

39
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,910
You're gonna pay for what you did.

40
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,040
-Beg forgiveness, and then you pay. -Leonard.

41
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,170
You don't have a clue, you freak.

42
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,550
Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out.

43
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,600
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

44
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,140
-You don't even know my name. -Teddy.

45
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,390
That's 'cause you read it off a fucking picture.

46
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,770
You don't know who you are.

47
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,480
I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco.

48
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,400
That's who you were. That's not what you've become.

49
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,990
-Shut your mouth. -You want to know, Lenny?

50
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,370
Come on.

51
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,240
Come on. Let's go down to the basement.

52
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,330
Let's go down, you and me, together.

53
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,410
Then you'll know who you really are.

54
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,920
No!

55
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,470
It's just an anonymous room.

56
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,550
There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway.

57
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,050
Nothing except the Gideon Bible,

58
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,560
which I, Of course, read religiously.

59
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,150
You know who you are, and you know kind of all about yourself.

60
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,820
But just for day-to-day stuff, notes are really useful.

61
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,610
Sammy Jankis had the same problem...

62
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,660
but he really had no system.

63
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,120
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes...

64
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,120
but he'd get them all mixed up.

65
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,460
You really do need a system if you're gonna make it work.

66
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,260
-Hi. -Hi.

67
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,600
-I'm Mr. Shelby from 304. -What can I do for you, Leonard?

68
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,560
Burt.

69
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,980
Burt. I'm not sure. I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.

70
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,900
-You don't know? -I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.

71
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,110
Right. You said you like to look people in the eye

72
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,650
when you talk to them.

73
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,150
Yeah.

74
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,860
You don't remember saying that?

75
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,200
-That's the thing. I have this condition. -A condition?

76
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,660
-It's my memory. -Amnesia?

77
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,540
No, no. It's different from that. I have no short-term memory.

78
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,580
I know who I am. I know all about myself.

79
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,130
Since my injury, I can't make new memories. Everything fades.

80
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,420
If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started.

81
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,220
Next time I see you, I'm not gonna remember this conversation.

82
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,890
I don't even know if I've met you before.

83
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,060
So, if I seem a little strange or rude or something...

84
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,100
I've told you this before, haven't I?

85
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,280
Yeah. I don't mean to mess with you, but it's so weird.

86
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,570
-You don't remember me at all? -No.

87
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,490
-We've talked a bunch of times. -I'm sure we have.

88
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,620
What's the last thing you remember?

89
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,200
My wife.

90
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,080
What's it like?

91
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,260
It's like waking. It's like you just woke up.

92
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,550
That must suck.

93
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,260
It's all backwards.

94
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,260
Maybe you get an idea what you want to do next,

95
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,600
but you don't remember what you just did.

96
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,520
-I'm exactly the opposite--How long have I been staying here?

97
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,650
-Couple of days. -And you're holding my calls?

98
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,440
-Like you said. -Okay, but this guy's an exception.

99
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,410
-You know this guy? -Yeah, it's your friend, right?

100
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,570
What makes you think he's my friend?

101
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,620
-I just saw you together, that's all. -He's not my friend.

102
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,540
-Okay. -If he calls or if he shows up here...

103
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,420
give me a call in my room, okay?

104
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,080
His name's Teddy?

105
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,130
-Teddy, yeah. -All right.

106
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,380
Look, I hope my condition's not gonna be a problem for you.

107
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,720
No, not as long as you remember to pay the bill.

108
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,930
Yeah. Okay.

109
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,800
-Forty. -Forty.

110
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,060
This guy...

111
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,850
He's here already.

112
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,980
Lenny!

113
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,240
You really need a system ifyou're gonna make it work.

114
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,360
You kind of learn to trust your own handwriting.

115
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,480
That becomes an important part of your life.

116
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,490
You write yourself notes.

117
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,910
Where you put your notes... That also becomes important.

118
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,580
You need a jacket that's got like six pockets in it.

119
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,880
Particular pockets for particular things.

120
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,800
You just kind of learn to know where things go and how the system works.

121
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,190
And you have to be wary of

122
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,920
other people writing stuff for you that is not gonna make sense...

123
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,970
or is gonna lead you astray.

124
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,390
I don't know.

125
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,350
I guess people try and take advantage of somebody with this condition.

126
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,520
If you have a piece of information which is vital...

127
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,020
writing on your body instead of on a piece of paper can be the answer.

128
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,400
It's just a permanent way of keeping a note.

129
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,370
Who is this?

130
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,040
"Remember Sammy Jankis."

131
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,990
Excuse me, sir. You left these at your table.

132
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,790
Thanks.

133
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,620
-Lincoln Street? -Yeah.

134
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,830
Go straight out on Sixth Street. Go east all the way...

135
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,130
-Hold on. I'm gonna write this down. -It's easy.Just go...

136
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,170
Trust me. I need to write this down.

137
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,180
"The Discount Inn."

138
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,960
Discount Inn.

139
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,790
Natalie.

140
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,170
My car.

141
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,970
Teddy.

142
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,810
"John Edward Gammell."

143
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,490
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

144
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,370
"Don't believe his lies."

145
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,800
-Yeah? -Mr. Gammell?

146
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,760
-Lenny, is that you? -John Gammell?

147
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,260
Lenny, it's Teddy. Stay there. I'll be right over.

148
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,260
Okay. I'll be waiting.

149
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,660
"White. Male."

150
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,250
"First name John."

151
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,250
"Last name: G" for Gammell.

152
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,920
"Drugs. License plate."

153
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,430
"SG13...

154
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,350
7IU."

155
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,440
It's him.

156
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,610
I found you, you fuck.

157
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,010
You said we talked before. I don't remember that.

158
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,850
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.

159
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,600
I remember everything up until my injury.

160
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,390
I just can't make new memories. So I can't remember talking to you.

161
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,440
What did we talk about? Oh, Sammy Jankis.

162
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,860
I guess I tell people about Sammy to help them understand.

163
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,690
Sammy's story helps me understand my own situation.

164
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,910
Sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.

165
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,370
I have a more graceful solution to the memory problem.

166
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,160
I'm disciplined and organized.

167
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,790
I use habit and routine to make my life possible.

168
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,210
Sammy had no drive, no reason to make it work.

169
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,880
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.

170
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,160
"Today, 1:00 p.m. Meet Natalie for info.

171
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,830
She has also lost someone.

172
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,330
She will help you out of pity."

173
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,060
-Natalie? -You don't remember me.

174
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,250
Sorry. I should have explained. I have this...

175
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,060
You did explain, Lenny.

176
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,520
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.

177
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,190
-Yeah, I know. You told me. -Then I probably told you how much I hated it.

178
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,690
Yeah.

179
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,200
Do you mind taking your glasses off? It's hard for me to...

180
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,240
Thanks. So you have information for me?

181
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,080
-Is that what your little note says? -Yeah.

182
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,290
Must be tough living your life

183
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,040
according to a couple of scraps of paper.

184
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,920
You mix your laundry list with your grocery list...

185
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,170
and you'll end up eating your underwear for breakfast.

186
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,010
I guess that's why you have those freaky tattoos.

187
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,260
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

188
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,310
I'm sorry I don't remember you. It's nothing personal.

189
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,560
I do have information for you.

190
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,230
You gave me a license plate number.

191
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,530
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

192
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,070
Guess what name came up.

193
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,660
John Edward Gammell.John G.

194
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,370
-Do you know him? -No.

195
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,540
But his face on his driver's license looked really familiar.

196
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

197
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,710
Here's a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all.

198
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,300
Are you sure you want this?

199
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,170
-Have I told you what this man did? -Yeah.

200
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,010
Then you shouldn't have to ask.

201
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,800
But even if you get revenge, you're not gonna remember it.

202
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,970
You're not even gonna know that it happened.

203
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,580
My wife deserves vengeance.

204
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,390
Doesn't make any difference whether I know about it.

205
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,740
Just because there are things I don't remember

206
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,730
doesn't make my actions meaningless.

207
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,770
The world doesn'tjust disappear when you close your eyes, does it?

208
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,490
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself...

209
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,740
get another freaky tattoo.

210
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,120
Tell me about her again.

211
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,710
Why?

212
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,710
Because you like to remember her.

213
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,380
She was beautiful.

214
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,010
-To me, she was perfect. -No. Don'tjust recite the words.

215
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,060
Close your eyes... and remember her.

216
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,740
You can just feel the details.

217
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,450
The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.

218
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,960
And you can feel these extreme moments...

219
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,960
even if you don't want to.

220
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,630
You put these together, and you get the feel of a person.

221
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,140
Enough to know how much you miss them...

222
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,650
and how much you hate the person who took them away.

223
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,660
I added an address in here.

224
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,210
It might be useful. It's an abandoned place outside of town.

225
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,210
A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.

226
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,340
It's isolated.

227
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,340
Sounds perfect.

228
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,300
-Do I owe you any... -I wasn't helping you for money.

229
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,600
-I'm sorry. -It's okay.

230
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,810
See, you have this condition.

231
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,560
Are you still staying at the Discount Inn, room 304?

232
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,820
You left it at my place.

233
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,820
Yeah.

234
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,490
-They treating you okay? -I don't remember.

235
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,370
You know what we have in common?

236
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,840
We are both survivors.

237
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,260
You take care, Leonard.

238
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,870
"Remember Sammy Jankis."

239
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,750
I met Sammy through work. Insurance. I was an investigator.

240
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,710
I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phony.

241
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,880
I had to see through people's bullshit.

242
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,760
It was useful experience, 'cause now it's my life.

243
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,680
When I meet someone, I don't know if I've met them before.

244
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,680
I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.

245
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,280
My job taught me the best way

246
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,060
to find out what someone knew was just let them talk...

247
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,520
and watch the eyes and the body language.

248
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,630
If someone scratches their nose while they're talking,

249
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,190
experts tell you it means they're lying.

250
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,020
It really means they're nervous.

251
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,780
People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.

252
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,070
It's all about context.

253
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,030
Yeah, I was good.

254
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Sammy was my first real challenge.

255
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,170
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.

256
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,550
-Things change. -So I see.

257
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,720
-My name's Teddy. -I guess I've told you about my condition.

258
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Only every time I see you. Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

259
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,690
-Have I told you about Sammy Jankis? -Yeah.

260
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,410
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.

261
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,320
What about John G.? You think he's still here?

262
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,650
-Who? -Johnny G., the guy you're looking for.

263
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,320
-That's why you haven't left town, am I right? -Maybe.

264
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,700
-Leonard, look. You have to be very careful. -Why?

265
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,860
The other day you mentioned that

266
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,200
maybe somebody was trying to set you up...

267
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,040
get you to kill the wrong guy.

268
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,210
I go on facts, not recommendations, but thank you.

269
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,340
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.

270
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,210
-Why not? -Because your notes could be unreliable.

271
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,970
-Memory's unreliable. -Oh, please!

272
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,390
No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good.

273
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,010
Ask the police. Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

274
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,060
The cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff.

275
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,940
They collect facts, they make notes, and they draw conclusions.

276
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,060
Facts, not memories.

277
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,610
That's how you investigate. I know. It's what I used to do.

278
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,900
Memory can change the shape of a room. It can change the color of a car.

279
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,070
And memories can be distorted.

280
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,320
They'rejust an interpretation. They're not a record.

281
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,490
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

282
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,290
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

283
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,170
He killed my wife. He took away my fucking memory.

284
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,090
He destroyed my ability to live.

285
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,010
You're living.

286
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,800
Only for revenge.

287
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,720
Then we'll get the bastard. Where you staying?

288
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,270
The Discount Inn.

289
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,820
I don't know what room. I haven't got my key.

290
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,730
Probably left it in your room.

291
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,290
Hi. I'm checked in here, but I think I've misplaced my key.

292
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,630
How you doing, Leonard? Probably in the room, right?

293
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,900
-Don't see my key anywhere. -Shit.

294
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,070
This is the wrong room. You're in 304 now.

295
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,160
-I'm sorry. I fucked up. -This is not my room?

296
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,740
No. Let's go.

297
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,830
Why is this my handwriting?

298
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,790
This was your room, but nowyou're in 304.

299
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,130
-When was I in here? -Last week.

300
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,670
But then I rented you another room on top of it.

301
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,880
-Why? -Business is slow.

302
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,840
I told my boss about your condition and stuff...

303
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,140
and he said, "Try and rent him another room."

304
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,270
How many rooms am I checked into in this shit-hole?

305
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,810
Just two, so far.

306
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,560
At least you're being honest about ripping me off.

307
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,190
You're not gonna remember anyway.

308
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,190
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

309
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,900
Leonard, always get a receipt.

310
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,200
Yeah. I'm gonna write that down.

311
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,740
-What time is it? -Quarter to 1:00.

312
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,810
Excuse me.

313
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,500
Your room's...

314
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,350
-Natalie? -You don't remember me.

315
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,600
I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.

316
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,400
Mr. Samuel R.Jankis. Strangest case ever.

317
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,270
You know, the guy's a 58-year-old semiretired accountant.

318
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,030
He and his wife had been in this car accident. Nothing too serious.

319
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,320
But he's acting funny. He can't get a handle on what's going on.

320
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,580
The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus.

321
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,740
Nothing conclusive,

322
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,210
but Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.

323
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,040
Can't work, can't do shit. The medical bills pile up.

324
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,840
His wife calls the insurance company, and I get sent in.

325
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,800
Now, this is my first big claims investigation, so I really check into it.

326
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:26,100
Sammy can think just fine, but he can't make any new memories.

327
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,520
He could only remember things for a couple of minutes.

328
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,310
-This is Mr. Shelby. -He'd watch TV...

329
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,730
but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing.

330
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,510
He couldn't remember how it began.

331
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,650
He liked commercials. They were short.

332
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,820
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

333
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,780
The crazy part was that this guy...

334
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,070
who couldn't even follow the plot of Green Acres anymore...

335
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,240
could do the most complicated things...

336
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,700
as long as he learned them before the accident...

337
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,290
and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.

338
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,130
Be gentle.

339
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,950
The doctors assure me there's a real condition

340
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,510
called anterograde memory loss...

341
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,550
or short-term memory loss.

342
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,640
It's rare, but legit.

343
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,390
But every time I see him...

344
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,140
I catch this look...

345
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,810
this slight look of recognition.

346
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,730
But he says he can't remember me at all.

347
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,940
Sammy, it's okay. I got it. I got it.

348
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,860
-Hi, Mr. Shelby. -Hi, Mrs.Jankis.

349
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,910
I can read people, and I'm thinking: bad actor.

350
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,490
So now I'm suspicious, and I order more tests.

351
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,080
Awake.

352
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,790
Where am I?

353
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,430
Somebody's bedroom.

354
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,100
It must be her room.

355
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,220
But who is she?

356
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,440
It's only me.

357
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,660
-Did you sleep okay? -Yeah. You?

358
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,120
Oh, shit. I gotta be someplace.

359
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,630
-It's pretty weird. -It's useful.

360
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,630
You never write a phone number on your hand?

361
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:28,180
I should be able to talk to my friend today about the license plate.

362
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,100
-Yeah, the license plate. -John G.'s license plate.

363
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,230
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

364
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,080
"Natalie."

365
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,670
"She has also lost someone.

366
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,670
She will help you out of pity."

367
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,840
If it's registered in this state...

368
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,020
it should only take a couple seconds

369
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,930
to pull up his license and registration.

370
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,810
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

371
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,980
Do you think we could just arrange a meeting now?

372
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,900
I'm not too good on the phone.

373
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,490
It's great that you...

374
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,080
that you're helping me like this.

375
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,670
I'm helping you because you helped me.

376
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,640
So next time you see me, will you remember me?

377
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,660
I think you will.

378
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,120
I'm sorry.

379
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,080
Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?

380
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,310
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.

381
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,770
Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.

382
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:50,190
But I find something in my research: conditioning.

383
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.

384
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,160
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.

385
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,780
You just get better through practice.

386
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,290
It's a completely different part of the brain

387
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,370
from the short-term memory.

388
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,540
So I had the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning.

389
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,790
Just pick up any three objects.

390
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,040
That's a test?

391
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,710
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

392
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,970
Sorry.

393
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,760
Ow!What the fuck?

394
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,060
-It's a test, Sammy. -Test this, you fucking quack.

395
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,560
Some of the objects were electrified.

396
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,020
They'd give him a small shock. They kept repeating the test...

397
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,070
always with the same objects electrified.

398
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,770
The point was to see if Sammy

399
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,740
could learn to avoid the electrified objects...

400
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,820
not by memory, but by instinct.

401
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,510
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

402
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,770
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.

403
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,230
What the fuck have you got me into?

404
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,810
Come inside.

405
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,990
-Who is he? -Calm down. Okay?

406
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,120
This is my problem. You offered to help.

407
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,570
It has nothing to do with your investigation.

408
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,160
How did you get me into this?

409
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,280
You offered to help when you saw what he did to my face.

410
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,740
How do I know he did that to your face?

411
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,950
Because I came straight to you after he did it.

412
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,290
I showed you what he did, and I asked you to help me.

413
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,330
-And I just take your word? -Yeah.

414
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,710
Something doesn't feel right.

415
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,180
I think someone's fucking with me,

416
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,340
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

417
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,840
-Did you? -What?

418
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,340
-Kill him? -Of course not!

419
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,470
Hey.

420
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,390
Sit down, okay? Sit.

421
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,310
This has nothing to do with you.

422
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,770
You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

423
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,560
You have to burn them.

424
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,150
Leonard, you decided to help me. Trust yourself.

425
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Trust your own judgment. You can question everything.

426
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,920
You can never know anything for sure.

427
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,080
There are things you know for sure.

428
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,290
Such as?

429
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,580
I know what that's gonna sound like when I knock on it.

430
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,670
I know what that's gonna feel like when I pick it up.

431
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,420
See? Certainties. It's the kind of memory you take for granted.

432
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,430
You know, I can remember so much.

433
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,720
The feel of the world... and her.

434
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,150
She's gone.

435
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,190
And the present is trivia, which I scribble down as fucking notes!

436
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,200
Hey. Come on. Try and relax. Come on.

437
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,620
It's not easy for me to relax, you know?

438
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,370
Come on. Take your jacket off.

439
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,000
Now. Come on.

440
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,540
Hey.

441
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,420
Didn't think you were the type.

442
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,470
It's backwards.

443
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,970
Come here.

444
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,920
What about here?

445
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,670
Maybe it's for when I find him.

446
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,840
I've lost somebody too.

447
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,260
I'm sorry.

448
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,560
His name was Jimmy.

449
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,680
-What happened to him? -He went to meet somebody.

450
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,730
He never came back.

451
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,480
-Who did he go to meet? -A guy called Teddy.

452
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,780
What do the police think?

453
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,740
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.

454
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,370
When you find this guy, this John G....

455
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,410
what are you gonna do?

456
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,080
I'm gonna kill him.

457
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,670
Maybe I can help you find him.

458
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,180
I don't even know how long she's been gone.

459
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,560
It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here...

460
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,440
because she's gone to the bathroom or something.

461
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,490
But somehow I just...

462
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,530
I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.

463
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,590
If I could just reach over and touch her side of the bed...

464
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,380
I would know that it was cold.

465
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,510
But I can't.

466
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,430
I know I can't have her back.

467
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,150
But I don't want to wake up in the morning thinking she's still here.

468
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:26,070
I lie here not knowing how long I've been alone.

469
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,180
So how...

470
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,920
How can I heal?

471
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,460
How am I supposed to heal if I can't... feel time?

472
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,790
"She has also lost someone.

473
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,330
She will help you out of pity."

474
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,610
They kept testing Sammy for months...

475
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,490
always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge.

476
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,330
Ow!What the fuck?

477
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,830
-It's a test, Sammy. -Test this, you fucking quack!

478
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,620
Even with total short-term memory loss...

479
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,970
Sammy should have learned to instinctively

480
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,460
stop picking up the wrong objects.

481
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,910
All the previous cases responded to conditioning.

482
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,590
Sammy didn't respond at all.

483
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,970
It was enough to suggest that

484
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,260
his condition was psychological, not physical.

485
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,070
We turned down his claim on the grounds that

486
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,800
he wasn't covered for mental illness.

487
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,600
His wife got stuck with the bills, and I got a big promotion.

488
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,980
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless.

489
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,980
But it works for me.

490
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,440
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

491
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,940
Habit and routine make my life possible.

492
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,950
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

493
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,960
Awake.

494
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,210
Where am I?

495
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,420
Motel room.

496
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,560
Some anonymous motel room.

497
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,480
Nothing in the drawers, but I'll take a look anyway.

498
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,020
Nothing except the Gideon Bible.

499
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,250
Lenny!Open up!

500
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,040
Just a minute.

501
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,670
Open the door.

502
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,010
Lenny.

503
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,760
Open the door.

504
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,770
Come on!

505
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,350
Hi, Teddy.

506
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,690
Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

507
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,950
I get it.

508
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,500
Amorous neighbors.

509
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,040
What are you doing here?

510
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,840
You called me. You said you needed my help.

511
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,470
I've had more rewarding friendships than this one.

512
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,890
Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes.

513
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,640
What the fuck is that?

514
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,150
-Who the fuck is that? -You don't know him?

515
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,860
No!Should I?

516
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,570
Wait a minute.

517
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,110
-Is that John G.? -I don't think so.

518
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,130
You don't think so? You didn't write it down?

519
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,490
I might've fallen asleep before I did.

520
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,570
For Christ's sakes!

521
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,410
Ask him.

522
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,040
What's your name?

523
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
Your name.

524
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,540
-Dodd. -Who did this to you?

525
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,210
-What? -Who did this to you?

526
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,800
You did.

527
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,850
I'm not gonna help you kill that guy.

528
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,300
No, just let me think for a minute.

529
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,520
Okay, Natalie. Who's Natalie?

530
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,060
-Natalie who? -Why?

531
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,230
-Maybe I know her. -Look. We gotta get him out of here.

532
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,780
All right, all right.

533
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,860
He's gotta have a car, right?

534
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,500
We take him down to his car,

535
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,540
tell him to get the fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

536
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,700
We can't walk him out of here tied up and bleeding.

537
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,250
-How the fuck did you get him up here? -I don't know.

538
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,290
You don't know.

539
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,380
Yes, I do. This is not my room.

540
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,260
It must be his room. Great! Let's go.

541
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,300
-No, no. We can'tjust leave him here. -Why not?

542
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,950
Because the maid's gonna walk in.

543
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,930
She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

544
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,640
Okay. We untie him...

545
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,600
we clean him up, and we march him out of here with a gun in his back.

546
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,650
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

547
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,480
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

548
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,320
Fucking hope not.

549
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,160
Which one?

550
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,710
We should probably steal his car. You know, teach him a lesson.

551
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,750
Shut up.

552
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,260
That's all right for you to say. You're the one with the Jag.

553
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,220
Get in. I'm gonna ride with him. You follow us.

554
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,220
Give me your keys.

555
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,510
Take your own car.

556
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,500
-So was he scared? -Yeah. I think it was your sinister must ache.

557
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,300
Fuck you. You should have stolen his car.

558
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,420
-Why? What's wrong with this one? -Nothing. You want to trade?

559
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,850
So what do you do now?

560
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,390
I'm going to find out what the fuck that was all about.

561
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,400
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

562
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,070
Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him...

563
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,240
and fighting the company's decision.

564
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,410
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

565
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,500
-I never said that Sammy was faking. -Listen. I have an idea.

566
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,210
Sammy, I have an idea.

567
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,960
Just that his problem was mental, not physical.

568
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,300
I want you to have a pen in your pocket, okay?

569
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,930
-But she couldn't understand. -You're gonna have a pad in your pocket.

570
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:29,010
-I did something wrong? -You did something wrong!

571
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,220
We're gonna deal with it. We're gonna try harder.

572
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,430
She looks into his eyes and sees the same person.

573
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,650
If it's not a physical problem, he should just snap out of it.

574
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,440
-Ellen called! -Ellen called?

575
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:44,150
-Ellen can't come today! Ellen can't come! -Okay. I'm sorry!

576
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,360
-I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry. -Try harder!

577
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,000
So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance company

578
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,250
gives her the seed of doubt...

579
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,960
just like he gave it to the doctors.

580
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,460
But I never said that he was faking. I never said that.

581
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,180
I don't feel drunk.

582
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,880
-Hello? -Shit.

583
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,380
Housekeeping.

584
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,550
-Not right now. -I'm sorry.

585
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:51,740
Okay.

586
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:00,580
"Dodd. Put him onto Teddy or just get rid of him for Natalie."

587
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,750
Dodd.

588
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,300
Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.

589
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,810
Teddy, Teddy.

590
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,490
Leave your number. You know what to do.

591
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,740
Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

592
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,870
I'm at the Mountcrest Inn of Fifth Street, room six.

593
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,950
I need you to come over as soon as you get this. It's important.

594
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,290
This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

595
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,090
Fuck.

596
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,990
What Mrs.Jankis didn't understand was

597
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,140
that you can't bully someone into remembering.

598
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,230
The more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.

599
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,980
Then call me back?

600
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,710
Okay. What am I doing?

601
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,680
I'm chasing this guy.

602
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,930
No. He's chasing me.

603
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,370
Fuck.

604
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,090
"Dodd. White guy.

605
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,130
Mountcrest Inn on Fifth Street."

606
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,760
I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.

607
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,760
Fuck.

608
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,760
Sorry.

609
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,290
I need a weapon.

610
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,720
This'll do.

611
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,870
I don't feel drunk.

612
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,540
Do I know this guy?

613
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,540
He seems to know me.

614
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,790
What the fuck?

615
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,560
-I like your car. -Thank you.

616
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,650
-Where'd you get it? -Are you interested in buying one?

617
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,190
I haven't made a strong enough impression on you?

618
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,280
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

619
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,910
Okay. What am I doing?

620
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,300
Who is this?

621
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,840
Ouch. Cut it out.

622
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,790
-How can you read that again? -It's good.

623
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,920
Yeah, but you've read it, like, a thousand times.

624
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,590
I enjoy it.

625
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,350
I always thought the pleasure of a book

626
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,590
was in wanting to know what happens next.

627
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,380
Don't be a prick.

628
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:55,050
I'm not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.

629
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,680
Just let me read, please.

630
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,900
Probably tried this before.

631
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,870
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

632
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,410
Can't remember to forget you.

633
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:40,810
Yeah.

634
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,560
Sir, that'd certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries.

635
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,840
I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle.

636
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,530
Can you hang on a sec?

637
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,540
The police report mentioned

638
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,370
the drugs found in the car outside my house.

639
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,540
The car was stolen, but his prints were all over it.

640
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,340
I got friends in the department. They gave me a copy of it.

641
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,710
I dealt with the police a lot in my insurance job.

642
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,000
With my condition, it's really tough.

643
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,880
I can't keep it all in mind at once.

644
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,860
I have to summarize the different sections.

645
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,220
And there's pages missing.

646
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,470
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

647
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,810
I don't know why these are crossed out.

648
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,810
But they weren't even looking for John G.

649
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:26,500
The stuff they found in the car fit in

650
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,650
with what they believed had happened...

651
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,650
so they didn't chase any of it up.

652
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:06,850
Honey.

653
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,150
Honey, it's late.

654
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,300
Everything okay?

655
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,400
You okay in there?

656
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,610
Was it good for you?

657
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,740
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

658
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,750
No.

659
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,080
I'd like you to leave now.

660
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,110
There's something about the drugs stashed in the car

661
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,150
that doesn't ring true for me.

662
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,730
Because the police claim the guy was an addict...

663
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,820
needing money to score, which I think is bullshit...

664
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,380
'cause he's not gonna go breaking into places

665
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,160
while he's still got a stash that big.

666
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,790
I think John G. left it there or planted it there.

667
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,620
How do you know that?

668
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,080
Shit. That's true. It fits.

669
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,750
So he's a dealer.

670
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,340
Hang on a sec.

671
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,480
Now we're getting somewhere.

672
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,150
"Discount Inn."

673
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,330
Yeah, okay. Blonde's fine.

674
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,830
That's what they say.

675
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,040
The Discount Inn. 304.

676
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,090
Leonard.

677
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,920
What then?

678
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,220
We just go to bed. You wait for me to fall asleep.

679
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,390
You go into the bathroom and you slam the door.

680
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:29,010
-Slam it? -Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

681
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,060
-And that's it? -That's it.

682
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,900
First I just need you to put these things around the room.

683
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,070
Just pretend they're your things and that this is your bedroom.

684
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:59,750
-Should I wear it? -No. Just like you took it off or something.

685
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:05,130
I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

686
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,930
I just mean put them around the room...

687
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:11,600
as if they were your things.

688
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,100
Whatever gets you off.

689
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,630
I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously.

690
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:47,050
This is a difficult condition for people to understand.

691
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,390
Look at Sammy Jankis. His own wife couldn't deal with it.

692
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,010
I told you about how she tried to get him to snap out of it.

693
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,670
Eventually she came to see me at the office.

694
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,430
I found out all kinds of shit.

695
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:59,390
She told me about life with Sammy, how she treated him.

696
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,940
Thank you for seeing me.

697
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:01,730
It got to the point

698
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,770
where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house.

699
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,610
Then she'd stop feeding him to see if his hunger...

700
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,650
would make him remember where he'd hidden the food.

701
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,620
She wasn't a cruel person. She just wanted old Sammy back.

702
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:15,180
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy

703
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,500
and you've decided that he's faking.

704
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,130
Mrs.Jankis, the company's position isn't that

705
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:19,210
Sammy is faking anything...

706
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,210
just that his condition can't be shown to be...

707
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:24,750
I just want to know what your honest opinion about Sammy is.

708
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,170
We shouldn't even be talking like this

709
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,760
while the case is still open to appeal.

710
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,090
-I'm not appealing the decision. -Then why are you here?

711
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:33,640
Try to understand. When I look at Sammy...

712
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,180
I don't see some... vegetable.

713
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,350
I see my same old Sammy.

714
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,720
What do you think that's like for me

715
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,940
to suspect he might be imagining this whole problem...

716
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,110
and that if I just could say the right thing...

717
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:50,990
he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal?

718
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:00,330
If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone...

719
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:04,540
then I could say good-bye and start loving this new Sammy.

720
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,380
As long as I have doubt, I can't say good-bye and move on.

721
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,220
What do you want from me?

722
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,470
I want you to forget the company you work for for 30 seconds...

723
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:18,220
and tell me if you really believe that Sammy's faking his condition.

724
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:23,480
I need to know... what you honestly believe.

725
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,320
I believe that

726
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,400
Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.

727
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,410
Thank you.

728
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,000
I thought I helped her. I thought she just needed some kind of answer.

729
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:49,090
I didn't think it was important what the answer was...

730
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,920
just that she had one to believe.

731
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,860
-A car this nice you should lock. -Who the fuck are you?

732
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,280
-Teddy, your buddy. -Prove it.

733
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,990
Sammy. Remember Sammy? You told me about Sammy!

734
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:19,030
Geez!

735
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,040
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

736
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,250
What, your sense of humor went with the memory?

737
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:26,290
-Do you even know why you're here? -Unfinished business.

738
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,750
Lenny, let me inform you.

739
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,210
Your business here is very much finished.

740
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,300
-You're still here because of Natalie. -Who's Natalie?

741
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,510
Schmuck, whose house do you think you just walked out of?

742
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:43,310
That's right. Take a look at your pictures. I bet you got one of her.

743
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:47,520
Nice shot, Leibovitz.

744
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:51,360
You'll wanna make a note. You can't trust her.

745
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,820
Yeah? Why's that?

746
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:56,150
Because by now she's taken a look at this suit and the car...

747
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,830
and she's starting to figure out ways

748
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:00,620
of turning the situation to her advantage.

749
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,040
She's already got you staying with her, for Christ's sakes.

750
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,710
You can't go back in there. Let me give you the name of a motel.

751
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:10,400
You're lucky I ran into you. That broad's bad news.

752
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,670
What do you mean, "bad news"?

753
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:14,050
She's involved with drugs.

754
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:16,420
Look. These. You see these?

755
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,470
This is the bar where she works.

756
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,600
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

757
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,310
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

758
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:26,270
He writes messages on the back of these.

759
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,900
Then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks.

760
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:33,070
-Why should I care? -Because when she gets jammed up...

761
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,320
she's gonna use you to protect herself.

762
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,610
From who?

763
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,450
Guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.

764
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:43,080
Guys are gonna come after her. Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.

765
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,200
Somebody always pays. Maybe she'll make it you.

766
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,790
Oh, yeah? Maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?

767
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,790
You worried that she's gonna use me against you?

768
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,880
-No. -Why not?

769
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:57,220
Because she doesn't know who I am.

770
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,760
-Why are you following me? -Maybe I wanna help.

771
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,760
She doesn't know anything about your investigation, okay, Einstein?

772
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:07,520
So write this down.

773
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,270
When she offers to help, it'll be for her own reasons.

774
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:17,150
I'm not lying. Take my pen. Write this down.

775
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,400
Do not trust her.

776
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:30,330
-There. You happy now? -I won't be happy until you leave town.

777
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,330
Why not?

778
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,330
You ever wonder how long you can hang around here

779
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:35,920
before people start asking questions?

780
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,090
What sort of questions?

781
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:39,300
The same sort of questions you should be asking yourself.

782
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,930
-Like what? -Like, how did you get this suit, the car?

783
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:43,640
-I have money. -From what?

784
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:47,100
My wife's death. I used to work in insurance. We were well covered.

785
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,940
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership.

786
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:57,440
You don't have a clue, do you?

787
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:00,070
-You don't even know who you are. -Yes, I do.

788
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:01,240
I don't have amnesia.

789
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:03,910
I remember everything right up until the incident.

790
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,780
I am Leonard Shelby. I am from San Francisco...

791
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:10,500
That's who you were. You do not know who you are...

792
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:14,500
what you've become since... the incident.

793
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,130
You wander around playing detective.

794
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:19,800
You don't even know how long ago it was.

795
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:22,110
Let me put it this way.

796
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,600
Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?

797
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,570
I didn't sell insurance. I investigated it.

798
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,470
Right. You're an investigator.

799
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:32,550
Maybe you should start investigating yourself.

800
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:35,020
Thank you for the advice.

801
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:39,820
Look, do me a favor. Don't go back in there.

802
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,610
Will you take the motel out of town?

803
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,160
It's been fun, Lenny.

804
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,130
"Do not trust her."

805
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,920
"Don't believe his lies."

806
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,060
Fuck it. I need my own place.

807
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:26,950
No. She shouldn't have given me that responsibility.

808
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:29,700
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.

809
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,330
Yeah. I guess.

810
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,790
But I've got all sorts of other considerations.

811
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,090
Legal responsibility, large financial...

812
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,550
Who is this?

813
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:00,020
Write this down. Write down what happened. Write it down.

814
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:02,440
Concentrate. Keep it in mind. Find a pen.

815
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:10,200
What happened?

816
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,330
What does it look like? He beat the shit out of me.

817
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:15,620
Who?

818
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:17,750
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd. Dodd beat the shit out of me.

819
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:19,750
-Why? -Why? Because ofyou.

820
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,550
Because I did what you told me to do! Go in and reason with him!

821
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:26,170
-Tell him about Teddy!Great fucking idea! -Calm down. Take it easy.

822
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,090
You're safe. It's okay.

823
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,970
Come on.Just sit down.

824
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,970
Sit down.

825
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,980
Here. Sit down.

826
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,900
Okay. You're okay.

827
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,270
I'll just get some ice for your face.

828
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,200
Here.

829
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,040
I did exactly what you told me to do.

830
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,290
I went to Dodd...

831
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,800
and I told him that I didn't have any ofJimmy's money...

832
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,340
or the drugs...

833
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:14,140
and that this Teddy must have taken everything.

834
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,850
And what did he say?

835
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:18,850
He didn't believe me.

836
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,440
He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

837
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,990
Then he just started hitting me.

838
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:31,610
Where is he?

839
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,620
-Why? -I'll go see him.

840
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,700
And?

841
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:37,320
I'll give him some bruises of his own

842
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,000
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

843
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:41,500
He'll kill you, Lenny.

844
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,420
My wife used to call me Lenny.

845
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,920
Yeah?

846
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,590
Yeah. I hated it.

847
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,180
This guy is so dangerous.

848
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:57,810
-Let'sjust think of something else, okay? -No, no.

849
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:01,940
You just tell me what he looks like... and where I can find him.

850
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:05,570
-Have you got a pen? -In my purse.

851
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,490
He'll probably find you.

852
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,910
-What do you mean? -I told him about your car.

853
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:22,710
Why?

854
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:28,050
He was beating the shit out of me. I had to tell him something.

855
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:30,880
Just write it all down.

856
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,270
Be careful.

857
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,280
I'll be fine.

858
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:00,410
-A car this nice you should lock. -Who the fuck are you?

859
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,760
Front desk?

860
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:20,430
Burt. Right. This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.

861
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,600
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't want any calls.

862
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,770
Nope. None at all.

863
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,660
-What's wrong? -Somebody's come already.

864
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,700
-Who? -He calls himself Dodd.

865
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,200
What does he want?

866
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:43,860
He wants to know what happened to Jimmy and his money.

867
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:45,250
He thinks I took it.

868
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:46,460
Did you?

869
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:48,840
No.

870
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:54,800
-What's this all about? -Fuck!

871
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,910
You don't have a fucking clue, do you?

872
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:58,760
You'rejust blissfully ignorant, aren't ya?

873
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:00,190
I have this condition.

874
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:02,390
I know all about your fucking condition, Leonard!

875
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:03,880
Probably know more about it than you do.

876
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,890
You don't have a fucking clue about anything else.

877
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,060
What happened?

878
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:09,980
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet some guy named Teddy.

879
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,780
He took a lot of money with him, and he never came back.

880
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:13,870
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.

881
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:16,450
I don't know if you know this Teddy, or how well.

882
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:18,200
-Neither do I. -Don't protect him!

883
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,320
-I'm not. -Help me.

884
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:20,660
How?

885
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,910
Get rid of Dodd for me.

886
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,040
-What? -Kill him. I'll pay you.

887
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:28,170
What do you think I am? I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

888
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,290
What then? Love?

889
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:32,090
What would you kill for?

890
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:34,760
-You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you? -That's different.

891
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,830
Not to me. I wasn't fucking married to her.

892
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:38,340
Hey, don't talk about my wife.

893
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:40,680
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

894
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,220
I can say whatever I want and you won't remember.

895
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,430
I could call your wife a fucking whore and we could still be friends.

896
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,730
-Calm down. -Easy for you to say. You can't get scared.

897
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:49,330
You don't know how, you fucking idiot!

898
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,400
Take it easy. This has nothing to do with me.

899
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,190
Maybe it does. How the fuck would you know?

900
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,980
You don't know a fucking thing!

901
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:59,410
-You can't get scared, but can you get angry? -Yes.

902
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:01,820
You pathetic piece of shit.

903
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:03,990
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

904
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,660
and you won't have a fucking clue, you fucking retard!

905
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,250
-Shut your mouth. -You know what? I'm gonna use you.

906
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,830
I'm telling you now, because I'm gonna enjoy it so much more...

907
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,460
if I know that you could stop me if you weren't such a fucking freak.

908
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:17,340
Did you lose your pen?

909
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,810
That's too bad, freak.

910
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,840
Otherwise, you could write yourself a little note...

911
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:23,010
about how much Natalie hates your retarded guts

912
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:24,510
and that I called your wife a fuckin' whore.

913
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,310
-Don't say another fuckin' word. -About your whore of a wife?

914
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:33,150
I read about your condition, Leonard.

915
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:36,660
You know what one of the causes of short-term memory loss is?

916
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,820
Venereal disease.

917
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:42,780
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife sucked one too many diseased cocks...

918
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:44,580
and turned you into a fucking retard!

919
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:50,080
You sad, sad freak.

920
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,250
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

921
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,750
and you won't remember.

922
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:59,630
We'll still be best friends...

923
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,260
or maybe even lovers.

924
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:06,680
Fuck.

925
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,690
I'll see you soon.

926
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,410
Stay focused. Find a pen.

927
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:27,620
Gotta write this down. Gotta write it down.

928
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,660
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

929
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:35,330
Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.

930
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,720
Come on. Gotta find a pen. I gotta find a pen.

931
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,760
Write this down. Write this down, exactly what happened.

932
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,720
Gonna write down exactly what happened. Come on.

933
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,140
I gotta find a pen. Geez!Come on.

934
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,640
Keep focused. Keep focused.

935
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,190
Keep it in mind. Come on. Find a pen.

936
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:57,110
Write this note. Write down what happened.

937
01:16:57,190 --> 01:17:00,480
Write it down. Concentrate. Keep it in mind.

938
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,290
What happened?

939
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,460
What does it look like? He beat the shit out of me.

940
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:15,580
Who?

941
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:18,000
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd. Dodd beat the shit out of me.

942
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,720
Hello?

943
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:34,560
It's Burt, from the front desk.

944
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,230
-Yeah? -I know you said you didn't want any calls.

945
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,860
But this guy called. He's on the phone now. He says he's a cop.

946
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,400
-A cop? -Yeah.

947
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:47,030
He says you're really gonna wanna know what he has to say.

948
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,730
I'm not too good on the phone.

949
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,700
I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them.

950
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,670
You can crash on the couch. It's comfortable.

951
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,550
Just have a seat.

952
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,090
Thanks.

953
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,060
How long do you think it's gonna take you?

954
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:15,810
You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife?

955
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:20,520
That depends on if he's here in town or if he's moved on.

956
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:23,730
I have my file here.

957
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:29,870
Can I ask you something? If you have all of that information...

958
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:32,330
then why haven't the police found him for you?

959
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,750
-They're not looking for him. -Why not?

960
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:40,750
They don't think he exists. You see, I told them what I remembered.

961
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,960
I was asleep.

962
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,170
Something woke me up.

963
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:52,130
Her side of the bed was cold.

964
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:54,100
She'd obviously been out of bed for a while.

965
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:54,660
There had to be a second man.

966
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:57,330
Somebody hit me from behind. I remember.

967
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:59,330
It's about the last thing that I do remember.

968
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:02,170
Look. The police did not believe me. If we check the police...

969
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:06,050
How did they explain what you do remember? The gun and stuff.

970
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,300
John G. was clever.

971
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,890
He was clever.

972
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,830
See, he took the dead man's gun,

973
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:17,680
he replaced it with the sap that he hit me with.

974
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:20,480
He left my gun and he left the getaway car.

975
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:22,350
He gave the police a complete package.

976
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,190
They found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand.

977
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:29,190
And they only found my gun.

978
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,900
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

979
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:35,360
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts,

980
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,580
and I had brain damage.

981
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:39,290
The cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition.

982
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:43,460
Leonard, you can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help you.

983
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,040
Thanks.

984
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:49,590
I have to go back to work.

985
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,920
So,just make yourself at home.

986
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:55,850
You can watch TV or you can have some food, whatever you want, okay?

987
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:58,600
-Make yourself at home. -One thing.

988
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:05,440
-Something to remember you by. -My name is Natalie.

989
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,820
"Natalie."

990
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,180
-What's wrong? -Somebody's come already.

991
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,490
-On the house. -Thanks.

992
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,990
You really do have a problem.

993
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,500
Just like that cop said.

994
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,250
Your condition.

995
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:50,830
Nobody's perfect.

996
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:55,840
What's the last thing that you do remember?

997
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:01,100
-My wife. -That's sweet.

998
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,050
Dying.

999
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,430
I remember my wife dying.

1000
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,110
Let me get you another one.

1001
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:15,030
I think this one's dusty.

1002
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:21,530
Why are you calling me? What do you want?

1003
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,560
I know you're a cop, but what do you want?

1004
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,080
Have I done something wrong?

1005
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,120
I don't know. Something bad, maybe.

1006
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:32,350
Why are you asking me? I can't remember what I've done.

1007
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:34,590
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

1008
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:35,360
Because of my condition.

1009
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:35,570
You don't believe someone with this condition.

1010
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:40,630
Nobody believed Sammy! I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

1011
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,970
"Ferdy's Bar."

1012
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,930
"Come by after. Natalie."

1013
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,820
I'll have a beer, please.

1014
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,910
-What do you want? -A beer, please.

1015
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:08,410
You can'tjust waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer.

1016
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,830
-What, is there a dress code? -Why are you here?

1017
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,880
-I'm meeting someone called Natalie. -That's me.

1018
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,170
Yeah. We met before, right?

1019
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:19,800
-Then why am I here? -I don't know. Why don't you tell me.

1020
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,340
I don't remember. I have no short-term memory. It's not amnesia.

1021
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:25,100
-You're the memory guy. -How do you know about me?

1022
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,640
My boyfriend told me about you.

1023
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:31,640
-Yeah? Who's your boyfriend? -Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

1024
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,270
No.

1025
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,820
He knows you. He told me about you.

1026
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,990
He said you were staying at the Discount.

1027
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:43,110
In fact, a cop came by earlier, was looking for you.

1028
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,370
Said he was looking for a guy who can't remember anything...

1029
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,790
wouldn't know how he got here or what he'd done.

1030
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:50,410
Said I get a lot of guys around here like that.

1031
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,960
Chronic alcoholism is one cause of short-term memory loss.

1032
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,750
-Are you Teddy? -No. My name's Leonard.

1033
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,960
-Did Teddy send you? -I don't know.

1034
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:05,220
-What's happened to Jimmy? -I don't know that either.

1035
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,680
-Sorry. -You don't remember anything?

1036
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,100
You don't remember where you've been or what you'vejust done.

1037
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:14,810
No. I can't make new memories. Everything just fades.

1038
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,610
-Then why did you come here? -I found this in my pocket.

1039
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,400
Your pocket.

1040
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:50,180
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

1041
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,600
-No, thanks. -It's for a lot of money.

1042
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:56,150
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity. Help me out.

1043
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:09,700
Thank you.

1044
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,220
-On the house. -Thanks.

1045
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,390
It's completely fucked because nobody believes you.

1046
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,860
It's amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility.

1047
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,730
I guess it's some kind of poetic justice for not believing Sammy.

1048
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,990
You know the truth about my condition, Officer?

1049
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,820
You don't know anything.

1050
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:51,070
You feel angry, you don't know why.

1051
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,910
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

1052
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:57,370
You could do anything and not have the faintest idea 10 minutes later.

1053
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:59,830
Like Sammy. What if I've done something like Sammy?

1054
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:03,800
I didn't tell you what happened to Sammy and his wife?

1055
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:07,020
She came to see me at my office.

1056
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,720
I thought she was trying to catch me off guard...

1057
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,870
so I didn't tell her what I really thought,

1058
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:11,720
but I never said that he was taking...

1059
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,720
just that his condition was mental, not physical.

1060
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:16,770
I found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam.

1061
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,440
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

1062
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:39,410
She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her.

1063
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,540
So she found a way to test him.

1064
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,850
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

1065
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,860
She really thought she'd call his bluff.

1066
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:12,450
There you go.

1067
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:16,870
Or she just didn't wanna live with the things she'd put him through.

1068
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:27,840
Sammy.

1069
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,130
It's time for my shot.

1070
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,390
It won't hurt.

1071
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,560
She went into a coma and never recovered.

1072
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:29,820
Sammy couldn't understand or explain what happened.

1073
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:34,030
He's been in a home ever since.

1074
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:36,530
He doesn't even know that his wife is dead.

1075
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:39,990
I was wrong about Sammy, and I was wrong about his wife.

1076
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,000
She wasn't interested in the money.

1077
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,250
She just needed to understand his problem.

1078
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:47,750
His brain didn't respond to conditioning. But he wasn't a con man.

1079
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,250
When she looked into his eyes, she thought he could be the same person.

1080
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:53,720
When I looked into his eyes, I thought I saw recognition.

1081
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,930
Now I know. You fake it.

1082
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,850
If you think you're supposed to recognize somebody, you just pretend to.

1083
01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:01,600
You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors.

1084
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,480
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1085
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:09,820
What drug dealer?

1086
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:38,340
-Hey, Lenny, how you doing? -It's private back here.

1087
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:39,910
It's okay. We know each other. Right, kid?

1088
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:41,430
How did you know I was in here?

1089
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:43,520
TheJag's out front. Should have put it around back.

1090
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,310
What are you still doing here, Lenny?

1091
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:47,100
There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

1092
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:49,690
I guess I wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind.

1093
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:52,230
-Give me the keys. I'll move it. -It'll be all right for a minute.

1094
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,820
Wait out there.

1095
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:57,240
Give me a minute. I gotta get something for you.

1096
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:05,040
Fact six: Car license SG137IU.

1097
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:13,340
Look. Wait a minute, will ya?

1098
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,880
-We gotta get you out of here. -Why?

1099
01:31:18,970 --> 01:31:22,260
Man. Come on, Leonard. How many times I gotta tell you?

1100
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:24,720
-It's not safe for you to hang around here anymore. -Why not?

1101
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:26,730
Because that cop's looking for you.

1102
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:29,390
I gotta get you a new identity, some new clothes.

1103
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:32,110
A different car would do for now. So put these on.

1104
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:33,570
What cop?

1105
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:37,740
He's a bad cop. He's the one that checked you into the Discount Inn.

1106
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:39,940
He's been calling you for days, telling you shit,

1107
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:41,660
slipping envelopes under your door. Shit like that.

1108
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:44,450
-How do you know this? -He told me. He thinks it's funny.

1109
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,540
-He's been laughing at you. -You're full of shit.

1110
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,330
I'm not. He knows you're no good on the phone,

1111
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:49,460
so he's been calling you.

1112
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,540
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

1113
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:52,250
so he slips shit under your door

1114
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:54,420
to scare you into answering the phone again...

1115
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,170
giving you a line of crap about John G. being some local drug dealer.

1116
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,510
-Jimmy Grants. -Who'sJimmy Grants?

1117
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:02,550
Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1118
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,930
The cop wants to know how his operation's run.

1119
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:07,020
He's got some score in mind. Somehowyou're involved.

1120
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:08,770
Uh-huh. How do you know him?

1121
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:12,720
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.

1122
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,560
The local boys put us together.

1123
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:16,980
If he knew I was helping you, he'd fucking kill me.

1124
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:20,860
So take these clothes, put them on and get the fuck out of here.

1125
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:23,570
Come on, Leonard.Just go.

1126
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,180
You are full of shit.

1127
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:50,060
"Come by after. Natalie."

1128
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:51,640
"Ferdy's Bar."

1129
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,810
Hey, Jimmy.

1130
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:41,650
I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else.

1131
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,650
Sorry.

1132
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:45,740
That's okay.

1133
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,750
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar

1134
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:03,170
where his girlfriend works?

1135
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:06,510
But he's not gonna bring her along. He'll come by himself, right?

1136
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:10,810
I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.

1137
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:15,020
No, Officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1138
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:18,270
You're in the lobby? What do you look like?

1139
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:21,520
I'll be right there.

1140
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:04,570
Lenny.

1141
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,910
Officer Gammell.

1142
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:14,160
Yeah. Come on.

1143
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:33,140
-Smile. -Not here.

1144
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:35,770
Over here.

1145
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,440
-Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell? -You know what?

1146
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,740
Don't write Gammell,just Teddy.

1147
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,450
-Why? -I'm undercover.

1148
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,700
This is the directions where he's going.

1149
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:57,830
-My number's on the bottom if you need me. -You're not coming?

1150
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:59,830
No. It wouldn't be appropriate.

1151
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:07,460
Nice picture. I look thin.

1152
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:12,470
Hey, Lenny.

1153
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:14,550
Make him beg.

1154
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,890
Teddy!

1155
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:43,600
Hey, Teddy!

1156
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:51,730
Jimmy.

1157
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:56,110
-What the fuck are you doing here? -You Jimmy Grants?

1158
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,200
Expecting any other Jimmys out here, Memory Man?

1159
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:02,540
-Do you remember me? -Yeah, I remember you.

1160
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:05,040
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1161
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:05,830
Well?

1162
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,760
Motherfuck... Fuckin' retard!

1163
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,930
-Strip. -You're making a big fucking mistake, pal.

1164
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:19,300
Strip!

1165
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:23,980
My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off.

1166
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,640
Don't say anything else.

1167
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:28,150
-I knew I couldn't trust that fuck! -Take it off.

1168
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:32,320
Cock sucker.

1169
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,190
Your pants too.

1170
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,110
-Why? -I don't wanna get blood on them.

1171
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,200
Wait. Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1172
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:46,210
-Take your fuckin' pants off! -I've got 200 grand stashed in the car!

1173
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:49,000
-Just take it! -You think you can bargain with me?

1174
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,460
-Take the money and walk away! -I don't want your fuckin' money.

1175
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,960
Then what?

1176
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:58,180
-What do you want from me? -I want my fuckin' life back!

1177
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,980
Sammy.

1178
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:38,820
He said "Sammy." How does he know about Sammy?

1179
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,280
Oh, fuck.

1180
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,880
What have I done?

1181
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:07,470
Mister, I need help. There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.

1182
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,810
-We gotta get him to a doctor. -All right.

1183
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,900
I don't know what happened. I've got this memory thing.

1184
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:16,190
-Do I know you? -No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

1185
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:19,820
-Is he still breathing? -I don't know. Maybe.

1186
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:22,450
What the hell were you guys doing down here?

1187
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:26,070
I don't remember. I have this condition.

1188
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,870
I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cause this guy's dead.

1189
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:31,500
Ow! Lenny!That shit kills!

1190
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:35,120
So you remember me now, huh? You are a fuckin' cop.

1191
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:38,040
Yeah. And I'm the guy that helped you find him.

1192
01:41:38,130 --> 01:41:40,000
Get up. Get up.

1193
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:42,130
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1194
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,890
Who is that? He knew me.

1195
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:49,600
Of course he did. He raped your wife. He fucked up your brain.

1196
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,720
Bullshit. He's not the guy.

1197
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:56,150
His name is James F. Grants. John G. Check your tattoos.

1198
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:58,650
-What was he bringing the 200 grand for? -What?

1199
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:03,030
-What was it for? -A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

1200
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:06,570
-Is this a drug deal? -No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1201
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:08,680
Look, Leonard,Jimmy's your guy.

1202
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:10,280
I just figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1203
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:14,000
-How did he know me? -The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.

1204
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:17,380
The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came snooping around.

1205
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:20,000
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture of the dump.

1206
01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:22,460
-You're fucking using me. -No!You get half!

1207
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:25,170
He knew about Sammy! Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1208
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:28,640
You tell everybody about Sammy, everybody who'll listen.

1209
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:30,850
"Remember Sammy Jankis?" "Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1210
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:33,850
Great story. Gets better every time you tell it.

1211
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:36,730
So you lie to yourself to be happy.

1212
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:38,860
There's nothing wrong with that. We all do it.

1213
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:42,070
Who cares if there's a few little details you'd rather not remember?

1214
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:46,860
-What the fuck are you talking about? -I don't know.

1215
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:49,570
Your wife surviving the assault.

1216
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:52,290
Her not believing your condition.

1217
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:56,540
The torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside.

1218
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:58,420
The insulin.

1219
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:02,420
That's Sammy, not me. I told you about Sammy.

1220
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,510
Yeah, right. Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1221
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,590
Conditioning yourself to remember.

1222
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:10,260
-Learning through repetition. -Sammy let his wife kill herself.

1223
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:15,390
-Sammy ended up in an institution. -Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1224
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,640
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1225
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:20,690
You exposed him for what he was... a fraud.

1226
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:22,730
But I was wrong. That's the whole point.

1227
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,150
-See, Sammy's wife came to me. -Sammy didn't have a wife.

1228
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:32,240
It was your wife who had diabetes.

1229
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:39,620
Ouch.

1230
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,920
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1231
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,340
You sure?

1232
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:54,260
-Ouch. Cut it out. -She wasn't diabetic.

1233
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:59,060
You think I don't know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong with you?

1234
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:02,560
I guess I can only make you remember the things you wanna be true.

1235
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:05,020
-Like old Jimmy down there. -He's not the right guy.

1236
01:44:05,110 --> 01:44:07,280
He was to you.

1237
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:10,780
Come on. You got your revenge. Enjoy it while you still remember.

1238
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:13,370
What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?

1239
01:44:13,450 --> 01:44:16,080
-It makes all the difference. -Why? You're never gonna know.

1240
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:17,450
-Yes, I will. -No, you won't.

1241
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:19,000
I will. Somehow I'll know.

1242
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,500
-You won't remember! -When it's done, I will know. It'll be different.

1243
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:25,500
I thought so too. In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

1244
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:31,550
That's right. The real John G.

1245
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:35,220
I helped you find him over a year ago. He's already dead.

1246
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:38,180
-Don't lie to me anymore. -Look, Lenny.

1247
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:41,690
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case. I believed you.

1248
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:44,310
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

1249
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,900
I'm the one that helped you find the other guy

1250
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,690
in your bathroom that night...

1251
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:50,110
the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.

1252
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,660
We found him. You killed him.

1253
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:59,660
But you didn't remember. So I helped you start looking again...

1254
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:02,000
looking for the guy you already killed.

1255
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:04,290
Yeah? So who was he?

1256
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:06,750
Just some guy. Does it even matter who?

1257
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:11,380
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy. Just bad fucking luck.

1258
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:14,030
Couple of junkies too strung out

1259
01:45:14,030 --> 01:45:16,350
to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1260
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:21,310
But when you killed him, I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1261
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:23,850
But it didn't stick.

1262
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:26,690
Like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.

1263
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:35,990
I took that picture...just when you did it.

1264
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:39,910
Look how happy you are.

1265
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:43,000
I wanted to see that face again.

1266
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,880
-Gee, thanks. -Fuck you.

1267
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:49,710
I gave you a reason to live, and you were more than happy to help.

1268
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:53,970
You don't want the truth. You make up your own truth.

1269
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:56,010
Like your police file.

1270
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,850
It was complete when I gave it to you. Who took out the 12 pages?

1271
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:02,480
-You, probably. -No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1272
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,270
-Why would I do that? -To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1273
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,270
You know how many towns?

1274
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,520
How many John G.'s or James G.'s?

1275
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:12,650
Shit, Lenny. I'm a fucking John G.

1276
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:15,990
-Your name is Teddy. -My mother calls me Teddy.

1277
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:18,950
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1278
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:20,080
Cheer up.

1279
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:22,910
There's plenty of John G.'s for us to find.

1280
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:28,710
All you do is moan.

1281
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:31,130
I'm the one that has to live with what you've done.

1282
01:46:31,210 --> 01:46:32,920
I'm the one that put it all together.

1283
01:46:33,010 --> 01:46:35,460
You wander around, you're playing detective.

1284
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,680
You're living a dream, kid.

1285
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:41,850
A dead wife to pine for. A sense of purpose to your life.

1286
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:44,120
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end

1287
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:45,270
even if I wasn't in the picture.

1288
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,730
-I should kill you. -Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1289
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,820
You're not a killer. That's why you're so good at it.

1290
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:59,120
What are you doing? You know what time it is?

1291
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,280
It's beer o'clock. I'm buying.

1292
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:04,410
Fuck.

1293
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:15,630
I'm not a killer.

1294
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:19,470
I'm just someone who wanted to make things right.

1295
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,890
Can I just let myself forget what you've told me?

1296
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:48,500
Can I just let myself forget what you made me do?

1297
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,510
You think I just want another puzzle to solve?

1298
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:07,520
Another John G. to look for?

1299
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:10,600
You're a John G.

1300
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:14,400
So you can be my John G.

1301
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:18,950
"SG137IU"

1302
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:24,990
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1303
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:28,040
In your case, Teddy...

1304
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:31,080
yes, I will.

1305
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:46,310
Hey, that's not your car!

1306
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:48,970
-It is now. -Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1307
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:51,980
-Why not? -Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1308
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:53,770
Somebody'll recognize it!

1309
01:48:55,230 --> 01:48:58,320
I think I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

1310
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,780
I might hang on to this for a while.

1311
01:49:02,610 --> 01:49:03,910
Lenny.

1312
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:08,450
Will you help me find the keys?

1313
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:10,290
Help me find my keys.

1314
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:11,470
Lenny

1315
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,280
Lenny

1316
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,850
I have to believe in a world outside my own mind.

1317
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:38,110
I have to believe that my actions still have meaning...

1318
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:40,150
even if I can't remember them.

1319
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,990
I have to believe that when my eyes are closed...

1320
01:49:45,070 --> 01:49:47,160
the world's still here.

1321
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:50,790
Do I believe the world's still here?

1322
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:55,290
Is it still out there?

1323
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:00,130
Yeah.

1324
01:50:02,510 --> 01:50:05,300
We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.

1325
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,350
I'm no different.

1326
01:50:22,650 --> 01:50:24,450
Now, where was I?

1327
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:35,920
# We lay in each other's arms #

1328
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:42,870
# But the room is just an empty space #

1329
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:46,040
# I guess we lived it out #

1330
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:49,750
# Something in the air #

1331
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:55,620
# We smile too fast then can't think of a thing to say #

1332
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,760
# Lived with the best times #

1333
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:04,130
# Left with the worst #

1334
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:10,540
# I've danced with you too long #

1335
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:16,260
# Nothing left to save #

1336
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:22,200
# There's something in the air #

1337
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:26,300
# Something in my eye #

1338
01:51:26,370 --> 01:51:34,010
# I've danced with you too long yeah #

1339
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:38,450
# Something in the air #

1340
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:44,150
# Something in my eye #

1341
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:57,080
# Abracadoo #

1342
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:59,340
# I lose you #

1343
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:03,920
# We can't avoid the clash #

1344
01:52:04,030 --> 01:52:06,150
# The big mistake #

1345
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:10,390
# Now we're gonna pay and pay #

1346
01:52:12,110 --> 01:52:17,910
# I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you #

1347
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:22,180
# Lived all our best times #

1348
01:52:24,690 --> 01:52:27,060
# Left with the worst #

1349
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:33,600
# I've danced with you too long #

1350
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:38,600
# Say what you will #

1351
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:46,450
# But there's something in the air #

1352
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:49,080
# Something in my eye #

1353
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:56,220
# I've danced with you too long #

1354
01:52:56,330 --> 01:53:00,830
# There's something I have to say #

1355
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:05,400
# There's something in the air #

1356
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:10,480
# danced with you too long #
