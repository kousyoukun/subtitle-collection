You kind of learn to trust your own handwriting.

That becomes an important part of your life. You write yourself notes.

And where you put your notes... That also becomes important.

Particular pockets for particular things.

00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:23,162
I just can't make new memories. So I can't remember talking to you.

160
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:25,705
What did we talk about? Oh, Sammy Jankis.

161
00:16:25,773 --> 00:16:28,071
I tell people about Sammy to help them understand.

162
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:31,407
Sammy's story helps me understand my own situation.

163
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:36,109
Well, Sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.

164
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:40,620
I have a more graceful solution to the memory problem.

165
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:45,391
I'm disciplined and organized.

166
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:48,587
I use habit and routine to make my life possible.

167
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:52,120
Sammy had no drive, no reason to make it work.

168
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,068
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.

She will help you out of pity."

- Natalie? - You don't remember me.

- I'm sorry. I should have explained. I have this... - You did explain, Lenny.

175
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:49,754
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.

176
00:17:49,824 --> 00:17:53,419
- Yeah, I know. You told me. - Then I probably told you how much I hated it.

00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:55,428
Yeah.

Do you mind taking your glasses off? It's hard for me to...

Thanks. So you have information for me?

180
00:18:03,537 --> 00:18:06,301
- Is that what your little note says? - Yeah.

181

Must be tough living your life according to a couple of scraps of paper.

Mix your laundry list with your grocery list, and you'll end up eating your underwear.

183
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:17,213
I guess that's why you have those freaky tattoos.

184
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:21,448
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

185
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:24,514
Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you. It's nothing personal.

186
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:30,358
I do have information for you.

187
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:33,229
You gave me a license plate number.

188
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,497
Had my friend at D.M.V. Trace it.

189
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,539
Guess what name came up.

190
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:42,872
John Edward Gammell. John G.

191
00:18:42,943 --> 00:18:45,571
- Do you know him? - No.

192
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:48,740
But his face on his driver's license looked really familiar.

193
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:50,841
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

194
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:54,479
Here's a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all.

195
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:56,489
Are you sure you want this?

196
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:58,821
Have I told you what this man did?

197
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:01,726
- Yeah. - Then you shouldn't have to ask.

198
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:04,025
But even if you get revenge, you're not gonna remember it.

199
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:06,191
You're not even gonna know that it happened.

200
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:09,600
My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make any difference whether I know about it.

201
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,471
Just because there are things I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless.

202
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:18,068
The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?

203
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:21,706
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself,

Why?

207
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:35,757
Because you like to remember her.

208
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:42,193
She was beautiful. To me, she was perfect.

209

No. Don't just recite the words.

210

Close your eyes... and remember her.

211
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:04,917
You can just feel the details.

212

The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.

213
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,161
And you can feel these extreme moments...

even if you don't want to.

215

You put these together, and you get the feel of a person.

216
00:20:27,348 --> 00:20:31,341
Enough to know how much you miss them...

217
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:38,852
and how much you hate the person who took them away.

218

I, um... I added an address in here.

219
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:55,431
It might be useful. It's an abandoned place outside of town.

[Thinking] "Remember Sammy Jankis."

235
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:22,462
I met Sammy through work. Insurance. I was an investigator.

236
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:25,259
I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phony.

237
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:27,596
I had to see through people's bullshit.

238
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:29,966
It was useful experience, 'cause now it's my life.

239
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:32,972
When I meet someone, I don't know if I've met them before.

240
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,907
I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.

241
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:39,275
My job taught me the best way to find out what someone knew was just to let them talk...

242
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:42,247
and watch the eyes and the body language.

243
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:45,410
If someone scratches their nose while they're talking, experts tell you it means they're lying.

244
00:22:45,486 --> 00:22:48,978
It really means they're nervous. People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.

261
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:50,447
- Why not? - Because your notes could be unreliable.

262
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:52,610
- Memory's unreliable. - Oh, please!

263
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:55,621
No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good.

264
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:58,624
Ask the police. Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

265
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:01,752
- Cops don't catch a killer by remembering stuff. - Right...

266
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:04,991
They collect facts, they make notes, and they draw conclusions.

267
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:08,831
Facts, not memories. That's how you investigate. It's what I used to do.

268
00:24:08,902 --> 00:24:13,100
Look, memory can change the shape of a room. It can change the color of a car.

269
00:24:13,173 --> 00:24:15,266
And memories can be distorted.

270

They're just an interpretation. They're not a record.

271

They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

He destroyed my ability to live.

- But then I rented you another room on top of it. - Why?

291
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:59,242
Business is slow. I mean, I told my boss about the...

292
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:02,339
your condition and stuff, and he said try and rent him another room.

Just two, so far.

Well, at least you're being honest about ripping me off.

00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,722
Well, you're not gonna remember anyway.

You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

Now, the guy's a 58-year-old semiretired accountant.

307

He and his wife had been in this car accident. Nothing too serious.

308
00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:01,468
But he's acting funny. He can't get a handle on what's going on.

The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus.

Nothing conclusive, but Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.

His wife calls the insurance company, and I get sent in.

313
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:21,590
Now, this is my first big claims investigation, so I really check into it.

314
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:24,425
- Can I get you some coffee? - Sammy can think just fine,

315
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:26,898
but he can't make any new memories.

316
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:29,595
- He can only remember things for a couple of minutes. - This is Mr. Shelby.

317
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:32,934
He'd watch TV, but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing.

318
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:35,702
He couldn't remember how it began. He liked commercials.

319
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:37,539
- They were short. - Sammy.

320
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:39,545
It's time for my shot.

321
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:41,672
The crazy part was that this guy...

322
00:27:41,748 --> 00:27:45,275
who couldn't even follow the plot of Green Acres anymore...

323
00:27:45,352 --> 00:27:48,446
could do the most complicated things...

324
00:27:48,522 --> 00:27:52,185
as long as he learned them before the accident...

325
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:54,523
and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.

326
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:58,428
- Be gentle. - Now, the doctors assure me...

327
00:27:58,498 --> 00:28:02,525
there's a real condition called anterial-grade memory loss, or short-term memory loss.

328
00:28:02,602 --> 00:28:04,866
It's rare, but legit.

329
00:28:06,606 --> 00:28:09,336
Every time I see him...

330
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:11,877
I catch this look,

331
00:28:11,945 --> 00:28:15,039
this slight look of recognition.

332
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:17,447
But he says he can't remember me at all.

333
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:20,543
Sammy, it's okay. I got it. I got it.

334
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,088
- Hi, Mr. Shelby. - Hi, Mrs. Jankis.

335
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:27,752
- Now, I can read people, and I'm thinking: Bad actor. - This is Mr. Shelby, Sammy.

336
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:30,729
So now I'm suspicious, and I order more tests.

337
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,131
[Thinking] Awake.

338
00:28:37,204 --> 00:28:40,002
Oh, where am I?

339
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:44,636
Somebody's bedroom.

340
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:48,814
Ah, it must be her room.

341
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:51,407
But who is she?

342
00:28:54,855 --> 00:28:57,551
[Moaning]

343
00:28:59,693 --> 00:29:01,627
It's only me.

344
00:29:03,897 --> 00:29:06,866
- Did you sleep okay? - Yeah. You?

345
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:12,337
Yeah. Oh, shit. Shit! I got to be someplace.

346
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:20,305
- It's pretty weird. - It's useful.

347
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,974
You never write a phone number on your hand?

348
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:28,385
I, um... I should be able to talk to my friend today about the license plate.

349
00:29:28,455 --> 00:29:32,892
- Yeah, the license plate. - John G.'s license plate.

350
00:29:35,262 --> 00:29:37,457
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

[Footsteps]

Mm, if it's registered in this state,

357
00:30:11,197 --> 00:30:14,462
it should only take a couple of seconds to pull up his license and registration.

358
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:17,025
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

359

Do you think we could just arrange a meeting now? I'm not too good on the phone.

You know, it's great that you...

361
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:36,288
well, that you're helping me like this.

362
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:39,848
I'm helping you because you helped me.

363
00:30:51,972 --> 00:30:55,874
So next time you see me, will you remember me?

364
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:15,417
[Whispering] I think you will.

365
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:18,328
I'm sorry.

366
00:31:20,634 --> 00:31:24,263
Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?

367
00:31:34,848 --> 00:31:37,544
[Engine Starts]

368
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:43,522
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.

369
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,559
Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.

370
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:50,392
But I find something in my research: Conditioning.

371
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:53,591
Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.

372
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,568
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike. You just get better through practice.

373
00:31:56,636 --> 00:31:59,605
It's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory.

374
00:31:59,673 --> 00:32:03,268
So I had the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning.

375
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:07,245
- Just pick up any three objects. - That's a test?

376
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:09,941
Hey, where were you guys when I did my C.P. A?

377
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:12,143
[Laughs] Sorry.

00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:17,982
- [Object Buzzes] - Ow! What the fuck?

380
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:21,789
- It's a test, Sammy. - Well, test this, you fucking quack.

381
00:32:21,861 --> 00:32:24,762
[Leonard] Some of the objects were electrified.

382
00:32:24,831 --> 00:32:27,732
They'd give him a small shock. They kept repeating the test,

383
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:29,962
always with the same objects electrified.

384
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:33,267
The point was to see if Sammy could learn to avoid the electrified objects...

385
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:35,603
not by memory, but by instinct.

- Who is he? - Calm down. Okay?

392
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,771
This is my problem. It has nothing to do with your investigation.

393
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,513
- How did you get me into this? - You offered to help when you saw what he did to my face.

394
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:24,387
- How do I know he did that? - Because I came straight to you after he did it.

395
00:33:24,457 --> 00:33:28,393
- I showed you what he did, and I asked you to help me. - And I just take your word?

00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:32,192
- Yeah. - Something doesn't feel right.

You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

I don't even know how long she's been gone.

It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here...

because she's gone to the bathroom or something.

441
00:36:42,588 --> 00:36:45,352
But somehow I just...

442
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:48,724
I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.

443

If I could just reach over...

and touch her side of the bed...

I would know that it was cold.

But I can't.

00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:15,620
I know I can't have her back.

448
00:37:15,688 --> 00:37:20,352
But I don't want to wake up in the morning thinking she's still here.

449
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:26,263
I lie here not knowing how long I've been alone.

450
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:34,768
So how...

451
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:37,105
How can I heal?

452
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:44,642
How am I supposed to heal if I can't... feel time?

455
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:29,980
They kept testing Sammy for months,

456
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:33,044
always with the same objects carrying an electrical charge.

457
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:35,215
- [Object Buzzes] - Ow! What the fuck?

458
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,725
- It's a test, Sammy. - Test this, you quack!

459
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:40,490
Even with total short-term memory loss,

460
00:39:40,563 --> 00:39:43,327
Sammy should have learned to instinctively stop picking up the wrong objects.

461
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:47,460
All the previous cases responded to conditioning. Sammy didn't respond at all.

462
00:39:47,537 --> 00:39:51,132
It was enough to suggest that his condition was psychological, not physical.

463
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:55,576
We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

464
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:59,581
His wife got stuck with the bills, and I got a big promotion.

465
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:03,847
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless.

466
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,981
But it works for me. I live the way Sammy couldn't.

467
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:10,821
Habit and routine make my life possible.

468
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:13,828
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle. Hang on a sec?

Now, the police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house.

632
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:06,211
The car was stolen. Bloody prints were all over it.

I got friends in the department. They gave me a copy of it.

With my condition, it's really tough. I can't keep it all in mind at once.

I have to summarize the different sections. And there's pages missing.

I guess I've been trying to log them all.

But they weren't even looking for John G.

The stuff they found in the car just fit in with what they believed had happened,

00:57:27,942 --> 00:57:31,173
so they didn't chase any of it up.

There's something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn't ring true for me.

653
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,861

Yeah, yeah. I guess.

He didn't believe me.

He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

I read about your condition, Leonard.

You know what one of the causes of short-term memory loss is? Venereal disease.

Come on. Find a pen. Write this note. Write down what happened.

I'm not too good on the phone. I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them.

You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife?

Oh, well, that depends on if he's here in town or if he's moved on.

I have my file here.

Can I ask you something? If you have all of that information,

920
01:18:31,205 --> 01:18:34,834
then why haven't the police found him for you?

- Well, they're not looking for him. - Why not?

922
01:18:37,478 --> 01:18:42,438
They don't think he exists. You see, I told them what I remembered.

01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:44,451
I was asleep.

Look, the police did not believe me. If we check the police...

01:33:39,947 --> 01:33:43,314
I'm sorry. I, uh, thought you were somebody else.

1087
01:33:43,383 --> 01:33:45,317
Sorry.

1088
01:33:45,385 --> 01:33:47,444
That's okay.

1089
01:34:00,767 --> 01:34:05,602
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works?

1090
01:34:05,672 --> 01:34:09,199
But he's not gonna bring her along. He'll come by himself, right?

1091
01:34:09,276 --> 01:34:13,474
I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.

1092
01:34:13,547 --> 01:34:17,142
No, officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1093
01:34:17,217 --> 01:34:19,981
You're in the lobby? What do you look like?

1094
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:23,223
I'll be right there.

1095
01:35:05,332 --> 01:35:07,266
Lenny.

1096
01:35:09,569 --> 01:35:11,901
Officer Gammell.

1097
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:15,836
Yeah. Come on.

1098
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:37,153
- Hey, smile. - Oh, don't... Not here. Over here.

1099
01:35:43,103 --> 01:35:46,129
- Now, is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell? - You know what?

1100
01:35:46,206 --> 01:35:48,640
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1101
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:51,143
- Why? - I'm undercover.

1102
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:56,415
This is the directions where he's going.

1103
01:35:56,483 --> 01:35:59,509
- My number's on the bottom if you need me. - You're not coming?

1104
01:35:59,586 --> 01:36:01,520
No. It wouldn't be appropriate.

1105
01:36:06,059 --> 01:36:09,825
Nice picture. I look thin.

1106
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:16,268
Hey, Lenny. Make him beg.

1107
01:37:21,334 --> 01:37:25,430
[Vehicle Approaching]

1108
01:37:38,618 --> 01:37:40,552
[Man] Teddy!

1109
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:45,218
Hey, Teddy!

1110
01:37:48,161 --> 01:37:49,958
Teddy!

1111
01:37:52,265 --> 01:37:54,199
Jimmy.

1112
01:37:54,267 --> 01:37:56,258
What the fuck are you doing here?

1113
01:37:56,336 --> 01:37:59,897
- You Jimmy Grants? - Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man?

1114
01:37:59,973 --> 01:38:04,239
- Do you remember me? - Yeah, I remember you.

1115
01:38:04,311 --> 01:38:07,109
Where the fuck's Teddy? Well?

1116
01:38:11,651 --> 01:38:14,415
Motherfuck... What the fuck are you doing?

1117
01:38:16,556 --> 01:38:19,616
- Strip. - You're making a big fucking mistake, pal.

1118
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:22,662
Strip!

1119
01:38:22,729 --> 01:38:26,756
- My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off. - Don't say anything else.

1120
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:29,825
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck! - Take it off.

1121
01:38:34,074 --> 01:38:38,408
- Your pants too. - Why?

1122
01:38:38,478 --> 01:38:40,810
I don't wanna get blood on them.

1123
01:38:40,881 --> 01:38:43,907
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1124
01:38:43,984 --> 01:38:47,920
- Take your fuckin' pants off! - I've got two hundred grand stashed in the car!

1125
01:38:47,988 --> 01:38:50,684
- Just take it! - You think you can bargain with me?

1126
01:38:50,757 --> 01:38:53,123
- Just take the money and walk away! - I don't want your money!

1127
01:38:53,193 --> 01:38:55,627
Then what?

1128
01:38:55,695 --> 01:38:58,994
- What do you want from me? - I want my fuckin' life back!

1129
01:40:30,457 --> 01:40:32,425
Sammy.

1130
01:40:38,465 --> 01:40:40,524
[Thinking] He said "Sammy." How does he know about Sammy?

1131
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,465
Oh, fuck.

1132
01:41:02,555 --> 01:41:05,820
[Thinking] What have I done?

1133
01:41:05,892 --> 01:41:09,157
Hey, mister, I need help. There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.

1134
01:41:09,229 --> 01:41:12,062
- We gotta get him to a doctor. - All right.

1135
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,234
I don't know what happened.

1136
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:18,635
- I've got this memory thing. Do I know you? - No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

1137
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:22,004
- Is he still breathing? - I don't know. Maybe.

1138
01:41:22,075 --> 01:41:24,100
What the hell were you guys doing down here?

1139
01:41:24,177 --> 01:41:27,112
Well, I don't remember. I have this condition.

1140
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:30,581
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cause this guy's dead.

1141
01:41:30,650 --> 01:41:33,676
Ouch! Lenny! That shit kills!

1142
01:41:33,753 --> 01:41:36,813
- So you remember me now, huh? - You are a fuckin' cop.

1143
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:39,256
Yeah. And I'm the guy that helped you find him.

1144
01:41:39,326 --> 01:41:41,294
Get up. Get up.

1145
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:43,829
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1146
01:41:46,533 --> 01:41:48,558
Who is that? He knew me.

1147
01:41:48,635 --> 01:41:51,297
Of course he did. He raped your wife. He fucked up your brain.

1148
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:53,396
Bullshit. He's not the guy.

1149
01:41:53,473 --> 01:41:57,842
His name is James F. Grants. John G. Check your tattoos.

1150
01:41:57,911 --> 01:42:01,347
- What was he bringing the two hundred grand for? - What?

1151
01:42:01,414 --> 01:42:04,713
- What was it for? - A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

1152
01:42:04,784 --> 01:42:08,515
- Is this a drug deal? - No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1153
01:42:08,588 --> 01:42:10,522
Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy.

1154
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:13,058
- I just figured we'd make a few dollars on the side. - How did he know me?

1155
01:42:13,126 --> 01:42:15,686
The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.

1156
01:42:15,762 --> 01:42:19,061
The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came snooping around.

1157
01:42:19,132 --> 01:42:21,191
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture of the dump.

1158
01:42:21,267 --> 01:42:24,168
- You're fucking using me. - No! You get half!

1159
01:42:24,237 --> 01:42:26,865
He knew about Sammy! Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1160
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:30,341
You tell everybody about Sammy, everybody who'll listen.

1161
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:32,537
"Remember Sammy Jankis?" "Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1162
01:42:32,612 --> 01:42:35,547
Great story. It gets better every time you tell it.

1163
01:42:35,615 --> 01:42:38,413
So you lie to yourself to be happy.

1164
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:40,544
There's nothing wrong with that. We all do it.

1165
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:43,748
Who cares if there's a few little details you'd rather not remember?

1166
01:42:46,192 --> 01:42:48,558
- What the fuck are you talking about? - I don't know.

1167
01:42:48,628 --> 01:42:51,995
Your wife's surviving the assault.

1168
01:42:52,065 --> 01:42:56,001
Her not believing your condition. The torment and pain and anguish...

1169
01:42:56,069 --> 01:42:58,731
tearing her up inside.

1170
01:42:58,805 --> 01:43:01,330
The insulin.

1171
01:43:01,408 --> 01:43:04,104
That's Sammy, not me. I told you about Sammy.

1172
01:43:04,177 --> 01:43:07,203
Yeah, right. Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1173
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:09,271
Conditioning yourself to remember.

1174
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:11,943
- Learning through repetition. - Sammy let his wife kill herself.

1175
01:43:12,018 --> 01:43:17,081
- Sammy ended up in an institution. - Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1176
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:19,352
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1177
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:22,589
You exposed him for what he was... a fraud.

1178
01:43:22,662 --> 01:43:25,529
But I was wrong. That's the whole point.

1179
01:43:25,598 --> 01:43:28,863
- See, Sammy's wife came to me. - Sammy didn't have a wife.

1180
01:43:31,604 --> 01:43:34,767
It was your wife who had diabetes.

1181
01:43:40,313 --> 01:43:42,907
Ouch.

1182
01:43:42,982 --> 01:43:45,610
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1183
01:43:45,685 --> 01:43:47,619
You sure?

1184
01:43:52,826 --> 01:43:56,592
- Ouch. Cut it out. - She wasn't diabetic.

1185
01:43:56,663 --> 01:44:00,759
You think I don't know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong with you?

1186
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:04,270
Well, I guess I can only make you remember the things you wanna be true.

1187
01:44:04,337 --> 01:44:06,737
- Like old Jimmy down there. - He's not the right guy.

1188
01:44:06,806 --> 01:44:08,967
He was to you.

1189
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:11,476
Come on. You got your revenge. Enjoy it while you still remember.

1190
01:44:11,544 --> 01:44:15,071
What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?

1191
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:17,275
- It makes all the difference. - Why? You're never gonna know.

1192
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:20,683
- Yes, I will. I will. - No, you won't. - Somehow I'll know.

1193
01:44:20,753 --> 01:44:23,187
- You won't remember! - When it's done, I will know. It'll be different.

1194
01:44:23,256 --> 01:44:26,350
Well, I thought so too. In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

1195
01:44:28,995 --> 01:44:33,227
That's right. The real John G.

1196
01:44:33,299 --> 01:44:36,564
I helped you find him over a year ago. He's already dead.

1197
01:44:36,636 --> 01:44:40,436
- Don't lie to me anymore. - Look, Lenny.

1198
01:44:40,507 --> 01:44:43,374
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case. I believed you.

1199
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,003
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

1200
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:49,071
I'm the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night,

1201
01:44:49,148 --> 01:44:51,810
the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.

1202
01:44:51,885 --> 01:44:54,319
We found him. You killed him.

1203
01:44:56,022 --> 01:45:01,358
But you didn't remember. So I helped you start looking again,

1204
01:45:01,427 --> 01:45:03,657
looking for the guy you already killed.

1205
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:05,994
Oh, yeah. So who was he?

1206
01:45:06,065 --> 01:45:08,465
Just some guy. I mean, does it even matter who?

1207
01:45:08,535 --> 01:45:13,063
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy. Just bad fucking luck.

1208
01:45:13,139 --> 01:45:18,372
Couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1209
01:45:18,444 --> 01:45:23,507
But when you killed him, I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1210
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:26,051
But it didn't stick.

1211
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:28,349
Like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.

1212
01:45:33,059 --> 01:45:36,927
I took that picture... just when you did it.

1213
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:42,100
Look how happy you are.

1214
01:45:42,168 --> 01:45:44,693
I wanted to see that face again.

1215
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:47,569
- Oh, gee, thanks. - Fuck you.

1216
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:51,406
I gave you a reason to live, and you were more than happy to help.

1217
01:45:51,477 --> 01:45:55,675
You don't want the truth. You make up your own truth.

1218
01:45:55,748 --> 01:45:57,682
Like your police file.

1219
01:45:57,750 --> 01:46:01,083
It was complete when I gave it to you. Who took out the 12 pages?

1220
01:46:01,154 --> 01:46:04,180
- You, probably. - No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1221
01:46:04,257 --> 01:46:06,782
- Why would I do that? - To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1222
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:09,953
Do you know how many... how many towns?

1223
01:46:10,029 --> 01:46:12,224
How many John G's or James G's?

1224
01:46:12,298 --> 01:46:14,357
I mean, shit, Lenny, I'm a fucking John G.

1225
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:17,699
- Your name is Teddy. - My mother calls me Teddy.

1226
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:19,761
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1227
01:46:19,839 --> 01:46:21,773
Cheer up.

1228
01:46:21,841 --> 01:46:24,605
There's plenty of John G's for us to find.

1229
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:30,575
All you do is moan.

1230
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:32,618
I'm the one that has to live with what you've done.

1231
01:46:32,685 --> 01:46:34,619
I'm the one that put it all together.

1232
01:46:34,687 --> 01:46:39,386
You, you wander around, you're playing detective. You live in a dream, kid.

1233
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:42,451
A dead wife to pine for. A sense of purpose to your life.

1234
01:46:42,528 --> 01:46:46,965
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end even if I wasn't in the picture.

1235
01:46:48,234 --> 01:46:51,431
- I should kill you. - Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1236
01:46:51,504 --> 01:46:55,406
You're not a killer. That's why you're so good at it.

1237
01:46:57,677 --> 01:47:00,805
Come on. What are you doing? You know what time it is?

1238
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,973
It's beer o'clock. I'm buying.

1239
01:47:04,984 --> 01:47:06,918
Fuck.

1240
01:47:16,195 --> 01:47:18,527
[Thinking] I'm not a killer.

1241
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:22,090
I'm just someone who wanted to make things right.

1242
01:47:27,006 --> 01:47:30,339
Can I just let myself forget what you've told me?

1243
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:50,194
Can I just let myself forget what you made me do?

1244
01:48:04,444 --> 01:48:06,207
You think I just want another puzzle to solve?

1245
01:48:06,279 --> 01:48:09,180
Another John G. To look for?

1246
01:48:09,248 --> 01:48:11,546
You're a John G.

1247
01:48:13,986 --> 01:48:16,079
So you can be my John G.

1248
01:48:24,063 --> 01:48:27,328
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1249
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,767
In your case, Teddy,

1250
01:48:30,837 --> 01:48:33,499
yes, I will.

1251
01:48:44,984 --> 01:48:47,509
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

1252
01:48:47,587 --> 01:48:50,681
- It is now. - Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1253
01:48:50,757 --> 01:48:53,089
- Why not? - Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1254
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:56,094
Somebody'll recognize it!

1255
01:48:56,162 --> 01:49:00,895
You know, I think I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

1256
01:49:00,967 --> 01:49:04,232
I might hang on to this for a while.

1257
01:49:04,303 --> 01:49:08,797
- Lenny. Look, don't... - Will you help me find the keys?

1258
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:11,901
Help me find my keys.

1259
01:49:11,978 --> 01:49:13,912
Lenny!

1260
01:49:34,233 --> 01:49:37,532
[Thinking] I have to believe in a world outside my own mind.

1261
01:49:37,603 --> 01:49:39,798
I have to believe that my actions still have meaning,

1262
01:49:39,872 --> 01:49:42,841
even if I can't remember them.

1263
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:46,345
I have to believe that when my eyes are closed,

1264
01:49:46,412 --> 01:49:48,846
the world's still here.

1265
01:49:50,049 --> 01:49:52,449
Do I believe the world's still here?

1266
01:49:55,388 --> 01:49:57,948
Is it still out there?

1267
01:50:00,059 --> 01:50:01,822
Yeah.

1268
01:50:04,197 --> 01:50:06,961
We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.

1269
01:50:09,335 --> 01:50:11,030
I'm no different.

1270
01:50:23,583 --> 01:50:25,312
Now, where was I?

1271
01:50:26,419 --> 01:50:34,451
[Skipped item nr. 383]

1272
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:37,587
We lay in each other's arms

1273
01:50:39,932 --> 01:50:44,494
But the room is just an empty space

1274
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:47,664
I guess we lived it out

1275
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:51,369
Something in the air

1276
01:50:51,444 --> 01:50:57,246
We smile too fast then can't think of a thing to say

1277
01:50:58,618 --> 01:51:01,416
Lived with the best times

1278
01:51:03,556 --> 01:51:05,786
Left with the worst

1279
01:51:08,928 --> 01:51:12,193
I've danced with you too long

1280
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:17,893
Nothing left to save

1281
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:23,806
There's something in the air

1282
01:51:23,876 --> 01:51:27,903
Something in my eye

1283
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:35,648
I've danced with you too long, yeah

1284
01:51:35,721 --> 01:51:40,090
Something in the air

1285
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:45,791
Something in my eye

1286
01:51:56,242 --> 01:51:58,676
Abracadoo

1287
01:51:58,744 --> 01:52:00,939
I lose you

1288
01:52:02,615 --> 01:52:05,550
We can't avoid the clash

1289
01:52:05,618 --> 01:52:07,779
The big mistake

1290
01:52:09,388 --> 01:52:12,016
Now we're gonna pay and pay

1291
01:52:13,693 --> 01:52:19,495
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you

1292
01:52:20,666 --> 01:52:23,760
Lived all our best times

1293
01:52:26,238 --> 01:52:28,638
Left with the worst

1294
01:52:31,377 --> 01:52:35,177
I've danced with you too long

1295
01:52:37,583 --> 01:52:40,211
Say what you will

1296
01:52:40,286 --> 01:52:48,057
But there's something in the air

1297
01:52:48,127 --> 01:52:50,687
Something in my eye

1298
01:52:50,763 --> 01:52:57,794
I've danced with you too long

1299
01:52:57,870 --> 01:53:02,398
There's something I have to say

1300
01:53:02,475 --> 01:53:06,969
There's something in the air

1301
01:53:07,046 --> 01:53:12,074
Danced with you too long
