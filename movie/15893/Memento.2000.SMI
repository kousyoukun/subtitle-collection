So, where are you?<br>You're in some motel room?
<SYNC Start=160241 End=163282><P Class=ENCC>
You just wake up and you're in...<br>in a motel room.
<SYNC Start=163491 End=168198><P Class=ENCC>
Here's the key. It feels like it's<br>the first time you're there, but...
<SYNC Start=168408 End=173032><P Class=ENCC>
perhaps you've been there<br>for a week, three months.
<SYNC Start=173241 End=177907><P Class=ENCC>
It's kinda hard to say, I don't know.<br>It's just an anonymous room.
<SYNC Start=177907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=180533 End=183532><P Class=ENCC>
This guy... he's here alright.
<SYNC Start=183532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=185783 End=187240><P Class=ENCC>
Lenny!
<SYNC Start=187240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=187866 End=189032><P Class=ENCC>
It's Leonard.
<SYNC Start=189032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=190699 End=193907><P Class=ENCC>
-Like I told you before.<br>-Did you? I must've forgotten.
<SYNC Start=193907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=195699 End=199823><P Class=ENCC>
-I've told you about my condition?<br>-Only every time I see you.
<SYNC Start=199823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=209449 End=211532><P Class=ENCC>
-It's my car.<br>-This is your car.
<SYNC Start=211783 End=213615><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, you're in<br>a playful mood.
<SYNC Start=213615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=215033 End=219032><P Class=ENCC>
-Don't make fun of my handicap.<br>-Just trying to have a little fun.
<SYNC Start=219032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=226199 End=228032><P Class=ENCC>
Roll up your window.
<SYNC Start=228032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=234366 End=237365><P Class=ENCC>
-It's broken.<br>-I can get that fixed for you.
<SYNC Start=237365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=238366 End=241323><P Class=ENCC>
-So, where to, Sherlock?<br>-I got a lead on a place.
<SYNC Start=241533 End=244032><P Class=ENCC>
-Why the hell do you wanna go there?<br>-You know it?
<SYNC Start=244241 End=246865><P Class=ENCC>
It's just this fucked-up building.<br>Why do you wanna go there?
<SYNC Start=246865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=248116 End=249740><P Class=ENCC>
I don't remember.
<SYNC Start=249740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=269824 End=273073><P Class=ENCC>
-Looks like somebody's home.<br>-That thing's been here for years.
<SYNC Start=273073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=276866 End=282073><P Class=ENCC>
-The tracks are only a few days old.<br>-Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?
<SYNC Start=282073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=284116 End=286157><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=286157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=293074 End=294782><P Class=ENCC>
Let's take a look inside.
<SYNC Start=294782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=313033 End=314740><P Class=ENCC>
"Teddy."
<SYNC Start=314949 End=319115><P Class=ENCC>
"Don't believe his lies.<br>He is the one. Kill him."
<SYNC Start=319324 End=323532><P Class=ENCC>
I finally found him.<br>How long have I been looking?
<SYNC Start=323532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=324741 End=326490><P Class=ENCC>
Find anything?
<SYNC Start=326490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=327533 End=330573><P Class=ENCC>
Didn't think so.<br>Let's go, huh?
<SYNC Start=331033 End=332490><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, fuck this.
<SYNC Start=332490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=334616 End=338532><P Class=ENCC>
You're gonna pay for what you did.<br>You beg forgiveness, then you pay.
<SYNC Start=338532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=343324 End=345907><P Class=ENCC>
You don't have a clue,<br>you freak.
<SYNC Start=346158 End=349698><P Class=ENCC>
Beg my wife's forgiveness<br>before I blow your brains out.
<SYNC Start=349908 End=353198><P Class=ENCC>
Leonard, you don't know<br>what's going on.
<SYNC Start=353408 End=355740><P Class=ENCC>
-You don't even know my name.<br>-Teddy.
<SYNC Start=355949 End=357990><P Class=ENCC>
That's 'cause you read it<br>off a fucking picture.
<SYNC Start=357990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=358783 End=361365><P Class=ENCC>
You don't know<br>who you are.
<SYNC Start=361574 End=363990><P Class=ENCC>
I'm Leonard Shelby.<br>I'm from San Francisco.
<SYNC Start=364199 End=368032><P Class=ENCC>
That's who you were.<br>That's not what you've become.
<SYNC Start=368199 End=370448><P Class=ENCC>
-Shut your mouth.<br>-You want to know, Lenny?
<SYNC Start=370658 End=373740><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.<br>Let's go down to the basement.
<SYNC Start=373740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=374616 End=378948><P Class=ENCC>
Let's go down, you and me, together.<br>Then you'll know who you really are.
<SYNC Start=378948><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=387033 End=390032><P Class=ENCC>
Just an anonymous room.<br>There's nothing in the drawers.
<SYNC Start=390199 End=393448><P Class=ENCC>
But you look anyway.<br>Nothing except the Gideon Bible...
<SYNC Start=393658 End=396448><P Class=ENCC>
which I of course<br>read religiously.
<SYNC Start=396448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=398449 End=402740><P Class=ENCC>
You know who you are, and you<br>know kind of all about yourself.
<SYNC Start=402949 End=407532><P Class=ENCC>
But, just for day-to-day stuff,<br>notes are really useful.
<SYNC Start=407532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=408533 End=413032><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy Jankis had the same problem,<br>but he really had no system.
<SYNC Start=413241 End=417698><P Class=ENCC>
He wrote a ridiculous amount of notes<br>but he'd get them all mixed up.
<SYNC Start=418033 End=419782><P Class=ENCC>
You really do need<br>a system if...
<SYNC Start=420033 End=421365><P Class=ENCC>
if you're gonna<br>make it work.
<SYNC Start=421365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=478908 End=482073><P Class=ENCC>
-I'm Mr. Shelby, from 3O4.<br>-What can I do for you, Leonard?
<SYNC Start=482073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=483408 End=484907><P Class=ENCC>
Burt.
<SYNC Start=485116 End=487448><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not sure, I think I may have<br>asked you to hold my calls.
<SYNC Start=487658 End=490407><P Class=ENCC>
-You don't know?<br>-I'm not too good on the phone.
<SYNC Start=490574 End=493823><P Class=ENCC>
You said you like to look people<br>in the eye when you talk to them.
<SYNC Start=493823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=495033 End=498532><P Class=ENCC>
-You don't remember saying that.<br>-Well, I have this condition.
<SYNC Start=498908 End=501032><P Class=ENCC>
-Condition?<br>-It's my memory.
<SYNC Start=501199 End=503532><P Class=ENCC>
-Amnesia?<br>-No, it's different from that.
<SYNC Start=503699 End=506532><P Class=ENCC>
I have no short-term memory. I know<br>who I am, I know all about myself.
<SYNC Start=506741 End=510615><P Class=ENCC>
I just... Since my injury,<br>I can't make new memories.
<SYNC Start=510824 End=514698><P Class=ENCC>
Everything fades. If we talk for<br>too long, I forget how we started.
<SYNC Start=514908 End=517198><P Class=ENCC>
The next time I see you, I'm not<br>gonna remember this conversation.
<SYNC Start=517533 End=519907><P Class=ENCC>
I don't even know<br>if I've met you before.
<SYNC Start=519907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=520908 End=523698><P Class=ENCC>
So, if I seem a little strange,<br>or rude or something...
<SYNC Start=523698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=527074 End=530948><P Class=ENCC>
-I've told you this before, haven't I?<br>-I don't mean to mess with you...
<SYNC Start=531199 End=533907><P Class=ENCC>
but it's so weird.<br>You don't remember me at all?
<SYNC Start=533907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=535033 End=537573><P Class=ENCC>
-We've talked a bunch of times.<br>-I'm sure we have.
<SYNC Start=537573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=539033 End=542490><P Class=ENCC>
-What's the last thing you remember?<br>-My wife.
<SYNC Start=542490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=543699 End=545740><P Class=ENCC>
What's it like?
<SYNC Start=545740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=550033 End=554323><P Class=ENCC>
It's like waking.<br>It's like you just woke up.
<SYNC Start=554323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=555033 End=558698><P Class=ENCC>
That must suck.<br>That's all backwards, I mean.
<SYNC Start=558698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=560408 End=564740><P Class=ENCC>
You know what you want to do, but<br>you don't remember what you just did.
<SYNC Start=564949 End=566615><P Class=ENCC>
I'm exactly the opposite...
<SYNC Start=566908 End=569698><P Class=ENCC>
-How long have I been staying here?<br>-Couple of days.
<SYNC Start=569908 End=572240><P Class=ENCC>
-And you're holding my calls?<br>-Like you said.
<SYNC Start=572449 End=574865><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, but this guy<br>is an exception.
<SYNC Start=574865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=575491 End=578782><P Class=ENCC>
-You know this guy?<br>-Yeah, it's a friend, right?
<SYNC Start=579116 End=581032><P Class=ENCC>
What makes you think<br>he's my friend?
<SYNC Start=581491 End=584032><P Class=ENCC>
-I saw you together, that's all.<br>-He's not my friend.
<SYNC Start=584032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=585449 End=588740><P Class=ENCC>
If he calls or if he shows up here,<br>you give me a call in my room, okay?
<SYNC Start=588949 End=590948><P Class=ENCC>
-His name is Teddy?<br>-Teddy, yeah.
<SYNC Start=591158 End=593032><P Class=ENCC>
Alright.
<SYNC Start=593032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=593574 End=596448><P Class=ENCC>
Look, I hope my condition<br>is not gonna be a problem for you.
<SYNC Start=596658 End=599073><P Class=ENCC>
No, not as long as you<br>remember to pay the bill.
<SYNC Start=599073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=599866 End=601407><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, okay.
<SYNC Start=601407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=601908 End=604282><P Class=ENCC>
-4O.<br>-4O.
<SYNC Start=604282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=605408 End=609532><P Class=ENCC>
This guy... he's here alright.
<SYNC Start=609532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=611824 End=612407><P Class=ENCC>
Lenny!
<SYNC Start=612407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=614741 End=617615><P Class=ENCC>
You really need a system<br>if you're gonna make it work.
<SYNC Start=617824 End=620490><P Class=ENCC>
You kinda learn to<br>trust your handwriting.
<SYNC Start=620699 End=624865><P Class=ENCC>
That becomes an important part of<br>your life. You write yourself notes...
<SYNC Start=625033 End=627198><P Class=ENCC>
and where you put these notes,<br>that also becomes really important.
<SYNC Start=627198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=627908 End=631907><P Class=ENCC>
You need a jacket with 6 pockets.<br>Pockets for particular things.
<SYNC Start=632158 End=636073><P Class=ENCC>
You just kinda learn to know where<br>things go and how the system works.
<SYNC Start=636324 End=638823><P Class=ENCC>
You have to be weary of other<br>people writing stuff for you.
<SYNC Start=639033 End=641532><P Class=ENCC>
That's not gonna make sense<br>or is gonna lead you astray.
<SYNC Start=641699 End=645365><P Class=ENCC>
People may want to take advantage<br>of somebody in this condition.
<SYNC Start=645365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=646783 End=651657><P Class=ENCC>
If you have a piece<br>of information which is vital...
<SYNC Start=651866 End=655157><P Class=ENCC>
writing on your body instead of on<br>a piece of paper can be the answer.
<SYNC Start=655366 End=657740><P Class=ENCC>
It's just a permanent way<br>of keeping a note.
<SYNC Start=657740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=665074 End=665657><P Class=ENCC>
Who is this?
<SYNC Start=665657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=674074 End=676198><P Class=ENCC>
"Remember Sammy Jankis."
<SYNC Start=676198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=706199 End=708240><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me, sir.<br>You left these at your table.
<SYNC Start=708449 End=711907><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks.<br>Uh... Lincoln Street?
<SYNC Start=712116 End=714823><P Class=ENCC>
Just go straight out on 6th Street,<br>go East away from town...
<SYNC Start=715033 End=717407><P Class=ENCC>
-Wait, I'll write this down.<br>-It's easy, just go straight down...
<SYNC Start=717574 End=719448><P Class=ENCC>
Trust me.<br>I need to write this down.
<SYNC Start=719448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

John Edward Gammell.
<SYNC Start=779032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=781199 End=783407><P Class=ENCC>
This guy told me<br>his name was Teddy.
<SYNC Start=783407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=787824 End=789573><P Class=ENCC>
"Don't believe his lies."
<SYNC Start=789573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=805908 End=808782><P Class=ENCC>
-Mr. Gammell?<br>-Lenny, is that you?
<SYNC Start=808991 End=811407><P Class=ENCC>
Lenny, it's Teddy.<br>Stay there, I'll be right over.
<SYNC Start=811616 End=813698><P Class=ENCC>
Okay. I'll be waiting.

<SYNC Start=897448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

It's him.
<SYNC Start=903490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=909741 End=912407><P Class=ENCC>
I found you, you fuck.
<SYNC Start=912407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=974074 End=977865><P Class=ENCC>
You say we talked before? I don't<br>remember that. It's not amnesia.
<SYNC Start=978033 End=980657><P Class=ENCC>
I remember everything up until my<br>injury. I can't make new memories.
<SYNC Start=980991 End=982990><P Class=ENCC>
So I can't remember talking to you.<br>What did we talk about?
<SYNC Start=982990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=983741 End=987698><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, Sammy Jankis. I talk about<br>him to help them understand.
<SYNC Start=987908 End=990407><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy's story helps me<br>understand my own situation.
<SYNC Start=990824 End=993615><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy wrote himself<br>endless amounts of notes.
<SYNC Start=993615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=994908 End=998157><P Class=ENCC>
But he got mixed up.<br>I have a more graceful solution...
<SYNC Start=998366 End=1000407><P Class=ENCC>
to the memory problem.
<SYNC Start=1000407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1002616 End=1004782><P Class=ENCC>
I'm disciplined and organized.
<SYNC Start=1005241 End=1008240><P Class=ENCC>
I use habit and routine<br>to make my life possible.
<SYNC Start=1008240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1008824 End=1011365><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy had no drive,<br>no reason to make it work.
<SYNC Start=1011365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1012949 End=1015573><P Class=ENCC>
Me? Yeah.
<SYNC Start=1015783 End=1017615><P Class=ENCC>
I got a reason.
<SYNC Start=1017615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1035158 End=1037907><P Class=ENCC>
"Today, 1p.m.,<br>meet Natalie for info.
<SYNC Start=1037907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1039074 End=1042782><P Class=ENCC>
She has also lost someone.<br>She will help you out of pity."
<SYNC Start=1042782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1060491 End=1062698><P Class=ENCC>
-Natalie?<br>-You don't remember me.
<SYNC Start=1063158 End=1066782><P Class=ENCC>
-I'm sorry, I should have explained.<br>-You did explain, Lenny.
<SYNC Start=1066991 End=1069490><P Class=ENCC>
Please, call me Leonard.<br>My wife called me Lenny.
<SYNC Start=1069699 End=1073157><P Class=ENCC>
-Yeah, I know, you told me.<br>-So I told you how much I hated it.
<SYNC Start=1073157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1075699 End=1078157><P Class=ENCC>
You mind taking your glasses off?<br>It's hard for me to...
<SYNC Start=1078157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1080074 End=1081615><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks.
<SYNC Start=1081824 End=1084573><P Class=ENCC>
-So, you have information for me?<br>-Is that what your little note says?
<SYNC Start=1084573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1086074 End=1089115><P Class=ENCC>
Must be tough living a life according<br>to a couple of scraps of paper.
<SYNC Start=1089324 End=1093115><P Class=ENCC>
Mix your laundry and your grocery<br>list, and you eat your underwear.
<SYNC Start=1093115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

I guess that's why you<br>have those freaky tatoos.
<SYNC Start=1096948><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1097866 End=1100865><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, it's tough.<br>It's almost impossible.
<SYNC Start=1100865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1101699 End=1104240><P Class=ENCC>
Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you.<br>It's nothing personal.
<SYNC Start=1104240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1107199 End=1109698><P Class=ENCC>
I do have information for you.
<SYNC Start=1109698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1110199 End=1112490><P Class=ENCC>
You gave me<br>a license plate number.
<SYNC Start=1112490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1113199 End=1115698><P Class=ENCC>
Had my friend<br>at DNV trace it.
<SYNC Start=1115698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1116283 End=1117990><P Class=ENCC>
Guess what<br>name came up?
<SYNC Start=1117990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1119491 End=1122573><P Class=ENCC>
John Edward Gammell.<br>John G.
<SYNC Start=1122949 End=1125198><P Class=ENCC>
-Do you know him?<br>-No...
<SYNC Start=1125408 End=1128407><P Class=ENCC>
but his face on his driver's<br>license looked really familiar.
<SYNC Start=1128616 End=1131532><P Class=ENCC>
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.<br>Here's a copy of his license...
<SYNC Start=1131741 End=1136032><P Class=ENCC>
his registration photo and all.<br>Are you sure you want this?
<SYNC Start=1136408 End=1138990><P Class=ENCC>
-Have I told you what this man did?<br>-Yeah.
<SYNC Start=1139199 End=1141865><P Class=ENCC>
-Well, you shouldn't have to ask.<br>-But, even if you get revenge...
<SYNC Start=1142033 End=1145698><P Class=ENCC>
you're not gonna remember it.<br>You'll not even know it happened.
<SYNC Start=1145908 End=1149157><P Class=ENCC>
My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't<br>make any difference if I know it.
<SYNC Start=1149533 End=1153407><P Class=ENCC>
Just because I don't remember,<br>doesn't make my actions meaningless.
<SYNC Start=1153616 End=1156657><P Class=ENCC>
The world doesn't just disappear<br>when you close your eyes, does it?
<SYNC Start=1156657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1157658 End=1161282><P Class=ENCC>
Anyway, maybe I'll take<br>a photograph to remind myself.
<SYNC Start=1161533 End=1163615><P Class=ENCC>
Get another freaky tatoo.
<SYNC Start=1163615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1167991 End=1170365><P Class=ENCC>
Tell me about her again.
<SYNC Start=1170365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1171491 End=1174657><P Class=ENCC>
-Why?<br>-Because you like to remember her.
<SYNC Start=1174657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1177199 End=1178990><P Class=ENCC>
She was beautiful.
<SYNC Start=1178990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1180908 End=1186032><P Class=ENCC>
-To me, she was perfect.<br>-Don't just recite the words.
<SYNC Start=1186032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1187033 End=1190990><P Class=ENCC>
Close your eyes<br>and remember her.
<SYNC Start=1190990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1201908 End=1204365><P Class=ENCC>
You can just<br>feel the details.
<SYNC Start=1204365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1206366 End=1209198><P Class=ENCC>
The bits and pieces you never<br>bothered to put into words.
<SYNC Start=1209198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1213824 End=1216532><P Class=ENCC>
And you can feel these<br>extreme moments...
<SYNC Start=1216532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1217199 End=1219448><P Class=ENCC>
even if you don't want to.
<SYNC Start=1219448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1221616 End=1224323><P Class=ENCC>
You put these together,<br>and you get the feel of a person.
<SYNC Start=1224323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1227699 End=1230198><P Class=ENCC>
Enough to know<br>how much you miss them.
<SYNC Start=1230198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1235616 End=1238573><P Class=ENCC>
And how much we hate the person<br>who took them away.
<SYNC Start=1238573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1248199 End=1251282><P Class=ENCC>
I... I added an<br>address in here.
<SYNC Start=1251491 End=1254907><P Class=ENCC>
It might be useful. It's an<br>abandoned place outside of town.
<SYNC Start=1255366 End=1258907><P Class=ENCC>
A guy I knew used to<br>do bigger deals there.
<SYNC Start=1258907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1260699 End=1264157><P Class=ENCC>
-It's isolated.<br>-Sounds perfect.
<SYNC Start=1264157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1266658 End=1270073><P Class=ENCC>
-Do I owe you any...?<br>-No, I wasn't helping you for money.
<SYNC Start=1270366 End=1274532><P Class=ENCC>
-I'm sorry.<br>-It's okay. You have this condition.
<SYNC Start=1274532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1276616 End=1280532><P Class=ENCC>
Still staying at the Discount Inn?<br>Room 3O4? You left it at my place.
<SYNC Start=1280532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1289408 End=1292198><P Class=ENCC>
-They're treating you okay?<br>-I don't remember.
<SYNC Start=1292198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1295533 End=1298073><P Class=ENCC>
You know what<br>we have in common?
<SYNC Start=1298073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1298616 End=1301448><P Class=ENCC>
We are both survivors.
<SYNC Start=1301448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1304366 End=1306407><P Class=ENCC>
You take care, Leonard.

"Remember Sammy Jankis."
<SYNC Start=1336490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1338491 End=1341490><P Class=ENCC>
I met Sammy through work.<br>Insurance. I was an investigator.
<SYNC Start=1341699 End=1344282><P Class=ENCC>
I investigated the claims to<br>see which ones were phony.
<SYNC Start=1344491 End=1349115><P Class=ENCC>
I saw through people's bullshit.<br>It's useful experience, now it's my life.
<SYNC Start=1349533 End=1352323><P Class=ENCC>
When I meet someone,<br>I don't know if I've met them before.
<SYNC Start=1352323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1352991 End=1355365><P Class=ENCC>
I have to just look in their eyes<br>and try and figure them out.
<SYNC Start=1355741 End=1358740><P Class=ENCC>
My job taught me the best way to find<br>out what someone knew is let'em talk.
<SYNC Start=1358949 End=1362948><P Class=ENCC>
Watch the eyes and body language.<br>If they scratch their nose...
<SYNC Start=1363408 End=1366448><P Class=ENCC>
experts will tell you they're lying,<br>but it means they're nervous.
<SYNC Start=1366658 End=1369740><P Class=ENCC>
People get nervous for all sorts<br>of reasons. It's all about context.
<SYNC Start=1369991 End=1374615><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I was good.<br>Sammy was my first real challenge.
<SYNC Start=1374615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1380741 End=1382073><P Class=ENCC>
Yo, Lenny!
<SYNC Start=1382073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1382658 End=1385532><P Class=ENCC>
-I thought you split for good.<br>-Well, things change.
<SYNC Start=1385699 End=1388282><P Class=ENCC>
So I see.<br>My name's Teddy.
<SYNC Start=1388491 End=1392073><P Class=ENCC>
-I've told you about my condition?<br>-Only every time I see ya.
<SYNC Start=1392073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1392658 End=1394448><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
<SYNC Start=1394448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1400033 End=1402323><P Class=ENCC>
-Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?<br>-Yeah.
<SYNC Start=1402616 End=1406782><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.<br>And John G.? You think he's here?
<SYNC Start=1406991 End=1409365><P Class=ENCC>
-Who?<br>-John G., the guy you're looking for.
<SYNC Start=1409533 End=1411907><P Class=ENCC>
-That's why you haven't left town.<br>-Maybe.
<SYNC Start=1412158 End=1415115><P Class=ENCC>
-Leonard, you have to be very careful.<br>-Why?
<SYNC Start=1415324 End=1420573><P Class=ENCC>
You mentioned somebody was trying<br>to get you to kill the wrong guy.
<SYNC Start=1420783 End=1423407><P Class=ENCC>
Well, I go on facts, not<br>recommendations. But thank you.
<SYNC Start=1423783 End=1426865><P Class=ENCC>
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life<br>to your little notes and pictures.
<SYNC Start=1427033 End=1429740><P Class=ENCC>
-Why not?<br>-Because they can be unreliable.
<SYNC Start=1429949 End=1431657><P Class=ENCC>
-Memory is unreliable.<br>-Oh, please.
<SYNC Start=1431866 End=1435198><P Class=ENCC>
Really. Memory is not perfect.<br>It's not even that good. Ask the police.
<SYNC Start=1435408 End=1437407><P Class=ENCC>
Eyewitness testimony<br>is unreliable.
<SYNC Start=1437574 End=1441448><P Class=ENCC>
Cops don't catch a killer remembering<br>stuff. They collect facts...
<SYNC Start=1441658 End=1445490><P Class=ENCC>
they make notes, and they draw<br>conclusions. Facts, not memories.
<SYNC Start=1445699 End=1448157><P Class=ENCC>
That's how you investigate.<br>I know, it's what I used to do.
<SYNC Start=1448491 End=1452240><P Class=ENCC>
Memory can change the shape<br>of a room, the color of a car.
<SYNC Start=1452449 End=1455573><P Class=ENCC>
Memories can be distorted.<br>They're just an interpretation...
<SYNC Start=1455783 End=1459032><P Class=ENCC>
they're not a record. And they're<br>irrelevant if you have the facts.
<SYNC Start=1459032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1459824 End=1462990><P Class=ENCC>
-You really want to get this guy.<br>-He killed my wife...
<SYNC Start=1463199 End=1464907><P Class=ENCC>
he took away<br>my fucking memory.
<SYNC Start=1464907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1467699 End=1470240><P Class=ENCC>
He destroyed<br>my ability to live.
<SYNC Start=1470240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1473658 End=1475657><P Class=ENCC>
You're living.
<SYNC Start=1475657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1476324 End=1479740><P Class=ENCC>
-Only for revenge.<br>-Then, we'll get the bastard.
<SYNC Start=1479991 End=1481532><P Class=ENCC>
Where are you staying?
<SYNC Start=1481532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1484033 End=1485573><P Class=ENCC>
At Discount Inn.
<SYNC Start=1485573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1487449 End=1489032><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know what room.<br>I haven't got my key.
<SYNC Start=1489199 End=1490823><P Class=ENCC>
Probably left it<br>in your room.
<SYNC Start=1490823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1506033 End=1508823><P Class=ENCC>
Hi. I'm checked in here,<br>but I think I've misplaced my key.
<SYNC Start=1508823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1509408 End=1513157><P Class=ENCC>
How are you doing, Leonard?<br>Probably in the room, right?
<SYNC Start=1513157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1531908 End=1534365><P Class=ENCC>
-I don't see my key anywhere.<br>-No shit. It's the wrong room.
<SYNC Start=1534533 End=1537615><P Class=ENCC>
-You're in 3O4 now. Sorry, I fucked up.<br>-This is not my room?
<SYNC Start=1537824 End=1541157><P Class=ENCC>
-No. Come on, let's go.<br>-Then why is this my handwriting?
<SYNC Start=1541157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1546449 End=1549157><P Class=ENCC>
This was your room,<br>but now you're in 3O4.
<SYNC Start=1549574 End=1551615><P Class=ENCC>
-When was I here?<br>-Last week.
<SYNC Start=1551824 End=1554698><P Class=ENCC>
-But then I rented you another room.<br>-Why?
<SYNC Start=1554908 End=1558907><P Class=ENCC>
Business is slow, I mean, I told<br>my boss about your condition...
<SYNC Start=1559116 End=1561282><P Class=ENCC>
and he said, "try and<br>rent him another room."
<SYNC Start=1561491 End=1563615><P Class=ENCC>
So how many rooms am I<br>checked into in this shithole?
<SYNC Start=1563824 End=1566240><P Class=ENCC>
Just two.<br>So far.
<SYNC Start=1566449 End=1570032><P Class=ENCC>
At least you're being honest<br>about ripping me off.
<SYNC Start=1570449 End=1574115><P Class=ENCC>
-You're not gonna remember anyway.<br>-You don't have to be that honest.
<SYNC Start=1574115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1574699 End=1578240><P Class=ENCC>
Leonard... always<br>get a receipt.
<SYNC Start=1578449 End=1580657><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, yeah.<br>I'll write that down.
<SYNC Start=1580657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1583158 End=1585240><P Class=ENCC>
-Hey, what time is it?<br>-A quarter to one.
<SYNC Start=1585240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1588824 End=1589948><P Class=ENCC>
Your room's...
<SYNC Start=1589948><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1602699 End=1603907><P Class=ENCC>
-Natalie?<br>-You don't remember me.
<SYNC Start=1603907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1605908 End=1608032><P Class=ENCC>
I'd just become an investigator<br>when I came across Sammy.
<SYNC Start=1608199 End=1611615><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Samuel R. Jankis,<br>strangest case ever.
<SYNC Start=1611824 End=1614573><P Class=ENCC>
Now the guy's a 58-year old,<br>semi-retired accountant.
<SYNC Start=1614783 End=1617448><P Class=ENCC>
He and his wife had been in this<br>car accident. Nothing too serious.
<SYNC Start=1617658 End=1620698><P Class=ENCC>
But he's acting funny. He can't<br>get a handle on what's going on.
<SYNC Start=1620698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1621908 End=1625865><P Class=ENCC>
The doctors find possible damage<br>to the hippocampus. Not conclusive.
<SYNC Start=1625865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1626616 End=1629407><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy can't remember anything<br>for more than a couple of minutes.
<SYNC Start=1629616 End=1633782><P Class=ENCC>
Can't work. The bills pile up,<br>his wife calls the insurance company.
<SYNC Start=1633991 End=1635573><P Class=ENCC>
And I get sent in.
<SYNC Start=1635783 End=1640198><P Class=ENCC>
It's my first big claims investigation,<br>so I really check into it.
<SYNC Start=1640198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1641241 End=1645198><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy can think just fine,<br>but he can't make any new memories.
<SYNC Start=1645408 End=1648698><P Class=ENCC>
-He remembers for a couple minutes.<br>-This is Mr. Shelby.
<SYNC Start=1648908 End=1653490><P Class=ENCC>
He'd watch TV, but anything longer<br>than a couple minutes was confusing.
<SYNC Start=1653490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1654033 End=1655907><P Class=ENCC>
He liked commercials.<br>They were short.
<SYNC Start=1656116 End=1659990><P Class=ENCC>
-Sammy, it's time for my shot.<br>-The crazy part was...
<SYNC Start=1660199 End=1663948><P Class=ENCC>
that this guy, who couldn't follow<br>the plot of Green Acres anymore...
<SYNC Start=1664199 End=1666365><P Class=ENCC>
could do the most<br>complicated things...
<SYNC Start=1666365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1667699 End=1669907><P Class=ENCC>
as long as he'd learned them<br>before the accident...
<SYNC Start=1669907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1671658 End=1674698><P Class=ENCC>
...and kept his mind on it.<br>-Gentle.
<SYNC Start=1674698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1675533 End=1678365><P Class=ENCC>
The doctors assured me that<br>there's a real condition called...
<SYNC Start=1678533 End=1683990><P Class=ENCC>
"antero-grade memory loss",or "short-<br>term memory loss". It's rare, but legit.
<SYNC Start=1683990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1685533 End=1687490><P Class=ENCC>
Every time I see him...
<SYNC Start=1687490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1688574 End=1691615><P Class=ENCC>
I catch this look... this...
<SYNC Start=1691824 End=1694157><P Class=ENCC>
slight look of recognition.
<SYNC Start=1694157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1694658 End=1696740><P Class=ENCC>
But he says he can't<br>remember me at all.
<SYNC Start=1696991 End=1699323><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy, it's okay,<br>I got it.
<SYNC Start=1699323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1699949 End=1702323><P Class=ENCC>
-Hi, Mr. Shelby.<br>-Nice to see you, Mrs. Jankis.
<SYNC Start=1702533 End=1706282><P Class=ENCC>
Now, I can read people,<br>and I'm thinking:"Bad actor."
<SYNC Start=1706282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1706824 End=1708865><P Class=ENCC>
So now I'm suspicious,<br>and I order more tests.
<SYNC Start=1708865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1712991 End=1714865><P Class=ENCC>
Awake.
<SYNC Start=1714865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1716033 End=1718073><P Class=ENCC>
Where am I?
<SYNC Start=1718073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1721908 End=1723740><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody's bedroom.
<SYNC Start=1723740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1725408 End=1727573><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, must be her room.
<SYNC Start=1727573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1728699 End=1731032><P Class=ENCC>
But who's she?
<SYNC Start=1731032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1738866 End=1740490><P Class=ENCC>
It's only me.
<SYNC Start=1740490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1742824 End=1745948><P Class=ENCC>
-Did you sleep okay?<br>-Yeah. You?
<SYNC Start=1745948><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1747658 End=1750990><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, shit. Shit.<br>I gotta be someplace.
<SYNC Start=1750990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1755866 End=1759198><P Class=ENCC>
-It's pretty weird.<br>-It's useful.
<SYNC Start=1759198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1760033 End=1762282><P Class=ENCC>
You never write a phone<br>number on your hand?
<SYNC Start=1762491 End=1767240><P Class=ENCC>
I should be able to talk to my friend<br>today about the license plate.
<SYNC Start=1767533 End=1771198><P Class=ENCC>
-Yeah, the license plate.<br>-John G.'s license plate.
<SYNC Start=1771198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1774949 End=1777407><P Class=ENCC>
You have it tattooed<br>on your thigh.
<SYNC Start=1777407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1794658 End=1796198><P Class=ENCC>
"Natalie."
<SYNC Start=1796198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1798824 End=1802907><P Class=ENCC>
"She has also lost someone.<br>She will help you out of pity."
<SYNC Start=1802907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1808491 End=1810907><P Class=ENCC>
If it's registered in the State,<br>she'll only be a couple seconds to...
<SYNC Start=1811074 End=1814907><P Class=ENCC>
pull up his license and registration.<br>I'll call you as soon as I meet him.
<SYNC Start=1815116 End=1819073><P Class=ENCC>
Could we just arrange a meeting now?<br>I'm not too good on the phone.
<SYNC Start=1819073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1827533 End=1829490><P Class=ENCC>
You know,<br>it's great that you...
<SYNC Start=1829490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1831033 End=1835198><P Class=ENCC>
well, that you're<br>helping me like this.
<SYNC Start=1835491 End=1839198><P Class=ENCC>
I'm helping you<br>because you helped me.
<SYNC Start=1839198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1850741 End=1854782><P Class=ENCC>
So, next time you see me...<br>will you remember me?
<SYNC Start=1854782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1871741 End=1874365><P Class=ENCC>
I think you will.
<SYNC Start=1874365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1875408 End=1877282><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=1877282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1880241 End=1883198><P Class=ENCC>
Lenny, before you go,<br>could I have my shirt back, please?
<SYNC Start=1883198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1898949 End=1901407><P Class=ENCC>
Yo, Lenny! I thought<br>you split for good.
<SYNC Start=1901407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1903491 End=1905032><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy couldn't pick up<br>any new skills at all.
<SYNC Start=1905032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1905658 End=1909157><P Class=ENCC>
But I find something<br>in my research. Conditioning.
<SYNC Start=1909408 End=1912365><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy should still be able<br>to learn through repetition.
<SYNC Start=1912533 End=1915782><P Class=ENCC>
It's how you learn to ride a bike.<br>You get better through practice.
<SYNC Start=1916033 End=1918407><P Class=ENCC>
It's a completely different part of<br>the brain from the short-term memory.
<SYNC Start=1918574 End=1921407><P Class=ENCC>
So I had the doctors test<br>Sammy's response to conditioning.
<SYNC Start=1921616 End=1925740><P Class=ENCC>
-Just pick up any three objects.<br>-That's a test?
<SYNC Start=1925740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1926449 End=1928823><P Class=ENCC>
Where were you guys<br>when I did my CPA?
<SYNC Start=1928823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1929783 End=1930990><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry.
<SYNC Start=1930990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1936199 End=1937990><P Class=ENCC>
-What the fuck?!<br>-It's a test, Sammy.
<SYNC Start=1938199 End=1940115><P Class=ENCC>
Test this,<br>you fucking quack.
<SYNC Start=1940115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1941533 End=1944698><P Class=ENCC>
Some of the objects were electrified.<br>They'd give him a small shock.
<SYNC Start=1944949 End=1947907><P Class=ENCC>
They kept repeating the test always<br>with the same objects electrified.
<SYNC Start=1948116 End=1951532><P Class=ENCC>
It was to see if Sammy could learn<br>to avoid the electrified objects...
<SYNC Start=1951783 End=1953407><P Class=ENCC>
not by memory,<br>but by instinct.
<SYNC Start=1953407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1974949 End=1977532><P Class=ENCC>
Natalie, right?<br>Who the fuck is Dodd?
<SYNC Start=1977532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1981283 End=1983907><P Class=ENCC>
-I won't worry about him anymore.<br>-What the fuck have you got me into?
<SYNC Start=1984116 End=1985615><P Class=ENCC>
Come inside.
<SYNC Start=1985615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1988908 End=1991865><P Class=ENCC>
-Who is he?<br>-Calm down, okay?
<SYNC Start=1992074 End=1995532><P Class=ENCC>
This is my problem, you offered<br>to help. It's not your investigation.
<SYNC Start=1995783 End=1997907><P Class=ENCC>
-How did you get me into this?<br>-You offered help when you saw...
<SYNC Start=1998116 End=2000573><P Class=ENCC>
...what he did to my face.<br>-How do I know he did that?
<SYNC Start=2000824 End=2005032><P Class=ENCC>
Because I came straight to you after<br>he did it. I asked you to help me.
<SYNC Start=2005283 End=2007573><P Class=ENCC>
-And I just take your word?<br>-Yeah.
<SYNC Start=2007573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2008824 End=2011823><P Class=ENCC>
Something doesn't feel right.<br>I think someone's fucking with me.
<SYNC Start=2012033 End=2013948><P Class=ENCC>
-Trying to make me kill a wrong guy.<br>-Did you?
<SYNC Start=2014199 End=2016032><P Class=ENCC>
-What?<br>-Kill him.
<SYNC Start=2016283 End=2020032><P Class=ENCC>
-Of course not!<br>-Hey, sit down, okay?
<SYNC Start=2020032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2021158 End=2024157><P Class=ENCC>
This has nothing<br>to do with you.
<SYNC Start=2024408 End=2028407><P Class=ENCC>
-You helped me out, and I'm grateful.<br>-You have to burn them.
<SYNC Start=2028407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2031866 End=2035865><P Class=ENCC>
Leonard, you decided to help me.<br>Trust yourself, your own judgement.
<SYNC Start=2036074 End=2039240><P Class=ENCC>
You can question everything.<br>You can never know anything for sure.
<SYNC Start=2039491 End=2041948><P Class=ENCC>
-There are things you know for sure.<br>-Such as?
<SYNC Start=2041948><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2044241 End=2046907><P Class=ENCC>
I know what that's gonna sound like<br>when I knock on it.
<SYNC Start=2047116 End=2051823><P Class=ENCC>
I know what that's gonna feel like<br>when I pick it up. See? Certainties.
<SYNC Start=2052033 End=2054240><P Class=ENCC>
It's the kind of memory<br>you take for granted.
<SYNC Start=2054699 End=2057615><P Class=ENCC>
You know, I can<br>remember so much.
<SYNC Start=2057615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2059408 End=2063157><P Class=ENCC>
The feel of the world...<br>and her.
<SYNC Start=2063157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2069408 End=2072907><P Class=ENCC>
She's gone.<br>And the present is trivia...
<SYNC Start=2073158 End=2076823><P Class=ENCC>
...which I scribble down these notes!<br>-Come on, try and relax.
<SYNC Start=2077199 End=2080115><P Class=ENCC>
-Come on.<br>-It's not easy for me to relax.
<SYNC Start=2080115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2081574 End=2083782><P Class=ENCC>
Come on,<br>take your jacket off.
<SYNC Start=2083782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2091033 End=2093032><P Class=ENCC>
Didn't think<br>you were the type.
<SYNC Start=2093032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2101033 End=2103032><P Class=ENCC>
It's backwards.
<SYNC Start=2103032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2104199 End=2106407><P Class=ENCC>
Come here.<br>Come here.
<SYNC Start=2106407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2128533 End=2130323><P Class=ENCC>
What about here?
<SYNC Start=2130323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2131866 End=2135782><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe it's for<br>when I find him.
<SYNC Start=2135782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2137199 End=2139948><P Class=ENCC>
I've lost somebody too.
<SYNC Start=2139948><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2141533 End=2145240><P Class=ENCC>
-I'm sorry.<br>-His name was Jimmy.
<SYNC Start=2145491 End=2148532><P Class=ENCC>
-What happened to him?<br>-He went to meet somebody.
<SYNC Start=2148741 End=2151032><P Class=ENCC>
He never came back.
<SYNC Start=2151032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2151533 End=2154490><P Class=ENCC>
-Who did he go to meet?<br>-A guy called Teddy.
<SYNC Start=2154490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2155866 End=2158448><P Class=ENCC>
-What did the police think?<br>-They don't look too hard...
<SYNC Start=2158699 End=2160990><P Class=ENCC>
for guys like Jimmy.
<SYNC Start=2160990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2162158 End=2164573><P Class=ENCC>
When you find<br>this guy, this...
<SYNC Start=2164949 End=2168365><P Class=ENCC>
John G., what<br>are you gonna do?
<SYNC Start=2168365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2170699 End=2172740><P Class=ENCC>
I'm gonna kill him.
<SYNC Start=2172740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2174366 End=2177282><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe I can help you<br>find him.
<SYNC Start=2177282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2181533 End=2184490><P Class=ENCC>
I don't even know<br>how long she's been gone.
<SYNC Start=2184490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2188283 End=2191407><P Class=ENCC>
It's like I've woken up<br>in bed and she's not here...
<SYNC Start=2191407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2193699 End=2196740><P Class=ENCC>
because she's gone to<br>the bathroom or something.
<SYNC Start=2196740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2201158 End=2203282><P Class=ENCC>
But somehow I just...
<SYNC Start=2203282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2204199 End=2207365><P Class=ENCC>
I just know she's never<br>gonna come back to bed.
<SYNC Start=2207365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2212699 End=2214740><P Class=ENCC>
If I could just...
<SYNC Start=2215033 End=2218990><P Class=ENCC>
reach over and touch<br>her side of the bed...
<SYNC Start=2218990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2219949 End=2222615><P Class=ENCC>
I would know<br>that it was cold.
<SYNC Start=2222615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2225116 End=2227532><P Class=ENCC>
But I can't.
<SYNC Start=2227532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2231533 End=2236698><P Class=ENCC>
I can't have her back. But I don't<br>want to wake up in the morning...
<SYNC Start=2236908 End=2239907><P Class=ENCC>
thinking she's still here.
<SYNC Start=2239907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2240408 End=2244990><P Class=ENCC>
I lie here not knowing<br>how long I've been alone.
<SYNC Start=2244990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2250991 End=2252698><P Class=ENCC>
So, how...
<SYNC Start=2252698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2253366 End=2256448><P Class=ENCC>
how can I heal?
<SYNC Start=2256448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2258033 End=2261657><P Class=ENCC>
How am I supposed to heal<br>if I can't...
<SYNC Start=2261908 End=2264532><P Class=ENCC>
feel time?
<SYNC Start=2264532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2336199 End=2340823><P Class=ENCC>
"She has also lost someone.<br>She will help you out of pity."
<SYNC Start=2340823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2366074 End=2368365><P Class=ENCC>
They kept testing<br>Sammy for months.
<SYNC Start=2368574 End=2371407><P Class=ENCC>
Always with the same objects<br>carrying the electrical charge.
<SYNC Start=2371407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2373033 End=2374698><P Class=ENCC>
-What the fuck?!<br>-It's a test, Sammy.
<SYNC Start=2374949 End=2376407><P Class=ENCC>
Test this,<br>you fucking quack!
<SYNC Start=2376699 End=2379532><P Class=ENCC>
Even with total short-term memory<br>loss, Sammy should have learned...
<SYNC Start=2379783 End=2383032><P Class=ENCC>
to instinctively stop picking up the<br>wrong object. All previous cases...
<SYNC Start=2383283 End=2385490><P Class=ENCC>
responded to conditioning.<br>Sammy didn't respond at all. It was...
<SYNC Start=2385490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2386116 End=2389782><P Class=ENCC>
enough to suggest that his condition<br>was psychological, not physical.
<SYNC Start=2390033 End=2393532><P Class=ENCC>
We turned down his claim saying he wasn't covered for mental illness.
<SYNC Start=2393532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2394283 End=2397407><P Class=ENCC>
His wife got stuck with the bills<br>and I got a big promotion.
<SYNC Start=2397407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2398991 End=2402490><P Class=ENCC>
Conditioning didn't work for<br>Sammy. So he became helpless.
<SYNC Start=2402699 End=2404823><P Class=ENCC>
But it works for me.
<SYNC Start=2405033 End=2409282><P Class=ENCC>
I live the way Sammy couldn't. Habit<br>and routine make my life possible.
<SYNC Start=2409533 End=2412490><P Class=ENCC>
Conditioning.<br>Acting on instinct.
<SYNC Start=2412490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2421158 End=2422865><P Class=ENCC>
Awake.
<SYNC Start=2422865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2424324 End=2425823><P Class=ENCC>
Where am I?
<SYNC Start=2425823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2427366 End=2429032><P Class=ENCC>
Motel room.
<SYNC Start=2429032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2435533 End=2438615><P Class=ENCC>
Some anonymous motel room.
<SYNC Start=2438615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2441658 End=2445157><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing in the drawers.<br>But I'll take a look anyway.
<SYNC Start=2445616 End=2448698><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing, except<br>the Gideon... Bible.
<SYNC Start=2448698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2463033 End=2464823><P Class=ENCC>
Lenny, open up.
<SYNC Start=2464823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2466866 End=2470032><P Class=ENCC>
-Just a minute.<br>-Will you open the door?
<SYNC Start=2470032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2472283 End=2473573><P Class=ENCC>
Lenny?
<SYNC Start=2473573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2476533 End=2478282><P Class=ENCC>
Open the door.
<SYNC Start=2478282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2481908 End=2483365><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=2483365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2485408 End=2486823><P Class=ENCC>
Hi, Teddy.
<SYNC Start=2487033 End=2489198><P Class=ENCC>
Finished playing<br>with yourself, Lenny?
<SYNC Start=2489198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2501408 End=2503198><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I get it.
<SYNC Start=2503198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2503908 End=2506573><P Class=ENCC>
-Amorous neighbors.<br>-What are you doing here?
<SYNC Start=2506573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2507158 End=2510323><P Class=ENCC>
You called me. You said<br>you needed my help.
<SYNC Start=2510533 End=2513407><P Class=ENCC>
You know, I've had more<br>rewarding friendships than this one.
<SYNC Start=2513407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2513991 End=2517073><P Class=ENCC>
Although I do get to keep<br>telling the same jokes.
<SYNC Start=2517073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2518158 End=2519990><P Class=ENCC>
What the fuck is that?
<SYNC Start=2519990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2525908 End=2527365><P Class=ENCC>
-Who the fuck is that?<br>-You don't know him?
<SYNC Start=2527533 End=2529157><P Class=ENCC>
No. Should I?
<SYNC Start=2529366 End=2532448><P Class=ENCC>
Wait a minute.<br>Is that John G.?
<SYNC Start=2532908 End=2535323><P Class=ENCC>
-I don't think so.<br>-You don't know? You wrote it down?
<SYNC Start=2535533 End=2538823><P Class=ENCC>
-Maybe I fell asleep before I did.<br>-For Christ's sake!
<SYNC Start=2538823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2540199 End=2542032><P Class=ENCC>
Ask him.
<SYNC Start=2542032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2545824 End=2548615><P Class=ENCC>
What's your name?<br>Your name?
<SYNC Start=2548615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2549199 End=2551032><P Class=ENCC>
-Dodd.<br>-And who did this to you?
<SYNC Start=2551199 End=2553448><P Class=ENCC>
-What?<br>-Who did this to you?
<SYNC Start=2553699 End=2555532><P Class=ENCC>
You did.
<SYNC Start=2555532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2558449 End=2561657><P Class=ENCC>
-I'm not gonna help you kill him.<br>-No. Just let me think for a minute.
<SYNC Start=2561657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2567533 End=2570448><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, Natalie. Who's Natalie?<br>Natalie who?
<SYNC Start=2570658 End=2572615><P Class=ENCC>
-Why?<br>-Maybe I know her.
<SYNC Start=2572824 End=2575032><P Class=ENCC>
Look, we got to<br>get him out of here.
<SYNC Start=2575032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2575533 End=2576990><P Class=ENCC>
Alright, alright.
<SYNC Start=2576990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2578449 End=2581698><P Class=ENCC>
He's got to have a car, right?<br>We take him down to his car...
<SYNC Start=2581908 End=2583823><P Class=ENCC>
we tell him to get the fuck out of town<br>or we're gonna kill him.
<SYNC Start=2584033 End=2585823><P Class=ENCC>
We can't just walk him out of here<br>tied up and bleeding.
<SYNC Start=2586033 End=2588407><P Class=ENCC>
-How did you get him up here?<br>-I don't know.
<SYNC Start=2588574 End=2590157><P Class=ENCC>
You don't know.
<SYNC Start=2590157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2592741 End=2596282><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, I do. This is not my room.<br>Must be his room. Great, let's go.

-No, we can't just leave him here.<br>-Why not?
<SYNC Start=2598783 End=2603073><P Class=ENCC>
Because the maid's gonna walk in,<br>see him, call the cops. He can ID us.
<SYNC Start=2603073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2605241 End=2609698><P Class=ENCC>
We untie him, we clean him up, and<br>we march him out of here with a gun.
<SYNC Start=2609908 End=2611823><P Class=ENCC>
A gun? Why would<br>I have a gun?
<SYNC Start=2611823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2613491 End=2617032><P Class=ENCC>
Must be his. I don't think they'd<br>let someone like me carry a gun.
<SYNC Start=2617032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2618491 End=2619698><P Class=ENCC>
I hope not.
<SYNC Start=2619698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2626991 End=2628657><P Class=ENCC>
Which one?
<SYNC Start=2628657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2631658 End=2633907><P Class=ENCC>
We should probably steal his car,<br>teach him a lesson.
<SYNC Start=2634116 End=2637073><P Class=ENCC>
-Shut up.<br>-You can say. You have the Jaggie.
<SYNC Start=2637283 End=2638698><P Class=ENCC>
Alright. Get in.
<SYNC Start=2638908 End=2641615><P Class=ENCC>
-I'll ride with him, you follow us.<br>-Give me the keys.
<SYNC Start=2641615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2642491 End=2644198><P Class=ENCC>
Take your own car.
<SYNC Start=2644198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2672824 End=2675740><P Class=ENCC>
-So was he scared?<br>-It was your sinister mustache.
<SYNC Start=2676074 End=2678490><P Class=ENCC>
Fuck you.<br>Should've stolen his car.
<SYNC Start=2678699 End=2681532><P Class=ENCC>
-What's wrong with this one?<br>-Nothing. You want to trade?
<SYNC Start=2681532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2685449 End=2689490><P Class=ENCC>
-So what do you do now?<br>-I'll find out what was that about.
<SYNC Start=2689490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2697074 End=2699740><P Class=ENCC>
Natalie, right?<br>Who the fuck is Dodd?
<SYNC Start=2699740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2702074 End=2705073><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy's wife was crippled<br>by the cost of supporting him...
<SYNC Start=2705073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2705616 End=2708115><P Class=ENCC>
and fighting the<br>company's decision.
<SYNC Start=2708115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2709283 End=2713365><P Class=ENCC>
It wasn't the money that got to her.<br>I never said that Sammy was faking.
<SYNC Start=2713533 End=2716240><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy, I have an idea.<br>I want you to do it for me.
<SYNC Start=2716449 End=2719740><P Class=ENCC>
Just that his problem<br>was mental,not physical.
<SYNC Start=2719740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2720283 End=2722573><P Class=ENCC>
Have a pen in<br>your pocket, okay?
<SYNC Start=2722783 End=2724532><P Class=ENCC>
But she couldn't understand.
<SYNC Start=2724532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2725366 End=2729032><P Class=ENCC>
-I did something wrong?<br>-You did! Now we'll figure it out.
<SYNC Start=2729199 End=2730740><P Class=ENCC>
We'll gonna try<br>a little harder.
<SYNC Start=2730949 End=2733740><P Class=ENCC>
She looks into his eyes and sees the<br>same person. If it's not physical...
<SYNC Start=2733949 End=2736032><P Class=ENCC>
he should just<br>snap out of it.
<SYNC Start=2736241 End=2738823><P Class=ENCC>
-Ellen called!<br>-Ellen called.
<SYNC Start=2739033 End=2742823><P Class=ENCC>
-Ellen can't come...<br>-I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.
<SYNC Start=2743033 End=2745657><P Class=ENCC>
-I'm trying, I'm sorry.<br>-Try harder!
<SYNC Start=2745657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2749241 End=2753490><P Class=ENCC>
Leonard Shelby from the insurance<br>company gives her the seed of doubts.
<SYNC Start=2753949 End=2756198><P Class=ENCC>
Just like he gave it<br>to the doctors.
<SYNC Start=2756198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2756741 End=2760032><P Class=ENCC>
But I never said that he<br>was faking. I never said that.
<SYNC Start=2760032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2766033 End=2768865><P Class=ENCC>
I don't feel drunk.

-Oh, shit.<br>-Housekeeping.
<SYNC Start=2843449 End=2845532><P Class=ENCC>

<SYNC Start=2879115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2884699 End=2886365><P Class=ENCC>
Dodd.
<SYNC Start=2886365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2891033 End=2895782><P Class=ENCC>
Get rid of him.<br>Ask Natalie.
<SYNC Start=2895782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2896699 End=2898032><P Class=ENCC>
Teddy.
<SYNC Start=2898032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

Yeah, leave your number.<br>You know what to do.
<SYNC Start=2911699 End=2914657><P Class=ENCC>
This is a message for Teddy.<br>I'm at the Mount crest Inn...
<SYNC Start=2914908 End=2917532><P Class=ENCC>
on 5th Street, room 6. I need you to<br>come over as soon as you get this.
<SYNC Start=2917783 End=2921032><P Class=ENCC>
It's important. Oh, this is Leonard.<br>Thanks. Bye.
<SYNC Start=2921032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2925699 End=2927365><P Class=ENCC>
Fuck!
<SYNC Start=2927365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2936533 End=2940032><P Class=ENCC>
Mrs. Jankis didn't understand you<br>can't bully someone into remembering.
<SYNC Start=2940449 End=2942823><P Class=ENCC>
The more pressure,<br>the harder it gets.
<SYNC Start=2942823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2945074 End=2947407><P Class=ENCC>
Call me back?
<SYNC Start=2947407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2969116 End=2970698><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, so what am I doing?
<SYNC Start=2970698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2973033 End=2974740><P Class=ENCC>
Well, I'm chasing this guy.
<SYNC Start=2974740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2977533 End=2979990><P Class=ENCC>
No. He's chasing me.
<SYNC Start=2979990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3002616 End=3004407><P Class=ENCC>
Fuck!
<SYNC Start=3004407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3007908 End=3011865><P Class=ENCC>
"Dodd, white guy... he's on<br>Mount crest Inn, on 5th Street."
<SYNC Start=3011865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3013116 End=3014948><P Class=ENCC>
I'll get the jump on you,<br>you fucker!

Oh, fuck.
<SYNC Start=3053782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3056408 End=3057740><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry.
<SYNC Start=3057740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3091366 End=3093157><P Class=ENCC>
I need a weapon.
<SYNC Start=3093157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3096658 End=3098240><P Class=ENCC>
This will do.
<SYNC Start=3098240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3120949 End=3122865><P Class=ENCC>
I don't feel drunk.
<SYNC Start=3122865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3165908 End=3168407><P Class=ENCC>
Do I know this guy?
<SYNC Start=3168407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3168908 End=3170365><P Class=ENCC>
He seems to know me.
<SYNC Start=3170365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3175116 End=3176157><P Class=ENCC>
What the fuck?
<SYNC Start=3176157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3190033 End=3192073><P Class=ENCC>
-I like your car.<br>-Thank you.
<SYNC Start=3192324 End=3194407><P Class=ENCC>
-Where did you get it?<br>-Are you interested in buying one?
<SYNC Start=3194407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3195074 End=3198365><P Class=ENCC>
-Have I made a strong impression?<br>-I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
<SYNC Start=3198365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3209949 End=3211823><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, so what am I doing?
<SYNC Start=3211823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3222199 End=3223865><P Class=ENCC>
Who is this?
<SYNC Start=3223865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3304116 End=3305490><P Class=ENCC>
Cut it out.
<SYNC Start=3305490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3336324 End=3339407><P Class=ENCC>
-How can you read that again?<br>-It's good.
<SYNC Start=3339407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3340616 End=3344032><P Class=ENCC>
-You read it like a thousand times.<br>-I enjoy it.
<SYNC Start=3344032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3345449 End=3347823><P Class=ENCC>
I thought the pleasure of a book was<br>wanting to know what happens next.
<SYNC Start=3348033 End=3352782><P Class=ENCC>
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it<br>to annoy you. I enjoy it.
<SYNC Start=3352782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3353366 End=3356282><P Class=ENCC>
Just let me read, please?
<SYNC Start=3356282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3367158 End=3369490><P Class=ENCC>
Probably tried this before.
<SYNC Start=3369490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3371533 End=3374157><P Class=ENCC>
Probably burned<br>truck loads of your stuff.
<SYNC Start=3374157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3376949 End=3379532><P Class=ENCC>
Can't remember to forget you.
<SYNC Start=3379532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3401908 End=3405448><P Class=ENCC>
Well, sir. That would certainly be<br>in keeping with my own discoveries.
<SYNC Start=3405783 End=3408407><P Class=ENCC>
I was hoping for a little more on<br>the drugs angle. Can you hang on?
<SYNC Start=3408407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3417741 End=3420907><P Class=ENCC>
The police report mentioned drugs<br>found in the car outside my house.
<SYNC Start=3421074 End=3423032><P Class=ENCC>
Car was stolen, but<br>the prints were all over it.
<SYNC Start=3423408 End=3428032><P Class=ENCC>
I got friends in the department.<br>They got me a copy of it.
<SYNC Start=3428199 End=3432407><P Class=ENCC>
In my condition it's really tough.<br>I can't keep it all in mind at once.
<SYNC Start=3432574 End=3437490><P Class=ENCC>
I have to summarize the sections.<br>And there's pages missing.
<SYNC Start=3437908 End=3442073><P Class=ENCC>
Why these are crossed out? But they<br>weren't even looking for John G.
<SYNC Start=3442283 End=3444698><P Class=ENCC>
What they found in the car fit in<br>with what they thought had happened.
<SYNC Start=3444908 End=3446615><P Class=ENCC>
So they didn't<br>chase any of it up.
<SYNC Start=3446615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3483449 End=3485407><P Class=ENCC>
Honey?
<SYNC Start=3485407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3486783 End=3488990><P Class=ENCC>
Honey, it's late.
<SYNC Start=3488990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3510824 End=3512740><P Class=ENCC>
Everything okay?
<SYNC Start=3512740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3530699 End=3532532><P Class=ENCC>
You're okay in there?
<SYNC Start=3532532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3535574 End=3537032><P Class=ENCC>
Was it good for you?
<SYNC Start=3537032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3539533 End=3542115><P Class=ENCC>
What? Was I supposed<br>to lock the door?
<SYNC Start=3542115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3546616 End=3548532><P Class=ENCC>
I'd like you to leave now.
<SYNC Start=3548532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3569449 End=3572490><P Class=ENCC>
Something about the drugs stashed<br>in the car doesn't ring true to me.
<SYNC Start=3572490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3572991 End=3574865><P Class=ENCC>
Because the police claimed<br>the guy was an addict...
<SYNC Start=3575074 End=3577032><P Class=ENCC>
needing money to score,<br>which I think is bullshit.
<SYNC Start=3577241 End=3580907><P Class=ENCC>
He's won't break into places while<br>he's still got a stash that big.
<SYNC Start=3580907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3581449 End=3584115><P Class=ENCC>
I think John G. left it there...<br>or planted it there.
<SYNC Start=3584115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3585908 End=3588032><P Class=ENCC>
How do you know that?
<SYNC Start=3588032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3589616 End=3593532><P Class=ENCC>
Shit, that's true. It fits.<br>So he's a dealer.
<SYNC Start=3593532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3594699 End=3596532><P Class=ENCC>
Hang on a second.
<SYNC Start=3596532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3606741 End=3607823><P Class=ENCC>
Now we're getting somewhere.
<SYNC Start=3607823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3609866 End=3610490><P Class=ENCC>
"Discount Inn."
<SYNC Start=3610490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3664241 End=3666990><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, okay. Blond is fine.
<SYNC Start=3666990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3669033 End=3670990><P Class=ENCC>
That's what they say.
<SYNC Start=3671199 End=3675365><P Class=ENCC>
At Discount Inn. 3O4.<br>Leonard.
<SYNC Start=3675365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3677241 End=3680490><P Class=ENCC>
-Well, what then?<br>-We just go to bed.
<SYNC Start=3680699 End=3683532><P Class=ENCC>
You wait for me to fall asleep, go<br>into the bathroom and slam the door.
<SYNC Start=3683741 End=3686157><P Class=ENCC>
-Slam it?<br>-Enough to wake me up.
<SYNC Start=3686366 End=3688157><P Class=ENCC>
-And that's it?<br>-That's it.
<SYNC Start=3688157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3691283 End=3693990><P Class=ENCC>
First, I need you to put<br>these things around the room.
<SYNC Start=3693990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3697283 End=3700573><P Class=ENCC>
Just pretend they're your things<br>and that this is your bedroom.
<SYNC Start=3700573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3711866 End=3713448><P Class=ENCC>
-Should I wear it?<br>-No, no.
<SYNC Start=3713824 End=3716823><P Class=ENCC>
You know, just like<br>you took it off or something.
<SYNC Start=3716823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3720491 End=3723240><P Class=ENCC>
I don't want you to use it.<br>I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=3723574 End=3725865><P Class=ENCC>
I just mean put around<br>the room, you know?
<SYNC Start=3726074 End=3729198><P Class=ENCC>
As if they were your...<br>your things.
<SYNC Start=3729198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3733033 End=3735115><P Class=ENCC>
Whatever gets you off.
<SYNC Start=3735115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3759949 End=3764157><P Class=ENCC>
I can't blame the cops for not<br>taking me seriously. It's difficult.
<SYNC Start=3764366 End=3767573><P Class=ENCC>
Look at Sammy Jankis. His<br>own wife couldn't deal with it.
<SYNC Start=3767866 End=3771532><P Class=ENCC>
I told you about how she tried hard.<br>She came to see me at the office.
<SYNC Start=3771741 End=3775782><P Class=ENCC>
I found out all kinds of shit.<br>She told me about life with Sammy.
<SYNC Start=3775991 End=3777990><P Class=ENCC>
-How she treated him.<br>-Thank you for seeing me.
<SYNC Start=3778199 End=3780657><P Class=ENCC>
She would get Sammy to hide food<br>all around the house and then...
<SYNC Start=3780866 End=3784657><P Class=ENCC>
she'd stop feeding just to make him<br>remember where he'd hidden the food.
<SYNC Start=3784657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3786949 End=3789573><P Class=ENCC>
She wasn't a cruel person. She just<br>wanted her old Sammy back.
<SYNC Start=3789783 End=3793240><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy<br>and you've decided that he's faking.
<SYNC Start=3793491 End=3796240><P Class=ENCC>
The company's position isn't<br>that Sammy is faking anything.
<SYNC Start=3796408 End=3799490><P Class=ENCC>
-It's just that it can't be shown...<br>-I just wanna know...
<SYNC Start=3799699 End=3802948><P Class=ENCC>
...your honest opinion about Sammy.<br>-We shouldn't even be talking...
<SYNC Start=3803158 End=3806240><P Class=ENCC>
...while it's still open to appeal.<br>-I'm not appealing the decision.
<SYNC Start=3806240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3807241 End=3812032><P Class=ENCC>
-Then why are you here?<br>-When I look at Sammy, I don't see...
<SYNC Start=3812032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3812783 End=3816448><P Class=ENCC>
some vegetable.<br>I see my same old Sammy.
<SYNC Start=3816448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3818449 End=3822823><P Class=ENCC>
What do you think it is for me to think<br>he might be imagining this problem?
<SYNC Start=3823033 End=3828115><P Class=ENCC>
And if I say the right thing, he would<br>snap out of it and be normal?
<SYNC Start=3828115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3829491 End=3831573><P Class=ENCC>
If I...
<SYNC Start=3831573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3833533 End=3837240><P Class=ENCC>
If I knew that my old Sammy<br>were truly gone, then...
<SYNC Start=3837449 End=3841865><P Class=ENCC>
I could say goodbye, and<br>start loving this new Sammy.
<SYNC Start=3841865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3843574 End=3846365><P Class=ENCC>
As long as I have doubt,<br>I can't say goodbye and move on.
<SYNC Start=3846574 End=3850407><P Class=ENCC>
-What do you want from me?<br>-Forget the company you work for...

I need to know...<br>what you honestly believe.
<SYNC Start=3860740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3865533 End=3869365><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy should be physically<br>capable of making new memories.

Thank you.

I thought I helped her. I thought she<br>just needed some kind of answer.
<SYNC Start=3884366 End=3888198><P Class=ENCC>
It wasn't important what the answer<br>was. Just that she had one to believe.

<SYNC Start=3909241 End=3912907><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy. Remember Sammy?<br>You told me about Sammy!

<SYNC Start=3917407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3917949 End=3920157><P Class=ENCC>
What, your sense of humor<br>went with the memory?
<SYNC Start=3920366 End=3923490><P Class=ENCC>

<SYNC Start=3923699 End=3925615><P Class=ENCC>
Lenny, let me inform you...

your business here<br>is very much finished.

<SYNC Start=3934948><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3936408 End=3940365><P Class=ENCC>
That's right. Take a look at your<br>pictures. I bet you got one of her.
<SYNC Start=3940365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

Oh, nice shot, "Leibowitz."

You wanna make a note:<br>"You can't trust her."
<SYNC Start=3948449 End=3951198><P Class=ENCC>
-Oh, yeah? Why is that?<br>-By now, she's taken a look...
<SYNC Start=3951366 End=3954365><P Class=ENCC>
at this suit, and the car, and<br>she's starting to figure out ways...
<SYNC Start=3954533 End=3958240><P Class=ENCC>
to turn in the situation<br>to her advantage.
<SYNC Start=3958408 End=3962282><P Class=ENCC>
She's already got you staying with<br>her. You can't go back in there.

She's involved with drugs.<br>Look. You see these?
<SYNC Start=3972282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

This is the bar where she works.<br>Her boyfriend is a drug dealer.

She takes orders for him,<br>arranges meets.
<SYNC Start=3980199 End=3983032><P Class=ENCC>
He writes messages<br>on the back of these.
<SYNC Start=3983241 End=3985740><P Class=ENCC>
Then she slips him the answers<br>when she serves him his drinks.
<SYNC Start=3985949 End=3989865><P Class=ENCC>
-Why should I care?<br>-When she gets jammed up...
<SYNC Start=3990199 End=3993365><P Class=ENCC>
...she'll use you to protect herself.<br>-From who?
<SYNC Start=3993533 End=3996282><P Class=ENCC>
Guys are gonna want to know<br>what happened to her boyfriend.

Guys are gonna come after her.<br>Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.

Somebody always pays.<br>Maybe she'll make it you.

Oh, yeah? Or maybe she'll<br>make it you. Is that it?

You're worried that she's<br>gonna use me against you?

-No.<br>-Why not?
<SYNC Start=4011491 End=4014032><P Class=ENCC>
Because she doesn't<br>know who I am.
<SYNC Start=4014032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4014949 End=4017573><P Class=ENCC>

She doesn't know anything about<br>your investigation, okay, "Einstein"?

So, write this down.
<SYNC Start=4024408 End=4029032><P Class=ENCC>
When she offers to help,<br>it'll be for her own reasons.
<SYNC Start=4029241 End=4033948><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not lying. Take my pen.<br>Write this down.
<SYNC Start=4034158 End=4036532><P Class=ENCC>
"Do not trust her."
<SYNC Start=4036532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4047491 End=4048990><P Class=ENCC>
Why not?
<SYNC Start=4049199 End=4053157><P Class=ENCC>
How long you can hang around before<br>people start asking questions?
<SYNC Start=4053366 End=4055990><P Class=ENCC>
-What sort of questions?<br>-The same you should be asking.
<SYNC Start=4056116 End=4058782><P Class=ENCC>
-Like what?<br>-How did you get the suit, the car?
<SYNC Start=4058991 End=4060407><P Class=ENCC>
-I have money.<br>-From what?
<SYNC Start=4060616 End=4063865><P Class=ENCC>
My wife's death. I used to work<br>in insurance. We were well covered.
<SYNC Start=4063865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4066033 End=4069990><P Class=ENCC>
So in your grief, you wandered<br>into a Jaguar dealership.
<SYNC Start=4069990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4071908 End=4075615><P Class=ENCC>
You don't have a clue, do you?<br>You don't even know who you are.
<SYNC Start=4075824 End=4078657><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, I do.<br>I don't have amnesia.
<SYNC Start=4078866 End=4082490><P Class=ENCC>
I remember right until the incident.<br>I'm Leonard Shelby from S. Francisco.
<SYNC Start=4082699 End=4087157><P Class=ENCC>
That's who you were.<br>You do not know who you are.
<SYNC Start=4087366 End=4091198><P Class=ENCC>
What you've become since...<br>the incident.
<SYNC Start=4091366 End=4093532><P Class=ENCC>
You wander around<br>playing detective.
<SYNC Start=4093741 End=4096532><P Class=ENCC>
You don't even know<br>how long ago it was.
<SYNC Start=4096532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4097658 End=4102115><P Class=ENCC>
Let me put it this way. You wore<br>designer suits selling insurance?
<SYNC Start=4102324 End=4106157><P Class=ENCC>
-I didn't sell, I investigated.<br>-Right, you're an investigator.
<SYNC Start=4106157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4106949 End=4109948><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe you should start<br>investigating yourself.
<SYNC Start=4110158 End=4111740><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you for the advice.
<SYNC Start=4111740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4113949 End=4116490><P Class=ENCC>
Look, do me a favor.<br>Don't go back in there.
<SYNC Start=4116490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4117241 End=4119990><P Class=ENCC>
Will you take the motel<br>out of town?
<SYNC Start=4119990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4122866 End=4125115><P Class=ENCC>
It's been fun, Lenny.
<SYNC Start=4125115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4131991 End=4134240><P Class=ENCC>
"Do not trust her."
<SYNC Start=4134240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4135533 End=4137615><P Class=ENCC>
"Don't believe his lies."
<SYNC Start=4137615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4150533 End=4153198><P Class=ENCC>
Fuck it!<br>I need my own place.
<SYNC Start=4153198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4160824 End=4163740><P Class=ENCC>
No, she shouldn't have<br>given me that responsibility.
<SYNC Start=4163908 End=4166573><P Class=ENCC>
I'm a claims investigator,<br>not a doctor.
<SYNC Start=4166573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4167908 End=4172323><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I guess. I got all sorts<br>of other considerations.
<SYNC Start=4172323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4173241 End=4176157><P Class=ENCC>
Legal responsibility,<br>large financial...
<SYNC Start=4176157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4180449 End=4182407><P Class=ENCC>
Who is this?
<SYNC Start=4182407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

Write down what happened. Write it<br>down. Concentrate. Keep it in mind.
<SYNC Start=4199073><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4209033 End=4211740><P Class=ENCC>

<SYNC Start=4212158 End=4214365><P Class=ENCC>
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!<br>Dodd beat the shit out of me.

-Why?<br>-Why? Because of you!
<SYNC Start=4216866 End=4220865><P Class=ENCC>
I did what you told me. "Tell him<br>about Teddy." Great fucking idea!
<SYNC Start=4221074 End=4224615><P Class=ENCC>
Calm down. Take it easy.<br>You're safe, it's okay.
<SYNC Start=4224615><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

Come on, just sit down.

Okay, you're okay.

Here.
<SYNC Start=4247240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4253241 End=4256365><P Class=ENCC>
I did exactly what<br>you told me to do.
<SYNC Start=4256741 End=4259032><P Class=ENCC>
I went to Dodd...
<SYNC Start=4259032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4259824 End=4263782><P Class=ENCC>
and I told him I didn't have<br>any of Jimmy's money...
<SYNC Start=4263782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4264324 End=4266740><P Class=ENCC>
or the drugs.
<SYNC Start=4267033 End=4270657><P Class=ENCC>
And that this Teddy<br>must've taken everything.
<SYNC Start=4270866 End=4273532><P Class=ENCC>
And what did he say?
<SYNC Start=4273741 End=4276282><P Class=ENCC>
He didn't believe me.
<SYNC Start=4276282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4278033 End=4280865><P Class=ENCC>
He said if I don't have the drugs<br>by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.
<SYNC Start=4281074 End=4284157><P Class=ENCC>
And then, he just<br>started hitting me.
<SYNC Start=4284157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4286699 End=4289532><P Class=ENCC>
-Where is he?<br>-Why?
<SYNC Start=4289532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

-I'll go see him.<br>-And?
<SYNC Start=4292366 End=4295448><P Class=ENCC>
I'll give him some bruises of his own<br>and tell him to look for Teddy.
<SYNC Start=4295448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4296408 End=4298990><P Class=ENCC>
He'll kill you, Lenny.
<SYNC Start=4298990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4300408 End=4303115><P Class=ENCC>
My wife used to<br>call me Lenny.

I hated it.

This guy is so dangerous, let's<br>just think of something else, okay?

No. Just tell me what he looks<br>like, and where I can find him.
<SYNC Start=4318533 End=4322032><P Class=ENCC>

<SYNC Start=4322032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

He'll probably find you.

<SYNC Start=4337407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

Why?
<SYNC Start=4340323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

He was beating the shit out of me,<br>I had to tell him something.
<SYNC Start=4344865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4345783 End=4348240><P Class=ENCC>
Just write it all down.
<SYNC Start=4348240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4362366 End=4364240><P Class=ENCC>
Be careful.
<SYNC Start=4364240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4422782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

No.

You don't have a fucking clue? You're<br>just blissfully ignorant, aren't you?

Probably more than you do. You don't<br>have a clue about anything else.
<SYNC Start=4442783 End=4446365><P Class=ENCC>
-What happened?<br>-Jimmy met a guy named Teddy.
<SYNC Start=4446574 End=4449823><P Class=ENCC>
He took a lot of money with him and<br>never came back. Jimmy's partners...
<SYNC Start=4450033 End=4452907><P Class=ENCC>
think I set him up. I don't know<br>if you know this Teddy, or how well.
<SYNC Start=4453116 End=4455698><P Class=ENCC>
-Neither do I.<br>-Don't protect him. Help me.

<SYNC Start=4461365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

What do you think I am?<br>I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

What then? Love?<br>What would you kill for?
<SYNC Start=4468574 End=4471073><P Class=ENCC>
-You'd kill for your wife?<br>-It's different.
<SYNC Start=4471324 End=4473407><P Class=ENCC>
Not to me. I wasn't<br>fucking married to her.
<SYNC Start=4473658 End=4477698><P Class=ENCC>
-Don't talk about my wife.<br>-I can talk about whoever I want!
<SYNC Start=4477908 End=4479615><P Class=ENCC>
I can say whatever I want,<br>and you won't remember.

I can call your wife a fucking whore,<br>and we'll still be friends.

You can't get scared, but hey.<br>Can you get angry?

and you won't have a fucking<br>clue, you fucking retard.

Did you lose your pen?<br>That's too bad, freak.

Venereal disease.<br>Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife...

sucked one too many diseased cocks<br>and turned you into a fucking retard!

He told me about you. Said you<br>were staying at the Discount.

In fact, a cop came by earlier,<br>was looking for you.

-What's happened to Jimmy?<br>-I don't know that either. Sorry.

You don't remember where you've<br>been or what you've just done?

No, I can't make new memories.<br>Everything just fades.

<SYNC Start=5113282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

Your pocket.

It's amazing what a little brain<br>damage does for your credibility.

I guess it's some kind of poetic<br>justice for not believing Sammy.
<SYNC Start=5199574 End=5203907><P Class=ENCC>

<SYNC Start=5203907><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

You feel angry and don't know why.<br>You feel guilty...

you have no idea why.<br>You could do anything...
<SYNC Start=5211741 End=5215490><P Class=ENCC>
and not have faintest idea<br>1O minutes later, like Sammy.
<SYNC Start=5215490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5216033 End=5219573><P Class=ENCC>
I didn't tell you what happened<br>to Sammy and his wife?
<SYNC Start=5219573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5221074 End=5224240><P Class=ENCC>
She came to my office. I thought she<br>was trying to catch me off guard.
<SYNC Start=5224449 End=5226907><P Class=ENCC>
I didn't tell her what I really thought.<br>I never said he was faking.
<SYNC Start=5227116 End=5229282><P Class=ENCC>
Just that his condition<br>was mental, not physical.
<SYNC Start=5229491 End=5232323><P Class=ENCC>
I found out later that she went home<br>and gave Sammy his final exam.
<SYNC Start=5232323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5234033 End=5236990><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy?<br>It's time for my shot.
<SYNC Start=5236990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

She knew beyond a doubt<br>that he loved her.

So, she found a way<br>to test him.
<SYNC Start=5259157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

Sammy?<br>It's time for my shot.

-She thought she'd call his bluff.<br>-Here you go.
<SYNC Start=5288574 End=5293032><P Class=ENCC>
Or she just didn't want to live with<br>the things she put him through.
<SYNC Start=5293032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5302616 End=5306948><P Class=ENCC>
Sammy?<br>It's time for my shot.

It won't hurt.
<SYNC Start=5315990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

She went into a coma<br>and never recovered.

Sammy couldn't understand<br>or explain what happened.
<SYNC Start=5365740><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;

He's been in a home ever since.<br>He doesn't know that his wife's dead.

I was wrong about Sammy.<br>And I was wrong about his wife.

She wasn't interested in the money.<br>She needed to understand his problem.
<SYNC Start=5379866 End=5383115><P Class=ENCC>
His brain didn't respond to<br>conditioning. He wasn't a conman.
<SYNC Start=5383324 End=5386823><P Class=ENCC>
When she looked into his eyes, she<br>thought he could be the same person.
<SYNC Start=5387033 End=5389157><P Class=ENCC>
When I looked into his eyes,<br>I thought I saw recognition.
<SYNC Start=5389533 End=5394157><P Class=ENCC>
Now I know you fake it, if you think<br>you're supposed to recognize someone.
<SYNC Start=5394366 End=5397365><P Class=ENCC>
You bluff it to get a pad<br>on the head from the doctors.
<SYNC Start=5397574 End=5400657><P Class=ENCC>

How do you know him?

Your wife surviving the assault.<br>Not believing in your condition.

The torment, the pain and<br>anguish tearing her up inside.

You exposed him for<br>what he was. A fraud.

<SYNC Start=6328032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6328949 End=6331782><P Class=ENCC>
just when you did it.
<SYNC Start=6332199 End=6334365><P Class=ENCC>
Look how happy you are.
<SYNC Start=6334365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6335741 End=6338573><P Class=ENCC>
-I wanted to see that face again.<br>-Oh, Gee. Thanks.
<SYNC Start=6338783 End=6340240><P Class=ENCC>
Fuck you.
<SYNC Start=6340408 End=6344198><P Class=ENCC>
I gave you a reason to live,<br>and you were more than happy to help.
<SYNC Start=6344574 End=6348032><P Class=ENCC>
You don't want the truth.<br>You make up your own truth.
<SYNC Start=6348241 End=6350365><P Class=ENCC>
Like your police file.
<SYNC Start=6350365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6351199 End=6353865><P Class=ENCC>
It was complete when I gave it to you.<br>Who took out the 12 pages?
<SYNC Start=6354199 End=6356907><P Class=ENCC>
-You, probably.<br>-No, it wasn't me. See? It was you.
<SYNC Start=6357116 End=6360448><P Class=ENCC>
-Why would I do that?<br>-Create a puzzle you can never solve.
<SYNC Start=6360658 End=6364948><P Class=ENCC>
You know how many towns,<br>how many John G.'s or James G.'s?
<SYNC Start=6365158 End=6368198><P Class=ENCC>
-Shit, Lenny, I'm a fucking John G.<br>-Your name's Teddy.
<SYNC Start=6368366 End=6370323><P Class=ENCC>
My mother calls me Teddy.
<SYNC Start=6370533 End=6373448><P Class=ENCC>
My name's John<br>Edward Gammell.
<SYNC Start=6373658 End=6377365><P Class=ENCC>
Cheer up. There's plenty<br>of John G.'s for us to find.
<SYNC Start=6377365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6380741 End=6385657><P Class=ENCC>
All you do is moan. I'm the one who<br>has to live with what you've done.
<SYNC Start=6385866 End=6390032><P Class=ENCC>
I'm the one that put it all together.<br>You wander around playing detective.
<SYNC Start=6390032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6390741 End=6393948><P Class=ENCC>
You live in a dream, kid.<br>A dead wife to pine for.
<SYNC Start=6394158 End=6398240><P Class=ENCC>
A sense of purpose to your life.<br>A romantic quest you wouldn't end...
<SYNC Start=6398449 End=6400490><P Class=ENCC>
even if I wasn't<br>in the picture.
<SYNC Start=6400490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6401366 End=6404115><P Class=ENCC>
-I should kill you.<br>-Quit it, Lenny. Come on.
<SYNC Start=6404324 End=6407240><P Class=ENCC>
You're not a killer.<br>That's why you're so good at it.
<SYNC Start=6407240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6410741 End=6413532><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, what are you doing?<br>You know what time it is?
<SYNC Start=6413741 End=6415698><P Class=ENCC>
It's beer o'clock.<br>I'm buying.
<SYNC Start=6415698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6417616 End=6419282><P Class=ENCC>
Fuck!
<SYNC Start=6419282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6428866 End=6431240><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not a killer.
<SYNC Start=6431408 End=6434365><P Class=ENCC>
I'm just someone who<br>wanted to make things right.
<SYNC Start=6434365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6439866 End=6443032><P Class=ENCC>
Can I just let myself forget<br>what you've told me?
<SYNC Start=6443032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6459741 End=6463198><P Class=ENCC>
Can I just let myself forget<br>what you made me do?
<SYNC Start=6463198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6476866 End=6481782><P Class=ENCC>
You think I want another puzzle to<br>solve. Another John G. to look for?
<SYNC Start=6481782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6482866 End=6485323><P Class=ENCC>
You're a John G.
<SYNC Start=6485323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6486324 End=6488532><P Class=ENCC>
So, you could be<br>my John G.
<SYNC Start=6488532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6497116 End=6499865><P Class=ENCC>
Do I lie to myself<br>to be happy?
<SYNC Start=6499865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6500408 End=6502490><P Class=ENCC>
In your case, Teddy...
<SYNC Start=6502490><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6503574 End=6505990><P Class=ENCC>
yes, I will.
<SYNC Start=6505990><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6518408 End=6521448><P Class=ENCC>
-Hey, that's not your car!<br>-It is now.
<SYNC Start=6521658 End=6523740><P Class=ENCC>
-Jesus Christ! You can't take it.<br>-Why not?
<SYNC Start=6523949 End=6527782><P Class=ENCC>
Because the guy you just killed<br>owns it. Somebody'll recognize it.
<SYNC Start=6527782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6529366 End=6532573><P Class=ENCC>
I think I'd rather be mistaken<br>for a dead guy than a killer.
<SYNC Start=6532573><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6533741 End=6535865><P Class=ENCC>
I might hang on to this<br>for a while.
<SYNC Start=6535865><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6537033 End=6541365><P Class=ENCC>
Lenny, look, don't let me...<br>Will you help me find the keys?
<SYNC Start=6541365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6542741 End=6544532><P Class=ENCC>
Help me find my keys!
<SYNC Start=6544532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6566991 End=6570032><P Class=ENCC>
I have to believe in a world<br>outside my own mind.
<SYNC Start=6570241 End=6572365><P Class=ENCC>
I have to believe that<br>my actions still have meaning.
<SYNC Start=6572533 End=6575032><P Class=ENCC>
Even if I can't<br>remember them.
<SYNC Start=6575032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6576408 End=6581115><P Class=ENCC>
I have to believe that when my eyes<br>are closed, the world's still here.
<SYNC Start=6581115><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6582783 End=6584948><P Class=ENCC>
Do I believe<br>the world's still here?
<SYNC Start=6584948><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6588033 End=6590240><P Class=ENCC>
Is it still out there?
<SYNC Start=6590240><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6593366 End=6595032><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah.
<SYNC Start=6595032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6596866 End=6599448><P Class=ENCC>
We all need mirrors to<br>remind ourselves who we are.
<SYNC Start=6599448><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6601866 End=6603532><P Class=ENCC>
I'm no different.
<SYNC Start=6603532><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6616699 End=6617782><P Class=ENCC>
Now, where was I?
