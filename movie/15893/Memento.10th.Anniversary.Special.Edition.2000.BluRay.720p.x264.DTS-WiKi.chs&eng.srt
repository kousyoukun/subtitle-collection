1
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,770
片名：记忆碎片

2
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,480
我在哪里？
So where are you?

3
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,450
某间旅馆房内
You're in some motel room.

4
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,690
一觉醒来，发觉自己在旅馆房内
You just... You just wake up, and you're in a motel room.

5
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,020
钥匙在这里
There's the key.

6
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,290
似乎刚刚住进来，但…
It feels like maybe it's the first time you've been there, but...

7
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,930
又似乎住了一个星期甚至三个月
perhaps you've been there for a week, three months.

8
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,200
很难说，我…我不知道
It's kind of hard to say. I don't... I don't know.

9
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,640
只是间普通的房间
It's just an anonymous room.

10
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,900
这个人…
This guy.

11
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,810
已经来了
He's here already.

12
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,240
莱尼！
Lenny!

13
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,050
是莱纳
It's Leonard...

14
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,080
我告诉过你
like I told you before.

15
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,350
是吗？我一定是忘了
Did you? I must have forgot.

16
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,860
我大概提到过我的病
I guess I've already told you about my condition.

17
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,090
每次见面都提
Oh, well, only every time I see you.

18
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,570
我的车
My car.

19
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,940
这是你的车
This is your car.

20
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,570
玩我
Oh, you're in a playful mood.

21
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,370
你不应该捉弄有缺陷的人
It's not good for you to make fun of someone's handicap.

22
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,810
只是开开玩笑
Just trying to have a little fun.

23
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,750
绞起玻璃窗
Roll up your window.

24
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,700
是破的
It's broken.

25
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,060
我可以修理
I can get that fixed for you.

26
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,170
你想去哪？福尔摩斯先生？
So where to, Sherlock?

27
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,560
我要去一个地方
I got a lead on a place.

28
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,530
你跑那里到底想搞什么名堂
Oh, what the hell do you wanna go there for?

29
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,530
你认识这地方
You know it?

30
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,370
只是间破屋子，为什么去？
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building. Why do you wanna go there?

31
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,540
想不起来了
Don't remember.

32
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,490
似乎有人
Looks like somebody's home.

33
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,330
车已经停了好几年了
Ah, that thing's been here for years.

34
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,570
路上的痕迹是新的
What are you talking about? These tracks are only a few days old.

35
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,210
你懂得认痕迹？
Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?

36
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,470
来吧
Come on!

37
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,550
进去看看
Let's take a look inside.

38
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,600
泰迪
"Teddy."

39
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,250
不要受他骗，是他，杀了他
"Don't believe his lies. He is the one. Kill him."

40
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,110
我终于找到他了
I finally found him.

41
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,210
我找了多久？
How long have I been looking?

42
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,280
找到什么吗？
Find anything?

43
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,150
大概没有
Didn't think so.

44
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,060
我们走吧
Let's go, huh?

45
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,990
算了
Oh, fuck this.

46
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,720
杀人偿命
You're gonna pay for what you did.

47
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,130
一命还一命！
Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.

48
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,540
神经病，你搞错了！
You don't have a clue, you freak.

49
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,540
先向我太太认错，然后受死
Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out.

50
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,810
莱纳，你真是糊里糊涂的
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

51
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,070
-知道我叫什么吗？
-泰迪
-You don't even know my name.
-Teddy.

52
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,450
你靠照片才知道
That's 'cause you read it off a fucking picture.

53
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,020
你不知道自已是谁
You don't know who you are.

54
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,490
我叫莱纳・谢尔比，旧金山人
I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco.

55
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,820
那是以前的你
That's who you were.

56
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,250
不是…
That's not...

57
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,600
现在的你
what you've become.

58
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,730
-住口
-你想知道吗？
-Shut your mouth.
-You want to know, Lenny?

59
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,370
来，我们到地下室去
Come on. Come on, let's go down to the basement.

60
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,130
一起下去
Let's go down, you and me, together.

61
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,130
你会知道自己真正是谁
Then you'll know who you really are.

62
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,280
只是间普通的房子
It's just an anonymous room.

63
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,890
抽屉空空如也，只管打开看看
There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway.

64
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,250
只有本基甸社送的圣经
Nothing except the Gideon Bible,

65
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,820
我当然诚心阅读了
which I, of course, read religiously.

66
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,560
你知道自己是谁
You know, you know who you are,

67
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,420
对自己身份有点印像
and you know kind of all about yourself.

68
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,700
至于过日常生活…
But just for day-to-day stuff,

69
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,990
字条十分有用
notes are really useful.

70
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,740
杰克斯・萨米也靠字条，不过他缺乏条理
Sammy Jankis had the same problem, but he really had no system.

71
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,240
他拼命写字条，却乱放一通
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes, but he'd get them all mixed up.

72
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,950
要有效果…
You really do need a system if...

73
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,670
就要有条理
if you're gonna make it work.

74
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,210
“不要受他的骗”

75
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,190
“他是凶手，杀了他”

76
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,200
我是304号房的住客
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.

77
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,810
有什么可以效劳？莱纳
What can I do for you, Leonard?

78
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,910
我叫波特
Burt.

79
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,980
我可能说过，我不接电话
Burt. I'm not sure. I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.

80
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,050
你记不得？
You don't know?

81
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,150
我不习惯讲电话
I'm not too good on the phone.

82
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,720
对，你喜欢面谈
Right. You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them.

83
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,090
你不记得说过？
You don't remember saying that?

84
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,090
我有种病
Well, that's the thing. I have this condition.

85
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,430
病？
Condition?

86
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,420
我的记忆
It's my memory.

87
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,460
失忆？
Amnesia?

88
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,570
不是，我没有短期记忆
No, no, no. It's different from that. I have no short-term memory.

89
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,070
我知道自己是谁，不过…
I know who I am. I know all about myself.

90
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,140
自从受了伤，我没有新记忆
Since my injury, I can't make new memories.

91
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,910
什么都记不住
Everything fades.

92
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,480
我会忘记为什么跟你谈
If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started.

93
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,910
我会忘记跟你谈过
The next time I see you, I'm not gonna remember this conversation.

94
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,580
我甚至记不得见过你
I don't even know if I've met you before.

95
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,250
假如我行动古怪、无礼…
So if I seem a little strange or rude or something, uh...

96
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,220
我都说过，是不是？
I've told you this before, haven't I?

97
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,880
是，确实太奇怪了
Yeah. I mean, I don't mean to mess with you, but it's so weird.

98
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,600
-你完全记不得我？
-记不得
-You don't remember me at all?
-No.

99
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,230
-可是我们经常交谈
-可以肯定
-We've talked a bunch of times.
-I'm sure we have.

100
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,400
你最后记得的是什么？
Well, what's the last thing you remember?

101
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,840
我太太
My wife.

102
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,530
是怎样的？
What's it like?

103
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,080
像是醒过来，像刚刚醒来
It's like waking. It's like you just woke up.

104
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,190
一定很不爽
That must suck.

105
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,750
全部都调转来
It's all backwards, I mean.

106
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,080
你或许知道要做什么
Like, maybe you get an idea about what you want to do next,

107
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,090
可是记不得做过什么
but you don't remember what you just did.

108
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,520
我却刚刚相反
I'm exactly the opposite...

109
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,460
-我在这里住了多久？
-几天
-How long have I been staying here?
-A couple of days.

110
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,630
-而你替我阻挡来电？
-就像你吩咐的
-And you're holding my calls?
-Like you said.

111
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,500
除了这个人
Okay, but this guy's an exception.

112
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,210
认识他吗？
Do you know this guy?

113
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,670
是你的朋友
Yeah, it's your friend, right?

114
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,810
你怎么知道？
What makes you think he's my friend?

115
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,770
我见过你们在一起
I just saw you together, that's all.

116
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,840
他不是我的朋友
He's not my friend.

117
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,980
假如他打电话来…
If he calls or if he shows up here,

118
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,650
或者亲自来，通知我
you give me a call in my room, okay?

119
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,810
-他叫泰迪？
-泰迪，对了
-What, his name's Teddy?
-Teddy, yeah.

120
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,060
好的
All right.

121
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,490
我希望没有给你添麻烦
Look, I hope my condition's not gonna be a problem for you.

122
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,890
只要你记得结账就行
No, not as long as you remember to pay the bill.

123
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,530
-4O块
-4O块
-Forty.
-Forty.

124
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,070
那个人…
This guy...

125
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,210
已经来了
He's here already.

126
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,580
莱尼！
Lenny!

127
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,640
“剃”

128
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,240
要有效，就要有条理
You really need a system if you're gonna make it work.

129
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,010
要相信自己的笔迹
You kind of learn to trust your own handwriting.

130
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,550
那是日常生活的重要部分
That becomes an important part of your life.

131
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,290
你为自己写备忘字条
You write yourself notes.

132
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,220
放字条的地方，也很重要
And where you put your notes... That also becomes important.

133
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,720
外衣要有六个口袋
You need a jacket that's got like six pockets in it.

134
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,830
各个口袋有各自的功能
Particular pockets for particular things.

135
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,990
要养成井井有条的习惯
You just kind of learn to know where things go and how the system works.

136
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,700
要防范别人故意混淆你
You have to be wary of other people writing stuff for you,

137
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,340
替你乱写字条
that it's gonna lead you astray.

138
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,100
世上总有那种人
I mean, I don't know how these people try and take advantage of somebody

139
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,870
把关键的资料纹在身上…
with this condition. If you have a piece of information...

140
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:55,010
是行得通的办法
which is vital, writing on your body instead of on a piece of paper can be the answer.

141
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,480
可以永久备忘
It's just a permanent way of keeping a note.

142
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,730
谁？
Who is this?

143
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,740
记住杰克斯・萨米
"Remember Sammy Jankis."

144
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,370
事实…

145
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,960
-对不起，你忘记拿走
-谢谢
-Excuse me, sir. You left these at your table.
-Thanks.

146
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,770
林肯街怎么去？
Uh... Lincoln Street?

147
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,880
沿第六街一直向东走
Oh, yeah, just go straight out on Sixth Street.

148
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,080
等一等，我要写下来
I'm gonna write this down.

149
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,370
很容易，只是直走
It's easy. Just go...

150
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,280
我的确需要写下来
Trust me. I need to write this down.

151
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,470
特惠旅馆
Discount Inn.

152
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,410
娜塔莉娅
Natalie.

153
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,480
我的车
My car.

154
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,580
泰迪
Teddy.

155
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,570
“莱纳启” “娜塔莉娅”

156
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,970
约翰・爱德华・盖玛
'John Edward Gammell."

157
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,910
他自称泰迪
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

158
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,280
不要受他骗
"Don't believe his lies."

159
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,770
-盖玛先生？
-是你吗？莱尼
-Mr. Gammell?
-Lenny, is that you?

160
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,730
你是约翰・盖玛？
John Gammell?

161
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,370
是泰迪啊，不要走开，我立即来
Lenny, it's Teddy. Stay there. I'll be right over.

162
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,480
好的，我等你
Okay. I'll be waiting.

163
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,730
“照片、房子、车、朋友、敌人”

164
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,380
“提防自己的弱点”

165
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,170
“相信事实，记忆误人”

166
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,110
“事实1：男人” “事实2：白种”

167
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,610
“事实1：男人” “事实2：白种”

168
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,800
白种男人
"White. Male"

169
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,940
“事实3：名叫约翰或者詹姆斯”

170
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,800
名叫约翰…
"First name John."

171
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,540
事实4：姓G…
"Last name 'G' for Gammell."

172
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,140
“事实4：姓G…”

173
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,710
“事实5：毒贩” “事实6：车牌 SG1371U”

174
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,770
毒贩…
"Drugs."

175
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,590
车牌
"License plate."

176
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,120
SG1371U
"SG1371U."

177
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,180
“事实5：毒贩” “事实6：车牌 SG1371U”

178
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,990
“车牌 SG1371U”

179
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,930
是他
It's him.

180
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,370
“泰迪”

181
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,540
终于找到你这个贱人
I found you, you fuck.

182
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:24,810
“不要受他骗，是他”

183
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:47,700
“约翰・G奸杀我妻子”

184
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,090
“杀了他”

185
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,970
我记不得跟你谈过
You said we talked before. I don't remember that.

186
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,070
不是失忆症
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.

187
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,930
我只是记不得受伤以后的事
I remember everything up until my injury. I just can't make new memories.

188
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,200
我们谈过什么？
So I can't remember talking to you. What did we talk about?

189
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,740
谈杰克斯・萨米？因为杰克斯・萨米和我…
Oh, Sammy Jankis. I tell people about Sammy to help them understand.

190
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,280
都有短期失忆
Sammy's story helps me understand my own situation.

191
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,410
萨米猛为自己写备忘字条
Well, Sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes,

192
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,260
不过他乱放字条
but he got mixed up.

193
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,250
我的方法更有效
I have a more graceful solution to the memory problem.

194
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,460
我有条不紊
I'm disciplined and organized.

195
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,900
所以能够应付日常生活
I use habit and routine to make my life possible.

196
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,000
萨米没有推动力去帮自己记忆
Sammy had no drive, no reason to make it work.

197
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,840
我呢？
Me?

198
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,700
“约翰・G奸杀我妻子”

199
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,280
我有推动力
I got a reason.

200
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,700
今午一点见娜塔莉娅取消息
"Today, 1:00 p.m. Meet Natalie for info.

201
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,840
她也失去爱人，会同情你、帮你
"She has also lost someone. She will help you out of pity."

202
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,420
-你是娜塔莉娅？
-你记不得我
-Natalie?
-You don't remember me.

203
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,250
对不起，我应该解释，我有…
I'm sorry. I should have explained. I have this...

204
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,560
你解释过，莱尼
You did explain, Lenny.

205
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,560
请叫我莱纳，我太太叫我莱尼
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.

206
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,060
我知道，你说过
Yeah, I know. You told me.

207
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,170
可能也说过讨厌叫莱尼
Then I probably told you how much I hated it.

208
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,770
可以取下墨镜吗？
Do you mind taking your glasses off? It's hard for me to...

209
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,140
谢谢
Thanks.

210
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,350
你有消息给我？
So you have information for me?

211
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,070
你的字条那样写？
Is that what your little note says?

212
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,340
单靠字条生活，一定很辛苦
Must be tough living your life according to a couple of scraps of paper.

213
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,240
洗衣单和杂货单调乱
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list,

214
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,480
那就麻烦了
and you'll end up eating your underwear.

215
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,960
所以你甚至备忘纹在身上
I guess that's why you have those freaky tattoos.

216
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,690
日子确实不好过
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

217
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,630
记不得你，对不起，不要见怪
Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you. It's nothing personal.

218
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,360
我的确有消息给你
I do have information for you.

219
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,210
你给我个车牌
You gave me a license plate number.

220
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,570
我去交通部查过
Had my friend at D.M.V. Trace it.

221
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,380
猜猜是谁的
Guess what name came up.

222
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,450
约翰・爱德华・盖玛，约翰・G
John Edward Gammell. John G.

223
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,950
你认识他？
Do you know him?

224
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,050
不过照片上的人看起来很熟悉
No, But his face on his driver's license looked really familiar.

225
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,590
他可能来过酒吧
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

226
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,020
这是他车牌、照片副本
Here's a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all.

227
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,420
你真的要这样做？
Are you sure you want this?

228
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,960
-我有没有说过他做过什么？
-有
-Have I told you what this man did?
-Yeah.

229
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,840
那你就不用问了
Then you shouldn't have to ask.

230
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,670
不过，你即使报了仇…
But even if you get revenge, you're not gonna remember it.

231
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,040
你也不会记得
You're not even gonna know that it happened.

232
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,740
妻子的仇不可不报
My wife deserves vengeance.

233
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,670
记不记得无所谓
Doesn't make any difference whether I know about it.

234
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,540
即使记不得
Just because there are things I don't remember

235
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,650
依然值得做
doesn't make my actions meaningless.

236
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,720
即使闭上眼睛，世界并没有消失
The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?

237
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,280
我可以拍张照片来提醒自已
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself,

238
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,620
或者再纹个备忘录在身上
get another freaky tattoo.

239
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,630
再说说她的事吧
Tell me about her again.

240
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,700
为什么？
Why?

241
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,600
因为你喜欢记起她
Because you like to remember her.

242
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,710
她漂亮
She was beautiful.

243
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,940
对我来说，她是完美的
-To me, she was perfect.
-No.

244
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,940
不要顺口说
Don't just recite the words.

245
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,920
闭上眼睛去回忆她
Close your eyes... and remember her.

246
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,100
我可以感受到细节
You can just feel the details.

247
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,230
一些平时懒得回忆的细节
The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.

248
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,440
那些非常时刻…
And you can feel these extreme moments...

249
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,880
重现眼前
even if you don't want to.

250
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,580
印像愈发清晰
You put these together, and you get the feel of a person.

251
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,190
我更怀念她
Enough to know how much you miss them...

252
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,630
也更痛恨凶手
and how much you hate the person who took them away.

253
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,780
我…我写了个地址在上面
I, um... I added an address in here.

254
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,320
也许有用，是近郊的一间荒屋
It might be useful. It's an abandoned place outside of town.

255
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,780
我的朋友曾经在那里贩毒
A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.

256
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,490
四周没有人
It's isolated.

257
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,020
好极了
Sounds perfect.

258
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,260
我应不应该付你…
Do I owe you any...

259
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,090
不用，我不是为钱
I wasn't helping you for money.

260
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,500
对不起
I'm sorry.

261
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,670
不要紧，我知道你有病
It's okay. See, you have this condition.

262
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,930
还住在优惠旅馆？你遗留在我家
Oh, are you still staying at the Discount Inn, room 304? You left it at my place.

263
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,240
-旅馆招待好吗？
-我记不得
-They treating you okay?
-I don't remember.

264
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,430
你和我有个共同点
You know what we have in common?

265
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,450
我们都懂得生存
We are both survivors.

266
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,140
保重，莱纳
You take care, Leonard.

267
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,730
记住杰克斯・萨米
"Remember Sammy Jankis."

268
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,760
我本来在保险公司服务
I met Sammy through work. Insurance. I was an investigator.

269
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,670
负责调查保险索偿
I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phony.

270
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,480
专长是辨别真与假
I had to see through people's bullshit.

271
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,240
这专长现在派上大用场
It was useful experience, 'cause now it's my life.

272
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,340
现在我靠观察去辨认…
When I meet someone, I don't know if I've met them before.

273
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,850
眼前的人是不是相识的
I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.

274
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,680
我知道
My job taught me the best way to find out...

275
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,220
观言辨色…
what someone knew was just to let them talk...

276
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,550
是了解人的最好办法
and watch the eyes and the body language.

277
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,730
譬如，一边谈话一边擦鼻子…
If someone scratches their nose while they're talking,

278
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,900
那个人可能在说谎或者紧张
experts tell you it means they're lying. It really means they're nervous.

279
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,330
紧张的原因很多，视乎情形而定
People get nervous for all sorts of reasons. It's all about context.

280
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,790
对，我是观人高手
Yeah, I was good.

281
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,070
第一个观察的人是萨米
Sammy was my first real challenge.

282
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,110
莱尼！
Yo, Lenny!

283
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,340
还以为你离开了本地
I thought you split for good.

284
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,450
-情况有变
-看得出来
-Well, things change.
-So I see.

285
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,650
我叫泰迪
My name's Teddy.

286
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,820
我大概提到过我的病
I guess I've told you about my condition.

287
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,420
每次见面都提
Only every time I see you.

288
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,350
来，我请你吃午餐
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

289
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,690
-我有没有提过杰克斯・萨米？
-有
-Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
-Mm. Yeah.

290
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,530
我听得好厌
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.

291
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,330
约翰・G呢？你认为他还在？
What about John G? you think he still here?

292
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,740
-谁？
-约翰・G，你要找的人
-Who?
-Johnny G., the guy you're looking for.

293
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,740
你为了找他，才留在本地？
That's why you haven't left town, am I right?

294
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,600
也许吧
Maybe.

295
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,110
莱纳，你非小心不可
Leonard, look, you have to be very careful.

296
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:35,940
为什么？
Why?

297
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,080
你提过有人想误导你…
The other day you mentioned that maybe somebody was trying to set you up,

298
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,980
让你杀错人
get you to kill the wrong guy.

299
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,740
我会凭事实去判断
Well, I go on facts, not recommendations, but thank you.

300
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,480
怎能凭字条、照片去决定杀谁？
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.

301
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,390
-为什么不能？
-因为字条未必可靠
-Why not?
-Because your notes could be unreliable.

302
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,890
-记忆也未必可靠
-谢谢你的好心
-Memory's unreliable.
-Oh, please!

303
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,330
记忆不准确，甚至不合用
No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good.

304
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,630
问问警察吧
Ask the police.

305
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,530
目击证供未必可靠
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

306
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,430
警察不是凭记忆缉凶
Cops don't catch a killer by remembering stuff.

307
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,240
我明白
Right...

308
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,470
-警察搜集事实，做笔记，然后作出结沦
-那不是我的意思
They collect facts, they make notes, and they draw conclusions.

309
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,000
凭事实，不是凭记忙
Facts, not memories.

310
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,840
我以前是调查员，所以知道
That's how you investigate. It's what I used to do.

311
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,450
形状、颜色等细节，未必记得准
Look, memory can change the shape of a room. It can change the color of a car.

312
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,650
可以记错
And memories can be distorted.

313
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,350
记忆只是一种演译，不是纪录
They're just an interpretation. They're not a record.

314
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,390
掌握事实，就不用靠记忆
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

315
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,120
你非报仇不可？
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

316
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,150
他杀死我的妻子，夺去我的记忆
He killed my wife. He took away my fucking memory.

317
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,000
毁灭我生存的能力
He destroyed my ability to live.

318
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:34,900
你还活着
You're living.

319
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,140
完全为了报仇
Only for revenge.

320
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,140
那么我们把这坏蛋找出来
Well, then we'll get the bastard.

321
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,440
你住在哪里？
Where are you staying?

322
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,640
特惠旅馆
The Discount Inn.

323
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,610
我不知道是哪间房间，我没有钥匙
I don't know what room. I haven't got my key.

324
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,880
可能留在房里
Probably left in in your room.

325
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,500
我是房客，不见了钥匙
I'm checked in here, but I think I've misplaced my key.

326
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,030
你好，莱纳
How you doing, Leonard?

327
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,240
可能在房里
Probably in the room, right?

328
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,960
-我的钥匙呢？
-糟糕，进错房间了
-I don't see my key anywhere.
-This is the wrong room.

329
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,330
-你现在住304号
-对不起，我搞错了
-You're in 304 now.
-I'm sorry. I fucked up.

330
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,030
-这不是我的房间？
-不是你的房间
-This is not my room?
-No.

331
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,870
我们走吧
Come on, let's go.

332
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,900
为什么有我的笔迹？
Why is this my handwriting?

333
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,740
剃左腿

334
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,940
以前是，现在你住304
This was your room, but now you're in 304.

335
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,940
-我什么时候住过这间？
-上个星期
-When was I in here?
-Last week.

336
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,550
不过我再多租你一间
But then I rented you another room on top of it.

337
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,480
为什么？
Why?

338
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,020
生意冷淡…你既然有这种病…
Business is slow. I mean, I told my boss about the...

339
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,710
我们于是多租一间给你
your condition and stuff, and he said try and rent him another room.

340
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,260
我究竟租了几间？
So how many rooms am I checked into in this shit-hole?

341
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,490
只是两间，到目前为止
Just two, so far.

342
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,420
起码你坦白承认占我便宜
Well, at least you're being honest about ripping me off.

343
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,570
你反正不会记得
Well, you're not gonna remember anyway.

344
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,670
用不着那样坦白
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

345
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,000
莱纳
Leonard,

346
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,440
每次都应该取收条
always get a receipt.

347
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,900
我会记下来
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna write that down.

348
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,750
“今午一点见娜塔莉娅取消息”

349
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,480
-现在几点了？
-12点45分
-Hey, what time is it?
-Quarter to one.

350
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,950
对不起
Excuse me.

351
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,690
你房间的…
Your room's...

352
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,200
-娜塔莉娅
-你记不得我
-Natalie?
-You don't remember me.

353
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,670
杰克斯・萨米的保险索赔…
I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.

354
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,430
十分奇特，是我接手的第一宗案子
Mr. Samuel R. Jankis. Strangest case ever.

355
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,470
萨米58岁，半退休会计师
Now, the guy's a 58-year-old semiretired accountant.

356
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,080
遇到交通意外，本来不算严重
He and his wife had been in this car accident. Nothing too serious.

357
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,180
奇怪的是，他记不住东西
But he's acting funny. He can't get a handle on what's going on.

358
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,710
医生怀疑脑部受伤
The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus.

359
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,550
但无法证实
Nothing conclusive,

360
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,120
萨米的记忆只有几分钟
but Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.

361
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,690
于是什么都不能做
Can't work, can't do shit.

362
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,520
医药费昂贵，他的妻子通知了保险公司
The medical bills pile up. His wife calls the insurance company,

363
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,730
公司派我调查
and I get sent in.

364
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,730
我初次查案，于是查得格外认真
Now, this is my first big claims investigation, so I really check into it.

365
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,000
要不要咖啡？
Can I get you some coffee?

366
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,530
萨米思考没问题
Sammy can think just fine,

367
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,500
不用客气

368
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,040
不过，他没有新记忆
but he can't make any new memories.

369
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,580
-只记得几分钟内的事
-这位是莱纳先生
-He can only remember things for a couple of minutes.
-This is Mr. Shelby.

370
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,610
他看电视，但过目则忘
He'd watch TV, but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing.

371
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,280
记得后面的，却忘了前面的
He couldn't remember how it began.

372
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,650
他喜欢看广告，因为广告简短
He liked commercials. They were short.

373
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,950
萨米，到时间打针了
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

374
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,380
不可思议的是…
The crazy part was...

375
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,290
这个连电视也没法看的人…
that this guy who couldn't even follow the plot of Green Acres anymore...

376
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,090
却能够做复杂的事
could do the most complicated things...

377
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,520
“胰岛素”

378
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,600
只要意外前学会的…
as long as he learned them before the accident...

379
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,260
专心去做就行
and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.

380
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,500
轻点
Be gentle.

381
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,330
医生说有一种罕有的病…
Now, the doctors assure me there's a real condition called anterial-grade...

382
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,810
叫“杆脉失忆”，也就是短期失忆
memory loss, or short-term memory loss. It's rare, but legit.

383
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,050
不过，我每次见到他…
Every time I see him...

384
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,880
从他的眼神…
I catch this look,

385
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,510
察觉…
this slight...

386
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,590
他好像有点认得我
look of recognition.

387
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,450
他却自称一点都认不得
But he says he can't remember me at all.

388
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,890
萨米，不要紧
Sammy, it's okay.

389
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,390
我开，我开
I got it. I got it.

390
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,160
莱纳先生
Hi, Mr. Shelby.

391
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,390
你好，杰克斯太太
Hi, Mrs. Jankis.

392
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,730
萨米，这位是莱纳先生
This is Mr. Shelby, Sammy.

393
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,630
我怀疑他在演戏

394
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,170
于是要求再做检验
So now I'm suspicious, and I order more tests.

395
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,970
醒来
Awake.

396
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,280
我在哪里？
Oh, where am I?

397
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,950
某人的卧室
Somebody's bedroom.

398
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,790
一定是她的房间
Ah, it must be her room.

399
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,790
不过，她是谁？
But who is she?

400
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,730
只是我
It's only me.

401
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,670
-睡得好吗？
-好，你呢？
-Did you sleep okay?
-Yeah. You?

402
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,680
糟糕！我有地方要去
Oh, shit. Shit! I got to be someplace.

403
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,980
相当怪异
It's pretty weird.

404
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,390
你从不把电话写在手上？
It's useful. You never write a phone number on your hand?

405
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,420
我…
I, um...

406
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,390
我今天要去交通部…
I should be able to talk to my friend today...

407
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,990
查查车牌的事
about the license plate.

408
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,160
对，车牌
Yeah, the license plate.

409
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,200
约翰・G的车牌
John G.'s license plate.

410
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,600
你把车牌纹在你的大腿上
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

411
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,650
娜塔莉娅
"Natalie."

412
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,960
她也失去爱人
"She has also lost someone.

413
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,890
会同情你、帮你
She will help you out of pity."

414
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,740
只要是本州的车牌…
If it's registered in this state,

415
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,860
几秒钟就能查出车主资料
it should only take a couple of seconds to pull up his license and registration.

416
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,940
我一有资料就通知你
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

417
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,940
不如现在就约定什么时候见面吧
Do you think we could just arrange a meeting now?

418
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,710
很感谢你
I'm not too good on the phone.

419
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,380
多谢你…
You know, it's great that you...

420
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,130
这样…帮我
well, that you're helping me like this.

421
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,770
我帮你，因为你帮过我
I'm helping you because you helped me.

422
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,410
那么，下次见面…
So next time you see me,

423
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,550
你会记得我吗？
will you remember me?

424
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,190
我认为你会
I think you will.

425
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,600
对不起
I'm sorry.

426
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,100
莱尼，可以把衣服还给我吗？
Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?

427
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,760
莱尼！
Yo, Lenny!

428
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,160
还以为你离开了本地
I thought you split for good.

429
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,600
萨米不能够用一般的方法去学习
Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.

430
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,970
不过，我认为他可以用惯性法
But I find something in my research: Conditioning.

431
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,100
重复又重复去学，一定能学会
Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.

432
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,210
就像骑单车一样
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.

433
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,840
熟能生巧
You just get better through practice.

434
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,380
没有短期记忆，也可以学会
It's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory.

435
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,450
我请医生检验萨米对惯性的反应
So I had the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning.

436
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,710
随便拣三件东西
Just pick up any three objects.

437
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,420
这就算检验？
That's a test?

438
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,050
我考会计执照，遇上你们就好
Hey, where were you guys when I did my C.P.A?

439
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,560
对不起
Sorry.

440
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,030
-搞什么？
-是检验，萨米
-Ow! What the fuck?
-It's a test, Sammy.

441
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,030
检验你个死人头
Well, test this, you fucking quack.

442
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,300
有几样通了电
Some of the objects were electrified.

443
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,840
会让他稍微触电
They'd give him a small shock.

444
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,000
通电的总是相同那几样
They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified.

445
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,040
目的是…
The point was...

446
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,980
看看萨米能不能无须记忆…
to see if Sammy could learn to avoid the electrified objects...

447
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,820
单凭本能，去避开通电的
not by memory, but by instinct.

448
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,530
娜塔莉娅，是不是？这个该死的达德是谁？
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

449
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,800
达德

450
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,740
大概再不用理会他了
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.

451
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,300
-你给我惹了什么麻烦？
-进来吧
-What the fuck have you got me into?
-Shh. Come inside.

452
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,710
-他是谁？
-冷静点
-Who is he?
-Calm down.

453
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,990
这件事你主动帮我
This is my problem.

454
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,750
跟你的调查没有关系
It has nothing to do with your investigation.

455
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,860
你给我惹了什么麻烦？
How did you get me into this?

456
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,260
你知道他打伤我，就主动帮我
You offered to help when you saw what he did to my face.

457
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,690
我怎么知道他打你？
How do I know he did that?

458
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,290
因为我告诉你
Because I came straight to you after he did it.

459
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,200
并请你帮忙
I showed you what he did, and I asked you to help me.

460
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,490
而我相信你的一面之词？
And I just take your word?

461
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,400
不对
Something doesn't feel right.

462
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,440
有人愚弄我，想误导我去杀错人
I think someone's fucking with me, trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

463
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,630
-你有没有？
-有没有什么？
-Did you?
-What?

464
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,280
-杀他？
-当然没有！
-Kill him?
-Of course not!

465
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,050
什么事嘛？坐下来
Hey, what... Sit down, okay? Sit.

466
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,920
这件事跟你无关
This has nothing to do with you.

467
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,720
你帮我，我很感激
You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

468
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,520
要用火烧
You have to burn them.

469
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,330
莱纳，你是自愿帮我的
Leonard, you decided to help me.

470
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,130
相信你自己吧，相信自己的判断
Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment.

471
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,130
不能够什么都怀疑
You can question everything. You can never know anything for sure.

472
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,370
有些事情可以肯定
There are things you know for sure.

473
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,440
比如呢？
Such as?

474
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,470
我敲一敲会有什么声音
I know what that's gonna sound like when I knock on it.

475
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,010
我捡起来会有什么感觉
I know what that's gonna feel like when I pick it up.

476
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,740
所谓肯定…
See? Certainties.

477
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,950
只是自以为错不了的记忆
It's the kind of memory you take for granted.

478
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:16,750
我只有…
You know,

479
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,080
未受伤前的记忆
I can remember so much.

480
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,680
主要是…
The feel of the world...

481
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,680
关于她
and her.

482
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,690
她已经不在人世
She's gone.

483
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,200
我现在只能靠写字条过日子
And the present is trivia, which I scribble down as fucking notes!

484
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,000
不要焦急，放松
Hey, hey, come on. Try and relax. Come on.

485
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,200
放松不容易
It's not easy for me to relax, you know? Shh.

486
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,580
脱掉外衣吧
Come on. Take your jacket off.

487
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,070
脱吧
Yeah. Come on.

488
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,690
想不到你是那种人
Didn't think you were the type.

489
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,460
是反转的
It's backwards.

490
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,270
过来
Come here.

491
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,530
过来
Come here!

492
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,730
这里呢？
What about here?

493
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,790
也许等到找到他的时候
Maybe it's for when I find him.

494
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,840
我也失去过爱人
I've lost somebody too.

495
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,040
一定很难过
I'm sorry.

496
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,110
他叫杰米
His name was Jimmy.

497
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,700
发生什么事？
What happened to him?

498
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:51,540
他去见人，一去不回
He went to meet somebody. He never came back.

499
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,770
见谁？
Who did he go to meet?

500
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,140
一个叫泰迪的人
A guy called Teddy.

501
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,420
警察找不到他？
What do the police think?

502
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,550
警察不会理会杰米那种人
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.

503
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,790
你找到那个…
When you find this guy, This...

504
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,790
约翰・G，打算怎样？
John G., what are you gonna do?

505
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,160
我要杀掉他
I'm gonna kill him.

506
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,470
我也许可以帮你找
Maybe I can help you find him.

507
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,970
我不知道她起床了多久
I don't even know how long she's been gone.

508
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,320
我醒来时，她已经不在
It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here...

509
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,720
大概是上了洗手间吧
because she's gone to the bathroom or something.

510
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,730
不过，总觉得…
But somehow I just...

511
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,200
她不会再回到床上来
I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.

512
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,510
假如我能够…
If I could just...

513
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,010
伸手过去，摸摸她那边的床…
reach over and touch her side of the bed...

514
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,340
就会知道是冷的
I would know that it was cold.

515
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,880
不过，我不能
But I can't.

516
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,820
我知道她不会再回来
I know I can't have her back.

517
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,090
我不想早上醒来，以为她还在
But I don't want to wake up in the morning thinking she's still here.

518
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,660
我独自躺在这里…
I lie here...

519
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,960
不知道躺了多久
not knowing how long I've been alone.

520
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,010
那么…
So how...

521
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,670
我怎么能够康复？
How can I heal?

522
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,480
感觉不到时间…
How am I supposed to heal if I can't...

523
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,920
我怎么能够康复？
feel time?

524
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,730
她也失去了爱人
"She has also lost someone.

525
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,970
会同情你、帮你
She will help you out of pity."

526
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,370
他们检验了萨米几个月
They kept testing Sammy for months,

527
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,400
通电的总是相同的几样
always with the same objects carrying an electrical charge.

528
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,200
搞什么鬼？
Ow! What the fuck?

529
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,270
是检验，萨米
It's a test, Sammy.

530
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,940
验你个死人头
Test this, you quack!

531
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,110
萨米即使完全短期失忆…
Even with total short-term memory loss,

532
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,010
应该能够靠本能
Sammy should have learned to instinctively

533
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,580
避免捡错物件
stop picking up the wrong objects.

534
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,850
谁都能靠惯性去学习
All the previous cases responded to conditioning.

535
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,580
萨米完全不能，于是证实…
Sammy didn't respond at all. It was enough to suggest...

536
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,390
他所患的是心理病
that his condition

537
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,350
不是生理病
was psychological, not physical.

538
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,580
保险不保心理，我们拒绝赔偿
We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

539
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,290
医药费由杰克斯太太负担，我升职
His wife got stuck with the bills, and I got a big promotion.

540
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,530
惯性对萨米起不了作用
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless.

541
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,060
对我却有效
But it works for me.

542
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,840
我不像萨米
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

543
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,710
我能够靠习惯而生活
Habit and routine make my life possible.

544
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:11,880
靠惯性
Conditioning.

545
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,810
靠本能
Acting on instinct.

546
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,590
一觉醒来
Awake.

547
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,850
我在哪里？
Where am I?

548
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,090
旅馆房间里
Motel room.

549
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,370
某家旅馆房间里
Some anonymous motel room.

550
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,440
虽然抽屉空空如也
Nothing in the drawers,

551
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,980
我还是要打开来看看
but I'll take a look anyway.

552
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,020
只有一本基甸社送的…
Nothing except the Gideon Bi...

553
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,480
圣经
Bible.

554
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,520
开门
Hey, open up!

555
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,430
等一等
Just a minute.

556
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,230
开门
Open the door.

557
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:14,300
莱尼？
Lenny!

558
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,870
“泰迪” “5550134”

559
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,400
开门
Open the door!

560
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,610
快开门
Come on!

561
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,890
泰迪
Hi, Teddy.

562
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,150
你玩够了没有？
Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

563
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,700
我明白了，隔壁有人在亲热
Oh, I get it. Amorous neighbors.

564
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:47,940
你来做什么？
What are you doing here?

565
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,840
是你叫我来的
You called me.

566
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,870
你说要我帮忙
You said you needed my help.

567
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,740
我是看在朋友的份上才帮你的
You know, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one.

568
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,510
虽然总是得忍受你一遍遍地唠叨
Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes.

569
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,740
怎么回事？
What the fuck is that?

570
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,060
-是谁？
-你不认识？
-Who the fuck is that?
-You don't know him?

571
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,250
不认识，我应该认识？
No! Should I?

572
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,420
等一等，是不是约翰・G？
Wait a minute. Is that John G?

573
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,170
相信不是
I don't think so.

574
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,060
你没有记下来？
You don't think so? You didn't write it down?

575
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,230
-我还没记就睡着了
-真离谱
-I might've fallen asleep.
-For Christ's sakes!

576
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,780
问他吧
Ask him.

577
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,280
你叫什么？
What's your name? Your name!

578
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,580
-达德
-谁打伤了你？
-Dodd.
-And who did this to you?

579
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,650
-什么？
-谁打伤了你？
-What?
-Who did this to you?

580
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,220
你
You did.

581
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,990
我不会帮你杀人
Look, I'm not gonna help you kill that guy.

582
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,320
不，让我想想
No, just let me think for a minute.

583
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,800
达德

584
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,300
“弄走他，问娜塔莉娅”

585
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,330
娜塔莉娅，谁是娜塔莉娅？
-Okay, Natalie.
-Who's Natalie?

586
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,610
-哪个娜塔莉娅？
-为什么问？
-Natalie who?
-Why?

587
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,240
说不定我认识她
Maybe I know her.

588
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,100
我们要把他弄走
Look, we gotta get him out of here.

589
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,670
他一定有车
He's gotta have a car, right?

590
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,240
送他上车
So we take him down to his car,

591
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,440
然后吓跑他
we tell him to get out of town or we're gonna kill him.

592
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,480
他在流血，怎么出去？
We can't just walk him out of here tied up and bleeding.

593
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,650
-他怎样上来的？
-不知道
-How the fuck did you get him up here?
-I don't know!

594
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,020
你不知道？
You don't know.

595
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,950
我知道这不是我的房间
Yes, I do. This is not my room.

596
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,020
一定是他的，我们自己走吧
It must be his room. Great! Let's go.

597
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,690
不可以把他留在这里
We can't just leave him here.

598
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,490
为什么？
Why not?

599
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,530
女工发现，会报警，他认得我们
The maid's gonna walk in. She'll see him, call the cops. He can I.D. Us.

600
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,610
先替他松绑、清理
Okay. We untie him, we clean him up...

601
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,400
然后用枪押走
and we march him out of here with a gun in his back.

602
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,480
枪？哪里有枪
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

603
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,140
一定是他的，我这种人不会有枪
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

604
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,350
你有枪就不得了
Fucking hope not.

605
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,460
哪一部？
Which one?

606
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,930
不如偷了他的车，作为惩戒
We should probably steal his car. You know, teach him a lesson.

607
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:56,900
住口
Shut up.

608
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,760
你开着美州豹，当然不想偷
That's all right for you to say. You're the one with the Jag.

609
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,910
好，上车
All right, get in.

610
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,940
我载他，你随后来
I'm gonna ride with him. You follow us.

611
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,070
把你的车匙拿来
Give me your keys.

612
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,080
你开自己的车吧
Take your own car.

613
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:35,570
他害怕吗？
So was he scared?

614
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,610
-他怕你那撇小胡子
-扯蛋
-Yeah. I think it was your sinister moustache.
-Fuck you.

615
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,080
你应该偷他的车
You should have stolen his car.

616
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,750
这辆有什么不好？
What's wrong with this one?

617
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,250
你想交换吗？
Nothing. You want to trade?

618
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,350
你打算怎么样？
So what do you do now?

619
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,050
我要查个清楚
I'm going to find out what the fuck that was all about.

620
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,890
娜塔莉娅，是不是？这个该死的达德是谁？
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

621
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,290
“达德”

622
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,470
萨米的妻子要负担…
Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him...

623
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,940
丈夫沉重的医药费
and fighting the company's decision.

624
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:13,040
不过，她耿耿于怀的不是钱
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

625
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,210
我没说过萨米在假装
I never said that Sammy was faking.

626
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,510
萨米…
Listen. I have an idea. Sammy,

627
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,580
我想你替我办一件事
Sammy, I have an idea I want you to do for me.

628
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,990
我只说是心理病，不是生理病
Just that his problem was mental, not physical.

629
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,090
我要你把这支笔装到口袋里
I want you to have a pen in your pocket, okay?

630
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,450
你口袋里得有支笔
You're gonna have a pen in your pocket.

631
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,550
而是不明白丈夫的病况
She couldn't understand.

632
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:26,490
还带着一本…

633
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,230
记事簿

634
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:27,990
我做错了什么？
I did something wrong.

635
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,850
你没有做错什么
You did something wrong!

636
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,060
你当然做错了，我们得想想办法
We're gonna deal with it.

637
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:35,890
她觉得，假如自己的丈夫…
When she looks into his eyes and sees the same person. If it's not a physical problem,

638
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,690
患的不是生理病，应该可以痊愈
he should just snap out of it.

639
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,100
-爱伦打过电话来
-爱伦打过电话来
-Ellen called!
-Ellen called?

640
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,970
爱伦打过电话来，爱伦…

641
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,610
爱伦今天不能来，爱伦今天…
Ellen can't come today! Ellen can't come!

642
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,280
很对不起！我已经尽了力！
I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry.

643
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,670
要更加努力！
Try harder!

644
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,820
我让她怀疑…
So good old Leonard Shelby

645
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,320
丈夫患心理病
from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt...

646
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,690
就像我让医生怀疑一样
just like he gave it to the doctors.

647
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:01,420
我从未说过他假装
But I never said that he was faking. I never said that.

648
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,960
我不觉得喝醉过
Hmm, I don't feel drunk.

649
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:23,400
喂
Hello? Housekeeping.

650
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,080
糟糕！
Oh, shit.

651
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,170
打扫

652
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,210
-现在不方便
-对不起
-Not right now.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

653
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:00,540
为娜塔莉娅收拾达德，叫泰迪帮忙
"Dodd. Put him onto Teddy or just get rid of him for Natalie."

654
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,960
达德
Dodd.

655
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,190
收拾他
Get rid of him.

656
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,120
问娜塔莉娅
Ask Natalie.

657
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,300
泰迪、泰迪
Teddy, Teddy.

658
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,940
请留下你的电话号码
Yeah, leave your number. You know what to do.

659
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,140
泰迪
Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

660
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,810
我在顶峰旅馆，6号房
I'm at the Mountcrest Inn of Fifth Street, room six.

661
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,580
请尽快来
I need you to come over as soon as you get this.

662
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,520
很重要，我是莱纳，拜拜
It's important. Oh, this is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

663
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,520
妈的
Whew. Fuck.

664
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,130
杰克斯太太不明白
Mrs. Jankis didn't understand

665
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,840
记忆是强逼不来的
that you can't bully someone into remembering.

666
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,140
施压只有弄巧反拙
The more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.

667
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,510
给我打电话，好吗？
Uh, well, then call me... call me back?

668
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,630
我在做什么？
Okay, so what am I doing?

669
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,440
我在追这个人
Oh, I'm chasing this guy.

670
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:42,110
不，他在追我
No. He's chasing me.

671
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,440
妈的
Fuck.

672
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,880
达德，白种人、顶峰旅馆
"Dodd. White guy. Mountcrest Inn on Fifth Street."

673
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,120
我不会放过你，贱种
I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.

674
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,590
顶峰旅馆

675
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,140
9995美金，月供98美金
$9995, $98 a month.

676
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,950
97款丰田RAV-4，11，995美金 月供110美金
A '97 Toyota RAV-4, $ 11,995, $ 110 a month.

677
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,790
-妈的
-96款道奇客货车，8995美金，月供95美金
-Oh, fuck.
-A '96 Dodge Caravan, $8995, $95 a month.

678
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,120
-对不起
-97款…
-Sorry.
-A '97...

679
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,820
我需要武器
I need a weapon.

680
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:39,990
这件合用
This will do.

681
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,820
我不觉得喝醉过
Hmm, I don't feel drunk.

682
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,970
“事实5：毒贩”

683
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,430
我认识他吗？
Do I know this guy?

684
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:52,400
他好像认识我
He seems to know me.

685
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,340
什么回事？
What the fuck?

686
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,320
-我喜欢你的这辆车
-谢谢
-I like your car.
-Thank you.

687
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,330
在哪里买的？
Where'd you get it?

688
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,790
你有兴趣买？
Are you interested in buying one?

689
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,200
你觉得我不起眼？
What, I haven't made a strong enough impression on you?

690
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,700
不用太自卑
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

691
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:33,900
我在做什么？
Okay, so what am I doing?

692
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,010
“事实5：毒贩”

693
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,490
谁？
Who is this?

694
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,370
继续
Ouch. Cut it out.

695
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,000
你怎么可以读完又读？
How can you read that again?

696
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,670
好看嘛
It's good.

697
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,830
你似乎读过上千次
Yeah, but you've read it, like, a thousand times.

698
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,300
我喜欢读
I enjoy it.

699
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,180
读小说
I always thought the pleasure of a book...

700
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,510
不知道下文才有趣
was in wanting to know what happens next.

701
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,110
不要那样扫兴
Look, don't be a prick.

702
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,820
我完全因为喜欢读而读
I'm not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.

703
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,310
让我读下去，好不好？
Just let me read, please.

704
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,290
可能以前烧过
Probably tried this before.

705
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,530
可能已经烧掉你很多遗物
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

706
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,110
总是忘不了你
Can't remember to forget you.

707
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,130
是
Yeah.

708
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:47,200
情况跟我所掌握的资料一致
Well, sir, that'd certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries.

709
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,730
我希望多了解毒品方面的事
I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle. Hang on a sec?

710
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:01,560
警方报告提到
Now, the police report mentioned

711
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,800
凶手车里有毒品
the drugs found in the car outside my house.

712
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,930
车是失窃的，车上遍布凶手的指纹
The car was stolen. Bloody prints were all over it.

713
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,400
我认识一位警察，报告是他给我的
I got friends in the department. They gave me a copy of it.

714
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,540
我做保险，有机会认识警察
I dealt with the police a lot in my insurance job.

715
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,210
因为我这个病…
With my condition, it's really tough. I can't...

716
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,970
我没法记得整份报告
keep it all in mind at once.

717
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,240
只好记要紧的
I have to summarize the different sections.

718
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,570
报告有几页不见了
And there's pages missing.

719
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,510
并不完整
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

720
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,610
有部分被删除掉，奇怪
I don't know why these are crossed out.

721
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,650
不过，警方并不追缉约翰・G
But they weren't even looking for John G.

722
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,440
认为没有必要
The stuff they found in the car just fit in with what they believed had happened,

723
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,160
不了了之
so they didn't chase any of it up.

724
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,510
亲爱的
Honey.

725
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:10,910
亲爱的，很晚了
Honey, it's late.

726
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:34,910
没事吧？
Everything okay?

727
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,720
你没事吧？
You okay in there?

728
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,630
满意吗？
Was it good for you?

729
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,530
什么？要我锁门？
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

730
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:06,840
不用
No.

731
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,810
你走吧
I'd like you to leave now.

732
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,390
凶手车里有毒品，是个关键
There's something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn't ring true for me.

733
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,460
事实5：毒贩

734
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,830
警方说凶手是吸毒的
Because the police claim the guy was an addict,

735
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,870
打劫我家，是为了有钱买毒品
needing money to score, which I think is bullshit,

736
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:41,400
他已经有大批毒品
'cause he's not gonna go breaking into places

737
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,170
还用打劫？
while he's still got a stash that big.

738
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,910
我认为约翰・G…
Well, I think John G. Left it there

739
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:47,210
用毒品栽赃嫁货
or planted it there.

740
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,800
你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

741
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,940
对了，怪不得
Oh, shit, that's true. It fits.

742
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,980
那么他是毒贩了
So he's a dealer.

743
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,220
等一等
Hang on a sec.

744
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:08,760
事实5：毒贩

745
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:10,800
现在有头绪了
Now we're getting somewhere.

746
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,100
特惠旅馆
"Discount Inn."

747
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,220
特惠旅馆

748
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,280
女伴服务

749
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,350
金发女郎，好
Yeah, OK. Blonde's fine.

750
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,160
对了
Well, that's what they say.

751
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:16,060
特惠旅馆，304号房间
The Discount Inn. 304.

752
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:17,800
我叫莱纳
Leonard.

753
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,380
想怎么样？
Well, what then?

754
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:24,550
我们上床，你等我睡着
We just go to bed. You wait for me to fall asleep.

755
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,490
然后上厕所，用力关门
You go into the bathroom and you slam the door.

756
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:27,630
用力关门？
Slam it?

757
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,090
用力到吵醒我
Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

758
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,820
-只是这样吗？
-只是这样
-And that's it?
-That's it.

759
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,760
先把这些东西四处放
yeah, first I just need you to put these things around the room.

760
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,940
假装是你的东西、你的卧室
Just pretend they're your things and that this is your bedroom.

761
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:55,820
要我穿上去吗？
Should I wear it?

762
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:00,020
不用，就好像你刚刚脱下来
No, no, no. Uh, just like you took it off or something.

763
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,590
我不要你用，对不起
I-I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

764
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:09,100
只要你随便放在房里
Just... I just mean put them around the room, you know,

765
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:11,670
就像是你的…你的东西
as if they were your... your things.

766
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,640
你喜欢怎么样就怎么样好了
Whatever gets you off.

767
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:44,960
我不怪警方不理会
I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously.

768
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,140
我的病不容易明白
This is difficult to understand.

769
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,540
看看杰克斯・萨米吧
I mean, look at Sammy Jankis.

770
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,040
杰克斯太太实在受不了
His own wife couldn't deal with it.

771
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,840
怎么都不能让他恢复记忆
I told you about how she tried to get him to snap out of it.

772
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,170
她终于来办公室见我
Eventually she came to see me at the office. I found out all kinds of shit.

773
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,720
说用尽办法强逼萨米记忆
She told me about life with Sammy, how she treated him.

774
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,010
谢谢你见我
Thank you for seeing me.

775
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,380
甚至要萨米
It got to the point where she'd get Sammy

776
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:03,890
把食物收藏起来
to hide food all around the house...

777
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,690
要他记着收藏地点
and then she'd stop feeding him just to see if his hunger...

778
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,790
否则就挨饿
would make him remember where he'd hidden the food.

779
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,660
她不是狠心，只是希望萨米康复
She wasn't a cruel person. She just wanted old Sammy back.

780
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,390
你认为萨米在假装
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you've decided that he's faking.

781
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:19,300
公司并没有说萨米假装
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is faking anything.

782
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,130
只是认为他的病不是…
It's just that his condition can't be shown to be...

783
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:24,710
我只想知道你的真正看法
I just wanna know what your honest opinion about Sammy is.

784
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,910
案件在上诉，我们不应该讨论
We shouldn't even be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal.

785
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,580
我不会提出上诉
I'm not appealing the decision.

786
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:31,150
那么你想怎么样？
Then why are you here?

787
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,690
当我看到萨米
Try to understand. When I look at Sammy,

788
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:37,080
我看的不是植物人
I don't see some... vegetable.

789
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:39,160
而是以前的萨米
I see my same old Sammy.

790
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,900
我总是抱有希望
What do you think that's like for me...

791
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:45,930
总希望他完全是心理作祟
to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem?

792
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,030
总希望有办法…
And that if I just could say the right thing,

793
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,930
让他痊愈
he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal.

794
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:53,840
如果…
If I...

795
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,470
萨米确实无可药救，那么…
If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone,

796
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:04,410
我会抛开过去，爱现在的萨米
then I could say good-bye and start loving this new Sammy.

797
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,620
一天抱有希望，一天就死心不息
As long as I have doubt, I can't say good-bye and move on.

798
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,090
你要我怎么样？
What do you want from me?

799
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:14,520
我要你撇开公事半分钟
I want you to forget the company you work for for 30 seconds...

800
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:18,600
告诉我萨米是不是假装
and tell me if you really believe that Sammy's faking his condition.

801
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:20,760
我需要知道…
I need to know...

802
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,400
你真正的想法
what you honestly believe.

803
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:32,170
我相信萨米有记忆能力
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.

804
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,190
我以为帮了她
I thought I helped her.

805
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,020
以为她只是要一个答案
I thought she just needed some kind of answer.

806
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,130
以为什么答案都不重要
I didn't think it was important what the answer was,

807
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,700
“事实5：毒贩”

808
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,060
以为她只要一个可信的答案
just that she had one to believe.

809
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,970
这样好的车，你应该上锁
A car this nice you should lock.

810
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,710
-你是谁！
-你的朋友泰迪
-Who the fuck are you?
-Teddy, your buddy.

811
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:12,510
证明一下！
Prove it.

812
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,520
你告诉过我萨米的事
Sammy. Remember Sammy? You told me about Sammy!

813
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:20,920
你在我车内干什么？
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

814
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,960
你连幽默感也忘掉？
What, your sense of humor went with the memory?

815
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:25,030
你为什么在这里，知道吗？
Do you even know why you're here?

816
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,270
有未了结的事
Unfinished business.

817
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,430
莱尼
Lenny,

818
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:31,460
告诉你吧，你的事已经了结
let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished.

819
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,230
你为了娜塔莉娅，所以还在这里
You're still here because of Natalie.

820
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:34,070
谁是娜塔莉娅？
Who's Natalie?

821
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,970
傻瓜，你刚从谁的家走出来？
Schmuck, whose house do you think you just walked out of?

822
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,640
对，看看照片吧
Oh, that's right. Take a look at your pictures.

823
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:43,180
你肯定有她的照片
I bet you got one of her.

824
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,340
拍得好啊，大摄影师
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz.

825
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,890
记下来吧
You'll wanna make a note.

826
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,590
不要相信她
You can't trust her.

827
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:52,620
为什么？
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

828
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,060
因为她看出你有钱…
Because by now she's taken a look at this suit and the car...

829
01:05:56,470 --> 01:06:00,530
打算利用你，捞点油水
and she's starting to figure out ways of turning the situation to her advantage.

830
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,130
她已经把你搭上手了
She's already got you staying with her, for Christ's sakes.

831
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:05,500
你不可以回她的家
You can't go back in there.

832
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,140
我介绍你入住间旅馆吧
Let me give you the name of a motel.

833
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,440
碰到我，算你运气好
You're lucky I ran into you. That broad's bad news.

834
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,870
那女的为什么碰不得？
What do you mean, "bad news"?

835
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,340
她涉及毒品
She's involved with drugs.

836
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:14,980
看到吗？
All right, look. These. You see these?

837
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,240
费迪斯酒吧

838
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,420
这是她服务的酒吧
This is the bar where she works.

839
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,380
她的男朋友是毒贩
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

840
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,120
她替他办事，传递消息
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

841
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:26,160
他把讯息写在纸的背后
He writes messages on the back of these.

842
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,090
她趁斟酒时给他，偷偷替他传递
Then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks.

843
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,190
关我什么事？
Why should I care?

844
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,690
因为她惹上了麻烦…
Because when she gets jammed up,

845
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:35,330
打算利用你来替她解决
she's gonna use you to protect herself.

846
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,470
谁想找她的麻烦？
From who?

847
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:39,370
想知道她男朋友下落的人
Guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.

848
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:42,970
那人要找她出气．总有人受罪
Guys are gonna come after her. Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.

849
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:44,800
一定有人受罪
Somebody always pays.

850
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,350
也许她想用你来挡灾
Maybe she'll make it you.

851
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:48,540
-是吗？
-也许她想利用你来挡灾
-Oh, yeah?
-Well, maybe she'll make it you.

852
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:49,680
是不是？
Is that it?

853
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,720
你担心她利用我来对付你
You worried that she's gonna use me against you?

854
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,490
为什么不会？
-No.
-Why not?

855
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,850
因为她不认识我
Because she doesn't know who I am.

856
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,850
-你为什么跟着我？
-也许我想帮你
-Why are you following me?
-Maybe I wanna help.

857
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,950
她完全不知道你在调查什么
She doesn't know anything about your investigation,

858
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:06,890
天才，记下来吧
okay, Einstein? So write this down.

859
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,230
她提议帮你，其实是为了自已
When she offers to help, it'll be for her own reasons.

860
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:17,170
我没有骗你，用我这支笔记下来
I'm not lying. Take my pen. Write this down.

861
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:19,140
不要相信她
Do not trust her.

862
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,750
现在高兴了没有？
There. You happy now?

863
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,550
你离开本地我才高兴
I won't be happy until you leave town.

864
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:31,780
为什么？
Why not?

865
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,230
你留下来
You ever wonder how long you can hang around here

866
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,090
迟早有人会问
before people start asking questions?

867
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,220
问什么？
What sort of questions?

868
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:39,300
问你自己应该问的问题
The same sort of questions you should be asking yourself.

869
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,260
例如呢？
Like what?

870
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,160
你为什么穿着名牌西服？开着名牌车？
Like, how did you get this suit, the car?

871
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,670
-我有钱
-从哪里来？
-I have money.
-From what?

872
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:44,730
我太太去世了
My wife's death.

873
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,260
我以前在保险公司工作，所以买足了保险
I used to work in insurance. We were well covered.

874
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:53,040
你痛失娇妻，于是去买美州豹？
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership.

875
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,880
回答不出来吧
You don't have a clue, do you?

876
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:59,990
-你连自已是谁都不知道
-我知道
-You don't even know who you are.
-Yes, I do.

877
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,580
我没有失忆
I don't have amnesia.

878
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:04,050
意外前的事我统统记得
I remember everything right up until the incident.

879
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,020
我叫莱纳・谢尔比，旧金山人
I am Leonard Shelby. I am from San Francisco...

880
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,820
那是以前的身份
That's who you were.

881
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,220
你不知道现在的身份
You do not know who you are,

882
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:12,190
意外发生后…
what you've become since...

883
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,060
你变成怎么样的人
the incident.

884
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,660
你到处扮侦探
You wander around playing detective.

885
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,670
连扮了多久都不知道
You don't even know how long ago it was.

886
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:22,270
让我问问你
Let me put it this way.

887
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,640
你推销保险，够钱穿名牌西装
Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?

888
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:28,010
-不是推销，是调查
-对
-I didn't sell insurance. I investigated it.
-Right.

889
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,480
你是调查员
You're an investigator.

890
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,510
你预先应该调查自已
Well, maybe you should start investigating yourself.

891
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:34,910
谢谢你的忠告
Thank you for the advice.

892
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:39,520
帮个忙，不要回到她家去
Look, do me a favor. Don't go back in there.

893
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:42,360
住旅馆好不好？
Will you take the motel out of town?

894
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,530
拜拜，莱尼
It's been fun, Lenny.

895
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:56,770
不要相信她
"Do not trust her."

896
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:58,610
“泰迪” “5550134”

897
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,840
不要受他的骗
"Don't believe his lies."

898
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:14,190
“特惠旅馆”

899
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:16,060
算了，我自己租房住
Oh, fuck it. I need my own place.

900
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,400
“特惠旅馆”

901
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:26,610
杰克斯太太不应该逼我回答那种问题
No. She shouldn't have given me that responsibility.

902
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,400
我是保险调查员，不是医生
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.

903
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:33,250
对
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

904
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,380
我有很多顾虑
But I've got all sorts of other considerations.

905
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:39,250
法律责任、大笔的赔款…
Legal responsibility, large financ...

906
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,410
“绝不要接听电话”

907
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:44,790
谁？
Who is this?

908
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:59,100
记下来，记下所发生的事情
Write this down. Write down what happened.

909
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:02,570
记下来，集中精神，记着
Write it down. Write it down. Come on. Concentrate. Keep it in mind. Find a pen...

910
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,150
什么事？
What happened?

911
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:12,350
还用问？他打我
What does it look like? He beat the shit out of me.

912
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,590
谁？
Who?

913
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,920
谁？
Who?

914
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:17,960
达德啊！达德打我
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd. Dodd beat the shit out of me.

915
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,660
-为什么？
-为什么？都是你
-Why?
-Why? Because of you.

916
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:21,690
我照你的吩咐，去找他
-Because I did what you told me to do!
-Calm down.

917
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:24,420
告诉他泰迪的事，结果挨打！
Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea!

918
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:26,530
冷静点
Calm down. Take it easy.

919
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,770
不要怕
You're safe. It's okay.

920
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:31,760
坐下来
Come on. Just sit down.

921
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:33,210
坐
Sit down.

922
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,310
坐
Here. Sit down.

923
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:38,610
不要怕
Okay. You're okay.

924
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,240
我拿些冰来给你敷脸
I'll just get some ice for your face.

925
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,960
我按照你的吩咐去做
I did exactly what you told me to do.

926
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,790
我去找达德
I went to Dodd...

927
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:06,600
告诉他杰米的钱、毒品…
and I told him that I... I didn't have any of Jimmy's money...

928
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:09,330
都不在我身上
or the drugs,

929
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:13,570
肯定统统被那个泰迪拿掉
and that this Teddy must have taken everything.

930
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,580
他怎么说的？
And what did he say?

931
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,550
他不相信我
He didn't believe me.

932
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:24,510
限我明天交出毒品，否则就杀我
He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

933
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:27,020
说完了就打我
And then he just... he just started hitting me.

934
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,200
他在哪里？
Where is he?

935
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:32,730
为什么问？
Why?

936
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,740
我要去见他
I'll go see him.

937
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:35,660
然后呢？
And?

938
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,860
打他，叫他去找泰迪
I'll give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

939
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:41,470
他会杀了你的，莱尼
Ah, he'll kill you, Lenny.

940
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:46,470
-我太太叫我莱尼
-是吗？
-My wife used to call me Lenny.
-Yeah?

941
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,880
我讨厌莱尼这个名字
Yeah. I hated it.

942
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:54,420
达德这个人惹不得
Oh, this guy... this guy is so dangerous.

943
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,280
我们另想办法吧
Let's just think of something else, okay?

944
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:59,420
告诉我他的模样…
No, no. You just tell me what he looks like...

945
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,490
哪里能找到他就行了
and where I can find him.

946
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:02,960
你有笔吧？
Have you got a pen?

947
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,230
在手袋内
In my purse.

948
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,610
他…他也许会找你
He'll, um... He'll probably find you.

949
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:18,940
什么意思？
What do you mean?

950
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:20,780
我告诉他你的车
I told him about your car.

951
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,410
为什么？
Why?

952
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:27,550
我挨不住打，只好说点东西
He was beating the shit out of me. I had to tell him something.

953
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:30,790
写下来吧
Just write it all down.

954
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:47,130
小心
Be careful.

955
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,240
不用担心
I'll be fine.

956
01:12:57,890 --> 01:12:59,320
这样名贵的车，你应该上锁
A car this nice you should lock.

957
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,520
你是谁？
Who the fuck are you?

958
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,090
“绝不要接听电话”

959
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:20,400
柜台吗？我是21号房的莱纳
Front desk? Burt. Right. This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.

960
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:23,070
对，我不要接听电话
Yeah, that's it. I don't want any calls.

961
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:25,110
对，什么电话都不听
Nope. None at all.

962
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:38,390
-什么事？
-有人来过
-What's wrong?
-Somebody's come already.

963
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:40,620
-是谁？
-他自称达德
-Who?
-He calls himself Dodd.

964
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,020
什么？
What does he want?

965
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:43,730
追问杰米和他的钱的下落
He wants to know what happened to Jimmy and his money.

966
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,500
他以为我私吞了
He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.

967
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:46,400
你有没有？
Oh. Well, did you?

968
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:48,160
没有
No.

969
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,740
-怎么回事？
-妈的
-What's this all about?
-Fuck!

970
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,780
你什么都不知道
You don't have a fucking clue, do you?

971
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,810
你…你无知得相当舒服
You're just blissfully ignorant.

972
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,140
我有种病
Look, I have this condition.

973
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,310
我知道你的病
Yeah, I know all about your fucking condition, Leonard!

974
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,710
我可能比你更清楚
Probably know more about it than you do.

975
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:05,720
你什么都不知道
You don't have a clue about anything else.

976
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:06,950
什么事？
What happened?

977
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,990
杰米去了见一个叫泰迪的人
Jimmy went to meet some guy named Teddy.

978
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:12,520
他拿了很多钱去，一去不返
He took a lot of money with him, and he never came back.

979
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,260
杰米的拍档以为我是合谋
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.

980
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,760
我连你认不认识泰迪都不知道
I don't even know if you know this, Teddy, or how well.

981
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,490
-我也不知道
-不要维护他！
-Neither do I.
-Don't protect him!

982
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,230
我没有维护他
I'm not.

983
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,230
-帮帮我
-怎么帮？
-Help me.
-How?

984
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:22,260
替我铲除达德
Get rid of Dodd for me.

985
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:23,560
什么？
What?

986
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:25,200
杀掉他，我付你钱
Kill him. I'll pay you.

987
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,170
什么？我不会为钱杀人
What do you think I am? I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

988
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:32,000
那么为什么？为爱？
What then? Love? What would you kill for?

989
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:33,800
你肯为太太杀人
You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?

990
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:34,740
那是另一回事
That's different.

991
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,580
对我是同一回事
Not to me. I wasn't fucking married to her.

992
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:38,480
不要谈我太太
Hey, don't talk about my wife.

993
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:40,950
我要谈谁，就谈谁
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

994
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:43,550
无论我说什么，你都记不得
I can say whatever I want and you won't remember.

995
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:45,490
骂你老婆是婊子，我们还可以做朋友
I could call your wife a fucking whore.

996
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:46,230
冷静点
Calm down.

997
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:49,330
你是白痴，根本不识死
Easy for you to say. You can't get scared. You don't know how, you fucking idiot!

998
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:51,360
不要冲动，这事跟我无关
Take it easy. This has nothing to do with me.

999
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:52,370
可能有关！
Maybe it does.

1000
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,200
你怎么知道无关？
How the fuck would you know?

1001
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,300
你不识死
You don't know a fucking thing!

1002
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,910
-不过会生气？
-会！
-You can't get scared, but can you get angry?
-Yes.

1003
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:01,700
你这个该死的猪
Ah, you pathetic piece of shit.

1004
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,770
无论我说什么…
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

1005
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:06,840
你都莫名其妙，死蠢材
and you won't have a fucking clue, you fucking retard!

1006
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:08,170
-住口
-知不知道？
-Shut your mouth.
-You know what?

1007
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:09,420
我会利用你
I'm gonna use you.

1008
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:11,780
我声明会利用你，你这个神经病…
I'm telling you now, because I'm gonna enjoy it so much more...

1009
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:14,890
照样会给我利用
if I know that you could stop me if you weren't such a fucking freak.

1010
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,750
你丢掉了笔？
Did you lose your pen?

1011
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:18,720
太倒霉了，神经病
Well, that's too bad, freak.

1012
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:21,690
否则你会记下娜塔莉娅…
Otherwise, you could write yourself a little note about how much Natalie...

1013
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:24,460
恨透你了，同时认为你老婆是个婊子
hates your retarded guts and that I called your wife a whore.

1014
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:25,600
不准再说！
Don't say another fuckin' word.

1015
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:26,900
不准再说什么？你老婆是婊子？
About your whore of a wife?

1016
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,670
据说短期失忆…
I read about your condition, Leonard.

1017
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,600
这种病，其中一个成因…
You know what one of the causes of short-term memory loss is?

1018
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,070
是性病
Venereal disease.

1019
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,780
也许你的淫贱老婆…
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife...

1020
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,350
搞过有性病的男人，传染给你
sucked one too many diseased cocks

1021
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:44,610
把你传染成白痴！
and turned you into a fucking retard!

1022
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:50,320
死神经病！
You sad, sad... freak.

1023
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,950
我想说什么就说什么
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

1024
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,900
你不会记得
and you won't remember.

1025
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:59,260
我们依然做好朋友
We'll still be best friends...

1026
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,240
甚至做情人
or maybe even lovers.

1027
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,000
妈的
Fuck.

1028
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,870
再见
I'll see you soon.

1029
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:25,920
集中精神，找支笔记下来
Stay focused. Find a pen. Gotta write this down.

1030
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,790
记下来
Gotta write it down.

1031
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,100
集中精神…
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

1032
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,410
记住、记住…
Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.

1033
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,840
找支笔，我要找支笔
Come on. Find a pen. I have to find a pen.

1034
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,240
记下来
Write this down.

1035
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:44,680
统统记下来
Write this down, exactly what happened.

1036
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:45,980
记下所发生的事情
Gonna write down exactly what happened.

1037
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,350
快点！我要找支笔！
Come on. Come on. Come on. Find a pen. Jeez! Come on.

1038
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,910
集中精神
Okay, focus. Keep focused.

1039
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:54,320
记住
Keep... Keep it in mind.

1040
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:56,390
快找支笔，记下来
Come on. Find a pen. Write this note.

1041
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,860
记下所发生的事情
Write down what happened. Write it down. Write it down. Come on.

1042
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:01,130
集中精神，记住，找支笔
Concentrate. Keep it in mind. Find a pen.

1043
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:10,240
发生了什么事？
What happened?

1044
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,370
还用问？他打我
What does it look like? He beat the shit out of me.

1045
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:13,770
谁？
Who?

1046
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:15,280
谁？
Who?

1047
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,180
达德啊！达德打我
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd. Dodd beat the shit out of me.

1048
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:34,400
我是柜台的波特
It's Burt, from the front desk.

1049
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,300
你吩咐过不接电话
I know you said you didn't want any calls.

1050
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:42,100
可是这个人自称警察
But this guy called. He's on the phone now. He says he's a cop.

1051
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,210
警察？
-A cop?
-Yeah.

1052
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:47,340
他说…他有你要的资料
And, uh, he says you're really gonna wanna know what he has to say, so...

1053
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,980
我不喜欢讲电话
I'm not too good on the phone.

1054
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,610
我要面对面谈
I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them.

1055
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:51,910
那么…怎样了？
Well, what...

1056
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:59,220
去沙发歇歇吧
You can, um... You can crash on the couch.

1057
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:00,260
会很舒服的
It's comfortable.

1058
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:01,780
坐吧
Just have a seat.

1059
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:11,000
你认为需要多久？
So how long do you think it's gonna take you?

1060
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:15,670
多久才找得到杀妻仇人？
You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife?

1061
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:20,940
要看他是在本地还是在外地
Oh, well, that depends on if he's here in town or if he's moved on.

1062
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,650
我有他的资料
I have my file here.

1063
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:27,350
让我问问你
Can I ask you something?

1064
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,420
你既然资料齐全…
If you have all of that information,

1065
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,180
为什么警方不替你缉凶？
then why haven't the police found him for you?

1066
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:35,290
-警方不肯缉凶
-为什么？
-Well, they're not looking for him.
-Why not?

1067
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,560
他们认为已经没有凶手
They don't think he exists.

1068
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,930
我把经过告诉了他们
You see, I told them what I remembered.

1069
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:42,760
我正在睡觉
I was asleep.

1070
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:45,330
突然醒来
Something woke me up.

1071
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,910
她的床是凉的，下了床相当久
Her side of the bed was cold. She'd obviously been out of bed for awhile.

1072
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:54,570
肯定有第二个凶手
There had to be a second man.

1073
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,700
他从后袭击我
Somebody hit me from behind.

1074
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,740
此后，我什么都不记得
I remember. It's about the last thing that I do remember.

1075
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:02,440
警方不相信有第二个凶手
Look, the police did not believe me. If we check the police...

1076
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,610
警方怎么解释案情？
How do they explain what you do remember?

1077
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:06,150
怎么解释枪和其他？
The gun and stuff.

1078
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:10,550
约翰・G很狡猾
John G. Was clever.

1079
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:12,650
很狡猾
He was clever.

1080
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,930
他拿掉死者的枪
See, he took the dead man's gun

1081
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,630
换上袭击过我的棍子
and replaced it with the sap that he hit me with.

1082
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,730
留下我的枪和贼车
He left my gun and he left the getaway car.

1083
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,490
于是误导了警方
He gave the police a complete package.

1084
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:26,240
警方在死者手中的棍子上发现我的血迹
The found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand.

1085
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,930
并且只找到我的枪
And they only found my gun.

1086
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:31,570
于是断定只有一个凶手
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

1087
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,110
我认为有第二个，可是我伤了脑子
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.

1088
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:40,080
警方不会相信有脑病的人
-See, the cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition.
-Leonard,

1089
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,520
你可以在这里住几天
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help you.

1090
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,490
我要上班去
I have to go back to work.

1091
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:53,420
不用客气，随便看电视
So, um, just make yourself at home. You can watch TV, or...

1092
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:56,160
随便吃东西
you can have some food, whatever you want, okay?

1093
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:57,270
不用客气
Make yourself at home.

1094
01:20:58,210 --> 01:20:58,930
一件事
One thing.

1095
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,500
我想记得你
Something to remember you by.

1096
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:05,070
我叫娜塔莉娅
My name is Natalie.

1097
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:09,380
娜塔莉娅
"Natalie."

1098
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:29,430
“记住杰克斯・萨米”

1099
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,310
-什么事？
-有人来过
-What's wrong?
-Somebody's come already.

1100
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,440
“接我电话”

1101
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:34,360
免费
On the house.

1102
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,800
你确实有问题
My, you really do have a problem.

1103
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,330
正如警察所说的一样
Just like that cop said.

1104
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:48,270
你有病
Your condition.

1105
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:50,820
没有人十全十美
Well, nobody's perfect.

1106
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:55,510
你最后记得的是什么？
What's the last thing that you do remember?

1107
01:22:59,090 --> 01:22:59,650
我太太
My wife.

1108
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:00,860
真是多情
That's sweet.

1109
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,090
垂死…
Dying.

1110
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,220
我太太垂死的情形
I remember my wife dying.

1111
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,530
我替你换杯子
Let me, um, get you another one.

1112
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:14,830
这个杯子有灰尘
I think this one's dusty.

1113
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,540
-你为什么找我？
-要什么？
-Why are you calling me?
-What do you want?

1114
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:23,670
我知道你是警察
I know you're a cop, but what do you want?

1115
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,010
我犯了法？
Have I done something wrong?

1116
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:27,880
做了坏事？
I don't know. Something bad, maybe.

1117
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,490
为什么问我？我记不得
Why are you asking me? I can't remember what I've done.

1118
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:33,880
你反正不会相信
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

1119
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:37,150
你不会相信我有这种病
Because of my condition. You don't believe someone with this condition.

1120
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:40,100
就像我不相信萨米一样！
Nobody believed Sammy! I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

1121
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,730
费迪斯酒吧
"Ferdy's Bar."

1122
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,630
下班来，娜塔莉娅
"Come by after. Natalie."

1123
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:03,950
啤酒，麻烦你
I'll have a beer, please.

1124
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:06,160
-要什么？
-啤酒，麻烦你
-What do you want?
-A beer, please.

1125
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:08,620
你穿成那模样来喝啤酒？
You can't just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer.

1126
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:10,920
-你们有服装规定？
-要什么？
-What, is there a dress code?
-Why are you here?

1127
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:12,360
我想找个叫娜塔莉娅的人
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.

1128
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,200
我就是
Well, that's me.

1129
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,200
我们见过面，是不是？
Yeah. We met before, right?

1130
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,670
那么我来做什么？
Then why am I here?

1131
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,030
不知道，你自己说好了
I don't know. Tell me.

1132
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,800
我记不得，我没有短期记忆
I don't remember. I have no short-term memory. It's not amnesia.

1133
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,240
原来你是那个失忆的人
Oh, you're the memory guy.

1134
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,740
你怎么知道？
How do you know about me?

1135
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,840
我男朋友提过你
My boyfriend told me about you.

1136
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:29,440
你男朋友叫什么？
Yeah? Who's your boyfriend?

1137
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:31,740
杰米・格兰斯，认识吗？
Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

1138
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:33,920
不认识
No.

1139
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,920
他认识你
Well, he knows you.

1140
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:39,520
提到过你，说你住在特惠旅馆
He told me about you. He said you were staying at the Discount.

1141
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:42,750
前不久有警察来找过你
In fact, a cop came by here earlier looking for you.

1142
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,420
说要找一个…
Said he was looking for a guy who can't remember anything,

1143
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:47,560
懵懵懂懂的人
wouldn't know how he got here or what he'd done.

1144
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:49,770
说我这里很多这种人
Said I get a lot of guys around here like that.

1145
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:53,800
酗酒是短期失忆的一个原因
Well, you know, chronic alcoholism is one cause of short-term memory loss.

1146
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:57,270
你叫泰迪？
Are you Teddy?

1147
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:58,840
不是，我叫莱纳
No. My name is Leonard.

1148
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:01,410
-泰迪派你来？
-我不知道
-Did Teddy send you?
-I don't know.

1149
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:03,780
杰米现在怎样了？
What's happened to Jimmy?

1150
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,380
我也不知道，对不起
I don't know that either. Sorry.

1151
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:07,680
你什么都记不得？
You don't remember anything?

1152
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:10,790
记不得去过哪里、做过什么？
You don't remember where you've been or what you've just done.

1153
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:13,120
记不得，我没有短期记忆
No. I can't make new memories.

1154
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:14,890
什么都忘掉
Everything just fades.

1155
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:16,360
那么你来做什么？
Then why did you come here?

1156
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:17,820
我在口袋里找到这个
I found this in my pocket.

1157
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,400
你的口袋？
Your pocket.

1158
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,660
酒吧赌注，有兴趣参加吗？
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

1159
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,460
不用客气
No, thanks.

1160
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:52,560
彩金好多
It's for a lot of money.

1161
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:55,790
参加嘛，是慈善的
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity. Help me out.

1162
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,000
免费
On the house.

1163
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:36,560
谁也不相信我
It's completely fucked because nobody believes you.

1164
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:40,570
脑部受损，连说话也没有人信
It's amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility.

1165
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:43,810
我以前不信萨米，应该有此报应
I guess it's some kind of poetic justice for not believing Sammy.

1166
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,950
患我这种病的人…
You know the truth about my condition, officer?

1167
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:47,940
什么都不知道
You don't know anything.

1168
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,650
生气生得莫名其妙
You feel angry, you don't know why.

1169
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:53,890
内疚得莫名其妙
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

1170
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:57,790
无论什么，十分钟就忘掉
You could do anything and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later.

1171
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,830
萨米的事…
Like Sammy. I could have done something like Sammy.

1172
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:01,460
我有没有告诉你？
I didn't tell you...

1173
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:03,830
萨米和他太太的事
what happened to Sammy and his wife?

1174
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:07,300
她到我办公室见我
Well, she came to see me at my office.

1175
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:08,970
我以为她在试探
I thought she was just trying to catch me off guard,

1176
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:11,570
我没有对她说真心话
so I didn't tell her what I really thought, but I never said that he was faking,

1177
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,800
只说他的病是心理上的，而不是生理的
just that his condition was mental, not physical.

1178
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:17,140
她回家，替萨米做最后的测试
I found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam.

1179
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,480
萨米
Sammy?

1180
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:21,380
到时间替我打针了
It's time for my shot.

1181
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,230
她深信萨米爱她
She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her.

1182
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:42,130
于是用这个测试办法
So she found a way to test him.

1183
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,140
萨米
Sammy.

1184
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:58,990
到时间替我打针了
It's time for my shot.

1185
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,800
她以为可以拆穿他
She really thought she'd call his bluff.

1186
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,040
打了
There you go.

1187
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:16,740
否则，她不想再活下去
Or she just didn't wanna live with the things she put him through.

1188
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:28,220
萨米
Sammy.

1189
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:31,490
到时间替我打针了
It's time for my shot.

1190
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,420
不会痛
It won't hurt.

1191
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:25,670
她不省人事，接着就死了
She went into a coma and never recovered.

1192
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:29,870
萨米不明白，也不能解释
Sammy couldn't understand or explain what happened.

1193
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:33,920
从此长住疗养院
He's been in a home ever since.

1194
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:35,950
连妻子去世也不知道
He doesn't even know that his wife's dead.

1195
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:40,060
我看错了萨米，看错了他太太
I was wrong about Sammy, and I was wrong about his wife.

1196
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:43,920
她不是为钱，只是想了解病情
She wasn't interested in the money. She just needed to understand his problem.

1197
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:46,500
他对惯性没有反应
His brain didn't respond to conditioning.

1198
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,930
可是他不是骗子
But he wasn't a con man.

1199
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:51,330
她以为萨米没有变
And when she looked into his eyes, she thought he could be the same person.

1200
01:29:51,770 --> 01:29:54,070
我也以为萨米认得我
When I looked into his eyes, I thought I saw recognition.

1201
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:55,810
我现在知道是假装的
Now I know. You fake it.

1202
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,940
他假装认得人
If you're supposed to recognize somebody, you just pretend to.

1203
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:01,240
也许是为了博取赞许
You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors.

1204
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,240
也许为了冒充正常
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1205
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:09,410
什么毒贩？
What drug dealer?

1206
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:17,890
“事实6：车牌 SG1371U”

1207
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,930
“纹身店”

1208
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:23,370
“事实6：车牌…”

1209
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:36,910
莱尼，你好
Hey, Lenny, how you doing?

1210
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,280
这是私人地方，出去！
It's private back here.

1211
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:40,110
我们是认识的
It's okay. We know each other. Right, kid?

1212
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:41,320
你怎么知道我在这里？
How did you know I was here?

1213
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:43,890
你把美洲豹停在前面
Oh, the Jag is out front. You should have put it around back.

1214
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,280
你还在这里做什么？
What are you still doing here?

1215
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:47,180
北方有很多纹身店
There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

1216
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:48,820
我想趁还没忘记
I just wanted to get something down...

1217
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:50,060
纹下来
before it slipped my mind.

1218
01:30:50,330 --> 01:30:51,630
把车匙给我吧，我帮你开走
Then give me the keys. I'll move it for you.

1219
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:53,290
-不要紧
-出去等吧
-It'll be all right for a minute.
-Wait out there.

1220
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:54,860
唉
Oh, for Christ...

1221
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,030
等一等我好吗？
Look, give me a minute. I gotta get something for you.

1222
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:05,100
“事实6：车牌 SG1371U”
Fact six. Car license SG 137IU.

1223
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:13,680
等一等，好不好？
Look. Wait a minute, will ya?

1224
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,520
好，我要送你离开本地
All right, we gotta get you out of here.

1225
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:19,850
为什么？
-Why?
-Aw, man.

1226
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:22,250
多此一问，你要我说多少遍？
Come on, Leonard. How many times I gotta tell you?

1227
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,150
你在这里已经不安全了
It's not safe for you to hang around here anymore.

1228
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:24,960
为什么？
Why not?

1229
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:26,700
警察在找你
Because that cop's looking for you.

1230
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:32,160
我要给你弄个新身份、新衣服
暂时换辆汽车，穿上去！
Now, I gotta get you a new identity, some new clothes. A different car would do for now. So put these on.

1231
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,600
什么警察？
Whoa, whoa. What cop?

1232
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:38,110
一个坏警察，他介绍你住特惠旅馆
He's a bad cop. He's the one who checked you into the Discount Inn.

1233
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:39,400
他找了你已经好几天了
He's been calling you for days,

1234
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:41,770
蒙骗你，把信封塞进你门底下
telling you shit, slipping envelopes under your door.

1235
01:31:41,950 --> 01:31:42,640
你怎知道？
How do you know this?

1236
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,780
他告诉我，以为好笑，他在玩你
He told me. He thinks it's funny. He's been laughing at you.

1237
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:46,640
你胡说
You're full of shit.

1238
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,650
不是，他知道你不爱讲电话…
I'm not. He knows you're no good on the phone, so he's been calling you up.

1239
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,020
所以找上门
Sometimes you don't answer the phone,

1240
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,210
塞信封进你门里，吓到你听电话
so he slips shit under your door to scare you into answering the phone again,

1241
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,360
骗你说约翰・G是毒贩
giving you a line of crap about John G. Being some local drug dealer.

1242
01:31:57,630 --> 01:31:58,600
杰米・格兰斯
Jimmy Grants.

1243
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,630
谁是杰米・格兰斯？
Who's Jimmy Grants?

1244
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,930
杰米是毒贩
Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1245
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,300
警察在调查他
The cop wants to know how his operation's run.

1246
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,600
无论如何，你牵涉进去了
He's got some score in mind. Somehow you're involved.

1247
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:09,300
你怎么认识他的？
How do you know him?

1248
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:12,810
我是线人，他是外地警察
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.

1249
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:14,310
于是走在一起
The local boys put us together.

1250
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,880
假如他知道我帮你，一定会宰了我
If he knew I was helping you, he'd fucking kill me.

1251
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:19,570
换上这些衣服吧
So take these clothes, put them on

1252
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:21,150
然后快点离开本地
and get the fuck out of here.

1253
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:23,180
莱纳，快走吧
Come on, Leonard. Just go.

1254
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,430
“泰迪” “555O134”

1255
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:43,100
“不要受他骗”

1256
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:45,530
你胡说
You are full of shit.

1257
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:50,270
下班后来找娜塔莉娅
"Come by after. Natalie."

1258
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:51,620
费迪斯酒吧
"Ferdy's Bar."

1259
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:26,680
“费迪斯酒吧”

1260
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:35,660
杰米
Hey, Jimmy.

1261
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,960
对不起，我…我认错了人
I'm sorry. I, uh, thought you were somebody else. Sorry.

1262
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:45,640
不要紧
That's okay.

1263
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:56,200
“下班后来找娜塔莉娅”

1264
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:03,050
杰米・格兰斯在女友的酒吧贩毒？
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works?

1265
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,420
他不会带她来，会自己来吧？
But he's not gonna bring her along. He'll come by himself, right?

1266
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:10,230
最好以贩毒罪名指控他
I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.

1267
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:14,890
探长，我随时都准备好
No, officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1268
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:16,830
你来到了旅馆正门？
You're in the lobby?

1269
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:18,630
你是什么样子？
What do you look like?

1270
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,670
我马上出去
I'll be right there.

1271
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:04,850
莱尼
Lenny.

1272
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,180
你是盖玛探长？
Officer Gammell.

1273
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:13,820
对，来吧
Yeah. Come on.

1274
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:31,300
笑一笑
Hey, smile.

1275
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:33,210
不要…不要在这里
Oh, don't... Not here.

1276
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:35,170
这里拍吧
Over here.

1277
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:44,120
是探长还是盖玛探员？
Now, is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?

1278
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,690
这样，不要写姓盖玛，写泰迪好了
You know what? Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1279
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,050
为什么？
Why?

1280
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,320
我正在做卧底
I'm undercover.

1281
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,520
他会经过
This is the directions where he's going.

1282
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:56,590
我的电话在下面
My number's on the bottom if you need me.

1283
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:57,600
你不来？
You're not coming?

1284
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,930
不来，不方便去
No. It wouldn't be appropriate.

1285
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:07,510
拍得不错，拍得我瘦了些
Nice picture. I look thin.

1286
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,210
莱尼
Hey, Lenny.

1287
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:14,490
好好修理他
Make him beg.

1288
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:47,780
泰迪
Teddy!

1289
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:51,680
杰米？
Jimmy.

1290
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:54,710
你在这里做什么？
What the fuck are you doing here?

1291
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,050
你是杰米・格兰斯？
You Jimmy Grants?

1292
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,450
还有另一个杰米？白痴
Expecting any other Jimmys out here, Memory Man?

1293
01:37:58,830 --> 01:37:59,690
你记得我？
Do you remember me?

1294
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,360
我记得你
Yeah, I remember you.

1295
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:03,630
泰迪在哪里？
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1296
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:05,730
怎么样？
Well?

1297
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,060
贱种…你想怎么样？
Motherfuck... What the fuck are you doing?

1298
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:16,170
脱掉
Strip.

1299
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:18,330
你搞错了，大错特错
You're making a big fucking mistake, pal.

1300
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:19,310
脱掉！
Strip!

1301
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:24,040
我的拍档不是善男信女
My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off.

1302
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:25,340
住口
Don't say anything else.

1303
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,850
-早知到那贱种不可靠！
-脱掉
-I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
-Take it off.

1304
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:34,630
裤子也脱掉
Your pants too.

1305
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,860
为什么？
Why?

1306
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,190
我不想沾血
I don't wanna get blood on them.

1307
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,460
等一等，他有没有说我带了什么来？
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1308
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:43,560
脱裤子呀
Take your fuckin' pants off!

1309
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:46,670
我带了20万来！在车里！
I've got two hundred grand stashed in the car!

1310
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:47,940
拿走吧！
Just take it!

1311
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,070
你想讨价还价？
You think you can bargain with me?

1312
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:51,710
-把钱拿走吧！
-我不要你的臭钱！
-Just take the money and walk away!
-I don't want your money!

1313
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:53,480
那么你要什么？
Then what?

1314
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:55,670
你要什么？
What do you want from me?

1315
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:58,240
我要回我的生活！
I want my fuckin' life back!

1316
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,140
“萨米”
Sammy.

1317
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:38,820
他说萨米，他认识萨米？
He said "Sammy." How does he know about Sammy?

1318
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:39,880
糟糕
Oh, fuck.

1319
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:02,230
我做了什么？
What have I done?

1320
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,100
先生，帮帮忙
Hey, mister, I need help.

1321
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:08,970
有人受了重伤，需要看医生
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad. We gotta get him to a doctor.

1322
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:09,910
好
All right.

1323
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:14,610
我是失忆的，我认识你吗？
I don't know what happened. I've got this memory thing. Do I know you?

1324
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:16,250
不认识，我是警察
No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

1325
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:17,910
他还有气吗？
Is he still breathing?

1326
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:19,680
不知道，也许有
I don't know. Maybe.

1327
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:21,830
你们在这里干什么？
What the hell were you guys doing down here?

1328
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:26,030
我不记得，我有病
Well, I don't remember. I have this condition.

1329
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:28,700
他比你惨，他死了
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cause this guy's dead.

1330
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:30,800
哎唷，莱尼！
Ouch! Lenny!

1331
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,300
痛死我了！你现在记得我了？
That shit kills! So you remember me now, huh?

1332
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:35,000
你是个警察
You are a fuckin' cop.

1333
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,070
是我帮你找到他
Yeah. And I'm the guy that helped you find him.

1334
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:39,040
起来！
Get up.

1335
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:40,070
起来！
Get up.

1336
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:42,150
莱尼，你误会了
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1337
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:47,170
他是谁？他认识我
Who is that? He knew me.

1338
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,750
当然，他强奸你老婆，打伤你
Of course he did. He raped your wife. He fucked up your brain.

1339
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:51,250
吹牛！他不是凶手
Bullshit. He's not the guy.

1340
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:54,850
他叫杰米・格兰斯，又名约翰・G
His name is James F. Grants. John G.

1341
01:41:55,130 --> 01:41:56,180
查查你的纹身吧
Check your tattoos.

1342
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:57,660
为什么他带20万来？
What was he bringing the two hundred grand for?

1343
01:41:57,930 --> 01:41:58,590
什么？
What?

1344
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:01,390
用来干什么？
What was it for?

1345
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:03,290
我告诉他我有大批安非他命
A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

1346
01:42:03,570 --> 01:42:06,730
-你们买卖毒品？
-是，还有你的事
-Is this a drug deal?
-No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1347
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:08,530
杰米是你仇家
Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy.

1348
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:10,470
我只是乘机捞油水
I just figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1349
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:14,200
-他怎么认识我的？
-特惠旅馆
-How did he know me?
-The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.

1350
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:17,280
旅馆的人是他朋友
The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came snooping around.

1351
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:18,680
一看你拍照…
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you...

1352
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,120
就通知杰米
taking a picture of the dump.

1353
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:21,010
你在利用我
You're fucking using me.

1354
01:42:21,350 --> 01:42:22,550
不，你分得一半的钱！
No! You get half!

1355
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:25,310
他认识萨米！怎么会认识萨米？
He knew about Sammy! Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1356
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:28,520
你见人就说萨米的事
You tell everybody about Sammy, everybody who'll listen.

1357
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:30,860
“记得杰克斯・萨米吗？”
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1358
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:33,820
你愈说愈精采
Great story. It gets better every time you tell it.

1359
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:39,200
你在自己骗自已
So you lie to yourself to be happy. There's nothing wrong with that. We all do it.

1360
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:42,390
你只记得你想记得的事
Who cares if there's a few little details you'd rather not remember?

1361
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:47,140
-你说什么？
-不知道
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-I don't know.

1362
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,010
你太太事后还活着
Your wife's surviving the assault.

1363
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:52,110
她不相信你有病
Her not believing your condition.

1364
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:56,580
她内心痛苦无比
The torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside.

1365
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,520
胰岛素
The insulin.

1366
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:02,560
那是萨米，不是我
That's Sammy, not me. I told you about Sammy.

1367
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:05,750
对，你不断这样对自己说
Yeah, right. Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1368
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:07,620
用惯性法来帮自己记忆
Conditioning yourself to remember.

1369
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:09,130
用重复又重复的方法来学习
Learning through repetition.

1370
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,960
萨米让太太自杀，萨米进了医院
Sammy let his wife kill herself. Sammy ended up in an institution.

1371
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:15,070
萨米是老千，是假装的
Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1372
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:17,900
我从没说萨米假装
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1373
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:19,970
你暴露出他的真面目
You exposed him for what he was...

1374
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:20,970
他的骗局
a fraud.

1375
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:22,840
不过，我是错的
But I was wrong. That's the whole point.

1376
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:25,810
萨米的妻子来找我
See, Sammy's wife came to me.

1377
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:27,420
萨米没有妻子
Sammy didn't have a wife.

1378
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,350
你的妻子才有糖尿病
It was your wife who had diabetes.

1379
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,030
我太太没有糖尿病
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1380
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:45,800
你肯定？
You sure?

1381
01:43:52,410 --> 01:43:53,040
不要！
Cut it out.

1382
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,300
她没有糖尿病
She wasn't diabetic.

1383
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,940
我难道不清楚我太太？
You think I don't know my own wife?

1384
01:43:57,850 --> 01:43:58,980
你有什么不妥？
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1385
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:02,650
你只记得你想记得的事
Well, I guess I can only make you remember the things you wanna be true.

1386
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:05,150
-就像杰米一样
-他不是我的仇人
-Like old Jimmy down there.
-He's not the right guy.

1387
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:06,290
对你来说，他是
He was to you.

1388
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:10,620
你报了仇，趁记得，好好开心吧
Come on. You got your revenge. Enjoy it while you still remember.

1389
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:13,660
是不是真正的仇人，有什么关系？
What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?

1390
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:15,090
有很大的关系
It makes all the difference.

1391
01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:16,850
-你反正不会记得的
-我会的
-Why? You're never gonna know.
-Yes, I will.

1392
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,230
-你不会
-我会的
-No, you won't.
-I will.

1393
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:20,000
-我总之会的
-你不会记得！
-Somehow I'll know.
-You won't remember!

1394
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:21,470
这次我会
When it's done, I will know. It'll be different.

1395
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:25,230
我本来以为你会，但你记不得
Well, I thought so too. In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

1396
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:29,450
对
That's right.

1397
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:33,680
真正的约翰・G，一年多前…
The real John G. I helped you find him over a year ago.

1398
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:35,110
我帮你找到他，他已经死了
He's already dead.

1399
01:44:35,490 --> 01:44:36,440
不要再骗我
Don't lie to me anymore.

1400
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:38,050
莱尼
Look, Lenny.

1401
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:40,760
你太太的档案是我给你的
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case. I believed you.

1402
01:44:41,130 --> 01:44:43,930
我相信你，认为你应该报仇
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

1403
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,290
我帮你找到另外的凶手
I'm the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night,

1404
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:50,290
那个打你的头，强奸你老婆的人
the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.

1405
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:52,800
我们找到他，你杀了他
We found him. You killed him.

1406
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:56,100
可是你记不得
But you didn't remember.

1407
01:44:57,010 --> 01:44:58,530
于是我帮你…
So I helped you...

1408
01:44:58,810 --> 01:44:59,970
再去找
start looking again,

1409
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,040
找那个你已经杀掉的人
looking for the guy you already killed.

1410
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,440
是吗？那么他是谁？
Oh, yeah. So who was he?

1411
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:07,020
是谁有什么关系？
Just some guy. I mean, does it even matter who?

1412
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,480
两个吸毒的以为你太太独自在家
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy. Just bad fucking luck.

1413
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:16,120
倒霉起来，搞出大件事
Couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1414
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:21,190
你杀了他，我还以为你记得
But when you killed him, I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1415
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,530
不过，你忘掉了
But it didn't stick.

1416
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:27,260
什么都不记得，这次也不会记得
Like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.

1417
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:33,040
照片是我拍的
I took that picture...

1418
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:36,170
在你报仇的时候拍的
just when you did it.

1419
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:39,440
看，你多开心
Look how happy you are.

1420
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:43,180
我想你再开心点
I wanted to see that face again.

1421
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:44,350
多谢啊
Oh, gee, thanks.

1422
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:45,590
你这个混蛋
Fuck you.

1423
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:49,550
你有仇报，生活就有目的
I gave you a reason to live, and you were more than happy to help.

1424
01:45:50,230 --> 01:45:51,960
你记不得真相，你自已…
You don't want the truth...

1425
01:45:52,330 --> 01:45:55,320
制造真相，例如那警察档案
You make up your own truth. Like your police file.

1426
01:45:56,970 --> 01:45:59,930
谁撕掉里面的12页纸？
It was complete when I gave it to you. Who took out the 12 pages?

1427
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:02,740
-可能是你
-不是我，是你
-You, probably.
-No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1428
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:03,600
我为什么撕掉？
Why would I do that?

1429
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,900
为了替自己制造一个解不开的谜
To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1430
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:08,170
你知道有多少个镇吗？
Do you know how many... how many towns?

1431
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:12,940
有多少个约翰・G？我就是个约翰・G
How many John G's orJames G's? I mean, shit, Lenny, I'm a fucking John G.

1432
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:15,950
-你叫泰迪
-我妈妈叫我泰迪
-Your name is Teddy.
-My mother calls me Teddy.

1433
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,710
我的姓名是约翰・盖玛
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1434
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:22,720
你要找，不愁没有约翰・G
Cheer up. There's plenty of John G's for us to find.

1435
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:29,000
你只知道发牢骚
All you do is moan.

1436
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,460
只有我知道你做过什么
I'm the one that has to live with what you've done.

1437
01:46:31,740 --> 01:46:33,230
我在幕后指导
I'm the one that put it all together.

1438
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:35,700
你只是在扮侦探
You, you wander around, you're playing detective.

1439
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:37,970
你活在梦中
You live in a dream, kid.

1440
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:39,700
为亡妻怀念
A dead wife to pine for.

1441
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:41,670
有生活的目的
A sense of purpose to your life.

1442
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:45,710
即使没有我，你也不会罢手
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end even if I wasn't in the picture.

1443
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:47,980
我应该杀你
I should kill you.

1444
01:46:48,590 --> 01:46:49,890
收手吧，莱尼
Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1445
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:51,350
你不是杀手
You're not a killer.

1446
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:53,260
所以你才那么在行
That's why you're so good at it.

1447
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:59,120
来，干什么？知道几点吗？
Come on. What are you doing? You know what time it is?

1448
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,330
喝啤酒去吧，我请客
It's beer o'clock. I'm buying.

1449
01:47:14,810 --> 01:47:15,870
我不是杀手
I'm not a killer.

1450
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,440
我只想补救错误
I'm just someone who wanted to make things right.

1451
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:22,710
“泰迪” “555O134”

1452
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,920
我应不应该忘记你的话？
Can I just let myself forget what you've told me?

1453
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:30,360
“泰迪” “555O134”

1454
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:37,760
“不要受他的骗”

1455
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:48,240
应不应该忘记你让我做的事？
Can I just let myself forget what you made me do?

1456
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,560
你以为我想再去解另一个谜？
You think I just want another puzzle to solve?

1457
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:05,660
“SG1371U”

1458
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:07,400
再去找另一个约翰・G？
Another John G. To look for?

1459
01:48:08,830 --> 01:48:09,990
你也是约翰・G
You're a John G.

1460
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:13,970
你可以做我的约翰・G
So you can be my John G.

1461
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:17,400
“事实6：车牌…”

1462
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:19,200
“SG1371U”

1463
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:22,370
“事实6：车牌…”

1464
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:25,000
我要自欺才能够快乐？
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1465
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:27,440
泰迪，对于你…
In your case, Teddy,

1466
01:48:27,890 --> 01:48:29,080
“SG1371U”

1467
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:30,750
我会
yes, I will.

1468
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,430
嗨，那辆车不是你的！
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

1469
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:47,400
现在是了
It is now.

1470
01:48:47,710 --> 01:48:48,870
你怎么可以开走？
Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1471
01:48:49,210 --> 01:48:49,730
为什么不可以？
Why not?

1472
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,060
因为车主刚被你杀死
Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1473
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:53,510
有人会认得
Somebody'll recognize it!

1474
01:48:55,310 --> 01:48:58,740
被人误当成死人，比误当成杀手好
You know, I think I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

1475
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:01,180
我会用一段时候
I might hang on to this for a while.

1476
01:49:02,990 --> 01:49:05,820
莱尼，不要…
Lenny. Look, don't...

1477
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:07,520
帮我找车钥匙好吗？
Will you help me find the keys?

1478
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:10,250
帮我找车钥匙好吗？
Help me find my keys.

1479
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:11,460
莱尼！
Lenny!

1480
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:19,270
莱尼！
Lenny!

1481
01:49:33,190 --> 01:49:35,570
我要相信世界不是我想象出来的
I have to believe in a world outside my own mind.

1482
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:38,390
我要相信我所做的事仍然有意义
I have to believe that my actions still have meaning,

1483
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,090
即使我记不得做了什么
even if I can't remember them.

1484
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,650
我要相信，即使闭上眼睛…
I have to believe that when my eyes are closed,

1485
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:46,690
世界仍然存在
the world's still here.

1486
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,860
我相不相信世界仍然存在？
Do I believe the world's still here?

1487
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:55,460
世界仍然存在？
Is it still out there?

1488
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:05,380
我们需要记忆去确定自己的身份
We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.

1489
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,290
我并不例外
I'm no different.

1490
01:50:17,930 --> 01:50:19,160
“纹身店”

1491
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:21,920
“事实6：车牌 SG1371U”

1492
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:24,220
我到了哪里？
Now, where was I?

1493
01:50:33,144 --> 01:50:36,203
# We lay in each other's arms #

1494
01:50:38,548 --> 01:50:43,109
# But the room is just an empty space #

1495
01:50:43,185 --> 01:50:46,278
# I guess we lived it out #

1496
01:50:46,355 --> 01:50:49,983
# Something in the air #

1497
01:50:50,058 --> 01:50:55,858
# We smile too fast then can't think of a thing to say #

1498
01:50:57,231 --> 01:51:00,028
# Lived with the best times #

1499
01:51:02,168 --> 01:51:04,397
# Left with the worst #

1500
01:51:07,539 --> 01:51:10,803
# I've danced with you too long #

1501
01:51:13,511 --> 01:51:16,502
# Nothing left to save #

1502
