You kind of learn to trust your own handwriting.

That becomes an important part of your life. You write yourself notes.

And where you put your notes... That also becomes important.

Particular pockets for particular things.

You just kind of learn to know where things go and how the system works.

00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:22,561
I just can't make new memories. So I can't remember talking to you.

160
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:25,104
What did we talk about? Oh, Sammy Jankis.

161
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:27,470
I tell people about Sammy to help them understand.

162
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,806
Sammy's story helps me understand my own situation.

163
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:35,508
Well, Sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.

164
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:40,019
I have a more graceful solution to the memory problem.

165
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:44,790
I'm disciplined and organized.

166
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:47,986
I use habit and routine to make my life possible.

167
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:51,519
Sammy had no drive, no reason to make it work.

168
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:56,467
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.

She will help you out of pity."

- Natalie? - You don't remember me.

174

- I'm sorry. I should have explained. I have this... - You did explain, Lenny.

175
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,153
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.

176
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:52,818
- Yeah, I know. You told me. - Then I probably told you how much I hated it.

00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,827
Yeah.

Do you mind taking your glasses off? It's hard for me to...

00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:02,857
Thanks. So you have information for me?

180
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:05,700
- Is that what your little note says? - Yeah.

181

Must be tough living your life according to a couple of scraps of paper.

182

Mix your laundry list with your grocery list, and you'll end up eating your underwear.

183
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:16,612
I guess that's why you have those freaky tattoos.

184
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:20,847
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

185
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:23,913
Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you. It's nothing personal.

186
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:29,757
I do have information for you.

187
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,628
You gave me a license plate number.

188
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:35,896
Had my friend at D.M.V. Trace it.

189
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:38,938
Guess what name came up.

190
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:42,271
John Edward Gammell. John G.

191
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:44,970
- Do you know him? - No.

192
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:48,139
But his face on his driver's license looked really familiar.

193
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:50,240
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

194
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:53,878
Here's a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all.

195
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:55,888
Are you sure you want this?

196
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:58,220
Have I told you what this man did?

197
00:18:58,292 --> 00:19:01,125
- Yeah. - Then you shouldn't have to ask.

198
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:03,424
But even if you get revenge, you're not gonna remember it.

199
00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:05,590
You're not even gonna know that it happened.

200
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,999
My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make any difference whether I know about it.

201
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:13,870
Just because there are things I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless.

202
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,467
The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?

203
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:21,105
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself,

Why?

207
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:35,156
Because you like to remember her.

208
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:41,592
She was beautiful. To me, she was perfect.

209

No. Don't just recite the words.

210

Close your eyes... and remember her.

211
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:04,316
You can just feel the details.

212
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,058
The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.

213
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:16,560
And you can feel these extreme moments...

214
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:18,570
even if you don't want to.

215
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:24,233
You put these together, and you get the feel of a person.

216
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:30,740
Enough to know how much you miss them...

217
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:38,251
and how much you hate the person who took them away.

218

I, um... I added an address in here.

219
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:54,830
It might be useful. It's an abandoned place outside of town.

[Thinking] "Remember Sammy Jankis."

235
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:21,861
I met Sammy through work. Insurance. I was an investigator.

236
00:22:21,928 --> 00:22:24,658
I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phony.

237
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:26,995
I had to see through people's bullshit.

238
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:29,365
It was useful experience, 'cause now it's my life.

239
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:32,371
When I meet someone, I don't know if I've met them before.

240
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:35,306
I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.

241
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,674
My job taught me the best way to find out what someone knew was just to let them talk...

242
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:41,646
and watch the eyes and the body language.

243
00:22:41,715 --> 00:22:44,809
If someone scratches their nose while they're talking, experts tell you it means they're lying.

244
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:48,377
It really means they're nervous. People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.

Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.

261
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:49,846
- Why not? - Because your notes could be unreliable.

262
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,009
- Memory's unreliable. - Oh, please!

263
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:55,020
No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good.

264
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:58,023
Ask the police. Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

265
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:01,151
- Cops don't catch a killer by remembering stuff. - Right...

266
00:24:01,227 --> 00:24:04,390
They collect facts, they make notes, and they draw conclusions.

267
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:08,230
Facts, not memories. That's how you investigate. It's what I used to do.

268
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:12,499
Look, memory can change the shape of a room. It can change the color of a car.

269
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:14,665
And memories can be distorted.

270
00:24:14,741 --> 00:24:16,936
They're just an interpretation. They're not a record.

271
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,069
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

He killed my wife. He took away my fucking memory.

He destroyed my ability to live.

- But then I rented you another room on top of it. - Why?

291
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:58,641
Business is slow. I mean, I told my boss about the...

292
00:25:58,712 --> 00:26:01,738
your condition and stuff, and he said try and rent him another room.

Just two, so far.

Well, at least you're being honest about ripping me off.

296
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:13,121
Well, you're not gonna remember anyway.

297

You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

Mr. Samuel R. Jankis. Strangest case ever.

Now, the guy's a 58-year-old semiretired accountant.

307
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:57,636
He and his wife had been in this car accident. Nothing too serious.

308
00:26:57,704 --> 00:27:00,867
But he's acting funny. He can't get a handle on what's going on.

309

The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus.

Nothing conclusive, but Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.

His wife calls the insurance company, and I get sent in.

313
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:20,989
Now, this is my first big claims investigation, so I really check into it.

314
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,824
- Can I get you some coffee? - Sammy can think just fine,

315
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:26,297
but he can't make any new memories.

316
00:27:26,366 --> 00:27:28,994
- He can only remember things for a couple of minutes. - This is Mr. Shelby.

317
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:32,333
He'd watch TV, but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing.

318
00:27:32,405 --> 00:27:35,101
He couldn't remember how it began. He liked commercials.

319
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,938
- They were short. - Sammy.

320
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,944
It's time for my shot.

321
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:41,071
The crazy part was that this guy...

322
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:44,674
who couldn't even follow the plot of Green Acres anymore...

323
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:47,845
could do the most complicated things...

324
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:51,584
as long as he learned them before the accident...

325
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:53,922
and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.

326
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:57,827
- Be gentle. - Now, the doctors assure me...

327
00:27:57,897 --> 00:28:01,924
there's a real condition called anterial-grade memory loss, or short-term memory loss.

328
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:04,265
It's rare, but legit.

329
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:08,735
Every time I see him...

330
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:11,276
I catch this look,

331
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:14,438
this slight look of recognition.

332
00:28:14,514 --> 00:28:16,846
But he says he can't remember me at all.

333
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:19,942
Sammy, it's okay. I got it. I got it.

334
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:22,487
- Hi, Mr. Shelby. - Hi, Mrs. Jankis.

335
00:28:22,555 --> 00:28:27,151
- Now, I can read people, and I'm thinking: Bad actor. - This is Mr. Shelby, Sammy.

336
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:30,128
So now I'm suspicious, and I order more tests.

337
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:36,530
[Thinking] Awake.

338
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:39,401
Oh, where am I?

339
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:44,035
Somebody's bedroom.

340
00:28:45,745 --> 00:28:48,213
Ah, it must be her room.

341
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:50,806
But who is she?

342
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:56,950
[Moaning]

343
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:01,026
It's only me.

344
00:29:03,296 --> 00:29:06,265
- Did you sleep okay? - Yeah. You?

345
00:29:06,332 --> 00:29:11,736
Yeah. Oh, shit. Shit! I got to be someplace.

346
00:29:15,608 --> 00:29:19,704
- It's pretty weird. - It's useful.

347
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:22,373
You never write a phone number on your hand?

348
00:29:22,448 --> 00:29:27,784
I, um... I should be able to talk to my friend today about the license plate.

349
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:32,291
- Yeah, the license plate. - John G.'s license plate.

350

You have it tattooed on your thigh.

[Footsteps]

Mm, if it's registered in this state,

357
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:13,861
it should only take a couple of seconds to pull up his license and registration.

358
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:16,424
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

Do you think we could just arrange a meeting now? I'm not too good on the phone.

You know, it's great that you...

361
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,687
well, that you're helping me like this.

362
00:30:35,755 --> 00:30:39,247
I'm helping you because you helped me.

363
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:55,273
So next time you see me, will you remember me?

364
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:14,816
[Whispering] I think you will.

365
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:17,727
I'm sorry.

366
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:23,662
Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?

367
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:36,943
[Engine Starts]

368
00:31:38,985 --> 00:31:42,921
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.

369
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:45,958
Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.

370
00:31:46,025 --> 00:31:49,791
But I find something in my research: Conditioning.

371
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:52,990
Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.

372
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:55,967
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike. You just get better through practice.

373
00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:59,004
It's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory.

374
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:02,667
So I had the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning.

375
00:32:02,742 --> 00:32:06,644
- Just pick up any three objects. - That's a test?

376
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:09,340
Hey, where were you guys when I did my C.P. A?

377
00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:11,542
[Laughs] Sorry.

- [Object Buzzes] - Ow! What the fuck?

380
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:21,188
- It's a test, Sammy. - Well, test this, you fucking quack.

381
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,161
[Leonard] Some of the objects were electrified.

382
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,131
They'd give him a small shock. They kept repeating the test,

383
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,361
always with the same objects electrified.

384
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:32,666
The point was to see if Sammy could learn to avoid the electrified objects...

385
00:32:32,738 --> 00:32:35,002
not by memory, but by instinct.

- Who is he? - Calm down. Okay?

00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:16,170
This is my problem. It has nothing to do with your investigation.

393
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:19,912
- How did you get me into this? - You offered to help when you saw what he did to my face.

394
00:33:19,986 --> 00:33:23,786
- How do I know he did that? - Because I came straight to you after he did it.

395
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:27,792
- I showed you what he did, and I asked you to help me. - And I just take your word?

00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,591
- Yeah. - Something doesn't feel right.

You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here...

because she's gone to the bathroom or something.

But somehow I just...

442
00:36:44,824 --> 00:36:48,123
I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.

443

If I could just reach over...

and touch her side of the bed...

But I can't.

I know I can't have her back.

But I don't want to wake up in the morning thinking she's still here.

00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:25,662
I lie here not knowing how long I've been alone.

00:37:31,937 --> 00:37:34,167
So how...

451
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,504
How can I heal?

00:37:38,978 --> 00:37:44,041
How am I supposed to heal if I can't... feel time?

They kept testing Sammy for months,

456
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:32,443
always with the same objects carrying an electrical charge.

457
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:34,614
- [Object Buzzes] - Ow! What the fuck?

458
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,124
- It's a test, Sammy. - Test this, you quack!

459
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:39,889
Even with total short-term memory loss,

460
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:42,726
Sammy should have learned to instinctively stop picking up the wrong objects.

461
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:46,859
All the previous cases responded to conditioning. Sammy didn't respond at all.

462
00:39:46,936 --> 00:39:50,531
It was enough to suggest that his condition was psychological, not physical.

463
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:54,975
We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

464
00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:58,980
His wife got stuck with the bills, and I got a big promotion.

465
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:03,246
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless.

466
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:07,380
But it works for me. I live the way Sammy couldn't.

467
00:40:07,456 --> 00:40:10,220
Habit and routine make my life possible.

468
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:13,227
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle. Hang on a sec?

Now, the police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house.

632
00:57:03,517 --> 00:57:05,610
The car was stolen. Bloody prints were all over it.

I got friends in the department. They gave me a copy of it.

With my condition, it's really tough. I can't keep it all in mind at once.

I have to summarize the different sections. And there's pages missing.

But they weren't even looking for John G.

The stuff they found in the car just fit in with what they believed had happened,

00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,572
so they didn't chase any of it up.

There's something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn't ring true for me.

653
00:59:35,269 --> 00:59:37,260

Yeah, yeah. I guess.

I went to Dodd...

He didn't believe me.

He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

And then he just... he just started hitting me.

You know what one of the causes of short-term memory loss is? Venereal disease.

Come on. Find a pen. Write this note. Write down what happened.

I'm not too good on the phone. I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them.

You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife?

Oh, well, that depends on if he's here in town or if he's moved on.

I have my file here.

Can I ask you something? If you have all of that information,

920
01:18:30,604 --> 01:18:34,233
then why haven't the police found him for you?

- Well, they're not looking for him. - Why not?

922
01:18:36,877 --> 01:18:41,837
They don't think he exists. You see, I told them what I remembered.

01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:43,850
I was asleep.

I remember. It's about the last thing that I do remember.

Look, the police did not believe me. If we check the police...

01:33:39,346 --> 01:33:42,713
I'm sorry. I, uh, thought you were somebody else.

1087
01:33:42,782 --> 01:33:44,716
Sorry.

1088
01:33:44,784 --> 01:33:46,843
That's okay.

1089
01:34:00,166 --> 01:34:05,001
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works?

1090
01:34:05,071 --> 01:34:08,598
But he's not gonna bring her along. He'll come by himself, right?

1091
01:34:08,675 --> 01:34:12,873
I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.

1092
01:34:12,946 --> 01:34:16,541
No, officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1093
01:34:16,616 --> 01:34:19,380
You're in the lobby? What do you look like?

1094
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:22,622
I'll be right there.

1095
01:35:04,731 --> 01:35:06,665
Lenny.

1096
01:35:08,968 --> 01:35:11,300
Officer Gammell.

1097
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:15,235
Yeah. Come on.

1098
01:35:31,091 --> 01:35:36,552
- Hey, smile. - Oh, don't... Not here. Over here.

1099
01:35:42,502 --> 01:35:45,528
- Now, is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell? - You know what?

1100
01:35:45,605 --> 01:35:48,039
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1101
01:35:48,108 --> 01:35:50,542
- Why? - I'm undercover.

1102
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:55,814
This is the directions where he's going.

1103
01:35:55,882 --> 01:35:58,908
- My number's on the bottom if you need me. - You're not coming?

1104
01:35:58,985 --> 01:36:00,919
No. It wouldn't be appropriate.

1105
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:09,224
Nice picture. I look thin.

1106
01:36:11,765 --> 01:36:15,667
Hey, Lenny. Make him beg.

1107
01:37:20,733 --> 01:37:24,829
[Vehicle Approaching]

1108
01:37:38,017 --> 01:37:39,951
[Man] Teddy!

1109
01:37:42,422 --> 01:37:44,617
Hey, Teddy!

1110
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:49,357
Teddy!

1111
01:37:51,664 --> 01:37:53,598
Jimmy.

1112
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:55,657
What the fuck are you doing here?

1113
01:37:55,735 --> 01:37:59,296
- You Jimmy Grants? - Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man?

1114
01:37:59,372 --> 01:38:03,638
- Do you remember me? - Yeah, I remember you.

1115
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:06,508
Where the fuck's Teddy? Well?

1116
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:13,814
Motherfuck... What the fuck are you doing?

1117
01:38:15,955 --> 01:38:19,015
- Strip. - You're making a big fucking mistake, pal.

1118
01:38:19,092 --> 01:38:22,061
Strip!

1119
01:38:22,128 --> 01:38:26,155
- My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off. - Don't say anything else.

1120
01:38:26,232 --> 01:38:29,224
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck! - Take it off.

1121
01:38:33,473 --> 01:38:37,807
- Your pants too. - Why?

1122
01:38:37,877 --> 01:38:40,209
I don't wanna get blood on them.

1123
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:43,306
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1124
01:38:43,383 --> 01:38:47,319
- Take your fuckin' pants off! - I've got two hundred grand stashed in the car!

1125
01:38:47,387 --> 01:38:50,083
- Just take it! - You think you can bargain with me?

1126
01:38:50,156 --> 01:38:52,522
- Just take the money and walk away! - I don't want your money!

1127
01:38:52,592 --> 01:38:55,026
Then what?

1128
01:38:55,094 --> 01:38:58,393
- What do you want from me? - I want my fuckin' life back!

1129
01:40:29,856 --> 01:40:31,824
Sammy.

1130
01:40:37,864 --> 01:40:39,923
[Thinking] He said "Sammy." How does he know about Sammy?

1131
01:40:39,999 --> 01:40:41,864
Oh, fuck.

1132
01:41:01,954 --> 01:41:05,219
[Thinking] What have I done?

1133
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:08,556
Hey, mister, I need help. There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.

1134
01:41:08,628 --> 01:41:11,461
- We gotta get him to a doctor. - All right.

1135
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:14,633
I don't know what happened.

1136
01:41:14,701 --> 01:41:18,034
- I've got this memory thing. Do I know you? - No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

1137
01:41:18,104 --> 01:41:21,403
- Is he still breathing? - I don't know. Maybe.

1138
01:41:21,474 --> 01:41:23,499
What the hell were you guys doing down here?

1139
01:41:23,576 --> 01:41:26,511
Well, I don't remember. I have this condition.

1140
01:41:26,579 --> 01:41:29,980
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cause this guy's dead.

1141
01:41:30,049 --> 01:41:33,075
Ouch! Lenny! That shit kills!

1142
01:41:33,152 --> 01:41:36,212
- So you remember me now, huh? - You are a fuckin' cop.

1143
01:41:36,289 --> 01:41:38,655
Yeah. And I'm the guy that helped you find him.

1144
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:40,693
Get up. Get up.

1145
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:43,228
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1146
01:41:45,932 --> 01:41:47,957
Who is that? He knew me.

1147
01:41:48,034 --> 01:41:50,696
Of course he did. He raped your wife. He fucked up your brain.

1148
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:52,795
Bullshit. He's not the guy.

1149
01:41:52,872 --> 01:41:57,241
His name is James F. Grants. John G. Check your tattoos.

1150
01:41:57,310 --> 01:42:00,746
- What was he bringing the two hundred grand for? - What?

1151
01:42:00,813 --> 01:42:04,112
- What was it for? - A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

1152
01:42:04,183 --> 01:42:07,914
- Is this a drug deal? - No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1153
01:42:07,987 --> 01:42:09,921
Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy.

1154
01:42:09,989 --> 01:42:12,457
- I just figured we'd make a few dollars on the side. - How did he know me?

1155
01:42:12,525 --> 01:42:15,085
The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.

1156
01:42:15,161 --> 01:42:18,460
The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came snooping around.

1157
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:20,590
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture of the dump.

1158
01:42:20,666 --> 01:42:23,567
- You're fucking using me. - No! You get half!

1159
01:42:23,636 --> 01:42:26,264
He knew about Sammy! Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1160
01:42:26,339 --> 01:42:29,740
You tell everybody about Sammy, everybody who'll listen.

1161
01:42:29,809 --> 01:42:31,936
"Remember Sammy Jankis?" "Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1162
01:42:32,011 --> 01:42:34,946
Great story. It gets better every time you tell it.

1163
01:42:35,014 --> 01:42:37,812
So you lie to yourself to be happy.

1164
01:42:37,884 --> 01:42:39,943
There's nothing wrong with that. We all do it.

1165
01:42:40,019 --> 01:42:43,147
Who cares if there's a few little details you'd rather not remember?

1166
01:42:45,591 --> 01:42:47,957
- What the fuck are you talking about? - I don't know.

1167
01:42:48,027 --> 01:42:51,394
Your wife's surviving the assault.

1168
01:42:51,464 --> 01:42:55,400
Her not believing your condition. The torment and pain and anguish...

1169
01:42:55,468 --> 01:42:58,130
tearing her up inside.

1170
01:42:58,204 --> 01:43:00,729
The insulin.

1171
01:43:00,807 --> 01:43:03,503
That's Sammy, not me. I told you about Sammy.

1172
01:43:03,576 --> 01:43:06,602
Yeah, right. Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1173
01:43:06,679 --> 01:43:08,670
Conditioning yourself to remember.

1174
01:43:08,748 --> 01:43:11,342
- Learning through repetition. - Sammy let his wife kill herself.

1175
01:43:11,417 --> 01:43:16,480
- Sammy ended up in an institution. - Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1176
01:43:16,556 --> 01:43:18,751
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1177
01:43:18,825 --> 01:43:21,988
You exposed him for what he was... a fraud.

1178
01:43:22,061 --> 01:43:24,928
But I was wrong. That's the whole point.

1179
01:43:24,997 --> 01:43:28,262
- See, Sammy's wife came to me. - Sammy didn't have a wife.

1180
01:43:31,003 --> 01:43:34,166
It was your wife who had diabetes.

1181
01:43:39,712 --> 01:43:42,306
Ouch.

1182
01:43:42,381 --> 01:43:45,009
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1183
01:43:45,084 --> 01:43:47,018
You sure?

1184
01:43:52,225 --> 01:43:55,991
- Ouch. Cut it out. - She wasn't diabetic.

1185
01:43:56,062 --> 01:44:00,158
You think I don't know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong with you?

1186
01:44:00,233 --> 01:44:03,669
Well, I guess I can only make you remember the things you wanna be true.

1187
01:44:03,736 --> 01:44:06,136
- Like old Jimmy down there. - He's not the right guy.

1188
01:44:06,205 --> 01:44:08,366
He was to you.

1189
01:44:08,441 --> 01:44:10,875
Come on. You got your revenge. Enjoy it while you still remember.

1190
01:44:10,943 --> 01:44:14,470
What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?

1191
01:44:14,547 --> 01:44:16,674
- It makes all the difference. - Why? You're never gonna know.

1192
01:44:16,749 --> 01:44:20,082
- Yes, I will. I will. - No, you won't. - Somehow I'll know.

1193
01:44:20,152 --> 01:44:22,586
- You won't remember! - When it's done, I will know. It'll be different.

1194
01:44:22,655 --> 01:44:25,749
Well, I thought so too. In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

1195
01:44:28,394 --> 01:44:32,626
That's right. The real John G.

1196
01:44:32,698 --> 01:44:35,963
I helped you find him over a year ago. He's already dead.

1197
01:44:36,035 --> 01:44:39,835
- Don't lie to me anymore. - Look, Lenny.

1198
01:44:39,906 --> 01:44:42,773
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case. I believed you.

1199
01:44:42,842 --> 01:44:45,402
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

1200
01:44:45,478 --> 01:44:48,470
I'm the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night,

1201
01:44:48,547 --> 01:44:51,209
the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.

1202
01:44:51,284 --> 01:44:53,718
We found him. You killed him.

1203
01:44:55,421 --> 01:45:00,757
But you didn't remember. So I helped you start looking again,

1204
01:45:00,826 --> 01:45:03,056
looking for the guy you already killed.

1205
01:45:03,129 --> 01:45:05,393
Oh, yeah. So who was he?

1206
01:45:05,464 --> 01:45:07,864
Just some guy. I mean, does it even matter who?

1207
01:45:07,934 --> 01:45:12,462
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy. Just bad fucking luck.

1208
01:45:12,538 --> 01:45:17,771
Couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1209
01:45:17,843 --> 01:45:22,906
But when you killed him, I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1210
01:45:22,982 --> 01:45:25,450
But it didn't stick.

1211
01:45:25,518 --> 01:45:27,748
Like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.

1212
01:45:32,458 --> 01:45:36,326
I took that picture... just when you did it.

1213
01:45:39,065 --> 01:45:41,499
Look how happy you are.

1214
01:45:41,567 --> 01:45:44,092
I wanted to see that face again.

1215
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:46,968
- Oh, gee, thanks. - Fuck you.

1216
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:50,805
I gave you a reason to live, and you were more than happy to help.

1217
01:45:50,876 --> 01:45:55,074
You don't want the truth. You make up your own truth.

1218
01:45:55,147 --> 01:45:57,081
Like your police file.

1219
01:45:57,149 --> 01:46:00,482
It was complete when I gave it to you. Who took out the 12 pages?

1220
01:46:00,553 --> 01:46:03,579
- You, probably. - No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1221
01:46:03,656 --> 01:46:06,181
- Why would I do that? - To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1222
01:46:06,258 --> 01:46:09,352
Do you know how many... how many towns?

1223
01:46:09,428 --> 01:46:11,623
How many John G's or James G's?

1224
01:46:11,697 --> 01:46:13,756
I mean, shit, Lenny, I'm a fucking John G.

1225
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:17,098
- Your name is Teddy. - My mother calls me Teddy.

1226
01:46:17,169 --> 01:46:19,160
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1227
01:46:19,238 --> 01:46:21,172
Cheer up.

1228
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,004
There's plenty of John G's for us to find.

1229
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:29,974
All you do is moan.

1230
01:46:30,049 --> 01:46:32,017
I'm the one that has to live with what you've done.

1231
01:46:32,084 --> 01:46:34,018
I'm the one that put it all together.

1232
01:46:34,086 --> 01:46:38,785
You, you wander around, you're playing detective. You live in a dream, kid.

1233
01:46:38,858 --> 01:46:41,850
A dead wife to pine for. A sense of purpose to your life.

1234
01:46:41,927 --> 01:46:46,364
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end even if I wasn't in the picture.

1235
01:46:47,633 --> 01:46:50,830
- I should kill you. - Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1236
01:46:50,903 --> 01:46:54,805
You're not a killer. That's why you're so good at it.

1237
01:46:57,076 --> 01:47:00,204
Come on. What are you doing? You know what time it is?

1238
01:47:00,279 --> 01:47:02,372
It's beer o'clock. I'm buying.

1239
01:47:04,383 --> 01:47:06,317
Fuck.

1240
01:47:15,594 --> 01:47:17,926
[Thinking] I'm not a killer.

1241
01:47:17,997 --> 01:47:21,489
I'm just someone who wanted to make things right.

1242
01:47:26,405 --> 01:47:29,738
Can I just let myself forget what you've told me?

1243
01:47:46,192 --> 01:47:49,593
Can I just let myself forget what you made me do?

1244
01:48:03,843 --> 01:48:05,606
You think I just want another puzzle to solve?

1245
01:48:05,678 --> 01:48:08,579
Another John G. To look for?

1246
01:48:08,647 --> 01:48:10,945
You're a John G.

1247
01:48:13,385 --> 01:48:15,478
So you can be my John G.

1248
01:48:23,462 --> 01:48:26,727
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1249
01:48:26,799 --> 01:48:30,166
In your case, Teddy,

1250
01:48:30,236 --> 01:48:32,898
yes, I will.

1251
01:48:44,383 --> 01:48:46,908
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

1252
01:48:46,986 --> 01:48:50,080
- It is now. - Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1253
01:48:50,156 --> 01:48:52,488
- Why not? - Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1254
01:48:52,558 --> 01:48:55,493
Somebody'll recognize it!

1255
01:48:55,561 --> 01:49:00,294
You know, I think I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

1256
01:49:00,366 --> 01:49:03,631
I might hang on to this for a while.

1257
01:49:03,702 --> 01:49:08,196
- Lenny. Look, don't... - Will you help me find the keys?

1258
01:49:08,274 --> 01:49:11,300
Help me find my keys.

1259
01:49:11,377 --> 01:49:13,311
Lenny!

1260
01:49:33,632 --> 01:49:36,931
[Thinking] I have to believe in a world outside my own mind.

1261
01:49:37,002 --> 01:49:39,197
I have to believe that my actions still have meaning,

1262
01:49:39,271 --> 01:49:42,240
even if I can't remember them.

1263
01:49:42,308 --> 01:49:45,744
I have to believe that when my eyes are closed,

1264
01:49:45,811 --> 01:49:48,245
the world's still here.

1265
01:49:49,448 --> 01:49:51,848
Do I believe the world's still here?

1266
01:49:54,787 --> 01:49:57,347
Is it still out there?

1267
01:49:59,458 --> 01:50:01,221
Yeah.

1268
01:50:03,596 --> 01:50:06,360
We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.

1269
01:50:08,734 --> 01:50:10,429
I'm no different.

1270
01:50:22,982 --> 01:50:24,711
Now, where was I?

1271
01:50:25,818 --> 01:50:33,850
[Skipped item nr. 383]

1272
01:50:33,926 --> 01:50:36,986
We lay in each other's arms

1273
01:50:39,331 --> 01:50:43,893
But the room is just an empty space

1274
01:50:43,969 --> 01:50:47,063
I guess we lived it out

1275
01:50:47,139 --> 01:50:50,768
Something in the air

1276
01:50:50,843 --> 01:50:56,645
We smile too fast then can't think of a thing to say

1277
01:50:58,017 --> 01:51:00,815
Lived with the best times

1278
01:51:02,955 --> 01:51:05,185
Left with the worst

1279
01:51:08,327 --> 01:51:11,592
I've danced with you too long

1280
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:17,292
Nothing left to save

1281
01:51:17,369 --> 01:51:23,205
There's something in the air

1282
01:51:23,275 --> 01:51:27,302
Something in my eye

1283
01:51:27,379 --> 01:51:35,047
I've danced with you too long, yeah

1284
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:39,489
Something in the air

1285
01:51:39,558 --> 01:51:45,190
Something in my eye

1286
01:51:55,641 --> 01:51:58,075
Abracadoo

1287
01:51:58,143 --> 01:52:00,338
I lose you

1288
01:52:02,014 --> 01:52:04,949
We can't avoid the clash

1289
01:52:05,017 --> 01:52:07,178
The big mistake

1290
01:52:08,787 --> 01:52:11,415
Now we're gonna pay and pay

1291
01:52:13,092 --> 01:52:18,894
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you

1292
01:52:20,065 --> 01:52:23,159
Lived all our best times

1293
01:52:25,637 --> 01:52:28,037
Left with the worst

1294
01:52:30,776 --> 01:52:34,576
I've danced with you too long

1295
01:52:36,982 --> 01:52:39,610
Say what you will

1296
01:52:39,685 --> 01:52:47,456
But there's something in the air

1297
01:52:47,526 --> 01:52:50,086
Something in my eye

1298
01:52:50,162 --> 01:52:57,193
I've danced with you too long

1299
01:52:57,269 --> 01:53:01,797
There's something I have to say

1300
01:53:01,874 --> 01:53:06,368
There's something in the air

1301
01:53:06,445 --> 01:53:11,473
Danced with you too long
