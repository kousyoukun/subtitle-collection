5
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:34,612
Flu, Professor.
流感,教授

6
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:40,542
Medical men aren't immune. He asked me to look after his appointments.
医生也不能幸免,你知道。他让我负责他的门诊预约

7
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:46,710
I'm only checking your glasses. You look as though I want to drill your teeth.

8
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:48,964
Do sit down, Professor.
哦,务必要坐下来,教授

9
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:55,636
Ragheeb. That doesn't sound English. Are you English, Professor Ragheeb?
拉吉卜,那听起来不像英语。你是英国人吗,拉吉卜教授？

00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,349
- Why do you ask?   - Oh, small talk, merely small talk.
- 为什么,你为什么这么问？  - 哦,闲聊,闲聊而已

11
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:02,349
The weather's too dull and politics too explosive.
天气太乏味,而政治太容易引起争论

12
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:05,522
I certainly didn't mean to pry.
我当然不是故意要去打听

13
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:09,269
- May I see your glasses?   - I can't see anything without them.
- 我能看看你的眼镜吗？  - 没有它们我什么也看不见

14
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:14,699
- Yes. Yes, indeed.   - Please.
- 是的。是的,的确如此  - 行了吧

15
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,703
- Have you been exposed to flu recently?   - Does that weaken the eyes?
- 你最近接触到流感了吗？  - 那会使视力下降吗？

16
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,911
No, merely the eye doctors.
不会,仅仅是眼科医生

There's so much close personal contact in our line, we can't be too careful.

- “M.”不“N.”  - 非常好

- Why?   - To dilate the pupil.
- 为什么？  - 扩张瞳孔

30
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,355
It's quite all right, Professor. You won't feel anything.
真的没事,教授。你不会有任何感觉

31
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,783
- There. That didn't hurt, did it?   - No, it was...
- 那,那以前不疼,是吧？  - 是的,以前不...

32
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,907
Here on the final slide

33
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,785
is an example of a more cursive form of hieroglyphs,
是象形文字中更近于草书的一个范例

大概来自于伟大的法老拉美西斯二世统治时期

00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:33,005
Now we can still recognize what many of the signs represent.
现在我们仍然可以认出这里的许多标志代表什么

36
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:36,834
Here, for example, is the word for "heart",

written simply with the picture of the heart.

But here, above the monster Amensit,

39

who, as you can see, is part crocodile, part lion and part hippo,
一个坐着的人,正如你能看到的那个人,一部分是鳄鱼

40
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,433
and who waits to devour the heart of the dead man
一部分是狮子,一部分是河马,他正在等待吞噬死者的心

41
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,442
is the glyph for a house.
这是一个代表房子的雕文

42
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,946
Below it is a mouth. These signs have phonetic value only.
在它下面是一张嘴。这些符号只代表音值

43
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,613
They are followed by a drawing of a pair of legs,
跟在后面的是一双腿的绘图

44
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:03,531
which, in this case, has no phonetic value.
在这种情况下,它没有音值

45
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:08,622
As an ideogram, it does give us the clue to the meaning of the word

46
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,708

49
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,883
I seem to have been talking in your sleep.
我似乎一直在与你梦中交谈

50
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:30,135
That will be all for today. Professor Ragheeb will be back tomorrow.
今天就这些。拉吉卜教授明天会回来

51
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,313
Good morning.

52
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,517
May I have a word, Professor Pollock?

53
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:37,570
If it's about that outstanding bill at the bookstore,
如果是关于那张在书店未付钱的账单,

54

there's a simple explanation: poverty.
有一个简单的解释：贫困

没有什么能像现在来一次绑架更会使血液保持循环了

accept his offer and see what I can find out?

But you must not accept until you know all the possibilities.

拜士拉维先生不尊重任何人的生命,除了他自己的

如果你愿意,我会停下车,然后放你出去,不会再说一句话

to uncovering the past.

involved himself in the future for a change.

哈桑不会伤害你,波洛克先生,只要你不去尝试把它和它的主人分开

125
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,562
He is excessively loyal.
它极其忠诚

126
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,910
You keep him well fed, I trust.
我相信你把它喂得很好

127
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,955
Of course. Nobody's that loyal.
当然。没有人如此忠诚

128
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:42,449
I won't presume upon your time, Professor.
我不会滥用你的时间,教授

129
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,788
I know how valuable it must be.
我知道它一定很宝贵

130
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,461
What do you make of that?
你是怎么理解的？

131
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:52,626
It's a copy of a Hittite inscription.
这是一份希泰语题词的副本

132
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,968
Second millennium BC, I would guess.
我猜是在公元前两千年

133
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,886
Take a date, Mr. Pollock, as a gesture of friendship.
尝一尝,波洛克先生,为了表示友谊

134
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,556
I'm a very Arabian Arab, I'm afraid.
我恐怕是一个地道的阿拉伯人

135
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:04,938
Friends?
是朋友吗？

136
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:09,017
Flesh, Mr. Pollock. Hassan eats only flesh.
肉,波洛克先生。哈桑只吃肉

137
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:12,902
- I thought he looked at it wistfully.   - It must have been your fingers.
- 我以为它在若有所思地看着它  - 那一定是你的手指,教授

138
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:17,236
I want to know what that inscription means.
我想知道那些题词是什么意思

139
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:19,991
I want to know that very much.
我非常想知道

140
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,282
May I ask an indelicate question?
我能问一个无礼的问题吗？

141
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,789
- How much?   - $25,000.
- 多少钱？  - 两万五千美元

142
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,082
Very well. I won't quibble, $30,000.
好吧。我不会斤斤计较,三万美元

143
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:31,836
You go right ahead and quibble.
你可以随便斤斤计较

144
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,376
How did you happen to get hold of it?
你怎么得到它的

145
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:37,596
Let us say, I happened upon it by chance.
可以这样说,我偶然发现它的

146
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,681
Oh.
哦

147
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:44,471
Well, may the... gods continue to smile on you.
好吧,祝愿...上帝继续对你微笑

148
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:47,262
Thank you, Professor. I value your good wishes.
谢谢你,教授。我珍视你的美好祝愿

149
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:49,891
But I won't keep you from your work any longer.
但我不想再耽误你的工作了

150
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:52,946
If you haven't finished by 8:00 tonight, you'll be...
如果你今晚八点还没完成,你会...

151
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:55,195
- Tonight?   - That is correct.
- 今晚？  - 没错

152
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:59,536
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt your threat.
对不起。我不是有意打断你的恐吓

153
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:03,695
- If I'm not finished by 8:00...   - Then you'll be my guest for dinner.

154
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,374
I see.
我明白了

155
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,793
If I should happen to run just a smidge over?
如果我只弄懂了一点点的内容大意

156
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:15,336
You'll find this house a comfortable place to work in, Mr. Pollock,
你会发现这栋房子是一个舒适的工作场所,波洛克先生

157
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:17,380
however long it takes you.

00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,340
What are you doing?
你在干什么？

162
00:13:57,553 --> 00:14:01,551
Oh, these English crosswords are devilish, don't you think?
哦,这些英文字谜是可怕的,你不觉得吗？

163
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:05,051
- You're an American.   - Yes, sir. Indeedy-do, ma'am.
- 你是美国人  - 是的,先生。当然是,夫人

164
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:07,013
I don't meet many Americans.
我没见过很多美国人

165
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,097
Actually, I don't meet many people who are dressed like that either.

Would you do me up, please?

168
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:30,283
- Oh.   - Can you manage?
- 哦  - 你能行吗？

169
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:35,295
Well, I... I always tremble when I'm happy.
好吧,我...我高兴的时候总是发抖

170
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:40,633
- I take it you're a houseguest here.   - Why do you take that?
- 我猜你是这里的客人  - 你为什么这么认为？

171
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:44,630
One doesn't usually arrive for high tea dressed in a nighty.
没有人会穿着睡衣来喝傍晚茶

172
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,634
One also isn't a houseguest in one's own house.
没有人是自己的房子的客人

173
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:53,433
Oh, it's your house. I got the impression it was Mr. Beshraavi's house.
哦,这是你的房子。我得到的印象是这是拜士拉维先生的房子

174
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,647
Nejim gives that impression with everything he borrows,
纳吉姆给人的印象是他什么都借

175
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:02,490
but I assure you it is my house, and he's the guest.
但我向你保证,这是我的房子,并且他是客人

176
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,778
Would you care to stay for dinner?
你愿意留下吃晚饭吗？

177
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,575
I'm afraid that our street urchin has already invited me.
恐怕我们的街头顽童已经邀请我了

178
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,950
How bothersome.
多令人讨厌

179
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:16,505
You are working on the cipher, aren't you?
你在为密文而工作,是不是？

180
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:20,334
Let's not talk about work. Let's talk about you.
我们不要谈工作。我们来谈谈你

181
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,174
Listen, I don't know what Nejim has told you...
听着,我不知道纳吉姆告诉你什么了

182
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:27,932
There you are, Yasmin. I hardly expected to find you here.
你在这,亚丝明。我没想到会在这找到你

183
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:31,014
- In her own house?   - In the library.
- 你是说在她自己的房子吗？  - 在书房

184
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,358
Yasmin has so many talents, she has practically no time for reading.
亚丝明这么有天赋,她几乎没有时间阅读

185
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:39,731
I'm sorry to tell you this, my dear, but Mr. Pollock is as poor as a church mouse.
我很抱歉不得不告诉你,我亲爱的。但波洛克先生穷得像教堂里的老鼠

186
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:44,194
- Will you come and change for dinner?   - Excuse me.
- 你愿意来换件衣服去吃晚饭吗？  - 失陪了

187
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,577
Those slippers are absolutely beautiful, my darling.
这双拖鞋真漂亮,我亲爱的

188
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:50,410
- Are you wearing them for my benefit?   - Of course.
- 你是为我穿的吗？  - 当然,纳吉姆

189
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:54,040
Mr. Pollock does not have your exotic refinements.
波洛克先生没有你这种奇异的风雅

190
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,503
- He prefers nighties.   - She said it, I didn't.
- 他更喜欢睡衣  - 她说的,我没说

191
00:15:57,715 --> 00:16:03,136
Mr. Pollock, some Bedouins are in the habit of saying to their guests,
波洛克先生,有些流浪者习惯对他们的客人说

192
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:05,385
"All that I possess is yours".
“我所拥有的都是你的”

193
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,171
I am not one of them.
我不是其中之一

194
00:16:11,145 --> 00:16:13,683
Delicious, Beshraavi. What is it, squab?
美味可口,拜士维拉。这是什么,乳鸽吗？

195
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:18,441
- Lark.   - Lark? Good heavens.
- 云雀  - 云雀？天啊

196
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:21,322
They've been soaked in honey for eight days.
他们整整在蜂蜜里浸泡了八天

197
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,362
What about you, Mr. Pollock? Or is the prospect too exotic?
你呢,波洛克先生？还是景象过于奇异了

198
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:28,661
I trust you'll notify my next of kin.
好吧,我信任你会通知我的至亲

199
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:33,364
Go on, Mr. Pollock. Courage.
来吧,波洛克先生。胆量

200
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:35,873
Oh, I am sorry.
哦,对不起

201
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:39,337
That's all right. I've always had a sweet tooth.
哦,没事。我一贯喜欢甜食

202
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:45,469
I hate being clumsy. I despise it.
我讨厌笨手笨脚的。我鄙视它

203
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,719
But you never are, my dear.
但你从来也不笨拙。我亲爱的

204
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:50,601
This is the first time I've seen you be so gauche.
这是我第一次看到你如此笨拙

205
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:01,562
You've dropped something, Mr. Pollock.
你东西掉了,波洛克先生

206
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:07,575
Well... so I have at that.
好吧... 是我那时掉的

207
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:10,410
What do you suppose it is?
你觉得那是什么？

208
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:16,418
It looks like a little piece of folded paper, doesn't it?
这看起来像一小片折叠的纸,不是吗？

209
00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:20,834
Let's see if there's anything written on it.
我们看看上面有没有写什么

210
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:23,504
Was that you? I'm terribly sorry.
哦,叉到你了吗？我非常抱歉

211
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:26,754
Let's see if there's anything written on it.
我们看看上面有没有写什么

212
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,886
There is something written on it.
上面写着一些东西

213
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:35,719
Don't keep it a secret. What is it?
不要保守秘密,波洛克先生。写的什么？

214
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,561
It's a prescription.
这是一个药方

215
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,851
I suffer from indigestion.
哦,我消化不良

216
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:45,069
All those dry books I try to digest.
就像去消化那些枯燥无味的书

217
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:49,613
Perhaps we can have it made up at the chemist just around the corner.
也许我们可以带你去附近药店调理。是不是,我亲爱的

218
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:52,662
- Don't bother.   - No bother. One of the servants...
- 没事,不用麻烦了  - 不麻烦。我会叫一个仆人

219
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,624
It would be for them. It's absolutely unnecessary.
很麻烦他们,这绝对没有必要

220
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,036
I think I'd better be getting back to work.
好吧。我想我得回去工作了

221
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:06,219
The dinner was delicious, and... that was quite a lark.
晚餐很可口,而且...十分令人开心

222
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:10,511
Well...
好吧...

223
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:17,519
He certainly was strange, even for an American.
他确实很奇怪,即使是美国人

224
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:23,440
I'm sure you and Mr. Beauchamp have business to discuss,
我敢肯定你和比彻姆先生有事要讨论

225
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:27,520
so I'll develop a splitting headache before your talk gives me one.
那会使我头疼欲裂,我就先行告辞了

226
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,907
- Good night, Mr. Beauchamp.   - Good night, Miss Azir.
- 晚安,比彻姆先生  - 晚安,阿兹尔小姐

227
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:33,788
When are you going to let me show you around my bank?

228
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:36,950
The moment I find myself in need of refinancing.

229
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,909
You, I'll see later, no doubt.
我们想必要待会儿见

230
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:46,338
Beauchamp, you've been oozing good fellowship all evening.
好吧,比彻姆。你整晚都洋溢着良好的伙伴关系

231
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:48,958
When a banker oozes, someone's in trouble.
当银行家充分表露时,有人会有麻烦

232
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:51,052
Let us have your bad news.

233
00:18:53,683 --> 00:18:56,637
I was too discreet to mention it in front of your guests,

234
00:18:56,852 --> 00:19:00,268
but do you know what they've been saying about you on the exchange?
但你知道他们对你的交易说些什么吗？

235
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:02,937
Your brokers gossip like Arab women at the well.
你经纪人的绯闻就像井里阿拉伯妇女

236
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,602
They say when Prime Minister Jena arrives the day after tomorrow,

237
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:08,897
he will sign the treaty.

作为承诺,你的国家要使用英国和美国的油轮

他们说你的船可以安闲地休憩

241

- 他们就是这么说的？  - 好吧,如果他们继续那么说,老伙计

242
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,088
in a week your shares will be down ten points.
截至本周你的股票会下跌十点

Don't worry. There will be no treaty signed, old boy.
别担心。将不会签署任何条约,老伙计

244
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:37,846
I happen to have in my employ a most dependable soothsayer.
我恰巧雇用了一位最可靠的预言家

245
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:50,507
Psst. In here.
嘘,在这

246
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:59,631
Now then, Miss Azir, I wonder if you'd tell me what this is all about.
那么,阿兹尔小姐,我想你能否告诉我这是怎么回事

247
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,062
Call me Yasmin. At least while you're in my bathroom.
叫我亚丝明。至少当你在我的浴室时

248
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:10,435
Now then, Yasmin, I wonder if you would tell me what is going on?
那么,亚丝明,我想你能否告诉我发生什么事了？

249
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:13,358
Professor Ragheeb didn't fall out of any window.
拉吉卜教授没有从任何窗户坠落

250
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,242
They murdered him!
他们谋杀了他！

251
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,324
Beshraavi?
拜士拉维吗？

252
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:20,778
I doubt if it was him personally.
我怀疑是不是他亲自干的

253
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:24,531
- How do you know?   - What difference does it make?
- 你怎么知道？  - 有什么不同吗？

254
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,451
They killed him, and they'll kill you too. You'd better keep out of this.
他们杀了他,而且他们也会杀了你。你最好别介入此事

255
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:33,424
Me? Why should Beshraavi have anything against me?
我？为什么拜士拉维要对付我？

256
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:36,042
He needs me to decipher the inscription.
它需要我破译题词

257
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:39,962
- And when you've done it?   - Good point.
- 你完成之后呢？  - 问得好

258
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:43,931
The message is too important for anyone he doesn't own to know about it.
那消息除了他自己任何人知道都不行

259
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:46,184
What about you?
你呢？

260
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:52,020
Lock, stock and barrel?
毫无顾忌吗？

261
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,196
This is ridiculous.
这太荒谬了

262
00:21:57,408 --> 00:22:00,742
We're in England, a civilized country, in the middle of London.
我们在英国,文明的国家,就在伦敦的中部

263
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:03,990
Over there is Regent's Park. There's the zoo.
那边是摄政公园,那边是动物园

264
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:08,418
Over in Buckingham Palace, the Queen is probably playing Scrabble.
在白金汉宫,女王可能在玩拼字游戏

265
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,501
He can't own anyone here.
他不能主宰这里的任何人

266
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:13,548
Everyone has his price.
每个人都有自己的价值

267
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:15,797
How much, Mr. Pollock?
什么价钱,波洛克先生？

268
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,212
$30,000.
三万美元

269
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:23,805
I did not settle so cheaply.
我算的可没这么便宜

270
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:28,641
Why should you care what happens to me?
你为什么要关心发生在我身上的事？

271
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:31,430
I care about all things that live, Professor.
我关心所有生物,教授

272
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:35,565
$30,000 in exchange for your old age is a very bad bargain.
用三万美元交换你这把年纪是一笔赔本的买卖

273
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,856
Do you know...
你知道吗...

274
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:44,028
- Who is it?   - Yasmin, why have you locked the door?
- 是谁？  - 亚丝明,你为什么把门锁上

275
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,793
Yasmin? Can you hear me?
亚丝明？你听得见吗？

276
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,079
I was about to take a shower, darling.
我正在洗澡,亲爱的

277
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:57,129
You know how I despise locked doors.
你知道我多么鄙视上锁的门

278
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,549
Forgive me, Nejim.
原谅我,纳吉姆

279
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:05,430
People who lock doors generally have things to hide.
通常锁门的人有事情要隐瞒

280
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:07,968
Would you care to search me?
你要不要来搜搜我？

281
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,725
Would I find your thoughts?

282
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:14,644
Well?
好吃吗？

283
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,526
Darling, don't ask me to speak with my mouth full.
亲爱的,别让我满嘴食物地说话

284
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:20,898
You know, at dinner, just for a moment,
你知道吗,吃晚餐时,就在那一刻

285
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:25,197
I thought you deliberately knocked over the plate and gave a note to Mr. Pollock.
我以为你故意打翻了盘子,然后给了波洛克先生一张便条

286
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:28,616
Imagine. That really is extraordinary.
想象,那真是非同寻常

287
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:32,877
- Jealous? You?   - I'm jealous of your thoughts, Yasmin.
- 妒忌吗？你？  - 我妒忌你的思想,亚丝明

288
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:37,464
I'm jealous of everything I can't see or hear. Your shower's still running.
我妒忌一切我看不到和听不到的。你的淋浴器还在开着

289
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:43,169
- I'll turn it off.   - No, take your shower.
- 我去关掉它  - 不,去洗你的澡

290
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:46,425
Maybe I won't tonight. I'm so sleepy.
也许我今晚不会洗了。我很想睡觉

291
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:50,307
In that case, please do. I want you wide awake.
那样的话,请去洗吧。我想让你完全清醒

292
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,784
There now. Wasn't I right? Isn't that refreshing?
好了,我说得对吗？那是不是很提神？

293
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,039
You might say that.
你可以这么说

294
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:17,464
- You feel wide awake now?   - Yes... but I wish I weren't.
- 你现在觉得完全清醒了吗？  - 是的...但我希望我没有

295
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:21,338
You sound very tense, my love. Turn around.
你听起来很紧张,我的宝贝。转过身

296
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:23,509
Let the water run down your back.
让水从你的背部流下

297
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:27,137
- It soothes the nerves.   - I don't think it would.
- 舒缓神经  - 我不认为会

298
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:32,392
- Nejim?   - Yes?
- 纳吉姆？  - 怎么了？

299
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:35,274
Why is Mr. Pollock working on that inscription?
为什么波洛克先生要着手题词的工作？

300
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,974
It's a business matter. It would only bore you.
这是一个商业问题,我的宝贝。这只会让你厌烦

301
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:45,856
- What was that?   - I dropped the soap.
- 那是什么？  - 我把肥皂弄掉了

302
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:50,240
- Should I pick it up?   - Oh, no, no, I... I'll manage.
- 你想让我帮你捡起来吗？  - 哦,不,不,我...我能行

303
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:55,288
Somehow.
想个办法

304
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:03,086
- Have you got it?   - Yes, darling. It's all right.
- 你捡到了吗？  - 是的,亲爱的。没事了

305
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:08,841
Extraordinary sensation. Perhaps it was the way he looked at you.
非凡的感觉。也许这是他看你的样子

306
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:10,967
- Who?   - Pollock.

307
00:25:11,185 --> 00:25:14,886
Darling, if you start getting jealous over everyone who looks at me,
亲爱的,如果谁看我都会使你开始妒忌

308
00:25:15,106 --> 00:25:17,811
it will do terrible things to your blood pressure.
那对你的血压是可怕的事情

309
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:21,608
I don't think you have to worry about college professors.
但我认为你不必为大学教授担心

310
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:24,857
- Why not?   - They're only interested in work.
- 为什么不必？  - 他们只对工作感兴趣

311
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:30,661
They're the most dangerous kind, my love. They're such expert peekers.
他们是最危险的一类,我的宝贝。他们是窥视专家

312
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:36,114
Don't worry. If I were standing stark naked in front of Mr. Pollock,
别担心。如果我赤身裸体地站在波洛克先生的面前,

313
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,209
he'd probably yawn.
他也许会打哈欠

314
00:25:39,964 --> 00:25:42,253
I think it's time I dried you.
我想是时候让我来给你擦干了

315

Excuse me, Yasmin. The phone.

I hope it's written with waterproof ink.
好吧,我希望是用防水墨写的

Must you mismanage everything?

I don't know where Mr. Pollock is either.

I was wondering what they were up to.
我想知道他们想干什么

我得说他们对你有些恼火,亲爱的。因为他们把密文借给了你

- 那么优素福现在得到密文了吧？  - 你怎么会这么想？

00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:53,208
Over there, I think. Come on.
我想在那边,走吧

626
00:54:56,387 --> 00:54:58,296
Must have had pups during the night.
夜间一定有劣货交易

627
00:54:59,307 --> 00:55:03,351
I'll know it when I see it. He dented it last week.
我看见了就会知道。他上周把它撞瘪了

628
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:06,681
How? Knocking down an old lady at a crossing?
怎么弄的？在路口撞倒了老太太吗？

629
00:55:06,898 --> 00:55:08,855
There it is.
它在那

630
00:55:13,821 --> 00:55:15,695
Hey, hey.
嗨,嗨

631
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:21,073
- It's still there.   - I don't see anything.
- 它还在那  - 我什么也没看到

632
00:55:21,287 --> 00:55:23,860
The candy! You are brilliant!
糖果！你真聪明

633
00:55:24,081 --> 00:55:27,082
The result of a clean mind and a healthy body.

634

Yussef.

635
00:55:48,689 --> 00:55:51,939
I've checked all the morning papers. There's not a word.
我查看了所有的报纸,只字未提

636
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:55,567
- Do you think he's still alive?   - Stop bugging me. How would I know?
- 你认为他还活着吗？  - 别烦我。我怎么知道？

637
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,689
Have you heard from the girl?
有那姑娘的消息吗？她找到了吗？

638
00:55:57,907 --> 00:56:01,110
She'll give me a blast when she knows something.
她一有消息就会提供给我

639
00:56:08,417 --> 00:56:12,547
Oh, no, he's taking it. Why couldn't he be on a diet?
哦,不,他要把它带走。他为什么不节食呢？

640
00:56:12,647 --> 00:56:14,083
What do you know?
你知道什么？

641
00:56:23,683 --> 00:56:26,518

- 三十五。它是哪个？  - 九号

642
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:29,931
- You were actually telling the truth.   - What do you mean?
- 你说的是实话  - 你在说什么？

643
00:56:30,147 --> 00:56:32,603
Yussef was here. I was here. The cipher was here.
优素福在这,我在这,密文在这

644
00:56:32,817 --> 00:56:35,438
All you had to do was yell, but you didn't.
你所要做的就是呼喊,可是你没有

645
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:38,820
That absurd story about your mother and sisters must be true.
那个关于你母亲和姐妹的荒唐的故事一定是真的

646
00:56:39,031 --> 00:56:41,320
- You mean you didn't believe me?   - Not a word.
- 你是说你不相信我吗？  - 我只字未提

647
00:56:41,534 --> 00:56:44,737
- Then why did you come with me?   - I didn't know where the van was.
- 那你为什么跟我来？  - 因为我不知道货车在哪

648
00:56:44,954 --> 00:56:46,993
Miss Azir, I humbly apologize.
阿兹尔小姐,我深表歉意

649
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:51,952
I don't accept. The least you can do when I tell you something is believe it.
我不接受。至少你要做到当我告诉你一些事情时,你要相信它

650
00:56:52,169 --> 00:56:53,913
With your track record?

651
00:56:56,615 --> 00:56:58,755
Let's go. Be ready to duck.

652
00:57:03,347 --> 00:57:07,262
- Fourteen.   - I only hope his sweet tooth holds up.
- 十四  - 我只希望他不再喜爱甜食

653
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,578
We're victims of the Establishment.
我们是当权派的受害者

654
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:33,335
Ask him to move.
为什么不让他走开

655
00:57:33,544 --> 00:57:36,331
It's no use. They can't move, speak or even listen.
没有用。他们不能动,不能说话,甚至不能听

656
00:57:36,547 --> 00:57:38,456
If they do, they're beheaded.
如果他们这样做,他们会被斩首

657
00:57:38,674 --> 00:57:40,916
Oh, nonsense. He's a man, isn't he?
哦,胡说。他是个男人,不是吗？

658
00:57:43,846 --> 00:57:47,595
- Excuse me, soldier.   - He's a guardsman.

I know you're on duty, but...

00:58:08,871 --> 00:58:13,829
There is something under your foot that belongs to us.

663
00:58:14,043 --> 00:58:15,952

664
00:58:17,713 --> 00:58:19,587
Please.
拜托了

665

David, make him lift his foot!

667
00:58:38,192 --> 00:58:40,481
You've been learning from Nejim.
你在向纳吉姆学习

668
00:58:42,613 --> 00:58:46,314
Fifty-two! You'd think after all that...

669
00:58:59,088 --> 00:59:01,875
Oh, no. He's found it.
哦,不。他发现它了

670
00:59:02,091 --> 00:59:04,000
Sink, sank, sunk.
糟糕,坏了,惨了

671
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:20,267
- He must be calling Yussef.   - I don't think so.
- 他一定是给优素福打电话  - 哦,我不这么想

672
00:59:20,484 --> 00:59:22,524
He knows Yussef's number.
他知道优素福的电话号码

673
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,597
Keep an eye on Webster.
盯住韦伯斯特

674
01:00:00,816 --> 01:00:02,275
Look here.
看这

01:00:03,277 --> 01:00:06,693
Webster sold out to Nejim.
韦伯斯特卖给了纳吉姆

676
01:00:06,906 --> 01:00:09,658
Seems to be a popular indoor sport these days.

677
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:11,990
You're not including me, I hope.
我希望你说的不包括我

678
01:00:12,203 --> 01:00:14,492
Of course not. We're believing you today.
当然不。我们今天相信你

679
01:00:15,164 --> 01:00:18,996
- 3:30, but it doesn't say where.   - It doesn't have to.
- 三点半,但没说在哪  - 没必要说

680
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:24,287
If he's meeting Nejim at 3:30, there's only one place it can be.
如果他在三点半见纳吉姆,只能有一个地方

681
01:00:24,674 --> 01:00:28,339
In the fifth race the runners are as follows...

I must go and advise my horse.

- 你来吗,我的宝贝？  - 你去吧,我亲爱的

684
01:00:36,811 --> 01:00:38,803
I think I'll put some money on her.
我想我要在它身上赌一些钱

685
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:41,595
What an excellent idea. But only to win, of course.
真是个好主意。当然只有赢了

686
01:00:41,816 --> 01:00:45,267
It would be a grave mistake to back another horse at this late stage.
这将是一个严重错误,如果在这最后关头去支持别的马

687
01:01:09,844 --> 01:01:12,417
Well, if it isn't Mr. Dillingham.
嗨,这不是迪林厄姆先生吗

688
01:01:12,638 --> 01:01:17,466
By Jove, it's actually Lady Hetherington-Cartwright.
天啊,那实际上是赫瑟林顿·卡特赖特夫人

689
01:01:17,685 --> 01:01:20,556
- Don't overdo it.   - I didn't know you could.
- 别做得太过火  - 我不知道你可以

690
01:01:20,771 --> 01:01:22,396
I haven't seen Webster.
我还没见过韦伯斯特

He's handing the inscription to Sloane at 3:30 by the winning post.
三点半通过终点时他会给斯隆密文

692
01:01:26,444 --> 01:01:29,231

- 一定要做个好人,迪林沃思先生  - 哈姆

693
01:01:29,447 --> 01:01:33,741
Dillingham. Tell me what you fancy for this race.
啊,迪林哈姆。告诉我你对这场比赛的关注点在哪

694
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:37,285
I'm putting my jolly old shirt on number nine.
好吧,我把我的老本都押在了九号

695
01:01:37,496 --> 01:01:40,865
Keep your eyes on the winning post. You'll have to get it somehow.
请你盯住终点。你必须设法得到它

- 然后呢？  - 我们午夜在特拉法尔加广场见面

697
01:01:44,629 --> 01:01:49,421
It's been positively smash to have bumped into you this way, old thing.
那样与你见面将会大功告成,老朋友

698
01:01:49,634 --> 01:01:54,177
Do give my regards to your husband next visiting day.
下个参观日务必代我向你的丈夫问候

699
01:01:54,388 --> 01:01:56,428
- Ta-ta.   - Toodle-oo.
- 回头见  - 再见

700
01:02:30,716 --> 01:02:32,590
What odds did you get?
你有几层胜算？

701
01:02:39,475 --> 01:02:40,804
Two to one.
二比一

01:02:42,853 --> 01:02:44,893
They're off.
他们出发了

703
01:03:11,215 --> 01:03:13,587
It's Pollock.
那是波洛克

704
01:03:27,857 --> 01:03:30,395
Who is that?
那是谁？

705
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:36,364
They're turning into the stretch. Three furlongs left to race, and it's...
他们拉开了距离。比赛还剩下六百六十码

706
01:03:38,951 --> 01:03:42,451
That bungling idiot, Sloane.
那个笨拙的傻瓜,斯隆

707
01:04:07,688 --> 01:04:10,179
Darling, we won!
亲爱的,我们赢了！

708
01:05:28,769 --> 01:05:31,058
- Hello?   - Prime Minister Jena, please.
- 你好  - 请找耶拿首相

709
01:05:31,272 --> 01:05:33,311
It's very urgent. This is Mr. Pollock.

Mr. Pollock, what has happened?

Mr. Jena, there's been some trouble.
耶拿先生,有一些麻烦

- 今天有一个人在阿斯科特被杀了  - 是的,我听说了

714
01:05:46,537 --> 01:05:49,242
Have you also heard who it is they think killed him?
你也听说他们觉得把谁杀了吗？

715
01:05:49,457 --> 01:05:53,039
Mrs. Pollock's idiot son, David, that's who. I need your help.
波洛克太太的白痴儿子,戴维。就是他,我需要你的帮助

716
01:05:53,252 --> 01:05:56,502
I don't think there's anything I can do for you right now,
我不认为现在有什么我能为你做的

717
01:05:56,714 --> 01:05:59,549
besides suggesting that you stay clear of the police.
除了那个建议,你要和警察划清界限

718
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:02,713
Mr. Prime Minister, I don't think I've made myself clear.
首相先生,我不认为现在我自己弄清楚了

719
01:06:02,929 --> 01:06:04,589
Right now I'm wanted for murder.
我被通缉犯有谋杀罪

720
01:06:04,805 --> 01:06:07,842
You're the only one who can explain what I've been doing.
你是唯一可以解释我在做什么的人

721
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:11,641
But, Mr. Pollock, I thought I'd made myself clear.
但是。波洛克先生,我想我明白了

722
01:06:11,854 --> 01:06:14,974
For security reasons, I have never seen you.
出于安全原因,我从来没去见你

723
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:17,480
I am not even in England.

724
01:06:17,693 --> 01:06:22,486
Whatever the circumstances, we must disclaim any knowledge of you.
不管什么情况,我和我的大使馆必须否认和你认识

725
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:26,651
Where are you? Have you the message?
你在哪？你得到信息了吗？

726
01:06:28,579 --> 01:06:30,987
If the message is not deciphered soon, then...
如果我们不能快点把信息破译,那么...

727
01:06:35,211 --> 01:06:37,583
Come here, my darling.
过来,我亲爱的

728

729
01:06:46,264 --> 01:06:48,090
More shoes?

730
01:06:48,307 --> 01:06:50,798
But, darling, you've already given me dozens.
但是,亲爱的,你已经给了我几十双

731
01:06:51,018 --> 01:06:53,058
I couldn't resist these.
我无法抗拒这些

732
01:06:53,896 --> 01:06:58,724
Quite a coincidence, Mr. Pollock turning up at the right place and right time.
真是太巧合了,波洛克先生出现在正确的地点和时间

733
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:02,193
- Don't you think so?   - I would hardly call it a coincidence.
- 你不这么认为吗？  - 我很难称它为巧合

734
01:07:02,405 --> 01:07:07,031
Neither would I. How do you account for it, my flower?
我也不会。你怎么解释它,我的花朵？

735
01:07:07,243 --> 01:07:12,035
He must have been following Yussef's man, the one who was killed.
他肯定在跟踪优素福的人,被杀的那个人

736
01:07:12,248 --> 01:07:15,581
- Do you think so?   - It's the only explanation.
- 你这样认为吗？  - 这是唯一的解释

737
01:07:15,793 --> 01:07:18,035
You wouldn't have mentioned it, of course.
你当然没提到这件事

738
01:07:18,254 --> 01:07:20,709
I?
我吗？

739
01:07:21,757 --> 01:07:24,331
Those are rather attractive, don't you think?
那些相当性感,你不觉得吗？

740
01:07:24,552 --> 01:07:26,591
Exquisite.
精挑细选的

741
01:07:27,847 --> 01:07:32,094
I really must thank whoever was responsible for getting him there.
我真要感谢负责让他到那的人

742
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:35,928
- Then you wanted him to have it?   - Certainly.
- 那么你想让他得到它？  - 当然

743
01:07:36,147 --> 01:07:38,389
Who else is going to decipher it?
还有谁能破译它？

744
01:07:38,608 --> 01:07:40,933
I want you to find him again,
我想让你再找到他

745
01:07:41,152 --> 01:07:44,770
I want you to stay with him until he finishes his work,
我要你和他呆在一起,直到他完成他的工作

746
01:07:44,989 --> 01:07:48,239
and then I want you to bring the answers to me.
然后我想让你把答案给我

747
01:07:48,451 --> 01:07:53,492
- Is that clear, my angel?   - Very clear.
- 清楚了吗,我的天使？  - 非常清楚

748
01:07:54,999 --> 01:07:58,083
I know that I can trust you to do that for me.
我知道我能相信你会为我这么做

749
01:07:58,294 --> 01:08:01,627
Unless, of course, you're growing weary of my little gifts.
除非是你厌倦了我的小礼物

750
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:06,916

I don't know. I've never seen it.
我不知道。我从来没见过它

How will you be able to work on it?

I won't have to. I know what's in it.

- 女灶神？那是什么意思？  - 我怎么知道？

My job was to translate it into English.
我的工作是把它翻译成英语,我没有得到结果

814
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,135
Well, I suppose it will mean something to somebody.
好吧,我猜这对某人意味着什么

815
01:13:02,348 --> 01:13:05,966
I'll call the embassy and tell them, but I'd better drop you off first.
我会打电话给大使馆告诉他们,但我最好先让你下车

让你在街上不安全。如果警察拦住我们怎么办？

好吧,戴维。我要找个电话亭

哦,别告诉我大使馆会在这个时候和你谈话

- 为什么？  - 哦,请不要问这么多问题

戴维,我没骗你。我得弄清楚这个信息的意思

You told her you and I were working together?

No wonder what?

860
01:19:41,914 --> 01:19:44,405
She'd say anything to keep you from trusting me.
她说这些只是不想让你信任我

861
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:48,623
She's an agent of Yussef's, like her husband. Don't you see what you did?
她像她丈夫一样,是优素福的特工。你不明白你干了什么吗？

862
01:19:48,838 --> 01:19:51,708
The moment you let her know I was double-crossing them,

she called Yussef to warn him.

所以他引诱我到施工现场,要杀了我

865
01:20:03,853 --> 01:20:07,851
What is there about you that makes you so hard to believe?
你有种什么样的特质使你很难被相信？

866
01:20:10,067 --> 01:20:13,851
Perhaps it's because I'm such a terrible liar.
也许因为我是一个糟糕的骗子

867
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:16,693
But never with you, of course.

I wish I could say the same.
我希望我也能这样说

"The plague shall not pass until the swans fly high in the kingdom of Vesta."
“瘟疫是不会过去的,除非天鹅翱翔在女灶神的王国”

870
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,283
You made it up?
那是你瞎编的吗？

871

- What's the real message?   - I haven't worked it out yet.
- 那真正的信息是什么？  - 我还没把它想出来

872
01:20:31,714 --> 01:20:35,213
We'll have to do something. I packed a suitcase. It's in the back.
好吧,我们得做点什么。我收拾好了行李,它在后面

01:20:40,264 --> 01:20:42,173
Haven't you any ideas?
你没有什么主意吗？

875

你是通过学士学位要求的头号人物。你早上很可爱

I was dreaming of someone much more romantic. You.

No, come back here. I have something else.

I've cracked the cipher.

David, that's wonderful. What does it mean?
戴维,那真是太好了。它的意思是什么？

888
01:21:47,081 --> 01:21:49,406

这是赝品,百分之百赝品

889
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:53,575
It isn't Hittite. It's an ordinary, common-or-garden grade-school code.
这根本不是希泰语。这是一个普通的,常见的学校密码

You mean it's dirty?

No, a three-year-old child could understand.

Female bird: goose. Female bird: goose. Male bird: gander.

just for a lousy nursery rhyme.

908
01:22:52,688 --> 01:22:55,144
She couldn't have. She would have told Yussef.
但她不可能有。他肯定会告诉优素福的

909
01:22:55,358 --> 01:22:57,267
That's right too.

信息的副本豪无意义,翻译豪无意义

914
01:23:17,838 --> 01:23:20,543
The message is a screen. It's a doodle.
信息是表面,它是一个掩蔽,它是一个涂鸦

All that matters is the original piece of paper.

- 原件？  - 当然。不是那个密文

917
01:23:27,848 --> 01:23:33,969
It's something else on that paper. Something underneath the cipher.
是那张纸上的一些其他东西。密文下面的一些东西

918

928
01:24:19,817 --> 01:24:24,111
- Weren't you ever in the Boy Scouts?   - I flunked the physical.
- 你没参加过童子军吗？  - 我物理考试不及格

929
01:24:24,322 --> 01:24:27,441
You should have tried my troop. We'd have waived it.

The eye. The eye of the third bird.

A microdot.

938
01:25:08,199 --> 01:25:10,654

- 她真是一个美女,不是吗？  - 她当然是

Certainly, sir.

To paraphrase Marie Antoinette:
用玛丽·安托瓦内特的话来说：

I can hardly say of my people, "Let them drink oil."
我真不知怎么向我的人民交待,“让他们喝石油”

01:30:28,519 --> 01:30:30,761
Come on.
快走

999
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:34,515
They did it. After all that, they did it. We just stood there.
他们做到了。毕竟,他们做到了。我们只是站在那

1000
01:30:36,986 --> 01:30:40,604
- Where are we going?   - We have to find Jena.
- 我们去哪？  - 我们必须找到耶拿

1001
01:30:40,823 --> 01:30:43,610
- Did I understand you to say...   - That wasn't Jena.
- 我理解你是说...  - 快点,那不是耶拿

1002
01:30:43,826 --> 01:30:46,613
- It sounded like you said...   - I tell you, it wasn't!
- 这听起来像你说的...  - 我告诉你,那不是

1003
01:30:46,829 --> 01:30:49,616
It looked very much like him, but it wasn't Jena.
那看起来像他,很像他,但那不是耶拿

1004
01:30:49,832 --> 01:30:51,825
It was Hassan Jena. I know him.
那是哈桑·耶拿。我认识他

1005
01:30:52,043 --> 01:30:53,834
- Oh!   - He knows me.
- 哦！  - 他认识我

1006
01:30:54,045 --> 01:30:56,536
I've spoken to him many times. He came to Oxford.
我和他谈过很多次。他来牛津看过我

1007
01:30:56,756 --> 01:30:59,211
Jena's never set foot in England before today.
在今天之前,耶拿从来没踏足过英国

1008
01:30:59,425 --> 01:31:01,667
He wanted people to think that. He was here.
他希望人们那样认为。但他在这

1009
01:31:01,886 --> 01:31:04,840
He's the one who sent me to Beshraavi in the first place.
是他当初派我来拜士拉维这的

1010
01:31:05,056 --> 01:31:07,725
That man? The one who was shot?
那个人？那个被枪杀的人吗？

1011
01:31:07,934 --> 01:31:09,642
Yes. Now do you believe me?
是的。现在你相信我了吗？

1012
01:31:09,852 --> 01:31:13,351
- Why didn't you tell me?   - I never knew who you were.
- 为什么你没告诉我？  - 因为我从来不知道你是谁

1013
01:31:13,564 --> 01:31:15,687
That's why he looked so frightened.
那就是为什么他看上去很害怕

1014
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,976
Nejim hired him to impersonate Jena,
纳吉姆雇用他冒充耶拿

1015
01:31:18,194 --> 01:31:21,942
only he neglected to mention that part of his job was to be murdered.
只是他有意地没有提到他的一部分工作就是被人谋杀

1016
01:31:22,156 --> 01:31:24,694
We have to find the real Jena. Come on.
我们必须找到真正的耶拿,快点

1017
01:31:28,704 --> 01:31:31,374
You expect me to believe that nonsense?
你指望我相信那些废话吗？

1018
01:31:31,582 --> 01:31:35,165
- What proof do you have?   - He didn't recognize me.
- 你有什么证据？  - 他没认出我

1019
01:31:35,378 --> 01:31:38,794
But... Wait... Why should he recognize you?
可是...等等...他为什么要认出你？

1020
01:31:40,925 --> 01:31:43,760
Yasmin, are you trying to tell me something?
亚丝明,你是想告诉我什么吗？

1021
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:45,594
I am a spy.
我是间谍

1022
01:31:51,602 --> 01:31:54,176
Hey. Wait!
嗨,等等！

1023
01:31:56,774 --> 01:32:00,392
- Can you prove that statement?   - Do you think we carry calling cards?
- 我猜你能证明那种说法？  - 你认为我们带名片吗？

1024
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:04,858
- Then why didn't you tell me?   - You wouldn't have believed me.
- 哦,那你为什么不告诉我？  - 你不会相信我

1025
01:32:09,954 --> 01:32:13,738
- Where are we going?   - I want to see where it happened.
- 我们去哪？  - 我想看看在哪发生的

1026
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:15,997
Where what happened?
在哪,发生了什么？

1027
01:32:18,504 --> 01:32:21,209
Did you record the Prime Minister's arrival on tape?
你记录首相到达时的录像了吗？

1028
01:32:21,424 --> 01:32:22,622
- Yes.   - Run it for me.
- 是的  - 放给我看

1029
01:32:22,842 --> 01:32:25,084
The Prime Minister's life may depend on it.
首相的性命也许要取决于它

1030
01:32:25,303 --> 01:32:28,921
- You're a bit late. He's been shot.   - Do as I say.
- 你有点晚了,他已经被枪杀了  - 照我说的做

1031
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:31,678
- Is that tape ready to roll yet?   - It's all set.
- 那盘磁带准备好了吗？  - 都准备好了

1032
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:34,181
Put it up on the monitors.
把它从显示器里放出来

1033
01:32:37,648 --> 01:32:40,318
- Which one is that?   - The real one. It has to be.
- 哪一个是？  - 真正的一个,那个必须是

1034
01:32:40,526 --> 01:32:43,610
There was no way to get to him before this.
在这之前没有办法找到他的

1035
01:32:44,822 --> 01:32:48,156
Yes, it's Jena. Those are his favorite slippers.
是的,那是耶拿。哪些是他最喜欢的拖鞋

1036
01:32:49,827 --> 01:32:52,614
Can you see what's happening inside the car?
你能看到车内发生了什么吗？

1037
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:55,036
The windows are too dark.
窗户太暗

1038
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:58,658
Hold that. Can you freeze it?
别动。你能停止吗？

1039
01:32:58,878 --> 01:33:01,036
Look, the shoes are different.
看这,鞋子是不同的

1040
01:33:01,255 --> 01:33:05,123
He's not wearing slippers anymore. That's where it happened. In the car.
他不再穿拖鞋了。那就是发生地点,在车里

1041
01:33:05,343 --> 01:33:07,382
We've got to find it.
我们得找到它

1042
01:33:09,222 --> 01:33:11,344
She's a government spy.

1043
01:33:15,436 --> 01:33:17,310
Look.
看

01:33:21,317 --> 01:33:23,108
Come on.
来

1045
01:34:00,106 --> 01:34:02,145
Give me a hand, will you?
帮我一把,好吗？

1046
01:34:26,799 --> 01:34:28,459
You seriously think...
你真的认为...

1047
01:34:28,676 --> 01:34:31,511
What else would they have done? Left him in the airport?
我们还会做什么？把他留在机场了吗？

1048
01:34:35,474 --> 01:34:37,099
It's the treaty, isn't it?
这是条约,不是吗？

1049
01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:40,264
If it had gone through, Nejim would have been ruined.
如果达成了协议,纳吉姆就遭殃了

1050
01:34:40,479 --> 01:34:43,813
- Jena was going to sign it?   - That's why they needed a substitute.
- 而耶拿要签署它吗？  - 但你不明白吗？这就是他们为什么需要一个替身

1051
01:34:44,025 --> 01:34:47,026
To denounce the treaty before the assassination.
在暗杀前通告废除条约

1052
01:34:51,115 --> 01:34:53,440
I have a vivid imagination.
我有着丰富的想像力

1053
01:34:53,659 --> 01:34:57,953
I must say, I never saw myself unpacking a prime minister.
我必须说,我从来没见过自己给首相开箱子

1054
01:35:05,087 --> 01:35:09,417
Our life expectancy may be nil, but I'd like you to know this has been
我们的寿命可能成为零,但我想让你知道,这是

1055
01:35:09,634 --> 01:35:13,714
a very real, warm, human experience.
非常真实,温暖的人生经验

1056
01:35:31,402 --> 01:35:33,186
It's uncanny.
这太不可思议了

1057
01:35:33,407 --> 01:35:34,902
What is it? Where am...
怎么回事？我在哪...

1058
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:39,401
You're among friends, sir. At least for the next 30 seconds.
都是自己人,先生。至少在接下来的三十秒内

1059
01:35:39,622 --> 01:35:41,947

- 你没事吧？  - 我想是的

1060
01:35:42,166 --> 01:35:45,167

- 是你吗,阿兹尔小姐？  - 我们把他弄出去

We've got him, sir.
我们抓到他了,先生

1063
01:36:15,783 --> 01:36:19,234
It's about time you did something right. Well, get him out!
你应该做正确的事情的时间到了。好吧,把他弄出来

1064
01:36:20,496 --> 01:36:23,947
Hey, you two! Lend a hand here. And you!
嗨,你们两个！来这帮我一把。还有你！

1065
01:36:25,334 --> 01:36:27,078
Undo these chains.

1066
01:36:54,739 --> 01:36:58,571
Put it down! Open it, Sloane.
把它放下！打开它,斯隆

1067
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:12,541
Imbecile. Must you mismanage everything?
蠢货。你一定要把一切都处置失当吗？

1068
01:38:09,647 --> 01:38:11,271
Down! Flat! Now!
卧倒！趴下！现在！

1069
01:38:19,615 --> 01:38:22,023
Come on! Run for it!

1070
01:38:35,014 --> 01:38:36,206
Wait!
等等！

1071
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:41,216
- Can you ride, Mr. Prime Minister?   - You ask that of an Arab?
- 你会骑马吗,首相先生？  - 你向阿拉伯人问这个问题

1072
01:38:45,182 --> 01:38:48,931
- What do you want?   - We, er... er...
- 你们想干什么？  - 我们,嗯...嗯...

1073
01:38:55,359 --> 01:38:57,151
You can't ride in that skirt.
你穿这条裙子骑不了马

1074
01:38:59,363 --> 01:39:01,237
Hup!

That way!
那条路！

1077
01:39:56,671 --> 01:39:58,580
I don't see what he can do now.
我不知道他现在能做什么

1078
01:39:58,798 --> 01:40:01,004
He'll think of something.
哦,他会想办法

1079
01:40:03,344 --> 01:40:06,760
I knew you couldn't keep a good man down.

1080
01:40:19,944 --> 01:40:21,983

David!
戴维！

1083
01:40:50,808 --> 01:40:54,307

- 你还好吗？  - 不。我为自己感到羞耻

Are you sure?

If they don't, watch out for the last one.

1089
01:42:50,636 --> 01:42:53,127
Here comes old Eagle-Eye.
老鹰的眼睛盯上这了

1090
01:42:53,347 --> 01:42:55,921
This is like a recurring dream I used to have.
这就像一个我曾经反复做过的梦

1091

Here goes.
从这走

1093
01:43:06,861 --> 01:43:10,444
Don't, David. Please, don't. You'll be a sitting duck.
不行,戴维。拜托,别这样。你会成为瓮中之鳖

1094
01:43:46,275 --> 01:43:49,360
How come my recurring dream never ended this way?
我反复做过的梦为何不是这种结局？

1095
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:51,362
I don't know. Mine always did.

I guess I just travel in better dreams.

Do I have your... solemn pledge that you'll never spy again?
你能向我...郑重承诺你再也不做间谍了吗？

- 只对你  - 嗯,非常棒

1099

Hey!

You clumsy idiot! Oh, it's you, Mr. Pollock.
你这个笨拙的蠢货！哦,是你,波洛克先生

David... you can swim, can't you?
戴维...你会游泳,是吗？

1103
01:44:26,274 --> 01:44:28,313
Sorry. Not a stroke.
抱歉,我一点也不会

1104
01:44:40,997 --> 01:44:42,870
David!
戴维！

1105
01:44:46,294 --> 01:44:49,497
Here we are again, taking a bath together.
我们又在一起洗了个澡

1106
01:44:49,714 --> 01:44:52,086
David, you lied to me!

1107

Sure. It was my turn.
当然。轮到我了
