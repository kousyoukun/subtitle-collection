You got sad eyes.

11
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,922
Not my usual pick-up line, but...

12
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:20,803
I just sensed you are a man
running from shadows.

13
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,850
What's your usual pick-up line?

14
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,939
When I see a guy
alone at the bar

15
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,149
at 3:00 in the morning,

16
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:39,488
I lean in real close
and whisper in his ear:

17
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:44,159
"For 510 bucks,
we can spend an hour.

18
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,329
For 1,000,
we can spend a night."

19
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,624
Why 510?

20
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:57,131
'Cause the ATM
only spits out 20s.

21
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:01,552
I've never had a john ask me
to break a note.

22
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,723
That's actually smart.

23
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:11,812
So?

24
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,482

JIMMY:
You sure about this?

37
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:24,862
YOUNG WOMAN:
I'm sure, I'm sure.

38
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,157
Okay.

39
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,085
Okay.

40
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,547
Who's Shelby?

41
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,175
She rocks my world.

42
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,927
You're a lucky gal.

43
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:49,970
Yeah, we both are.

44
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,305
Right there?

45
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,226
Hold on.

46
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,108
James Jayne?

47
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,568
Yeah.

48
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,487
That's what it says
on my license.

49
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,657
Detective Freeman.

50
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,659
This is Detective Vargas.

51
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:12,910
Hi.

52
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,119
JIMMY:
Okay.

53
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,498
Yeah, your old man
was on the force, wasn't he?

54
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,166
14th precinct.

55
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,835
Hmm, how's he doing?

56
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,256
I don't think
he's doing much of anything.

57
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,008
Spends his days
at the Fitzgerald Cemetery.

58
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,093
He was a good cop.

59
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,511
Damn good cop.

60
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,304
Always paid his tab.

61
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,432
Did you ever consider the force?

62
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,268
Yeah. You ever think about it?

63
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,603
No, never.

64
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,528
That's yours, right?

65
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,155
I mean, it's my shop's lighter.

66
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,240
Right.

67
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:55,160
James-- sorry,
may I call you, "James"?

68
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,997
The reason that we're here
is we need to talk to you

69
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,790
about the four dead girls.

70
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay?

71
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,877
What's that have to do with me?

72
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,255
The lighter,
it was found at the crime scene.

73
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,631
What's your point?

74
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,467
What was it doing there?

75
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,219
I don't know what it's fucking
doing there.

76
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:15,306
I once found my lighter floating
in a urinal at a Duke's.

77
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,684
Am I a suspect?

78
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,894
VARGAS: You were seen
with one of the victims

79
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,061
at Rocka's, okay.

80
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,563
Thing about Rocka's,

81
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,189
it's over on the other side
of town

82
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,816
and there are 100
good watering holes

83
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,067
in between here and there,
right?

84
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,027
Yeah.

85
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,237
Yeah, again, again,
what's your point?

86
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:33,991
My point is why drive
all the way over there

87
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,535
like I was saying,
it's a long ways away.

88
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,996
Sentimental reasons.

89
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,664
VARGAS:
Such as?

90
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,293
My mother used to work there.

91
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,087
Okay. Behind the bar?

92
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,547
No, not behind the bar.

93
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,840
Oh.

94
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,259
Uh, Jimmy, excuse my partner.

95
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:56,180
He still doesn't know what side
of the bed to wake up on.

96
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,139
VARGAS:
He's right.

97
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,557
We have some photos,

98
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,644
maybe you could uh, ID
some of the victims.

99
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:02,811
That'd be helpful.

100
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,730
Holy shit,
you don't even know their names.

101
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,983
James, we're gonna need to talk
to you in private, okay?

102
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,485
The sooner, the better.

103
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,363
All right, give me an hour.
I got a customer.

104
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,365
No, we need to talk to you
right now,

105
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,909
so the tramp stamp
will have to wait.

106
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,536
How you doin', darlin'?

107
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,287
What you gonna get, a unicorn?

108
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,413
(Chuckles)

109
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,877
(♪♪♪)

110
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,262
FREEMAN:
I hope you can be discrete.

111
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:41,475
Last thing we need
is a media circus.

112
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,520
Yeah, he's right,
'cause if that happens,

113
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,939
then the D.A.,
he puts pressure on us

114
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:50,025
to pin it on some poor schmuck.

115
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,570
All right. I'll go ahead
and get started, right, boss?

116
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,238
-Yes.
-Okay.

117
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,950
For the record,
I'm Detective Vargas.

118
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,743
That's Detective Freeman.

119
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,287
And we're conducting
an interview

120
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:07,293
with Mr. James Jayne
concerning case V-7-7-4-3.

121
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,878
They suffer?

122
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,212
What do you think?

123
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:11,672
I think it's a fair
fucking question,

124
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:12,882
that's what I think.

125
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,175
Yeah, they suffered.

126
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,888
I imagine
you already questioned

127
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,681
the guests, staff?

128
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,350
Since 5:00 a.m. this morning.

129
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,394
63 rooms.

130
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,646
VARGAS:
Yeah, nobody suspicious.

131
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:31,692
Nobody caught our attention,
except you.

132
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,904
Security cameras?

133
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,573
They didn't have any
at the rat trap

134
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:38,574
they found 'em at,

135
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,826
but they're on camera
leaving the bar.

136
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,287
Then you're on camera
a few seconds later

137
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,497
following 'em out the door.

138
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,583
I had a drink, and I left.

139
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,667
FREEMAN:
What time?

140
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,128
2:30. Give or take.

141
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:53,005
Talk to anybody
while you were there?

142
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,382
JIMMY:
Yeah.

143
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,759
VARGAS:
What were you doing there?

144
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,427
(Sighs) I was fucking guys.

145
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,596
-FREEMAN: Easy.
-It's just juries,

146
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,766
they don't look real favorably
on uncooperative witnesses.

147
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,185
-Right?
-Right.

148
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,020
Look, why don't you just
show me the pictures?

149
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,563
'Cause something tells me
somebody told you

150
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,190
I was with the girls that night.

151
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:12,775
You want to see the pictures?

152
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,777
Sure,
we'll show you the pictures.

153
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,656
Pretty sordid.

154
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,784
Let me just start back
at the beginning here.

155
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:23,327
Here we go.

156
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,913
Huh, pretty gnarly, right?

157
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,206
Gnarly?

158
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,958
Recognize any of them?

159
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:35,005
Boom, boom, boom,
what you think?

160
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,258
That's pretty bad.

161
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,509
JIMMY:
Go back.

162
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,763
-That's Star.
-VARGAS: Huh.

163
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,848
JIMMY: That's what she told me
her name was.

164
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,892
You ever seen
these girls before?

165
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,895
Not before last night.

166
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:53,148
You talked to Star,
what about?

167
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,025
-Business.
-What?

168
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,444
-Business.
-Tattoos or movies?

169
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,946
JIMMY:
She was an actor.

170
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:00,906
Aspiring actor.

171
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,450
Am I the only suspect?

172
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,411
FREEMAN:
Person of interest.

173
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:09,540
VARGAS: So Star, I'm assuming
she was a working girl.

174
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,916
Yeah.

175
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,835
Did she make you an offer?

176
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,462
JIMMY:
Of course she did.

177
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:16,797
VARGAS:
Did you take her up on it?

178
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:18,132
Or did you try and bargain
with her?

179
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,092
Maybe when you tried
to bargain with her,

180
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,261
you kind of made her feel
a little cheap--

181
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,220
JIMMY:
Fucking what?

182
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,055
VARGAS: Then she said
something nasty, who knows?

183
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,932
Maybe that hurt your feelings,
and then you thought,

184
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:27,975
"Hey, I'm really gonna let her have it."

185
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,768
-(Overlapping speech)
-Double fucking talk.

186
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,353
Did you hook up with her?

187
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,191
No. I told her I was meeting
with somebody after.

188
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,735
FREEMAN:
And who is that?

189
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,195
This girl I run around with. Christine.

190
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,239
-Okay.
-Are we done here?

191
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,700
No. So I'm just trying to get
all this straight in my head,

192
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,202
-maybe you can help me, boss?
-Yeah.

193
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:49,205
-So the bar, it closes at 2:30.
-FREEMAN: Right.

194
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,707
VARGAS: That gives you 45 minutes
to kill 'em.

195
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,833
Stage 'em.

196
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:56,295
Then mosey on over
to this Christine girl.

197
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,131
And you asked,
"Did they suffer?"

198
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:00,591
Their necks were broken.

199
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:01,842
All four of 'em.

200
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:03,928
Of course,
that's not real difficult.

201
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,389
When you got poor helpless girls
all whacked out on

202
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,809
junk and blow,
God knows what else.

203
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,271
Now the only
suspect description we got

204
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:17,358
is of a Caucasian shitkicker.

205
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,443
You seen any of those lately?

206
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,072
Get the fuck out of my shop.

207
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,698
I actually think we're done here

208
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,951
and we probably don't need
to tell you this,

209
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,496
but don't leave the country,
hell, don't leave the county.

210
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,373
We can haul you in
on a Ramey warrant

211
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,499
anytime, okay.

212
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,335
So yeah, you're still a suspect,
got it?

213
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:38,879
Don't worry,
if you get found guilty,

214
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:41,465
we'll walk you down
to the electric chair ourselves.

215
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:42,800
It's like that
old gospel number,

216
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,301
You'll Never Walk Alone.

217
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:45,302
Let's hit it, boss.

218
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,679
Good talking to you.

219
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,394
Nice spot.

220
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,235
(♪♪♪)

221
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,572
(Grunts)
Fuck!

222
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,706
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

223
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,502
Christine.

224
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,129
Hey.

225
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,924
One sec, come here.

226
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,764
You get my text?

227
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:35,102
Cops calling on me at work
ain't a good look, Jimmy.

228
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,564
They wanted to confirm you
were on your way to see me

229
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,857
last night.

230
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,818
What'd you say?

231
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,361
I told 'em, yeah.

232
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,656
The bald one,
he thought I'd be all bent

233
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,326
about you flirting
with those poor girls.

234
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:54,079
I told 'em, nah,
it ain't like that.

235
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:58,459
He flirts with everybody,
that's what makes him Jimmy.

236
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:00,920
Attagirl.

237
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,504
The other one,

238
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:05,925
he acts all best friends
bonding shit,

239
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,636
wasn't shy about doing
a little flirting himself.

240
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,222
Fuckin' asshole.

241
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,892
(Laughter, chatter
in background)

242
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,161
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

243
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,121
Whoa, whoa.

244
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,456
-Oh God.
-Whoa.

245
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,875
-All right.
-Whoa, whoa.

Let's just say
you're a person of interest

276
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:22,496
and we'll leave it at that.

277
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:24,123
Okay?

278
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,585
You think I did it?

See me looking like a badass,
shooting these fucking guns.

311
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,358
They should let me shoot
a real one, huh?

312
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:16,485
Ain't gonna make the show
easier to watch.

00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:20,573
I know you didn't just come here
to bruise my ego.

315
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,492
Rub your paycheck on it,
that'll make it feel better.

316
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:24,827
Yeah, that's good.

317
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,788
All right, Jimmy,
what's the favor?

318
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,749
You're in the scene, right?

319
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,835
I do okay. It's not really
your vibe though,

320
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,044
if that's what you're asking.

321
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,673
Don't use that tone of voice
with me.

322
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:40,551
Remember who kept you safe
on the inside.

323
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:43,721
Yeah, I know.

324
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,431
You know how grateful I am that
you protected me

325
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,515
when I was in there.

326
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,145
I bet your friends think
you're tough

327
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:54,773
doing three months hard time
for a fucking DUI or whatever.

328
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,402
I wonder what they'd say
if they find out

329
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,237
you cried yourself
to sleep every night

330
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:02,615
worried Kratos from Cell Block E
was gonna make you

331
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:04,366
his little fucking bitch.

332
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,410
I'm grateful
that you fucked him up for me.

333
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:09,538
How grateful?

334
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,584
Anything for a friend, Jimmy.

335
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,253
Got your kit?

336
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:17,463
Yeah.

337
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:18,464
Okay.

338
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,341
Yeah, all right.
Come on.

339
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:30,392
Heard they're already planning
a rip-off episode

340
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:31,435
about the dead girls.

341
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,728
Bullshit.

342
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,021
I swear to God.

343
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:37,066
The writer's PA with the fat ass
told me last night.

344
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,359
That is tasteless.

345
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,028
I knew one of 'em.

346
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:42,571
From where?

347
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,032
Some party.

348
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:46,700
Whose?

349
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,079
Persi Muleeney, something.

350
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,456
Get the fuck outta here.
That's a made-up name.

351
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,625
I swear to God, man,
she was all over me.

352
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,627
What was her name?

353
00:22:56,794 --> 00:22:58,587
BOURKE: She didn't tell me
her real name.

354
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,589
Don't tell me.

355
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,091
"If you forget..."

356
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:03,384
BOURKE:
"...you just gotta look up."

357
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,885
-JIMMY: Yeah.
-BOURKE: You knew Star?

358
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:06,095
Briefly.

359
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,847
Tell me about the guy
running the party.

360
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:11,475
BOURKE: Persi? I-- I didn't know
it was his party.

361
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,562
Finds girls on OnlyFans
and Craigslist,

362
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,814
turns 'em into porn stars
and escorts.

363
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:19,108
They float around the scene
for a little bit

364
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,026
then they just disappear,
that's all I know.

365
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,444
What do you mean disappear?

366
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,196
BOURKE: I mean they go back
to bumfuck Idaho

367
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,573
wherever the hell
they came from.

368
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,243
Man, this J-bird
fucking with you?

369
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,412
No, man, we're all right,
aren't we?

370
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:34,748
-Are we?
-Yeah, we're good.

371
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:36,041
BOURKE:
This is Jimmy Jayne.

372
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,710
This guy's a motherfucking
legend right here.

373
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:38,961
-True genius.
-Pleasure to meet you.

374
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,130
Oh, so you guys inside together?

375
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,299
-How'd you know?
-Come on, man.

376
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:45,301
'Cause all your other friends
that come here,

377
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:46,594
look like Ken dolls.

378
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,053
No offense.

379
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:49,221
BOURKE: Yeah, fucking right
we were in.

380
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:50,973
This dude did half the art
in San Quentin.

381
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,224
Why don't you tell him
about the time

382
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:53,934
I fucked up Kratos in the yard?

383
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:55,227
You know the story.

384
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,273
Yeah, I remember that, sure.

385
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:03,694
He was uh-- he was fresh meat.

386
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,571
Wouldn't let anybody
fuck with him, so he beat a man

387
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:08,282
unconscious on his first night
with his bare hands.

388
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:09,950
Yeah.

389
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:11,327
Bullshit.

390
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:14,288
-That's a fucking lie.
-It's a lie.

391
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,998
ROY:
Hey, but you're a great friend

392
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,209
to try to make this
punk-ass look good.

393
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,960
Hey, you can't talk to me
like that, bro.

394
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:21,253
You're a fucking set mechanic.

395
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:22,755
I'm number one
on the call sheet, all right.

396
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:25,049
Calm down, kid. Calm down.

397
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:28,469
You took this gig for money
just like everybody else.

398
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:29,887
We're making art, all right.

399
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,055
-Art?
-Yeah.

400
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:35,059
This show makes a dumpster fire
look like Citizen Kane.

401
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:36,810
Yeah, well, this show
is number one in the country,

402
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,062
we are number one.

403
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:41,023
That says more about society
than the quality of your show.

404
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,442
Hey, listen,
I have a 66 Chevelle

405
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,069
that's got a bum clutch.

406
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:46,987
-You got a card?
-Yeah.

407
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:50,991
-Here man, call me anytime.
-Thank you.

408
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:52,409
-You guys good?
-Yes, sir.

409
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:55,788
Where you wanna do this?

410
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:58,040
Well, I want 1-1-7 right here.

411
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:00,376
It's how many people watched
last week's episode.

412
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:01,669
117?

413
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,337
Million, yeah.

414
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:06,048
I know, I can't believe people
pay to watch this shit either.

415
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,383
Let's go in my trailer.

416
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:13,722
FILM CREW MEMBER 1:
Action!

417
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:14,974
(Thud)

418
00:25:17,393 --> 00:25:18,894
-Dennis!
-Hey, dude.

419
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,980
Dennis, up!

420
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:22,064
Oh, shoot!

421
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:26,986
(Gun blaring)
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

422
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:32,741
(♪♪♪)

423
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,525
Hi.

424
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:08,736
Now what?

425
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,572
Well, found your fingerprints
on your lighter.

426
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,073
JIMMY:
Who'd have thought?

427
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:14,074
And?

428
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:16,994
We got motive, we got access,

429
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:21,290
and we're one hair follicle away
from writing your warrant.

430
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,417
How'd you find me?

431
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,295
VARGAS: You got a GPS
in your pocket, buddy.

432
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,504
(Vargas chuckling)

433
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,048
You need a warrant
to track a phone.

434
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:31,550
You know you're actually correct
about that.

435
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:34,386
But the thing is judges
these days, they're real busy

436
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,763
and they know
we're the good guys.

437
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:37,640
So they kinda let it slide.

438
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:41,018
Now, you gonna offer me
a cigarette or what?

439
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:45,189
No, it's cool, I actually quit.
Here's the deal.

440
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,983
Everybody I talk to
across the board,

441
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:50,444
they all say
you're a stand-up guy,

442
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,279
except for the five years
in the pen

443
00:26:52,363 --> 00:26:54,490
for putting a guy
in a wheelchair.

444
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,285
I didn't start that fight.

445
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:00,496
But you sure ended it,
didn't you?

446
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,123
And I bet you'd do it
all over again.

447
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,253
Came at me with a screwdriver.

448
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:09,672
Screwdriver.
Shit, that's a deadly weapon.

449
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,760
You know a guy named Persi?

450
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,345
I don't remember his last name.

451
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:17,846
Fucking Persi something,
whatever.

452
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,223
Why?

453
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:21,308
Used to run with Star.

454
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:23,227
You playing detective now?

455
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,522
Just concerned citizen.

456
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,274
I like that.

457
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:33,404
You know, uh, I found out
why you hang out at Rocka's bar.

458
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,993
Should have just told me
your mom was a working gal.

459
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,244
There's no shame in it.

460
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:43,289
Detective Freeman,
he told me that was her spot

461
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:45,541
until, you know,
she went missing.

462
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,001
And of course, your dad,

463
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,211
he lost his mind
trying to find her.

464
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,338
I'm just saying, you know,
I-- I get it.

465
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:54,550
I understand why you feel
so connected to the case.

466
00:27:55,718 --> 00:27:57,595
Sure do have a way with words.

467
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:00,264
Hey pal, James, Jimmy,

468
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,016
I uh-- you know,
that's as close

469
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,351
as you're gonna get
to an apology from me.

470
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,188
Yeah, fine, well...
I have to go.

471
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:10,274
Just, hey, take it easy.

472
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,734
Let us do our thing.

473
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,986
Detective Freeman,
he's a great cop

474
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:16,906
and me, I'm the best thing
that ever happened

475
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:18,824
to the Robbery-Homicide Unit.

476
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,453
How many cases
you close last year?

477
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,288
You want my numbers now?
You want my stats?

478
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,248
I mean, if they were any good,
you'd be squawking about 'em.

479
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:27,583
Oh, come on.

480
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,877
You speak to Star's family?

481
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,129
Tell 'em what happened?

482
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,715
Well, they disowned her
a long time ago,

483
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,926
but they're raising her kid
as their own.

484
00:28:38,636 --> 00:28:39,929
How old?

485
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:43,265
4. Actually the same age
as my boy Terry.

486
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:50,022
James, just don't go kicking
the hornet's nest.

487
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:50,981
'Course not.

488
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:52,942
-You understand?
-Yes.

489
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:54,777
Okay. I'll catch you later.

490
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:58,280

491
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,883

501
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,532
ROY:
Hey man, don't fuck that paint.

502
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,784
I can't be assed with an
L & D form.

503
00:33:53,868 --> 00:33:55,661
(Cellphone ringing)

504
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,037
You got Roy.

505
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:00,749
Roy, it's Jimmy.

506
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:02,751
I met you on set.

507
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:04,253
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

508
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,796
Someone tried to run me down
just now.

509
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:08,757
No shit.
Someone tried to kill you?

510
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:10,593
Yeah. (Indistinct speech)

511
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,885
That's not
what makes it personal,

512
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,970
so much as they fucked up
my ride.

513
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,514
Holy shit, man!

514
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:16,891
You know who it was?

515
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:19,184
If I did, I wouldn't say so
on the phone.

516
00:34:20,144 --> 00:34:22,771
You know what, it's nothing.

517
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,441
It don't sound like nothing
to me, man,

518
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:28,152
but what's it like to be you?

519
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:30,237
It was a Rover Wagon.
It was super charged.

520
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:32,113
Had some real fucking
balls to it.

521
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,075
Still not the smartest way
to try to kill somebody.

522
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,870
Yeah, maybe they're smarter
than you think, man.

523
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:41,457
Random ex-con cut down
on the side of the road?

524
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:42,624
Who'd give a shit?

525
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,251
Yeah, that's one way to put it,
I guess.

526
00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:48,130
Rover's a lot bigger
than a bullet though, bro.

527
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:50,382
Oh no, they came at me
with those, too.

528
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:52,551
Listen...

529
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:57,848
I got this feeling that
you might be able to uh,

530
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,351
you know, get me
some sort of protection.

531
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,560
You know what I'm talking about?

532
00:35:01,644 --> 00:35:03,437
10-4, good buddy.

533
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,482
I know you're a kindred soul
of the heathen brethren.

534
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,318
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

535
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:10,861
Of course it's a yes, man.

536
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:12,112
Send me the address.

537
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,114
I'll text it to you.

538
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,620
VARGAS:
So this doesn't add up.

539
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:23,207
How does Jimmy go
from felony assault

540
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,959
to multiple homicides?

541
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:28,128
I don't get it.

542
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:30,089
-The old days--
-Yeah.

543
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:33,133
You told me about, you'd just
taken a telephone book to 'em.

544
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:34,635
Now I gotta actually
question people

545
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,887
-and go fucking by the book.
-Right.

546
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:38,097
(Vargas chuckles)

547
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,431
-Yeah.
-Pain in the ass.

548
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:43,102
-Well--
-Mhmm.

549
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:44,687
I guess I'll take care
of this here,

550
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,564
-you gonna hit the game?
-Yeah.

551
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:47,773
VARGAS:
Who is it this week?

552
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,858
-Malibu.
-Right.

553
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,777
If they don't beat them,
who can they beat?

554
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,861
-Yeah.
-(Chuckles)

555
00:35:53,112 --> 00:35:54,196
Exactly.

556
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:57,700
I'll take care of this,
all right.

557
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:59,201
-All right.
-I got it.

558
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:00,911
I hope they win.

559
00:36:08,294 --> 00:36:09,295
(Sighs)

560
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:14,633
I didn't think you'd show.

561
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:18,012
Every brother needs a keeper
from time to time.

562
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:20,055
Are you sure you want this?

563
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:23,517
I got someone trying to pin
a bunch of murders on me.

564
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:25,561
I'm not going back inside,

565
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,563
especially not for something
I didn't do.

566
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,690
Easy, new friend, easy.

567
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,275
The fuck am I into?

568
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,485
Show business, son.

569
00:36:33,903 --> 00:36:36,405
It's the most gangster game
out there.

570
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:37,865
You got family?

571
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:40,367
No, not since my dad died.

572
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:41,869
Hmm, how'd he go?

573
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,121
Bottle.

574
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:45,414
Hmm.

575
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:47,082
Come here, let's do this.

576
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,509
Your dad teach you how to shoot?

577
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:00,054
All right.

578
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,932
You got six rounds in there.

579
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:07,728
There you go.

580
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:14,360
How much do I owe you?

581
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:15,945
Nothing, man.

582
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,696
Just a favor down the line.

583
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:19,782
All right.

584
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:21,617
Anytime.

585
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,244
Yeah, I'll hold you to that.

586
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:25,829
But you be careful, man.

587
00:37:27,248 --> 00:37:28,999
-See you.
-Thank you.

588
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:43,472

589
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,034
(Sighs)

590
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:18,299
I may have to get out of town.

591
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,050
We should go somewhere.

592
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,887
Huh, I got that ticket
to Berlin, baby.

593
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:26,265
What ticket?

594
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:28,225
I didn't tell you?

595
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:31,854
I would have remembered.

596
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:33,689
I'm leaving Monday.

597
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,984
Sandy is there as an au pair,

598
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:40,988
we'll hang,
I hear it's a good scene.

599
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:44,116
Berlin?

600
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:46,869
It's in Germany.

601
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:49,830
Yeah.

602
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:53,584
(Chuckles)

603
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:57,254
You live in the moment, Jimmy.

604
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:01,508
Yeah.

605
00:39:10,935 --> 00:39:12,102
Fucking Berlin.

606
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,562

607
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,375

608
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:47,429

609
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:48,472
What's up, buddy?

610
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:50,474
-How you doing?
-Good.

611
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:52,476
I need a favor.

612
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,729
(Scoffs)

613
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:57,565
You know I can't get back
into the evidence locker.

614
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:58,607
They won't let me back there.

615
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:00,276
-It's not that kind of favor.
-What is it?

616
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,570
I need you to run a name
through IVIS.

617
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:06,782
What's the name?

618
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:08,033
Oh fuck.

619
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,244
Uh...

620
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,914
Peter Mul...

621
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:16,333
Persi Mul, something or other.

622
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:18,377
Mul something.
What is that?

623
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:20,629
Persi Muleeney?

624
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:21,964
That's it.

625
00:40:22,131 --> 00:40:23,173
(Scoffs)

626
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:24,884
Man, he lives up on Mulholland.

627
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:26,802
He's got an office down
on Skid Row.

628
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:27,803
You know him?

629
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,263
Yeah, everybody knows him.

630
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:30,764
He's a popular guy.

631
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,641
Give me a current address.

632
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,184
(Pete sighs)

633
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:35,686
Look, man, is this something
that's gonna come back

634
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,479
-and bite me in the ass?
-No, never.

635
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:38,814
-Yeah.
-Absolutely not.

636
00:40:38,898 --> 00:40:40,900
Yeah, I believe you again, huh?

637
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:45,654
Look, man, you know
I'll lie on the stand, right,

638
00:40:45,738 --> 00:40:47,156
say you had a gun to my head.

639
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,492
That's why I love you, brother.

640
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,703
You really are LA's finest,
huh?

641
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:54,205
Aww, that's sweet.
Fuck you, too.

642
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:55,456
(Jimmy chuckles)

643
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,208
Can you tell me
what he's driving?

644
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:07,801
Seems his 2011 Land Rover
was reported stolen yesterday.

645
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,401
You didn't get that from me.

646
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,782
He's having a party
up at his place tonight.

647
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,952
Lot of cops gonna be there,
'cause we get in free.

648
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:34,620
Yeah.

649
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:37,164
Seems he knows what lives
matter most.

650
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,459
All right.

651
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:42,586
Stay lucky, buddy.

652
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:45,756
Next time have the decency
to buy me a fucking coffee.

I'm on the list.

657

You a cop?

658
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:33,053
Yeah, 14th.

659
00:42:35,598 --> 00:42:36,849
Where's your badge?

660
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:38,851
It's in the car.

661
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:41,896

Want to hear a bad joke?

A bad joke?

667
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:30,337
A really bad one.

I do want to hear a bad joke.

Shoot.

671
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:43,475
What are the three words
to ruin man's ego?

672
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:46,812
What are the three words

We're driving to Barstow
like 3:00 in the morning, right.

682
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:59,153
We're sweating like bullets,

we're sweating. We're sitt-

Mind if I have a--
Yeah, well, I mind.

691
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:18,214
I'm sitting here telling a story

00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:19,924
Is this about a job

Yeah, I'm sorry.

694
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,428
Go ahead, finish your story.

695
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,430

You're ruining my story.

One thing,
they got this red-headed mayor,

711
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:59,171
I'm fucking telling you,
she's got big fucking tits.

712
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:01,966
And man, she loves to ride.

She loves to ride, huh?

714
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:05,219
Who the fuck invited you
to my party?

715
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:07,429
I invited me.

716
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:09,765
I was hoping to have a minute
in private,

717
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:11,850
but suit yourself.

718
00:48:17,273 --> 00:48:18,983
Gisella, Lana, and Star.

719
00:48:19,692 --> 00:48:21,485
You ever heard
those names before?

720
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,237
I'll give you a hint.

721
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:25,322
They're not fucking race horses.

722
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,533
Kaiser, get this motherfucker
out of here.

723
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,951
JIMMY:
Hold on, Kaiser.

724
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:30,703
You ever met 'em?

725
00:48:30,786 --> 00:48:32,329
No, I can't say I have.

726
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:35,249
You like jokes?

727
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:36,625
Yeah, who don't like
a fucking joke.

728
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:38,294
If this is a joke,
I don't find it funny.

729
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:40,170
JIMMY: I'ma tell you--
I'ma tell you a joke.

730
00:48:41,714 --> 00:48:43,841
Three words to ruin a man's ego?

731
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:44,800
"Is it in?"

732
00:48:44,884 --> 00:48:46,093
Now get the fuck out.

733
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:48,888
You heard that one before.

734
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:50,681
Yeah, I heard,
I'm the one who wrote it.

735
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:52,850
'Cause this girl told it
to me the other night.

736
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,059
PERSI:
What girl?

737
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:56,186
Same girl
you said you never met.

738
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,187
She heard it in my movie.

739
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:59,148
I just told you,
David Cop-A-Feel. It's--

740
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:02,109
Anybody who watches pornos,
watch-- knows the fucking line.

741
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:03,068
It's famous.

742
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:04,653
Now get the fuck out of here!

743
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:06,530
Of course it is.

744
00:49:07,323 --> 00:49:08,490
Night, guys.

745
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,578
Is that coke?

746
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:15,748
And they're fucking passed out?

747
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:17,499
PERSI:
Yeah, I got fucking coke.

748
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,501
JIMMY:
Can I rip a line of blow?

749
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:20,836
You get the fuck
out of my house,

750
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,046
you can't have none!

751
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:25,382
Oh to be you, huh.

752
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:28,677
Small dick motherfucker.

753
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:42,691
-You really a cop?
-No.

754
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:52,910
I seen them here, those girls.

755
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:55,996
Come with a sista I knows.

756
00:49:56,956 --> 00:49:58,457
Eleanor Rogers.

757
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:02,294
She's one, uh,
20 feet from stardom types.

758
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:04,713
Backup singer.

759
00:50:04,797 --> 00:50:06,131
Preacher's daughter.

760
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,886
Why you telling me this?

761
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:15,349
The fuck?
Motherfucker, I'm telling you.

762
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:17,142
Leave it at that.

763
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:18,602
Get the fuck outta here.

764
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:22,022
Thanks.

765
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,987
(Car engine rumbling)

766
00:50:38,497 --> 00:50:40,958
(♪♪♪)

767
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:23,209
(Indistinct singing)

768
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:39,099
(Humming)

769
00:51:48,651 --> 00:51:50,110
That was you singing, huh?

770
00:51:51,654 --> 00:51:52,905
Guilty.

771
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:57,076
It's a recording studio?

772
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:05,292
I'm looking for Miss Rogers.

773
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:07,294
Miss Eleanor Rogers.

774
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:08,921
Why?

775
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:12,758
Our mutual friend Kaiser says
we should talk.

776
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:14,843
About?

777
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:17,596
About something
we're both involved in,

778
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,597
we shouldn't be.

779
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:26,689
I'll be at Shay's on 3rd, okay.

780
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:28,774
Hey, you got a light?

781
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:31,402
Yeah.

782
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:39,535
Don't lose it.

783
00:52:40,578 --> 00:52:42,746
There's already enough
of those floating around.

784
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:52,381
ELEANOR:
You don't mean Persi Muleeney?

785
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:55,175
Nah, he ain't got it in him
to murder any girls like that.

786
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:56,385
He ain't that slick.

787
00:52:57,386 --> 00:53:00,222
But he knows some fucking cats
doing some fucked up shit.

788
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:02,141
What cats?

789
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:04,602
He likes to strut
with a scary crowd

790
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:06,145
with his tail all up in the air.

791
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:08,063
But as much as he likes to be
on this gangsta shit,

792
00:53:08,147 --> 00:53:11,400
they just take his money
and laugh at his dumb white ass.

793
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:12,735
Drug people?

794
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:13,736
Fuck yeah.

795
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:15,571
Cartel hookup.

796
00:53:15,654 --> 00:53:16,739
Why's someone like you
hanging out

797
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:18,532
with someone shady like Persi?

798
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,659
Someone like me?

799
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:24,288
He told me
he'd put up all kinds of money

800
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:26,081
to help me put out a solo album.

801
00:53:26,707 --> 00:53:27,875
And did he?

802
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,544
No.

803
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,339
Said if I could fuck like
I could sing...

804
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:37,509
Well, I'm not even gonna
tell you the rest of that

805
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:38,969
'cause I don't want
my father's ghost

806
00:53:39,053 --> 00:53:40,304
hearing that
come out of my mouth.

807
00:53:42,473 --> 00:53:44,225
Persi said
he never met the girls.

808
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:46,560
Oh, honey, no, no, he lied.

809
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:48,562
What else?

810
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:52,191
Those girls, I mean,
oh my God,

811
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,527
the way they were found
like that, I mean,

812
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:57,446
that was somebody sending
a message.

813
00:53:57,529 --> 00:53:59,114
You said that wasn't
Persi's style.

814
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,157
No, no.

815
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:02,910
I think it was--
it was like those people

816
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:04,620
I was talking about earlier,

817
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:07,665
the ones that likes to use
Persi's house like it's theirs.

818
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:08,999
"Scary crowd".

819
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:10,960
Shit, you ain't heard this
from me.

820
00:54:11,544 --> 00:54:13,254
That scene is a blackhole.

821
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:15,422
Girls come up missing
all the time,

822
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:16,757
guys always trying
to take advantage

823
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,883
of the situation.

824
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:21,136
There was this one creeper
at a party one night.

825
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,304
Late like 4:00 in the morning.

826
00:54:22,388 --> 00:54:23,472
Silver-haired dude.

827
00:54:23,556 --> 00:54:25,849
Now we were gonna go
to the patio and get high.

828
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:28,435
Anyway, the silver-haired dude
was inside

829
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,688
and I saw him talking to some
girls who had been there,

830
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,857
I'd seen them a couple of times
and they were giving him money.

831
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,943
About a week later,
I'm pulled over

832
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:37,903
for not using my turn signal,
and it was him,

833
00:54:37,987 --> 00:54:39,113
the silver-haired dude.

834
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,197
He's a fucking cop.

835
00:54:40,281 --> 00:54:42,366
-Is he a stocky guy?
-Yes, yeah.

836
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:43,450
Uh, Flosso.

837
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:45,035
Officer Flosso,
that was the name on the ticket.

838
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:45,995
JIMMY:
Right, right.

839
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:47,997
ELEANOR: The girl said
he was a cage fighter.

840
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:53,794
Our friend Kaiser,
I need to talk to him again.

841
00:54:53,878 --> 00:54:54,920
Well, I'll give you his number,

842
00:54:55,004 --> 00:54:56,547
but, you know,
don't expect much.

843
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,758
He's a moody motherfucker,
like you.

844
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:06,974
Oh, one more thing,
and maybe it's nothing

845
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:10,144
but the silver-haired guy,
I saw him take some money

846
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:12,813
and then give it to this guy,
the "Doc".

847
00:55:12,897 --> 00:55:14,315
Well, we called him
"Dr. Feelgood",

848
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,150
because, you know,
he was giving out

849
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,110
pills like it was candy.

850
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:21,322
Big beard
and the curly-ish hair,

851
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:23,073
deep voice, like...

852
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:27,203
I don't fucking know,
that also happened.

853
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:29,872
I don't know if that helps.

854
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,583
I wish I'd met you a week ago.

855
00:55:33,209 --> 00:55:36,045
Oh, what do you do?

856
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,130
What do I do?

857
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:39,757
Yeah?

858
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:43,177
Um, uh, a lotta this, lately.

859
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,096
No, when you're not creeping
on singers outside of studios.

860
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,348
Did you say creeping?

861
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:48,432
I--

862
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:51,018
Um, what do I do?

863
00:55:51,352 --> 00:55:53,771
-I do uh, I do tattoos.
-Hmm.

864
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:57,191
And uh... motors.

865
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:59,235
-Hmm, rock 'n' roll life.
-Yeah.

866
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:00,527
-Very cool.
-It's right.

867
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:01,779
It's good people mostly.

868
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:03,739
-Yeah.
-You got any ink?

869
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:05,950
Oh man, no.

870
00:56:06,242 --> 00:56:08,619
I never found anything that
I wanted to stay with me

871
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:09,620
for life, you know.

872
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:10,788
Oh.

873
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:13,624
Sometimes a tattoo
is just a tattoo.

874
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:16,585
Okay, well then how come
most girls get a rose

875
00:56:16,669 --> 00:56:17,920
or a dolphin?

876
00:56:18,671 --> 00:56:20,422
Fucking angel wings.

877
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:22,883
-How trashy is that?
-Touché.

878
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:24,802
-It's so trashy, right.
-Touché.

879
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:26,971
Yeah, well, you know
times are-- times are tough.

880
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:28,138
Ink is ink.

881
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:29,807
Oh, and that's when you do
those kind of tattoos.

882
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,350
I draw the line at tramp stamps.

883
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:33,227
-Oh.
-(Laughing)

884
00:56:34,103 --> 00:56:36,355
Well, it is good to know
there's a line.

885
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:37,815
Yeah, there is.

886
00:56:38,274 --> 00:56:39,942
No, they all mean something.

887
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,446
-It's not gonna run out on you.
-No.

888
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,032
That's a different story,
probably a different tattoo.

889
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:51,579
(Cellphone dings)

890
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:54,206
Oh, I have to go.

891
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:56,083
That is my 15.

892
00:56:56,417 --> 00:56:57,710
I've got an audition.

893
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:58,836
Mm?

894
00:56:58,919 --> 00:57:00,588
Uh I hope that this helped.

895
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:03,173
Changed my day around.

896
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:04,800
Oh, fine.

897
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:06,594
Maybe I'll see you around.

898
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:08,470
-Good luck on your audition.
-Thank you.

899
00:57:08,554 --> 00:57:09,763
You're welcome.

900
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:23,068
(♪♪♪)

901
00:57:59,647 --> 00:58:02,149
Meet me behind the station.
I have something to show you.

902
00:58:08,948 --> 00:58:10,950
(Snorting)

903
00:58:17,957 --> 00:58:19,792
(Cellphone ringing)

904
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:22,711
(Coughs)

905
00:58:24,797 --> 00:58:25,881
Yo.

906
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,717
Yeah, we've-- we've been
shooting all night.

907
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:31,095
Jayne busted into my party
the other night,

908
00:58:31,554 --> 00:58:33,722
asking me about Star
and the others.

909
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:35,057
Nah, I didn't tell him shit.

910
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,767
The asshole ruined my high.

911
00:58:38,143 --> 00:58:39,687
You gotta be cool, bro.

912
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:42,815
There's some girls here.

913
00:58:43,566 --> 00:58:46,110
(Snorts, coughs)
(Knocking on door)

914
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:48,696
Yeah, I still got 'em ,
come on up.

915
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:49,947
Okay, cool.

916
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,532
(Knocking on door)

917
00:58:54,076 --> 00:58:56,287
Hey, yo, what--
what are you doing here?

918
00:58:56,704 --> 00:58:58,747
You don't-- you can't just come
over to my office like this.

919
00:58:59,415 --> 00:59:01,876
(♪♪♪)

920
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:09,049
(Grunting, moaning in distance)

921
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:24,481
ERASMUS: Looking for Persi?
All the way down to the left.

922
00:59:25,816 --> 00:59:28,444
(indistinct speech)

923
00:59:38,829 --> 00:59:40,080
Bye, Juicy.

924
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:42,708
(♪♪♪)

925
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:53,636
(Screams)

926
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:56,347
(♪♪♪)

927
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:16,784
Hey.

928
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:19,245
FREEMAN:
What is it, Jimmy?

929
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:20,746
You're gonna wanna see this.

930
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:21,872
FREEMAN:
What?

931
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:24,458
You need to move your car
before we get it towed.

932
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:25,960
Yeah, I could move it.

933
01:00:26,794 --> 01:00:28,587
I could drive it
right to the morgue.

934
01:00:29,088 --> 01:00:30,339
What are you talking about?

935
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:38,722
Who's pulling the strings?

936
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:41,684
Who could throw the body
of a giant in a trunk

937
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:43,102
without nobody seeing?

938
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:45,521
Whoever did it,
picked the locks

939
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:47,940
in the parking lot on Franklin
where they threw the body.

940
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:50,276
In broad daylight?

941
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,403
They did it sometime
in the morning

942
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:53,904
while I was having breakfast.

943
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,322
You've been tracking my cell,

944
01:00:55,406 --> 01:00:57,324
you know
I couldn't have done this.

945
01:00:57,658 --> 01:00:59,076
VARGAS:
I don't know, buddy.

946
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:03,080
I think somebody's seriously
fucking with you, big time.

947
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:05,082
Or warning me.

948
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,127
Maybe they knew Kaiser
was trying to help me.

949
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,336
Yeah.

950
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,130
Now don't you think
the smart thing to do

951
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:12,423
would have been to tell us

952
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:15,175
about this when the Land Rover
first tried to run you down?

953
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:19,013
I've never been accused
of being smart.

954
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:19,972
Right.

955
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,851
What about your visit
to Persi's party?

956
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:25,436
Persi had nothing to do with it.

957
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,479
He's just a bad host.

958
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:28,647
If I were you,
I would check the people

959
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:30,649
at the Chateau party,
that's where I'd start.

960
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:35,237
Sorry, buddy,
afraid we have to keep the car.

961
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,367
Okay. Well, don't scratch it.

962
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:41,744
Don't fuck with the radio.

963
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:44,622
No scratch, no problem.

964
01:01:45,206 --> 01:01:46,540
Who's driving me home?

965
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:48,751
I'll drive you home.

966
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:02,514
Hey, no smoking in the cruiser.

967
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:04,767
It's regulations.

968
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,268
All right,
have a couple of puffs,

969
01:02:06,352 --> 01:02:07,394
I'll wait.

970
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:15,110
What a fucking day, man.

971
01:02:15,611 --> 01:02:17,404
Yeah, me too.

972
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:19,949
Persi's dead.

973
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:22,952
Yeah, I know,
a real loss to humanity.

974
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:25,079
How'd he go?

975
01:02:25,454 --> 01:02:26,789
VARGAS:
Snapped neck.

976
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:31,377
Now look, I'm only gonna
tell you this once,

977
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,671
I don't think you're involved
in this

978
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:36,173
any more than somebody
wants you to be.

979
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:37,299
Okay.

980
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:41,345
I'm next.

981
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:43,931
I think you're right.

982
01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:45,432
JIMMY:
How's that?

983
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,395
You know something
you don't even know you know.

984
01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:53,524
Or somebody wants you to know
something, you know.

985
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:56,819
Let's hit it.

986
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:58,153
Put that out.

987
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:03,033
(Vargas grunts)

988
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,014
(Birds chirping)

989
01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:35,983
So this how you live?

990
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:41,196
Yeah,
Dad left me the house.

991
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:46,535
Mortgaged to get the shop,
couldn't make the payment, closed,

992
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:49,622
told the family moving in that this
is a separate property.

993
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:53,000
So what, they can kick you out
anytime they want?

994
01:03:55,628 --> 01:03:57,087
I don't know, James.

995
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:01,175
All right, concerned citizen,

996
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:05,471
why don't you tell me
who you think's involved?

997
01:04:05,763 --> 01:04:06,722
Flosso.

998
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:08,432
Flosso?

999
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:10,559
JIMMY:
He's an ex-fighter.

1000
01:04:10,643 --> 01:04:11,518
Huh.

1001
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:14,230
He'd certainly know how to
break their necks clean enough.

1002
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:16,690
So this preacher's daughter,
your source,

1003
01:04:16,774 --> 01:04:18,275
she for certain it was him?

1004
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:21,528
Yeah,
he's working for somebody.

1005
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:23,697
Well, that makes sense,
'cause Flosso,

1006
01:04:23,781 --> 01:04:25,366
he's a real dumb shit.

1007
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:27,451
He wouldn't be able to do it
on his own.

1008
01:04:27,743 --> 01:04:30,329
I'll look him up,
I'll see what I can find.

1009
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:34,667
Hey Vargas,
how well you know your partner?

1010
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:37,336
Why you ask?

1011
01:04:38,963 --> 01:04:40,381
'Cause I think he's dirty.

1012
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:44,802
I think he found my lighter
and thought I was an easy mark.

1013
01:04:45,678 --> 01:04:47,429
You're reaching, buddy.

1014
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:50,182
And you better be careful
what you're saying.

1015
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:52,434
He have an alibi?

1016
01:04:52,685 --> 01:04:54,728
Matter of fact he does.

1017
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:57,606
He was half in the bag
over at the Montello.

1018
01:04:57,815 --> 01:04:59,191
How're the cameras at the
Montello Lounge?

1019
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:00,317
-They're good.
-Yeah?

1020
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:01,485
Yeah.

1021
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:04,363
If you check the video footage
and you see him

1022
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,699
leaving between 2:00 and 2:30,
then I was right.

1023
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:10,661
And if I'm right,
I just wanna know about it.

1024
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:13,205
No. All right,
no more cowboy shit.

1025
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:15,833
I'll take a look at the tapes,
but I can already tell you

1026
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,668
what I'm gonna find, okay.

1027
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:20,754
And by the way,
you're all wrong about Freeman.

1028
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:24,174
He's a good guy,
he's my kid's godfather.

1029
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:28,429
Hitler loved dogs.

1030
01:05:29,054 --> 01:05:29,930
Huh.

1031
01:05:30,014 --> 01:05:31,265
What's your point?

1032
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,143
My point is
some of the most evil people

1033
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:36,270
in the world
still have great smiles.

1034
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:38,814
That's interesting.

1035
01:05:39,231 --> 01:05:40,691
Just do me a favor.

1036
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,401
Stand down, all right.

1037
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:44,528
You done enough, okay?

1038
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:49,074
It's depressing.

1039
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:54,955
(♪♪♪)

1040
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:12,890
JIMMY:
What's your name?

1041
01:06:16,435 --> 01:06:17,686
STAR:
Star.

1042
01:06:21,774 --> 01:06:25,152
If you forget, just look up.

1043
01:06:27,363 --> 01:06:30,157
(♪♪♪)

1044
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:53,847
(Sighs)

1045
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:01,230
(Bike engine rumbling)

1046
01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:06,068
The shit's vegan, right?

1047
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:08,320
Makeup? It's vegan?

1048
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:09,530
Go check.

1049
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:11,699
It's in my contract,
vegan makeup!

1050
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:14,910
(♪♪♪)

1051
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:33,888
Don't fucking say anything,
I'm mic'd.

1052
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:39,602
Okay, you know
what it looks like-- I'm fr--

1053
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:41,103
Shut the fuck up!

1054
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,396
Shut up!

1055
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:46,191
You lied to me.

1056
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:48,903
You lie to me again,
I'll break your fucking face,

1057
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:50,154
you understand?

1058
01:07:50,529 --> 01:07:51,906
-You understand?
-Yeah.

1059
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:53,115
-Yeah?
-Okay.

1060
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:00,372
Tell me about Persi.

1061
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:01,749
Fuck, man.

1062
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:03,918
I was embarrassed to admit
that I was hanging with Persi

1063
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:06,086
'cause he is a fucking scumbag,
okay.

1064
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:08,130
But it's not illegal to drink
his booze and eat his food,

1065
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:11,217
not to mention, fucking pussy
flying around that place.

1066
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,052
I mean, anything goes there.

1067
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:14,886
Like what?

1068
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:18,349
Some local cops there
hanging out now,

1069
01:08:18,431 --> 01:08:20,059
playing poker in the back.

1070
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:24,188
That's not all that's going on
back there.

1071
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,148
Yeah, I heard a few pimped
some girls,

1072
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:27,900
but that's none
of my fucking business.

1073
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:29,985
I had nothing to do
with those dead hookers.

1074
01:08:31,612 --> 01:08:33,864
Star and her friends,
did they go to this party?

1075
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:36,408
Yeah, man, I said that,
I seen them there a few times

1076
01:08:36,492 --> 01:08:38,577
but there's 50 fucking girls
there every night.

1077
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:40,913
You wanna talk to someone?
Talk to Erasmus.

1078
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:42,915
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

1079
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:44,542
Erasmus Alcindor.
He's a screenwriter.

1080
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,336
He's a fucking hack,
looks like a ferret.

1081
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:49,462
He used to date Star.

1082
01:08:49,964 --> 01:08:51,465
Look, I don't know
why they dated either,

1083
01:08:51,549 --> 01:08:53,007
she's a fucking beautiful girl
messing around

1084
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:54,802
with some fucking creep.

1085
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:57,136
He used to lie to her
and say he'd put her in movies.

1086
01:08:58,889 --> 01:09:01,766
He talks to that cop Flosso,
all the time.

1087
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:05,270
Where can I find him?

1088
01:09:06,145 --> 01:09:07,314
Erasmus?

1089
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,484
He lives in those shithole apartments
in Persi's studios.

1090
01:09:11,068 --> 01:09:12,653
I swear to fucking God, man.

1091
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,822
Fuck God,
I swear to you, okay?

1092
01:09:14,904 --> 01:09:16,824
He knows everything about
their operation.

1093
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:17,908
Everything.

1094
01:09:22,663 --> 01:09:24,957
I swear to you,
I swear, I swear, I--

1095
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,543
Listen, listen,
you little bitch.

1096
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:29,962
-You gonna lie to me again?
-No.

1097
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:32,131
-You gonna lie to me again?
-No, I'm not gonna lie again!

1098
01:09:32,214 --> 01:09:33,172
No!

1099
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:36,176
(♪♪♪)

1100
01:10:20,471 --> 01:10:21,597
Erasmus?

1101
01:10:41,825 --> 01:10:42,952
Go away!

1102
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:44,411
Erasmus?

1103
01:10:44,495 --> 01:10:46,372
Are you fucking deaf?
He's not here.

1104
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:55,839
This can go one of two ways.

1105
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:58,384
You watch who you're throwing insults
out of your word-hole to,

1106
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:00,261
you-- you--
the wrong person hears it,

1107
01:11:00,553 --> 01:11:02,805
and you'll be in a fucking
cheap hotel room dead,

1108
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:03,973
you hear me?

1109
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:06,600
(Grunts)

1110
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,769
ERASMUS:
Fuck, man.

1111
01:11:09,103 --> 01:11:10,020
I'm a pacifist!

1112
01:11:10,312 --> 01:11:11,689
I'm a pacifist!

1113
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:13,315
Fuck.

1114
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:14,316
I'm not.

1115
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:17,778
You going somewhere?

1116
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:18,737
Babylon has fallen,

1117
01:11:18,821 --> 01:11:20,656
can't you see
it's the last days of Rome?

1118
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:27,538
You want to know what I see?

1119
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:32,918
I see a piece of shit
who's in way over his head

1120
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:34,336
who's gonna tell me
all about his girlfriend.

1121
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:35,963
Which one?

1122
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:37,673
You know which one.

1123
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:38,966
Fucking Star.

1124
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:40,843
Star's not my girlfriend,
you sperm-less testicle,

1125
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:42,177
she's my friend.

1126
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:44,763
Alright, women, I'm not a threat
to them, they trust me,

1127
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:46,515
they bare
their midnight fantasies,

1128
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:47,766
their hopes and dreams.

1129
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:50,144
(Grunts in pain)

1130
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:55,524
Alright, I'm telling you
that she was an angel! Star.

1131
01:11:55,816 --> 01:11:57,818
They should've called her
"The-Whole-fucking-Galaxy".

1132
01:11:57,902 --> 01:11:58,819
Who killed her?

1133
01:11:58,903 --> 01:12:00,863
It's not that simple, man.

1134
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:02,156
She was--
it's not that simple.

1135
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:04,450
She was blackmailing us--
them, them!

1136
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:06,118
That's not an admission
of guilt.

1137
01:12:06,202 --> 01:12:08,454
-She was blackmailing them.
-Who?

1138
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:10,206
I tried to stop her,
but she brought the others

1139
01:12:10,289 --> 01:12:11,290
-in on it.
-Who?

1140
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:12,875
All the girls, man.

1141
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,669
Persi used to run drugs
up from Mexico.

1142
01:12:15,753 --> 01:12:17,796
He had to find a way
to launder the money,

1143
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,964
so he got in the film business

1144
01:12:19,048 --> 01:12:20,674
and then he started
trafficking girls,

1145
01:12:20,758 --> 01:12:22,384
all the girls
who wanna be in his movies.

1146
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:24,511
Didn't ask for a fucking resume.

1147
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:26,430
Tell me who killed Star.

1148
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:28,724
ERASMUS:
Flosso, man.

1149
01:12:29,058 --> 01:12:31,769
They always used Flosso to keep
the girls in line.

1150
01:12:31,852 --> 01:12:33,062
Don't fucking lie to me.

1151
01:12:33,145 --> 01:12:34,772
-(Indistinct speech)
-Don't fucking lie to me.

1152
01:12:34,855 --> 01:12:37,233
Half the fucking precinct
is in it, man.

1153
01:12:37,316 --> 01:12:39,193
How you think they wear
such nice suits?

1154
01:12:39,276 --> 01:12:40,319
I want names.

1155
01:12:40,402 --> 01:12:42,947
Goddammit, Flosso is a name!

1156
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,406
Flosso is a name.

1157
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:52,206
Who ordered the hit?

1158
01:12:53,332 --> 01:12:54,333
Who ordered the hit!

1159
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:55,668
He'll kill me.

1160
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:57,169
I'll fucking kill you.

1161
01:12:57,253 --> 01:12:58,754
Who ordered the hit?

1162
01:12:59,129 --> 01:13:00,381
ERASMUS:
Freeman.

1163
01:13:00,673 --> 01:13:03,050
-Detective--
-Don't fucking lie to me, man.

1164
01:13:05,386 --> 01:13:07,555
ERASMUS:
I'm telling the truth, man.

1165
01:13:07,638 --> 01:13:09,557
I overheard him
and Persi talking.

1166
01:13:11,684 --> 01:13:14,436
It's-- it's not killing women
to them, man.

1167
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,981
It's more like clearing out
rotten inventory.

1168
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:20,025
Like difficult women
make bad hookers, man.

1169
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:23,404
And you were--
you were the perfect fall guy.

1170
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:24,780
You screwed everything up,
man.

1171
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:27,616
Now Flosso's in the wind
and they want us all dead.

1172
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:30,661
How are you involved?

1173
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:33,581
Me, I'm just a writer, man.

1174
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:34,707
I schedule the girls.

1175
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,667
I make sure
they have a good time.

1176
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,919
I take care of the girls,
that's it.

1177
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:40,337
And Vargas?

1178
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:42,339
You seen him around?

1179
01:13:42,423 --> 01:13:44,425
Freeman keeps him in the dark,
man.

1180
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:46,552
Vargas is the worst detective
in the city.

1181
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:48,762
(Cellphone ringing)

1182
01:13:48,888 --> 01:13:49,805
I'm going to my mom's.

1183
01:13:49,889 --> 01:13:51,181
I should have never left
Glendale.

1184
01:13:54,018 --> 01:13:55,060
Yeah.

1185
01:13:56,604 --> 01:13:57,688
Just pulled up.

1186
01:13:58,564 --> 01:13:59,815
What are you talking about?

1187
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,276
To the parlor.

1188
01:14:03,402 --> 01:14:06,155
Rent here on Melrose
must be outrageous.

1189
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:08,032
Wait, what?

1190
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:10,951
Jimmy, you just texted me
15 minutes ago

1191
01:14:11,035 --> 01:14:12,870
-saying to meet you here.
-No. No, hey run.

1192
01:14:13,037 --> 01:14:13,954
Get out of there.

1193
01:14:14,038 --> 01:14:15,039
Get the fuck out of there.

1194
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:16,665
(grunting)

1195
01:14:16,874 --> 01:14:18,542
JIMMY ON PHONE:
Hey? Hey!

1196
01:14:27,426 --> 01:14:29,261
(Cellphone ringing)

1197
01:14:30,763 --> 01:14:32,556
-JIMMY ON PHONE: Vargas?
-Hey, where are you, Jimmy?

1198
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:35,100
Freeman's mixed
into this for sure.

1199
01:14:35,184 --> 01:14:36,185
Yeah, fuck, I know that.

1200
01:14:36,268 --> 01:14:38,312
Look,
I just went to The Montello.

1201
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,731
They already handed over
their tapes to guess who?

1202
01:14:40,814 --> 01:14:41,774
Yeah.

1203
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:44,443
So listen, Star, she worked
the concession stand

1204
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:45,819
at this old movie theatre.

1205
01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:48,447
She sent an encrypted file
to her boss.

1206
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:51,367
Forensics, they're trying
to unlock it right now, okay.

1207
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:54,119
Hey, that source
I told you about,

1208
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:55,538
the preacher's daughter,

1209
01:14:55,913 --> 01:14:58,040
she somehow got a text
from my phone.

1210
01:14:58,332 --> 01:15:00,167
I was talking to her
when she was abducted.

1211
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:02,503
Hold on, okay.
We're gonna get an APB out.

1212
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:05,673
Also a bystander ID'd Flosso
leaving the scene

1213
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:07,758
where Star and her friends
were found.

1214
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:09,051
You understand that?

1215
01:15:09,677 --> 01:15:11,554
You speak to your captain
about the tapes?

1216
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:13,305
Look, I haven't talked
to anybody yet.

1217
01:15:13,389 --> 01:15:14,557
Where was she?

1218
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,975
She's right outside my shop.

1219
01:15:16,058 --> 01:15:17,059
Okay, listen,

1220
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:18,435
I'm gonna roll units over
right now.

1221
01:15:18,519 --> 01:15:19,812
Do not go inside, Jimmy.

1222
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:21,564
-You hear me?
-Oh no.

1223
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:22,982
Do not engage.

1224
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:24,108
Okay.

1225
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:27,069
Okay.

1226
01:15:28,946 --> 01:15:31,699

1227
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:06,942

VARGAS:
Cuff him.

(Indistinct radio chatter)

1239
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:34,191
Fuck you!

You alone?

1250
01:20:27,578 --> 01:20:29,205
-Yeah, what's going on?
-All right.

1251
01:20:29,288 --> 01:20:30,956
It's Freeman,
gotta bring him in.

1252
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,625
He's dirty.

1253
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:33,792
Just busted Flosso.

1254
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:35,628
He was trying to kill a witness.

1255
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:36,879
Got it?

1256
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:38,297

1261
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:22,675

(Gun blares)

1263
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,611
Where they take her?

1264

FLOSSO:
I don't know.

1265
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:47,992
I could drive this thing
into the Pacific,

1266
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:49,994
or you can give me an
exact address.

1267
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:00,880
You're gonna die anyways.

1268
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:05,467
Now you can lie to me,
I can make it real slow,

1269
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:09,763
or you can tell me the truth
and maybe I'll make it fast.

1270
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:11,724
Maybe.

1271
01:22:13,517 --> 01:22:15,436
I didn't want any of this.

1272
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,313
It was Freeman.

1273
01:22:18,147 --> 01:22:20,524
Fucking Freeman caught me
with a gram.

1274
01:22:20,649 --> 01:22:22,401
One gram.

1275
01:22:24,778 --> 01:22:26,697
Told me he'd get IA
to take my badge away

1276
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:29,617
and put me away for three years
if I didn't work for him.

1277
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:35,372
You killed Star?

1278
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,001
Yeah, I did.

1279
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,298
Where's Eleanor?

1280
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:48,594
San Diego.

1281
01:22:49,929 --> 01:22:54,475
They got a restaurant,
a fridge leads to a tunnel.

1282
01:22:56,227 --> 01:22:57,645
JIMMY:
What's this tunnel?

1283
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:04,818
The kind of tunnel that connects
San Diego with Tijuana.

1284
01:23:06,946 --> 01:23:08,447
Freeman runnin' the operation?

1285
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:09,698
FLOSSO:
Fuck no.

1286
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:13,285
It's some broker, Dr. Feelgood.

1287
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:16,497
He's a dangerous cat
though, man.

1288
01:23:16,622 --> 01:23:18,040
He's got eyes everywhere.

1289
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:21,710
-Hey.
-Hmm.

1290
01:23:22,086 --> 01:23:24,296
I tell you where they are,
I'll take you to 'em,

1291
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:27,174
you gotta let me go.

1292
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:30,177
It's a fair trade, right?

1293
01:23:33,055 --> 01:23:34,139
Yeah.

1294
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:36,350
Yeah.

1295
01:23:37,101 --> 01:23:38,185
Okay.

I do not work to your schedule,
detective.

1303
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,383
Where's Flosso?

1304
01:24:51,759 --> 01:24:55,262
As soon as we get safe,
he's next.

1305
01:24:55,512 --> 01:24:57,932
She's doped up
and ready for transport.

1306
01:24:58,766 --> 01:25:02,353
Buyers pay well
for American girls, age aside.

1307
01:25:02,603 --> 01:25:04,647
Just make sure I get my cut.

Fridge's in the back.

1312
01:25:42,768 --> 01:25:44,603
Now you're gonna let me go,
right?

1313
01:25:46,272 --> 01:25:47,648
Man of your word.

1314
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:52,611

You know the damage you've done?

I have an idea.

1332
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,537
I have a family.

But I just arrived.

Oh?

1376
01:33:40,871 --> 01:33:43,749
The theatre manager was such

1377
01:33:44,792 --> 01:33:46,710
Not like my new bosses.

1378
