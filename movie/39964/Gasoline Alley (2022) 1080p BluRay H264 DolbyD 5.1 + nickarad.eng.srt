00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:05,560
(♪♪♪)

00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:20,283
(Dog barking)

4
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:58,363
(Driller whirring)

00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:03,493
(♪♪♪)

00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:32,689
(Sirens wailing in distance)

(♪♪♪)

10
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:01,611
(Chair squeaks)

11
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,618
You got sad eyes.

12
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,790
Not my usual pick-up line, but...

13
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:19,671
I just sensed you are a man
running from shadows.

14
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,718
What's your usual pick-up line?

15
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:30,807
When I see a guy
alone at the bar

16
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,017
at 3:00 in the morning,

17
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:38,356
I lean in real close
and whisper in his ear:

18
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:43,027
"For 510 bucks,
we can spend an hour.

19
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:46,197
For 1,000,
we can spend a night."

20
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:49,492
Why 510?

21
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:55,999
'Cause the ATM
only spits out 20s.

22
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,420
I've never had a john ask me
to break a note.

23
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,591
That's actually smart.

24
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:10,680
So?

25
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,350
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

26
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:18,313

(Indistinct chatter)

30
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:24,087
See that?

31
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:32,470
(Grunts)

32
00:05:35,723 --> 00:05:36,891
FREEMAN:
Gasoline Alley...

33
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:38,351
Jimmy Jayne.

34
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:43,106
(♪♪♪)

35
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:00,623

(♪♪♪)

37
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:21,936
JIMMY:
You sure about this?

38
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,730
YOUNG WOMAN:
I'm sure, I'm sure.

39
00:06:26,065 --> 00:06:27,025
Okay.

40
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:38,953
Okay.

41
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:42,415
Who's Shelby?

42
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,043
She rocks my world.

43
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:46,795
You're a lucky gal.

44
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:48,838
Yeah, we both are.

45
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:50,173
Right there?

46
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:54,094
Hold on.

47
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:01,976
James Jayne?

48
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,436
Yeah.

49
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,355
That's what it says
on my license.

50
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:08,525
Detective Freeman.

51
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:10,527
This is Detective Vargas.

52
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:11,778
Hi.

53
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:12,987
JIMMY:
Okay.

54
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:16,366
Yeah, your old man
was on the force, wasn't he?

55
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,034
14th precinct.

56
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:20,703
Hmm, how's he doing?

57
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:24,124
I don't think
he's doing much of anything.

58
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:26,876
Spends his days
at the Fitzgerald Cemetery.

59
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,961
He was a good cop.

60
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:29,379
Damn good cop.

61
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:31,172
Always paid his tab.

62
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:34,300
Did you ever consider the force?

63
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:36,136
Yeah. You ever think about it?

64
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:38,471
No, never.

65
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:46,396
That's yours, right?

66
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,023
I mean, it's my shop's lighter.

67
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:50,108
Right.

68
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:54,028
James... sorry,
may I call you, "James"?

69
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:56,865
The reason that we're here
is we need to talk to you

70
00:07:56,948 --> 00:07:58,658
about the four dead girls.

71
00:07:58,742 --> 00:07:59,868
Okay?

72
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,745
What's that have to do with me?

73
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:05,123
The lighter,
it was found at the crime scene.

74
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:06,499
What's your point?

75
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,335
What was it doing there?

76
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,087
I don't know what it's fucking
doing there.

77
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:14,174
I once found my lighter floating
in a urinal at a Duke's.

78
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:17,552
Am I a suspect?

79
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:18,762
VARGAS: You were seen
with one of the victims

80
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:19,929
at Rocka's, okay.

81
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,431
Thing about Rocka's,

82
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,057
it's over on the other side
of town

83
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:24,684
and there are 100
good watering holes

84
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:25,935
in between here and there,
right?

85
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:26,895
Yeah.

86
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:29,105
Yeah, again, again,
what's your point?

87
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,859
My point is why drive
all the way over there

88
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:35,403
like I was saying,
it's a long ways away.

89
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,864
Sentimental reasons.

90
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:39,532
VARGAS:
Such as?

91
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,161
My mother used to work there.

92
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:45,955
Okay. Behind the bar?

93
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,415
No, not behind the bar.

94
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:48,708
Oh.

95
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,127
Uh, Jimmy, excuse my partner.

96
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:55,048
He still doesn't know what side
of the bed to wake up on.

97
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:56,007
VARGAS:
He's right.

98
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:57,425
We have some photos,

99
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:00,512
maybe you could uh, ID
some of the victims.

100
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:01,679
That'd be helpful.

101
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:03,598
Holy shit,
you don't even know their names.

102
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:06,851
James, we're gonna need to talk
to you in private, okay?

103
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,353
The sooner, the better.

104
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,231
All right, give me an hour.
I got a customer.

105
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:13,233
No, we need to talk to you
right now,

106
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:15,777
so the tramp stamp
will have to wait.

107
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:17,404
How you doin', darlin'?

108
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,155
What you gonna get, a unicorn?

109
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,281
(Chuckles)

110
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,745
(♪♪♪)

111
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:35,130
FREEMAN:
I hope you can be discrete.

112
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:40,343
Last thing we need
is a media circus.

113
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:43,388
Yeah, he's right,
'cause if that happens,

114
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,807
then the D.A.,
he puts pressure on us

115
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,893
to pin it on some poor schmuck.

116
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,438
All right. I'll go ahead
and get started, right, boss?

117
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:53,106
- Yes.
- Okay.

118
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:56,818
For the record,
I'm Detective Vargas.

119
00:09:57,277 --> 00:09:58,611
That's Detective Freeman.

120
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:00,155
And we're conducting
an interview

121
00:10:00,238 --> 00:10:06,161
with Mr. James Jayne
concerning case V-7-7-4-3.

122
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:07,746
They suffer?

123
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:09,080
What do you think?

124
00:10:09,164 --> 00:10:10,540
I think it's a fair
fucking question,

125
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:11,750
that's what I think.

126
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,043
Yeah, they suffered.

127
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:17,756
I imagine
you already questioned

128
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,549
the guests, staff?

129
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:22,218
Since 5:00 a.m. this morning.

130
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:24,262
63 rooms.

131
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:26,514
VARGAS:
Yeah, nobody suspicious.

132
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:30,560
Nobody caught our attention,
except you.

133
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:33,772
Security cameras?

134
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:36,441
They didn't have any
at the rat trap

135
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:37,442
they found 'em at,

136
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:39,694
but they're on camera
leaving the bar.

137
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:42,155
Then you're on camera
a few seconds later

138
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:44,365
following 'em out the door.

139
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,451
I had a drink, and I left.

140
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:47,535
FREEMAN:
What time?

141
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:49,996
2:30. Give or take.

142
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,873
Talk to anybody
while you were there?

143
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:54,250
JIMMY:
Yeah.

144
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:55,627
VARGAS:
What were you doing there?

145
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,295
(Sighs) I was fucking guys.

146
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:59,464
- FREEMAN: Easy.
- It's just juries,

147
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:02,634
they don't look real favorably
on uncooperative witnesses.

148
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,053
- Right?
- Right.

149
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:06,888
Look, why don't you just
show me the pictures?

150
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:08,431
'Cause something tells me
somebody told you

151
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:10,058
I was with the girls that night.

152
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,643
You want to see the pictures?

153
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,645
Sure,
we'll show you the pictures.

154
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,524
Pretty sordid.

155
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,652
Let me just start back
at the beginning here.

156
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,195
Here we go.

157
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,781
Huh, pretty gnarly, right?

158
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:26,074
Gnarly?

159
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:27,826
Recognize any of them?

160
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:33,873
Boom, boom, boom,
what you think?

161
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,126
That's pretty bad.

162
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,377
JIMMY:
Go back.

163
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:41,631
- That's Star.
- VARGAS: Huh.

164
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:43,716
JIMMY: That's what she told me
her name was.

165
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,760
You ever seen
these girls before?

166
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:48,763
Not before last night.

167
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:52,016
You talked to Star,
what about?

168
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,893
- Business.
- What?

169
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:56,312
- Business.
- Tattoos or movies?

170
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:57,814
JIMMY:
She was an actor.

171
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,774
Aspiring actor.

172
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:02,318
Am I the only suspect?

173
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:04,279
FREEMAN:
Person of interest.

174
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:08,408
VARGAS: So Star, I'm assuming
she was a working girl.

175
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:09,784
Yeah.

176
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,703
Did she make you an offer?

177
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:14,330
JIMMY:
Of course she did.

178
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:15,665
VARGAS:
Did you take her up on it?

179
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:17,000
Or did you try and bargain
with her?

180
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,960
Maybe when you tried
to bargain with her,

181
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:21,129
you kind of made her feel
a little cheap...

182
00:12:21,212 --> 00:12:22,088
JIMMY:
Fucking what?

183
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:23,923
VARGAS: Then she said
something nasty, who knows?

184
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:25,800
Maybe that hurt your feelings,
and then you thought,

185
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:26,843
"Hey, I'm really gonna let her have it."

186
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:28,636
- (Overlapping speech)
- Double fucking talk.

187
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:30,221
Did you hook up with her?

188
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:35,059
No. I told her I was meeting
with somebody after.

189
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:36,603
FREEMAN:
And who is that?

190
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:39,063
This girl I run around with. Christine.

191
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:41,107
- Okay.
- Are we done here?

192
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:43,568
No. So I'm just trying to get
all this straight in my head,

193
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:45,070
- maybe you can help me, boss?
- Yeah.

194
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:48,073
- So the bar, it closes at 2:30.
- FREEMAN: Right.

195
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:50,575
VARGAS: That gives you 45 minutes
to kill 'em.

196
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:51,701
Stage 'em.

197
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:55,163
Then mosey on over
to this Christine girl.

198
00:12:55,622 --> 00:12:57,999
And you asked,
"Did they suffer?"

199
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,459
Their necks were broken.

200
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,710
All four of 'em.

201
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:02,796
Of course,
that's not real difficult.

202
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,257
When you got poor helpless girls
all whacked out on

203
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:09,677
junk and blow,
God knows what else.

204
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:13,139
Now the only
suspect description we got

205
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:16,226
is of a Caucasian shitkicker.

206
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:18,311
You seen any of those lately?

207
00:13:20,647 --> 00:13:21,940
Get the fuck out of my shop.

208
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:23,566
I actually think we're done here

209
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,819
and we probably don't need
to tell you this,

210
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:29,364
but don't leave the country,
hell, don't leave the county.

211
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:31,241
We can haul you in
on a Ramey warrant

212
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:32,367
anytime, okay.

213
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,203
So yeah, you're still a suspect,
got it?

214
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:37,747
Don't worry,
if you get found guilty,

215
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:40,333
we'll walk you down
to the electric chair ourselves.

216
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:41,668
It's like that
old gospel number,

217
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:43,169
You'll Never Walk Alone.

218
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:44,170
Let's hit it, boss.

219
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:45,547
Good talking to you.

220
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,262
Nice spot.

221
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,103
(♪♪♪)

222
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:03,440
(Grunts)
Fuck!

223
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:12,574
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

224
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:17,370
Christine.

225
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:18,997
Hey.

226
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:22,792
One sec, come here.

227
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:29,632
You get my text?

228
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:33,970
Cops calling on me at work
ain't a good look, Jimmy.

229
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:37,432
They wanted to confirm you
were on your way to see me

230
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:38,725
last night.

231
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:41,686
What'd you say?

232
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,229
I told 'em, yeah.

233
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,524
The bald one,
he thought I'd be all bent

234
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:49,194
about you flirting
with those poor girls.

235
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:52,947
I told 'em, nah,
it ain't like that.

236
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:57,327
He flirts with everybody,
that's what makes him Jimmy.

237
00:14:58,453 --> 00:14:59,788
Attagirl.

238
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:01,372
The other one,

239
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:04,793
he acts all best friends
bonding shit,

240
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:07,504
wasn't shy about doing
a little flirting himself.

241
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:10,090
Fuckin' asshole.

242
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,760
(Laughter, chatter
in background)

243
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,029
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

244

Whoa, whoa.

245
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:36,324
- Oh God.

00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:45,383
when I was in there.

327
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:50,013
I bet your friends think
you're tough

328
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:53,641
doing three months hard time
for a fucking DUI or whatever.

329
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,270
I wonder what they'd say
if they find out

330
00:20:57,353 --> 00:20:59,105
you cried yourself
to sleep every night

331
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:01,483
worried Kratos from Cell Block E
was gonna make you

332
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:03,234
his little fucking bitch.

333
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,278
I'm grateful
that you fucked him up for me.

334
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:08,406
How grateful?

335
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:12,452
Anything for a friend, Jimmy.

336
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:15,121
Got your kit?

337
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:16,331
Yeah.

338
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:17,332
Okay.

339
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:19,209
Yeah, all right.
Come on.

340
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:29,260
Heard they're already planning
a rip-off episode

341
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:30,303
about the dead girls.

342
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:31,596
Bullshit.

343
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,889
I swear to God.

344
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:35,934
The writer's PA with the fat ass
told me last night.

345
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:37,227
That is tasteless.

346
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:39,896
I knew one of 'em.

347
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,439
From where?

348
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,900
Some party.

349
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:45,568
Whose?

350
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:48,947
Persi Muleeney, something.

351
00:21:49,364 --> 00:21:51,324
Get the fuck outta here.
That's a made-up name.

352
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:53,493
I swear to God, man,
she was all over me.

353
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,495
What was her name?

354
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:57,455
BOURKE: She didn't tell me
her real name.

355
00:21:58,248 --> 00:21:59,457
Don't tell me.

356
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:00,959
"If you forget..."

357
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,252
BOURKE:
"...you just gotta look up."

358
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:03,753
- JIMMY: Yeah.
- BOURKE: You knew Star?

359
00:22:03,837 --> 00:22:04,963
Briefly.

360
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:07,715
Tell me about the guy
running the party.

361
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,343
BOURKE: Persi? I... I didn't know
it was his party.

362
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:13,430
Finds girls on OnlyFans
and Craigslist,

363
00:22:13,513 --> 00:22:15,682
turns 'em into porn stars
and escorts.

364
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:17,976
They float around the scene
for a little bit

365
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:19,894
then they just disappear,
that's all I know.

366
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,312
What do you mean disappear?

367
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:23,064
BOURKE: I mean they go back
to bumfuck Idaho

368
00:22:23,148 --> 00:22:24,441
wherever the hell
they came from.

369
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,111
Man, this J-bird
fucking with you?

370
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:30,280
No, man, we're all right,
aren't we?

371
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:33,616
- Are we?
- Yeah, we're good.

372
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:34,909
BOURKE:
This is Jimmy Jayne.

373
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:36,578
This guy's a motherfucking
legend right here.

374
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:37,829
- True genius.
- Pleasure to meet you.

375
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:39,998
Oh, so you guys inside together?

376
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:42,167
- How'd you know?
- Come on, man.

377
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,169
'Cause all your other friends
that come here,

378
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:45,462
look like Ken dolls.

379
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,921
No offense.

380
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:48,089
BOURKE: Yeah, fucking right
we were in.

381
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:49,841
This dude did half the art
in San Quentin.

382
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:51,092
Why don't you tell him
about the time

383
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:52,802
I fucked up Kratos in the yard?

384
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:54,095
You know the story.

385
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:58,141
Yeah, I remember that, sure.

386
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:02,562
He was uh... he was fresh meat.

387
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:04,439
Wouldn't let anybody
fuck with him, so he beat a man

388
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:07,150
unconscious on his first night
with his bare hands.

389
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:08,818
Yeah.

390
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:10,195
Bullshit.

391
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:13,156
- That's a fucking lie.
- It's a lie.

392
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:14,866
ROY:
Hey, but you're a great friend

393
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:17,077
to try to make this
punk-ass look good.

394
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,828
Hey, you can't talk to me
like that, bro.

395
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:20,121
You're a fucking set mechanic.

396
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:21,623
I'm number one
on the call sheet, all right.

397
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:23,917
Calm down, kid. Calm down.

398
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,337
You took this gig for money
just like everybody else.

399
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,755
We're making art, all right.

400
00:23:28,838 --> 00:23:29,923
- Art?
- Yeah.

401
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:33,927
This show makes a dumpster fire
look like <i>Citizen Kane</i>.

402
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:35,678
Yeah, well, this show
is number one in the country,

403
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:36,930
we are number one.

404
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:39,891
That says more about society
than the quality of your show.

405
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:42,310
Hey, listen,
I have a 66 Chevelle

406
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:43,937
that's got a bum clutch.

407
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:45,855
- You got a card?
- Yeah.

408
00:23:47,357 --> 00:23:49,859
- Here man, call me anytime.
- Thank you.

409
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:51,277
- You guys good?
- Yes, sir.

410
00:23:53,071 --> 00:23:54,656
Where you wanna do this?

411
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:56,908
Well, I want 1-1-7 right here.

412
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:59,244
It's how many people watched
last week's episode.

413
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:00,537
117?

414
00:24:00,745 --> 00:24:02,205
Million, yeah.

415
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:04,916
I know, I can't believe people
pay to watch this shit either.

416
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:06,251
Let's go in my trailer.

417
00:24:11,506 --> 00:24:12,590
FILM CREW MEMBER 1:
Action!

418
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:13,842
(Thud)

419
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:17,762
- Dennis!
- Hey, dude.

420
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:19,848
Dennis, up!

421
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:20,932
Oh, shoot!

422
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:25,854
(Gun blaring)
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

423
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,609
(♪♪♪)

424
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:05,393
Hi.

425
00:25:06,394 --> 00:25:07,604
Now what?

426
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:10,440
Well, found your fingerprints
on your lighter.

427
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:11,941
JIMMY:
Who'd have thought?

428
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:12,942
And?

429
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:15,862
We got motive, we got access,

430
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:20,158
and we're one hair follicle away
from writing your warrant.

431
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:22,285
How'd you find me?

432
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:25,163
VARGAS: You got a GPS
in your pocket, buddy.

433
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:26,372
(Vargas chuckling)

434
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:27,916
You need a warrant
to track a phone.

435
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:30,418
You know you're actually correct
about that.

436
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:33,254
But the thing is judges
these days, they're real busy

437
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:34,631
and they know
we're the good guys.

438
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:36,508
So they kinda let it slide.

439
00:25:36,716 --> 00:25:39,886
Now, you gonna offer me
a cigarette or what?

440
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:44,057
No, it's cool, I actually quit.
Here's the deal.

441
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:46,851
Everybody I talk to
across the board,

442
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:49,312
they all say
you're a stand-up guy,

443
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:51,147
except for the five years
in the pen

444
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:53,358
for putting a guy
in a wheelchair.

445
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:57,153
I didn't start that fight.

446
00:25:57,237 --> 00:25:59,364
But you sure ended it,
didn't you?

447
00:25:59,948 --> 00:26:01,991
And I bet you'd do it
all over again.

448
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,121
Came at me with a screwdriver.

449
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:08,540
Screwdriver.
Shit, that's a deadly weapon.

450
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:13,628
You know a guy named Persi?

451
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:15,213
I don't remember his last name.

452
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:16,714
Fucking Persi something,
whatever.

453
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:18,091
Why?

454
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:20,176
Used to run with Star.

455
00:26:20,385 --> 00:26:22,095
You playing detective now?

456
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:25,390
Just concerned citizen.

457
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:27,142
I like that.

458
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,272
You know, uh, I found out
why you hang out at Rocka's bar.

459
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,861
Should have just told me
your mom was a working gal.

460
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:39,112
There's no shame in it.

461
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:42,157
Detective Freeman,
he told me that was her spot

462
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,409
until, you know,
she went missing.

463
00:26:44,617 --> 00:26:45,869
And of course, your dad,

464
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:48,079
he lost his mind
trying to find her.

465
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:50,206
I'm just saying, you know,
I... I get it.

466
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,418
I understand why you feel
so connected to the case.

467
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:56,463
Sure do have a way with words.

468
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:59,132
Hey pal, James, Jimmy,

469
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:00,884
I uh... you know,
that's as close

470
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:03,219
as you're gonna get
to an apology from me.

471
00:27:03,678 --> 00:27:07,056
Yeah, fine, well...
I have to go.

472
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:09,142
Just, hey, take it easy.

473
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:10,602
Let us do our thing.

474
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:12,854
Detective Freeman,
he's a great cop

475
00:27:12,937 --> 00:27:15,774
and me, I'm the best thing
that ever happened

476
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:17,692
to the Robbery-Homicide Unit.

477
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,321
How many cases
you close last year?

478
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:23,156
You want my numbers now?
You want my stats?

479
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:25,116
I mean, if they were any good,
you'd be squawking about 'em.

480
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,451
Oh, come on.

481
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:28,745
You speak to Star's family?

482
00:27:29,662 --> 00:27:30,997
Tell 'em what happened?

483
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:33,583
Well, they disowned her
a long time ago,

484
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:35,794
but they're raising her kid
as their own.

485
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:38,797
How old?

486
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:42,133
4. Actually the same age
as my boy Terry.

487
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:48,890
James, just don't go kicking
the hornet's nest.

488
00:27:48,973 --> 00:27:49,849
'Course not.

489
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,810
- You understand?
- Yes.

490
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:53,645
Okay. I'll catch you later.

491
00:27:54,312 --> 00:27:57,148
(♪♪♪)

492
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,751
(Engine rumbling)

493
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:20,547
(♪♪♪)

494
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:31,034
(Gun blares)

495
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:32,827
(Car revving)

496
00:29:34,704 --> 00:29:36,998
(♪♪♪)

497
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,544
(Gun blares)

498
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,958
(Gun blares)

499
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:23,229
(Engine rumbling)

500
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:26,816
(♪♪♪)

501
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:29,379
(♪♪♪)

502
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:50,400
ROY:
Hey man, don't fuck that paint.

503
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,652
I can't be assed with an
L & D form.

504
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,529
(Cellphone ringing)

505
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:56,905
You got Roy.

506
00:32:57,157 --> 00:32:59,617
Roy, it's Jimmy.

507
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:01,619
I met you on set.

508
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:03,121
<i>Hey, buddy, what's going on?</i>

509
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:05,664
<i>Someone tried to run me down
just now.</i>

510
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:07,625
No shit.
Someone tried to kill you?

511
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:09,461
<i>Yeah.</i> (Indistinct speech)

512
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:10,753
<i>That's not
what makes it personal,</i>

513
00:33:10,878 --> 00:33:12,838
so much as they fucked up
my ride.

514
00:33:13,088 --> 00:33:14,382
<i>Holy shit, man!</i>

515
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:15,759
<i>You know who it was?</i>

516
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:18,052
If I did, I wouldn't say so
on the phone.

517
00:33:19,012 --> 00:33:21,639
You know what, it's nothing.

518
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,309
It don't sound like nothing
to me, man,

519
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:27,020
but what's it like to be you?

520
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:29,105
<i>It was a Rover Wagon.
It was super charged.</i>

521
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:30,981
<i>Had some real fucking
balls to it.</i>

522
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:33,943
Still not the smartest way
to try to kill somebody.

523
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:36,738
<i>Yeah, maybe they're smarter
than you think, man.</i>

524
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:40,325
Random ex-con cut down
on the side of the road?

525
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:41,492
Who'd give a shit?

526
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:44,119
Yeah, that's one way to put it,
I guess.

527
00:33:44,496 --> 00:33:46,998
<i>Rover's a lot bigger
than a bullet though, bro.</i>

528
00:33:47,082 --> 00:33:49,250
Oh no, they came at me
with those, too.

529
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:51,419
Listen...

530
00:33:53,004 --> 00:33:56,716
I got this feeling that
you might be able to uh,

531
00:33:57,258 --> 00:33:59,219
you know, get me
some sort of protection.

532
00:33:59,302 --> 00:34:00,428
<i>You know what I'm talking about?</i>

533
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:02,305
10-4, good buddy.

534
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:05,350
I know you're a kindred soul
of the heathen brethren.

535
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,186
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

536
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:09,729
Of course it's a yes, man.

537
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:10,980
Send me the address.

538
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:12,982
I'll text it to you.

539
00:34:16,694 --> 00:34:18,488
VARGAS:
So this doesn't add up.

540
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:22,075
How does Jimmy go
from felony assault

541
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:23,827
to multiple homicides?

542
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,996
I don't get it.

543
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:28,957
- The old days...
- Yeah.

544
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,001
You told me about, you'd just
taken a telephone book to 'em.

545
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:33,503
Now I gotta actually
question people

546
00:34:33,586 --> 00:34:35,755
- and go fucking by the book.
- Right.

547
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:36,965
(Vargas chuckles)

548
00:34:37,048 --> 00:34:38,299
- Yeah.
- Pain in the ass.

549
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:41,970
- Well...
- Mhmm.

550
00:34:42,137 --> 00:34:43,555
I guess I'll take care
of this here,

551
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:45,432
- you gonna hit the game?
- Yeah.

552
00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:46,641
VARGAS:
Who is it this week?

553
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:48,726
- Malibu.
- Right.

554
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,645
If they don't beat them,
who can they beat?

555
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:51,729
- Yeah.
- (Chuckles)

556
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,064
Exactly.

557
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:56,568
I'll take care of this,
all right.

558
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:58,069
- All right.
- I got it.

559
00:34:58,445 --> 00:34:59,779
I hope they win.

560
00:35:07,162 --> 00:35:08,163
(Sighs)

561
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,501
I didn't think you'd show.

562
00:35:13,877 --> 00:35:16,880
Every brother needs a keeper
from time to time.

563
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:18,923
Are you sure you want this?

564
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:22,385
I got someone trying to pin
a bunch of murders on me.

565
00:35:23,261 --> 00:35:24,429
I'm not going back inside,

566
00:35:24,512 --> 00:35:26,431
especially not for something
I didn't do.

567
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:28,558
Easy, new friend, easy.

568
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:30,143
The fuck am I into?

569
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:32,353
Show business, son.

570
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:35,273
It's the most gangster game
out there.

571
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:36,733
You got family?

572
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:39,235
No, not since my dad died.

573
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:40,737
Hmm, how'd he go?

574
00:35:41,738 --> 00:35:42,989
Bottle.

575
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:44,282
Hmm.

576
00:35:44,365 --> 00:35:45,950
Come here, let's do this.

577
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:56,377
Your dad teach you how to shoot?

578
00:35:58,004 --> 00:35:58,922
All right.

579
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,800
You got six rounds in there.

580
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:06,596
There you go.

581
00:36:11,643 --> 00:36:13,228
How much do I owe you?

582
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:14,813
Nothing, man.

583
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:16,564
Just a favor down the line.

584
00:36:17,565 --> 00:36:18,650
All right.

585
00:36:19,442 --> 00:36:20,485
Anytime.

586
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:22,112
Yeah, I'll hold you to that.

587
00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:24,697
But you be careful, man.

588
00:36:26,116 --> 00:36:27,867
- See you.
- Thank you.

589
00:36:39,337 --> 00:36:42,340
(♪♪♪)

590
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:02,902
(Sighs)

591
00:37:15,123 --> 00:37:17,167
I may have to get out of town.

592
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,918
We should go somewhere.

593
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,755
Huh, I got that ticket
to Berlin, baby.

594
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:25,133
What ticket?

595
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:27,093
I didn't tell you?

596
00:37:29,095 --> 00:37:30,722
I would have remembered.

597
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:32,557
I'm leaving Monday.

598
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:35,852
Sandy is there as an au pair,

599
00:37:36,895 --> 00:37:39,856
we'll hang,
I hear it's a good scene.

600
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:42,984
Berlin?

601
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:45,737
It's in Germany.

602
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:48,698
Yeah.

603
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:52,452
(Chuckles)

604
00:37:54,037 --> 00:37:56,122
You live in the moment, Jimmy.

605
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,376
Yeah.

606
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:10,970
Fucking Berlin.

607
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:12,430
(Chuckles)

608
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:33,243
(Slurping)

609
00:38:45,296 --> 00:38:46,297
Jimmy Jayne.

610
00:38:46,381 --> 00:38:47,340
What's up, buddy?

611
00:38:47,424 --> 00:38:49,342
- How you doing?
- Good.

612
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:51,344
I need a favor.

613
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:54,597
(Scoffs)

614
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:56,433
You know I can't get back
into the evidence locker.

615
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:57,475
They won't let me back there.

616
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,144
- It's not that kind of favor.
- What is it?

617
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:01,438
I need you to run a name
through IVIS.

618
00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:05,650
What's the name?

619
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:06,901
Oh fuck.

620
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:09,112
Uh...

621
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,782
Peter Mul...

622
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,201
Persi Mul, something or other.

623
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:17,245
Mul something.
What is that?

624
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,497
Persi Muleeney?

625
00:39:19,664 --> 00:39:20,832
That's it.

626
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:22,041
(Scoffs)

627
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:23,752
Man, he lives up on Mulholland.

628
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:25,670
He's got an office down
on Skid Row.

629
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:26,671
You know him?

630
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:28,131
Yeah, everybody knows him.

631
00:39:28,214 --> 00:39:29,632
He's a popular guy.

632
00:39:30,008 --> 00:39:31,509
Give me a current address.

633
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:33,052
(Pete sighs)

634
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:34,554
Look, man, is this something
that's gonna come back

635
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:36,347
- and bite me in the ass?
- No, never.

636
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:37,682
- Yeah.
- Absolutely not.

637
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,768
Yeah, I believe you again, huh?

638
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:44,522
Look, man, you know
I'll lie on the stand, right,

639
00:39:44,606 --> 00:39:46,024
say you had a gun to my head.

640
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:49,360
That's why I love you, brother.

641
00:39:49,944 --> 00:39:51,571
You really are LA's finest,
huh?

642
00:39:51,863 --> 00:39:53,073
Aww, that's sweet.
Fuck you, too.

643
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:54,324
(Jimmy chuckles)

644
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:56,076
Can you tell me
what he's driving?

645
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:06,669
Seems his 2011 Land Rover
was reported stolen yesterday.

646
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,269
You didn't get that from me.

647
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:28,650
He's having a party
up at his place tonight.

648
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:31,820
Lot of cops gonna be there,
'cause we get in free.

649
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:33,488
Yeah.

650
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:36,032
Seems he knows what lives
matter most.

651
00:40:38,118 --> 00:40:39,327
All right.

652
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:41,454
Stay lucky, buddy.

653
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:44,624
Next time have the decency
to buy me a fucking coffee.

654
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,127
(♪♪♪)

655
00:40:58,304 --> 00:41:00,306
(Car engine revving)

656
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:22,746
KAISER:
Private party tonight.

657
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:24,748
I'm on the list.

658
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,376
You a cop?

659
00:41:30,003 --> 00:41:31,921
Yeah, 14th.

660
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:35,717
Where's your badge?

661
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:37,719
It's in the car.

662
00:41:39,554 --> 00:41:40,764
(Sighs)

663
00:41:45,977 --> 00:41:48,605
(♪♪♪)

664
00:42:27,352 --> 00:42:30,230
(♪♪♪)

665
00:43:08,393 --> 00:43:09,727
(Water splashes)

666
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,868
STAR:
<i>Want to hear a bad joke?</i>

667
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:27,579
A bad joke?

668
00:43:27,662 --> 00:43:29,205
A really bad one.

669
00:43:30,957 --> 00:43:32,333
(Jimmy chuckles)

670
00:43:34,002 --> 00:43:35,962
I do want to hear a bad joke.

671
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:37,088
Shoot.

672
00:43:38,131 --> 00:43:42,343
What are the three words
to ruin man's ego?

673
00:43:43,553 --> 00:43:45,680
What are the three words
to ruin a man's ego?

674
00:43:49,476 --> 00:43:50,769
Is it in?

675
00:43:52,645 --> 00:43:55,315
(♪♪♪)

676
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,329
(♪♪♪)

677
00:44:42,737 --> 00:44:45,490
(♪♪♪)

678
00:45:17,772 --> 00:45:20,734
(♪♪♪)

679
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,800
(Snorting)

680
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,721
(Sniffles)

681
00:45:49,804 --> 00:45:50,972
PERSI:
So it's like '88, '89.

682
00:45:51,055 --> 00:45:53,808
We're driving to Barstow
like 3:00 in the morning, right.

683
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:58,021
We're sweating like bullets,
and we run out of cocaine

684
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:01,441
and I mean me and Tai,
we're sweating. We're sitt-

685
00:46:01,524 --> 00:46:02,984
Only thing I know is
we're gonna go meet

686
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:04,569
a one-armed dope dealer
with a good...

687
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:07,739
Yo. You Persi?

688
00:46:08,615 --> 00:46:10,450
I don't even know your name,
friend?

689
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:11,701
Jimmy Jayne.

690
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,495
Mind if I have a minute?

691
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:15,121
Mind if I have a...
Yeah, well, I mind.

692
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,082
I'm sitting here telling a story
to all my friends.

693
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,792
Is this about a job
or something?

694
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,127
Yeah, I'm sorry.

695
00:46:22,128 --> 00:46:23,296
Go ahead, finish your story.

696
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:25,298
You were with a couple of dudes
or something?

697
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:27,592
So it's Barstow. Three-

698
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:31,346
Barstow! Holy shit,
I love Barstow.

699
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:32,472
You do, you love...

700
00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:34,808
They had the swap meet
down there, you ever been?

701
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:35,934
I been to Barstow,

702
00:46:36,017 --> 00:46:37,227
I never been
to a fucking swap meet.

703
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,937
- Street rods mostly.
- Yeah.

704
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,146
JIMMY:
I'm sorry.

705
00:46:41,106 --> 00:46:42,899
Go on. Finish your story.

706
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:45,735
It's like 3:00 in the morning,
going into Barstow...

707
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:46,694
JIMMY:
Wait, wait, wait.

708
00:46:46,778 --> 00:46:47,654
Going into the Torches Motel...

709
00:46:47,737 --> 00:46:49,447
JIMMY: Wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

710
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:50,532
You're ruining my story.

711
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:54,244
One thing,
they got this red-headed mayor,

712
00:46:54,702 --> 00:46:58,039
I'm fucking telling you,
she's got big fucking tits.

713
00:46:58,164 --> 00:47:00,834
And man, she loves to ride.

714
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:02,127
She loves to ride, huh?

715
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,087
Who the fuck invited you
to my party?

716
00:47:05,046 --> 00:47:06,297
I invited me.

717
00:47:06,965 --> 00:47:08,633
I was hoping to have a minute
in private,

718
00:47:08,716 --> 00:47:10,718
but suit yourself.

719
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:17,851
Gisella, Lana, and Star.

720
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,353
You ever heard
those names before?

721
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,105
I'll give you a hint.

722
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,190
They're not fucking race horses.

723
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:26,401
Kaiser, get this motherfucker
out of here.

724
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:27,819
JIMMY:
Hold on, Kaiser.

725
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:29,571
You ever met 'em?

726
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:31,197
No, I can't say I have.

727
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:34,117
You like jokes?

728
00:47:34,325 --> 00:47:35,493
Yeah, who don't like
a fucking joke.

729
00:47:35,577 --> 00:47:37,162
If this is a joke,
I don't find it funny.

730
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:39,038
JIMMY: I'ma tell you...
I'ma tell you a joke.

731
00:47:40,582 --> 00:47:42,709
Three words to ruin a man's ego?

732
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:43,668
"Is it in?"

733
00:47:43,752 --> 00:47:44,961
Now get the fuck out.

734
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:47,756
You heard that one before.

735
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,549
Yeah, I heard,
I'm the one who wrote it.

736
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:51,718
'Cause this girl told it
to me the other night.

737
00:47:51,801 --> 00:47:52,927
PERSI:
What girl?

738
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:55,054
Same girl
you said you never met.

739
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,055
She heard it in my movie.

740
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,016
I just told you,
David Cop-A-Feel. It's...

741
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:00,977
Anybody who watches pornos,
watch... knows the fucking line.

742
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,936
It's famous.

743
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,521
Now get the fuck out of here!

744
00:48:04,105 --> 00:48:05,398
Of course it is.

745
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:07,358
Night, guys.

746
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:11,446
Is that coke?

747
00:48:13,281 --> 00:48:14,616
And they're fucking passed out?

748
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:16,367
PERSI:
Yeah, I got fucking coke.

749
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:18,369
JIMMY:
Can I rip a line of blow?

750
00:48:18,536 --> 00:48:19,704
You get the fuck
out of my house,

751
00:48:19,788 --> 00:48:20,914
you can't have none!

752
00:48:22,582 --> 00:48:24,250
Oh to be you, huh.

753
00:48:25,877 --> 00:48:27,545
Small dick motherfucker.

754
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:41,559
- You really a cop?
- No.

755
00:48:48,983 --> 00:48:51,778
I seen them here, those girls.

756
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:54,864
Come with a sista I knows.

757
00:48:55,824 --> 00:48:57,325
Eleanor Rogers.

758
00:48:57,951 --> 00:49:01,162
She's one, uh,
20 feet from stardom types.

759
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:03,581
Backup singer.

760
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:04,999
Preacher's daughter.

761
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:09,754
Why you telling me this?

762
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:14,217
The fuck?
Motherfucker, I'm telling you.

763
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:16,010
Leave it at that.

764
00:49:16,094 --> 00:49:17,470
Get the fuck outta here.

765
00:49:19,681 --> 00:49:20,890
Thanks.

766
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:26,855
(Car engine rumbling)

767
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:39,826
(♪♪♪)

768
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:22,077
(Indistinct singing)

769
00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:37,967
(Humming)

770
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:48,978
That was you singing, huh?

771
00:50:50,522 --> 00:50:51,773
Guilty.

772
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:55,944
It's a recording studio?

773
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,160
I'm looking for Miss Rogers.

774
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,162
Miss Eleanor Rogers.

775
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:07,789
Why?

776
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:11,626
Our mutual friend Kaiser says
we should talk.

777
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:13,711
About?

778
00:51:14,712 --> 00:51:16,464
About something
we're both involved in,

779
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:17,465
we shouldn't be.

780
00:51:23,596 --> 00:51:25,557
I'll be at Shay's on 3rd, okay.

781
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,642
Hey, you got a light?

782
00:51:28,977 --> 00:51:30,270
Yeah.

783
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:38,403
Don't lose it.

784
00:51:39,446 --> 00:51:41,614
There's already enough
of those floating around.

785
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:51,249
ELEANOR:
You don't mean Persi Muleeney?

786
00:51:51,332 --> 00:51:54,043
Nah, he ain't got it in him
to murder any girls like that.

787
00:51:54,127 --> 00:51:55,253
He ain't that slick.

788
00:51:56,254 --> 00:51:59,090
But he knows some fucking cats
doing some fucked up shit.

789
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,009
What cats?

790
00:52:01,676 --> 00:52:03,470
He likes to strut
with a scary crowd

791
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,013
with his tail all up in the air.

792
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:06,931
But as much as he likes to be
on this gangsta shit,

793
00:52:07,015 --> 00:52:10,268
they just take his money
and laugh at his dumb white ass.

794
00:52:10,351 --> 00:52:11,603
Drug people?

795
00:52:11,686 --> 00:52:12,604
Fuck yeah.

796
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:14,439
Cartel hookup.

797
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:15,607
Why's someone like you
hanging out

798
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,400
with someone shady like Persi?

799
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,527
Someone like me?

800
00:52:21,654 --> 00:52:23,156
He told me
he'd put up all kinds of money

801
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:24,949
to help me put out a solo album.

802
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:26,743
And did he?

803
00:52:28,328 --> 00:52:29,412
No.

804
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:32,207
Said if I could fuck like
I could sing...

805
00:52:34,793 --> 00:52:36,377
Well, I'm not even gonna
tell you the rest of that

806
00:52:36,461 --> 00:52:37,837
'cause I don't want
my father's ghost

807
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,172
hearing that
come out of my mouth.

808
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:43,093
Persi said
he never met the girls.

809
00:52:43,176 --> 00:52:45,428
Oh, honey, no, no, he lied.

810
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:47,430
What else?

811
00:52:48,056 --> 00:52:51,059
Those girls, I mean,
oh my God,

812
00:52:51,893 --> 00:52:54,395
the way they were found
like that, I mean,

813
00:52:54,479 --> 00:52:56,314
that was somebody sending
a message.

814
00:52:56,397 --> 00:52:57,982
You said that wasn't
Persi's style.

815
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,025
No, no.

816
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,778
I think it was...
it was like those people

817
00:53:01,861 --> 00:53:03,488
I was talking about earlier,

818
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:06,533
the ones that likes to use
Persi's house like it's theirs.

819
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:07,867
"Scary crowd".

820
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:09,828
Shit, you ain't heard this
from me.

821
00:53:10,412 --> 00:53:12,122
That scene is a blackhole.

822
00:53:12,747 --> 00:53:14,290
Girls come up missing
all the time,

823
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:15,625
guys always trying
to take advantage

824
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:16,751
of the situation.

825
00:53:17,877 --> 00:53:20,004
There was this one creeper
at a party one night.

826
00:53:20,088 --> 00:53:21,172
Late like 4:00 in the morning.

827
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:22,340
Silver-haired dude.

828
00:53:22,424 --> 00:53:24,717
Now we were gonna go
to the patio and get high.

829
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,303
Anyway, the silver-haired dude
was inside

830
00:53:27,387 --> 00:53:29,556
and I saw him talking to some
girls who had been there,

831
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:32,725
I'd seen them a couple of times
and they were giving him money.

832
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:34,811
About a week later,
I'm pulled over

833
00:53:34,894 --> 00:53:36,771
for not using my turn signal,
and it was him,

834
00:53:36,855 --> 00:53:37,981
the silver-haired dude.

835
00:53:38,064 --> 00:53:39,065
He's a fucking cop.

836
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:41,234
- Is he a stocky guy?
- Yes, yeah.

837
00:53:41,317 --> 00:53:42,318
Uh, Flosso.

838
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:43,903
Officer Flosso,
that was the name on the ticket.

839
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:44,863
JIMMY:
Right, right.

840
00:53:44,946 --> 00:53:46,865
ELEANOR: The girl said
he was a cage fighter.

841
00:53:49,117 --> 00:53:52,662
Our friend Kaiser,
I need to talk to him again.

842
00:53:52,746 --> 00:53:53,788
Well, I'll give you his number,

843
00:53:53,872 --> 00:53:55,415
but, you know,
don't expect much.

844
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:58,626
He's a moody motherfucker,
like you.

845
00:54:02,714 --> 00:54:05,842
Oh, one more thing,
and maybe it's nothing

846
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:09,012
but the silver-haired guy,
I saw him take some money

847
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:11,681
and then give it to this guy,
the "Doc".

848
00:54:11,765 --> 00:54:13,183
Well, we called him
"Dr. Feelgood",

849
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:15,018
because, you know,
he was giving out

850
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:16,978
pills like it was candy.

851
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,190
Big beard
and the curly-ish hair,

852
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:21,941
deep voice, like...

853
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:26,071
I don't fucking know,
that also happened.

854
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,740
I don't know if that helps.

855
00:54:29,949 --> 00:54:31,451
I wish I'd met you a week ago.

856
00:54:32,077 --> 00:54:34,913
Oh, what do you do?

857
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:36,998
What do I do?

858
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,625
Yeah?

859
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:42,045
Um, uh, a lotta this, lately.

860
00:54:42,128 --> 00:54:44,964
No, when you're not creeping
on singers outside of studios.

861
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,216
Did you say creeping?

862
00:54:46,299 --> 00:54:47,300
I...

863
00:54:48,343 --> 00:54:49,886
Um, what do I do?

864
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,639
- I do uh, I do tattoos.
- Hmm.

865
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:56,059
And uh... motors.

866
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:58,103
- Hmm, rock 'n' roll life.
- Yeah.

867
00:54:58,186 --> 00:54:59,395
- Very cool.
- It's right.

868
00:54:59,479 --> 00:55:00,647
It's good people mostly.

869
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,607
- Yeah.
- You got any ink?

870
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,818
Oh man, no.

871
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,487
I never found anything that
I wanted to stay with me

872
00:55:07,612 --> 00:55:08,488
for life, you know.

873
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:09,656
Oh.

874
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,492
Sometimes a tattoo
is just a tattoo.

875
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:15,453
Okay, well then how come
most girls get a rose

876
00:55:15,537 --> 00:55:16,788
or a dolphin?

877
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:19,290
Fucking angel wings.

878
00:55:19,374 --> 00:55:21,751
- How trashy is that?
- Touché.

879
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:23,670
- It's so trashy, right.
- Touché.

880
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,839
Yeah, well, you know
times are... times are tough.

881
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,006
Ink is ink.

882
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,675
Oh, and that's when you do
those kind of tattoos.

883
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,218
I draw the line at tramp stamps.

884
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:32,095
- Oh.
- (Laughing)

885
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:35,223
Well, it is good to know
there's a line.

886
00:55:35,306 --> 00:55:36,683
Yeah, there is.

887
00:55:37,142 --> 00:55:38,810
No, they all mean something.

888
00:55:41,187 --> 00:55:43,314
- It's not gonna run out on you.
- No.

889
00:55:43,398 --> 00:55:45,900
That's a different story,
probably a different tattoo.

890
00:55:49,404 --> 00:55:50,447
(Cellphone dings)

891
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:53,074
Oh, I have to go.

892
00:55:53,491 --> 00:55:54,951
That is my 15.

893
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,578
I've got an audition.

894
00:55:56,661 --> 00:55:57,704
Mm?

895
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,456
Uh I hope that this helped.

896
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:02,041
Changed my day around.

897
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,668
Oh, fine.

898
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,462
Maybe I'll see you around.

899
00:56:05,545 --> 00:56:07,338
- Good luck on your audition.
- Thank you.

900
00:56:07,422 --> 00:56:08,631
You're welcome.

901
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,936
(♪♪♪)

902
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,017
Meet me behind the station.
I have something to show you.

903
00:57:07,816 --> 00:57:09,818
(Snorting)

904
00:57:16,825 --> 00:57:18,660
(Cellphone ringing)

905
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:21,579
(Coughs)

906
00:57:23,665 --> 00:57:24,749
Yo.

907
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,585
Yeah, we've... we've been
shooting all night.

908
00:57:27,919 --> 00:57:29,963
Jayne busted into my party
the other night,

909
00:57:30,422 --> 00:57:32,590
asking me about Star
and the others.

910
00:57:32,924 --> 00:57:33,925
Nah, I didn't tell him shit.

911
00:57:34,008 --> 00:57:35,635
The asshole ruined my high.

912
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:38,555
You gotta be cool, bro.

913
00:57:40,306 --> 00:57:41,683
There's some girls here.

914
00:57:42,434 --> 00:57:44,978
(Snorts, coughs)
(Knocking on door)

915
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,564
Yeah, I still got 'em,
come on up.

916
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:48,815
Okay, cool.

917
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,400
(Knocking on door)

918
00:57:52,944 --> 00:57:55,155
Hey, yo, what...
what are you doing here?

919
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,615
You don't... you can't just come
over to my office like this.

920
00:57:58,283 --> 00:58:00,744
(♪♪♪)

921
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:07,917
(Grunting, moaning in distance)

922
00:58:21,014 --> 00:58:23,349
ERASMUS: Looking for Persi?
All the way down to the left.

923
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:27,312
(indistinct speech)

924
00:58:37,697 --> 00:58:38,948
Bye, Juicy.

925
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,576
(♪♪♪)

926
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,504
(Screams)

927
00:58:52,837 --> 00:58:55,215
(♪♪♪)

928
00:59:14,609 --> 00:59:15,652
Hey.

929
00:59:17,112 --> 00:59:18,113
FREEMAN:
What is it, Jimmy?

930
00:59:18,196 --> 00:59:19,614
You're gonna wanna see this.

931
00:59:19,697 --> 00:59:20,740
FREEMAN:
What?

932
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:23,326
You need to move your car
before we get it towed.

933
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:24,828
Yeah, I could move it.

934
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:27,455
I could drive it
right to the morgue.

935
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:29,207
What are you talking about?

936
00:59:36,214 --> 00:59:37,590
Who's pulling the strings?

937
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:40,552
Who could throw the body
of a giant in a trunk

938
00:59:40,635 --> 00:59:41,970
without nobody seeing?

939
00:59:43,054 --> 00:59:44,389
Whoever did it,
picked the locks

940
00:59:44,472 --> 00:59:46,808
in the parking lot on Franklin
where they threw the body.

941
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,144
In broad daylight?

942
00:59:50,228 --> 00:59:51,271
They did it sometime
in the morning

943
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,772
while I was having breakfast.

944
00:59:52,897 --> 00:59:54,190
You've been tracking my cell,

945
00:59:54,274 --> 00:59:56,192
you know
I couldn't have done this.

946
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:57,944
VARGAS:
I don't know, buddy.

947
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:01,948
I think somebody's seriously
fucking with you, big time.

948
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:03,950
Or warning me.

949
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,995
Maybe they knew Kaiser
was trying to help me.

950
01:00:07,078 --> 01:00:08,204
Yeah.

951
01:00:08,288 --> 01:00:09,998
Now don't you think
the smart thing to do

952
01:00:10,081 --> 01:00:11,291
would have been to tell us

953
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,043
about this when the Land Rover
first tried to run you down?

954
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,881
I've never been accused
of being smart.

955
01:00:17,964 --> 01:00:18,840
Right.

956
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:22,719
What about your visit
to Persi's party?

957
01:00:22,802 --> 01:00:24,304
Persi had nothing to do with it.

958
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:26,347
He's just a bad host.

959
01:00:26,431 --> 01:00:27,515
If I were you,
I would check the people

960
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,517
at the Chateau party,
that's where I'd start.

961
01:00:30,852 --> 01:00:34,105
Sorry, buddy,
afraid we have to keep the car.

962
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:39,235
Okay. Well, don't scratch it.

963
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:40,612
Don't fuck with the radio.

964
01:00:40,695 --> 01:00:43,490
No scratch, no problem.

965
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,408
Who's driving me home?

966
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:47,619
I'll drive you home.

967
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,382
Hey, no smoking in the cruiser.

968
01:01:02,133 --> 01:01:03,635
It's regulations.

969
01:01:03,718 --> 01:01:05,136
All right,
have a couple of puffs,

970
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,262
I'll wait.

971
01:01:12,352 --> 01:01:13,978
What a fucking day, man.

972
01:01:14,479 --> 01:01:16,272
Yeah, me too.

973
01:01:17,398 --> 01:01:18,817
Persi's dead.

974
01:01:19,484 --> 01:01:21,820
Yeah, I know,
a real loss to humanity.

975
01:01:22,862 --> 01:01:23,947
How'd he go?

976
01:01:24,322 --> 01:01:25,657
VARGAS:
Snapped neck.

977
01:01:26,658 --> 01:01:30,245
Now look, I'm only gonna
tell you this once,

978
01:01:30,578 --> 01:01:32,539
I don't think you're involved
in this

979
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:35,041
any more than somebody
wants you to be.

980
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,167
Okay.

981
01:01:38,753 --> 01:01:40,213
I'm next.

982
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:42,799
I think you're right.

983
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,300
JIMMY:
How's that?

984
01:01:45,427 --> 01:01:48,263
You know something
you don't even know you know.

985
01:01:48,346 --> 01:01:52,392
Or somebody wants you to know
something, you know.

986
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:55,687
Let's hit it.

987
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,021
Put that out.

988
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:01,901
(Vargas grunts)

989
01:02:22,088 --> 01:02:23,882
(Birds chirping)

990
01:02:33,266 --> 01:02:34,851
So this how you live?

991
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,064
Yeah,
Dad left me the house.

992
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:45,403
Mortgaged to get the shop,
couldn't make the payment, closed,

993
01:02:46,112 --> 01:02:48,490
told the family moving in that this
is a separate property.

994
01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:51,868
So what, they can kick you out
anytime they want?

995
01:02:54,496 --> 01:02:55,955
I don't know, James.

996
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:00,043
All right, concerned citizen,

997
01:03:01,294 --> 01:03:04,339
why don't you tell me
who you think's involved?

998
01:03:04,631 --> 01:03:05,590
Flosso.

999
01:03:06,132 --> 01:03:07,300
Flosso?

1000
01:03:08,009 --> 01:03:09,427
JIMMY:
He's an ex-fighter.

1001
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:10,386
Huh.

1002
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:13,098
He'd certainly know how to
break their necks clean enough.

1003
01:03:13,181 --> 01:03:15,558
So this preacher's daughter,
your source,

1004
01:03:15,642 --> 01:03:17,143
she for certain it was him?

1005
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,396
Yeah,
he's working for somebody.

1006
01:03:21,022 --> 01:03:22,565
Well, that makes sense,
'cause Flosso,

1007
01:03:22,649 --> 01:03:24,234
he's a real dumb shit.

1008
01:03:24,317 --> 01:03:26,319
He wouldn't be able to do it
on his own.

1009
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:29,197
I'll look him up,
I'll see what I can find.

1010
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:33,535
Hey Vargas,
how well you know your partner?

1011
01:03:34,994 --> 01:03:36,204
Why you ask?

1012
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:39,249
'Cause I think he's dirty.

1013
01:03:41,042 --> 01:03:43,670
I think he found my lighter
and thought I was an easy mark.

1014
01:03:44,546 --> 01:03:46,297
You're reaching, buddy.

1015
01:03:46,631 --> 01:03:49,050
And you better be careful
what you're saying.

1016
01:03:49,884 --> 01:03:51,302
He have an alibi?

1017
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:53,596
Matter of fact he does.

1018
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,474
He was half in the bag
over at the Montello.

1019
01:03:56,683 --> 01:03:58,059
How're the cameras at the
Montello Lounge?

1020
01:03:58,143 --> 01:03:59,185
- They're good.
- Yeah?

1021
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:00,353
Yeah.

1022
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:03,231
If you check the video footage
and you see him

1023
01:04:03,314 --> 01:04:05,567
leaving between 2:00 and 2:30,
then I was right.

1024
01:04:06,317 --> 01:04:09,529
And if I'm right,
I just wanna know about it.

1025
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:12,073
No. All right,
no more cowboy shit.

1026
01:04:12,532 --> 01:04:14,701
I'll take a look at the tapes,
but I can already tell you

1027
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,536
what I'm gonna find, okay.

1028
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,622
And by the way,
you're all wrong about Freeman.

1029
01:04:20,331 --> 01:04:23,042
He's a good guy,
he's my kid's godfather.

1030
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,297
Hitler loved dogs.

1031
01:04:27,922 --> 01:04:28,798
Huh.

1032
01:04:28,882 --> 01:04:30,133
What's your point?

1033
01:04:31,217 --> 01:04:33,011
My point is
some of the most evil people

1034
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:35,138
in the world
still have great smiles.

1035
01:04:36,681 --> 01:04:37,682
That's interesting.

1036
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:39,559
Just do me a favor.

1037
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,269
Stand down, all right.

1038
01:04:41,352 --> 01:04:43,396
You done enough, okay?

1039
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:47,942
It's depressing.

1040
01:04:51,446 --> 01:04:53,823
(♪♪♪)

1041
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:11,758
JIMMY:
<i>What's your name?</i>

1042
01:05:15,303 --> 01:05:16,554
STAR:
<i>Star.</i>

1043
01:05:20,642 --> 01:05:24,020
If you forget, just look up.

1044
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:29,025
(♪♪♪)

1045
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:52,715
(Sighs)

1046
01:05:58,263 --> 01:06:00,098
(Bike engine rumbling)

1047
01:06:03,476 --> 01:06:04,936
The shit's vegan, right?

1048
01:06:05,019 --> 01:06:07,188
Makeup? It's vegan?

1049
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,398
Go check.

1050
01:06:08,481 --> 01:06:10,567
It's in my contract,
vegan makeup!

1051
01:06:11,276 --> 01:06:13,778
(♪♪♪)

1052
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:32,756
Don't fucking say anything,
I'm mic'd.

1053
01:06:36,301 --> 01:06:38,470
Okay, you know
what it looks like... I'm fr...

1054
01:06:38,553 --> 01:06:39,971
Shut the fuck up!

1055
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:41,264
Shut up!

1056
01:06:43,725 --> 01:06:45,059
You lied to me.

1057
01:06:45,977 --> 01:06:47,771
You lie to me again,
I'll break your fucking face,

1058
01:06:47,854 --> 01:06:49,022
you understand?

1059
01:06:49,397 --> 01:06:50,774
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1060
01:06:50,857 --> 01:06:51,983
- Yeah?
- Okay.

1061
01:06:57,822 --> 01:06:59,240
Tell me about Persi.

1062
01:06:59,657 --> 01:07:00,617
Fuck, man.

1063
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,786
I was embarrassed to admit
that I was hanging with Persi

1064
01:07:02,869 --> 01:07:04,954
'cause he is a fucking scumbag,
okay.

1065
01:07:05,038 --> 01:07:06,998
But it's not illegal to drink
his booze and eat his food,

1066
01:07:07,082 --> 01:07:10,085
not to mention, fucking pussy
flying around that place.

1067
01:07:10,168 --> 01:07:11,920
I mean, anything goes there.

1068
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:13,754
Like what?

1069
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:17,217
Some local cops there
hanging out now,

1070
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:18,927
playing poker in the back.

1071
01:07:20,762 --> 01:07:23,056
That's not all that's going on
back there.

1072
01:07:23,138 --> 01:07:25,016
Yeah, I heard a few pimped
some girls,

1073
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,768
but that's none
of my fucking business.

1074
01:07:26,851 --> 01:07:28,853
I had nothing to do
with those dead hookers.

1075
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,732
Star and her friends,
did they go to this party?

1076
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:35,276
Yeah, man, I said that,
I seen them there a few times

1077
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,445
but there's 50 fucking girls
there every night.

1078
01:07:37,529 --> 01:07:39,781
You wanna talk to someone?
Talk to Erasmus.

1079
01:07:40,031 --> 01:07:41,783
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

1080
01:07:41,866 --> 01:07:43,410
Erasmus Alcindor.
He's a screenwriter.

1081
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:46,204
He's a fucking hack,
looks like a ferret.

1082
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:48,330
He used to date Star.

1083
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:50,333
Look, I don't know
why they dated either,

1084
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:51,875
she's a fucking beautiful girl
messing around

1085
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,670
with some fucking creep.

1086
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,004
He used to lie to her
and say he'd put her in movies.

1087
01:07:57,757 --> 01:08:00,634
He talks to that cop Flosso,
all the time.

1088
01:08:02,846 --> 01:08:04,138
Where can I find him?

1089
01:08:05,013 --> 01:08:06,182
Erasmus?

1090
01:08:06,808 --> 01:08:09,352
He lives in those shithole apartments
in Persi's studios.

1091
01:08:09,936 --> 01:08:11,521
I swear to fucking God, man.

1092
01:08:11,728 --> 01:08:13,690
Fuck God,
I swear to you, okay?

1093
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:15,692
He knows everything about
their operation.

1094
01:08:15,775 --> 01:08:16,776
Everything.

1095
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,825
I swear to you,
I swear, I swear, I...

1096
01:08:23,908 --> 01:08:26,411
Listen, listen,
you little bitch.

1097
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:28,830
- You gonna lie to me again?
- No.

1098
01:08:28,913 --> 01:08:30,999
- You gonna lie to me again?
- No, I'm not gonna lie again!

1099
01:08:31,082 --> 01:08:32,040
No!

1100
01:08:32,584 --> 01:08:35,044
(♪♪♪)

1101
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:20,465
Erasmus?

1102
01:09:40,693 --> 01:09:41,820
Go away!

1103
01:09:42,195 --> 01:09:43,279
Erasmus?

1104
01:09:43,363 --> 01:09:45,240
Are you fucking deaf?
He's not here.

1105
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,707
This can go one of two ways.

1106
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:57,252
You watch who you're throwing insults
out of your word-hole to,

1107
01:09:57,335 --> 01:09:59,129
you... you...
the wrong person hears it,

1108
01:09:59,421 --> 01:10:01,673
and you'll be in a fucking
cheap hotel room dead,

1109
01:10:01,756 --> 01:10:02,841
you hear me?

1110
01:10:04,384 --> 01:10:05,468
(Grunts)

1111
01:10:06,428 --> 01:10:07,637
ERASMUS:
Fuck, man.

1112
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:08,888
I'm a pacifist!

1113
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,557
I'm a pacifist!

1114
01:10:11,057 --> 01:10:12,183
Fuck.

1115
01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:13,184
I'm not.

1116
01:10:15,353 --> 01:10:16,646
You going somewhere?

1117
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:17,605
Babylon has fallen,

1118
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:19,524
can't you see
it's the last days of Rome?

1119
01:10:24,946 --> 01:10:26,406
You want to know what I see?

1120
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:31,786
I see a piece of shit
who's in way over his head

1121
01:10:31,953 --> 01:10:33,204
who's gonna tell me
all about his girlfriend.

1122
01:10:33,538 --> 01:10:34,831
Which one?

1123
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:36,541
You know which one.

1124
01:10:36,624 --> 01:10:37,834
Fucking Star.

1125
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:39,711
Star's not my girlfriend,
you sperm-less testicle,

1126
01:10:39,794 --> 01:10:41,045
she's my friend.

1127
01:10:41,379 --> 01:10:43,631
Alright, women, I'm not a threat
to them, they trust me,

1128
01:10:43,715 --> 01:10:45,383
they bare
their midnight fantasies,

1129
01:10:45,467 --> 01:10:46,634
their hopes and dreams.

1130
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:49,012
(Grunts in pain)

1131
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:54,392
Alright, I'm telling you
that she was an angel! Star.

1132
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:56,686
They should've called her
"The-Whole-fucking-Galaxy".

1133
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:57,687
Who killed her?

1134
01:10:57,771 --> 01:10:59,731
It's not that simple, man.

1135
01:10:59,814 --> 01:11:01,024
She was...
it's not that simple.

1136
01:11:01,107 --> 01:11:03,318
She was blackmailing us...
them, them!

1137
01:11:03,401 --> 01:11:04,986
That's not an admission
of guilt.

1138
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:07,322
- She was blackmailing them.
- Who?

1139
01:11:07,405 --> 01:11:09,074
I tried to stop her,
but she brought the others

1140
01:11:09,157 --> 01:11:10,158
- in on it.
- Who?

1141
01:11:10,241 --> 01:11:11,743
All the girls, man.

1142
01:11:12,118 --> 01:11:14,537
Persi used to run drugs
up from Mexico.

1143
01:11:14,621 --> 01:11:16,664
He had to find a way
to launder the money,

1144
01:11:16,748 --> 01:11:17,832
so he got in the film business

1145
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:19,542
and then he started
trafficking girls,

1146
01:11:19,626 --> 01:11:21,252
all the girls
who wanna be in his movies.

1147
01:11:21,419 --> 01:11:23,379
Didn't ask for a fucking resume.

1148
01:11:23,463 --> 01:11:25,298
Tell me who killed Star.

1149
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,592
ERASMUS:
Flosso, man.

1150
01:11:27,926 --> 01:11:30,637
They always used Flosso to keep
the girls in line.

1151
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,930
Don't fucking lie to me.

1152
01:11:32,013 --> 01:11:33,640
- (Indistinct speech)
- Don't fucking lie to me.

1153
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:36,101
Half the fucking precinct
is in it, man.

1154
01:11:36,184 --> 01:11:38,061
How you think they wear
such nice suits?

1155
01:11:38,144 --> 01:11:39,187
I want names.

1156
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,815
Goddammit, Flosso is a name!

1157
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:43,274
Flosso is a name.

1158
01:11:49,697 --> 01:11:51,074
Who ordered the hit?

1159
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,201
Who ordered the hit!

1160
01:11:53,284 --> 01:11:54,536
He'll kill me.

1161
01:11:54,619 --> 01:11:56,037
I'll fucking kill you.

1162
01:11:56,121 --> 01:11:57,622
Who ordered the hit?

1163
01:11:57,997 --> 01:11:59,249
ERASMUS:
Freeman.

1164
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:01,918
- Detective...
- Don't fucking lie to me, man.

1165
01:12:04,254 --> 01:12:06,423
ERASMUS:
I'm telling the truth, man.

1166
01:12:06,506 --> 01:12:08,425
I overheard him
and Persi talking.

1167
01:12:10,552 --> 01:12:13,304
It's... it's not killing women
to them, man.

1168
01:12:13,388 --> 01:12:15,849
It's more like clearing out
rotten inventory.

1169
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:18,893
Like difficult women
make bad hookers, man.

1170
01:12:19,227 --> 01:12:22,272
And you were...
you were the perfect fall guy.

1171
01:12:22,355 --> 01:12:23,648
You screwed everything up,
man.

1172
01:12:23,731 --> 01:12:26,484
Now Flosso's in the wind
and they want us all dead.

1173
01:12:28,236 --> 01:12:29,529
How are you involved?

1174
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:32,449
Me, I'm just a writer, man.

1175
01:12:32,532 --> 01:12:33,575
I schedule the girls.

1176
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:35,535
I make sure
they have a good time.

1177
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:37,787
I take care of the girls,
that's it.

1178
01:12:38,037 --> 01:12:39,205
And Vargas?

1179
01:12:39,831 --> 01:12:41,207
You seen him around?

1180
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:43,293
Freeman keeps him in the dark,
man.

1181
01:12:43,376 --> 01:12:45,420
Vargas is the worst detective
in the city.

1182
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:47,630
(Cellphone ringing)

1183
01:12:47,756 --> 01:12:48,673
I'm going to my mom's.

1184
01:12:48,757 --> 01:12:50,049
I should have never left
Glendale.

1185
01:12:52,886 --> 01:12:53,928
Yeah.

1186
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:56,556
Just pulled up.

1187
01:12:57,432 --> 01:12:58,683
What are you talking about?

1188
01:12:59,768 --> 01:13:01,144
To the parlor.

1189
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:05,023
Rent here on Melrose
must be outrageous.

1190
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:06,900
Wait, what?

1191
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:09,819
Jimmy, you just texted me
15 minutes ago

1192
01:13:09,903 --> 01:13:11,738
- saying to meet you here.
- No. No, hey run.

1193
01:13:11,905 --> 01:13:12,822
<i>Get out of there.</i>

1194
01:13:12,906 --> 01:13:13,907
<i>Get the fuck out of there.</i>

1195
01:13:14,074 --> 01:13:15,533
(grunting)

1196
01:13:15,742 --> 01:13:17,410
JIMMY ON PHONE:
<i>Hey? Hey!</i>

1197
01:13:26,294 --> 01:13:28,129
(Cellphone ringing)

1198
01:13:29,631 --> 01:13:31,424
- JIMMY ON PHONE: Vargas?
- Hey, where are you, Jimmy?

1199
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:33,968
Freeman's mixed
into this for sure.

1200
01:13:34,052 --> 01:13:35,053
<i>Yeah, fuck, I know that.</i>

1201
01:13:35,136 --> 01:13:37,180
Look,
I just went to The Montello.

1202
01:13:37,388 --> 01:13:39,599
They already handed over
their tapes to guess who?

1203
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:40,642
Yeah.

1204
01:13:40,725 --> 01:13:43,311
So listen, Star, she worked
the concession stand

1205
01:13:43,394 --> 01:13:44,687
at this old movie theatre.

1206
01:13:44,771 --> 01:13:47,315
She sent an encrypted file
to her boss.

1207
01:13:47,732 --> 01:13:50,235
Forensics, they're trying
to unlock it right now, okay.

1208
01:13:50,318 --> 01:13:52,987
Hey, that source
I told you about,

1209
01:13:53,071 --> 01:13:54,406
the preacher's daughter,

1210
01:13:54,781 --> 01:13:56,908
she somehow got a text
from my phone.

1211
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,035
I was talking to her
when she was abducted.

1212
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:01,371
Hold on, okay.
We're gonna get an APB out.

1213
01:14:01,538 --> 01:14:04,541
Also a bystander ID'd Flosso
leaving the scene

1214
01:14:04,624 --> 01:14:06,626
where Star and her friends
were found.

1215
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:07,919
<i>You understand that?</i>

1216
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:10,422
You speak to your captain
about the tapes?

1217
01:14:10,505 --> 01:14:12,173
<i>Look, I haven't talked
to anybody yet.</i>

1218
01:14:12,257 --> 01:14:13,425
<i>Where was she?</i>

1219
01:14:13,508 --> 01:14:14,843
She's right outside my shop.

1220
01:14:14,926 --> 01:14:15,927
<i>Okay, listen,</i>

1221
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,303
I'm gonna roll units over
right now.

1222
01:14:17,387 --> 01:14:18,680
Do not go inside, Jimmy.

1223
01:14:18,763 --> 01:14:20,432
- You hear me?
- Oh no.

1224
01:14:20,515 --> 01:14:21,850
<i>Do not engage.</i>

1225
01:14:21,933 --> 01:14:22,976
Okay.

1226
01:14:24,811 --> 01:14:25,937
Okay.

1227
01:14:27,814 --> 01:14:30,567
(♪♪♪)

1228
01:15:02,849 --> 01:15:05,810
(♪♪♪)

1229
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,360

1230
01:16:14,546 --> 01:16:16,047

1237
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:05,365
(Sirens wailing in distance)

1238
01:18:25,009 --> 01:18:26,094
VARGAS:
Cuff him.

1239
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,973
(Indistinct radio chatter)

1240
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:33,059
Fuck you!

1241
01:18:33,143 --> 01:18:34,978
(Indistinct radio chatter)

1242
01:18:41,109 --> 01:18:42,569

1246
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:09,888
(Cellphone vibrating)

1247
01:19:18,938 --> 01:19:20,523
(Telephone ringing)

1248
01:19:21,983 --> 01:19:23,026
Farry.

1249
01:19:23,735 --> 01:19:24,778
VARGAS ON PHONE:
<i>Captain.</i>

1250
01:19:25,487 --> 01:19:26,362
You alone?

1251
01:19:26,446 --> 01:19:28,073
- <i>Yeah, what's going on?</i>
- All right.

1252
01:19:28,156 --> 01:19:29,824
It's Freeman,
gotta bring him in.

1253
01:19:30,408 --> 01:19:31,493
<i>He's dirty.</i>

1254
01:19:31,743 --> 01:19:32,660
<i>Just busted Flosso.</i>

1255
01:19:32,827 --> 01:19:34,496
He was trying to kill a witness.

1256
01:19:34,788 --> 01:19:35,747
Got it?

1257
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:37,165
Fuck, he just left.

1258
01:19:41,294 --> 01:19:43,379
(Indistinct radio chatter)

1259
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:49,427
(Spits)

1260
01:20:11,157 --> 01:20:12,492
What's your hurry, Bill?

1261
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:14,119
(Gun blares)

1262
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:21,543
So stupid.

1263
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:22,919
(Gun blares)

1264
01:20:40,228 --> 01:20:41,479
Where they take her?

1265
01:20:42,647 --> 01:20:43,940
FLOSSO:
I don't know.

1266
01:20:45,358 --> 01:20:46,860
I could drive this thing
into the Pacific,

1267
01:20:46,943 --> 01:20:48,862
or you can give me an
exact address.

1268
01:20:58,121 --> 01:20:59,748
You're gonna die anyways.

1269
01:21:01,124 --> 01:21:04,335
Now you can lie to me,
I can make it real slow,

1270
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,631
or you can tell me the truth
and maybe I'll make it fast.

1271
01:21:09,424 --> 01:21:10,592
Maybe.

1272
01:21:12,385 --> 01:21:14,304
I didn't want any of this.

1273
01:21:14,888 --> 01:21:16,181
It was Freeman.

1274
01:21:17,015 --> 01:21:19,392
Fucking Freeman caught me
with a gram.

1275
01:21:19,517 --> 01:21:21,269
One gram.

1276
01:21:23,646 --> 01:21:25,565
Told me he'd get IA
to take my badge away

1277
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:28,485
and put me away for three years
if I didn't work for him.

1278
01:21:32,739 --> 01:21:34,240
You killed Star?

1279
01:21:36,534 --> 01:21:37,869
Yeah, I did.

1280
01:21:41,956 --> 01:21:43,166
Where's Eleanor?

1281
01:21:46,169 --> 01:21:47,462
San Diego.

1282
01:21:48,797 --> 01:21:53,343
They got a restaurant,
a fridge leads to a tunnel.

1283
01:21:55,095 --> 01:21:56,513
JIMMY:
What's this tunnel?

1284
01:21:58,848 --> 01:22:03,686
The kind of tunnel that connects
San Diego with Tijuana.

1285
01:22:05,814 --> 01:22:07,315
Freeman runnin' the operation?

1286
01:22:07,398 --> 01:22:08,566
FLOSSO:
Fuck no.

1287
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:12,153
It's some broker, Dr. Feelgood.

1288
01:22:13,738 --> 01:22:15,365
He's a dangerous cat
though, man.

1289
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:16,908
He's got eyes everywhere.

1290
01:22:19,285 --> 01:22:20,578
- Hey.
- Hmm.

1291
01:22:20,954 --> 01:22:23,164
I tell you where they are,
I'll take you to 'em,

1292
01:22:24,499 --> 01:22:26,042
you gotta let me go.

1293
01:22:27,377 --> 01:22:29,045
It's a fair trade, right?

1294
01:22:31,923 --> 01:22:33,007
Yeah.

1295
01:22:34,217 --> 01:22:35,218
Yeah.

1296
01:22:35,969 --> 01:22:37,053
Okay.

1297
01:22:40,974 --> 01:22:42,725
- Hey!
- Stop that car!

1298
01:22:42,809 --> 01:22:43,810
POLICEMEN:
Hey!

1299
01:22:44,018 --> 01:22:45,979
(Indistinct shouting)

1300
01:22:51,693 --> 01:22:52,944
Okay, took a left.

1301
01:23:01,202 --> 01:23:04,038
(♪♪♪)

1302
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,455
I told you to be ready.

1303
01:23:45,872 --> 01:23:48,750
I do not work to your schedule,
detective.

1304
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:50,251
Where's Flosso?

1305
01:23:50,627 --> 01:23:54,130
As soon as we get safe,
he's next.

1306
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:56,800
She's doped up
and ready for transport.

1307
01:23:57,634 --> 01:24:01,221
Buyers pay well
for American girls, age aside.

1308
01:24:01,471 --> 01:24:03,515
Just make sure I get my cut.

1309
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:16,569
(♪♪♪)

1310
01:24:29,791 --> 01:24:31,000
This the place?

1311
01:24:32,627 --> 01:24:33,837
Yeah.

1312
01:24:36,423 --> 01:24:38,049
Fridge's in the back.

1313
01:24:41,636 --> 01:24:43,471
Now you're gonna let me go,
right?

1314
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:46,516
Man of your word.

1315
01:24:50,311 --> 01:24:51,479
Yeah.

1316
01:24:58,027 --> 01:24:59,070

(♪♪♪)

1320
01:26:26,908 --> 01:26:28,076
Stop, stop!

1321
01:26:29,077 --> 01:26:30,286
- Stop!
- (Gun blares)

1322
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:37,669
In here!

JIMMY:
Freeman, you prick!

1328
01:28:15,391 --> 01:28:17,644
Hey, I can get you
whatever you want.

1329
01:28:17,769 --> 01:28:19,312
Money, girls.

1330
01:28:19,395 --> 01:28:20,939
FREEMAN:
You motherfucker.

1331
01:28:21,606 --> 01:28:23,233
You know the damage you've done?

1332
01:28:25,276 --> 01:28:26,486
I have an idea.

1333
01:28:27,028 --> 01:28:28,405
I have a family.

1334
01:28:28,822 --> 01:28:30,573
I worked for my life.

1335
01:28:30,782 --> 01:28:32,367
Kill!
(Guns blaring)

1336
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:34,244
(Grunts)

1337
01:28:48,883 --> 01:28:50,009
Hey, hey.

1338
01:28:50,093 --> 01:28:51,761
Don't... don't... don't...
don't you do it!

1339

(Grunting)

1344
01:29:43,396 --> 01:29:44,314
Jimmy.

1345
01:29:44,397 --> 01:29:46,399
(Taking deep breaths)

1346
01:29:46,775 --> 01:29:47,984
It's okay.

1347
01:29:51,029 --> 01:29:52,614
Wasn't supposed to...

1348
01:29:53,406 --> 01:29:54,783
(Freeman coughs)

1349
01:29:54,866 --> 01:29:56,785
...to end like this.

1350
01:30:00,455 --> 01:30:02,207
(Exhales)

1351
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,501
Say hi to my mom.

1353

FREEMAN:
Please don't do it.

1354
01:30:24,062 --> 01:30:25,438
Not this way.

1355
01:30:27,148 --> 01:30:28,566
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1356
01:30:29,776 --> 01:30:32,362
(♪♪♪)

1357
01:31:28,793 --> 01:31:29,919
Who is that?

1358
01:31:30,336 --> 01:31:31,671
Identify yourself!

1359
01:31:32,547 --> 01:31:34,007
Identify yourself!

1360
01:31:36,801 --> 01:31:39,179
Where's Freeman? Huh?

1361
01:31:39,512 --> 01:31:40,722
Where's Freeman?

1362
01:31:42,974 --> 01:31:44,350
What happened out there?

1363
01:31:45,518 --> 01:31:47,604
Your son's gonna need
a new godfather.

1364
01:31:52,108 --> 01:31:53,318
(Eleanor grunting)

1365
01:31:56,738 --> 01:31:59,074
JIMMY: <i>What are the three words
to ruin a man's ego?</i>

1366
01:32:02,702 --> 01:32:03,995
Is it in?

1367
01:32:09,417 --> 01:32:11,169
- I know it's funny.
- Yeah, no.

1368
01:32:11,252 --> 01:32:13,880
- 'Cause it's true.
- I bet, I bet.

1369
01:32:16,549 --> 01:32:17,759
Where you from?

1370
01:32:19,928 --> 01:32:22,013
Very far away from here.

1371
01:32:23,515 --> 01:32:25,016
JIMMY:
You here for the movies?

1372
01:32:26,142 --> 01:32:27,477
Real movies.

1373
01:32:27,894 --> 01:32:29,312
But I just arrived.

1374
01:32:29,896 --> 01:32:31,189
I worked in a theatre,

1375
01:32:31,272 --> 01:32:36,778
but they don't show
the kinda movies I'm in now.

1376
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:38,696
Oh?

1377
01:32:39,739 --> 01:32:42,617
The theatre manager was such
a nice guy.

1378
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:45,578
Not like my new bosses.

1379
01:32:45,662 --> 01:32:50,041
They are,
how do you say... pigs.

1380
01:32:54,421 --> 01:32:55,880
You like that work?

1381
01:33:00,885 --> 01:33:02,095
No.

1382
01:33:03,096 --> 01:33:05,682
(Indistinct chattering
in background)

1383
01:33:08,351 --> 01:33:11,146
Can you work a front desk?
Can you type?

1384
01:33:12,564 --> 01:33:13,857
Why?

1385
01:33:15,108 --> 01:33:18,111
My secretary left
with my business partner.

1386
01:33:20,447 --> 01:33:22,282
- Things happen.
- Things happen.

1387
01:33:24,492 --> 01:33:25,827
Things happen.

1388
01:33:26,828 --> 01:33:28,997
(Indistinct chattering
in background)

1389
01:33:33,042 --> 01:33:35,003
Be there tomorrow,
you got a job.

1390
01:33:35,253 --> 01:33:36,588
I mean no pressure.

1391
01:33:38,423 --> 01:33:39,340
Jimmy Jayne.

1392
01:33:39,424 --> 01:33:40,467
JIMMY:
Jimmy Jayne.

1393
01:33:41,843 --> 01:33:44,929
Thanks for being
such a good guy.

1394
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,307
I don't know about that.

1395
01:33:47,932 --> 01:33:48,975
Persi wants us.

1396
01:33:49,058 --> 01:33:50,226
He has a car outside already.

1397
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:51,269
Yeah.

1398
01:33:52,812 --> 01:33:55,565
Hey, what's your name?

1399
01:33:57,025 --> 01:33:58,151
Star.

1400
01:33:58,526 --> 01:34:00,653
If you forget, just look up.

1401
01:34:05,408 --> 01:34:08,453
Hey. Bye Star.

1402
01:34:11,498 --> 01:34:14,167
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

1403
01:34:18,171 --> 01:34:19,297
Star...

1404
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:26,596
(Sighs)

1405
01:34:27,055 --> 01:34:28,306
Thank you.
