-Well, I expect it'll cloud over later on.
-[ferryman] Aye.

8
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,250
What's going on at Sutton Hoo, then?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,416
[man] There's a lady
who's got an excavating job.

10
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,125
-Ah, thank you kindly. Mind how you go.
-Thank you.

Basil Brown.

18
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,083
Wait here.

[piano theme fades]

20
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,791
-Should we take a look at them, then?
-[Brown] Right.

21
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,500
Things like this
are usually done through museums.

22
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,333
[Pretty] Yes.
But when I approached Ipswich,

23
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,208
Mr. Reid Moir said
that, with the war coming,

24
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,291
they couldn't embark upon
any new ventures.

25
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,458
[Brown] Well, they have their hands full
with a Roman villa.

26
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,208
-Yes. He said you were working on it.
-[Brown] I am.

27
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,416
He told me you were a difficult man.

28
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,791
[chuckles] Did he, now?

29
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:38,000
Unorthodox钬?and untrained.

30
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,125
[Brown] Hmm.
So that's his reference, is it?

31
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,875
[chuckles] Well, I'm钬?I'm not untrained.

32
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,083
I've been on dig
since I was old enough to hold a trowel.

33
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,375
[sighs] My father taught me.

34
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,458
Perhaps Reid Moir
just wants to keep you for himself.

35
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,916
-[Brown] I don't know about that.
-[both chuckle]

36
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,208
[Brown] I've always had a curiosity
to see these here mounds.

37
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,750
-Henry VIII came here to dig.
-[Pretty] So I'm told.

38
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,208
[Brown] Well, no record of what he found.

39
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,125
[Pretty]
My husband and I bought this land,

40
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,041
with the hope of exploring
what was under there.

41
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,708
-But钬?Well, best-laid plans.
-[Brown chuckles]

42
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,791
[Pretty] What are they?
Would you hazard a guess?

43
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,291
[Brown] Burial mounds, I expect.

44
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,458
We're standing
in someone's graveyard, I reckon.

45
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,208
Viking钬?
46
or maybe older.

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,666
Apparently, local girls used to lie down
on them in the hope of falling pregnant.

47
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,625
[Brown chuckles]

48
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,083
I've heard plenty of legends.

49
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,208
Is that why you want to dig, Mrs. Pretty?

50
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,958
Tales of buried treasure?

51
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,000
My interest
in archaeology began like yours,

52
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,250
when I was scarcely old enough
to hold a trowel.

53
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,833
My childhood home
was built on a Cistercian convent.

54
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,791
I helped my father excavate the apse.

55
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,916
That speaks, don't it?

56
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,541
The past.

57
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,458
You have rabbits, Mrs. Pretty.

58
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,958
Yes, I am aware of that. [chuckles]

59
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,500
[Brown] Rabbits burrow.

60
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,250
They're bad for excavations.

61
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,375
I'd like to start with this one.

62
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,625
[Brown] Ah, I wouldn't start
with this one, Mrs. Pretty,

63
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,250
not personally speaking.

64
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,083
-[Pretty] Why not?
-'Cause that dips in the middle, see?

65
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,041
And the soil feels-- That's compacted.

66
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,000
Thieves used to sink shafts in.

67
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,416
Robber's flutes, they're called.

68
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,166
Anything they found
would've been melted down

69
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,708
and sold long ago.

70
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,166
I expect you might be better off with钬?
72
one of these.

71
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,458
But I have a feeling about this one.

72
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,250
[Brown]
Well, that's your money, Mrs. Pretty,

73
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,958
but I'd base your dig on evidence,

74
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,625
not feeling.

75
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,583
[Pretty] As for money,
would 1 pound, 15 shillings,

76
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,333
and 6 pence a week be acceptable?

77
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,875
Oh钬?
80
-No.
-[Pretty] I asked Reid Moir what he pays.

78
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,291
-That was his reply.
-Well, he don't pay enough.

79
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,166
-[footsteps approach]
-[Pretty] All right.

80
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,541
I'm afraid that's all
I can reasonably afford to spend.

81
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,500
-[boy shouting]
-[Brown] Right, then. Understood.

82
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:16,583
Robert, where did you get that gas mask?
Take it off.

83
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,833
-Sorry, I didn't realize you were--
-This is not a toy.

84
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,375
Robert, this is Mr. Brown.

85
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,333
-Hello there, young man.
-[Robert] Robert Pretty. How do you do?

86
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,333
Who's coming after you?

87
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,250
-Captain Laska and his gangsters.
-[Brown] Oh!

88
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:33,083
-[Pretty] Mr. Brown is an archaeologist.
-Well, I'm an excavator.

89
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,541
-You've come to dig up the mounds?
-[Brown] Well钬?
93
I'm afraid not. Uh, not today.

90
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,500
Excuse me.

91
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,666
[Robert sighs]

92
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:48,208
-Good luck with your gangsters, Robert.
-[Robert chuckles] Thank you.

93
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,750
[Brown] And you, with your dig, ma'am.

94

[Brown sighs]

96
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,208
Ah, blast.

97
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,750
[car approaching]

98
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,916
[brakes squeak]

99
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,541
-Mr. Brown?
-Yes?

100
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,666
Billy Lyons. Uh, uh, from Mrs. Pretty.

101
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,541
All right.

102
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,666
Hmm.

103
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,916
[sighs, clicks tongue]

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,791
[bright orchestral music playing]

105
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,000
Tell her Monday, 8:00 sharp.

106
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,333
[Brown] I won't work
for less than two pound a week.

107
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,125
And it's too far to bike,
if you want a day's digging.

108
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,916
[Pretty] You could lodge听with the Lyonses
in the coach house.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,333
Mr. Lyons is my chauffeur,

110
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,416
and Mrs. Lyons
is in charge of the kitchen.

111
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,583
-[Brown sighs] Well, I'll need help.
-[Pretty] I could let you have one man.

112
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,291
[Brown] Two would be better.

113
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,041
[Pretty] I'm glad we could come
to an arrangement after all, Mr. Brown.

114
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,666
John Jacobs and Mr. Spooner
are bringing the shepherd's hut.

115
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,958
I thought it might be useful
in case of inclement weather.

116
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,958
Oh, that's very considerate.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,791
My son Robert
is keen to assist you in any way.

118
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,916
If you find his presence irksome--

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,583
Oh, no, no, no. He can come.

120
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,916
You'll start with this one?

121
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,791
[Brown] Yeah.

122
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,291
I reckon we can forget
that larger mound, Mrs. Pretty.

123
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,083
This one here,
that's where we'll find something.

124
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,750
Well, shan't hold you up.
[chuckles softly]

125
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,625
[Brown] Thank you kindly.

126
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,958
If you ask me, the man should leave
Mrs. Pretty's mounds well alone.

127
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,833
[Brown grunts]

128
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,708

129
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,958
[seagulls crying]

130
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,250
-[maid] Thank you, ma'am.
-[Pretty] Great, dear. Thank you.

131
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,958
Darling, please be gentle.
You'll knock me down.

132
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,375
[Robert]
I'm sorry. Mr. Brown says to come.

133
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,583
-Now?
-[Robert] Yes.

134
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,958
Well, thank you for the message.

135
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,666
Well, it looks like the kind of tray
you get at a butcher's.

136
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,166
And there's some blackness here,
maybe indicating a fire was made.

137
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,458
Who are those men?

138
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,208
[Pretty] They're from the Ipswich Museum.
Mr. Reid Moir telephoned me.

139
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,083
He wanted to see how things
were progressing, so I invited him.

140
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:32,208
Mrs. Pretty,
this is Guy Maynard, our new curator.

141
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,666
-How do you do?
-[Pretty] Hello.

142
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,583
Hello, Brown.

143
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,000
Maynard. Can I borrow you,
please, for this here corner?

144
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,500
Jolly good.

145
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,333
[Brown] One.

146
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,500
-You have it? Two.
-[Maynard] Yeah.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
-[Brown] Three! Blast.
-[Maynard grunts]

148
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,333
Is that the sum of your labors?

149
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,833
[Brown] Excuse me.

150
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,375

[indistinct chatter]

153
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,041
[Reid Moir] I must urge you, Mrs. Pretty,
to support our Roman villa.

154
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,291
War is looming.

155
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:23,083
All hands are on deck
to excavate before hostilities begin.

156
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,125
And so,
we must ask you to return Mr. Brown.

157
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,333
I'd like him to finish what he's started.

158
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:34,083
[Reid Moir chuckles] We may have found
the largest Roman villa

159
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,166
north of Felixstowe.

160
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,083
It's of far greater import,
if钬?if you'll forgive me, than this钬?
165
minor venture.

161
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,166
-Then the choice is Mr. Brown's.
-Excuse me.

162
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,416
Time had altered that piece of wood

163
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,833
to compacted sand.

164
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,583
I didn't guess its age correctly.

165
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,166
I speculated Viking,
but I think that's older.

166
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,583
-Anglo-Saxon.
-That's most unlikely, Brown.

167
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,875
We should-- We need you back at the villa.
That's what I'm here to say, and钬?
173
and Mrs. Pretty has released you.

168
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,833
I have said it is your choice.

169
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,958
Well, then I'll stay.

170
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,250
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

171
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,625
Excuse me.

172
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,250
Now, look here, Brown.

173
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,583
You've made your point.
You can have two pounds a week.

174
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,375
We'll give you a few days
to finish off here,

175
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,708
and then,
as we're the only museum in the area,

176
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,500
I'd carefully consider
where your future lies.

177
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:32,875
Understood.

178
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,375
[Robert] Mr. Brown's been telling us
all sorts of things.

179
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,833
For instance,
what's the most important part

180
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,375
of an archaeologist's body?

181
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,208
-I don't know.
-[clock chiming]

182
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,250
His nose.

183
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,833
If there's something there,
he'll know it by the smell.

184
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,208
You're going to see your father
this afternoon?

185
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,500
I钬?I'm afraid I'm needed here.

186
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:05,416
-Um, please, may I get down?
-If you're quite sure you've finished.

187
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,541
[sighs deeply]

188
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,291
[somber piano music playing]

189
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,333
[takes a deep breath]

190
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,208
[indistinct chatter]

191
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:39,416
[soldiers clamoring, muffled]

192
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,083
[Pretty sighs]

193
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,041
[breathing heavily]

194
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,125
[man] Boiled beef钬?
201
on a hot day like this is unlikely
to agree with anyone, Mrs. Lyons.

195
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,208
[Pretty] It was exactly like last time.

196
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,916
[doctor] Mrs. Pretty, you produce
all this acid because you're a worrier.

197
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,625
We've spoken on this subject before.

198
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,708
-You must learn to stop worrying.
-[sighs]

199
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,458
[doctor]
Otherwise, you'll give yourself an ulcer.

200
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,583
-Well钬?if that's what you think.
-[doctor] Mm-hmm.

201
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,291
[clock ticking]

202
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,458
[gentle piano music playing]

203
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,291
[grass rustling]

204
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,500
[insects chirping]

205
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,541
Oh, you don't wanna be down there,
Mrs. Pretty. That ain't safe.

206
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,083
Spooner and John Jacobs
are making supports.

207
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,375
We can't continue without them now.

208
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,416
I was reading Howard Carter's account

209
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,000
of his excavation
of the tomb of Tutankhamun.

210
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:35,916
[Brown] Oh?

211
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,625
He stood at the threshold
of the burial chamber,

212
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,125
the first man to do so for 3,000 years,

213
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,375
and he saw finger marks
still on the paint.

214
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,666
He say, "Time lost its meaning."

215
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,500
It occurs to me
that you might unearth human remains.

216
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,833
[Brown] Yeah, that's possible.

217
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,333
[Pretty]
We're digging down to meet the dead.

218
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,250
Disinterring them, in fact.

219
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,416
[Brown] There's always coroner's inquests
when remains are found.

220
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:17,750
The dead still get that courtesy,
no matter how many centuries they've lain.

221
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,958
We can't dig down into the earth
without considering that--

222
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,875
Oh!

223
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,708
-[soil rustles]
-[sound muffles]

224
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,166
[Pretty, muffled] Brown?

225
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,291
-[soil shifting]
-[Pretty gasps]

226
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,875
Mr. Brown?

227
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,416
Spooner! Jacob! Get help!

228
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,208
-[sound fades]
-[tense orchestral music playing]

[orchestral music swells]

230
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,250
[man] There! There! There!

231
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:32,875
Come on, Basil!

232
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,166
[group clamoring indistinctly]

233
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,166
[Pretty cries out indistinctly]

234
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,708
[Pretty] Careful with his head.

235
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,708
[group grunting]

236
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,208
[tense orchestral music continues playing]

237
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,958
[Pretty] Mr. Brown!听Mr. Brown!

238
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,291
Mr. Brown!

239
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,791
Mr. Brown?

240
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,500
[sputters]

241
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,750
-[Pretty] That's it.
-[Jacobs] That's it.

242
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,708
-[Brown gasps]
-Mr. Brown.听Mr. Brown.

243
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,208
-[groans]
-[Pretty breathing shakily]

244
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,958
You're all right now.
You're all right. You're all right.

245
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,416
[sighs, chuckles] You're all right.

246
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,250
Into the library, Grateley.
Lay him on the sofa.

247
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,875
[somber piano music playing]

248
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,625
[sighs tremulously]

249
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,583
[Pretty] Did you see something?

250
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:39,833
[Brown] See something?

251
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,166
When you were gone.

252
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh钬?
260
Something did come into my head.

253
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:49,875
What was it?

254
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,958
[clicks tongue] My, uh钬?my grandfather.

255
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,000
I have his name.

256
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,416
Basil Brown.

257
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,083
Farming man.

258
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,583
Taught me everything I know
about Suffolk soil.

259
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,166
And you saw him?

260
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,875
[Brown] Oh, I saw nothing at all.
I was just钬?
269
I just thought of him. [sighs]

261
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,916
Well钬?perhaps he saw you.
[chuckles softly]

262
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,250
-Excuse me.
-Mr. Brown, are you all right?

263
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,333
[Pretty] Mr. Brown!

264
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,916
Mr. Brown, you have to rest!

265
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,375
See, Mrs. Pretty钬?this one is the one you like.

266
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,416
It's the one you wanted me to start on.
It's oval.

267
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,375
Like a hog's back.

268
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,000
[both panting]

269
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:44,541
-See? All the others, circular.
-Yes.

270
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,083
Now,
this land's been plowed for 1,000 year.

271
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,166
Now, supposing whoever plowed here钬?
281
gradually knocked a bit off.

272
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,125
So, by the time robbers come along,

273
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,625
they'd have sunk the flute
into what they thought was the center.

274
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,041
-[Pretty] But it might not have been.
-[Brown] That's right.

275
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,250
East to west, that's my feeling.

276
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,708
[chuckles] You say the word钬?
287
[laughs]

277
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,333
钬nd I'll dig.

278
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,000
[Pretty chuckles]

279
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,833
[energetic instrumental music playing]

280
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,125
[Robert] My plane crashed
into the Arctic waste, you see.

281
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,375
And when I woke up, 500 years had passed.

282
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:53,250
-So, now I'm stuck in the 25th century.
-[Brown] What's that like, then?

283
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,541
Well,
the Earth is controlled by Killer Kane,

284
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,083
who's an extremely evil man.

285
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,250
[Brown] Like Hitler?

286
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,083
[chuckles]
Yes, with an even worse mustache.

287
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,000
Did the people

288
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,583
who made these burial mounds
have mustaches?

289
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,791
[Brown] And beards.

290
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,458
They were a very beardy lot.

291
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:12,083
Not like them there Romans.
Now, they liked the close shave.

292
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,958
The Vikings and the space pilots
are the same, really, aren't they?

293
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,791
They explore new lands
and have battles in ships.

294
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:25,250
Yeah, when you put it like that,
I suppose they might be the same.

295
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,500
[warplanes roaring]

296
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,000
[Robert] They come over all the time.
There's an RAF base nearby.

297
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,166
[imitates weaponry firing]

298
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,708
Would you like to fly, Mr. Brown?

299
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,041
[Brown] Oh, but I do.

300
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:43,833
All over the cosmos,
every time I look through my telescope.

301
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,958
You钬?You have a telescope?

302
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,375
-I do.
-[Robert] Did you bring it with you?

303
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,625
[Brown] I did.

304
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,375
Well, will you show me?

305
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:53,500
I might.

306
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,916
[Robert chuckles softly]

Cor! He likes to natter, he does.

309
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,916
What was all that about space travel?

310
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,791

Mr. Brown had an awful lot of books.

312
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,333
Came on his bike
with a great parcel of them.

313
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,875
Sloan says some are in Norwegian.

314
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,916
Shall we try the green silk?

315
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,666
-It's an old favorite, isn't it?
-[Pretty] No.

316
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,708
The velvet with the lace.

[footsteps approach]

320
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,666
[Grateley] Mrs. Lyons hopes it will agree.

321
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,125
[Pretty] How's your leg, Mr.听Grateley?

322
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,208
Oh, much better, ma'am.
Thank you for inquiring.

323
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:56,875
Would you like the wireless?

324
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,666
-[Pretty] Yes, please.

326
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,041
are now being asked to stand by

327
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,125
for further training
as RAF pilots or crew.

328
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,166
[Mrs. Lyons] She's only been here 12 year.

329
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,083
-[Billy] Mm-hmm.
-Came down from Cheshire.

330
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,875
Then she married the colonel.

331
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:19,333
He first met with Edith
when she was still at school.

332
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,916
And on his 17th birthday,
he asked her to marry him.

333
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,458
-She turned him down.
-[Billy] Mm.

334
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,333
She say
she can't possibly leave her father.

335
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,791
[Billy grunts softly]

336
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:36,541
[Mrs. Lyons] She cared for her father
another 13 year, until he died.

337
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,875
[Billy] After 13 years.

338
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:42,000
[Mrs. Lyons] She finally accepted
the colonel's proposal.

339
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,916
He been asking every year on her birthday.

340
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,125
[Billy] On her birthday.

341
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,958
[Mrs. Lyons] Just after they had Robert钬?
353
her husband went and died too.

342
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,708
-[Billy] Mm-hmm.
-[Pretty kisses]

343
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,541
[Mrs. Lyons] Imagine that.

[Brown]
Do any of you want to look through this?

347
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,125
-[man] I thought we'd sit down on that.
-[Brown] You have a go.

348
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:14,791
That's right.

349
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:19,041
-[Jacobs] I'm gonna follow you back home.
-[group laughing]

[Brown] Maynard! Maynard!

361
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,916
They found an iron rivet
at the burial mound at Snape, didn't they?

362
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,208
[Maynard] Snape?
Basil, what have you found?

363
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,750
My goodness, Basil.

364
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:04,041
-[Spooner] Right. Any joy, Basil?
-[Brown] Coming along together.

365
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,500
Mr. Spooner, will you bring
my tape measure from the hut?

366
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,666
One of you best get Mrs. Pretty down here.

367
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,375
-[Jacobs] She's gone up to London.
-She what? How long?

368
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:16,041
[Jacobs] London, with Robert.
Couple of days.

369
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,958
[sighs] Blast.

370
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:22,083
Right, boys. Here we go. Come on together.

371
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,541
Better have something to show
Mrs. Pretty when she get back.

372
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,416
-[knocking on door]
-[Grateley] And the crystal glasses!

373
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,208
No, no, no. Side door, please.

374
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:34,416
-Mrs. Pretty back from London yet?
-Mrs. Pretty's about to dine.

375
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,833
[Brown] I told you it was urgent.

376
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,833
[Grateley] Mr. Brown, I'm sure
you wouldn't like to interfere with--

377
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,583
[Pretty] It's all right, Mr. Grateley.

378
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:44,041
-Is it Mr. Brown?
-[Pretty] Yes, darling. Darling

379
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,541
I think you'd better come and see.

380
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,333
[soaring orchestral music playing]

381
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,416
[Brown] That's a ship.

382
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,041
[Robert] How do you mean, a ship?

383
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:14,916
[Brown] Oh, well, that's a ship
that's been buried in the mound.

384
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,375
[Robert]
Why would anyone want to bury a ship?

385
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,083
[Brown] Well,
I expect because that's a grave.

386
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,375
[Robert] Whose grave?

387
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,041
[Brown] Well, I'd expect
this is a grave of a钬?a great man.

388
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,208
A warrior钬?
401
or a king.

389
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:37,125
They must have pulled his ship all the way
up that there hill from the river.

390
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:42,208
Now, they'd have put it on ropes,
and they'd have hauled it over logs.

391
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:47,083
Men, horses. It must have taken
hundreds of 'em. [chuckles]

392
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,500
I don't expect them to go
to all this trouble for any little squirt.

393
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:54,208
Can you imagine
the send-off they'd be giving him?

394
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,500
The songs they'd be singing. [laughs]

395
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,958
They'd have drunk Mr. Spooner
under the table.

396
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:01,833
-[Brown and Pretty laugh]
-[Robert] Vikings?

397
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,375
[sniffles] Well, I钬?I think that's older.

398
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,791
Maynard disagrees,
but I think it's Anglo-Saxon.

399
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:12,250
Now, this is your doing, John Jacobs,
'cause you found the first rivet.

400
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,041
-[Jacobs chuckles]
-That's right, Mrs. Pretty. He did.

401
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,791
Congratulations, Mr. Brown.

402
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,666
[Brown chuckles] Well, you thought
there was something, didn't you?

403
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,250
I had my feeling.

404
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,750
That you did, Mrs. Pretty. That you did.

405
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,208
[Pretty] Oh, John.

406
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,583
-Congratulations, Mr. Spooner.
-[Spooner] Thank you, ma'am.

407
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,625
[Brown] We couldn't have done it
without this young man here.

408
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,625
[kisses] Psst.

409
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,791
[softly] Robert, a ship!

410
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:39,791
[kisses]

411
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,416
[Robert] Thank you. Mr. Brown.

412
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,916
[Brown] Well,
there's a lot of earth to钬?to shift now.

413
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,250
But who knows?

414
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,791
I'm pretty sure it continues further.

415
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,250

[man] Evening.

419
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,666
Evening.

421

[Reid Moir]
Do you realize what this means?

422
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,125
It's going to change everything
for Ipswich.

423
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:44,333
We'll be the envy
of every museum in the country.

424
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,583
-You're gonna get wet, Mrs. Pretty.
-[Pretty] I'm afraid I already am.

425
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,208
[Brown grunts]

426
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:57,541
[Pretty] Mr. Reid听Moir has kindly offered
to take charge of the dig.

427
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,750
I turned his generous offer down.

428
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,083
-You didn't.
-[Pretty] I did.

429
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,583
[chuckles, splutters] What did he say?

430
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:10,375
He said I couldn't keep it to myself,
which is true.

431
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,708
[chuckling] I bet he blew his gasket.

432
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,791
In the meantime, I've asked my cousin,
Rory Lomax, to come.

433
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,833
-[Brown] Right.
-I can see you need another pair of hands.

434
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:21,541
He's only an amateur,
but then, so is Mr. Reid Moir.

435
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,666
-[both chuckle]
-[thunder rumbling]

436
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,583
-Mrs. Pretty, you better go in the shed.
-Oh, yes.

437
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:29,208
-[Brown] You're gonna get very wet here.
-[Pretty] I will.

438

[Brown panting]

441
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:47,916
[Pretty] I wanted to thank you
for your patience with Robert.

442
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:50,333
He can hardly wait to see you
in the mornings.

443
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,916
[Brown] Well, keeps me on me toes,
having him around.

444
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,625
Do you have children?

445
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,708
No, uh, we, uh钬?
459
No.

446
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,250
[Brown sniffles]

447
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,583
[Pretty] The servants tell me
you've studied everything,

448
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,208
from Latin to geology.

449
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:16,833
[Brown] Well, a little education
is a dangerous thing.

450
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,916
[Pretty] Hmm.
Apparently, you've written a book.

451
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,041
[Brown] I have.

452
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:23,708
A guide to astronomical maps and charts,

453
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:27,500
to make them accessible to ordinary men.

454
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,750
[Brown] I left school when I was 12.

455
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,750
Always had a hunger to study.

456
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,541
[Pretty] I got a place
at London University.

457
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,458
My father wouldn't hear of it.

[birds singing]

459
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,291
Would you have dinner with me?

460
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,583
Well钬?thank you. Yes.

461
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,000
[Pretty exhales]

462
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,166
[Brown] Evening, Vera.

463
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,875
Surprise for you, Basil, in your room.

464
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:32,708
[Brown] Right.

465
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,958
May.

466
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,625
I brought you some fresh shirts.

467
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,333
-[Brown chuckles]
-About time, I say.

468
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:53,208
-Are you pleased to see me?
-Of course I am.

469
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:55,125
[sighs, chuckles softly]

470
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:58,666
-You didn't know I was coming, did you?
-[Brown] No. No, I didn't.

471
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:00,583
I did tell you.

472
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,000
In my last letter.

473
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:07,250
[Brown] Oh,
I was saving them for the weekend.

474
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,083
I've been working every hour.
You know what I'm like. [chuckles]

475
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,750
Yes钬?I do.

476
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,666
[Brown] I'm very busy.

477
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,291
-It looks like it. Nowhere to sit in here.
-[Brown] There's a lot going on here.

478
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,708
-What's that?
-I said there's nowhere to sit down.

479
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,166
[Brown] Yeah. Sorry about that.
It's all-- So much going on.

480
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,166
You got something to show me?
I think you have.

481
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,708
I can see it in your eyes.

482
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:31,208
I'm not saying anything.

483
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:33,041
[indistinct chatter]

484
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:35,458
[maid] There's Mr. Brown with a woman.

485
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:41,416
I suppose it's his wife.
You know, she writes to him every day.

486
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:45,958
[knocking on door]

487
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:46,916
Come in.

488
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,291
Mr. Brown sends his apologies, ma'am.

489
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:01,375
That's all. Thank you, Ellen. [sighs]

490
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,458
[Brown] A man could dig the earth
his whole life through

491
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,375
and not find anything
like I've discovered here.

492
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:12,666
-[May] She's beautiful, all right.
-[Brown] Yeah, she's beautiful.

493
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,541
[May] You'll have to watch your back
with a thing like this.

494
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:16,625
[Brown] What do you mean?

495
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:19,916
[May] Everyone's gonna want a piece
of this here ship, and this is your find.

496
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:23,291
[Brown] Oh, May钬?
511
[May] Don't let Ipswich Museum
take your glory.

497
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,833
-[Brown] He's not gonna take--
-[May] Or that lady at the manor.

498
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:28,416
-She should be upping your wages again.
-[Brown] She's supportive.

499
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,541
-[May] You asked?
-[Brown] I ain't gonna ask for more.

500
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,958
[Brown] Well, she's very, very gracious,
Mrs. Pretty.

501
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:36,125
[May] Your heart's lost
to this Viking maiden, I can tell.

502
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,125
Innit?

503
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:42,291
[Brown] Ah, May, you sure you don't want
to stay the night?

504
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,916
I'll miss my lift back.

505
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,916
[Brown] Right, yeah, um钬?
521
Well, thanks for coming, May.

506
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,958
[sighs] I do miss you.

507
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,583
-I've been reading your books for company.
-You haven't.

508
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,750
-[May] I have.
-[scoffs]

509
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,041
[laughing] Hell,
it's not much company, is it?

510
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:06,000
-[May] No, they're hard work, I tell you.
-They are.

511
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,000
[both laughing]

512
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,083
Right. Well,
it's good of you to bring my shirts.

513
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,583
-[May] Yeah.
-[Brown grunts]

514
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:13,541
All right.

515
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,500
[Brown] I'll read them letters tonight.

516
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,791
-[May] Bye, then.
-[Brown] Bye.

517
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,125
[engine rumbles]

518
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,750
[Brown breathing deeply]

519
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:35,208
-[thunder rumbles]
-[Brown gasps, sighs]

520
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,708
Blast!

521
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,333
[rain pattering]

522
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,083
Ah!

523
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:49,625
[groans]

524
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:54,833
[grunting and panting]

525
00:35:58,666 --> 00:35:59,875
[grunts]

526
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,291
-[strains]
-[young man yelps]

527
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,500
[Brown gasps, grunts]

528
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,250
-Let me help.
-[Brown] Right.

529
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,916
Right, then.
Get around that side and take this tarp.

530
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,791
That's钬?That's right.听That's right.
There's a stake there behind you.

531
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:19,750
Pull it hard.

532
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,208
[Brown] Where in God's name
did you come from?

533
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,708
[young man] I rode, actually,

534
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:28,083
on my motorbike from Ipswich. [sniffles]

535
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,625
I'm Rory Lomax.

536
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:32,333
[Brown] Aye. Did Reid Moir send you?

537
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,458
-From the museum?
-[thunder rumbles]

538
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,416
I'm Edith Pretty's cousin.

539
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,166
She telephoned, asked me to come.

540
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,625
-Said you needed an extra pair of hands.
-All right.

541
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:45,583
I pointed out my general lack of skill,
but she was undeterred.

542
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:51,666
Right. Well钬?
559
no doubt you'll hear
that my name is Brown. Basil Brown.

543
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,750
[Rory] Good to meet you.

544
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:55,041
[Brown] Now,
it's gonna be raining for a while,

545
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,375
so go on and take a seat. [sniffles]

546
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:00,666
I expect you'd, uh, be wet,
coming from Ipswich on a motorbike.

547
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,416
-[Rory] I was, rather.
-[Brown] Yeah.

548
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,708
-[Rory] Just caught me at the end.
-[Brown] Right.

549
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:07,625
Well, I'll light the stove.
Would you like some tea?

550
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:09,083
[Rory chuckles] Yes, please.

551
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:12,875
[Brown] I think we may have found, um,
an old, uh, Anglo-Saxon ship.

552
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:16,666
When this rain clears tomorrow,
maybe you can see what we're doing.

553
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,833
-Yeah?
-How very exciting.

554
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,750
Yeah, it's all right.

555
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,291
[thunder rumbles]

556
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,208
-[Jacobs] Not gonna cover it.
-[Brown] Get the second tarp.

557
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,000
-Pass me the hammer, please.
-[Jacobs] Right.

558
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:34,625
[Spooner] All right, then.

559
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:36,708
[Brown] Lift up.

560
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:38,958
-[panting]
-[Brown] That's right.

561
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,916
[indistinct chatter]

562
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:46,125
Rory!

563
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,208
Hello, Spud.

564
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,333
[grunts] Arrived in the night.
Didn't want to wake you.

565
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,333
Where's your mother?

566
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:55,541
-[steam engine approaching]
-[Robert] Oh, she's gone to London.

567
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,041
[train whistle blows]

568
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:00,333
[passengers clamoring]

569
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,666
[somber piano music playing]

570
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,166
[man] Who knows
if we'll still be alive in a year?

571
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:23,250
[announcer on听loudspeaker]
The yellow and green balls denote gas.

572
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,125
-Red denotes high explosives.
-[children laughing]

573
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:29,166
[announcer]
Red stripes are incendiary bombs.

574
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,708
If you are caught on the streets
during an air raid,

575
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:37,333
you must know the appropriate response
to each form of attack.

576
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,708
No, don't throw them about!

577
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,958
[Pretty] I was rushing
to get here on time.

578
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:07,416
Might that have affected the results?

579
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:12,333
[doctor] Possibly, but the,
uh, underlying condition is there.

580
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:15,750
The pneumatic fever
you had as a child, it, uh,

581
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,833
damaged the valves of your heart.

582
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,875
Irreparably, I'm afraid.

583
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,958
Another attack
is likely to be much钬?more serious.

584
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,666
Possibly even fatal.

585
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,375
-Is there nothing else that can be done?
-[doctor] I'm sorry. I钬β营钬?
603
I wish I had better news.

586
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,958
[continues speaking indistinctly]

587
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:52,916
[Pretty sighs deeply]

588
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,541
[somber piano music swells]

589
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:05,708
[bells tolling]

590
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:31,250
[indistinct chatter]

591
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,791
[parking brake clicks]

592
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,958
[Grateley] Mr. Reid Moir is here, ma'am,
with some other gentlemen.

593
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,791
They wouldn't stop to give me their names.

594
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,625
Then they're trespassing. Where are they?

595
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,708
-On their way to the mounds.
-Fetch them, quickly.

596
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:12,166
-Right.
-[Pretty] Lyons?

597
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,125
[sighs]

598
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,500
[Brown] Now, I've been reading up
about the听Oseberg Ship.

599
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:24,375
That's a Viking ship they found in Norway.

600
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:28,583
There was a burial chamber
in the center, roofed.

601
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:31,250
It's a bit like we imagine Noah's Ark.

602
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,833
Course, any roof here
would have caved in long ago.

603
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,750
See, this line here.

604
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:41,416
The ground is higher,
but this soil is darker.

605
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,500
So you think there's something beneath?

606
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:47,791
Well, we may know by the end of today.

607
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,416
Ye gods!

608
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,625
This is incredible!

609
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:56,333
[Reid Moir] We at the Ipswich Museum
pride ourselves on our work,

610
00:41:56,416 --> 00:42:00,041
and I钬?I think you'll agree
that it's rock solid.

611
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:03,458
-[Brown] You钬?You need to stop there.
-I beg your pardon?

612
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:05,791
This is a very delicate site,
and it ain't safe.

613
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,708
Uh, not for a man of your size.

614
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,166
Is this your work?

615
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,625
Uh, yes. I'm Basil Brown, excavator.

616
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,083
[clears throat]
Well, Basil Brown, excavator钬?
635
I am Charles Phillips, archaeologist,

617
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,416
and I'm here to tell you that,

618
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,458
as this is a find of national interest,

619
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:33,791
the British Museum will be taking charge.

620
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,541
Your work钬?
640
looks, thankfully, decent,

621
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:42,791
but your excavating service
is no longer required.

622
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:47,166
Am钬?Am I to understand
that you will be personally taking over?

623
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:50,791
Grimes,
I have never seen anything like it.

624
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,666
-Quite, sir.
-Brailesford.

625
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,416
-Sir.
-[Phillips] Cancel everything I've got.

626
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,458
Find out who's free. We need Piggott.

627
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:01,208
-Find us lodgings, as near as you can.
-[Brailesford] Yes, sir.

628
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,583
[Reid Moir] That dark soil in the middle,
C.W., looks very promising.

629
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,250
You men, finish up,
and don't move another pebble!

630
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:09,708
[Brown] Excuse me, Mr. Phillips.

631
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:13,000
[splutters] I'm not employed by you.

632
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:15,125
I'm employed by Mrs. Pretty,

633
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:18,083
and I'll keep on working
until she tells me different.

634
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:23,166
An ad hoc team from a provincial museum
cannot be left in charge.

635
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:26,250
Mrs. Pretty must see that.

636
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:30,833
[lock clicks]

637
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:31,916
[doorbell ringing]

638
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,541
John, a minute is all I need.
I钬?I know she'll want to hear this.

639
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,958
-All right, all right. Wait here.
-Right.

640
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,750
[muttering softly]

641
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:46,500
[Grateley] She'll see you tomorrow morning
at 10:30.

642
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,375
She must know what I found.

643
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,708
-[Grateley] Don't push it, old boy!
-[Brown] She must know!

644
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:51,791
-[slams]
-[Brown] John!

645
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:55,000
[door rattles, creaks open]

646
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,333
[door closes]

647
00:43:56,416 --> 00:44:00,000
-Is he gone, Mr. Grateley?
-[Brown] It's not Grateley.

648
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,541
[Pretty gasps]

649
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:08,625
I钬?I'm sorry for disturbing you,
but I believe钬?
670
we may have found
a burial chamber in the ship.

650
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:14,041
-Does Mr. Phillips know?
-[Brown] I don't work for Mr. Phillips.

651
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,458
What are your wishes?

652
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:25,041
I, uh钬?He just informed me that,
by order of the Ministry of Works,

653
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,250
the site must be placed under his control.

654
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:33,083
Well, uh钬?[sighs]

655
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:35,916
钬hat's that, then.

656
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,416
[sound fading]

657
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:41,875
[Brown, muffled] Well, I钬?I can carry on for one more day钬?
679
if that's what you'd like.

658
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:43,875
[somber instrumental music playing]

659
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,458
Are钬?Are you poorly, Mrs. Pretty?

660
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,500
Um钬?[sighs]

661
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,208
Perhaps you might, um钬?
684
might ring the bell for me.

662
00:44:57,958 --> 00:44:58,791
Right.

663
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:00,500
[bell rings]

664
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,083
He's got no right to dictate to you.

665
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,750
This ship's only appearing because of you.

666
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,708
Don't forget why you wanted it begun.

667
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,958
Now, you said that was a feeling.

668
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,875
Your feeling is right.

669
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:14,166
[door creaks open]

670
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:20,875
-Mr. Brown seems to have found his way in.
-[Grateley] Mr. Brown.

671
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,625
All right.

672
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,166
[Pretty breathing shakily]

673
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,416
[Grateley] Is there anything
I could bring you?

674
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,958
Fetch Ellen for me, please.

675
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:45,416
[sighs deeply]

676
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:56,125

[exhales deeply]

[wind whistles]

682
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,750
[Phillips]
Mrs. Pretty is keen to keep you on,

683
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,916
so we'll make good use of you.

684
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,166
Your primary task
will be to keep the site in order.

685
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:15,750
So, I want the tumulus dug back
to an area of four feet on either side,

686
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,708
and I want those spoil heaps removed.

687
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,083
From now on,

688
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:24,708
you're not to set foot in the body
of the ship without my express permission.

689
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:25,791
Carry on.

690
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:28,750
[Jacobs]
Are you gonna put up with that, Basil?

691
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:39,583
[Brown sighs]

692
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:48,750
[Robert] Hello, Mr. Brown.

693
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,208
-My mother's got her heartburn.
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

694
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:56,083
She has to have peace and quiet.
I made her this.

695
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,958
-[Brown] Well, that's a very fine rocket.
-Where are you going?

696
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:02,250
Oh, I钬?Oh, I have to go home now.

697
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:04,375
When will you be back?

698
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:10,333
Well, uh钬?I'm sorry, Robert. I钬?
722
I am.

699
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:17,791
Uh, but, Mr. Brown钬?
724
Mr. Brown!

700
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:22,416
-Mr. Brown!
-[Rory] It seems I'm out of a job.

701
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,833
[Rory] Phillips won't let us in his ship.

702
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,125
His ship? Really?

703
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,500
I thought I might take some photographs.
It could make a useful record.

704
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,416
-Would you mind?
-Not at all.

705
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,041
-As long as they're not of me.
-[camera clicks]

706
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,750
Can't say I blame Brown.

707
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:42,125
Such a decent man
doesn't deserve Phillips.

708
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:43,458
Blame him?

709
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:45,208
Well, he left this morning.
Didn't you know?

710
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:47,875
Where's Robert?

711
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:51,250
[water pours]

712
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:54,041
[Robert panting]

[horn blares]

714
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,750
You don't have another job?

715
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,416
I'll write to Maynard,
and he'll give me something.

716
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,666
[May]
Did you tell Mrs. Pretty you were leaving?

717
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,375
[Brown]
I thought I'd let her work it out herself.

718
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:23,625
And that's the thanks she gets

719
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:25,708
for giving you the opportunity
in the first place?

720
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:28,708
Mark my words, May,
I won't receive any credit.

721
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,416
-I won't even be a footnote.
-[May] Is that why you took the job?

722
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,833
-For credit?
-How can I stay on?

723
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:35,416
Is that why you've been digging
your whole life for barely enough

724
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,416
to cover our rent?

725
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,708
No, May. I do it 'cause I'm good at it.

726
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:42,750
'Cause that's what my father taught me,
and what his father taught him.

727
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:46,000
'Cause you can show me a handful of soil
from anywhere in Suffolk,

728
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,708
and I can pretty much tell you
whose land it's from.

729
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:49,791
There you go.

-[bicycle bell rings]
-[Robert panting]

732
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:58,958
[Robert] Excuse me.
Do you know Basil Brown?

733
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:01,250
-Do you know where he lives?
-Yes, I know Basil.

734
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,666
He lives on a farm outside of the village.
Carry on that way.

735
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,875
Thank you so much.

736
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:12,583
[groans]

737
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,208
I found that ship.

738
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:35,083
I may not be a fellow at Cambridge,
but I worked out what was down there.

739
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:39,208
And Jacobs and Spooner, too,
and nobody'll remember that.

740
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,708
You don't know that.

741
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,458
And if you're not around
to see it to the end,

742
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,750
there's even less chance.

743
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:49,750
You always told me your work
isn't about the past or even the present.

744
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,000
It's for the future.

745
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:55,541
So that the next generations
can know where they came from.

746
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,833
The line
that joins them to their forebears.

747
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:00,333
Isn't that what you always say?

748
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,416
Yeah, something like that.

749
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:08,208
[May] Why else would the lot of you
be playing in the dirt

750
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,708
while the rest of the country
prepares for war?

751
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:14,791
-Because that means something, innit?
-[Brown sighs]

752
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:19,416
Something that'll last longer
than whatever damn war we're heading into.

753
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:25,166
Good hell.

00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,416
That's Robert.

-Robert?

[Brown]
Robert, have you cycled all this way?

759
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,083
You promised.

760
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:39,916
May! May!

761
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:43,541
You said you'd show me the cosmos.
You promised.

762
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:46,791
-Good heavens! Who have we here?
-[Brown] This is Robert Pretty.

763
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,166
[May] Robert, I'm Mrs. Brown.

764
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:51,458
I bet you have a rare thirst
after that long ride, don't you?

765
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,583
-[Robert] Mm-hmm.
-Come you here.

766
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:55,958
-Let's get you a cup of milk.
-[Brown] That's a long way.

767
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:57,666
Does your mother know you're here, Robert?

768
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,916
-[May] How'd you find your way?
-She know you cycled?

769
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,541
-[May] Should I take your bike for you?
-[Robert] Yes, please.

770
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,916
I better find a telephone, May.
Call Mrs. Pretty.

771
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,875
[car approaching]

772
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:16,666
[Brown] Ah.

773
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:19,583
-[Pretty] Thank you.
-[Brown] He's all right.

774
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:22,666
-He's inside. Uh, come this way.
-[Pretty] Thank you.

775
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,250
-We were obviously very worried.
-Yes. He's钬β燞e's钬?
801
Uh, this is May, my wife.

776
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,458
-Mrs. Pretty.
-Thank you very much.

777
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:32,833
He's been no trouble. A lovely boy.

778
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:35,458
Mrs. Brown has a music box from Whitby

779
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:37,666
covered in all manner of shells.

780
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,875
Would you like to see?

781
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:42,083
Uh, no.
We've imposed on your kindness enough.

782
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,166
What were you thinking?

783
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:47,125
You could have been lost or killed.

784
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:51,416
-Robert钬?what were you thinking?
-[Robert] I'm sorry, Mother.

785
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,875
Uh, Robert came to remind me
of a promise that I made.

786
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:58,458
I said I'd show him the stars
through my telescope.

787
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,041
Didn't I?

788
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:02,125
Then you're returning?

789
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,291
I am. Yes.

790
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:11,416
Thank you. [sighs]

791
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,208
[Rory] Morning!

792
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,875
[Brown] Morning.

793
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:29,458
Mr. Grimes. I've been, uh钬?taking notes.

794
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,333
-Ah!
-If they be of any use.

795
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,291
Why, they'd save me days.

796
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:39,500
-You must have suspected what was here.
-[Brown] Well, you've made good progress.

797
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,166
[Grimes] As did you.

798
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,250
Thank you kindly.

799
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:46,708
-[Grimes] It's fine work, Mr. Brown.
-[Brown] Yeah. Well, we made a start.

800
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:50,541
-Phillips.
-[Phillips] Our excavator has returned.

801
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:51,458
[Brown] Morning.

802
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:53,541
[Phillips] There's a sign
in the bottom of the ship

803
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:56,125
that there could be an intact chamber.

804
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:57,916
[Piggott] Tremendously exciting.

805
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,166
[warplanes roaring overhead]

806
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:04,791
[Phillips grunts]

807
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,208
[Piggott] What about events
in the wider world, C.W.?

808
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,166
How do you think it will affect us?

809
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,833
[Phillips] Judging by last night's news钬?
836
I think we could be at war
in a matter of weeks,

810
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:18,166
and every excavation
in the land will stop.

811
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:21,916
-So, it's up to us. [clears throat]
-[Piggott sighs]

812
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,666
-Oh, good lord. [gasps]
-Gosh.

813
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,250
-[Piggott] Jim! Billy Grimes!
-Stuart!

814
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,416
-How the devil are you?
-[Piggott chuckles] Very well.

815
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,625
-This is my wife, Margaret.
-Peggy.

816
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,916
[Brailesford] Mrs. Piggott,
a pleasure to meet you.

817
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,541
[Peggy] Mr. Phillips, I-- um,
I wanted to say how pleased I was

818
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,291
that you specifically asked
for me to come.

819
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,875
I know Stuart sent you my paper
on Bosnian Lake villagers.

820
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:46,500
It was awfully good of you to read it.

821
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:50,500
Ah, yes. Um, very stimulating.

822
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:54,000
[Peggy chuckles] I hope
I'll be able to repay your faith in me.

823
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,458
[Phillips] I have no doubt.

824
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:58,458
It's just that I haven't done
much actual fieldwork yet.

825
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:01,833
Uh, so I wouldn't want you to think
I'm more experienced than I听really am.

826
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:04,875
[Phillips]
Ah, you have all the key attributes.

827
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:06,833
[Peggy] Do I?

828
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:08,875
-This ship is very delicate.
-[Peggy] Mm-hmm.

829
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:12,291
One could say, it,
um, scarcely exists at all.

830
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,083
Too much weight, it disintegrates.

831
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:20,416
You're probably less than nine stone,
so I'll supervise from here

832
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,458
while you light things
get on with the digging.

833
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:28,208
Am I to understand
you only asked for me because of my size?

834
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,000
Uh, lucky guess, actually.

835
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,041
[chuckles] Yeah, thank God
Piggott didn't marry a piglet.

836
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:36,583
[group laughs]

837
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,208
[Phillips] Carry on!

838
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:40,291
[somber instrumental music playing]

839
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:53,000
-[Phillips] How does it look to you?
-[Brailesford] Sir?

840
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:56,291
-[camera clicks]
-[crew chattering]

841
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:02,291
[Phillips] What have you got there?

842
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,458
[camera clicks]

843
00:56:06,041 --> 00:56:10,000
-[seagulls crying]
-[Robert imitating weaponry firing]

844
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:16,625
[camera clicks]

845
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,291
[Brailesford] All right, then.

846
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:33,291
[camera clicks]

847
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:39,500
[indistinct chatter]

848
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:43,625
-[Piggott] First round's on me, chaps!
-[Phillips] Very nice of you.

849
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:46,125
[group continues chattering indistinctly]

850
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:56,000
[Peggy laughing]

851
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,750
[coughs] Do they not have a钬?a double?

852
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,250
[Piggott] Sorry, darling, no.
This is fine, though, isn't it?

853
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:05,166
We don't钬?We don't want to start by making a fuss.

854
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,000
Oh, no. Of course not.

855
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:11,375
We're so lucky to be part of this. [sighs]

856
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:13,041
[Peggy] Yes.

857
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:17,166
-[exhales] Yes, it's going to be amazing.
-Mm.

858
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,000
[exhales]

859
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,291
Would you prefer this bed钬?
887
or钬?or钬?or that one?

860
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:29,250
I'll钬?I'll take this one, shall I?

861
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:31,791
[Peggy sighs]

862
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:37,958
[Brown] You need to find a star
and identify its direction of travel.

863
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:41,541
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-[Brown] Good evening, Mrs. Pretty.

864
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,583
-Hello, Mother.
-[Pretty] Hello, darling.

865
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:45,958
Ah!

866
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:49,625
[Robert]
Do space pilots navigate using the stars?

867
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:51,583
[Brown] Oh, most certainly, they do.

868
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:56,916
Ten more minutes, Commander. Then, bed.

869
00:57:57,958 --> 00:57:59,958
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

870
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,750
[Robert] I see a star.

871
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,875
[group singing indistinctly]

872
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:28,291
[birds singing]

873
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,833
[Brown] All right.

874
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:37,625
[Peggy grunting]

875
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:39,500
[screams]

876
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,666
-Oh, God!
-[Phillips] What's going on?

877
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,333
-[Peggy] It just gave way.
-[Phillips] Get her off there!

878
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:46,916
-Piggott, get her off!
-Oh, I'm so sorry!

879
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,083
-I didn't mean to damage anything.
-[Piggott sighs] Oh, you钬?
908
-What you got, Brailesford?
-[Brown] You all right?

880
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
[Brailesford] Sort of rusted lumps.

881
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,916
[Phillips] Come on, man.
Where's your training?

882
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,041
[Brailesford] Uh, an amorphous mass
of corroded objects, sir.

883
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:03,541
You, get your camera down there.
Photograph it.

884
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,791
That's钬?That's very hot in the full sun.

885
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,458
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.

886
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:12,250
Watch your step there.
This could well be our chamber.

887
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,958
[Pretty] Some barley water, Mrs. Piggott?

888
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:18,708
-[sighs] Thank you. So clumsy.
-[Pretty] Oh, not at all.

889
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:22,125
-[flies buzzing]
-[Peggy exhales] Oh.

890
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:24,041
-That's a very lovely skirt.
-[Peggy] Oh.

891
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:28,541
[chuckles] Completely useless.
I don't have anything more suitable.

892
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:31,083
-We came straight from our holiday.
-Did you really?

893
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:33,750
-[Peggy chuckles] Yes.
-[Pretty] Well, come to the house.

894
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,916
Let's see what we can find.

895
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:41,333
Is Mrs. Pretty still poorly?

896
00:59:47,666 --> 00:59:49,333
She says she's perfectly fine, but钬?
926
[whispering] 钬hat's typical of her.

897
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:54,250
[men hollering, laughing]

898
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:56,041
Damn this weather.

899
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,125
Losing a whole day.

900
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,208
So little time before world events钬?
931
confound us.

901
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,916
[men continue laughing]

902
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,833
[Phillips] It's a race, an absolute race.

903
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:14,666
[Pretty] Then you are wasting
the talents of Mr. Brown.

904
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:17,625
Well, that's an excellent idea.

905
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:21,875
Stuart couldn't fault his work.
Could he not be unearthing the stern?

906
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:24,416
[Phillips] Mr. Brown isn't qualified.

907
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,625
Well, that's just snobbery,
isn't it, Mr. Phillips?

908
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:33,625
[Brailesford and Piggott
chuckling and chatting]

909
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:36,000
-[Phillips] Brown!
-[Peggy clears throat]

910
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:38,875
[Phillips] Brown!

911
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,875
Brown, come here, man!

912
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,750
[footsteps approaching]

913
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,041
[Piggott gasps] Oh my God, Margaret.

914
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:00,666
[Peggy sighs]

915
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,291
[exhales]

916
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:04,875
Sorry. I forgot to lock the door.

917
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:08,416
[chuckles] No, you see,
we钬?we钬β爓e share that bathroom

918
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,500
with钬?with four other rooms,
and, you know, I could have been anyone.

919
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:15,916
-Um, I could've been Grimes or Phillips.
-[Peggy scoffs]

920
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,500
But you're not. You're my husband.

921
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:20,458
[chuckles] Yes,
but how钬?how do you think I'd feel

922
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:22,583
if钬?if one of them saw you in that state?

923
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:26,125
[scoffs] Oh! In what state?

924
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:27,875
[laughs]

925
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:29,750
[giggles] In this state?

926
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,625
Christ, I-- Stop.

927
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:40,416
You should be more careful. It's钬?
959
You know, now, after钬?after waiting eons,
I shall钬?I shall go and have my bath.

928
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:44,958
[door opens, closes]

929
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:47,458
[Peggy sighs]

930
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,875
[birds chirping]

931
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:08,333
-[Grimes] Mr. Spooner.
-[Spooner] Right.

932
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:18,541
-Morning, Mr. Piggott.
-[chuckles nervously] C.W.

933
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:22,583
[sighs]

934
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:26,083
-[whispers] You might have woken me.
-I didn't like to.

935
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,750
You made me appear late.

936
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:37,125
-[Pretty reading indistinctly]
-[crew chattering and laughing]

937
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:41,750
[Piggott whispering] Careful, Stuart.
You've got a delicate line now, man.

938
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:43,458
-Very delicate.
-You ready?

939
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:44,791
-Yeah.
-[Phillips] Just a moment.

940
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:47,791
You have to be very careful now.
No cavalier lifting.

941
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:49,666
[both laughing]

942
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,125
-[Phillips] Very gently.
-Yes, sir.

943
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:55,291
[Phillips] On my count. One, two, three.

944
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:57,958
[softly] And we do it this way.

945
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:12,750
[Peggy gasps]

946
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,083
[Rory] Don't move.

947
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:17,166
[camera clicks]

948
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:23,416
-[Peggy breathing shakily]
-[Brailesford] Piggott, look.

949
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:29,291
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

950
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:33,666
[Piggott] Where did you find it, darling?
You clever girl.

951
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:36,791
Phillips!

952
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:43,333
-Look at this, sir.
-Look. Look!

953
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,916
-[Phillips] Ah, good Lord.
-[Piggott] His face!

954
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,333
[crew laughing]

955
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:48,416
Phillips.

956
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:52,125
-Mrs. Pretty, there's more.
-[Brown] And here. And here too.

957
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,541
[Peggy] There's much more.

958
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:58,250
[energetic instrumental music playing]

959
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,041
[crew chatting indistinctly]

960
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:30,791
[excited chatter]

961
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:33,791
[Brown] Could you both, uh,
cast your eyes on this, please?

962
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:37,500
I, uh, found it down between the strikes.

963
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,791
I believe that's a Merovingian听tremissis.

964
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:43,583
-Late 6th century.
-[Phillips scoffs] Can't be.

965
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:48,791
Viking East Anglia didn't have
a coin-based economy till the 9th century.

966
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:52,291
[Brown] Well,
I think that the ship is older.

967
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,000
Mr. Brown has always said so.

968
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:06,708
This is Anglo-Saxon.

969
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,208
Piggott! Grimes!

970
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:12,791
It's Dark Age, by Jupiter!

971
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,250
Sixth century!

972
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:16,583
This changes everything.

973
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:20,875
These people
were not just marauding barterers.

974
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,375
They had culture!

975
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:24,125
They had art!

976
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:26,125
They had money!

977
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:27,833
[Grimes] Well, Vikings are out the window.

978
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:28,750
[Piggott gasps]

979
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,875
-C.W., look.
-[Peggy] God's sake.

980
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,208
Oh, good God.

981
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:34,000
[crew laughing]

982
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:38,791
[Phillips] Brown has just shown me
a Merovingian tremissis.

983
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,666
[Piggott exclaims]

984
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,333
-[crew laughs]
-That's Anglo-Saxon.

985
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:45,750
[Phillips] It's incredible!

986
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:52,541
[blows]

987
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,041
[camera clicks]

988
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,500
[birds singing]

989
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,958
[Peggy] Hello.

990
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:08,541
Are you camping out here?

991
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:12,125
[Robert]
No. That's where my cousin Rory sleeps.

992
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,583
[Peggy] Is he not allowed indoors?

993
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:18,458
[Robert] No, he钬?he thinks the house is too hot.

994
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:22,333
-[Peggy chuckles] I can imagine.
-[Robert] He's going to join the RAF.

995
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:25,500
-Is he?
-They're sending his papers any day.

996
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,250
He's going to get his wings.

997
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:28,833
Huh.

998
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:37,000
Well done, everybody,
on a splendid effort.

999
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,208
Brailesford, Piggott,

1000
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:42,083
if you'll start loading the gold
into the car,

1001
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:44,083
we'll get it
straight to the British Museum.

1002
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,791
[Pretty] I beg your pardon?

1003
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,500
[seagulls crying]

1004
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,625
Well, it's the obvious place for it,
Mrs. Pretty.

1005
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,291
[Pretty]
London is preparing for air raids.

1006
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:58,958
The British Museum is currently
being emptied of its treasures, isn't it?

1007
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:02,250
[Phillips] Uh, yes,
but, um, it钬?it'll go to the lab.

1008
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,583
[Pretty] This treasure came
from someone's grave.

1009
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:10,041
There'll be an inquest, as you know,
and its fate will be decided there.

1010
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:15,000
Until then, Mr. Brown钬?
1043
as the finder of this magnificent ship,

1011
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:17,166
would you please take the treasure
up to the house?

1012
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,083
Uh, yes, Mrs. Pretty.

1013
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,666
Thank you all very much.

1014
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:26,000
[Brown] Right, uh, gentlemen,
I'll need some assistance. Mr. Lomax?

1015
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,875
[Phillips] This is most irregular.

1016
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,625
[Grimes] It all belongs to Mrs. Pretty,
doesn't it?

1017
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:32,208
It's found on her land.

1018
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:34,375
[Piggott] Well, surely,
the inquest will decide

1019
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:37,166
whether the treasure
belongs to Mrs. Pretty or the Crown.

1020
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:40,333
[Phillips] Piggott, do you want
this treasure听to go to the Ipswich Museum?

1021
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,041
[Pretty] Am I doing the right thing?

1022
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,000
It's someone's grave.

1023
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
[Brown] No, that's钬?that's life what's revealed.

1024
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:53,791
And that's why we dig.

1025
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,208
[Pretty] Just in here.
I think that's best.

1026
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:25,500
They're like emissaries
from another world.

1027
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:36,083
[Rory] I used to camp
with Robert's father, you see.

1028
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:39,083
[Rory] I remember him telling me the calls
of all the birds.

1029
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,791
Now, whenever I hear nightingales,
I think of these woods.

1030
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:45,583
-[Peggy] Are there nightingales?
-Haven't you heard them?

1031
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:46,666
[Peggy] No.

1032
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:51,125
Never heard a nightingale at all.
Only on the wireless.

1033
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:54,500
There's a wonderful cellist
called Beatrice Harrison.

1034
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,708
In the summer evenings,
she used to practice in the garden, and钬?
1068
one night, she was playing a scale,
and a钬?a nightingale joined in.

1035
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:05,250
At first, she couldn't believe it.
She started playing a sonata,

1036
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:08,041
and the nightingale accompanied her.

1037
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:10,333
-[Rory] Really?
-[Peggy] Mm-hmm. Yes.

1038
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:13,333
[chuckles] Yes. It happened again
the next night and next night.

1039
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:14,916
Miss Harrison was so excited about it,

1040
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,791
she went to the BBC
and told them all about it.

1041
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:17,708
[Rory] And?

1042
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:20,000
[Peggy] So, a few evenings later,

1043
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:22,291
the BBC came
and put their recording equipment

1044
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:23,875
in Miss Harrison's garden.

1045
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:35,000
She started to play,
and they waited and, um, waited钬?
1080
and钬?
1081
and at last,
the nightingale began to sing.

1046
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:42,875
Went on for about 15 minutes钬?
1083
rising and falling with the cello.

1047
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:47,333
-No.
-[both laughing]

1048
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,791
-Yes.
-Wow.

1049
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,291
I know. Hmm.

1050
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:54,500
[sighs]

1051
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:05,000
But钬?the really extraordinary thing is that钬?
1089
other people who'd been listening
to the broadcast in their gardens

1052
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:09,625
reported that other nightingales
also started to sing.

1053
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:11,958
Well, that's wonderful.

1054
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:16,750
Yes, it was. It was wonderful.

1055
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:17,791
[Piggott] Margaret!

1056
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:22,375
-Come on!
-[Peggy sighs] All right. Hmm.

1057
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:29,416
Well钬?good night.

1058
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:34,291
I shall listen out
for cellos in the woods.

1059
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:36,166
[Peggy chuckles]

1060
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,000
[Rory scoffs]

1061
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:40,083
"Cellos." [mumbles]

1062
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:49,083
[crowd chattering]

1063
01:10:58,333 --> 01:11:01,500
-[Brailesford] Here we are, chaps.
-[Phillips] All right.

1064
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:03,666
[Brailesford] Well,
we are unburying a legend.

1065
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,166
-Beowulf.
-Arthur, King of the Britons.

1066
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,291
Cheers.

1067
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:11,291
Talk about Dark Ages.
I can hardly see my pint.

1068
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:12,750
What actually is that?

1069
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,083
[Piggott] It's the,
uh, trial blackouts, C.W.

1070
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:16,333
[Phillips] Ah.

1071
01:11:16,416 --> 01:11:19,875
So Germans will be coming by air
this time, will they?

1072
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,916
Last time, they came by the river.

1073
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,250
In AD 600.

1074
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,875
[group laughing]

1075
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:29,708
You know, I'm钬?It's been a big day. I'm quite done in.

1076
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,625
Um, will you all excuse me?

1077
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:34,833
-Aw.
-Well done, Mrs. P, on a marvelous find.

1078
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,791
[Brailesford] Yes.
Cheers to your clever wife!

1079
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,291
-Yeah. No, I'll come with you, darling.
-No.

1080
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:42,625
No, no. Um, surely you want to celebrate.

1081
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:47,583
-Stay for another, Piggott.
-My round. Set them up again, would you?

1082
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:52,291
I say, C.W., ask him
if he'll take a Merovingian tremissis.

1083
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,541
[group laughing]

1084
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:56,458
[radio announcer] 钬he press campaign,

1085
01:11:56,541 --> 01:12:00,416
the menacing statements of the statesmen
leading the policy of Germany,

1086
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,791
the systematic provocation
of frontier incidents,

1087
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:06,958
and finally,
the constantly increasing concentrations

1088
01:12:07,041 --> 01:12:08,541
of mobilized armed forces

1089
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:13,000
at the Polish frontiers
constitute an obvious proof of this.

1090
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,208
A Labour deputation called on
the Prime Minister last night,

1091
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:20,083
requesting the immediate evacuation
of women, children, and cripples

1092
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:22,041
as precaution
against the sudden outbreak of war.

1093
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:25,083
[man 1 in film] He'll find Buck Rogers
if anybody can.

1094
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:27,166
[ships whirring]

1095
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,875
[man 2 in film] Get the guards, you fools!

1096
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:33,500
If they get away, I'll put every man
of you in the robot battalion!

1097
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:36,208
[somber piano music playing]

1098
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,500
[whispering] Not yet.

1099
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:41,333
Not yet. [sniffles]

1100
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:51,125
Darling, C.W. wants me to take
some of the corroded iron to the lab.

1101
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:53,000
Uh, we think it might be fragmented armor,

1102
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:58,666
and I钬?I badly want
to start cleaning it up. So钬?
1141
Am I to come with you?

1103
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:05,500
No, because C.W. needs
all the hands he can get here, so, uh钬?
1143
And he's very pleased with you.

1104
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,041
-Is he?
-[Piggott] Mm.

1105
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:11,958
Uh, so I'm taking Brailesford
because the lab's really his thing.

1106
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:15,375
-You know.
-Ah. Oh.

1107
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,333
You're going to have
to be a brick about it, Margaret.

1108
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:19,291
[Peggy] Peggy.

1109
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:22,250
My name's Peggy.

1110
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
[warplanes roaring]

1111
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:31,500
[Peggy sighs]

1112
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:33,708
[mutters]

1113
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:42,666
I'll钬?I'll钬?I'll miss you very much, Peggy.

1114
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:49,333
Sorry to take him away from you.

1115
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:52,666
-[engine starts]
-[Peggy sighs]

1116
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,500
[Peggy] It was very kind of you
to invite me, Mrs. Pretty.

1117
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:01,375
[Pretty] You can't possibly stay
in that pub without your husband.

1118
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:03,791
Mr. Phillips
would bore you quite to death.

1119
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:08,208
Um, have you developed any
of your photographs yet, Mr. Lomax?

1120
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:12,041
I've made a start. I've got a mountain
to do, and I better get through them.

1121
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:13,916
I could get my papers any day.

1122
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:16,791
Rory has been accepted into the RAF.

1123
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,541
Should I congratulate you?

1124
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:22,625
I don't know. Cousin Edith didn't.

1125
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:27,416
This looks delicious.

1126
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:31,125
[Pretty] Bon app茅tit.

1127
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:35,083
[Pretty] Don't be too long, now, darling.
It's late.

1128
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:37,875
[Brown] And now,
that's a partial eclipse of the moon.

1129
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,833
[Pretty] And don't run.

1130
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:40,833
[Pretty] Oh, dear.

1131
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:42,083
[Pretty] Wait for us.

1132
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:46,333
-[Pretty] Isn't that a bad omen?
-[Brown] Well, they used to think so.

1133
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:52,208
[Pretty] It does make you feel
the gods are angry.

1134
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,291
The people who buried that ship钬?
1175
What did they believe?

1135
01:14:57,916 --> 01:15:01,625
[Brown] Well钬?they were sailing somewhere,
weren't they?

1136
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:06,083
Down to the underworld or up to the stars.

1137
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:10,541
[Pretty] Wherever we go when we die.

1138
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:17,083
[Phillips] So we're rather coming
to the dregs, aren't we?

1139
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:20,000
The coroner has been in touch.

1140
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,416
An inquest has been called for Friday,
and your presence is required.

1141
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:29,458
There's been quite
a lot of public interest in our ship.

1142
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:32,541
So afterwards,
I've invited everyone to come and see it.

1143
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:34,208
Uh钬?everyone?

1144
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:38,125
[Pretty] The villagers are coming
and my friends from the county.

1145
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:44,083
May I remind you
just how fragile this site is?

1146
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,541
Please feel free
to invite your families and friends.

1147
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:54,291
Mrs. Pretty钬?
1189
[warplane sputtering]

1148
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:57,916
Good God.

1149
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:00,833
[Pretty] Robert?

1150
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,541
[warplane engine stops]

1151
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:13,083
[loud crashing]

1152
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:14,458
[water splashes]

1153
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:18,041
Don't let anyone swim!
It's tidal. The current is fierce!

1154
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:19,000
Darling.

1155
01:16:19,083 --> 01:16:20,583
[dramatic music playing]

1156
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,458
[inhales deeply]

1157
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:29,666
[Rory panting and grunting]

1158
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:42,416
They train these boys
on rickety planes from the Great War.

1159
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:46,000
My husband said,
"If you want your son to die,

1160
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:48,000
then let him join the Air Force."

1161
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,875
[Peggy] They say
this war will be fought in the air.

1162
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,166
[Robert] What happened, Mother?

1163
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:58,375
Is he all right?

1164
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:02,083
-I must get Robert up to the house.
-Shall I take him for you?

1165
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:05,791
-He won't want to go.
-Uh, I'll ask him to look after me.

1166
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:08,583
[Pretty] Thank you.

1167
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:09,916
[Peggy] Robert!

1168
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,416
-[Robert] Yes?
-[Peggy sighs] I钬?I feel rather faint.

1169
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:17,541
Oh, well, when I feel faint,
I have a good lie-down

1170
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:18,958
and a big glass of water.

1171
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:21,041
-[Peggy] Do you?
-[Robert] And that does the trick.

1172
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,166
[Peggy] That's what I need.

1173
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:24,083
-Will you take my hand?
-[Robert] Sure.

1174
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:29,000
[seagulls screeching]

1175
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,458
[Pretty exhales deeply]

1176
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:08,916
[Peggy] His name was David Atkinson.
It was his second solo flight.

1177
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:15,708
Police and the coroner are here.
I brought you some dry things.

1178
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:22,875
[Rory] I've got some coffee
back at my tent.

1179
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:27,750
Would you like some?

1180
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:36,000
[Peggy] My father drowned钬?
1223
on a holiday in Cornwall.

1181
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,541
He was taken by the current.

1182
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,708
-[Rory] I'm sorry.
-[Peggy] Oh, no.

1183
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,333
It was a long time ago.

1184
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:45,958
He had epilepsy.

1185
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:51,750
So, what drew you to photography?

1186
01:19:58,291 --> 01:19:59,208
[Rory] Oh, I suppose it's, um钬?
1230
It's just a way
of trying to fix things as they钬?
1231
as they go past.

1187
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:02,833
-[Peggy] Mm.
-[Rory] Keep what's vital from being lost.

1188
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:12,166
My father once gave me an old coin钬?
1234
and he said it was
from the time of Caesar Augustus.

1189
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:18,583
And I knew the story from the Bible
where Jesus showed the disciples a coin.

1190
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:21,541
"Render unto Caesar
the things that are Caesar's."

1191
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,625
-[chuckles lightly]
-Yes.

1192
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:27,583
And I钬?[sighs]

1193
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:31,083
钬ell, I钬?I became convinced
that the coin I had

1194
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:34,125
was the one that Jesus
had actually shown the disciples.

1195
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:38,750
I used to marvel that I could hold it.

1196
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:44,750
What happened to your coin?

1197
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,041
Oh钬?
1244
Uh钬?
1245
-I wear it. [chuckles]
-[Rory gasps]

1198
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:03,750
I thought it might bring me luck.

1199
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:07,583
And has it?

1200
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:27,333
If 1,000 years钬?
1249
were to pass in an instant钬?
1250
what would be left of us?

1201
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:30,291
[Peggy] This.

1202
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:35,833
And parts of your watch.

1203
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:37,916
Torch.

1204
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:41,125
Fragments of the mug.

1205
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:47,583
[Rory] But every last scrap
of you and I would钬?disappear.

1206
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,666
-[Rory] Listen.
-[nightingales singing]

1207
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:51,583
[Peggy] What?

1208
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:59,416
[both gasp, laugh]

1209
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,625
[Pretty sighs]

1210
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:09,500
[Robert] The pilot died, didn't he?

1211
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,666
Yes, darling.

1212
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:17,833
Wait.

1213
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:22,666
-[sighs, breathing shakily]
-[Robert] Rory won't die, will he?

1214
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:24,166
I'm sorry.

1215
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:25,916
No.

1216
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:36,791
You won't die?

1217
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:51,250
[breathing shakily]

1218
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:03,875
[Pretty gasping]

1219
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:06,833
[Peggy] Mrs. Pretty?

1220
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:09,541
[Pretty continues gasping]

1221
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:16,791
-[Peggy] Are you unwell?
-I've, um钬?
1272
-Perhaps you might lead me to my room.
-Yes, of course. Of course.

1222
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:21,208
-[groaning]
-[Peggy] Are you all right?

1223
01:23:21,291 --> 01:23:23,083
[Pretty laughing weakly] Yes! Yes.

1224
01:23:27,291 --> 01:23:29,875
-[Peggy] Should I call a doctor?
-[Pretty] No, no, no. It's钬?
1276
It's heartburn. It's钬?
1277
[muffled] No, I don't want to wake him.

1225
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:31,708
[Robert gasps]

1226
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:35,750
-[Pretty gasping]
-[Peggy] Mrs. Pretty, are you all right?

1227
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:38,541
[Pretty] I'm such a bore.

1228
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:42,791
Would you mind钬?Would you mind getting me some milk?

1229
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:44,041
-[Peggy] Yes.
-Thank you.

1230
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:46,416
-[Peggy] Are you sure?
-[sobbing] Yes, thank you.

1231
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:53,833
-[Peggy] Oh.
-Robert! Darling钬?
1285
[moans]

1232
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:58,875
[Robert panting]

1233
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:00,833
-[grunts]
-[Brown] Oh! Robert.

1234
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:03,333
-[Robert groans]
-[Brown] You all right?

1235
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:04,333
[Robert shouts]

1236
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,083
[Brown] Robert?

1237
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:11,250
I know she's sick. I know it!
There's nothing I can do!

1238
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:14,458
Why is there nothing I can do?
I should be able to make her better.

1239
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:16,833
You do. You do make her better.

1240
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:20,125
[Robert]
No, she's worse. She is, I can see it!

1241
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:22,875
[sobbing]

1242
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:24,958
She is.

1243
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,500
When钬?When my father died钬?
1298
[sobs heavily]

1244
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,666
[Brown] Mm.

1245
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:36,500
钬veryone said
I had to look after my mother.

1246
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:39,875
[sniffles] And I failed.

1247
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:41,291
I failed.

1248
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,708
Robert钬?
1304
[gentle instrumental music playing]

1249
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:51,958
钬e all fail.

1250
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:55,458
Every day.

1251
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:03,833
There are some things
we just can't succeed at钬?
1308
no matter how hard we try.

1252
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,750
I know it's not what you want to hear.

1253
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:15,000
I钬?I'm stronger than she thinks I am.

1254
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:19,583
[Brown] I know. Perhaps you'll show her.

1255
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:27,708
Now钬?
1313
we should get you inside, Robert.

1256
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:29,708
Come on.

1257
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:33,083
I think it's time for your bed, you know.
Come on, then.

1258
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:36,333
[Pretty breathing steadily]

1259
01:25:36,416 --> 01:25:39,958
[Brown and Robert听speaking indistinctly]

1260

[Phillips laughing]

1261
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:47,708
[Phillips] Apparently,
there's a whole convoy

1262
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:49,333
of hacks on the way.

1263
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:54,541
I already have some joker
from the Sunday Mirror asking me

1264
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:57,083
if the ship is still seaworthy.

1265
01:25:57,166 --> 01:26:01,416
So, what happens to the treasure?
That's the real question.

1266
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:04,666
[radio announcer]
Germany has invaded Poland钬?
1325
[Piggott] Have you seen my wife?

1267
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:06,166
钬nd has bombed many towns.

1268
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:10,625
Orders completing the mobilization
of the Navy, Army, and Air Force

1269
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:14,458
were signed by the King at a meeting
this afternoon of the privy council.

1270
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:16,833
[radio announcer 2]
The King and Queen decided...

1271
01:26:16,916 --> 01:26:18,125
[Phillips sighs] Well.

1272
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,875
Here we go, then.

1273
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:24,958
The Queen drove from the palace to visit
the Westminister ARP headquarters.

1274
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:29,541
[somber instrumental music playing]

1275
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:56,250
[Rory] I've just received this.

1276
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:03,041
I'm to report
to RAF Martlesham this morning.

1277
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,166
There's the inquest.

1278
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:09,625
[scoffs] It's my medical assessment.
I can't钬?I can't bunk it. Sorry.

1279
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:13,166
I put some photographs
in the dining room for your guests.

1280
01:27:14,333 --> 01:27:16,333
Rory, I'm telling you
in no uncertain terms

1281
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:17,833
that you cannot possibly die.

1282
01:27:17,916 --> 01:27:18,916
[scoffs]

1283
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,625
[Pretty] I'm saying this most seriously.
Don't you dare put yourself in danger.

1284
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:29,000
Well钬?I'm not sure
I shall have much choice. [chuckles]

1285
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:32,083
Robert is going to need you.

1286
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:35,666
Do you understand?

1287
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:37,875
[Brown] Good morning, Robert.

1288
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:41,458
-Today's the day.
-I want to take my mother sailing.

1289
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:43,333
I don't think
that ship is sailing anywhere.

1290
01:27:43,416 --> 01:27:45,708
You know, it's just compacted sand.

1291
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:49,291
There's nothing holding it, except time.

1292
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:52,916
-That won't matter. Not where we're going.
-Now, where's that, then?

1293
01:27:53,416 --> 01:27:57,375
-Will you come?
-[Brown] Well, if I'm invited, I'll come.

1294
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:00,833
-Morning.
-[Rory] Hello.

1295
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:04,916
Those for me?

1296
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,875
[laughs] No, I'm looking for my wife.

1297
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,958
Well, perhaps you'd say goodbye for me.

1298
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:13,375
I've been called up.

1299
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:14,458
Oh.

1300
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,250
Of course.

1301
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,500
Well, best of British.

1302
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,458
Stuart.

1303
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:23,708
[Piggott] I钬?I bought you these.

1304
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:26,916
How lovely.

1305
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:35,583
Um, Lomax was just telling me
that he's been called up.

1306
01:28:39,041 --> 01:28:40,000
Oh.

1307
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:49,250
-Uh, well, it钬?-[Rory] Um钬?
1367
[Peggy] Well, I钬?
1368
Uh, I'd better go. Goodbye.

1308
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:15,458
Uh钬?
1370
[radio announcer]
According to an official telegram,

1309
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:19,125
Warsaw has been bombed six times today.

1310
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,291
The telegram adds that fighting
of a most serious nature continues

1311
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:24,875
on the whole length of the front.

1312
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:27,125
We're in for another bloody mess.

1313
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,291
[reporter 1] Oh, here we go.
Did you hear the results?

[people and reporters clamoring]

1315

[Brown] Make way, please.

1319
01:29:45,791 --> 01:29:48,208
-Do you want me in the car with you?
-[Pretty] Yes.

1320
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:49,750
[Brown] Maynard! Maynard!

1321
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,958
Maynard? Can you make sure
my wife gets in the house?

1322
01:29:54,041 --> 01:29:56,041
[crowd continues clamoring]

1323
01:29:57,666 --> 01:30:02,125
[Phillips] I钬?I hope I have
the opportunity to speak to you later.

1324
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:06,000
-[woman 2] Mrs. Pretty?
-[woman 3] Mrs. Pretty!

[Pretty breathing shakily]

1329
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:31,083
[sobbing] I'm terribly sorry.

1330
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:41,291
Thank you.听Thank you.

1331
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:47,333
[Phillips] These people
were not savage warriors.

1332
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:54,708
These钬?These钬?These were钬?
1395
These were sophisticated people
with incredible artistry.

1333
01:30:56,708 --> 01:31:00,375
The Dark Ages are no longer dark.

This is sherry.
I suppose it's sherry, is it?

1338
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:13,875
[May] I don't know.

1339
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:17,291
Should we drink it now,
or is there going to be a toast?

1340
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:18,958
What's everyone else doing?

[fanfare ends]

1343
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:29,333
[Pretty] The artifacts discovered here
have caused a national sensation.

1344
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:31,708
[Pretty] You must all know by now

1345
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,291
that they were recovered
from a chamber in the middle of a ship钬?
1409
a burial ship, engineered from oak.

1346
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:44,333
In my opinion, the greatest
and most beautiful treasure of all.

1347
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:49,125
Ninety feet long, lying east to west.

1348
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:53,625
Found and excavated by Mr. Basil Brown.

I'm terribly sorry.

1356
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:23,583
I thought you'd be pleased
with the verdict.

1357
01:32:30,791 --> 01:32:32,166
[Pretty] We die.

1358
01:32:34,625 --> 01:32:36,541
We die and we decay.

1359
01:32:38,375 --> 01:32:39,791
We don't live on.

1360
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,833
I'm not sure I agree.

From the first human handprint
on a cave wall钬?
1426
we're part of something continuous.

1362

-[Pretty] Rory put these out this morning.

1366
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:37,333
It completely slipped my mind.

1367
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:43,750
[Peggy sobbing]

1368
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,500

[Peggy continues sobbing]

1370
01:34:05,458 --> 01:34:06,916
[Pretty] I'm sure
work like yours is very sustaining钬?
1436
but it's not enough.

1371
01:34:10,416 --> 01:34:11,875
Life is very fleeting.

1372
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:14,666
I've learnt that.

1373
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:18,166
It has moments you should seize.

1374
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:28,208
It could not be a better result,
Mrs. Pretty.

1375
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:30,541
The whole of Suffolk
has been on your side.

1376
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:32,666
-[Pretty] Yes.
-I saw you in her car.

1377
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:36,666
Did she mention her intentions?

1378
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:39,833
-About the tea?
-[scoffs] About the treasure, man.

1379
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:42,166
-Oh.
-Yes, what's she planning?

1380
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:44,416
We hope that you'll agree
that the Ipswich Museum

1381
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,541
is the perfect place for--

1382
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:49,041
-Can we talk another time? Excuse me.
-Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Yes.

1383
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:51,000
[Phillips] She trusts you, man.

1384
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:52,791
Don't let her give it to Ipswich.

1385
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:55,541
The British Museum would buy everything.

1386
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:59,625
It's priceless, of course,
but she'll have to be reasonable.

1387
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:01,916
Are you asking me to plead your case?

1388

[Phillips sighs forcefully]

1389
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:06,166
Have some lemon drizzle cake,
Mr. Phillips.

1390
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:07,750
It is most refreshing.

I could have cheered.

My son has formed a strong attachment.

1396
01:35:19,625 --> 01:35:21,541
[May] Basil's very fond of him, too.

1397
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:26,291
Perhaps you might let him visit you
from time to time.

1398
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,333
Of course.

1399
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:30,541
We'd be glad to.

that you should go on钬?[clears throat]

1473
will you follow us?

I don't think so.

01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:11,750
No.

1410
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:17,000
We both have our own paths
to, um, follow, don't we?

1411
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:19,708
And I've seen you when you're happy.

1412
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:21,916
You're rather beautiful.

1413

-I'm happy with you.
-[sighs lightly]

-I could钬?I could learn to be.
-[Peggy sighs]

1415
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,250
I think that would be an awful shame.

1416
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,833
[Brailesford] Stuart! Shall we wait?

1417

[Phillips] Let's钬?Let's go. Come on.

1418

Go on.

that's another week's work.

[May]
You say your goodbyes to the old girl.

1425
01:37:44,416 --> 01:37:45,958
Do you take care of her.

You钬?You don't want to stay the night?

1430
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:23,000
[Brown] I'll line the hull with hessian钬?
1501
and cover that
with a钬?a layer of branches钬?
1502
to protect it
from the weight of the earth.

1431
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:25,083
All this soil's got to go back in.

1432
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:28,250
Leave it as we found it.

1433
01:38:30,708 --> 01:38:33,208
I'm giving the treasure
to the British Museum.

1434
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:36,375
As a gift.

1435
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:42,625
It should be where the greatest number
of people can freely see it.

1436

I haven't told them yet.

1437

I wanted to tell you.

01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:57,625

anyone's ever made a gift as big as that.

1440
01:38:58,333 --> 01:38:59,875
Apparently, they haven't.

1441
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,750
I also told Mr. Phillips that I expect
your work to receive proper recognition.

1442
01:39:13,708 --> 01:39:14,666

Can you see it, Mother?

1454

We're sailing into the cosmos.

1455
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:39,250
Yes, I can. Where are we heading?

1456
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:42,500
Orion's Belt, to take the Queen home.

[Pretty] Which Queen?

1458
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:49,041
This boat's hers. Her people gave
her treasure for her home voyage.

1459
01:40:57,375 --> 01:41:01,291
[Robert] And she was sad
when the ship came钬?
1532
because she knew
she'd be leaving everyone behind.

1460
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,625
And she was worried

1461
01:41:09,833 --> 01:41:13,041
that they wouldn't get on
very well without her钬?
1535
but she knew
she had to follow the King into the sky.

1462
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:19,750
And so, she set off钬?
1537
through the Earth and up into the cosmos.

-[Pretty chuckles]

1464

Time operates quite differently up there,
and 500 years can pass in a flash.

1465
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:33,458
And the Queen looked back down to Earth.

1466
01:41:34,166 --> 01:41:38,791
She could see that her son had grown up
and that he was now a space pilot.

the German government a final note钬?

stating that,
unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock,

1475
01:42:17,625 --> 01:42:22,708
that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

01:42:22,791 --> 01:42:26,166
a state of war would exist between us.

that no such undertaking
has been received,
