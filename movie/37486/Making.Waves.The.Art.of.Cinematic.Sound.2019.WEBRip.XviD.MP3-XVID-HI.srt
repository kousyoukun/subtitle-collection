2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,560
(Faint music)

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,040
(Walter Murch) Before we were born,
you're looking at darkness.

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,640
Sound is the first sense
that gets plugged in.

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,920
Six months, seven months
into the womb.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,800
It's hearing the mother's heartbeat.

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,800
It's hearing her breathing.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,200
It's hearing Dad
shouting from the garage...

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,480
(Indistinct)

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,960
(Dog barking)

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,000
It's making sense of the world.

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,520
(Indistinct chatter)

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,520
You have emerged
into a kind of consciousness

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,800
using only sound.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,560
And then you're born.

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,320
(Birds chirping)

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,000
Sound affects us in a deeper way
almost than image does.

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,480
It goes deeper.

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,280
(Faint clicking)

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,920
(Crowd cheering)

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,360
(Galloping horses' hooves)

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,840
Oh.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,840
(Gunshots)

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,720
And yet, we're naturally,
seemingly oblivious to that.

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,280
(Ben Burtt) Film sound
is an illusionary art,

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,000
as if you're just hearing
the natural sounds...

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,760
(Spacecraft engines roar)

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,960
...happening in the world on screen.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,440
(Dinosaur roaring)

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,640
(Gary Rydstrom) It's subliminal

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,680
and a purely emotional way
of thinking about a movie.

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,320
(Dinosaur roaring)

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,640
(Panting)

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
(Glass breaks)

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,800
(Pat Jackson)
It's stealthy, sound work.

36
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,840
It's flying under the radar.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,560
It's understated.

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,960
(Various sound effects)

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,320
But what sound adds
to the picture

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,840
is so exhilarating
that I just was hooked,

41
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,760
and pretty much never looked back.

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,680
You're depressed, it's not working,
then the sound design comes in...

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,400
The feeling of scale
that the sound was giving...

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,800
And I think that sound, in many ways
is more tied to imagination.

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,320
(Spears clanging)

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,680
(Grunting)

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,840
If you're born to be artistic,
sound is going to be part of the deal.

48
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,320
It's part of being human.

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,600
Movie is sight and sound.

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,800
You only express it
with sight and sound.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,040
(Tiger roaring)

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,840
People always talk about
the look of a film.

53
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,000
They don't talk so much about
the sound of a film.

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,840
But it's equally important,
sometimes more important.

55
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,440
I am not an animal.

56
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,240
The point is to convey an emotion.

57
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,880
(Men shouting)

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,000
Everything is in service of that.

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,440
(Shooting)

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,280
And sound is half of the experience.

61
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,400
(Uplifting music)

62
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,760
I've always been of the belief that

63
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,520
our ears lead our eyes
to where the story lives.

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
(Rapid gunfire)

65
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,280
(Bomb explodes)

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,440
(Gary Rydstrom)
When designing sound on a film today,

67
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,640
like "Saving Private Ryan",

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,480
you're bringing together a rich
complex orchestration of sounds.

69
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,200
On every film I've worked on
with Steven Spielberg,

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,480
he gives a gift of
here's a scene, here's a moment,

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
and I'm counting on sound
to help tell the story. Here you go.

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,000
(Gunshots)

73
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,240
What strikes me most about,

74
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,520
especially the opening
of "Private Ryan",

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
is that it was designed to use sound

76
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,080
to tell a part of the story
it's not showing you.

77
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,040
(Gunshots)

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,680
So a scene like that
fully takes advantage

79
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,400
of how a soldier takes in war,
which is a pretty narrow point of view.

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,920
- (Gunshots)
- (Bomb explodes)

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,080
Move. Move.

82
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,000
Sound got to handle the scale of it.

83
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,440
We spent a lot of time
on that first 25 minutes.

84
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,720
It was weeks and weeks
of just balancing all the sound effects

85
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,480
that Gary and his crew provided.

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,160
(Gunshots)

87
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,160
I kind of came up with
a certain pattern or rhythm

88
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,360
of cutting these machine guns
for the background battle.

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,680
(Gunshots)

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,560
So that there was
some form to this battle.

91
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,520
(Gunshots)

92
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,480
There's always a rhythm.
Even to chaos, there's a rhythm.

93
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,440
- (Gunshots)
- (Bomb explodes)

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,240
Point of view is great for sound

95
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,480
because it allows you
to go inside the head.

96
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,240
(Steven Spielberg)
So I designed a sequence,

97
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,760
where when an explosion
hits near Captain Miller,

98
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,880
all the sound goes out.

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
That came from an actual veteran

100
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,320
that told me
that was how it affected him.

101
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,120
So it put you
deep inside his experience.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,640
(Explosion)

103
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,200
(Gary Rydstrom) If you look at it,
it never has, until the battle is over,

104
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,920
a wide shot, that gives you a grand
scale "Longest Day" style of D-Day.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,520
It doesn't do it.
It's all very intimate.

106
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,040
(Heavy breathing)

107
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,320
And very importantly,
there's no score.

108
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
John Williams would've done a beautiful
score with a whole different feeling,

109
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,000
but without score
it tells you this is real.

110
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,400
(Gentle dramatic music)

111
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,000
When the score comes in,
the score is often used...

112
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,240
I think of it as like a life raft.

113
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,160
You have an emotional moment
and the score comes in.

114
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,360
It just gives you
something to hold onto.

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,640
(Dramatic music)

116
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,480
(Gary Rydstrom) These different
elements of sound in movies -

117
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,880
music, sound effects and voice,

118
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,560
are similar to the instrument groupings
of an orchestra.

119
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,160
But film sound work
wasn't always like that.

120
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
(Gunshots)

121
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,360
You know, with dozens of sound editors
editing thousands of tracks.

122
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,520
(Lightsabre swishing)

123
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,640
It ultimately took people
like Ben Burtt on "Star Wars"

124
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,040
and Walter Murch
on "Apocalypse Now",

125
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,240
to get us
to the full immersive soundtrack

126
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,120
that the audience has come
to expect in movies today...

127
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,040
...created by a team of sound artists,
a circle of talent.

128
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,280
(Distant) No!

129
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,760
But when it all started,
movies were silent.

130
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,000
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow

131
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,080
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go

132
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,520
(Gary Rydstrom)
The invention of the phonograph

133
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,440
was a monumental step
for humanity.

134
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,960
We could now capture sound forever.

135
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,640
(Ben Burtt) Edison originally developed
the motion picture camera

136
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,480
because he wanted images
to go along with his phonograph.

137
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,640
(Muffled speech)

138
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,440
So the audio came first.

139
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,440
But picture works
at one speed.

140
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,240
Sound is at another.

141
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,680
(Music)

142
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
They had no way to put it in sync,

143
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,480
which is why
the whole project was abandoned.

144
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,360
They were just so eager
to put sound to movies

145
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,880
because everybody knew
this would elevate the experience.

146
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,600
(Orchestral music)

147
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,920
Films were projected
with a full live orchestra.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,320
They could be projected
with people talking behind the screen.

149
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,440
(Bell rings)

150
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,920
There were actually people
that travelled around

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
doing sound effects
live to silent films.

152
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
There's films like "Wings"
when it played in New York,

153
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,160
and its big premieres,
it had performers on stage

154
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,840
doing live sound effects
for airplane engines,

155
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,680
and using percussion instruments
for the boom of artillery and explosions.

156
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,080
They could do wind,
galloping horse hooves...

157
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,440
- (Galloping horses' hooves)
- (Gunshots)

158
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,680
There just wasn't technically a way
of capturing and recording the sounds,

159
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,240
and attaching them
to the movies yet.

160
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
Until 1926.

161
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,920
Warner Bros. did "Don Juan"
with John Barrymore.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
(Music)

163
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,640
It actually had
a synchronised music track,

164
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
which was mechanically connected
to a projector.

165
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,200
Then in 1927, they actually
recorded dialogue on the set,

166
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,520
and so "The Jazz Singer"
had spoken portions of it.

167
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,600
♪ Toot, toot, Tootsie, goodbye

168
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,320
♪ Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry

169
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,040
(Newscaster) Warner Bros. Theater
in New York City,

170
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,000
where "The Jazz Singer"
is now playing,

171
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,520
is sold out
for many weeks in advance.

172
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,280
What struck people most
was Al Jolson's speaking voice,

173
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,600
not his singing voice.

174
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,160
(Gary Rydstrom) That he spoke
was revolutionary to audiences.

175
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,720
That's what they wanted to hear.

176
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,760
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

177
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
You ain't heard nothing yet.

178
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,800
Wait, I tell you.

179
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,880
You ain't heard nothing.

180
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,600
- (Applause)
- (Orchestral music)

181
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,920
(Ben Burtt)
It was a gigantic sensation,

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
so Hollywood
was faced with what to do now.

183
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,040
They had developed a way
of shooting movies without sound,

184
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,240
and that involved
certain freedom on a set

185
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,760
to be in a noisy place
because it didn't matter.

186
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,360
Suddenly, there was this revolution
when they had to start

187
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,720
entombing the productions
in sound stages,

188
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,960
so all sound was blocked out
from the outside world.

189
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
All right. Here we go. Quiet.

190
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

191
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,360
Roll 'em.

192
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,320
(Gary Rydstrom) But the microphone's
ranges were so short,

193
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,280
the actors couldn't even move.

194
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,400
(Inaudible)

195
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,840
She's got to talk into the mic.
I can't pick it up.

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,400
Don't you remember,
I told you,

197
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,560
there's a microphone right there,
in the bush.

198
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,880
(Gary Rydstrom)
It was very limiting.

199
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,520
(Speech drops in and out)

200
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,800
Cut.

201
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,440
(Gary Rydstrom) But despite
the limitations, audiences loved sound.

202
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,360
And I think it's because even
in the sound of a human voice,

203
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,840
we carry emotion.

204
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,400
Antonio?

205
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,240
Nein, nein, nein!

206
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,280
It's alive!

207
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,760
(Thunder)

208
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
(Gary Rydstrom) But the addition
of the voice was not the only thing

209
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,200
that changed in movies at that time.

210
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,680
Filmmakers began to realise

211
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,400
that sound effects were also
an important part of cinema.

212
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,680
(Bomb explodes)

213
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,120
(Ben Burtt) They discovered that you
don't get all the sound effects you want

214
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,520
by just hanging a microphone
out over the set.

215
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,160
The sounds aren't there.

216
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,280
So this is where slowly
the idea of the sound editor evolved -

217
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,800
to add sounds after the fact.

218
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,520
(Greg Hedgepath)
There's fire, explosions,

219
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
barnyard animals.

220
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,120
Cars and...

221
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Motorcycles.

222
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,360
Different from buses,
different from trains.

223
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,240
With a bit of wind in the background
and this rain...

224
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,880
(Wind howling)

225
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,520
(Walter Murch) As sound editors,
we create a sound world

226
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,600
independent of what got recorded
at the time of shooting.

227
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,040
(Clattering)

228
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,160
(Door creaks)

229
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
(Bats screeching)

230
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,320
(Ben Burtt) But it isn't probably till
you get to "King Kong",

231
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,520
that you could actually call
it sound design.

232
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,440
(King Kong and T-Rex roaring)

233
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,840
(Ben Burtt) Many techniques
we use to manipulate sound today

234
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,480
were pioneered on that film.

235
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,080
The bulk of it is all about
characters that don't exist

236
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,160
so Murray Spivack had to get creative
to find the right sound.

237
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,200
I went to the Selig Zoo at the time.

238
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,640
I got all the roars I needed.

239
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,240
I then slowed those down
to half speed,

240
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,920
and I played the tiger growl backwards
against the lion roar forward.

241
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,360
And it gave me
a sort of an uncanny roar.

242
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,960
(King Kong and T-Rex roaring)

243
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,040
(Ben Burtt) These sound design tricks
are still used today.

244
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,840
And that was a big step forward.

245
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,800
But Murray Spivack operated
outside the system.

246
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,520
He was locked away
in the music department,

247
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
and no one knew
what he was doing.

248
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,680
I think they felt the studio would say,
"Don't bother with all that,"

249
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,960
if they knew the kind of effort
he was putting into it...

250
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,680
(King Kong and T-Rex roaring)

251
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,520
...because the studios
had their own collections

252
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,040
and their own stock sound effects.
They would repeat them.

253
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,080
They wouldn't change them
over the years.

254
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,560
Each studio had its own ricochet...

255
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,280
...and face punch and explosion.

256
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,560
If they worked successfully, they'd be
kept and used over and over again.

257
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,600
(Gunshots)

258
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,280
Ow.

259
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,560
They were just expected to get
something in there and on budget.

260
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,960
(Gary Rydstrom) But some of
the biggest innovations in film sound

261
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,840
actually had their roots in radio.

262
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,760
Who knows what evil lurks
in the hearts of men.

263
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,840
"The Shadow"or"The Whistler"-

264
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,160
any of those shows
were fun to listen to.

265
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,120
The sound brought it to life.

266
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,560
(Gunshot)

267
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,920
Doors opening and closing,
and footsteps.

268
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,240
- (Chuckles)
- (Door opens)

269
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,000
(Man) Come in.
We'll go in the kitchen.

270
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,000
(Woman) It's not Marlo playing
chef again. What is it this time?

271
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
(Door closes)

272
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,440
(Pat Jackson) I remember lying on
the floor in front of the radio console.

273
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,640
I thought, "When I grow up,
I'm gonna make footsteps like that."

274
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,400
Your imagination could dramatise
what you were hearing.

275
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,520
I just thought it was really great.
It was great for your imagination,

276
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,000
great for your creative spirit,
and so forth.

277
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,560
(Walter Murch) An innovator here
was Orson Welles.

278
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,360
He was very adventuresome
in sound perspective.

279
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
(Bell rings)

280
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,720
Now the smoke's crossing
6th Avenue,

281
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,960
5th Avenue...

282
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,760
A hundred yards away...

283
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,840
(Quiet music)

284
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,320
(Walter Murch)
So when he did "Citizen Kane",

285
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,120
he brought those techniques
in sound from radio to film.

286
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,920
Rosebud.

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,120
(Door opens)

288
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,640
By being as aggressive
spatially with sound

289
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,440
as he was with his depth of focus
on camera.

290
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,360
Charlie, what time is it?

291
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,920
11:30.

292
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,520
In New York?

293
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,200
Hm?

294
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,640
(Walter Murch) This idea that
every space has its own signature.

295
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,280
The sound energises the environment.

296
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,000
Now in complete control
of the government of this state.

297
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,640
And you can use even
very refined elements of reverberation

298
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,440
to help you tell your story.

299
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,800
(Gary Rydstrom) But this was
a new innovation for sound in film.

300
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,400
The norm from the 1930s to the 1960s

301
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
was to emphasise music
over sound effects.

302
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,800
Why don't you say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.

303
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,440
You'd rather live
with that silly little fool

304
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,400
who can't open her mouth
except say, "Yes", "No"

305
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,840
and raise a passel
of mealy-mouthed brats just like her!

306
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
You mustn't say things like that
about Melanie.

307
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?!

308
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,520
(Walter Murch) But if you run music
all the time in the film,

309
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,120
it has a cumulatively
counterproductive effect.

310
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,960
Constantly injecting steroids.

311
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,000
(Dramatic orchestral music)

312
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,880
But if you want unrelieved tension,

313
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
don't use any music at all.

314
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,080
(Elisabeth Weis)
Hitchcock got the power of sound.

315
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,480
He actually essentially
dictated a sound script.

316
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,680
And he really incorporated
the use of the sound

317
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,200
into the concept of the film.

318
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,760
(Quiet gasp)

319
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,040
- (Birds wings fluttering)
- (Shrieks)

320
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,000
(Groans)

321
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,960
(Karen Baker Landers) Hearing their
breaths and feeling the impacts

322
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,360
and the hits, they kept you very
connected right with the characters.

323
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,160
That was a scene
where it worked really well,

324
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,960
just having effects on their own.

325
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,920
(Horses' hooves clattering)

326
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
(George Lucas)
David Lean focused on sound.

327
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,080
Stanley Kubrick focused on sound.

328
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,080
(Eerie music)

329
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,800
But the studios weren't
encouraging of that kind of thing.

330
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,520
(Gary Rydstrom) The Hollywood studio
system often had a built-in approach

331
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,040
to film sound
that was controlled and traditional...

332
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,920
- (Galloping horses' hooves)
- (Cheers and applause)

333
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,680
...parallel to filmmakers
making the same kind of movies

334
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,160
over and over again.

335
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,840
♪ Pillow talk

336
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,400
♪ Girls, girls, girls, girls

337
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,040
♪ Beach Blanket Bingo,
that's the name of the game

338
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,760
It was looked upon
as like a factory.

339
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,800
(Walter Murch) And that tends to restrict
the adventuresomeness,

340
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,200
especially in a studio environment.

341
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,400
So the Hollywood films
I'd seen as a kid growing up

342
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,280
didn't make me want
to become a filmmaker.

343
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,920
To my way of thinking,
they were corporate creations.

344
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,560
But when I was 10,

345
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,200
I learned that there was such a thing
as a tape recorder.

346
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,600
And I understood intuitively
what it did and how it did it.

347
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,920
Enemy tripod machines now in sight.

348
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,360
I would record from the radio
onto the tape recorder.

349
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
"War of the Worlds"
by H.G. Wells.

350
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,680
And then cut the tape into pieces,
and then rearrange the pieces

351
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,400
and tape them in a different order
than they were recorded,

352
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,600
flip them upside down
and play them backwards,

353
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,320
and hear what that sounded like.

354
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,680
(Audio played backwards)

355
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,440
And then I came back from school
one day and turned on the radio,

356
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,240
and I was disoriented for a moment

357
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,120
because I heard something
coming out of the radio,

358
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,240
that sounded like
what I had recorded the day before.

359
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,000
(Radio static)

360
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,680
And it was a record made in France
of musique concrète

361
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,760
by Pierre Henry and Pierre Schaeffer.

362
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,800
That was a revelation to me,
that there were people in the world,

363
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,920
French people,
doing what I was doing.

364
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,840
And they were making records of it.

365
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,160
(Cheers and applause)

366
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,840
And so I suddenly saw what I was doing
had a broader application.

367
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,920
(Waves crashing on shore)

368
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,720
I loved Ingmar Bergman films
at age 15,

369
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,320
and I loved Kurosawa...

370
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,920
(Horses' hooves clattering)

371
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,640
...because the imprint of the personality
of these filmmakers was very strong.

372
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,560
In 1963,
I went to a university in Paris,

373
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,520
studying for a year
right at the height of the New Wave.

374
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,320
I saw Jean-Luc Godard's film
"Breathless"

375
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,040
and I could tell that rules
were being broken.

376
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,280
♪ Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Patricia, Patricia

377
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
And that got me excited.

378
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,320
I got injected with the film bug,

379
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,400
and went to USC.

380
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,920
I met Walter Murch in film school.

381
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,640
He was a graduate student;
I was an undergrad.

382
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,800
It was very easy to make friends.
That was part of the fun of being there.

383
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,720
(Walter Murch) It was only
when I got to film school

384
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,360
that I realised
that you have to do to sound in film

385
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,160
the very kinds of things that I was doing
with these random sounds

386
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,200
that I recorded back in the early '50s.

387
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,760
(Various sound effects)

388
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,200
(George Lucas) Walter was coming up
with different sound ideas

389
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,920
and running tracks backwards.

390
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,520
Basically, that's all he was doing,
creating soundtracks.

391
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,920
(Walter Murch) But it was
an unusual time to go to film school

392
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,840
because television was killing film.

393
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,280
(Static)

394
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,880
President Kennedy has been shot
in Dallas, Texas.

395
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,880
(Gary Rydstrom) The '60s were
a time when we were focused

396
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
on what we saw on television
and the news.

397
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,800
- (Sirens)
- (Crowd screaming)

398
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,000
I think it was a most powerful
civil rights protest.

399
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,320
(Commotion)

400
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,120
(Gary Rydstrom) Full of unrest
and politics, Hollywood felt out of sync.

401
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,440
(Footsteps)

402
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,160
I want to hear nothing more
about this troublemaker.

403
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,760
(Gary Rydstrom) It was rock and roll
and musicians like The Beatles

404
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,280
that were capturing
culture's imagination...

405
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,760
(Cheers)

406
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,720
...more than film.

407
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,280
(Gentle music)

408
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,880
(Walter Murch) And that year
was the absolute bottom

409
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,360
of a number of films
produced in Hollywood.

410
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,520
The model on which
they had built their studios

411
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,680
was not working anymore.

412
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,320
There's not enough jobs.

413
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,040
But kind of a life raft that was extended
to us young film students

414
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,280
was a fellowship by Warner Bros.,
which George won.

415
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,000
And George met the only other person
on the lot, who had a beard,

416
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,200
who was Francis Coppola,
who was directing "Finian's Rainbow".

417
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,840
We had both been film students,
long hair,

418
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,640
everybody else on the crew
was over 50.

419
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,560
So at the end of "Finian's Rainbow",

420
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Francis wanted to make a movie
on his own called "Rain People".

421
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,800
And he said, "Do you know anybody
who knows anything about sound?"

422
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,680
And I said, "Oh, I got
the perfect guy, Walter Murch."

423
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,720
(Upbeat music)

424
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,400
"Rain People" is a road movie,
much like "Easy Rider".

425
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Our two guys in "Easy Rider"
were travelling west to east.

426
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,680
"The Rain People"
was travelling the other way.

427
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,360
(George Lucas)
So we built this truck,

428
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,280
and just went across the country,
making a movie.

429
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
(Music continues)

430
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,840
And it was the Nagra, which was
smaller, lighter sound equipment

431
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,440
that actually started the ability
to shoot movies on the street.

432
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,200
(Indistinct chatter)

433
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,920
(Walter Murch) If we can make a film
out of a shoe store in Nebraska,

434
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,280
why do we have to be in Hollywood?

435
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,040
So we moved to San Francisco.

436
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,480
(Upbeat music)

437
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,960
Francis, George and me
were all in our late 20s...

438
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,440
and we formed American Zoetrope.

439
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,320
One of the dreams or goals of Zoetrope
was to break down the barriers

440
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,480
between picture editing
and sound editing and sound mixing.

441
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,000
(Sound mixer beeping)

442
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,880
Then I could let
my musique concrète demon

443
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,120
out of the bottle completely,

444
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,080
which was a whole new direction.

445
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,760
(Gentle music)

446
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,800
So immediately after finishing
the mix on "Rain People",

447
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,280
George and I got together
to write the screenplay for "THX 1138".

448
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,560
And we got financing from Warner's.

449
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,080
I would cut picture during the day,
then Walter would come in at night,

450
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,200
and cut the sound.

451
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,560
(Various sound effects)

452
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,320
I took it upon myself to record
every sound effect for the film myself.

453
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,040
(High-pitched beep)

454
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,720
(Machine whirring)

455
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,600
(George Lucas) "THX" had a very eerie,
strange soundtrack.

456
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,360
(Walter Murch) Based on the dismal
performance of the film, commercially,

457
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Warner Bros. cancelled
the development advance

458
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,280
that they had made to Zoetrope.

459
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,480
(Music)

460
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,160
They claimed that this was
a personal loan to Francis.

461
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,320
And he owed them
all this money back.

462
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,440
The equivalent today
would be 3 million.

463
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,320
Bankrupted our company,

464
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,560
made it so I couldn't work
in the business for a while.

465
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,000
(Walter Murch) It was the end
of the road for Zoetrope.

466
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:46,520
And in that state, Francis was offered
to direct this sleazy gangster film

467
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,720
that 12 other directors
had turned down...

468
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,040
...which was "The Godfather".

469
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,520
("The Godfather" theme music)

470
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,000
But he wanted to invest the film

471
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,240
with the sensibility of the European film
and art that had influenced all of us.

472
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,200
And he pulled all of us into it.

473
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,440
When I was a kid growing up,

474
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,920
one of the composers who was doing
the most advanced thinking at the time

475
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,480
was John Cage.

476
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,280
He was proselytising
that everything is music.

477
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,680
(Running water)

478
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,680
Even the sound that the audience
makes in the theatre is music.

479
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,200
And even the sound
of the lid of the piano going down

480
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,000
is a kind of music.
He made us pay attention.

481
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,680
(Metallic thud)

482
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,760
So in "The Godfather", the moment
leading up to Sollozzo's death,

483
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,240
it is accompanied by this screechy
John Cagey sound.

484
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,520
(Speaking Italian on telephone)

485
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,400
(Train screeching to a halt)

486
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,240
(Gunshot)

487
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,200
What you're actually listening to
are Michael's neurons

488
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,120
clashing against each other

489
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,760
as he's making the decision
to actually kill these people.

490
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,880
And the murder of a dream he had
of having nothing to do with the family.

491
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,520
(Train rumbles)

492
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,800
It's not technically music,
but it conjures up emotion and meaning.

493
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,440
(Orchestral music)

494
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,240
Obviously, it became a big hit.
And that bailed Zoetrope out.

495
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,160
We were able to keep going after that.

496
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,600
This one time
I'll let you ask me about my affairs.

497
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,800
But the soundtrack of "The Godfather",

498
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,240
as it was released in theatres in 1972,
was virtually identical

499
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,920
to the soundtrack of "Gone with
the Wind", released in 1939.

500
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,080
You will promise, won't you?

501
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,400
It's a mono film with just
a single speaker behind the screen.

502
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,440
Is that... is that all, Ashley?

503
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,240
(Walter Murch)
So sound in film didn't really change.

504
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,720
But contrast that
with the music industry,

505
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,960
which was adopting
all of this new technology,

506
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,440
things like the LP, which,
by the late 1950s had stereo sound.

507
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,320
(Beethoven's Symphony No. 5
in C Minor)

508
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,080
Stereo spread the music
across two different speakers...

509
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,560
(Music grows louder)

510
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,080
...surrounding you
and immersing you in the music.

511
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,520
The Beatles, in particular, were testing
the boundaries of the medium.

512
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,960
I remember when I played "Revolver"...

513
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,880
...it was a visceral feeling,
you could feel the sound in your body.

♪ Nine, number nine

517
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,160
George Martin brought this ability
to mix and create sound design,

518
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,960
that would then be melded
with rock and roll.

519
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,120
(Gary Rydstrom)
"Revolution 9" was fascinating to me

520
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,280
because it was just like
musique concrète.

521
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,920
As we come out
of the hippie '60s era of rock music,

522
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,440
we brought that sensibility to cinema,
and thought,

523
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,840
"Why can't movies be in stereo?"

524
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,240
(Walter Murch)
It was in that over-heated environment

525
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,120
that Dolby came along

526
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,040
from the music industry in the mid 70s,
and took the lid off.

527
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,400
Providing stereo sound
in more and more theatres.

528
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,600
I remember a nameless film executive
at one of the distributors in Hollywood,

529
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,720
who actually hit his desk and said,
"Goddamn it,

530
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,480
"it's good stories and comfortable seats,
that's what sells movies, not sound!"

531
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,120
But then in 1976,
with "A Star Is Born",

532
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
Barbra Streisand
had the imagination to say,

533
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,640
"I want to do this vast stereo sound
with my film,"

534
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,080
and just to tell the studio,
"We're gonna do it."

Barbra Streisand insisted on,

542
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,080
and in fact
got an extraordinary amount of time

very sound-conscious generation.

(Gary Rydstrom) So between
the technological and creative advances

600
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,280
of the early 1970s
sound was taking route

601
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,840
in a new American Renaissance
of movies,

602
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,600
in a way that had
never been heard before.

603
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,520
Oh, I understand.

604
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,720
But heading into the late '70s,

605
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,480
even bigger breakthroughs
were on the way.

606
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,840
(George Lucas) Most directors
spent a lot of time with their cameramen

607
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,320
and actors.

608
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,960
I just take the same amount of time
and spend it with the sound designer.

609
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,520
But when I started my next film,

610
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,640
Francis was doing "The Conversation"
and Walter was busy on that.

611
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,040
So I called Ken Miura at USC
and said,

612
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,000
"Do you have anybody else
like Walter?"

613
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,120
He said,
"Yeah, I got somebody here."

614
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,320
(Ben Burtt) My mother tells me that
as a toddler I loved to act out to music,

615
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,360
that if she put a record on,
I would not only dance around the room,

616
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,920
but I would assume characters,
I'd be a cowboy

617
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,960
or I'd be
some kind of pirate or something.

618
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,240
But when I was about
six years old, I had a serious illness

619
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,520
and I was in bed for a few weeks
and very weak.

620
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,160
But my father had access
to a tape recorder.

621
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,320
And he brought that home.

622
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,880
I began recording television shows

623
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,040
by putting the microphone up to the TV

624
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,640
and recording
the Saturday morning cartoons.

625
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,000
There were two television stations

626
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,320
and one of them had the Warner Bros.
package of syndicated film.

627
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,800
I loved recording Errol Flynn movies
in particular.

628
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,240
(Upbeat music)

629
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,080
(Gunshot)

630
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,560
(Ben Burtt)
They ran the Cagney gangster movies.

631
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,040
And Bogart films.

632
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,640
So I got very familiar with the sounds
of Warner Bros' classic library.

633
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,920
The other channel
pretty much showed MGM.

634
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:00,640
♪ Somewhere over the rainbow...

635
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,160
♪ Singing in the rain,
just singing in the rain...

636
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,440
(Ben Burtt) As the other children were
developing a love for certain music,

637
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,760
I was listening to explosions.

638
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,040
(Explosion)

639
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,040
(Ben Burtt)
So I began collecting things I liked.

640
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,440
And I'd seek after a movie
just to record the battle scenes

641
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,320
and just listen to them.

642
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,880
I think the thousands of hours
I spent doing that as a kid,

643
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,760
unknown to me,
that was building up an inventory

644
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,360
of how sound in movies
was part of the experience.

645
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,840
I started making my own little movies.

646
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,200
In those days you couldn't record
live sound while shooting super 8 films.

647
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,440
But I could generate a soundtrack
after the fact

648
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,600
by taking sound effects I had extracted
from movies and television shows

649
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,000
and putting them in my movies.

650
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,280
(Gunfire)

651
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,160
I first met Ben Burtt
at USC Film School.

652
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,280
We kind of were kindred spirits.

653
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,680
Whereas a lot of the students were
into all the Antonioni and the arty films,

654
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,520
we kind of liked the traditional
Hollywood fun films and serials.

655
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,040
(Explosion)

656
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,400
Rod Flash.

657
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,280
(Richard Anderson)
We wrote this movie

658
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,160
called "Rod Flash Conquers Infinity".

659
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,320
Ben and I dressed up
in these knock-off Flash Gordon things

660
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,680
that we got at an army surplus store
in Hollywood.

661
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,160
(Explosion)

662
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,080
We were making
the voyage to the planet Extraneous.

663
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,840
(Dramatic music)

664
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,440
We discover a dinosaur.

665
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,760
And of course
we have a pretty girl in a cape.

666
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,000
(Dinosaur roars)

667
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,360
And Ben did the sound on that one.

668
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,320
So I was just finishing at USC Cinema,

669
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,160
and Gary Kurtz who had represented
George Lucas, came down to school,

670
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,600
looking for a student
interested in sound

671
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,400
who they could mould
into their own ways.

672
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,720
I went out to the studio
and met with the two of them.

673
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,520
And they outlined the film
they were gonna make.

674
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,480
They had artwork on the walls
done by Ralph McQuarrie,

675
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,680
concept art for the film.

676
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,320
I was astounded by what I saw.

677
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,200
This was the film
I always wanted to work on.

678
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,720
This had spaceships and monsters
and weapons like lightsabres.

679
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,080
It was called "Star Wars".

680
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,480
So I leap at the chance
and the initial discussion was,

681
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,400
"Would you like to help collect sounds
for a Wookiee?"

682
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,880
This is still about a year away
from principal photography.

683
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,560
I put Ben on in the beginning
because I knew

684
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,400
I had to figure out a way
of making these characters real.

685
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,680
And I knew it depended on
how we developed these languages,

686
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,320
and that's what Ben spent
the better part of a year doing.

687
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,680
(Ben Burtt)
We were trying to find an animal

688
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,720
that had enough
vocal expressiveness

689
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,800
in its sounds that we could use it
for the Wookiee.

690
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,360
So there was a young bear
named Pooh.

691
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,040
And we spent an afternoon
with this bear in a pen,

692
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,440
coaxing it to say different sounds.

693
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,480
The way they got it to make sound
was to show it bread. It loved bread.

694
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,480
- The bear would...
- (Imitates bear growl)

695
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,080
(Growls)

696
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,280
Then you'd give him the bread
and then he'd be like...

697
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,840
(Imitates bear sounds)

698
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,440
George wanted to know
before they filmed the movie

699
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,400
how would the Wookiee sound.

700
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,160
Well, you said it, Chewie.

701
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,000
This is not the way that most filmmakers
worked at that time.

702
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,400
(George Lucas) I knew the sound
was part of the foundation

703
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,000
of what the movie was gonna be.

704
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,360
So everything had to have been
figured out way ahead of time.

705
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,520
So I proceeded to work my way
through the screenplay of "Star Wars".

706
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,880
I read through it,
made some notes, broke it down,

707
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,200
and I realised there were
hundreds of things in the script

708
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,240
from Darth Vader's breathing,
and you had the Death Star,

709
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,360
you had TIE fighters
and a whole library of things in there.

710
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,360
I said, "Well, do you want sounds
for the rest of these things as well?"

711
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,600
The answer was, "Yeah, sure.
Just spend some time."

712
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,800
And so I operated out of my apartment
for many months

713
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,280
coming up with expeditions
to go out and gather sound,

714
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,160
while George was off in England,
busy shooting the movie.

715
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,800
I was still based in LA.

716
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,600
He wanted me to go out
and record real motors

717
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,760
and real airplanes,
and real rusty doors.

718
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,040
This hum of a projector,

719
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,160
a buzzing sound
behind the television set.

720
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,760
I tried to go to factories
and a scuba shop.

721
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,880
I just started recording everything
I could get my hands on.

722
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,720
And to populate
the universe of "Star Wars"

723
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,320
with the sounds of things
that we would hear as real.

724
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,280
We didn't wanna follow
the conventions of science fiction

725
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,960
that were current at the time

726
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,720
which was things like "Forbidden Planet"
or "War of the Worlds",

727
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,480
using electronic music technology.

728
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,280
We didn't use synthesisers
or anything like that.

729
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,480
We used real sound effects.

730
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,720
(Spacecraft engines roar)

731
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,800
(Ben Burtt) So a year or so
went by of me collecting

732
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,760
and when they returned from filming,
I got a note saying,

733
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,720
"We'll take the tapes
and deliver them to Northern California."

734
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,000
They were doing the picture editing
in George's house.

735
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,920
So I started to cut my sound effects
into the editor's cuts of the movie.

736
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,360
But R2-D2 took a long time.

737
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,000
There were many versions of that
over months that were failures.

738
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,120
You have to actually make him talk

739
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,200
and make you understand
what he's saying.

740
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,240
(Ben Burtt)
And R2 had no mouth at all.

741
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,640
What Mission?
What are you talking about?

742
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,400
We were very worried
that it would be incomprehensible.

743
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,440
What eventually happened was,

744
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,880
as George and I
were talking to each other,

745
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,920
we would say, "R2 comes up
to this point in the movie and he goes..."

746
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,920
(Imitates R2D2 speech)

747
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,760
(R2D2 computerised speech)

748
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,240
And suddenly we realised
we were talking with expressive sounds.

749
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,920
They had the intonation of meaning.

750
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,560
We were verbalising a sound
that worked for us.

751
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,200
(R2D2 computerised speech)

752
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,920
And that led down the road
of doing just that.

753
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,080
I could do a vocalisation
and play something on the keyboard...

754
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,240
...and you could sort of
work two things together.

755
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,400
(R2D2 computerised speech)

756
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,400
What mission?
What are you talking about?

757
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,200
(R2D2 computerised speech)

758
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,840
I've just about had enough of you.
Go that way.

759
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,920
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you near-sighted scrap pile.

760
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,160
(Bang)

761
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,440
We were not sure that audiences
would comprehend this at all though.

762
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,360
I didn't know.
I was nervous, as anybody would be.

763
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,800
I thought maybe
this was probably the end.

764
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,000
I'd go back and become a science
teacher somewhere in the East.

765
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,680
(George Lucas) You got to remember,
my first film was a failure.

766
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,440
I thought,
the ultimate honour would be

767
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,400
if we could be invited
to a "Star Trek" convention.

768
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,000
I could sell T-shirts.

769
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:05,080
Maybe we'd have a table there
to hand out posters or something.

770
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,400
That to me would have been
the peak of my career.

771
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,560
When the film was finished,
Fox didn't really know what they had.

772
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,320
I sat in a meeting with a Fox executive
with Gary Kurtz

773
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,560
and the Fox Executive said,

774
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,680
"We like your movie, Gary,
but we think it's a sleeper.

775
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,120
"We think it's gonna open very slowly."

776
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,880
I sat in the Coronet Theater
in San Francisco

777
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,640
for the opening show there,
70mm print.

778
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,880
I was sitting actually
in the middle of the audience

779
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,800
and this guy sitting next to me
as the plane comes overhead...

780
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,760
(Dramatic music)

781
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,200
(Laser firing)

782
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,680
And this guy goes,
"Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit."

783
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,560
And two weeks later,
there were lines around the blocks

784
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,440
across the country
waiting for "Star Wars".

785
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,800
(Applause)

786
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,680
The award goes to
Mr Benjamin Burtt, Jr.

787
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,920
("Star Wars theme music)

788
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,840
Thank you very much.

789
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,040
I would like to, of course,
thank George Lucas

790
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,600
who had all the great ideas
and provided all the inspiration

791
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,200
for the things in "Star Wars".
Thank you very much.

792
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,360
(Applause)

793
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,600
It is the imaginative director
who will say,

794
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,760
"Let's take the next step
in the sound story."

795
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,440
George Lucas and Gary Kurtz,

796
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,640
Barbra Streisand on "A Star Is Born",

797
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,200
Francis Coppola, Stanley Kubrick,

798
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,840
those are the key players who will say,
"Yes, I'll do this."

799
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,160
(Cheers and applause)

800
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,760
"Star Wars" was a revolution.

801
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:00,760
It was that soundtrack
that changed everything, 1977.

802
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,160
(Gary Rydstrom) In people's minds,
it was a time when sound was cool.

803
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,760
And it created this era
driven by the filmmakers.

804
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,960
At that time,
David Lynch and Alan Splet

805
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,640
came out of AFI
and were a partnership.

806
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,360
These really great minds
were doing experimental things.

807
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,480
I believe the source of everyone's
creativity comes from within.

808
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,440
('Cello being played)

809
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,440
And Alan,
he was a born soundman.

810
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,240
Very interested in music,
especially classical music.

811
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,560
And he was a joyous experimenter.

812
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,560
The trick for the human being

813
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,520
is experiencing
this deepest level of life.

814
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,000
The unbounded
infinite ocean of consciousness

815
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,440
at the base of all matter and mind,

816
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,640
where sounds play a huge role
in the abstract cinema.

817
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,680
You wanna bring people into a world
and give them an experience

818
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,200
and you could get lost in there
for years.

819
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,560
(Static effects)

820
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,000
So it was in the air -
breaking the mould,

821
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,160
and trying things
that seemed crazy

822
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,600
and seeing if they worked.

823
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,320
The '70s was a really good time
of filmmaking.

824
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,400
There was no more experimental
or chaotic film in all of history,

825
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,880
that so changed the way film sound
was done and presented

826
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,520
as "Apocalypse Now".

827
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,960
(Helicopter blades whirring)

828
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,960
("Apocalypse Now" theme music)

829
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,280
During the shooting
of "Apocalypse Now",

830
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,680
Francis heard a record by Tomita

831
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,560
which was "The Planets"
by Gustav Holst in 4-track.

832
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,440
The idea was that you put speakers
at each corner of your room,

833
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,840
you sat in the centre
and you were surrounded by the music.

834
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,480
(Dramatic music)

835
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,520
Francis heard it and thought
this is how I want the film to sound.

836
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,760
But all of us working on the sound -

837
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,920
Richards Beggs, Mark Berger
and myself, we'd only work in mono.

838
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,080
None of us had even worked
on a stereo film

839
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,080
let alone this whole new
6-track surround format.

840
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,560
We were exploring the unknown
going into this whole new continent

841
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,560
where we move objects
all the way around the theatre

842
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,640
which had never been done before.

843
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,840
(Helicopter blades whirring)

844
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,480
If you're breaking new ground

845
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,640
then people who are interested
in new ground

846
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,400
come because
they want to participate in it

847
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,080
and more ground gets broken.

848
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,960
(Randy Thom) I spent about half my time
on "Apocalypse" in the mix,

849
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,440
sitting there watching Walter Murch

850
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,320
and Mark Berger
and Richard Beggs and Francis,

851
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,320
figuring out what this movie
was going to sound like.

852
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,800
Working on "Apocalypse Now"
was my film school.

853
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,240
Ultimately, we wound up
spending a year and a half

854
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,240
editing the sound
and nine months doing the mix

855
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,080
which is just unheard of.

856
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,640
(Randy Thom) Just about everything
that could go right or go wrong did.

857
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,640
The whole "Apocalypse Now"
experience was like dropping acid.

858
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,360
♪ This is the end, beautiful friend

859
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,120
What you have
at the beginning of the film

860
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,000
is Captain Willard
in his Saigon hotel room hallucinating,

861
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,640
regretting what he's done in the war.

862
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,800
Everything that you see and hear

863
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,960
is being filtered
through his consciousness.

864
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,400
(Ceiling fan blades whirring)

865
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,040
♪ Waiting for the summer rain, yeah

866
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,560
(♪ "The End", The Doors)

867
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:48,360
And that decision is what allowed Walter
to do what he did with the sound.

868
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,600
(Helicopter blades whirring)

869
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,360
To tell the story
more from the point of view

870
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,080
of this character
in this crazy situation in Vietnam.

871
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,080
Saigon.

872
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,640
Shit.

873
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,160
And it frames the whole movie.

874
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
(Helicopter blades whirring)

875
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,520
(Indistinct chatter)

876
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,560
The most interesting sound
is designed into the script

877
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,720
and is designed into the scenes.

878
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:29,600
(Walter Murch) So I wrote out a script
for the sound treatment of the film

879
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,080
to guide the mix.

880
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,120
(Helicopters whirring)

881
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,920
(Water splashing)

882
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,160
(Pat Jackson) Walter decided
that it was more efficient

883
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,520
if each editor be responsible
for one whole layer of sound,

884
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,520
so that the helicopters
were edited by one editor

885
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,280
and the background voices
were edited by another editor.

886
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,520
(Walter Murch) Les Hodgson
was in charge of atmospheres.

887
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,080
Les Wiggins
was in charge of munitions.

888
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,720
Pat Jackson
was in charge of the boat.

889
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,920
So that there was a consistency.

890
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,040
(Walter Murch)
To treat each sound editor

891
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,400
as the head of an instrument grouping
in an orchestra.

892
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,240
You are the lead violin.
You are head of the woodwinds.

893
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,160
You are head of percussion.

894
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,920
You are head of the brasses.

895
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,600
And as Chief is dying, Pat Jackson
changed the pitch of the boat

896
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,160
so that the boat sound is going down.

897
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,280
(Groans)

898
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,640
I think the biggest lesson
I learned from "Apocalypse Now"

899
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,320
sitting there was figuring out
from moment to moment

900
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,280
what sounds to use
and what sounds not to use.

901
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,400
Those kinds of decisions
are the essence of film.

902
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,760
And the exhibitors are going to play
the picture on our terms,

903
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,080
with our sound,
the way we want them to show it.

904
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,920
(Walter Murch) The film did run
in this 6-track surround format.

905
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,960
And as things have evolved
over the next 30, 40 years,

906
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,360
that format is now the ground standard
of how you mix a film.

907
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,840
(Helicopter blades whirring)

908
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,040
The soundtrack is at least
as important as the film.

909
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:41,840
And the director of the soundtrack
of the entire movie is Walter Murch.

910
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,720
(Applause)

911
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,800
In a way, Walter Murch
is the father of us all

912
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,520
in this modern era of film sound.

913
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,040
(Gary Rydstrom) "Apocalypse Now"
marked the culmination

914
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,200
of over 50 years
of film sound development.

915
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,600
And its repercussions
can still be felt today.

916
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,080
But the next big challenge for sound

917
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,560
was how to work
in the crazy new digital world.

918
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,760
(John Lasseter) I always thought that
animation was such a visual medium.

919
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,400
But when I started putting
just the right sound effects

920
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,480
it just made it a thousand times better.

921
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,840
February of 1986, we formed Pixar.

922
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,080
I had been working
on animating these desk lamps.

923
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,240
So I made this little one
and a half minute short film,

924
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,200
called Luxo Jr.

925
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,440
And of course we wanted Ben Burtt
to do the sound,

926
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,240
but they told us he was busy.

927
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,520
And they say, but there's this young guy
that's been working with Ben.

928
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,600
He's really, really good.

929
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,960
Let's give this new guy a try.
His name's Gary Rydstrom.

930
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,440
But I want Ben Burtt.

931
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,400
I think all of my early opportunities

932
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,200
were shows that people
wanted Ben Burtt,

933
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,880
is how it works in the world, right?

934
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,360
We'd like Ben Burtt, please,
he's not available, who else you got?

935
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,600
(John Lasseter) Now, Luxo Jr. was
definitely a huge step forward

936
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,800
for animation.
And it had a very real look to him.

937
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,800
And Gary kept looking at it going,
"I wanna ground this in reality."

938
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,320
I had this digital workstation
called the Synclavier,

939
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,360
where I could take real sounds,
load them into the computer

940
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,840
and manipulate them
on the keyboard.

941
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,200
Like scraping metal,
the screwing in of lightbulbs.

942
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,720
Harsh, boring sounds.
And the springs...

943
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,200
You record sounds you don't know
what they're going to be for,

944
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,680
but they're interesting.

945
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,160
And later on, you'll find little titbits
that have a little vocal quality.

946
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,160
It's sad or happy.

947
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,800
And next thing you know,
he brought me down

948
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,200
and he showed me
a first pass of Luxo Jr.

949
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,040
And the characters came alive.

950
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,240
(Various sound effects)

951
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,080
He crafted their voices
and he gave them weight.

952
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,120
Gary got it.

953
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,160
He took the medium
of computer animation to new heights.

954
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,360
And pretty much everything Pixar did,
Gary did the sound for.

955
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,520
I thought this is cool,
I'm part of something really big here.

956
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,560
George Lucas and Ben Burtt,

957
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,840
Francis Coppola and Walter Murch,

958
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,840
David Lynch and Alan Splet.

959
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,920
Great directors connected
at the hip to a sound person.

960
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,080
One of mine
was with John Lasseter...

961
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,000
...and another was
with Steven Spielberg.

962
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,080
Action.

963
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,360
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

964
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,080
(Dramatic music)

965
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,600
We're gonna make a fortune
with this place.

966
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,400
I think Gary Rydstrom's
greatest contribution to "Jurassic Park"

967
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,680
was presuming
what dinosaurs sounded like.

968
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,480
To make them extraordinary,
but also natural.

969
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,800
(Dinosaur groans)

970
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,680
(Shrieks)

971
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,960
(Dinosaur groans)

972
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,400
(Loud roar)

973
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,720
And the first time
I ever heard the T-Rex,

974
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,960
I did literally fall off my chair.

975
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,280
Talk about innovative,

976
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,400
it was just unbelievable the sound
that he did on "Jurassic Park".

977
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,640
So we just asked him
to do sound for us

978
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,080
on the first computer animated
feature film.

979
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,480
♪ You've got a friend in me

980
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,600
(Andrew Stanton) I just appreciated
how Gary was making sure

981
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,720
that the sounds he used
supported the emotional intention

982
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,760
of the narrative
of whatever was going on.

983
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,720
Say, what's that button do?

984
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,240
- I'll show you.
- Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

985
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,320
- Whoa.
- Wow.

986
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,640
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull-string only.

987
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:10,000
We wanted to have one thing
that both Woody and Buzz had

988
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,800
that you could tell
Woody's was older and cheesier.

989
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,080
And Buzz's was new and high-tech
and that was a sound system.

990
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,640
I had an old Casper doll.

991
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:28,920
There's a record in there
that he is... Come on, Cas.

992
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,600
See that's like, "I love you."

993
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,760
(Laughs)

994
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,880
He's sounding awesome these days.
Oh, come on, Casper.

995
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,560
Reach for the sky.

996
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,920
Gary loved that idea.

997
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,040
We were innovating
with computers so much

998
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,560
and creating new tools for animation.

999
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,720
Therefore, he was at the same time
using computers for the first time,

1000
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,040
in really clever ways
to do sound design.

1001
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,360
You know,
it's mind-blowing to think that just,

1002
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,680
I don't know,
even many people around the industry

1003
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,120
were still cutting sound
at that time on mag.

1004
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,640
(Gary Rydstrom)
Up until the early 1990s,

1005
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,760
we were cutting one track of sound
at a time on mag film.

1006
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,200
But by the mid 1990s,

1007
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,920
sound editing migrated
to computer systems like Pro Tools.

1008
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,040
Now we could see the waveforms
we were editing,

1009
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,080
but more importantly,
sound editors could finally hear

1010
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,440
how all their tracks played together.

1011
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,120
(Various sound effects)

1012
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,080
It was a very exciting time
for all people in visual and sound.

1013
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,640
(Dramatic music)

1014
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,280
(Dane Davis)
So all of a sudden I get this call.

1015
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,720
The Wachowskis said, "Remember
that really great script called 'The Matrix'

1016
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,920
"that we used to talk about
on the mixing stage? It's green-lit."

1017
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,320
And the fact that the movie
was about this digital reality

1018
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,720
that was coming through a wire,

1019
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,160
I thought there was some parallel

1020
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,000
to trying to do all
of the sound design in the digital world.

1021
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,200
And it was a chance
to apply this technology,

1022
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,400
that was still sketchy,
but allowed for all these possibilities.

1023
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,480
(Electronic sound effects)

1024
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,320
One of the first sounds
that I developed

1025
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,360
was the sound of Neo
perceiving himself being digitised.

1026
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,720
Did you...?

1027
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,480
In the digital world,
everything is zeros and ones,

1028
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,880
just little boxes basically.

1029
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,520
I wanted to get that feeling across
to the audience, the jaggedness.

1030
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,680
(Loud scream)

1031
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,920
(Computerised beeping)

1032
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,400
Computers did allow us

1033
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,840
to do some very fun creative work
on "The Matrix".

1034
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,760
There would not have been
time otherwise.

1035
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,480
And I've always had a love hate thing
with technology.

1036
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,360
Computers suck.

1037
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,000
Part of me just wants to live
in the woods and carve sticks.

1038
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,960
I have seen the future, this is it,
it definitely does not work.

1039
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,120
But another part of me
just loves all these fancy tools.

1040
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,280
(David Lynch) These days there are
so many tools to manipulate a sound

1041
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,920
that now pretty much in sound,
if you can think it, you can do it.

1042
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,280
(Various sound effects)

1043
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,600
(Gary Rydstrom) But ultimately
it wasn't about the technology.

1044
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,720
It's the contribution of dozens
of sound people.

1045
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,560
A circle of talent
who collaborate behind the scenes

1046
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,600
to help tell the story.

1047
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:51,040
The human voice - it's the great
possession of the individual.

1048
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,640
It can have all sorts of nuances,
and it's unique.

1049
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,800
If you listen real close,

1050
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,040
you can hear them
whisper their legacy to you.

1051

Carpe diem, seize the day, boys.

1052
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,400
When you're recording

1053
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,320
what you're really trying to capture
is the performance.

You have my permission to die.

1055

With a boom microphone,

01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,040
you're about maybe 10 inches away
from a person's mouth.

1058
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,480
It's an enormous sense of intimacy
that you get.

As a director I can hear the truth

when an actor
is indicating something or...

one film that I'm very proud of

It was called "Monster".

1083
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,600
It was about the serial killer,
Aileen Wuornos.

1084
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,280
You don't have to do this.

1085
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,040
- Get down.
- You don't.

1086
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,840
We captured
every little breath.

1087
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,920
(Crying)

1088
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,240
Oh, God. Oh, God.
My wife. My wife.

1089
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,640
And my daughter is having a baby.

1090
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,560
Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1091
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,600
That was one of those moments

1092
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,200
where literally the hair stood
on the back of your neck

1093
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,240
at the end of the performance.

1094
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,520
But just all those things
that you battle as a sound mixer.

1095
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,600
You're dealing with wind.
That is never our friend.

1096
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,120
There's many, many things
that are required

1097
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,640
for things to look right on camera
that are noisy.

1098
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,680
(Gunshots)

1099
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,440
I know the ships can sail
into the triangles not necessarily...

1100
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,320
Let's see who's guilty of putting me
in this dreadful pickle.

1101
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,720
And if you're hearing those,
that takes you out of the story.

1102
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,120
(Quiet music)

1103
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,360
That's why we edit the dialogue.

1104
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,240
(Quiet music)

1105
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,160
(Film projector whirring)

1106
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,800
My mom is Kay Rose,

1107
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,000
and she was the first woman
to win an Oscar for sound.

1108
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,560
She could hear clicks and pops
that shouldn't be there,

1109
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,000
take it out, fill it with ambience,

1110
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,160
and it would be very smooth.

1111
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,240
"Ordinary People" was a movie
my mom and I worked on

1112
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,440
and it was one of the hardest
sound jobs we've ever done.

1113
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:34,000
The movie is about a family
affected by the death of their older son.

1114
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,800
The surviving son
goes to a psychiatrist.

1115
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,280
Uh, hi. Yeah. Come in.
It's OK. They all do that.

1116
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:44,320
They chose an aluminium warehouse
near an airport

1117
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,480
for these very intimate scenes
with the psychiatrist...

1118
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,200
Sit down.

1119
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,400
...which was awful.

1120
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,640
I had a fairly strong idea
about sound,

1121
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,600
but I had not directed a film before
so I needed help,

1122
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,520
and she did just a great job.

1123
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,400
(Victoria Rose Sampson)
It took weeks to try to get out

1124
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:13,800
the little clicks and pops and planes
for ten minutes of production dialogue.

1125
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:14,400
Weeks!

1126
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,400
You wanna tell me about it?

1127
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,120
(Robert Redford) The silence
was meant to illustrate pain,

1128
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,280
the disconnect between people.

1129
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,360
You can go upstairs
to that room of yours

1130
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,040
and clean out the closet,

1131
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,920
because it really is a mess.

1132
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,120
(Gwendelyn Whittle)
The dialogue department

1133
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,040
we're the queens of the soundtrack.

1134
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,760
Jake, my Jake!

1135
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,920
Everything falls apart without it.

1136
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,600
It's the thing that everything
has to work around.

1137
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:55,280
You don't want to lose a moment
in a film saying to your friend,

1138
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,360
"What did he say?"

1139
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,120
That's why sometimes
we need to shoot ADR.

1140
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,240
(Gasping)

1141
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,600
(Groaning)

1142
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,000
ADR stands for...

1143
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,080
Lilian...

1144
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,320
...automated dialogue replacement.

1145
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,400
(Gasps)

1146
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,760
It's dialogue that's re-recorded
in a sound studio.

1147
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
Good.

1148
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,800
You pick out some lines
that might be really low to hear.

1149
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:28,840
The actors have to come in,
re-record, and then we, as editors,

1150
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,680
have to cut it to try to match
those peoples' mouths.

1151
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,480
So Beth Bergeron hired me
on "A League of Their Own".

1152
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,040
One of the scenes that I cut
was when Tom Hanks is yelling...

1153
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,120
There's no crying in baseball.

1154
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,520
(Crying)

1155
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,600
Her crying on the set
was actually really kind of soft.

1156
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,280
Are you crying?

1157
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:58,280
And so in order to get her crying again,
you had to get Tom Hanks as well.

1158
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1159
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,840
Because they're overlapping
each other.

1160
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,720
All right.
Listen, listen, listen.

1161
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,760
Rogers Hornsby was my manager,

1162
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,800
and he called me
a talking pile of pig shit.

1163
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,560
So that way when they mix,

1164
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,760
they could then bring up her crying
when they need to.

1165
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,280
- And did I cry?
- (Sobs) No. No.

1166
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,360
No. Because there's no crying
in baseball.

1167
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,320
I loved working on that film.

1168
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,400
(Grunts)

1169
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,960
(Crowd cheers)

1170
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:28,200
But our job is also to add
the background people,

1171
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,800
and that's what we call group ADR.

1172
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,280
(Crowd chanting)

1173
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:44,120
Most people might not realise
that that whole opening of "Argo",

1174
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,600
the assumption is,
"Oh, that's all recorded on set,."

1175
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,480
But the truth is
all of that's reconstructed.

1176
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,120
(Crowd chanting)

1177
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,720
We had over a hundred
Farsi-speaking Persian extras.

1178
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,440
(Crowd chanting)

1179
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,120
We were micing the crowd
from right in the middle of it,

1180
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,120
and from behind windows,
from the rooftops.

1181
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,280
After a few hours of this,
everyone was like hugging,

1182
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,960
and a few people were crying,
and we found out that

1183
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:20,760
some of our voice talent had
actually lived through the revolution.

1184
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,080
(Crowd chanting)

1185
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,640
And all of that emotion
that we were recording,

1186
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:30,440
it became part of the DNA of the scene.

1187
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,160
(Crowd chanting)

1188
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,600
(Gunshots)

1189
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,160
(Commotion)

1190
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,800
(Gunshots)

1191
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,680
(Greg Hedgepath) When people ask me
about working on "Selma"

1192
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,960
I tell them it's the first film
that I worked on

1193
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,840
that really meant something.

1194
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,960
(Bobbi Banks)
When they're on the bridge,

1195
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,920
they're running for their lives
so they don't get killed.

1196
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:08,360
You want the audience to feel the pain.

1197
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,800
(Music)

1198
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,720
(Chanting)

1199
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,120
(Coughing)

1200
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,480
(Greg Hedgepath)
When I had people running by the mics,

1201
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,680
it's more real
because it's got movement.

1202
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,640
It's got cloth movement.
It's got feet.

1203
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,760
They're turning their heads
and they're doing efforts,

1204
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,600
and so it just sounds more real.

1205
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,160
It was so important to me
to work on this film.

1206
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,720
It allows me to relive some of the things,
as I was a child...

1207
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,880
(Sombre music)

1208
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,560
...that speaks to
what people went through,

1209
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,000
what we're still going through today.

1210
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,920
I'm just really proud
that I was able to work on it.

1211
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,160
(Upbeat music)

1212
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,520
(Gary Rydstrom)
Surrounding the voices in the movie

1213
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,520
is a whole world of sound effects

1214
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,000
created and cut by the sound editors,

1215
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,800
and it consists of three distinct parts.

1216
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,920
♪ Highway to the danger zone

1217
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,360
(Cece Hall) I got hired to do "Top Gun"
with George Watters.

1218
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,960
So I spent a week in San Diego
recording jets with John Fasal.

1219
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,960
(Plane engines roaring)

1220
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,840
But the jets themselves
are not that interesting.

1221
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,160
They sounded kind of wimpy.

1222
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,040
(Film projector whirring)

1223
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:48,080
So I created a library
of mostly exotic animal roars,

1224
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,080
lions and tiger roars
and monkey screeches.

1225
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,960
(Jet engines roaring)

1226
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,760
And that wound up being the thing.

1227
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,600
It gave them a cutting, sharp feeling.

1228
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:12,320
(Jet engines roaring)

1229
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,320
(Explosion)

1230
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:23,120
It's the most labour-intensive
editing process I've ever experienced.

1231
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,920
It took forever,

1232
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,640
which the studio was very frightened by
and didn't understand.

1233
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,840
And so at one point
in the middle of this process,

1234
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,320
there was an executive from the studio.

1235
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:43,920
He came over to fire me, and he said,
"This movie isn't about the sound.”

1236
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,440
But months later, we were nominated
for an Academy Award.

1237
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,200
And I will say that he sent me flowers,

1238
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,680
and the note said,
"I guess it was about the sound."

1239
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,040
(Chuckles)

1240
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,960
She's also a civilian contractor

1241
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,040
so you do not salute her,
but you better listen to her.

1242
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,920
(Anna Behlmer) People who say, "Well,
you know, it's a big action war movie.

1243
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,960
"A guy should do the sound."

1244
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,680
It's like, why?
Has he been in a war?

1245
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,160
(Swords clattering)

1246
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,920
(Anna Behlmer) This idea of one gender
being better at it than another,

1247
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,680
I think is kind of silly.

1248
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,320
It's experience.

1249
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,160
You're sitting in front
of this big piece of equipment

1250
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,520
and it looks very complicated
and technical.

1251
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,280
It's like you peek into the cockpit
and there's all that equipment.

1252
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,360
It's like you want to have
some big guy

1253
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,000
who looks like he was
in the Air Force in there,

1254
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:45,080
'cause if anything goes wrong,
that person will... get a screwdriver.

1255
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,640
I don't know,
because the job consists of

1256
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,720
pushing little buttons
and turning little knobs,

1257
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,800
and that's not particularly
a macho endeavour at all.

1258
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,200
(Object clatters)

1259
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,720
But if you don't see anybody
like yourself doing something,

1260
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,480
then that doesn't seem like
a place you could fit in.

1261
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:15,000
(John Roesch)
Foley is a subset of sound effects.

1262
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,480
(Footsteps)

1263
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,720
We're called Foley artists.

1264
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,000
And truly what we do
is custom sound effects.

1265
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,160
(Water splashing)

1266
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,760
(Alyson Dee Moore)
We're really like performers.

1267
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,360
Getting into their mindset.

1268
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,680
We really give them character.

1269
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,120
(Coat rustles)

1270
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,600
(Objects rustling)

1271
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,920
It's that detail
that you don't really think about

1272
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,080
that makes it come alive.

1273
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,920
(Glass shatters)

1274
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,680
There's a famous story
where Jack Foley...

1275
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,360
- (Glass chinking)
- ...heard the director of "Spartacus"

1276
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,920
bemoaning the fact
that the armour they were wearing,

1277
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,200
sounded like tin pots.

1278
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,920
(Armour chinking)

1279
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,360
They were saying, "We'll have
to go back and reshoot the picture."

1280
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,040
Huge cost.

1281
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,080
Jack said, "Wait a second."

1282
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,040
He runs out to his car,
he grabs some props,

1283
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,320
some big set of keys etc.,
comes in, and works his magic.

1284
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:37,040
(Suspenseful music)

1285
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,600
Which is kind of fun, because that's
what Foley really is for us. It's magic.

1286
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,000
(Armour chinking)

1287
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,480
(Atmospheric music)

1288
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,440
The last subset of sound effects
are ambiences,

1289
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,200
atmospheric beds of sounds

1290
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,880
that editors
lay underneath everything else.

1291
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,200
(Sophia Ford Coppola) I think
on any film, like "Lost in Translation",

1292
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,360
building the world and the atmosphere,
the sound is such a big part of it

1293
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,800
that you don't realise
until you're working on it.

1294
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,880
(Various background
outdoor street sounds)

1295
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,480
Picking up all these little details

1296
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,680
and adding these layers that makes
you feel like you're really there.

1297
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,840
(Train station announcement
in Japanese in background)

1298
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,520
There's this whole other world
that it brings -

1299
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,240
it's really half the movie.

1300
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,600
It's a bed of sound in the scene

1301
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:44,920
that sets you in that environment.
It could be traffic.

1302
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
(Car engine roaring)

1303
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,080
A bed of Cicadas.

1304
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,320
(Cicadas chirping)

1305
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,440
The sound of a room...

1306
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,160
...or birds.

1307
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,880
(Birds chirping)

1308
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,360
It has to be evocative.

1309
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,760
(Robert Redford) When I was
11 years old, I had a mild case of polio.

1310
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,840
So as a reward for getting better,

1311
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,000
my mom drove me
to Yosemite National Park.

1312
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,040
Once I went through that tunnel
and it opened up,

1313
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:22,120
and I saw Half Dome and El Capitan,
I said, "Well, this is it for me."

1314
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,400
I don't wanna look at this.
I wanna be in it.

1315
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,320
(Waterfall flowing)

1316
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:34,280
The sound of those falls
rushing past me as I climbed up.

1317
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,440
The power of water.

1318
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,040
I like to use that in film.

1319
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,520
(Christopher Boyes) I was working
on "A River Runs Through It",

1320
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,640
and the sound designer just said,

1321
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,760
"Look, I just need you to go out
and record sounds."

1322
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,360
(Flicks switch)

1323
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,560
I knew every stream
within a hundred miles.

1324
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,200
(Flowing water)

1325
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:02,440
When I heard it back in the film,
I could feel the moisture of the stream,

1326
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:06,040
and I could hear the presence
of this volume of air.

1327
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,240
(Birds chirping)

1328
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,320
That hit me so heavily,

1329
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,640
I thought to myself,

1330
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:18,600
"This is me with my father fishing
as an eight-year-old boy."

1331
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,640
(Gentle piano music)

1332
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:27,400
It brings me to a really peaceful,
important time in my life.

1333
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,800
Everything has emotion,
and therefore spirit.

1334
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,720
(Eugene Gearty)
Ang really wanted the wind

1335
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,720
to have its own character
in this movie.

1336
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,000
(Clothes flapping in wind)

1337
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,800
(Ang Lee) Wind sound was
very expressive for the characters.

1338
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,600
How much they're quiet
about their feelings.

1339
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,960
- (Wind howls quietly)
- (Door closes)

1340
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,720
How much repression they endure.

1341
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,920
That's the art of sound.

1342
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:21,200
That ability to interpret expressively
things that are happening.

1343
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:26,560
The final element
of the soundtrack is music.

1344
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,120
It has a direct connection to emotion.

1345
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,480
(Rousing music)

1346
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,840
The great thing
about music is

1347
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:45,120
it's there that you, as an audience,
can connect on a human level.

1348
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,760
It has a way of inviting you in.

1349
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,920
The way in which he records them,
the way in which they're executed

1350
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,480
is extremely lavish and epic really.

1351
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,280
(Music grows louder)

1352
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,640
(Richard King)
I love that Hans doesn't give up,

1353
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:17,120
and he just keeps trying to make it
better and better. He's obsessed.

1354
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,240
Looks who's here.

1355
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:23,440
(Hans Zimmer) I think the heart has to
come first and then the intellect follows.

1356
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,720
Hey, guys.

1357
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,560
- Daddy.
- Hey, how are you?

1358
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:37,960
Your job is to come up
with the unimaginable for them.

1359
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,040
(Explosion)

1360
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,840
(Dramatic music)

1361
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,640
You think about people's
favourite movie moments

1362
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,480
and it's usually a score element.

1363
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,360
(Shuri gauntlets firing)

1364
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,440
"Black Panther" was set in Africa,

1365
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,080
and music is so important
in setting that up.

1366
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:05,160
So my composer,
he was the first person I called.

1367
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,320
When I write music
for any of his projects,

1368
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,680
I'm always pushing myself
to another kind of level.

1369
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,440
Music is what ties
the whole thing together.

1370
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,440
(Rhythmic music)

1371
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,080
Experimenting in contemporary music...

1372
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,480
...but also not being scared

1373
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,560
to bring in the classic,
really heroic theme.

1374
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,080
(Dramatic music)

1375
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,960
And how do we tie that together
in one consistent piece of music?

1376
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:43,960
We're going to write something new,
create something completely different.

1377
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,480
Then we watched it
and it was like, "This is perfect."

1378
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,760
(Rhythmic music)

1379
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,160
(Dramatic music)

1380
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,040
And a song can do in three minutes

1381
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,440
what a really great movie
needs hours to do.

1382
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,760
(Teri E. Dorman) It's the collaborative
effort of all those people...

1383
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,080
...that make that soundtrack what it is.

1384
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:24,360
And the very last step is to provide
that to the sound mixing stage.

1385
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,840
Re-recording mixing
is a key component of film sound.

1386
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,120
You take all the elements
from the sound editors

1387
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:39,440
and you finally bring them together
like a conductor would.

1388
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,840
You may turn up the music
to enhance the emotion.

1389
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,560
(Gentle music)

1390
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,280
(Gary Rydstrom) You may turn up the
sound effects to add a visceral punch.

1391
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,680
(Gunshots)

1392
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,760
Or you may turn them both down
to focus on a line of dialogue.

1393
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,000
I'm glad it's you...

1394
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,040
(Heavy rain)

1395
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:25,320
Mixing also involves thinking about
where sounds are placed on the screen

1396
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,360
and how they move.

1397
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,480
(Skip Livesay) We used this panning
technique everywhere in "Roma".

1398
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,960
Like what components could go
from that side to that side,

1399
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,000
left, centre, right.

1400
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,680
(Indistinct chatter)

1401
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:44,040
Have the voices move that way
when the camera pans that way.

1402
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:53,000
Alfonso was constantly trying to get us
to keep things moving.

1403
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,200
(Indistinct chatter)

1404
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,480
"Roma" is filled with a lot of
foreground/background sounds.

1405
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,680
The film is very aural.

1406
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,640
There are a lot of sounds going on.

1407
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:06,920
(Indistinct chatter)

1408
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,760
The dance between the elements
is what I consider cinematic.

1409
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,560
This is what the core of mixing is -

1410
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:30,640
taking all these components,
creating a place for them all.

1411
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,360
(Horse neighs)

1412
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,800
(Anna Behlmer) So it's just really
building the tracks slowly...

1413
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,200
(Swords clanging)

1414
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,440
...having everything play
harmoniously.

1415
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,280
(Shouting)

1416
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,920
At one point you go, "OK, we got
a movie. "Sounds like a movie."

1417
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,440
(Yelling)

1418
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:57,280
(Swords clattering)

1419
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:04,480
When you feel those goosebumps
then you've done it right.

1420
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,720
(Gentle music)

1421
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:14,880
(Teri E. Dorman) The circle of talent
is a collaborative group of people

1422
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,320
that spend hours and hours
and days and days in the trenches

1423
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,040
that are doing all the work.

1424
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:26,000
And if people have to try
and find meaning in what they do,

1425
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,760
it's the group of people
that you're working with.

1426
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,720
(Ben Burtt)
But it's easy to lose sight of that.

1427
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,600
Because I had public success
so quickly in my career,

1428
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,160
you come to work every day
thinking you're an Oscar-winning genius.

1429
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,880
Thank you very much.

1430
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,480
But you can't put that
kind of pressure on yourself,

1431
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,360
that each time you do something
it's going to shake the world.

1432
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,080
And it led to
a nervous breakdown.

1433
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,200
It finally came one day.
I couldn't work anymore.

1434
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,400
I was just sitting at the console
crying to myself.

1435
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,800
Didn't know why. It was because
I had invested too much in it.

1436
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,480
(Gentle piano music)

1437
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,360
One of the main things
I would always try to do

1438
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,160
was get home for dinner
with my family.

1439
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,760
I have to appreciate my wife, Peggy,
on all the years,

1440
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:22,640
she's dragged me back
out of my world of make-believe.

1441
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:29,080
Don't lose your foot.
Plant it in something outside.

1442
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,640
Those are good things.

1443
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,040
You get to the point
where you realise

1444
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,720
that you want to be happy
doing the work you're doing.

1445
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,280
The pleasure is on...
what happens on a daily basis.

1446
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,840
You come on any given Tuesday

1447
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,760
and you're working with making
pass-bys out of bicycle rattling.

1448
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:59,560
If you can enjoy that and see that
for what it is for a daily task,

1449
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,280
then that's where
the pleasure will lie.

1450
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:09,120
(Bobbi Banks) I love what I do.
It's very tedious.

1451
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,280
It's very time-consuming.

1452
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:16,800
But when I can play something back
and I can feel it, I was like, "Oh, man."

1453
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,360
You know, it's just...
it's really satisfying.

1454
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:24,160
(Pat Jackson) I just couldn't believe
I was getting paid real money

1455
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,800
to have so much fun.

1456
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,160
(Laughs)

1457
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,400
I always say
I would hate to have a real job.

1458
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,960
Pinch myself every day.

1459
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,920
(Gary Rydstrom)
Even in my early sound career,

1460
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,800
I remember how magical it felt to me.

1461
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,640
Movies were a place to have emotion
that was safe.

1462
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,160
Of all the ways,
all the things I can do in movies

1463
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,760
or have done in movies,
sound is still the best way

1464
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,560
to experience emotion
working on a movie to me.

1465
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:00,800
(Walter Murch) So the creation of
the sound film made sound an art form.

1466
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,560
(Helicopter whirring)

1467
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,920
It's been very valuable

1468
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,760
in the evolution
of human’s relationship

1469
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,880
to the cosmos.

1470
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:18,600
The work you all do
make massive contributions

1471
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,600
to the telling of the story.

1472
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,720
(Makes sound)

1473
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,920
And I love all your cleverness
and ingenuity,

1474
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,120
and I love the sense of fun.

1475
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,240
(Scraping and creaking)

1476

(Lightsabre swishing)

1477
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,760
It makes these moments eternal.

1478
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,400
(Tarzan howling)

1479
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,400
You know how to whistle,
don't you, Steve?

1480
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:39,680
(Whistles)

1481
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,000

1482

(Yelps then sighs)

1488
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:05,360
I'll be right here.

1489
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,320
Run, Forrest, run!

1490
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:11,680
(Swords clatter)

1491
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,840
Hold on!

1492
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,200
