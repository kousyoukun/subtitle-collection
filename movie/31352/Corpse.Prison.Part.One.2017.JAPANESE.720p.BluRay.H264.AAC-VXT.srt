00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:24,444
Corpse Prison:
Part One

3
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,134
I'm not feeling well.

4
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,603
Are we there yet?

5
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,772
We're almost there.

6
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,641
I'm thirsty.

7
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,843
Stop at a convenience store.

8
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,378
Stop complaining.

9
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,580
Or get out of the van and walk home.

10
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,448
Whatever.

11
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,348
Come on, Sagiri.

12
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,018
You only came to pass this class.

13
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,686
Like you're any different.

14
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,356
Is that all you guys care about?

15
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,592
Mere participation won't do.

16
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,861
What? What do you mean?

17
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,796
This isn't a field trip.

18
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,632
You'll submit a field work report.

19
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,168
A good one, if you'd like to pass.

20
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,671
No. Now you're telling us this?

21
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,640
You were sleeping the whole way here.

22
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,109
Shut up.

23
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,410
Oh, well.

24
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,648
You're going to write my report, too.

25
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,284
What? But...

26
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,886
Got a problem with that?

27
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,922
No. I'll do it.

28
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,663
This road isn't on the map. Will we be okay?

29
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,465
Well...

30
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,036
I'm not sure.

31
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,171
What?

32
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,008
But I know we're on the right road.

33
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:39,246
It's the only road that leads us to Yasaka Village.

34
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,783
That's quite bizarre anyway.

35
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,919
There's no reception around here.

36
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:51,458
Keeping the village inaccessible
must have been crucial in olden times.

37
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,927
To keep out bandits.

38
00:04:55,862 --> 00:05:00,567
We might come across some
unthinkable village customs here,

39
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,303
a village cut off from the outside world.

40
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:09,976
Damn.

41
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,286
Sorry.

42
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,421
We're not okay.

43
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,074
You're not pushing, are you?

44
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,676
No, you're not pushing.

45
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,011
Are you all right, Sayori?

46
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,583
Sayoﬁ?

47
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:51,551
Professor.

48
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,387
Are you okay?

49
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,089
I'm fine.

50
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,263
Let's rest a bit.

51
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:04,931
Yes.

52
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,134
Just great.

53
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,237
It's getting dark.

54
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:12,272
Spend the night in the van?

55
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,673
Not a chance.

56
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,942
We'll freeze to death without the heater.

57
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,611
I want to go home.

58
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,451
Over here. Please stop.

59
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,053
Thank God.

60
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,859
The chief sent us to look for you.

61
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,928
Luckily we had gasoline with us.

62
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,796
You saved us.

63
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,933
Not one gas station once we got off the main road.

64
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,936
We thought that you were attacked by a bear.

65
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,906
You were out of luck.

66
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,442
The chief's house isn't far. You're almost there.

67
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,645
Thank you very much.

68
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:55,482
Well well, look at these hotties.

69
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,184
The villagers will jump for joy.

70
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,353
What a blessing.

71
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,424
Creepy.

72
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,193
Don't worry. They're not talking about you.

73
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,797
I'm Amano, the village chief.

74
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,035
It must have been a long trip for you.

75
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,271
I'm Ashihara of Hirasaka University.

76
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,009
Thank you for allowing us to
hold our seminar field work here.

77
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,314
I'm Assistant Kagosaka. Pleased to meet you.

78
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,350
And these are the students.

79
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,018
Pleased to meet you.

80
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,087
Pleased to meet you.

81
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:39,259
Your rooms are upstairs.
Please make yourselves at home.

82
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:45,065
Although we won't be able to help you
since we don't have a maid.

83
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,534
Where is your wife?

84
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,905
She's been bedridden for many years now.

85
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,442
Forgive me for my impertinence.

86
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,609
That's all right.

87
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,780
This is my son, Takahiko.

88
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,083
Pleasure to meet you.

89
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,418
Speak out loud.

90
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,024
He doesn't even have a girlfriend.

91
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,626
Say, Takahiko.

92
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,529
Look at all these wonderful ladies.

93
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,799
Why don't you hit on one of them?

94
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,167
Please, Father.

95
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,270
Come on. Which one is your type?

96
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,805
Stop it.

97
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,975
What is it with you?

98
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,679
Sorry, Father.

99
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,484
May I take a look at that over there?

100
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,457
It's a mask of Sarutahiko-no-kami.

101
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:50,930
According to legend, this village was founded by him.

102
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:58,104
He later gave this mask and control of
the village to our Amano Family.

103
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,842
Which generation village chief are you?

104
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,112
I'm the 41st generation.

105
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:12,285
I'd like Takahiko to take over,
but as you can see he's not ready.

106
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,487
Is it a Tengu?

107
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,557
Sarutahiko-no-kami.

108
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:22,028
He guided Ninigi-no-mikoto from heaven
to earth in Japanese Mythology.

109
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,963
Am I supposed to know this?

110
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,733
One hypothesis goes like this.

111
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:31,538
Sarutahiko-no-kami is the husband of
Amanouzume-no-mikoto of Amano-iwa-yado.

112
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,807
Very good.

113
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,043
I'll also show you the mask of Uzume later.

114
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,912
Thank you very much.

115
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,516
Chief. It's ready.

116
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:44,984
All right.

117
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:51,958
We shall now commence
the wedding ceremony of these ladies.

118
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,528
That was pretty intense.

119
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,831
I didn't get it at all.

120
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,069
Good work, everybody.

121
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,242
That was the Foot Amputation Ceremony.

122
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,309
Thank you.

123
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,547
Foot amputation?

124
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,082
Yes.

125
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:34,420
It's a ceremony to welcome women from the outer world.

126
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:40,660
Now they are brides of Yasaka Village.

127
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,630
Ceremony to welcome brides from outside?

128
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,367
I got to see such a rare event.

129
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,668
Thank you.

130
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,670
The pleasure is mine.

131
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,274
It looks like dinner is ready.

132
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,310
Please enjoy the evening.

133
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,989
I appreciate this, Professor.

134
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:10,890
No, no.

135
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,958
Thank you.

136
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,426
Thank you as well.

137
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,429
Takahiko. Why are you sitting there?

138
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,766
Take this and go talk to the girls.

139
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,406
Takahiko. Over here.

140
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,441
Pour my glass.

141
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,310
After he pours mine.

142
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:34,480
Ultimately, you prefer the young handsome guy, huh?

143
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,683
I think you guys are handsome too.

144
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:37,717
Really?

145
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,420
Takahiko. You're annoying. Go somewhere else.

146
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,088
Beat it.

147
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,790
That's mean.

148
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,958
Are you jealous?

149
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,194
Well, sort of.

150
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,228
Please.

151
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,665
Thanks, but I don't drink.

152
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,567
| see.

153
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,668
Sorry.

154
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,536
It's fine.

155
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,340
I can't watch him.

156
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,575
Professor.

157
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,347
Won't you teach him how to approach a girl?

158
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,015
I could never.

159
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,051
I'm actually clueless in that department myself.

160
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,887
I don't believe you.

161
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,858
You seduced all those cuties into joining your class.

162
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,027
No. That's not at all the case.

163
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:25,732
I swear to God that I've never
regarded them as sex objects.

164
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,469
Do you swear on Sarutahiko-no-kami?

165
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,205
Yes, I swear.

166
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:39,112
At any rate, we appreciate you coming.

167
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:44,784
We were worried whether
you'd really keep your promise or not.

168
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,156
I knew I could count on you.

169
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:54,160
Well, then. Let's drink up tonight.

170
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,328
Here.

171
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,604
What's wrong?

172
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,638
Nothing.

173
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,675
What was that ceremony about?

174
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,577
I don't know.

175
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,380
Let's ask the chief later.

176
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,015
I guess.

177
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,521
There's something strange about this village.

178
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,390
What meat is this anyway?

179
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,594
I don't know, but it's delicious.

180
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,234
What kind of meat is this?

181
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,737
Specialty of Yasaka Village, bear meat.

182
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:42,875
Sarutahiko and bears, the gods
of the mountain, were friends.

183
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,579
Bears of this village love the flesh of young women.

184
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,718
Don't scare me.

185
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,620
Eat, eat.

186
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,189
Thank you.

187
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,123
I have to use the bathroom.

188
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,059
Wait.

189
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,403
What is it? What is it?

190
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,042
lsuke. What are you doing?

191
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,084
Is that for Michiyo?

192
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,253
All right. Just go.

193
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,821
Yes.

194
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,965
That's lsuke who takes care of my bedridden wife.

195
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,634
He's a bit slow.

196
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,872
Why butcher a chicken at this hour?

197
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,074
I'm sorry I caused a scene.

198
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,077
Who could blame her? He looks like a monster.

199
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,113
lsuke is lsuke after all.

200
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,382
Let's get back to partying.

201
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,453
Excuse me.

202
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,624
I'm not feeling too well. I'll be in my room.

203
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,228
You must be tired from the long trip.

204
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,264
The bath is ready. Please enjoy.

205
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,599
Thank you very much.

206
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,042
TakagL

207
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:57,910
Yes?

208
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:03,583
You've got to be able to enjoy the vibe of this village,

209
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,885
if you wish to get any work done.

210
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,787
Sorry.

211
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,724
But it's not really about the vibe.

212
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,961
| feel something rather ominous.

213
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,597
Oh Takahiko, you're adorable.

214
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,398
How about me, then?

215
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,800
You're adorable, too.

216
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,237
There's no need to behave like those girls, but...

217
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:29,241
being able to might be crucial in studying folkloristics.

218
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,479
Yes.

219
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,149
Who is it?

220
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,819
lsuke.

221
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,958
I put towel here.

222
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,061
Thank you very much.

223
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,501
I'm sorry about earlier.

224
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,204
Me, okay.

225
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,492
Gosh, I'm pathetic.

226
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,232
Those girls have no idea what's going on?

227
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,436
I know.

228
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,471
We must do something.

229
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:22,148
I'm so wasted.

230
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:27,153
You were actually giving Takahiko the look weren't you?

231
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,623
He's so adorable.

232
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,925
I bet he's a virgin.

233
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,327
Let him fuck you.

234
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,664
It's time to show what Slut Sagiri is made of.

235
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:44,470
Still holding a grudge against me
over your loss in the beauty contest?

236
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,074
You just seduced the jury into voting for you.

237
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,976
Whatever.

238
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,513
Listen to the loser whine.

239
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,781
Shut up, Ugly.

240
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,685
Ah, I'm so bored.

241
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,859
You're working already?

242
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:11,163
No. Just making a note so I won't forget some things.

243
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,966
You're so serious.

244
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,435
Send me your notes when we return to Tokyo.

245
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,404
Okay.

246
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,740
Don't send her anything.

247
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,679
I'm the only one who gets your report.

248
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,683
We promised, remember?

249
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,117
Don't worry.

250
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:35,588
Nobody will ever find out.

251
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,461
What are you whispering about?

252
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,164
None of your business.

253
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:51,370
Girls. Take a bath and go to bed.

254
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,239
You're not at your own house.

255
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,608
Yes.

256
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:00,212
Also, I can smell plagiarism from a mile away.

257
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,948
So, copy others' work at your own risk.

258
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,984
Goodnight.

259
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,154
I bet she's a virgin.

260
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:13,292
You're clueless, you know that?

261
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:14,526
What?

262
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,363
Nothing.

263
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,386
You shouldn't be here.

264
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,755
Go back to your room.

265
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,725
Professor.

266
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:51,096
Why aren't there any women in this village?

267
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,266
So, you've noticed?

268
00:23:55,968 --> 00:24:01,006
According to documents, no girl has
ever been born in this village.

269
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,477
How could a village last like that?

270
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:11,717
That's actually the focus of this investigation.

271
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,822
Don't tell the students about this.

272
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:23,729
Why did you bring the girls here?

273
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,366
Even if it meant luring them with credits.

274
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:31,437
Field work is a great learning experience.

275
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:39,378
No scientific research has ever been
carried out in Yasaka Village.

276
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:46,819
Many renowned scientists were refused
entry into the village in the past.

277
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,196
How did you convince the village chief?

278
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,501
It seems like you see through everything.

279
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,108
You used the girls as a bargaining chip.

280
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,183
That's what the chief asked for.

281
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,521
He asked me to bring him young women.

282
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:27,960
In exchange for full support in the research.

283
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:33,465
He wanted to find a bride for his son.

284
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,469
I guess so.

285
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,905
But the deal isn't necessarily immoral.

286
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,542
| arranged for a man and woman to meet.

287
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,145
From there, they have free will.

288
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,482
They won't be eaten alive or anything.

289
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,155
It's certainly immoral.

290
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,426
It's extremely chauvinistic.

291
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,099
Is that why you brought me with you?

292
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,169
No, it's different with you.

293
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,941
You'd happily use women to pursue your studies.

294
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,011
That's exactly who you are.

295
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,088
Doni

296
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,129
I'm serious about us.

297
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,834
I'll tell my wife about you when the time is right.

298
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,136
It's okay.

299
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,271
Don't say anything.

300
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,552
Stop it.

301
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,590
They'll hear us.

302
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,192
That's what makes it exciting.

303
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,951
What are you peeping at?

304
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:49,001
Mitsuha. No more peeping, okay?

305
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,280
Yummy?

306
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,731
Mitsuha. Don't do such a vulgar thing.

307
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:44,590
Prof...

308
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,044
We did the Leg Amputation Ceremony.

309
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,380
Do we need to wait any longer?

310
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,848
Yes.

311
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,119
Wait until Takahiko finds himself his bride.

312
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,022
But you know how he is.

313
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,291
I don't think he's into girls.

314
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,827
Then, he would never choose his bride.

315
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,831
We could wait but I don't think the other guys could.

316
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,668
We've been without women for a long time now.

317
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:05,504
Yes. What are we going to do about that?

318
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:06,838
Silence.

319
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:12,544
Who invited those girls to this village?

320
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,681
Well, we know you did.

321
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:18,250
What if they catch us off guard and escape?

322
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,719
Make sure they don't.

323
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:25,657
At any rate, until he finds his bride...

324
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,428
you won't lay a finger on those girls.

325
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,535
Hina?

326
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,872
Sayoﬁ?

327
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,608
Where are you?

328
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:31,623
lsuke. Have you seen Hina and Sayori?

329
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,499
Help me.

330
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:18,937
What's going on?

331
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,607
You must be hungry from running like that.

332
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,476
Why don't you join us?

333
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,679
They're all...

334
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,982
They must be taking a bath.

335
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,284
See?

336
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,153
The temperature seems just right.

337
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,828
Young girls taste so fresh and delicious.

338
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:44,830
Certainly.

339
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,431
Essential for longevity.

340
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,134
That's absolutely right.

341
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:07,118
lsuke. Bring us some more meat.

342
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,119
Yes.

343
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,130
What's wrong?

344
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,636
Nothing.

345
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,772
I'm going to go wash my face.

346
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,091
You shouldn't.

347
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,699
We'll be back by sunset.

348
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,936
Please be very careful.

349
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,304
Careful?

350
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:09,140
There are bears in the mountain.

351
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,308
Really?

352
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,745
I'm just joking.

353
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,415
They should all be hibernating now.

354
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,686
We'll be careful.

355
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,844
Takahiko.

356
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,947
Have you decided?

357
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,451
You have no time to spare.

358
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,487
This isn't just about you.

359
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:59,791
It concerns this whole Village,
let alone the Amano Family.

360
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,826
I have...

361
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,063
Are you referring to Mitsuha?

362
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,367
The girl is cursed.

363
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:13,171
Once you get married, |'|| offer her to Sarutahiko.

364
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,708
I won't let you live idly any longer.

365
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,575
But...

366
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,077
Enough.

367
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,513
Just pick your bride.

368
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,619
God knows what the villagers might do
if you don't act swiftly.

369
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:46,871
I've always wanted to ask you something.

370
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,007
What is field work?

371
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,408
Just Google it, Idiot.

372
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,444
We have no reception, Ugly.

373
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,145
Tell me, Sayori.

374
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,081
It's a site investigation.

375
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:57,182
| see.

376
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:01,486
Why did you guys decide to study folkloristics?

377
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,389
I heard it was an easy course.

378
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,892
Which was apparently not true.

379
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,863
This hangover is killing me.

380
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:12,997
Me, too.

381
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,267
Are you OK, Hina?

382
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,871
I'm fine. Don't wait for me.

383
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,640
You need to write your report.

384
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,409
Just go.

385
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,877
Let's just go.

386
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,156
What is it between Sayori and you?

387
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,357
What do you mean?

388
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,327
Forget it.

389
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,996
Do you have any cigarettes?

390
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,001
You got any morning relief?

391
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,070
Of course I don't.

392
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,205
Hello. Did you get tired?

393
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,407
Come on, you girls are young.

394
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,110
Any convenience store around here?

395
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,546
There are plenty of them.

396
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:02,747
Really?

397
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,083
Are you mocking Yasaka Village?

398
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,319
It's hard to find a village without one.

399
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,556
I knew there would be one.

400
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,291
Could you take me there?

401
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,528
Sure. We were just about to go there.

402
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:17,862
All right.

403
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,299
Sayori.

404
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,602
We're going to go to the restroom.

405
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,861
Are we there yet?

406
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,397
We're almost there.

407
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:02,667
Is there really a convenience store?

408
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,204
What's a convenience store?

409
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:09,774
A place where there's everything.

410
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,443
Even girls?

411
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,779
Of course they even have girls.

412
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:17,882
What a wonderful place.

413
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:21,386
Yasaka Village is the closest place to heaven.

414
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,857
I don't like where this is going.

415
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:26,991
Me neither.

416
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,130
We've changed our minds.

417
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,836
Stop the car.

418
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:41,839
Stop it.

419
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,127
Are you okay?

420
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,295
Yes.

421
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:09,500
Just how far could the bathroom be?

422
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:15,940
Sayori.

423
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,476
Does Hina have something on you?

424
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,612
| feel awkward watching you two.

425
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:24,015
You don't have to listen to her.

426
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,184
She can't make you do something.

427
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,486
She's not forcing me.

428
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:33,624
I know she's using you to pass this class.

429
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,995
She's exploiting your timid nature.

430
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,029
Stop it.

431
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:40,331
Don't...

432
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,134
badmouth Hina.

433
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:45,903
Sorry.

434
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,974
Hina's my best friend.

435
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,148
Hello?

436
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,751
Anybody there?

437
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,991
We really shouldn't.

438
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:10,328
This place might be abandoned.

439
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,833
Hello? Anyone in there?

440
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,604
Hello?

441
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,475
Anybody there?

442
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,170
Hey, Professor.

443
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,676
Professor...

444
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,058
Professor.

445
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,796
Who are you people?

446
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,601
You're not from the village.

447
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,604
Where are you from?

448
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,707
We're university students from Tokyo.

449
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,212
This place is off-limits to strangers.

450
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,781
Yes.

451
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:44,956
But we've actually attended a ceremony last night,

452
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:48,459
which officially made us village members.

453
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:49,927
Ceremony?

454
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:51,696
Which...

455
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:52,864
Excuse me.

456
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,534
I'm their supervisor.

457
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:58,269
You are?

458
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,137
Yes.

459
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,007
I'm Ashihara of Hirasaka University.

460
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:06,978
I'm Kayano, the chief priest of this shrine.

461
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,516
What are you here for?

462
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:16,687
Village chief Amano gave me permission
to conduct an investigation.

463
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:20,391
We're learning various aspects of this village.

464
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,427
I wasn't informed of this.

465
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,530
| see.

466
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,367
I had no way of making arrangements in advance.

467
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:36,674
The Amano Family and this Uzume Shrine
have never got along very well.

468
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,813
It's absurd that the Uzume mask is
kept in the Amano Residence.

469
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:47,218
Please excuse my lack of knowledge.

470
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,924
So, what is this ceremony that you spoke of?

471
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:59,397
They called it the Foot Amputation Ceremony.

472
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:05,903
It's based on a ceremony held to
welcome brides from outside.

473
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,042
Wait...

474
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:14,579
Leave the village at once.

475
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,682
Otherwise misfortune will befall you.

476
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,322
No, No...

477
00:45:58,823 --> 00:45:59,857
Let go of me.

478
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,629
Stop it.

479
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,067
Stop it.

480
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,644
Don't worry.

481
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:21,512
The villagers won't know about this.

482
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:23,347
They still have three girls there.

483
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,717
That's enough for that scrawny son.

484
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:34,292
I haven't done anything,
but she looks like she's about to die.

485
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,027
This one is nice and lively.

486
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,443
You little...

487
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:35,953
Help...

488
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,324
Run.

489
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:46,831
Hina.

490
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,432
Gmup

491
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:49,734
Stop.

492
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:53,037
Stop it.

493
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:55,206
Get off.

494
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:01,879
Tagishi.

495
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:04,048
Hold her legs.

496
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,419
We need to do it like the ceremony.

497
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,988
Better not kill the girl this time.

498
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,958
Stop. I'm sorry.

499
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:15,459
Sorry. Help me.

500
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,894
Too late now.

501
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,200
What the...?

502
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:29,800
Hina.

503
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,077
You're going to kill me?

504
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,590
You're...

505
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,227
Run.

506
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:04,668
This village... bad.

507
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,105
You saved me?

508
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:11,208
Go. Now.

509
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,416
Hurry.

510
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,053
What about the others?

511
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:26,624
Will they be raped too?

512
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,030
Then, I can't run away alone.

513
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:36,367
Take me back to the house.

514
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,702
I need to warn everyone.

515
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:42,006
Hurry up!

516
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:44,234
Where am I?

517
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,245
We need to tell the chief.

518
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:07,825
Wait.

519
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:12,963
Don't look.

520
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,165
Sorry.

521
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,889
Thank you.

522
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:41,659
Let's hurry.

523
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:42,926
Yes.

524
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,198
Name.

525
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:51,769
My name?

526
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:54,138
I haven't told you?

527
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,707
Sagiri Yoshioka.

528
00:52:58,142 --> 00:52:59,610
Sagiri.

529
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,881
And you're lppei?

530
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:07,317
No. lsuke.

531
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,587
That's right.

532
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:12,856
Nice to meet you, lsuke.

533
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,894
lsuke.

534
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:21,732
Thanks for saving me, but that was a bit too extreme.

535
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:24,968
Please don't kill anymore.

536
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:28,605
Promise me.

537
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,341
All right.

538
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,179
I promise you.

539
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,658
You don't know who did it?

540
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:51,995
You saw Tsuyama get murdered, right?

541
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:55,099
He had an Uzume mask on.

542
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:57,167
He could be an outsider.

543
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:01,872
I think you two got in a fight over the girls.

544
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:04,641
That's not it. We took them to the shed.

545
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:08,645
They were trying to escape from the village.

546
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,881
Bullshit.

547
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:16,086
You two practically killed the girl who came last summer.

548
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,922
That wasn't my fault.

549
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,126
Chief. Please believe me.

550
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:25,562
I did it for the village.

551
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,232
I could care less.

552
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:33,070
This discussion is meaningless.

553
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,607
The girls are alive.

554
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,477
Hurry up and go find them.

555
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:44,448
The villagers are looking for them in the forest.

556
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:49,453
Nobody could get out of the forest without a guide.

557
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:53,891
We've closed the village exit. They're completely trapped.

558
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:58,195
All right. Don't kill them.

559
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:03,901
Don't forget that they're also Takahiko's bride candidates.

560
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:19,716
That's Sarutahiko-no-kami.

561
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,955
Who is she? Is that you?

562
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:28,058
| see.

563
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:31,395
Mitsuha.

564
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:34,198
Would you like to leave this attic?

565
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:40,304
But I might not be able to return here for a long time.

566
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,833
We'd better find them before sunset
or else we're finished.

567
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,569
No different for the girls.

568
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,839
Maybe the bears are eating them now.

569
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,877
Idiot. We can't let bears take those precious girls from us.

570
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,089
Let's go.

571
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:30,113
Why am | getting no reception?

572
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:37,054
Come rescue me, Sayori.

573
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:42,025
You said you'd die for me.

574
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,427
Damn it.

575
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:47,331
Help me, Sayori.

576
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:48,665
Sayori...

577
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,234
Over here.

578
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:54,571
There she is.

579
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,432
ATengu...

580
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:31,601
God?

581
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,843
Help me, God.

582
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,727
I hope Hina and Sagiri are okay.

583
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:34,564
They're with the villagers, right?

584
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,667
They must be drinking like crazy.

585
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:44,674
I got a call from Tsuyama.

586
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:47,477
They're drinking together.

587
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,847
I knew it. Sorry for the trouble.

588
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,149
Not at all.

589
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,885
I'm sure it's the guys' idea.

590
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,088
I'll make Takahiko go get them later.

591
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,456
So don't worry.

592
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,691
Thank you very much.

593
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,663
Where's Dr. Ashihara?

594
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:10,033
He's doing some research.

595
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:14,604
He doesn't even eat once he gets in the mode.

596
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:45,936
Shut the door.

597
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,437
Now.

598
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:48,672
Yes.

599
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:53,810
What's wrong?

600
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:05,155
600 years ago, this village was secluded from the world.

601
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:10,493
There were very few baby girls, probably due to incest.

602
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:17,801
After repeated famines and epidemics,

603
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:22,205
the village ultimately lost all of its female population.

604
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:27,911
Then one day, a couple visited the village.

605
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,414
The villagers...

606
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:37,053
considered the couple as a gift
from their god, Sarutahiko-no-kami.

607
01:02:37,621 --> 01:02:42,392
They killed and ate the man, and raped the woman.

608
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:49,599
They cut off the foot of the woman,
and made her their comfort woman.

609
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:53,803
She gave birth to babies of many men in the village.

610
01:02:55,438 --> 01:03:00,710
Her leg was infested with maggots,
so she was called the "Maggot Lady."

611
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:04,848
That's horrible.

612
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,851
Incredibly enough...

613
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,688
the story doesn't end there.

614
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:18,762
They continued to do the same to
other women that visited the village.

615
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:25,535
Communization of these women became
a norm and a custom.

616
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:29,072
The babies born there were still all boys.

617
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:33,376
The villagers thought they were cursed
by past Maggot Ladies.

618
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,112
So, they built a shrine for her.

619
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:41,217
And worshipped her as Amanouzume,
who had a connection with Sarutahiko.

620
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:48,425
But the curse hasn't been broken,
and no baby girl has been born since.

621
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:55,231
So, this village had to continue to hunt women.

622
01:03:58,068 --> 01:04:01,404
It's just an old tale.

623
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,940
Of course it's just an old tale.

624
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,551
Where did you get that book?

625
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:19,356
I can't have you going through our things like that.

626
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,292
Deeply sorry.

627
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,731
Are you looking at this?

628
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:31,835
It seems like a bear showed up in the vicinity.

629
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:37,474
We're going hunting.

630
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:49,419
I need to talk to you two.

631
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:51,955
Please follow me.

632
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:55,525
Sure.

633
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,445
Get the girls out of here.

634
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:17,847
Got it?

635
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,496
Just go. Hurry.

636
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,497
Yes.

637
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:39,068
A woman has escaped.

638
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:42,572
She's on the loose!

639
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,275
Just get in.

640
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,611
I'll explain later.

641
01:05:50,747 --> 01:05:51,548
Hurry!

642
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:53,450
There they are.

643
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:17,774
No. You said you won't kill them.

644
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:20,276
Get in. Hurry.

645
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:21,544
Sagiri.

646
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:22,479
Why?

647
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,750
Me. lsuke.

648
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,219
It's okay. He's on our side.

649
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:30,854
Start the car.

650
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:04,954
What's women hunt?

651
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:08,157
It's a custom of this village.

652
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,794
| just can't believe that.

653
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:13,630
You're going to have to.

654
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:15,598
Hina and l were attacked.

655
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:16,866
Where's Hina?

656
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,167
Where is she?

657
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,802
I don't know.

658
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,772
She pushed me away and ran away.

659
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,275
No way.

660
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:29,045
Don't worry. She's indestructible.

661
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,046
I can't.

662
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:34,617
I can't live without Hina.

663
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:37,687
She's all I've got.

664
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:40,990
Hina's my everything.

665
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,632
I knew you guys were lovers.

666
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:07,317
Any news?

667
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:09,586
They haven't come, but they will soon.

668
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,555
This is the only way out from the village.

669
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:14,324
All right.

670
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,427
I'm heading that way. We'll trap them from both sides.

671
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:20,496
Make sure they don't get away.

672
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,355
We'll be fine.

673
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:49,058
The road ahead leads us out of the village.

674
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:51,260
Stop the car.

675
01:08:53,196 --> 01:08:54,097
Please, stop.

676
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:56,432
Are you out of your mind?

677
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,468
I can't leave without Hina.

678
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:00,103
I have to find her.

679
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:03,373
Please. Stop the car.

680
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:06,009
Hey, Sayori.

681
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:07,143
Calm down.

682
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,980
What's your problem?

683
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:13,416
I'm not your parent.

684
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:15,952
I could've escaped alone.

685
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:21,124
I'm only doing this because Dr. Ashihara told me to.

686
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,227
I'm doing this for him.

687
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,798
He's still in the house.

688
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,835
He might even be dead.

689
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:40,977
This isn't easy for any of us.

690
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:46,916
Stop.

691
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,886
Now you?

692
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,288
Exit... bad.

693
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:02,699
You're not going anywhere.

694
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,343
They read our plan.

695
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:49,579
They're cutting through the forest.

696
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:10,900
Fools!

697
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,969
You were outwitted by a bunch of girls.

698
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:14,537
Sorry, Chief.

699
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:19,375
If they escape and talk, this village is finished.

700
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:27,083
Once Takahiko picks his bride the rest will be yours.

701
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:32,855
For the sake of this village,
don't let any girl escape from here.
