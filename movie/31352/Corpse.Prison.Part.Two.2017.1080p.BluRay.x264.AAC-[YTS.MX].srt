Previously, on "corpse prison: Part 1"

00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:43,867
previously, on "corpse prison: Part 1"
hold her down!

6
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,870
Hold her down!

7
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,465
You bitch!

8
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:57,606
It must have been a long trip for you.
I'm amano, the village chief.

9
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,850
Thank you for allowing us
to hold our seminar field work here.

10
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,161
"Foot amputation"?

11
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:13,496
It's a ceremony to welcome
women from the outer world.

12
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:18,569
Now they are brides of yasaka village.

13
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,199
Takahiko. Over here.

14
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,504
Pour my glass.

15
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:25,604
We were worried whether
you'd really keep your promise or not.

16
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,647
What is it? What's going on?!

17
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,282
That's isuke, who takes
care of my bedridden wife.

18
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,154
He's a bit slow.

19
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,292
I put towel here.

20
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,419
Thank you very much.

21
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,923
Gosh, I'm pathetic.

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,062
Those girls have no idea what's going on?

23
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:54,470
I know. We must do something.

24
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,435
You used the girls as a bargaining chip.

25
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,709
That's what the chief asked for.

26
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,444
He asked me to bring him young women...

27
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:07,115
In exchange for full
support in the research.

28
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,812
He wanted to find a bride for his son.

29
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,790
Mitsuha, don't do such a vulgar thing.

30
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,661
It feels so good!

31
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,363
What if they catch us off guard and escape?

32
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,533
Make sure they don't.

33
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,101
At any rate, until he finds his bride...

34
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,506
You won't lay a finger on those girls.

35
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,473
No...

36
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,207
The girl is cursed.

37
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,677
Once you get married, I'll
offer her to sarutahiko.

38
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:37,781
But...

39
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,012
Enough!

40
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,083
Just pick your bride.

41
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:45,722
God knows what the villagers might do
if you don't act swiftly.

42
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,150
Any convenience stores around here?

43
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,659
There are plenty of them.

44
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,858
There are?

45
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,230
Could you take us there?

46
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,565
Sure. We were just about to go there.

47
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,831
All right.

48
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,032
Hello?

49
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,935
Anyone in there?

50
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:03,976
Professor...

51
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,772
Leave the village at once.

52
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,141
Otherwise, misfortune will befall you.

53
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,151
Stop it!

54
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,851
No!

55
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,324
Don't worry.

56
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,649
The villagers won't know about this.

57
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,287
They still have three girls there.

58
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,628
That's enough for that scrawny son.

59
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,060
Hold it!

60
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,184
No!

61
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,314
Hina!

62
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,724
Run.

63
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,222
This village... bad.

64
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,255
What about the others?

65
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,097
Will they be raped too?

66
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,224
Then, I can run away alone.

67
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,128
I need to warn everyone.

68
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,202
Where am 1?

69
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,634
Don't worry.

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,404
Nobody could get out of the
forest without a guide.

71
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,542
Please don't kill anymore. Promise me.

72
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13,946
Would you like to leave this attic?

73
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,049
But I might not be able to
return here for a long time.

74
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,543
Hey! Over here! Come on!

75
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,019
Help me, god.

76
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:43,474
Six hundred years ago,
this village was secluded from the world.

77
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:48,914
There were very few baby
girls, probably due to incest.

78
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:57,916
After repeated famines and epidemics, the village
ultimately lost all of its female population.

79
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:04,594
Then, one day a couple visited the village.

80
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,323
The villagers...

81
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:12,033
Considered the couple as a gift
from their god, sarutahikonokami.

82
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,967
They killed and ate the
man, and raped the woman.

83
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:24,750
They cut off the foot of the woman,
and made her their comfort woman.

84
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,779
She gave birth to babies of
many men in the village.

85
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,448
Her leg was infested with maggots,
so she was called the "maggot lady."

86
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:35,827
Maggot lady her leg was infested with
maggots, so she was called the "maggot lady."

87
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,406
Her leg was infested with maggots,
so she was called the "maggot lady."

88
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,991
They continued to do the same
to other women that visited the village.

89
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:45,603
Communization of these women
became a norm and a custom.

90
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,740
The babies born there were still all boys.

91
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,171
The villagers thought they
were cursed by past maggot ladies.

92
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,273
So, they built a shrine for her...

93
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:05,216
And worshipped her as amanouzume,
who had a connection with sarutahiko.

94
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:12,095
But the curse hasn't been broken,
and no baby girl has been born since.

95
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,162
So, this village had to
continue to hunt women.

96
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,799
It's just an old tale.

97
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,201
Of course it's just an old tale.

98
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,014
I need to talk to you two.

99
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,506
Please follow me.

100
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,111
Get the girls out of here.

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,348
Got it?

102
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,684
Just go! Hurry!

103
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,387
A woman has escaped!

104
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,792
Me. Isuke.

105
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,826
It's okay. He's on our side.

106
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,030
What's "women hunting"?

107
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,366
It's a custom of this village.

108
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:57,943
Any news?

109
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,478
They haven't come, but they will soon.

110
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,210
This is the only way out from the village.

111
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,610
I'm heading that way. We'll
trap them from both sides.

112
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:56,895
Corpse prison: Part 2

113
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,589
Sarutahikonokami... is gone.

114
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,804
Did you all do this?

115
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,800
Well... who's to say?

116
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:46,484
You know, Mr. chief... this village
is insane. You must know that.

117
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:57,154
I don't believe in god at all.
That's what got me interested in folklore.

118
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:05,096
What is the "god" that people hold in
their hearts? I wanted to find out.

119
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,370
Oh, there is a god.

120
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:20,883
It wasn't god that made this village.
It was the village that created god...

121
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,252
A blasphemous god.

122
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:34,760
What do you know? About any of it?

123
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:41,263
You have to break the curse

124
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,076
you don't understand nothing!

125
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,268
Mr. devil! Here I am!

126
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,041
La, la, la, la...

127
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,912
La, la, la, la...

128
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,542
La, la, la, la...

129
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,176
La, la, la, la...

130
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:31,882
La, la, la, la... la, la, la, la...

131
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:36,991
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...

132
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,085
Oh, jeez!

133
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:40,890
There, right there! Awesome!

134
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,321
You did it!

135
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,592
Good morning!

136
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,658
Good morning.

137
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,465
Come help us out, mikoto.

138
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,437
But, we have to hurry and get out of here.

139
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:57,842
We'll be fine. This is a secret place
only isuke knows about.

140
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,573
Secret... hideout.

141
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,240
Whoa, there's a big one! Isuke, over there!

142
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,689
You did it! Hey, what are you doing?! Jeez.

143
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,089
Ah, there it is!

144
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,524
It's boxed in! Get it!

145
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,385
Over there! Look, look!

146
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,261
Nice! Yes!

147
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,321
He hasn't come back since yesterday.

148
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,095
I see.

149
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:57,167
Apparently, he put on the uzume mask and
attacked some of the men in the village.

150
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,471
Oh...

151
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,368
You're making him do this, aren't you, mom?

152
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,875
Don't ask me...

153
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,419
Isuke is your older brother.

154
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:23,724
It's because of the way he is,
that I've kept it a secret.

155
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,363
I've always known.

156
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:35,336
I thought as much. That boy is...
He's kind at heart.

157
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,335
He can't live here in this village.

158
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,641
And neither can you. Right?

159
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:53,849
Take isuke with you and leave this place.

160
00:14:56,062 --> 00:15:00,192
I can't. If I could, then everyone
would have done so already.

161
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:07,371
You came from the outside,
so you don't understand.

162
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:14,103
The men of this village can't leave here.
They'll die imprisoned.

163
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:19,412
No one can escape uzume's curse.

164
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,785
Where are those girls?

165
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,151
The girls!

166
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,189
Where are they?

167
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,500
Here. For you.

168
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:41,973
Thank you.

169
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,887
It's delicious!

170
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,249
Did you catch all these yourself, isuke?

171
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,592
He didn't just catch them:
He got them by hand.

172
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:08,194
This is just the wild sort of boyfriend
I've always wanted!

173
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,225
"Boyfriend"?

174
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,468
I'm just kidding.

175
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,838
Wait, are you blushing?

176
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,103
Cut that out already.

177
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,872
This isn't the time for fooling around.
We need to hurry.

178
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:28,451
Not to worry. Isuke knows this mountain
like the back of his hand. Right?

179
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,588
Hand.

180
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,526
Hina...

181
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,379
Hina.

182
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:13,223
Hina! Hina, wait! Hina!

183
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,529
Wait up!

184
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,334
Hina!

185
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,437
Sayori?

186
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,139
The hell?

187
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,736
I don't know.

188
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,805
I'm gonna go look for her, so wait here.

189
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,478
Sayori!

190
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,446
Sayori!

191
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,385
Hina?

192
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,590
Hina!

193
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,417
C'mon, wait!

194
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,392
Hina! Hina!

195
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,704
Hina, wait!

196
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,907
Hina!

197
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,170
C'mon, wait, hina!

198
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,171
Hina, wait!

199
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,308
Sayori!

200
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,778
Sayori!

201
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,990
Hina?

202
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,158
Hina, where are you?

203
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,453
Hina!

204
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,564
Hina!

205
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,099
Hina!

206
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,044
Huh?

207
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:35,981
Hina...?

208
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,075
Hina.

209
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,485
Hina!

210
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,522
Hina!

211
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,354
Hina, hina!

212
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,627
No!

213
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,923
No, no!

214
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,328
No! Hina!

215
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,561
No!

216
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,703
Hina!

217
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,642
No, no!

218
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,543
No!

219
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,879
Sayori?

220
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:22,518
Hey, isuke. I told you to let us know
when you find the girls, didn't 1?!

221
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,956
Well, whatever. You did good.

222
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:32,603
Now, that's a girl... that's my girl!
Hey, isuke, help me carry her.

223
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:42,041
Stop it! Stop it! What's with you?!
That's my girl! My girl!

224
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,144
Isuke, no!

225
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,287
Hey, tagishi! What's going on?

226
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,417
Hurry up and get over here!

227
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,918
Hey! What is it?!

228
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,590
Over here! Hurry!

229
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,088
Don't let her get away! Get her!

230
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:07,666
Hey! Come on, get up! Come on!

231
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,038
No...

232
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,372
Come on! She's already dead.

233
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,376
Come on!

234
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,747
Hey. My knife...

235
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,774
Did you do this?

236
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,808
What's gotten into you?

237
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,596
Hina?

238
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,533
Hina, where are you?

239
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:46,936
Hina?

240
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:49,981
Hina?

241
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,878
I wonder where everyone went...

242
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,845
I think we should go look for them.

243
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,049
We have to stay here. Without
isuke, we'd only get lost.

244
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,361
But...

245
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,998
Don't you move!

246
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,538
You're not getting away!

247
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,534
Hina!

248
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,678
Hina, where are you?

249
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,949
Hina?

250
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,357
Oh, jeez. So this is where you've been.

251
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,262
I swear...

252
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,306
Say, do you remember this?

253
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,312
Huh?

254
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,514
It's a love letter from you,
from when we were in middle school.

255
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,391
"Hey, so..."

256
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:14,197
"You may hate me for writing this,
but I like you. I really like you."

257
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:14,822
Stop it!

258
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:22,240
"And not as a friend: I love you!
I'd do anything for you, even die."

259
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,869
Come on, stop.

260
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:36,881
"It doesn't matter if you don't like me
back. You don't have to do anything..."

261
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:41,453
"But I hope you'll always
let me be by your side."

262
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,989
I'm embarrassed.

263
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,128
Sayori.

264
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,997
We'll be together forever.

265
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,771
I'm so happy.

266
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,056
Chief! Please hurry and
choose the kid's wife.

267
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,591
I caught these two.
So whichever one is left should be my-!

268
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:53,963
And what happened to takahiko?

269
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:59,796
How the heck should I know?! But we
risked our lives to hunt these girls!

270
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:05,534
Our friends have been killed! So please hurry
up and choose! I can't take this anymore!

271
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,239
Stop acting like you're entitled!

272
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,437
But, chief!

273
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:29,466
I owe you for last night. By the way,
where is that professor right now?

274
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:39,400
The proud and noble tenno family
has no place for a harlot the likes of you.

275
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,741
Hey! Do whatever you like with this one.

276
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:46,980
All right! Take her to the uzume hut.

277
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,882
Still, of course it had to be the old one!

278
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,086
Quit complaining! This one'll do just fine.

279
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,084
If you don't want it, I'm all over that!

280
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,892
You're talkin' crazy. I'm
the one who caught her.

281
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,456
Like I'd let you bastards have her!

282
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,441
It's you who'll be takahiko's wife.

283
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:18,613
No!

284
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:23,577
Truth is, right from the start,
I reckoned you'd be a good fit.

285
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,117
So...

286
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:34,090
Please, look after takahiko.

287
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,723
Go on and take them clothes off, please.

288
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:10,961
You'll be the bride to my one and only son.
Havin' scars and whatnot on you just won't do.

289
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:17,000
No... no... no!

290
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,439
Do it now, please.

291
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,192
Take them pants off too.

292
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,286
You got one beautiful body.

293
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:19,888
Don't you worry. I won't do anything to ya.

294
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:28,266
When takahiko gets back, you
two will be consummatin'.

295
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:36,380
It don't matter how slow he is: When he sees
this body, he won't be able to contain himself.

296
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,281
No...l

297
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,175
Professor?!

298
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,984
The chief told you guys to get
rid of that thing, didn't he?

299
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:19,508
Professor! No! Professor! We've been busy
huntin' those girls. We'll bury the body later.

300
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,284
Professor!

301
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:22,989
Prof-

302
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,587
shut up, dammit!

303
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,688
No!

304
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,164
Let's go. C'mon.

305
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,060
Hey, help me!

306
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,594
You're gonna let us have a
turn with her too, right?

307
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,629
Okay, fine, just do something!

308
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,937
All right!

309
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,040
Off with these clothes!

310
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:53,682
Tits! And these tits are awesome!

311
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,718
No! Stop!

312
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,994
Stop!

313
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,526
Hey... help me.

314
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,262
They've got you trapped in here too, right?

315
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,726
Let's get out of here, together. Okay?

316
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,547
Help me...

317
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,150
Help me!

318
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:44,127
Ow! Ow, it hurts!

319
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,399
Ow! Ow...

320
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,333
Ow, ow, ow!

321
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:57,437
Just... fine, whatever. Just pull it out.

322
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,881
Do it, now!

323
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:07,189
Here goes. One, two, three... shit!

324
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:11,958
Ow... ow!

325
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:16,733
Ow... it hurts!

326
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:28,644
L... 1 think I'm done for.

327
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,177
Isuke... you look pretty
handsome right now.

328
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,089
No... no!

329
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:46,727
It's not... like this would even
be enough to kill me, right?

330
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,113
I guess I'm hungry.

331
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,042
That was fast.

332
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,844
Sa... giri!

333
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:22,837
I'm sorry...

334
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:33,253
Hey, tagishi! How many times
do you plan on bonin' her?! Jeez!

335
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,028
Shut up! This... this girl is mine!

336
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:45,995
Cut the crap already!
Girls belong to the whole village, dammit!

337
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,079
Hey, cut it out!

338
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,326
Isuke? Isuke!

339
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,670
Isuke! Calm down! Calm down, okay?

340
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:28,442
We... we're friends, right? We're friends!
I ain't done nothing wrong! Nothing!

341
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:32,815
The god who made this village
is the one to blame! Right?!

342
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:39,953
And... oh, yeah, I've got a girl in there!
I'll let you do her too!

343
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,450
Okay? And she's fine! She's got great tits!

344
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:20,357
So... what are you going to do now?

345
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,826
Kill... everyone.

346
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,641
Oh. Give it your all.

347
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:46,486
I'll be fine, so just hurry up and go.

348
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,360
Please.

349
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,474
Damn... I'm tired of tagishi bein'
the only one who gets to have fun.

350
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,643
I'm sure our time will come soon.

351
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:17,678
I can't wait no more! There should
be some other of them girls left.

352
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:22,450
The kid's already got his wife... the
first one who sees it, gets to please it.

353
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:27,431
A bear?

354
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,897
We're finally alone, huh?

355
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,004
Huh?

356
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,778
Of course, I understand.

357
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,797
Wait... isuke did that?

358
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:24,434
Yeah. Weren't no doubt, it was isuke!

359
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,404
He finally done gone wrong in the head!

360
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,639
Wait, what about takahiko? What happened
to takahiko?! Don't tell me that isuke-!

361
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,077
I'm right here.

362
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,315
Takahiko... where have you been?

363
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,385
Out walking.

364
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,494
Well, never mind. Come on in.

365
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,632
Your woman is waiting for you.

366
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:08,682
You all! Takahiko is about to take
his bride to bed for the first time.

367
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:12,880
Not isuke, not no one,
steps one foot in here!

368
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,828
I'm sure you're hungry.

369
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:26,303
Eat.

370
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:28,805
Sir.

371
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,343
Word is isuke's been out there
killin' the village people.

372
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,885
You best watch yourself.

373
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:48,558
Sir.

374
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:57,225
Even the girls. He's been out
there killin' the girls.

375
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:04,664
It wasn't isuke who killed those girls.

376
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,703
What're you talking about?

377
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:10,881
It's nothing...

378
00:44:15,553 --> 00:44:16,986
Whatever.

379
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:27,391
Your bride is safe and sound.
I chose the best one for you.

380
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,466
And I got things ready for
y'all's "first night."

381
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,328
So eat up and go spread some seed.

382
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,975
Anyway, eat already!

383
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:56,453
Fine. Wanna have a drink at least?

384
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,124
Thank you very much.

385
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,086
That's some good drinkin'.

386
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,197
Please.

387
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,757
What's gotten into you?

388
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:54,076
Father...

389
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:59,145
Let's put an end to this.

390
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,277
Please, don't.

391
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,588
Hurry up and get changed.

392
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,427
You're helping me?

393
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:47,165
Please go to uzume shrine.
There's a man there who's sure to help you.

394
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,447
Everyone will be guarding the front.
Go through the trees there out back.

395
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:00,984
Okay.

396
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:07,853
This won't count for much,
but take it for good luck.

397
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,752
Thank you.

398
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:11,961
Go on.

399
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,427
Mr. devil! Here I am!

400
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:18,935
Boo!

401
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,261
Go. Now.

402
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:22,867
But, that girl-

403
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,204
hurry up and get out of here!

404
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:32,981
But, why...?

405
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:38,714
I'm sorry, but... I can't.
I can't do it anymore.

406
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,254
So, you like her?

407
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,257
No!

408
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:43,987
But...

409
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:47,059
This is no good. You have to kill them all.

410
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,605
I am your only bride.

411
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:10,010
Wait! Wait!

412
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,721
Wait! Wait, wait up!

413
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,555
No! No! No!

414
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,498
You're my woman, you know.
You're going nowhere!

415
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:27,300
No! No! No!

416
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:02,999
Isuke?

417
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,650
Help me. Please!

418
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:32,286
She really ain't been here?

419
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:35,091
We saw a girl running this way, y'know.

420
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:41,466
This is sacred ground.
No outsiders may enter.

421
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:48,638
Well, fine. But even if you are the head priest, one
false move and who knows what the villagers will do.

422
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:57,576
Still, I mean... you're one of us, right?!

423
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,174
It's all right now.

424
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:29,552
Please.

425
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,783
It will help warm you up.

426
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:38,426
Thank you. I appreciate it.

427
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:49,200
I believe I warned you...
That you should leave this village.

428
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,101
I'm sorry...

429
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:58,273
But, what about the others?
Are they all right?

430
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,380
I have no way of knowing.

431
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,612
But...

432
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,118
In this village, women are
a precious commodity.

433
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,638
If they were captured, I'm
sure they're still alive.

434
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:12,953
Still...

435
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,055
A cloud of madness currently
hangs over the village.

436
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:20,014
Let's give thought to what to do next
once things have settled down.

437
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,570
Until then, I'd like you
to please remain here.

438
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:25,875
Okay.

439
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:43,259
Oh, yeah. That girl...

440
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,356
There was someone else in
that house, a little girl.

441
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:51,767
I'm sure that they've kept her trapped
there, and have done terrible things to her.

442
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:54,764
You've seen mitsuha?

443
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:02,008
Indeed, that girl is not of this village...

444
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:09,251
Ten years ago, a family got lost here
while out looking for wild edibles...

445
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,184
And they were attacked by a bear.

446
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:17,625
But the child escaped, and she survived.
That is mitsuha.

447
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:26,060
Women are considered a gift from
sarutahikonokami, and so mitsuha was taken in.

448
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:30,878
The thinking was that when she came of age,
she would become the son's bride.

449
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:40,315
She was the type who never spoke to anyone, yet
she opened up her heart to young takahiro.

450
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:46,688
I often watched them play hide-and-go-seek
in the forests surrounding this shrine...

451
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:55,363
And yet, since she arrived in our village,
that girl has not aged a single day.

452
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:59,902
It's as if she refuses to become an adult.

453
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:07,767
In truth, that girl is the same age as you.

454
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:16,284
Amano considered her to be cursed,
and locked her in his attic.

455
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:23,155
No... "Cursed"?

456
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:31,494
She is indeed cursed. And not just her:
This entire village is cursed.

457
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:39,936
Thus, I must save it. That is my calling.

458
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,450
What...?

459
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,299
You are a virgin, aren't you?

460
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,506
What is this...?

461
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:20,510
Don't worry... it's just to help you sleep.

462
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,583
God damn it!

463
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:05,924
Where are you? Where are you?
Where are you, woman?!

464
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:22,099
What the hell, boy? You'd
kill your own father?!

465
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:39,114
M..mom. Everyone... dead.

466
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:48,090
They are? Well done. You're a good boy.

467
00:58:54,931 --> 00:59:01,393
Reckon you must be tired.
You can have a rest now.

468
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:31,425
The village done got quiet.

469
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,451
La, la, la, la...

470
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:35,024
La, la, la, la...

471
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,831
La, la, la, la...

472
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,635
La, la, la, la...

473
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:46,170
La, la, la, la... la, la, la, la...

474
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:51,573
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...

475
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:57,245
La, la, la, la... la, la, la, la...

476
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:02,317
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...

477
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:40,896
A sacrifice is needed to quell the curse of
sarutahiko, or this calamity shall never end.

478
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:51,366
There's no need to be concerned; You can be
offered up to sarutahiko in uzume's stead.

479
01:01:52,842 --> 01:02:00,180
You shall be freed from this unclean world to ascend
to heaven and live with the gods for eternity.

480
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:05,652
Why... why me?

481
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:12,755
Because it must be a pure girl...
One who has remained unsullied.

482
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:21,465
I've waited so long for you.
This must truly be divine intervention.

483
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:30,305
I must hurry... a calamity is coming!

484
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:35,180
If I don't act soon, this village
will burn to the ground.

485
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:56,465
In the name of amaterasu omikami, she who
resides in the heavens within her rocky cavern,

486
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:07,010
today, amongst these endless calamities,

487
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:15,784
I present this pure maiden to her divinity
divine uzume not as a vessel but as an offering!

488
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:53,862
No... no, stop!

489
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:04,933
O dread lord sarutahiko, may the gift of this
pure maiden appease your fearsome vengeance!

490
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,989
What do you find amusing, mitsuha?

491
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:28,694
Well, I mean, it's too late.
Everyone's already dead.

492
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:29,932
What?

493
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:37,839
Also, sarutahiko says he doesn't need some woman
like that. He has me. Because, I'm uzume.

494
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,903
Right, sarutahiko?

495
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,359
Who are you?!

496
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,425
That's sarutahiko.

497
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:06,526
You would dare defile a sacred ceremony?!

498
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:10,070
You shouldn't do that to a god, you know.

499
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,501
It's time for hide-and-go-seek.

500
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:58,513
And sarutahiko is "it." He's really scary, you
know. He's already killed all your friends.

501
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,057
What are you talking about?

502
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:07,357
Hurry up and run. One...

503
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:14,461
Two... three... four...

504
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:22,471
Five... six... seven...
Eight... nine... ten.

505
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:17,654
Vzume-no-mikdtd

506
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:37,740
Takahiko?

507
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,211
It's you, isn't it?

508
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:50,514
So you... you killed everyone?

509
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:56,495
But you're so kind. You helped me.

510
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:04,796
Come on... answer me!

511
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:11,671
Answer me!

512
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:36,395
No, you're wrong... you're wrong!
It wasn't me! Y

513
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,266
what? What's "wrong" about it?!

514
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,103
Stay back. Stay back!

515
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,875
It was you, wasn't it? You
did this, didn't you?!

516
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:46,906
Stay back! Stay back!

517
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:48,845
It was you!

518
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,284
Stay back!

519
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:21,837
La, la, la, la... la, la, la, la...

How pretty.
