[男人]我们将把她整日待在家里，监视她的状况，
[man] We'll keep her in for the day, monitor her condition,

147
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:49,310
但是请相信我，如果一个五岁的孩子被响尾蛇咬伤……
but trust me, if a five-year-old was bitten by a rattlesnake

148
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:51,020
（笑）你会知道的
[chuckles] you'd know it

149
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:54,190
从外观上看，只是疲惫，轻度脱水
From the looks, it's just exhaustion, mild dehydration

150
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:57,526
你应该见过她的她正在燃烧，没有呼吸
You should've seen her She was burning up, she wasn't breathing

151
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,737
为了基督，她变成了蓝色
She turned blue, for Christ sakes

152
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:07,119
[医生]在开车过程中，您是否感觉完全不适？
[doctor] Were you feeling out of sorts at all during the drive?

153
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:08,162
[女人]没有
[woman] No

154
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:10,998
-[医生]服药？你拿什么吗-[女人]没事，没事
-[doctor] Medication? You taking anything? -[woman] Nothing, no

155
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:14,085
听着，凤凰城到俄克拉荷马州的旅程可能很长
Listen, Phoenix to Oklahoma can be a long haul

156
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:16,837
是的，我不是一个很好的飞行者，
Yeah, well, I'm not a very good flier,

157
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:18,881
所以开车是两种邪恶中的较小者
so driving was the lesser of two evils

158
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:20,883
[医生]你感觉
[doctor] Were you feeling, uh

159
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:22,885
这有必要吗？
Is this necessary?

160
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:24,387
令人担忧或
apprehensive or

161
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:26,973
开车前有压力吗？
stressed before the drive?

162
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:28,808
嗯
Uh

163
00:12:28,891 --> 00:12:31,060
不，是的，我想
No Uh, yes, I guess

164
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,313
太疯狂了嗯
It's been pretty crazy Um

165
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,316
我们从头开始，
We're starting over,

166
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,402
而克拉拉（Clara）的举动很多
and the move's been a lot on Clara

167
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:41,904
你是单身母亲吗？
You're a single mother?

168
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:44,490
是
Yes

169
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:49,287
[医生]稍微抬高不足为奇，但没有令人震惊
[doctor] Slightly elevated Not surprising, but nothing alarming

170
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,377
看，我知道这听起来很疯狂
Look, I know this sounds crazy

171
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,757
但是必须有某种解释
But there has to be some kind of explanation

172
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:03,843
我的意思是那个老女人，也许她有
I mean, that old woman, maybe she had

173
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:08,222
我不知道，就像她架子上的某种古老疗法一样
I don't know, like an ancient remedy on her shelf or something

174
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,599
我只是
I'm just

175
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:12,935
我只是告诉你发生了什么
I'm just telling you what happened

176
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,563
[医生]你女儿会没事的
[doctor] Your daughter's gonna be fine

177
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,064
她只需要休息
She just needs to rest

178
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:19,400
您需要做同样的事情
You need to do the same

179
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:21,819
去睡一会
Get some sleep

180
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:12,036
[男人]就是这样
[man] That's all it is

181
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:13,537
上帝的旨意
God's will

182
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,706
[sobs]我知道
[sobs] I know

183
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,959
[嗅]
[sniffles]

184
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:55,204
[小伙子]真是太小了
[man] Such a pretty little thing

185
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,582
认为我们差点失去了她
To think we almost lost her

186
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,378
你真幸运事情可能以截然不同的方式结束
You really are lucky Things could have ended much differently

187
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:04,672
你是？
You are?

188
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:07,716
我在这里谈论您的付款，里奇韦女士
I'm here to talk about your payment, Ms Ridgeway

189
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,634
哦
Oh

190
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:10,219
你为什么不拉椅子？
Why don't you pull up a chair?

191
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:13,305
所以，我和我女儿都有保险
So, we have insurance, my daughter and I, both

192
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,558
我们都被覆盖
We're both covered

193
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:17,893
哦，我不是在说你的医院债务
Oh, I'm not talking about your hospital debt

194
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,688
我说的是其他债务
I'm talking about the other debt

195
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,941
您现在欠的那个
The one you now owe

196
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:31,157
为你女儿做的事情并不便宜
What was done for your daughter doesn't come cheap

197
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:33,451
她的小灵魂得以幸免
Her little soul was spared

198
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:35,953
现在您欠一个
And now you owe one in return

199
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,371
[笑]
[laughs]

200
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,124
对不起，我以为你说了灵魂
I'm sorry, I thought you said soul

201
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,252
里奇韦女士，您没多久还清债务
Ms Ridgeway, you don't have long to pay your debt

202
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:46,422
您只有直到日落，这是
You only have until sunset, which is

203
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:48,799
现在只
now only

204
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,177
七个小时的路程
seven hours away

205
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,681
您所选择的灵魂可以是您选择的任何一个，
The soul you take can be any one of your choosing,

206
00:15:56,432 --> 00:15:57,808
但必须是人类
but it must be human

207
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:01,562
而且必须按时足额支付
And it must be paid in full and on time

208
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:10,613
好的我
Okay, I

209
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:13,324
不太了解发生了什么
don't really understand what's going on

210
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:15,993
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who you are

211
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,328
我想我叫安全性
I think I'm gonna call security

212
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,788
我希望你离开房间，让我的女儿独自一人
I would like you to leave the room, leave my daughter alone

213
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,752
里奇韦女士未能偿还债务，
Failure to meet your debt, Ms Ridgeway,

214
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:28,172
会导致您女儿的病情恢复原状
will result in your daughter's condition returning to what it was

215
00:16:29,215 --> 00:16:30,549
我希望你现在离开
I'd like you to leave now

216
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:35,846
让我提醒你那会是什么样子
Let me, uh, remind you of what that'd look like

217
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:39,391
[克拉拉呜呜声]
[Clara whimpers]

218
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:41,894
克拉拉克拉拉
Clara? Clara?

219
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,730
-Sweetie？她会受苦的
-Sweetie? -She will suffer

220
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:46,023
你对她做了什么？
What've you done to her?

221
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,526
在她屈服于蛇毒之前
before she succumbs to the snake venom

222
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:52,196
通过她的小身体工作
working its way through her tiny body

223
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,697
不，请停止
No, please, stop it

224
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,659
里奇韦女士，她会死的，我可以向你保证
She will die, Ms Ridgeway, that I can assure you

225
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:59,620
让它停下来！他妈的滚开！出去！
Make it stop! Fucking get out of here! Get out!

226
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:01,413
救命！现在有人来这里！
Help! Someone come in here, now!

227
00:17:01,497 --> 00:17:03,499
拜托，有人帮我！
Please, somebody help me!

228
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:05,042
[人]七个小时，里奇韦女士

快点，拜托！
Quick, please!

235
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:17,304
天啊！
Oh, God!

236
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,224
好吧，我需要你打电话
Okay, I need you to call--

237
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,476
-[女护士]这里有事吗？ -[警报停止]
-[female nurse] Did something happen here? -[alarm stops]

238

-Who do you want us to call? -Miss?

239
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,105
小姐？
Miss?

240
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:31,694
小姐？
Miss?

241
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,994
-[男护士]我应该给保安打个电话吗？ -不不不不！不，不要
-[male nurse] Should I call security? -No, no, no, no! No, don't

242
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:41,328
那就没有必要了
That won't be necessary

243
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:42,580
[女护士]你还好吗？
[female nurse] Are you okay?

244
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,458
[沉重地呼吸]

245
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,674

[woman] I've been up since before dawn, driving

246
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:56,510
也许我需要检查一下马路对面的汽车旅馆
Maybe I need to check into the motel across the road

247
00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:59,179
[女护士]可能是最好的
[female nurse] That's probably for the best

248
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:00,806
我们会为您照顾她的
We'll keep an eye on her for you

249
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:03,017
[女人]好的，我就跟她说再见
[woman] Okay, I'll just say goodbye to her

250
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:10,816
[温柔地]哦，天哪

[cries] I don't know what's going on, Clara

252
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:18,574
对不起亲爱的
I'm sorry, sweetie

253
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:21,076
疯了吧
This is insane

254
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:25,414
我只希望你一切都好
I just want you to be okay

255

00:40:51,008 --> 00:40:52,927
上那该死的卡车

424

上卡车！
Get in the truck!

425
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:56,764
我不是站在该死的街道上！

426

来吧进来！

[脚步逼近]

[man] Well, go on It ain't gonna bite you

434
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:12,149
轻巧，易于隐藏，
Lightweight, easily concealable,

435
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:15,111
但最重要的是:准确

通过齐平的弹匣最多可射击16发子弹
Shoots a maximum of 16 rounds through a flush-fitted magazine

437
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:21,450
我要给你一盒两盒
I'll do you two boxes for the price of one

438
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,663
你曾经，解雇其中之一，亲爱的？
You ever, uh, fire one of those, darlin'?

439
00:43:25,746 --> 00:43:26,664
我要买它
I'll take it

440
00:43:27,331 --> 00:43:28,165
好吧
All right

441
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:32,962
我只需要看你的执照你是得克萨斯州居民，我接受
I'm just gonna need to see your license You're a Texas resident, I take it

442
00:43:34,004 --> 00:43:34,880
没有
No

443
00:43:36,257 --> 00:43:40,886
好吧，恐怕我不能让你购买枪支
Well, I'm afraid I can't be letting you purchase a firearm

444

看
Look

在路上袭击

448
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:51,063
我觉得我需要保护
I feel like I need protection

449
00:43:51,147 --> 00:43:53,941
我不知道您能做什么，但也许您可以
And I don't know what you can do, but maybe you could just

450
00:43:54,275 --> 00:43:57,278
只是视而不见，或者我不
just turn a blind eye, or I don't

451
00:43:58,988 --> 00:43:59,947
[叹气]
[sighs]

452
00:44:00,698 --> 00:44:02,491
什么时候变得像这样？
When did it get to be like this?

453
00:44:02,575 --> 00:44:04,994
我们这个伟大国家的开阔道路是什么时候建成的
When did the open roads of this great country of ours

454
00:44:05,077 --> 00:44:07,204
恢复到这种野蛮？
revert to such savagery?

455
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,207
这是不对的，一点也不
It's not right, not one bit

456
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,793
你的小孩子呢
Where's your little one?

457
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,461
在医院
In the hospital

458

00:44:18,883 --> 00:44:21,427
抱歉，我不能帮您，但是
I'm sorry, I can't help you, but

460
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:23,721
这个男人可以

461
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:27,016
他叫查理住在图里亚
His name's Charlie Lives here in Tulia

462
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,559
你可以在这里找到他
You can find him here

463
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:31,562
这是一笔纯现金交易
It's a cash-only transaction

464
00:44:32,354 --> 00:44:34,690
我想你会称他为私人经销商
I guess you'd call him a private dealer

465
00:44:35,232 --> 00:44:39,028

469
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:15,022
你好伯爵，恩，送我了

他说他会为我担保
He said he'd vouch for me

471
00:45:17,274 --> 00:45:18,275
你是查理吗？

472
00:45:24,782 --> 00:45:26,075
[查理]丢掉帽子

[查理含糊地喃喃自语]

Okay, Katrina Ridgeway

475
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:09,618
我将不得不做快速身体检查
I'm gonna have to do a quick body check

476
00:46:11,453 --> 00:46:12,788
那真的有必要吗？

477
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:16,458
好的
Okay

[查理拍拍卡特里娜飓风的腿]
[Charlie patting Katrina's legs]

00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:39,773
-你要我给你弄点茶吗？ -不，谢谢
-You want me to fix you up some tea? -No, thank you

480
00:46:42,526 --> 00:46:44,153
更多喝咖啡的人，对吧？
More of a coffee drinker, huh?

481
00:46:45,279 --> 00:46:46,238
我猜
I guess

482
00:46:47,114 --> 00:46:50,492
我的妻子特雷西，她会把橱柜放进去
My wife, Tracy, she'd stock the cupboard

483
00:46:50,576 --> 00:46:53,412
充满了各种异国风味

484
00:46:53,996 --> 00:46:55,748
芙蓉是她的最爱

485
00:46:56,165 --> 00:46:58,292
-那么，我们可以--您确定不想尝试吗？
-So, can we-- -You sure you don't wanna try some?

486
00:46:58,375 --> 00:46:59,626
没关系
It's no trouble

487
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:00,794
我确定
I'm sure

488
00:47:00,878 --> 00:47:03,005
[口吃]我我得走了
[stammers] I I've gotta go

489
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:08,010
特雷西不再与我们同在
Tracy is no longer with us

490
00:47:15,976 --> 00:47:20,564
她拿了一桶格洛克，和你要买的那桶一样
She took the barrel of a Glock, identical to the one that you're buying

491
00:47:26,278 --> 00:47:28,113
放在嘴里
and put it in her mouth

492
00:47:29,198 --> 00:47:31,283
好的，我很抱歉
Okay, I am so sorry

493
00:47:32,076 --> 00:47:35,412
很遗憾得知您的妻子，但我得走了
so sorry to hear about your wife, but I've gotta get going

494
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:39,249
[咯咯笑]
[chuckles]

495
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,502
听我说
Listen to me, just

496
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:43,170
继续前进
rabbiting on

497
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:46,757
是的，她是她是你的
Yeah, she's She's all yours

498
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:48,550
嗯
Uh

499
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:51,970

00:47:52,054 --> 00:47:53,680
回合又是50回合
The rounds are another 50

501
00:47:55,682 --> 00:47:57,768
我我已经有40岁了
I think I've got 40

502
00:48:01,397 --> 00:48:04,900
我的意思是，我可以沙哑其他十个，但我得走了
I mean, I can rustle up the other ten, but I've gotta go

503
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:10,823
[叹气]我不会剥夺一个女人拿一块的
[sighs] I ain't gonna deprive a woman of carrying a piece

504
00:48:10,906 --> 00:48:13,283
现在，我将成为什么样的男人？
Now, what kind of a man would I be?

505
00:48:13,867 --> 00:48:15,536
我让那十个滑下来
I'll let the ten slide

506
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:18,288
谢谢谢谢
Thank you, thank you

507
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:23,419
您曾经处理过其中之一吗？
You ever handle one of them before?

508
00:48:25,754 --> 00:48:27,506
因为如果您需要一些指示
'Cause if you need some pointers

我免费提供
I offer that for free

不，我
No, I'm, uh

511
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:39,643
谁是of子的倒霉儿子？
Who's the unlucky son of a bitch?

512
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:40,686
什么？
What?

513
00:48:41,895 --> 00:48:42,896
他们知道了吗？
They got it coming?

514
00:48:44,273 --> 00:48:45,941
你结束某人
You out to end someone

515
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:48,068
我可以像平常一样在您的眼睛中看到它
I can see it in your eyes, plain as day

516
00:48:49,403 --> 00:48:51,572
所以，我想知道
So, I wanna know

517
00:48:52,406 --> 00:48:55,451

519
00:48:59,913 --> 00:49:01,457
他们得到了它

520
00:49:12,718 --> 00:49:14,720

Uh, I thought today, uh, one of the Glocks I've not demonstrated

or talked about, is the good old reliable Glock 19

523
00:49:22,978 --> 00:49:24,813
这是一本装满子弹的杂志，
It's a magazine full of bullets in it,

524
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:28,233
它在房间里也有一个
and it also has one in the chamber

525

我会尽快检查

[比利]所以，他什么也没说？
[Billy] So, he said nothing?

534
00:51:45,912 --> 00:51:48,290
[艾比]比利，我低着头，打发时间，
[Abbie] Billy, I kept my head down, clocked off,

拉屎毛巾都湿了
Shit The towels are all wet

但是威廉姆斯能够得分

她处在猛击范围内，她流淌

她有冒犯的念头

当然她没有想过要放在口袋里
