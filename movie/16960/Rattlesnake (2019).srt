1
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,882
B...

2
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,760
B...

3
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,304
Blue sky!

4
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,782
Sky.

5
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,035
S...

6
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,536
Clouds.

7
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,346
D...

8
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,477
D...

9
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Dog!

10
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,648
Dog? Where's the dog?

11
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,732
Over there.

12
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,816
Didn't you see it?

13
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,360
No.

14
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,112
What kind of dog was it?

15
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,030
Small dog.

16
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,574
Interesting.

17
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,786
E for...

18
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,830
elephant!

19
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,581
Elephant? Where?

20
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,208
Yeah. What, did you miss it?

21
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,254
Hey, sweetie. Don't pick at your scab.
Come on.

22
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,131
I was just checking.

23
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,465
Did you make that hole?

24
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,176
It was already like that.

25
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,094
It'll leave a scar.

26
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,473
I wouldn't even have a scab
if Lily Stevens didn't push me.

27
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,644
Lily Stevens wouldn't have pushed you
if you hadn't thrown chalk at her.

28
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,105
She was making faces at me.

29
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,932
We don't hurt people.

30
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,566
Not ever.

31
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,319
She deserved to be hurt.

32
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,198
No, she didn't.

33
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,283
Clara, no one deserves to be hurt,

34
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,367
no one.

35
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,910
Okay?

36
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,412
Come on.

37
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,918
All good?

38
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,001
Yeah.

39
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,891
<i>I got to meet TJ.
He's a nice, nice gentleman.</i>

40
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,294
<i>Please go in to TJ's
and get yourselves some waffles there.</i>

41
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,896
<i>So that is on the list,
and I'm gonna put it down as number two</i>

42
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,979
<i>because last...</i>

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,194
<i>We grow or we die.</i>

44
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,822
<i>So, we're unaware
that we use events as a trigger</i>

45
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,909
<i>to get home back to the patterns we know</i>

46
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>even if it's uncomfortable.</i>

47
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,913
<i>So, if you identify where you live,</i>

48
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,915
<i>emotionally, the patterns
that are limiting you,</i>

49
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,935
<i>the second piece is find the antidote.</i>

50
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,586
- Shit.
<i>- We all will face,</i>

51
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,380
<i>multiple times in our life,
extreme stress.</i>

52
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,757
<i>The difference in peoples' lives
is not what we face,</i>

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,676
<i>it's what we do with what we face.</i>

54
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,471
<i>Life gives us these events,
these, quote, "horrific events,"</i>

55
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,099
<i>because there's an area of our life
that has to grow.</i>

56
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,017
<i>You can take yourself from a place</i>

57
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,104
<i>where in the face
of absolute total tragedy,</i>

58
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,187
<i>you triumph...</i>

59
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,937
You've gotta be kidding me.

60
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,190
Oh, shit.

61
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,071
Mommy...

62
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,033
why did we stop?

63
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,377
Oh, great.

64
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,009
Ow!

65
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,308
Where are we, Mommy?

66
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,856
Somewhere, sweetie.

67
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,883
You know,
Poppy taught me how to change a tire.

68
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,552
One day I'll teach you.

69
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,727
In the meantime,
you should probably come over here and...

70
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,355
get a head start and pay attention.

71
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,567
Nah, that's boring.

72
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,279
Yeah, suit yourself.

73
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,824
Maybe you can help

74
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,867
by getting Mommy her coffee.

75
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,121
Come on.

76
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,629
- Mommy...
- Oh, God.

77
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,258
Oh, God.

78
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,844
When we get to Oklahoma, can we...

79
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,014
Clara?

80
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,350
Clara?

81
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,898
- Show me!
- Mommy, it bit me!

82
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,400
Let me see, Clara.

83
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,154
Oh, God.

84
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,530
Okay. It's okay, sweetie.

85
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,200
It's okay. It's okay.

86
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,753
Come on, come on.

87
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,048
Oh, it's okay. Clara? Clara?

88
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,717
Come on, baby.

89
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,594
Oh, sweetie.

90
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:05,942
Hold on, sweetie.

91
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,364
Hello?

92
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,450
Hello?

93
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,204
Is anybody home?

94
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,497
Hello?

95
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,212
Come on, stay with me, baby, okay?

96
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,922
Just stay with me, baby.

97
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,048
Stay with me.

98
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,383
Oh, God. Come on, come on.

99
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,472
I'm so sorry for barging in.

100
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,434
My little girl, she got bitten by a snake,

101
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,102
and I really need your help.

102
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,105
I got a flat tire,
and I can't get a signal.

103
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,608
She's really burning up.
I don't know what to do.

104
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,860
You're in luck, darlin'.

105
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,696
I've worked on many a bite out here.
Let me help her.

106
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,031
Oh, thank God.

107
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,951
- Oh, she's going blue. She's going blue!
- Here, let me.

108
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,327
Please help her!

109
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,915
What can you do?

110
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,416
The nearest town's Tulia.

111
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,377
You'll find a hospital there.

112
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,088
You best get that tire sorted out.

113
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,260
Come on, don't just stand there, honey.
Time's a-wasting.

114
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,429
We'll discuss payment later.

115
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,266
It's okay, sweetie.

116
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,839
Mommy's here.

117
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,922
Clara?

118
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,925
Clara.

119
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,098
Mommy...

120
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,620
Okay. Come on, sweetie.

121
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,247
<i>We'll keep her in
for the day, monitor her condition,</i>

122
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,291
but trust me, if a five-year-old
was bitten by a rattlesnake...

123
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,001
you'd know it.

124
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,171
From the looks, it's just exhaustion,
mild dehydration.

125
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,508
You should've seen her.
She was burning up, she wasn't breathing.

126
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,719
She turned blue, for Christ sakes.

127
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,120
Were you feeling
out of sorts at all during the drive?

128
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,184
No.

129
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,980
- Medication? You taking anything?
- Nothing, no.

130
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,066
Listen, Phoenix to Oklahoma
can be a long haul.

131
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,819
Yeah, well, I'm not a very good flier,

132
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,863
so driving was the lesser of two evils.

133
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,865
Were you feeling, uh...

134
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,867
Is this necessary?

135
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,368
...apprehensive or...

136
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,954
stressed before the drive?

137
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,789
Uh...

138
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,041
No. Uh, yes, I guess.

139
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,295
It's been pretty crazy. Um...

140
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,298
We're starting over,

141
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,383
and the move's been a lot on Clara.

142
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,886
You're a single mother?

143
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,637
Yes.

144
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,268
Slightly elevated.
Not surprising, but nothing alarming.

145
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,358
Look, I know this sounds crazy.

146
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,739
But there has to be
some kind of explanation.

147
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,824
I mean, that old woman, maybe she had...

148
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,204
I don't know, like an ancient remedy
on her shelf or something.

149
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,622
I'm just...

150
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,917
I'm just telling you what happened.

151
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,544
Your daughter's gonna be fine.

152
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,046
She just needs to rest.

153
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,381
You need to do the same.

154
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,801
Get some sleep.

155
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,017
That's all it is.

156
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
God's will.

157
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,688
I know.

158
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,185
Such a pretty little thing.

159
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,564
To think we almost lost her.

160
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,359
You really are lucky.
Things could have ended much differently.

161
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,694
You are?

162
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,698
I'm here to talk about your payment,
Ms. Ridgeway.

163
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,616
Oh.

164
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,200
Why don't you pull up a chair?

165
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,287
So, we have insurance,
my daughter and I, both.

166
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,539
We're both covered.

167
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,875
Oh, I'm not talking
about your hospital debt.

168
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,669
I'm talking about the other debt.

169
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,923
The one you now owe.

170
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,138
What was done for your daughter
doesn't come cheap.

171
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
Her little soul was spared.

172
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,935
And now you owe one in return.

173
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,105
I'm sorry, I thought you said soul.

174
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,233
Ms. Ridgeway, you don't have long
to pay your debt.

175
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,403
You only have until sunset, which is...

176
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,781
now only...

177
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,158
seven hours away.

178
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,663
The soul you take can be
any one of your choosing,

179
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,790
but it must be human.

180
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,543
And it must be paid in full and on time.

181
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,594
Okay, I...

182
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,305
don't really understand what's going on.

183
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,975
I don't know who you are.

184
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,338
I think I'm gonna call security.

185
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,770
I would like you to leave the room,
leave my daughter alone.

186
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,733
Failure to meet your debt, Ms. Ridgeway,

187
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,153
will result in your daughter's condition
returning to what it was.

188
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,531
I'd like you to leave now.

189
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,828
Let me, uh, remind you
of what that'd look like.

190
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,875
Clara? Clara?

191
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,712
- Sweetie?
- She will suffer...

192
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,005
What've you done to her?

193
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,507
...before she succumbs
to the snake venom...

194
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,177
working its way through her tiny body.

195
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,679
No, please, stop it.

196
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,640
She will die, Ms. Ridgeway,
that I can assure you.

197
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,601
Make it stop! Fucking get out of here!
Get out!

198
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,395
Help! Someone come in here, now!

199
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,480
Please, somebody help me!

200
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,024
Seven hours, Ms. Ridgeway.

201
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,694
You best get a move on.

202
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,320
Mommy...

203
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,783
I need help! In here!

204
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,243
Quick, please!

205
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,326
Oh, God!

206
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,205
Okay, I need you to call...

207
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,517
Did something happen here?

208
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,293
- Who do you want us to call?
- Miss?

209
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,252
Miss?

210
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,841
Miss?

211
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,975
- Should I call security?
- No, no, no, no! No, don't.

212
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,310
That won't be necessary.

213
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,561
Are you okay?

214
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,655
<i>I've been up since before dawn, driving.</i>

215
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,492
<i>Maybe I need to check into the motel
across the road.</i>

216
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,161
<i>That's probably for the best.</i>

217
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,788
<i>We'll keep an eye on her for you.</i>

218
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,998
<i>Okay, I'll just say goodbye to her.</i>

219
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,798
Oh, my God.

220
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,345
I don't know what's going on, Clara.

221
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,555
I'm sorry, sweetie.

222
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,058
This is insane.

223
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,395
I just want you to be okay.

224
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,857
<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

225
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,651
<i>Hello?</i>

226
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,030
<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

227
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,460
Great.

228
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,883
I'm fine!

229
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,428
I'm fine, I don't need any help!

230
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,727
She's gonna die, Katrina!

231
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,812
Only one way to save her!

232
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,189
Stay away from me.

233
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,441
There's nowhere to run!

234
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,443
You stay away from me!

235
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,673
Fuck off!

236
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,331
<i>This is the diner in Tulia, Texas</i>

237
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:22,752
<i>where 47-year-old lawyer Donald Covington

238

246
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,469
Thank you.

247
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,069
Hey, um...

248
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,404
I'm so sorry...

249
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,406
about before.

250
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,200
That...

251
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,326
that was so nosy of me.

252
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,996
I shouldn't have just been peering
into your room like that.

253
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,079
It's fine.

254
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,834
No, I just wanted to offer my condolences.

255
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,336
He's not gone yet.

256
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:20,383
Oh, no. Uh... Of course not.

257
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,724
- You wanna sit?
- Oh, sure, sure.

258
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,528
Such a...

259
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,697
Such a strange thing...

260
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,910
waiting for your daddy to die.

261
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,376
Um...

262
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,214
Anyway, I'm sorry. What brings you here?

263
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,175
Oh, uh...

264
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,304
my daughter, she got sunstroke.

265
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,306
We've been driving all day, and...

266
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,642
she's not feeling too well.

267
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,227
How's she doing?

268
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,978
She's fine. Um...

269
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,440
Doctor thinks she just needs some rest.

270
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,819
Um, I'm Loraine.

271
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,653
Susan.

272
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,534
Anyway, um, it was nice chatting with you.

273
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,578
I hope you and your little one
get out of here soon.

274
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:35,083
Well, uh,
actually she's out for the count right now

275
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,379
and I am going stir-crazy
in that silence all by myself.

276
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,048
So I was wondering
if maybe, uh, I could...

277
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,176
uh, keep you company.

278
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,262
With Daddy?

279
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,763
Mm-hmm.

280
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,978
Apparently, they can hear you.

281
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,537
The nurse described it kind of like a...

282
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,775
like a two-way mirror or...

283
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,280
Or was it a one-way mirror?

284
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,744
Either way, he won't be waking up.

285
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,959
But I'm still here, Daddy.

286
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,588
You okay, Susan?

287
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,389
He seems to be at peace.

288
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,226
Yeah.

289
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,441
Oh, shoot.

290
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,989
Hey, y'all here?

291
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,325
B-7.

292
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,951
No, it's at the, um...

293
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,203
All right, just wait there, I'm coming.

294
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,417
Leave it to my sister to get lost
in a hospital this small.

295
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,003
I gotta go grab 'em.

296
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,130
I should go get Clara.

297
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,050
- Thank you, Susan.
- Sure.

298
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,681
I have to do this, I have to do this.

299
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,475
I have to do this, I have to do this,

300
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,519
I have to do this, I have to do this.

301
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,393
Loraine...

302
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,186
who is this?

303
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,857
I was just using the, um, bathroom.

304
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,487
Frank?

305
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,721
Oh, f...

306
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,568
Jesus Christ, lady!

307
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,694
Are you all right?

308
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,741
- Wh... What the hell happened?
- Stay away from me.

309
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,702
What were you thinking?

310
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,996
I almost ended you!

311
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,959
Is everything okay?

312
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,878
Hey, you don't...
You don't look all right.

313
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,713
Look, you want me to call someone?

314
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,631
Let...

315
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,386
You fucking serious?

316
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,220
Hey!

317
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,892
Fucking bath salts, man.

What, you gonna put this down
to another roller derby injury, huh?

324
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,349
It's a heck of a sport you chose there.

325
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,310
Just give me a beer, Francine.

326

Please?

Definition of insanity

328
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,947
is doing the same thing
and expecting a different result.

329
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,950

00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,152
Let me stay, please, just a little while.

334
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,349
Get up off that stool, Abbie.

335
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,476
Billy, just let her finish her damn beer.

336
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,021
This don't concern you, Francine,
unless, of course, you want it to.

337
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,653
Can't have y'all getting into it here.

338
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,491
- Abbie...
- All right.

339
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,826
All right.

340
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,913
Let's go.

341
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,664
Hold up.

342
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,087
Apologize to Francine for coming in here
and making a scene,

343
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,963
upsetting this nice customer.

344
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,091
Go on.

345
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,014
Sorry.

346
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,727
Just get out of here, both of y'all.

347
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,106
Go on, get!

348
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,487
Place has gone to shit anyways.

349
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,614
Mm-hmm. Go on.

350
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,661
Go, get out!

351
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,271
Ain't they a pair?

352
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,999
They live near here?

353
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,127
Oh, yeah, Tulia's finest.

354
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,839
Only a matter of time
before she ends up in the obituaries.

355
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,551
Some people are just beyond help.

356
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,688
Get off...

357
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,573
Why you always gotta make a scene?

358
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,908
Get in that fucking truck.

359
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,660
Get in the truck!

360
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,745
I'm not standing here
in the goddamn street!

361
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,039
Come on. Get in!

362
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,915
In!

363
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,764
12 Amarosa. 12 Amarosa.

364
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,058
12 Amarosa.

365
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,294
Well, go on. It ain't gonna bite you.

366
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,131
Lightweight, easily concealable,

367
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,092
but most important: accurate.

368
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:18,387
Shoots a maximum of 16 rounds
through a flush-fitted magazine.

369
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,432
I'll do you two boxes
for the price of one.

370
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,644
You ever, uh, fire one of those, darlin'?

371
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,728
I'll take it.

372
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,313
All right.

373
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,943
I'm just gonna need to see your license.
You're a Texas resident, I take it.

374
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:34,986
No.

375
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:40,868
Well, I'm afraid I can't be letting you
purchase a firearm.

376
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,995
Residents of Texas only.

377
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,079
Look...

378
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,708
my daughter and I, we were, uh...

379
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,460
attacked on the road.

380
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,045
I feel like I need protection.

381
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,922
And I don't know what you can do,
but maybe you could just...

382
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,259
just turn a blind eye, or... I don't...

383
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,473
When did it get to be like this?

384
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,975
When did the open roads
of this great country of ours

385
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,186
revert to such savagery?

386
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,189
It's not right, not one bit.

387
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,775
Where's your little one?

388
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,443
In the hospital.

389
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,235
Jesus. What...?

390
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,408
I'm sorry, I can't help you, but...

391
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,702
this man can.

392
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,997
His name's Charlie. Lives here in Tulia.

393
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,540
You can find him here.

394
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,543
It's a cash-only transaction.

395
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,672
I guess you'd call him a private dealer.

396
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,498
<i>What you want?</i>

397
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:15,003
Hi. Earl, uh, sent me.

398
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,172
He said he'd vouch for me.

399
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,257
Are you Charlie?

400
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,056
<i>Lose the cap.</i>

401
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,263
Okay, Katrina Ridgeway.

402
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,600
I'm gonna have to do a quick body check.

403
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,770
Is that really necessary?

404
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,606
Okay.

405
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,755
- You want me to fix you up some tea?
- No, thank you.

406
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,134
More of a coffee drinker, huh?

407
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,260
I guess.

408
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,474
My wife, Tracy, she'd stock the cupboard

409
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,393
full of a whole variety of exotic flavors.

410
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,729
Hibiscus was her favorite.

411
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,273
- So, can we...
- You sure you don't wanna try some?

412
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,608
It's no trouble.

413
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,776
I'm sure.

414
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,986
I... I've gotta go.

415
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,991
Tracy is no longer with us.

416
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:20,546
She took the barrel of a Glock,
identical to the one that you're buying...

417
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,095
and put it in her mouth.

418
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,265
Okay, I am so sorry...

419
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:35,394
so sorry to hear about your wife,
but I've gotta get going.

420
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,483
Listen to me, just...

421
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,276
rabbiting on.

422
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,738
Yeah, she's... She's all yours.

423
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,573
Uh...

424
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,952
The piece, that is.

425
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,662
The rounds are another 50.

426
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,749
I... think I've got 40.

427
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,882
I mean, I can rustle up the other ten,
but I've gotta go.

428
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,804
I ain't gonna deprive a woman
of carrying a piece.

429
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,265
Now, what kind of a man would I be?

430
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,517
I'll let the ten slide.

431
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,270
Thank you, thank you.

432
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,400
You ever handle one of them before?

433
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,487
'Cause if you need some pointers...

434
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,533
I offer that for free.

435
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,371
No, I'm, uh...

436
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,625
Who's the unlucky son of a bitch?

437
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,708
What?

438
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:42,878
They got it coming?

439
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,923
You out to end someone.

440
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,050
I can see it in your eyes, plain as day.

441
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,553
So, I wanna know.

442
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:55,432
I wanna know, Katrina Ridgeway...

443
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,060
that you're sure...

444
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,438
that they got it coming.

445
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,701
<i>Hi, it's me again, Mr. Glock.</i>

446
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:19,247
<i>Uh, I thought today, uh, one of the Glocks
I've not demonstrated</i>

447
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,876
<i>or talked about,
is the good old reliable Glock 19.</i>

448
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,795
<i>It's a magazine full of bullets in it,</i>

449
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,215
<i>and it also has one in the chamber.</i>

450
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,217
<i>I'll quickly check that.</i>

451
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,796
So, what'd he say?

452
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,297
What do you mean?

453
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,841
What'd he say?

454
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,054
Nothing.

455
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,266
So, he said nothing?

456
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,271
Billy, I kept my head down, clocked off,

457
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,357
and got the fuck out of there, I swear.

458
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,194
Hmm.

459
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,074
If you say so.

460
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,580
Shit. The towels are all wet.

461
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,291
Oh, I put them in before work.
They're in the drier.

462
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,055
- I'll get 'em.
- You sure?

463
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,380
Can't have my girl drying off
with no wet towel.

464
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,407
Here.

465
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,658
We gotta leave at 7:00.

466
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,711
Okay.

467
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,258
We'll eat there?

468
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,341
Sure.

469
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,445
Hmm...

470
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,237
Come here.

471
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,882
You know...

472
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,804
You haven't finished your punishment yet.

473
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,266
I'm not feeling so good.

474
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,643
Maybe we can rain check?

475
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,311
Hmm...

476
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,899
You already made a fool of me once today.

477
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,155
Please...

478
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,700
Without order, what are we?

479
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,702
Okay. Okay.

480
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,037
What would we be?

481
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,499
Animals.

482
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,167
Animals.

483
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,587
You don't wanna be an animal.

484
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,216
No.

485
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,021
Half-hour should do it.

486
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,689
Come on.

487
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,001
I said come on!

488
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,691
<i>Good job by Hardy,</i>

489
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:22,045
<i>and then she tried to
avoid the kick of Williams,</i>

490
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,130
<i>but Williams was able to score.</i>

491
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,510
<i>Now, what these kicks do
is they allow Williams</i>

492
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,805
<i>to get in punching range
without Hardy stopping her jab.</i>

493
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,098
<i>She wants to kick.</i>

494
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:37,018
<i>She's in punching range, and she flows.</i>

495
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,462
<i>And Williams mixing up
the punches and kicks</i>

496
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,564
<i>while Hardy is punching wildly!</i>

497
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,525
<i>Eats a couple of stiff elbows.</i>

498
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,487
<i>Mid-point of what has been
a fantastic opening round.</i>

499
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,256
<i>She's vicious, coming out...</i>

500
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,949
<i>Speaking of vicious,</i>

501
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:54,035
<i>a vicious exchange here
between Williams and Hardy!</i>

502
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,958
<i>Hardy has not found her comfort zone.</i>

503
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,584
<i>She's had flashes of offense.</i>

504
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,963
<i>Certainly hasn't been in the pocket,
where she wants to be.</i>

505
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,715
<i>Williams' composure really impressive...</i>

506
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,720
The fuck you doing?
Get your stupid ass back up there!

507
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,222
What the fuck?

508
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,685
The fuck are you?

509
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,650
Take the keys.

510
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,281
- Slowly.
- Okay.

511
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,283
Nice and slow.

512
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,577
Okay, um...

513
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,662
Put the beer down.

514
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,707
- Okay, I'm putting it down.
- Okay.

515
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,417
Slowly.

516
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,711
- Okay.
- Beer's down.

517
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:48,006
Okay. Get on the floor.

518
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,089
You get down.

519
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,051
Okay. You stay there.
Don't move, okay?

520
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,635
Thank you.

521
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,763
Okay, get up. Get up.

522
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,765
- If you want the truck...
- Just get up!

523
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,059
I want you to tell me...

524
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,479
how to get to the garage.

525
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,522
Can we get to the garage from the house?

526
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,065
Mm-hmm.

527
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,442
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

528
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,651
Okay.

529
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,236
You're gonna show me.

530
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,661
Turn on the light.

531
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,044
Okay. Let's go, down.

532
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,604
We're going for a drive.

533
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,568
I want you to follow my directions.

534
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,071
I'm gonna take you somewhere.

535
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,449
Okay? You just listen to what I tell you.

536
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,118
So, get in the car.

537
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:00,953
Just get in.

538
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,741
Just... Just look ahead.

539
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,137
Hey, uh, left at the T-junction.

540
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,559
- Where are we going?
- Just make a left.

541
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,700
Pull over.

542
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,341
Kill the engine.

543
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,857
Toss the keys back here slowly.

544
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,201
Please...

545
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:47,954
Please...

546
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,748
Just tell me what you want.

547
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,210
I can get you money.

548
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,548
I can get you anything you want.
Please, just tell me.

549
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,344
Get out of the truck.

550
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,975
No. 'Cause if I do, you'll shoot me.

551
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,769
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Get out of the truck.

552
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,564
Why are you gonna kill me?

553
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,568
Just tell me
what I've done so I know, please.

554
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,029
Please don't kill me.

555
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,782
- Stop crying.
- Please.

556
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,535
- I don't wanna die!
- Stop... Stop crying.

557
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,662
I can't help it
because you're gonna kill me.

558
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,957
Look, I need you to hold yourself together

559
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,084
and get out of the fucking truck, okay?
You hear me?

560
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,713
Please, because, look, I know I've done
some fucked up things in this lifetime.

561
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,715
Okay, I know I have.

562
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,177
But please, if you tell me,
I can fix it, I promise.

563
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,580
Please, 'cause I don't wanna die!

564
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:48,473
Okay, listen to me, you piece of shit!
I just want your fucking truck.

565
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,542
No, no, no, no, no.

566
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,948
Oh, God!

567
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:16,018
Where are you, you piece of sh...

568
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,787
Well...

569
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,873
you gave it your best shot, Kat.

570
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:46,465
Stay there. That's good. Hold that.

571
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,094
Nice.

572
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,140
Please.

573
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,270
There has to be another way
to put this right.

574
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,647
She's just a child.

575
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,608
Please, there has to be...

576
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,610
some other way.

577
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:07,778
Sorry, Kat.

578
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,282
You know what you gotta do.

579
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,916
Promise me...

580
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,669
she'll be all right.

581
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,465
You promise me...

582
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,094
if I do this...

583
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,722
it'll be over...

584
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,767
and you'll leave her alone.

585
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:24,814
Fair's fair.

586
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,097
<i>Clara...</i>

587
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:04,311
<i>I want you to know
that I love you so, so, so much...</i>

588
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:07,106
<i>from the bottom of my heart.</i>

589
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,068
<i>And...</i>

590
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:15,614
<i>none of this is gonna makes sense
because it doesn't make any sense.</i>

591
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,997
<i>But I want you to know
that I didn't want to leave you.</i>

592
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,547
<i>And I had to do... I had to do...</i>

593
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,718
<i>I had to do what I had to do
to keep you safe.</i>

594
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,350
<i>I want you to remember me.</i>

595
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,938
<i>And keep me close to your heart</i>

596
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:49,940
<i>as best as you can.</i>

597
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:54,361
<i>And, uh, don't let me fade.</i>

598
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,159
<i>I love you so much.</i>

599
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,870
<i>I love you so, so, so much, sweetie.</i>

600
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,467
<i>Mommy.</i>

601
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,184
Come on, you crazy bitch!

602
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,229
Give me them fucking keys.

603
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,566
Now what, huh?

604
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,651
You wanna fucking play?

605
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:18,820
The fuck you doing?

606
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,325
What the fuck?

607
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:08,889
Please, no.

608
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,688
Please...

609
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,482
Please, just stop...

610
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,527
Why are you doing this?

611
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:24,405
Please stop. Please...

612
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,617
Please... Please...

613
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,497
Please stop.

614
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,251
Please!

615
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,132
Why?

616
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:45,592
Why are you doing this?

617
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:48,512
Why?

618
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,597
Shh.

619
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:51,682
It's all right.

620
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:53,892
It'll all be over soon.

621
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,104
You're crazy, you fucking bitch.

622
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:01,734
You're gonna burn in hell for this.

623
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:05,279
You're gonna fucking burn,
you fucking bitch.

624
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,325
You're gonna burn in hell for this!
You'll burn!

625
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,660
We'll see.

626
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:41,453
Hello?

627
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,788
<i>Hello, Ms. Ridgeway?</i>

628
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:43,871
Speaking.

629
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,416
<i>This is Dr. Hayes.
I'm calling about your daughter Clara.</i>

630
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,220
<i>I've been trying you
for around an hour now.</i>

631
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:49,378
Tell me.

632
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:50,461
<i>Sorry?</i>

633
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:53,339
How is she?

634
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,301
<i>She's fine. She's up, ready to go.</i>

635
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,985
<i>She's wondering where you are.</i>

636
01:15:58,011 --> 01:15:59,263
<i>So am I, for that matter.</i>

637
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,226
Tell her I'm on my way.

638
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,309
I'll be there soon.

639
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:08,313
<i>Okay, will do.
I'll make sure she gets something to eat.</i>

640
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:10,856
Thank you.

641
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,707
- Mommy!
- Hey, sweetie.

642
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,210
They gave me red jello and ice cream.

643
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,255
Ooh, they did, sweetie?

644
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,341
Yeah, and spaghetti for dinner.

645
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:18,925
What happened to your neck?

646
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:21,303
Oh, I scratched it.

647
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:22,971
Did it hurt?

648
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:25,098
Yeah, a little.

649
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,935
When are we leaving?
Do I have to stay in here?

650
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,357
No, we don't. We're free to go now.

651
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:46,346
Yeah. No, you're right, Mom,

652
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,433
I should have called you right back,
but I just didn't want to bother you.

653
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,476
But we're hitting the road now, yeah.

654
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,646
No. Promise you, everything is all good.

655
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,570
What letter are we up to?

656
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:04,238
Mommy?

657
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,324
What, sweetie?

658
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,744
What letter were we up to?

659
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:10,954
Uh...

660
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:12,706
I can't remember.

661
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:13,832
