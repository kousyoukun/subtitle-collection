to see you snoopin' around my football field first day of practice?

Well, that's because you got a good-lookin' football team.

Maybe good enough to add another national championship trophy to the old case downstairs.

Yes, I agree, but to guarantee that the H2O is-is purified,

159
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,423
i-it's good to use the heating source, Sterno.

160
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:03,094
It's like my mama always says, ''Better safe than-than sorry.''

161
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:10,001
My mama says that too. aren't all mamas the same?

162
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:13,638
- Yes. - Derek. I kick the field goals around here.

163
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:18,110
Will you listen up? I need your cooperation. I need it now.

164
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:20,879
Is he gonna be-be all right?

165
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:24,383
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He has his good days and his bad days.

166
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,952
Used to be an assistant coach at some big football school,

167
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:28,989
but he had a mental breakdown or something.

168
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:31,524
Don't worry. He'll snap out of it.

169
00:12:32,195 --> 00:12:34,460
- Let me know when it cools down, baby. all right. - Yes.

170
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,064
[Chuckles]

00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,766
[panting]

172
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:43,102
Hey, did you all get a load of the new waterboy?

173
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:47,807
Let's make him feel right at home. Jerry, go right.

174
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:51,144
Casey, go left. Way left.

175
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:53,580
- On one. Ready? - [all] Break!

176
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:02,656
Set! Red, 22!

177
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:06,494
Red, 22! Hut!

178
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,300
[Grunting]

179
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:15,003
- [Cheering] - [Laughing]

180
00:13:18,677 --> 00:13:22,377
I-I-I-I think you zigged when you should've zagged on that play.

181
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:26,549
- Sorry. - Hey, Waterboy, check this out.

182

[all Laughing]

[Laughing Continues]

184
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,905
Hey, Waterboy! Check this out.

185
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:54,976
- [Laughing] - [Grunting]

186
00:13:55,614 --> 00:13:57,346
- Yes. - [Grunting Continues]

187
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,448
Well, my, my, my.

188
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:03,085
Was my little aquatic engineer about to bash one of my football players?

189
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,055
Well, he spit in the c-c-cooler.

190
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:09,493
He happens to be a finely tuned athletic machine.

191
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:14,131
and I ain't gonna have him hit in the head by some idiot waterboy.

192
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:18,068
[Echoing] Do you understand me?

193
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:20,604
- are you all right? - What? I wasn't gonna do nothin', Coach.

194
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:23,506
Well, you better do something. You gotta defend yourself here, Bobby.

195
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:26,811
But they're-they're-they're finely tuned athletic machines.

196
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:29,914
I am not telling you to go on a shooting rampage.

197
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:33,249
But you have to stand up for yourself, or they're gonna ride you all season long.

198
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:36,487
Believe me, I've seen it myself.

199
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:44,830
Hey, moron!

200
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,103
Hey! Moron! Duh!

201
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:54,807
[Imitating Bobby] L-Look at me. I'm the w-w-waterboy.

202
00:14:55,644 --> 00:15:00,011
Duh! I got a wooden spoon. Duh!

203
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,816
Smell like you could use a shower, stinky. [Cackling]

204
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,754
You're fired! [Cackling]

205
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:12,959
[Both Laughing]

206
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,460
Stop makin' fun of me.

207
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:19,531
Red, ready! Hut!

208
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:25,538
- Wow! - Damn!

209
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:27,606
[Mumbling]

210
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,947
- I'm sorry. - [Groaning]

211
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,183
Who that? Who there?

212
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:43,490
So that's what openin' up a can of whoop-ass feels like.

213
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,426
Son, you just opened a whole case of whoop-ass.

214
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:51,231
I would be honored if you play football for this team.

215
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:54,969
- Me? play football? - Yes.

216
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,706
Thanks, but no thanks. My mama won't let me play no football.

217
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:02,543
We're gonna go home. You and I, we're gonna talk to Mama.

218
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:05,680
M-Mama said-- M-Mama said-- My mama said-- Mama said--

219
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:09,317
- My mama said-- My mama say that-- - She's gonna say yes.

220
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,657
[Zapper Buzzing]

221
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:24,231
Mmm, that snake looks delicious.

222
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:27,268
What part do you think I'm about to eat?

223
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:31,306
Uh, basically a snake don't have parts.

224
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:34,676
But, uh, if I had to call it anything,

225
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:37,813
I would say it's his knee.

226
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,682
Great. His knee.

227
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:44,921
and what are we having for dessert?

228
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:48,524
[animal Chittering In Zapper]

229
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,594
- Squirrel. - [Squirrel Thuds]

230
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:54,130
Excellent.

231
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,434
Let's talk about Bobby playing football.

232
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:01,370
I don't like it, Mr. Coach Klein. I don't like it one bit.

233
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:04,274
You see, my boy is too delicate to be playin' ''fool's ball''--

234
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:06,576
or whatever you call it-- with them gargantuans.

235
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:08,913
I don't think you understand, Mrs. Boucher.

236
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,448
No, you don't understand me, Mr. Coach Klein.

237
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:15,152
My boy is all I got left. Ow!

238
00:17:16,091 --> 00:17:17,756
- [Steve Braying] - Mama, here.

239
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:19,791
It's the brain pain, Coach.

240
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:22,794
You see, my husband Robert,

241
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,463
one day back in 1966, pick up sticks,

242
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,268
and me four months pregnant with this precious angel.

243
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:33,071
He decides he wants to go and help the foreign peoples.

244
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,107
He's gonna go and join the peace Corps.

245
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:37,310
and he promise me that everything's gonna be okay.

246
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:40,179
Just like you promisin' me now.

247
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,049
But everything wasn't okay. No.

248
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:46,450
He got lost in the middle of the Sahara Desert.

249
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:49,953
and he died. He died!

250
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:55,224
- Couldn't get no water, Coach. He died of the dehydration. - and we were left all alone.

251
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:59,863
I would've gotten my daddy some water, but I was just a little baby inside Mama's stomach.

252
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:03,200
and now you wanna take away the only part of my Robert I have left.

253
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:07,305
But don't you want the only part you've got left to get a college education?

254
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,843
- Nah. - Me, a college student?

255
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:15,147
Yes. Bobby, think about it.

256
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,550
a whole new world will open to you.

257
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,586
Boy, Mama, that-that-that sounds nice. Me-Me, a college man.

258
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,989
Coach, my Bobby's a sweet boy,

259
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:25,658
but he ain't exactly what you'd call ''college material,''

260
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:28,528
so don't you go fillin' his simple head with all those crazy dreams...

261
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:31,531
of school and college and things of that sort.

262
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:34,201
But Mama, I-I'm tired of everybody callin' me a dummy.

263
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:37,436
I'm-I'm tired of not havin' any friends.

264
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:40,741
and my ass is tired sittin' here jawin' all night. I'm goin' to bed.

265
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:44,678
Nice to meet you, Mr. Coach. Good luck with your fool's ball.

266
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:47,848
Bobby, after you let Mr. Coach out, you come into my bedroom.

267
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,451
Mamma'll brush your hair.

268
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:55,355
- [Door Closes] - You know, when I was your age,

269
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:59,328
my mother told me not to get a tattoo... of Roy Orbison.

270
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:09,638
But what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

271
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:15,710
I trust you'll make the right decision.

272
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:22,517
* Oh, yeah *

273
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:25,987
* Huh I'm *

274
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,990
* Gonna get under your skin *

275
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:32,294
- * Sooner or later * - Damn, I don't want that ass on the team.

276
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:34,530
Everybody's gonna laugh at us.

277
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:36,565
Everybody's already laughin' at us.

278
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:39,268
We ain't won a game since 1994.

279
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,539
- * Sooner or later ** - Hey! What's up, baby? - Hey.

280
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:47,878
- Where's your helmet? - Derek Wallace, they-they don't got no more helmets.

281
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:51,080
Here. You can share mine.

282
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:53,683
Try it on, man. See if it fits.

283
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,589
- all right. - Thanks, friend.

284
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:02,826
- What a dink. - [Whistle Blowing]

285
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:05,462
Come on! Huddle up!

286
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,499
- [Mumbling] - [Coach Klein] all right, we have an announcement to make.

287
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:12,503
Our former waterboy, Bobby Boucher, is gonna play some linebacker for us.

288
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:17,941
[Imitating Bobby] Ooh, I'm a f-f-football player. [Grunting]

289
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:22,112
- Coach, I'd like to tackle him right now, please. - Not yet.

290
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:25,749
all right, now I wanna work with the offence. I wanna work with the defense.

291
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:28,919
- Special teams, go with Farmer Fran, do some laps. - Shit.

292
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:31,522
[Farmer Fran Mumbling]

293
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:37,261
Line up on the ball.

294
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,732
- [Man] Let's go. - all right? Third and ten.

295
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,101
Third and ten?

296
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:49,608
Yeah, you know, that's the offense's last opportunity...

297
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:51,977
to gain ten yards before they have to punt.

298
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:53,979
Gee, he's gonna run the option.

299
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:55,982
Option?

300
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,650
- [Grumbling] - He ain't never gonna be able to figure this out, Coach.

301
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,653
Yes, he is.

302
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:05,291
Now, Bobby, you've waterboyed for 18 years.

303
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:07,593
Didn't you occasionally watch the game?

304
00:21:08,197 --> 00:21:10,462
Oh, I had a lot to k-keep me busy.

305
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:13,999
- Checking the pH levels, refillin' the cups. - all right.

306
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:16,469
Well, then let's just keep it simple.

307
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:19,672
Casey. I want you to tackle Casey...

308
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,375
like you did Gee yesterday.

309
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,345
- Right now? - Right now! Go!

310
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,314
- Does he know about this? - Doesn't matter. You're a warrior.

311
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:30,517
Go.

312
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,292
- [Man] Boy, what you doin'? - [players Grumbling]

313
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,597
[Coach Klein] all right. Bobby, Bobby.

314
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,166
Don't be afraid to use all of your strength, you know?

315
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,602
He's resilient. He's a resilient guy.

316
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,705
Okay? Come on.

317
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,874
[Man] Hey, Casey, I think he wanna make out with you.

318
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,177
- [Whistle Blowing] - Okay, that's enough. Thank you.

319
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,047
Is there any sport that you do watch? You know, a physical sport?

320
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:01,748
- Boxing? Hockey? - Wrestling.

321
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:04,084
Wrestling! Wrestling is good.

322
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,119
Who's your favorite wrestler?

323
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:09,223
Well, even though he was slightly discourteous to me recently,

324
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,625
I'm gonna have to say Captain Insano.

325
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:15,062
Okay, okay, I want you to do to Casey...

326
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,301
what Captain Insano does to the bad guy.

327
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,803
Go.

328
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,411
- Ow! Ow! - [players Gasping]

329
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,348
- He poked me in the eye. - Captain Insano shows no mercy.

330
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:38,488
Bobby, where was the intensity that I saw yesterday?

331
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,457
That was no intensity. You said it was all right to fight back,

332
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:45,328
and I-I just started thinkin' about all the people who-who'd been mean to me over the years.

333
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:49,399
That's it. That's it.

334
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,867
I want you to think about all those mean people.

335
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:56,206
- They're gonna be your tackling fuel. - Tacklin' fuel.

336
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,376
- We're gonna use them to play football. - Tacklin' fuel.

337
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:04,581
I want you to pretend that Casey...

338
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,351
- is insulting you. - pretend?

339
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:11,188
I want you to visualize all those people that have been mean to you.

340
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:14,358
and then I want you to attack. I want you to visualize and then attack.

341
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,094
- Can you handle that? - I'll try.

342
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,197
He's gonna try.

343
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:31,643
What's the matter with you, boy? You too s-s-stupid...

344
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:33,845
to do what your coach tells ya?

345
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:36,948
- [Coach Laughing] - No!

346
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:40,052
- No what? - [Yelling]

347
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:44,889
[players Murmuring]

348
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:48,460
I didn't mean to hurt you. Coach told me to pretend.

349
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:53,498
Bobby. Bobby! Can you do this for me every single game? Can you do this?

350
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:56,436
Coach, not only will I do it for you.

351
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,006
I-I-I-- Yes, yes, I'll do it for ya.

352
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:03,575
[Chattering]

353
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:08,280
So, uh, why you pick this class anyway? It's pretty hard.

354
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:10,816
Oh, beautiful view.

355
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,655
Correct.

356
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,691
all right, all right!

357
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:19,926
Y'all shut up now!

358
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:23,829
Now, last week, we talked about...

359
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:26,534
the physiology of the animal brain...

360
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:29,403
as it pertains to aggression.

361
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:32,938
Now, is there anyone here that can tell me why...

362
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:36,243
most alligators are abnormally aggressive?

363
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,479
- I know the answer to this question. - Raise your hand.

364
00:24:40,218 --> 00:24:43,351
anybody? anyone? Yes, sir. You, sir.

365
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,788
Mama says that alligators are ornery...

366
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:51,626
'cause they got all them teeth but no toothbrush.

367
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:56,897
[Chuckling] Yo mama said,

368
00:24:57,668 --> 00:25:00,567
alligators are ornery 'cause they got all them teeth...

369
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:03,070
and no toothbrush.

370
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:05,073
Wow!

371
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,942
anybody else? Yes, sir. You, sir.

372
00:25:08,614 --> 00:25:11,480
alligators are aggressive because of an enlarged medulla oblongata.

373
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:13,849
It's the sector of the brain which controls aggressive behavior.

374
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:17,586
- That is correct! The medulla oblongata. - But Mama said--

375
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,790
The medulla oblongata...

376
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:26,528
is where anger, jealousy and aggression come from.

377
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,534
Now, is there anybody here can tell me where happiness comes from?

378
00:25:32,671 --> 00:25:35,103
- No, man. - anyone?

379
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:41,244
all right, let's hear what Mama has to say on the subject.

380
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:46,783
Mama say that happiness is from magic rays of sunshine that come down when you feelin' blue.

381
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:53,490
Well, folks, Mama's wrong again.

382
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:57,161
No, Colonel Sanders, you're wrong.

383
00:25:57,665 --> 00:25:58,929
- [Students] Ooh! - Mama's right.

384
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:03,234
You're all wrong. Mama's right. Mama's right!

385
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:06,138
Somethin' wrong with his medulla oblongata.

386
00:26:06,742 --> 00:26:09,107
- [Class Laughing] - [Yelling]

387
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,446
It's okay to fight back. Coach Klein said I could.

388
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,982
Mr. Coach Klein said I could. It's fine, fellas.

389
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:23,553
[announcer] Well, Mud Dog fans, it's time to kick off...

390
00:26:24,158 --> 00:26:25,656
another year of Mud Dog football.

391
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,293
With the weight of a 40-game losing streak on their back,

392
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:32,897
everyone seems to be diggin' in for the long haul.

393
00:26:35,336 --> 00:26:37,768
* There's blood in the streets It's up to my ankles *

394
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:42,073
* There's blood in the streets It's up to my knee *

395
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:46,644
* Blood on the streets in the town of Chicago *

396
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:50,816
* Blood on the rise It's following me **

397
00:26:51,787 --> 00:26:53,252
What you doin', Bobby?

398
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:56,622
Oh, Lord, that-that-that's some heavy-duty armpit saturation.

399
00:26:57,494 --> 00:26:59,826
That's an early warning sign of the dehydration. You got to have H2O.

400
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:01,895
- please, for me. - Look, you need to stop worryin' about water, baby,

401
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:04,162
and start worryin' about the game today, okay?

402
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:08,501
Here. Now, just do whatever you did to Colonel Sanders,

403
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:11,104
and you'll be fine.

404
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:14,974
I-I will, thank you. I-I-I just-- I feel bad about lyin' to my mama.

405
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:17,544
I wonder what she's doin' right now.

Come on, everybody. You can do it. Gain some yards. put some points on the board.

00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:08,517
No! Get away from me.

468
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:11,087
Okay.

469
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:18,059
Excuse me? May I help you?

470
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:21,430
Hey, stud.

471
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:25,000
Vicki Vallencourt, this is-- this is quite a pleasant surprise.

472
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:29,137
Yeah, well, I just got out of jail, and I heard you were playin' football.

473
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:33,210
Yes, well, I-I-I've--

474
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:37,447
[Mumbling, Indistinct]

475
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:39,550
[Bobby] Yes.

476
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:41,819
[Mumbling, Indistinct]

477
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:47,224
So, let's say we go and get somethin' to eat, catch up on things.

478
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:49,460
Oh, uh--

479
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:52,463
Mama's not a-a-a big fan of restaurants...

480
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:54,898
or of-of me going to one.

481
00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:59,637
But if-if you'd like, sometimes,

482
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:02,873
Mama, she, uh-- she like to-- on a Sunday afternoon--

483
00:32:03,612 --> 00:32:07,279
There-There's a-a-a grill with the charcoal b-biscuits.

484
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:10,214
- You want me to come to a barbecue? - Yes, that's it.

485
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:13,017
[Chuckling] Sounds great.

486
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:18,189
and by the way, I hope you like what I did to y'all lawn mower.

487
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,065
[Steve Braying]

488
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:32,071
You know that old hag that does astrology on Good Morning America,

489
00:32:32,775 --> 00:32:34,273
she really ought to pack it in.

490
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:37,208
Listen what she said for Sagittarius. She goes:

491
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:39,978
''You're gonna be faced with a difficult decision today.''

492
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:43,349
But the thing is-is-is, we're all faced with difficult decisions every day.

493
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:45,784
- That's like sayin' you're gonna eat today. - Yeah, m-maybe...

494
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,021
by leaving her predictions vague and generalized,

495
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,992
there's less of a chance of someone findin' out she's a phoney.

496
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:54,694
Whatever, college boy.

497
00:32:55,332 --> 00:32:58,031
-Don't say college boy. Here comes Mama. -Oh, okay.

498
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:03,703
That looks nice, Mama.

499
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:05,872
[Sighing]

500
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:08,774
- Mmm, here you go, Vicki Vallencourt. - Thank you.

501
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:11,912
Mama, Vicki's an astrologist.

502
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:14,415
I don't believe in that sort of thing, personally.

503
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:16,783
astronomy is one of the many tools of the devil.

504
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:23,356
You sure played great yesterday, Bobby.

505
00:33:24,094 --> 00:33:27,127
- What did my boy play great? - Uh, um--

506
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:31,499
Waterboy. Yeah, waterboy. He played-- He played waterboy great.

507
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,236
Everybody who was thirsty got a drink right away...

508
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:38,073
yesterday at the-- at the football game.

509
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:41,610
Fool's ball! Bunch of overgrown monsters manhandling each other.

510
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,412
Remember when that man wanted you to play fool's ball, Bobby?

511
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,116
Yeah, I-- He-- Roy Orbison--

512
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,185
Coach Klein. I-I-I remember.

513
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:53,454
So, Bobby, did they ever catch that gorilla...

514
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,891
what escaped from the zoo and punched you in the eye?

515
00:33:56,562 --> 00:34:00,029
No, Mama, he-- The-The search continues.

516
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,803
What would you think if Bobby did play football, Mrs. Boucher?

517
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:10,940
Well, I wouldn't think much of it at all.

518
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:13,710
and to tell you the truth, I don't think much of you...

519
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:16,946
and all your snotty questions, Miss Vallencourt.

520
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:20,249
I'm quite disturbed to see that you're so interested in my boy.

521
00:34:21,022 --> 00:34:24,288
I'm very, very interested in your boy, Mrs. Boucher.

522
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:26,490
- Really? - Mm.

523
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:28,826
Well, did he tell you about how much his feet smell?

524
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:31,596
- Mama. - He has to wear two pair of socks.

525
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,666
Well, men are supposed to have stinky feet.

526
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:37,068
Well, are men supposed to wear pyjamas...

527
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:39,735
featuring a cartoon character by the name of Deputy Dog?

528
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:42,572
- Mama, please. - Well, you know what?

529
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:45,107
I happen to find Deputy Dog to be...

530
00:34:45,778 --> 00:34:49,111
very, very sexy.

531
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,182
Did he tell you about a little bedtime problem?

532
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:55,985
- Mama, I'm beggin' you, don't. - That's his sheet back there.

533
00:34:58,192 --> 00:35:00,791
lf you'll excuse me, ladies, I'm gonna go hang myself.

534
00:35:01,595 --> 00:35:03,860
- Now you see what you done? - What I did?

535
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:07,131
Now you listen here, cupcake. The "onliest" woman in my boy's life is me.

536
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:11,202
Nobody's gonna take him away, especially not some godless Jezebel like you.

537
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:13,871
Oh, yeah, well your Bobby is a grown man.

538
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:17,342
and guess what? He can hang out with whoever he wants!

539
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:20,111
Oh, yes, he can. Whoever he wants. 'Cept you!

540
00:35:20,716 --> 00:35:23,549
Bobby, that-that woman is the devil.

541
00:35:24,353 --> 00:35:26,018
- I want you to stay away from her, you hear me? - Yes, Mama.

542
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:29,322
Now you come on inside before that little ol' witch casts a spell on us!

543
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:35,961
I'm sorry, Vicki Vallencourt.

544
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:42,803
Whatever.

545
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:46,305
* lf you want it, you got it You feed it, you love it *

546
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,842
* Say that you need it You never-- **

547
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:55,882
When we report on the S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs here on Sportscenter, it's usually to add...

548
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,719
another number to their amazing losing streak, which now stands at 41.

549
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:03,324
But now, Bobby Boucher has given us another reason.

550
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:05,658
In the Mud Dog's latest loss this past Saturday,

551
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:08,528
the amazing 31-year-old freshman set a new N.C.A.A. record...

552
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,198
by sacking the quarterback 16 times,

553
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:13,667
shattering the old record of seven.

554
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,804
and, oh, by the way, Bobby Boucher is also the team's waterboy,

555
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,308
which, of course, begs the question:

556
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,609
What exactly are they putting in the water...

557
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,445
down in Jackson's Bayou, Louisiana?

558
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:29,049
* There is a house in New Orleans *

559
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,922
* They call The Rising Sun **

560
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:38,394
[announcer] We're deadlocked at three with less than a minute to go.

561
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,129
[Coach Klein] We are one family with one dream.

562
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,298
There are 40 of you on this team, not just one.

563
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,768
Bobby can't do this by himself. Now get out there and make something happen!

564
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,504
- all right, sacrifice your bodies. Go, go, go! - [players Cheering]

565
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:53,508
Thank you. Bobby, you're gonna have to do this by yourself...

566
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,311
because there is nobody on this team that's any good.

567
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,081
Now look, I can't stand losing any more.

568
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:02,117
We've got to win one game. Can you go out there and make something happen?

569
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:04,186
- Visualize and attack. - Yeah.

570
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:05,855
- Visualize and attack. please! - Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

571
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,424
- please! - [Mumbling, Indistinct]

572
00:37:09,128 --> 00:37:11,727
[announcer] Central Kentucky's down to their third straight quarterback.

573
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:14,430
Good news, folks. First-string quarterback, Tommy Gardner,

574
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:16,666
does not have a broken neck.

575
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,003
Blue, 52! Blue, 52! Hut!

576
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:23,273
I forbid you to talk to that enchantress. She's the devil!

577
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:27,077
She's not the devil. She's the most beautiful woman in the world.

578
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,879
- I never said she was the devil. - She's the most beautiful woman in the world.

579
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:33,350
Oh, please, don't hurt me!

580
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:38,154
Follow the-- Come on!

581
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:40,391
You crazy man! Okay, okay, okay!

582
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:43,794
It's a safety! They win, they win, they win!

583
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:47,164
With the help of Boucher, the losing streak is over!

584
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:50,468
I'm so sorry, Mama. please, forgive me.

585
00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:53,772
I love you so much, Mama. I love you.

586
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:56,474
- I love you too. - [Derek] We won!

587
00:37:57,146 --> 00:38:00,079
We won, baby! It's gonna be a big party tonight, and you're going!

588
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:03,581
- Me? party? - Yeah, baby!

Hey! Nice suit.

Thank you. It was my daddy's.

595
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:29,175
Mama don't know I'm here, but I took these outta the icebox: Louisiana frog cakes.

596
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,011
Thanks.

597
00:38:32,582 --> 00:38:35,515
- Come on in. - [Woman] Hey, Bobby Boucher!

598
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:38,519
Look who's here: Sergeant Stutter.

599
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:42,056
- Want a beer? - I'll take a Scotch and water. Hold the Scotch.

600
00:38:42,994 --> 00:38:45,660
- You just make a joke, Bobby? - Yes, I did.

601
00:38:46,497 --> 00:38:48,862
[Chuckling] Good one.

602
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:52,933
Now that you finally won a game, right, you feel looser, the pressure is off,

603
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:56,034
and that will lead to a lot more victories.

604
00:38:56,705 --> 00:39:00,205
- Yeah, that and a waterboy getting 20 sacks a game. - That too.

605
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,744
- professor! - [Gasping]

606
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:07,547
We still havin' that test on amphibians and reptiles next Friday?

607
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:12,117
Yes, sir. That is, if it's all right with you.

608
00:39:13,223 --> 00:39:17,057
- Of course, it is. - My best regards to your dear mama.

609
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:20,360
[Woman] Let's talk to the waterboy.

610
00:39:21,065 --> 00:39:22,763
You played amazing at the game today, Bobby.

611
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:26,467
and you are so cute. Is there a girl you're seein'?

612
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:31,338
Seein'? Uh, uh, I see a lot of girls.

613
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:34,276
I see a lot of guys too.

614
00:39:34,846 --> 00:39:36,778
I think that's sexy.

615
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,381
You ever been with a guy and a girl at the same time?

616
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:41,484
Oh, yeah, plenty of times.

617
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,786
The other night, I was with my mama and Coach Klein at the same time.

618
00:39:47,326 --> 00:39:50,392

She may be the devil. Mama said that.

Consequently, I am prohibited from contact with her.

Let's have a warm L.T. welcome for Bobby Boucher. Come on, Bobby.

639
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,639
- [Cheering] - Thank you, Mr. Lawrence Taylor.

640
00:41:09,244 --> 00:41:12,143
Tell me, what is your secret? How do you find yourself in the right position all the time?

641
00:41:13,048 --> 00:41:14,513
That-That-That's a good question.

642
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,150
What-What happens is, the-the-the centre has-has the ball first.

643
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:20,653
and-and-and the quarterback will say, ''Hike.''

644
00:41:21,224 --> 00:41:24,290
That's when the c-center puts the ball in-into the hands of the quarterback.

645
00:41:25,228 --> 00:41:27,660
So what I do is, I-I start tacklin' the quarterback,

646
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:30,296
unless he give the ball to-to s-somebody else,

647
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,399
in which case, I-I try to tackle that person.

Oh, nothin'. I was just thinkin'...

653
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:01,661
about stealin' L.T.'s Porsche over there.

654

But I suppose I ought to be movin' on before I get you in trouble with your mama.

655

Well, Mr. Coach Klein said that what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

00:43:07,499 --> 00:43:09,564
Vicki Vallencourt, I figured...

670
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:13,268
'cause you're interested in astrology and mystical stuff like that,

671
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:16,038
you might appreciate this.

672
00:43:18,411 --> 00:43:21,010
That's water from a glacier in Alaska.

673
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:25,414
It-It was blessed by a-an Eskimo medicine man.

- It's cold! - Yes, it's always cold. That's why it's so special.

00:43:47,942 --> 00:43:50,341
That-That was-- That-That-That-That happened--

676
00:43:51,113 --> 00:43:54,513
That-That happened to be my-my first time with-with lips...

677
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,550
and-and-and-and-and and-and-and-and-and the-the tongue.

678
00:43:59,454 --> 00:44:02,420
That was your tongue. I-- I believe it was--

I never did that before.

680

Well, if that was your first kiss,

681
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:10,728
then I bet it's the first time you've seen a pair of these.

682
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:16,869
Yes, yes, that is a-another first for me,

are gonna fall one victory short of that Bourbon Bowl bid.

693
00:44:58,415 --> 00:45:00,947
Iowa could win the game by nailing this 20-yard field goal.

694
00:45:01,752 --> 00:45:03,884
Yeah, but the Mud Dogs have played a sensational football game.

Let's take a look at the way Boucher entered the Hawkeyes' last drive.

the Mud Dogs are goin' to the Bourbon Bowl.

717
00:46:44,226 --> 00:46:46,625
With yesterday's come-from-behind victory, the S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs...

718
00:46:47,395 --> 00:46:49,594
earned a New Year's Day date with Red Beaulieu and the Louisiana Cougars...

719

in the first annual Bourbon Bowl.

00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:57,670
he's got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent.

In fact, yesterday, Michigan, devastated by injury,

723
00:47:01,878 --> 00:47:03,876
experimented with their towel boy at wide receiver.

it reminds me just about how special this season really was.

Oh, yes, we can, and, yes, we will.

a young man who has been so vital to our success.

01:11:21,192 --> 01:11:23,791
Waterboy! Waterboy!

1083
01:11:24,562 --> 01:11:26,827
Waterboy! Waterboy!

1084
01:11:27,565 --> 01:11:29,697
Fool's ball's not for the devil.

1085
01:11:30,368 --> 01:11:31,833
It's for my Bobby.

1086
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:35,603
Time to open up some whoop-ass.

1087
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,610
[Cheering, Chanting Continues]

1088
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,547
Shit, he showed up. all right, look.

1089
01:11:46,486 --> 01:11:49,852
Just relax. Relax. Go in there and do exactly like we planned. Go, go, go!

1090
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:53,121
This could be the start of some high drama, folks.

1091
01:11:53,825 --> 01:11:55,557
Or are the Mud Dogs too far behind?

1092
01:11:56,162 --> 01:11:58,160
Bobby Boucher is on defense.

1093
01:11:58,831 --> 01:12:01,563
- The Cougars are coming out from their own 20 yard line. - [Quarterback] Hut! Hut!

1094
01:12:02,435 --> 01:12:04,433
The pitch. It's a reverse!

1095
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,003
Boucher's not fooled.

1096
01:12:07,674 --> 01:12:09,873
Fumble! Robideaux's got it!

1097
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:11,908
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

1098
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:13,943
[Growling]

1099
01:12:14,448 --> 01:12:17,381
- Boy, Boucher knocked the poop out of him. - ''poop''?

1100
01:12:18,285 --> 01:12:20,717
[all Shouting]

1101
01:12:21,455 --> 01:12:22,920
Slap hands! Slap hands!

1102
01:12:25,193 --> 01:12:28,526
Drink up, now. I want you girls to sober up. Have faith in my Bobby.

1103
01:12:29,464 --> 01:12:31,896
[Musburger] The Mud Dogs are faced with yet another third and long.

1104
01:12:32,668 --> 01:12:34,266
- Hut! - Grenouille back to pass.

1105
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:39,071
He's gonna be stuffed again! and the Mud Dogs offence is still unable to move that ball.

1106
01:12:40,275 --> 01:12:42,807
But the way their defense is fired up, they still have a shot at winning this game.

1107
01:12:43,576 --> 01:12:45,174
Blake, come here. Look.

1108
01:12:45,812 --> 01:12:48,544
Now, what if we, uh-- [Whispering]

1109
01:12:51,418 --> 01:12:54,050
Trust me. Go, go, go, go, go. [Evil Laughter]

1110
01:12:54,922 --> 01:12:58,455
[Musburger] The Cougars lead 27-7 in the middle of the third quarter.

1111
01:12:59,494 --> 01:13:01,092
- and he takes a knee? - [Whistle Blows]

1112
01:13:01,629 --> 01:13:04,595
- Y'all gonna play or what? - [Chattering]

1113
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:08,065
[Laughing] How do you all like my new offence?

1114
01:13:11,807 --> 01:13:13,272
[Musburger] all right, it's second and 12...

1115
01:13:13,809 --> 01:13:16,675
- as the Cougars line up on the ball. - Hut! Hut!

1116
01:13:17,547 --> 01:13:19,078
[Whistle Blows]

1117
01:13:19,649 --> 01:13:22,181
What is Red Beaulieu doing, refusing to play offence?

1118
01:13:22,985 --> 01:13:25,150
- Dan, this is bizarre. - [Dan] No, it's not, Brent.

1119
01:13:25,789 --> 01:13:28,421
It's brilliant, because Red is taking the waterboy out of the game.

1120
01:13:29,292 --> 01:13:31,257
By kneeling down three times and punting,

1121
01:13:31,927 --> 01:13:33,492
he's gonna make the Mud Dog offence try to beat him.

1122
01:13:33,996 --> 01:13:35,894
and the way they're playing today, that's impossible.

1123
01:13:36,466 --> 01:13:38,097
[Musburger] Well, the Mud Dog's most valuable player,

1124
01:13:38,635 --> 01:13:41,134
the linebacker they call ''the Waterboy,'' is now powerless.

1125
01:13:41,971 --> 01:13:46,071
That means Coach Klein will have to find another way to outfox Red.

1126
01:13:47,211 --> 01:13:50,678
- [Whistle Blows] - [Man] Mud Dogs call a time-out.

1127
01:13:51,748 --> 01:13:53,813
- [Cheering, Indistinct] - Mr. Coach Klein. Mr. Coach Klein!

1128
01:13:54,519 --> 01:13:56,651
Mr. Coach Klein!

1129
01:13:57,288 --> 01:14:00,588
- Where are you going? - I was just gonna get a hot pretzel.

1130
01:14:01,592 --> 01:14:03,824
Mr. Coach Klein, are you afraid of Red Beaulieu?

1131
01:14:04,529 --> 01:14:06,594
[Laughing, Shouting]

1132
01:14:08,299 --> 01:14:09,764
I am petrified of him.

1133
01:14:10,267 --> 01:14:12,666
Well, why don't you pretend that Red Beaulieu...

1134
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:15,136
is somebody that you're-you're not afraid of.

1135
01:14:15,673 --> 01:14:17,805
- pretend? - Yes.

1136
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,542
Visualize somebody you're not afraid of.

1137
01:14:21,213 --> 01:14:23,679
- and then attack, like you told me. - I'll try.

1138
01:14:24,449 --> 01:14:26,748
Well, he's right over there.

1139
01:14:32,524 --> 01:14:34,756
[Chuckling]

1140
01:14:38,798 --> 01:14:40,496
Little baby.

1141
01:14:41,033 --> 01:14:42,965
Yeah.

1142
01:14:43,636 --> 01:14:47,503
Hello, little baby. [Baby Talking]

a poo-poo? Do you have a poo-poo?

1144
01:14:54,146 --> 01:14:55,577
Yes.

1145
01:14:56,115 --> 01:14:58,013
Okay. Now.

1146
01:14:58,685 --> 01:15:00,550
This is what we're gonna do. He's gonna come here--

1147
01:15:01,154 --> 01:15:03,119
[Chattering, Shouting]

1148
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:11,695
Come and get this one, Cougars.

1149
01:15:12,432 --> 01:15:14,297
Red, 22! Hike!

1150
01:15:14,868 --> 01:15:17,233
[Musburger] Snap to Grenouille. a reverse!

1151
01:15:18,038 --> 01:15:20,971
No, it's a double reverse! Oh, what a block!

1152
01:15:21,841 --> 01:15:23,272
and Boudier springs free!

1153
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:27,578
Trouble! Lateral! Got him! What a play!

1154
01:15:28,682 --> 01:15:31,648
Grenouille to the 15! To the 10! To the 5!

1155
01:15:32,553 --> 01:15:34,351
- Touchdown, Mud Dogs! - [Fouts] Well, well, well.

1156
01:15:35,022 --> 01:15:37,087
I guess Coach Klein does have a few tricks up his sleeve after all.

1157
01:15:37,758 --> 01:15:40,490
What the hell-- What the hell is this? Huh?

1158
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:44,027
We go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs!

1159
01:15:44,866 --> 01:15:47,565
Right now, we're going to go down to the sidelines and our man, Lynn Swann.

1160
01:15:48,402 --> 01:15:50,067
Swannie, what do you have for us?

1161
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:52,137
I'm with Vicki Vallencourt, who's taking over...

1162
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:55,006
Bobby Boucher's water duties for this important game.

1163
01:15:55,777 --> 01:15:58,142
Oh, I'm not takin' over. I'm just tryin' not to screw up too bad.

1164
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,512
Well, let me ask you this. What's your prediction for the rest of this ball game?

1165
01:16:02,318 --> 01:16:03,916
Mud Dogs are gonna win, 30 to 27.

1166
01:16:04,452 --> 01:16:06,584
That's very interesting. How'd you come up with that guess?

1167
01:16:07,288 --> 01:16:09,954
Guess? That ain't no guess! That's what it's gonna be.

1168
01:16:10,759 --> 01:16:13,091
- Okay. That's fine. - Oh! Be careful down there, Swannie.

1169
01:16:17,232 --> 01:16:19,297
all right. Meaney. Where's Meaney?

1170
01:16:19,936 --> 01:16:21,401
- Meaney? - Here, Coach.

1171
01:16:21,971 --> 01:16:24,804
- Get in there and let's see if that waterboy can stop you. - Yes, sir!

1172
01:16:25,608 --> 01:16:28,974
Red is sending his best defender in as a running back?

1173
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,945
What do you make of this, Dan?

1174
01:16:32,549 --> 01:16:34,314
Well, Brent, he's gotta find some way to neutralize the waterboy.

1175
01:16:34,951 --> 01:16:37,617
He probably thinks that Meaney will just pound it in there like Fridge used to do for the Bears.

1176
01:16:38,456 --> 01:16:41,322
Hey, Waterboy! Is your girlfriend gonna save you again?

1177
01:16:42,193 --> 01:16:43,891
Oh, no, sir. I'm gonna take matters into my own hands.

1178
01:16:44,428 --> 01:16:47,661
- You'll see. - Bring it to the hole! Your ass is mine! Whoo!

1179
01:16:48,633 --> 01:16:50,898
Whoo! Whoo!

1180
01:16:51,636 --> 01:16:53,267
You sound like a... a big choo-choo train.

1181
01:16:53,805 --> 01:16:56,537
Whoo! [Groans]

- Derek. Derek! - Yeah.

1186
01:17:20,331 --> 01:17:22,830
Visualize the attack. Go kick the ball. Kick it.

1187
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:25,000
- Hut! - [all Grunting]

1188
01:17:26,971 --> 01:17:28,636
How you doin', boy? [Laughing]

1189
01:17:29,174 --> 01:17:31,172
No, no, no! [Screaming]

[players Shouting, Indistinct]

1193
01:17:55,968 --> 01:17:57,733
What the hell is that?

1194
01:18:04,277 --> 01:18:07,076
Where the hell is-- What the hell is he up to? That ain't in here! Huh?

1195
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:09,346
- [Cheering] - Hey!

1196
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:11,448
[Musburger] Down by ten late in the fourth quarter,

1197
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:14,017
Coach Klein opts for the field goal.

1198
01:18:14,688 --> 01:18:17,521
[Fouts] Then they have to hope for the onside kick and a touchdown to tie the game.

1199
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,726
Dan, look what we have here. Boucher's in the game as a blocker.

1200
01:18:22,696 --> 01:18:24,494
Last game of the year, Brent. Can't hold anything back now.

1201
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:29,634
Set!

1202
01:18:33,174 --> 01:18:34,705
The snap. It's a fake!

1203
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:41,379
Boucher's out in front! a great block!

1204
01:18:42,216 --> 01:18:44,815
- [Grunting] - and a second one!

1205
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,619
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

1206
01:18:48,189 --> 01:18:50,955
- Boucher led him all the way! - [Screaming] Yeah!

1207
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:55,627
Red Beaulieu is steaming, Dan.

1208
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:57,997
Brent, he sees his perfect season slipping away.

1209
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:01,467
The Cougar's lead is down to three.

1210
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:05,904
[Cheerleaders Cheering, Indistinct]

1211
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,474
The Mud Dogs need the ball back if they're gonna have a shot at overtime.

1212
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:13,146
and Bobby Boucher is now on the kickoff team.

1213
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:16,916
- Last game of the year, Brent. Can't hold anything back now. - I know.

1214
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,386
- [Horns Blaring] - Who's it gonna be?

1215
01:19:21,258 --> 01:19:24,091
Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be?

1216
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:30,563
[Chuckling] Oh, yeah. There's my bitch.

1217
01:19:31,334 --> 01:19:33,299
[Musburger] Remember, the ball must travel ten yards.

1218
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:37,937
It's loose!

-Mud Dogs football! Mud Dogs football! -all right!

1220

Mama, I got the football! I got it--

1221
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,945
Oh, what a vicious hit! That was a cheap shot.

1222
01:19:46,617 --> 01:19:48,015
- Oh! - [Murmuring]

1223
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:50,483
- [Whistle Blowing] - [Fouts] and what a dumb penalty.

1224
01:19:51,088 --> 01:19:53,687
That puts the Mud Dogs in field goal range for the tie.

1225
01:19:54,524 --> 01:19:57,290
- Dan, I'm not sure that Boucher is able to get back up. - Oh, my baby!

1226
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:06,735
It's still cold. [Chuckles]

01:20:07,305 --> 01:20:09,570
- [Chattering] - Excuse me. Out of my way.

1228
01:20:13,612 --> 01:20:15,744
Dan, you hate to see this happen.

1229
01:20:24,723 --> 01:20:27,055
Now, that's high quality H2O.

1230
01:20:27,826 --> 01:20:30,992
- [Cheering] - [Vicki] You go on, now! Make it happen, Bobby!

1231
01:20:35,935 --> 01:20:37,633
The waterboy just needed some water.

1232
01:20:38,204 --> 01:20:41,837
- Wow, Dan. You think that up all by yourself? - Shut up, Brent.

1233
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:47,410
- [Shouting, Yelling] - are you okay?

1234
01:20:47,948 --> 01:20:49,646
He tried to open up a can of whoop-ass on me. I wouldn't let him.

1235
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:53,150
Listen, I have an idea for the last play. You haven't done this before.

1236
01:20:54,054 --> 01:20:55,519
all right? The offence is gonna line up like this.

1237
01:20:56,056 --> 01:20:57,521
- Yeah. - You're gonna be right here.

1238
01:20:58,058 --> 01:20:59,790
[Musburger] There'll be no tie here today.

1239
01:21:00,362 --> 01:21:03,228
Coach Klein is sending his offence back on to the field.

1240
01:21:04,098 --> 01:21:05,729
He's going for the win right now.

1241
01:21:06,334 --> 01:21:07,765
[Fouts] Yeah, this is a real gutsy call, Brent.

1242
01:21:08,301 --> 01:21:09,832
He'll either be a hero or a goat because of this.

1243
01:21:10,336 --> 01:21:14,003
[Musburger] and Dan, Bobby Boucher is back on the field.

1244
01:21:15,107 --> 01:21:18,207
He is now playing offence! We know. We know.

1245
01:21:19,145 --> 01:21:21,777
Meaney, if they give that Waterboy the football,

1246
01:21:22,515 --> 01:21:24,013
I don't care if you have to stab him!

1247
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,316
Do not let him get away. Do you understand me?

1248
01:21:26,921 --> 01:21:29,854
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir! - Do you understand me? Get in there!

1249
01:21:30,758 --> 01:21:32,590
[all] Break!

1250
01:21:39,634 --> 01:21:42,967
- I'm ready, friend. - Let's do it, Bobby.

1251
01:21:45,007 --> 01:21:46,939
Set! Set!

1252
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:50,308
Forty-three! Set! Forty-three! Hut, hut!

1253
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,659
Touchdown! They win it! The Mud Dogs win it!

1254
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:14,796
Bobby Boucher's the hero! He's gone from waterboy, Dan, to savior!

1255
01:23:15,734 --> 01:23:17,432
and it's because he didn't hold anything back!

1256
01:23:18,069 --> 01:23:20,835
Well, Swannie's down on the field with our hero, so let's go to Lynn now!

1257
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:27,676
We did it! I can't believe it! I can't believe it!

1258
01:23:28,581 --> 01:23:30,913
- Vicki, I love you! - Whoo! I love you, too, baby.

1259
01:23:31,684 --> 01:23:34,650
We're the champions! [Screaming]

1260
01:23:35,555 --> 01:23:38,621
Mr. Coach Klein, you got your manhood! You got your manhood!

1261
01:23:39,592 --> 01:23:42,158
Bobby, congratulations. You're the M.V.P. of the Bourbon Bowl.

1262
01:23:42,929 --> 01:23:44,394
How do you feel?

1263
01:23:44,931 --> 01:23:47,730
- I love Mama! - [Cheering]

1264
01:24:06,786 --> 01:24:08,784
- There you go, Bobby! - Lookin' sharp, Bobby!

1265
01:24:09,456 --> 01:24:10,921
[Man] You the man, Bobby!

1266
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:13,523
Bobby, I've been dreading this day for a long time.

1267
01:24:14,228 --> 01:24:16,927
- But you got yourself a fine woman. - Oh, thank you, Mama.

1268
01:24:17,731 --> 01:24:19,963
Good luck, son.

1269
01:24:20,702 --> 01:24:22,200
This is the best day of my life!

1270
01:24:24,138 --> 01:24:25,803
You just wait till tonight.

1271
01:24:26,374 --> 01:24:28,506
- What's gonna happen tonight? - [Chuckles] You'll see.

1272
01:24:29,211 --> 01:24:33,412
You can do it! You can do it all night long!

1273
01:24:34,648 --> 01:24:37,214
[Cheering, Shouting]

1274
01:24:37,986 --> 01:24:40,251
I'm gonna go do it!

1275
01:24:46,095 --> 01:24:48,594
- [Tires Screech] - Bobby, it's me!

1276
01:24:49,431 --> 01:24:52,230
- Your daddy, Roberto. - Daddy?

1277
01:24:53,068 --> 01:24:56,935
I've seen you on the ESPM when they was talkin' about you being drafted by the NFL.

1278
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:00,940
Not going to the NFL. I'm gonna stay in school and graduate.

1279
01:25:01,811 --> 01:25:04,877
The hell with school, dopey! Take the money! You and me could be partners,

1280
01:25:05,816 --> 01:25:08,548
- just like that Tiger Woods and his daddy. - [Mama Screaming]

1281
01:25:09,419 --> 01:25:11,351
- Uh-oh. - [Screaming]

1282
01:25:12,022 --> 01:25:13,620
- [Grunting] - [all Gasping]

1283
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:17,125
[Crowd Cheering]

1284
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:20,461
- Nice hit, Mama. - Thanks, baby.

1285
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,031
Now, you go on and have some fun becoming a man.

1286
01:25:33,509 --> 01:25:37,376
* I don't remember what day it was *

1287
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:43,483

1288
01:25:46,223 --> 01:25:50,657

* Every time I kiss your lips *

1296
01:26:14,385 --> 01:26:16,584

1297
01:26:17,289 --> 01:26:19,454

* Tomorrow may see springtime just a day away *

1305
01:26:53,994 --> 01:26:55,258
* Day away *

1306
01:26:55,763 --> 01:26:59,363
* Cupid, we don't need you now Be on your way *

1307
