1
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,763
他出局了
Cut his ass.

2
00:00:50,264 --> 00:00:52,862
加油！加油！
- [Grunting] - Go! Now let's go!

3
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:55,133
[Shouting]

4
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:59,369
加把勁！
- Heads up! - [Grunting]

5
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:05,508
放倒他！就是那樣，就是那樣！
[Man] Take him down! That's it, that's it!

6
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:11,415
- 嘿，教練，怎麼樣？ - Lynn Swann
- Hey, Coach, how you been? - [Laughing] Lynn Swann.

7
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:13,950
我很奇怪
Now, why ain't I surprised...

8
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,753
在我第一天的訓練課上你 為什麼在球場裡晃來晃去？
to see you snoopin' around my football field first day of practice?

9
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:18,923
那是因為你有個很上進的球隊
Well, that's because you got a good-lookin' football team.

10
00:01:19,428 --> 00:01:22,293
有可能再次奪得全國冠軍
Maybe good enough to add another national championship trophy to the old case downstairs.

11
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,431
跟我的一個老朋友說得很像， Lynn
That's kinda like my old man told me one time, Lynn.

12
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:30,636
「唯一比一份龍蝦餐更好的就是五份的龍蝦餐。」
''The only thing better than a crawfish dinner is five crawfish dinners.''

13
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:40,979
看，SB來了
Hey, here comes the shithead.

14
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:05,572
很清
It's clean.

15
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:07,908
很涼
It's cold.

16
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:11,313
那就是我所說的高質量的水。哦！
Now that's what I call high-quality H2O. Oh!

17
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:14,416
哦！正中腦袋！
Ooh! Right in the head!

18
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:18,319
球在那兒
It's over there!

19
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:26,326
在你那本傳奇的綠色本子裡有什麼魔法，Red？
any unused magic in that legendary green playbook of yours, Red?

20
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:30,932
雨天的時候
I may have a couple squirreled away in there...

21
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:34,635
我也許會把一對松鼠從那裡請出來
for a rainy day.

22
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,806
[players Yelling]

23
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,456
看我們拿到了什麼
See what we got here.

24
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:03,365
不是什麼有建設性的批評
- Not exactly what I'd call constructive criticism. - [Whistle Blowing]

25
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,568
- 想像下你在淋浴 - 哦！
- Smell like you could use a shower, stinky. - Oh!

26
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,872
聽著，你可以處理我的個人衛生
Listen, you-you could think what you want a-about my personal hygiene,

27
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:12,308
但請你不要浪費水
but, please, don't-don't waste any water.

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,978
那樣不對。如果你需要把你的 快樂建立在我的痛苦之上，
That-That's bad policy. If you need to amuse yourself at my expense,

29
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:19,049
那就來打我吧
just-just rough me up or something.

30
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,852
說得好
- Fair enough. - [Groaning]

31
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:25,223
- [Laughter] - [Sighing]

32
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:27,693
[Waterboy Mumbling]

33
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:30,894
Laski, 給我過來！
Laski, get over here!

34
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,563
來了，教練
- Yes, sir, Coach? - [Sighing]

35
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,966
那個SB在這幹嗎？哼，哼？
What is that moron doin' here? Huh, huh?

36
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:39,637
去年我沒清楚地跟你說過把那傢伙趕走嗎？
Didn't I tell you as plain as I could speak to get rid of his ass last year?

37
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:43,472
說過，先生，可我以為你不是認真的，教練。 話說回來，他活幹得不錯。
Yes, sir, but I didn't think you were serious, Coach. Besides, he does a great job.

38
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:46,708
來搞亂我的球隊，你傻了？
Disrupting my football team, you idiot?

39
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:50,179
18年已經足夠了
Eighteen years of this is enough!

40
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:52,916
嘿，茶水男孩！
Hey, Waterboy!

41
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:55,019
是，Beaulieu教練先生！
Yes, Mr. Coach Beaulieu!

42
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:58,288
你被解雇了！
You're fired!

43
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:00,625
好的
Okay.

44
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:08,702
[Man] Get out of the way, you moron!

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,739
* When I was just a little boy *

46
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:15,842
* I stood up to my daddy's knee *

47
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:20,247
* My papa said, son don't let the man get ya *

48
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:23,350
* and do what he done to me *

49
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:28,321
- * Born on the bayou * - Oh.

50
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,226
* Born on the bayou **

51
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:39,898
Bobby Boucher，來親媽媽一下
Bobby Boucher, come give your mama a kiss.

52
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:43,002
嗨，Steve
- Hi, Steve. - [Braying]

53
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:48,142
怎麼那麼早就回來了，我的天使？
Oh. Why you home so early, my precious angel?

54
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,745
媽媽，今天有點被
Mama, s-somethin' bad happened today.

55
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,582
有人傷害你，我的孩子？誰傷害了你？ 告訴媽媽誰傷害了你。
Somebody hurt you, my boy? Who hurt you? You tell Mama who hurt you.

56
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:57,985
沒人傷害我，媽媽。只是……
Nobody, Mama. It's just that...

57
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:01,690
我失去了球隊茶水員的工作了
I lost my position as the team's water distribution engineer.

58
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,423
什麼，那可是個好消息
Why, that's the best news I heard in a dog's age.

59
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:08,726
現在你就可以好好的呆在家裡
Now you be able to spend your days at home where you belong.

60
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,430
沒錯，可是——
Yes, but--

61
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:14,667
我想，媽媽，可能我——
I-I was-- I was thinkin', Mama, maybe I-I could--

62
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:18,672
我能到另外個球隊裡當茶水員
I could try to-to get another waterboy job for-for a different team.

63
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,508
跟我說話不用加大音量，Bobby Boucher。
Don't you raise your voice to me, Bobby Boucher.

64
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,310
我沒加大音量，媽媽
I-I wasn't rising my voice, Mama.

65
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:27,214
我不想爭。因為我是處男。
I don't like confrontation 'cause I'm a Virgo.

66
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,484
誰告訴你說你是處男？
Who told you you was a Virgo?

67
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,287
Vicki Vallencourt，那個女孩
Vicki Vallencourt, that-that-that-that girl.

68
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:37,291
女孩？
a girl?

69
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:41,196
Bobby Boucher！ 你忘了媽媽跟你說過的女孩是什麼了嗎？
Bobby Boucher! Don't you remember what your mama told you about girls?

70
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,599
我記得，媽媽
I remember, Mama.

71
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:48,837
早上在Wasser小溪的那個女孩真是可愛
a girl was so nice out at Wasser's Creek this morning.

72
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,675
- 真的嗎？ - 我們一起去看小龍蝦。她叫Vicki。
- Really? - We looked for crawfish together. Her name's Vicki.

73
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:55,510
我不想你跟那女孩再聯繫
I don't ever want you associatin' with little girls.

74
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:59,414
- 為什麼不，媽媽？ - 因為美女就是惡魔
- Why not, Mama? - Because little girls are the devil!

75
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:02,651
媽媽，就只是我是個茶水男孩
Mama, it-it's just that I'm a waterboy.

76
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,054
球員們感到口渴了，我就給他們送水
The team gets thirsty, and I bring them the water.

77
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,790
他們需要水，我也很樂意給他們遞水
They-They need the water, and I likes to be the one that brings it to them.

78
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:11,294
沒錯。可他們喜歡找你的茬
Yeah. They like to give you a boot in the patoot for all your trouble.

79
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:16,299
Bobby，你沒有他們所說的「社交技能」
Bobby, you don't have what they call ''the social skills.''

80
00:06:17,472 --> 00:06:21,505
人們不瞭解你。你沒有一個朋友， 除了你的媽媽，其中的原因就在於此
people don't understand you. That's why you never have any friends, except for your mama.

81
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:25,842
所有我所知的就是這樣，Jimmy： 下個禮拜五，就是8月29日， 在Baton Rouge展覽中心，
all I know is this, Jimmy: Next Friday, august 29, at the Baton Rouge Exposition Center,

82
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:28,777
我會讓Herculon發出痛苦的號叫，
I'm gonna open a can of whoop-ass on Herculon,

83
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,480
我會把他趕回老家去
and I'm gonna drive him back into whatever galaxy it is he came from.

84
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:34,250
我保證！
and that's a promise!

85
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:38,355
牛話出自牛人之口，他就是Insano上校
Strong words from a strong man, Captain Insano.

86
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,492
現在我們來接聽場外熱線。 我們的老朋友，來自傑克遜的Bayou先生
Now let's take a call. It's our old friend from Jackson's Bayou, Mr. B.

87
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:45,029
你好，Jim
Hello, Jim.

88
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:48,330
能跟Insano上校談談嗎？
I-Is it possible to speak to Captain Insano?

89
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:50,833
- 你好 - Insano上校，
- Shoot, Mr. B. - Captain Insano,

90
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,270
我注意到有時當你在摔跤
I notice sometimes when you are wrestling--

91
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:56,606
或是正如你所說的，在讓人發出痛哭號叫的時候
or-or openin' up a can of whoop-ass, as you like to say--

92
00:06:57,446 --> 00:07:00,111
- 你看起來流了很多汗 - 是嗎？
- you seem to be sweating quite profusely. - Yeah?

93
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,148
我想知道你是否，也許……
I was wondering if, perhaps, you might need...

94
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:06,417
需要個有經驗的茶水員為你服務
the services of an experienced waterboy.

95
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,521
真是可愛
[Chuckling] That's pretty cute.

96
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:12,055
你幾歲了，孩子？11歲，還是12歲？
How old are you, kid? Eleven, twelve?

97
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:14,024
我31歲了
I-I am 31 years old.

98
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,698
[Both Laughing]

99
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:26,538
我敢擔保，那傢伙還是個處男
[Captain Insano] I guarantee, that guy's still a virgin.

100
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:28,741
哦！哦，我的上帝啊！
Oh! Oh, my God!

101
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,847
[Laughing Continues]

102
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,516
[Engine Whirring]

103
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,939
* My mama said *

104
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,142
* That your life is a gift *

105
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,512
* and my mama said *

106
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,949
* This much weight you will lift *

107
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,154
* and my mama said leave those bad boys alone *

108
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,625
* and my mama said **

109
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,127
他們從我們這兒搶下球
This is where they strip the ball from us.

110
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:23,197
過了一個人，兩個人
and then we miss one tackle. There, two tackles.

111
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,001
Joey把球給丟了
Joey drops the ball.

112
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:29,336
哎呦，他還有時間把球再撿 起來，爭取來個觸地得分
Whoops, he has time to pick it up and dust it off and run in for a touchdown...

113
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,939
在我們的球員意識到之前
before our guys even know what's goin' on.

114
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,981
- [Sighing] - [Knocking]

115
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,784
- 你好 - 我叫Bobby Boucher
- Hello? - My name is Bobby Boucher.

116
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,355
我想打聽一下，對於你 們即將來臨的這個賽季
and I am inquiring as to whether you have the need for an experienced waterboy...

117
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,024
你們是否需要請個有經驗的茶水員
on your upcoming season.

118
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,560
衣服很漂亮
Nice suit.

119
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,196
謝謝。這是我爸爸的衣服
Thank you. I-I-I-It was my daddy's.

120
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,533
- 等等 - 好的
- Hold that thought. - Yeah.

121
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:59,235
噓……過來，來這兒
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Come on. Come here.

122
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,072
過來。大家都過來。
Come here. Come on. Come on, everybody.

123
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,974
- 很好，看這。這就是比賽。 - 好的
- all right, this is it. This is the play. - Okay.

124
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,044
這就是比賽。這就是比賽，嗯？
This is the play. This is the play. Okay?

125
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,449
這是四分衛。兩個接球者在左，一個在右。
The quarterback. Two receivers lined up to the left, one to the right.

126
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:14,052
側衛就在四分衛的左後方
There's a flanker lined up to the left behind the quarterback.

127
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:17,087
- 瞭解 - 他拿球——不，他不拿球
- Oh, okay. - He gives the ball-- No, he doesn't get the ball.

128
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,720
接球者想方設法跑到左邊來
The receiver goes all the way over there to the left.

129
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:24,191
一旦四分衛拿到球，他假裝向左
Once the quarterback has the ball, he fakes to the left.

130
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,496
步。他假裝向右。 他不用假裝。
No. He fakes to the right. He doesn't fake.

131
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:33,968
他考慮假裝。試著去假裝
He thinks about faking. He pretends to fake.

132
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,706
我不知道我在哪兒
I don't know where I am.

133
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,942
我無法呼吸
I can't breathe.

134
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:43,579
還是，空間變得越來越小。 我不得不坐下來。
Or, this room is getting smaller. I have to sit down.

135
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,483
靠在這兒。喝點水。
Hang on here. Take some water.

136
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:55,659
好的，給
all right, there.

137
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:03,935
真好。比我們喝的好多了
This is good. This is much better than what I serve.

138
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:11,041
- 那就是你拿來給你的球員們喝的水？ - 嗯
- That is the water that you serve to your players? - Uh-huh.

139
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:14,778
我認為你很有必要聘請我為你們的茶水員
It is imperative that you allow me to be your waterboy.

140
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,249
我不能請你。我不能請任何人——
I can't hire you. I can't hire anybody with the--

141
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:22,220
你不用付我工資。我免費服務。
You do not have to-- have to pay me. I-I will do it for free.

142
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:26,557
你只要保證不找人替換我就成
Just promise me that you will never distribute the contents of that jug to any human person.

143
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:31,196
- 成交 - 成交？
- That's a deal. - It's a deal?

144
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,668
非常感謝你，Klein教練。 我不會讓你失望的。
Thank you so-so much, Coach Klein. I-- I will not let you down.

145
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:37,738
- 再見 - 再見
- Good day. - Good day.

146
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:40,407
訓練時見
I-I-I'll see you at practice.

147
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:48,484

快停了。別太在意
Quit hoggin' that. pass it over.

153
00:11:14,648 --> 00:11:17,814
[Mumbling, Indistinct]

154
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:25,252
好的
Okay.

155
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,289
要後衛們跑得快點
Just have the defense run sprints.

156
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,594
[Mumbling Continues]

157
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:51,479
嘿！涼水更好。
Yo! Water's better cold.

158
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:56,117
是的，我同意。可是水需要淨化
Yes, I agree, but to guarantee that the H2O is-is purified,

159
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,421
加熱水源就是個好辦法
i-it's good to use the heating source, Sterno.

160
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,092
正如我媽媽常說的， 「安全第一。」
It's like my mama always says, ''Better safe than-than sorry.''

161
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:09,997
我媽也那麼說。 是不是所有的媽媽都這麼說呢？
My mama says that too. aren't all mamas the same?

162
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,635
- 是的 - 我叫Derek。我在這兒踢球
- Yes. - Derek. I kick the field goals around here.

163
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,105
你聽嗎？我需要你們的配合。我現在需要它
Will you listen up? I need your cooperation. I need it now.

164
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,876
他會變好嗎？
Is he gonna be-be all right?

165
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:24,380
會的。會的。他就是反反覆覆。
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He has his good days and his bad days.

166
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,950
他曾經是某所大足球學校的助理教練
Used to be an assistant coach at some big football school,

167
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:28,985
但是他有神經衰弱或是其它什麼的
but he had a mental breakdown or something.

168
00:12:29,523 --> 00:12:31,520
不用擔心，他會好的
Don't worry. He'll snap out of it.

169
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:34,456
- 記得告訴我水什麼時候涼下來，夥計 - 好的
- Let me know when it cools down, baby. all right. - Yes.

170
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,064

嘿，大伙注意到新來的茶水男孩了嗎？
Hey, did you all get a load of the new waterboy?

173
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,804
讓他感覺就像在家裡一樣。 Jerry，從右邊上
Let's make him feel right at home. Jerry, go right.

174
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:51,141
Casey，從左邊上
Casey, go left. Way left.

175
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,577
- 準備好了嗎？ - 來吧！
- On one. Ready? - [all] Break!

176
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:02,653
來了！紅色，22號！
Set! Red, 22!

紅色，22號！上！

- [Cheering] - [Laughing]

180
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:22,375
我想你應該在當需要轉彎的時候轉彎
I-I-I-I think you zigged when you should've zagged on that play.

181
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:26,545
- 對不起 - 嘿，茶水男孩，檢查一下這
- Sorry. - Hey, Waterboy, check this out.

182
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:33,587
[all Laughing]

[Laughing Continues]

184
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:49,901
嘿，茶水男孩！ 檢查一下這
Hey, Waterboy! Check this out.

185
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:54,976
- [Laughing] - [Grunting]

186
00:13:55,614 --> 00:13:57,346
- Yes. - [Grunting Continues]

187
00:13:57,915 --> 00:13:59,445
喔歐
Well, my, my, my.

188
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:03,083
我們的小引水工程師要毆打我的球員？
Was my little aquatic engineer about to bash one of my football players?

189
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,053
他朝冷卻器裡吐痰
Well, he spit in the c-c-cooler.

190
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:09,489
他是球隊的靈魂
He happens to be a finely tuned athletic machine.

191
00:14:10,362 --> 00:14:14,128
我不想他的頭被一些SB茶水男孩給傷了
and I ain't gonna have him hit in the head by some idiot waterboy.

192
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:18,064
明白我說什麼嗎？
[Echoing] Do you understand me?

193
00:14:18,904 --> 00:14:20,601
- 沒事吧？ - 什麼？我沒想怎麼，教練
- are you all right? - What? I wasn't gonna do nothin', Coach.

194
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:23,503
你應該做些事。你應該保護自己，孩子
Well, you better do something. You gotta defend yourself here, Bobby.

195
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:26,807
可他們是球隊的靈魂
But they're-they're-they're finely tuned athletic machines.

196
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:29,911
我不是叫你去挑起混亂
I am not telling you to go on a shooting rampage.

197
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:33,247
可你應該站在自己的立場， 要不會讓他們整個賽季都欺負你
But you have to stand up for yourself, or they're gonna ride you all season long.

198
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:36,485
相信我，我深有體會
Believe me, I've seen it myself.

199
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:44,826
嘿，SB！
Hey, moron!

200
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:51,099
嘿！SB！
Hey! Moron! Duh!

201
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:54,805
看看我，我是茶水男孩
[Imitating Bobby] L-Look at me. I'm the w-w-waterboy.

202
00:14:55,641 --> 00:15:00,007
我是最遲鈍的人
Duh! I got a wooden spoon. Duh!

203
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:04,813
看起來你需要淋浴，SB
Smell like you could use a shower, stinky. [Cackling]

204
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:08,750
你被解雇了！
You're fired! [Cackling]

205
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:12,959
[Both Laughing]

206
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,456
不要再嘲笑我
Stop makin' fun of me.

207
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:19,529
紅色，準備！開始！
Red, ready! Hut!

208
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:25,538
- Wow! - Damn!

209
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:27,606
[Mumbling]

210
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:33,943
不好意思
- I'm sorry. - [Groaning]

211
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:37,180
誰？是誰？
Who that? Who there?

212
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:43,487
那就是所謂的讓人開始號叫
So that's what openin' up a can of whoop-ass feels like.

213
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:47,424
孩子，你讓人號叫了
Son, you just opened a whole case of whoop-ass.

214
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,227
我希望你能加入我們的球隊
I would be honored if you play football for this team.

215
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,965
- 我？加入球隊？ - 是的
- Me? play football? - Yes.

216
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:58,702
謝謝，不過，我媽媽不讓我踢球
Thanks, but no thanks. My mama won't let me play no football.

217
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:02,539
我們一起回家去。 你和我，我們一起去跟你媽媽說
We're gonna go home. You and I, we're gonna talk to Mama.

218
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,676
媽媽說過——媽媽說過—— 我媽媽說過——媽媽說過——
M-Mama said-- M-Mama said-- My mama said-- Mama said--

219
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:09,313
- 我媽媽說過——我媽媽說—— - 她應該會說「同意」。
- My mama said-- My mama say that-- - She's gonna say yes.

220
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,657
[Zapper Buzzing]

221
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:24,228
這蛇看起來很美味
Mmm, that snake looks delicious.

222
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:27,264
你猜我會吃哪部分？
What part do you think I'm about to eat?

223
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:31,303
基本上蛇是不分部分的
Uh, basically a snake don't have parts.

224
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,672
可是，如果不得不說些什麼的話，
But, uh, if I had to call it anything,

225
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,810
我會說是它的膝部
I would say it's his knee.

226
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:40,680
很好。它的膝部。
Great. His knee.

227
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:44,918
那飯後吃些什麼甜點呢？
and what are we having for dessert?

228
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:48,524
[animal Chittering In Zapper]

229
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:50,590
- 是松鼠
- Squirrel. - [Squirrel Thuds]

230
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,127
很好
Excellent.

231
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,431
我們來談談Bobby踢球的事
Let's talk about Bobby playing football.

232
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:01,366
我不樂意，Klein教練 我很不樂意
I don't like it, Mr. Coach Klein. I don't like it one bit.

233
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,271
你看，我的孩子是那麼的脆弱 而不能踢「愚蠢的球」——
You see, my boy is too delicate to be playin' ''fool's ball''--

234
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:06,573
不論你稱其為什麼
or whatever you call it-- with them gargantuans.

235
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:08,909
我想你還不明白，Boucher太太
I don't think you understand, Mrs. Boucher.

236
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:11,445
不，是你不明白我的意思，Klein教練
No, you don't understand me, Mr. Coach Klein.

237
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,148
我就剩下這個兒子了
My boy is all I got left. Ow!

238
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:17,752
媽媽
- [Steve Braying] - Mama, here.

239
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,788
是頭痛，教練
It's the brain pain, Coach.

240
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:22,790
你知道的，我的丈夫Robert，
You see, my husband Robert,

241
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:26,460
1966年的一天回來了，拄著拐
one day back in 1966, pick up sticks,

242
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:30,266
那時我已經懷了這小天使四個多月了
and me four months pregnant with this precious angel.

243
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:33,069
他決定要去幫助那些外國人
He decides he wants to go and help the foreign peoples.

244
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,104
他跑去加盟了和平隊
He's gonna go and join the peace Corps.

245
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:37,306
他向我保證會沒事的
and he promise me that everything's gonna be okay.

246
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:40,176
正如你想我保證的那樣
Just like you promisin' me now.

247
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:43,046
可事情並不是那樣
But everything wasn't okay. No.

248
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,445
他在撒哈拉沙漠裡迷路了
He got lost in the middle of the Sahara Desert.

249
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:49,949
然後死了。 他死了！
and he died. He died!

250
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:55,220
- 沒有水，教練，他死於脫水。 - 我們只能自個生活下去
- Couldn't get no water, Coach. He died of the dehydration. - and we were left all alone.

251
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:59,860
我應該給我爸爸提供點水， 可那時我只是媽媽腹內的一個嬰孩
I would've gotten my daddy some water, but I was just a little baby inside Mama's stomach.

252
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,198
現在你想要奪取我的Robert唯一給我留下的血脈
and now you wanna take away the only part of my Robert I have left.

253
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:07,301
但是你不想讓你這唯一的血脈拿到大學學歷嗎？
But don't you want the only part you've got left to get a college education?

254
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:11,839
- 不。 - 我，一個大學生？
- Nah. - Me, a college student?

255
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:15,143
是的。Bobby，考慮一下
Yes. Bobby, think about it.

256
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:17,545
一個新的世界正向你敞開
a whole new world will open to you.

257
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,583
媽媽，聽起來不錯。我，我，一個大學生
Boy, Mama, that-that-that sounds nice. Me-Me, a college man.

258
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:22,985
教練，我的Bobby是個好孩子
Coach, my Bobby's a sweet boy,

259
00:18:23,524 --> 00:18:25,655
可他不是你所說的「上大學的料」
but he ain't exactly what you'd call ''college material,''

260
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:28,525
所以你不要往他簡單的思維裡灌輸那些瘋狂的
so don't you go fillin' his simple head with all those crazy dreams...

261
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:31,527
關於學校，大學，還有類似的夢
of school and college and things of that sort.

262
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:34,197
但是媽媽，我已經厭倦了人們叫我SB
But Mama, I-I'm tired of everybody callin' me a dummy.

263
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:37,433
我已經厭倦了沒有朋友
I'm-I'm tired of not havin' any friends.

264
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:40,736
我的屁股也厭倦了在這坐一整晚。 我要上床睡覺了。
and my ass is tired sittin' here jawin' all night. I'm goin' to bed.

265
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:44,673
很高興見到你，教練先生。 祝你的「傻球」隊好運
Nice to meet you, Mr. Coach. Good luck with your fool's ball.

266
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,845
Bobby，送走教練先生後，到我臥室來
Bobby, after you let Mr. Coach out, you come into my bedroom.

267
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,447
媽媽給你梳頭
Mamma'll brush your hair.

268
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,353
你知道嗎，我在你這個年紀的時候
- [Door Closes] - You know, when I was your age,

269
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:59,323
我媽媽叫我不要紋Roy Orbison
my mother told me not to get a tattoo... of Roy Orbison.

270
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:09,634
但瞞著媽媽就不會傷害到她
But what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

271
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,707
我相信你會做出正確的決定的
I trust you'll make the right decision.

272
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:22,517
* Oh, yeah *

273
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:25,987
* Huh I'm *

274
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,990
* Gonna get under your skin *

275
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:32,290
該死的，我可不想讓這SB加入球隊
- * Sooner or later * - Damn, I don't want that ass on the team.

276
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:34,526
每個人都會嘲笑我們的
Everybody's gonna laugh at us.

277
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:36,561
大家已經在嘲笑我們了
Everybody's already laughin' at us.

278
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:39,265
自1994年來我沒還沒贏過一次冠軍
We ain't won a game since 1994.

279
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,535
- 嘿！怎麼樣，夥計？ - 嗨
- * Sooner or later ** - Hey! What's up, baby? - Hey.

280
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:47,874
- 你的頭盔在哪兒？ - Derek Wallace，他們沒有多餘的頭盔
- Where's your helmet? - Derek Wallace, they-they don't got no more helmets.

281
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,077
看。我們可以共用一個
Here. You can share mine.

282
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,679
試一下，看看合適嗎
Try it on, man. See if it fits.

283
00:19:57,388 --> 00:19:59,586
- 不錯 - 謝謝，朋友
- all right. - Thanks, friend.

284
00:20:00,224 --> 00:20:02,822
不錯哦
- What a dink. - [Whistle Blowing]

285
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,459
過來！集中了！
Come on! Huddle up!

286
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:08,495
好，有件事要宣佈
- [Mumbling] - [Coach Klein] all right, we have an announcement to make.

287
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:12,500
我們原先的茶水男孩，Bobby Boucher， 將會成為我們球隊中的一員
Our former waterboy, Bobby Boucher, is gonna play some linebacker for us.

288
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:17,938
哦，我是個橄……橄欖球員了
[Imitating Bobby] Ooh, I'm a f-f-football player. [Grunting]

289
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:22,109
- 教練，我想馬上就把他擒抱住 - 不急
- Coach, I'd like to tackle him right now, please. - Not yet.

290
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,745
現在我將指導進攻和防守
all right, now I wanna work with the offence. I wanna work with the defense.

291
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:28,916
- 特殊的隊員，跟著Fran去跑圈 - Shit.
- Special teams, go with Farmer Fran, do some laps. - Shit.

292
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:31,522
[Farmer Fran Mumbling]

293
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,257
在球前列好隊
Line up on the ball.

294
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:41,728
- 來吧 - 好嗎？第三和十
- [Man] Let's go. - all right? Third and ten.

295
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:44,097
第三和十？
Third and ten?

296
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:49,604
是的，那是進攻的最終時機
Yeah, you know, that's the offense's last opportunity...

297
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:51,973
在他們踢懸空球之前，前進10碼
to gain ten yards before they have to punt.

298
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,975
Gee，他將要這做選項
Gee, he's gonna run the option.

299
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:55,977
選項？
Option?

300
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:58,647
他根本不能體會其中的意思，教練
- [Grumbling] - He ain't never gonna be able to figure this out, Coach.

301
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,649
他會的
Yes, he is.

302
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:05,287
聽著，Bobby，你已經當了18年的茶水員
Now, Bobby, you've waterboyed for 18 years.

303
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:07,589
你就沒偶爾看看比賽？
Didn't you occasionally watch the game?

304
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:10,458
哦，我一直很忙
Oh, I had a lot to k-keep me busy.

305
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:13,996
- 檢查水的PH值水平，往空杯裡再倒水 - 好吧
- Checking the pH levels, refillin' the cups. - all right.

306
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:16,464
那我們就簡單的說說
Well, then let's just keep it simple.

307
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,667
Casey。我要你擒抱Casey
Casey. I want you to tackle Casey...

308
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,371
就像你昨天對付Gee那樣
like you did Gee yesterday.

309
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:25,341
- 現在？ - 現在！來吧！
- Right now? - Right now! Go!

310
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:28,310
- 他知道嗎？ - 沒關係。你是個鬥士
- Does he know about this? - Doesn't matter. You're a warrior.

311
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,514
上
Go.

312
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:38,288
孩子，你在幹什麼？
- [Man] Boy, what you doin'? - [players Grumbling]

313
00:21:40,195 --> 00:21:42,593
停一下。Bobby，Bobby。
[Coach Klein] all right. Bobby, Bobby.

314
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:45,162
不要擔心你的發力，明白嗎？
Don't be afraid to use all of your strength, you know?

315
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:47,599
他有彈性。 他是個有彈性的傢伙
He's resilient. He's a resilient guy.

316
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:49,702
好嗎？上
Okay? Come on.

317
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,871
嘿，Casey，我想他想跟你親熱
[Man] Hey, Casey, I think he wanna make out with you.

318
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,174
好的，夠了。謝謝
- [Whistle Blowing] - Okay, that's enough. Thank you.

319
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:59,044
你看過什麼比賽嗎？有身體對抗的運動？
Is there any sport that you do watch? You know, a physical sport?

320
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,744
- 拳擊？曲棍球？ - 摔跤
- Boxing? Hockey? - Wrestling.

321
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,080
摔跤！摔跤很棒
Wrestling! Wrestling is good.

322
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:06,116
你最喜歡的摔跤手是誰？
Who's your favorite wrestler?

323
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,218
雖然他近來對我有點不太禮貌，
Well, even though he was slightly discourteous to me recently,

324
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:11,621
可我還是要說是Insano上校
I'm gonna have to say Captain Insano.

325
00:22:12,193 --> 00:22:15,058
好，好，我就是想要你
Okay, okay, I want you to do to Casey...

326
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:19,297
像Insano上校對付敵手時那樣對付Casey
what Captain Insano does to the bad guy.

327
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:21,800
上
Go.

328
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:28,407
嗷！嗷！
- Ow! Ow! - [players Gasping]

329
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,345
- 他戳我的眼睛 - Insano上校可不會這麼仁慈
- He poked me in the eye. - Captain Insano shows no mercy.

330
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:38,483
Bobby，我昨天看到的爆發是怎麼回事？
Bobby, where was the intensity that I saw yesterday?

331
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,453
那不是爆發！是你說反抗是應該的，
That was no intensity. You said it was all right to fight back,

332
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,324
然後我就開始想那些這些 年裡所有欺負我的傢伙們
and I-I just started thinkin' about all the people who-who'd been mean to me over the years.

333
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,396
就是了。就是了。
That's it. That's it.

334
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,864
我就是要你想想那些人
I want you to think about all those mean people.

335
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:56,202
- 他們就是你的處理燃料 - 處理燃料
- They're gonna be your tackling fuel. - Tacklin' fuel.

336
00:22:57,308 --> 00:23:00,373
- 就用它們來踢球 - 處理燃料
- We're gonna use them to play football. - Tacklin' fuel.

337
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,578
我要你把Casey當成……
I want you to pretend that Casey...

338
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:07,347
- 侮辱你的人 - 當成？
- is insulting you. - pretend?

339
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:11,185
我要你想像所有那些欺負你的人
I want you to visualize all those people that have been mean to you.

340
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:14,355
然後我要你去攻擊。 我要你先想像然後攻擊。
and then I want you to attack. I want you to visualize and then attack.

341
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,091
- 能行嗎？ - 我試試
- Can you handle that? - I'll try.

342
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,193
他要試試
He's gonna try.

343
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,638
怎麼了，小子？你傻到都不會
What's the matter with you, boy? You too s-s-stupid...

344
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:33,840
按你教練說的去做了嗎？
to do what your coach tells ya?

345
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,944
不！
- [Coach Laughing] - No!

346
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:40,048
不什麼？
- No what? - [Yelling]

347
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:44,889
[players Murmuring]

348
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:48,456
我不是有意傷害你的。是教練讓我幹的
I didn't mean to hurt you. Coach told me to pretend.

349
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:53,493
Bobby，Bobby！每場比賽你 都能這麼做嗎？能做到嗎？
Bobby. Bobby! Can you do this for me every single game? Can you do this?

350
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,431
教練，我不光能為你辦到
Coach, not only will I do it for you.

351
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,001
我，我，是的，是的， 我會辦到的
I-I-I-- Yes, yes, I'll do it for ya.

352
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:03,575
[Chattering]

353
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,276
那麼，嗯，你為什麼要選這門課？ 這門課很難。
So, uh, why you pick this class anyway? It's pretty hard.

354
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,812
哦，有美景
Oh, beautiful view.

355
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:14,650
沒錯
Correct.

356
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,686
好的，好的！
all right, all right!

357
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,922
你們都給我安靜下來！
Y'all shut up now!

358
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:23,826
上個禮拜，我們說到
Now, last week, we talked about...

359
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,529
動物大腦的生理
the physiology of the animal brain...

360
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,400
是有侵犯性的
as it pertains to aggression.

361
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,935
現在，有沒有人能告訴我為什麼
Now, is there anyone here that can tell me why...

362
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:36,239
多數的美洲鱷魚具有反常的侵犯性？
most alligators are abnormally aggressive?

363
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:39,476
- 我知道答案 - 舉手啊
- I know the answer to this question. - Raise your hand.

364
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:43,346
有誰知道？誰？是的，你，就是你
anybody? anyone? Yes, sir. You, sir.

365
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:48,784
媽媽說所有的鱷魚是心胸狹窄的
Mama says that alligators are ornery...

366
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:51,621
因為他們有牙齒但沒牙刷
'cause they got all them teeth but no toothbrush.

367
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:56,894
你媽媽說的，
[Chuckling] Yo mama said,

368
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,564
所有的鱷魚是心胸狹窄的， 因為他們有牙齒
alligators are ornery 'cause they got all them teeth...

369
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:03,066
但沒牙刷
and no toothbrush.

370
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:05,069
嗚哦！
Wow!

371
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:07,939
還有人要說嗎？好的，你來
anybody else? Yes, sir. You, sir.

372
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,475
鱷魚是好鬥的是因為有個擴大的延髓
alligators are aggressive because of an enlarged medulla oblongata.

373
00:25:12,348 --> 00:25:13,845
那是腦裡面控制侵犯性行為的部分
It's the sector of the brain which controls aggressive behavior.

374
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:17,581
- 正確！就是延髓。 - 可是媽媽說——
- That is correct! The medulla oblongata. - But Mama said--

375
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:20,786
延髓……
The medulla oblongata...

376
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:26,525
就是憤怒，嫉妒和侵犯性的來源
is where anger, jealousy and aggression come from.

377
00:25:27,598 --> 00:25:31,530
那現在有誰能告訴我快樂從何而來呢？
Now, is there anybody here can tell me where happiness comes from?

378
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:35,100
- 不要了，夥計 - 誰來？
- No, man. - anyone?

379
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:41,240
好吧，讓我們來聽聽看媽媽 對於這個問題的看法
all right, let's hear what Mama has to say on the subject.

380
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:46,779
媽媽說當你感到沮喪時，快樂 就會從陽光中的魔法光線而來
Mama say that happiness is from magic rays of sunshine that come down when you feelin' blue.

381
00:25:50,122 --> 00:25:53,487
好吧，孩子們，媽媽又錯了
Well, folks, Mama's wrong again.

382
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:57,158
不，Sanders老師，你錯了
No, Colonel Sanders, you're wrong.

383
00:25:57,663 --> 00:25:58,926
媽媽是對的！
- [Students] Ooh! - Mama's right.

384
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:03,230
你們都是錯的。 媽媽是對的，媽媽是對的。
You're all wrong. Mama's right. Mama's right!

385
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:06,134
他的延髓出了點問題
Somethin' wrong with his medulla oblongata.

386
00:26:06,742 --> 00:26:09,107

Mama's not a-a-a big fan of restaurants...

480
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,894
或是說不喜歡我去
or of-of me going to one.

481
00:31:57,601 --> 00:31:59,632
可要是你想去，有時候
But if-if you'd like, sometimes,

482
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,868
媽媽，她，嗯——她喜歡—— 星期天中午去——
Mama, she, uh-- she like to-- on a Sunday afternoon--

483

你知道嗎， 老女巫在早安美國節目上搞占星術
You know that old hag that does astrology on Good Morning America,

489
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,267
她真該停下來
she really ought to pack it in.

490
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:37,203
聽聽她關於人馬星的所說。她說：
Listen what she said for Sagittarius. She goes:

491
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,974
「你今天會遇到個困難的決定。」
''You're gonna be faced with a difficult decision today.''

492
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,344
可事實上，我們所有人每天 都要面對困難的決定
But the thing is-is-is, we're all faced with difficult decisions every day.

493
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,780
- 那就像說你今天要吃東西一樣 - 是的，也許吧
- That's like sayin' you're gonna eat today. - Yeah, m-maybe...

494
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:49,017
依靠發佈她那含糊和無用的預言，
by leaving her predictions vague and generalized,

495
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,987
人們很少會有機會發現她是個騙子
there's less of a chance of someone findin' out she's a phoney.

496
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,689
不論怎麼樣，大學生
Whatever, college boy.

497
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:58,027
- 不要說大學生。媽媽來了 - 哦，好的。
-Don't say college boy. Here comes Mama. -Oh, okay.

媽媽，Vicki是個占卜師
Mama, Vicki's an astrologist.

502

就我個人而言我不信那套
I don't believe in that sort of thing, personally.

503

天文學是惡棍許多武器中的一樣
astronomy is one of the many tools of the devil.

504
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:23,352
你昨天表現得真的很好，Bobby
You sure played great yesterday, Bobby.

Waterboy. Yeah, waterboy. He played-- He played waterboy great.

507
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:35,231
昨天球賽上
Everybody who was thirsty got a drink right away...

508
00:33:36,036 --> 00:33:38,067
每個口渴的人都及時解了渴
yesterday at the-- at the football game.

509
00:33:38,774 --> 00:33:41,605
愚蠢的球賽！一堆怪物相互撞來撞去
Fool's ball! Bunch of overgrown monsters manhandling each other.

510
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:44,408
記得那傢伙想讓你加入這 愚蠢的球賽嗎，Bobby？
Remember when that man wanted you to play fool's ball, Bobby?

511
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:48,111
是的，我——他—— Roy Orbison——
Yeah, I-- He-- Roy Orbison--

512
00:33:49,017 --> 00:33:51,181
Klein教練。我記得。
Coach Klein. I-I-I remember.

513
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:53,450
那麼，Bobby，他們抓到了 那從動物園裡跑出來
So, Bobby, did they ever catch that gorilla...

514
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:55,886
弄傷你眼睛的大猩猩了嗎？
what escaped from the zoo and punched you in the eye?

515
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,023
沒有，媽媽，他——他們還在找
No, Mama, he-- The-The search continues.

516
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,799
如果Bobby踢球你會怎麼想呢，Boucher太太？
What would you think if Bobby did play football, Mrs. Boucher?

517
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:10,936
我還沒考慮過
Well, I wouldn't think much of it at all.

518
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:13,705
跟你說實話吧， 我沒有考慮過你
and to tell you the truth, I don't think much of you...

519
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:16,942
和你那些無聊的問題，Vallencourt小姐
and all your snotty questions, Miss Vallencourt.

520
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:20,245
我對你對於我兒子那麼的感興趣感到很亂
I'm quite disturbed to see that you're so interested in my boy.

521
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:24,283
我對你兒子非常、非常感興趣，Boucher太太
I'm very, very interested in your boy, Mrs. Boucher.

522
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:26,485
- 真的嗎？ - 嗯
- Really? - Mm.

523
00:34:26,957 --> 00:34:28,821
那麼，他跟你說過他的腳有多臭嗎？
Well, did he tell you about how much his feet smell?

524
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:31,592
- 媽媽 - 他要穿兩雙襪子
- Mama. - He has to wear two pair of socks.

525
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,661
男人好像都有臭腳
Well, men are supposed to have stinky feet.

526
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,064
男人好像都穿印有
Well, are men supposed to wear pyjamas...

527
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,730
Deputy狗卡通圖案的睡衣嗎？
featuring a cartoon character by the name of Deputy Dog?

528
00:34:40,368 --> 00:34:42,566
- 媽媽，求你了 - 那麼，你知道什麼呢？
- Mama, please. - Well, you know what?

529
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:45,102
我覺得Deputy狗
I happen to find Deputy Dog to be...

530
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:49,105
非常、非常的性感
very, very sexy.

531
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:52,176
他跟你說過就寢時的一點小問題嗎？
Did he tell you about a little bedtime problem?

532
00:34:52,848 --> 00:34:55,980
- 媽媽，我求你了，不要說了 - 他的床單就在後面
- Mama, I'm beggin' you, don't. - That's his sheet back there.

533
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:00,786
不好意思，女士們，我到一邊站著去
lf you'll excuse me, ladies, I'm gonna go hang myself.

534
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:03,855
- 看看你都幹了些啥？ - 我做了什麼？
- Now you see what you done? - What I did?

535
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:07,127
你給我聽著，小姐。 我兒子生命中「唯一」的女人是我。
Now you listen here, cupcake. The "onliest" woman in my boy's life is me.

536
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:11,196
沒人可以把他帶走，尤其是 像你這樣不信神的毒婦人。
Nobody's gonna take him away, especially not some godless Jezebel like you.

537
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,867
哦，是的，可你的Bobby已經是個成年人了
Oh, yeah, well your Bobby is a grown man.

538
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:17,336
猜猜看？他已經可以處理誰才是他想要的人！
and guess what? He can hang out with whoever he wants!

539
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:20,106
哦，是的，他可以。 他想要誰都行，但除了你！
Oh, yes, he can. Whoever he wants. 'Cept you!

540
00:35:20,712 --> 00:35:23,543
Bobby，那女人是惡魔
Bobby, that-that woman is the devil.

541
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,014
- 我要你離開她，聽見我說的嗎？ - 是的，媽媽
- I want you to stay away from her, you hear me? - Yes, Mama.

542
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:29,317
現在在那女巫向我們施法咒之前給我進屋去！
Now you come on inside before that little ol' witch casts a spell on us!

543
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,956
對不起，Vicki Vallencourt
I'm sorry, Vicki Vallencourt.

544
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,797
不管怎麼樣
Whatever.

545
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:46,305
* lf you want it, you got it You feed it, you love it *

546
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,842
* Say that you need it You never-- **

547
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:55,877
當我們在運動中心節目裡報道 關於S.C.L.S.U.泥狗隊的比賽時， 我們已經習慣了失敗
When we report on the S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs here on Sportscenter, it's usually to add...

548
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:59,715
已經是持續的41連敗了
another number to their amazing losing streak, which now stands at 41.

549
00:36:00,587 --> 00:36:03,318
可是現在，Bobby Boucher 給了我們另外個理由
But now, Bobby Boucher has given us another reason.

550
00:36:04,124 --> 00:36:05,654
在上個週六泥狗隊最近的失利中，
In the Mud Dog's latest loss this past Saturday,

551
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:08,523
一個令人驚奇的31歲的新人 創造了一項N.C.A.A.的新紀錄
the amazing 31-year-old freshman set a new N.C.A.A. record...

552
00:36:09,229 --> 00:36:11,193
那就是單場成功地擒抱四分衛16次
by sacking the quarterback 16 times,

553
00:36:11,898 --> 00:36:13,662
打破了舊的7次的紀錄
shattering the old record of seven.

554
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:16,800
還有，哦，順便說一下， Bobby Boucher還是球隊的茶水男孩
and, oh, by the way, Bobby Boucher is also the team's waterboy,

555
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:19,302
當然，迴避了問題實質：
which, of course, begs the question:

556
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,604
他們在路易斯安那的
What exactly are they putting in the water...

557
00:36:22,143 --> 00:36:24,441
傑克遜河的水裡到底放了些什麼？
down in Jackson's Bayou, Louisiana?

558
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:29,049
* There is a house in New Orleans *

559
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,922
* They call The Rising Sun **

560
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:38,387
僵持在3平，還剩不到一分鐘的時間
[announcer] We're deadlocked at three with less than a minute to go.

561
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,124
我們是有著一個夢想的大家庭
[Coach Klein] We are one family with one dream.

562
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:43,294
你們是40個人的集體，不是個人
There are 40 of you on this team, not just one.

563
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:46,764
Bobby不能靠他自己一個人那麼幹。 現在到那去，去創造奇跡吧！
Bobby can't do this by himself. Now get out there and make something happen!

564
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:49,500
好吧，犧牲你們的個體。上，上，上！
- all right, sacrifice your bodies. Go, go, go! - [players Cheering]

565
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:53,504
謝謝。Bobby，你將要一個人這麼干
Thank you. Bobby, you're gonna have to do this by yourself...

566
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:56,306
因為隊裡沒有比你更強的人了
because there is nobody on this team that's any good.

567
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:59,076
聽著，我已經不能再忍受失敗了
Now look, I can't stand losing any more.

568
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:02,112
我們要贏得一場比賽。 你能給我們帶來奇跡嗎？
We've got to win one game. Can you go out there and make something happen?

569
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:04,181
- 設想然後進攻 - 好的
- Visualize and attack. - Yeah.

570
00:37:04,654 --> 00:37:05,851
- 設想然後進攻。 - 明白，明白
- Visualize and attack. please! - Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

571
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,421
靠你了！
- please! - [Mumbling, Indistinct]

572
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,724
中央肯塔基隊換下了他們第三道上的四分衛
[announcer] Central Kentucky's down to their third straight quarterback.

573
00:37:12,495 --> 00:37:14,426
好消息。第一列的四分衛，Tommy Gardner，
Good news, folks. First-string quarterback, Tommy Gardner,

574
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:16,662
脖子沒事

575
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,997
藍色，52號！ 藍色，52號！上！
Blue, 52! Blue, 52! Hut!

576
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,268
我禁止你跟那女巫說話。她是惡魔！
I forbid you to talk to that enchantress. She's the devil!

577
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:27,072
她不是惡魔。她是世上最美的女子。
She's not the devil. She's the most beautiful woman in the world.

578
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:30,873
- 我從沒說過她是惡魔 - 她是世上最美的女子。
- I never said she was the devil. - She's the most beautiful woman in the world.

579
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,344
哦，求你了，不要傷害我！
Oh, please, don't hurt me!

580
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:38,149
來啊！

你個瘋子！ 好啊，好啊，好啊！
You crazy man! Okay, okay, okay!

582
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:43,789
安全了！他們贏了，他們贏了，他們贏了！
It's a safety! They win, they win, they win!

583
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,158
依靠Boucher，連敗紀錄被終結了！
With the help of Boucher, the losing streak is over!

584
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:50,462
很抱歉，媽媽。請你原諒我。
I'm so sorry, Mama. please, forgive me.

585
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:53,765
我真的很愛你，媽媽。 我愛你。
I love you so much, Mama. I love you.

586
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:56,468
- 我也愛你 - 我們贏了！
- I love you too. - [Derek] We won!

587
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:00,073
我們贏了，夥計！ 晚上會有個大的派隊，你要來啊！
We won, baby! It's gonna be a big party tonight, and you're going!

588
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,576
- 我？派隊？ - 是的，夥計
- Me? party? - Yeah, baby!

589
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:06,184

謝謝。是我爸爸的
Thank you. It was my daddy's.

595
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:29,169
媽媽不知道我在這兒， 但我從冰箱裡拿來了： 路易斯安那的蛙餅。
Mama don't know I'm here, but I took these outta the icebox: Louisiana frog cakes.

596
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:32,007
謝謝
Thanks.

597
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:35,511
- 進來吧 - 嘿，Bobby Boucher！
- Come on in. - [Woman] Hey, Bobby Boucher!

598
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:38,513
看誰來了：小結巴
Look who's here: Sergeant Stutter.

- 來杯啤酒嗎？ - 我要蘇格蘭威士忌和水。蘇格蘭威士忌
- Want a beer? - I'll take a Scotch and water. Hold the Scotch.

600
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:45,654
- 你在開玩笑，Bobby？ - 是的
- You just make a joke, Bobby? - Yes, I did.

601
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:48,857
有趣
[Chuckling] Good one.

602
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,928
現在你們最終贏了場球，對吧， 你們感到輕鬆了，壓力沒了
Now that you finally won a game, right, you feel looser, the pressure is off,

603
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,029
那會使我們贏得更多的勝利
and that will lead to a lot more victories.

604
00:38:56,702 --> 00:39:00,201
- 是的，還有就是那個茶水男孩一場球 成功地擒抱四分衛20次。 - 那也是
- Yeah, that and a waterboy getting 20 sacks a game. - That too.

605
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,739
教授！
- professor! - [Gasping]

606
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,542
我們下週五還要考兩棲動物和昆蟲學知識嗎？
We still havin' that test on amphibians and reptiles next Friday?

607
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:12,113
是的。如果你方便的話
Yes, sir. That is, if it's all right with you.

608
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:17,051
- 當然了 - 我最尊敬你媽媽了
- Of course, it is. - My best regards to your dear mama.

609
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:20,356
我們跟茶水男孩談談
[Woman] Let's talk to the waterboy.

610
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:22,758
你今天在比賽中的表現真是驚人，Bobby
You played amazing at the game today, Bobby.

611
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:26,463
你真是可愛。你看上了哪個女孩了？
and you are so cute. Is there a girl you're seein'?

612
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:31,334
看？嗯，嗯，我看到許多女孩子。
Seein'? Uh, uh, I see a lot of girls.

613
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,270
我也看到很多男生
I see a lot of guys too.

614
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:36,773
我想那很性感
I think that's sexy.

615
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:39,375
你還沒見過一個男生和一個女生在一起吧？
You ever been with a guy and a girl at the same time?

616
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:41,479
哦，見過，好幾次了
Oh, yeah, plenty of times.

617
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:44,781
有天晚上，我就跟我媽媽和Klein教練同時在一起
The other night, I was with my mama and Coach Klein at the same time.

618
00:39:47,323 --> 00:39:50,388
你是個壞孩子。我希望你作我的男朋友
You are a bad boy. I wish you were my boyfriend.

619
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:54,858
哦，謝謝，可是，聽著， 有個女孩，Vicki Vallencourt
Oh, thank you, but, see, there's this girl, Vicki Vallencourt.

620
00:39:55,898 --> 00:39:57,528
她也許是個惡魔。媽媽是那麼說的
She may be the devil. Mama said that.

621
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,531
因此，我不被允許跟她聯繫
Consequently, I am prohibited from contact with her.

622
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,669
但是我希望有一天這能被解除， 因為跟她交談是很愉悅的。
But I hope to get past that one day 'cause she's nice to talk to.

623
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:09,279
[Mumbling, Indistinct]

624
00:40:13,084 --> 00:40:14,548

Oh, oh.

00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:01,392
今天我們這來了位特別來賓
Yo, we have a very special guest here today.

638
00:41:01,965 --> 00:41:05,764
讓我們用熱烈掌聲歡迎Bobby Boucher。 來吧，Bobby。
Let's have a warm L.T. welcome for Bobby Boucher. Come on, Bobby.

639
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:08,635
謝謝，Lawrence Taylor先生
- [Cheering] - Thank you, Mr. Lawrence Taylor.

640
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,138
告訴我，你有什麼秘訣？ 你怎麼能總是找到合適的位置？
Tell me, what is your secret? How do you find yourself in the right position all the time?

641
00:41:13,044 --> 00:41:14,508
這個問題問得好
That-That-That's a good question.

642
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:18,144
其實就是，先是在球場正中開球
What-What happens is, the-the-the centre has-has the ball first.

643
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,647
接著四分衛會喊「開球」
and-and-and the quarterback will say, ''Hike.''

644
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:24,284
當中鋒把球放到四分衛的手上
That's when the c-center puts the ball in-into the hands of the quarterback.

645
00:41:25,222 --> 00:41:27,653
那麼我所作的就是成功地擒抱四分衛
So what I do is, I-I start tacklin' the quarterback,

646
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:30,290
除非他把球分給別人，
unless he give the ball to-to s-somebody else,

647
00:41:30,896 --> 00:41:33,394
無論如何，我都會盡力擒抱那傢伙
in which case, I-I try to tackle that person.

648
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,966
嗯？孩子們，我接著想說的是：
Hmm? Gentleman, which brings me to my next point:

649
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,402
不要迷信高手
Don't smoke crack.

650

651
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:55,082
Vicki Vallencourt。你在幹什麼呢？
Vicki Vallencourt. What you doin' here?

652
00:41:56,156 --> 00:41:58,287
哦，沒什麼。
Oh, nothin'. I was just thinkin'...

653
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:01,657
只是在考慮怎麼偷到那邊那輛寶時捷
about stealin' L.T.'s Porsche over there.

654
00:42:02,495 --> 00:42:05,894
但是我想我應該在把你和你媽媽 之間關係鬧僵前離開
But I suppose I ought to be movin' on before I get you in trouble with your mama.

655
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:10,800
嗯，Klein教練說過只要 媽媽不知道就不會傷害她了
Well, Mr. Coach Klein said that what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

656
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:15,704
所以也許我們可以一塊兒回去
So maybe we could ride home together.

657
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,808
- 真的嗎？ - 如果你願意
- Really? - lf you'd like to.

658
00:42:20,713 --> 00:42:22,777
好
[Giggling] Okay.

667
00:43:02,726 --> 00:43:04,223
如果你願意，你可以坐下
You can sit down, if you'd like.

668
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:06,797
[Braying Continues]

669
00:43:07,494 --> 00:43:09,558
Vicki Vallencourt，我認為……
Vicki Vallencourt, I figured...

670
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,262
因為你對占卜術和像那 一樣神奇的東西感興趣
'cause you're interested in astrology and mystical stuff like that,

671
00:43:14,169 --> 00:43:16,033
你也許會喜歡這個的
you might appreciate this.

672
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:21,004
那是來自阿拉斯加冰河的水
That's water from a glacier in Alaska.

673
00:43:21,843 --> 00:43:25,408
它是被一個愛斯基摩法師祝福過的
It-It was blessed by a-an Eskimo medicine man.

674
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:31,014
- 它很冷！ - 是的，他一直很冷。那就是它的特別之處。
- It's cold! - Yes, it's always cold. That's why it's so special.

675
00:43:47,939 --> 00:43:50,337
那，那，那是我——
That-That was-- That-That-That-That happened--

676
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:54,507
是我第，第一次用嘴唇……
That-That happened to be my-my first time with-with lips...

677
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:58,543
還有，還有，還有舌，舌頭
and-and-and-and-and and-and-and-and-and the-the tongue.

678
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:02,414
那是你的舌頭。我相信
That was your tongue. I-- I believe it was--

679
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:04,950
我以前從沒做過
I never did that before.

680
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:06,987
那麼，如果這是你的初吻，
Well, if that was your first kiss,

681
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:10,724
那我猜你也是第一次看到這些
then I bet it's the first time you've seen a pair of these.

682
00:44:13,932 --> 00:44:16,864
是的，是的。那對我來說又是個第一次。
Yes, yes, that is a-another first for me,

683
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:21,068
我很喜歡現在你正向我所展示的
and I-I appreciate what-what-what you're showin' me right now.

684
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:24,210
[Snoring Continues]

685
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,408
Vicki-Vicki Vallencourt，我想媽媽起來了
Vicki-Vicki Vallencourt, I-I think Mama's up.

686
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:33,012
惡魔，惡魔，惡魔
[Mumbling] Devil, devil, devil.

687
00:44:33,786 --> 00:44:35,950
你最好走吧
You better get goin'.

688
00:44:38,324 --> 00:44:41,723
天哪，Bobby，我想，有些時候， 我真不知道我為什麼要去打擾你
My God, Bobby, I mean, sometimes, I just don't know why I bother with you.

689
00:44:42,729 --> 00:44:44,560
你甚至不能算是個男人
You ain't even a man.

690
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:51,399
看起來S.C.L.S.U.泥狗隊這灰姑娘，
[announcer] It looks like the Cinderella S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs,

691
00:44:52,304 --> 00:44:54,034
依靠Bobby Boucher，這後衛的領導
led by linebacker Bobby Boucher,

692
00:44:54,606 --> 00:44:57,504
會繼續贏得勝利
are gonna fall one victory short of that Bourbon Bowl bid.

693
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:00,942
愛荷華隊會依靠20碼的射門得分贏得比賽
Iowa could win the game by nailing this 20-yard field goal.

694
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:03,879
是的，可是泥狗隊的球踢得很有激情
Yeah, but the Mud Dogs have played a sensational football game.

695
00:45:04,584 --> 00:45:08,149
我們來看看Boucher的上次進攻路線
Let's take a look at the way Boucher entered the Hawkeyes' last drive.

696
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,888
我們看到Boucher立即衝了上去
Here we see Boucher instantly penetratin' the pocket.

697
00:45:12,764 --> 00:45:14,395
[Grunting]

698
00:45:14,928 --> 00:45:17,659
眼神中有著許多的痛苦和憤恨
There's a lot of pain and shame in those eyes.

699
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,828
朋友們，一切結束了
Friends, it's all over.

700
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,065
- 我的腳！ - 哇，真是難以置信
- [Man] My leg! - Wow, that is a disturbing image.

701
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:25,802
不看不知道，Chris
Difficult to watch, Chris. [Exhales]

702
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,638
嗚！我的神啊！
Whoo! My God!

703

繼續發威吧！
Gonna kick some names and take some ass!

Bobby！
Bobby!

705
00:45:36,284 --> 00:45:38,882
喝點水。給他力（一種運動飲料）比較好。
Water sucks. Gatorade is better.

706
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,885
- 什麼？ - 在球場上去發揮吧
- What? - Use it on the field.

707
00:45:42,624 --> 00:45:44,755
茶水男孩，茶水男孩，茶水男孩！
[Crowd Chanting] Waterboy, Waterboy, Waterboy!

708
00:45:52,935 --> 00:45:56,667
給他力不光能更好的解你的渴， 而且味道更佳，你這SB
Gatorade not only quenches your thirst better, it tastes better, too, idiot.

709
00:45:57,739 --> 00:46:00,137
你喝錯飲品了
You're-You're-You're drinkin' the wrong water.

710
00:46:00,908 --> 00:46:04,006
- 給他力 - 水
- Gatorade. - H2O.

711
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:08,410
- 給他力 - 水
- Gatorade! - H2O!

712
00:46:09,422 --> 00:46:12,889
* Water sucks, It really, really sucks Water sucks *

713
00:46:13,956 --> 00:46:16,654
不要再唱了。不要。你是個壞人。
- * It really, really sucks ** - Stop saying that. You don't mean that. You're bad people.

714
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:27,305
[Bobby Whimpering]

715
00:46:36,011 --> 00:46:38,075
我的朋友，Chris
- [Cheering] - [announcer] and my friend, Chris,

716
00:46:38,781 --> 00:46:41,145
泥狗隊進軍波旁碗體育館的比賽了
the Mud Dogs are goin' to the Bourbon Bowl.

717
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:46,619
依靠昨天的勝利，S.C.L.S.U.泥狗隊
With yesterday's come-from-behind victory, the S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs...

718

在波旁碗體育場舉行的決賽
in the first annual Bourbon Bowl.

720
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,961
但是不光是茶水男孩改變了S.C.L.S.U.的格局
But not only has the waterboy changed S.C.L.S.U.'s fortunes,

721
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:57,664
還有其他的球隊出現了類似的天才
he's got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent.

722
00:46:58,336 --> 00:47:01,001
就在昨天，在密歇根，被受傷破壞了
In fact, yesterday, Michigan, devastated by injury,

723
00:47:01,873 --> 00:47:03,870
他們的毛巾男孩更大的發揮
experimented with their towel boy at wide receiver.

724

毛巾男孩上了傷病大名單

You know, when I see so many of you here tonight,

We must be a little lost. We're tryin' to get to the Bourbon Bowl.

751
00:49:16,545 --> 00:49:19,009
看起來會在美國的Retardville結束
Looks like we ended up in Retardville, U.S.A.

752
00:49:22,852 --> 00:49:26,117
嘿，茶水男孩，你想要擒抱我們隊裡所有的人嗎？
Hey, Waterboy, you fixin' to tackle all of us?

753

- Kick his water-lovin' ass, Greg. - I asked you a question, dumb ass.

你再出聲，我就讓你的腦袋搬家
You even exhale, and I will saw your head off.

You can do it! Cut his fucking head off!

等等，等等。就一會兒。 出了什麼事啊，甜心？
Hold it, hold it. Just a minute. Now what is the problem here, honey?

Right, Klein?

是的，你的球隊表現得像堆狗屎
[Vicki] Yeah, well, your team actin' like a bunch of shitheads.

760
00:49:55,418 --> 00:49:59,684
路易斯安那大學裡沒多 少人會認同你的行為的
This is not how ambassadors for the University of Louisiana are supposed to act.

可是，用危險的武器攻擊人
However, assault with a deadly weapon,

763
00:50:10,066 --> 00:50:11,963
是十分、十分嚴重的攻擊
very, very serious offence.

764
00:50:12,602 --> 00:50:16,001
警官，讓她清醒點
Officer, get her little country ass outta here.

765
00:50:17,008 --> 00:50:19,206
謝謝你，Vicki
- [Crowd Murmuring] - Thank you, Vicki.

766
00:50:19,878 --> 00:50:22,042
我們走
Let's go.

767
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:26,545
啊！茶水男孩！
ah! It's the waterboy!

768
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:29,150
我有些東西要給你
I got something for you.

769
00:50:29,654 --> 00:50:33,386
這是他的成績單，來自南拉斐特高中
This is his transcript from South Lafayette High School...

770
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:36,190
在路易斯安那的切羅基平原
in Cherokee plains, Louisiana.

771
00:50:36,795 --> 00:50:38,659
可現在的問題是
Now, the problem with that...

772
00:50:39,264 --> 00:50:43,263
在路易斯安那的切羅基平原沒有南拉斐特高中
is there ain't no South Lafayette High School in Cherokee plains, Louisiana.

773
00:50:44,403 --> 00:50:47,768
所以很明顯，這是偽造的！
- So obviously, this is a fake! - [Crowd Gasping]

774
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:51,905
但是，這份卻不是偽造的
However, this is not a fake.

775
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:54,976
這是來自N.C.A.A.的
This is from the N.C.A.A.

776
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:57,612
他們認為你不應該再打橄欖球了
They don't think you ought to play football no more.

777
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:01,817
那麼允許我再次對你這麼說：
So allow me to say this to you one more time:

778
00:51:02,455 --> 00:51:03,952
你被解雇了
You're fired.

779
00:51:04,457 --> 00:51:06,855
哦，不！我們被欺騙了！
Oh, no! We suck again!

780
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:10,394
見過總冠軍戒指嗎？
Ever see a championship ring?

781
00:51:11,232 --> 00:51:13,963
- 不要再奢望冠軍了。走吧，Laski - 你沒上過高中？
- Don't be messin' with the champ. Come on, Laski. - You didn't go to high school?

782
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:17,367
我是在家裡學習的。我認為我不需要——
I was home schooled. I-I didn't know I needed--

783
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,605
- 偽造假的成績單 - 不，不，我沒有
- Forged a fake transcript. - No, no, I-I-I didn't.

784
00:51:22,677 --> 00:51:24,808
茶水男孩是個騙子。把他的頭砍下來
- The waterboy's a cheater. Cut his head off. - [Crowd agreeing]

785
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:28,479
大家聽著！這並沒改變什麼啊！
Listen, everybody! This don't change nothin'!

786
00:51:29,384 --> 00:51:31,882
我們比賽時是個球隊，勝利了還是個球隊
We played as a team, we won as a team.

787
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:34,283
就只因為茶水男孩是個騙子
and just because the waterboy's a cheater,

788
00:51:34,854 --> 00:51:37,052
事實並沒有改變什麼——真正的泥狗隊
don't change the fact that the real Mud Dogs...

789
00:51:37,757 --> 00:51:39,688
會戰勝所有的敵手
are gonna kick some Cougar ass.

790
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:42,123
泥狗隊！泥狗隊！
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

791
00:51:42,696 --> 00:51:46,395
泥狗隊！泥狗隊！泥狗隊！泥狗隊！
[Together] Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

792
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:50,599
泥狗隊！泥狗隊！泥狗隊！泥狗隊！泥狗隊！
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

793
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:54,570
泥狗隊！泥狗隊！泥狗隊！ 泥狗隊！泥狗隊！泥狗隊！
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

794
00:51:55,475 --> 00:51:56,972
那就是了！
- That's the way! - [Cheering]

795
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:06,050
抱歉，Bobby
Sorry, Bobby.

796
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:12,262
* Oh, what a lonely boy *

797
00:52:13,361 --> 00:52:16,159
相信我，我知道
Believe me, I-I understand.

798
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:18,963
是的，你盡力了，Dodd先生
Yeah, and you're deeply appreciated, Mr. Dodd.

799
00:52:19,635 --> 00:52:22,366
非常感謝。再見
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

800
00:52:23,204 --> 00:52:24,934
好消息，Bobby
Good news, Bobby.

801
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:28,240
- N.C.A.A.允許你去參加波旁碗體育場的比賽了 - 知道
- The N.C.A.A. is gonna allow you to play in the Bourbon Bowl. - Yes.

802
00:52:29,078 --> 00:52:30,808
你只要通過個跟高考類似的考試就行了
You just have to pass the high school equivalency test.

803
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:34,045
這不是考試的問題，教練
It's not the test, Coach.

804
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:37,382
所有人都討厭我
Everybody hates me.

805
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:41,019
不對
That's not true.

806
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:44,357
有個人說他會欣賞我的
One man said he wanted to decapitate me.

807
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,160
可不會有其他人會那麼認同的
Nobody else thought that to be too bad of an idea.

808
00:52:51,837 --> 00:52:53,668
他們認為我是個騙子
Somebody made me look like a-a-a cheater.

809
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:57,070
是我幹的，是我幹的，是我幹的！
I did it. I did it. I did it! I did it! I did it!

810
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,973
- 是我 - 為什麼？
- It was me. - Why?

811
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:09,282
因為是我要你打球的。 因為你是我擺脫困境的希望，Bobby
Because I wanted you to play. Because you were my way out, Bobby.

812
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:12,885
因為那也是唯一的能讓你打球的辦法
'Cause it was the only way to get you in.

813
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,721
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

814
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:18,525
那你為什麼不為我辯護呢？
Why didn't you s-stick up for me down by the river?

815
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:25,298
事實上我逃避了
The truth is, I fled.

816
00:53:26,205 --> 00:53:28,336
我逃回辦公室，躲到桌下，我哭了
I came into my office, I went under my desk, I cried.

817
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:31,705
我哭了，哭得就像個10歲的姑娘！
I cried. I cried like a ten-year-old girl!

818
00:53:32,516 --> 00:53:34,181
[Groaning]

819
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:41,215
Red和我有段恩怨
Red and I have a history.

820
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,450
20年前，在路易斯安那大學
Twenty years ago, we were assistants to Coach Cavanaugh...

821
00:53:44,023 --> 00:53:46,721
我們都是Cavanaugh教練的助理
at the University of Louisiana.

822
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:50,325
Red執行訓練，我制訂戰術
Red ran the practices, and I used to come up with the plays.

823
00:53:52,532 --> 00:53:54,162
哦，孩子，我可是很棒的
Oh, boy, was I good.

824
00:53:56,369 --> 00:54:00,135
我會把簡單的戰術演練寫在我那綠色的記事本上
I would write these foolproof plays in my little green notebook that I had.

825
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:03,672
對手甚至不知道怎麼被打敗的
- The opposition didn't even know what hit 'em. - [Door Knocking]

826
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,907
那時Cavanaugh教練就要退休了
and when Coach Cavanaugh was going to retire,

827
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:09,143
我和Red，我們都明白我們中的一名會成為繼任者
me and Red, we just knew that one of us was gonna be his successor.

828
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:12,487
** [Disco]

829
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:15,084
- 嘿，Red - 你會怎麼做？
- Hey, Red. - How ya doin'?

830
00:54:17,592 --> 00:54:19,322
來祝福我嗎？
Come by to wish me luck?

831
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:24,294
不完全是，不，不。 實際上，我是來請你幫忙的
Well, not exactly, no, no. actually, I come by to get you to do ol' Red a little favor.

832
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:27,262
沒問題。怎麼了？
Sure. What's up?

833
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:30,966
你知道在綠色的記事本上有所有的球隊戰術？
Well, you know that green notebook you use to write all them football plays in?

834
00:54:31,871 --> 00:54:35,236
嗯，我需要向Cavanaugh展示我有些好的戰術想法
Well, I need to show Cavanaugh that I can come up with some good play ideas.

835
00:54:36,243 --> 00:54:38,541
可是你沒有做些什麼
But you didn't come up with them.

836
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:41,844
這都是我做的。我需要它們
They're my plays. I need them.

837
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:47,050
Klein，無論如何我都會得到這本東西的
Klein, I'm gonna have this book one way or another,

838
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:50,587
所以你最好合作點，因為如果你不合作，
so you might as well let the damn thing go, 'cause if you don't,

839
00:54:51,293 --> 00:54:53,457
我就會對你不客氣，不客氣
it's gonna get awfully, awfully physical around here.

840
00:54:54,162 --> 00:54:56,960
我想你也不想那樣吧？是吧？
and I don't think you want that, do you? Huh?

841
00:54:59,172 --> 00:55:01,037
[Cackling]

842
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:05,034
當然了，Red成了教練。 第二天，我被解雇了。
Of course, Red got the job. Next day, fired me.

843
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,738
一旦他擁有了我的記事本，他就不再需要我了
Once he had my notebook, he didn't need me any more.

844
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:12,043
我很不好受
I didn't take it very well.

845
00:55:12,614 --> 00:55:15,479
不，奶奶，我沒成功
No, Grandma, I didn't get it.

846
00:55:16,286 --> 00:55:18,117
我自己都不相信
I can't believe it myself.

847
00:55:18,754 --> 00:55:22,520
我知道。我麻木了
I know. I'm so numb.

848
00:55:23,592 --> 00:55:25,556
我恨他，我恨他，我恨他！
I just hate him, I hate him, I hate him.

849
00:55:27,964 --> 00:55:29,961
真是個悲慘的故事，教練
That is a terrible story, Coach.

850
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:33,199
- 但是你為什麼不再想些新的戰術呢？ - 我試過
- But why-why don't you just come up with some new plays? - I tried.

851
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:35,469
- 可是不行 - 哦
- I can't. - Yes.

852
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:40,140
我想我是有心理障礙，你知道的， 自從Red奪走了我的記事本和我的男子氣以來
I guess I have a mental block, you know, ever since Red took my playbook and my manhood.

853
00:55:41,378 --> 00:55:44,176
我知道他想要幹什麼！
I knew what he was gonna do!

854
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,314
可是我沒有抵抗
and I just didn't fight back.

855
00:55:48,049 --> 00:55:51,014
你會在星期六向他展示你就是個男人
Well, you're gonna show him that you're a man on Saturday.

856
00:55:53,689 --> 00:55:55,153
我也會向所有人表明我不是個騙子
and I'm gonna show everybody that I'm not a dummy.

857
00:55:55,725 --> 00:55:58,256
我要去學習了
I'm gonna go study.

Mama, maybe you could stop brushin' my hair so I can read.

860
00:56:08,205 --> 00:56:09,902
讀書？
Read?

861
00:56:10,474 --> 00:56:12,872
你不用讀書的
You don't have to read.

862
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:18,577
- 你讀書為了什麼？ - 因為我喜歡，媽媽
- What you readin' for? - 'Cause I enjoys it, Mama.

863
00:56:19,484 --> 00:56:22,249
我看來你一直坐在那兒是很不痛快的
Don't look like to me you enjoys it, sittin' there all grouchy.

864
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,653
媽媽，我今天除了讀完這本還有6本 書要讀，否側我就不能打橄欖——
Mama, I gotta read this book and six other books tonight, or else I can't play foot--

865
00:56:31,697 --> 00:56:33,194
球
ball.

866
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:36,965
蠢人球？你瞞著我去打蠢人球？
Fool's ball? You playin' the fool's ball behind my back?

867
00:56:38,003 --> 00:56:40,000
我這麼做的唯一原因是我能夠上學
The only reason I'm doin' this so, so I can go to school.

868
00:56:40,638 --> 00:56:44,203
上學？你要上學？
School? You goin' to school? [Screams]

869
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,174
對不起，媽媽。我應該跟你說的
- [Steve Braying] - Sorry, Mama. I wanted to tell you.

870
00:56:47,847 --> 00:56:51,312
你在學校跟你那些玩蠢人球的朋友快活，
You off gallivantin' with your fancy fool's ball friends at school,

871
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,051
而我每天就一個人孤單的坐在這裡， 只有Steve這匹馬在這陪我？
while I'm sittin' here all day with nobody to keep me company, except Steve?

You reap the fruit of your selfish ways.

874
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:07,129
你會失去你的隊友
You're gonna lose all your fancy fool's ball games...

Everything is the devil to you, Mama!

Well, I like school, and I like football!

是由於它們的延髓！

You go play fool's ball with your friends.

1023
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:33,479
歡迎收看ABC台在波旁碗體育場的報道
[Man] Welcome to ABC's coverage of the Bourbon Bowl.

1024
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,915
大家下午好，我是Brent Musburger， 在一旁的是我的同事，Dan Fouts
Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Brent Musburger, along with my colleague, Dan Fouts.

1025
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:40,685
現在這兒最大的新聞，Dan， 就是比賽失去了一位很重要的明星
and the big story here, Dan, is a game that's lost some of its luster...

1026
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,488
他就是茶水男孩Bobby Boucher
without its star player, the waterboy Bobby Boucher.

1027
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:47,493
你知道，Red會順利地取得勝利
You know, Red's got a couple of solid early rounders out there.

1028
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:51,063
我知道，可我真想看看那個茶水男孩。 讓我想起了Greg Lloyd
I know, but I really wanted to scout that waterboy. Reminds me of Greg Lloyd.

1029
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,799
- 不。是「六便士」 Thomas - 無所謂拉
- Naw. ''Zack'' Thomas. - Whatever.

1030
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:55,869
搞好了嗎？
- Is she ready? - [Clattering]

1031
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:58,538
好了
Oh, yeah. She's more than ready.

1032
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:02,441
快來，Bobby！ 你要遲到了！
Come on, Bobby! You'll miss the boat!

1033
01:08:07,118 --> 01:08:08,582
我們出發，女士們！
Let's go, ladies.

1034
01:08:12,264 --> 01:08:14,129
[Whistle Blowing]

1035
01:08:14,694 --> 01:08:16,224
比賽開始了
[Musburger] We are underway!

1036
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:18,760
這球開得真是棒！
The opening kickoff is a beauty!

1037
01:08:22,335 --> 01:08:24,466
防守球員在9碼區把球接住了
Holdsworth is gonna bring it out from nine yards deep.

1038
01:08:25,138 --> 01:08:26,368
加油
- Come on. - [Grunting]

1039
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,566
好！
- Yeah! - [Grunting, Groaning]

1040
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:32,704
Dan，看起來沒有Boucher那支球隊不行了
Dan, they're showing no respect for this team without Boucher.

1041
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:36,307
沒錯，Brent。109碼無人觸及
[Fouts] Good reason, Brent. 109 yards untouched.

1042
01:08:37,148 --> 01:08:39,179
美洲獅隊觸地得分！率先得分！
- [Cheering] -Touchdown, Cougars! They strike first.

1043
01:08:41,525 --> 01:08:43,357
[Yelling, Shouting]

1044
01:08:46,858 --> 01:08:48,455
第一節結束
- [Whistle Blowing] -Time running down in the first quarter.

1045
01:08:49,027 --> 01:08:50,757
美洲獅隊17:0領先
Cougars lead is 17-0.

1046
01:08:53,131 --> 01:08:54,695
準備！
Set!

1047
01:08:55,233 --> 01:08:56,730
3號！33號！
Three! Thirty-three!

1048
01:08:57,235 --> 01:09:00,100
3號！33號！上！
- [Growling] - Three! Thirty-three! Hut!

1049
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:05,006
Dan，四分衛根本拿不到球
Dan, that quarterback can't even get the ball off before he's hit.

1050
01:09:05,678 --> 01:09:07,375
他可是進攻的核心
It's as if they're in the offensive huddle with him.

1051
01:09:07,954 --> 01:09:11,020
- [Laughing] - [Muttering]

1052
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:13,783
你是不是要把這塊熱狗吃完，Jimmy？
are you gonna finish that hot dog, Jimmy?

1053
01:09:14,387 --> 01:09:16,184
啊！現在不了
Ugh! Now I'm not.

1054
01:09:16,756 --> 01:09:19,087
媽媽，你想我們能準時到嗎？
[Bobby] Mama, you think we'll make it on time?

1055
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:22,858
放心！我讓你看看我所學到的技術
Hang on! I'll show you what A.J. Foyt taught me.

1056
01:09:27,701 --> 01:09:29,865
半場休息時間到。美洲獅隊完全領先
[Musburger] That's the end of the half. The Cougars are dominating.

1057
01:09:30,538 --> 01:09:33,636
希望泥狗隊能做些調整
Let's hope the Mud Dogs can make some adjustments.

1058
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:36,039
- 希望吧，他們沒救了 - 嗯
- Well, they better, 'cause they suck. - Mm-hmm.

1059
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,146
誰有主意了？
anybody got an idea?

1060
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,287
嘿
Hey.

1061
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:55,791
還記得Bobby那次錯把裁判給擒抱了嗎？
- Remember the time Bobby tackled the referee by mistake? - [Chuckling]

1062
01:09:56,798 --> 01:09:58,662
記得，那真是好笑啊
Yeah, that was pretty funny.

1063
01:09:59,234 --> 01:10:01,098
那麼擒抱那來自路易斯維爾的傢伙
How about the time he tackled the guy from Louisville...

1064
01:10:01,737 --> 01:10:03,935
然後把他扔了個倒栽的那次嗎？
- and threw him into the stands? - [all Laughing]

1065
01:10:06,308 --> 01:10:10,074
你們都記得他那次截球時褲子掉了嗎？
Y'all remember when he intercepted the ball and his pants fell off?

1066
01:10:11,146 --> 01:10:13,777
然後光著屁股完成了觸地得分
and then he ran for the touchdown, bare-assed.

1067
01:10:16,618 --> 01:10:19,983
還記得Bobby那次……
Remember the time Bobby-- [Mumbling incoherently]

1068
01:10:26,596 --> 01:10:29,528
記得Bobby Boucher在下半場出場， 然後泥狗隊在波旁碗體育場贏得了勝利嗎？
Remember when Bobby Boucher showed up at halftime and the Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl?

1069
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,505
[Cheering, Shouting]

1070
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:40,606
嘿，真是很對不起
Hey, sorry about givin' you so much shit this year.

1071
01:10:41,611 --> 01:10:43,375
你是這支球隊的核心和靈魂，Bobby
You're the heart and soul of this team, Bobby.

1072
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:46,111
也是我們當中唯一能通過考試的人
and the only one of us who could've passed that test.

1073
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:49,782
感謝你們把我當成朋友
Thank you all so much for being my friends.

1074
01:10:50,654 --> 01:10:53,352
夠了，讓我們在贏得這在波旁碗體育場的 勝利後在盡情的宣洩我們的情感吧
Well, let's wait till later to hold hands and kiss. We got a Bowl game to win.

1075
01:10:54,192 --> 01:10:55,555
- 怎麼樣？ - 好！
- Right? - [all Together] Yeah!

1076
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,991
- 2，3！ - 泥狗！加油！
- Two, three! - [all] Mud Dogs! Woof!

1077
01:10:58,663 --> 01:11:00,927
出現戲劇性的一幕
[Musburger] In a dramatic turn of events,

1078
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:04,064
Bobby Boucher下半場出現了
Bobby Boucher just arrived at halftime.

1079
01:11:04,835 --> 01:11:08,267
球迷們開始歡呼了，Brent。 他媽媽準時把他送到球場。
and on a fan boat, Brent. His mother drove him right into the stadium.

1080
01:11:13,684 --> 01:11:17,184
[players Shouting, Hooting]

1081
01:11:18,214 --> 01:11:20,445
泥狗！泥狗！
[Crowd Chanting] Waterboy! Waterboy!

1082
01:11:21,185 --> 01:11:23,783
泥狗！泥狗！
Waterboy! Waterboy!

1083
01:11:24,555 --> 01:11:26,819
泥狗！泥狗！
Waterboy! Waterboy!

1084
01:11:27,558 --> 01:11:29,689
蠢秋不是惡魔玩的
Fool's ball's not for the devil.

1085
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:31,825
是我的Bobby玩的
It's for my Bobby.

1086
01:11:32,363 --> 01:11:35,595
是時候讓人們歡呼了
Time to open up some whoop-ass.

1087
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,610
[Cheering, Chanting Continues]

1088
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:45,539
該死，他出現了。 好吧，聽著。
Shit, he showed up. all right, look.

1089
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:49,844
放鬆。放鬆。就像我們計劃 的那樣上場去。上，上，上！
Just relax. Relax. Go in there and do exactly like we planned. Go, go, go!

1090
01:11:50,882 --> 01:11:53,113
這可能會是個戲劇性比賽的開始，觀眾們
This could be the start of some high drama, folks.

1091
01:11:53,819 --> 01:11:55,549
但是泥狗隊落後也太多了
Or are the Mud Dogs too far behind?

1092
01:11:56,155 --> 01:11:58,152
Bobby Boucher在防守位
Bobby Boucher is on defense.

1093
01:11:58,824 --> 01:12:01,555
- 美洲獅隊站在他們自己的20碼線 - 衝啊！衝啊！
- The Cougars are coming out from their own 20 yard line. - [Quarterback] Hut! Hut!

1094
01:12:02,428 --> 01:12:04,425
開球。 一記回傳球！
The pitch. It's a reverse!

1095
01:12:05,064 --> 01:12:06,995
Boucher並不傻
Boucher's not fooled.

1096
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:09,865
天哪！Robideaux拿到球了
Fumble! Robideaux's got it!

1097
01:12:10,604 --> 01:12:11,901
泥狗隊觸地得分！
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

1098
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:13,943
[Growling]

1099
01:12:14,441 --> 01:12:17,373
- 夥計，Boucher已經把傻子從他的身體裡趕跑了 - 「傻子」？
- Boy, Boucher knocked the poop out of him. - ''poop''?

1100
01:12:18,285 --> 01:12:20,717
[all Shouting]

1101
01:12:21,449 --> 01:12:22,913
擊掌！擊掌！
Slap hands! Slap hands!

1102
01:12:25,186 --> 01:12:28,518
喝水啊。我要你們冷靜下來。 要對我的Bobby有信心
Drink up, now. I want you girls to sober up. Have faith in my Bobby.

1103
01:12:29,457 --> 01:12:31,888
泥狗隊迎來了第三節比賽
[Musburger] The Mud Dogs are faced with yet another third and long.

1104
01:12:32,661 --> 01:12:34,258
- 衝啊！ - Grenouille回傳
- Hut! - Grenouille back to pass.

1105
01:12:34,863 --> 01:12:39,062
他又被困在原地！ 泥狗隊進攻時不能把球傳出去。
He's gonna be stuffed again! and the Mud Dogs offence is still unable to move that ball.

1106
01:12:40,269 --> 01:12:42,800
他們的防守十分的出色， 他們還有贏得勝利的機會
But the way their defense is fired up, they still have a shot at winning this game.

1107
01:12:43,569 --> 01:12:45,166
Blake，過來。聽著
Blake, come here. Look.

1108
01:12:45,806 --> 01:12:48,537
現在，我們要做的是……
Now, what if we, uh-- [Whispering]

1109
01:12:51,411 --> 01:12:54,042
相信我。上，上，上，上，上
Trust me. Go, go, go, go, go. [Evil Laughter]

1110
01:12:54,915 --> 01:12:58,447
第三節時間過半，美洲獅隊27:7領先
[Musburger] The Cougars lead 27-7 in the middle of the third quarter.

1111
01:12:59,487 --> 01:13:01,084
犯規了？
- and he takes a knee? - [Whistle Blows]

1112
01:13:01,622 --> 01:13:04,587
你們要幹什麼啊？
- Y'all gonna play or what? - [Chattering]

1113
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:08,058
你們對我的新戰術怎麼看？
[Laughing] How do you all like my new offence?

1114
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,264
好吧，這是第二和12
[Musburger] all right, it's second and 12...

1115
01:13:13,802 --> 01:13:16,667
- 美洲獅隊開球。 - 衝啊！
- as the Cougars line up on the ball. - Hut! Hut!

1116
01:13:17,547 --> 01:13:19,078
[Whistle Blows]

1117
01:13:19,642 --> 01:13:22,173
Red Beaulieu的球隊要幹嘛，消極進攻嗎？
What is Red Beaulieu doing, refusing to play offence?

1118
01:13:22,978 --> 01:13:25,142
- Dan，這很奇怪 - 不奇怪，Brent。
- Dan, this is bizarre. - [Dan] No, it's not, Brent.

1119
01:13:25,782 --> 01:13:28,413
這很聰明，因為Red把茶水男孩排除出比賽之外了
It's brilliant, because Red is taking the waterboy out of the game.

1120
01:13:29,286 --> 01:13:31,250
就靠犯規然後開球這戰術，
By kneeling down three times and punting,

1121
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:33,485
他使泥狗隊無法順利進攻
he's gonna make the Mud Dog offence try to beat him.

1122
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:35,887
不過他們今天的比賽方式，是很難忍受的
and the way they're playing today, that's impossible.

1123
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,090
沒錯，這使泥狗隊最有價值的球員
[Musburger] Well, the Mud Dog's most valuable player,

1124
01:13:38,628 --> 01:13:41,126
那個被稱為「茶水男孩」的後衛， 現在無用武之地
the linebacker they call ''the Waterboy,'' is now powerless.

1125
01:13:41,965 --> 01:13:46,064
看來Klein教練要找其他的辦法來對付Red
That means Coach Klein will have to find another way to outfox Red.

1126
01:13:47,204 --> 01:13:50,669
泥狗隊暫停
- [Whistle Blows] - [Man] Mud Dogs call a time-out.

1127
01:13:51,742 --> 01:13:53,806
Klein教練，Klein教練！
- [Cheering, Indistinct] - Mr. Coach Klein. Mr. Coach Klein!

1128
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,644
Klein教練！
Mr. Coach Klein!

1129
01:13:57,282 --> 01:14:00,581
- 你要去哪兒？ - 我想去吃塊餅
- Where are you going? - I was just gonna get a hot pretzel.

1130
01:14:01,586 --> 01:14:03,817
Klein教練，你怕Red Beaulieu嗎？
Mr. Coach Klein, are you afraid of Red Beaulieu?

1131
01:14:04,529 --> 01:14:06,594
[Laughing, Shouting]

1132
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:09,755
我把他嚇倒了
I am petrified of him.

1133
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,658
那麼，你為什麼不把Red Beaulieu想像成……
Well, why don't you pretend that Red Beaulieu...

1134
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:15,127
那些你不怕的人呢？
is somebody that you're-you're not afraid of.

1135
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:17,797
- 想像成？ - 是的
- pretend? - Yes.

1136
01:14:18,503 --> 01:14:20,534
想像成那些你不怕的人
Visualize somebody you're not afraid of.

1137
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,670
- 然後攻擊，就像你告訴我的一樣 - 我試試
- and then attack, like you told me. - I'll try.

1138
01:14:24,441 --> 01:14:26,739
他現在就在哪兒
Well, he's right over there.

1139
01:14:32,524 --> 01:14:34,756
[Chuckling]

1140
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:40,487
小嬰孩
Little baby.

1141
01:14:41,026 --> 01:14:42,957
是的
Yeah.

1142
01:14:43,629 --> 01:14:47,495
你好，小孩
Hello, little baby. [Baby Talking]

1143
01:14:51,169 --> 01:14:53,433
要奶嘴？你沒有奶嘴啊？
a poo-poo? Do you have a poo-poo?

1144
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:55,570
是的
Yes.

1145
01:14:56,108 --> 01:14:58,005
好的。那麼現在
Okay. Now.

1146
01:14:58,677 --> 01:15:00,541
這就是我們接下來要做的。 他應該會在這出現……
This is what we're gonna do. He's gonna come here--

1147
01:15:01,154 --> 01:15:03,119
[Chattering, Shouting]

1148
01:15:09,222 --> 01:15:11,686
來吧，美洲獅
Come and get this one, Cougars.

1149
01:15:12,426 --> 01:15:14,290
紅色，22號！開球！
Red, 22! Hike!

1150
01:15:14,861 --> 01:15:17,225
球傳給了Grenouille。一個背後球！
[Musburger] Snap to Grenouille. a reverse!

1151
01:15:18,031 --> 01:15:20,963
不，是兩個背後傳球！ 哦，奇跡啊！
No, it's a double reverse! Oh, what a block!

1152
01:15:21,835 --> 01:15:23,265
Boudier的戰術失靈了
and Boudier springs free!

1153
01:15:23,804 --> 01:15:27,570
被阻擋！分邊！拿到球了！太精彩了！
Trouble! Lateral! Got him! What a play!

1154
01:15:28,676 --> 01:15:31,641
Grenouille到了15碼區！10碼區！5碼區！
Grenouille to the 15! To the 10! To the 5!

1155
01:15:32,545 --> 01:15:34,342
- 泥狗隊觸地得分！ - 哦，哦，哦
- Touchdown, Mud Dogs! - [Fouts] Well, well, well.

1156
01:15:35,014 --> 01:15:37,078
我猜Klein的袖子裡有神奇
I guess Coach Klein does have a few tricks up his sleeve after all.

1157
01:15:37,752 --> 01:15:40,483
這是……這是什麼？嗯？
What the hell-- What the hell is this? Huh?

1158
01:15:41,322 --> 01:15:44,020
我們可是個冠軍球隊啊！
We go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs!

1159
01:15:44,858 --> 01:15:47,556
現在，我們把鏡頭移向邊線， 我們的記者，Lynn Swann
Right now, we're going to go down to the sidelines and our man, Lynn Swann.

1160
01:15:48,396 --> 01:15:50,060
Swannie，你給我們帶來了什麼？
Swannie, what do you have for us?

1161
01:15:50,665 --> 01:15:52,129
我跟Vicki Vallencourt在一起， 在這場重要比賽裡
I'm with Vicki Vallencourt, who's taking over...

1162
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:54,998
她接管了Bobby Boucher茶水員工作
Bobby Boucher's water duties for this important game.

1163
01:15:55,771 --> 01:15:58,135
哦，我不是接替。 我只是盡力不把這弄得更糟
Oh, I'm not takin' over. I'm just tryin' not to screw up too bad.

1164
01:15:58,873 --> 01:16:01,504
那麼，問你個問題。 你能預測下比賽的結果嗎？
Well, let me ask you this. What's your prediction for the rest of this ball game?

1165
01:16:02,311 --> 01:16:03,908
泥狗隊30:27獲勝
Mud Dogs are gonna win, 30 to 27.

1166
01:16:04,446 --> 01:16:06,577
真是有意思。你怎麼會這麼猜呢？
That's very interesting. How'd you come up with that guess?

1167
01:16:07,282 --> 01:16:09,947
猜？那才不是猜呢！這就會是結果
Guess? That ain't no guess! That's what it's gonna be.

1168
01:16:10,752 --> 01:16:13,083
- 好的。沒事。 - 哦！在那兒小心點，Swannie。
- Okay. That's fine. - Oh! Be careful down there, Swannie.

1169
01:16:17,226 --> 01:16:19,290
好吧。 Meaney。Meaney在哪兒？
all right. Meaney. Where's Meaney?

1170
01:16:19,929 --> 01:16:21,393
- Meaney？ - 在這兒，教練
- Meaney? - Here, Coach.

1171
01:16:21,965 --> 01:16:24,796
- 上去看看茶水男孩能拿你怎麼辦 - 是的，先生！
- Get in there and let's see if that waterboy can stop you. - Yes, sir!

1172
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:28,966
Red把他最好的防守球員派上場啦
Red is sending his best defender in as a running back?

1173
01:16:29,974 --> 01:16:31,938
你怎麼看呢，Dan？
What do you make of this, Dan?

1174
01:16:32,543 --> 01:16:34,307
嗯，Brent，我想他是想 找個辦法來抑制茶水男孩
Well, Brent, he's gotta find some way to neutralize the waterboy.

1175
01:16:34,945 --> 01:16:37,610
他可能認為Meaney會擺平那傢伙的
He probably thinks that Meaney will just pound it in there like Fridge used to do for the Bears.

1176
01:16:38,449 --> 01:16:41,314
嘿，茶水男孩！你女朋友還會再一次救你嗎？
Hey, Waterboy! Is your girlfriend gonna save you again?

1177
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:43,883
哦，不用，先生。 我會靠我自己來解決問題的。
Oh, no, sir. I'm gonna take matters into my own hands.

1178
01:16:44,422 --> 01:16:47,654
- 你會看到的 - 你去死吧！你這個SB！哇哦！
- You'll see. - Bring it to the hole! Your ass is mine! Whoo!

1179
01:16:48,627 --> 01:16:50,891
哇哦！哇哦！
Whoo! Whoo!

1180
01:16:51,629 --> 01:16:53,259
你的叫聲就像是個破火車
You sound like a... a big choo-choo train.

1181
01:16:53,798 --> 01:16:56,529
哇哦！
Whoo! [Groans]

1182
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,371
重磅炸彈，感謝Insano上校
power bomb, compliments of Captain Insano.

1183
01:17:10,754 --> 01:17:13,153
* Let's go fight with your might **

1184
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:16,148
好吧，射門得分，射門得分。上！

1185
01:17:16,819 --> 01:17:19,484
- Derek。Derek！ - 在
- Derek. Derek! - Yeah.

1186
01:17:20,325 --> 01:17:22,823
設想一下進攻。去開球。開球。
Visualize the attack. Go kick the ball. Kick it.

1187
01:17:23,594 --> 01:17:24,991
開球！
- Hut! - [all Grunting]

1188
01:17:26,964 --> 01:17:28,628
你能做什麼，小子？
How you doin', boy? [Laughing]

1189
01:17:29,167 --> 01:17:31,164
不，不，不！
No, no, no! [Screaming]

1190
01:17:34,546 --> 01:17:36,611
[Cheering, Shouting]

1191
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,622
[Whimpering]

1192
01:17:51,697 --> 01:17:54,997
[players Shouting, Indistinct]

1193
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:57,726
那是什麼啊？
What the hell is that?

1194
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:07,068
那是什麼——他在搞什麼？ 怎麼這裡面沒有！嗯？
Where the hell is-- What the hell is he up to? That ain't in here! Huh?

1195
01:18:07,907 --> 01:18:09,337
嘿！
- [Cheering] - Hey!

1196
01:18:09,842 --> 01:18:11,439
第四節兩隊比分還相差10分
[Musburger] Down by ten late in the fourth quarter,

1197
01:18:12,012 --> 01:18:14,009
Klein教練選擇射門得分.
Coach Klein opts for the field goal.

1198
01:18:14,682 --> 01:18:17,513
然後他們需要個不越位的射門 和一個觸地得分來扳平比分
[Fouts] Then they have to hope for the onside kick and a touchdown to tie the game.

1199
01:18:18,352 --> 01:18:21,717
Dan，看場上。 Boucher看來負責清道
Dan, look what we have here. Boucher's in the game as a blocker.

1200
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:24,487
這是今年最後一場球了，Brent。 現在任何事情都會發生
Last game of the year, Brent. Can't hold anything back now.

1201
01:18:27,694 --> 01:18:29,625
準備！
Set!

1202
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:34,697
回傳。這是假象！
The snap. It's a fake!

1203
01:18:38,705 --> 01:18:41,370
Boucher跑在前面！撞得好！
Boucher's out in front! a great block!

1204
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,808
第二個了！
- [Grunting] - and a second one!

1205
01:18:45,646 --> 01:18:47,610
泥狗隊觸地得分！

1206
01:18:48,183 --> 01:18:50,948
- Boucher帶球得分！ - 啊！
- Boucher led him all the way! - [Screaming] Yeah!

1207
01:18:54,122 --> 01:18:55,619
Red Beaulieu生氣了，Dan。
Red Beaulieu is steaming, Dan.

1208
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:57,989
Brent，他看到他完美的一個 賽季就這麼快被破壞了
Brent, he sees his perfect season slipping away.

1209
01:18:58,627 --> 01:19:01,458
美洲獅隊只領先3分了
The Cougar's lead is down to three.

1210
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:05,904
[Cheerleaders Cheering, Indistinct]

1211
01:19:06,869 --> 01:19:09,467
泥狗隊可能會先把比分扳平，然後再打加時賽
The Mud Dogs need the ball back if they're gonna have a shot at overtime.

1212
01:19:10,305 --> 01:19:13,136
Bobby Boucher現在處在開球方陣
and Bobby Boucher is now on the kickoff team.

1213
01:19:14,043 --> 01:19:16,908
- 今年最後一場球了，Brent。現在任何事情都會發生 - 我知道
- Last game of the year, Brent. Can't hold anything back now. - I know.

1214
01:19:17,713 --> 01:19:20,378
下個是誰呢？
- [Horns Blaring] - Who's it gonna be?

1215
01:19:21,251 --> 01:19:24,082
該是誰呢？ 該是誰呢？
Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be?

1216
01:19:28,156 --> 01:19:30,554
哦，是的。就是你了。
[Chuckling] Oh, yeah. There's my bitch.

1217
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,291
注意了，球至少要前進10碼
[Musburger] Remember, the ball must travel ten yards.

1218
01:19:36,366 --> 01:19:37,930
那很輕鬆！
It's loose!

1219
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:40,867
- 泥狗隊控球！泥狗隊控球！ - 很好！
-Mud Dogs football! Mud Dogs football! -all right!

1220
01:19:41,672 --> 01:19:43,302
媽媽，我拿到球了！我拿到……
Mama, I got the football! I got it--

1221
01:19:43,872 --> 01:19:45,936
哦，多麼不道德的一擊！ 犯規啦！
Oh, what a vicious hit! That was a cheap shot.

1222
01:19:46,609 --> 01:19:48,006
哦！
- Oh! - [Murmuring]

1223
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,474
一個無聲的判罰
- [Whistle Blowing] - [Fouts] and what a dumb penalty.

1224
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,678
泥狗隊要射門得分來扳平比分
That puts the Mud Dogs in field goal range for the tie.

1225
01:19:54,517 --> 01:19:57,282
- Dan，我不確定Boucher能不能再站起來 - 哦，我的兒子！
- Dan, I'm not sure that Boucher is able to get back up. - Oh, my baby!

1226
01:20:05,062 --> 01:20:06,726
它還是很涼
It's still cold. [Chuckles]

1227
01:20:07,298 --> 01:20:09,562
借過！借過！
- [Chattering] - Excuse me. Out of my way.

1228
01:20:13,604 --> 01:20:15,735
Dan，你不希望看到這發生
Dan, you hate to see this happen.

1229
01:20:24,716 --> 01:20:27,047
那可是高質量的水哦
Now, that's high quality H2O.

1230
01:20:27,819 --> 01:20:30,984
繼續比賽！來吧，Bobby！
- [Cheering] - [Vicki] You go on, now! Make it happen, Bobby!

1231
01:20:35,927 --> 01:20:37,624
茶水男孩救只需要些水就行
The waterboy just needed some water.

1232
01:20:38,197 --> 01:20:41,829
- 喔哦，Dan。你想那是你的功勞嗎？ - 閉嘴，Brent。
- Wow, Dan. You think that up all by yourself? - Shut up, Brent.

1233
01:20:46,072 --> 01:20:47,402
你沒事吧？
- [Shouting, Yelling] - are you okay?

1234
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,637
他想讓我痛苦的號叫，我不會讓他得逞的
He tried to open up a can of whoop-ass on me. I wouldn't let him.

1235
01:20:50,177 --> 01:20:53,142
聽著，最後的比賽我有個新的戰術。 你以前從沒做過的。
Listen, I have an idea for the last play. You haven't done this before.

1236
01:20:54,047 --> 01:20:55,511
怎麼樣？這麼來進攻開球
all right? The offence is gonna line up like this.

1237
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,514
- 好的 - 你剛好到這兒
- Yeah. - You're gonna be right here.

1238
01:20:58,052 --> 01:20:59,782
今天這兒不會有平局
[Musburger] There'll be no tie here today.

1239
01:21:00,354 --> 01:21:03,219
Klein教練正在佈置他的進攻戰術
Coach Klein is sending his offence back on to the field.

1240
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:05,722
他將會贏的比賽
He's going for the win right now.

1241
01:21:06,327 --> 01:21:07,757
是的，這才是勇敢者的呼聲，Brent
[Fouts] Yeah, this is a real gutsy call, Brent.

1242
01:21:08,293 --> 01:21:09,823
英雄還是狗熊就看此一招了
He'll either be a hero or a goat because of this.

1243
01:21:10,328 --> 01:21:13,994
還有，Dan，Bobby Boucher回到場上了
[Musburger] and Dan, Bobby Boucher is back on the field.

1244
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:18,198
他現在司值進攻！ 我們知道，我們知道
He is now playing offence! We know. We know.

1245
01:21:19,138 --> 01:21:21,769
Meaney，如果他們把球傳給茶水男孩
Meaney, if they give that Waterboy the football,

1246
01:21:22,509 --> 01:21:24,006
我是不會介意你是否去傷害他的！
I don't care if you have to stab him!

1247
01:21:24,544 --> 01:21:26,308
不能放過他。明白了嗎？
Do not let him get away. Do you understand me?

1248
01:21:26,913 --> 01:21:29,845
- 是的，教練！ - 明白了嗎？上場去！
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir! - Do you understand me? Get in there!

1249
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:32,582

Bobby Boucher's the hero! He's gone from waterboy, Dan, to savior!

1255
01:23:15,726 --> 01:23:17,423
因為他沒有隱藏什麼事情
and it's because he didn't hold anything back!

1256
01:23:18,061 --> 01:23:20,826
Swannie就和我們的英雄在同一塊場地上， 現在把鏡頭交給Lynn！
