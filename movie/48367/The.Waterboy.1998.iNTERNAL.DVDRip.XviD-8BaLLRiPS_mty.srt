Now why ain't I surprised...

8
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,240
to see you snoopin' around my
football field first day of practice?

9
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,120
Well, that's because you got
a good-lookin' football team.

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,680
Maybe good enough to add another
national championship trophy
to the old case downstairs.

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,600
That's kinda like my old man
told me one time, Lynn.

"The only thing better than a crawfish
dinner is five crawfish dinners."

It's cold.

Any unused magic in that
legendary green playbook of yours, Red?

Mama, s-somethin' bad
happened today.

55
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,480
Somebody hurt you, my boy? Who hurt
you? You tell Mama who hurt you.

56
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
Nobody, Mama.
It's just that...

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,360
I lost my position as the team's
water distribution engineer.

Now you be able to spend your days

Yes, but...

I-I was... I was thinkin', Mama,
maybe I-I could...

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,680
I could try to-to get another
waterboy job for-for a different team.

Don't you raise your voice
to me, Bobby Boucher.

64
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
I-I wasn't raising
my voice, Mama.

00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,640
I don't like confrontation
'cause I'm a Virgo.

you was a Virgo?

Bobby Boucher! Don't you remember
what your mama told you about girls?

70
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,200
I remember, Mama.

A girl was so nice out at
Wasser's Creek this morning.

- Really?
- We looked for crawfish together.
Her's name's Vicki.

73
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,720
I don't ever want you
associatin' with little girls.

74
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,760
- Why not, Mama?
- Because little girls are the devil!

75
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,640
Mama, it-it's just
that I'm a waterboy.

76
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
The team gets thirsty,
and I bring them the water.

77
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,520

to be the one that brings it to them.

Yeah. They like to give you a boot
in the patoot for all your trouble.

Bobby, you don't have what they call
"the social skills."

That's why you never have any
friends, except for your mama.

82

I'm gonna open a can
of whoop-ass on Herculon,

83
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,280
and I'm gonna drive him back into
whatever galaxy it is he came from.

as you like to say...

92
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,840
- you seem to be sweating
quite profusely.
- Yeah?

93
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,680
I was wondering if,
perhaps, you might need...

94

Come on, everybody.

- All right, this is it.
This is the play.
- Okay.

This is the play.
This is the play. Okay?

125
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,800
The quarterback. Two receivers
lined up to the left, one to the right.

126
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,160
There's a flanker lined up to the left
behind the quarterback.

127
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,160
- Oh, okay.
- He gives the ball...
No, he doesn't get the ball.

128
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,760
The receiver goes
all the way over there to the left.

129
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,360
Once the quarterback has the ball,
he fakes to the left.

130
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,360
No. He fakes to the right.
He doesn't fake.

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,960
He thinks about faking.
He pretends to fake.

where I am.

Or, this room is getting smaller.
I have to sit down.

Hang on here.
Take some water.

136
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,040
All right, there.

137
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,120
This is good. This is much better
than what I serve.

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,480
- That is the water that
you serve to your players?
- Uh-huh.

139
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,600
It is imperative that you allow me
to be your waterboy.

You do not have to... have to pay me.
I-I will do it for free.

142
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,200
Just promise me that you will
never distribute the contents
of that jug to any human person.

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,520
Option?

300
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,280
- [Grumbling]
- He ain't never gonna be able
to figure this out, Coach.

301
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,160
Yes, he is.

302
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,760
Now, Bobby, you've waterboyed
for 18 years.

303
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,720
Didn't you occasionally
watch the game?

304
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,560
Oh, I had a lot
to k-keep me busy.

305
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,160
- Checking the pH levels,
refillin' the cups.
- All right.

306
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Well, then let's just
keep it simple.

307
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,480
Casey. I want you
to tackle Casey...

308
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,960
like you did Gee yesterday.

309
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,880
- Right now?
- Right now! Go!

310
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,760
- Does he know about this?
- Doesn't matter. You're a warrior.

311
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,680
Go.

312
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
- [Man] Boy, what you doin'?
- [Players Grumbling]

313
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,440
[Coach Klein]
All right. Bobby, Bobby.

314
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,800
Don't be afraid to use
all of your strength, you know?

315
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,160
He's resilient.
He's a resilient guy.

316
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,080
Okay? Come on.

317
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,400
[Man] Hey, Casey,
I think he wanna make out with you.

318
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,320
- [Whistle Blowing]
- Okay, that's enough. Thank you.

319
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,440
Is there any sport that you
do watch? You know, a physical sport?

320
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,680
- Boxing? Hockey?
- Wrestling.

321
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,880
Wrestling! Wrestling is good.

322
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,800
Who's your favorite wrestler?

323
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,040
Well, even though he was slightly
discourteous to me recently,

324
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
I'm gonna have to say
Captain Insano.

325
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,720
Okay, okay,
I want you to do to Casey...

326
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,920
what Captain Insano does
to the bad guy.

327
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,840
Go.

328
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,200
- Ow! Ow!
- [Players Gasping]

329
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,280
- He poked me in the eye.
- Captain Insano shows no mercy.

330
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,160
Bobby, where was the intensity
that I saw yesterday?

331
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,880
That was no intensity. You said it
was all right to fight back,

332
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,800
and I-I just started thinkin'
about all the people who-who'd
been mean to me over the years.

333
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,520
That's it.
That's it.

334
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,760
I want you to think about
all those mean people.

335
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,400
- They're gonna be your tackling fuel.
- Tacklin' fuel.

336
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,240
- We're gonna use them to play football.
- Tacklin' fuel.

337
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,280
I want you to pretend
that Casey...

338
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,640
- is insulting you.
- Pretend?

339
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,640
I want you to visualize all those
people that have been mean to you.

340
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,400
And then I want you to attack. I want
you to visualize and then attack.

341
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,000
- Can you handle that?
- I'll try.

342
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,920
He's gonna try.

343
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,040
What's the matter with you, boy?
You too s-s-stupid...

344
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,080
to do what your coach
tells ya?

345
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,280
- [Coach Laughing]
- No!

346
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,160
- No what?
- [Yelling]

347
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,640
[Players Murmuring]

348
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,400
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Coach told me to pretend.

349
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,480
Bobby. Bobby! Can you do this for
me every single game? Can you do this?

350
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,760
Coach, not only
will I do it for you.

351
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,480
l-l-l...
Yes, yes, I'll do it for ya.

352
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,840
[Chattering]

353
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,320
So, uh, why you pick this class anyway?
It's pretty hard.

354
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,560
Oh, beautiful view.

355
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,160
Correct.

356
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,320
All right, all right!

357
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,240
Y'all shut up now!

358
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,440
Now, last week,
we talked about...

359
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,600
the physiology
of the animal brain...

360
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,520
as it pertains
to aggression.

361
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,040
Now is there anyone here
that can tell me why...

362
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,080
most alligators
are abnormally aggressive?

363
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,240
- I know the answer to this question.
- Raise your hand.

364
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,120
Anybody? Anyone?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

365
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,000
Mama says that alligators
are ornery...

366
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,760
'cause they got all them teeth
but no toothbrush.

367
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
[Chuckling]
Yo mama said,

368
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,560
alligators are ornery
'cause they got all them teeth...

369
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
and no toothbrush.

370
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,560
Wow!

371
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,480
Anybody else?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

372
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,000
Alligators are aggressive because
of an enlarged medulla oblongata.

373
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,960
It's the sector of the brain
which controls aggressive behavior.

374
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,960
- That is correct!
The medulla oblongata.
- But Mama said...

375
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,800
The medulla oblongata...

376
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,680
is where anger, jealousy
and aggression come from.

377
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,480
Now, is there anybody here can tell
me where happiness comes from?

378
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,560
- No, man.
- Anyone?

379
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,760
All right, let's hear what
Mama has to say on the subject.

380
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,280
Mama say that happiness is
from magic rays of sunshine that
come down when you feelin' blue.

381
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,440
Well, folks,
Mama's wrong again.

382
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
No, Colonel Sanders,
you're wrong.

383
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,160
- [Students] Ooh!
- Mama's right.

384
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,880
You're all wrong.
Mama's right. Mama's right!

385
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,200
Somethin' wrong
with his medulla oblongata.

386
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,200
- [Class Laughing]
- [Yelling]

387
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,240
It's okay to fight back.
Coach Klein said I could.

388
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,440
Mr. Coach Klein said I could.
It's fine, fellas.

389
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,880
[Announcer] Well, Mud Dog
fans, it's time to kick off...

390
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,840
another year
of Mud Dog football.

391
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,720
With the weight of a 40-game
losing streak on their back,

392
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,080
everyone seems to be diggin' in
for the long haul.

393
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,680
# There's blood in the streets
It's up to my ankles #

394
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,680
# There's blood in the streets
It's up to my knee #

395
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,240
# Blood on the streets
in the town of Chicago #

396
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,400
# Blood on the rise
It's following me ##

397
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
What you doin', Bobby?

398
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,880
Oh, Lord, that-that-that's some
heavy-duty armpit saturation.

399
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,800
That's an early warning sign of
the dehydration. You gots to have H2O.

400
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,560
- Please, for me.
- Look, you need to stop
worryin' about water, baby,

401
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,800
and start worryin'
about the game today, okay?

402
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,520
Here. Now, just do whatever you did
to Colonel Sanders,

403
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,440
and you'll be fine.

404
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,600
I-I will, thank you. I-I-I just...
I feel bad about lyin' to my mama.

405
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,640
I wonder what
she's doin' right now.

406
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,040
## [Country]

407
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,400
[Braying]

408
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,120
- [Grunting]
- [Announcer] And he's down
with a three-yard kickoff return.

409
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,480
- The Mud Dogs offense takes the field.
- Okay, come on, here we go.

410
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,840
Come on, everybody.
You can do it. Gain some yards.
Put some points on the board.

411
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,000
Hey, Walter,
I'll bet you 50 bucks...

412
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,560
Gee Grenouille throws a touchdown pass
on the first play.

413
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
Check it out.

414
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,640

You owe me 50 bucks.

418
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,040
- You said it was gonna be
a touchdown pass, you crazy asshole.
- Go, go, go, go!

419
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,480
Hold 'em, hold 'em, hold 'em.
Okay, you can do it. Come on.

420
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,880
Bobby, Bobby, this is
just like we practiced, okay?

421
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,800
Okay, go, go, go.

[Bobby Grunting]

435
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,480
Yes!

436
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,720
- Time-out from the game.
- What's he calling time-out for?

437
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,280
- Man, what are you doin'?
- Here, this is for you.

Waterboy's killin' 'em.

445
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,800
He's the best tackler
I've seen since Joe Montana.

446
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,800
Joe Montana was a quarterback,
you idiot.

447
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
I said, "Joe Mantegna."

00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,160
Eagle cover two.
Eagle cover two. Ready?

450
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,560
Best of luck to you
on-on-on the upcoming play.

451
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,440
- I'll be playin' with your mama tonight.
- Sixty-two.

452
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,840
- Move, 22, hut!
- [Announcer] Bernard drops back.

453
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,080
- Looks like a screen pass.
- [Cheering]

454
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,640
Sixty-two! Sixty-two!
There you are!

455
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,560
- [Groaning]
- Thank you.

456
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,440
[Announcer]
Number 62 is headed for the end zone.

457
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,920
He's at the 40, the 30.
He's almost...

458
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,920
Man! Touchdown!
Reds lead.

459
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,080
[Bobby Grunting]

460
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,520
Dropkick. Looks like Boucher
knocked him out cold.

461
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,920
I love my mama very much.
Now you know that.

462
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,800
- [Crying]
- [Crowd Moaning]

463
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,000
The waterboy handed them the game.
What an idiot.

464
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,160
Waterboy, you stink!

465
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,720
Nice job, shithead.
You just lost us the game.

466
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,680
I'm sorry. Would you please
still be my friend?

467
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,400
No! Get away from me.

468
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,800
Okay.

469
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,440
Excuse me?
May I help you?

470
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,600
Hey, stud.

471
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,400
Vicki Vallencourt, this is...
this is quite a pleasant surprise.

472
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,440
Yeah, well, I just got out of jail,
and I heard you were playin' football.

473
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,360
Yes, well, I-I-I've...

474
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,440
[Mumbling, Indistinct]

475
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,920
[Bobby]
Yes.

476
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,280
[Mumbling, Indistinct]

477
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,600
So, let's say we go and get
somethin' to eat, catch up on things.

478
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,560
Oh, uh...

479
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,640
Mama's not a-a-a big fan
of restaurants...

480
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,760
or of-of me going to one.

481
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,440
But if-if you'd like,
sometimes,

482
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,600
Mama, she, uh... she like to...
on a Sunday afternoon...

483
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,160
There-There's a-a-a grill
with the charcoal b-biscuits.

484
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,560
- You want me to come to a barbecue?
- Yes, that's it.

485
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,240
[Chuckling]
Sounds great.

486
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,440
And by the way, I hope you like
what I did to y'all lawn mower.

487
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,640
[Steve Braying]

488
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,560
You know that old hag that does
astrology on Good Morning America,

489
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,480
she really ought
to pack it in.

490
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,520
Listen what she said
for Sagittarius. She goes:

491
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,160
"You're gonna be faced with
a difficult decision today."

492
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,520
But the thing is-is-is, we're all faced
with difficult decisions every day.

493
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,640
- That's like sayin'
you're gonna eat today.
- Yeah, m-maybe...

494
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,880
by leaving her predictions
vague and generalized,

495
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,720
there's less of a chance of someone
findin' out she's a phony.

496
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,200
Whatever, college boy.

497
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,560
- Don't say college boy. Here comes Mama.
- Oh, okay.

498
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,920
That looks nice, Mama.

499
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,840
[Sighing]

500
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,840
- Mmm, here you go, Vicki Vallencourt.
- Thank you.

501
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,880
Mama, Vicki's
an astrologist.

502
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,120
I don't believe in that sort
of thing, personally.

503
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,360
Astronomy is one
of the many tools of the devil.

504
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,800
You sure played great
yesterday, Bobby.

505
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,560
- What did my boy play great?
- Uh, um...

506
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,920
Waterboy. Yeah, waterboy.
He played... He played waterboy great.

507
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,280
Everybody who was thirsty
got a drink right away...

508
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,880
yesterday at the...
at the football game.

509
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,400
Fool's ball! Bunch of overgrown
monsters manhandling each other.

510
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,920
Remember when that man wanted you
to play fool's ball, Bobby?

511
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,720
Yeah, l... He...
Roy Orbison...

512
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,480
Coach Klein.
I-I-I remember.

513
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,480
So, Bobby, did they ever catch
that gorilla...

514
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,960
what escaped from the zoo
and punched you in the eye?

515
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,280
No, Mama, he...
The-The search continues.

516
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,720
What would you think if Bobby
did play football, Mrs. Boucher?

517
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,440
Well, I wouldn't
think much of it at all.

518
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,080
And to tell you the truth,
I don't think much of you...

519
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,240
and all your snotty questions,
Miss Vallencourt.

520
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm quite disturbed to see
that you're so interested in my boy.

521
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,480
I'm very, very interested
in your boy, Mrs. Boucher.

522
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,120
- Really?
- Mm.

523
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,520
Well, did he tell you
about how much his feet smell?

524
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,160
- Mama.
- He has to wear two pair of socks.

525
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,280
Well, men are supposed
to have stinky feet.

526
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
Well, are men
supposed to wear pajamas...

527
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,960
featuring a cartoon character
by the name of Deputy Dog?

528
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,760
- Mama, please.
- Well, you know what?

529
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,160
I happen to find
Deputy Dog to be...

530
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,280
very, very sexy.

531
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,960
Did he tell you about
a little bedtime problem?

532
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,880
- Mama, I'm beggin' you, don't.
- That's his sheet back there.

533
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,360
If you'll excuse me, ladies,
I'm gonna go hang myself.

534
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,200
- Now you see what you done?
- What I did?

535
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,400
Now you listen here, cupcake. The
"onliest" woman in my boy's life is me.

536
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Nobody's gonna take him away, especially
not some godless Jezebel like you.

537
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,680
Oh, yeah, well your Bobby
is a grown man.

538
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,280
And guess what? He can hang out
with whoever he wants!

539
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,680
Oh, yes, he can.
Whoever he wants. 'Cept you!

540
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,200
Bobby, that-that woman
is the devil.

541
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,360
- I want you to stay away
from her, you hear me?
- Yes, Mama.

542
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,680
Now you come on inside before that
little ol' witch casts a spell on us!

543
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,920
I'm sorry,
Vicki Vallencourt.

544
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,360
Whatever.

545
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,080
# If you want it, you got it
You feed it, you love it #

546
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,360
# Say that you need it
You never... ##

547
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,320
When we report on the S.C.L.S.U.
Mud Dogs here on Sportscenter,
it's usually to add...

548
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,920
another number to their amazing
losing streak, which now stands at 41.

549
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,320
But now, Bobby Boucher
has given us another reason.

550
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,320
In the Mud Dog's latest loss
this past Saturday,

551
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,240
the amazing 31-year-old freshman
set a new N.C.A.A. record...

552
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,760
by sacking the quarterback
16 times,

553
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,040
shattering the old record
of seven.

554
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,240
And, oh, by the way, Bobby Boucher
is also the team's waterboy,

555
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,480
which, of course,
begs the question:

556
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,600
What exactly are they putting
in the water...

557
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,480
down in Jackson's Bayou,
Louisiana?

558
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,280
# There is a house
in New Orleans #

559
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,800
# They call The Rising Sun ##

560
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,960
[Announcer] We're deadlocked
at three with less than a minute to go.

561
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,440
[Coach Klein]
We are one family with one dream.

562
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,440
There are 40 of you
on this team, not just one.

563
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,080
Bobby can't do this by himself. Now get
out there and make something happen!

564
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,440
- All right, sacrifice
your bodies. Go, go, go!
- [Players Cheering]

565
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,680
Thank you. Bobby, you're gonna
have to do this by yourself...

566
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,000
because there is nobody
on this team that's any good.

567
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,720
Now look, I can't stand
losing anymore.

568
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,640
We've got to win one game. Can you
go out there and make something happen?

569
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,400
- Visualize and attack.
- Yeah.

570
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,960
- Visualize and attack. Please!
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

571
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,680
- Please!
- [Mumbling, Indistinct]

572
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,920
[Announcer] Central Kentucky's down
to their third straight quarterback.

573
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,400
Good news, folks.
First-string quarterback, Tommy Gardner,

574
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,400
does not have a broken neck.

575
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,960
Blue, 52!
Blue, 52! Hut!

576
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,960
I forbid you to talk to
that enchantress. She's the devil!

577
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,760
She's not the devil. She's the
most beautiful woman in the world.

578
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,400
- I never said she was the devil.
- She's the most beautiful woman
in the world.

579
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,400
Oh, please, don't hurt me!

580
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,240
Follow the...
Come on!

581
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,200
You crazy man!
Okay, okay, okay!

582
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,760
It's a safety!
They win, they win, they win!

583
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,920
With the help of Boucher,
the losing streak is over!

584
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,120
I'm so sorry, Mama.
Please, forgive me.

585
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,360
I love you so much, Mama.
I love you.

586
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,760
- I love you too.
- [Derek] We won!

587
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,440
We won, baby! It's gonna be a big
party tonight, and you're going!

588
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,720
- Me? Party?
- Yeah, baby!

589

[Chanting]
Party! Party!

591
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,280
# Let's groove tonight #

592
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,240
# And share
the spots and light #

00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,040
Hey! Nice suit.

594
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,400
Thank you.
It was my daddy's.

Thanks.

- [Woman] Hey, Bobby Boucher!

Look who's here:
Sergeant Stutter.

599
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,760
- Want a beer?
- I'll take a Scotch and water.
Hold the Scotch.

600
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,120
- You just make a joke, Bobby?
- Yes, I did.

[Chuckling]
Good one.

602
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,280
Now that you finally won a game, right,
you feel looser, the pressure is off,

603
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,920
and that will lead
to a lot more victories.

604
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,280
- Yeah, that and a waterboy
getting 20 sacks a game.
- That too.

Yes, sir. That is,
if it's all right with you.

[Woman]
Let's talk to the waterboy.

610
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,480
You played amazing
at the game today, Bobby.

611
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,400
And you are so cute.
Is there a girl you're seein'?

612
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,280
Seein'? Uh, uh, I see
a lot of girls.

613
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,520
I see a lot of guys too.

614
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,000
I think that's sexy.

615
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,480
You ever been with a guy and a girl
at the same time?

616
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,400
Oh, yeah, plenty of times.

617
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,880
The other night, I was with my mama
and Coach Klein at the same time.

618
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,320
You are a bad boy.
I wish you were my boyfriend.

619
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,720
Oh, thank you, but, see, there's
this girl, Vicki Vallencourt.

620
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,840
She may be the devil.
Mama said that.

621
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,880
Consequently, I am prohibited
from contact with her.

622
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,120
But I hope to get past that
one day 'cause she's nice to talk to.

- [Cheering]
- Thank you, Mr. Lawrence Taylor.

640
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,720
Tell me, what is your secret?
How do you find yourself
in the right position all the time?

641
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,680
That-That-That's
a good question.

642
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,520
What-What happens is, the-the-the
center has-has the ball first.

643
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,560
And-And-And the quarterback
will say, "Hike."

644
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,440
That's when the c-center puts the ball
in-into the hands of the quarterback.

645
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,480
So what I do is,
I-I start tacklin' the quarterback,

646
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,880
unless he give the ball
to-to s-somebody else,

647
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,000
in which case,
I-I try to tackle that person.

Hmm? Children, which brings me
to my next point:

What you doin' here?

652
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,720
Oh, nothin'.
I was just thinkin'...

653
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,200
about stealin' L.T.'s Porsche
over there.

654
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,440
But I suppose I ought to
be movin' on before I get you
in trouble with your mama.

655

Well, Mr. Coach Klein said that
what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

ride home together.

669
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,160
Vicki Vallencourt,
I figured...

670
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,920
'cause you're interested in astrology
and mystical stuff like that,

671
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,320
you might appreciate this.

672
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,280
That's water
from a glacier in Alaska.

673
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,720
It-lt was blessed
by a-an Eskimo medicine man.

674
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,320
- It's cold!
- Yes, it's always cold.
That's why it's so special.

675
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,360
That-That was...
That-That-That-That happened...

676
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,560
That-That happened to be
my-my first time with-with lips...

677
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,400
and-and-and-and-and
and-and-and-and-and the-the tongue.

678
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,080
That was your tongue.
l... I believe it was...

679
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,200
I never did that before.

680
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,120
Well, if that was
your first kiss,

681
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,080
then I bet it's the first time
you've seen a pair of these.

682
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,920
Yes, yes, that is
a-another first for me,

of that Bourbon Bowl bid.

693
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,120

by nailing this 20-yard field goal.

in the first annual

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,000
- [Together] Waterboy, number one!
- You can do it!

742
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,160
Thank you so much...

743
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,160
for bein' my friends.

744
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,240
- [Crowd Cheering]
- You can do it!

745
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,600
I'd also like to take
this opportunity...

746
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,560
to tell you that my mama
don't know how I play football,

747
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,200
so if-if you could not tell
my mama I-I play football,
that would be for the best.

748

[Horn Honking]

751
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,600
We must be a little lost. We're tryin'
to get to the Bourbon Bowl.

752
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,720
Looks like we ended up
in Retardville, U.S.A.

753
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,760
Hey, Waterboy, you fixin'
to tackle all of us?

754
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,200
- Kick his water-lovin' ass, Greg.
- I asked you a question, dumb ass.

755
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,600
You even exhale,
and I will saw your head off.

756
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,760
You can do it!
Cut his fucking head off!

757
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,960
Hold it, hold it. Just a minute.
Now what is the problem here, honey?

758
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,360
I mean, whatever it is,
we don't want this to get physical.

759
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,280
Right, Klein?

760
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,920
[Vicki] Yeah, well, your team actin'
like a bunch of shitheads.

761
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,120
This is not how ambassadors
for the University of Louisiana
are supposed to act.

762
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,720
So now you just get back on the bus.
[Chuckling]

763
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,960
However,
assault with a deadly weapon,

764
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,360
very, very serious offense.

765
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,600
Officer, get her
little country ass outta here.

766
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,360
- [Crowd Murmuring]
- Thank you, Vicki.

767
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,080
Let's go.

768
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,840
Ah! It's the waterboy!

769
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,760
I got something for you.

770
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,400
This is his transcript from
South Lafayette High School...

771
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,600
in Cherokee Plains,
Louisiana.

772
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,960
Now the problem with that...

773
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,880
is there ain't no South Lafayette High
School in Cherokee Plains, Louisiana.

774
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,040
- So obviously, this is a fake!
- [Crowd Gasping]

775
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,000
However, this is not a fake.

776
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,640
This is from the N.C.A.A.

777
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,200
They don't think you ought
to play football no more.

778
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,240
So allow me to say this to you
one more time:

779
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,160
You're fired.

780
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,160
Oh, no!
We suck again!

781
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,600
Ever see a championship ring?

782
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,040
- Don't be messin' with the champ.
Come on, Laski.
- You didn't go to high school?

783
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,280
I was home schooled.
I-I didn't know I needed...

784
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,600
- Forged a fake transcript.
- No, no, I-I-I didn't.

785
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,280
- The waterboy's a cheater.
Cut his head off.
- [Crowd Agreeing]

786
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,040
Listen, everybody!
This don't change nothin'!

787
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,160
We played as a team,
we won as a team.

788
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,320
And just because
the waterboy's a cheater,

789
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,080
don't change the fact
that the real Mud Dogs...

790
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,560
are gonna kick
some Cougar ass.

791
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,840
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

792
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,400
[Together] Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

793
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,320
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

794
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,080
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

795
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,040
- That's the way!
- [Cheering]

796
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,800
Sorry, Bobby.

797
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,280
# Oh, what a lonely boy #

798
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,800
Believe me,
I-I understand.

799
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,280
Yeah, and you're
deeply appreciated, Mr. Dodd.

800
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,720
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

801
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,000
Good news, Bobby.

802
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,360
- The N.C.A.A. is gonna allow you
to play in the Bourbon Bowl.
- Yes.

803
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,600
You just have to pass the high school
equivalency test.

804
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,880
It's not the test, Coach.

805
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,120
Everybody hates me.

806
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,640
That's not true.

807
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,800
One man said he wanted
to decapitate me.

808
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,560
Nobody else thought that
to be too bad of an idea.

809
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,520
Somebody made me
look like a-a-a cheater.

810
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,040
I did it. I did it. I did it!
I did it! I did it!

811
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,840
- It was me.
- Why?

812
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,040
Because I wanted you to play.
Because you were my way out, Bobby.

813
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,160
'Cause it was the only way
to get you in.

814
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,720
I am so sorry.

815
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,520
Why didn't you s-stick up for me
down by the river?

816
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,200
The truth is, I fled.

817
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,840
I came into my office,
I went under my desk, I cried.

818
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,240
I cried. I cried
like a ten-year-old girl!

819
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,360
[Groaning]

820
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,080
Red and I have a history.

821
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,280
Twenty years ago,
we were assistants to Coach Cavanaugh...

822
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,640
at the University
of Louisiana.

823
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,120
Red ran the practices,
and I used to come up with the plays.

824
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,520
Oh, boy, was I good.

825
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,760
I would write these foolproof plays
in my little green notebook that I had.

826
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,840
- The opposition
didn't even know what hit 'em.
- [Door Knocking]

827
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,760
And when Coach Cavanaugh
was going to retire,

828
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,160
me and Red, we just knew that one of us
was gonna be his successor.

829
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,280
## [Disco]

830
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,680
- Hey, Red.
- How ya doin'?

831
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,680
Come by to wish me luck?

832
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,120
Well, not exactly, no, no.
Actually, I come by to get you
to do ol' Red a little favor.

833
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,280
Sure. What's up?

834
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,200
Well, you know that green
notebook you use to write
all them football plays in?

835
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,360
Well, I need to show Cavanaugh that
I can come up with some good play ideas.

836
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,240
But you didn't come up
with them.

837
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,520
They're my plays.
I need them.

838
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,920
Klein, I'm gonna have
this book one way or another,

839
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,800
so you might as well let the damn
thing go, 'cause if you don't,

840
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,560
it's gonna get awfully,
awfully physical around here.

841
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,040
And I don't think
you want that, do you? Huh?

842
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,760
[Cackling]

843
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,920
Of course, Red got the job.
Next day, fired me.

844
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,120
Once he had my notebook,
he didn't need me anymore.

845
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,200
I didn't take it very well.

846
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,800
No, Grandma,
I didn't get it.

847
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,120
I can't believe it myself.

848
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,800
I know.
I'm so numb.

849
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,280
I just hate him,
I hate him, I hate him.

850
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,520
That is a terrible story, Coach.

851
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,800
- But why-why don't you just
come up with some new plays?
- I tried.

852
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,720
- I can't.
- Yes.

853
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,840
I guess I have a mental block,
you know, ever since Red took
my playbook and my manhood.

854
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,320
I knew what he was gonna do!

855
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,240
And I just didn't fight back.

856
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,920
Well, you're gonna show him
that you're a man on Saturday.

857
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,600
And I'm gonna show everybody
that I'm not a dummy.

858
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,760
I'm gonna go study.

859
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,600
Mama, maybe you could stop brushin'
my hair so I can read.

860
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,760
Read?

861
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,760
You don't have to read.

862
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,360
- What you readin' for?
- 'Cause I enjoys it, Mama.

863
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,840
Don't look like to me you enjoys it,
sittin' there all grouchy.

864
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,280
Mama, I gotta read this book
and six other books tonight,
or else I can't play foot...

865
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,040
ball.

866
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,120
Fool's ball? You playin'
the fool's ball behind my back?

867
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,680
The only reason I'm doin' this
so, so I can go to school.

868
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,120
School? You goin' to school?
[Screams]

869
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,560
- [Steve Braying]
- Sorry, Mama. I wanted to tell you.

870
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,880
You off gallivantin' with your fancy
fool's ball friends at school,

871
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,520
while I'm sittin' here all day
with nobody to keep me company,
except Steve?

872
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,920
The chickens are comin' home
to roost, Bobby Boucher.

873
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,480
You reap the fruit
of your selfish ways.

874
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,680
You're gonna lose all your
fancy fool's ball games...

875
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,800
and you're gonna fail your big exam,
because school is...

876
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,720
- The devil?
- [Gasps]

877
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,880
Everything is the devil
to you, Mama!

878
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,720
Well, I like school,
and I like football!

879
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,200
And I'm gonna keep doin' them both
because they make me feel good!

880
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,160
And by the way, Mama,
alligators are ornery...

881
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,720
because of their
medulla oblongata!

882
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,280
And I like Vicki,
and she likes me back!

883
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,800
And she showed me her boobies,
and I liked them too!

884
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,360
The Louisiana High School
Equivalency Examination...

885
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,640
consists of 300
multiple choice questions.

886
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,200
You have three hours.
Good luck to you, sir.

01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,120
[Fouts] Good reason, Brent.
109 yards untouched.

1042
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,720
- [Cheering]
- Touchdown, Cougars! They strike first.

1043
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,720
[Yelling, Shouting]

1044
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,520
- [Whistle Blowing]
- Time running down in the first quarter.

1045
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,760
Cougars lead is 17-0.

1046
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,480
Set!

1047
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,440
Three! Thirty-three!

1048
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,000
- [Growling]
- Three! Thirty-three! Hut!

1049
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,480
Dan, that quarterback can't even
get the ball off before he's hit.

1050
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,680
It's as if they're in
the offensive huddle with him.

1051
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,520
- [Laughing]
- [Muttering]

1052
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,880
Are you gonna finish
that hot dog, Jimmy?

1053
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,160
Ugh! Now I'm not.

1054
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,080
[Bobby] Mama, you think
we'll make it on time?

1055
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,880
Hang on! I'll show you what
A.J. Foyt taught me.

1056
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,400
[Musburger] That's the end of
the half. The Cougars are dominating.

1057
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,240
Let's hope the Mud Dogs
can make some adjustments.

1058
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,160
- Well, they better, 'cause they suck.
- Mm-hmm.

1059
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,000
Anybody got an idea?

1060
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,800
Hey.

1061
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,560
- Remember the time Bobby tackled
the referee by mistake?
- [Chuckling]

1062
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,920
Yeah, that was pretty funny.

1063
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,280
How about the time he tackled
the guy from Louisville...

1064
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,080
- and threw him into the stands?
- [All Laughing]

1065
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,320
Y'all remember when he intercepted
the ball and his pants fell off?

1066
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,640
And then he ran for
the touchdown, bare-assed.

1067
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,760
Remember the time Bobby...
[Mumbling Incoherently]

1068
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,800
Remember when Bobby Boucher
showed up at halftime and the
Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl?

1069
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,440
[Cheering, Shouting]

1070
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,560
Hey, sorry about givin' you
so much shit this year.

1071
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,840
You're the heart and soul
of this team, Bobby.

1072
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,520
Ain't one of us could've
passed that test.

1073
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,240
Thank you all so much
for being my friends.

1074
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:01,600
Well, let's wait till later
to hold hands and kiss.
We got a Bowl game to win.

1075
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,400
- Right?
- [All Together] Yeah!

1076
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,800
- Two, three!
- [All] Mud Dogs! Woof!

1077
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,680
[Musburger]
In a dramatic turn of events,

1078
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,720
Bobby Boucher
just arrived at halftime.

1079
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:16,000
And on a fan boat, Brent. His mother
drove him right into the stadium.

1080
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,560
[Players Shouting,
Hooting]

1081

[Crowd Chanting]
Waterboy! Waterboy!

01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,680
Waterboy! Waterboy!

1083
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,520
Waterboy! Waterboy!

Fool's ball's
not for the devil.

1085
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,120
It's for my Bobby.

1086
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,160
Time to open up
some whoop-ass.

1087
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,920
[Cheering, Chanting
Continues]

1088
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,680
Shit, he showed up.
All right, look.

1089
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,880
Just relax. Relax. Go in there and
do exactly like we planned. Go, go, go!

1090
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,720
This could be the start
of some high drama, folks.

1091
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,960
Or are the Mud Dogs
too far behind?

1092
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,520
Bobby Boucher
is on defense.

1093
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,960
- The Cougars are coming out
from their own 20 yard line.
- [Quarterback] Hut! Hut!

1094
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,520
The pitch.
It's a reverse!

1095
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,000
Boucher's not fooled.

1096
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,800
Fumble!
Robideaux's got it!

1097
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,520

[Growling]

the poop out of him.

Drink up, now. I want you girls to
sober up. Have faith in my Bobby.

1103
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
[Musburger] The Mud Dogs are
faced with yet another third and long.

1104
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,080
- Hut!
- Grenouille back to pass.

1105
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:43,280
He's gonna be stuffed again!
And the Mud Dogs offense is
still unable to move that ball.

1106
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,480
But the way their defense
is fired up, they still have
a shot at winning this game.

1107
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,560
Blake, come here. Look.

1108

Now, what if we, uh...

Trust me. Go, go, go, go, go.
[Evil Laughter]

1110
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,720
[Musburger] The Cougars lead 27-7 in
the middle of the third quarter.

1111

- And he takes a knee?

How do you all like my new offense?

1114
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,440

All right, it's second and 12...

- Hut! Hut!

[Whistle Blows]

1117
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,320
What is Red Beaulieu doing,
refusing to play offense?

1118
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,080
- Dan, this is bizarre.
- [Dan] No, it's not, Brent.

1119
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,360
It's brilliant, because Red is
taking the waterboy out of the game.

1120
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,880
By kneeling down
three times and punting,

1121
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,880
he's gonna make the Mud Dog
offense try to beat him.

1122
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,320
And the way they're playing
today, that's impossible.

1123
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,360
[Musburger] Well, the Mud Dog's
most valuable player,

1124
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,520
the linebacker they call "the Waterboy,"
is now powerless.

1125
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,560
That means Coach Klein will have
to find another way to outfox Red.

1126
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,880
- [Whistle Blows]
- [Man] Mud Dogs call a time-out.

- Mr. Coach Klein. Mr. Coach Klein!

01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,240
Mr. Coach Klein!

1129
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,360
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna get a hot pretzel.

1130
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,200
Mr. Coach Klein, are you afraid
of Red Beaulieu?

1131
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,800
[Laughing, Shouting]

1132
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,680
I am petrified of him.

1133
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,720
Well, why don't you pretend
that Red Beaulieu...

1134
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,880
is somebody that
you're-you're not afraid of.

1135
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,600
- Pretend?
- Yes.

1136
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,160
Visualize somebody
you're not afraid of.

1137
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,280
- And then attack, like you told me.
- I'll try.

1138
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,200
Well, he's right over there.

Yeah.

Hello, little baby.
[Baby Talking]

1143
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,800
A poo-poo?
Do you have a poo-poo?

1144
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,680
Yes.

1145
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,120
Okay. Now.

1146
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,520
This is what we're gonna do.
He's gonna come here...

Come and get
this one, Cougars.

1149
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,720
Red, 22! Hike!

1150
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,680
[Musburger]
Snap to Grenouille. A reverse!

1151
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,360
No, it's a double reverse!
Oh, what a block!

1152
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,240
And Boudier springs free!

1153
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,920
Trouble! Lateral!
Got him! What a play!

1154
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,640
Grenouille to the 15!
To the 10! To the 5!

1155

- Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
- [Fouts] Well, well, well.

1156
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,600
I guess Coach Klein does have
a few tricks up his sleeve after all.

1157
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,040
What the hell...
What the hell is this? Huh?

1158
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,440
We go from a championship
football team to a bunch of dogs!

1159
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,840
Right now, we're going to go down to
the sidelines and our man, Lynn Swann.

1160
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,000
Swannie, what do
you have for us?

1161
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,920
I'm with Vicki Vallencourt,
who's taking over...

1162
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,880
Bobby Boucher's water duties
for this important game.

1163
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,880
Oh, I'm not takin' over.
I'm just tryin' not to screw up too bad.

1164
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,160
Well, let me ask you this.
What's your prediction for
the rest of this ball game?

1165
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,200
Mud Dogs are gonna win,
30 to 27.

1166
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,920
That's very interesting.
How'd you come up with that guess?

1167
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,280
Guess? That ain't no guess!
That's what it's gonna be.

1168
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,240
- Okay. That's fine.
- Oh! Be careful down there, Swannie.

1169
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,080
All right.
Meaney. Where's Meaney?

1170
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,040
- Meaney?
- Here, Coach.

1171
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,520
- Get in there and let's see if
that waterboy can stop you.
- Yes, sir!

1172
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,680
Red is sending his best defender in
as a running back?

1173
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,200
What do you make of this, Dan?

1174
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,480
Well, Brent, he's gotta find
some way to neutralize the waterboy.

1175
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,840
He probably thinks that Meaney
will just pound it in there like
Fridge used to do for the Bears.

1176
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,440
Hey, Waterboy! Is your girlfriend
gonna save you again?

1177
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,600
Oh, no, sir. I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands.

1178
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,600
- You'll see.
- Bridge the hole!
Your ass is mine! Whoo!

1179
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,480
Whoo! Whoo!

1180
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,560
You sound like a...
a big choo-choo train.

1181
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,000
Whoo!

Power bomb, compliments
of Captain Insano.

1183

# Fight, fight, fight
with your might ##

1184
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,680
All right, field goal.
Field goal. Go.

1185
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,040
- Derek. Derek!
- Yeah.

1186
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,160
Visualize the attack.
Go kick the ball. Kick it.

1187
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,000
- Hut!
- [All Grunting]

1188
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,480
How you doin', boy?
[Laughing]

1189
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,040
No, no, no!
[Screaming]

1190
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,280
[Cheering, Shouting]

1191
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,880
[Whimpering]

1192

[Players Shouting,
Indistinct]

1193
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,480
What the hell is that?

1194
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,680
Where the hell is... What the hell
is he up to? That ain't in here! Huh?

1195
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,560
- [Cheering]
- Hey!

1196
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,600
[Musburger]
Down by ten late in the fourth quarter,

1197
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,160
Coach Klein
opts for the field goal.

1198
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,680
[Fouts]
Then they have to hope for the onside
kick and a touchdown to tie the game.

1199
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,840
Dan, look what we have here.
Boucher's in the game as a blocker.

1200
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,160
Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.

1201
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,120
Set!

1202
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,840
The snap. It's a fake!

1203
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:30,560
Boucher's out in front!
A great block!

1204
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,840
- [Grunting]
- And a second one!

1205
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,320
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

1206
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,800
- Boucher led him all the way!
- [Screaming] Yeah!

1207
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,960
Red Beaulieu
is steaming, Dan.

1208
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,320
Brent, he sees his
perfect season slipping away.

1209
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,880
The Cougar's lead
is down to three.

1210
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:54,240
[Cheerleaders Cheering,
Indistinct]

1211
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,520
The Mud Dogs need the ball back if
they're gonna have a shot at overtime.

1212
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,080
And Bobby Boucher is
now on the kickoff team.

1213
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:04,640
- Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.
- I know.

1214
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:08,000
- [Horns Blaring]
- Who's it gonna be?

1215
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,520
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?

1216
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,680
[Chuckling]
Oh, yeah. There's my bitch.

1217
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,160
[Musburger] Remember,
the ball must travel ten yards.

1218
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,560
It's loose!

1219
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,600
- Mud Dogs football! Mud Dogs football!
- All right!

1220
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,720
Mama, I got the football!
I got it...

1221
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,320
Oh, what a vicious hit!
That was a cheap shot.

1222
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,160
- Oh!
- [Murmuring]

1223
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,640
- [Whistle Blowing]
- [Fouts] And what a dumb penalty.

1224
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,920
That puts the Mud Dogs
in field goal range for the tie.

1225
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,360
- Dan, I'm not sure that Boucher
is able to get back up.
- Oh, my baby!

1226
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,160
It's still cold.
[Chuckles]

1227
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,160
- [Chattering]
- Excuse me. Out of my way.

1228
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,960
Dan, you hate
to see this happen.

1229
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,920
Now, that's
high quality H2O.

1230
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,840
- [Cheering]
- [Vicki] Come on, now!
Make it happen, Bobby!

1231
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,920
The waterboy
just needed some water.

1232
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,400
- Wow, Dan. You think that up
all by yourself?
- Shut up, Brent.

1233
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,200
- [Shouting, Yelling]
- Are you okay?

1234
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,400
He tried to open up a can
of whoop-ass on me. I wouldn't let him.

1235
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,120
Listen, I have an idea for the last
play. You haven't done this before.

1236
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,040
All right? The offense
is gonna line up like this.

1237
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,960
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be right here.

1238
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,160
[Musburger]
There'll be no tie here today.

1239
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,720
Coach Klein is sending
his offense back on to the field.

1240
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,840
He's going for
the win right now.

1241
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,760
[Fouts] Yeah, this is
a real gutsy call, Brent.

1242
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,720
He'll either be a hero
or a goat because of this.

1243
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,280
[Musburger] And Dan,
Bobby Boucher is back on the field.

1244
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,120
He is now playing offense!
We know. We know.

1245
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,440
Meaney, if they give
that Waterboy the football,

1246
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,360
I don't care if you
have to stab him!

1247
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,640
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me?

1248
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:12,320
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir!
- Do you understand me? Get in there!

1249
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,640
[All]
Break!

1250
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,960
- I'm ready, friend.
- Let's do it, Bobby.

1251
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,480
Set! Set!

1252
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,840
Forty-three! Set!
Forty-three! Hut, hut!

1253
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,840
Touchdown! They win it!
The Mud Dogs win it!

1254
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:53,040
Bobby Boucher's the hero! He's gone
from waterboy, Dan, to saviour!

1255
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,200
And it's because he didn't
hold anything back!

1256
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,720
Well, Swannie's down on the field
with our hero, so let's go to Lynn now!

1257
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,360
We did it! I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!

1258
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,320
- Vicki, I love you!
- Whoo! I love you too, baby.

1259
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:12,000
We're the champions!
[Screaming]

1260
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,880
Mr. Coach Klein, you got your manhood!
You got your manhood!

1261
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,080
Bobby, congratulations.
You're the M.V.P. of the Bourbon Bowl.

Bobby, I've been dreading
this day for a long time.

1267

- But you got yourself a fine woman.
- Oh, thank you, Mama.

1268
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,360
Good luck, son.

1269
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,320
This is the best day
of my life!

1270
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,800
You just wait till tonight.

1271
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,520
- What's gonna happen tonight?
- [Chuckles] You'll see.

1272
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:08,680
You can do it!
You can do it all night long!

[Cheering, Shouting]

1274
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,760
I'm gonna go do it!

1275
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,880
- [Tires Screech]
- Bobby, it's me!

1276
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,400
- Your daddy, Roberto.
- Daddy?

1277
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:31,200
I've seen you on the ESPN
when they was talkin' about
you being drafted by the NFL.

1278
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,800
Not going to the NFL.
I'm gonna stay in school and graduate.

1279
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,600
The hell with school, dopey! Take the
money! You and me could be partners,

1280
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,080
- just like that Tiger Woods
and his daddy.
