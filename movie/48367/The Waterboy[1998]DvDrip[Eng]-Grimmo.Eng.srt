Anybody else ?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

372
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,036
Alligators are aggressive because
of an enlarged medulla oblongata.

373
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,991
lt's the sector of the brain
which controls aggressive behaviour.

- That is correct !
The medulla oblongata.

The medulla oblongata...

00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,711
is where anger, jealousy
and aggression come from.
