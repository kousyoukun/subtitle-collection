1
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,218
Cut his ass.

2
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:53,622
Go! Now let's go!

3
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:00,064
Heads up!

4
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:06,069
Take him down!
That's it, that's it!

5
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,398
- Hey, Coach, how you been?
- Lynn Swann.

6
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:14,439
Now why ain't I surprised...

7
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,442
to see you snoopin' around my
football field first day of practice?

8
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,375
Well, that's because you got
a good-lookin' football team.

9
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:23,108
Maybe good enough to add another
national championship trophy
to the old case downstairs.

10
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:26,151
That's kinda like my old man
told me one time, Lynn.

11
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:31,990
"The only thing better than a crawfish
dinner is five crawfish dinners."

12
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,556
Hey, here comes
the shithead.

13
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:06,184
It's clean.

14
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:08,556
It's cold.

15
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:12,154
Now that's what I call
high-quality H2O. Oh!

16
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:15,166
Ooh!
Right in the head!

17
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:18,969
It's over there!

18
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:27,440
Any unused magic in that
legendary green playbook of yours, Red?

19
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:31,681
I may have a couple
squirreled away in there...

20
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,584
for a rainy day.

21
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:54,316
See what we got here.

22
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:04,688
- Not exactly what I'd call
constructive criticism.

23
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,354
- Smell like you could use
a shower, stinky.
- Oh!

24
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:10,830
Listen, you-you could think what you
want a-about my personal hygiene,

25
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,992
but, please,
don't-don't waste any water.

26
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:17,027
That-That's bad policy. If you
need to amuse yourself at my expense,

27
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:19,835
just-just rough me up
or something.

28
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,638
Fair enough.

29
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:31,850
Laski, get over here!

30
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,320
Yes, sir, Coach?

31
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,653
What is that moron
doin' here? Huh, huh?

32
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:40,718
Didn't I tell you as plain as I could
speak to get rid of his ass last year?

33
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:44,493
Yes, sir, but I didn't think
you were serious, Coach.
Besides, he does a great job.

34
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,592
Disrupting my football team,
you idiot?

35
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,127
Eighteen years of this
is enough!

36
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:53,697
Hey, Waterboy!

37
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,709
Yes, Mr. Coach Beaulieu!

38
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,269
You're fired!

39
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:01,281
Okay.

40
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,390
Get out of the way, you moron!

41
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:29,272
Oh.

42
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:41,115
Bobby Boucher,
come give your mama a kiss.

43
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:43,783
Hi, Steve.

44
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:49,130
Oh. Why you home so early,
my precious angel?

45
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:52,758
Mama, s-somethin' bad
happened today.

46
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,668
Somebody hurt you, my boy? Who hurt
you? You tell Mama who hurt you.

47
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:58,672
Nobody, Mama.
It's just that...

48
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,767
I lost my position as the team's
water distribution engineer.

49
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,405
Why, that's the best news
I heard in a dog's age.

50
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:09,678
Now you be able to spend your days
at home where you belong.

51
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,185
Yes, but...

52
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:15,655
I-I was... I was thinkin', Mama,
maybe I-I could...

53
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:19,785
I could try to-to get another
waterboy job for-for a different team.

54
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,261
Don't you raise your voice
to me, Bobby Boucher.

55
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,197
I-I wasn't raising
my voice, Mama.

56
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:28,100
I don't like confrontation
'cause I'm a Virgo.

57
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:31,171
Who told you
you was a Virgo?

58
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,138
Vicki Vallencourt,
that-that-that-that girl.

59
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,179
A girl?

60
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:42,307
Bobby Boucher! Don't you remember
what your mama told you about girls?

61
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,318
I remember, Mama.

62
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:49,849
A girl was so nice out at
Wasser's Creek this morning.

63
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:53,725
- Really?
- We looked for crawfish together.
Her's name's Vicki.

64
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:56,355
I don't ever want you
associatin' with little girls.

65
00:05:56,431 --> 00:06:00,561
- Why not, Mama?
- Because little girls are the devil!

66
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:03,570
Mama, it-it's just
that I'm a waterboy.

67
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:05,799
The team gets thirsty,
and I bring them the water.

68
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:08,638
They-They need the water, and I likes
to be the one that brings it to them.

69
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,339
Yeah. They like to give you a boot
in the patoot for all your trouble.

70
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:17,647
Bobby, you don't have what they call
"the social skills."

71
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:22,850
People don't understand you.
That's why you never have any
friends, except for your mama.

72
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,951
All I know is this, Jimmy:
Next Friday, August 29,
at the Baton Rouge Exposition Center,

73
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:29,622
I'm gonna open a can
of whoop-ass on Herculon,

74
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:32,360
and I'm gonna drive him back into
whatever galaxy it is he came from.

75
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,096
And that's a promise!

76
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,539
Strong words from a strong man,
Captain Insano.

77
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:43,601
Now let's take a call. It's our
old friend from Jackson's Bayou, Mr. B.

78
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:45,771
Hello, Jim.

79
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:49,374
I-Is it possible
to speak to Captain Insano?

80
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,578
- Shoot, Mr. B.
- Captain Insano,

81
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:54,087
I notice sometimes
when you are wrestling...

82
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:57,613
or-or openin' up a can of whoop-ass,
as you like to say...

83
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:01,128
- you seem to be sweating
quite profusely.
- Yeah?

84
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:04,063
I was wondering if,
perhaps, you might need...

85
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,397
the services
of an experienced waterboy.

86
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,461
That's pretty cute.

87
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:12,802
How old are you, kid?
Eleven, twelve?

88
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:14,739
I-I am 31 years old.

89
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,353
I guarantee, that guy's still a virgin.

90
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:29,447
Oh! Oh, my God!

91
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:20,165
This is where
they strip the ball from us.

92
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:24,371
And then we miss one tackle.
There, two tackles.

93
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:26,812
Joey drops the ball.

94
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,373
Whoops, he has time
to pick it up and dust it off
and run in for a touchdown...

95
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,944
before our guys even know
what's goin' on.

96
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:43,559
- Hello?
- My name is Bobby Boucher.

97
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:47,499
And I am inquiring as to whether
you have the need for
an experienced waterboy...

98
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,833
on your upcoming season.

99
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,395
Nice suit.

100
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:55,068
Thank you.
I-I-I-It was my daddy's.

101
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:57,304
- Hold that thought.
- Yeah.

102
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:00,177
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Come on. Come here.

103
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,012
Come here. Come on.
Come on, everybody.

104
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,882
- All right, this is it.
This is the play.
- Okay.

105
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:09,014
This is the play.
This is the play. Okay?

106
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,457
The quarterback. Two receivers
lined up to the left, one to the right.

107
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:14,927
There's a flanker lined up to the left
behind the quarterback.

108
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:18,056
- Oh, okay.
- He gives the ball...
No, he doesn't get the ball.

109
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,761
The receiver goes
all the way over there to the left.

110
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,559
Once the quarterback has the ball,
he fakes to the left.

111
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:29,729
No. He fakes to the right.
He doesn't fake.

112
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:35,538
He thinks about faking.
He pretends to fake.

113
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:38,737
I don't know
where I am.

114
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:40,781
I can't breathe.

115
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:44,807
Or, this room is getting smaller.
I have to sit down.

116
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,445
Hang on here.
Take some water.

117
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:56,496
All right, there.

118
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,928
This is good. This is much better
than what I serve.

119
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:12,608
- That is the water that
you serve to your players?
- Uh-huh.

120
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,843
It is imperative that you allow me
to be your waterboy.

121
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:20,649
I can't hire you.
I can't hire anybody with the...

122
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:23,121
You do not have to... have to pay me.
I-I will do it for free.

123
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,957
Just promise me that you will
never distribute the contents
of that jug to any human person.

124
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:32,557
- That's a deal.
- It's a deal?

125
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:36,967
Thank you so-so much, Coach Klein.
I... I will not let you down.

126
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:38,505
- Good day.
- Good day.

127
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,405
I-I-I'll see you
at practice.

128
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:07,589
Quit hoggin' that.
Pass it over.

129
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,119
Okay.

130
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:29,418
Just have the defense
run sprints.

131
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:52,537
Yo! Water's better cold.

132
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:57,607
Yes, I agree, but to guarantee that
the H2O is-is purified,

133
00:11:57,685 --> 00:12:00,415
i-it's good to use
the heating source, Sterno.

134
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:04,322
It's like my mama always says,
"Better safe than-than sorry."

135
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:11,226
My mama says that too.
Aren't all mamas the same?

136
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,825
- Yes.
- Derek. I kick
the field goals around here.

137
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:19,464
Will you listen up? I need
your cooperation. I need it now.

138
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,735
Is he gonna be-be
all right?

139
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,609
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He has
his good days and his bad days.

140
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,840
Used to be an assistant coach
at some big football school,

141
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,849
but he had a mental breakdown
or something.

142
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,511
Don't worry.
He'll snap out of it.

143
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,521
- Let me know when it
cools down, baby. All right.
- Yes.

144
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:44,262
Hey, did you all get a load
of the new waterboy?

145
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,892
Let's make him feel right at home.
Jerry, go right.

146
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:52,302
Casey, go left.
Way left.

147
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:54,432
- On one. Ready?
- Break!

148
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:03,779
Set! Red, 22!

149
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:07,719
Red, 22! Hut!

150
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:23,798
I-I-I-I think you zigged
when you should've zagged on that play.

151
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:27,807
- Sorry.
- Hey, Waterboy, check this out.

152
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:50,963
Hey, Waterboy!
Check this out.

153
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,267
Yes.

154
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,364
Well, my, my, my.

155
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:04,377
Was my little aquatic engineer about
to bash one of my football players?

156
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:07,073
Well, he spit
in the c-c-cooler.

157
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,708
He happens to be
a finely tuned athletic machine.

158
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:15,585
And I ain't gonna have him hit
in the head by some idiot waterboy.

159
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:19,251
Do you understand me?

160
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,521
- Are you all right?
- What? I wasn't gonna
do nothin', Coach.

161
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,587
Well, you better do something.
You gotta defend yourself here, Bobby.

162
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,964
But they're-they're-they're
finely tuned athletic machines.

163
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:31,004
I am not telling you
to go on a shooting rampage.

164
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,438
But you have to stand up
for yourself, or they're
gonna ride you all season long.

165
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:37,602
Believe me,
I've seen it myself.

166
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:46,017
Hey, moron!

167
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:52,391
Hey! Moron! Duh!

168
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:56,020
L-Look at me. I'm the w-w-waterboy.

169
00:14:56,096 --> 00:15:01,625
Duh! I got
a wooden spoon. Duh!

170
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,868
Smell like you could use
a shower, stinky.

171
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,771
You're fired!

172
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,412
Stop makin' fun of me.

173
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:20,646
Red, ready! Hut!

174
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:26,625
- Wow!
- Damn!

175
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:35,234
I'm sorry.

176
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:38,271
Who that?
Who there?

177
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,772
So that's what openin' up
a can of whoop-ass feels like.

178
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:48,747
Son, you just opened
a whole case of whoop-ass.

179
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:52,513
I would be honored if you
play football for this team.

180
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:56,215
- Me? Play football?
- Yes.

181
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,953
Thanks, but no thanks. My mama
won't let me play no football.

182
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:03,827
We're gonna go home.
You and I, we're gonna talk to Mama.

183
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:06,764
M-Mama said... M-Mama said...
My mama said... Mama said...

184
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:10,565
- My mama said... My mama say that...
- She's gonna say yes.

185
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,351
Mmm, that snake
looks delicious.

186
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:28,388
What part do you think
I'm about to eat?

187
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:32,653
Uh, basically
a snake don't have parts.

188
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,820
But, uh, if I had to
call it anything,

189
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:39,099
I would say
it's his knee.

190
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,826
Great. His knee.

191
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:45,965
And what are we having
for dessert?

192
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,477
Squirrel.

193
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,114
Excellent.

194
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,482
Let's talk about Bobby
playing football.

195
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:02,613
I don't like it, Mr. Coach Klein.
I don't like it one bit.

196
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,453
You see, my boy is too delicate
to be playin' "fool's ball"...

197
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,618
or whatever you call it...
with them gargantuans.

198
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,992
I don't think you understand,
Mrs. Boucher.

199
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,531
No, you don't understand me,
Mr. Coach Klein.

200
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,558
My boy is all I got left. Ow!

201
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,763
Mama, here.

202
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,773
It's the brain pain, Coach.

203
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:24,038
You see, my husband Robert,

204
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,841
one day back in 1966,
pick up sticks,

205
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,611
and me four months pregnant
with this precious angel.

206
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,176
He decides he wants to go
and help the foreign peoples.

207
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,085
He's gonna go
and join the peace corps.

208
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,386
And he promise me
that everything's gonna be okay.

209
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,359
Just like you
promisin' me now.

210
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:44,124
But everything wasn't okay. No.

211
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,758
He got lost in the middle
of the Sahara Desert.

212
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:51,270
And he died.
He died!

213
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:56,970
- Couldn't get no water, Coach.
He died of the dehydration.
- And we were left all alone.

214
00:17:57,043 --> 00:18:01,309
I would've gotten my daddy some water,
but I was just a little baby
inside Mama's stomach.

215
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,441
And now you wanna take away
the only part of my Robert I have left.

216
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:08,783
But don't you want the only part you've
got left to get a college education?

217
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:13,349
- Nah.
- Me, a college student?

218
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,395
Yes. Bobby, think about it.

219
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,624
A whole new world
will open to you.

220
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,861
Boy, Mama, that-that-that sounds nice.
Me-Me, a college man.

221
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,028
Coach, my Bobby's
a sweet boy,

222
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,800
but he ain't exactly what you'd call
"college material,"

223
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,740
so don't you go fillin' his simple head
with all those crazy dreams...

224
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,744
of school and college
and things of that sort.

225
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,303
But Mama, I-I'm tired
of everybody callin' me a dummy.

226
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:38,749
I'm-l'm tired
of not havin' any friends.

227
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,981
And my ass is tired sittin' here
jawin' all night. I'm goin' to bed.

228
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:46,151
Nice to meet you, Mr. Coach.
Good luck with your fool's ball.

229
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:49,059
Bobby, after you let Mr. Coach out,
you come into my bedroom.

230
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,563
Mama'll brush your hair.

231
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,369
You know, when I was your age,

232
00:18:56,436 --> 00:19:00,839
my mother told me not to get a tattoo...
of Roy Orbison.

233
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,174
But what Mama don't know
won't hurt her.

234
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,855
I trust you'll make
the right decision.

235
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,533
Damn, I don't want that ass
on the team.

236
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,540
Everybody's gonna
laugh at us.

237
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,599
Everybody's already
laughin' at us.

238
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,475
We ain't won a game
since 1994.

239
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:45,075
- Hey! What's up, baby?
- Hey.

240
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:49,314
- Where's your helmet?
- Derek Wallace, they-they
don't got no more helmets.

241
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,324
Here. You can share mine.

242
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,826
Try it on, man.
See if it fits.

243
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,764
- All right.
- Thanks, friend.

244
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:04,167
What a dink.

245
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,569
Come on!
Huddle up!

246
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,802
- All right,
we have an announcement to make.

247
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,937
Our former waterboy, Bobby Boucher,
is gonna play some linebacker for us.

248
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:19,748
Ooh, I'm a f-f-football player.

249
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,516
- Coach, I'd like to tackle him
right now, please.
- Not yet.

250
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,082
All right, now I wanna work with the
offense. I wanna work with the defense.

251
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,186
- Special teams, go with
Farmer Fran, do some laps.
- Shit.

252
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,466
Line up on the ball.

253
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,007
- Let's go.
- All right? Third and ten.

254
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,203
Third and ten?

255
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:51,013
Yeah, you know, that's
the offense's last opportunity...

256
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,018
to gain ten yards
before they have to punt.

257
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,020
Gee, he's gonna run
the option.

258
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,022
Option?

259
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,888
- He ain't never gonna be able
to figure this out, Coach.

260
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,894
Yes, he is.

261
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:06,659
Now, Bobby, you've waterboyed
for 18 years.

262
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,701
Didn't you occasionally
watch the game?

263
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,669
Oh, I had a lot
to k-keep me busy.

264
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:15,401
- Checking the pH levels,
refillin' the cups.
- All right.

265
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,568
Well, then let's just
keep it simple.

266
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,977
Casey. I want you
to tackle Casey...

267
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,572
like you did Gee yesterday.

268
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,585
- Right now?
- Right now! Go!

269
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,588
- Does he know about this?
- Doesn't matter. You're a warrior.

270
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,590
Go.

271
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,356
Boy, what you doin'?

272
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,860
All right. Bobby, Bobby.

273
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:46,337
Don't be afraid to use
all of your strength, you know?

274
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,772
He's resilient.
He's a resilient guy.

275
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,776
Okay? Come on.

276
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:54,245
Hey, Casey,
I think he wanna make out with you.

277
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,248
Okay, that's enough. Thank you.

278
00:21:56,316 --> 00:22:00,548
Is there any sport that you
do watch? You know, a physical sport?

279
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,884
- Boxing? Hockey?
- Wrestling.

280
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:05,186
Wrestling! Wrestling is good.

281
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:07,192
Who's your favorite wrestler?

282
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,559
Well, even though he was slightly
discourteous to me recently,

283
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,723
I'm gonna have to say
Captain Insano.

284
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,462
Okay, okay,
I want you to do to Casey...

285
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:20,870
what Captain Insano does
to the bad guy.

286
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,874
Go.

287
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,481
Ow! Ow!

288
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:34,778
- He poked me in the eye.
- Captain Insano shows no mercy.

289
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:39,885
Bobby, where was the intensity
that I saw yesterday?

290
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,723
That was no intensity. You said it
was all right to fight back,

291
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:46,822
and I-I just started thinkin'
about all the people who-who'd
been mean to me over the years.

292
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:50,665
That's it.
That's it.

293
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,035
I want you to think about
all those mean people.

294
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:57,839
- They're gonna be your tackling fuel.
- Tacklin' fuel.

295
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:01,847
- We're gonna use them to play football.
- Tacklin' fuel.

296
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:06,079
I want you to pretend
that Casey...

297
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,518
- is insulting you.
- Pretend?

298
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:12,718
I want you to visualize all those
people that have been mean to you.

299
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,590
And then I want you to attack. I want
you to visualize and then attack.

300
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:18,290
- Can you handle that?
- I'll try.

301
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,298
He's gonna try.

302
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:32,935
What's the matter with you, boy?
You too s-s-stupid...

303
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,074
to do what your coach
tells ya?

304
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:38,404
No!

305
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:41,412
No what?

306
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:49,986
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Coach told me to pretend.

307
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:55,288
Bobby. Bobby! Can you do this for
me every single game? Can you do this?

308
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:57,659
Coach, not only
will I do it for you.

309
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,530
I-I-I...
Yes, yes, I'll do it for ya.

310
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:09,702
So, uh, why you pick this class anyway?
It's pretty hard.

311
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:12,039
Oh, beautiful view.

312
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,813
Correct.

313
00:24:15,881 --> 00:24:19,112
All right, all right!

314
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:21,119
Y'all shut up now!

315
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:25,487
Now, last week,
we talked about...

316
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:27,719
the physiology
of the animal brain...

317
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:30,785
as it pertains
to aggression.

318
00:24:30,863 --> 00:24:34,458
Now is there anyone here
that can tell me why...

319
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:37,627
most alligators
are abnormally aggressive?

320
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:40,900
- I know the answer to this question.
- Raise your hand.

321
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:44,966
Anybody? Anyone?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

322
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:50,045
Mama says that alligators
are ornery...

323
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,948
'cause they got all them teeth
but no toothbrush.

324
00:24:55,187 --> 00:24:58,315
Yo mama said,

325
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,087
alligators are ornery
'cause they got all them teeth...

326
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:04,254
and no toothbrush.

327
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,264
Wow!

328
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:09,301
Anybody else?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

329
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:12,997
Alligators are aggressive because
of an enlarged medulla oblongata.

330
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:15,040
It's the sector of the brain
which controls aggressive behavior.

331
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:19,203
- That is correct!
The medulla oblongata.
- But Mama said...

332
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,179
The medulla oblongata...

333
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:28,282
is where anger, jealousy
and aggression come from.

334
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:33,314
Now, is there anybody here can tell
me where happiness comes from?

335
00:25:33,392 --> 00:25:36,520
- No, man.
- Anyone?

336
00:25:38,264 --> 00:25:42,963
All right, let's hear what
Mama has to say on the subject.

337
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:48,735
Mama say that happiness is
from magic rays of sunshine that
come down when you feelin' blue.

338
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:55,142
Well, folks,
Mama's wrong again.

339
00:25:56,415 --> 00:25:58,349
No, Colonel Sanders,
you're wrong.

340
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,078
- Ooh!
- Mama's right.

341
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:04,987
You're all wrong.
Mama's right. Mama's right!

342
00:26:05,057 --> 00:26:07,423
Somethin' wrong
with his medulla oblongata.

343
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:17,896
It's okay to fight back.
Coach Klein said I could.

344
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,200
Mr. Coach Klein said I could.
It's fine, fellas.

345
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:24,803
Well, Mud Dog
fans, it's time to kick off...

346
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,845
another year
of Mud Dog football.

347
00:26:26,912 --> 00:26:30,905
With the weight of a 40-game
losing streak on their back,

348
00:26:30,983 --> 00:26:34,419
everyone seems to be diggin' in
for the long haul.

349
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:54,472
What you doin', Bobby?

350
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,169
Oh, Lord, that-that-that's some
heavy-duty armpit saturation.

351
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:01,235
That's an early warning sign of
the dehydration. You gots to have H2O.

352
00:27:01,313 --> 00:27:03,042
- Please, for me.
- Look, you need to stop
worryin' about water, baby,

353
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:05,413
and start worryin'
about the game today, okay?

354
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:10,319
Here. Now, just do whatever you did
to Colonel Sanders,

355
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:12,323
and you'll be fine.

356
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:16,657
I-I will, thank you. I-I-I just...
I feel bad about lyin' to my mama.

357
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:18,788
I wonder what
she's doin' right now.

358
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:27,636
- And he's down
with a three-yard kickoff return.

359
00:27:27,706 --> 00:27:30,106
- The Mud Dogs offense takes the field.
- Okay, come on, here we go.

360
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:33,576
Come on, everybody.
You can do it. Gain some yards.
Put some points on the board.

361
00:27:33,645 --> 00:27:35,840
Hey, Walter,
I'll bet you 50 bucks...

362
00:27:35,914 --> 00:27:38,508
Gee Grenouille throws a touchdown pass
on the first play.

363
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:40,518
Check it out.

364
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:42,781
Set, fool, 22, hut!

365
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,364
You owe me 50 bucks.

366
00:27:53,432 --> 00:27:57,801
- You said it was gonna be
a touchdown pass, you crazy asshole.
- Go, go, go, go!

367
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,362
Hold 'em, hold 'em, hold 'em.
Okay, you can do it. Come on.

368
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,874
Bobby, Bobby, this is
just like we practiced, okay?

369
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:05,876
Okay, go, go, go.
Come on.

370
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:13,016
Watch where you're going, needle dick.

371
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:23,027
Set! 390!

372
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:28,397
- Time for retard to find out what
college football's all about.

373
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:33,029
390! Check, check.

374
00:28:33,105 --> 00:28:36,939
Red, 18! Red, 18!

375
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:40,536
Needle dick! Needle dick!
Needle dick!

376
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:46,377
Yeah!

377
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:48,852
Your name is needle dick.

378
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:52,482
I knew that this was a good idea.

379
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:05,997
Yes!

380
00:29:08,907 --> 00:29:12,536
- Time-out from the game.
- What's he calling time-out for?

381
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:16,240
- Man, what are you doin'?
- Here, this is for you.

382
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:18,249
Enjoy.

383
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:21,912
Hey, Waterboy, you're fired!
- Stop it!

384
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:31,295
Yes! Bobby!

385
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,093
- Ooh-la-la. Yeah, man! Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!

386
00:29:39,171 --> 00:29:42,106
- Slap hands!
- Whatever.

387
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:48,705
Waterboy's killin' 'em.

388
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,216
He's the best tackler
I've seen since Joe Montana.

389
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:55,378
Joe Montana was a quarterback,
you idiot.

390
00:29:55,454 --> 00:29:57,513
I said, "Joe Mantegna."

391
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:02,458
We're tied at seven with
30 seconds to go in the fourth quarter.

392
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:06,157
Eagle cover two.
Eagle cover two. Ready?

393
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,768
Best of luck to you
on-on-on the upcoming play.

394
00:30:10,836 --> 00:30:15,830
- I'll be playin' with your mama tonight.
- Sixty-two.

395
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:19,400
- Move, 22, hut!
- Bernard drops back.

396
00:30:19,478 --> 00:30:22,777
Looks like a screen pass.

397
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:26,477
Sixty-two! Sixty-two!
There you are!

398
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:28,486
Thank you.

399
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:31,489
Number 62 is headed for the end zone.

400
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:35,118
He's at the 40, the 30.
He's almost...

401
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:38,220
Man! Touchdown!
Reds lead.

402
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:43,034
Dropkick. Looks like Boucher
knocked him out cold.

403
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:47,629
I love my mama very much.
Now you know that.

404
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:55,009
The waterboy handed them the game.
What an idiot.

405
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,255
Waterboy, you stink!

406
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:03,057
Nice job, shithead.
You just lost us the game.

407
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:07,189
I'm sorry. Would you please
still be my friend?

408
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,029
No! Get away from me.

409
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,535
Okay.

410
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,434
Excuse me?
May I help you?

411
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,746
Hey, stud.

412
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:26,716
Vicki Vallencourt, this is...
this is quite a pleasant surprise.

413
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:30,915
Yeah, well, I just got out of jail,
and I heard you were playin' football.

414
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,982
Yes, well, I-I-I've...

415
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,798
Yes.

416
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,806
So, let's say we go and get
somethin' to eat, catch up on things.

417
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,842
Oh, uh...

418
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,072
Mama's not a-a-a big fan
of restaurants...

419
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,272
or of-of me going to one.

420
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:01,145
But if-if you'd like,
sometimes,

421
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,450
Mama, she, uh... she like to...
on a Sunday afternoon...

422
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:09,187
There-There's a-a-a grill
with the charcoal b-biscuits.

423
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,695
- You want me to come to a barbecue?
- Yes, that's it.

424
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,493
Sounds great.

425
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,936
And by the way, I hope you like
what I did to y'all lawn mower.

426
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,615
You know that old hag that does
astrology on Good Morning America,

427
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,619
she really ought
to pack it in.

428
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,781
Listen what she said
for Sagittarius. She goes:

429
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,519
"You're gonna be faced with
a difficult decision today."

430
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:45,029
But the thing is-is-is, we're all faced
with difficult decisions every day.

431
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,223
- That's like sayin'
you're gonna eat today.
- Yeah, m-maybe...

432
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,632
by leaving her predictions
vague and generalized,

433
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,569
there's less of a chance of someone
findin' out she's a phony.

434
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,163
Whatever, college boy.

435
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,677
- Don't say college boy. Here comes Mama.
- Oh, okay.

436
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,242
That looks nice, Mama.

437
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,379
- Mmm, here you go, Vicki Vallencourt.
- Thank you.

438
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,549
Mama, Vicki's
an astrologist.

439
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,889
I don't believe in that sort
of thing, personally.

440
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,225
Astronomy is one
of the many tools of the devil.

441
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,925
You sure played great
yesterday, Bobby.

442
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,871
- What did my boy play great?
- Uh, um...

443
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:33,400
Waterboy. Yeah, waterboy.
He played... He played waterboy great.

444
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,914
Everybody who was thirsty
got a drink right away...

445
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:39,610
yesterday at the...
at the football game.

446
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,313
Fool's ball! Bunch of overgrown
monsters manhandling each other.

447
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,913
Remember when that man wanted you
to play fool's ball, Bobby?

448
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:49,893
Yeah, I... He...
Roy Orbison...

449
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,759
Coach Klein.
I-I-I remember.

450
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,856
So, Bobby, did they ever catch
that gorilla...

451
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,424
what escaped from the zoo
and punched you in the eye?

452
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:01,939
No, Mama, he...
The-The search continues.

453
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,706
What would you think if Bobby
did play football, Mrs. Boucher?

454
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,511
Well, I wouldn't
think much of it at all.

455
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,280
And to tell you the truth,
I don't think much of you...

456
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,584
and all your snotty questions,
Miss Vallencourt.

457
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,888
I'm quite disturbed to see
that you're so interested in my boy.

458
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,124
I'm very, very interested
in your boy, Mrs. Boucher.

459
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,824
- Really?
- Mm.

460
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,333
Well, did he tell you
about how much his feet smell?

461
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,098
- Mama.
- He has to wear two pair of socks.

462
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,334
Well, men are supposed
to have stinky feet.

463
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,467
Well, are men
supposed to wear pajamas...

464
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,239
featuring a cartoon character
by the name of Deputy Dog?

465
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,145
- Mama, please.
- Well, you know what?

466
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,649
I happen to find
Deputy Dog to be...

467
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:50,950
very, very sexy.

468
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,752
Did he tell you about
a little bedtime problem?

469
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:57,818
- Mama, I'm beggin' you, don't.
- That's his sheet back there.

470
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:02,497
If you'll excuse me, ladies,
I'm gonna go hang myself.

471
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,468
- Now you see what you done?
- What I did?

472
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:08,802
Now you listen here, cupcake. The
"onliest" woman in my boy's life is me.

473
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:13,037
Nobody's gonna take him away, especially
not some godless Jezebel like you.

474
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,341
Oh, yeah, well your Bobby
is a grown man.

475
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:19,110
And guess what? He can hang out
with whoever he wants!

476
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:21,618
Oh, yes, he can.
Whoever he wants. 'Cept you!

477
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:25,281
Bobby, that-that woman
is the devil.

478
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,517
- I want you to stay away
from her, you hear me?
- Yes, Mama.

479
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,993
Now you come on inside before that
little ol' witch casts a spell on us!

480
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,493
I'm sorry,
Vicki Vallencourt.

481
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,207
Whatever.

482
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:57,721
When we report on the S.C.L.S.U.
Mud Dogs here on Sportscenter,
it's usually to add...

483
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:01,486
another number to their amazing
losing streak, which now stands at 41.

484
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,017
But now, Bobby Boucher
has given us another reason.

485
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,087
In the Mud Dog's latest loss
this past Saturday,

486
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,157
the amazing 31-year-old freshman
set a new N.C.A.A. record...

487
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:12,760
by sacking the quarterback
16 times,

488
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,135
shattering the old record
of seven.

489
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,505
And, oh, by the way, Bobby Boucher
is also the team's waterboy,

490
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,806
which, of course,
begs the question:

491
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,040
What exactly are they putting
in the water...

492
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,049
down in Jackson's Bayou,
Louisiana?

493
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,091
We're deadlocked
at three with less than a minute to go.

494
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,690
We are one family with one dream.

495
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,758
There are 40 of you
on this team, not just one.

496
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:48,567
Bobby can't do this by himself. Now get
out there and make something happen!

497
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,040
- All right, sacrifice
your bodies. Go, go, go!

498
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:55,443
Thank you. Bobby, you're gonna
have to do this by yourself...

499
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,845
because there is nobody
on this team that's any good.

500
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,714
Now look, I can't stand
losing anymore.

501
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,754
We've got to win one game. Can you
go out there and make something happen?

502
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,585
- Visualize and attack.
- Yeah.

503
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,215
- Visualize and attack. Please!
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

504
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:10,022
Please!

505
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,427
Central Kentucky's down
to their third straight quarterback.

506
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,989
Good news, folks.
First-string quarterback, Tommy Gardner,

507
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,092
does not have a broken neck.

508
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,798
Blue, 52!
Blue, 52! Hut!

509
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,933
I forbid you to talk to
that enchantress. She's the devil!

510
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,911
She's not the devil. She's the
most beautiful woman in the world.

511
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,677
- I never said she was the devil.
- She's the most beautiful woman
in the world.

512
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,775
Oh, please, don't hurt me!

513
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,813
Follow the...
Come on!

514
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,859
You crazy man!
Okay, okay, okay!

515
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,589
It's a safety!
They win, they win, they win!

516
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,860
With the help of Boucher,
the losing streak is over!

517
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,198
I'm so sorry, Mama.
Please, forgive me.

518
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,573
I love you so much, Mama.
I love you.

519
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,106
- I love you too.
- We won!

520
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,941
We won, baby! It's gonna be a big
party tonight, and you're going!

521
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:05,346
- Me? Party?
- Yeah, baby!

522
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,787
Party! Party!

523
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,428
Hey! Nice suit.

524
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,867
Thank you.
It was my daddy's.

525
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:31,397
Mama don't know I'm here,
but I took these outta the icebox:
Louisiana frog cakes.

526
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,568
Thanks.

527
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,375
- Come on in.
- Hey, Bobby Boucher!

528
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,144
Look who's here:
Sergeant Stutter.

529
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:43,983
- Want a beer?
- I'll take a Scotch and water.
Hold the Scotch.

530
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,491
- You just make a joke, Bobby?
- Yes, I did.

531
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,584
Good one.

532
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,927
Now that you finally won a game, right,
you feel looser, the pressure is off,

533
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,695
and that will lead
to a lot more victories.

534
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:02,228
- Yeah, that and a waterboy
getting 20 sacks a game.
- That too.

535
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,336
Professor!

536
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,243
We still havin' that test on amphibians
and reptiles next Friday?

537
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:14,250
Yes, sir. That is,
if it's all right with you.

538
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:19,187
- Of course, it is.
- My best regards to your dear mama.

539
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:22,089
Let's talk to the waterboy.

540
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,354
You played amazing
at the game today, Bobby.

541
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:28,421
And you are so cute.
Is there a girl you're seein'?

542
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:33,527
Seein'? Uh, uh, I see
a lot of girls.

543
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,868
I see a lot of guys too.

544
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,431
I think that's sexy.

545
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,034
You ever been with a guy and a girl
at the same time?

546
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,046
Oh, yeah, plenty of times.

547
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,641
The other night, I was with my mama
and Coach Klein at the same time.

548
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:52,321
You are a bad boy.
I wish you were my boyfriend.

549
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,918
Oh, thank you, but, see, there's
this girl, Vicki Vallencourt.

550
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,121
She may be the devil.
Mama said that.

551
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,290
Consequently, I am prohibited
from contact with her.

552
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:06,700
But I hope to get past that
one day 'cause she's nice to talk to.

553
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,112
Oh, oh.

554
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,021
Yo, we have a very special
guest here today.

555
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:07,894
Let's have a warm L.T. welcome
for Bobby Boucher. Come on, Bobby.

556
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,297
Thank you, Mr. Lawrence Taylor.

557
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:14,098
Tell me, what is your secret?
How do you find yourself
in the right position all the time?

558
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,105
That-That-That's
a good question.

559
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:20,132
What-What happens is, the-the-the
center has-has the ball first.

560
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,270
And-And-And the quarterback
will say, "Hike."

561
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:26,282
That's when the c-center puts the ball
in-into the hands of the quarterback.

562
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,478
So what I do is,
I-I start tacklin' the quarterback,

563
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,953
unless he give the ball
to-to s-somebody else,

564
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:35,219
in which case,
I-I try to tackle that person.

565
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,930
Hmm? Children, which brings me
to my next point:

566
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,989
Don't smoke crack.

567
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,170
Vicki Vallencourt.
What you doin' here?

568
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,944
Oh, nothin'.
I was just thinkin'...

569
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,578
about stealin' L.T.'s Porsche
over there.

570
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:07,988
But I suppose I ought to
be movin' on before I get you
in trouble with your mama.

571
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:12,961
Well, Mr. Coach Klein said that
what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

572
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:17,865
So maybe we could
ride home together.

573
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,769
- Really?
- If you'd like to.

574
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,467
Okay.

575
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,773
Who got the hooch?

576
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,848
You can sit down,
if you'd like.

577
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:11,314
Vicki Vallencourt,
I figured...

578
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:15,256
'cause you're interested in astrology
and mystical stuff like that,

579
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,760
you might appreciate this.

580
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,930
That's water
from a glacier in Alaska.

581
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,562
It-It was blessed
by a-an Eskimo medicine man.

582
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:33,372
- It's cold!
- Yes, it's always cold.
That's why it's so special.

583
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,186
That-That was...
That-That-That-That happened...

584
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:56,562
That-That happened to be
my-my first time with-with lips...

585
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,570
and-and-and-and-and
and-and-and-and-and the-the tongue.

586
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:04,404
That was your tongue.
I... I believe it was...

587
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,636
I never did that before.

588
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,644
Well, if that was
your first kiss,

589
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:12,739
then I bet it's the first time
you've seen a pair of these.

590
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,851
Yes, yes, that is
a-another first for me,

591
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:23,154
and I-I appreciate what-what-what
you're showin' me right now.

592
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:29,260
Vicki-Vicki Vallencourt,
I-I think Mama's up.

593
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,902
Devil, devil, devil.

594
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,736
You better get goin'.

595
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,844
My God, Bobby, I mean, sometimes,
I just don't know why I bother with you.

596
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,280
You ain't even a man.

597
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,384
It looks like
the Cinderella S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs,

598
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,721
led by linebacker
Bobby Boucher,

599
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:59,524
are gonna fall one victory short
of that Bourbon Bowl bid.

600
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,861
Iowa could win the game
by nailing this 20-yard field goal.

601
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,697
Yeah, but the Mud Dogs have played
a sensational football game.

602
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,564
Let's take a look at the way Boucher
entered the Hawkeyes' last drive.

603
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,362
Let's take a look at the way Boucher
entered the Hawkeyes' last drive.

604
00:45:10,433 --> 00:45:13,891
Here we see Boucher
instantly penetratin' the pocket.

605
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:19,664
There's a lot of pain
and shame in those eyes.

606
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,506
Friends, it's all over.

607
00:45:21,578 --> 00:45:25,105
- My leg!
- Wow, that is a disturbing image.

608
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,615
Difficult to watch, Chris.

609
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:30,482
Whoo! My God!

610
00:45:30,553 --> 00:45:34,922
Gonna kick some names
and take some ass!

611
00:45:34,991 --> 00:45:37,459
Bobby!

612
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:40,860
Water sucks.
Gatorade is better.

613
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,797
- What?
- Use it on the field.

614
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:46,597
Waterboy, Waterboy, Waterboy!

615
00:45:54,177 --> 00:45:58,944
Gatorade not only quenches your thirst
better, it tastes better too, idiot.

616
00:45:59,015 --> 00:46:02,075
You're-You're-You're drinkin'
the wrong water.

617
00:46:02,152 --> 00:46:06,111
- Gatorade.
- H2O.

618
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:10,626
- Gatorade!
- H2O!

619
00:46:15,198 --> 00:46:18,656
Stop saying that. You don't
mean that. You're bad people.

620
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,982
And my friend, Chris,

621
00:46:40,056 --> 00:46:43,082
the Mud Dogs are goin'
to the Bourbon Bowl.

622
00:46:45,462 --> 00:46:48,556
With yesterday's come-from-behind
victory, the S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs...

623
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:51,498
earned a New Year's Day date with Red
Beaulieu and the Louisiana Cougars...

624
00:46:51,568 --> 00:46:53,536
in the first annual
Bourbon Bowl.

625
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:56,970
But not only has the waterboy
changed S.C.L.S.U.'s fortunes,

626
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,531
he's got other teams looking
around the sidelines for talent.

627
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:03,045
In fact, yesterday, Michigan,
devastated by injury,

628
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:05,707
experimented with their towel boy
at wide receiver.

629
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:10,617
- But the towel boy ran into
a laundry list of problems.

630
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,569
You know, when I see
so many of you here tonight,

631
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:40,878
it reminds me just about how special
this season really was.

632
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,145
Not just for the team.

633
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:45,653
Not just for the students.

634
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:48,657
But for each and every
one of you...

635
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:52,491
in our small corner
of Louisiana!

636
00:47:52,562 --> 00:47:56,430
You can do it!

637
00:47:56,499 --> 00:48:00,663
Oh, yes, we can,
and, yes, we will.

638
00:48:00,737 --> 00:48:02,602
Because we've got...

639
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:07,109
a young man who has been
so vital to our success.

640
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:10,203
A wonderful student-athlete.

641
00:48:11,915 --> 00:48:14,884
And a wonderful friend.

642
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:17,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bobby Boucher!

643
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:28,122
- Waterboy, number one!
- You can do it!

644
00:48:34,471 --> 00:48:36,632
Thank you so much...

645
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,731
for bein' my friends.

646
00:48:38,808 --> 00:48:42,972
You can do it!

647
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:46,482
I'd also like to take
this opportunity...

648
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:49,575
to tell you that my mama
don't know how I play football,

649
00:48:49,652 --> 00:48:54,419
so if-if you could not tell
my mama I-I play football,
that would be for the best.

650
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:17,776
We must be a little lost. We're tryin'
to get to the Bourbon Bowl.

651
00:49:17,847 --> 00:49:21,010
Looks like we ended up
in Retardville, U.S.A.

652
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:28,351
Hey, Waterboy, you fixin'
to tackle all of us?

653
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:34,018
- Kick his water-lovin' ass, Greg.
- I asked you a question, dumb ass.

654
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:39,668
You even exhale,
and I will saw your head off.

655
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:42,967
You can do it!
Cut his fucking head off!

656
00:49:44,707 --> 00:49:48,370
Hold it, hold it. Just a minute.
Now what is the problem here, honey?

657
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,936
I mean, whatever it is,
we don't want this to get physical.

658
00:49:52,015 --> 00:49:53,949
Right, Klein?

659
00:49:54,017 --> 00:49:56,679
Yeah, well, your team actin'
like a bunch of shitheads.

660
00:49:56,753 --> 00:50:02,123
This is not how ambassadors
for the University of Louisiana
are supposed to act.

661
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:06,890
So now you just get back on the bus.

662
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:11,332
However,
assault with a deadly weapon,

663
00:50:11,401 --> 00:50:13,835
very, very serious offense.

664
00:50:13,903 --> 00:50:18,237
Officer, get her
little country ass outta here.

665
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:21,141
Thank you, Vicki.

666
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,974
Let's go.

667
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:28,916
Ah! It's the waterboy!

668
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:30,919
I got something for you.

669
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:35,754
This is his transcript from
South Lafayette High School...

670
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,055
in Cherokee Plains,
Louisiana.

671
00:50:38,127 --> 00:50:40,527
Now the problem with that...

672
00:50:40,597 --> 00:50:45,660
is there ain't no South Lafayette High
School in Cherokee Plains, Louisiana.

673
00:50:45,735 --> 00:50:50,001
So obviously, this is a fake!

674
00:50:50,073 --> 00:50:54,134
However, this is not a fake.

675
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,872
This is from the N.C.A.A.

676
00:50:56,946 --> 00:50:59,540
They don't think you ought
to play football no more.

677
00:51:01,117 --> 00:51:03,745
So allow me to say this to you
one more time:

678
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,754
You're fired.

679
00:51:05,822 --> 00:51:08,882
Oh, no!
We suck again!

680
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:12,485
Ever see a championship ring?

681
00:51:12,562 --> 00:51:16,054
- Don't be messin' with the champ.
Come on, Laski.
- You didn't go to high school?

682
00:51:16,132 --> 00:51:19,431
I was home schooled.
I-I didn't know I needed...

683
00:51:19,502 --> 00:51:23,939
- Forged a fake transcript.
- No, no, I-I-I didn't.

684
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:26,737
- The waterboy's a cheater.
Cut his head off.

685
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:30,643
Listen, everybody!
This don't change nothin'!

686
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,910
We played as a team,
we won as a team.

687
00:51:33,983 --> 00:51:36,144
And just because
the waterboy's a cheater,

688
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:39,052
don't change the fact
that the real Mud Dogs...

689
00:51:39,122 --> 00:51:41,613
are gonna kick
some Cougar ass.

690
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:43,989
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

691
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:48,759
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

692
00:51:48,831 --> 00:51:52,824
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

693
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:56,770
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

694
00:51:56,839 --> 00:51:58,807
That's the way!

695
00:52:05,448 --> 00:52:07,939
Sorry, Bobby.

696
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:18,351
Believe me,
I-I understand.

697
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:20,952
Yeah, and you're
deeply appreciated, Mr. Dodd.

698
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:24,557
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

699
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:26,897
Good news, Bobby.

700
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:30,427
- The N.C.A.A. is gonna allow you
to play in the Bourbon Bowl.
- Yes.

701
00:52:30,506 --> 00:52:32,770
You just have to pass the high school
equivalency test.

702
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:36,175
It's not the test, Coach.

703
00:52:36,245 --> 00:52:39,544
Everybody hates me.

704
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:43,244
That's not true.

705
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:46,516
One man said he wanted
to decapitate me.

706
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:50,423
Nobody else thought that
to be too bad of an idea.

707
00:52:53,262 --> 00:52:55,628
Somebody made me
look like a-a-a cheater.

708
00:52:55,698 --> 00:52:59,293
I did it. I did it. I did it!
I did it! I did it!

709
00:52:59,368 --> 00:53:03,236
- It was me.
- Why?

710
00:53:06,775 --> 00:53:11,803
Because I wanted you to play.
Because you were my way out, Bobby.

711
00:53:11,881 --> 00:53:15,044
'Cause it was the only way
to get you in.

712
00:53:15,117 --> 00:53:17,711
I am so sorry.

713
00:53:17,786 --> 00:53:20,619
Why didn't you s-stick up for me
down by the river?

714
00:53:23,692 --> 00:53:27,594
The truth is, I fled.

715
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,359
I came into my office,
I went under my desk, I cried.

716
00:53:30,432 --> 00:53:33,890
I cried. I cried
like a ten-year-old girl!

717
00:53:41,076 --> 00:53:43,101
Red and I have a history.

718
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,409
Twenty years ago,
we were assistants to Coach Cavanaugh...

719
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:48,917
at the University
of Louisiana.

720
00:53:48,984 --> 00:53:52,545
Red ran the practices,
and I used to come up with the plays.

721
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:56,083
Oh, boy, was I good.

722
00:53:57,826 --> 00:54:02,593
I would write these foolproof plays
in my little green notebook that I had.

723
00:54:02,665 --> 00:54:05,793
- The opposition
didn't even know what hit 'em.

724
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,802
And when Coach Cavanaugh
was going to retire,

725
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,362
me and Red, we just knew that one of us
was gonna be his successor.

726
00:54:14,677 --> 00:54:17,111
- Hey, Red.
- How ya doin'?

727
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,278
Come by to wish me luck?

728
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:26,947
Well, not exactly, no, no.
Actually, I come by to get you
to do ol' Red a little favor.

729
00:54:27,022 --> 00:54:29,217
Sure. What's up?

730
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:33,284
Well, you know that green
notebook you use to write
all them football plays in?

731
00:54:33,362 --> 00:54:37,628
Well, I need to show Cavanaugh that
I can come up with some good play ideas.

732
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,635
But you didn't come up
with them.

733
00:54:40,703 --> 00:54:44,036
They're my plays.
I need them.

734
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:49,669
Klein, I'm gonna have
this book one way or another,

735
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:52,680
so you might as well let the damn
thing go, 'cause if you don't,

736
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,546
it's gonna get awfully,
awfully physical around here.

737
00:54:55,618 --> 00:54:59,213
And I don't think
you want that, do you? Huh?

738
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:07,425
Of course, Red got the job.
Next day, fired me.

739
00:55:07,496 --> 00:55:09,691
Once he had my notebook,
he didn't need me anymore.

740
00:55:12,034 --> 00:55:13,968
I didn't take it very well.

741
00:55:14,036 --> 00:55:17,699
No, Grandma,
I didn't get it.

742
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:20,139
I can't believe it myself.

743
00:55:20,209 --> 00:55:25,010
I know.
I'm so numb.

744
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,605
I just hate him,
I hate him, I hate him.

745
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,011
That is a terrible story, Coach.

746
00:55:32,087 --> 00:55:35,420
- But why-why don't you just
come up with some new plays?
- I tried.

747
00:55:35,491 --> 00:55:37,425
- I can't.
- Yes.

748
00:55:37,493 --> 00:55:42,760
I guess I have a mental block,
you know, ever since Red took
my playbook and my manhood.

749
00:55:42,831 --> 00:55:46,426
I knew what he was gonna do!

750
00:55:46,502 --> 00:55:49,437
And I just didn't fight back.

751
00:55:49,505 --> 00:55:53,305
Well, you're gonna show him
that you're a man on Saturday.

752
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:57,111
And I'm gonna show everybody
that I'm not a dummy.

753
00:55:57,179 --> 00:56:00,410
I'm gonna go study.

754
00:56:05,187 --> 00:56:09,624
Mama, maybe you could stop brushin'
my hair so I can read.

755
00:56:09,692 --> 00:56:11,887
Read?

756
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,020
You don't have to read.

757
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:20,863
- What you readin' for?
- 'Cause I enjoys it, Mama.

758
00:56:20,936 --> 00:56:24,497
Don't look like to me you enjoys it,
sittin' there all grouchy.

759
00:56:24,573 --> 00:56:29,101
Mama, I gotta read this book
and six other books tonight,
or else I can't play foot...

760
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,116
ball.

761
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:39,382
Fool's ball? You playin'
the fool's ball behind my back?

762
00:56:39,455 --> 00:56:42,049
The only reason I'm doin' this
so, so I can go to school.

763
00:56:42,124 --> 00:56:46,686
School? You goin' to school?

764
00:56:46,762 --> 00:56:49,230
Sorry, Mama. I wanted to tell you.

765
00:56:49,298 --> 00:56:53,735
You off gallivantin' with your fancy
fool's ball friends at school,

766
00:56:53,802 --> 00:56:58,569
while I'm sittin' here all day
with nobody to keep me company,
except Steve?

767
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:03,140
The chickens are comin' home
to roost, Bobby Boucher.

768
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:06,875
You reap the fruit
of your selfish ways.

769
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:09,179
You're gonna lose all your
fancy fool's ball games...

770
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:12,414
and you're gonna fail your big exam,
because school is...

771
00:57:12,488 --> 00:57:14,422
The devil?

772
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:17,721
Everything is the devil
to you, Mama!

773
00:57:17,793 --> 00:57:21,695
Well, I like school,
and I like football!

774
00:57:21,764 --> 00:57:25,325
And I'm gonna keep doin' them both
because they make me feel good!

775
00:57:26,802 --> 00:57:29,464
And by the way, Mama,
alligators are ornery...

776
00:57:29,538 --> 00:57:32,132
because of their
medulla oblongata!

777
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,072
And I like Vicki,
and she likes me back!

778
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,710
And she showed me her boobies,
and I liked them too!

779
00:57:57,499 --> 00:58:01,993
The Louisiana High School
Equivalency Examination...

780
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:05,403
consists of 300
multiple choice questions.

781
00:58:05,474 --> 00:58:09,137
You have three hours.
Good luck to you, sir.

782
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,403
Ben Franklin.

783
00:58:45,414 --> 00:58:48,281
Mama, when did Ben Franklin
invent electricity?

784
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:52,013
That's nonsense!
I invented electricity.

785
00:58:52,087 --> 00:58:54,749
Ben Franklin is the devil!

786
00:59:05,627 --> 00:59:08,255
I can't believe
you got a 97!

787
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:10,559
I-I-I can't believe
that I-I-I told Mama...

788
00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:12,759
that I got feelings for you.

789
00:59:12,834 --> 00:59:16,600
Well, welcome to your manhood,
Bobby Boucher.

790
00:59:16,671 --> 00:59:19,606
When we get a little more time,
I'll welcome you properly.

791
00:59:19,674 --> 00:59:22,074
Yes, once again, I'm not quite sure
what that means, but...

792
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:24,077
You know, we should get goin'.

793
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:26,079
I told the coach that
I'd drive to the game with him.

794
00:59:29,517 --> 00:59:32,577
I was with you from two to four
last night. You-You tell them.

795
00:59:34,689 --> 00:59:39,752
Bobby, your mama got sick this mornin'.
She's in the hospital.

796
00:59:42,263 --> 00:59:44,561
Mama, what have I done?

797
00:59:44,632 --> 00:59:46,566
I'm so sorry, Mama.

798
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:54,668
Doctors say... they can't figure out
what's wrong with her.

799
00:59:54,742 --> 00:59:56,903
But I know what's wrong.

800
00:59:56,978 --> 00:59:59,208
She got a broken heart
because of me.

801
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,373
Bobby, that's ridiculous.

802
01:00:01,449 --> 01:00:06,148
Everybody else in this town
turn on me at the drop of a hat.

803
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:09,713
Mama is the only one who really cares
if I live or die.

804
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:12,259
She my whole world.

805
01:00:13,795 --> 01:00:16,559
Will you just
leave us alone?

806
01:00:16,631 --> 01:00:20,032
She'll be fine, Bobby.
We better get going.

807
01:00:20,101 --> 01:00:22,626
God knows what the team is doing
with just Farmer Fran watching them.

808
01:00:46,694 --> 01:00:49,458
You really made it look like home.

809
01:00:56,604 --> 01:00:59,505
How's that, Steve?

810
01:01:16,558 --> 01:01:20,119
Take a look. The crowd has
never been bigger. You know why?

811
01:01:20,195 --> 01:01:22,686
Look who's on the television, Mama.

812
01:01:22,764 --> 01:01:24,698
The devil.

813
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:26,700
500,000 intimate...

814
01:01:36,344 --> 01:01:39,745
Who there? Who there?

815
01:01:52,894 --> 01:01:56,159
Three, two, one!

816
01:01:56,231 --> 01:01:59,098
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year, Mama.

817
01:02:01,302 --> 01:02:05,864
My resolution is to
never hurt you again.

818
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:21,949
Waterboy! Waterboy!

819
01:02:22,023 --> 01:02:25,823
Waterboy! Waterboy!

820
01:02:49,017 --> 01:02:52,919
Bobby Boucher, all these folks
are here tonight...

821
01:02:52,987 --> 01:02:55,114
to tell you that
they're sorry...

822
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,248
that they're sorry
for not supportin' you...

823
01:02:57,325 --> 01:02:59,793
when it meant the most.

824
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:03,820
But you do have friends,
and one of 'em wants to say somethin'.

825
01:03:03,898 --> 01:03:05,832
Come on.

826
01:03:08,736 --> 01:03:12,729
I am not what you
would call a handsome man.

827
01:03:14,342 --> 01:03:17,743
The good Lord chose not
to bless me with...

828
01:03:17,812 --> 01:03:23,478
with charm, athletic ability
or a fully functional brain.

829
01:03:24,886 --> 01:03:29,016
You see,
you're an inspiration...

830
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:32,617
to all of us who,
who weren't born handsome...

831
01:03:32,694 --> 01:03:38,132
and charming
and cool and...

832
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,504
- I can't! I can't!
- It's okay.

833
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:49,100
Bobby, if your mama
could only hear us right now,

834
01:03:49,177 --> 01:03:51,668
we would tell her...

835
01:03:51,746 --> 01:03:54,772
what a fine boy she raised,

836
01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:58,376
and how much your playing football
means to this town.

837
01:03:59,654 --> 01:04:02,987
But she can't hear you,
'cause she's unconscious.

838
01:04:04,659 --> 01:04:07,651
I'm sorry
to disappoint you all,

839
01:04:07,729 --> 01:04:10,391
but please keep
your voices down...

840
01:04:10,465 --> 01:04:13,093
so my mama
can get her rest.

841
01:04:21,676 --> 01:04:25,578
Well, wake her ass up!
We gotta win tomorrow!

842
01:04:47,335 --> 01:04:51,704
Mama! Thank God, you're okay.
I'm so sorry.

843
01:04:51,773 --> 01:04:54,241
I was so bad, Mama.
You were right about everything.

844
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:56,572
- I've been a real knucklehead.
- Oh, hush, baby.

845
01:04:56,644 --> 01:05:00,045
You should've seen this
a long time ago.

846
01:05:00,114 --> 01:05:02,048
Oh, my word!

847
01:05:02,116 --> 01:05:04,846
- Is that my daddy?
- No, no.

848
01:05:04,919 --> 01:05:08,047
That's a guy I dated
before I met your father.

849
01:05:08,122 --> 01:05:10,886
Oh, you could iron
a shirt on his stomach.

850
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:14,621
Well, that was lust, not love.
Turn the page.

851
01:05:18,032 --> 01:05:20,057
There's your daddy.

852
01:05:20,134 --> 01:05:22,568
- So handsome.
- Oh.

853
01:05:22,637 --> 01:05:24,571
Read on.

854
01:05:26,774 --> 01:05:29,265
"Dear Helen."
Who's Helen?

855
01:05:31,312 --> 01:05:33,280
That's my first name, Bobby.

856
01:05:33,347 --> 01:05:35,941
Ohh!

857
01:05:37,685 --> 01:05:40,051
"I have arrived here
in New Orleans.

858
01:05:40,121 --> 01:05:43,181
"It is even more beautiful
than in the picture books.

859
01:05:43,257 --> 01:05:45,987
"I'm sure I'll have
no problem finding work,

860
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:50,190
"so you can expect my next letter
to contain lots of money.

861
01:05:50,264 --> 01:05:52,323
Your loving husband, Robert."

862
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,334
That's nice, Mama.

863
01:05:54,402 --> 01:05:58,771
"Dear Helen."
That's you.

864
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,071
"I found a job
as a lemonade vendor,

865
01:06:02,143 --> 01:06:04,236
"but sorry,
no money yet.

866
01:06:04,312 --> 01:06:06,940
"New Orleans is
an expensive city.

867
01:06:07,014 --> 01:06:10,811
"Expensive, but fun.
Hope all is well.

868
01:06:10,944 --> 01:06:13,538
Robert."

869
01:06:13,614 --> 01:06:16,139
"To Whom It May Concern:

870
01:06:16,216 --> 01:06:19,049
"This will be my last letter.

871
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,782
"We have grown apart
over these last six weeks.

872
01:06:22,856 --> 01:06:26,758
"I now have
two loves in my life:

873
01:06:26,827 --> 01:06:31,321
"big-city livin' and
a voodoo woman named Phyllis.

874
01:06:31,398 --> 01:06:34,367
Ciao, Roberto."

875
01:06:34,435 --> 01:06:37,734
He changed his name
to Roberto.

876
01:06:37,805 --> 01:06:40,433
I guess he thought
it was more exotic.

877
01:06:40,507 --> 01:06:43,499
But Mama says that...
I mean, you say that...

878
01:06:43,577 --> 01:06:47,843
Bobby, your daddy didn't
go into no Peace Corps.

879
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:51,609
He deserted us, baby.

880
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,454
No, no, Mama.
You-You...

881
01:06:55,522 --> 01:06:58,252
You shouldn't be dredgin' up these
painful memories in your condition.

882
01:06:58,325 --> 01:07:01,226
Oh, hush. Your mama's
as healthy as an ox,

883
01:07:01,295 --> 01:07:03,695
and as dumb as one to boot.

884
01:07:03,764 --> 01:07:06,232
I was so scared
you'd abandon me too.

885
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:11,602
And I made you abandon
all those people who depend on ya.

886
01:07:11,672 --> 01:07:14,470
I hid you away from the world,
Bobby Boucher.

887
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:17,942
But I can't hog you
to myself no more,

888
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:21,310
because everyone's seen
how wonderful you are.

889
01:07:22,816 --> 01:07:26,217
- Oh, Mama!
- Now.

890
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:32,818
You go play fool's ball
with your friends.

891
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,929
Welcome to ABC's coverage
of the Bourbon Bowl.

892
01:07:35,996 --> 01:07:39,454
Good afternoon, everybody.
I'm Brent Musburger,
along with my colleague, Dan Fouts.

893
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:43,299
And the big story here, Dan, is a game
that's lost some of its luster...

894
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:47,067
without its star player,
the waterboy Bobby Boucher.

895
01:07:47,141 --> 01:07:49,939
You know, Red's got a couple
of solid early rounders out there.

896
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:53,639
I know, but I really wanted to scout
that waterboy. Reminds me of Greg Lloyd.

897
01:07:53,714 --> 01:07:56,148
- Naw. "Hack" Thomas.
- Whatever.

898
01:07:56,216 --> 01:07:58,150
Is she ready?

899
01:07:58,218 --> 01:08:00,982
Oh, yeah.
She's more than ready.

900
01:08:01,054 --> 01:08:05,081
Come on, Bobby!
You'll miss the boat!

901
01:08:08,896 --> 01:08:10,830
Let's go, ladies.

902
01:08:16,503 --> 01:08:18,494
We are underway!

903
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:21,132
The opening kickoff
is a beauty!

904
01:08:24,111 --> 01:08:26,841
Holdsworth is gonna bring it out
from nine yards deep.

905
01:08:26,914 --> 01:08:28,541
Come on.

906
01:08:28,615 --> 01:08:30,879
Yeah!

907
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:35,445
Dan, they're showing no respect
for this team without Boucher.

908
01:08:35,522 --> 01:08:38,855
Good reason, Brent.
109 yards untouched.

909
01:08:38,926 --> 01:08:41,554
Touchdown, Cougars! They strike first.

910
01:08:48,635 --> 01:08:50,728
Time running down in the first quarter.

911
01:08:50,804 --> 01:08:53,068
Cougars lead is 17-0.

912
01:08:54,942 --> 01:08:56,967
Set!

913
01:08:57,044 --> 01:08:58,978
Three! Thirty-three!

914
01:08:59,046 --> 01:09:02,709
Three! Thirty-three! Hut!

915
01:09:04,918 --> 01:09:07,386
Dan, that quarterback can't even
get the ball off before he's hit.

916
01:09:07,454 --> 01:09:09,684
It's as if they're in
the offensive huddle with him.

917
01:09:13,727 --> 01:09:16,127
Are you gonna finish
that hot dog, Jimmy?

918
01:09:16,196 --> 01:09:18,494
Ugh! Now I'm not.

919
01:09:18,565 --> 01:09:21,557
Mama, you think
we'll make it on time?

920
01:09:21,635 --> 01:09:25,537
Hang on! I'll show you what
A.J. Foyt taught me.

921
01:09:29,543 --> 01:09:32,307
That's the end of
the half. The Cougars are dominating.

922
01:09:32,379 --> 01:09:36,315
Let's hope the Mud Dogs
can make some adjustments.

923
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,317
- Well, they better, 'cause they suck.
- Mm-hmm.

924
01:09:44,258 --> 01:09:46,488
Anybody got an idea?

925
01:09:50,597 --> 01:09:52,531
Hey.

926
01:09:54,301 --> 01:09:58,533
- Remember the time Bobby tackled
the referee by mistake?

927
01:09:58,605 --> 01:10:01,005
Yeah, that was pretty funny.

928
01:10:01,074 --> 01:10:03,474
How about the time he tackled
the guy from Louisville...

929
01:10:03,543 --> 01:10:06,376
and threw him into the stands?

930
01:10:08,115 --> 01:10:12,916
Y'all remember when he intercepted
the ball and his pants fell off?

931
01:10:12,986 --> 01:10:16,353
And then he ran for
the touchdown, bare-assed.

932
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:22,724
Remember the time Bobby...

933
01:10:28,402 --> 01:10:32,168
Remember when Bobby Boucher
showed up at halftime and the
Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl?

934
01:10:38,745 --> 01:10:43,409
Hey, sorry about givin' you
so much shit this year.

935
01:10:43,483 --> 01:10:45,747
You're the heart and soul
of this team, Bobby.

936
01:10:45,819 --> 01:10:48,549
Ain't one of us could've
passed that test.

937
01:10:48,622 --> 01:10:52,422
Thank you all so much
for being my friends.

938
01:10:52,492 --> 01:10:55,950
Well, let's wait till later
to hold hands and kiss.
We got a Bowl game to win.

939
01:10:56,029 --> 01:10:57,826
- Right?
- Yeah!

940
01:10:57,898 --> 01:11:00,332
- Two, three!
- Mud Dogs! Woof!

941
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,335
In a dramatic turn of events,

942
01:11:03,403 --> 01:11:06,497
Bobby Boucher
just arrived at halftime.

943
01:11:06,573 --> 01:11:10,976
And on a fan boat, Brent. His mother
drove him right into the stadium.

944
01:11:19,953 --> 01:11:22,854
Waterboy! Waterboy!

945
01:11:22,923 --> 01:11:26,256
Waterboy! Waterboy!

946
01:11:26,326 --> 01:11:29,227
Waterboy! Waterboy!

947
01:11:29,296 --> 01:11:32,026
Fool's ball's
not for the devil.

948
01:11:32,099 --> 01:11:34,033
It's for my Bobby.

949
01:11:34,101 --> 01:11:38,231
Time to open up
some whoop-ass.

950
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:48,179
Shit, he showed up.
All right, look.

951
01:11:48,248 --> 01:11:52,548
Just relax. Relax. Go in there and
do exactly like we planned. Go, go, go!

952
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:55,520
This could be the start
of some high drama, folks.

953
01:11:55,589 --> 01:11:57,853
Or are the Mud Dogs
too far behind?

954
01:11:57,924 --> 01:12:00,518
Bobby Boucher
is on defense.

955
01:12:00,594 --> 01:12:04,086
- The Cougars are coming out
from their own 20 yard line.
- Hut! Hut!

956
01:12:04,164 --> 01:12:06,758
The pitch.
It's a reverse!

957
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:09,358
Boucher's not fooled.

958
01:12:09,436 --> 01:12:12,269
Fumble!
Robideaux's got it!

959
01:12:12,339 --> 01:12:14,068
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

960
01:12:16,209 --> 01:12:19,940
- Boy, Boucher knocked
the poop out of him.
- "Poop"?

961
01:12:23,216 --> 01:12:25,150
Slap hands!
Slap hands!

962
01:12:26,953 --> 01:12:31,185
Drink up, now. I want you girls to
sober up. Have faith in my Bobby.

963
01:12:31,258 --> 01:12:34,386
The Mud Dogs are
faced with yet another third and long.

964
01:12:34,461 --> 01:12:36,554
- Hut!
- Grenouille back to pass.

965
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:41,966
He's gonna be stuffed again!
And the Mud Dogs offense is
still unable to move that ball.

966
01:12:42,035 --> 01:12:45,300
But the way their defense
is fired up, they still have
a shot at winning this game.

967
01:12:45,372 --> 01:12:47,465
Blake, come here. Look.

968
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:51,033
Now, what if we, uh...

969
01:12:53,246 --> 01:12:56,613
Trust me. Go, go, go, go, go.

970
01:12:56,683 --> 01:13:01,177
The Cougars lead 27-7 in
the middle of the third quarter.

971
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:03,313
And he takes a knee?

972
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:07,190
Y'all gonna play or what?

973
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,593
How do you all like my new offense?

974
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:15,501
All right, it's second and 12...

975
01:13:15,569 --> 01:13:19,266
- as the Cougars line up on the ball.
- Hut! Hut!

976
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:24,742
What is Red Beaulieu doing,
refusing to play offense?

977
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:27,616
- Dan, this is bizarre.
- No, it's not, Brent.

978
01:13:27,687 --> 01:13:31,054
It's brilliant, because Red is
taking the waterboy out of the game.

979
01:13:31,124 --> 01:13:33,684
By kneeling down
three times and punting,

980
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,785
he's gonna make the Mud Dog
offense try to beat him.

981
01:13:35,862 --> 01:13:38,296
And the way they're playing
today, that's impossible.

982
01:13:38,364 --> 01:13:40,457
Well, the Mud Dog's
most valuable player,

983
01:13:40,533 --> 01:13:43,730
the linebacker they call "the Waterboy,"
is now powerless.

984
01:13:43,803 --> 01:13:49,002
That means Coach Klein will have
to find another way to outfox Red.

985
01:13:49,075 --> 01:13:53,478
Mud Dogs call a time-out.

986
01:13:53,613 --> 01:13:56,275
Mr. Coach Klein. Mr. Coach Klein!

987
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:59,079
Mr. Coach Klein!

988
01:13:59,152 --> 01:14:03,384
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna get a hot pretzel.

989
01:14:03,456 --> 01:14:06,323
Mr. Coach Klein, are you afraid
of Red Beaulieu?

990
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:12,064
I am petrified of him.

991
01:14:12,132 --> 01:14:15,226
Well, why don't you pretend
that Red Beaulieu...

992
01:14:15,301 --> 01:14:17,496
is somebody that
you're-you're not afraid of.

993
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:20,300
- Pretend?
- Yes.

994
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:23,001
Visualize somebody
you're not afraid of.

995
01:14:23,076 --> 01:14:26,239
- And then attack, like you told me.
- I'll try.

996
01:14:26,312 --> 01:14:29,281
Well, he's right over there.

997
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,855
Little baby.

998
01:14:42,929 --> 01:14:45,420
Yeah.

999
01:14:45,498 --> 01:14:50,435
Hello, little baby.

1000
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:55,974
A poo-poo?
Do you have a poo-poo?

1001
01:14:56,042 --> 01:14:57,942
Yes.

1002
01:14:58,011 --> 01:15:00,479
Okay. Now.

1003
01:15:00,547 --> 01:15:02,981
This is what we're gonna do.
He's gonna come here...

1004
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,253
Come and get
this one, Cougars.

1005
01:15:14,327 --> 01:15:16,727
Red, 22! Hike!

1006
01:15:16,796 --> 01:15:19,822
Snap to Grenouille. A reverse!

1007
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:23,665
No, it's a double reverse!
Oh, what a block!

1008
01:15:23,736 --> 01:15:25,636
And Boudier springs free!

1009
01:15:25,705 --> 01:15:30,506
Trouble! Lateral!
Got him! What a play!

1010
01:15:30,577 --> 01:15:34,377
Grenouille to the 15!
To the 10! To the 5!

1011
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,813
- Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
- Well, well, well.

1012
01:15:36,883 --> 01:15:39,545
I guess Coach Klein does have
a few tricks up his sleeve after all.

1013
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:43,146
What the hell...
What the hell is this? Huh?

1014
01:15:43,223 --> 01:15:46,681
We go from a championship
football team to a bunch of dogs!

1015
01:15:46,759 --> 01:15:50,217
Right now, we're going to go down to
the sidelines and our man, Lynn Swann.

1016
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,491
Swannie, what do
you have for us?

1017
01:15:52,565 --> 01:15:54,499
I'm with Vicki Vallencourt,
who's taking over...

1018
01:15:54,567 --> 01:15:57,559
Bobby Boucher's water duties
for this important game.

1019
01:15:57,637 --> 01:16:00,697
Oh, I'm not takin' over.
I'm just tryin' not to screw up too bad.

1020
01:16:00,773 --> 01:16:04,140
Well, let me ask you this.
What's your prediction for
the rest of this ball game?

1021
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:06,269
Mud Dogs are gonna win,
30 to 27.

1022
01:16:06,346 --> 01:16:09,076
That's very interesting.
How'd you come up with that guess?

1023
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:12,584
Guess? That ain't no guess!
That's what it's gonna be.

1024
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:15,678
- Okay. That's fine.
- Oh! Be careful down there, Swannie.

1025
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:21,787
All right.
Meaney. Where's Meaney?

1026
01:16:21,861 --> 01:16:23,795
- Meaney?
- Here, Coach.

1027
01:16:23,863 --> 01:16:27,458
- Get in there and let's see if
that waterboy can stop you.
- Yes, sir!

1028
01:16:27,533 --> 01:16:31,799
Red is sending his best defender in
as a running back?

1029
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,396
What do you make of this, Dan?

1030
01:16:34,474 --> 01:16:36,772
Well, Brent, he's gotta find
some way to neutralize the waterboy.

1031
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:40,279
He probably thinks that Meaney
will just pound it in there like
Fridge used to do for the Bears.

1032
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:44,043
Hey, Waterboy! Is your girlfriend
gonna save you again?

1033
01:16:44,117 --> 01:16:46,312
Oh, no, sir. I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands.

1034
01:16:46,386 --> 01:16:50,482
- You'll see.
- Bridge the hole!
Your ass is mine! Whoo!

1035
01:16:50,556 --> 01:16:53,457
Whoo! Whoo!

1036
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,653
You sound like a...
a big choo-choo train.

1037
01:16:55,728 --> 01:16:59,220
Whoo!

1038
01:17:05,571 --> 01:17:09,029
Power bomb, compliments
of Captain Insano.

1039
01:17:15,848 --> 01:17:18,715
All right, field goal.
Field goal. Go.

1040
01:17:18,785 --> 01:17:22,186
- Derek. Derek!
- Yeah.

1041
01:17:22,255 --> 01:17:25,452
Visualize the attack.
Go kick the ball. Kick it.

1042
01:17:25,525 --> 01:17:27,356
Hut!

1043
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:31,022
How you doin', boy?

1044
01:17:31,097 --> 01:17:33,657
No, no, no!

1045
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:00,188
What the hell is that?

1046
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:09,794
Where the hell is... What the hell
is he up to? That ain't in here! Huh?

1047
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:11,734
Hey!

1048
01:18:11,804 --> 01:18:13,863
Down by ten late in the fourth quarter,

1049
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,534
Coach Klein
opts for the field goal.

1050
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:20,238
Then they have to hope for the onside
kick and a touchdown to tie the game.

1051
01:18:20,313 --> 01:18:24,579
Dan, look what we have here.
Boucher's in the game as a blocker.

1052
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:26,982
Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.

1053
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:32,147
Set!

1054
01:18:35,094 --> 01:18:37,085
The snap. It's a fake!

1055
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:44,069
Boucher's out in front!
A great block!

1056
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:47,504
And a second one!

1057
01:18:47,573 --> 01:18:50,098
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

1058
01:18:50,176 --> 01:18:53,703
- Boucher led him all the way!
- Yeah!

1059
01:18:56,082 --> 01:18:58,050
Red Beaulieu
is steaming, Dan.

1060
01:18:58,117 --> 01:19:00,517
Brent, he sees his
perfect season slipping away.

1061
01:19:00,586 --> 01:19:04,215
The Cougar's lead
is down to three.

1062
01:19:08,861 --> 01:19:12,194
The Mud Dogs need the ball back if
they're gonna have a shot at overtime.

1063
01:19:12,265 --> 01:19:15,894
And Bobby Boucher is
now on the kickoff team.

1064
01:19:15,968 --> 01:19:19,631
- Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.
- I know.

1065
01:19:19,705 --> 01:19:23,106
Who's it gonna be?

1066
01:19:23,176 --> 01:19:26,805
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?

1067
01:19:30,116 --> 01:19:33,210
Oh, yeah. There's my bitch.

1068
01:19:33,286 --> 01:19:35,811
Remember,
the ball must travel ten yards.

1069
01:19:38,324 --> 01:19:40,383
It's loose!

1070
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:43,554
- Mud Dogs football! Mud Dogs football!
- All right!

1071
01:19:43,629 --> 01:19:45,756
Mama, I got the football!
I got it...

1072
01:19:45,832 --> 01:19:48,494
Oh, what a vicious hit!
That was a cheap shot.

1073
01:19:48,568 --> 01:19:50,399
Oh!

1074
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:52,995
And what a dumb penalty.

1075
01:19:53,072 --> 01:19:56,405
That puts the Mud Dogs
in field goal range for the tie.

1076
01:19:56,476 --> 01:20:00,003
- Dan, I'm not sure that Boucher
is able to get back up.
- Oh, my baby!

1077
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:09,180
It's still cold.

1078
01:20:09,255 --> 01:20:12,291
Excuse me. Out of my way.

1079
01:20:15,661 --> 01:20:18,357
Dan, you hate
to see this happen.

1080
01:20:26,772 --> 01:20:29,764
Now, that's
high quality H2O.

1081
01:20:29,842 --> 01:20:33,869
- Come on, now!
Make it happen, Bobby!

1082
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:40,180
The waterboy
just needed some water.

1083
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:44,882
- Wow, Dan. You think that up
all by yourself?
- Shut up, Brent.

1084
01:20:48,127 --> 01:20:49,890
Are you okay?

1085
01:20:49,962 --> 01:20:52,157
He tried to open up a can
of whoop-ass on me. I wouldn't let him.

1086
01:20:52,231 --> 01:20:56,031
Listen, I have an idea for the last
play. You haven't done this before.

1087
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,035
All right? The offense
is gonna line up like this.

1088
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,037
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be right here.

1089
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,335
There'll be no tie here today.

1090
01:21:02,408 --> 01:21:06,071
Coach Klein is sending
his offense back on to the field.

1091
01:21:06,145 --> 01:21:08,272
He's going for
the win right now.

1092
01:21:08,347 --> 01:21:10,247
Yeah, this is
a real gutsy call, Brent.

1093
01:21:10,316 --> 01:21:12,307
He'll either be a hero
or a goat because of this.

1094
01:21:12,384 --> 01:21:17,048
And Dan,
Bobby Boucher is back on the field.

1095
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:21,081
He is now playing offense!
We know. We know.

1096
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:24,527
Meaney, if they give
that Waterboy the football,

1097
01:21:24,597 --> 01:21:26,531
I don't care if you
have to stab him!

1098
01:21:26,599 --> 01:21:28,897
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me?

1099
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:32,734
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir!
- Do you understand me? Get in there!

1100
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:35,171
Break!

1101
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,946
- I'm ready, friend.
- Let's do it, Bobby.

1102
01:21:47,052 --> 01:21:49,577
Set! Set!

1103
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:53,113
Forty-three! Set!
Forty-three! Hut, hut!

1104
01:23:10,436 --> 01:23:13,405
Touchdown! They win it!
The Mud Dogs win it!

1105
01:23:13,472 --> 01:23:17,772
Bobby Boucher's the hero! He's gone
from waterboy, Dan, to savior!

1106
01:23:17,843 --> 01:23:20,038
And it's because he didn't
hold anything back!

1107
01:23:20,112 --> 01:23:23,673
Well, Swannie's down on the field
with our hero, so let's go to Lynn now!

1108
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:30,612
We did it! I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!

1109
01:23:30,689 --> 01:23:33,681
- Vicki, I love you!
- Whoo! I love you too, baby.

1110
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:37,559
We're the champions!

1111
01:23:37,629 --> 01:23:41,565
Mr. Coach Klein, you got your manhood!
You got your manhood!

1112
01:23:41,633 --> 01:23:44,932
Bobby, congratulations.
You're the M.V.P. of the Bourbon Bowl.

1113
01:23:45,003 --> 01:23:46,937
How do you feel?

1114
01:23:47,005 --> 01:23:50,600
I love Mama!

1115
01:24:09,361 --> 01:24:11,454
Lookin' sharp, Bobby!

1116
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:13,464
You the man, Bobby!

1117
01:24:13,532 --> 01:24:16,228
Bobby, I've been dreading
this day for a long time.

1118
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,759
- But you got yourself a fine woman.
- Oh, thank you, Mama.

1119
01:24:19,838 --> 01:24:22,739
Good luck, son.

1120
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:24,776
This is the best day
of my life!

1121
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:28,406
You just wait till tonight.

1122
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,244
- What's gonna happen tonight?
- You'll see.

1123
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:36,652
You can do it!
You can do it all night long!

1124
01:24:40,092 --> 01:24:42,993
I'm gonna go do it!

1125
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,431
Bobby, it's me!

1126
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:55,098
- Your daddy, Roberto.
- Daddy?

1127
01:24:55,174 --> 01:25:00,111
I've seen you on the ESPN
when they was talkin' about
you being drafted by the NFL.

1128
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:03,876
Not going to the NFL.
I'm gonna stay in school and graduate.

1129
01:25:03,949 --> 01:25:07,851
The hell with school, dopey! Take the
money! You and me could be partners,

1130
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,447
- just like that Tiger Woods
and his daddy.

1131
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:14,014
Uh-oh.

1132
01:25:20,098 --> 01:25:23,226
- Nice hit, Mama.
- Thanks, baby.

1133
01:25:23,302 --> 01:25:25,668
Now, you go on and have
some fun becoming a man.
