1
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,020
- USS Kelvin, go for Starfleet base.
- Starfleet Base.

2
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:22,820
We sent you a transmission.
Did you receive it?

3
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,385
Kelvin, can you double-check those readings?

4
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,120
Our gravitational sensors are going crazy
here. You should see this.

5
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,620
It looks like a lightning storm.

6
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,320
What you've sent us doesn't seem possible.

7
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,520
Yes ma'am, I understand.
That's why we sent it.

8
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,620
- Report.
- Still out of visual range. 20 seconds.

9
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,020
Alert Captain Robau that Starfleet advised to
proceed with caution...

10
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,485
Polarize the view screen.

11
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,120
- Whatever this is... Klingon origin?
- Captain, we have visual.

12
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,320
- Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
- Negative, lieutenant.

13
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,320
You're 75000 kilometers
from the Klingon border.

14
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:51,620
Captain, are you seeing this?

15
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,620
My God.

16
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,120
I have a reading.
They've locked weapons on us!

17
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:19,220
Red alert!

18
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,920
Torpedo locked on us at 320°- 2!
Arm weapons!

19
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,320
Evasive pattern delta 5!

20
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,820
Incoming! Fast!

21
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,485
Fire all phasers!
Damage report.

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,320
Warp drive's been knocked out.
Never seen anything like it.

23
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,820
Weapons offline.
Main power at 38%.

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,120
- They're firing another!
- All power to forward shields!

25
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,820
Help me...

26
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,020
...maneuver has been lost.

27
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,085
Are shields even on?

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
...decks 17 and 13, we have
confirmed casualties.

29
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:09,720
11% and dropping. 10%.
Shields at 9% still dropping.

30
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
All remaining power to forward shields.

31
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,720
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

32
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,385
Hello.

33
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,020
My commander requests the presence of
your captain

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,620
in order to negotiate a ceasefire.

35
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,220
You will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft.
Your refusal would be unwise.

36
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,620
Walk with me.

37
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,820
If I don't report in 15 minutes
evacuate the crew.

38
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,720
- Sir, we could...
- There is no outpost out here.

39
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,520
Use autopilot and get off this ship.

40
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,020
Aye, Captain.

41
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,420
You're captain now, Mr. Kirk.

42
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,220
His heart rate is elevated.

43
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,820
Look at the ship.

44
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,920
- Are you familiar with this craft?
- Who is your commander?

45
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,020
- Is that him?
- I will speak for Captain Nero.

46
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,920
Then ask Captain Nero:
What gives him the right to attack a Federation vessel?

47
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,220
Do you know the location of
Ambassador Spock?

48
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,420
I'm unfamiliar with
Ambassador Spock.

49
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,020
- What is the current stardate?
- Stardate?

50
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,420
2233.04.

51
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,120
Where are you from?

52
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,720
Terminated.

53
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,620
- Sir, they have a lock on our signal.
- They're launching again.

54
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:43,320
Bravo 6 maneuver fire, full spread!

55
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,520
I'm initiating general order 13. We're evacuating!

56
00:06:57,555 --> 00:06:58,420
Yes sir.

57
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,320
All decks, this is the Captain speaking.
Evacuate the ship immediately.

58
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,585
Get to your designated shuttlecraft.
I repeat, begin evacuating...

59
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,220
- That's George's voice. What's happening?
- We'll deliver it in the shuttle. Go!

60
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,720
- George.
- You're OK, thank God.

61
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,020
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

62
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,620
- Yes.
- Everything's gonna be OK.

63
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,620
- Do exactly as I say, shuttle 37.
- George, it's coming.

64
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,820
- Our baby. It's coming now.
- I'm on my way.

65
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,920
Autopilot function has been destroyed.
Manual operation only.

66
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,820
Clear those decks now! Get to the shuttles!
Move! Move! Move!

67
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,020
- That was a big one!
- Just keep breathing. You'll be fine.

68
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,120
- And the baby too, right?
- And the baby too.

69
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,620
Right here.

70
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,385
Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife on board?

71
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,020
- Yes sir, she is.
- I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

72
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,920
- We're waiting on you sir.
- No, just go, take off immediately.

73
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,320
- That's an order.
- Yes sir.

74
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,220
Wait. We cannot go yet.

75
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,220
Please stop.

76
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,120
George, the shuttle's leaving. Where are you?

77
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,020
Sweetheart, listen to me.
I'm not gonna be there.

78
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
- No.
- This is the only way you'll survive.

79
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,620
Please don't stay on the ship. You have to be here.

80
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,920
The shuttles will never make it if I don't
fight them off.

81
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:52,820
George, I can't do this without you.

82
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,320
OK, I need you to push now!

83
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,820
SYSTEMS FAILING

84
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,520
COLLISION COURSE
ENGAGED

85
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,020
- What is it?
- It's a boy.

86
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:15,920
A boy?

87
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,120
- Tell me about him.
- He's beautiful.

88
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,320
George, you should be here.

89
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,220
Impact alert.

90
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,220
- What are we gonna call him?
- We can name him after your father.

91
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,620
Tiberius, you kiddin' me?
No, that's the worst.

92
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,320
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

93
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,120
Jim. OK. Jim it is.

94
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,920
- Sweetheart can you hear me?
- I can hear...

95
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,620
I love you so much.

96
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,320
I love you!

97
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:52,320
STAR TREK

98
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,020
Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.

99
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,320
You think you can get away with this
just because your mother's off planet.

100
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:28,620
You get your ass back home now! You live in my
house buddy. You live in my house and that's my car.

101
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,120
You get one scratch on that car
and I'm gonna whip your ass...

102
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,320
Hey Johnny!

103
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,920
Citizen, pull over.

104
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,820
Noooo...!

105
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,620
Is there a problem officer?

106
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,620
Citizen, what is your name?

107
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,020
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

108
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,620
- What is the formula for the volume of a sphere?
- 4/3 PI times the radius cubed...

109
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,020
1.26...

110
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,120
- What is the dimensionality...
- Dimensionality equals the logarithm of n divided by...

111
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,220
...non-excludability and non-rivalry...

112
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:05,220
...4/3 PI times the radius...

113
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,120
...is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

114
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,320
Spock.

115
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,220
I presume you've prepared new insults for today?

116
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,620
Affirmative.

117
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,720
This is your 35th attempt to illicit an emotional
response from me.

118
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,520
You're neither Human nor Vulcan and
therefore have no place in this universe.

119
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,720
Look, his Human eyes.
They look sad. Don't they.

120
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,020
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimulae.

121
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,120
He's a traitor you know? Your father.

122
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,920
For marrying her. That Human whore.

123
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,320
They called you a traitor.

124
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,420
Emotions run deep within our race.

125
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,985
In many ways more deeply than in humans.

126
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,820
Logic offers a serenity humans
seldom experience.

127
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,420
The control of feelings...
so that they do not control you.

128
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,020
You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan?

129
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,320
And yet you married a Human.

130
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,520
As ambassador to Earth it is my duty to
observe

131
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:52,420
and understand Human behavior.

132
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,320
Marrying your mother was... logical.

133
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,385
Spock.

134
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,320
You are fully capable of deciding
your own destiny.

135
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,820
The question you face is:
Which path will you choose?

136
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,420
This is something only you can decide.

137
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,720
Spock. Come here, let me see you.

138
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,220
- No.
- Spock.

139
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,220
There's no need to be anxious.
You'll do fine.

140
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,520
I am hardly anxious, mother.

141
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,920
And fine has variable definitions,
fine is unacceptable.
- OK.

142
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,720
- May I ask a personal query?
- Anything.

143
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,320
Should I choose to complete the Vulcan
discipline of Kolinahr.

144
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,120
and purge all emotion?

145
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,120
I trust you will not feel it reflects
judgment upon you.

146
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,120
Oh Spock.

147
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,920
As always, whatever you choose to be,
you will have a proud mother.

148
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,320
You have surpassed the expectations of
your instructors.

149
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,820
Your final record is flawless.
With one exception.

150
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,220
I see that you have applied to
Starfleet as well.

151
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,485
It was logical to cultivate multiple options.

152
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,220
Logical, but unnecessary. You are hereby
accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.

153
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,820
It is truly remarkable Spock that you have
achieved so much

154
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:57,120
despite your disadvantage.

155
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,820
All rise.

156
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,420
If you would clarify, minister? To what
disadvantage are you referring?

157
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,120
Your Human mother.

158
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,320
Council, ministers, I must decline.

159
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,020
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

160
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,370
But as I am half-human, your
record remains untarnished.

161
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:26,620
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honor the Vulcan way.

162
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,820
Why did you come before this
council today?

163
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,720
Was it to satisfy your emotional need
to rebel?

164
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,520
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

165
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,920
Thank you, ministers,
for your consideration.

166
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,620
Live long and prosper.

167
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,720
- Hi.
- Hey there.

168
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,920
Hi. I'd like a Clabmin fire tea...
3 Budweiser Classics,

169
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,320
2 Cardassian sunrises and...

170
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,920
- Try the Slusho, it's good.
- A Slusho mix, thank you.

171
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,820
That's a lot of drinks for a woman.

172
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,120
- And a shot of Jack, straight up.
- Make that two. Her shot's on me.

173
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,620
Her shot's on her.
Thanks, but no thanks.

174
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,820
Don't you at least wanna know my name
before you completely reject me?

175
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:37,220
I'm fine without it.

176
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,620
You are fine without it. It's Jim, Jim Kirk.

177
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,120
If you don't tell me your name,
I'm gonna have to make one up.

178
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,320
- It's Uhura.
- Uhura? No way.

179
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,620
That's the name I was gonna make
up for you.

180
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:54,320
- Uhura what?
- Just Uhura.

181
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,420
- They don't have last names in your world?
- Uhura is my last name.

182
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,320
Well then don't have... first names in your world?

183
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,620
- Excuse me buddy. - So, you're a cadet,
your studying. What's your focus?

184
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,220
Xenolinguistics.
You have no idea what that means.

185
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,720
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

186
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,620
Means you've got a talented tongue.

187
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,485
I'm impressed.

188
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
For a moment there, I thought you were just
a dumb hick

189
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,620
who only has sex with farm animals.

190
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:26,520
Well, not only.

191
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,620
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

192
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,620
Oh, beyond belief.
But it's nothing I can't handle.

193
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:34,720
You could handled me.
That's an invitation.

194
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,220
- Hey. You better mind your manners.
- Oh relax cupcake, it was a joke.

195
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,020
Hey farm boy, maybe you can't count.

196
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,985
There are 4 of us and 1 of you.

197
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,320
So get some more guys and then it'll
be an even fight.

198
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,720
Guys. Stop it.

199
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,520
Stop it!

200
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,120
Enough!

201
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,420
Guys, he's had enough.

202
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,720
Outside. All of you.

203
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,120
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,320
- What...
- I just bought a drink.

205
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,220
- You all right, son?
- You can whistle really loud, you know that?

206
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,220
You know I couldn't believe it when the
bartender told me who you are.

207
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,220
- Who the hell am I, Captain Pike?
- Your father's son.

208
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,420
Can I get another one?

209
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,985
For my dissertation I was assigned the USS Kelvin.

210
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,720
Something I admired about your dad, he didn't
believe in no-win scenarios.

211
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,720
- Sure learned his lesson.
- Well that depends on how you define winning.

212
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,520
You're here, aren't you?
- Thanks.

213
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,120
You know that instinct to leap without looking,
that was his nature too

214
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,420
and in my opinion it's something Starfleet's lost.

215
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:19,420
Why are you talking to me man?

216
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,420
Because I looked up your file while
you were drooling on the floor.

217
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,120
Your aptitude tests are off the charts, so
what is it?

218
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,120
You like being the only genius level
repeat-offender in the midwest?

219
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:31,620
Maybe I love it.

220
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,820
So your dad dies, you can saddle for
less than an ordinary life.

221
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,320
Or do you feel that you were meant for
something better? Something special?

222
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,520
- Enlist in Starfleet.
- Enlist?

223
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,720
You guys must be way down on your
recruiting quota for the month.

224
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:51,620
If you're half the man your father was
Jim,

225
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,620
Starfleet could use you.

226
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,520
You can be an officer in 4 years,
you can have your own ship in 8.

227
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,720
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important,

228
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,620
It's a peacekeeping and humanitarian
armada.

229
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,920
We done?

230
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:09,120
I'm done.

231
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,420
Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new
recruits leaves tomorrow - 0800.

232
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,920
Your father was captain of a starship
for 12 minutes.

233
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,720
He saved 800 lives, including your
mother's and yours.

234
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,520
I dare you to do better.

235
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,620
Nice ride man.

236
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,920
It's yours.

237
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,320
4 years? I'll do it in 3.

238
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,220
At ease gentlemen.

239
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,320
Never did get that first name.

240
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,085
- You need a doctor.
- I told you people,

241
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
I don't need a doctor,
damn it. I am a doctor.

242
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,720
- You need to get back to your seat.
- I had one, in the bathroom with no windows.

243
00:26:52,755 --> 00:26:56,020
I suffer from aviofobia. That means fear
of dying in something that flies.

244
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,920
Sir, for your own safety, sit down or
else I'll make you sit down!

245
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,820
- Fine.
- Thank you.

246
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
This is Captain Pike, we've been cleared
for takeoff.

247
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,720
I may throw up on you.

248
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,120
- I think these things are pretty safe.
- Don't pander to me kid.

249
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,620
One tiny crack in the hull and our blood
boils in 13 seconds.

250
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,220
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

251
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,520
And while you’re sitting pretty with a case
of Andorian shingles,

252
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,620
see if you're still so relaxed when your
eyeballs are bleeding.

253
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,820
Space is disease and danger, wrapped
in darkness and silence.

254
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,320
Well I hate to break this to you, but
Starfleet operates in space.

255
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,520
Yeah, well... I've got nowhere else to go, the ex
wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce.

256
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,520
All I've got left is my bones.

257
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,020
- Jim Kirk.
- McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

258
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,920
Three years later.

259
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,320
Captain Nero. You've been
requested on the bridge, sir.

260
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:44,920
Ayel says it's time.

261
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,720
Sir, we've arrived at the
coordinates we calculated.

262
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,220
There's nothing here. What
are your orders?

263
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,885
We wait.

264
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,120
We wait for the one who allowed
our home to be destroyed.

265
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,420
As we've been doing for 25 years.

266
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,120
- And once we've killed him?
- Kill him?

267
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm not gonna kill him.
I gonna make him watch.

268
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,320
Capture that ship.

269
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,720
Welcome back, Spock.

270
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,920
- Why are you so happy?
- I do not know what you're talking about.

271
00:29:37,955 --> 00:29:40,320
- No, I don't suppose you do.
- Hello ladies.

272
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,020
- I'm taking the test again.
- You've got to be kidding.

273
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:44,920
Yeah, tomorrow morning.
And I want you there.

274
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,220
You know I've got better things to do than
watch you embarrass yourself for the 3rd time.

275
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,685
I am a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

276
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,020
Bones, it doesn't bother you that no one’s
ever passed the test.

277
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,770
Jim, it's Kobayashi Maru.
No one passes the test.

278
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:57,420
And no one goes back for seconds,
let alone thirds.

279
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,820
I've gotta study.

280
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,120
Study, my ass.

281
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,720
Jim, I think I love you.

282
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,120
- That is so weird.
- Lights.

283
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,220
- Did you just say that is so weird.
- Yeah, I did, but I...

284
00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:17,020
You don't love me too?

285
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,420
- Oh, no, my roommate.
- I thought you said she was gone for the night.

286
00:30:19,455 --> 00:30:21,320
Obviously she's not. Quick, you've got...
just get under the bed.

287
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,820
- Under...? - Look, just get under
the bed. She can't see you here.

288
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,720
- Why not? - Because I promised her
I'd stop bringing guys back to the dorm.

289
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:29,820
- Well how... How many guys have you...?
- Just d... just down.

290
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,620
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

291
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:36,720
- Good. - Strangest thing...

292
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,520
I was in the long range sensor lab.

293
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:40,320
Yeah, I thought all night...

294
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,920
I was tracking solar systems and I picked
up an emergency transmission.

295
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,785
- Really?
- Yeah.

296
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,820
From a Klingon prison planet.

297
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,085
- No.
- Yeah.

298
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,820
A Klingon armada was destroyed,
47 ships.

299
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,620
So, you're not going back to the
lab tonight?

300
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,520
- Gaila, who is he?
- Who's who?

301
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,620
The mouth-breather hiding under
your bed.

302
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,220
- You could hear me breathing?
- You.

303
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,420
- Big day tomorrow.
- You're gonna fail.

304
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,085
- Gail, see you around.
- Get out.

305
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,520
- If I pass will you tell me your first name?
- No. Good night.

306
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,420
I think the fact that you picked up
a transmission is very interest...

307
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,120
We're receiving a distress signal from
the USS Kobayashi Maru.

308
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,385
The ship has lost power and is
stranded.

309
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
Starfleet command has ordered
us to rescue them.

310
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Starfleet command has ordered
us to rescue them... Captain.

311
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Two Klingon vessels have entered the neutral
zone and are locking weapons on us.

312
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,920
- That's OK.
- That's OK?

313
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,685
Yeah, don't worry about it.

314
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,020
- Did he say don't worry about it?
- Is he not taking the simulation seriously?

315
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,920
Three more Klingon war birds decloaking
and targeting our ship.

316
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,820
- I don't suppose this is a problem either?
- They're firing, Captain.

317
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,020
Alert medical bay to prepare to receive

318
00:31:52,055 --> 00:31:53,820
all crew members from the damaged ship

319
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,720
And how do you expect us to rescue them
when we're surrounded by Klingons, Captain?

320
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,120
Alert medical.

321
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,120
- Our ship is being hit. Shields at 60%.
- I understand.

322
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,720
Should we, I don't know, fire back?

323
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,520
- No.
- Of course not.

324
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,320
What is this? What's going on?

325
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,520
Hm. Arm photons. Prepare to fire
on the Klingon war birds.

326
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,820
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, their shields are still up.

327
00:32:28,855 --> 00:32:30,120
Are they?

328
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,720
- No, they're not.
- Fire on all enemy ships.

329
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,320
One photon each should do
let's not waste ammunition.

330
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,520
Target locked an acquired on all war birds.

331
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,220
Firing.

332
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,785
All ships destroyed, Captain.

333
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,085
Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

334
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,320
So, we've managed to eliminate all
enemy ships,

335
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,320
no one on board was injured,

336
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:59,920
and the successful rescue of the
Kobayashi Maru crew is under way.

337
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,920
How the hell did that kid beat your test?

338
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,120
I do not know.

339
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,420
This session has been called to resolve a
troubling matter.

340
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,120
James T. Kirk, step forward.

341
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,720
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted
to this council,

342
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,720
suggesting that you violated the
ethical code of conduct

343
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:29,120
pursuing to regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

344
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,520
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

345
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,120
Yes. I believe I have the right
to face my accuser directly?

346
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,620
Step forward please.

347
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,420
This is Commander Spock. He is one
of our most distinguished graduates.

348
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,320
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last 4 years.

349
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,620
Commander.

350
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,220
Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed to install
and activate a subroutine

351
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,120
in the programming code, thereby changing the
conditions of the test.

352
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,820
- Your point being?
- In academic vernacular - you cheated.

353
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,720
Let me ask you something I think we all
know the answer to.

354
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,520
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?
You programmed it to be unwinnable.

355
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,520
Your argument precludes the ability
of a no-win scenario?

356
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,785
I don't believe in no-win scenarios.

357
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,320
Then not only did you violate the rules, you
also failed to understand the principle lesson.

358
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,820
Please, enlighten me.

359
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,220
You of all people should know, cadet
Kirk, a captain cannot cheat death.

360
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,920
- I of all people?
- Your father,

361
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,820
Lt. George Kirk assumed command of his vessel
before being killed in action, did he not?

362
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,220
- I don't think you like the fact that I beat your test.
- Further more you have failed to define the purpose of the test

363
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,220
- Enlighten me again.
- The purpose to experience fear.

364
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,920
Fear in the face of certain death.
To accept that fear

365
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,520
and maintain control of oneself
and one's crew.

366
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,920
This is a quality expected in
every Starfleet captain.

367
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,420
Excuse me, sir.

368
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,220
We've received a distress
call from Vulcan.

369
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,520
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system,

370
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,120
I hereby order all cadets to report
to hangar 1 immediately.

371
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Dismissed.

372
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,420
- Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
- I do not know.

373
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,420
But I like him.

374
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,320
Bracer, USS Farragut.

375
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,720
McCoy, USS Enterprise.
McGrath, USS Walcott.

376
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,220
Spader, USS Hood.

377
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,020
Welcome to Starfleet.
Godspeed.

378
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
He didn't call my name.

379
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,720
Commander, sir, you didn't call
my name, Kirk, James T.

380
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,920
Kirk, you're on academic suspension,
that means you're grounded

381
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,120
until the academy board rules.

382
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,720
Jim, the board will rule in your favor.

383
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,720
Most likely.

384
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,720
Look Jim, I've gotta go.

385
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,820
Yeah. Yeah, go. Be safe.

386
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,820
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

387
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,020
Damn it.

388
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,985
Come with me.

389
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,520
Uhura, USS Farragut.
Petrovsky, USS Antares.

390
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,620
Go to your stations and good luck.

391
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,320
- Bones, where are we going?
- You'll see.

392
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,685
- Commander, a word?
- Yes, lieutenant?

393
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,020
- Was I not one of your top students?
- Indeed you were.

394
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,220
And did I not on multiple occasions
demonstrate an exceptional oral sensitivity

395
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,920
and I quote "an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies

396
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,820
in subspace transmission tests"?

397
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,320
Consistently, yes.

398
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,820
And while you were well aware that I'm qualified
and desire to serve on the USS Enterprise,

399
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:10,820
I'm assigned to the Farragut?

400
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,020
It was an attempt to avoid
the appearance of favoritism.

401
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,220
No. I'm assigned to the Enterprise.

402
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,420
- Yes, I believe you are.
- Thank you.

403
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,920
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing you a favor.

404
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,920
I couldn’t just leave you there
looking all pathetic. Take a seat.

405
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,820
Let me give you a vaccine
against viral infection

406
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,520
from the Lovaran mud fleas.

407
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,120
- What for?
- To give you the symptoms.

408
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,320
- What are you talking about? - You're
gonna start to lose vision in your left eye.

409
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,785
Yeah, I already have.

410
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,420
Oh, and you're gonna get a really bad
headache and flop sweat.

411
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,420
- You call this a favor?
- Yeah, you owe me one.

412
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,820
Kirk, James T. He is not cleared
for duty aboard the Enterprise.

413
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,820
Medical code states the treatment and
transport of a patient is to be determined

414
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,720
at the discretion of his attending physician.

415
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,585
Which is me. So I'm taking Mr. Kirk aboard.

416
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,120
Or you would you like to explain to
Captain Pike

417
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,320
why Enterprise warped into a crisis
without one of its senior medical officers?

418
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,820
- As you were.
- As you were. Come on.

419
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,620
I might throw up on you.

420
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,420
Jim, you've gotta look at this.

421
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,020
- Jim, look.
- What?

422
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,920
We need to get you changed.

423
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,120
I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking.

424
00:39:38,155 --> 00:39:40,220
Damn, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

425
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,320
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

426
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,720
- Engineering reports ready for launch.
- Thank you.

427
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,420
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship

428
00:40:06,455 --> 00:40:09,020
deserves more pomp than circumstance
we can afford today.

429
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,420
The christening will just have to
be our reward for a safe return.

430
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,220
Carry on.

431
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,920
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

432
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,285
Helm, thrusters.

433
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,720
Morrings retracted, Captain, dock
control reports ready.

434
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,420
Thrusters fired.
Separating from space dock.

435
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,720
The fleet's cleared space dock, Captain.
All ships ready for warp.

436
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,320
- Set course for Vulcan.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

437
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,920
Course laid in.

438
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,820
Maximum warp. Punch it.

439
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,020
- Lieutenant, where's helmsmen McKenna?
- He has lung worms sir.

440
00:41:04,055 --> 00:41:05,920
He couldn't report to his post.

441
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,120
- I'm Hikaru Sulu.
- And you are a pilot, right?

442
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,120
Very much so, sir. I'm a...
I'm not sure what's wrong here.

443
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,020
Is the parking brake on?

444
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,585
No.

445
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,585
I'll figure it out, I'm just...

446
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,820
Have you disengaged the external
inertial dampener?

447
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,220
- Ready for warp, sir.
- Let's punch it.

448
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,220
- Where are we?
- Medical bay.

449
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
- This isn't worth it.
- A little suffering's good for the soul.

450
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:40,320
Hi, how are you?

451
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,620
- My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?
- Well, those symptoms won't last long.

452
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,820
- I'm going to give you a mild sedative.
- Oh, I wish I didn't know you.

453
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:48,720
Don't be such an infant.

454
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,720
How long is it supposed to...

455
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,820
Unbelievable.

456
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,320
Engines at maximum warp Captain.

457
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,620
Russian whiz kid, what's your name?
Chenkov? Chirpov?

458
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,920
- Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andrejevic, sir.
- Fine.

459
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,720
Chekov, Pavel Andrejevic,
begin ship wide mission broadcast.

460
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,720
Yes, sir. Happy to.

461
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,220
Ensign authorization code
95 Wictor Wictor 2.

462
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,420
Authorization not recognized.

463
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,820
Ensign authorization code
95 Victor Victor 2.

464
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,385
Access granted.

465
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,920
May I have your attention please.

466
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,920
At 22:00, telemetry detected an anomaly
in the neutral zone.

467
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,620
What appeared to be a lightning
storm in space.

468
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,520
Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan high command

469
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:44,420
that their planet was experiencing
seismic activity.

470
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,320
Our mission is to assess the
condition of Vulcan

471
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,920
and assist in evacuations
if necessary.

472
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:57,120
We should be arriving at Vulcan within
3 minutes. Thank you for your time.

473
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,585
Lightning storm.

474
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,320
Aah Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

475
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,920
- Good God, man!
- What? Aah!

476
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,120
- What the hell's this?
- A reaction to the vaccine. Damn it.

477
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,920
Nurse Chapel, I need 50cc
of cortisone.

478
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,020
Yes, sir.

479
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,820
May I... Appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

480
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,385
We've gotta stop the ship.

481
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,920
Jim. I'm not kidding. You need
to keep your heart rate down.

482
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,920
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

483
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,570
I haven't seen a reaction this
severe since medical school.

484
00:43:32,605 --> 00:43:35,120
- We're flying into a trap!
- Damn it, Jim! Stand still.

485
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,320
Stop it!

486
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,185
- Uhura.
- Kirk. What are you doing here?

487
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,320
Transmission from the Klingon prison
planet, what exactly did it say?

488
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,520
- Oh my God, what's wrong with your hands?
- Who is responsible for the Klingon attack?

489
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,520
- Was the ship Romu...?
- Was the ship what?

490
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,120
- What's happening to my mouth?
- You got numb tongue?

491
00:44:00,155 --> 00:44:02,320
- Numb tongue?!
- I can fix that.

492
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,920
- Was the ship what?
- Romulan.

493
00:44:05,955 --> 00:44:07,320
- What?
- Romulan.

494
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
- Romulan? - Yeah.
- Yes. - Yeah!

495
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,020
Prod Nero seven Federation
ships are on their way.

496
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,670
- Jim!
- What's going on?

497
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:52,120
- Jim! Jim, come back.
- Captain!

498
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,085
Captain Pike, sir, we have to stop the ship.

499
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,520
Kirk, how the hell did you get
on board the Enterprise?

500
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,920
- Captain, this man is under the influence of a
severe reaction to a vaccine. - Bones, plea...

501
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,085
...He's completely delusional...

502
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,620
Vulcan is not a experiencing a natural disaster,
it's being attacked by Romulans.

503
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,020
Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've
had enough attention for one day

504
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,620
McCoy, take him back to medical.
We'll have words later.

505
00:45:10,655 --> 00:45:12,420
- Aye Captain.
- Sir, that same anomaly...

506
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,520
Mr. Kirk is not cleared to be
aboard this vessel, Captain...

507
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,920
Look, I get it, you're a great...

508
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,520
I'd love to do it again with you soon...

509
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,170
- I can remove the cadet...
- Try it!

510
00:45:19,205 --> 00:45:20,720
This cadet is trying to save the bridge!

511
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,720
By recommending a full stop mid-warp
doing a rescue mission?

512
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,520
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me. It's an attack.

513
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,720
Based on what facts?

514
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,220
That same anomaly,
a lightning storm in space

515
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,220
that we saw today, also occurred
on the day of my birth.

516
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,220
Before a Romulan ship attacked
the USS Kelvin.

517
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,385
You know that, sir.
I've read your dissertation.

518
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,920
That ship, which had formidable and
advanced weaponry

519
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,820
was never seen or heard from again.

520
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
The Kelvin attacked a place on
the edge of Klingon space.

521
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:48,520
And at 23:00 last night
there was an attack.

522
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,420
47 Klingon war birds destroyed
by Romulan, sir.

523
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,620
And it was reported that the Romulan
were in one ship, one massive ship.

524
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:58,120
And you know of this Klingon attack how?

525
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,820
Sir, I intercepted and translated
the message myself.

526
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,220
- Kirk's report is accurate.
- We're warping into a trap, sir.

527
00:46:07,255 --> 00:46:09,720
The Romulans are waiting for us.
I promise you that.

528
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,020
The cadet's logic is sound.

529
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,520
And Lt. Uhura's is unmatched in xenolinguistics.
We would be wise to accept her conclusion.

530
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,620
Scan Vulcan space. Check for
any transmissions in Romulan.

531
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,820
Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish the
Romulan language from Vulcan.

532
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,220
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, cadet?

533
00:46:26,255 --> 00:46:27,885
Uhura. All 3 dialects, sir.

534
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,020
- Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

535
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,620
Hannity, hail the USS Truman.

536
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,320
All the other ships are out of warp
sir and have arrived at Vulcan,

537
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:37,520
but we seem to have lost all contact.

538
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:42,120
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission
or transmission of any kind in the area.

539
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,620
It's because they're being attacked.

540
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,520
Shields up. Red alert.

541
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,220
Arrival at Vulcan
in 5 seconds.

542
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,620
4... 3.... 2...

543
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,220
- Emergency evasives.
- Running, sir.

544
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,820
- Damage report.
- Deflector shields are holding.

545
00:47:11,855 --> 00:47:14,020
All stations.
Engineering, Olson, report.

546
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,720
Full reverse. Come about starboard, 90°.

547
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,420
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

548
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,820
- Sir, there's another Federation ship.
- Destroy it too.

549
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,885
Fire torpedoes.

550
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,085
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

551
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,820
Divert auxiliary power from port
nacelle to forward shields.

552
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,985
- Sulu, status report.
- Shields at 32%.

553
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,320
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

554
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,085
- Get me Starfleet command.
- Captain.

555
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,920
The Romulan ship has lowered some
kind of high energy pulse device

556
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,185
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

557
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,020
It's signal appears to be blocking our
communications and transporter abilities.

558
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,320
All power to forward shields.
Prepare to fire all weapons.

559
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,220
Weapons ready.

560
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,620
Wait!

561
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,020
- The hull, magnify!
- Yes, sir.

562
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,420
Captain, we're being hailed.

563
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,020
Hello.

564
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,120
I am the Captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

565
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,420
Hi Christopher. I am Nero.

566
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,620
You've declared war against the Federation.
Withdraw

567
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,920
and I'll agree to arrange a conference with
Romulan leadership at a neutral location.

568
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:55,120
I do not speak for the Empire.
We stand apart.

569
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,120
As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?

570
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,720
Pardon me, I do not believe that
you and I are acquainted.

571
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,320
No, we're not.

572
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,020
Not yet.

573
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,520
Spock, there's something I
would like you to see.

574
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,120
Captain Pike, your transporter
has been disabled.

575
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,020
As you can see, by the rest of
the armada, you have no choice.

576
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,820
You will man a shuttle. Come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.

577
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,420
That is all.

578
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,120
- They’ll kill you, you know that.
- Your survival is unlikely.

579
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,670
Captain, we gain nothing
by diplomacy.

580
00:49:41,705 --> 00:49:43,120
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

581
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,220
- I too agree. You should rethink your strategy.
- I understand that.

582
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,320
I need officers who've been trained in
advanced hand to hand combat.

583
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,720
I have training, sir.

584
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,120
Come with me.

585
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,220
Kirk, you too. You're not supposed
to be here anyway.

586
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,120
- Chekov, you have the con.
- Aye, Captain.

587
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,920
Prepare the red matter.

588
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,920
Yes, sir.

589
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,570
Without transporters we can't beam off the ship.

590
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,620
We can't assist Vulcan.
We can't do our job.

591
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:13,620
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and engineer Olson
will space-jump from the shuttle.

592
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,820
You will land on that machine
they've lowered into the atmosphere

593
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,020
that's scrambling our gear. You'll get
inside, you'll disable it

594
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,685
then you'll beam back to the ship.

595
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,620
Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in
command of the Enterprise.

596
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,785
Once we have transport capability
and communication back up

597
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,420
you'll contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

598
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,820
And if all else fails, fall back

599
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,920
and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

600
00:51:34,955 --> 00:51:36,420
Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer.

601
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,685
- What?
- Captain?

602
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,920
Please, I apologize. The complexities
of Human pranks escape me.

603
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,085
It's not a prank, Spock.

604
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,820
And I am not the captain, you are.

605
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,220
Let's go.

606
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,420
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

607
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,820
I guess you have to come and get me.

608
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,320
Careful with the ship, Spock.
She's brand new.

609
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,170
- Dr. Puri, report.
- It's McCoy.

610
00:52:12,205 --> 00:52:14,720
Doctor Puri was on deck 6.
He's dead.

611
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,820
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

612
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,120
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

613
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,720
Shuttle 89, USS Enterprise, you are clear...

614
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,720
- You've got the charges, right?
- Oh yeah.

615
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,520
Can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.

616
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,320
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

617
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,420
So what kind of combat training do you have?

618
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,620
Fencing.

619
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,520
Pre-jump.

620
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,120
Shuttle commander, you are clear
from USS Enterprise...

621
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,720
Gentlemen, we're approaching the drop zone.

622
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,720
You have one shot
to land on that platform.

623
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,720
They may have defenses, so pull your chute
as late as possible.

624
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,520
3... 2... 1.

625
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,720
Remember, the Enterprise won't be able to
beam you back until you've turned off that drill.

626
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,220
Good luck.

627
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,020
Away team is entering the atmosphere, sir.

628
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,020
20,000 m.

629
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,785
Approaching the platform
at 5800 m.

630
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:36,520
Kirk to Enterprise.
Distance to target 5000 m.

631
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,420
4600 m from the platform.

632
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,720
4500 m to target.

633
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,220
4000 m.

634
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,820
3000 m.

635
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,220
2000 m.
Pull the chute.

636
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,120
- 2000 m.
- C'mon, pull your chute, Olson.

637
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,085
No, not yet. Not yet.

638
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,920
- 1500 m.
- Open the chute!

639
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,120
- Olson, pull your chute!
- 1000 m.

640
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,720
Olson!

641
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,020
Olson is gone, sir.

642
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,420
Kirk has landed, sir.

643
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,920
Gimme your hand.

644
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,220
Olson had the charges.

645
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,020
I know.

646
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,020
- What do we do?
- This.

647
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:23,620
The jamming signal's gone. Transport
abilities are reestablished.

648
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,820
Transporter control is reengaged sir.

649
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,920
Chekov, run all gravitational sensors. I wanna
know what they were doing to the planet.

650
00:58:28,955 --> 00:58:31,420
Aye, Commander. Captain. Sorry, Captain.

651
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,420
The drill's been sabotaged sir but
we have reached the planet's core.

652
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,820
Launch the red matter.

653
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:00,620
Kirk to Enterprise. They just launched something
at the planet through the hole they just drilled.

654
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,320
- Do you copy Enterprise?
- Yes, sir.

655
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,620
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

656
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,620
If my calculations are correct,
they're creating a singularity

657
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,520
...that will consume the planet.

658
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,620
They're creating a black hole
at the center of Vulcan?

659
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,420
Yes.

660
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,120
How long does the planet have?

661
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,720
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

662
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,420
Alert Vulcan command center to
signal a planet wide evacuation

663
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,720
all channels, all frequencies.
- Spock, Wait. - Maintain standard orbit.

664
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:34,620
Yes, sir.

665
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,585
Where are you going?

666
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,820
To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.
Their task with protecting our cultural history,

667
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,020
- My parents will be among them.
- Can't you beam them out?

668
00:59:41,055 --> 00:59:43,020
That is impossible. They will
be in the Katric Ark.

669
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,185
I must get them myself.

670
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:48,020
- Chekov, you have the con.
- Aye.

671
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,720
Kirk to Enterprise.
Beam us out of here.

672
00:59:53,755 --> 00:59:55,220
Stand by, locking on your signal.

673
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,320
- Retract the drill. Let's move out
- Yes, sir.

674
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,920
Fold it up.

675
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,220
I can't lock on to them. Don't move.
Don't move!

676
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,520
Kirk! Sulu!

677
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,520
Sulu!

678
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,920
Hold on!

679
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,920
I've gotcha!
Now pull my chute.

680
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,520
Kirk to Enterprise!
We're falling without a chute!

681
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,820
- Beam us up!
- I'm sorry I can't lock on to your signal.

682
01:00:38,855 --> 01:00:40,220
- Beam us up!
- You're moving too fast.

683
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,020
I can do that. I can do that!

684
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,485
- Take the con.
- Aye, sir.

685
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,220
The black hole's expanding. We won't reach
minimum safe distance if we don't leave immediately.

686
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,520
Move, move ,move ... I can do that.
I can do that. Move. Move...

687
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,920
Give me manual control, I can lock on.
Beam us up!

688
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,120
- Enterprise, where are you?
- Hold on. Hold on! Hold on!

689
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:08,520
Now! Now! Now! Do it now!
Now! Now! Now!

690
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:14,020
Hold on. Hold on. Compensating
gravitational pull. Aaand...

691
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,920
Gotcha!

692
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,020
- Thanks.
- No problem.

693
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,820
Clear the pad. I'm beaming to
the surface.

694
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,920
The surface of what?

695
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,220
What, you're going down there?
Are you nuts?

696
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,820
- Spock, you can't do that.
- Energize.

697
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,220
- Spock? - The planet has only
seconds left. We must evacuate.

698
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:30,220
Mother, now.

699
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:53,754
Spock to Enterprise.
Get us out now.

700
01:02:53,789 --> 01:02:56,589
Locking on to you. Don't move.
Stay right where you are.

701
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:07,689
Transport in 5... 4... 3... 2...

702
01:03:10,189 --> 01:03:13,489
- Mother!
- I'm losing her! I'm losing her!...

703
01:03:14,689 --> 01:03:16,489
I've lost her! I've lost her.

704
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:16,789
Acting Captain's log, stardate 2258.42.

705
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:20,989
We have had no word from Captain Pike.

706
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:26,089
I have therefore classified him a hostage
of the war criminal known as Nero

707
01:04:27,189 --> 01:04:31,789
Nero, who has destroyed my home planet
and most of its 6 billion inhabitants.

708
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:37,889
While the essence of our culture has been saved
in the elders who now reside upon this ship...

709
01:04:40,589 --> 01:04:43,589
I estimate no more than
10000 have survived.

710
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:50,389
I am now a member of
an endangered species.

711
01:05:17,689 --> 01:05:19,989
I'm sorry.

712
01:05:21,389 --> 01:05:25,989
I'm so sorry.

713
01:05:40,089 --> 01:05:44,089
What do you need.
Tell me. Tell me.

714
01:05:52,689 --> 01:05:54,789
I need everyone...

715
01:05:55,889 --> 01:06:10,789
- ... to continue performing admirably.
- OK.

716
01:06:25,889 --> 01:06:27,889
You must have a lot of questions for me.

717
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:30,989
I only have one for you.

718
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:36,589
I need the subspace frequencies of
Starfleet's border protection grids.

719
01:06:37,089 --> 01:06:39,789
Specifically those surrounding Earth.

720
01:06:41,489 --> 01:06:44,689
Christopher, answer my question.

721
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:47,989
No, you answer for the genocide you just
committed against a peaceful planet.

722
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:50,689
No, I prevented genocide.

723
01:06:53,689 --> 01:06:57,889
In my time, where I come from,
this is a simple mining vessel.

724
01:06:58,689 --> 01:07:01,889
I chose a life of honest labor.

725
01:07:01,989 --> 01:07:05,289
to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

726
01:07:05,889 --> 01:07:08,254
I was off planet doing my job

727
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:10,389
while your Federation did nothing.

728
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:13,789
And allowed my people to burn
while our planet broke in half.

729
01:07:14,389 --> 01:07:17,489
And Spock, he didn't help us.
He betrayed us.

730
01:07:17,589 --> 01:07:21,189
No, no... you're confused. You're misinformed.
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

731
01:07:21,289 --> 01:07:24,789
It's out there right now. You're blaming the
Federation for something that hasn't happened...

732
01:07:24,889 --> 01:07:28,089
It has happened! I watched it happen!
I saw it happen!

733
01:07:28,189 --> 01:07:29,789
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

734
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:38,689
And when I lost her.
I promised myself retribution.

735
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:43,089
And for 25 years I planned my
revenge against the Federation.

736
01:07:43,589 --> 01:07:47,089
And forgot what it was like to
live a normal life.

737
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:49,189
I did not forget the pain.

738
01:07:50,989 --> 01:07:54,489
It's a pain that every surviving
Vulcan now shares.

739
01:07:56,189 --> 01:07:58,189
My purpose, Christopher,

740
01:07:58,289 --> 01:08:02,089
is to not simply avoid the destruction
of the home that I love

741
01:08:03,689 --> 01:08:08,589
but to create a Romulus that
exists free of the Federation.

742
01:08:11,489 --> 01:08:14,689
You see only then will she be truly saved.

743
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:19,589
That is why I will destroy all the
remaining Federation planets.

744
01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:21,889
Starting with yours.

745
01:08:22,789 --> 01:08:25,289
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

746
01:08:29,489 --> 01:08:32,389
You will give me the frequencies to
disable Earth's defenses.

747
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:39,889
Centaurian slugs. They latch
on to your brain stem...

748
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:44,189
and release a toxin that will
force you to answer.

749
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:47,789
Frequencies please, sir.

750
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:50,789
Christopher Pike, captain of
the USS Enterprise...

751
01:08:50,824 --> 01:08:51,689
As you wish.

752
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:01,554
Have you confirmed that Nero
is heading for Earth?

753
01:09:01,589 --> 01:09:04,289
Their trajectory suggests no
other destination, Captain.

754
01:09:04,889 --> 01:09:06,089
Thank you, Lt.

755
01:09:06,389 --> 01:09:08,689
Earth may be his next stop, but
we have to assume

756
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:10,689
every Federation planet's a target

757
01:09:10,724 --> 01:09:12,189
Out of the chair.

758
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:16,389
Well, if the Federation is the target,
why didn't they destroy us?

759
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:19,389
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?
We obviously weren't a threat.

760
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:24,089
That is not it. He said he wanted me to see
something. The destruction of my home planet.

761
01:09:24,189 --> 01:09:26,054
How the hell did they do that, by the way?

762
01:09:26,089 --> 01:09:28,289
And where did the Romulans get
that kind of weaponry?

763
01:09:28,389 --> 01:09:31,989
The engineering comprehension necessary
to artificially create a black hole

764
01:09:32,089 --> 01:09:33,654
may suggest an answer.

765
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:36,089
Such technology could theoretically
be manipulated

766
01:09:36,189 --> 01:09:37,989
to create a tunnel through space-time.

767
01:09:38,389 --> 01:09:40,189
Damn it man, I am a doctor, not physicist.

768
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:42,454
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

769
01:09:42,489 --> 01:09:45,489
If you eliminate the impossible, what ever
remains, however improbable

770
01:09:45,589 --> 01:09:46,789
must be the truth.

771
01:09:46,889 --> 01:09:47,854
How poetic.

772
01:09:47,889 --> 01:09:51,489
Then what would an angry future
Romulan want with Captain Pike?

773
01:09:51,524 --> 01:09:54,089
As captain he does know details
of Starfleet's defenses.

774
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:55,789
What we need to do is catch
up to that ship,

775
01:09:55,889 --> 01:09:57,954
disable it, take it over and get Pike back.

776
01:09:57,989 --> 01:10:02,389
We are technologically outmatched in every
way. A rescue attempt would be illogical.

777
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:05,289
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake it.

778
01:10:05,389 --> 01:10:08,589
Then what about assigning engineering
crews to try and boost our warp yield?

779
01:10:08,689 --> 01:10:10,889
Remaining power and crew are being
used to repair radiation leaks

780
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:12,654
on the lower decks. The damage...

781
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:15,089
- OK. All right. All right. - ... communications.
Without it... - There's got to be some way.

782
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:18,289
- ... we cannot contact Starfleet. We
must gather with the rest of Starfleet.

783
01:10:18,324 --> 01:10:21,389
To balance the terms of the next engagement,
- There won't be a next engagement.

784
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:24,189
By the time we gathered it'll be too late.

785
01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:26,989
Look, you say he's from the future and
knows what's gonna happen

786
01:10:27,024 --> 01:10:29,389
then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.

787
01:10:29,489 --> 01:10:32,289
You're assuming that Nero knows
how event's are predicted to unfold.

788
01:10:32,889 --> 01:10:35,454
The contrary. Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history

789
01:10:35,489 --> 01:10:38,489
beginning with the attack on the USS Kelvin,
culminating with the events of today,

790
01:10:38,589 --> 01:10:43,689
thereby creating an entire new chain of incidents
that cannot be anticipated by either party.

791
01:10:43,789 --> 01:10:45,189
An alternate reality.

792
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:48,089
Precisely.

793
01:10:48,289 --> 01:10:49,939
Whatever our lives might have been

794
01:10:49,974 --> 01:10:51,589
if the time continuum was disrupted

795
01:10:52,689 --> 01:10:54,889
our destinies have changed.

796
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:57,489
Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system. Warp factor 3.

797
01:10:57,589 --> 01:10:58,889
Spock, don't do that.

798
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:03,389
Running back to the rest of the fleet for
a con fab is a massive waste of time...

799
01:11:03,489 --> 01:11:05,189
These orders were issued by
Captain Pike when he left.

800
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:06,854
He also ordered us to go back and get him.

801
01:11:06,889 --> 01:11:10,289
- Spock, you are captain now. You have...
- I am aware of my responsibilities...

802
01:11:10,389 --> 01:11:12,689
Every second we waste Nero's
getting closer to his next target.

803
01:11:12,789 --> 01:11:15,789
That is correct and why I'm instructing
you to accept the fact that I'm...

804
01:11:15,889 --> 01:11:19,789
I will not allow us to go backwards...
... instead of hunting Nero down.

805
01:11:19,889 --> 01:11:22,189
Security, escort him out.

806
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:32,689
- No.
- Jim!

807
01:11:37,889 --> 01:11:39,889
Get him off this ship.

808
01:11:59,989 --> 01:12:01,254
Computer, where am I?

809
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:04,689
Location: Delta Vega.
Class M planet. Unsafe.

810
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:08,589
There is a Starfleet outpost 14km
to the northwest.

811
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:12,089
- Remain in your pod...
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

812
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:58,289
Stardate 2258.42.

813
01:12:59,089 --> 01:13:02,489
...for... for... Whatever.

814
01:13:02,889 --> 01:13:06,389
Acting Captain Spock has
marooned me on Delta Vega.

815
01:13:06,589 --> 01:13:11,189
What I believe to be a violation
of security protocol 49.09

816
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:13,789
governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a starship.

817
01:15:24,289 --> 01:15:26,889
James T. Kirk.

818
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:30,389
- Excuse me?
- How did you find me?

819
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:34,789
How do you know my name?

820
01:15:35,789 --> 01:15:39,789
I have been and always shall be your friend.

821
01:15:43,389 --> 01:15:45,989
Look, I don't know you.

822
01:15:46,024 --> 01:15:48,689
I am Spock.

823
01:15:52,889 --> 01:15:54,289
Bullshit.

824
01:15:54,389 --> 01:15:56,889
It is remarkably pleasing to see
you again old friend.

825
01:15:57,689 --> 01:16:00,189
Especially after the events of today.

826
01:16:02,289 --> 01:16:04,254
Sir, I appreciate what you did for me today

827
01:16:04,289 --> 01:16:07,989
but if you were Spock, you'd know
we're not friends at all.

828
01:16:08,089 --> 01:16:10,489
You hate me. You marooned
me here for mutiny.

829
01:16:10,589 --> 01:16:12,554
- Mutiny?
- Yes.

830
01:16:12,589 --> 01:16:14,589
You are not the captain?

831
01:16:17,689 --> 01:16:21,589
No, no... You're the captain.

832
01:16:21,889 --> 01:16:24,189
Pike was taken hostage.

833
01:16:24,589 --> 01:16:26,589
By Nero?

834
01:16:31,689 --> 01:16:34,089
What do you know about him?

835
01:16:34,589 --> 01:16:37,389
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

836
01:16:38,589 --> 01:16:40,689
Please. Allow me.

837
01:16:41,489 --> 01:16:42,789
It will be easier.

838
01:16:43,089 --> 01:16:46,689
- Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
- Our minds, one and together.

839
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:55,089
129 years from now, a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

840
01:16:56,789 --> 01:16:59,589
That is where I'm from Jim.

841
01:16:59,689 --> 01:17:01,089
The future.

842
01:17:05,089 --> 01:17:07,489
A star went supernova.

843
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:11,689
Consuming everything in its path.

844
01:17:11,789 --> 01:17:15,089
I promised the Romulans that I
will save their planet.

845
01:17:20,589 --> 01:17:22,889
We outfitted our fastest ship.

846
01:17:23,989 --> 01:17:26,589
Using red matter I would create a black hole

847
01:17:26,689 --> 01:17:29,389
which would absorb the exploding star.

848
01:17:30,689 --> 01:17:33,689
I was on route when the unthinkable happened.

849
01:17:35,089 --> 01:17:38,689
The supernova destroyed Romulus.

850
01:17:43,989 --> 01:17:45,889
I had little time.

851
01:17:48,189 --> 01:17:52,089
I had to extract the red matter
and shoot it into the supernova.

852
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:11,389
As I began my return trip I was intercepted.

853
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:15,589
- He called himself Nero,
- ... collapse of Romulan Empire.

854
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:19,489
In my attempt to escape, both of
us were pulled into the black hole.

855
01:18:28,189 --> 01:18:31,689
Nero went through first.
He was the first to arrive.

856
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:42,189
Nero and his crew spent the next 25 years
awaiting my arrival.

857
01:18:42,289 --> 01:18:44,389
But what was years for Nero

858
01:18:45,989 --> 01:18:48,089
was only seconds for me.

859
01:18:48,989 --> 01:18:51,289
I went through the black hole.

860
01:18:53,289 --> 01:18:56,389
Nero was waiting for me.

861
01:19:01,489 --> 01:19:04,589
He held me responsible for the
loss of his world.

862
01:19:06,489 --> 01:19:09,089
He captured my vessel and spared my life.

863
01:19:10,189 --> 01:19:15,189
For one reason. So that
I would know his pain.

864
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:21,289
He beamed me here so that
I can observe his vengeance.

865
01:19:23,189 --> 01:19:26,189
As he was helpless to save his planet

866
01:19:26,289 --> 01:19:29,989
I would be helpless to save mine.

867
01:19:32,289 --> 01:19:36,589
Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.

868
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,589
Because I failed.

869
01:19:41,889 --> 01:19:45,989
Forgive me. Emotional transference
is an effect of the mind meld.

870
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:56,289
- So you do feel.
- Yes.

871
01:19:56,389 --> 01:19:59,189
Going back in time you changed all our lives.

872
01:20:00,189 --> 01:20:03,089
Jim, we must go.

873
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:05,889
There is a Starfleet outpost not far from here.

874
01:20:07,489 --> 01:20:09,089
Wait.

875
01:20:09,789 --> 01:20:11,989
Where you came from...

876
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:15,989
...did I know my father?

877
01:20:17,089 --> 01:20:18,489
Yes.

878
01:20:18,889 --> 01:20:22,189
You often spoke of him as being
your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

879
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:26,689
He proudly lived to see you become
captain of the Enterprise.

880
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:28,554
Captain?

881
01:20:28,589 --> 01:20:31,489
A ship we must return you to
as soon as possible.

882
01:20:40,189 --> 01:20:42,689
- Warp 3, sir.
- Course 151-3.

883
01:20:42,789 --> 01:20:44,989
- Laurentian system, sir.
- Thank you gentlemen.

884
01:20:45,489 --> 01:20:48,989
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Doctor.

885
01:20:50,289 --> 01:20:52,489
I am aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours.

886
01:20:52,589 --> 01:20:55,489
I recognize that supporting me
as you did must have been difficult.

887
01:20:55,524 --> 01:20:57,089
Is that a thank you?

888
01:20:57,489 --> 01:21:01,989
- I am simply acknowledging your difficulties.
- Permission to speak freely, sir.

889
01:21:03,389 --> 01:21:05,189
- I welcome it.
- Do you?

890
01:21:06,089 --> 01:21:08,989
Ok then. Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

891
01:21:09,689 --> 01:21:13,889
Are you making a logical choice sending
Kirk away? Probably. But the right one?

892
01:21:14,089 --> 01:21:17,089
Back home we've got a saying. If you're
gonna ride in the Kentucky derby

893
01:21:17,189 --> 01:21:19,354
you don't leave your prized stallion in the stable

894
01:21:19,389 --> 01:21:23,089
A curious metaphor, Doctor,
as a stallion it must first be broken

895
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:24,989
before it can reach its potential.

896
01:21:25,689 --> 01:21:27,889
My God man. You could at least
act like it was a hard decision.

897
01:21:27,989 --> 01:21:31,389
I intend to insist in the effort to reestablish
communication with Starfleet.

898
01:21:31,789 --> 01:21:35,589
However, if crew moral is better served
by my roaming the halls weeping

899
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:38,789
I would gladly defer to your medical expertise.

900
01:21:40,189 --> 01:21:41,689
Excuse me.

901
01:21:45,889 --> 01:21:47,889
Green blooded hobgoblin.

902
01:23:08,589 --> 01:23:10,089
What?

903
01:23:13,789 --> 01:23:15,889
You realize how unacceptable this is?

904
01:23:15,989 --> 01:23:17,254
- Fascinating.
- What?

905
01:23:17,289 --> 01:23:20,454
I am sure you're just doing your job, but
could you not come a wee bit sooner?

906
01:23:20,489 --> 01:23:25,189
Six months I've been here. Living off Starfleet
botty nips and a promise of a good meal.

907
01:23:25,389 --> 01:23:27,854
And I know exactly what's going on here.

908
01:23:27,889 --> 01:23:31,989
Ok? Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing. For
something that was clearly an accident.

909
01:23:32,089 --> 01:23:34,989
- You are Montgomery Scott.
- You know him?

910
01:23:35,089 --> 01:23:36,789
Yeah, it's me. You're in the right place.

911
01:23:37,089 --> 01:23:40,089
Unless there’s another hard working
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

912
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:42,389
- Me.
- Get it, shut up.

913
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:46,289
You aren't doing anything. You can
eat, like, a bean and you're done.

914
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,789
I'm talking about food, real food.

915
01:23:48,889 --> 01:23:51,489
But you're here now. So, thank you.
Where is it?

916
01:23:51,589 --> 01:23:55,589
You are in fact a Mr. Scott who postulated
the theory of transwarp beaming?

917
01:23:55,689 --> 01:23:58,789
That's what I'm talking about.
How'd ya think I wound up here?

918
01:23:59,189 --> 01:24:00,889
I had a little debate with my instructor

919
01:24:01,089 --> 01:24:04,589
on the issue of relativistic physics and
how it pertains to subspace travel.

920
01:24:04,689 --> 01:24:08,689
He seemed to think that the range of
transporting something like a grapefruit

921
01:24:08,789 --> 01:24:10,654
was limited to about a 100 miles.

922
01:24:10,689 --> 01:24:14,389
I told him that I could not only beam a
grapefruit from one planet to the adjacent planet

923
01:24:14,489 --> 01:24:17,089
in the same system, which is easy by the way

924
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:18,989
I could do it with a life form.

925
01:24:19,689 --> 01:24:22,089
So, I tested it on admiral Archer's prize beagle.

926
01:24:22,124 --> 01:24:23,689
I know that dog. What happened to it?

927
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:27,489
I'll tell you when it reappears. I don't
know. I do feel guilty about that.

928
01:24:27,589 --> 01:24:30,489
What if I told you that your transwarp theory was correct?

929
01:24:30,589 --> 01:24:33,789
That it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is travelling at warp speed?

930
01:24:33,889 --> 01:24:36,389
I think that if that equation had been
discovered I'd have heard about it.

931
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:38,489
The reason you haven't
heard of it, Mr. Scott,

932
01:24:38,524 --> 01:24:40,789
is because you haven't discovered it yet.

933
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:50,089
- Are you from the future?
- He is. I'm not.

934
01:24:50,189 --> 01:24:52,889
Well that's brilliant. Do they still
have sandwiches there?

935
01:24:53,889 --> 01:24:55,989
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.

936
01:24:56,389 --> 01:24:58,789
Shield emitters are totally bum jacked
as well as a few other things.

937
01:24:58,889 --> 01:25:00,289
In you go.

938
01:25:01,189 --> 01:25:03,289
So, the Enterprise has had it's
maiden voyage, has it?

939
01:25:03,324 --> 01:25:04,989
She is one well endowed lady.

940
01:25:05,089 --> 01:25:09,089
I'd like to get my hands on her ample nacelles,
if you'd pardon the engineering parlance.

941
01:25:11,389 --> 01:25:15,289
Except, the thing is, even if I believed you.
Where you're from, what I've done...

942
01:25:15,389 --> 01:25:19,689
Which I don't, by the way. We're still
talking about beaming aboard the Enterprise

943
01:25:19,789 --> 01:25:22,589
while she's travelling faster than light
without a proper receiving pad.

944
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:25,189
Get off there. It's not a climbing frame.

945
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:27,054
The notion of transwarp beaming

946
01:25:27,089 --> 01:25:30,389
is like trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet

947
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:33,389
whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse.

948
01:25:33,489 --> 01:25:34,454
What's that?

949
01:25:34,489 --> 01:25:37,689
Your equation for achieving transwarp beaming.

950
01:25:40,089 --> 01:25:41,889
You're out of it...

951
01:25:45,289 --> 01:25:49,189
Imagine that. It never occurred to me to
think of space as the thing that was moving

952
01:25:49,889 --> 01:25:51,889
You're coming with us, right?

953
01:25:53,789 --> 01:25:55,989
No, Jim. That is not my destiny.

954
01:25:56,789 --> 01:25:58,389
Your dest...

955
01:25:59,089 --> 01:26:01,589
He... The other Spock is not gonna believe me.
Only you can explain what the hell has happened.

956
01:26:01,624 --> 01:26:05,689
Under no circumstances can he be made aware
of my existence. You must promise me this.

957
01:26:05,789 --> 01:26:10,089
So you're telling me I can't tell you that I'm following
you're own orders. Why not? What happens?

958
01:26:10,289 --> 01:26:12,589
Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

959
01:26:12,689 --> 01:26:16,289
To stop Nero, you alone must
take command of your ship.

960
01:26:16,389 --> 01:26:18,189
How? Over your dead body?

961
01:26:18,224 --> 01:26:19,254
Preferably, not.

962
01:26:19,289 --> 01:26:22,189
However, there is Starfleet regulation 619.

963
01:26:22,489 --> 01:26:28,289
619 states that any command officer who is
emotionally compromised by the mission at hand

964
01:26:28,489 --> 01:26:31,089
must resign said command.

965
01:26:33,389 --> 01:26:37,189
So, you're saying that I have to
emotionally compromise you... guys?

966
01:26:37,289 --> 01:26:40,489
Jim, I just lost my planet.

967
01:26:41,589 --> 01:26:45,189
I can tell you, I am emotionally compromised.

968
01:26:45,589 --> 01:26:48,289
What you must do is get me to show it.

969
01:26:48,389 --> 01:26:51,089
Aye then laddie. Live or die.
Let's get this over with.

970
01:26:57,889 --> 01:26:59,989
You cannot come with me. Go on.

971
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:05,589
Coming back in time, changing history,
that's cheating.

972
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:10,789
A trick I learned from an old friend.

973
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:22,689
Live long and prosper.

974
01:27:41,989 --> 01:27:44,089
Mr. Scott?

975
01:27:48,589 --> 01:27:50,689
Mr. Scott, can you hear me?

976
01:27:58,389 --> 01:28:01,189
Hold on a second.

977
01:28:18,389 --> 01:28:19,589
No. No!

978
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:31,489
RELEASE VALVE.

979
01:28:38,789 --> 01:28:41,589
Turbine release valve, activated.

980
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,689
You all right? You all right?

981
01:28:52,689 --> 01:28:55,289
My head's buzzing and I'm soaked,
but otherwise I'm fine.

982
01:28:55,389 --> 01:29:00,689
Captain Spock, detecting unauthorized
access to water turbine control board

983
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:02,889
Bring up the video.

984
01:29:06,689 --> 01:29:10,189
Security, seal the engineering deck.
We have intruders in turbine section 3.

985
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:12,889
Set phasers to stun.

986
01:29:24,589 --> 01:29:26,089
Halt!

987
01:29:29,789 --> 01:29:31,089
Come with me

988
01:29:31,589 --> 01:29:33,589
cupcake!

989
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:41,889
Who are you?

990
01:29:42,089 --> 01:29:42,954
- I am with him.
- He's with me.

991
01:29:42,989 --> 01:29:46,189
We are travelling at warp speed. How
did you manage to beam aboard this ship?

992
01:29:46,289 --> 01:29:47,554
You're the genius, you figure it out.

993
01:29:47,589 --> 01:29:50,689
As acting captain of this vessel
I order you to answer the question.

994
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:52,989
Well I'm not telling, acting captain.

995
01:29:55,889 --> 01:30:00,089
What now? That doesn't frustrate you, does it? My
lack of cooperation, that doesn't make you angry?

996
01:30:00,189 --> 01:30:03,589
- Are you a member of Starfleet?
- Umm..yes. Can I get a towel?

997
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:06,089
Under penalty of court martial I order
you to explain to me how you were able

998
01:30:06,189 --> 01:30:08,389
to beam aboard the ship while moving at warp

999
01:30:08,789 --> 01:30:09,889
- Well.
- Don't answer him.

1000
01:30:09,924 --> 01:30:12,089
You will answer me.

1001
01:30:13,389 --> 01:30:16,189
- I'd rather not take sides.
- What is it with you, Spock?

1002
01:30:18,689 --> 01:30:23,689
Your planet was just destroyed, your
mother murdered, and you're not even upset.

1003
01:30:23,789 --> 01:30:26,189
If you are presuming that these
experiences in any way impede

1004
01:30:26,289 --> 01:30:28,389
my ability to command this ship
you are mistaken.

1005
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:31,989
And yet you were the one who said
fear was necessary for command.

1006
01:30:32,089 --> 01:30:35,289
I mean, did you his ship?
Did you see what he did?

1007
01:30:36,189 --> 01:30:38,289
- Yes, of course I did.
- So are you afraid or aren't you?

1008
01:30:38,389 --> 01:30:40,539
I will not allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

1009
01:30:40,574 --> 01:30:42,689
- Then why don't you stop me?
- Step away from me Mr. Kirk.

1010
01:30:42,789 --> 01:30:46,689
What is it like not to feel anger?
Or heartbreak?

1011
01:30:46,789 --> 01:30:50,089
Or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the
death of the woman who gave birth to you.

1012
01:30:50,189 --> 01:30:52,089
- Back away from me.
- You feel nothing!

1013
01:30:52,124 --> 01:30:54,589
It must not even compute for you.

1014
01:30:55,289 --> 01:30:56,989
You never loved her!

1015
01:31:21,389 --> 01:31:22,889
Spock.

1016
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:02,689
Doctor, I am no longer fit for duty.

1017
01:32:02,789 --> 01:32:07,489
I relinquish my command based on the fact
that I have been emotionally compromised.

1018
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:10,789
Please note the time and
date in the ship's log.

1019
01:32:37,889 --> 01:32:39,889
I like this ship.

1020
01:32:40,089 --> 01:32:41,689
You know it's exciting.

1021
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:47,889
Well congratulations, Jim. Now we've got
no captain and no goddamn first officer

1022
01:32:47,989 --> 01:32:49,389
to replace him.

1023
01:32:50,889 --> 01:32:52,554
Yeah we do.

1024
01:32:52,589 --> 01:32:54,989
- What?
- Pike made him first officer.

1025
01:32:55,489 --> 01:32:58,189
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Thanks for the support.

1026
01:33:01,389 --> 01:33:05,189
I sure hope you know what you're
doing, Captain.

1027
01:33:06,589 --> 01:33:08,489
So do I.

1028
01:33:12,789 --> 01:33:15,389
Attention, crew of the Enterprise,
this is James Kirk.

1029
01:33:16,789 --> 01:33:20,389
Mr. Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.

1030
01:33:21,589 --> 01:33:24,289
I know you're all expecting a regroup with the fleet,

1031
01:33:24,989 --> 01:33:27,154
but I'm ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.

1032
01:33:27,189 --> 01:33:29,889
I want all departments at battle
stations and ready in 10 minutes.

1033
01:33:30,989 --> 01:33:35,189
Either we're going down or they are.

1034
01:33:35,989 --> 01:33:37,289
Kirk out.

1035
01:33:44,989 --> 01:33:47,289
Speak your mind Spock.

1036
01:33:49,889 --> 01:33:51,854
That would be unwise.

1037
01:33:51,889 --> 01:33:55,689
What is necessary is never unwise.

1038
01:33:57,189 --> 01:34:00,289
I am as conflicted as I once was as a child.

1039
01:34:01,989 --> 01:34:04,789
You will always be a child of two worlds.

1040
01:34:06,689 --> 01:34:09,389
I am grateful for this.

1041
01:34:10,489 --> 01:34:12,489
And for you.

1042
01:34:13,989 --> 01:34:17,189
I feel anger for the one who took mother's life.

1043
01:34:18,489 --> 01:34:21,389
An anger I cannot control.

1044
01:34:24,989 --> 01:34:30,289
I believe, as she would say...

1045
01:34:31,289 --> 01:34:34,089
...do not try to.

1046
01:34:34,489 --> 01:34:38,989
You asked me once why I married your mother.

1047
01:34:43,289 --> 01:34:46,089
I married her because I loved her.

1048
01:34:53,889 --> 01:34:56,289
Whatever the case we need to
get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1049
01:34:56,324 --> 01:34:58,789
Just can't just go in there guns blazing, Jim.

1050
01:34:58,889 --> 01:35:00,654
I'm telling you to...

1051
01:35:00,689 --> 01:35:03,489
- Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk.
- Yes, Chekov. What is it?

1052
01:35:03,589 --> 01:35:05,389
Based on the Nerada’s course
from Vulcan

1053
01:35:05,489 --> 01:35:08,754
I have projected that Nero will
travel pass Saturn.

1054
01:35:08,789 --> 01:35:12,289
Like you said we need to stay
invisible to Nero or he'll destroy us.

1055
01:35:12,389 --> 01:35:14,889
If Mr. Scott can get us to warp factor 4

1056
01:35:14,989 --> 01:35:19,289
and if we drop out of warp behind one
of Saturn's moons, say Titan.

1057
01:35:19,389 --> 01:35:21,989
The magnetic distortion from
the planet's rings

1058
01:35:22,089 --> 01:35:24,454
will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

1059
01:35:24,489 --> 01:35:26,889
From there, as long as the drill
is not activated

1060
01:35:26,989 --> 01:35:28,589
we can beam aboard the enemy ship.

1061
01:35:28,624 --> 01:35:30,389
Aye, that might work.

1062
01:35:30,989 --> 01:35:33,389
- Wait a minute kid, how old are you?
- 17, sir.

1063
01:35:34,089 --> 01:35:35,389
Oh good, he's 17.

1064
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,054
Doctor.

1065
01:35:37,089 --> 01:35:40,589
Mr. Chekov is correct. I can
confirm his telemetry.

1066
01:35:40,989 --> 01:35:43,054
If Mr. Sulu is able to maneuver us into position

1067
01:35:43,089 --> 01:35:45,789
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device

1068
01:35:45,889 --> 01:35:48,289
and if possible bring back Captain Pike.

1069
01:35:48,689 --> 01:35:50,589
I won't allow you to do that Mr. Spock.

1070
01:35:51,389 --> 01:35:54,089
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

1071
01:35:54,589 --> 01:35:58,189
Our cultural similarities will make it easier
for me to access the ship's computer

1072
01:35:58,289 --> 01:35:59,589
to locate the device.

1073
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:05,189
Also my mother was human. Which
makes Earth the only home I have left.

1074
01:36:12,589 --> 01:36:14,489
I'm coming with you.

1075
01:36:14,789 --> 01:36:17,989
I would cite regulation, but
I know you will simply ignore it.

1076
01:36:20,689 --> 01:36:23,789
See? We are getting to know each other.

1077
01:36:39,089 --> 01:36:41,189
Prepare the drill.

1078
01:36:56,689 --> 01:37:02,489
All stop in 3... 2... 1.

1079
01:37:07,589 --> 01:37:10,489
Give me 1/4 impulse burst for 5 seconds.

1080
01:37:10,589 --> 01:37:12,489
I'll do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

1081
01:37:12,524 --> 01:37:13,489
Aye.

1082
01:37:14,189 --> 01:37:15,189
Fire.

1083
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:44,489
Transporter room. We are in
position above Titan.

1084
01:37:44,889 --> 01:37:47,589
Really? Fine job Mr. Sulu, well done.

1085
01:37:48,189 --> 01:37:51,389
- How are we Scotty?
- Unbelievably sir. The ship is in position.

1086
01:37:55,389 --> 01:37:59,289
Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you
think you have the tactical advantage

1087
01:37:59,389 --> 01:38:02,489
you fire on that ship even if we're still
on board. That's an order.

1088
01:38:04,989 --> 01:38:05,954
Yes, sir.

1089
01:38:05,989 --> 01:38:08,789
Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise
when we're ready to be beamed back.

1090
01:38:09,889 --> 01:38:11,989
Good luck.

1091
01:38:24,089 --> 01:38:26,989
- I will be back.
- You better be.

1092
01:38:28,389 --> 01:38:32,289
- I'll be monitoring your frequency.
- Thank you, Nyota.

1093
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:51,389
- So her first name's Nyota?
- I have no comment on the matter.

1094
01:38:51,489 --> 01:38:54,639
Oky doky then. If there’s any common
sense in the design of the enemy's ship

1095
01:38:54,674 --> 01:38:57,789
I should be putting you somewhere in the
cargo bay, shouldn't be a soul in sight.

1096
01:38:58,189 --> 01:38:59,289
Energize.

1097
01:39:42,689 --> 01:39:45,289
Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.

1098
01:39:45,389 --> 01:39:47,989
- One of them is Vulcan.
- No.

1099
01:39:52,489 --> 01:39:54,289
Ayel!

1100
01:40:08,189 --> 01:40:10,589
- I'll cover ya.
- Are you certain?

1101
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,089
Yeah, I've gotcha.

1102
01:40:31,789 --> 01:40:35,189
Do you know where it is?
The black hole device?

1103
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:39,089
And Captain Pike.

1104
01:41:01,189 --> 01:41:02,289
Move.

1105
01:41:03,189 --> 01:41:05,189
They have activated the drill.

1106
01:41:06,189 --> 01:41:07,789
Communication and transportation are inoperative.

1107
01:41:07,889 --> 01:41:09,389
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

1108
01:41:09,489 --> 01:41:11,089
Otherwise we won't be
able to beam them back.

1109
01:41:11,124 --> 01:41:12,989
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

1110
01:41:32,189 --> 01:41:35,789
I foresee a complication. The design of this ship
is far more advanced than I have anticipated.

1111
01:41:36,189 --> 01:41:38,989
Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.

1112
01:41:39,289 --> 01:41:41,389
Welcome back Ambassador Spock.

1113
01:41:41,489 --> 01:41:42,889
That's weird.

1114
01:41:44,289 --> 01:41:47,089
Computer, what is your manufacturing origin?

1115
01:41:47,289 --> 01:41:51,789
Stardate 2387. Commissioned by the
Vulcan Science Academy.

1116
01:41:54,789 --> 01:41:56,989
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

1117
01:41:57,089 --> 01:41:59,189
You'll be able to fly this thing, right?

1118
01:41:59,224 --> 01:42:00,989
Something tells me I already have.

1119
01:42:02,289 --> 01:42:04,089
- Good luck.
- Jim.

1120
01:42:05,189 --> 01:42:08,689
The statistical likelihood that our
plan will succeed is less than 4.3%.

1121
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:09,354
I will work.

1122
01:42:09,389 --> 01:42:11,589
In the event that I don't return
please tell Lt. Uhura...

1123
01:42:11,689 --> 01:42:13,589
Spock, it'll work.

1124
01:42:24,289 --> 01:42:25,689
Fascinating.

1125
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:36,889
Startup sequence initiated.

1126
01:43:20,689 --> 01:43:23,289
Nero, order your men to disable
the drill or I will...

1127
01:43:33,389 --> 01:43:36,389
I know your face from Earth's history.

1128
01:44:21,489 --> 01:44:23,989
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

1129
01:44:24,889 --> 01:44:28,789
He went on to captain the USS
Enterprise. But that was another life.

1130
01:44:29,689 --> 01:44:32,389
A life I will deprive you of just like
I did your father.

1131
01:45:05,389 --> 01:45:09,189
Captain Nero. The Vulcan ship's has been
taken. The drill has been destroyed.

1132
01:45:09,989 --> 01:45:14,289
Spock! Spock!

1133
01:45:32,089 --> 01:45:33,889
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir.

1134
01:45:35,189 --> 01:45:38,389
Spock, I knew I should have
killed you when I had the chance.

1135
01:45:38,489 --> 01:45:40,489
I hereby confiscate this illegally
obtained ship

1136
01:45:40,524 --> 01:45:42,489
and order you to surrender your
vessel. No terms.

1137
01:45:42,589 --> 01:45:44,054
That ship... take it out.

1138
01:45:44,089 --> 01:45:47,189
- Sir, if you ignite the red matter..
- I want the Spock dead now!

1139
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:04,689
- He went to warp.
- Go after him.

1140
01:46:04,724 --> 01:46:05,689
Yes, sir.

1141
01:46:36,089 --> 01:46:38,589
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

1142
01:46:42,589 --> 01:46:44,489
You can't even speak.

1143
01:46:46,689 --> 01:46:47,889
What?

1144
01:46:48,389 --> 01:46:50,689
I got your gun.

1145
01:47:16,689 --> 01:47:17,989
What's he doing?

1146
01:47:18,089 --> 01:47:21,089
Ambassador Spock, you are
on a collision course.

1147
01:47:21,489 --> 01:47:23,189
Fire everything!

1148
01:47:29,889 --> 01:47:33,989
Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit,
the red matter will be ignited.

1149
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:35,989
Understood.

1150
01:47:41,989 --> 01:47:43,489
Captain, I've picked up another ship.

1151
01:48:05,089 --> 01:48:07,589
- What are you doing here?
- Following orders.

1152
01:48:28,289 --> 01:48:30,189
Enterprise now!

1153
01:48:52,789 --> 01:48:54,489
Nice timing Scotty.

1154
01:48:55,389 --> 01:48:57,589
Haha! I've never beamed three people
from two targets

1155
01:48:57,689 --> 01:48:59,189
onto one pad before.

1156
01:48:59,489 --> 01:49:01,989
- Jim. - Bones.
- I've got him.

1157
01:49:05,189 --> 01:49:07,089
That was pretty good.

1158
01:49:07,689 --> 01:49:10,789
Captain, the enemy ship is loosing
power. They're shields are down.

1159
01:49:10,989 --> 01:49:12,889
- Hail them now.
- Aye.

1160
01:49:48,289 --> 01:49:50,989
This is Captain James T. Kirk
of the USS Enterprise.

1161
01:49:51,589 --> 01:49:54,189
Your ship is compromised. You're
too close to the singularity

1162
01:49:54,289 --> 01:49:57,289
to survive without assistance
which we are willing to provide.

1163
01:50:00,489 --> 01:50:02,289
Captain, what are you doing?

1164
01:50:02,389 --> 01:50:04,889
Showing them compassion may be the only way
to make peace with Romulus, Spock.

1165
01:50:04,924 --> 01:50:07,889
It's logical, Spock.
Thought you'd like that.

1166
01:50:08,389 --> 01:50:10,989
No, not really. Not this time.

1167
01:50:11,089 --> 01:50:15,289
I would rather suffer the end of
Romulus a thousand times,

1168
01:50:15,389 --> 01:50:19,789
I would rather die in agony than
accept assistance from you.

1169
01:50:19,889 --> 01:50:21,089
You got it.

1170
01:50:21,789 --> 01:50:24,089
Arm phasers. Fire everything we've got.

1171
01:50:24,124 --> 01:50:25,089
Yes, sir.

1172
01:51:09,989 --> 01:51:12,089
- Sulu, let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

1173
01:51:23,289 --> 01:51:25,589
- Why aren't we at warp?
- We are, sir.

1174
01:51:25,789 --> 01:51:27,989
Kirk to engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

1175
01:51:28,024 --> 01:51:29,989
You bet your ass Captain!

1176
01:51:33,089 --> 01:51:35,189
Captain, we're caught in
the gravity well. It's got us.

1177
01:51:35,224 --> 01:51:36,754
Go to maximum warp. Push it!

1178
01:51:36,789 --> 01:51:38,789
I'm giving it all she's got Captain.

1179
01:51:48,089 --> 01:51:50,589
All she's got isn't good enough.
What else you got?

1180
01:51:50,624 --> 01:51:52,889
Ok, if we eject the core and detonate

1181
01:51:52,989 --> 01:51:55,789
the blast could be enough to push us away.
I can't promise anything though.

1182
01:51:59,089 --> 01:52:00,989
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1183
01:52:01,689 --> 01:52:03,489
- Clear the area. Go!
- Yes, sir.

1184
01:53:31,089 --> 01:53:32,489
Father?

1185
01:53:41,089 --> 01:53:43,689
I am not our father.

1186
01:53:50,589 --> 01:53:55,189
There are so few Vulcans left we
cannot afford to ignore each other.

1187
01:53:58,289 --> 01:54:01,189
Then why did you send Kirk aboard when
you alone could have explained the truth?

1188
01:54:01,289 --> 01:54:03,254
Because you needed each other.

1189
01:54:03,289 --> 01:54:07,589
I could not deprive you of the revelation
of all that you can accomplish together.

1190
01:54:07,689 --> 01:54:10,889
Of a friendship that will define you both.

1191
01:54:11,089 --> 01:54:13,289
In ways you cannot yet realize.

1192
01:54:14,689 --> 01:54:17,189
How'd you persuade him to
keep your secret?

1193
01:54:17,289 --> 01:54:20,489
He inferred that universe
ending paradoxes would ensue

1194
01:54:20,589 --> 01:54:22,189
should he break his promise.

1195
01:54:22,224 --> 01:54:23,889
You lied?

1196
01:54:24,889 --> 01:54:27,989
- Oh. I implied.
- A gamble?

1197
01:54:28,089 --> 01:54:29,854
An act of faith.

1198
01:54:29,889 --> 01:54:33,389
One I hope you will repeat in
the future in Starfleet.

1199
01:54:33,589 --> 01:54:36,889
In the face of extinction it is only
logical I resign my Starfleet commission

1200
01:54:36,989 --> 01:54:38,054
and help rebuild our race.

1201
01:54:38,089 --> 01:54:40,689
And yet you can be in two places at once.

1202
01:54:41,689 --> 01:54:43,889
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1203
01:54:44,789 --> 01:54:48,489
I've already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1204
01:54:49,089 --> 01:54:52,989
Spock, in this case do yourself a favor

1205
01:54:54,389 --> 01:54:57,789
put aside logic, do what feels right.

1206
01:55:03,889 --> 01:55:07,089
Since my customary farewell
would appear oddly self serving

1207
01:55:07,389 --> 01:55:10,389
I shall simply say good luck.

1208
01:55:22,089 --> 01:55:25,489
This assembly calls Captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

1209
01:55:26,389 --> 01:55:29,589
Your inspirational valor and supreme
dedication to your comrades

1210
01:55:29,689 --> 01:55:31,989
is in keeping with the highest
traditions of service.

1211
01:55:32,789 --> 01:55:37,289
And reflect at most credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

1212
01:55:38,489 --> 01:55:41,589
It is my honor to award you
with this commendation.

1213
01:55:45,889 --> 01:55:50,589
By Starfleet order 28455, you are
hereby directed to report to Admiral Pike

1214
01:55:50,889 --> 01:55:54,489
USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

1215
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:04,289
I relieve you, sir.

1216
01:56:05,089 --> 01:56:07,089
I am relieved.

1217
01:56:08,789 --> 01:56:11,389
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Captain.

1218
01:56:13,189 --> 01:56:15,389
