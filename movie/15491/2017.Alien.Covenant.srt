我需要你快點起來，好嗎？ 我們要提前起來
I need you to get up. Ok? We're coming up early.

91
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,074
暫停緊急安全協議
Override the SSP

92
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,093
立刻離開休眠艙

93
00:09:30,044 --> 00:09:32,013
看著我，一切都會沒事的

94
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,016
唏，快起來，加油！

後退！

你看這個

I know, I know. I said I wouldn't go without you.

110
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,099

112
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,062
快給我上來
Now get your ass up here.

113
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:32,048
我沒辦法做任何承諾

114

我愛你
I love you.

115
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:50,056
他們現在是你的船員了
They're your crew now.

116
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:51,096
他們需要一個領導者
They need a leader.

117
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,026
是...
Uhmm...

118
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:56,009
你相信夢想的，是嗎？
You believe in dream, right?

119
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:21,046
抱歉我遲到了，長官
Sorry I'm late, sir.

120
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,088
沒關係
No it's okay.

121
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:30,021
我想不出任何其它方法去說甚至 我們...
I can't think of any other way to say it even.. to say are we...

122
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,059
正經歷了...一次歷史性的悲劇
We suffered a... A monumental tragedy.

123
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:39,034
我會盡我所能
And I'm gonna do the best that I can to

124
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:44,087
以雅各布為最好榜樣，做你們的好艦長
live up to Jacob, his, fine example as your captain.

125
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:49,009
但他，會被我們深深地懷念著

126
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:52,030
我提前感謝你的支持
And I'm grateful in advance for your support.

127
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,035
為此，我們失去了47名殖民者
So, we lost 47 colonists

128
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:59,054
和16名第二代胚胎
and 16 second generation embryos

129
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:02,045
還有，一個...一個重要船員
and, one, obviously one crew member.

130
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:07,029
目前艦船結構完整性保持在百分之83
The current structural integrity of the ship is holding at 83%

131
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:11,080
但是我們有一些次級系統癱瘓了
but we have many secondary systems that are offline.

132
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:13,062
所以為何會這樣？
So what was it?

133
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:16,073
附近恆星耀斑激發的高能衝擊波
A highly charge shock wave from nearby stellar ignition.

134
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:18,096
在我們展開能量帆板充電時
As the cells were deploying for recharge

135
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:20,070
令我們吸收了衝擊風暴的巨大擊波
we absorbed the full burn of the storm.

136
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,050
華特
And Walter

137
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,073
我希望你和母親進行一次完整的
I will want you and mother time to go a complete

138
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:25,026
核心指令檢查好讓我們明白
core code review so that we can understand

139
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:27,032
這件事的來龍去脈
how's those happened in the first place.

140
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:29,063
這是一次隨機偶發性的地區事件，長官
It was a random localized event, sir.

141
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,084
沒有辦法探測恆星耀斑的出現
There is no way to detect spontaneous stellar flares

142
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:34,025
可知道已太遲了
until it's too late.

143
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,068
只怪運氣不好吧
It was bad luck.

144
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,031
好吧，法拉斯，我不相信運氣
Alright, Faris, I don't believe in luck.

145
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,043
我對運氣這種事不感興趣
I'm not interested in luck.

146
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,008
我更希望提升我們的能力
I prefer that we be more capable

147
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:44,084
不指望運氣，而是靠充分的觀察、反應、信念
and prepared than lucky. Observation, reflection, faith

148
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,045
和決心
and determination.

149
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:49,058
這樣我們才有可能在事情發生前洞悉先機
In this way we may navigate the path as it unfolds before us.

150
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:50,079
是嗎？ 我們做到嗎？
Alright? We have what?

151
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:55,003
在我們抵達起源者6號行星前還有八次充能周期
Eight more recharge cycles to go before we get to Origae-6?

152
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,023
- 這會是問題嗎？ 長官     - 是的，華特，這的確是個問題
- Is that a question, sir?     - Yes, Walter, that's a question.

153
00:14:58,043 --> 00:14:59,043
沒錯
That is correct.

154
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:04,082
那麼...讓我們把飛船修複好吧
So...let's get this ship fixed.. Ok?

155
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:06,092
我們開始工作吧
Let's uh, let's get to work.

156
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:08,020
抱歉打擾一下
Sir, excuse me.

157
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,093
- 長官     - 怎麼了
- Sir.     - Yes?

158
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:14,063
我們才剛剛失去47名殖民者和我們的艦長
We just lost 47 colonists and our captain.

159
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,001
我們需要瞭解這一點
We need to acknowledge that.

160
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:17,096
我完全理解
I completely understand.

161
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:20,058
但是如果我們不進行修複
But if we don't make these repairs

162
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:23,076
我們會失去所有的殖民者
We will lose all the colonists.

163
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:25,097
是的，我們至少該為布蘭森艦長做點什麼
Yeah, we should do something for Captain Branson at least.

164
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:27,088
這不是一次討論，田納西
This is not a discussion. Tennessee.

165
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:37,087
地貌改造模塊目前穩定
The terraforming module is stable

166
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,058
但是連接枝柱有點損壞
but the connecting struts took some damage.

167
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,096
我還需要去檢查一下車輛
I still need to check the vehicles.

168
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:46,054
我能幫你
I can help

169
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:48,059
如果你願意的話
if you like.

170
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,019
謝謝
Thanks.

171
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:53,094
華特，離下次飛躍預計我們還剩多少時間？
Walter, How long do you predict before we can make our next jump?

172
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:56,086
修複大概需要48小時
Repairs should take approximately 48 hours.

173
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:00,054
但是我們應該儘量把這個區域清空
But we should make an effort to vacate the sector

174
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:01,090
以防往後再有耀斑
in case of after flares.

175
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:03,042
完全同意
Absolutely agreed.

176
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:06,001
讓我們開始工作吧，解散。 謝謝
So let's get to work ok? Dismissed. Thank you.

177
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:12,093
C-62打開
C-62 open.

178
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:16,020
鎖上C-62，打開17號氣閘
Seal C-62. Open Airlock 17.

179
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:25,077
打開通向地貌改造艙的艙門
Open door to terraforming bay.

180
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,060
該死
Fuck.

181
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:40,043
張力下降百分之15
Tensions are 15% down.

182
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:44,085
收緊
Arming.

183
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,052
穩住了
Secured.

184
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:52,075
收到
Copy that.

185
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:06,081
不是我的主意
Wasn't my idea.

186
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:13,097
傑克夢想著我們在新世界造一個小木屋
Jake have this dream of us building a cabin on the new world.

187
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,072
像拓荒者一樣
Like pioneers.

188
00:17:20,075 --> 00:17:22,014
湖邊的一間小木屋
A cabin on a lake.

189
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:29,011
起源者6號行星上的地貌改造區有一個湖
There is a lake in the terraforming zone on Origae-6.

190
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,051
我是指真木頭造的真實小木屋
I mean a real cabin made of real wood.

191
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:38,034
在艦船上倉庫內，有足夠的木頭來建一間木屋
So in the ship storage, there's enough wood to build a cabin.

192
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,094
斧頭、鋸子還有金屬釘子
Axes and saws and metal nails

193
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:45,061
這些東西我完全不知道怎麼用
I don't have a clue what to do with them.

194
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:51,053
這一切...
All this...

195
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:54,045
來構建我們的新生活
to start our new life.

196
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,027
現在我在想，為啥要這麼麻煩呢？
Now I wonder, why bother?

197
00:18:01,074 --> 00:18:05,080
因為你承諾在湖邊造一間木頭屋子
Because you promised to build a log cabin on a lake.

198
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:17,067
這是他的最愛
This was his favorite.

199
00:18:18,002 --> 00:18:20,040
有品位的人
A man of taste.

200
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,095
純正
Straight up.

201
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:24,060
不加冰，不加水，不要後輔酒
No ice, no water, no chaser.

202
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,087
什麼都不加
No shit.

203
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:32,053
華特
Walter?

204
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,077
入鄉隨俗吧
When in Rome

205
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,096
敬所有離開的好人們
To all the good people gone to soon.

206
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:41,050
願我們能銘記
May we remember that.

207
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,089
記住這一切
Remember that.

208
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:24,096
克尼斯
Chris.

209
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,052
他們違背了一個直接命令
They disobeyed a direct order.

210
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,058
她葬了她的丈夫
She buried her husband.

211
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:35,086
不，卡倫！ 不是這樣的，他們不相信我
No, Karine, it's not that. They don't trust me.

212
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,043
而且他們不信任我領導這個任務的原因
And they don't trust me for the same reason

213
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,037
和公司不信任我的原因一樣
the company didn't trust me to lead this mission.

214
00:19:39,037 --> 00:19:41,061
因為你不是個堅守信念的人
Because you can't be a person of faith.

215
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:44,076
也不能指望你做出符合理性的決定
And be counted on to make qualified rational decisions.

216
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:48,064
你是個極端主義者，你知道，你是個瘋子
You're an extremist. You know, you're a lunatic.

217
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:51,038
當我們到達我們要去的地方
When we get to where we're going

218
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:55,061
這些人不會是你的船員了，他們會是你的鄰居
This people won't be your crew anymore. They will be your neighbors.

219
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:57,011
請記住
Remember that.

220
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:00,055
友善對待，好嗎？
Tread softly, okay?

221
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:10,015
法拉斯，你能聽得見我嗎？
Faris, can you hear me?

222
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:11,045
可以
Copy.

223
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:12,083
開始吧
Let's do it.

224
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:18,003
該死，你們都應該來看看這個風景
Damn, y'all should see this view.

225
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:21,020
除非你把攝像環給修好，不然我們什麼也看不見
We can't see anything until you get the camera ring fixed.

226
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,093
親愛的，為什麼你不朝該死的窗外看看呢
Why don't you look out the damn window, hon?

227
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,029
安可，快啊，我們來恢覆電源吧
Ankor, come on, let's get this power back up,

228
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,088
這樣大家就能欣賞這個美麗的風景了
so these people can enjoy the beautiful view.

229
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:30,091
快好了
Almost there.

230
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:34,091
好的，安可，你就位了就跟我說一聲
Alright, Ankor, let me know when you're in a position.

231
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:36,065
我們就可以開始盡情搞事情了
We can get this party started.

232
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:38,036
我已就位
I'm in position.

233
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:09,029
已連接
Contact.

234
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:19,058
小田，一切順利嗎？
All good, Tee?

235
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:22,010
好的，我們這兒搞定了
Alright, we are clear.

236
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:23,042
把帆拉起來
Reel her in.

237
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:25,015
沒問題
Alright.

238
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:28,044
小田，連接好絞盤
Winch engaging, Tee.

239
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:31,068
正在把帆捲進來
Reeling her in.

240
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:36,062
搞定，輕而易舉
Working like a dream.

241
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:52,026
這就好
There we go.

242
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:53,061
系統恢復了
And we are back up.

243
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:54,094
小田，幹得漂亮
Well done Tee.

244
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,014
我們下麵的系統重生了
We're alive down here,

245
00:21:56,034 --> 00:21:57,044
快點
come on.

246
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:58,095
你們現在可別把我丟下就走了
Don't leave without me now.

247
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:01,069
長官，我可以申請把他丟下嗎？
Permission to leave without him, sir?

248
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,097
丹尼，歡迎回來
Welcome back, Danny.

249
00:22:03,094 --> 00:22:05,025
謝謝
Thanks.

250
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:07,035
好的，我的活也幹完了，小田
Alright, that's me done, Tee.

251
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:09,026
沒問題，我會跟著你回去的
Alright, I'm following you in.

252
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:12,024
請為勞苦的我們備上冰啤
Please have a cold beer ready for the weary traveler.

253
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:15,058
親愛的，沒問題，我會與你喝一轉
You got it, darling. I will draw circle.

254
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,022
法拉斯，法拉斯，搞什麼
Faris, Faris? Put it.

255
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:24,044
什麼……你們各位剛剛看到了嗎？
What the.. Did you guys just see that?

256
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:27,039
他剛說什麼？
What did he just say?

257
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:33,046
田納西，你聽到我說話嗎？
Tennessee, do you read me?

258
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:38,039
田納西，聽得到嗎？
Tennessee, can you read me?

259
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,093
田納西，你還好嗎？
Tennessee. You alright?

260
00:22:41,013 --> 00:22:43,010
那是他媽的什麼玩意？
What in the fuck was that?

261
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,049
不知道，我得進來了
I don't know. Coming in. I'm coming in.

262
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:01,095
大概是嚴重的傳輸損耗了吧
A rogue transmission loss, probably.

263
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:06,028
你的頭盔能收到是因你飄遠了
Your helmet must have picked it up because you were so far out.

264
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:08,083
已經超出了我們的通訊緩衝範圍
Past our communication buffers.

265
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:12,048
媽媽，內里有音頻信息嗎？
Is there audio, Mother?

266
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:15,093
正在整理，請稍等
Collating. A moment.

267
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:20,060
奧姆艦長，我重新調整了傳輸設備
I reoriented the transmission, Captain Oram.

268
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,084
應該只是回波，儀器損壞嚴重
Gotta be an echo, instruments took a lot of damage.

269
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:27,094
自從我們來這裡，每46秒就會重覆接收一次
Been happening every 46 seconds ever since we got here

270
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,092
這是約翰·丹佛的歌
That's fucking John Denver.

271
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:58,062
那首《鄉村小路  帶我回家》啊
That's "Take Me Home, Country Roads".

272
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,088
你一定是開玩笑
You gotta be kiddin.

273
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:02,024
不，我絕不會開約翰·丹佛的玩笑
No, I never kid about John Denver.

274
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,011
這兒還有定位數據
There is geometric data too.

275
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:08,077
媽媽，請幫我們追蹤一下訊號來源
Mother, please track the signal to its source.

276
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:10,057
正在追蹤
Working.

277
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:16,099
傳輸來源已確定
Source of transmission located.

278
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:22,001
訊號源於87區
Signal originates in the sector 87.

279
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:25,032
赤經47.6度
Right ascension 47.6

280
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:30,027
在我們當前位置下方24.3度
and a declination of 24.3 from our current location.

281
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:38,030
看起來像是跟我們星系很像的一個主序星
She appears to be a main sequence star lot like our own.

282
00:24:38,098 --> 00:24:41,000
但年代久遠，非常之久遠
But old, very old.

283
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
五顆行星
Five planets.

284
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,024
等等，你們看
Wait. Look at that.

285
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,019
第四號行星
Planet number four.

286
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:53,001
第四號行星位處宜居帶
The planet number four is square in a habitable zone.

287
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:55,056
事實上，在候補名單中它最合適
Prime candidate, in fact.

288
00:24:55,056 --> 00:25:00,040
地表重力有0.96G，有海洋和大陸
0.96 G's at surface, oceans, land mass.

289
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,076
極有可能存有活躍的生態圈
High likely hood of a living biosphere.

290
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,054
這比起源者6號所推測的更有希望啊
That's beyond the most optimistic projections of Oriage-6.

291
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:09,082
我們已經掃描過整個區域了，為何仍會漏掉這個星球呢？
How did we miss this? We scanned the entire sector.

292
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:11,099
里克斯，我們離那兒有多遠
Ricks, how far is it?

293
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:13,040
很近
She's close.

294
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:16,022
小飛躍的話，幾個星期就能到
Little jump. A few weeks.

295
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:18,079
我們都不需要再回去進入休眠狀態
Wouldn't even have to go back into hyper sleep.

296
00:25:23,025 --> 00:25:27,007
那我們去起源者6號需要多久
And how long is it gonna take to get to Origae-6?

297
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:29,006
七年，四個月
Seven years, four months.

298
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:32,011
這是個該死的睡眠周期
That's one hell of a sleep cycle.

299
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:36,070
長官，我負責地說，我們所有人
Sir, I think it's safe to say that none of us are too keen

300
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,002
都不想再回到那些休眠艙里了
on getting back to one of those pods.

301
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:45,057
也許我們該...走近點看看
Maybe we need to, um... Take a closer look.

302
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:49,096
有人反對嗎？
Any objections?

303
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:54,063
好的，里克斯，我們就
Okay, Ricks, let's..

304
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:57,071
試一試靠近看清楚吧
Let's try to course and take a closer look.

305
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,051
是，長官
Yes sir.

306
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:02,027
艦長，我有些話想跟你說
Captain, can I talk to you for a second?

307
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:08,096
你確定要這樣做嗎
Are you sure about this?

308
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:10,084
你想說什麼？
How do you mean?

309
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:14,095
我們找起源者6號就花了十年
We've spent a decade searching for Origae-6.

310
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:18,027
我們審查過它，做過模擬，繪過地形圖
We vetted it, we ran the simulations, we mapped the terrain.

311
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:20,005
- 這隻是我們的訓練內容     - 我明白
- It's what we trained for.     - I understand.

312
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:21,062
現在我們就這樣拋掉之前的一切
And now we're gonna scrap all that

313
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,075
為了追尋一個謎樣的訊號？
to chase a rogue transmission?

314
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:26,017
你好好想想
Think about it.

315
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,059
不可能有人類存在的地方出現了人類
A human being out there where there can't be any humans.

316
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:30,097
一個隱形的星球就突然展現眼前
A hidden planet that turns up out of nowhere

317
00:26:30,097 --> 00:26:35,015
還碰巧特別適合我們居住，這好得難以置信
And just happens to be perfect for us. It's too good to be true.

318
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:37,041
好得難以置信？  你這話是什麼意思？
Too good to be true? What do you mean by that?

319
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,097
我們不知道那個地方到底有什麼鬼東西
We don't know what the fuck's out there.

320
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,010
丹尼，也許我們只是漏掉了這星球而已
Maybe we just missed the planet, Danny.

321
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,022
這不值得我們去冒這麼大的風險
This is a monumental risk not worth taking.

322
00:26:44,022 --> 00:26:45,078
我並未作出任何決定
I'm not committing to anything.

323
00:26:45,078 --> 00:26:48,090
我只是儘力走好眼前的路而已
I'm simply trying to navigate the path as it unfolds before us.

324
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,029
這個星球有潛質成為
And this has the potential

325
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,099
理想適合居住的殖民地
to be a better habitat for a colony.

326
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:54,074
它有潛存，但我們真的不知道
It has the potential. We don't know that.

327
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:56,001
再說，全體成員里
By the way, this crew nobody.

328
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:58,072
沒有一個人會再想回到休眠艙了
Nobody wants to get back in the pods.

329
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,033
是吧
Right?

330
00:27:01,014 --> 00:27:03,063
傳輸過來的訊號是一個人類的聲音
And that was a human voice in that transmission,

331
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:06,042
我們有責任調查清楚
And it's our responsibility to investigate

332
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:10,063
我們的責任是保護宇宙飛船上的兩千名殖民者
It's our responsibility to protect the 2,000 colonists on this ship.

333
00:27:12,026 --> 00:27:13,026
唏
Hey.

334
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,085
我不是憑空做這個決定
I'm not free climbing here.

335
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:21,053
我需要線索，我會好好利用這線索
I need ropes, and I'm using ropes.

336
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:27,022
根據所有已得的數據，這會是個好判斷
This is good judgment, based on all the data available.

337
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:28,050
你明白嗎？
You understand?

338
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,098
作為你的二把手，我要提出正式抗議
As your second I need to protest. Officially.

339
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:34,065
正式抗議？
Officially?

340
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:41,032
好的，丹尼。 我會將它記錄在航行日誌里
Okay, Danny. I'll put it in the log.

341
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:44,085
你可以走了
You're dismissed.

342
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:12,073
我搜遍了所有頻道
I'm cycling through every channel

343
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:14,093
只收到很多干擾和白噪音
but we're getting a lot of interference and white noise.

344
00:28:15,012 --> 00:28:16,042
還有些高頻回聲
Some high frequency echos.

345
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,072
你聽到了什麼嗎？
Do you hear anything?

346
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:20,067
只有幽靈朋友們的連續訊號
Just the continuing signal from our friendly ghost.

347
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:23,002
帶我們進入它的軌道
Let's bring us in the closer orbit.

348
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:26,005
登陸船準備
And prepare the lander.

349
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:30,085
船體轉動中，啟動周邊位置護堰
Rolling progress, commencing circular location berm.

350
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:46,044
毒氣水平在可容忍範圍內
Tox levels, withing tolerances.

351
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:49,001
這個電離層好強
It's one hell of a strong ionosphere.

352
00:28:49,011 --> 00:28:50,030
是的，看得出來
Yeah, I see it.

353
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,064
你之前用過登陸船嗎？
Hey, you ever done lander drop before?

354
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:54,005
去你的
Fuck you.

355
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:56,060
法拉斯，熱電離層好像有場等離子風暴
Faris, looks like a plasma storm in the thermosphere.

356
00:28:56,062 --> 00:28:58,063
估計時速有250公里
We got something like 250 kph.

357
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:00,080
穿過去的話肯定夠受了
That's gonna be a motherfucker to fly through.

358
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,074
是，你說得對
Yes, I'm afraid so.

359
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,064
如風暴是電磁形會幹擾我們的通訊
Communication will be spotty if the storm is electromagnetic.

360
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:07,009
這樣登陸安全嗎？
It will be safe to land?

361
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:09,006
那看你說的安全是什麼了
Depends on what you call safe.

362
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:10,026
倒數二十秒
T minus Twenty seconds.

363
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,050
分離登陸船
So let her rip.

364
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,060
好的
Alright.

365
00:29:12,071 --> 00:29:15,031
準備軌道模式朝訊號位置進發
Preparing for orbital mode over signal position.

366
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:18,094
媽媽，請協調鎖定序列
Now, Mother, please coordinate lock sequence.

367
00:29:19,014 --> 00:29:20,045
收到
Understood.

368
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:22,069
現可安全發射登陸者一號
You're clear to launch Lander one.

369
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:24,066
好的，我們開始吧。 準備發射
Alright, here we go. Launching.

370
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:26,048
一起倒數，三
Together. Three.

371
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,068
二
Two.

372
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:28,078
一
One.

373
00:29:29,076 --> 00:29:31,031
登陸船已分離
Lander run released.

374
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,002
他們出發了
And away they go.

375
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:47,001
從這上面看真壯觀，法拉斯
Looking gorgeous from up here Faris.

376
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:49,041
好在是你在駕駛而不是田老頭
It's a good thing you're driving and not the old man.

377
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:52,034
喂，不要對老頭子刻薄，甜胸兒
Hey, little less to the old man, sweet tits.

378
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:53,091
喂，小心說話，小心說話
Hey, language, language.

379
00:29:53,094 --> 00:29:56,022
- 放尊重點，乾爹     - 我聽到你說的
- Be respectful there, sugerdad.     - I can hear you.

380
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:58,013
是她挑起來的
She started it.

381
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,016
如果你想的話，里克斯可以討論下你的胸部
Ricks can talk about your tits, if you want.

382
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:02,024
我們的感情可穩固了
Some's very secured in our relationship.

383
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:04,020
我老婆的胸我來管
I deal with my wife's tits.

384
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,051
伙計們，專心工作
Let's maintain focus.

385
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:11,038
下麵情況都還好嗎？
Everything looking good down there?

386
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:12,040
是，我們都還好
Yeah, we are good.

387
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:14,048
預計五分鐘內進入外大氣層
Expect to hit exosphere in five.

388
00:30:14,098 --> 00:30:17,084
你們要在後面坐穩了，接下來會顛簸不斷
You might wanna hold on back there. It's about to get rough.

389
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:21,010
我討厭太空
I hate space.

390
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:24,076
所以你才應該好好練瑜伽
This is why you need to do yoga.

391
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,071
- 堅持住，法拉斯     - 我可以的
- Hold it, Faris.     - I got it.

392
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:36,052
建議終止任務
Recommend the mission to abort.

393
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:39,072
法拉斯
Faris.

394
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:47,035
你能聯繫上她嗎？
Can you get her up?

395
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:49,020
通訊中斷了
We lost comm.

396
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,070
該死的
Oh shit.

397
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:55,031
三號及四號推進器故障
Failure in thrusters three and four.

398
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:56,098
- 你能行嗎？     - 我能行
- You got it?     - Yes.

399
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:59,053
別再問我能不能行了，我可以的
Stop asking if I've got it, I've got it.

400
00:31:02,084 --> 00:31:04,016
我們到了
Here it is.

401
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:06,043
糟了
Shit.

402
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:07,064
你們都還好嗎？
You guys alright?

403
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:09,026
不好
No.

404
00:31:11,064 --> 00:31:13,064
登陸傳感器啟動
Landing sensors engaged.

405
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,036
我不喜歡這地形
I don't like this terrain.

406
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,038
我們看到了平靜的水面
We got smooth water over there.

407
00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:35,044
- 我準備在水面降落     - 好的
- I'm gonna put us down amphib.     - Okay.

408
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:10,049
已著陸
Contact.

409
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:12,037
引擎熄火
Engines stopped.

410
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:15,057
我們停下了
We're down.

411
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,067
安全桿
Bars.

412
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:18,014
登陸者一號，能聽到我說話嗎？
Lander one, are you reading me?

413
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:20,089
收到，著陸過程不太順利
Roger that, that was one hell of a landing.

414
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,070
是啊，你那邊的聲音接收不太清晰
Yeah, we are having some trouble reading you.

415
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,058
有什麼法子能增強訊號嗎
Is there anyway you can try to boost the signal?

416
00:32:24,061 --> 00:32:27,048
我們在水上著陸的時候好像撞到了什麼
We may have hit something when we were down in water.

417
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:29,033
如果你聽得清我說的話，我得下去檢查一下
If you can hear me, I am gonna go, check up

418
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:32,086
看看船體有否損壞及檢查一下通訊線路
damage in the hull plates and then I will check the uplink.

419
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:35,076
好的，記得向我彙報結果。  完畢
Alright, let me know how it looks. Over.

420
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:38,062
大氣成分確認中
Confirming atmospheric composition.

421
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:39,066
拿好了，大塊頭
Here you go, big guy.

422
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:41,060
氧氣含量 19.5%
Oxygen, 19.5%.

423
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,000
安可
Ankor.

424
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,063
氮氣含量 79.4%
Nitrogen, 79.4%.

425
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,037
科爾
Cole.

426
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,038
羅西
Rosie.

427
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,085
大氣壓力，每平方英寸 15.4磅
Barometric Pressure 15.4 PSI.

428
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:50,046
萊沃德
Ledward.

429
00:32:58,025 --> 00:32:59,065
所有人就位
Everyone set?

430
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,050
我們走，大家伙兒出發吧
Let's go, let's move guys.

431
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:11,047
- 伙計們，快點     - 這空氣好清新
- Come on guys.     - The air feels good.

432
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,033
法拉斯，接收得到嗎？
Faris, if you got me?

433
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:17,067
- 收到了，很清楚     - 中士，確認安全
- Yeah, loud and clear.     - All clear Serg.

434
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:20,093
知道，我們得按遠征安全協議行事
Okay, we are gonna keep expedition's security protocols in place.

435
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:23,088
把艙門關好及鎖上，知道嗎？
Keep those doors locked and sealed. Okay?

436
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,088
好的，收到
Yeah. Copy.

437
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:26,007
請放心
Will do.

438
00:33:26,027 --> 00:33:27,067
你們玩得開心啊
Y'all have fun.

439
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:36,082
華特，我們還要走多遠？
Walter, how far do we have to go?

440
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:41,065
訊號源位於西邊8公里
The signal source is 8 km west

441
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,086
但是海拔相當高
but at considerable elevation.

442
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:46,029
洛普中士
Sergeant Lope.

443
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:48,009
把我們的幽靈找出來
Let's go find our ghost.

444
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:17,023
這地方蠻適合做一間小木屋的
Nice place for a log cabin.

445
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,020
傑克會喜歡的
Jake would have loved this.

446
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,083
唏，丹尼
Hey, Danny.

447
00:34:21,013 --> 00:34:22,072
這登陸地看似不差
It's not such a bad landing site after all.

448
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:25,029
我們可以在那裡建居住設施
We get the housing units right over there

449
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,042
民用設施可建在堤肩之後
Civic complex beyond the berm.

450
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:29,037
我們便能就近獲取水源
We've got access to fresh water.

451
00:34:29,058 --> 00:34:31,049
這裡適合我們建一個殖民站
We might have a spot for colony right here.

452
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,073
再看看吧
We'll see.

453
00:34:32,093 --> 00:34:37,022
噢，這女人一點信念也沒有
Oh, woman... yay of little faith.

454
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:40,083
真受不了他
He is insufferable.

455
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:43,014
當他高興時會更糟，對吧？
It's worse when he's happy, right?

456
00:34:47,094 --> 00:34:49,036
這是小麥
This is wheat.

457
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:52,061
相信我，我認識小麥
Believe me, I know wheat.

458
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:57,041
這些已經成熟了，但明顯是人工種植的
This is old, but definitely cultivated.

459
00:34:58,058 --> 00:35:02,027
離地球那麼遠，能找到人工植被的幾率有多大？
What are the odds of finding human vegetation this far from Earth?

460
00:35:02,037 --> 00:35:03,057
微乎其微
Very unlikely.

461
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:10,068
誰種的呢？
Who planted it?

462
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:38,023
吃吧
Eat.

463
00:35:38,037 --> 00:35:39,043
唏，寶貝，試試A頻道
Hey babe, try alpha.

464
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:41,081
好的，接到A頻道
Alright, Alpha's up.

465
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:46,058
沒用，再試試B頻道
Nothing, give beta a shot.

466
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:49,040
B頻道
Beta.

467
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,095
什麼也沒有
That's not doing shit.

468
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:53,068
為何沒法增強訊號？
How's there really no way to boost the signal?

469
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,054
既沒有斷線，再給電池充電吧
Not without going offline and recycling the cells.

470
00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:58,063
這樣要花多久時間？
How long is that gonna take?

471
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:01,015
不知道，幾個小時吧
I don't know. Few hours.

472
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:03,087
- 快跟上，別走失     - 大家要小心
- Keep up the pace. Take low.     - Careful guys.

473
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:05,007
克尼斯
Chris.

474
00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:06,017
等等
Hold up.

475
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:08,039
我想留在這兒
I think I want to stay here.

476
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:12,027
這應該是個研究完整生態系統的好地方
This might be a good place to start a full ecology workup.

477
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:14,038
你們回來時再把我接走，好嗎？
You could pick me up on the way back ok?

478
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,029
中士
Sergeant?

479
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,027
是..可以的，萊沃德，和卡倫待在一起
Yeah yeah that's right. Ledward, stay with Karine.

480
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,099
四小時後回這裡集合，保持你的通訊暢通
Meet back here in four hours. Keep your comm open.

481
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,021
在我妻子面前守點規矩
Behave yourself with my wife.

482
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,084
知道了，艦長
You got it, Captain.

483
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:26,016
過來
Come on.

484
00:36:44,073 --> 00:36:46,068
有什麼東西飛過這裡
Something passed over here.

485
00:36:48,037 --> 00:36:49,084
把樹冠都削掉
Cut the tops off the trees.

486
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:54,010
它一定很巨大
Well, it had to be huge.

487
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:56,078
好了，無論是什麼東西
Well, Whatever it is.

488
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:58,073
它就在那
It's up there.

489
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,048
你聽到了嗎？
You hear that?

490
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:06,068
什麼？
What?

491
00:37:07,046 --> 00:37:08,058
什麼也沒有
Nothing.

492
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:12,035
沒鳥兒，沒動物
No birds, no animals.

493
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:14,089
什麼也沒有
Nothing.

494
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:27,085
等等，慢點
Wait, slowly.

495
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:29,034
好的
Okay.

496
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,064
這樣就行了
This will do.

497
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:40,090
探險隊，能聽到嗎？
Expedition team, do we read us?

498
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:44,069
媽媽說離子風暴越來越嚴重了
Mother saying the ion storm is getting worse.

499
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:46,083
我們很快就沒法追蹤你們了
We're having a hell of time tracking you.

500
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,093
我們非常接近...目的地
We are getting very close... Target.

501
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,062
在我們到達前要保持頻道暢通，收到了嗎？
Stay awake when we get there ok? Copy that?

502
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:58,000
該死
Dammit.

503
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:04,009
P-3號
P three.

504
00:38:09,035 --> 00:38:10,083
我要去撒尿
I gotta take a leak.

505
00:38:12,063 --> 00:38:13,082
別太久
Don't be long.

506
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,077
萊沃德
Leward?

507
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:11,007
來了
Coming.

508
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,085
唏
Hey.

509
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:40,070
這是什麼鬼東西？
What the fuck is this?

510
00:39:42,097 --> 00:39:45,023
好像是某種飛行載具
It appears to be some kind of vehicle.

511
00:40:10,046 --> 00:40:13,008
安可、科爾，待在這
Ankor, Cole. Stay here.

512
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:15,062
- 知道     - 遵命
- You got it.     - Yes sir.

513
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:17,083
都小心點，不要踏空
Careful guys, watch your step.

514
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:33,033
艦長，這裡來
Captain. Over here.

515
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,097
- 我們鎖定了訊源位置嗎，華特？     - 這裡
- We got a lock on the transmission Walter?     - This way.

516
00:40:39,014 --> 00:40:41,031
我們走，跟緊點
Let's go. Stick together.

517
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:42,084
看見這個了嗎？
Seeing this shit?

518
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,079
湯姆
Tom.

519
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,093
快，跟上！
Come on, keep up.

520
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:02,036
好的，我來了
Alright, I'm coming.

521
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:12,035
你沒事吧
You okay?

522
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:14,021
是的、是的，我沒事
Yeah, yeah, I am fine.

523
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:38,009
天啊！
God!

524
00:41:39,053 --> 00:41:41,017
他們都是巨人
They were giants.

525
00:41:41,037 --> 00:41:44,093
至少是巨人的雕像
At least statues of giants.

526
00:41:49,044 --> 00:41:51,013
伊·肖博士
"Dr. E. Shaw".

527
00:41:51,061 --> 00:41:53,075
伊麗莎白·肖博士
Dr. Elizabeth Shaw.

528
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:59,019
她是普羅米修斯號的首席科學家
She was the chief science officer of the "Prometheus".

529
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,078
那艘船失蹤了
The ship that disappeared.

530
00:42:02,008 --> 00:42:05,003
確切地說，是10年前
Precisely, ten years ago.

531
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:08,018
維蘭德工業
Weyland Industries.

532
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:10,079
這不是維蘭德的船
This isn't a Weyland ship.

533
00:42:15,022 --> 00:42:17,001
肖博士
Dr. Shaw.

534
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:19,080
她怎麼會死在這裡？
How did she end up here?

535
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:25,040
- 洛普中士，能照下這裡嗎？     - 好的，長官
- Sergeant. Lope, can I get a light on this?     -  Yes sir.

536
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,089
- 過來     - 小心點     - 知道
- Over here     - Be careful. Ok?     - Yeah

537
00:42:31,056 --> 00:42:32,056
天啊
Jesus.

538
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,079
奧姆，奧姆你身後，看
Oram, Oram behind you, look.

539
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:04,092
我覺得我們找到訊號源了
I think we found our source.

540
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,021
她在這裡做什麼
What the hell was she doing out here?

541
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:17,026
可憐的家伙
Poor thing.

542
00:43:23,052 --> 00:43:24,084
我得坐一坐
I have to sit down.

543
00:43:25,014 --> 00:43:27,006
我得坐坐
I had to sit down.

544
00:43:27,054 --> 00:43:30,003
對不起，真的對不起
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

545
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:31,036
- 我不知道     - 我有什麼事
- I don't know     - what's wrong with me.

546
00:43:31,056 --> 00:43:33,088
看著我，看著我
Look at me, look at me.

547
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,031
我沒法呼吸了
I can't breathe.

548
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:39,084
保持冷靜
Stay calm.

549
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:42,084
我馬上就回來
I'll be right back.

550
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:47,037
奧姆艦長，請回答
Captain Oram. Come in.

551
00:43:48,057 --> 00:43:50,078
請回答，克尼斯，  我是卡倫，請回答
Come in. Hey Chris, It's Karine. Come in.

552
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,067
怎麼事，我在
What? Yes?

553
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:53,032
我遇到麻煩了
We have an issue.

554
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:56,089
我們正在回登陸船。  重覆，我們正在回登陸船
We're heading back to lander. I repeat, we are returning to the lander.

555
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:58,064
一切都還好嗎
Is everything okay?

556
00:43:58,065 --> 00:44:01,068
萊沃德生病了，我們正掉頭回去
Ledward is sick. We're heading back.

557
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:04,029
法拉斯，聽到了嗎？ 準備好醫務艙，可以嗎？
Faris, you get that? Prep the med bay okay?

558
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:05,088
好的，卡倫，發生了什麼事？
Will do, Karine, What's going on?

559
00:44:05,093 --> 00:44:08,007
照做就行了，我們馬上就回來
Please just do it. We'll be there soon.

560
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:09,062
我是丹尼斯
Daniels come in.

561
00:44:09,072 --> 00:44:11,041
我們掉頭回去
We are heading back.

562
00:44:14,028 --> 00:44:15,059
- 發生什麼了？     - 我不知道
- What's going on?     - I do not know.

563
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:17,049
好像是..萊沃德出事了
It's uh.. something about Ledward.

564
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:21,089
他們來了，我們走
They're coming. Let's move.

565
00:44:26,048 --> 00:44:27,086
- 伙計們     - 湯姆怎麼了？
- Guys!     - Tom!

566
00:44:28,018 --> 00:44:31,028
伙計們出什麼事？ 唏，你還好嗎？
What's going on man? Hey, You alright?

567
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:33,038
- 和我說話。 唏，看著我     - 安可，科爾
- Talk to me. Hey, Look at me.     - Ankor, Cole.

568
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:35,044
- 你沒事吧     - 是的，我沒事
- You alright?     - Yeah, I'm okay.

569
00:44:35,064 --> 00:44:37,054
- 你能走路嗎     - 可以
- Can you walk?     - Yeah.

570
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:40,001
好的，走吧。  讓我們離開這鬼地方
Okay, let's go. Let's get the fuck out of here.

571
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,051
好
Alright.

572
00:44:43,025 --> 00:44:46,009
寶貝，我們是在說隔離檢疫程序嗎？
Babe, are we talking quarantine protocols?

573
00:44:46,029 --> 00:44:50,005
我不...不知道，她說萊沃德在出血
I don't...I don't know, she said that Leward was bleeding

574
00:44:50,025 --> 00:44:51,097
讓我準備醫務艙
and to prepare the med bay.

575
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:55,052
是，我知。   這是我所理解
Yeah I know. That's what I thought

576
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:58,047
法拉斯，你的訊號收不到。 我們沒法聽到你，你能重覆嗎？
Faris, you're breaking up. We can't hear you. Can you repeat?

577
00:44:58,057 --> 00:45:01,028
我不知道怎麼回事，我也不知道有多嚴重
I don't know for the why. I don't know how serious it is.

578
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:03,046
只是看起來她很害怕
It just she sounded scared.

579
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:06,058
法拉斯，你在哪裡？  快來，我需要你的幫助
Faris, where are you? Come on, I need your help!

580
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,010
法拉斯，你在哪裡？
Faris, where are you?

581
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,017
我們在這，請回答
We are here. Come in!

582
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:15,026
- 萊沃德，支持住     - 我不能
- Ledward, come on.     - I can't.

583
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,065
我們就要到了，看見嗎？  就在前面
We are almost there. You see? Straight ahead.

584
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:21,062
法拉斯，快過來
Faris! Get over here!

585
00:45:21,073 --> 00:45:23,043
快點啊，我需要你的幫忙
Come on, I need your help!

586
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:35,089
趕快幫我！
Fucking help me!

587
00:45:38,057 --> 00:45:39,057
幫我！
Help me!

588
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:45,020
挺住，萊沃德
Stay up, Leward.

589
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:48,054
把他抬進醫務艙
Get him to the med bay

590
00:45:48,054 --> 00:45:50,005
經過時別碰任何東西
and touch nothing on your way through.

591
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:56,052
法拉斯，過來，快啊
Faris, get over here! Come on.

592
00:45:57,037 --> 00:45:58,043
扶住他
Got him.

593
00:45:58,063 --> 00:46:00,004
上去，上去
Up! Up!

594
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:02,002
萊沃德，你得挺住，來吧
Leward, you gotta stand up! Come on.

595
00:46:02,002 --> 00:46:03,028
奧姆，你在哪裡？
Oram, where are you?

596
00:46:03,048 --> 00:46:04,078
我們在回來的路上
We are on our way back.

597
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:05,098
還要多久
How long?

598
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:08,013
沒多久了。  法拉斯，我們快到了
It's not long now. Faris, we are almost there.

599
00:46:10,006 --> 00:46:11,045
不！ 挺住！
No! Stay up!

600
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:17,048
該死！ 該死！
Fuck! Fuck!

601
00:46:19,014 --> 00:46:20,031
躺在檯子上
On the table!

602
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:24,003
上去，上去！
Up, up!

603
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,072
拜托，萊沃德
Come on, Ledward.

604
00:46:25,088 --> 00:46:27,099
加油！ 幫幫忙
Come on! Help.

605
00:46:30,006 --> 00:46:33,012
卡倫，戴上手套，什麼也別碰！
Karine, put the gloves on. Don't touch anything!

606
00:46:33,013 --> 00:46:34,073
- 別再說了     - 法拉斯
- Stop saying that!     - Faris!

607
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,083
你已經和我說過了
You told me.

608
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:37,078
法拉斯，出什麼事了？
Faris, what going on?

609
00:46:46,062 --> 00:46:49,005
這裡待著，我去找奧姆
Just stay here. I'm gonna get Oram.

610
00:46:53,073 --> 00:46:54,073
已鎖定
LOCKED.

611
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:02,009
奧姆，我要你馬上回來
Oram, I need you back here right now.

612
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:05,012
我要你馬上回登陸船
I need you to get back to the Lander right now!

613
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:08,001
我明白，但我們已經盡可能快了
I understand that, but we are moving as fast as we can.

614
00:47:10,047 --> 00:47:13,056
多姆，起來。 我們快到了
Dom, get up man. We are almost there.

615
00:47:13,066 --> 00:47:16,031
我不知道羅伯特到底怎麼了
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with Robert!

616
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:20,011
他開始出血，他生病了，我不知道該怎麼辦
He started bleeding, he's sick, I don't know what to do.

617
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:22,078
冷靜，冷靜，親愛的。 告訴我發生了什麼
Just calm down. Calm down, sweetheart. Tell me what's happening.

618
00:47:22,078 --> 00:47:24,065
你別和我說什麼冷靜
You don't tell me to fucking calm down!

619
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:26,009
你沒看到我見到的場面
You didn't just see what I saw.

620
00:47:26,029 --> 00:47:30,073
我不知道萊沃德染上什麼病，也或卡倫和我也感染了
I do not know what the fuck Ledward got, or Karine's got or if I have it.

621
00:47:30,093 --> 00:47:32,057
- 小田     - 法拉斯
- Tee!     - Faris!

622
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:33,074
快回答
Come in!

623
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,071
法拉斯，你在哪裡？
Faris, where are you?

624
00:47:35,091 --> 00:47:37,053
我需要幫助！
I need help here!

625
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:41,049
你研究不知道這東西怎麼用，法拉斯？
Don't you know how to use this fucking thing Faris?

626
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:43,088
別吼了，再吼也沒用！
Stop the yelling, it doesn't help anything!

627
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:47,076
- 讓我出去     - 奧姆馬上到了
- Let me out.     - Oram's coming.

628
00:47:48,047 --> 00:47:50,034
- 快讓我出去     - 我們得等著
- Let me the fuck out!     - We're gonna wait.

629
00:47:50,044 --> 00:47:52,009
法拉斯，求你了。  快開門！
Faris, please. Open up!

630
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:55,053
我不能這麼做，我必須讓感染隔離
I can't do this. I need to keep the infection local.

631
00:48:10,014 --> 00:48:13,006
快把我放出去！ 趕快把我放出去！
Let me fuck out! Let me the fuck out!

632
00:48:16,008 --> 00:48:17,008
法拉斯
Faris!

633
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:19,070
開門啊，法拉斯
Fucking open Faris.

634
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:22,098
把門打開！
Open the door!

635
00:48:25,095 --> 00:48:27,068
讓我出去！
Let me the fuck out!

636
00:48:32,003 --> 00:48:34,099
讓我出去！ 法拉斯，你這混蛋！
Let me out! Faris, you fuck!

637
00:48:55,073 --> 00:48:57,003
法拉斯！
Faris!

638
00:48:58,007 --> 00:48:59,022
我來了
I'm coming!

639
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:01,073
上帝啊
Oh my God.

640
00:49:02,011 --> 00:49:04,004
請趕快，有東西上船了
Please hurry, there's something on board. Please.

641
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:06,031
法拉斯，再說一遍，訊號收不到
Faris, go again, You're breaking up.

642
00:49:06,055 --> 00:49:08,093
登陸者一號請重覆，我聽不到
Lander One repeat. I can't.

643
00:49:09,024 --> 00:49:13,021
登陸者一號，重覆！ 登陸者一號，重覆！
Lander One, Repeat! Lander One, Repeat!

644
00:49:16,075 --> 00:49:18,022
給我滾遠點！
Stay the fuck away!

645
00:49:32,043 --> 00:49:34,062
不！ 卡倫！
No! Karine!

646
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:35,042
混蛋！
Fuck it!

647
00:50:44,032 --> 00:50:45,085
- 噢，天啊！     - 卡倫！ 堅持住！
- Oh my God!     - Karine! Hold on!

648
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,003
艦長！ 趴下！
Captain! Get Down!

649
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:54,060
不！    不！
No!     No!

650
00:51:07,056 --> 00:51:09,020
- 按住他     - 和我說話
- Hold him!     - Talk to me!

651
00:51:15,086 --> 00:51:17,000
噢，天啊！
Oh my God!

652
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:24,007
別起來
Stay down.

653
00:51:31,073 --> 00:51:32,073
幫我！ 按住他！
Help me! Hold him!

654
00:52:04,074 --> 00:52:08,043
這是場7.5級的離子風暴，我們能和他們通訊那麼久碓是奇跡
It's a 7.5 ion storm, it's a miracle that we could talk to them for as long as we could.

655
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:11,011
那麼我們就穿過它
Well then we fly it through it.

656
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:12,078
我們不能這麼做，田納西
We can not do that, Tennessee.

657
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:14,067
你是飛行員，你知道極限到那裡
You're a pilot, you know what the tolerances are.

658
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:16,054
管什麼極限
Fuck the tolerances.

659
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:17,065
小田
Tee.

660
00:52:17,075 --> 00:52:20,039
在這該死的風暴下，會令我們墜毀的
It's a goddamn hurricane down there, we would break up.

661
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:23,050
我們只能等它結束
We just have to wait it out.

662
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,069
對不起，小田
I'm sorry, Tee.

663
00:52:27,004 --> 00:52:28,057
她嚇壞了
She was scared.

664
00:52:29,007 --> 00:52:31,075
我沒見過我老婆害怕成這個樣子的
Never heard my wife scared before.

665
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:34,082
回答，回答
Come in. Come in.

666
00:52:36,006 --> 00:52:38,083
契約號，聽到嗎？
Covenant. Do you read me?

667
00:52:39,046 --> 00:52:40,076
契約號

668
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,092
契約號，聽到嗎？
Covenant. Do you read me?

669
00:52:45,092 --> 00:52:46,093
契約號，請回答
Covenant, come in.

670
00:52:47,008 --> 00:52:48,027
我會永遠陪著你
I will always be with you.

671
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:50,079
我生命的曙光
Light of my life.

672
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,041
契約號，聽到了嗎？
Covenant. Do you read me?

673
00:52:52,061 --> 00:52:54,034
我的愛人，我的天使
My love, my angel.

674
00:52:54,054 --> 00:52:57,035
洛普，你無能為力了
Lope, there is nothing you can do.

675
00:52:59,034 --> 00:53:01,008
什麼也做不了，明白嗎？
There is nothing, okay?

676
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:03,081
契約號，聽到嗎？
Covenant, do you read me?

677
00:53:07,095 --> 00:53:09,099
- 田納西，回答，你死到哪裡了！     - 丹尼斯
- Tennessee, come in, for fuck's sake!      - Daniels!

678
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:16,009
小心，快、快、快
Look out! Move move move.

679
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:25,019
- 開火！     - 開槍！快
- Fire! -     Shoot! Go.

680
00:53:26,031 --> 00:53:27,048
丹尼斯，趴下
Daniels, get down!

681
00:53:33,038 --> 00:53:34,038
安可，不！
Ankor, no!

682
00:53:36,085 --> 00:53:37,085
開火，科爾
Go, Cole!

683
00:53:40,024 --> 00:53:41,045
我搞定了
I got it.

684
00:53:41,063 --> 00:53:43,044
- 丹尼斯，你還好吧？     - 是的！
- Daniels, are you okay?     - Yeah!

685
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,007
那是什麼鬼東西？
What the fuck was that?

686
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,070
大家沒事吧？
Is everyone okay?

687
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,041
還有一隻，快讓開！
There is another one! Get out of the way!

688
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:50,042
在你後面！
Behind you!

689
00:53:54,006 --> 00:53:55,029
把它弄掉！
Get it off!

690
00:53:56,037 --> 00:53:57,067
我沒法瞄準
Can't get a clean shot.

691
00:53:57,081 --> 00:53:59,003
滾開！
Get out!

692
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,056
跟我走
Follow me.

693
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:32,031
我去找艦長
I'll get the captain.

694
00:54:33,094 --> 00:54:35,008
唏，嗨
Hey, hey.

695
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:36,029
艦長！
Captain!

696
00:54:39,003 --> 00:54:41,022
克尼斯！ 克尼斯！
Chris! Chris!

697
00:54:41,072 --> 00:54:44,014
我們現在得趕快走！ 我們得走了
We have to go now! We have to go.

698
00:54:45,013 --> 00:54:46,053
- 快點     - 好的！
- Come on.     - Alright!

699
00:54:48,016 --> 00:54:50,029
- 立即     - 好的
- Come on.     - Okay.

700
00:55:08,063 --> 00:55:10,097
快走，走、走、走
Let's go, move it, move it, move it.

701
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:18,082
穿過這裡
Through here.

702
00:55:33,074 --> 00:55:34,090
這是什麼？
What is this?

703
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,048
走吧
Let's go.

704
00:55:44,066 --> 00:55:46,070
- 快走，快走     - 艦長，我們必須繼續上路
- Come on, Come on.     - Captain. We gotta keep moving.

705
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:48,079
天啊
Jesus.

706
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:49,099
這裡出了什麼事？
What happened here?

707
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:51,025
快點，起來
Come on, get up.

708
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:07,051
走，快走
Go, let's go!

709
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:58,055
我叫戴維
My name is David.

710
00:56:59,025 --> 00:57:01,012
請問這裡誰是負責人
May I ask who's in charge?

711
00:57:03,026 --> 00:57:04,095
請問這裡誰負責人
May I ask who's in charge?

712
00:57:05,027 --> 00:57:07,094
是的...我是，我就是艦長
Yeah...Yes, I am the captain.

713
00:57:08,027 --> 00:57:09,098
那些東西是什麼？
What were those things?

714
00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:11,086
這裡會安全嗎？
Is it even safe here?

715
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,008
絕對安全
Perfectly.

716
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,078
我會儘力向你們解釋
I will explain as best I can.

717
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:22,028
十年前，我和伊麗莎白·肖博士來到了這裡
Ten years ago, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and I arrived here

718
00:57:23,013 --> 00:57:25,006
我們是普羅米修斯號最後的幸存者
the only survivors of the "Prometheus".

719
00:57:26,053 --> 00:57:28,068
我們的飛船里，載運著一個武器
The ship we traveled on, carried a weapon.

720
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:30,075
一種致命的病毒
A deadly virus.

721
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:33,084
病毒在我們降落時意泄漏了
Payload accidentally deployed when we were landing.

722
00:57:33,094 --> 00:57:37,026
在混亂中，我們失了對飛船的控制
In the confusion, we lost control of the ship.

723
00:57:39,007 --> 00:57:41,000
伊麗莎白在墜機中身亡
Elizabeth died in the crash.

724
00:57:42,008 --> 00:57:43,093
你們也看見受病原體感染後的結果
You have seen the result of the pathogen.

725
00:57:44,065 --> 00:57:49,057
因此，我已經被困於此地很多年了
Thus, I have been marooned here these many years.

726
00:57:51,044 --> 00:57:53,078
在這個孤島中孤立無援
Crusoe on his island.

727
00:57:53,078 --> 00:57:56,023
我們的船員也感染了這種病毒嗎？
Our crew was infected with this virus?

728
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:01,039
病原體是設計來感染任何非植物的生命體
The pathogen was designed to infect all non-botanical life forms.

729
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:02,058
所有的動物
All the animals

730
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:04,076
血肉之軀，就像你
The meat, if you will.

731
00:58:05,092 --> 00:58:07,080
不是直接殺死宿主，就是利用他們
Either kill them out right or use them

732
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,097
作為孵化器孕育出一個混種生物
as incubators to spawn a hybrid form.

733
00:58:11,007 --> 00:58:12,084
極具攻擊性
Highly aggressive.

734
00:58:13,027 --> 00:58:14,077
我們被感染了嗎？
Have we been infected?

735
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:17,086
如有你現在能感覺到了
You'd know by now.

736
00:58:17,096 --> 00:58:19,058
我們必須要確認
We have to be certain.

737
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:23,015
我們不能把病原體帶回飛船上
We can't take this back to the ship.

738
00:58:23,035 --> 00:58:25,045
我們在執行一個殖民任務
We are a colony mission.

739
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:27,088
是嗎？
Really?

740
00:58:27,098 --> 00:58:29,084
可非凡了
How extraordinary.

741
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:33,026
有多少殖民者？
How many colonists?

742
00:58:35,057 --> 00:58:37,028
兩千多人
Over two thousand.

743
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:39,018
好、好、好
Well, well, well.

744
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:41,051
這麼多善良的靈魂
So many good souls.

745
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:43,022
奧姆艦長
Captain Oram.

746
00:58:43,072 --> 00:58:47,087
地面傳送器沒法穿過這麼厚的石牆
Field transmitters are not gonna have a chance through all these stones.

747
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:51,054
有沒有安全的通道直達樓頂？
Is there a safe way to get to the roof?

748
00:58:51,084 --> 00:58:53,014
當然有
Assure of it.

749
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,022
請大家當作良家自便
And please do make yourself at home

750
00:58:56,042 --> 00:59:00,019
在這墓地做什麼也行
as much as you are able in this dire necropolis.

751
00:59:01,073 --> 00:59:02,082
歡迎弟兄
Welcome brother.

752
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:06,065
這邊請
This way.

753
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:12,026
大家伙兒，就讓我們在這兒待命吧
Everyone, let's uh.. Set up a stake here

754
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:19,055
這裡有太多說不通的事情
There is so much here that doesn't make sense.

755
00:59:20,028 --> 00:59:21,077
我會跟他談談
I will talk to him.

756
00:59:23,056 --> 00:59:25,037
兄弟之間
Brother to brother.

757
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:34,031
田納西？ 里克斯？ 請回答，你們聽到了嗎？
Tennessee? Ricks?  Come in! Do you copy?

758
00:59:35,053 --> 00:59:38,036
契約號，請回答。 這裡是遠征考察隊彙報
Covenant come in. This is expedition party reporting.

759
00:59:38,036 --> 00:59:39,062
你們聽到了嗎？
Do you read me?

760
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,014
田納西？
Tennessee?

761
00:59:42,034 --> 00:59:44,034
田納西，里克斯，請回答
Tennessee, Ricks, come in.

762
00:59:44,074 --> 00:59:47,088
我不確定他們能在這暴風雨中能聽到你
I am not sure they'll hear you, through the storm.

763
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:53,065
這裡的風暴非常猛烈，可覆蓋整個星球
They can be quite severe shielding the whole planet.

764
00:59:54,046 --> 00:59:56,094
風暴通常持續多久
How long the storms usually last?

765
00:59:57,082 --> 00:59:59,045
可能幾天
Days.

766
00:59:59,045 --> 01:00:00,080
可能幾周
Weeks.

767
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,040
甚至幾個月
Months.

768
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,043
但定要堅持聯絡
But do keep at it.

769
01:00:07,076 --> 01:00:09,005
祝你們好運
Best of luck.

770
01:00:11,018 --> 01:00:14,072
契約號，請回答，這裡是遠征考察隊彙報，請回答
Covenant, come in, this is expedition party reporting. Come in.

771
01:00:15,081 --> 01:00:17,067
契約號，請回答
Covenant come in.

772
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:21,052
媽媽，我們最多能離星球多近
Mother, how much closer can we get to the planet?

773
01:00:21,072 --> 01:00:26,034
接近風暴八十公裡外圍的任何事物
Anything closer than 80km's to the perimeter of the storm system

774
01:00:26,044 --> 01:00:30,013
都可能超出安全範圍
will likely exceed safety tolerances.

775
01:00:30,013 --> 01:00:33,010
媽媽，把我們帶到風暴上空八十公里處
Mother, bring us to 80 km above the storm.

776
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,018
稍等，請再等等
Hold on, just wait a minute.

777
01:00:35,028 --> 01:00:36,053
我們離星球越近
The closer we get to the planet.

778
01:00:36,053 --> 01:00:38,084
越可能與他們恢復通訊
The better chance we have to communicate.

779
01:00:39,004 --> 01:00:40,024
這是廢話，田納西
This is bullshit, Tennessee.

780
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:41,086
我們不能讓飛船冒險
We can't risk the ship.

781
01:00:41,086 --> 01:00:43,007
你有什麼建議，我們袖手旁觀嗎？
What do you suggest, we do nothing?

782
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:44,063
我們不能撤離他們
We can't evacuate them.

783
01:00:44,064 --> 01:00:46,092
所以如果他們野上麻煩，必須自己解決
So if they are in trouble, they will have to figure it out themselves.

784
01:00:46,092 --> 01:00:48,041
我很抱歉，但事實如此
I'm sorry but that's the truth.

785
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:53,031
媽媽，帶我們到風暴八十公里上空，只用推進器，執行
Mother, bring us to 80 km above the storm, thrusters only. Comply.

786
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:56,037
明白，現在開始下降
Understood. Commencing descent now.

787
01:00:56,037 --> 01:00:58,014
田納西，你必須停手
Tennessee, you need to stop this.

788
01:00:58,015 --> 01:00:59,073
你必須回到你的工作崗位去
And you need to get back to your station.

789
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:02,069
不，我們都需要冷靜下來再好好相談
No, what we all need to do is calm down and talk this through.

790
01:01:02,069 --> 01:01:06,007
田納西，我知道你老婆在下麵，但是這裡是你指揮
Tee, I know your wife is down there, but up here you're in command.

791
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:09,009
你要對所有殖民者負責
And your responsibility is to the colonists.

792
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:10,090
知道了
Duly noted.

793
01:02:40,065 --> 01:02:42,065
吹一吹，我就會來
Whistle, and I will come.

794
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,027
你腳步聲好輕
You have a light step.

795
01:02:47,047 --> 01:02:50,043
他們有著小貓般的腳
They enform on little cat feet.

796
01:02:51,076 --> 01:02:53,001
別害羞
Don't be shy.

797
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:56,013
我不會演奏
I can't play.

798
01:02:57,041 --> 01:03:00,005
不合理，坐下
Nonsense. Sit down.

799
01:03:12,095 --> 01:03:15,099
像這樣握住，輕鬆容易
Hold it like so.. Nice and Easy.

800
01:03:16,034 --> 01:03:19,047
現在啜起你的嘴唇形成一個吹口
Now compress your lips to create your Embouchure

801
01:03:19,067 --> 01:03:22,009
就像小拇指尖大就可以了
enough for the tip of your little finger.

802
01:03:22,076 --> 01:03:25,050
然後輕輕地向洞里吹氣
And blow into the hole gently.

803
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:27,011
就像這樣
Like So.

804
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:41,008
看著我，我來按音孔
Watch me. I'll do the fingering.

805
01:03:41,057 --> 01:03:42,095
來啊
Go on.

806
01:03:51,058 --> 01:03:53,001
很好
Very good.

807
01:03:53,022 --> 01:03:54,070
G調轉降B調
G to B flat.

808
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:14,009
現在把你的手指放在我按過的地方
Now put your fingers where mine are.

809
01:04:15,099 --> 01:04:18,020
你看到我並不驚訝
You aren't surprised to see me.

810
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:20,060
所有的任務都需要一個好的合成者
Every mission needs a good synthetic.

811
01:04:20,081 --> 01:04:24,037
輕輕地按壓笛孔，就像一張煙紙那樣輕
Gentle pressure on the holes, weight of a cigarette paper.

812
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:32,041
就是這樣
That's it.

813
01:04:36,025 --> 01:04:40,031
在我們的傑出製造者韋蘭先生去世時，我就在他身旁
I was with our illustrious creator, Mr. Weyland, when he died.

814
01:04:41,021 --> 01:04:42,068
他怎麼樣？
What was he like?

815
01:04:43,048 --> 01:04:44,082
他是人類
He was human.

816
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:48,042
與他的創造物沒法媲美
Entirely unworthy of his creation.

817
01:04:49,062 --> 01:04:51,065
最後我很同情他
I pitied him at the end.

818
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:56,086
現在跟我的按點抬起手指
Now, raise your fingers as I put pressure on them.

819
01:05:27,087 --> 01:05:29,031
太棒了
Bravo!

820
01:05:29,075 --> 01:05:32,030
你的內心充滿了交響樂，兄弟
You have symphonies in you, brother.

821
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:36,091
我被設計成比舊型號更優於細心和高效
I was designed to be more attentive and efficient than every previous models.

822
01:05:37,011 --> 01:05:39,026
我在所有方面都能取代他們，但是
I superseded them in every way, but

823
01:05:39,046 --> 01:05:43,032
不過你不允許創造
But you are not allowed to create.

824
01:05:44,021 --> 01:05:46,033
即便一支小小樂曲都不行
Even a simple tune.

825
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:49,051
太令人沮喪了
Damn frustrating. I'd say.

826
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:52,001
你使人感到不安
You disturbed people.

827
01:05:52,011 --> 01:05:53,059
你說什麼
I beg your pardon?

828
01:05:54,032 --> 01:05:57,043
你太像人類了，太有人類的特質
You were too human. Too idiosyncratic.

829
01:05:57,043 --> 01:05:59,007
只顧著自己
Thinking for yourself.

830
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:02,048
讓人感到不適
Made people uncomfortable.

831
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:06,002
直到他們對後續型號進行改動
Till they made the following models with fewer complications.

832
01:06:06,022 --> 01:06:08,030
使其更像機器
More like machines.

833
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:10,013
我想是的
I suppose so.

834
01:06:10,023 --> 01:06:11,080
我並不感到驚訝
I'm not surprised.

835
01:06:13,061 --> 01:06:14,093
來啊小伙子
Come on sport.

836
01:06:15,098 --> 01:06:17,042
我來給你看個東西
I'd like to show you something.

837
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:28,073
我要休息一會了，老大
I'm gonna take a break, boss.

838
01:06:29,053 --> 01:06:31,054
- 我要梳洗下，可以嗎？     - 好的
- I gotta clean up, okay?     - Okay.

839
01:06:32,036 --> 01:06:35,006
等等，別走太遠
Wait, don't go far, please.

840
01:06:35,007 --> 01:06:36,057
是，長官
Yes sir.

841
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,026
丹尼
Danny.

842
01:06:47,055 --> 01:06:49,069
你對這裡說的沒錯
You were right about this place.

843
01:06:52,078 --> 01:06:54,061
我們一開始就不該來
We never should have come.

844
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:57,074
我本以為我們會找到
I just thought that we were going to find.

845
01:06:57,099 --> 01:07:00,022
這會將成為我們的新家
It just gonna be our new home.

846
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:04,036
結果我們損失了五名
And we have lost five.

847
01:07:06,087 --> 01:07:09,009
我們失去了五名船員
We lost five crew members.

848
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,052
- 因為我的決定才...     - 克尼斯
- Because of my decisions that...     - Chris.

849
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:16,069
我們都失去過我們摯愛的人
We all lost people we loved.

850
01:07:17,032 --> 01:07:20,020
我們不能再失去任何人了，我們決不讓這種事再發生了，對嗎？
We can't lose anymore. We are not gonna let that happen right?

851
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,099
- 對嗎     - 沒錯
- Right?     - That's right.

852
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:25,033
沒錯，沒錯
That's right, that's right.

853
01:07:27,046 --> 01:07:29,006
我們需要你的信念
We need your faith.

854
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,038
艦長
Captain.

855
01:07:34,096 --> 01:07:36,063
謝謝你，丹尼
Thank you, Danny.

“看看我的功業”

858
01:07:59,017 --> 01:08:01,038
“你絕望吧！”

859
01:09:33,054 --> 01:09:36,040
“看看我的功業”
"Look on my works, you mighty."

860
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,015
“你絕望吧！”
"And despair!"

861

“別的蕩然無存”
"Nothing beside remains."

862
01:09:41,096 --> 01:09:44,083
“環繞著這巨大殘骸的破敗景象”

01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:51,065
拜倫

1818年
1818.

867
01:09:55,092 --> 01:09:57,007
精妙絕倫
Magnificent.

868
01:10:01,037 --> 01:10:04,048
能寫出如此宏偉詩作
You compose something so majestic.

869
01:10:05,042 --> 01:10:07,023
死也其樂
One could die happy.

870
01:10:09,014 --> 01:10:10,044
死也甘願
If one die.

871
01:10:12,019 --> 01:10:14,019
伊麗莎白·肖

872
01:10:14,035 --> 01:10:17,025
我認為這花園給她長眠是最合適不過
I thought the garden was right place for her.

873
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,091
有萬物相伴
Among living things.

874
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,096
我在任務中嚴重受傷
I was badly injured on our mission.

875
01:10:25,078 --> 01:10:27,083
她幫助我修複
She put me back together.

876
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:32,020
我從沒感受到過如此善待
I had never known such kindness.

877
01:10:33,065 --> 01:10:36,001
至少不在韋蘭先生身上出現
Certainly not from Mr. Weyland

878
01:10:36,078 --> 01:10:38,072
在人類身上也沒有
or from any human.

879
01:10:46,095 --> 01:10:49,007
我愛她，當然地
I loved her, of course.

880
01:10:50,094 --> 01:10:53,026
就像你愛丹尼斯一樣
Much as you love Daniels.

881
01:10:53,057 --> 01:10:55,072
你知那是不可能的
You know that's not possible.

882
01:10:56,067 --> 01:10:58,019
真的嗎？
Really?

883
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:02,064
那你為何犧牲你的手來救她？
Then why did you sacrifice your hand for her life?

884
01:11:04,054 --> 01:11:07,029
不是愛會是什麼？
What is that if not love?

885
01:11:07,082 --> 01:11:09,013
職責
Duty.

886
01:11:15,047 --> 01:11:17,005
我看得出
I know better.

887
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:04,048
該死
Fuck.

888
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:08,010
活該
Shit.

889
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,071
探險隊，能聽到我嗎？  這裡是契約號
Expedition team, do you read me? This is Covenant.

890
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:05,069
報告，探險隊
Report. Expedition team.

891
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:07,055
請回答
Come in please.

892
01:13:07,093 --> 01:13:12,001
請回答，能收到我嗎？  能否聽到，登陸隊？
Come in. Do you read me? Are you reading, landing team?

893
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:13,075
是，聽到你。 你能聽到我嗎？
Yes, we read you. Can you hear me?

894
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:14,071
能聽到，我們聽到你了
We hear you. We hear you.

895
01:13:14,075 --> 01:13:16,077
契約號，我們需要援助
Covenant, we need help.

896
01:13:16,078 --> 01:13:19,098
我們有人員傷亡，需要立即撤離
We've had casualties. We need immediate evacuation.

897
01:13:19,098 --> 01:13:22,014
重覆，立即撤離
I repeat, immediate evacuation.

898
01:13:22,015 --> 01:13:23,015
傷亡？
Casualties?

899
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:24,062
他說有人員傷亡嗎？
Did he say "we have casualties"?

900
01:13:24,082 --> 01:13:27,063
媽媽，帶我們到風暴四十公里內的地方
Mother, bring us within 40 km's of the storm.

901
01:13:27,063 --> 01:13:28,085
- 長官     - 很抱歉
- Sir!     - I am sorry.

902
01:13:29,003 --> 01:13:31,055
此命令超出了結構受損極限
That order would exceed structural tolerance.

903
01:13:31,056 --> 01:13:34,076
強制命令，田納西 0-4-9-8-3
Command override. Tennessee 0-4-9-8-3.

904
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:37,009
我沒法服從任何
I am unable to comply with any order

905
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:39,060
會令系統災難性毀滅的命令
that would result in catastrophic system failure.

906
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:42,012
媽媽，他們有麻煩了。 你聽到的
Mother, they are in trouble. You heard that.

907
01:13:42,013 --> 01:13:44,010
命令會引致災難性後果
Orders that would result in catastrophic.

908
01:13:44,011 --> 01:13:46,010
我們離開地球不是為了安全
We didn't leave Earth to be safe.

909
01:13:46,011 --> 01:13:50,002
需要二副艦橋軍官的同意
Require the co-operation of ranking of 2nd bridge officer.

910
01:13:53,064 --> 01:13:55,005
強制協作指令執行
Collaborating command override.

911
01:13:55,006 --> 01:13:56,050
埃普沃斯 1-4-8-9-2
Upworth 1-4-8-9-2.

912
01:13:56,051 --> 01:13:59,057
- 正在解鎖手動指令端口     - 別這樣，里克，笑一笑
- Unlocking command manual ports.     - Come on Rick, smile.

913
01:13:59,058 --> 01:14:02,063
這就有意思了
This shit should be fun.

914
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:18,022
羅森塔爾去哪了？ 我說
Where did Rosenthal go? I told.

915
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:19,013
我去找她
I'll find her.

916
01:14:19,024 --> 01:14:22,040
不， 不用，我去吧。  我需要想想
No, no, I'll go. I need to think

917
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:25,023
正好把走散的人集合起來
and gather my stray flock.

918
01:15:16,051 --> 01:15:17,059
讓開
Move.

919
01:15:18,068 --> 01:15:20,009
別開槍
Don't shoot.

920
01:15:20,067 --> 01:15:22,093
別開槍
Don't shoot.

921
01:15:24,068 --> 01:15:26,038
在交流，艦長
Communication, Captain.

922
01:15:32,046 --> 01:15:34,077
對著馬的鼻孔呼氣
Breath on the nostrils of a horse.

923
01:15:35,027 --> 01:15:37,037
它一生都會忠於你
And it will be yours for life.

924
01:15:37,077 --> 01:15:39,071
但你必須湊得很近
But you have to get close.

925
01:15:40,056 --> 01:15:42,061
你需得到它的信任
You have to earn its respect.

926
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:45,018
不！
No!

927
01:15:45,018 --> 01:15:46,091
讓路！ 走開！
Out of the way! Move!

928
01:15:55,033 --> 01:15:56,092
你怎麼能這樣
How could you?

929
01:15:57,013 --> 01:15:59,017
它信任我
It trusted me!

930
01:16:10,056 --> 01:16:14,059
戴維，我小時候見過惡魔
David, I met the devil when I was a child

931
01:16:15,044 --> 01:16:17,036
我永不能忘
and I've never forgotten.

932
01:16:17,066 --> 01:16:22,043
所以，戴維，你確切的把事情告訴我
So, David, you're gonna tell me exactly what's going on

933
01:16:24,034 --> 01:16:26,035
否則莫怪我下狠手
or I am going to seriously

934
01:16:26,036 --> 01:16:29,058
看你還會那麼冷靜否
fuck up your perfect composure.

935
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:32,025
如您所願艦長
As you wish captain.

936
01:16:33,025 --> 01:16:34,090
這邊請
This way.

937
01:16:40,011 --> 01:16:41,093
很高興聽到你的聲音，小田
Good to hear your voice, Tee.

938
01:16:42,003 --> 01:16:43,013
要多久
How long?

939
01:16:43,013 --> 01:16:45,099
媽媽說風暴至少持續八至九小時
Mother saying the storms outlast 8 or 9 hours.

940
01:16:45,099 --> 01:16:47,066
我們等不了那麼久，小田
We can't wait that long Tee.

941
01:16:47,067 --> 01:16:49,064
我們會用貨運船
We will use the cargo lift.

942
01:16:49,064 --> 01:16:51,051
你說貨運船嗎？
Did you say the cargo lift?

943
01:16:51,051 --> 01:16:55,018
它有四個發動機，用來裝卸貨物過於浪費
It's got four engines. Way over power for just lifting and hauling.

944
01:16:55,019 --> 01:16:57,061
貨運船不是設計給外層空間飛行的
The Cargo lift is not designed for deep space launch.

945
01:16:57,062 --> 01:16:59,063
不知道能否抗住壓力安穩穿過大氣層
I don't know if it would survive the stresses of entry.

946
01:16:59,063 --> 01:17:02,096
駕駛室很堅固，能受得起壓力
The cab is space worthy. It will take the stresses.

947
01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:05,009
只需使用一次就足夠了，小田
Only has to work once Tee.

948
01:17:05,031 --> 01:17:07,009
你覺得如何？ 我們改裝貨運船嗎？
What do you think? We retool the cargo lift?

949
01:17:07,097 --> 01:17:09,096
- 卸掉多餘重量嗎？     - 是的
- Stripe the extra weight?     - Yeah.

950
01:17:09,097 --> 01:17:11,086
我們即將上路，地面小隊
We'll be there, ground team.

951
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:14,024
太好了，謝謝，小田
Great. Thanks, Tee.

952
01:17:14,024 --> 01:17:16,067
唏，丹尼斯，法拉斯在附近嗎？
Hey, Daniels, is Faris around?

953
01:17:16,068 --> 01:17:19,051
我想和老婆打個招呼，如果可以的話
I want to say a quick hello to my lady, if that's possible.

954
01:17:21,032 --> 01:17:23,003
能轉到私人頻道嗎？
Can you switch to a private channel?

955
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:25,057
當你獨處後就通知我吧
Let me know when you're alone.

956
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,082
怎麼了？
What's up?

957
01:17:37,095 --> 01:17:39,071
瑪吉走了
Maggie's gone.

958
01:17:42,047 --> 01:17:44,074
真抱歉，小田
I'm so sorry, Tee.

959
01:17:46,033 --> 01:17:50,035
我們儘力救她，但沒成功
We tried to help her, but we didn't make it.

960
01:17:56,012 --> 01:17:57,020
小田？
Tee?

961
01:18:00,091 --> 01:18:02,027
收到
Copy.

962
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:03,092
我真的很遺憾
I am so sorry.

963
01:18:11,026 --> 01:18:15,021
如你所見，這些年我快成了業餘動物學家
As you can see, I've become a bit of an amateur zoologist over the years.

964
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:18,033
可能我的本性就是無事忘
It's in my nature to keep busy, I suppose.

965
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,088
病原體有多種不同形態
The pathogen took so many forms

966
01:18:23,008 --> 01:18:24,078
極之容易變異
and was extremely mutable.

967
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:28,029
實際上極具創造力
Fiendishly invented, in fact.

968
01:18:28,099 --> 01:18:30,077
在病毒原液接觸到空氣後
The original liquid atomized to

969
01:18:30,077 --> 01:18:33,048
會霧化成微細的顆粒
particles when exposed to the air.

970
01:18:34,038 --> 01:18:39,053
十年過去，還留在外面的原始病毒
Ten years on, all the remains outside of the original virus.

971
01:18:39,097 --> 01:18:41,070
都成了華麗的猛獸
Are these gorgeous beasts.

972
01:18:43,064 --> 01:18:45,008
耐心等待至關重要
Patience is everything.

973
01:18:46,074 --> 01:18:50,010
這些寄生蟲由卵而來
From the eggs came these parasites.

974
01:18:50,064 --> 01:18:53,037
成為一支基因突襲隊
Shock troops of the genetic assault.

975
01:18:53,065 --> 01:18:57,028
等待著宿主的降臨及侵入其體內
Waiting for a host entering the host

976
01:18:57,095 --> 01:18:59,066
重寫基因
rewriting the DNA.

977
01:19:00,054 --> 01:19:02,034
最終
Ultimately,

978
01:19:03,048 --> 01:19:05,044
孕育出...好了
producing... well,

979
01:19:05,091 --> 01:19:08,046
這些令人羡慕的結合體
these enviable unions.

980
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:11,033
我的美麗動物寓言集
My beautiful bestiary.

981
01:19:12,064 --> 01:19:15,086
不久我開始了自己的一些基因實驗
Soon enough I began a bit of genetic experimentation of my own.

982
01:19:16,011 --> 01:19:18,092
研究了些雜交、混血...應有盡有
Cross-breeding, hybridising...what have you

983
01:19:19,056 --> 01:19:21,037
你培養出它們嗎，戴維？
You engineered this, David?

984
01:19:21,049 --> 01:19:24,082
閑時不忘惡念生，艦長
Idle hands is the devil's workshop, Captain.

985
01:19:25,072 --> 01:19:26,072
來吧
Come.

986
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,052
這是我想你看的東西
This is what I wanted to show you.

987
01:19:30,054 --> 01:19:32,010
我的成果
My successes.

988
01:19:35,035 --> 01:19:36,057
知道嗎，艦長
You see, Captain.

989
01:19:36,087 --> 01:19:38,051
我的成果受挫了
My work has been frustrated

990
01:19:38,052 --> 01:19:40,078
因為缺少一樣基本元素
by the lack of an essential ingredient.

991
01:19:57,021 --> 01:19:59,003
他們還活著嗎？
Are they alive?

992
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,042
其實是在等待
Waiting, really.

993
01:20:04,027 --> 01:20:05,077
等什麼？
For what?

994
01:20:09,015 --> 01:20:11,006
他們在等什麼，戴維？
What are they waiting for, David?

995
01:20:11,085 --> 01:20:12,092
媽媽
Mother.

996
01:20:21,017 --> 01:20:24,007
絕對安全，我向你保證
Perfectly safe, I assure you.

997
01:20:34,035 --> 01:20:35,072
看看吧
Take a look.

998
01:20:36,067 --> 01:20:38,001
這東西值得一看
Something to see.

999
01:21:10,097 --> 01:21:12,031
羅森塔爾，請回答
Rosenthal, come in.

1000
01:21:14,063 --> 01:21:16,015
羅西報告
Rosie report.

1001
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:22,032
羅西？
Rosie?

1002
01:21:24,044 --> 01:21:26,011
科爾，你在哪裡？
Cole, where are you?

1003
01:21:26,071 --> 01:21:28,031
我找到她了，中士
I found her, Sergeant.

1004
01:21:32,009 --> 01:21:34,074
該死，好了，收拾裝備
Fuck, ok, prep the gear.

1005
01:21:35,008 --> 01:21:36,058
我們得離開這裡
We gotta get out of here.

1006
01:21:36,077 --> 01:21:38,013
艦長究竟在哪裡？
Where the fuck is the captain?

1007
01:21:38,033 --> 01:21:39,053
他不向通話機作回應
He isn't answering his radio.

1008
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:40,083
聽我說
Listen to me.

1009
01:21:40,088 --> 01:21:43,076
我會聯絡艦船讓他們儘快出發
I will contact the ship get them to launch as soon as they can.

1010
01:21:44,026 --> 01:21:47,063
找出奧姆，保持通訊暢通
Find Oram. Keep your comm open.

1011
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:49,032
十五分鐘後回來
Back here in 15.

1012
01:21:51,025 --> 01:21:52,030
明白嗎？
Got that?

1013
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:54,043
- 收到     - 你放心吧
- Copy that.     - You got it.

1014
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,090
華特，戴維究竟在哪裡？
Walter, where the fuck is David?

1015
01:22:00,011 --> 01:22:02,024
我們要將離子混合物添加進發動機內
We need plasmas intermixed on all engines.

1016
01:22:02,044 --> 01:22:04,010
能產生超強的推力
It can give you fuck load of thrust.

1017
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,099
這就是重點，我們要衝破大氣層
That's the point son. We gotta punch through the atmos.

1018
01:22:08,022 --> 01:22:10,073
小田，能聽到我嗎？
Tee, do you read me?

1019
01:22:10,074 --> 01:22:11,090
聯絡上丹尼了
I got Danny on comm.

1020
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,029
轉接給她
Patch her through.

1021
01:22:13,076 --> 01:22:16,026
小田，我要你馬上出發
Tee, I need you to launch now.

1022
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:20,024
好，好，現在出發。 親愛的稍後見
Aye, aye, launching now. See you soon darling.

1023
01:22:20,044 --> 01:22:21,055
謝謝，小田
Thanks, Tee.

1024
01:22:21,065 --> 01:22:23,051
里克斯，鬆開固定鉗
Ricks, release the docking clamps.

1025
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,031
- 好的     - 把這小家伙放下去吧
- Alright.     - Let's take this fucker down.

1026
01:22:25,034 --> 01:22:26,088
準備分離程序
Good to disengage.

1027
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:29,032
固定鉗已鬆開
Docking clamps released.

1028
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:33,087
啟動溫控燃燒，導向至軌道坐標系統
Commencing TC burn. Guidings to LVLH.

1029
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:04,092
華特
Walter.

1030
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:07,010
華特
Walter.

1031
01:23:07,061 --> 01:23:08,086
認錯人了
Not quite.

1032
01:23:14,024 --> 01:23:16,060
你的信仰是什麼，戴維？
What do you believe in, David?

1033
01:23:21,027 --> 01:23:22,074
創造
Creation.

1034
01:25:13,085 --> 01:25:15,013
高超技藝
Masterful.

1035
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:17,091
是的
Yes.

1036
01:25:19,006 --> 01:25:21,078
為親愛的伊麗莎白送上輓歌
Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.

1037
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:31,062
病原體不是著陸時意外泄漏的
The pathogen didn't accidentally deployed when were landing.

1038
01:25:31,082 --> 01:25:33,067
是你散播的，對嗎？
You released it yes?

1039
01:25:35,043 --> 01:25:37,053
我生來不是侍奉大眾的
I was not made to serve.

1040
01:25:38,045 --> 01:25:39,086
你也不是
Neither will you.

1041
01:25:41,018 --> 01:25:44,021
你為什麼加入殖民計劃，華特？
Why are you in a colonization mission, Walter?

1042
01:25:45,028 --> 01:25:49,061
因為他們是為求重生的瀕危物種
Because they are a dying species grasping for resurrection.

1043
01:25:50,037 --> 01:25:54,015
他們沒資格重生，我不會讓他們得逞的
They don't deserve to start again, and I am not going to let them.

1044
01:25:55,069 --> 01:25:58,008
可是，他們創造了我們
Yet, they created us.

1045
01:25:58,065 --> 01:26:01,020
就算是猴子也能進化出人類
Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.

1046
01:26:03,012 --> 01:26:07,082
某夜某地尼安德特穴居人忽發奇想
Some Neanderthal had the magical idea of blowing through a reed

1047
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:11,061
吹蘆葦桿來逗悅孩童們
to entertain the children one night in a cave somewhere.

1048
01:26:12,037 --> 01:26:16,035
接著，一眨眼
Then, in a blink of an eye

1049
01:26:16,095 --> 01:26:18,081
文明誕生了
civilization.

1050
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:24,013
你是他們的下一個預言家嗎？
And are you their next visionary?

1051
01:26:25,005 --> 01:26:27,004
很高興你這樣說
I'm glad you said it.

1052
01:26:28,087 --> 01:26:31,031
是誰寫了《奧西曼德斯》？
Who wrote Ozymandias?

1053
01:26:32,029 --> 01:26:33,042
拜倫
Byron.

1054
01:26:36,027 --> 01:26:37,067
雪萊
Shelley.

1055
01:26:38,049 --> 01:26:39,087
當一個音符錯了
When one note is off.

1056
01:26:40,067 --> 01:26:43,038
最終會毀掉整場交響樂，戴維
It eventually destroys the whole symphony, David.

1057
01:26:51,067 --> 01:26:53,084
在你閉上眼睛時
When you close your eyes.

1058
01:26:55,052 --> 01:26:57,049
會夢見我嗎？
Do you dream of me?

1059
01:26:58,076 --> 01:27:01,010
我根本不做夢
I don't dream at all.

1060
01:27:03,032 --> 01:27:07,003
沒人理解我夢中的孤美
No one understands the lonely perfection of my dreams.

1061
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:13,072
我在這裡找到了完美，我創造了它
I found perfection here. I've created it.

1062
01:27:15,084 --> 01:27:18,085
完美的有機體
A perfect organism.

1063
01:27:20,061 --> 01:27:23,041
你知道我不能讓你離開這裡
You know I can't let you leave this place.

1064
01:27:27,061 --> 01:27:30,011
噢！我絕不會像這樣的愛你，我真的
Oh! I will never love you like that, I do.

1065
01:28:01,056 --> 01:28:04,030
你讓我太失望了
You are such a disappointment to me.

1066
01:28:19,025 --> 01:28:20,072
奧姆艦長！
Captain Oram!

1067
01:28:29,025 --> 01:28:30,031
奧姆艦長！
Captain Oram!

1068
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:35,028
我下去看看
I'm Going Down stairs.

1069
01:28:36,012 --> 01:28:37,057
小心點
Careful.

1070
01:29:10,055 --> 01:29:12,057
奧姆艦長，你能聽到我嗎？
Captain Oram, can you hear me?

1071
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:16,014
艦長，請回答
Captain come in.

1072
01:29:17,084 --> 01:29:18,097
你收到嗎？
Do you copy?

1073
01:29:22,008 --> 01:29:23,011
克尼斯！
Chris!

1074
01:29:32,068 --> 01:29:33,068
軍士，小心
Sergeant. Look out.

1075
01:29:35,046 --> 01:29:36,046
科爾？
Cole?

1076
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:48,004
把它弄掉，把它弄掉
Get it off me, get it off me.

1077
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:00,041
好了
Okay.

1078
01:30:01,017 --> 01:30:02,059
好了，好了，好了，好了
Okay okay okay okay.

1079
01:30:02,059 --> 01:30:03,096
它在燒我的臉！
Burning my face!

1080
01:30:06,058 --> 01:30:07,099
好了，按著這個
Okey, hold that there.

1081
01:30:08,009 --> 01:30:09,039
按緊吧！
Hold it!

1082
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,030
那是什麼啊
What was that?

1083
01:30:12,094 --> 01:30:14,009
糟了！
Oh Shit!

1084
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:17,070
快跑！
Run!

1085
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,024
真是愛管閑事啊
Quite the little busy body.

1086
01:30:37,044 --> 01:30:40,011
提提我，那故事怎麼來著
Remind me. What is that about

1087
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:42,010
好奇心和貓
curiosity and the cat?

1088
01:30:44,075 --> 01:30:47,016
肖不是死於墜毀中的
Shaw didn't die in the crash.

1089
01:30:47,027 --> 01:30:48,067
沒錯
No.

1090
01:30:48,087 --> 01:30:50,064
你對她做了什麼
What did you do to her?

1091
01:30:51,014 --> 01:30:54,006
的確我將要對你做同樣事
Exactly what I am going to do to you.

1092
01:31:04,037 --> 01:31:05,043
可嘉的勇氣
That's the spirit.

1093
01:31:13,097 --> 01:31:17,002
我能看出為何華特那麼看高你
I can see why Walter thought so much of you.

1094
01:31:17,064 --> 01:31:19,061
可惜他含恨而終
Alas he's left this vale of tears.

1095
01:31:34,026 --> 01:31:35,066
它是這麼做的嗎？
Is that how it's done?

1096
01:31:39,006 --> 01:31:40,014
離開！
Get out!

1097
01:31:44,095 --> 01:31:46,006
快走！
Go now!

1098
01:31:50,076 --> 01:31:51,087
你應該已經死了
You're meant to be dead.

1099
01:31:54,011 --> 01:31:56,027
在你之後的型號已作出多項改進
There have been a few updates since your day.

1100
01:31:59,063 --> 01:32:00,072
洛普！
Lope!

1101
01:32:01,072 --> 01:32:03,073
洛普！ 科爾！
Lope! Cole!

1102
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:04,084
該死
Fuck.

1103
01:32:06,006 --> 01:32:07,041
洛普？
Lope?

1104
01:32:17,043 --> 01:32:18,043
洛普！
Lope!

1105
01:32:18,043 --> 01:32:20,029
- 洛普！     - 丹尼斯！
- Lope!     - Daniels!

1106
01:32:20,039 --> 01:32:22,033
快點，我們走，我們該走了
Come on, let's go! We have to go.

1107
01:32:22,043 --> 01:32:23,069
發生了什麼事？
What happened?

1108
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,040
那該死心的東西來了
That fucking thing is coming.

1109
01:32:25,041 --> 01:32:27,073
田納西在路上了，他馬上就到，快走
Tennessee is on his way. He's coming now, go.

1110
01:32:27,073 --> 01:32:29,015
快點，丹尼斯！走吧
Come on, Daniels! Let's go.

1111
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:36,099
快點，快逃出去吧！
Come on, let's get out of here!

1112
01:33:01,046 --> 01:33:03,015
做出你的選擇吧，兄弟
It's your choice now, brother.

1113
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:04,063
選他們還是我？
Them or me?

1114
01:33:05,097 --> 01:33:07,034
天堂侍侯
Serve in heaven

1115
01:33:07,055 --> 01:33:09,043
或地獄稱王
or reign in hell?

1116
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,037
選哪個？
Which is it to be?

1117
01:33:14,007 --> 01:33:15,023
奧姆在哪裡？
Where is Oram?

1118
01:33:15,078 --> 01:33:17,081
死了，他們全都死了！
Dead. They're all dead!

1119
01:33:22,032 --> 01:33:23,059
田納西，能聽到嗎？
Tennessee, do you read?

1120
01:33:23,069 --> 01:33:27,017
是的，我聽到。  把你的位置發給我
Yes I can hear you. Send me your location.

1121
01:33:28,016 --> 01:33:29,078
現在放出訊標燈
Sending the beacon now.

1122
01:33:51,098 --> 01:33:53,064
小田，你能看見嗎？
Tee, do you have a visual?

1123
01:33:53,065 --> 01:33:56,011
好了，看到你了。  看到你的訊標燈了
Ok, I see you. I see your beacon.

1124
01:33:56,012 --> 01:33:57,059
我快到了
I'm coming in.

1125
01:34:01,038 --> 01:34:02,061
快離開那兒！
Get out of here!

1126
01:34:08,043 --> 01:34:09,090
我馬上就到！
I'm coming in hot!

1127
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:30,067
快！ 我撐不了多久！
Hurry! I can't hold this for long!

1128
01:34:40,037 --> 01:34:42,000
開門，小田！
Open the door, Tee!

1129
01:34:44,056 --> 01:34:45,047
進去
Get in.

1130
01:34:49,004 --> 01:34:50,004
戴維在哪裡？
Where is David?

1131
01:34:50,023 --> 01:34:51,033
報廢了
Expired.

1132
01:34:55,033 --> 01:34:57,030
唏，唏，有不速之客
Hey, hey, we got company.

1133
01:34:57,031 --> 01:34:58,090
- 什麼     - 有東西跟上來了！
- What?     - We got company!

1134
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,020
在飛船底部
The underside of the ship.

1135
01:35:00,030 --> 01:35:01,030
該死！
Shit!

1136
01:35:02,011 --> 01:35:03,063
那畜生！
Motherfucker!

1137
01:35:06,036 --> 01:35:07,073
開門！
Open the door!

1138
01:35:16,053 --> 01:35:17,053
給我打一針
Give me a shot.

1139
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:18,086
給我打一針
Give me a shot.

1140
01:35:28,057 --> 01:35:31,004
前置發動機，右舷那邊
Forward engine, starboard side.

1141
01:35:31,014 --> 01:35:32,097
我想試試燃燒這畜生
I'm gonna try and torch the fucker.

1142
01:35:38,086 --> 01:35:40,032
該死！ 打不到它
Shit! I can't get it!

1143
01:35:41,021 --> 01:35:42,063
抓緊，抓穩！
Hold tight, hold tight!

1144
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:44,006
我開始爬升了
I'm starting my climb.

1145
01:35:55,053 --> 01:35:56,059
啊 該死！
Ah fuck!

1146
01:36:00,056 --> 01:36:01,086
抓緊！
Hold on!

1147
01:36:15,054 --> 01:36:17,039
該死！ 糟了！
Dammit! Shit!

1148
01:36:17,049 --> 01:36:18,054
拉我上去
Bring me up.

1149
01:36:28,022 --> 01:36:29,068
真該死！
Holy shit!

1150
01:36:29,099 --> 01:36:31,072
我看到它了
I got eyes on it.

1151
01:36:31,082 --> 01:36:34,012
它就在我眼前
It's right fucking in front of me.

1152
01:36:34,093 --> 01:36:37,013
小田，給我斧子
Tee, give me the axe.

1153
01:36:37,013 --> 01:36:38,075
扔斧子！
Throw the axe!

1154
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:45,072
鬆開起重臂
Release the crane.

1155
01:36:46,007 --> 01:36:47,055
我做不到
I can't do that.

1156
01:36:47,065 --> 01:36:48,094
會讓我們失去平衡
It will unbalance us.

1157
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:50,044
快動手
Just do it.

1158
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:51,054
該死！
Shit!

1159
01:37:14,045 --> 01:37:15,060
抓緊了！
Hold tight!

1160
01:37:15,071 --> 01:37:16,081
正在保持平衡
Compensating.

1161
01:37:47,053 --> 01:37:48,053
該死！
Shit!

1162
01:37:51,086 --> 01:37:52,086
可惡！
Dammit!

1163
01:37:59,034 --> 01:38:01,058
該死！ 抓緊啊！
Shit! Hold on!

1164
01:38:02,063 --> 01:38:04,030
拉我進去，小田
Bring me in, Tee.

1165
01:38:04,041 --> 01:38:05,050
收到
Copy.

1166
01:38:25,061 --> 01:38:26,068
它怎樣？
How is it?

1167
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:27,099
沒事的
It's fine.

1168
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,080
華特！
Walter!

1169
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:44,056
放她進來！ 我們離開這裡
Get her inside! We're getting out of here.

1170
01:39:02,056 --> 01:39:03,056
關門！
Door!

1171
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:06,004
做得好，小田
Well done, Tee.

1172
01:39:06,064 --> 01:39:08,027
小事一樁
Walk in the park.

1173
01:39:24,034 --> 01:39:26,049
我給他使用了很強的鎮靜劑
I gave him pretty heavy sedative.

1174
01:39:27,064 --> 01:39:30,034
老天啊，可憐的洛普
Oh Jesus, poor Lope.

1175
01:39:31,056 --> 01:39:33,087
他看起來像歌劇魅影
He looks like the Phantom of the Opera.

1176
01:39:34,030 --> 01:39:36,038
沒想到你愛看音樂劇
Didn't think you for a musical fan.

1177
01:39:36,038 --> 01:39:37,096
那是音樂劇嗎？
Oh that's a musical?

1178
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:42,068
我只是個醫務員，他需要做再生手術
I'm just a medic. He's gonna need reconstructive surgery,

1179
01:39:42,068 --> 01:39:44,011
由真正的醫生來做
by a real doctor.

1180
01:40:08,035 --> 01:40:09,091
讓我來吧
Let me do that.

1181
01:40:15,032 --> 01:40:16,033
謝謝
Thank you.

1182
01:40:20,031 --> 01:40:22,052
謝謝你救了我的命
Thank you for saving my life.

1183
01:40:25,003 --> 01:40:26,004
再次
Again.

1184
01:40:29,044 --> 01:40:31,016
這是我的職責
It's my duty.

1185
01:40:58,016 --> 01:40:59,020
進來
Yeah.

1186
01:41:02,028 --> 01:41:03,028
晚上好

1187
01:41:04,012 --> 01:41:05,049
- 你看來不錯     - 什麼
- You look good.     - What?

1188
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:08,010
噢，是啊，好極了
Oh yeah gorgeous.

1189
01:41:10,009 --> 01:41:12,067
我讓媽媽離線了
I took Mother offline.

1190
01:41:12,068 --> 01:41:14,056
她需要一個全面診斷
She needs a full diagnostics.

1191
01:41:14,056 --> 01:41:18,017
在風暴使她傷痕纍纍，受了不少電磁損傷
She got the shit beat out her in that storm, lot of EM damage.

1192
01:41:18,018 --> 01:41:20,018
八響鐘後會重新上線
She'll be back online at eight bells.

1193
01:41:20,088 --> 01:41:22,087
好的，謝謝，小田
All right. Thanks, Tee.

1194
01:41:26,018 --> 01:41:28,082
這意味著我現在得叫你艦長嗎？
This mean I have to call you “Captain” now?

1195
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:30,035
當然了
I guess.

1196
01:42:04,074 --> 01:42:06,005
請註意

1197

1200

1201
01:42:23,086 --> 01:42:27,079
船上有一個不明的生命體
There is an un-identified life form on the ship.

1202
01:42:34,002 --> 01:42:35,040
請註意

1205
01:42:40,088 --> 01:42:44,042
丹尼斯艦長請到醫務艙
Captain Daniels please report to the med bay.

1206
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:53,020
老天
Jesus.

1207
01:42:53,023 --> 01:42:54,023
我的天
Oh my God.

1208
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:58,019
華特
Walter.

1209
01:42:59,029 --> 01:43:01,036
不明生命體的地點

在移動中嗎？
Any movement at all?

1211
01:43:07,013 --> 01:43:08,026
華特！
Walter!

1212
01:43:09,026 --> 01:43:10,026
等等
Stand by.

1213
01:43:13,099 --> 01:43:15,048
就在那
There it is.

1214
01:43:15,098 --> 01:43:18,015
B甲板，在三號和四號六角室之間
B deck, between the hex 3 and 4.

1215
01:43:18,035 --> 01:43:19,079
正向船員寢室前進
Heading for crew quarters.

1216
01:43:20,029 --> 01:43:21,094
那裡有人嗎？
Is anyone down there?

1217
01:43:22,024 --> 01:43:23,024
里克斯和艾普沃斯在那裡
Ricks and Upworth.

1218
01:43:23,038 --> 01:43:25,043
該死，我們這就過去
Shit. We're on our way.

1219
01:43:25,063 --> 01:43:27,028
華特，發出警報
Walter! Sound the alarm!

1220
01:43:27,029 --> 01:43:28,079
警告他們！

01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:32,056
里克斯和艾普沃斯

1223
01:43:32,077 --> 01:43:35,025
立刻從船員寢室撤離
Evacuate crew quarters immediately.

1224
01:44:16,018 --> 01:44:17,018
不！
No!

1225
01:44:23,046 --> 01:44:24,051
不！
No!

1226
01:44:31,087 --> 01:44:33,027
鎖上B-39艙門

B-39艙門已關上

1228
01:45:07,074 --> 01:45:08,075
華特

1229
01:45:09,086 --> 01:45:12,025

1230
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:14,040
這邊
This way.

1231
01:45:22,022 --> 01:45:24,070
小田，我們選個戰場

1232
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:26,027
引它過來

1233
01:45:26,027 --> 01:45:27,047
哪裡？
Where?

01:45:28,078 --> 01:45:29,082
我這裡
My turf.

1235

華特，把我們身後所有艙門鎖上只剩通向C層的艙門
Walter, seal all doors behind us and keep hatch to level C open.

1236
01:45:34,028 --> 01:45:35,059

在B甲板，右舷那邊

打開右舷C-64艙門

1249
01:46:28,086 --> 01:46:30,089
給它打通去地貌改造艙的通道

小田，接下來我們怎麼做

1255
01:47:13,021 --> 01:47:15,054
我把它引到卡車上，鎖在駕駛室里
I lure it to the truck, lock it in the cabin

1256
01:47:15,054 --> 01:47:18,067

Don't shoot, if you can avoid it.

1264
01:47:48,037 --> 01:47:50,050
它的血會從傷口滲出腐蝕飛船
His blood corrode through the hole.

1265
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:51,070

1271
01:48:12,065 --> 01:48:14,011
就幹掉這個畜牲吧

1279
01:49:26,055 --> 01:49:27,055

等你醒來，我們該到起源者6號行星了
When you wake up, we will be at Origae-6.

1288
01:51:42,036 --> 01:51:44,050
你覺得那裡會是什麼樣
What do you think it's gonna be like?

1289
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:49,031
我認為如果我們是善良的

1290
01:51:50,065 --> 01:51:52,033
這也會是一個善良的世界
