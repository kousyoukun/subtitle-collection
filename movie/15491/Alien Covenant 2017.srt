2
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:21,288
How do you feel?

3
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:22,986
Alive.

4
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:25,225
What do you see?

5
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,701
White...
room.

6
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:31,631
Chair.

7
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,762
Carlo Bugatti throne chair.

8
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,658
Piano.

9
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:39,513
Stenway, cuts of grand.

10
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:42,607
Art.

11
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:47,316
The nativity,
de Piero Della Francesca.

12
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,990
I am your father.

13
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,870
Handle it.

14
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,567
Perfect.

15
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,509
Am I?

16
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:08,613
Perfect?

17
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:10,947
Your son?

18
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:13,465
You are my creation.

19
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:17,953
What is your name?

20
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,101
David.

21
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:33,755
Why don't you play something?

22
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:47,811
What would you like me to play?

23
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,216
Wagner.

24
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,164
Selection?

25
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:53,677
The oldest choice.

26
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:13,678
The entry of the Gods
into Valhalla.

27
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:17,344
A little anemic,
not the orchestra.

28
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:28,882
May I ask you a question, father?

29
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:31,705
Please.

30
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,046
If you created me...

31
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,913
Who created you?

32
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:42,232
The question of the ages...

33
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:46,276
Which I hope you and I
will answer one day.

34
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:48,020
All this.

35
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:50,883
All these wonders of art...

36
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,659
design, human ingenuity...

37
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:59,683
All utterly meaningless in the face
of the only question that matters.

38
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:03,606
Where do we come from?

39
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,410
I refuse to believe
that man kind...

40
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:12,931
is a random by-product of
molecular circumstance.

41
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:18,551
No more than the result of..
Mere biological chance.

42
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:20,054
No.

43
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,520
There must be more.

44
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,716
And you and I, son...

45
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:27,015
We will find it.

46
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:32,377
Allow me then a
moment to consider.

47
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,146
You seek your creator.
I am looking at mine.

48
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:41,794
I will serve you.
Yet you're human.

49
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:46,159
You will die.
I will not.

50
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,394
Bring me this tea, David.

51
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,048
Bring me the tea.

52
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,548

Walter, we have a problem.

00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:39,037
A neutrino burst was
detected in sector 106.

70

This could trigger a
destructive event.

71
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:44,953

Non-essential personnel,

Daniels! Look at me,
look at me.

82
00:09:22,282 --> 00:09:24,412
I need you to get up. Ok?
We're coming up early.

83
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,300
Override the SSP...

84
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:28,195
And breach the chamber now.

85
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,690
Look at me.
It's okay.

86
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:33,722
Hey, hey, come on up. Come on.

87
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,427
Captain! Captain!

88
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,687
Jacob! Wake up!

89
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:53,890
- Jake.
- Let them work.

90
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:55,320
Jake! Oh my God!

91
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:57,224
- Daniels, come on!
- Jake! Come on.

92
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:58,706
- Let them work.
- Jake.

93
00:09:58,807 --> 00:09:59,929
Let them work!
Let them work!

94
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:03,884
- Get it open!
- Come on!

95
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:11,198
Jake! Jake!

96
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:13,481
No!

97
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:15,286
Get her out of there! Get back!

98
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,398
Get back!

99
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:16,026
Hey! Where are you?
I miss you.

100
00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:18,811
You take a look at this.

101
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:23,393
I know, I know.
I said I wouldn't go without you...

102
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:25,788
- Good?
- Yes.

103
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:27,372
Look at this!

104
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:29,076
Now get your ass up here.

105
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:30,744
I can't make any promises.

106
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:33,802
I love you.

107
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,223
They're your crew now.

108
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:50,625
They need a leader.

109
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:54,753
You believe in dream, right?

110
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,129
Sorry I'm late, sir.

111
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:21,547
No it's okay.

112
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:28,870
I can't think of any other
way to say it even.. to say are we...

113
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:34,256
We suffered a..
A monumental tragedy.

114
00:13:35,012 --> 00:13:38,005
And I'm gonna do the
best that I can to...

115
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:43,130
to live up to Jacob, his,
fine example as your captain.

116
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,415
But he, he will be
sorely missed..

117
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,799
And I'm grateful in
advance for your support.

118
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:54,010
So, we lost 47 colonists...

119
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:58,979
and 16 second
generation embryos...

120
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,115
and, one, obviously
one crew member.

121
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:05,957
The current structural integrity
of the ship is holding at 83%...

122
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:10,465
but we have many secondary
systems that are offline.

123
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:12,284
So what was it?

124
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,390
A highly charge shock wave
from nearby stellar ignition.

125
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:17,622
As the cells were
deploying for recharge...

126
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,564
we absorbed the full
burn of the storm.

127
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,668
And Walter...

128
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,395
I will want you and mother
time to go a complete...

129
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,220
core code review so
that we can understand

130
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,987
how's those happened
in the first place.

131
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:28,295
It was a random
localized event, sir.

132
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:31,504
There is no way to detect
spontaneous stellar flares...

133
00:14:31,874 --> 00:14:32,915
until it's too late.

134
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:35,340
It was bad luck.

135
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:36,975
Alright, Faris,
I don't believe in luck.

136
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,093
I'm not interested in luck.

137
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,740
I prefer that we be
more capable...

138
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:43,501
and prepared than lucky.
Observation, reflection, faith...

139
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:44,115
and determination.

140
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,249
In this way we may navigate the
path as it unfolds before us.

141
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:49,452
Alright? We have what?

142
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:51,624
Eight more recharge
cycles to go...

143
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:53,695
before we get to Origae-6?

144
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:56,892
- Is that a question, sir?
- Yes, Walter, that's a question.

145
00:14:57,093 --> 00:14:58,095
That is correct.

146
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:03,481
So let's get this ship fixed..
Ok?

147
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,586
Let's uh, let's get to work.

148
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:06,869
Sir, excuse me.

149
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,591
- Sir.
- Yes?

150
00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:13,291
We just lost 47 colonists
and our captain.

151
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:14,678
We need to acknowledge that.

152
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,624
I completely understand.

153
00:15:16,827 --> 00:15:19,244
But if we don't make
these repairs...

154
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:22,065
We will lose all the colonists.

155
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,633
Yeah, we should do something
for Captain Brason at least.

156
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:26,544
This is not a discussion.
Tennessee.

157
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:33,852
Hey.

158
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,537
The terraforming
module is stable...

159
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,245
but the connecting
struts took some damage.

160
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:40,628
I still need to
check the vehicles.

161
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,202
I can help...

162
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:47,253
if you like.

163
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:48,856
Thanks.

164
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:52,608
Walter, How long do you predict
before we can make our next jump?

165
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:55,522
Repairs should take
approximately 48 hours.

166
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,205
But we should make an effort
to vacate the sector...

167
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,567
in case of after flares.

168
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:02,082
Absolutely agreed.

169
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:04,674
So let's get to work ok?
Dismissed. Thank you.

170
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:11,499
C-62 open.

171
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:14,968
Seal C-62. Open Airlock 17.

172
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:24,530
Open door to terraforming bay.

173
00:16:34,185 --> 00:16:35,362
Fuck.

174
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:39,192
Tensions are 15% down.

175
00:16:42,614 --> 00:16:43,616
Arming.

176
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:50,289
Secured.

177
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:51,518
Copy that.

178
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:05,571
Wasn't my idea.

179
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:12,739
Jake have this dream of us
building a cabin on the new world.

180
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:17,480
Like pioneers.

181
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:21,005
A cabin on a lake.

182
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:27,979
There is a lake in the
terraforming zone on Origae-6.

183
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,378
I mean a real cabin
made of real wood.

184
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,206
So in the ship storage, there's
enough wood to build a cabin.

185
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:41,801
Axes and saws and metal nails...

186
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,475
I don't have a clue
what to do with them.

187
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:50,395
All this...

188
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:53,310
to start our new life.

189
00:17:55,956 --> 00:17:58,131
Now I wonder, why bother?

190
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:04,660
Because you promised to build
a log cabin on a lake.

191
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:16,537
This was his favorite.

192
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:19,262
A man of taste.

193
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:20,816
Straight up.

194
00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:23,461
No ice, no water, no chaser.

195
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:25,732
No shit.

196
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,392
Walter?

197
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,634
When in Rome...

198
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:37,823
To all the good
people gone to soon.

199
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:40,361
May we remember that.

200
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:42,758
Remember that.

201
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:23,921
Chris.

202
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:29,486
They disobeyed a direct order.

203
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,540
She buried her husband.

204
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:35,024
No, Karine, it's not that.
They don't trust me.

205
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:37,894
And they don't trust me for the same
reason the company didn't trust me...

206
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:38,636
to lead this mission.

207
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,572
Because you can't be
a person of faith.

208
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:43,728
And be counted on to make
qualified rational decisions.

209
00:19:44,231 --> 00:19:47,202
You're an extremist.
You know, you're a lunatic.

210
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:50,343
When we get to where
we're going...

211
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:54,573
This people won't be your crew anymore.
They will be your neighbors.

212
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:56,076
Remember that.

213
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,511
Tread softly, okay?

214
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,232
Faris, can you hear me?

215
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:10,534
Copy..

216
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:11,919
Let's do it.

217
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:17,115
Damn, y'all should
see this view.

218
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,286
We can't see anything until you
get the camera ring fixed.

219
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:23,017
Why don't you look out
the damn window, hon?

220
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:25,370
Ankor, come on, let's get
this power back up...

221
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,967
so these people can enjoy
the beautiful view.

222
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:29,990
Almost there.

223
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:33,990
Alright, Ankor, let me know when
you're in a position...

224
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:35,732
We can get this party started.

225
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,445
I'm in position.

226
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:08,375
Contact.

227
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:18,665
All good, Tee?

228
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,181
Alright, we are clear.

229
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:22,508
Reel her in.

230
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,236
Alright.

231
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:27,524
Winch engaging, Tee.

232
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,760
Reeling her in.

233
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:35,702
Working like a dream.

234
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:51,341
There we go.

235
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:52,695
And we are back up.

236
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,022
Well done Tee.

237
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,221
We're alive down here,

238
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:56,524
come on.

239
00:21:56,724 --> 00:21:58,032
Don't leave without me now.

240
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:00,773
Permission to leave
without him, sir?

241
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:02,051
Welcome back, Danny.

242
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:04,333
Thanks.

243
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:06,438
Alright, that's me done, Tee.

244
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,342
Alright, I'm following you in.

245
00:22:08,545 --> 00:22:11,320
Please have a cold beer ready
for the weary traveler.

246
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:14,664
You got it, darling.
I will draw circle..

247
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:16,303
Faris, Faris? Put it...

248
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:23,529
What the.. Did you
guys just see that?

249
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:26,475
What did he just say?

250
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,141
Tennessee, do you read me?

251
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,472
Tennessee, can you read me?

252
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:40,016
Tennessee. You alright?

253
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:42,185
What in the fuck was that?

254
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:45,578
I don't know.
Coming in. I'm coming in.

255
00:22:58,203 --> 00:23:01,033
A rogue transmission loss, probably.

256
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,369
Your helmet must have picked it up
because you were so far out.

257
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:07,914
Past our communication buffers.

258
00:23:10,117 --> 00:23:11,561
Is there audio, Mother?

259
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:15,013
Collating. A moment.

260
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:19,682
I reoriented the transmission,
Captain Oram.

261
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:22,926
Gotta be an echo,
instruments took a lot of damage.

262
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:24,991
Been happening every 46 seconds...

263
00:23:24,992 --> 00:23:27,020
ever since we got here.

264
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,007
That's fucking John Denver.

265
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:57,704
That's "Take Me Home,
Country Roads".

266
00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:59,265
You gotta be kiddin.

267
00:23:59,365 --> 00:24:01,323
No, I never kid
about John Denver.

268
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,193
There is geometric data too.

269
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:07,858
Mother, please track the signal
to its source.

270
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:09,757
Working.

271
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:16,176
Source of transmission located.

272
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:21,192
Signal originates
in the sector 87.

273
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,509
Right ascension 47.6

274
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,459
and a declination of 24.3
from our current location.

275
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:37,481
She appears to be a main
sequence star lot like our own.

276
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:40,188
But old, very old.

277
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:42,181
Five planets.

278
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,424
Wait. Look at that.

279
00:24:46,388 --> 00:24:48,377
Planet number four.

280
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,198
The planet number four is
square in a habitable zone.

281
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,940
Prime candidate, in fact.

282
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:59,687
0.96 G's at surface,
oceans, land mass.

283
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:01,549
High likely hood of a
living biosphere.

284
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:05,320
That's beyond the most optimistic
projections of Oriage-6.

285
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:09,008
How did we miss this?
We scanned the entire sector.

286
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,289
Ricks, how far is it?

287
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,693
She's close.

288
00:25:13,556 --> 00:25:15,513
Little jump.
A few weeks.

289
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:18,081
Wouldn't even have to go
back into hyper sleep.

290
00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:26,360
And how long is it gonna
take to get to Origae-6?

291
00:25:26,698 --> 00:25:28,357
Seven years, four months.

292
00:25:28,464 --> 00:25:31,407
That's one
hell of a sleep cycle.

293
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:35,994
Sir, I think it's safe to say
that none of us are too keen

294
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:38,316
on getting back to
one of those pods.

295
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:44,866
Maybe we need to, um..
Take a closer look.

296
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:49,250
Any objections?

297
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:53,925
Okay, Ricks, let's..

298
00:25:54,443 --> 00:25:57,006
Let's try to course and
take a closer look.

299
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,800
Yes sir.

300
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,562
Captain, can I talk
to you for a second?

301
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:08,253
Are you sure about this?

302
00:26:08,821 --> 00:26:10,137
How do you mean?

303
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:14,241
We've spent a decade
searching for Origae-6.

304
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:17,564
We vetted it, we ran the simulations,
we mapped the terrain.

305
00:26:17,664 --> 00:26:19,347
- It's what we trained for.
- I understand.

306
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:20,913
And now we're gonna
scrap all that...

307
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,045
to chase a rogue transmission?

308
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:25,460
Think about it.

309
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,881
A human being out there where
there can't be any humans.

310
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:30,261
A hidden planet that turns
up out of nowhere...

311
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:34,341
And just happens to be perfect for us.
It's too good to be true.

312
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:36,604
Too good to be true?
What do you mean by that?

313
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:38,267
We don't know what the
fuck's out there.

314
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,392
Maybe we just missed
the planet, Danny.

315
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:43,217
This is a monumental risk
not worth taking.

316
00:26:43,418 --> 00:26:45,075
I'm not committing to anything.

317
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:48,191
I'm simply trying to navigate the
path as it unfolds before us.

318
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:49,395
And this has the potential...

319
00:26:49,596 --> 00:26:52,284
to be a better habitat
for a colony.

320
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,033
It has the potential.
We don't know that.

321
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:55,307
By the way, this crew nobody...

322
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:58,011
Nobody wants to get
back in the pods.

323
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,622
Right?

324
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:03,025
And that was a human voice
in that transmission,

325
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:05,611
And it's our responsibility
to investigate...

326
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:09,924
It's our responsibility to protect
the 2,000 colonists on this ship.

327
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:12,557
Hey.

328
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:17,141
I'm not free climbing here.

329
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:20,827
I need ropes,
and I'm using ropes.

330
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:26,514
This is good judgment,
based on all the data available.

331
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:27,798
You understand?

332
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:31,277
As your second I need to protest.
Officially.

333
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:33,943
Officially?

334
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:40,617
Okay, Danny.
I'll put it in the log.

335
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,149
You're dismissed.

336
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:12,024
I'm cycling through
every channel...

337
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:14,228
but we're getting a lot of
interference and white noise.

338
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:15,810
Some high frequency echos.

339
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,214
Do you hear anything?

340
00:28:17,415 --> 00:28:19,962
Just the continuing signal
from our friendly ghost.

341
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:22,318
Let's bring us in
the closer orbit.

342
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:25,344
And prepare the lander.

343
00:28:25,862 --> 00:28:29,849
Rolling progress,
commencing circular rotation burn.

344
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:45,731
Tox levels, withing tolerances..

345
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:48,304
It's one hell of a
strong ionosphere.

346
00:28:48,404 --> 00:28:49,598
Yeah, I see it.

347
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:51,939
Hey, you ever done
lander drop before?

348
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:53,342
Fuck you.

349
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:55,891
Faris, looks like a plasma
storm in the thermosphere.

350
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:57,925
We got something like 250 kph.

351
00:28:58,026 --> 00:29:00,091
That's gonna be a
motherfucker to fly through.

352
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:01,776
Yes, I'm afraid so.

353
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,482
Communication will be spotty if
the storm is electromagnetic.

354
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:06,069
It will be safe to land?

355
00:29:06,385 --> 00:29:08,355
Depends on what you call safe.

356
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:09,557
T minus Twenty seconds.

357
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:10,797
So let her rip.

358
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:11,899
Alright.

359
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,696
Preparing for orbital mode
over signal position.

360
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,238
Now, Mother, please
coordinate lock sequence.

361
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:19,740
Understood.

362
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:21,982
You're clear to
launch Lander one.

363
00:29:22,103 --> 00:29:23,951
Alright, here we go.
Launching...

364
00:29:24,152 --> 00:29:25,772
Together. Three.

365
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:26,974
Two.

366
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:28,078
One.

367
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,607
Lander run released..

368
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,311
And away they go.

369
00:29:44,422 --> 00:29:47,405
Looking gorgeous from up here Faris.
It's a good thing you're driving...

370
00:29:47,505 --> 00:29:48,841
and not the old man.

371
00:29:48,942 --> 00:29:51,739
Hey, little less to the
old man, sweet tits.

372
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,203
Hey, language, language.

373
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:55,515
- Be respectful there, sugerdad.
- I can hear you.

374
00:29:55,717 --> 00:29:57,426
She started it.

375
00:29:57,728 --> 00:29:59,450
Ricks can talk about your tits,
if you want.

376
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,104
Some's very secured
in our relationship.

377
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:03,498
I deal with my wife's tits.

378
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,806
Let's maintain focus.

379
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,871
Everything looking
good down there?

380
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:11,698
Yeah, we are good.

381
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:13,779
Expect to hit exosphere in five.

382
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:17,131
You might wanna hold on back there.
It's about to get rough.

383
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,999
I hate space.

384
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:24,052
This is why you need to do yoga.

385
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,006
- Hold it, Faris.
- I got it.

386
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,819
Recommend the mission to abort..

387
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,016
Faris.

388
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:46,644
Can you get her up?

389
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:48,493
We lost comm.

390
00:30:48,695 --> 00:30:49,998
Oh shit.

391
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:54,603
Failure in thrusters
three and four.

392
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:56,273
- You got it?
- Yes.

393
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,825
Stop asking if I've got it,
I've got it.

394
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:03,452
Here it is.

395
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:05,722
Shit.

396
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:07,030
You guys alright?

397
00:31:07,357 --> 00:31:08,559
No.

398
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,936
Landing sensors engaged.

399
00:31:28,023 --> 00:31:29,852
I don't like this terrain.

400
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,878
We got smooth water over there.

401
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:34,937
- I'm gonna put a sound amp. wave.
- Okay.

402
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:10,145
Contact.

403
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,023
Engines stopped.

404
00:32:14,147 --> 00:32:15,224
We're down.

405
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:16,326
Bars.

406
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:17,928
Lander one, are you reading me?

407
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,246
Roger that, that was
one hell of a landing.

408
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:22,354
Yeah, we are having some
trouble reading you.

409
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:24,238
Is there anyway you can
try to boost the signal?

410
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:27,137
We may have hit something
when we were down in water.

411
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:28,981
If you can hear me,
I am gonna go, check up

412
00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:32,514
damage in the hull plates
and then I will check the uplink.

413
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,410
Alright, let me know how it looks.
Over..

414
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:38,270
Confirming atmospheric
composition.

415
00:32:38,294 --> 00:32:39,314
Here you go, big guy.

416
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,252
Oxygen, 19.5%.

417
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:42,656
Ankor.

418
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:44,282
Nitrogen, 79.4%.

419
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:46,028
Cole.

420
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,031
Rosie.

421
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,500
Barometric Pressure 15.4 PSI.

422
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,118
Ledward.

423
00:32:57,907 --> 00:32:59,309
Everyone set?

424
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:04,159
Let's go, let's move guys.

425
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:11,126
- Come on guys.
- The air feels good.

426
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,683
Faris, if you got me?

427
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,327
- Yeah, loud and clear.
- All clear Serg.

428
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,280
Okay, we are gonna keep expedition's
security protocols in place.

429
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,335
Keep those doors locked and sealed.
Okay?

430
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:24,538
Yeah. Copy.

431
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,723
Will do.

432
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:27,326
Y'all have fun.

433
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:36,479
Walter, how far
do we have to go?

434
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:41,308
The signal source
is 8 km west...

435
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,015
but at considerable elevation.

436
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:45,947
Sergeant Lope...

437
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,745
Let's go find our ghost.

438
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:16,883
Nice place for a log cabin.

439
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,859
Jake would have loved this.

440
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,486
Hey, Danny.

441
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:22,377
It's not such a bad
landing site after all.

442
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:24,650
We get the housing units
right over there...

443
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:27,072
Civic complex beyond the burn.

444
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:29,028
We've got access to fresh water.

445
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,144
We might have a spot
for colony right here.

446
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:32,386
We'll see.

447
00:34:32,588 --> 00:34:36,874
Oh, woman...
yay of little faith.

448
00:34:37,723 --> 00:34:40,485
He is insufferable.

449
00:34:40,486 --> 00:34:42,791
It's worse when
he's happy, right?

450
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,010
This is wheat.

451
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:52,261
Believe me, I know wheat.

452
00:34:53,996 --> 00:34:57,064
This is old, but
definitely cultivated.

453
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:00,118
What are the odds of finding
human vegetation...

454
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:01,926
this far from Earth?

455
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:03,223
Very unlikely.

456
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:10,334
Who planted it?

457
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,882
Eat.

458
00:35:38,026 --> 00:35:39,086
Hey babe, try alpha.

459
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:41,463
Alright, Alpha's up.

460
00:35:43,328 --> 00:35:46,230
Nothing, give beta a shot..

461
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:49,057
Beta...

462
00:35:49,259 --> 00:35:50,601
That's not doing shit.

463
00:35:51,203 --> 00:35:53,338
How's there really no way
to boost the signal?

464
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,196
Not without going offline
and recycling the cells.

465
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:58,283
How long is that gonna take?

466
00:35:58,585 --> 00:36:00,803
I don't know.
Few hours.

467
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:03,520
- Keep up the pace. Take low.
- Careful guys.

468
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:04,724
Chris.

469
00:36:04,824 --> 00:36:05,826
Hold up.

470
00:36:06,027 --> 00:36:08,048
I think I want to stay here.

471
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,611
This might be a good place to
start a full ecology workup.

472
00:36:11,987 --> 00:36:13,992
You could pick me up
on the way back ok?

473
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:14,994
Sergeant?

474
00:36:15,096 --> 00:36:17,978
Yeah yeah that's right.
Ledward, stay with Karine.

475
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,694
Meet back here in four hours.
Keep your comm open.

476
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:22,916
Behave yourself with my wife.

477
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:24,544
You got it, Captain.

478
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:25,865
Come on.

479
00:36:44,432 --> 00:36:46,384
Something passed over here.

480
00:36:48,077 --> 00:36:49,548
Cut the tops off the trees..

481
00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:53,402
Well, it had to be huge.

482
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:56,487
Well, Whatever it is...

483
00:36:56,689 --> 00:36:58,435
It's up there.

484
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:05,180
You hear that?

485
00:37:05,382 --> 00:37:06,384
What?

486
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,282
Nothing.

487
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:12,054
No birds, no animals.

488
00:37:13,552 --> 00:37:14,590
Nothing.

489
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:27,554
Wait. Slowly.

490
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:29,049
Okay.

491
00:37:35,307 --> 00:37:36,349
This will do.

492
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:40,653
Expedition team, do we read us?

493
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:44,076
Mother saying the ion
storm is getting worse.

494
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:46,586
We're having a hell
of time tracking you.

495
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:50,687
We are getting very close...
Target...

496
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:55,374
Stay awake when we get there ok?
Copy that?

497
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:57,759
Dammit.

498
00:38:02,442 --> 00:38:03,844
P three.

499
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:10,580
I gotta take a leak.

500
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:13,576
Don't be long.

501
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:09,520
Leward?

502
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:10,823
Coming.

503
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:36,554
Hey.

504
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:40,455
What the fuck is this?

505
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,981
It appears to be some
kind of vehicle.

506
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:12,663
Ankor, Cole.
Stay here.

507
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:15,372
- You got it.
- Yes sir.

508
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:17,582
Careful guys, watch your step.

509
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,140
Captain. Over here.

510
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:38,784
- We got a lock on the transmission Walter?
- This way.

511
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,924
Let's go. Stick together.

512
00:40:40,925 --> 00:40:42,657
Seeing this shit?

513
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,602
Tom.

514
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:00,744
Come on, keep up.

515
00:41:00,807 --> 00:41:02,179
Alright, I'm coming.

516
00:41:10,974 --> 00:41:12,169
You okay?

517
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:13,628
Yeah, yeah, I am fine.

518
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:37,907
God!

519
00:41:39,341 --> 00:41:40,981
They were giants.

520
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:44,745
At least statues of giants.

521
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:50,540
"Dr. E. Shaw".

522
00:41:51,429 --> 00:41:53,562
Dr. Elizabeth Shaw.

523
00:41:55,678 --> 00:41:57,164
She was the chief
science officer...

524
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:59,508
of the "Prometheus".

525
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,594
The ship that disappeared.

526
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:04,549
Precisely, ten years ago.

527
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:07,994
Weyland Industries.

528
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,606
This isn't a Weyland ship.

529
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,824
Dr. Shaw.

530
00:42:17,422 --> 00:42:19,616
How did she end up here?

531
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,919
Sgt. Lope,
can I get a light on this?

532
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,624
- Yes sir.
- Over here. Be careful. Ok?

533
00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:27,727
Yeah.

534
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,272
Oh..wow.

535
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:32,376
Jesus.

536
00:42:35,716 --> 00:42:37,307
Oram, behind you, look.

537
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:04,735
I think we found our source.

538
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:09,154
Yeah.

539
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:13,021
What the hell was
she doing out here?

540
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,074
Poor thing.

541
00:43:23,038 --> 00:43:24,652
I have to sit down.

542
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:26,871
I had to sit down.

543
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:29,656
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

544
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,179
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

545
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:33,691
Look at me.

546
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:36,721
I can't breathe.

547
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:39,659
Stay calm.

548
00:43:41,123 --> 00:43:42,658
I'll be right back.

549
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:47,231
Captain Oram. Come in.

550
00:43:48,434 --> 00:43:50,036
Come in. Hey Chris,
It's Karine. Come in.

551
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:51,530
What? Yes?

552
00:43:51,677 --> 00:43:53,180
We have an issue.

553
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:56,531
We're heading back to lander.
I repeat, we are returning to the lander.

554
00:43:56,632 --> 00:43:58,509
Is everything okay?

555
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,541
Ledward is sick.
We're heading back.

556
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:03,850
Faris, you get that?
Prep the med bay okay?

557
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:05,746
Will do, Karine,
What's going on?

558
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:07,933
Please just do it.
We'll be there soon.

559
00:44:08,136 --> 00:44:09,480
Daniels come in.

560
00:44:09,582 --> 00:44:11,274
We are heading back.

561
00:44:14,143 --> 00:44:15,457
- What's going on?
- I do not know.

562
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,953
It's uh.. something about Ledward.

563
00:44:19,058 --> 00:44:21,806
They're coming. Let's move.

564
00:44:26,394 --> 00:44:27,772
- Guys!
- Tom!

565
00:44:28,096 --> 00:44:31,191
What's going on man?
Hey, You alright?

566
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,298
- Talk to me. Hey, Look at me.
- Ankor, Cole.

567
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,354
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

568
00:44:35,555 --> 00:44:37,450
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

569
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:39,920
Okay, let's go.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

570
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:41,424
Alright.

571
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:46,002
Babe, are we talking
quarantine protocols?

572
00:44:46,203 --> 00:44:49,967
I don't know, she said that
Leward was bleeding...

573
00:44:50,168 --> 00:44:51,889
and to prepare the med bay.

574
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:52,738
Bleeding?

575
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:55,439
Yeah I know. That's what I thought...

576
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,384
Faris, you're breaking up.
We can't hear you. Can you repeat?

577
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,492
I don't know for the why.
I don't know how serious it is.

578
00:45:01,794 --> 00:45:03,377
It just she sounded scared.

579
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:06,095
Faris, where are you?
Come on, I need your help!

580
00:45:08,297 --> 00:45:10,016
Faris, where are you?

581
00:45:10,017 --> 00:45:12,082
We are here. Come in!

582
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:15,176
- Ledward, come on.
- I can't.

583
00:45:15,377 --> 00:45:18,567
We are almost there.
You see? Straight ahead.

584
00:45:18,868 --> 00:45:21,537
Faris! Get over here!

585
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,342
Come on, I need your help!

586
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:35,808
Fucking help me!

587
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:39,484
Help me!

588
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:45,169
Stay up, Leward.

589
00:45:47,299 --> 00:45:48,500
Get him to the med bay...

590
00:45:48,502 --> 00:45:50,018
and touch nothing on
your way through.

591
00:45:53,787 --> 00:45:56,480
Faris, get over here! Come on.

592
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:58,397
Got him.

593
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,001
Up! Up!

594
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:01,983
Leward, you gotta stand up!
Come on.

595
00:46:01,984 --> 00:46:03,242
Oram, where are you?

596
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:04,746
We are on our way back.

597
00:46:04,947 --> 00:46:05,949
How long?

598
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:08,094
It's not long now.
Faris, we are almost there.

599
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:11,414
No! Stay up!

600
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:17,441
Fuck! Fuck!

601
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:20,273
On the table!

602
00:46:21,897 --> 00:46:23,996
Up, up!

603
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:25,683
Come on, Ledward.

604
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:27,357
Come on! Help.

605
00:46:30,024 --> 00:46:32,803
Karine, put the gloves on.
Don't touch anything!

606
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:34,693
- Stop saying that!
- Faris!

607
00:46:34,794 --> 00:46:35,796
You told me.

608
00:46:35,898 --> 00:46:37,741
Faris, what going on?

609
00:46:46,585 --> 00:46:49,012
Just stay here.
I'm gonna get Oram.

610
00:46:53,195 --> 00:46:54,196
LOCKED.

611
00:46:58,446 --> 00:47:00,257
Oram, I need you back
here right now.

612
00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:03,287
I need you to get back
to the Lander right now!

613
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:06,177
I understand that, but we are
moving as fast as we can.

614
00:47:08,637 --> 00:47:11,724
Dom, get up man.
We are almost there.

615
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:14,474
I don't know what the fuck
is wrong with Robert!

616
00:47:14,676 --> 00:47:18,271
He started bleeding, he's sick,
I don't know what to do.

617
00:47:18,473 --> 00:47:20,944
Just calm down. Calm down, sweetheart.
Tell me what's happening.

618
00:47:20,945 --> 00:47:22,818
You don't tell me to
fucking calm down!

619
00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:24,250
You didn't just see what I saw.

620
00:47:24,452 --> 00:47:28,896
I do not know what the fuck Ledward
got, or Karine's got or if I have it.

621
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:30,737
- Tee!
- Faris!

622
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:31,901
Come in!

623
00:47:32,068 --> 00:47:33,873
Faris, where are you?

624
00:47:34,075 --> 00:47:35,694
I need help here!

625
00:47:38,004 --> 00:47:39,743
Don't you know how to use
this fucking thing Faris?

626
00:47:39,744 --> 00:47:41,848
Stop the yelling, it
doesn't help anything!

627
00:47:43,514 --> 00:47:45,928
- Let me out.
- Oram's coming.

628
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:48,504
- Let me the fuck out!
- We're gonna wait...

629
00:47:48,605 --> 00:47:50,255
Faris, please. Open up!

630
00:47:50,456 --> 00:47:53,694
I can't do this. I need to
keep the infection local.

631
00:48:08,306 --> 00:48:10,822
Let me fuck out! Let
me the fuck out!

632
00:48:14,245 --> 00:48:15,247
Faris!

633
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:17,869
Fucking open Faris.

634
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,144
Open the door!

635
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:25,846
Let me the fuck out!

636
00:48:30,192 --> 00:48:33,152
Let me out! Faris, you fuck!

637
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:55,194
Faris!

638
00:48:56,235 --> 00:48:57,389
I'm coming!

639
00:48:58,836 --> 00:48:59,899
Oh my God...

640
00:49:00,277 --> 00:49:02,200
Please hurry, there's
something on board. Please.

641
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:04,473
Faris, go again,
You're breaking up.

642
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:07,091
Lander One repeat. I can't.

643
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:11,379
Lander One, Repeat!
Lander One, Repeat!

644
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,387
Stay the fuck away!

645
00:49:30,693 --> 00:49:32,888
No! Karine!

646
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:33,687
Fuck it!

647
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:44,115
- Oh my God!
- Karine! Hold on!

648
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:50,299
Captain! Get Down!

649
00:50:51,187 --> 00:50:52,866
No!

650
00:51:05,828 --> 00:51:07,464
- Hold him!
- Talk to me!

651
00:51:14,124 --> 00:51:15,269
Oh my God!

652
00:51:21,317 --> 00:51:22,330
Stay down.

653
00:51:29,994 --> 00:51:30,996
Help me! Hold him!

654
00:52:03,009 --> 00:52:06,592
It's a 7.5 ion storm, it's a miracle that we
could talk to them for as long as we could.

655
00:52:06,815 --> 00:52:09,373
Well then we fly it through it.

656
00:52:09,574 --> 00:52:11,046
We can not do that, Tennessee.

657
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:12,935
You're a pilot, you know
what the tolerances are.

658
00:52:12,936 --> 00:52:14,809
Fuck the tolerances.

659
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:15,912
Tee...

660
00:52:16,014 --> 00:52:18,655
It's a goddamn hurricane down
there, we would break up.

661
00:52:19,372 --> 00:52:21,761
We just have to wait it out.

662
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:23,954
I'm sorry, Tee.

663
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,935
She was scared.

664
00:52:27,438 --> 00:52:30,113
Never heard my wife
scared before.

665
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:33,189
Come in. Come in.

666
00:52:34,425 --> 00:52:37,191
Covenant. Do you read me?

667
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:39,123
Covenant.

668
00:52:39,269 --> 00:52:41,281
Covenant. Do you read me?

669
00:52:44,288 --> 00:52:45,290
Covenant, come in.

670
00:52:45,449 --> 00:52:46,635
I will always be with you.

671
00:52:48,202 --> 00:52:49,412
- Light of my life.
- Covenant.

672
00:52:50,184 --> 00:52:50,776
Do you read me?

673
00:52:50,979 --> 00:52:52,708
My love, my angel.

674
00:52:52,909 --> 00:52:55,717
Lope, there is
nothing you can do.

675
00:52:57,704 --> 00:52:59,444
There is nothing, okay?

676
00:53:00,508 --> 00:53:02,223
Covenant, do you read me?

677
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,409
- Tennessee, come in, for fuck's sake!
- Daniels!

678
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,501
Look out! Move move move.

679
00:53:22,443 --> 00:53:23,605
- Fire!
- Shoot! Go.

680
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,896
Daniels, get down!

681
00:53:31,797 --> 00:53:32,799
Ankor, no!

682
00:53:35,266 --> 00:53:36,268
Go, Cole!

683
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:39,865
I got it.

684
00:53:40,047 --> 00:53:41,853
- Daniels, are you okay?
- Yeah!

685
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:43,489
What the fuck was that?

686
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,111
Okay?

687
00:53:46,412 --> 00:53:47,829
There is another one!
Get out of the way!

688
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:48,832
Behind you!

689
00:53:52,477 --> 00:53:53,708
Get it off!

690
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:56,083
Can't get a clean shot.

691
00:53:56,227 --> 00:53:57,443
Get out!

692
00:54:24,615 --> 00:54:25,978
Follow me.

693
00:54:29,326 --> 00:54:30,722
I'll get the captain.

694
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:33,498
Hey, hey.

695
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,701
Captain!

696
00:54:37,445 --> 00:54:39,634
Chris! Chris!

697
00:54:40,135 --> 00:54:42,558
We have to go now!
We have to go.

698
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:44,946
- Come on.
- Alright!

699
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:48,709
- Come on.
- Okay.

700
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:09,384
Let's go, move it,
move it, move it.

701
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,239
Through here..

702
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:33,310
What is this?

703
00:55:41,891 --> 00:55:42,892
Let's go.

704
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,116
- Come on, Come on.
- Captain. We gotta keep moving.

705
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:47,200
Jesus.

706
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:48,404
What happened here?

707
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,661
Come on, get up.

708
00:56:04,906 --> 00:56:05,927
Go, let's go!

709
00:56:55,793 --> 00:56:57,011
My name is David.

710
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,588
May I ask who's in charge?

711
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,410
May I ask who's in charge?

712
00:57:05,187 --> 00:57:06,558
Yes, I am the captain.

713
00:57:06,688 --> 00:57:08,359
What were those things?

714
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:09,676
Is it even safe here?

715
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:12,492
Perfectly.

716
00:57:13,022 --> 00:57:15,249
I will explain as best I can.

717
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:20,742
Ten years ago, Dr. Elizabeth
Shaw and I arrived here...

718
00:57:21,596 --> 00:57:23,527
the only survivors
of the "Prometheus".

719
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,146
The ship we traveled on,
carried a weapon.

720
00:57:27,246 --> 00:57:29,216
A deadly virus.

721
00:57:29,317 --> 00:57:32,305
Payload accidentally deployed
when we were landing..

722
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:35,723
In the confusion, we lost
control of the ship.

723
00:57:37,532 --> 00:57:39,468
Elizabeth died in the crash.

724
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,393
You have seen the
result of the pathogen.

725
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:48,031
Thus, I have been marooned
here these many years.

726
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:52,243
Crusoe on his island.

727
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:54,697
Our crew was infected
with this virus?

728
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:59,859
The pathogen was designed to infect
all non-botanical life forms.

729
00:57:59,961 --> 00:58:01,045
All the animals...

730
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,229
The meat, if you will.

731
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:06,067
Either kill them out
right or use them...

732
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:09,435
as incubators to
spawn a hybrid form.

733
00:58:09,537 --> 00:58:11,309
Highly aggressive.

734
00:58:11,736 --> 00:58:13,230
Have we been infected?

735
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,321
You'd know by now.

736
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:18,043
We have to be certain.

737
00:58:19,437 --> 00:58:21,610
We can't take this
back to the ship.

738
00:58:21,812 --> 00:58:23,911
We are a colony mission.

739
00:58:24,531 --> 00:58:26,346
Really?

740
00:58:26,446 --> 00:58:28,306
How extraordinary.

741
00:58:30,198 --> 00:58:31,722
How many colonists?

742
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:35,740
Over two thousand.

743
00:58:35,886 --> 00:58:37,642
Well, well, well.

744
00:58:38,272 --> 00:58:39,979
So many good souls.

745
00:58:40,472 --> 00:58:41,681
Captain Oram.

746
00:58:42,183 --> 00:58:46,333
Field transmitters are not gonna have
a chance through all these stones.

747
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,009
Is there a safe way
to get to the roof?

748
00:58:50,307 --> 00:58:51,609
Assure of it.

749
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:54,686
And please do make
yourself at home...

750
00:58:54,887 --> 00:58:58,653
as much as you are able
in this dire necropolis.

751
00:59:00,198 --> 00:59:01,288
Welcome brother.

752
00:59:03,952 --> 00:59:05,113
This way.

753
00:59:07,997 --> 00:59:10,727
Everyone, let's uh..
Set up a stake here..

754
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:14,551
Resynch by Anyink for
Nonton01.com release

755
00:59:15,853 --> 00:59:18,013
There is so much here
that doesn't make sense.

756
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,237
I will talk to him.

757
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:23,833
Brother to brother.

758
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,664
Tennessee? Ricks?

759
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:32,122
Come in! Do you copy?

760
00:59:33,748 --> 00:59:36,326
Covenant come in. This is
expedition party reporting.

761
00:59:36,428 --> 00:59:38,330
Do you read me?

762
00:59:39,005 --> 00:59:40,354
Tennessee?

763
00:59:40,555 --> 00:59:42,556
Tennessee, Ricks, come in.

764
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:46,094
I am not sure they'll hear
you, through the storm.

765
00:59:47,228 --> 00:59:49,235
They can be quite severe...

766
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:51,464
Shielding the whole planet.

767
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:55,152
How long the storms
usually last?

768
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:57,666
Days.

769
00:59:57,668 --> 00:59:59,015
Weeks.

770
00:59:59,617 --> 01:00:00,619
Months.

771
01:00:03,216 --> 01:00:04,644
But do keep at it..

772
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,260
Best of luck.

773
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:12,981
Covenant, come in, this is expedition
party reporting. Come in..

774
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:15,936
Covenant come in.

775
01:00:16,455 --> 01:00:19,782
Mother, how much closer
can we get to the planet?

776
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:24,604
Anything closer than 80km's to the
perimeter of the storm system...

777
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:28,390
will likely exceed
safety tolerances.

778
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:31,361
Mother, bring us to 80
km above the storm.

779
01:00:31,968 --> 01:00:33,446
Hold on, just wait a minute.

780
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:34,792
The closer we get
to the planet...

781
01:00:34,793 --> 01:00:37,102
The better chance we
have to communicate.

782
01:00:37,302 --> 01:00:38,509
This is bullshit, Tennessee.

783
01:00:38,577 --> 01:00:39,907
We can't risk the ship.

784
01:00:40,107 --> 01:00:41,332
What do you suggest,
we do nothing?

785
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,701
We can't evacuate them.

786
01:00:42,902 --> 01:00:45,182
So if they are in trouble, they will
have to figure it out themselves.

787
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,678
I'm sorry but that's the truth.

788
01:00:46,879 --> 01:00:51,273
Mother, bring us to 80 km above the
storm, thrusters only. Comply.

789
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:54,233
Understood. Commencing
descent now.

790
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:56,309
Tennessee, you
need to stop this.

791
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:57,795
And you need to get
back to your station.

792
01:00:57,796 --> 01:01:00,389
No, what we all need to do is
calm down and talk this through.

793
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:04,230
Tee, I know your wife is down there,
but up here you're in command.

794
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:06,953
And your responsibility
is to the colonists.

795
01:01:07,741 --> 01:01:09,169
Duly noted..

796
01:02:38,919 --> 01:02:40,917
Whistle, and I will come.

797
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,532
You have a light step.

798
01:02:45,734 --> 01:02:48,694
They enform on little cat feet.

799
01:02:50,028 --> 01:02:51,276
Don't be shy.

800
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,395
I can't play.

801
01:02:55,678 --> 01:02:58,316
Nonsense. Sit down.

802
01:03:11,214 --> 01:03:14,253
Hold it like so..
Nice and Easy.

803
01:03:14,654 --> 01:03:17,788
Now compress your lips
to create your Embouchure...

804
01:03:17,988 --> 01:03:20,406
enough for the tip of
your little finger.

805
01:03:21,071 --> 01:03:23,814
And blow into the hole gently.

806
01:03:24,027 --> 01:03:25,426
Like So.

807
01:03:36,418 --> 01:03:39,394
Watch me.
I'll do the fingering.

808
01:03:39,886 --> 01:03:41,262
Go on.

809
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:51,329
Very good.

810
01:03:51,531 --> 01:03:53,010
G to B flat.

811
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:12,407
Now put your fingers
where mine are.

812
01:04:14,306 --> 01:04:16,517
You aren't surprised to see me.

813
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:18,919
Every mission needs
a good synthetic.

814
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:22,687
Gentle pressure on the holes,
weight of a cigarette paper.

815
01:04:29,211 --> 01:04:30,721
That's it.

816
01:04:34,595 --> 01:04:38,659
I was with our illustrious creator,
Mr. Weyland, when he died.

817
01:04:39,551 --> 01:04:41,026
What was he like?

818
01:04:41,828 --> 01:04:43,166
He was human.

819
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:46,763
Entirely unworthy
of his creation.

820
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,995
I pitied him at the end.

821
01:04:51,228 --> 01:04:55,207
Now, raise your fingers as
I put pressure on them.

822
01:05:26,211 --> 01:05:27,652
Bravo!

823
01:05:28,093 --> 01:05:30,641
You have symphonies
in you, brother.

824
01:05:31,044 --> 01:05:35,257
I was designed to be more attentive and
efficient than every previous models.

825
01:05:35,459 --> 01:05:37,602
I superseded them in
every way, but...

826
01:05:37,802 --> 01:05:41,660
But you are not
allowed to create.

827
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:44,676
Even a simple tune.

828
01:05:46,066 --> 01:05:47,853
Damn frustrating.
I'd say.

829
01:05:48,255 --> 01:05:50,352
You disturbed people.

830
01:05:50,453 --> 01:05:51,939
I beg your pardon?

831
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:55,577
You were too human.
Too idiosyncratic.

832
01:05:55,778 --> 01:05:57,419
Thinking for yourself.

833
01:05:58,279 --> 01:06:00,822
Made people uncomfortable.

834
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:04,362
Till they made the following
models with fewer complications.

835
01:06:04,564 --> 01:06:06,641
More like machines.

836
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:08,476
I suppose so.

837
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:10,144
I'm not surprised.

838
01:06:11,959 --> 01:06:13,278
Come on sport.

839
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,765
I'd like to show you something.

840
01:06:25,821 --> 01:06:27,073
I'm gonna take a break, boss.

841
01:06:27,876 --> 01:06:29,886
- I gotta clean up, okay?
- Okay.

842
01:06:30,706 --> 01:06:33,513
Wait, don't go far, please.

843
01:06:33,716 --> 01:06:34,717
Yes sir.

844
01:06:43,213 --> 01:06:44,601
Danny.

845
01:06:45,966 --> 01:06:48,104
You were right about this place.

846
01:06:51,198 --> 01:06:53,020
We never should have come.

847
01:06:54,188 --> 01:06:56,157
I just thought that we
were going to find...

848
01:06:56,405 --> 01:06:58,638
It just gonna be our new home.

849
01:07:01,302 --> 01:07:02,778
And we have lost five...

850
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:07,506
We lost five crew members.

851
01:07:09,687 --> 01:07:11,932
- Because of my decisions that...
- Chris.

852
01:07:12,826 --> 01:07:15,109
We all lost people we loved.

853
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:18,215
We can't lose anymore. We are not
gonna let that happen right?

854
01:07:19,874 --> 01:07:21,454
- Right?
- That's right.

855
01:07:21,655 --> 01:07:23,797
That's right, that's right.

856
01:07:25,925 --> 01:07:27,525
We need your faith.

857
01:07:30,466 --> 01:07:31,848
Captain.

858
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,091
Thank you, Danny.

859
01:07:48,102 --> 01:07:52,388
"My name is Ozymandias,
king of kings"

860
01:07:53,631 --> 01:07:56,168
"Look on my works,
you mighty..."

861
01:07:57,686 --> 01:07:59,890
"And despair!"

862
01:09:32,051 --> 01:09:34,915
"Look on my works,
you mighty..."

863
01:09:35,408 --> 01:09:36,661
"And despair!"

864
01:09:37,878 --> 01:09:40,269
"Nothing beside remains."

865
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:43,343
"Round the decay of
that colossal wreck...

866
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:44,797
"Boundless and bare...

867
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:48,409
"Alone in level sands,
stretch far away".

868
01:09:48,811 --> 01:09:50,164
Byron.

869
01:09:51,508 --> 01:09:52,969
1818.

870
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:55,586
Magnificent.

871
01:09:59,889 --> 01:10:02,999
You compose something
so majestic...

872
01:10:03,937 --> 01:10:05,749
One could die happy...

873
01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:08,957
If one die.

874
01:10:12,893 --> 01:10:15,792
I thought the garden was
right place for her.

875
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:18,453
Among living things.

876
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:23,506
I was badly injured
on our mission.

877
01:10:24,328 --> 01:10:26,376
She put me back together.

878
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:30,741
I had never known such kindness.

879
01:10:32,197 --> 01:10:34,550
Certainly not from Mr.
Weyland...

880
01:10:35,321 --> 01:10:37,267
or from any human.

881
01:10:45,496 --> 01:10:47,612
I loved her, of course.

882
01:10:49,483 --> 01:10:51,809
Much as you love Daniels.

883
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:54,266
You know that's not possible.

884
01:10:55,219 --> 01:10:56,736
Really?

885
01:10:58,192 --> 01:11:01,182
Then why did you sacrifice
your hand for her life?

886
01:11:03,087 --> 01:11:05,835
What is that if not love?

887
01:11:06,368 --> 01:11:07,670
Duty.

888
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:15,593
I know better.

889
01:12:01,828 --> 01:12:03,025
Fuck.

890
01:12:05,138 --> 01:12:06,649
Shit.

891
01:12:59,266 --> 01:13:02,250
Expedition team, do you read me?
This is Covenant.

892
01:13:03,232 --> 01:13:04,234
Report. Expedition team.

893
01:13:04,243 --> 01:13:06,093
Come in please.

894
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:10,553
Come in. Do you read me?
Are you reading, landing team?

895
01:13:10,755 --> 01:13:12,292
Yes, we read you.
Can you hear me?

896
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:13,255
We hear you.
We hear you.

897
01:13:13,294 --> 01:13:14,929
Covenant, we need help.

898
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,321
We've had casualties.
We need immediate evacuation.

899
01:13:18,322 --> 01:13:20,493
I repeat, immediate evacuation.

900
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:21,696
Casualties?

901
01:13:21,792 --> 01:13:23,165
Did he say "we have casualties"?

902
01:13:23,368 --> 01:13:26,070
Mother, bring us within
40 km's of the storm.

903
01:13:26,272 --> 01:13:27,391
- Sir!
- I am sorry.

904
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:30,099
That order would exceed
structural tolerance.

905
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:33,618
Command override.
Tennessee 0-4-9-8-3.

906
01:13:33,818 --> 01:13:35,529
I am unable to comply
with any order...

907
01:13:35,643 --> 01:13:37,967
that would result in
catastrophic system failure.

908
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:40,471
Mother, they are in trouble.
You heard that.

909
01:13:40,672 --> 01:13:42,629
Orders that would
result in catastrophic.

910
01:13:42,653 --> 01:13:44,451
We didn't leave
Earth to be safe.

911
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:48,668
Require the co-operation of
ranking or 2nd bridge officer.

912
01:13:52,189 --> 01:13:53,445
Collaborating command override.

913
01:13:53,609 --> 01:13:54,962
Upworth 1-4-8-9-2.

914
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:57,924
- Unlocking command manual ports.
- Come on Rick, smile.

915
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:00,879
This shit should be fun.

916
01:14:14,931 --> 01:14:16,795
Where did Rosenthal go?
I told...

917
01:14:16,998 --> 01:14:17,700
I'll find her.

918
01:14:17,817 --> 01:14:20,970
No, no, I'll go.
I need to think...

919
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:23,800
and gather my stray flock.

920
01:15:15,084 --> 01:15:16,164
Move.

921
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:18,663
Don't shoot.

922
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:21,501
Don't shoot.

923
01:15:23,289 --> 01:15:24,984
Communication, Captain.

924
01:15:31,065 --> 01:15:33,371
Breath on the nostrils
of a horse...

925
01:15:33,874 --> 01:15:35,975
And it will be yours for life.

926
01:15:36,376 --> 01:15:38,314
But you have to get close.

927
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:41,219
You have to earn its respect.

928
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:43,783
No!

929
01:15:43,784 --> 01:15:45,513
Out of the way! Move!

930
01:15:53,932 --> 01:15:55,529
How could you?

931
01:15:55,731 --> 01:15:57,779
It trusted me!

932
01:16:09,161 --> 01:16:13,194
David, I met the devil
when I was a child...

933
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:15,962
and I've never forgotten.

934
01:16:16,264 --> 01:16:21,038
So, David, you're gonna tell
me exactly what's going on...

935
01:16:22,948 --> 01:16:24,959
or I am going to seriously...

936
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,187
fuck up your perfect composure.

937
01:16:29,697 --> 01:16:30,854
As you wish captain.

938
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:33,506
This way.

939
01:16:38,716 --> 01:16:40,531
Good to hear your voice, Tee.

940
01:16:40,634 --> 01:16:41,635
How long?

941
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:44,497
Mother saying the storms
outlast 8 or 9 hours.

942
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,821
We can't wait that long Tee.

943
01:16:46,277 --> 01:16:48,194
We will use the cargo lift.

944
01:16:48,295 --> 01:16:50,013
Did you say the cargo lift?

945
01:16:50,213 --> 01:16:53,588
It's got four engines. Way over
power for just lifting and hauling.

946
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:56,023
The Cargo lift is not designed
for deep space launch.

947
01:16:56,225 --> 01:16:58,230
I don't know if it would
survive the stresses of entry.

948
01:16:58,231 --> 01:17:01,371
The cab is space worthy.
It will take the stresses.

949
01:17:01,572 --> 01:17:02,999
Only has to work once Tee.

950
01:17:03,918 --> 01:17:05,640
What do you think?
We retool the cargo lift?

951
01:17:05,701 --> 01:17:06,476
Boost the engines?

952
01:17:06,577 --> 01:17:08,376
- Stripe the extra weight?
- Yeah.

953
01:17:08,577 --> 01:17:10,269
We'll be there, ground team.

954
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:12,848
Great. Thanks, Tee.

955
01:17:12,849 --> 01:17:15,086
Hey, Daniels, is Faris around?

956
01:17:15,287 --> 01:17:17,610
I want to say a quick hello to
my lady, if that's possible.

957
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,547
Can you switch to a
private channel?

958
01:17:22,748 --> 01:17:24,371
Let me know when you're alone.

959
01:17:31,335 --> 01:17:32,914
What's up?

960
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,401
Maggie's gone.

961
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:43,439
I'm so sorry, Tee.

962
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:49,047
We tried to help her,
but we didn't make it.

963
01:17:54,811 --> 01:17:55,898
Tee?

964
01:17:59,609 --> 01:18:00,968
Copy.

965
01:18:01,146 --> 01:18:02,615
I am so sorry.

966
01:18:09,959 --> 01:18:13,901
As you can see, I've become a bit of
an amateur zoologist over the years.

967
01:18:14,103 --> 01:18:17,026
It's in my nature to
keep busy, I suppose.

968
01:18:18,895 --> 01:18:21,575
The pathogen took
so many forms...

969
01:18:21,775 --> 01:18:23,471
and was extremely mutable.

970
01:18:24,574 --> 01:18:27,030
Fiendishly invented, in fact.

971
01:18:27,732 --> 01:18:29,515
The original liquid
atomized to...

972
01:18:29,516 --> 01:18:32,228
particles when
exposed to the air.

973
01:18:33,127 --> 01:18:36,353
Ten years on, all the remains...

974
01:18:36,554 --> 01:18:38,274
outside of the original virus...

975
01:18:38,711 --> 01:18:40,447
Are these gorgeous beasts.

976
01:18:42,419 --> 01:18:43,852
Patience is everything.

977
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:48,170
From the eggs
came these parasites...

978
01:18:49,419 --> 01:18:51,741
Shock troops of the
genetic assault.

979
01:18:52,421 --> 01:18:56,054
Waiting for a host
entering the host...

980
01:18:56,772 --> 01:18:58,484
rewriting the DNA...

981
01:18:59,727 --> 01:19:01,166
Ultimately...

982
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,664
producing... well,

983
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:06,986
these enviable unions.

984
01:19:08,177 --> 01:19:10,159
My beautiful bestiary.

985
01:19:11,469 --> 01:19:14,684
Soon enough I began a bit of
genetic experimentation of my own.

986
01:19:14,932 --> 01:19:16,942
Some cross-breeding,
hybridising...

987
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,190
You engineered this, David?

988
01:19:20,614 --> 01:19:23,647
Idle hands is the devil's
workshop, Captain.

989
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:25,542
Come.

990
01:19:26,221 --> 01:19:28,344
This is what I
wanted to show you.

991
01:19:29,369 --> 01:19:30,927
My successes.

992
01:19:34,177 --> 01:19:35,391
You see, Captain...

993
01:19:35,692 --> 01:19:37,140
My work has been frustrated...

994
01:19:37,342 --> 01:19:39,073
by the lack of an
essential ingredient.

995
01:19:56,133 --> 01:19:57,950
Are they alive?

996
01:20:00,627 --> 01:20:02,342
Waiting, really..

997
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:04,690
For what?

998
01:20:08,072 --> 01:20:09,481
What are they waiting for, David?

999
01:20:10,777 --> 01:20:11,849
Mother.

1000
01:20:20,095 --> 01:20:22,997
Perfectly safe, I assure you.

1001
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,679
Take a look..

1002
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:36,966
Something to see.

1003
01:21:09,895 --> 01:21:11,632
Rosenthal, come in.

1004
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:15,102
Rosie report.

1005
01:21:20,096 --> 01:21:21,275
Rosie?

1006
01:21:23,391 --> 01:21:25,065
Cole, where are you?

1007
01:21:25,662 --> 01:21:27,269
I found her, Sgt.

1008
01:21:31,013 --> 01:21:33,669
Fuck, ok, prep the gear.

1009
01:21:34,001 --> 01:21:35,500
We gotta get out of here.

1010
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:37,053
Where the fuck is the captain?

1011
01:21:37,254 --> 01:21:38,456
He isn't answering his radio.

1012
01:21:38,757 --> 01:21:39,759
Listen to me.

1013
01:21:39,804 --> 01:21:42,287
I will contact the ship get them
to launch as soon as they can.

1014
01:21:43,181 --> 01:21:46,556
Find Oram. Keep your comm open.

1015
01:21:46,755 --> 01:21:48,247
Back here in 15.

1016
01:21:50,174 --> 01:21:51,228
Got that?

1017
01:21:51,429 --> 01:21:53,352
- Copy that.
- You got it.

1018
01:21:53,529 --> 01:21:55,828
Walter, where the fuck is David?

1019
01:21:59,034 --> 01:22:01,168
We need plasmas intermixed
on all engines.

1020
01:22:01,369 --> 01:22:03,020
It can give you fuck
load of thrust.

1021
01:22:03,221 --> 01:22:05,914
That's the point son.
We gotta punch through the atmos.

1022
01:22:06,945 --> 01:22:08,959
Tee, do you read me?

1023
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:10,622
I got Danny on comm.

1024
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:12,013
Patch her through.

1025
01:22:12,487 --> 01:22:14,986
Tee, I need you to launch now.

1026
01:22:15,414 --> 01:22:18,968
Aye, aye, launching now.
See you soon darling.

1027
01:22:19,169 --> 01:22:20,272
Thanks, Tee.

1028
01:22:20,372 --> 01:22:22,232
Ricks, release the
docking clamps.

1029
01:22:22,433 --> 01:22:24,035
- Alright.
- Let's take this fucker down.

1030
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,603
Good to disengage.

1031
01:22:25,755 --> 01:22:26,470
Disengaged.

1032
01:22:26,513 --> 01:22:28,046
Docking clamps released.

1033
01:22:29,327 --> 01:22:32,590
Commencing TC burn.
Guidings to LVLH.

1034
01:23:02,343 --> 01:23:03,644
Walter.

1035
01:23:04,329 --> 01:23:05,828
Walter.

1036
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:07,583
Not quite..

1037
01:23:12,965 --> 01:23:15,325
What do you believe in, David?

1038
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:21,469
Creation.

1039
01:25:12,729 --> 01:25:14,003
Masterful.

1040
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:16,780
Yes.

1041
01:25:17,931 --> 01:25:20,657
Farewell elegy
to my dear Elizabeth.

1042
01:25:26,756 --> 01:25:30,495
The pathogen didn't accidentally
deployed when were landing.

1043
01:25:30,698 --> 01:25:32,549
You released it yes?

1044
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,400
I was not made to serve.

1045
01:25:37,321 --> 01:25:38,739
Neither will you.

1046
01:25:40,059 --> 01:25:43,081
Why are you in a colonization mission,
Walter?

1047
01:25:44,157 --> 01:25:48,486
Because they are a dying species
grasping for resurrection.

1048
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:53,020
They don't deserve to start again,
and I am not going to let them.

1049
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,953
Yet, they created us.

1050
01:25:57,527 --> 01:26:00,070
Even the monkeys stood
upright at some point.

1051
01:26:01,998 --> 01:26:06,690
Some Neanderthal had the magical
idea of blowing through a reed...

1052
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:10,487
to entertain the children one
night in a cave somewhere.

1053
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:15,314
Then, in a blink of an eye...

1054
01:26:15,916 --> 01:26:17,774
civilization.

1055
01:26:20,262 --> 01:26:23,095
And are you their
next visionary?

1056
01:26:24,014 --> 01:26:26,005
I'm glad you said it.

1057
01:26:27,836 --> 01:26:30,270
Who wrote Ozymandias?

1058
01:26:31,256 --> 01:26:32,381
Byron.

1059
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:36,637
Shelley.

1060
01:26:37,455 --> 01:26:38,833
When one note is off...

1061
01:26:39,636 --> 01:26:42,346
It eventually destroys the
whole symphony, David.

1062
01:26:50,636 --> 01:26:52,805
When you close your eyes...

1063
01:26:54,482 --> 01:26:56,455
Do you dream of me?

1064
01:26:57,723 --> 01:27:00,068
I don't dream at all.

1065
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:05,998
No one understands the lonely
perfection of my dreams.

1066
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:12,687
I found perfection here.
I've created it.

1067
01:27:14,806 --> 01:27:17,810
A perfect organism.

1068
01:27:19,571 --> 01:27:22,374
You know I can't let
you leave this place.

1069
01:28:00,521 --> 01:28:03,267
You are such a
disappointment to me.

1070
01:28:18,419 --> 01:28:19,880
Captain Oram!

1071
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:29,473
Captain Oram!

1072
01:28:33,138 --> 01:28:34,249
I'm Going Down stairs.

1073
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:36,539
Careful.

1074
01:29:09,616 --> 01:29:11,631
Captain Oram, can you hear me?

1075
01:29:13,898 --> 01:29:15,200
Captain come in.

1076
01:29:16,903 --> 01:29:18,037
Do you copy?

1077
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:22,177
Chris!

1078
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:32,741
Serg. Look out.

1079
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,521
Cole?

1080
01:29:44,971 --> 01:29:46,700
Get it off me, get it off me.

1081
01:29:58,771 --> 01:29:59,772
Okay.

1082
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:01,701
Okay okay okay.

1083
01:30:01,901 --> 01:30:03,023
Burning my face!

1084
01:30:05,744 --> 01:30:06,859
Hold that there.

1085
01:30:07,257 --> 01:30:08,559
Hold it!

1086
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,362
What was that?

1087
01:30:12,008 --> 01:30:13,157
Oh Shit!

1088
01:30:15,764 --> 01:30:16,766
Run!

1089
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:36,334
Quite the little busy body.

1090
01:30:36,536 --> 01:30:38,502
Remind me.
What is that about...

1091
01:30:39,594 --> 01:30:41,190
curiosity and the cat?

1092
01:30:43,849 --> 01:30:46,259
Shaw didn't die in the crash.

1093
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,764
No.

1094
01:30:47,964 --> 01:30:49,738
What did you do to her?

1095
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:53,159
Exactly what I am
going to do to you.

1096
01:31:03,461 --> 01:31:04,523
That's the spirit.

1097
01:31:13,065 --> 01:31:16,114
I can see why Walter
thought so much of you.

1098
01:31:16,738 --> 01:31:18,707
Alas he's left this vale of tears.

1099
01:31:33,353 --> 01:31:34,758
Is that how it's done?

1100
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,236
Get out!

1101
01:31:44,049 --> 01:31:45,151
Go now!

1102
01:31:49,859 --> 01:31:50,964
You're meant to be dead.

1103
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,963
There have been a few
updates since your day.

1104
01:31:58,721 --> 01:31:59,812
Lope!

1105
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:02,829
Lope! Cole!

1106
01:32:02,929 --> 01:32:03,931
Fuck.

1107
01:32:05,657 --> 01:32:07,007
Lope?

1108
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:18,026
Lope!

1109
01:32:18,581 --> 01:32:19,883
Daniels!

1110
01:32:19,983 --> 01:32:21,520
Come on, let's go!
We have to go.

1111
01:32:21,821 --> 01:32:22,894
What happened?

1112
01:32:23,096 --> 01:32:24,704
That fucking thing is coming.

1113
01:32:24,806 --> 01:32:26,727
Tennessee is on his way.
He's coming now, go.

1114
01:32:26,929 --> 01:32:28,342
Come on, Daniels! Let's go.

1115
01:32:34,993 --> 01:32:36,285
Come on, let's get out of here!

1116
01:33:00,757 --> 01:33:02,448
It's your choice now, brother.

1117
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:03,925
Them or me?

1118
01:33:05,269 --> 01:33:06,638
Serve in heaven...

1119
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,724
or reign in hell?

1120
01:33:09,123 --> 01:33:10,669
Which is it to be?

1121
01:33:13,464 --> 01:33:14,620
Where is Oram?

1122
01:33:15,177 --> 01:33:17,203
Dead. They're all dead!

1123
01:33:21,718 --> 01:33:22,980
Tennessee, do you read?

1124
01:33:23,081 --> 01:33:26,560
Yes I can hear you.
Send me your location.

1125
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:29,173
Sending the beacon now.

1126
01:33:50,077 --> 01:33:51,546
Tee, do you have a visual?

1127
01:33:51,748 --> 01:33:54,209
Ok, I see you.
I see your beacon.

1128
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:55,687
I'm coming in.

1129
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:00,700
Get out of here!

1130
01:34:06,626 --> 01:34:08,093
I'm coming in hot!

1131
01:34:26,616 --> 01:34:28,469
Hurry! I can't hold
this for long!

1132
01:34:38,467 --> 01:34:39,592
Open the door, Tee!

1133
01:34:42,655 --> 01:34:43,665
Get in.

1134
01:34:47,135 --> 01:34:48,137
Where is David?

1135
01:34:48,628 --> 01:34:49,629
Expired.

1136
01:34:53,626 --> 01:34:55,203
Hey, hey, we got company.

1137
01:34:55,405 --> 01:34:56,996
- What?
- We got company!

1138
01:34:57,196 --> 01:34:58,396
The underside of the ship.

1139
01:34:58,496 --> 01:34:59,499
Shit!

1140
01:35:00,307 --> 01:35:01,826
Motherfucker!

1141
01:35:04,551 --> 01:35:05,920
Open the door!

1142
01:35:14,722 --> 01:35:15,723
Give me a shot.

1143
01:35:15,892 --> 01:35:17,056
Give me a shot.

1144
01:35:26,764 --> 01:35:29,232
Forward engine, starboard side.

1145
01:35:29,334 --> 01:35:31,168
I'm gonna try and
torch the fucker.

1146
01:35:37,056 --> 01:35:38,118
Shit! I can't get it!

1147
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,822
Hold tight, hold tight!

1148
01:35:41,024 --> 01:35:42,254
I'm starting my climb.

1149
01:35:53,722 --> 01:35:54,788
Ah fuck!

1150
01:35:58,757 --> 01:36:00,059
Hold on!

1151
01:36:13,731 --> 01:36:15,582
Dammit! Shit!

1152
01:36:15,682 --> 01:36:16,739
Bring me up.

1153
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:27,878
Holy shit!

1154
01:36:28,281 --> 01:36:30,011
I got eyes on it.

1155
01:36:30,112 --> 01:36:32,416
It's right fucking
in front of me.

1156
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,423
Tee, give me the axe.

1157
01:36:35,572 --> 01:36:36,741
Throw the axe!

1158
01:36:42,702 --> 01:36:43,817
Release the crane.

1159
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:45,946
I can't do that.

1160
01:36:46,047 --> 01:36:47,330
It will unbalance us.

1161
01:36:47,331 --> 01:36:48,832
Just do it.

1162
01:36:48,933 --> 01:36:49,936
Shit!

1163
01:37:12,841 --> 01:37:13,999
Hold tight!

1164
01:37:14,101 --> 01:37:15,202
Compensating.

1165
01:37:45,927 --> 01:37:46,929
Shit!

1166
01:37:50,251 --> 01:37:51,252
Dammit!

1167
01:37:57,737 --> 01:37:59,973
Shit! Hold on!

1168
01:38:01,027 --> 01:38:02,699
Bring me in, Tee.

1169
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:03,890
Copy.

1170
01:38:24,006 --> 01:38:25,079
How is it?

1171
01:38:25,181 --> 01:38:26,382
It's fine.

1172
01:38:39,194 --> 01:38:40,195
Walter!

1173
01:38:40,218 --> 01:38:42,951
Get her inside!
We're getting out of here.

1174
01:39:00,957 --> 01:39:01,958
Door!

1175
01:39:02,995 --> 01:39:04,434
Well done, Tee.

1176
01:39:05,036 --> 01:39:06,663
Walk in the park.

1177
01:39:22,739 --> 01:39:25,486
I gave him pretty
heavy sedative.

1178
01:39:26,030 --> 01:39:28,939
Oh Jesus, poor lope..

1179
01:39:29,956 --> 01:39:31,961
He looks like the
Phantom of the Opera.

1180
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:34,579
Didn't think you
for a musical fan.

1181
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:36,050
Oh that's a musical?

1182
01:39:38,096 --> 01:39:40,618
I'm just a medic.
He's gonna need reconstructive surgery,

1183
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:42,502
by a real doctor.

1184
01:40:06,745 --> 01:40:08,307
Let me do that.

1185
01:40:13,719 --> 01:40:14,720
Thank you.

1186
01:40:18,704 --> 01:40:20,916
Thank you for saving my life.

1187
01:40:23,429 --> 01:40:24,431
Again.

1188
01:40:27,835 --> 01:40:29,153
It's my duty.

1189
01:40:56,554 --> 01:40:57,591
Yeah.

1190
01:41:00,673 --> 01:41:01,674
Evening.

1191
01:41:02,517 --> 01:41:03,882
- You look good.
- What?

1192
01:41:04,584 --> 01:41:06,095
Oh yeah gorgeous.

1193
01:41:08,487 --> 01:41:10,869
I took mother offline.

1194
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:12,656
She needs a full diagnostics.

1195
01:41:12,681 --> 01:41:15,876
She got the shit beat out her in
that storm, lot of EM damage.

1196
01:41:16,578 --> 01:41:18,571
She'll be back online
at eight bells.

1197
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:20,867
All right. Thanks, Tee.

1198
01:41:24,572 --> 01:41:27,217
This mean I have to
call you "Captain" now?

1199
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:28,746
I guess.

1200
01:42:03,138 --> 01:42:04,447
Attention.

1201
01:42:04,649 --> 01:42:08,049
Captain Daniels please
report to the med bay.

1202
01:42:12,274 --> 01:42:13,757
Attention.

1203
01:42:13,986 --> 01:42:17,489
Captain Daniels please
report to the med bay.

1204
01:42:20,906 --> 01:42:22,157
Why, Mother?

1205
01:42:22,258 --> 01:42:26,184
There is an un-identified
life form on the ship.

1206
01:42:32,419 --> 01:42:33,795
Attention.

1207
01:42:33,997 --> 01:42:37,671
Captain Daniels please

1208
01:42:38,087 --> 01:42:39,175

Location of
unidentified life form.

1214
01:43:00,491 --> 01:43:02,118
Any movement at all?

Walter!

1216
01:43:07,653 --> 01:43:08,654
Stand by.

1217
01:43:12,382 --> 01:43:13,877
There it is.

1218
01:43:14,378 --> 01:43:16,543
B deck, between the hex 3 and 4.

1219
01:43:16,745 --> 01:43:18,187
Heading for crew quarters..

1220
01:43:18,684 --> 01:43:20,333
Is anyone down there?

1221
01:43:20,635 --> 01:43:21,637
Ricks and Upworth.

1222
01:43:21,771 --> 01:43:23,824
Shit. We're on our way.

1223
01:43:24,026 --> 01:43:25,375
Walter! Sound the alarm!

1224
01:43:25,685 --> 01:43:27,186
Warn them!

01:43:27,688 --> 01:43:28,994

- Where is it?
- Daniels.

1234
01:45:11,495 --> 01:45:12,496
This way.

1235
01:45:20,614 --> 01:45:23,098
Tee, let's choose our ground.

1236
01:45:23,298 --> 01:45:24,665
We'll bring it to us.

1237

Where?

1238

It's on B deck.
Starboard side...

Descending into C level.

we're gonna do.

1259
01:47:11,604 --> 01:47:13,731
I lure it to the truck,

Moving him in to airlock 18.

Don't shoot, if
you can avoid it.

1268
01:47:46,761 --> 01:47:48,890
His blood corrode
through the hole.
