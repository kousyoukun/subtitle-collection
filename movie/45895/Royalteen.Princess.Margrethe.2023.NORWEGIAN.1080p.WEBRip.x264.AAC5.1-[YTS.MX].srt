ROYALTEEN
PRINCESS MARGRETHE

4
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,083
No, thank you.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,500
That won't be necessary.

6
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,333
What were you thinking?

7
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,416
Do you realize
what sort of consequences this will have?

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If it gets out.

9
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,333
Not only for you.

10
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,375
For everyone. For the whole family.

11
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,708
Never do this again.

12
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,583
Do you understand?

13
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,041
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

14
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,583
Good.

15
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:20,083
{\an8}MARGRETHE WAS PICKED UP IN AN AMBULANCE!!!

16
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,333
{\an8}ANYONE KNOW WHY?

17
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,833
{\an8}HEARD SHE FREAKED OUT...

18
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,666
{\an8}SHE WAS WASTED,
HAD TO GET HER STOMACH PUMPED.

19
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,791
{\an8}RELIABLE SOURCE SAYS SHE WAS DEHYDRATED.

20
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,250
{\an8}DEHYDRATED? WTF? SHE DRANK SO MUCH!

21
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,500
{\an8}MISS PERFECT IS IN TROUBLE...

22
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,250
{\an8}WHAT A FUCKED UP ROYAL FAMILY

23
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,875
{\an8}ROLE MODEL, OR WHAT?

24
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,458
{\an8}TOO BAD SHE DIDN'T DIE!!!

25
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,291
{\an8}GET A GRIP! I FEEL SORRY FOR HER!!

26
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,250
"Would be nice to see you soon."

27
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,541
Please...

28
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,125
It hurts my eyes.

29
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,250
Margrethe...

30
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,250
It's not up for discussion.

31
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,833
It was decided a long time ago.

32
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,125
You just have to do it.

33
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,083
You're the strongest of us all.

34
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,916
Margrethe?

35
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,833
Close the door behind you.

36
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,583
<i>Never do this again.</i>

37
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,208
{\an8}TO GUSTAV

38
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:46,625
{\an8}DELETE THE VIDEO FROM THE DANCE,
YOU FUCKING PSYCHOPATH

39
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,958
- The queen looks lovely.
- Thank you.

40
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,291
Sofia?

41
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,291
- Hey!
- Karl Johan?

42
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:19,083
- Here we are!
- How lovely!

43
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,916
- Hey!
- Hey.

44
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:25,500
What a nice place.
We're so happy to be here.

45
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,708
- Alexander is...
- He's out on the terrace.

46
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,291
- You know what I've got for you?
- No?

47
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,875
- No, I don't.
- I have a little surprise for you.

48
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,625
- Surprise?
- Yeah.

49
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,000
It's so nice and soft, isn't it?

50
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,333
- Good to see you!
- Hey, Alexander.

51
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,958
It's been so long!

52
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,541
I couldn't have felt better.
I'm enjoying the Norwegian landscape.

53
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:37,208
- Just a bit. It's a little flat.
- Yeah, it's a bit flat.

54
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,083
Have you just arrived?

55
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:50,791
- It'll be perfect by the end of the week.
- Right. Okay.

56
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:56,875
Yeah, yeah, I told Christian

57
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,500
that I was great at--

58
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,458
- Yeah!
- Great...

59
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:03,333
Great at skiing, to impress him.

60
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,708
- We had just met.
- I was just as nervous.

61
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:11,208
I could barely ski before I saw that
chair lift that took me all the way up.

62
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:14,958
At the top of the hill,
my whole body starts to shake.

63
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:17,625
Sverre just flew downhill,
like a real Norwegian.

64
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:21,125
- Yeah!
- Oh my, I had completely forgotten that.

65
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,583
They're embarrassing me.

66
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,333
Yeah. No...

67
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,333
- No, thank you.
- Alexander is vegetarian.

68
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,041
Yeah.

69
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:33,750
Somebody has to set an example.

70
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,000
- Oh...
- Mom.

71
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,333
Kids today, huh?

72
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,500
- Anyway.
- Very good.

73
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,291
Somehow, I get twisted into both Sofia's

74
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,791
and Christian's skis.

75
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:47,000
- Both of them?
- Yeah.

76
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I remember the moments after.
We're laying there in a pile.

77
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,500
Skis and sticks poking out everywhere.

78
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,208
There you are!

79
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:03,291
- I didn't think you were coming.
- No.

80
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:04,958
Good to see you.

81
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,666
- Hey, you.
- Good to see you.

82
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:09,208
- Likewise. How are you?
- Good. You look great.

83
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,375
Don't worry. Were you out
on one of your adventures, as usual?

84
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,625
One of your fishing trips.
You're a busy man.

85
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:36,041
Should we do a toast?

86
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:38,916
- Good to see...
- Cheers.

87
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:43,958
Good to see you.

88
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:49,250
Cheers.

89
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,541
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

90
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,125
- Did I wake you?
- Hmm?

91
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:49,666
- Did I wake you?
- Huh?

92
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:51,916
Did I wake you?

93
00:34:56,875 --> 00:35:01,833
Perfect. I was wondering if you wanted
to join me on the ski slopes today?

94
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:09,875
I don't know. In a little bit?

95
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,958
- In a little bit, sure.
- Yeah.

96
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:14,625
- Give me five minutes...
- Cool.

97
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,458
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

98
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:19,541
- See you outside.
- Yep.

99
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:21,375
Bye.

100
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:47,458
- You look good.
- Thanks.

101
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:52,416
Us royals have to stick together.
There aren't that many left.

102
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,541
Everyone always assumes

103
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:05,166
that we have to be
so perfect all the time, right?

104
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:08,458
It's hard.

105
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:13,916
Especially when the monarchy
is so fragile today.

106
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:19,125
Imagine being the person
that makes the house of cards fall.

107
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,333
Just one little scandal,

108
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:25,333
and hundreds of years of history... gone.

109
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:26,666
Poof!

110
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:27,625
Like that.

111
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:33,541
And imagine having that
next to your name in the history books.

112
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:35,833
Forget about it.

113
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,583
<i>And imagine having that
next to your name in the history books.</i>

114
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,333
Uhm... Margrethe?

115
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:22,833
Should I...? Are you okay? What's going on?

116
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,541
Hello? It'll be okay.

117
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,375
What's happening? Hello? Hello?

118
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,875
Come on. It'll be okay.

119
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,875
- Sit still. I can't.
- Give me your hand.

120
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,916
Okay. Don't look down. Don't look down.

121
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Look at me. Can you look at me?

122
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:50,541
Can't you face me?
Just a little bit. A little bit.

123
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:54,875
Thank you. A little bit.
Okay. Just do as I say.

124
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,750
Do as I say.
Have you ever breathed into a square?

125
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:01,750
No. Just imagine a square.

126
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,291
Just look at me.

127
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:07,875
Look at me. Yes. And imagine a square.

128
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:14,375
Okay, can you see your square?
Take a deep, long breath.

129
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,541
Yes. In... and out.

130
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,750
Yes. Great. That's it.

131
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,125
You're good at breathing into a square.

132
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,291
It's helping.

133
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,250
Are we skiing down that?

134
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:55,916
I'm okay!

135
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,791
That was on purpose.

136
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:06,458
Oh, I actually have something for you.

137
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:11,250
- Okay, close your eyes and do this.
- Okay.

138
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,458
Open.

139
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:15,625
Open.

140
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,791
- Have you had it before?
- No, I haven't.

141
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:26,291
- There's a first time for everything.
- Yeah.

142
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,375
Let's see...

143
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:33,000
- You know... Yeah, okay. Whoa. Yeah.
- There you go.

144
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:45,750
- It's the best chocolate.
- I agree.

145
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,708
Are you feeling any better?

146
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:05,333
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, don't apologize.

147
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,125
Does that happen a lot, or...?

148
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,541
I didn't mean your fear of heights,

149
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:21,333
but your anxiety and anxiety attacks.

150
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:35,708
Okay.

151
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:40,916
- I don't.
- No, no. That's fine.

152
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,875
That must be...

153
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:27,666
That must be hard.

154
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:29,958
I can only imagine.

155
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,708
For you, but also

156
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:36,666
for her, too, naturally.

157
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,875
Do you realize that we are
1,379 meters up in the air now?

158
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,291
- Meters above sea level? How do you know?
- I know everything.

159
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:10,666
- Oh, okay. Okay.
- But don't tell anyone.

160
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:26,416
Isn't that... Kalle sitting over there?

161
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:29,791
Should we go to him?

162
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,041
We can do it after.

163
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:41,083
We can go say hi first. What do you say?

164
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,291
Come on.

165
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:56,041
- Good to see you!
- Likewise. Take a seat.

166
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:02,125
Nice to meet you all.
Let me just get rid of this.

167
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:04,083
- Hi. Alexander.
- Hi. Ingrid.

168
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:05,000
- Ingrid?
- Yeah.

169
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,750
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

170
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,125
Can I have a beer? Thanks. Cheers!

171
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,625
- It's his song.
- Is it his?

172
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:51,416
- It's hard to dance in ski boots.
- Yeah!

173
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,375
Do you know where I can take a leak?

174
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:48,708
It was nice to meet your friends.

175
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,875
Where are we going after?

176
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:03,500
I think I'm gonna take a shower,
and then we can go to Ingrid's together?

177
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,250
- I'll see you in there.
- Yep.

178
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,166
Okay, that...

179
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,250
What... are you doing?

180
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:10,875
If you...

181
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:13,500
If you... thought that the two of us...

182
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:25,916
Um... Yeah.

183
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,666
- No...
- Sorry. It's...

184
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:50,833
- I'm sorry.
- No. You don't need to apologize.

185
00:48:51,416 --> 00:48:52,833
Margrethe, it...

186
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:56,833
Some of it is my fault, too.

187
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:00,250
I must have given you some,

188
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,625
some mixed signals...

189
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:07,333
Something. I don't know.
But I didn't mean to.

190
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,666
Okay, Margrethe?

191
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:17,500
I...

192
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,708
Margrethe, you're like
a little sister to me.

193
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:31,166
Okay, you know what, Margrethe?
I have an idea.

194
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:34,583
Let's forget everything
that happened here.

195
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:40,208
Margre...

196
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:07,750
Margrethe?

197
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,083
I just wanted to say that I'm going now.

198
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:13,041
I hope I'll see you there.

199
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:44,125
FROM INGRID
HOW WAS...?

200
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:23,708
Red porridge with cream.

201
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:25,666
I think I've got it!

202
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,250
{\an8}FROM GUSTAV

203
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:26,041
{\an8}I HEAR YOU'RE IN HEMSEDAL.
I AM AT STAVKROA, COME HERE!

204
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,125
{\an8}TO JENS

205
00:57:57,125 --> 00:58:03,833
{\an8}I'M SLEEPING AT INGRID'S
WILL YOU TELL MOM AND DAD?

206
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:05,875
{\an8}FROM JENS
OKAY. ENJOY YOURSELF.

207
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,208
- You should come visit us next time.
- See you. Bye.

208
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:42,083
- My good man.
- Thank you.

209
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,500
- Good bye.
- Good to see you again.

210
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,958
- Thanks.
- See you.

211
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:47,750
- See you.
- Bye.

212
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:51,333
Thanks for... the skiing trip.

213
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:54,416
I'll see you around.

214
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:03,166
And now, it's time for

215
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:04,291
a film!

216
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:16,125
Margrethe?

217
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:20,791
Margrethe?

218
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:23,041
What is it?

219
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,416
We're trying to help you, Margrethe.

220
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:36,916
You have to understand
the pressure we're under.

221
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:42,458
We're not like regular people.

222
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:47,208
We can't live like everybody else.

223
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:50,791
You can do this.

224
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,250
My darling.

225
01:12:58,333 --> 01:12:59,916
You're the strongest of us all.

226
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:43,208
{\an8}THE QUEEN

227
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:48,083
But first, a young up and coming
and hyped artist.

228
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:53,666
<i>I'm sorry, I'm fucked up
And I know it, I don't give a fuck</i>

229
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:59,250
<i>What's up? Lifting up the phone
Life is calling me, but I'm hanging up</i>

230
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:04,916
<i>I'm a party boy, making a mosh pit
Wearing some jeans, I go batshit</i>

231
01:33:04,916 --> 01:33:08,625
<i>I'm a rock star
I am fucked up!</i>

232
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:12,958
<i>People have called me
Twice, three, four times</i>

233
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:16,083
<i>I am hurt, my wounds need a band aid</i>

234
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:19,708
<i>They say we need to find
Something else to do</i>

235
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:21,833
<i>But you can't kill the child in me</i>

236
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:27,666
<i>'Cause there lives a little devil in me</i>

237
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,291
<i>No, you can't kill the child in me</i>

238
01:33:36,625 --> 01:33:38,875
<i>'Cause there lives a little devil in me</i>

239
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:44,166
<i>You won't kill the child in me</i>

240
01:37:00,458 --> 01:37:04,125
