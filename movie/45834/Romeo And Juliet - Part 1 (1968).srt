1
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,500
Two households,
both alike in dignity,

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,000
in fair Verona
where we lay our scene,

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,000
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,500
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,800
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,500
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life,

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,000
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
do with their death...
bury their parents'strife.

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
[laughing]

10
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,000
But the quarrel is between
our masters and us their men.

11
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,300
Ah, 'tis all one.

12
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,000
[laughing]

13
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,300
Here come the house
of the Montagues.

14
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,500
Ah, good morrow.

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,400
Good morrow
to you, sir.

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,500
Quarrel,
I will back thee.

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,000
Right.

18
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,700
Fail me not.

19
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I do bite
my thumb, sir.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,500
No, sir.

23
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
I do not bite my
thumb at you, sir,

24
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,000
but I do bite
my thumb, sir.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,500
Do you quarrel, sir?

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,000
Quarrel, sir?
No, no, no, sir.

27
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,500
If you do, sir,
I am for you.

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,500
I serve as good
a man as you.

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,500
No better?

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,800
Yes, better, sir.

31
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,000
You lie.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,500
[laughing]

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,000
Draw!

34
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,700
Draw if you be men!

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,600
Gregory, remember
thy swashing blow!

36
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,400
[shouting]

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Kill the Capulets!

38
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,000
[shouting]

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,000
Part, fools!
Put up your swords!

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You know not what you do!

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The Prince hath
expressly forbid

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,100
this bandying
in Verona streets!

43
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,000
Here come the Capulets!

44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,500
Tybalt, Capulet's kinsman!

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,900
What, art thou drawn among
these heartless hinds?

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,500
Turn thee, Benvolio.
Look upon thy death.

47
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,000
I do but keep the peace.

48
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,500
Put up thy sword

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,900
or manage it
to part these men with me.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,700
What, drawn
and talk of peace?

51
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
I hate the word,

52
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,700
as I hate hell,
all Montagues and thee.

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,300
Have at thee, cowards!

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,100
Capulet!

55
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,500
Montague!

56
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,800
[shouting]

57
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,000
Capulet!

58
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,700
Now hie thee home,
fragment.

59
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,100
You villain!

60
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,500
Capulet!

61
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
[shouting]

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,100
Give me my long sword! Ho!

63
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,500
Capulet!

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
Down to the market square!

65
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,000
Capulet!

66
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,800
Follow me! Follow me!

67
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,500
Kill that villain Montague!

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,900
My noble uncle!
My noble uncle!

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,700
What?

70
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,900
My sword! My sword!

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,900
Thou shalt not stir
a foot to seek a foe!

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,900
Hold me not!
Let me go!

73
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Montague!

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
Montague!

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,000
Kill the villain!

76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,000
[shouting]

77
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
[woman screams]

78
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I'll strike thee, coward.

79
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,900
[trumpet fanfare]

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
The Prince!

81
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,900
The Prince is coming!
Put down your weapons!

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,200
The Prince!

83
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,400
The Prince!

84
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,100
Here comes the Prince!

85
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,300
Put your weapons down!
The Prince!

86
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,400
Rebellious subjects,
enemies to peace,

87
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,000
throw your mistempered
weapons to the ground...

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Down with your weapons.

89
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,300
And hear the sentence
of your moved Prince.

90
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,000
Three civil brawls
bred of an airy word,

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,500
by thee, old Capulet...

92
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,200
No, no.

93
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,100
And Montague...

94
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

95
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,900
If ever you disturb
our streets again,

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,900
your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,400
For this time
all the rest depart away!

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,500
You, Capulet,
shall go along with me.

99
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,000
And, Montague,
come you this afternoon.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Once more, on pain of death,
all men depart.

101
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,900
[trumpet fanfare]

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Where is Romeo?
Saw you him today?

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,500
Right glad I am
he was not at this fray.

104
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,900
Madam, an hour before
the worshipped sun

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,500
peered forth
the golden window of the east,

106
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,900
a troubled mind drove me
to walk abroad:

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
where, underneath
the grove of sycamore

108
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,600
so early walking
did I see your son.

109
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,400
Towards him I made;
but he was ware of me,

110
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,400
and stole into
the cover of the wood.

111
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,400
Many a morning hath
he there been seen.

112
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,400
See, where he comes.

113
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,500
So please you, step aside.

114
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I would thou wert
so happy by thy stay,

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,500
to hear true shrift.

117
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,000
Come, madam. Let's away.

118
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,900
Good morrow, cousin.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Is the day so young?

120
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,600
But new struck nine.

121
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,900
Ay me!

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,500
Sad hours seem long.

123
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,000
Was that my father
that went hence so fast?

124
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,500
Hmm?

125
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
It was.

126
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,100
What sadness lengthens
Romeo's hours?

127
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,100
Not having that, which having
makes them short.

128
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,300
Hmm. Hmm!

129
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,000
But, Romeo...

130
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Farewell, Coz.

131
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,000
[shouting]

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,500
[woman screaming]

133
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,500
God's me,
what fray was here?

134
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
Yet tell me not,

135
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,000
for I have heard it all.

136
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,500
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

137
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,300
Soft, I will go along.

138
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,000
But Montague is bound
as well as l,

139
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,000
in penalty alike,

140
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
and 'tis not hard, I think,

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,500
for men as old as we
to keep the peace.

142
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Oh...

143
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
Of honorable reckoning
are you both,

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,500
and pity 'tis you
lived at odds so long:

145
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,500
but, but now, my lord,

146
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
what say you to my suit?

147
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,500
But saying o'er what
I have said before,

148
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,700
my child is yet
a stranger in the world.

149
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,500
She hath not seen the change
of fourteen years.

150
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,800
[laughing]

151
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,000
Let two more summers
wither in their pride,

152
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,900
'ere we may think her
ripe to be a bride.

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,700
Younger than she
are happy mothers made.

154
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,500
[chuckling]

155
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,500
And too soon marred
are those so early made.

156
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,500
The earth hath swallowed
all my hopes but she,

157
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,500
she is the hopeful lady
of my earth.

158
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,000
But woo her, gentle
Paris, get her heart,

159
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,500
my will to her consent
is but a part.

160
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh, Peter!

161
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,500
This night I hold
an old accustomed feast

162
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,000
whereto I have invited
many a guest.

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Such as I love,
you among the store,

164
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
one more, most welcome,
makes my number more.

165
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,800
Nurse,
where's my daughter?

166
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,000
Call her forth to me.

167
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,000
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

168
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,500
I bade her come.

169
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,000
Where is the girl?
Juliet! Juliet!

170
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,200
Where is the girl?
Juliet!

171
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,500
Where is the girl? Juliet!

172
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,000
How now, who calls?

173
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Your mother!
Your lady mother!

174
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Juliet, it's your mother,
your lady mother.

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Make haste, girl.
Make haste.

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,800
Where were you?

177
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

178
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,500
This is the matter.

179
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,000
Make haste, girls.
Come on, come on.

180
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,100
Nurse, um...

181
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,900
give leave awhile,
we must talk in secret.

182
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,500
Nurse, come back again.
I have remembered me.

183
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Thou's hear our counsel.

184
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,000
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

185
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,000
I can tell her age
unto an hour.

186
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,400
She's not fourteen.

187
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,400
I'll lay fourteen
of my teeth.

188
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,400
And yet to
my teen be it spoke,

189
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,400
I have but four,
she's not fourteen.

190
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,100
How long is it
to Lammastide?

191
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,900
A fortnight and odd days.

192
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,300
Even or odd, of all
the days of the year,

193
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,300
come Lammas Eve at night
shall she be fourteen.

194
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
Susan and she--

195
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,300
God rest all Christian
souls were of an age.

196
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,800
Well, Susan is with God.
She was too good for me.

197
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
But, as I said,
on Lammas Eve

198
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,900
at night
shall she be fourteen.

199
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,100
That shall she, marry!
I remember it well.

200
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,800
My lord and you
were then at Mantua!

201
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,400
Nay, I do bear a brain.

202
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,900
For then she could,
she could stand high lone.

203
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Nay, by the road she could have
run and waddled all about,

204
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,900
for even the day before
she broke her brow;

205
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,800
and then my husband-- God rest his soul,
'a were a merry man--

206
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,300
took up the child.

207
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,900
"Yea," quoth he,
"dost thou fall upon thy face?

208
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,800
"Thou wilt fall backward
when thou hast more wit;

209
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
wilt thou not, Jule?"

210
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Nurse!

211
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,400
And by my holiday,

212
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,900
the pretty wretch left
crying and said, "Ay."

213
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,200
[laughing]

214
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,900
Enough of this,
I pray thee hold thy peace.

215
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,500
Yes, madam.

216
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Now, Juliet.

217
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,800
[laughing]

218
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,300
God mark thee to His grace

219
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,800
Thou was the prettiest babe
that 'er I nurs'd.

220
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
And I might live to see
thee married once,

221
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,800
I have my wish.

222
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:20,300
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
I came to talk of.

223
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
Tell me,
daughter Juliet,

224
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,800
how stands your disposition
to be married?

225
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,900
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

226
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,400
An honor, were I not
thy only nurse,

227
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,300
I would say thou hadst sucked
wisdom from my teat.

228
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,900
Well, think
of marriage now.

229
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,900
Younger than you, here in Verona,
ladies of esteem,

230
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,400
are made
already mothers.

231
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,900
By my count
I was your mother

232
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,900
much upon these years
that you are now a maid.

233
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,400
Oh, yes, I remember.

234
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,200
Thus then, in brief...

235
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,200
the valiant Paris
seeks you for his love.

236
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,300
A man, young lady!
Lady, such as all the world--

237
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,300
Why he's a man of wax.

238
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,300
Verona's summer hath
not such a flower.

239
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,300
Nay, he's
a flower in faith.

240
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,800
Shh.

241
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,800
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?

242
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,200
Madam! Madam!

243
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,300
The guests have come,
supper serv'd up,

244
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,500
you call'd,
my young lady ask'd for!

245
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,800
We follow.

246
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Speak briefly,
can you like of Paris' love?

247
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:37,400
I'll look to like,
if looking liking move.

248
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,900
But no more deep
will I endart mine eye,

249
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,900
than your consent gives
strength to make it fly.

250
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Juliet, the county stays.

251
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,900
Madam, I come.

252
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Go, girl, seek happy nights
for happy days.

253
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,800
[music playing]

254
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
[singing]

255
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,100
Give me a case
to put my visage in;

256
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
a visor for a visor.

257
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,800
What care I what curious eye
doth quote deformities.

258
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,300
Here are the beetle-brows
shall blush for me.

259
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,900
Ahh!

260
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
What, shall this speech
be spoke for our excuse?

261
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Or shall we on
without apology?

262
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
The date is out
of such prolixity.

263
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,100
Let them measure us
by what they will.

264
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,400
We'll measure them
a measure and be gone.

265
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Come, knock and enter,
and no sooner in,

266
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,200
but every man
betake him to his legs.

267
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,900
And we mean well in
going to this masque,

268
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,300
but 'tis no wit to go.

269
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,100
Why, may one ask?

270
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,300
I dreamt a dream tonight.

271
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,100
Ho, and so did I.

272
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,700
Well, what was yours?

273
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,100
That dreamers often lie.

274
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,800
In bed asleep while they
do dream things true.

275
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,400
Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.

276
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,100
Queen Mab?

277
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,700
She is...She is
the fairies' midwife.

278
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,300
[laughter]

279
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
And she comes in state

280
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,300
no bigger than
an agate stone

281
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,300
on the forefinger
of an alderman,

282
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,600
drawn with a team
of little atomies

283
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,900
athwart men's noses
as they lie asleep.

284
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,900
Her wagon spokes are made
of long spinner's legs;

285
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,400
and the cover,
of the wings of grasshoppers;

286
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,900
the traces
of the smallest spider's web;

287
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:03,800
and the collars, mmm,
of the moonshine's watery beams;

288
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,300
her whip, crack!

289
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Is a cricket's bone;
the lash of film;

290
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,800
and in this state

291
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,500
she gallops night by night
through lovers' brains,

292
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,000
and then they dream of love,

293
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,500
o'er ladies' lips,
who straight on kisses dream,

294
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,000
which oft the angry Mab
with blisters plagues,

295
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,000
because their breaths
with, er,

296
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,500
sweetmeats tainted are.

297
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,000
Snd sometime comes she
with a tithe-pig's tail,

298
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,000
tickling the parson's nose
as he lies asleep,

299
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,200
and dreams he
of another benefice.

300
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,000
[all] Amen.

301
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,600
[laughter]

302
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,400
Sometimes she driveth
o'er a soldier's neck,

303
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,900
and then dreams he

304
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,400
of cutting foreign throats,
of breaches,

305
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
ambuscadoes, spanish blades,
drums in his ear,

306
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,100
at which he starts and wakes;

307
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,600
and being thus frighted
tries a prayer or two...

308
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,100
and sleeps again.

309
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
This is that very Mab

310
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,100
that plaits the manes
of horses in the night,

311
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,100
and bakes the elf-locks
in foul sluttish hairs,

312
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,700
which once untangled
much misfortune bodes.

313
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,100
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs,

314
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,600
that presses them
and learns them first to bear

315
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,100
making them women
of good carriage.

316
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,900
This is she...

317
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,100
This is she that...

318
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,900
This...is she.

319
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
Peace, Mercutio, peace.

320
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,100
Thou talk'st of nothing.

321
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,600
Thou talk'st of nothing.

322
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,800
True.

323
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,100
True, I talk of dreams;

324
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,100
which are the children
of an idle brain...

325
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,100
Begot of nothing
but vain fantasy;

326
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,600
which is as thin
of substance as the air,

and more inconstant
than the wind

328
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,100
who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north,

329
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,100
and being angered
puffs away from thence,

330
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,100
turning his side
to the dew-dropping south.

331
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,600
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves.

332
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,600
Strike drum.
Come, lusty gentlemen.

Romeo, we shall
arrive too late.

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,500
I fear too early...

337
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,600
For my mind misgives...

338
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,100
Some consequence,
yet hanging in the stars,

339
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,100
shall bitterly begin
his fearful date

340
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,600
with this night's revels,

341
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,600
and expire the term
of a despised life

342
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
closed in my breast,

343
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,600
by some vile forfeit
of untimely death.

the steerage of my course...

347
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,100
Enter my poor house.
Vido, vido, welcome.

00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,100
Oh, my lovely Helena,
my lovely niece.

349
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Welcome all!
Be merry, gentlemen.

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,000
Be lively, ladies.
Ahoy! Ahoy!

Welcome, gentlemen.

352
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,000
I have seen the day
that I have worn a visor

353
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,500
and could tell a whispering tale
in a fair lady's ear,

such as would please.

[music playing]

She doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

359
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,800
It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night

360
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,000
as a rich jewel
in an Ethiop's ear;,

361
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,600
beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

trooping with crows,

as yonder lady
o'er her fellow shows.

364
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,900
Did my heart love till now?

365
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,500
Forswear it sight,

366
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,900
for I ne'er saw true beauty
till this night.

367
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,800
This by his voice
should be a Montague.

368
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,500
Uncle, this is
a Montague, our foe;

to be a virtuous
and well managed youth.

377

I would not for the wealth
of all this town

here in my house
do him disparagement.

Therefore have patience,
take no note of him.

You are a saucy boy.

What is a maid?

It then will fade

to hush us along

and bitter as gall

that never will pall

and bitter as gall

So does the fairest maid

427
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,500
If I profane
with my unworthiest hand

428
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,000
this holy shrine,

429
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,200
the gentle sin is this;

430
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:50,400
my lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand

431
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:57,300
to smooth the rough touch
with a gentle kiss.

432
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,700
Oh.

433
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:20,000
Good pilgrim, you do wrong
your hand too much

434
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,000
which mannerly devotion
shows in this;

435
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:28,500
for saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch

436
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,500
and palm to palm is
holy palmers' kiss.

437
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,500
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

438
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,500
Ay, pilgrim, lips that
they must use in prayer.

439
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,000
Oh...

440
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,000
O then, dear saint,

441
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,500
let lips do
what hands do...

442
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,000
They pray,
grant thou,

443
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,500
lest faith
turn to despair.

444
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Saints do not move,

445
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
though grants
for prayers' sake.

446
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Then move not...

447
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,500
While my prayer's
effect I take.

448
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:27,000
Thus from my lips,
by thine,

449
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,700
my sin is purged.

450
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,500
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.

451
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,500
Sin from my lips!

452
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,500
O trespass sweetly urged!

453
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,500
Give me my sin again.

454
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,000
A rose will bloom

455
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,300
It then will fade

456
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:07,400
So does a youth

457
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:20,400
So does the fairest maid

458
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,500
Juliet!

459
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,200
Lady Juliet!

Nurse?

461

Your mother craves
a word with you.

462

Make haste, make haste!

463
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,500
What is her mother?

464
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,000
Hmm.
Merry, bachelor,

465
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,000
her mother is
the lady of the house,

466
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,000
and a good lady,
and wise, and virtuous;

467
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,500
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

468
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Hmm.

469
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,500
I tell you he that
shall lay hold of her

470
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,000
shall have the chinks.

471
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,500
Is she a Capulet?

472
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,000
Ah, dear account!

473
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,300
My life is my foe's debt.

474
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,200
What, ho, my mistresses?

475
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,000
What, will you be gone?

476
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,500
It seems so, poor God,
it is so very late.

477
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,800
We'll call it early,
by and by.

478
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,100
Good night,
sweet, my Lady Juliet.

479
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,500
Come hither, nurse.

480
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,500
Hmm?

481
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,100
What is yon gentleman?

482
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,500
Count Paris.

483
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,100
No. What's he
that follows there?

484
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,900
Oh! I know not.

485
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Go, ask his name.

486
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Hmm. Romeo, of
the house of Montague.

487
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,100
What?

488
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,100
His name is Romeo,
and a Montague;

489
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,800
the only son of
your great enemy.

490
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,500
My only love sprung
from my only hate,

491
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,500
too early seen unknown,
and known too late!

492
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh!

493
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,000
Prodigious birth of love
it is to me

494
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,900
that I must love
a loathed enemy.

495
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,000
Juliet!

496
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,500
My Lady Juliet!

497
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,000

[horn blows]

505
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,000
Romeo!

506
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Romeo!

507
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
[laughter]

508
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Romeo!

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,500

Romeo!

00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,000
1, 2, 3.

514
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,500
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

515
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,000
He is wise,

516
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,200
and on my life hath
stolen him home to bed.

517
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,500
He leaped
this orchard wall.

518
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,700
Call, good Mercutio.

519
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,000
Romeo!

520
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,200
[whistles]

521
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,200
Romeo! Passion! Lover!

522
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,800
O-hooo! Madman!

523
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,200
O-hooo! Romeo!

524
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,300
He heareth not,
he stirreth not, he moveth not.

525
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,900
The ape is dead.

526
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,800
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.

527
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,500
Romeo, it's all right.

528
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,200
[dog barking]

529
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,400
But soft,

530
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,600
what light through
yonder window breaks?

531
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,700
[bell ringing]

532
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,300
It is my lady,

533
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,400
oh, it is my love.

534
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,300
Oh...

535
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,900
O that she knew she were.

536
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,400
She speaks,
yet she says nothing.

537
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,600
What of that?

538
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,900
Her eye discourses,
I will answer it.

539
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,900
I am too bold,

540
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,900
'tis not to me she speaks.

541
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,400
Two of the fairest stars
in all the heavens,

542
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,900
having some business,
do entreat her eyes

543
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,900
to twinkle in their spheres
till they return.

544
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

545
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,500
Oh, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

546
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,100
that I might touch
that cheek.

547
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,700
Ay me!

548
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
She speaks.

549
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,600
Oh, speak again,
bright angel.

550
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,400
O Romeo, Romeo,

551
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,900
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

552
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,000
Deny thy father,
and refuse thy name.

553
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,000
Or if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

554
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,400
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

555
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,900
Shall I hear more,

556
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,900
or shall I speak at this?

557
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,900
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.

558
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,700
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.

559
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,000
What is Montague?

560
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:49,000
It is nor hand nor foot,
nor arm nor face

561
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,900
nor any other part
belonging to a man.

562
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,100
O be some other name.

563
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,100
What's in a name?

564
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,600
That which we call a rose

565
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,700
by any other name
would smell as sweet;

566
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,300
so Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,

567
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,900
retain that dear perfection

568
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,900
which he owes
without that title.

569
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,400
Romeo, doff thy name,

570
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,400
and for that name
which is no part of thee,

571
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,500
take all myself.

572
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,600
I'll take thee
at thy word.

573
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Call me but love,
and I'll be new baptized;

574
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,900
henceforth I never
will be Romeo.

575
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,400
What man art thou,
that thus bescreened in night

576
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,100
so stumblest
on my counsel?

577
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,000
By a name I know not how to
tell thee who I am.

578
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,900
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself,

579
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,300
because it is
an enemy to thee.

580
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,200
Had I it written,
I would tear the word.

581
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,400
My ears have not yet drunk

582
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,400
a hundred words
of that tongue's utterance,

583
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,400
yet I know the sound.

584
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,500
Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?

585
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,000
Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.

586
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,800
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me and wherefore?

587
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,300
The orchard walls are
high and hard to climb,

588
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,700
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

589
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,300
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

590
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,900
With love's light wings

591
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,900
did I o'er perch
these walls,

592
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,400
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,

593
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,400
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

594
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,200
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me.

595
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,300
Sshhh!

596
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,400
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee.

597
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,900
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their eyes.

598
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,900
And but thou love me...

599
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,700
Let them find me here

600
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,700
my life were better
ended by their hate,

601
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,100
than death prorogued,
wanting of thy love.

602
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,900
Dost thou love me?

603
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,100
I know thou wilt say ay,
and I will take thy word;

604
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,600
yet if thou swearest,

605
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,000
thou mayst prove false;

606
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,500
at lovers' perjuries
they say jove laughs.

607
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,800
O gentle Romeo,

608
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:13,000
if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

609
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,800
Or if thou thinkest
I am too quickly won,

610
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,400
I'll frown and be perverse,
and say thee nay,

611
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,800
so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world.

612
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,000
In truth, fair Montague,
I am too fond...

613
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,500
And therefore thou mayst think
my haviour light.

614
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,700
No.

615
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,500
But trust me, gentleman,
I'll prove more true

616
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,600
than those that have
more cunning to be strange.

617
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,000
I should have been
more strange,

618
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,500
I must confess,

619
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,500
but that thou overheard'st,
ere I was ware,

620
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,000
my true love's passion;

621
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,000
therefore pardon me,

622
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,000
and not impute this yielding
to light love,

623
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,900
which the dark night
hath so discovered.

624
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,500
Lady, by yonder
blessed moon, I swear.

625
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,500
Oh, swear not by the moon,

626
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,000
th'inconstant moon,

627
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,500
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,

628
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,600
lest that thy love prove
likewise variable.

629
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,100
What shall I swear by?

630
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,100
Do not swear at all.

631
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,500
Or if thou wilt...

632
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,500
Swear by thy gracious self,

633
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,500
which is the god
of my idolatry,

634
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,000
and I'll believe thee.

635
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,100
If my heart's dear love,
I swear...

636
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, Juliet!

637
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,500
Sweet, good night.

638
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,000
This bud of love
by summer's ripening breath

639
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,000
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

640
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,200
Good night, good night.

641
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,700
As sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart

642
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,700
as that
within my breast.

643
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,100
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

644
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,900
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

645
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,800
Th' exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

646
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,500
Ahh.

647
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,000
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it.

648
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,800
And yet I would it were
to give again.

649
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
Wouldst thou
withdraw it?

650
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,800
For what purpose, love?

651
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,800
But to be frank
and give it thee again.

652
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,500
And yet I wish
but for the thing I have,

653
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,500
my bounty is
as boundless as the sea,

654
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,000
my love as deep.

655
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,000
The more I give to thee,
the more I have,

656
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,000
for both are infinite.

657
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,500
Juliet!

658
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,000
Anon, good nurse!

659
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,500
Sweet Montague, be true.

660
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,000
Madam!

661
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,000
Stay but a little,
I will come again.

662
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,500
Madam! Lady Juliet!

663
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,200
O blessed, blessed night!

664
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,800
Oh! I am afeard,
being in night,

665
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,000
all this is but a dream,

666
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,500
too flattering-sweet
to be substantial.

667
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

668
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,500
If that thy bent of love
be honorable,

669
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,000
thy purpose marriage,
send me word tomorrow,

670
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,500
by one that I'll procure
to come to thee.

671
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,500
Where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite,

672
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,000
and all my fortunes
at thy foot I'll lay

673
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,700
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

674
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,000
Madam!

675
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,100
I come, anon.

676
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,500
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee--

677
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,700
Lady Juliet!

678
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,000
By and by I come!

679
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,200
To cease thy suit
and leave me to my grief.

680
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,700
Tomorrow will I send.

681
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,400
So thrive my soul.

682
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,100
A thousand times
good night!

683
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,500
Romeo!

684
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,300
At what o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

685
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,500
At the hour of nine.

686
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,500
I will not fail.

687
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,800
'Tis twenty years
till then.

688
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,100
Romeo!

689
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,000
I have forgot
why I did call thee back.

690
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,500
Let me stand here
till thou remember it.

691
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,100
I shall forget, to have
thee still stand there,

692
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,300
remembering how
I love thy company.

693
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,800
And I'll still stay,

694
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,800
to have thee
still forget,

695
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,800
forgetting
any other home but this.

696
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,100
Ahh.

697
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,400
[rooster crowing]

698
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,900
Good night, good night!

699
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,500
Parting is
such sweet sorrow

700
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,700
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

701
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,600
Woo!

702
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,000
Woo!

703
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,200
Friar Laurence!

704
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,000
What early tongue
so sweet saluteth me?

705
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,000
Good morrow, father!

706
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,000
Ha ha ha!

707
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,500
Hey!

708
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,300
Young son, it argues
a distempered head

709
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,800
so soon to bid
good morrow to thy bed.

710
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,900
Therefore thy earliness
doth me assure

711
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,900
thou art uproused with
some distemperature.

712
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,400
Or if not so,
then here I put it right

713
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,900
our Romeo hath not
been in bed tonight.

714
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,100
The last is true.
The sweeter rest was mine.

715
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,400
God pardon sin!
Wast thou with Rosaline?

716
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,900
With Rosaline,
my ghostly father, no.

717
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,900
I have forgot that name
and that name's woe.

718
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,400
That's my good son.

719
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,400
Well, where hast
thou been then?

720
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,900
I'll tell thee ere
thou ask it me again.

721
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,400
I have been feasting
with mine enemy,

722
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,800
where on a sudden
one hath wounded me.

723
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,900
Be plain, good son,
and homely in thy drift.

724
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,000
Riddling confession finds
but riddling shrift.

725
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,900
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set,

726
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,400
on the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.

727
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,900
As mine on hers,
so hers is set on mine,

728
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,400
and all combined,
save what thou must combine

729
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,400
by holy marriage.

730
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,400
When and where,
and how we met,

731
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,900
we woo'd, and made
exchange of vow,

732
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,300
I'll tell thee as we pass.

733
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,900
But this I pray,

734
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,200
that thou consent
to marry us today.

735
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,400
Hmmm?

736
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,600
Holy Saint Francis!

737
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,900
Is Rosaline,
that thou didst love so dear,

738
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,400
so soon forsaken?

739
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,400
Thou doest not mock me, Father!

740
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,400
Young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts,

741
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,900
but in their eyes.

742
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,400
Hear me, Father.

743
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,400
Jesu Maria!
What a deal of brine

744
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,900
hath washed thy sallow cheeks
for Rosaline!

745
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,400
And art thou changed?

746
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,900
Pronounce this
sentence then.

747
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,900
Women may fall when
there's no strength in men.

748
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,400
Thou chidst me oft
for loving Rosaline.

749
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,400
Doting, not for loving,
pupil mine.

750
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,600
Yes, for loving and,
and badest me bury love.

751
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,600
Not in a grave
to lay one in,

752
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,200
another out to have.

753
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,900
Come, young waverer,

754
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,400
come, go with me.

755
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,400
In one respect
I'll thy assistant be.

756
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,900
O Father!

757
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,900
For this alliance
may so happy prove

758
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,400
to turn your households'
rancor to pure love.

759
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,900
O, let us hence!

760
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,900
I stand on sudden haste.

761
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,400
Shh! Wisely and slow,

762
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,400
they stumble
that run fast.

763
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,900
Ha ha ha!

764
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,400
Shh!

765
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,900
Where the devil
should this Romeo be?

766
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,400
Hmm?

767
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,800
Came he not home tonight?

768
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,300
Hmm?

769
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,800
Huh?

770
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,800
Came he not home tonight?

771
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,800
Who?

772
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,000
Romeo.

773
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,800
O no, not to his father's.
I spoke with his man.

774
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,400
Hey, Tybalt, the kinsman
to old Capulet,

775
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,400
hath sent a letter
to his father's house.

776
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,900
A challenge, on my life.

777
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,400
Romeo will answer it.

778
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,400
Any man that can write
may answer a letter.

779
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,400
Nay, he will answer
the letter's master,

780
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,400
how he dares,
being dared.

781
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,900
Alas, poor Romeo,
he is already dead;

782
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,400
stabbed with
a white wench's black eye;

783
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,400
run through the ear
with a love song;

784
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,400
the very pin
of his heart cleft

785
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,400
with the blind
bow-boy's buttshaft.

786
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,400
And is he a man
to encounter Tybalt?

787
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,300
Why, what is Tybalt!

788
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,100
More than Prince of Cats,
I can tell you.

789
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,200
Ah, good morrow
to you both.

790
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,300
[sniff]

791
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,800
That we should be
thus afflicted

792
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,300
with these
strange flies,

793
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,400
these fashionmongers,

794
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,900
these pardonnez moi's.

795
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,400
Ah, Signor Romeo,

796
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,900
Bonjour.

797
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,400
Bonjour.

798
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,900
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

799
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,400
Huh?

800
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,900
You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

801
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,900
What counterfeit
did I give you?

802
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
The slip, sir, the slip,

803
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,300
can you not conceive?

804
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,700
Pardon, good Mercutio.

805
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,100
My business was great--

806
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,400
Oh! Ha ha ha!

807
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
In such a case as mine

808
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,900
a man may strain courtesy.

809
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,400
Come between us,
good Benvolio;

810
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,900
my wit faints.

811
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,900
Thy wit is
very bitter sweeting

812
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,400
it is most sharp sauce.

813
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,400
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

814
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,900
Ha ha ha!

815
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,900
Why, is not this
better now

816
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,100
than groaning for love?

817
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,800
Now art thou sociable,

818
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,800
now art thou Romeo;

819
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,300
now art thou
what thou art,

820
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,300
by art as well as
by nature.

821
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,800
For this driveling love
is like a great natural

822
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,300
that runs malling
up and down

823
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,300
to hide his bauble
in a hole.

824
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,800
Stop there,
stop there.

825
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,800
Thou desirest me to stop
in my tale against the hair?

826
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,800
Thou wouldst else
have made thy tale large.

827
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,400
No, no, no,
thou art deceived;

828
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,900
For I was come to
the whole depth of my tale,

829
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,000
and meant to occupy
the argument no longer.

830
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,800
Here's goodly gear.

831
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,300
[laughter]

832
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,100
Here's a fine barge.

833
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,300
A sail.

834
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,300
[all]
A sail, a sail.

835
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,300
[laughter]

836
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:54,000
Two, two; a shirt
and a smock.

837
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,800
[laughter]

838
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,300
Shh!

839
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,300
Peter.

840
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,700
Anon.

841
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,900
My fan, Peter.

842
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,500
Good, Peter,
to hide her face,

843
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,700
for her fan's
the fairer of the two.

844
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,600
Ha ha ha!

845
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,200
Oh!

846
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,800
God ye good morrow,
gentlemen.

847
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,100
God ye good den,
fair gentlewoman.

848
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,700
Is it good den,
I pray?

849
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,300
Well, 'tis no less
I tell you,

850
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,600
for the bawdy hand
of the dial

851
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,600
is now upon the prick
of noon.

852
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,300
Ha ha ha! Oh!

853
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,000
Out upon you,
what a man are you?

854
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,800
One, gentlewoman, that God
hath made himself to mar.

855
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,800
By my troth
it is well said,

856
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,300
for himself to mar
quoth 'a?

857
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,800
Hmm.

858
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,800
Gentleman, can any
of you tell me

859
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,500
where I may find
young Romeo?

860
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,300
[all]
Romeo, Romeo.

861
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,800
Hey!

862
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,300
Shh!

863
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,800
I am the youngest
of that name

864
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,300
for fault of a worse.

865
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,800
If you be he, sir,

866
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,900
I desire some
conference with you.

867
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,200
[jeering and laughing]

868
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,200
She will indite him
to some supper.

869
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,700
A bawd, a bawd.

870
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,800
A bawd!

871
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,800
Aah!

872
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,100
[laughter]

873
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,300
You filthy varmint you!

874
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,200
Here she comes!

875
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,800
Mercutio, no!

876
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,800
Aah!

877
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,300
An old hare hoar

878
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,100
And an old hare hoar

879
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,900
Is very good meat,
in lent

880
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,300
But a hare
that is a hoar

881
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,300
Is too much
for a score

882
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,500
When it hoars
ere it be spent

883
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,600
[nurse] Aah!

884
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,900
[laughter and cheering]

885
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Ooh!

886
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,400
[laughter]

887
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,400
Farewell, ancient lady.

888
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,200
Ooh!

889
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,200
[laughter and shouting]

890
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,200
Scurvy knave,
scurvy knave.

891
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,500
I'm none of
his flirt-gills.

892
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,400
I'm none of
his skein mates.

893
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,200
Er, cur, lousy knave,

894
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,200
lousy, lousy knave.

895
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,600
I pray you, sir.

896
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,600
What saucy merchant
was this

897
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,400
that was so full
of his property?

898
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,000
A gentleman, nurse, that loves
to hear himself talk,

899
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,100
and will speak
more in a minute

900
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,100
than he will stand to
in a month.

901
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,400
I'll take him down,

902
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,400
an 'a were lustier
than he is,

903
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,700
and twenty such jacks;

904
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,200
and if I cannot,
I'll find those that shall.

905
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,300
Ha ha ha!

906
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,300
Ha ha ha!

907
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,800
And thou must
stand by too

908
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,200
and suffer every knave

909
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,000
to use me
at his pleasure.

910
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:01,700
Ooh...

911
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,700
Punk rampant!

912
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,700
Pray you, sir,
a word.

913
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,100
Ooh!

914
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,200
Beef wit.

915
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,200
[organ playing]

916
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,800
[choir singing]

917
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,700
My young lady bid me
inquire you out.

918
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,200
What she did
bid me say,

919
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,200
I will keep to myself;,

920
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,700
but first
let me tell ye,

921
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,200
if ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise--

922
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,700
Nurse.

923
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,200
Shh! As they say,

924
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,700
it were a very gross
kind of behavior;,

925
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,200
for the gentlewoman
is young;

926
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,700
and therefore if you
should deal double with her,

927
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,200
it were an ill thing to be
offered to any gentlewoman,

928
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,700
and very
weak dealing.

929
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,200
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady and mistress,

930
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,300
I protest unto thee.

931
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,800
Bid her devise,

932
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,300
some means to come to
shrift this afternoon,

933
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,300
and there she shall
at Friar Laurence's cell

934
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:46,500
be shrived and married.

935
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,800
Oh!

936
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,300
Oh!

937
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,300
Here's for thy pains.

938
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,300
No, no truly, sir,
not a penny.

939
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,300
Go to,
I say you shall.

940
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,400
No.

941
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,200
Well...

942
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,800
Sir, my mistress
is the sweetest lady.

943
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,700
Lord, Lord, when she were
a little prating thing.

944
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,200
Good-bye. Oh!

945
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,200
O there is
a noble man in town,

946
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,200
One Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard.

947
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:20,200
I anger her sometimes and say
that Paris is the properer man.

948
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,700
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady.

949
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,200
A thousand times.

950
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:27,100
Ooh! Ooh!

951
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,300
[sighs]

952
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:57,300
The clock struck nine
when I did send the nurse,

953
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:01,200
in half an hour
she promised to return...

954
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,700
perchance
she cannot meet him;

955
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,700
ahh, that's not so,

956
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,700
oh, she's lame,

957
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,200
love's heralds
should be thoughts!

958
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,200
Had she affections
and warm youthful blood,

959
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,700
she would be
as swift in motion

960
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,200
as a ball.

961
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:22,200
But old folks,
many feign as they were dead,

962
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:26,200
unwieldy, slow, heavy...

963
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,900
And pale as lead.

964
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,200
O God, she comes.

965
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,700
O honey nurse,
what news?

966
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,700
O Lord, why look'st
thou sad?

967
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,200
Oh!

968
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,700
Though news be sad,

969
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,200
yet tell
them merrily.

970
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,700
[groaning]

971
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,200
Send the man away.

972
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,300
Peter, stay at the gate.

973
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,800
Go on.

974
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Hast thou met
with him?

975
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,300
Oh, I am aweary.

976
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,800
Give me leave awhile.

977
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,800
Fie, how my bones ache!

978
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,200
Ooh!

979
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,600
[groaning]

980
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:06,100
Sweet, sweet...

981
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,100
Sweet nurse.

982
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,600
Tell me, what says my love?

983
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,600
Ha ha ha!

984
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,600
Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

985
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:21,600
and courteous,
and kind,

986
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,600
and handsome,
and, I warrant him,

987
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,600
a virtuous--

988
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,100
Where is your mother?

989
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,600
Where is my mother?

990
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,100
Why, she is within.

991
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,600
Where should she be?

992
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,100
How oddly thou repliest!

993
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,600
"Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

994
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,600
where is your mother?"

995
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,200
Oh, God's lady,
are you so hot?

996
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,700
Marry, come up I trow.

997
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,200
Is this the poultice
for my aching bones?

998
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,700
Henceforward do
your messages yourself.

999
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,200
Here's such a coil!

1000
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,000
Come! What says Romeo?

1001
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,700
Have you got leave
to go to shrift today?

1002
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,200
I have.

1003
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,700
[chuckling]

1004
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,200
Then, hie you hence
to Friar Laurence's cell,

1005
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,700
there stays a husband
to make you a wife.

1006
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,300
Ha ha ha!

1007
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,700
Now comes the wanton blood
up in your cheeks.

1008
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,800
They'll be in scarlet
straight at any news.

1009
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,200
Hie you to church!

1010
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,400
I'll to dinner.

1011
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,200
Honest nurse, farewell!

1012
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,600
Ha ha ha!

1013
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,200
So smile the heavens
upon this holy act,

1014
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,200
that after-hours with sorrow
chide us not.

1015
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,200
Amen, amen.

1016
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,700
Come what sorrow can,

1017
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,200
it cannot countervail
the exchange of joy

1018
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,200
that one short minute
gives me in her sight.

1019
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,200
These violent delights
have violent ends,

1020
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,700
and in
their triumph die,

1021
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,200
like fire and powder,

1022
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,200
which as
they kiss consume.

1023
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,200
The sweetest honey
is loathsome

1024
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,700
in its own...

1025
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,200
Deliciousness.

1026
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,700
Deliciousness.

1027
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,700
And in the taste
confounds the...

1028
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,000
Appetite.

1029
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,300
Appetite.

1030
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,200
Therefore
love moderately...

1031
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,700
Long love doth so.

1032
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,600
Ah, here comes
the lady.

1033
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,800
O, so light a foot will ne'er
wear out the everlasting flint.

1034
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,700
Juliet!

1035
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,700
Good even to
my ghostly confessor.

1036
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,200
Romeo shall thank thee,
daughter, for us both.

1037
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,700
Ah, Juliet,

1038
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,900
if the measure of thy joy
be heaped like mine,

1039
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,700
that thy skill be
more to blazon it,

1040
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,200
then sweeten
with thy breath

1041
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,700
this neighbor air.

1042
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,700
They are but beggars
that can count their worth.

1043
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,200
But my true love is
grown to such excess,

1044
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,700
I cannot sum up
sum of half my wealth.

1045
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,200
Tsk tsk tsk!

1046
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,900
Come, come with me...

1047
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,800
We will make short work.

1048
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,300
For, by your leaves,

1049
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,300
you shall not
stay alone

1050
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,700
till holy church
incorporate two in one.
