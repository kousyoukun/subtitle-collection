1
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:28,591
Two households,
both alike in dignity,
"我们的故事发生在繁华的维洛纳城"

2
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:35,099
in fair Verona
where we lay our scene,

3
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,994
"那里有两大个家族，有相等的声望"

4
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:40,105
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,
"从宿仇中又有新的嫌怨爆发"

5
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:45,612
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.
"使得市民的血把清白的手弄脏"

6
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:49,909
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

7
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,886
"命中注定，从这两家仇人的肚里"

8
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:57,628
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life,

9
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,975
"生出一对命运多桀情人"

10
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:03,093
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows
"他们的不幸的悲惨的结局"

11
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:09,101
do with their death...
bury their parents'strife.
"埋葬了两家父母的纠纷"

12
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:32,131
But the quarrel is between
our masters and us their men.
这仇恨只是两家主人和男仆们之间的事

13
00:01:32,214 --> 00:01:34,425
Ah, 'tis all one.
都一样啦.

14
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,432
Here come the house
of the Montagues.

15
00:01:38,142 --> 00:01:41,562
那边，蒙泰鸠家的人来了.

16
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,603
Ah, good morrow.

17
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,522
Good morrow
to you, sir.
- 早安.
- 你早呀！先生.

18
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:48,610
Quarrel,
I will back thee.

19
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,112
Right.
找他们打架，我会在背后支持你.

20
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:51,822
Fail me not.
不要怕我逃跑.

21
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:55,910
来，上吧.

22
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:05,131
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?
你是在对我们咬你的大拇指吗？
先生

23
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:08,135
I do bite
my thumb, sir.

24
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:13,141
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?
我是在咬我的大拇指，先生.

25
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,220
你是冲着我们咬你的大拇指吗？
先…生

26
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:15,645
No, sir.
不是的！先生, 我不是对你们咬我的大拇指
先生

27
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:18,648
I do not bite my
thumb at you, sir,

28
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:21,152
but I do bite
my thumb, sir.
但是我是在咬我的大拇指，先生.

29
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,653
Do you quarrel, sir?
你想找打架吗，先生？

30
00:02:22,654 --> 00:02:28,119
Quarrel, sir?
No, no, no, sir.

31
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:29,361
打架，先生！不，先生

32
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:30,623
If you do, sir,
I am for you.
如果你想打架，先生
我可以奉陪

33
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:32,625
I serve as good
a man as you.
- 我伺候的主人一点也不比你们的差
- 不见得更好一些吧

34
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,626
No better?

35
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:35,921
Yes, better, sir.
是要更好一些

36
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,137
You lie.
你说谎.

37
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:56,154
Draw!

38
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,824
Draw if you be men!
- 拔出剑来，如果你们是男子汉！!
- 别忘记使用你那一手绝招！

39
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,742
Gregory, remember
thy swashing blow!

40
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,126
Kill the Capulets!
杀了凯布雷！

41
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:24,149
Part, fools!
Put up your swords!
蠢材！收起你们的剑！.
你们不知道你们干的是什么事！

42
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,152
You know not what you do!

43
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:28,154
The Prince hath
expressly forbid
公爵严禁在维洛纳的街上打斗

44
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:30,241
this bandying
in Verona streets!

45
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:32,160
Here come the Capulets!
凯布雷家的人来了！

46
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:37,667
Tybalt, Capulet's kinsman!
提伯特，凯布雷的亲戚

47
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,057
What, art thou drawn among
these heartless hinds?

48
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:51,237
怎么？你也拔剑参加这群怯懦的奴才们的打斗吗？

49
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,648
Turn thee, Benvolio.
Look upon thy death.
- 转过身来，宾瓦利，准备受死吧
- 我只是在维持和平.

50
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,149
I do but keep the peace.

51
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,651
Put up thy sword
收起你的剑
再不就来帮我把他们分开

52
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:01,071
or manage it
to part these men with me.

53
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:03,866
What, drawn
and talk of peace?
什么！拔出了剑还要谈和平？

54
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:05,369
I hate the word,

55
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:09,875
as I hate hell,
all Montagues and thee.
我讨厌这个名词，就如同恨地狱
恨蒙泰鸠一家人，恨你，完全一样

56
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,459
Have at thee, cowards!
- 看剑，懦夫！
- 凯布雷！

57
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,253
Capulet!

58
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,672
Montague!
蒙泰鸠！

59
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:19,178
Capulet!

60
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:29,858
Now hie thee home,
fragment.
- 现在，藏起你的头
- 恶棍！

61
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:32,278
You villain!

62
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,660
Capulet!

63
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,254
Give me my long sword! Ho!
把我的长剑给我，喂！
凯布雷！

64
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,673
Capulet!
下去到市场广场！

65
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:49,175
Down to the market square!

66
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,178
Capulet!

67
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:53,972
Follow me! Follow me!

68
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:57,686
Kill that villain Montague!
杀了那些恶棍蒙泰鸠！

69
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:03,067
My noble uncle!
My noble uncle!
伯父！…

70
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:04,861
What?

71
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:08,074
My sword! My sword!
什么？

72
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,775
我的剑！…

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,079
Thou shalt not stir
a foot to seek a foe!

74
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:13,030
不准你迈一步去寻仇！

75
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:16,084
Hold me not!
Let me go!
别拉着我！让我去！

76
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:18,087
Montague!

77
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:19,672
Montague!
蒙泰鸠！

78
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:21,174
Kill the villain!

79
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:49,001
I'll strike thee, coward.
我要好好教训你，懦夫

80
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:05,815
The Prince!

81
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,110
The Prince is coming!
Put down your weapons!
- 公爵来了！
- 放下你们的武器！

82
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,404
The Prince!

83
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,615
The Prince!

84
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,288
Here comes the Prince!
公爵来了！

85
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:19,499
Put your weapons down!
The Prince!

86
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:30,596
Rebellious subjects,
enemies to peace,
作乱的民众，治安的敌人

87
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:33,225
throw your mistempered
weapons to the ground...
快将你们的血腥的手里的凶器…

88
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,018
Down with your weapons.

89
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,526
And hear the sentence
of your moved Prince.
丢在地上

90
00:06:38,577 --> 00:06:42,205
听你们震怒的公爵的裁判

91
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:49,203
Three civil brawls
bred of an airy word,
你们只是为了几句话
便发生三次斗殴

92
00:06:49,204 --> 00:06:50,705
by thee, old Capulet...

93
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:52,416
No, no.
你老凯布雷…

94
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:58,299
And Montague...
和老蒙泰鸠…

95
00:06:58,424 --> 00:07:01,594
Have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.
三次扰乱街道上的和平

96
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,103
If ever you disturb
our streets again,
如果你们再破坏街道上的安宁

97
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,108
your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

98
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:13,946
你们就要以生命来赎罪

99
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:17,615
For this time
all the rest depart away!

100
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:18,910
至于这一次，其余的人都走开

101
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:23,706
You, Capulet,
shall go along with me.

102
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:24,790
你，凯布雷，你跟我来

103
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:26,210
And, Montague,
come you this afternoon.
而蒙泰鸠，你下午过来

104
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:36,640
Once more, on pain of death,
all men depart.
再说一遍，一切人等全都走开

105
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:38,346
否则处死

106
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:56,248
Where is Romeo?
Saw you him today?

107
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:59,711
Right glad I am
he was not at this fray.
罗蜜欧在哪里？
你今天看见他了吗？

108
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:01,078
我很高兴他没有赶上这场打斗

109
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:02,130
Madam, an hour before
the worshipped sun
夫人，在万人景仰的太阳
从东方金窗探头之前一小时

110
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,718
peered forth
the golden window of the east,

111
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:08,138
a troubled mind drove me
to walk abroad:

112
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,641
where, underneath
the grove of sycamore
我心里一阵烦躁
想起身出外散步

113
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:12,852
so early walking
did I see your son.
在城西一带的枫树林的下面
我看到你儿子一早就在那里走动

114
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:17,651
Towards him I made;
but he was ware of me,

115
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:18,720
我向他走去，但他发觉我了

116
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,653
and stole into
the cover of the wood.
就躲进林荫深处....

117
00:08:23,742 --> 00:08:27,621
Many a morning hath
he there been seen.
好几天一清早就有人在那里看见他

118
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,631
See, where he comes.

119
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:36,447
看，他来了

120
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,727
So please you, step aside.
请您暂且躲在旁处
我要问问他，看他究竟有些什么心事

121
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:48,231
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

122
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:51,235
I would thou wert
so happy by thy stay,
愿你运气好，能听到他的真心话

123
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:52,737
to hear true shrift.

124
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:55,241
Come, madam. Let's away.

125
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:56,886
来吧，夫人，我们走开吧！

126
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,159
Good morrow, cousin.

127
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:31,796
早安，表弟

128
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:36,042
Is the day so young?

129
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,878
But new struck nine.
- 现在还算早吗？
- 刚敲过九点

130
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,172
Ay me!
唉呀！

131
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:42,759
Sad hours seem long.
愁苦的时间似乎特别长

132
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:51,271
Was that my father
that went hence so fast?
从这里急忙走开的可是我的父亲？

133
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,772
Hmm?

134
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:54,274
It was.
是的

135
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:04,370
What sadness lengthens
Romeo's hours?

136
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:11,380
Not having that, which having
makes them short.
有什么愁苦的事使得罗密欧的时间显得长？

137
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:12,505
未能得到能使时间变短的东西

138
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:14,551
Hmm. Hmm!

139
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:16,261
But, Romeo...
- 但，罗蜜欧…
- 再见，表兄

140
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:18,389
Farewell, Coz.

141
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,781
God's me,
what fray was here?
唉啊，谁在这里打架了？
不用告诉我…

142
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,283
Yet tell me not,

143
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,287
for I have heard it all.
我已经全听说过了

144
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:43,796
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.
这场冲突与仇恨有关

145
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,593
Soft, I will go along.
但更大的冲突却是与爱情有关

146
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,667
且慢，我要和你一同去

147
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:56,271
But Montague is bound
as well as l,

148
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:59,094
但是蒙泰鸠和我一样均已保证不再扰乱治安
违犯时受同样的惩罚

149
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:59,274
in penalty alike,

150
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,277
and 'tis not hard, I think,

151
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:04,781
for men as old as we
to keep the peace.
我想，像我们这样年老的人
和平相处并不困难

152
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:05,783
Oh...

153
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:08,286
Of honorable reckoning
are you both,
你们二位都是德高望重的

154
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:11,790
and pity 'tis you
lived at odds so long:

155
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:14,194
这样久彼此不睦，实在是一件憾事

156
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,796
but, but now, my lord,

157
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:17,798
what say you to my suit?
不过，老伯…
你对我的请求，意下如何呢？

158
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:20,802
But saying o'er what
I have said before,
我还是重复我说过的那一句话

159
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:24,974
my child is yet
a stranger in the world.

160
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:26,039
小女尚不懂事

161
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,772
She hath not seen the change
of fourteen years.

162
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:30,877
她还不满十四岁呢

163
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:37,282
Let two more summers
wither in their pride,

164
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,200
'ere we may think her
ripe to be a bride.
再等两个夏季的花草变得焦黄
她才算得成熟，才好做新娘

165
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,996
Younger than she
are happy mothers made.
比她年轻的小姐们都已做了母亲

166
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,803
And too soon marred
are those so early made.
这样早就结婚的人实在是太早就被毁掉了

167
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,807
The earth hath swallowed
all my hopes but she,
我的儿女均已被黄土所埋葬

168
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,810
she is the hopeful lady
of my earth.

169
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:03,315
But woo her, gentle
Paris, get her heart,
只剩了她，是我唯一的指望

170
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:06,819
my will to her consent
is but a part.
向她求婚吧，好巴利斯，赢取她的心.
我是否同意要看她自己肯不肯

171
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,323
Oh, Peter!

172
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:12,785
This night I hold
an old accustomed feast
噢，彼得！

173
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:14,004
今晚我照例设宴款待来宾

174
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:15,289
whereto I have invited
many a guest.
邀请了许多我喜欢的客人
你，也是我的客人中的一个

175
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:18,292
Such as I love,
you among the store,

176
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:21,296
one more, most welcome,
makes my number more.
如蒙赏光，当令我的宴席生色

177
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,100
Nurse,
where's my daughter?

178
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:33,312
Call her forth to me.
奶妈，我的女儿在哪里？
叫她来见我

179
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:35,315
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,
我指着我12岁时的童贞来发誓
我已经叫过她了

180
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:36,816
I bade her come.

181
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,321
Where is the girl?
Juliet! Juliet!
这孩子哪里去了？
茱丽叶！…

182
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:44,534
Where is the girl?
Juliet!
这孩子哪里去了？茱丽叶！

183
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:48,831
Where is the girl? Juliet!
茱丽叶！这个孩子哪里去了？

184
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:49,333
茱丽叶！

185
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,335
How now, who calls?

186
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,421
Your mother!
Your lady mother!
- 什么事，谁在叫呢？
- 你的妈妈，你的亲娘！

187
00:13:05,312 --> 00:13:08,315
Juliet, it's your mother,
your lady mother.
你的妈妈，你的亲娘！

188
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,317
Make haste, girl.
Make haste.
快点，孩子，快点…
你在哪？

189
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:12,111
Where were you?

190
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:18,328
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?
妈妈，我在这里
你找我？

191
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:20,831
This is the matter.

192
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,701
是一件大事

193
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,337
Make haste, girls.
Come on, come on.
- 快点，女孩们，快点…
- 奶妈

194
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,421
Nurse, um...

195
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:29,217
give leave awhile,
we must talk in secret.
你暂且离开一下
我们要私下里谈一谈

196
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:39,813
Nurse, come back again.
I have remembered me.
奶妈，你回来，我想起来了

197
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:43,318
Thou's hear our counsel.

198
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:45,321
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.
你要听听我们的谈话.
你知道我的女儿年纪不算小了

199
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:47,323
I can tell her age
unto an hour.
- 当然，讲到她的年纪，我可以按钟头计算出来
- 她未满十四岁

200
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:48,742
She's not fourteen.

201
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:50,744
I'll lay fourteen
of my teeth.
我用我的十四颗牙齿打赌

202
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,747
And yet to
my teen be it spoke,
说来好惨我只剩四颗了，她未满十四岁
现在离收获节还有多久？

203
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,750
I have but four,
she's not fourteen.

204
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,418
How long is it
to Lammastide?

205
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,254
A fortnight and odd days.
- 还有二个星期零几天
- 零一天也好零两天也好

206
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,632
Even or odd, of all
the days of the year,

207
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,635
come Lammas Eve at night
shall she be fourteen.
只要到了收获节的前夕，她就满了十四岁

208
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,136
Susan and she--
苏珊和她....
"愿上帝安息一切信仰基督的灵魂"....是同龄

209
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,639
God rest all Christian
souls were of an age.

210
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:09,143
Well, Susan is with God.
She was too good for me.
唉，苏珊现在是和上帝在一起了
像她这样的好孩子我无福消受

211
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:11,020
But, as I said,
on Lammas Eve

212
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:13,232
at night
shall she be fourteen.
不过，我才说过，
到了收获节的前夕她就是十四岁了

213
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,443
That shall she, marry!
I remember it well.
她满十四岁，真是的，我记得清清楚楚

214
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:19,156
My lord and you
were then at Mantua!
当时老爷和您都在曼酋亚
哼，我的记性不坏

215
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,743
Nay, I do bear a brain.

216
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:24,246
For then she could,
she could stand high lone.
那时候她已经能独自站起来

217
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:27,249
Nay, by the road she could have
run and waddled all about,
岂止站起来，我敢发誓，她能到处跑了

218
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,253
for even the day before
she broke her brow;
就在那前一天，她跌破了头皮

219
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:34,133
and then my husband-- God rest his soul,
'a were a merry man--
随后我的丈夫...."愿上帝守护他的灵魂"
他是个老好人

220
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:35,635
took up the child.
就把孩子抱起来了

221
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:39,265
"Yea," quoth he,
"dost thou fall upon thy face?

222
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:41,156
对了，他说"你向前扑倒了？"

223
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:42,143
"Thou wilt fall backward
when thou hast more wit;

224
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,228
wilt thou not, Jule?"
你将来更懂事一些的时候，
将会仰面向后倒哩，你会不会

225
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:45,231
Nurse!

226
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,732
And by my holiday,
哎啊我的圣母
这小东西停住了哭，说"我会"

227
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:49,236
the pretty wretch left
crying and said, "Ay."

228
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:56,245
Enough of this,
I pray thee hold thy peace.
- 够了，请你别说了
- 是的，夫人

229
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:58,874
Yes, madam.

230
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:02,544
Now, Juliet.

231
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:03,680
现在，茱丽叶

232
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:06,675
God mark thee to His grace

233
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,138
Thou was the prettiest babe
that 'er I nurs'd.
愿上帝特别祝福你

234
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:12,272
你是我奶过的最漂亮的孩子

235
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:12,140
And I might live to see
thee married once,

236
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:14,143
I have my wish.
如果我能活到看着你结婚
我就心满意足了

237
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:20,651
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
I came to talk of.

238
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:21,531
说的是啊，我来正是要谈这结婚的问题

239
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:21,945
Tell me,
daughter Juliet,
告诉我，茱丽叶我的孩子
你对于婚事有什么意见？

240
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,157
how stands your disposition
to be married?

241
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:35,254
It is an honor
that I dream not of.
- 那是我作梦也没想到的光荣
- 光荣

242
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:37,757
An honor, were I not
thy only nurse,

243
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:40,677
I would say thou hadst sucked
wisdom from my teat.
如果我不是你唯一的奶妈
我要说，你的智慧是从奶头上得来的

244
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:43,264
Well, think
of marriage now.
好了，现在想一想结婚的事
在这维洛纳，比你年轻....

245
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:46,267
Younger than you, here in Verona,
ladies of esteem,

246
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:47,769
are made
already mothers.
有名望的小姐们
都已经做了母亲

247
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,273
By my count
I was your mother

248
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:53,276
much upon these years
that you are now a maid.
我在你如今做小姐的年龄
已经做了你的母亲

249
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:54,778
Oh, yes, I remember.
- 是了，我记得
- 那么简单说吧

250
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,574
Thus then, in brief...

251
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:00,578
the valiant Paris
seeks you for his love.

252
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:05,667
A man, young lady!
Lady, such as all the world--
- 英勇的巴利斯要向你求爱
- 真是个好男人，小姐

253
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:07,670
Why he's a man of wax.
小姐，这个人是世界少有…
噢，他是个完人

254
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:09,673
Verona's summer hath
not such a flower.
- 维洛纳的夏天不曾有过这样的一朵花
- 唉，他是一朵花

255
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:11,675
Nay, he's
a flower in faith.

256
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,177
Shh.

257
00:16:13,261 --> 00:16:18,183
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?

258
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:19,258
你怎么说？
你能不能爱这个人？

259
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,562
Madam! Madam!
夫人…

260
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,690
The guests have come,
supper serv'd up,
客人到齐了，晚餐也上好了
大家在请您，也问起小姐...

261
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,860
you call'd,
my young lady ask'd for!

262
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,197
We follow.
我们就去

263
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,285
Speak briefly,
can you like of Paris' love?

264
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:33,772
简单说
你是否接受巴利斯的爱情？

265
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:37,792
I'll look to like,
if looking liking move.

266
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:39,570
看看再说，也许他能把我感动

267
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:41,296
But no more deep
will I endart mine eye,

268
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:42,531
但是我的眼光也不会投射太深

269
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:44,300
than your consent gives
strength to make it fly.
除非是先得到了你的允许

270
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:50,767
Juliet, the county stays.
- 茱丽叶，伯爵在等候
- 妈妈，我来了

271
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,268
Madam, I come.

272
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:58,777
Go, girl, seek happy nights
for happy days.
去，孩子，白天享福，夜间也要享受

273
00:17:21,014 --> 00:17:24,476
Give me a case
to put my visage in;
给我一个面具罩上我的脸

274
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,479
a visor for a visor.
丑脸人都要嫌弃的丑面具

275
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:31,194
What care I what curious eye
doth quote deformities.

276
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,166
我何必介意
如果有人好奇的注意看我这一副丑态

277
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,698
Here are the beetle-brows
shall blush for me.
也还有这个突出的鬼脸替我遮羞

278
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:36,283
Ahh!

279
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,706
What, shall this speech
be spoke for our excuse?
怎么样，我们就拿这一套话做为藉口
还是根本不带歉意昂然而入？

280
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,792
Or shall we on
without apology?

281
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,585
The date is out
of such prolixity.
这种累赘的虚文已经过时了
随便他们把我们当做什么人

282
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:46,504
Let them measure us
by what they will.

283
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:48,800
We'll measure them
a measure and be gone.
别想太多，我们跳他们一场舞就走

284
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,803
Come, knock and enter,
and no sooner in,

285
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:55,600
but every man
betake him to his legs.
来吧，敲门进去，一进去之后
每个人都立刻就跳

286
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:58,312
And we mean well in
going to this masque,
我们到这舞会，用意当然很好

287
00:17:58,312 --> 00:17:59,688
but 'tis no wit to go.
- 但是最好不要去
- 为什么？我要讨教？

288
00:17:59,814 --> 00:18:01,524
Why, may one ask?

289
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:05,696
I dreamt a dream tonight.

290
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:07,490
Ho, and so did I.
- 昨晚我做了一个梦
- 噢，我也是

291
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:11,120
Well, what was yours?

292
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:14,499
That dreamers often lie.
啊，你梦见了什么？

293
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,544
做梦的人常胡言乱语

294
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:19,214
In bed asleep while they
do dream things true.
在睡觉时可以梦见真实的东西

295
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:22,801
Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.

296
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,511
噢…那么"仙姑"必曾和你在一起

297
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:25,513
Queen Mab?

298
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:31,104
She is...She is
the fairies' midwife.
仙姑！她是谁？

299
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,808
她是…

300
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:33,271
她是…一个小仙的接生婆

301
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:34,233
And she comes in state
她的身体不比一位市议员…

302
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:36,736
no bigger than
an agate stone

303
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:38,697
on the forefinger
of an alderman,
食指上戴的一块玛瑙为大

304
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:42,035
drawn with a team
of little atomies

305
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:45,330
athwart men's noses
as they lie asleep.
乘人睡觉的时候
驾着微尘般的小马拖曳的车子越过人们的鼻梁

306
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:50,336
Her wagon spokes are made
of long spinner's legs;

307
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,706
她的车辐是长脚蜘蛛的腿做的

308
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,841
and the cover,
of the wings of grasshoppers;
车篷是蚱蜢的翅膀做的

309
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:58,306
the traces
of the smallest spider's web;

310
00:18:56,086 --> 00:19:00,007
挽索是小蜘蛛网丝做的

311
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:04,230
and the collars, mmm,
of the moonshine's watery beams;

312
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:05,971
轭圈是水一般的月光做的

313
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:06,733
her whip, crack!

314
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:10,822
Is a cricket's bone;
the lash of film;
她的鞭子是蟋蟀的骨头做的

315
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,727
鞭绳是游丝做的

316
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:13,241
and in this state
用这样的排场
她夜夜的在情人的脑子里奔驰

317
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:15,912
she gallops night by night
through lovers' brains,

318
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:19,416
and then they dream of love,

319
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:20,360
于是他们便做起了爱情梦

320
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:23,921
o'er ladies' lips,
who straight on kisses dream,
走过女人的嘴唇
她们便立刻梦到接吻

321
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:29,428
which oft the angry Mab
with blisters plagues,

322
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:30,454
可是发怒的仙姑
常使她们的嘴上生疮

323
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:32,433
because their breaths
with, er,
因为他们的口里沾染了糖果的气息

324
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:33,934
sweetmeats tainted are.

325
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:37,439
Snd sometime comes she
with a tithe-pig's tail,
有时候她在牧师睡觉之际

326
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:40,443
tickling the parson's nose
as he lies asleep,
用抵租税的猪尾巴来搔他的鼻孔

327
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:45,658
and dreams he
of another benefice.
于是他梦到一个更肥的牧师职位

328
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:49,454
Amen.

329
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:51,142
阿....门

330
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,835
Sometimes she driveth
o'er a soldier's neck,
有时候她经过一个士兵的脖子

331
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:55,337
and then dreams he

332
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:58,842
of cutting foreign throats,
of breaches,
于是他梦到砍外国人的头
梦到突破工事

333
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:02,054
ambuscadoes, spanish blades,
drums in his ear,
埋伏，梦到西班牙制的利剑
然后忽然听见鼓声

334
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:03,555
at which he starts and wakes;
从梦中惊醒，惊醒之后....

335
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:07,060
and being thus frighted
tries a prayer or two...

336
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:09,119
咒骂了两句

337
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:14,528
and sleeps again.
然后又睡着了

338
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,531
This is that very Mab

339
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:19,534
that plaits the manes
of horses in the night,
就是这仙姑
在夜间把马鬃编成辫结

340
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:23,540
and bakes the elf-locks
in foul sluttish hairs,

341
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:24,426
使得肮脏的女人的头发结成乌糟的一团

342
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,169
which once untangled
much misfortune bodes.
这缠结便将是不祥之兆

343
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:31,550
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs,

344
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:32,851
就是这妖婆，在少女仰着睡的时候

345
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:35,055
that presses them
and learns them first to bear
压在她们身上，教她们如何受孕

346
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:39,560
making them women
of good carriage.

347
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:39,734
使她们成为善于生育的妇人

348
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:41,354
This is she...

349
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:44,567
This is she that...
就是她…就是她…

350
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:48,364
This...is she.
就是…

351
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:58,043
Peace, Mercutio, peace.
别说了，马丘修，别说了

352
00:20:58,168 --> 00:21:00,546
Thou talk'st of nothing.
你是在胡说

353
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:05,051
Thou talk'st of nothing.

354
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,802
你是在胡说

355
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:09,265
True.

356
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:13,562
True, I talk of dreams;
是啊！我是在说梦

357
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:17,568
which are the children
of an idle brain...

358
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,483
梦原是无聊的头脑之胡思乱想…

359
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,575
Begot of nothing
but vain fantasy;

360
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,946
只是空虚的幻想的产物

361
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:28,081
which is as thin
of substance as the air,
其本质如空气一般的稀薄

362
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:31,084
and more inconstant
than the wind

363
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:32,371
比风还不稳定

364
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:34,590
who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north,
刚刚投向北方的冰冻的胸怀

365
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:38,552
and being angered
puffs away from thence,

366
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:39,754
忽然不高兴了，气冲冲的走开了

367
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:41,556
turning his side
to the dew-dropping south.
转脸走向雨露繁多的南方

368
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:50,067
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves.
你所说的这风把我们吹得离题太远了

369
00:21:50,193 --> 00:21:54,072
Strike drum.
Come, lusty gentlemen.
打起鼓来

370
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:55,020
走，诸位英豪

371
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:02,458
Romeo, we shall
arrive too late.
罗蜜欧，我们再不去就太迟了

372
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:06,964
I fear too early...
我恐怕还是太早

373
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:11,095
For my mind misgives...
因我有一种预感
某种悬而未决的厄运…

374
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:14,599
Some consequence,
yet hanging in the stars,

375
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,563
shall bitterly begin
his fearful date

376
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,006
将在今晚狂欢的时候开始它的悲惨的程途

377
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:22,067
with this night's revels,

378
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:25,070
and expire the term
of a despised life
而我这可憎恨的生命

379
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:28,074
closed in my breast,

380
00:22:28,075 --> 00:22:33,081
by some vile forfeit
of untimely death.
将以夭折结束我这不幸的一生

381
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:41,592
But he that hath
the steerage of my course...
但是我的命运事由上帝支配的

382
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:45,597
Direct my sail.
让k指引我的前途吧…

383
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:54,609
Enter my poor house.
Vido, vido, welcome.
欢迎光临寒舍

384
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:59,573
Oh, my lovely Helena,
my lovely niece.

385
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,962
噢，我亲爱的艾莲娜
我亲爱的侄女

386
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:02,494
Welcome all!
Be merry, gentlemen.
欢迎所有人来做我的客人！

387
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:05,497
Be lively, ladies.
Ahoy! Ahoy!
及时行乐，绅士们
开心一点，女士们！

388
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:06,999
Welcome, gentlemen.
欢迎，诸位先生

389
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,502
I have seen the day
that I have worn a visor
想当年我也曾戴过假面具

390
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:12,005
and could tell a whispering tale
in a fair lady's ear,
在漂亮的小姐耳边低声说些讨她欢喜的话

391
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,591
such as would please.

392
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,595
'Tis gone, 'tis gone.
You are welcome, gentlemen.
这是过去的事了，过去的事了

393
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,598
Ladies, ho, ho!
欢迎你们，诸位先生
小姐们

394
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:03,559
She doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

395
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,069
啊！她比满堂的火炬还要亮

396
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:08,357
It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night
她好像是挂在黑夜的颊上

397
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:11,569
as a rich jewel
in an Ethiop's ear;,

398
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:13,452
有如黑人戴的宝石耳坠

399
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:17,160
beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

400
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:19,084
平时不宜戴，在尘世也嫌太宝贵

401
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:22,667
So shows a snowy dove
trooping with crows,
那位小姐在她的伴侣中间

402
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:27,256
as yonder lady
o'er her fellow shows.

403
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:28,093
像乌鸦中的白鸽那么鲜艳

404
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:34,474
Did my heart love till now?
以前我可曾恋爱过？
否掳桑我的眼！

405
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,062
Forswear it sight,

406
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:42,443
for I ne'er saw true beauty
till this night.

407
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:44,401
真正的美人我今晚才初次看见

408
00:26:51,162 --> 00:26:53,373
This by his voice
should be a Montague.
听他的声音，一定是蒙泰鸠家的人

409
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,055
Uncle, this is
a Montague, our foe;

410
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,057
a villain that is
hither come in spite,
舅父，这是蒙泰鸠家的人
我们的仇敌

411
00:27:07,183 --> 00:27:09,060
to scorn at
our solemnity this night.
这坏人到这里来捣乱
存心破坏我们今晚的盛宴

412
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:10,686
Young Romeo is it?
年轻的罗蜜欧，是不是？

413
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:13,065
Dares the slave come hither
covered in an antic face,

414
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:14,984
to fear and scorn
at our solemnity?
这奴才胆敢闯到这里来
来嘲弄我们的盛宴吗？

415
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:17,070
'A bears him like
a courtly gentleman;
维洛纳全城都夸奖他
说他是一个端正严谨的青年

416
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:19,073
and to say truth,
Verona brags of him

417
00:27:19,156 --> 00:27:21,075
to be a virtuous
and well managed youth.

418
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:23,078
I would not for the wealth
of all this town
就是把全城的财富都给我
我也不愿在我的家里使他难堪

419
00:27:23,162 --> 00:27:25,081
here in my house
do him disparagement.

420
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:27,458
Therefore have patience,
take no note of him.
所以你要忍耐一下，不必理会他

421
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:30,087
The Moureska!
舞曲开始！舞曲开始！

422
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:31,589
The Moureska!

423
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:08,087
Why, Uncle,
'tis a shame!

424
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:09,589
Go to.
- 唉，舅父？这是耻辱！
- 胡说！…

425
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,093
You are a saucy boy.

426
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:14,596
You'll make a mutiny
among my guests!
你真是个狂傲无知的孩子

427
00:29:14,596 --> 00:29:17,099
Am I the master here,
or you?
你想当着我的宾客公然反抗我吗？
在这里我是主人，还是你当主人？

428
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:18,600
I will not endure him.
- 我不能容忍他
- 你不能容忍他？

429
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:20,812
You will not endure!
He shall be endured!

430
00:29:20,813 --> 00:29:22,314
Or I know what!
必须容忍他！
我晓得了！

431
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:27,111
Well said, my hearts.
好极了，诸位

432
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:38,126
You're a princox.

00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,295
Be quiet or...
你是一个冒失鬼

434
00:29:39,874 --> 00:29:41,918
别胡闹，否则…

435
00:29:41,923 --> 00:29:43,299
Ah.

436
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:50,100
For shame!
I'll make you quiet.
真难为情，我要强迫你稍安勿躁

437
00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:59,730

00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:02,317
Leonardo, I pray thee, sing.
李奥纳多要唱歌了！

439
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:03,668
李奥纳多，请唱

440
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:16,919

青春是什么？

441
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:20,758
Impetuous fire

00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:24,720

少女是什么？

00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:28,059
Ice and desire

444
00:31:28,142 --> 00:31:31,563
The world wags on
年华如此迁移下去。

445
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:36,028
A rose will bloom
玫瑰会盛开

446

So does the fairest maid
最美的少女亦复如此

467
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:39,185
If I profane
with my unworthiest hand

468
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:40,955
如果我的这一双贱手冒犯了

469
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,688
this holy shrine,

470
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:44,901
the gentle sin is this;
这座神龛，赎罪的方法是这样的

471
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:51,075
my lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand

472
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:51,925
我的双唇，两个赧颜的信徒，已准备好

473
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:58,001
to smooth the rough touch
with a gentle kiss.

474
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:58,848
用轻轻一吻来消除那粗糙接触的痕迹

475
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:00,379
Oh.

476
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:20,697
Good pilgrim, you do wrong
your hand too much
好信徒，你怪罪你的手也未免太苛

477
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:24,702
which mannerly devotion
shows in this;

478
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:25,668
它这举动只是表示虔诚的信心

479
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:29,208
for saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch

480
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:31,382
因为圣人的手也许信徒去抚摸

481
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:34,213
and palm to palm is
holy palmers' kiss.

482
00:34:31,507 --> 00:34:35,344
手掌接触手掌便是信徒们的接吻

483
00:34:34,298 --> 00:34:38,177
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?
圣人与信徒难道没有嘴唇？

484
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:42,182
Ay, pilgrim, lips that
they must use in prayer.
有的，信徒，在祈祷时才有用场

485
00:34:42,308 --> 00:34:43,684
Oh...

486
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,689
O then, dear saint,
噢…那么，亲爱的圣人

487
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:52,195
let lips do
what hands do...
手的工作让嘴唇来担任

488
00:34:57,286 --> 00:35:02,709
They pray,
grant thou,
它们在求，请答应吧

489
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:05,212
lest faith
turn to despair.
否则信仰变成失望

490
00:35:05,212 --> 00:35:07,214
Saints do not move,
圣人是不为人所动的
虽然有求必应

491
00:35:07,215 --> 00:35:09,217
though grants
for prayers' sake.

492
00:35:09,218 --> 00:35:11,220
Then move not...
那么你不要动

493
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:18,229
While my prayer's
effect I take.

494
00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:19,599
你的回答我亲自来领

495
00:35:20,816 --> 00:35:27,699
Thus from my lips,
by thine,
这样用你的嘴唇

496
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:31,412
my sin is purged.
把我嘴唇上的罪过洗净了

497
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,221
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.
可是你的罪恶沾染上了我的嘴唇

498
00:35:45,306 --> 00:35:47,225
Sin from my lips!
我嘴唇上的罪恶？啊你抱怨得可真妙！

499
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:49,227
O trespass sweetly urged!

500
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:52,231
Give me my sin again.

501
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:53,926
把我的罪恶还给我

502
00:35:54,025 --> 00:35:58,739
A rose will bloom
玫瑰会盛开

503
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,035
It then will fade
然后会凋萎

504
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:08,126
So does a youth
青春也是

505
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:21,143
So does the fairest maid
最美的少女亦复如此

506
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:31,239
Juliet!

507
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:33,951
Lady Juliet!
- 茱丽叶！茱丽叶小姐！
- 奶妈？

508
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:35,619
Nurse?

509
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:38,415
Your mother craves
a word with you.
你的妈妈要和你说句话

510
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:43,922
Make haste, make haste!
快点…

511
00:36:48,845 --> 00:36:50,221
What is her mother?
她的妈妈是谁？

512
00:36:50,347 --> 00:36:51,723

and a good lady,
and wise, and virtuous;
是一位又宽厚又精明又贤慧的太太

515
00:36:57,857 --> 00:37:00,235
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.
你方才和她谈话的那位小姐
就是她的女儿，是由我奶大的

516
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,319
Hmm.

517
00:37:07,244 --> 00:37:10,247
I tell you he that
shall lay hold of her
我告诉你吧，谁要是能X到她
谁就可以得到她的家财

518

519
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:18,258
Is she a Capulet?

520
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,513
她是凯布雷家里的人吗？

521

Ah, dear account!
噢，我的天啊！

522
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:26,059
My life is my foe's debt.

523
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:27,939
我的性命落入敌人的手心

524
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:33,944
What, ho, my mistresses?
什么，我的女仕们？

525

What, will you be gone?
什么？你们要走了？

526
00:37:35,864 --> 00:37:38,242
It seems so, poor God,
it is so very late.

527
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:40,536
We'll call it early,
by and by.

00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:49,256
Come hither, nurse.

Hmm?
你过来，奶妈。那位先生是谁？

Count Paris.

534
00:37:54,346 --> 00:37:57,850
No. What's he
that follows there?

- 不，现在跟随他们走着的是谁？

535
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:01,647
Oh! I know not.

536

Go, ask his name.

My only love sprung
from my only hate,

542
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:28,584
我竟为了我唯一嫉恨的人而倾倒

543
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:33,271
too early seen unknown,
and known too late!

544
00:38:30,544 --> 00:38:34,674
当初不该遇到他，现在又嫌太晚了

545
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:36,775
Oh!

546

Prodigious birth of love
it is to me
我这一段爱情，结果怕不吉利

Romeo!

560
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,803
Romeo!

561
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:35,767
Romeo!

562
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:38,271
Romeo!

563
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:39,898
Romeo!

564
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:42,276
Romeo!
罗蜜欧！

565
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:45,279
Romeo!

- Romeo!
罗蜜欧！

568
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,793
He is wise,
他真聪明，我敢说
他必是偷偷回去睡觉了

569
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:59,006
and on my life hath
stolen him home to bed.

570
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:00,298
He leaped
this orchard wall.
他跳进花园墙里去了
喊他！好马丘修

571
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:01,509
Call, good Mercutio.

572
00:40:01,593 --> 00:40:02,802
Romeo!

573
00:40:06,098 --> 00:40:07,975
Romeo! Passion! Lover!
罗蜜欧！痴人！疯子！爱人

574
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:10,604
O-hooo! Madman!

575
00:40:10,604 --> 00:40:12,982
O-hooo! Romeo!

576
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:17,112
He heareth not,
he stirreth not, he moveth not.

577
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:17,906
他没听见，他没有声响

578
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:18,697
The ape is dead.
他没有动静，这猴子死了

579
00:40:18,698 --> 00:40:24,580
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.

580
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:25,163
没受过伤的人才讥笑别人的疤

581
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,292
Romeo, it's all right.
罗蜜欧，没关系

582
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:32,214
But soft,
小声些！

583
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:36,387
what light through
yonder window breaks?

584
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:38,718
窗口那边透出的是什么光亮？

585
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:05,090
It is my lady,

586
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:10,222
oh, it is my love.
是我的小姐

587
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:10,459
啊，是我的爱人

588
00:41:10,222 --> 00:41:12,099
Oh...

589
00:41:12,225 --> 00:41:15,729
O that she knew she were.

590
00:41:15,729 --> 00:41:19,233
She speaks,
yet she says nothing.
啊，我但愿她知道她是我的爱人

591
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:21,403
What of that?
她说话了，又好像是没说什么
那又有什么关系？

592
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:27,702
Her eye discourses,
I will answer it.
她的眼睛在说话，我要回答他

593
00:41:27,828 --> 00:41:30,706
I am too bold,
我太鲁莽了
她不是在对我说话

594
00:41:30,832 --> 00:41:33,710
'tis not to me she speaks.

595
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:38,216
Two of the fairest stars
in all the heavens,

596
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:39,698
天上两颗最灿烂的星

597
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,721
having some business,
do entreat her eyes

598
00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:43,160
因公外出，在归位之前

599
00:41:41,804 --> 00:41:45,725
to twinkle in their spheres
till they return.
央求她的眼睛代替它们在星座中闪烁

600
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:48,813
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.
看！她手托香腮的样儿有多么的俏

601
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:52,318
Oh, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

602
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,946
that I might touch
that cheek.
啊！我愿化身为她手上的一只手套
那样便可抚摸她的香腮了

603
00:41:56,824 --> 00:41:58,534
Ay me!
- 哎呀！
- 她说话了

604
00:41:58,618 --> 00:42:00,620
She speaks.

605
00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:09,423
Oh, speak again,
bright angel.

606
00:42:07,602 --> 00:42:10,313
啊！再说下去，光明的天使

607
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:14,220
O Romeo, Romeo,

608
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:13,733
啊罗蜜欧！罗蜜欧！

609
00:42:14,221 --> 00:42:17,725
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

610
00:42:15,944 --> 00:42:19,113
你为什么是罗蜜欧？

611
00:42:17,725 --> 00:42:22,814
Deny thy father,
and refuse thy name.

612
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:23,826
否履愕母盖祝放弃你的姓氏

613
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:26,820
Or if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

614
00:42:25,286 --> 00:42:28,414
如果你不肯
那么你只消发誓做我的爱人

615
00:42:26,946 --> 00:42:29,240
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

616
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,741
Shall I hear more,
- 我便不再是一个凯布雷家的人
- 我听下去呢，还是就此开始说话？

617
00:42:30,742 --> 00:42:32,744
or shall I speak at this?

618
00:42:32,828 --> 00:42:34,747
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.
只是你的姓氏成为我的仇敌

619
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:38,544
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.
你就是不姓蒙泰鸠，你还是你自己

620
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,840
What is Montague?
蒙泰鸠是什么？

621
00:42:44,343 --> 00:42:49,850
It is nor hand nor foot,
nor arm nor face

622
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:50,729
不是手，不是脚，不是臂，不是脸

623
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:53,729
nor any other part
belonging to a man.

624
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:55,067
也不是人身上任何其他一部分

625
00:42:53,855 --> 00:42:56,942
O be some other name.

626
00:42:55,818 --> 00:42:57,903
啊！换另外一个姓吧！

627
00:42:58,862 --> 00:43:00,948
What's in a name?

628
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:03,450
That which we call a rose
姓算得什么？

629
00:43:03,534 --> 00:43:06,537
by any other name
would smell as sweet;
我们所谓的玫瑰，换个名字，还是一样的香

630
00:43:06,538 --> 00:43:10,167
so Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,

631
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:12,754
retain that dear perfection
所以罗蜜欧，如果不叫罗密欧

632
00:43:12,754 --> 00:43:15,757
which he owes
without that title.
名字虽然换掉，依旧可以保持他的那份优秀

633
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:19,263
Romeo, doff thy name,

634
00:43:17,674 --> 00:43:20,302
罗蜜欧，放弃你那个名姓

635
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,266
and for that name
which is no part of thee,
那姓名本不是你的一部分
为弥补这名姓的损失请把我整个自己拿了去吧

636
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,353
take all myself.

637
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:29,442
I'll take thee
at thy word.
我就依照你的话了

638
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:31,444
Call me but love,
and I'll be new baptized;
只要你称我为爱人，我就算是取了新的命字

639
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,740
henceforth I never
will be Romeo.

640
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:38,245
What man art thou,
that thus bescreened in night
此后我再也不是罗蜜欧了

641
00:43:36,777 --> 00:43:40,865
你是什么人，躲在黑夜里，偷听我的秘密？

642
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:39,956
so stumblest
on my counsel?

643
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:43,877
By a name I know not how to
tell thee who I am.
我不知道应该怎样告诉你我姓甚名谁

644
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:45,754
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself,
我的名姓，亲爱的圣人
我自己都恨，因为这名姓是你的仇敌

645
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:47,173
because it is
an enemy to thee.

646
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:50,052
Had I it written,
I would tear the word.
如果我写出来，我会把那个字撕碎

647
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:55,266
My ears have not yet drunk
我的耳朵吸进你说的字尚不满百

648
00:43:55,351 --> 00:43:58,271
a hundred words
of that tongue's utterance,

649
00:43:58,355 --> 00:44:00,274
yet I know the sound.
但是我已辨出那个声音
你不是罗蜜欧，蒙泰鸠家的人吗？

650
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:03,360
Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?

651
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:05,863
Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.
都不是，美丽的小姐
如果你都不喜欢的话

652
00:44:05,948 --> 00:44:08,659
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me and wherefore?
告诉我，你怎样来到此地的
并且为什么？

653
00:44:08,785 --> 00:44:11,163
The orchard walls are
high and hard to climb,
花园的墙高峻难爬

654
00:44:11,246 --> 00:44:13,582
and the place death,
considering who thou art,
而且这地方是致命的
如果我的任何一位家人在此地发现了你

655
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:16,169
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

656
00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:17,753
With love's light wings
用爱情的轻翅我翻过了这高墙

657
00:44:17,754 --> 00:44:19,756
did I o'er perch
these walls,

658
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,260
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,
因为石头做的藩篱挡不住爱

659
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,263
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.
爱人能做到的事我都有胆量去做

660
00:44:25,264 --> 00:44:27,057
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me.
所以你的家人也挡不住我

661
00:44:27,058 --> 00:44:28,184
Sshhh!

662
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,273
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee.

663
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:37,780
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their eyes.
如果他们看见你，会杀死你

664
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:37,923
我有黑夜遮盖，他们看不到我

665
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,783
And but thou love me...

666
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:43,428
只要你爱我…

667
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:44,580
Let them find me here
让他们在此地看到我也无妨
在他门的仇恨之中结束我的生命

668
00:44:44,664 --> 00:44:47,584
my life were better
ended by their hate,

669
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:50,963
than death prorogued,
wanting of thy love.
也比得不到你的爱而苟延残喘要好一些

670
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:55,761
Dost thou love me?

671
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:58,973
I know thou wilt say ay,
and I will take thy word;
你爱我吗？
我知道你会说"是"，我相信你的话

672
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:00,475
yet if thou swearest,
可是如果你发誓，你可能是虚伪的

673
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:01,894
thou mayst prove false;

674
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:06,400
at lovers' perjuries
they say jove laughs.

675
00:45:03,491 --> 00:45:06,786
对于情人们的伪誓
据说，天神也只好一笑置之

676
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:08,695
O gentle Romeo,

677
00:45:08,778 --> 00:45:13,867
if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.
啊！温柔的罗蜜欧

678
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:15,545
如果你真爱我，老老实实的说

679
00:45:13,993 --> 00:45:16,704
Or if thou thinkest
I am too quickly won,

680
00:45:16,788 --> 00:45:20,292
I'll frown and be perverse,
and say thee nay,
如果你以为我是得来太易

681
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,135
我就会皱着眉头板起面孔拒绝你

682
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:23,671
so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world.
你好继续追求，否则的话，我绝不肯这样做

683
00:45:23,797 --> 00:45:28,886
In truth, fair Montague,
I am too fond...

684
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:29,560
老实说，英俊的蒙泰鸠，我实在太痴心

685
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:38,027
也许你因此以为我太轻佻
但是相信我，先生

686
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:42,781
我会证明我比那些假装冷淡的人更为真诚

687
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,496
我应该再冷淡一些，我必须承

688
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:54,544
但是你在我不提防的时候偷听到我的真情

689
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,547
所以原谅我吧

690
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:03,261
不要以为我的委身相爱是由于轻狂
实在是黑夜泄漏了我的爱情

691
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:09,017
- 小姐，我指着那圣洁的月亮发誓
- 啊！不要指着月亮发誓

692
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:14,940
月亮变化无常，每月有圆有缺

693
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:20,195
你的爱也会发生变化

694
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:23,990
- 那我指着什么发誓呢？
- 根本不要发誓

695
00:46:26,327 --> 00:46:28,079
如果你一定要发誓

696
00:46:29,038 --> 00:46:33,793
就指着你优美的自身起誓好了
那是我崇拜的偶像

697
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:36,462
我会相信你的

698
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:41,050
如果我心里的这一段情爱…我发誓…

699
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,363
亲爱的，晚安

700
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:06,493
这爱情的蓓蕾
经过夏日的薰风吹拂

701
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:10,497
等我们下次见面时
会变成一朵美丽的花

702
00:47:16,962 --> 00:47:20,716
再会！再会！

703
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:27,306
愿我心上的舒适安详
同样的来到你的心上

704
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:37,066
啊！不给我一点满足就让我走吗？

705
00:47:37,942 --> 00:47:40,904
你今晚能有什么样的满足呢？

706
00:47:41,154 --> 00:47:44,449
你还没有说出你的爱情的忠诚的誓约和我交换呢

707
00:47:56,461 --> 00:48:00,131
在你还没有要求的时候我已经把我的誓言给你了

708
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:03,927
但是我愿我还没有给过你

709
00:48:05,846 --> 00:48:09,475
你想收回你的誓言？为什么，爱人？

710
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:14,521
只是为了表示慷慨再给你一次

711
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:22,488
但是，我想要的
只是现在我所有的这点爱情

712
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:29,161
我的慷慨像海一般的广阔无垠
我的爱情像海一般的深

713
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:34,166
我给你的越多，我自己有的也越多
因为二者都是无穷的

714
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:37,962
- 茱丽叶！
- 好奶妈！

715
00:48:38,088 --> 00:48:42,008
- 亲爱的蒙泰鸠，可不要负心
- 夫人！

716
00:48:43,093 --> 00:48:48,139
- 稍后一下，我就回来
- 夫人！茱丽叶小姐！

717
00:48:56,398 --> 00:48:59,109
啊幸福的，幸福的夜！

718
00:49:00,652 --> 00:49:05,156
这是在夜里，我生怕这一切都是梦

719
00:49:05,282 --> 00:49:08,868
太快活如意，怕不是真的

720
00:49:08,994 --> 00:49:13,248
再说三句话，亲爱的罗蜜欧
可真要再会了

721
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:17,503
如果你的爱情是纯正的
有意和我结婚

722
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:20,172
明天给我消息

723
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,426
告诉他，在什么地方
什么时候我们举行婚礼

724
00:49:23,551 --> 00:49:28,389
我要把我的命运完全交付给你
把你当作我的主人，随着你走遍天涯

725
00:49:28,973 --> 00:49:31,892
- 小姐！
- 我来了，就来

726
00:49:32,893 --> 00:49:36,564
但是如果你存心不良
我就要请求你...

727
00:49:36,689 --> 00:49:39,442
- 小姐！茱丽叶
- 等一下，我来了！

728
00:49:39,567 --> 00:49:42,778
停止追求，让我独自去哀伤…

729
00:49:42,904 --> 00:49:46,032
- 我明天派人来
- 愿我的灵魂得救

730
00:49:46,158 --> 00:49:48,827
我对你说一千遍再见！

731
00:49:53,332 --> 00:49:57,210
罗蜜欧！
我明天几点钟派人到你那里去？

732
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:00,172
- 九点钟吧
- 我一定准时不误

733
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,549
要到二十年才能挨到那个时间

734
00:50:04,259 --> 00:50:05,886
罗蜜欧！

735
00:50:12,893 --> 00:50:15,854
我忘记为什么叫你回来了

736
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:19,274
让我站在此地让你慢慢的想

737
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:23,947
我只是爱和你在一起
为了使你永久站在那里，我将永远想不起

738
00:50:24,072 --> 00:50:27,533
那么我就永久的等着，好让你永久的想不起

739
00:50:27,659 --> 00:50:30,453
因为除了这个地方我也不记得还有什么家

740
00:50:57,648 --> 00:51:00,526
再见，再见！

741
00:51:01,402 --> 00:51:04,655
离别是这样又甜蜜又心伤

742
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,324
我要对你说再见一直说到大天光

743
00:53:09,242 --> 00:53:10,868
罗伦斯神父！

744
00:53:10,994 --> 00:53:13,663
大清早是谁这样愉快的向我敬礼？

745
00:53:13,788 --> 00:53:15,748
早安，神父！

746
00:53:24,215 --> 00:53:29,220
孩子，你起床这样的早
必定是心里有什么烦恼

747
00:53:29,262 --> 00:53:33,683
所以你今天这样的早起
必定是有什么烦恼是惊扰了你

748
00:53:33,808 --> 00:53:38,521
如果不是，那么我这一猜准保不错
我们的罗蜜欧这一夜还没有睡过

749
00:53:38,646 --> 00:53:41,774
猜得对
我得到比睡眠更甜蜜的安息

750
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,570
上帝恕罪
你是否和罗沙琳在一起？

751
00:53:44,695 --> 00:53:47,573
和罗沙琳在一起？神父，不

752
00:53:47,698 --> 00:53:50,242
我已忘了那个名字和它给我的痛苦

753
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:53,662
这才是好孩子，那么你到哪里去了？

754
00:53:53,787 --> 00:53:56,165
不待你再问，我要让你知道

755
00:53:56,332 --> 00:54:01,420
我和我仇敌在一起宴会
忽然间有人把我伤害

756
00:54:01,545 --> 00:54:06,842
讲清楚些，好孩子，不要那么累赘
迷一般的忏悔只能得到迷一般的赦罪

757
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:09,053
明白说吧

758
00:54:10,012 --> 00:54:15,225
我已经情有所钟
把凯布雷的女儿一眼看中

759
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:18,188
如怎样爱她，她也也怎么爱我…

760
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:22,150
两情相悦，只差你用婚礼来撮合

761
00:54:22,275 --> 00:54:26,321
我们何时，何地，如何的得以相见
如何的谈情说爱，如何的交换誓言

762
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:28,865
我将一面走一面说，但是我求你

763
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:32,202
答应今天就给我们举行婚礼

764
00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:35,455
圣芳济！

765
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:40,710
- 被你那样热恋的罗沙琳，这样快的就丢掉？
- 但她们在嘲弄我，神父！

766
00:54:41,002 --> 00:54:44,130
年轻人的爱情
不是出自真心，只是靠了眼睛

767
00:54:44,297 --> 00:54:47,008
- 听我说，神父
- 为了罗沙琳....

768
00:54:47,134 --> 00:54:49,971
....多少泪水洗过你的瘦脸

769
00:54:50,096 --> 00:54:53,391
你是否变了？
你可以把一句老话重温

770
00:54:53,516 --> 00:54:56,310
男人既然薄幸，女人当然也会变心

771
00:54:56,435 --> 00:55:00,481
- 为了我爱罗沙琳，你曾见怪
- 是为了痴情，不是为了爱

772
00:55:00,606 --> 00:55:02,233
是，是为了爱

773
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:05,403
你曾叫我把爱情埋葬

774
00:55:06,487 --> 00:55:10,074
没叫你埋一个，把另外一个掘出来

775
00:55:25,632 --> 00:55:28,010
来！朝三暮四的青年

776
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:31,638
来，和我走

777
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:35,058
为了一个理由，我愿意助你一臂之力

778
00:55:35,183 --> 00:55:36,935
神父！

779
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:42,899
这婚姻可能成为一段美满良缘
使你们两个仇家从此尽去前嫌

780
00:55:43,025 --> 00:55:45,736
我们走吧！我急得不得了

781
00:55:46,862 --> 00:55:50,490
要稳要慢。跑快了会要跌倒。

782
00:55:57,999 --> 00:56:01,336
罗蜜欧这鬼东西哪里去了？

783
00:56:04,547 --> 00:56:07,216
这一夜他没有回家吗？

784
00:56:08,509 --> 00:56:10,303
这一夜他没有回家吗？

785
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:12,639
- 谁？
- 罗蜜欧

786
00:56:12,764 --> 00:56:15,600
没有回到他父亲的家
我问过他家的佣人

787
00:56:16,726 --> 00:56:22,523
老凯布雷家的亲戚，提伯特
给他父亲家送了一封信

788
00:56:24,317 --> 00:56:27,195
- 挑战书，一定是
- 罗蜜欧会回答的

789
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,156
会写字的人当然都会写回信

790
00:56:30,282 --> 00:56:34,787
不，我是说他会挺身会见那个写信的人
被挑战，就敢应战。

791
00:56:34,912 --> 00:56:37,831
唉呀，可怜的罗蜜欧，他已经死了

792
00:56:37,957 --> 00:56:41,168
被一个苍白女人的黑眼睛给戳死了

793
00:56:41,293 --> 00:56:43,754
一首情歌刺穿了他的耳朵

794
00:56:43,921 --> 00:56:49,009
邱比特的秃箭射裂了他的心脏的正中心

795
00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:57,184
- 他还能打得过提伯特吗？
- 噫，提伯特算得什么？

796
00:56:57,309 --> 00:56:59,853
我告诉你说，它不是一只寻常的猫
(引喻-列那狐的故事中的猫剑客名提伯特)

797
00:57:06,361 --> 00:57:08,029
啊，两位早安！

798
00:57:13,785 --> 00:57:18,540
这是不是很令人痛心的事
我们到处遇到这种讨厌的苍蝇

799
00:57:18,665 --> 00:57:23,128
这种时髦贩子
这种满口法文pardonnez-moi's的家伙

800
00:57:24,963 --> 00:57:28,008
罗蜜欧先生，早安(法文)

801
00:57:28,133 --> 00:57:29,301
早安(法文)

802
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:33,555
你穿的是法国式的灯笼裤
所以对你说一句法国的应酬话

803
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,142
- 你昨晚把我们骗苦了
- 我昨晚骗了你们什么？

804
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:40,521
溜走了，先生，溜走了
你不懂吗？

805
00:57:40,646 --> 00:57:44,066
请原谅！好马丘修
我当时有要紧的事…

806
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:47,153
在那情形之下，一个人难免不失礼

807
00:57:47,278 --> 00:57:50,031
好宾瓦力欧
快来给我们调停一下，我智穷才尽了

808
00:57:50,156 --> 00:57:54,160
你的才智是一只很酸的苹果
可以做味道浓郁的苹果酱

809
00:57:58,164 --> 00:58:02,919
噫，这不比为了恋爱而长吁短叹要好些吗？

810
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:06,881
你现在有说有笑了，你现在是罗蜜欧了

811
00:58:07,006 --> 00:58:12,053
你现在是你的本来面目
无论是天性如此或是有意做作

812
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:16,725
因为一把鼻涕一把眼泪的情人
实在是像一个大傻瓜，伸着舌头东窜西窜的

813
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:19,019
想把他的那根棍子藏在一个洞里

814
00:58:19,144 --> 00:58:22,356
- 停止吧…
- 你想要我说到一半就勉强的停止住？

815
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:24,816
否则你又要胡说八道了

816
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:28,779
啊，你错了
因为我已经深入到底

817
00:58:28,946 --> 00:58:32,866
不想再搞下去了

818
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:39,748
好东西来了

819
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:42,960
这是艄好舢板

820
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,172
一条船！一条船！

821
00:58:51,219 --> 00:58:55,139
两条，两条；
一个穿衬衫的，一个穿裙子的

822
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,062
- 彼得
- 奶妈

823
00:59:03,022 --> 00:59:04,732
我的扇子，彼得

824
00:59:04,857 --> 00:59:09,862
好彼得，给她遮住脸
因为她的扇子比她的脸好看一些

825
00:59:13,908 --> 00:59:17,954
- 祝诸位早安，先生们
- 祝你晚安，老太太

826
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,750
- 到午后了吗？
- 一点也不差，告诉你说

827
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:26,463
因为日晷上那只淫秽的手
现在正摸着正午那一点

828
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:30,801
胡说，你是什么样的人？

829
00:59:30,926 --> 00:59:34,597
他是，上帝造的然后又由他自己毁掉的人

830
00:59:34,763 --> 00:59:39,977
真是说得好，由他自己毁掉，是不是？

831
00:59:41,395 --> 00:59:47,359
诸位，有谁能告诉我在什么地方
我可以找到年轻的罗蜜欧？

832
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:57,621
我就是，因为实在找不到一个更坏的名字
在名叫罗密欧的人当中我是最年轻的一个

833
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,793
如果你就是他，先生
我有机密的话对你说

834
01:00:07,797 --> 01:00:11,551
- 她要请他吃晚饭
- 一个鸨母，一个鸨母

835
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:19,893
一个鸨母！

836
01:00:24,065 --> 01:00:26,442
你们会被抓起来！

837
01:00:28,361 --> 01:00:29,862
马丘修，不要！

838
01:00:32,156 --> 01:00:37,244
一只老野鸡
有一只老野鸡

839
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:40,748
是斋期中的美味

840
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:47,505
二十个人都吃不完

841
01:00:48,297 --> 01:00:51,926
没吃完就先发了霉

842
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:03,563
再见，老小姐

843
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:12,447
差劲，下流胚子
下流胚子

844
01:01:12,572 --> 01:01:17,244
我不是肯和他打情骂俏的女人
我不是和无赖汉为伍的人

845
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:22,291
差劲，下流胚子
下流胚子

846
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:28,880
请问，先生，这是哪个....
无礼的家伙，满口的下流话？

847
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,592
是一个爱说话的绅士，奶妈

848
01:01:31,718 --> 01:01:35,221
他一分钟之内说的话比他能维持一个月的还要多

849
01:01:35,346 --> 01:01:39,559
如果说什么调戏我的话，我要教他受点报应
二十个这样的粗汉我也可以对付

850
01:01:39,684 --> 01:01:43,605
如果我对付不了他
我可以找到能对付他的人

851
01:01:50,903 --> 01:01:53,072
你....

852
01:01:53,197 --> 01:01:55,408
居然站在一旁

853
01:01:55,533 --> 01:01:59,203
让每一个恶棍随意摆布我

854
01:02:04,126 --> 01:02:06,128
没用的废物！

855
01:02:07,338 --> 01:02:09,882
先生，请过来说句话

856
01:02:16,472 --> 01:02:18,223
气死人！

857
01:03:01,268 --> 01:03:05,814
我们家的小姐教我来访你

858
01:03:05,939 --> 01:03:09,067
她教我说的话我不愿说出来

859
01:03:09,192 --> 01:03:11,653
不过我可以先告诉你一件事

860
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:15,491
如果你逗着我们家小姐作一场荒唐梦

861
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,660
奶妈...

862
01:03:17,785 --> 01:03:21,706
...就像大家所说的
那可是很恶劣的行为

863
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:26,043
因为小姐年轻，所以，如果你骗她

864
01:03:26,168 --> 01:03:29,964
那可真是对不起任何好人家的姑娘的事
而且是很卑鄙的行为

865
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:35,177
奶妈，请代我致意你家的小姐
我对你郑重声明

866
01:03:35,303 --> 01:03:40,349
请她今日午后设法出来做忏悔

867
01:03:40,474 --> 01:03:44,770
在罗伦斯神父的斋房里

868
01:03:44,896 --> 01:03:47,649
她可作忏悔，然后行婚礼

869
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:56,700
这是酬劳你的

870
01:03:56,825 --> 01:04:01,288
- 不，真是的，先生，一文钱都不能
-瞎讲，请你收下吧

871
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:03,582
好…

872
01:04:07,127 --> 01:04:09,671
先生，我家的小姐是最可爱的姑娘

873
01:04:09,796 --> 01:04:13,550
- 那时候她还是一个爱多嘴的小东西...
- 再见！

874
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:17,804
有一位贵族叫巴利斯的，很想把她弄到手

875
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:21,850
有时候我触怒她，说巴利斯是个很漂亮的人

876
01:04:21,976 --> 01:04:25,438
- 奶妈，请代我向你家的小姐致意
- 替你说一千回

877
01:04:55,678 --> 01:04:59,181
我派奶妈去是在九点钟

878
01:04:59,306 --> 01:05:02,768
她答应我在半小时内回来…

879
01:05:03,644 --> 01:05:06,188
也许她遇不到他

880
01:05:06,355 --> 01:05:10,025
不会的，啊！她是个跛子

881
01:05:10,192 --> 01:05:13,237
恋爱的使者应该像是思想一般

882
01:05:14,154 --> 01:05:17,157
如果她有热情，有滚热的青春的血

883
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:20,452
她动作起来会像一只球似的快

884
01:05:20,577 --> 01:05:22,454
但是老年人

885
01:05:22,579 --> 01:05:27,626
好像死了一般，迟钝，缓慢

886
01:05:28,586 --> 01:05:30,880
沉重苍白得像一块铅

887
01:05:34,759 --> 01:05:38,054
啊天呀，她来了
啊亲爱的奶妈，有什么消息？

888
01:05:38,513 --> 01:05:41,308
啊天呀！你为什么有忧愁的样子

889
01:05:42,892 --> 01:05:46,062
纵然消息不好
也要快快活活的讲出来

890
01:05:46,938 --> 01:05:48,857
教你的佣人走开

891
01:05:48,982 --> 01:05:52,652
- 彼得，到门口去等着
- 快…

892
01:05:53,778 --> 01:05:58,742
- 你见到他了吗？
- 我疲倦了，让我休息一下

893
01:05:58,908 --> 01:06:02,329
呸，我的骨头好痛！

894
01:06:04,832 --> 01:06:06,792
好

895
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:09,920
好，好奶妈

896
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:14,008
告诉我，我的爱人说些什么？

897
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:19,180
你的爱人，像是一位诚实的君子

898
01:06:19,305 --> 01:06:22,141
一位有礼貌的

899
01:06:22,266 --> 01:06:26,187
挺和气的，漂亮的…

900
01:06:26,354 --> 01:06:28,898
而且我敢说是很有德性的

901
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:31,984
- 你的母亲在哪里？
- 我的母亲在哪里？

902
01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:36,322
噫？她在里面呢，她还能够在哪里？
你的话好奇怪！

903
01:06:36,448 --> 01:06:40,369
"你的爱人，像是一位诚实的君子
你的母亲在哪里？"

904
01:06:40,535 --> 01:06:43,497
你怎么这样性急？好，算了吧

905
01:06:43,622 --> 01:06:47,668
这就是你给我的酸痛的骨头贴的膏药吗？
以后你自己去送信吧！

906
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:52,047
你怎么这样麻烦！
好！罗蜜欧说些什么？

907
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:58,887
你今天得到允许去作忏悔吗？

908
01:06:59,012 --> 01:07:00,973
得到了

909
01:07:01,765 --> 01:07:05,852
那么你赶快到罗伦斯神父的斋堂去

910
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:09,815
那里有一个丈夫等着X你为〔呢

911
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:17,365
现在你的脸上泛起了红晕了…

912
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:21,327
你听到任何消息都会脸红

913
01:07:21,452 --> 01:07:24,330
赶快到教堂去！

914
01:07:24,455 --> 01:07:28,209
- 我要吃饭去
- 好奶妈，再见！

915
01:07:38,469 --> 01:07:43,600
愿上天赞许对神圣的结合
不要让我们日后受烦恼之苦

916
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:46,395
阿门！阿门！

917
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:51,984
日后尽管有什么烦恼来....

918
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:55,279
也不能抵消我和她见面时片刻的欢欣

919
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:59,533
这突然的快乐会有突然的结局…
在最得意的时候突然消灭

920
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:03,370
就像火和火药，一接吻，立刻炸光

921
01:08:03,495 --> 01:08:08,626
最甜的蜜固然本身是美味

922
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:12,296
可是不免有一点腻，吃起来要倒胃口

923
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:16,467
所以要温和的爱

924
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,970
这样爱才能持久

925
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,556
小姐来了，啊

926
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:25,393
这样轻盈的脚步
永远磨不坏这铺地的坚石板

927
01:08:31,358 --> 01:08:36,321
- 听我忏悔的神父，你晚安
- 孩子，罗蜜欧会代表我们两个向你答礼

928
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:41,910
啊！茱丽叶
如果你的欢乐之情是和我一般的洋溢

929
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,579
如果你有更大的本领加以描绘

930
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:47,624
那么请你用你的谈吐来薰香这四周的空气

931
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,795
只有乞丐才计数他的家财

932
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,339
我的爱情太充足了

933
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:56,592
我无法数清我的财产的一半

934
01:08:58,928 --> 01:09:00,888
和我来…

935
01:09:02,056 --> 01:09:05,434
我们要赶快办事
因为，在教会把你们结合起来之前

936
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:09,397
你们不该长久的在这里私下会面

937
01:11:04,808 --> 01:11:07,227
我求你，好马丘修，我们回去吧

938
01:11:09,271 --> 01:11:11,731
天气热

939
01:11:13,608 --> 01:11:15,902
凯布雷家的人都出来了

940
01:11:17,362 --> 01:11:20,573
如果我们遇到，不免一场恶斗

941
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:25,870
因为在这大热天的，脾气容易发作

942
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:32,085
马丘修，我们回去吧

943
01:11:34,045 --> 01:11:38,550
你就像是那种人，走进酒店....

944
01:11:38,676 --> 01:11:41,429
把剑往桌上一拍，说：

945
01:11:41,554 --> 01:11:47,268
"愿上帝别令我需要你！"
可是第二杯一下肚

946
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:51,230
他无缘无故的抽出剑来向酒保找麻烦了

947
01:11:51,355 --> 01:11:56,068
如果有两个这样的人，很快的一个也剩不下
因为这一个会把那一个杀死的

948
01:11:56,193 --> 01:11:59,196
一个人在街上咳嗽，你就和他吵架

949
01:11:59,322 --> 01:12:03,701
只因他惊醒了你的阳光下睡觉的狗

950
01:12:03,826 --> 01:12:08,497
芭乐，你居然还教训我不要和人吵架？

951
01:12:11,084 --> 01:12:12,961
马丘修

952
01:12:13,503 --> 01:12:15,964
用我的脑袋起誓，凯布雷家的人来了

953
01:12:20,761 --> 01:12:23,805
用我的脚跟起誓，我满不在乎

954
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:47,246
二位晚安！

955
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:52,085
- 晚安
- 我要和你们随便哪一位说一句话

956
01:12:53,211 --> 01:12:56,130
只要和我们一个人说一句话吗？

957
01:12:56,255 --> 01:13:00,677
再加上一点什么吧
一句话之外再加上一拳吧

958
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:09,852
如果你们给我机会
先生，我很愿意那么做的

959
01:13:10,103 --> 01:13:13,940
不给你机会你就不能找个机会吗？

960
01:13:15,942 --> 01:13:18,653
马丘修，你是罗密欧的同道....

961
01:13:18,779 --> 01:13:23,659
同道！什么！
你把我们当作沿街卖唱的人吗？

962
01:13:24,243 --> 01:13:28,747
如果你把我们当作沿街卖唱的人
你只好听一听刺耳之音

963
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:31,125
这便是我的弦弓

964
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:34,753
这就是使你起舞的家伙
混帐！沿街卖唱！

965
01:13:34,878 --> 01:13:37,631
这大众聚会的地方不便谈话

966
01:13:37,756 --> 01:13:42,720
或是找个僻静的地方。或是冷静的理论

967
01:13:42,845 --> 01:13:46,056
再不就干脆走开
在这里所有的眼睛都在看着我们呢？

968
01:13:46,181 --> 01:13:49,184
人的眼睛就是为看的，让他们看

969
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:53,230
我绝不为了讨人欢喜而移动一步，我...

970
01:13:53,398 --> 01:13:58,320
好了，你且稍安勿躁
先生，我的人来了

971
01:13:58,653 --> 01:14:00,280
马丘修!

972
01:14:09,497 --> 01:14:10,665
提伯特.

973
01:14:10,832 --> 01:14:15,629
罗密欧，我对你的仇恨使我只能这样称你....

974
01:14:15,754 --> 01:14:17,839
你是一个坏蛋.

975
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:22,886
提伯特，我有爱你的理由

976
01:14:23,011 --> 01:14:26,931
所以你这样称呼我，我也不动火

977
01:14:27,058 --> 01:14:29,101
我不是坏蛋

978
01:14:29,226 --> 01:14:33,230
所以再会吧
我看你是不了解我

979
01:14:33,356 --> 01:14:35,316
小子

980
01:14:36,275 --> 01:14:40,363
这不能弥补你对我的伤害

981
01:14:40,488 --> 01:14:42,949
所以转身拔剑吧

982
01:14:43,115 --> 01:14:48,162
我要声明我从来不曾伤害你
而且我爱你之深是你所不能想像的

983
01:14:48,287 --> 01:14:54,168
除非你知道我所以爱你的原故
所以，好凯布雷,

984
01:14:54,293 --> 01:14:57,838
我对于你的姓氏和对于我自己的是一样的尊重

985
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,093
请不要动气

986
01:15:29,496 --> 01:15:33,083
- 不要，马丘修！
- 啊，好心平气和的卑鄙可耻的屈服！

987
01:15:33,209 --> 01:15:35,378
- 不要，马丘修!
- 让开！

988
01:15:35,503 --> 01:15:40,049
- 提伯特，你这捉老鼠的
- 你要对我怎么样？

989
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:44,595
猫王，我只要你九条命中的一条

990
01:15:44,721 --> 01:15:49,642
我是想要你那一条命，至于其他八条
如果你斗不过我

991
01:15:49,767 --> 01:15:54,355
- 我也要痛打一顿
- 好马丘修!

992
01:15:55,773 --> 01:15:59,777
你还不把剑抽出鞘来？

993
01:15:59,902 --> 01:16:04,240
赶快，否则在你未拔出剑之前
我的剑就砍到你的耳边了

994
01:16:11,373 --> 01:16:13,584
我奉陪便是

995
01:16:13,709 --> 01:16:16,462
好马丘修，收起你的剑

996
01:16:18,589 --> 01:16:20,883
来吧！

997
01:16:28,265 --> 01:16:32,770
来吧，打落他门的武器
你们二位，真太难为情，不要这样胡闹！

998
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:37,566
公爵曾明令禁止不准在维洛那街上斗殴

999
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:44,074
- 让开！
- 让开！你这懦夫！

1000
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:46,284
吊死他们

1001
01:17:48,098 --> 01:17:50,183
割了他的头发

1002
01:18:26,554 --> 01:18:30,141
快啊，提伯特！
我们没有时间等

1003
01:18:32,852 --> 01:18:36,481
啊，妈妈的小宝贝剑掉了

1004
01:18:43,112 --> 01:18:44,864
提伯特，不要

1005
01:18:44,989 --> 01:18:47,533
二位，自制一点！

1006
01:18:48,242 --> 01:18:50,119
马丘修，走

1007
01:19:02,925 --> 01:19:04,843
离开

1008
01:19:04,969 --> 01:19:07,513
快逃，提伯特

1009
01:19:15,396 --> 01:19:17,898
我受伤了

1010
01:19:23,904 --> 01:19:25,656
我受伤了

1011
01:19:30,787 --> 01:19:33,456
- 我受伤了
- 怎么！你受伤了？

1012
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:39,004
一点擦伤，一点擦伤，哼，也受够了

1013
01:19:39,129 --> 01:19:43,800
鼓起勇气，男子汉，这伤一定不会重

1014
01:19:43,925 --> 01:19:48,596
没有一口井深，也没有教堂大门宽

1015
01:19:48,722 --> 01:19:50,807
但是足够我受用的了

1016
01:19:50,932 --> 01:19:55,770
你明天再打听我
你会发现我已经在坟墓里了

1017
01:19:57,856 --> 01:20:00,191
我的小童呢？

1018
01:20:00,318 --> 01:20:04,655
去，小子，找个外科医生
给我找个外科医生！

1019
01:20:06,866 --> 01:20:08,993
- 他伤到你了吗？
- 没事

1020
01:20:20,296 --> 01:20:23,841
你为什么活见鬼的跑到我们两个中间？

1021
01:20:23,966 --> 01:20:26,469
我是从你的胳膊底下受的伤

1022
01:20:26,594 --> 01:20:29,764
我完全是出于好意，我....

1023
01:20:38,482 --> 01:20:41,860
扶我到什么人家去
宾瓦利，否则我要晕倒

1024
01:20:56,708 --> 01:21:00,003
你们两家真该倒霉！

1025
01:21:00,128 --> 01:21:02,673
他酒喝多了！

1026
01:21:04,341 --> 01:21:08,637
你们两家把我喂了蛆....

1027
01:21:11,724 --> 01:21:15,228
我吃了苦头，而且是大苦头

1028
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:22,527
- 你们这两家....
- 他真滑稽！

1029
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:31,619
罗密欧!

1030
01:21:33,663 --> 01:21:36,416
勇敢的马丘修死了！

1031
01:21:56,979 --> 01:22:01,942
今天的噩运会要连续下去

1032
01:22:02,276 --> 01:22:06,697
这只是开始，还有悲惨的结局

1033
01:22:07,072 --> 01:22:11,785
他耀武扬威的离去
而马丘修被杀死了！

1034
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:16,206
亲戚的情份，我顾不得了

1035
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:18,793
现在让火眼的复仇之神来做我的向导吧！

1036
01:22:33,266 --> 01:22:34,684
提伯特!

1037
01:22:35,644 --> 01:22:37,395
罗密欧!

1038
01:22:38,813 --> 01:22:40,940
他在这儿，这边！

1039
01:22:46,655 --> 01:22:48,531
提伯特!

1040
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:56,832
提伯特,

1041
01:22:57,792 --> 01:23:02,213
你方才骂我为恶棍的话现在请你收回

1042
01:23:02,338 --> 01:23:05,758
因为马丘修的灵魂尚未远离我们

1043
01:23:05,883 --> 01:23:08,678
等着你的灵魂去陪伴他

1044
01:23:08,803 --> 01:23:14,850
或是你，或是我
或是我们两个，一定要和他同去！

1045
01:23:16,978 --> 01:23:18,062
让开！

1046
01:23:19,438 --> 01:23:21,816
让他走！

1047
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,152
看招！

1048
01:23:29,116 --> 01:23:30,993
剑，罗密欧!

1049
01:23:32,786 --> 01:23:37,749
可怜的孩子
你刚才和他一同在此地，你该陪他去

1050
01:23:37,874 --> 01:23:40,836
由这个来决定

1051
01:23:52,806 --> 01:23:55,100
当心你的步伐，罗密欧

1052
01:23:56,769 --> 01:23:59,063
攻击头，罗密欧

1053
01:24:09,032 --> 01:24:11,659
- 把你的剑给我
- 快

1054
01:24:23,504 --> 01:24:26,591
- 加把劲！提伯特
- 注意他的脚

1055
01:25:13,431 --> 01:25:15,558
给他一把剑！

1056
01:25:16,267 --> 01:25:18,311
剑！剑！

1057
01:25:26,903 --> 01:25:28,363
进广场去！

1058
01:26:14,745 --> 01:26:16,913
剑拿来！

1059
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:19,249
剑拿来！把剑给我！

1060
01:26:20,917 --> 01:26:22,502
你的剑，罗密欧!

1061
01:26:42,481 --> 01:26:45,150
罗密欧, 走！走开！

1062
01:26:45,276 --> 01:26:48,613
人民都惊起来了，不要站着发呆

1063
01:26:48,738 --> 01:26:53,326
如果你被捕，公爵会判你死刑
走吧！走开吧！逃走吧！

1064
01:26:59,666 --> 01:27:02,919
啊！我被命运所玩弄了

1065
01:27:03,544 --> 01:27:06,339
我被命运所玩弄了！

1066
01:27:07,173 --> 01:27:09,842
我被命运所玩弄了！

1067
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:14,847
一个蒙泰鸠家的诅咒！

1068
01:27:15,515 --> 01:27:17,934
提伯特!

1069
01:27:19,103 --> 01:27:24,483
我最好的朋友！
啊彬彬有礼的提伯特，诚实的君子！

1070
01:27:24,692 --> 01:27:29,113
- 我为什么活着见到你死呢？
- 啊上帝！

1071
01:27:29,238 --> 01:27:31,907
罗密欧亲手使得提伯特流血了吗？

1072
01:27:32,032 --> 01:27:35,911
- 是的，是的，哎呀，实在是的
- 啊奶妈！

1073
01:27:36,036 --> 01:27:39,957
啊毒蛇一般的心肠，藏在花一般的脸下！

1074
01:27:40,082 --> 01:27:45,045
可曾有过这样的一本书
内容如此恶劣而装潢如此考究？

1075
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:54,014
男人都是不可靠，没有信用，没有诚心

1076
01:27:54,139 --> 01:27:58,518
全是无赖的，虚伪的，欺骗的，背誓的

1077
01:27:58,643 --> 01:28:01,354
愿罗密欧遭受耻辱！

1078
01:28:01,479 --> 01:28:04,399
起这种誓愿，你的舌头会要生疮！

1079
01:28:04,524 --> 01:28:09,029
他不是生来受耻辱的
耻辱不敢踞在他的额上！

1080
01:28:09,154 --> 01:28:11,614
他把你的表哥杀死了
你还说他的好话吗？

1081
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:15,285
他是我的丈夫，我能说他的坏话吗？

1082
01:28:20,123 --> 01:28:22,334
我可怜的夫君！

1083
01:28:22,459 --> 01:28:25,712
给你做了三小时〔子的我
把你的名声割裂了....

1084
01:28:25,838 --> 01:28:28,799
谁能再把它平复呢？

1085
01:28:31,677 --> 01:28:35,097
但是，你这坏人
你为什么杀死我的表哥呢？

1086
01:28:36,849 --> 01:28:39,060
去找公爵！

1087
01:28:42,021 --> 01:28:45,149
公爵！公爵！

1088
01:29:05,921 --> 01:29:07,673
说吧，宾瓦利

1089
01:29:12,386 --> 01:29:15,597
- 快说啊！
- 公爵，您大公无私....

1090
01:29:15,722 --> 01:29:19,309
我们的血不能白流
让蒙泰鸠家也留点血，为我们报仇！

1091
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:26,733
- 宾瓦利，这场凶杀先动手的是哪一位？
- 是死在此地的提伯特

1092
01:29:29,277 --> 01:29:34,491
罗密欧，对他说话很客气
请他想想这场争斗是何等的无聊

1093
01:29:34,617 --> 01:29:37,996
- 并且特别提起不可招您生气
- 这是实情，公爵！

1094
01:29:38,121 --> 01:29:41,749
为了徇私，他说的话不是真的！

1095
01:29:47,088 --> 01:29:51,384
公爵，我请您要主持公道！

1096
01:29:51,509 --> 01:29:56,764
罗密欧杀了提伯特
你要把罗密欧杀掉

1097
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,019
罗密欧杀了他

1098
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,867
他杀了马丘修

1099
01:30:20,831 --> 01:30:24,585
他淌的血应该向谁去讨报酬？

1100
01:30:29,256 --> 01:30:34,136
罗密欧不负责
公爵，他是马丘修的知己....

1101
01:30:34,261 --> 01:30:39,850
他错在没有依照法律的程序
结果了提伯特

1102
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:44,064
为了这桩罪行
我把他立刻驱逐出境

1103
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:48,693
让罗密欧快走

1104
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:50,737
否则，一经发现....

1105
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:54,282
便是他死的时候

1106
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,174
哈！放逐！

1107
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:16,346
请慈悲些，说是"死刑"吧！
别说是"放逐"

1108
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:18,683
起来！有人敲门

1109
01:31:18,808 --> 01:31:21,310
好罗密欧，你藏起来

1110
01:31:21,435 --> 01:31:24,730
是谁？
谁敲得这样急？

1111
01:31:26,065 --> 01:31:29,735
你从哪里来的？你有什么事？

1112
01:31:29,902 --> 01:31:33,322
让我进来
你就知道我的使命了

1113
01:31:33,447 --> 01:31:35,992
我是朱丽叶小姐派来的

1114
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:41,288
那么，欢迎

1115
01:31:41,414 --> 01:31:46,252
啊神圣的修士！啊！告诉我，神圣的修士
我们小姐的丈夫在哪里？罗密欧在哪里？

1116
01:31:46,378 --> 01:31:49,464
在那边地上躺着呢
被他自己的眼泪给醉翻了

1117
01:31:49,589 --> 01:31:52,884
维洛那城墙以外便没有世界！

1118
01:31:54,094 --> 01:31:58,765
她也正是这样的躺着
一阵痛哭一阵啜泣，一阵痛哭一阵啜泣

1119
01:32:00,058 --> 01:32:02,227
起来！

1120
01:32:02,352 --> 01:32:04,855
挺起来，如果你是个男子汉

1121
01:32:05,731 --> 01:32:10,402
为了朱丽叶，为了她，挺立起来

1122
01:32:10,527 --> 01:32:13,780
- 你为什么如此伤心？
- 奶妈！

1123
01:32:13,905 --> 01:32:18,327
- 姑爷，姑爷！到头来都不免一死
- 你刚才不是提起茱丽叶吗？

1124
01:32:18,452 --> 01:32:20,412
她怎样了？

1125
01:32:20,538 --> 01:32:24,834
她是不是把我看作为一个无情的凶手？
她在哪里呢？她现在怎样？

1126
01:32:24,959 --> 01:32:28,212
我的秘密〔子对于我们这
一笔勾销的爱可说些什么呢？

1127
01:32:28,338 --> 01:32:30,798
她没说什么，只是哭了又哭

1128
01:32:30,965 --> 01:32:33,426
喊提伯特，然后又喊罗密欧

1129
01:32:33,551 --> 01:32:36,346
好像那个名字，把她射死了

1130
01:32:36,471 --> 01:32:39,515
啊！告诉我，修士，告诉我

1131
01:32:39,641 --> 01:32:44,354
我的名字住在这身体上哪一个下流的部分？

1132
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:48,066
告诉我，我好捣毁那个可恶的地方

1133
01:32:48,608 --> 01:32:52,070
- 放下那鲁莽的手！
- 天哪！别管我！

1134
01:32:55,658 --> 01:32:58,202
你吓到我了！

1135
01:32:58,327 --> 01:33:00,371
你是个男子汉？

1136
01:33:00,496 --> 01:33:04,792
看你那样子似乎是
你的泪却是女人气

1137
01:33:04,917 --> 01:33:08,671
你的狂暴的动作表示出
一个野兽的无理性的狂热

1138
01:33:08,837 --> 01:33:11,924
你杀死提伯特了？
你想杀死你自己吗？

1139
01:33:12,049 --> 01:33:15,844
你想用这样残酷手段对付自己
来害死与你相依为命的小姐吗？

1140
01:33:15,928 --> 01:33:18,222
打起精神来，你这人

1141
01:33:20,557 --> 01:33:24,478
你的茱丽叶还活着
在这一点上你应该觉得幸运了

1142
01:33:24,603 --> 01:33:29,733
提伯特要杀死你，但是你杀死了提伯特
在这一点上你也是幸运的

1143
01:33:29,859 --> 01:33:33,321
法律变成了你的朋友
"死刑"改成了"放逐"

1144
01:33:33,446 --> 01:33:35,156
在这一点上你又是幸运

1145
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:39,577
一连串的好运降在你的身上

1146
01:33:41,913 --> 01:33:46,084
爬进她的寝室，去安慰她

1147
01:33:46,209 --> 01:33:51,006
但是注意不要耽搁到夜间警卫都已布了岗
因为那时候你就无法逃到曼酋亚

1148
01:33:51,172 --> 01:33:55,552
你以后要住在那里
等着我们找到机会宣布你们的婚事

1149
01:33:55,677 --> 01:33:57,887
求公爵开恩特赦

1150
01:33:58,013 --> 01:34:02,183
以比你离去时的
悲伤超过二百万倍的快乐心情

1151
01:34:02,184 --> 01:34:05,021
然后叫你回来

1152
01:34:08,482 --> 01:34:11,569
你先走，奶妈，代我向小姐致意

1153
01:34:11,694 --> 01:34:17,199
叫她催全家的人早些安眠
他们遭遇这样严重的事故也容易早睡

1154
01:34:17,325 --> 01:34:19,535
罗密欧随后就到

1155
01:36:25,957 --> 01:36:28,335
你一定要走吗？

1156
01:36:30,962 --> 01:36:33,506
尚未快到天亮的时候

1157
01:36:36,009 --> 01:36:38,094
你听了刺耳的声音....

1158
01:36:38,303 --> 01:36:42,265
....是夜莺，不是云雀

1159
01:36:43,516 --> 01:36:46,353
她每夜都在那棵石榴树上叫

1160
01:36:47,228 --> 01:36:51,066
相信我的话吧，爱人
那是夜莺

1161
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:55,321
是云雀....

1162
01:36:55,988 --> 01:37:00,117
....来报晓，不是夜莺

1163
01:37:02,453 --> 01:37:06,374
夜间的星火已经熄灭

1164
01:37:13,464 --> 01:37:19,428
欢乐的白昼已经
轻轻的踏上云雾迷鞯纳结

1165
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:28,981
我一定要去逃生，否则留着等死

1166
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:33,026
那亮光不是白昼

1167
01:37:34,736 --> 01:37:36,989
我知道的，我

1168
01:37:39,825 --> 01:37:44,413
所以再停留一会吧；不必急于要走

1169
01:37:46,456 --> 01:37:50,377
让我被捕，让我被处死

1170
01:37:50,544 --> 01:37:53,422
只消你愿意这样，我是很甘心的

1171
01:37:53,547 --> 01:37:58,010
我可以说那灰白色不是清晨的眼睛
也可以说....

1172
01:37:58,136 --> 01:38:02,724
那不是在我们头上响彻云霄的云雀

1173
01:38:02,849 --> 01:38:06,311
我愿停留，并不愿意离去

1174
01:38:06,436 --> 01:38:10,231
来，死神，欢迎！
茱丽叶要我这样的

1175
01:38:12,233 --> 01:38:14,360
亮了

1176
01:38:14,944 --> 01:38:17,196
亮了，快离开此地，走，走开！

1177
01:38:18,197 --> 01:38:20,241
罗密欧，天亮了

1178
01:38:23,995 --> 01:38:27,749
发出这样刺耳的锐音

1179
01:38:27,915 --> 01:38:32,378
唱得这样难听的，正是云雀

1180
01:38:32,504 --> 01:38:35,591
有人说云雀的歌喉婉转悦人

1181
01:38:35,716 --> 01:38:39,428
这一只却不然，她教我们黯然离别

1182
01:38:39,553 --> 01:38:43,057
啊！现在走吧，天越来越亮

1183
01:38:43,182 --> 01:38:45,434
越来越亮

1184
01:38:45,559 --> 01:38:48,312
我们越来越悲伤

1185
01:38:51,023 --> 01:38:53,025
小姐！

1186
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:55,819
你的母亲到你的寝室来了

1187
01:38:58,697 --> 01:39:03,577
你的母亲到你的寝室来了
天亮了，要注意

1188
01:39:06,665 --> 01:39:10,835
你就这样走了？我的丈夫！我的情侣！

1189
01:39:11,586 --> 01:39:16,716
你要随时随刻写信来
因为每一分钟将似漫长的好多天

1190
01:39:16,883 --> 01:39:21,262
啊！这样计算
我将要变成很老才能再见我的罗密欧！

1191
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:26,142
任何机会我都不会放弃
向你传达我的一番情意

1192
01:39:29,229 --> 01:39:32,440
你想我们还能再见面吗？

1193
01:39:33,233 --> 01:39:36,111
我不怀疑

1194
01:39:36,237 --> 01:39:41,367
这一切的愁苦正好是我们来日的甜蜜的资料

1195
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,664
再会，再会！

1196
01:39:48,082 --> 01:39:50,918
再吻一会，我就下去

1197
01:40:14,651 --> 01:40:16,361
再见

1198
01:40:21,408 --> 01:40:22,826
再见！

1199
01:40:29,583 --> 01:40:31,793
啊上帝！

1200
01:40:53,608 --> 01:40:57,695
我们一定要报仇，你不须担心

1201
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,533
所以不要哭了

1202
01:41:07,288 --> 01:41:12,794
这个被放逐的恶棍现在住在曼酋亚
我要派人通知那边的一个人

1203
01:41:12,919 --> 01:41:17,590
给他一种非常的剧毒

1204
01:41:17,716 --> 01:41:21,261
让他很快的和提伯特作伴去

1205
01:41:23,347 --> 01:41:27,518
现在我有好消息告诉你，孩子

1206
01:41:27,643 --> 01:41:30,896
唉，你真有一个细心体贴的父亲

1207
01:41:31,021 --> 01:41:36,443
他为了给你排愁解闷
给你选了一个急促的快乐的日子

1208
01:41:38,237 --> 01:41:40,698
在这愁苦的时候有好消息，那太好了

1209
01:41:40,864 --> 01:41:43,659
唉，我的孩子，下个星期四一大早

1210
01:41:43,784 --> 01:41:47,705
那年轻漂亮的贵族绅士，巴利斯伯爵

1211
01:41:47,871 --> 01:41:53,085
将高高兴兴的在圣彼得教堂
使你做一个快乐的新娘

1212
01:41:54,546 --> 01:41:58,717
哼，我指着圣彼得教堂和圣彼得本人发誓

1213
01:41:58,842 --> 01:42:02,512
他不能在那里使我做一个快乐的新娘！

1214
01:42:09,227 --> 01:42:11,521
所以，就这样决定了

1215
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:16,401
贤婿巴利斯

1216
01:42:20,822 --> 01:42:25,118
怎样了，太太！
你把我的主张告诉她了吗？

1217
01:42:25,703 --> 01:42:29,832
是的，但是她不肯
她谢谢你的好意

1218
01:42:31,709 --> 01:42:34,628
这傻孩子真是不如死掉

1219
01:42:37,423 --> 01:42:39,133
慢一点！

1220
01:42:39,925 --> 01:42:41,802
我不大懂你的意思

1221
01:42:42,845 --> 01:42:45,806
我不大懂你的意思，太太

1222
01:42:45,931 --> 01:42:49,143
怎么！她不肯？

1223
01:42:49,268 --> 01:42:53,105
她不感激我们？
她不觉得荣耀？

1224
01:42:53,230 --> 01:42:56,025
我们给她物色到这样体面
的一位绅士做她的新郎

1225
01:42:56,150 --> 01:43:00,071
她还不觉得是福气吗？

1226
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:02,991
该死的傻丫头！让我看看她！

1227
01:43:03,116 --> 01:43:07,412
不知感恩的贱人
随便你到什么地方去觅食，不要和我住在一起

1228
01:43:07,537 --> 01:43:09,581
嗨！怎么，你疯了吗？

1229
01:43:10,415 --> 01:43:14,044
你该死，你这小贱人，不孝顺的东西！

1230
01:43:14,169 --> 01:43:18,507
我告诉你说，星期四到教堂去
否则永远不要见我的面

1231
01:43:18,632 --> 01:43:21,259
- 父亲，我求你！
- 不用作答

1232
01:43:21,385 --> 01:43:26,139
- 不要对我回嘴，我的手指正在发痒
- 上帝保佑她！

1233
01:43:26,264 --> 01:43:30,018
- 你这样骂她，是你的不对
- 为什么，明智的老太婆？

1234
01:43:30,143 --> 01:43:33,146
闭上你的嘴，谨慎的女人！
去！

1235
01:43:33,272 --> 01:43:36,818
我没有说什么不对的话
不准人说话吗？

1236
01:43:36,943 --> 01:43:41,280
别说了，你这唠唠叨叨的蠢婆子！
和老太婆喝酒的时候再说你那些老话吧

1237
01:43:41,406 --> 01:43:43,324
你火气太大了

1238
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:46,577
圣餐的面包！可把我气疯了

1239
01:43:51,416 --> 01:43:54,544
星期四快要到了
把手放在胸口上，仔细盘算一下

1240
01:43:54,669 --> 01:43:57,505
如果你是我的女儿
我就把你嫁给我的朋友

1241
01:43:57,630 --> 01:44:02,844
如果你不是我的女儿
随便你上吊，要饭，挨饿，倒毙在街上

1242
01:44:02,969 --> 01:44:05,680
因为我永远不会再履愕

1243
01:44:05,806 --> 01:44:08,559
我所有的财产也永远不会让你分享

1244
01:44:09,268 --> 01:44:13,272
- 父亲！
- 相信我的话，仔细想想

1245
01:44:13,397 --> 01:44:15,858
我决不反悔

1246
01:44:24,616 --> 01:44:27,911
啊，我的好妈妈，不要丢弃我

1247
01:44:28,037 --> 01:44:32,958
- 把这婚事延缓一个月
- 不要对我说，因为我没有话说！

1248
01:44:35,252 --> 01:44:38,756
随便你怎样做，因为我是不管你了

1249
01:44:42,427 --> 01:44:44,346
啊上帝！

1250
01:44:45,388 --> 01:44:47,599
啊奶妈！

1251
01:44:47,724 --> 01:44:51,770
怎样阻止这件事呢
你怎么说？

1252
01:44:51,895 --> 01:44:55,899
你没有一句使我高兴的话吗？
给一点安慰吧，奶妈？

1253
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:58,610
好，这就是安慰

1254
01:44:59,361 --> 01:45:01,738
罗密欧是被放逐了

1255
01:45:03,823 --> 01:45:08,370
什么赌我都敢打，他绝不敢回来要求和你团聚

1256
01:45:08,495 --> 01:45:11,539
就是敢回来，也只能偷偷摸摸的

1257
01:45:13,417 --> 01:45:17,088
事已至此

1258
01:45:18,255 --> 01:45:21,717
我想你最好就嫁给这位伯爵

1259
01:45:32,895 --> 01:45:35,272
是啊

1260
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:38,776
啊！他是一位很可爱的绅士

1261
01:45:42,947 --> 01:45:45,783
罗密欧和他比起来只好算是一块破抹布

1262
01:45:47,869 --> 01:45:53,750
小姐，就是一只鹰也没有像巴利斯
那样绿，那样锐利，那样好看的眼睛

1263
01:45:54,751 --> 01:45:57,921
我以为你这第二次结婚是很幸运的

1264
01:45:59,339 --> 01:46:01,800
因为比第一次的好

1265
01:46:02,926 --> 01:46:06,722
就是不比他好，你的第一个丈夫是已经死了

1266
01:46:06,847 --> 01:46:11,309
和死也差不多，活在世上而你无法享用他

1267
01:46:12,936 --> 01:46:15,689
你说的是心里的话吗？

1268
01:46:19,443 --> 01:46:21,903
而且是灵魂里的话

1269
01:46:23,823 --> 01:46:27,035
- 否则让我的心和灵魂一齐受诅咒
- 阿门！

1270
01:46:28,578 --> 01:46:30,204
怎么？

1271
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:34,584
好，你已经给了我很大的安慰

1272
01:46:38,046 --> 01:46:42,091
进去，告诉我的母亲，就说

1273
01:46:42,216 --> 01:46:45,345
我得罪了父亲，到劳伦斯的修道院

1274
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:49,015
去做忏悔请求赦罪去了

1275
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:51,100
我一定去说

1276
01:46:51,976 --> 01:46:54,729
- 这做得聪明
- 去吧！

1277
01:47:24,843 --> 01:47:28,263
你说你不知道小姐的意思

1278
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:30,725
这件事办得不平稳，我不喜欢

1279
01:47:30,850 --> 01:47:33,603
为了提伯特的死，她哭得过度伤心

1280
01:47:33,728 --> 01:47:39,442
所以我对她不便多说爱慕的话
因为一个流泪的家庭里爱神是无法露出笑脸来的

1281
01:47:50,537 --> 01:47:54,207
恰好遇到了，我的小姐，我的〔！

1282
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:58,795
等我可以做你〔的时候，你可以这样说

1283
01:48:02,174 --> 01:48:05,594
你是来向这位神父做忏悔的吗？

1284
01:48:06,387 --> 01:48:11,142
神父，你现在有功夫吗
还是让我晚祷时过来？

1285
01:48:11,267 --> 01:48:14,603
我现在有功夫，忧愁的孩子

1286
01:48:14,729 --> 01:48:19,567
- 伯爵，我们必须请你离开一下
- 我怎么可能打搅你们的祈祷呢！

1287
01:48:19,692 --> 01:48:22,737
茱丽叶，星期四一清早我来接你

1288
01:48:24,905 --> 01:48:27,450
目前我告辞了

1289
01:48:29,577 --> 01:48:32,788
请收下这神圣的一吻

1290
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:45,177
啊！关上门！你关门之后，来陪我哭吧

1291
01:48:45,302 --> 01:48:49,931
没有希望，不能补救了，无可挽回了！

1292
01:49:00,525 --> 01:49:03,654
茱丽叶，我已经知道你的苦痛了

1293
01:49:03,779 --> 01:49:08,033
神父，不要告诉我你已听说这件事
除非你能告诉我如何可以避免

1294
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:10,995
如果凭你的智慧想不出挽救的法子

1295
01:49:25,468 --> 01:49:27,679
且慢，孩子！

1296
01:49:30,973 --> 01:49:36,020
我发现了一线希望
和我们所要避免的事一样的危险

1297
01:49:39,941 --> 01:49:42,360
如果为了不和巴利斯伯爵结婚

1298
01:49:42,486 --> 01:49:47,366
要我嫁给巴利斯
还不如要我从那城门楼上跳下去

1299
01:49:47,491 --> 01:49:51,412
或是要我走进一座新坟
把我藏在一个死尸的敛衣里

1300
01:49:51,537 --> 01:49:53,038
那么，不要急

1301
01:50:06,635 --> 01:50:08,345
回家去

1302
01:50:09,888 --> 01:50:11,724
做出快乐的样子

1303
01:50:13,851 --> 01:50:16,729
答应嫁给巴利斯

1304
01:50:18,481 --> 01:50:21,026
明天是星期三

1305
01:50:22,402 --> 01:50:26,823
明天晚上你要一人独卧

1306
01:50:26,948 --> 01:50:30,952
不要让你的奶嘛睡在你的寝室里

1307
01:50:37,709 --> 01:50:41,004
你上床之后便拿出这个小瓶

1308
01:50:45,884 --> 01:50:49,471
服下这蒸馏过的药水

1309
01:50:53,809 --> 01:50:58,230
一股寒冷昏沉之感即将透过你的周身血脉

1310
01:50:59,774 --> 01:51:04,320
全身脉搏无法继续活动必将停止

1311
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:10,618
体温呼吸均将不能证明你还活着

1312
01:51:14,288 --> 01:51:18,459
在这假死的状态中

1313
01:51:18,584 --> 01:51:22,880
你需要继续四十二小时

1314
01:51:29,346 --> 01:51:34,434
然后像从一场酣睡中醒来一般

1315
01:51:36,395 --> 01:51:38,480
同时

1316
01:51:40,482 --> 01:51:45,445
在你将醒之前
我写信给罗密欧告诉他我们的计划

1317
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:49,408
他就会到此地来，他和我将守着你醒来

1318
01:51:49,533 --> 01:51:54,079
当晚罗密欧就可以把你带到曼酋亚去

1319
01:51:56,124 --> 01:52:00,128
给我，给我！不要对我说什么恐惧！

1320
01:52:01,045 --> 01:52:02,922
拿好了

1321
01:52:11,305 --> 01:52:15,601
你去吧，要坚强起来，这决心必定要成功

1322
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:56,226
怎么啦，我的倔强的孩子
你又放荡到什么地方去了？

1323
01:52:56,352 --> 01:53:00,981
因为我违抗了您的意旨
我去找个地方去忏悔伦

1324
01:53:02,232 --> 01:53:04,193
原谅我吧

1325
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:07,739
从今以后我永远听您的话

1326
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:12,494
哎，我很高兴，这很好，站起来吧

1327
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:15,830
本应该如此

1328
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:55,079
爱啊！给我力量！

1329
01:54:20,939 --> 01:54:24,943
将这封信亲手交给在曼酋亚的罗蜜欧

1330
01:55:01,522 --> 01:55:06,319
老爷！老爷！她死啦！
茱丽叶死啦！

1331
01:55:06,444 --> 01:55:09,197
老爷，茱丽叶小姐，她死啦！

1332
01:55:10,156 --> 01:55:12,784
茱丽叶！茱丽叶！

1333
01:55:13,993 --> 01:55:18,039
茱丽叶！
夫人，她在哪里？

1334
01:55:21,543 --> 01:55:24,380
啊好难过！

1335
01:55:24,505 --> 01:55:28,592
死亡降在她的身上，就像一阵非时的严霜

1336
01:55:28,717 --> 01:55:32,888
降落在田间最美丽的花朵上面

1337
01:57:48,277 --> 01:57:50,405
- 主人？
- 巴特萨！

1338
01:57:54,242 --> 01:57:58,871
我的茱丽叶怎么样？
因为如果她是平安的，一切都不会坏

1339
01:57:59,747 --> 01:58:02,041
我的夫人怎么样？

1340
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:17,516
她死啦，主人
她死啦

1341
01:58:18,517 --> 01:58:21,937
她的身体长眠在凯布雷家的坟墓里

1342
01:58:22,062 --> 01:58:25,733
我亲见她下葬在她家族的墓穴里面

1343
01:58:36,035 --> 01:58:39,204
那么命运，我再也不信仰你！

1344
02:00:03,583 --> 02:00:07,337
好好的过日子，一切顺利

1345
02:00:09,756 --> 02:00:12,384
再会，好孩子

1346
02:02:12,425 --> 02:02:14,468
啊我的爱人！

1347
02:02:18,681 --> 02:02:20,683
我的〔！

1348
02:02:22,810 --> 02:02:26,856
死神吸去了你的甜蜜的气息

1349
02:02:26,981 --> 02:02:30,609
但是没有力量去摧毁你的美貌

1350
02:02:34,530 --> 02:02:36,907
你没有被征服

1351
02:02:39,494 --> 02:02:43,915
在你的嘴唇上，双颊上

1352
02:02:45,083 --> 02:02:47,294
仍然可以看出美貌的红红的标帜

1353
02:02:48,837 --> 02:02:52,883
并未竖起死亡的白旗

1354
02:02:57,804 --> 02:02:59,139
提伯特

1355
02:03:05,354 --> 02:03:08,273
你裹着血淋淋的敛衣躺在那里哪？

1356
02:03:18,993 --> 02:03:23,247
你年轻轻的被人杀害

1357
02:03:23,373 --> 02:03:27,585
我现在就用杀害你的那一只手
去杀死你的敌人

1358
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:33,132
此外我还能对你有什么更大的效劳之处呢？

1359
02:03:39,889 --> 02:03:42,183
饶恕我，老弟

1360
02:03:53,070 --> 02:03:55,155
亲爱的茱丽叶

1361
02:04:00,035 --> 02:04:02,788
你为什么还是这样美？

1362
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:09,253
难道要我相信那空虚的死神也有爱意

1363
02:04:09,378 --> 02:04:13,298
那枯瘦可怖的怪物
把你藏在这幽暗之处做他的情妇

1364
02:04:14,967 --> 02:04:20,514
生怕有这种事
我更要长久和你厮守

1365
02:04:24,853 --> 02:04:30,400
永不离去这昏暗的宫室

1366
02:04:32,652 --> 02:04:34,988
这儿

1367
02:04:35,113 --> 02:04:42,579
我就留在这里与你的侍婢蛆虫为伍！

1368
02:04:43,621 --> 02:04:45,957
上帝啊！

1369
02:05:01,057 --> 02:05:05,269
眼睛，看你的最后一眼吧！

1370
02:05:10,608 --> 02:05:14,320
胳膊，做你最后一次的拥抱吧！

1371
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:21,869
还有，嘴唇
啊你这呼吸的门户

1372
02:05:21,994 --> 02:05:27,166
用合法的一吻
向垄断一切的死神去签订永恒的契约吧！

1373
02:06:04,539 --> 02:06:07,250
这一杯敬我的爱人！

1374
02:06:35,237 --> 02:06:41,827
我便这样的一吻而死

1375
02:06:55,215 --> 02:06:57,760
- 那边是谁？
- 一个朋友

1376
02:06:57,885 --> 02:07:02,556
- 并且是熟识你的一个人
- 他来到此地多久了？

1377
02:07:02,681 --> 02:07:05,893
- 足有半小时
- 和我一同到坟里去

1378
02:07:06,019 --> 02:07:10,982
我不敢，神父。我的主人不知道我没有走开

1379
02:07:11,107 --> 02:07:14,486
那么你就别动，我一个人去

1380
02:07:15,737 --> 02:07:17,989
我心里有一点疑惧！

1381
02:07:18,114 --> 02:07:21,451
啊！我很担心怕发生了什么不幸的事

1382
02:08:07,623 --> 02:08:09,417
面色惨白！

1383
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:18,343
是什么凶恶的时辰发生这样悲惨的意外！

1384
02:09:10,897 --> 02:09:13,232
啊，令人喜慰的神父！

1385
02:09:14,150 --> 02:09:16,319
我的丈夫在哪里？

1386
02:09:17,653 --> 02:09:21,991
我记得很清楚我应该是在什么地方
我现在就在那个地方

1387
02:09:23,118 --> 02:09:25,204
我的罗密欧在哪里？

1388
02:09:27,081 --> 02:09:29,375
我听见有人声

1389
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:31,710
我的罗密欧在哪里？

1390
02:09:31,835 --> 02:09:37,508
小姐，快从这死亡
疾疫，昏睡的巢穴走出来

1391
02:09:39,009 --> 02:09:43,138
我们所不能抵抗的力量
已经阻扰了我们的计划

1392
02:09:43,263 --> 02:09:48,185
- 跟我来，因为夜巡的警官来了
- 我的罗密欧在哪里？

1393
02:09:54,693 --> 02:09:56,903
来，走，好茱丽叶

1394
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:01,950
我不敢再停留了

1395
02:10:03,034 --> 02:10:05,412
我不敢再停留了！

1396
02:10:06,496 --> 02:10:08,164
茱丽叶

1397
02:10:09,916 --> 02:10:12,961
我不敢再停留了！

1398
02:10:55,588 --> 02:10:58,132
这是什么？

1399
02:11:02,804 --> 02:11:06,433
是毒药，我懂了
使得他年轻轻的就死去

1400
02:11:10,354 --> 02:11:12,522
啊好贪婪的人！

1401
02:11:12,647 --> 02:11:16,735
全喝干了，不留下一滴给我让我随你而去？

1402
02:11:17,819 --> 02:11:20,614
我要吻你的嘴唇

1403
02:11:20,739 --> 02:11:25,410
也许，再你唇边还沾着一点毒药
让我于兴奋中中毒死亡

1404
02:11:31,083 --> 02:11:33,126
你的嘴唇还温暖呢！

1405
02:12:03,116 --> 02:12:05,118
是的，有人声？

1406
02:12:09,081 --> 02:12:10,457
不好！

1407
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:17,172
那么我就要赶快

1408
02:12:18,257 --> 02:12:20,592
啊！正好有一把短刀

1409
02:12:21,885 --> 02:12:24,179
这就是你的刀鞘

1410
02:12:24,972 --> 02:12:27,766
你就在那里生锈，让我死吧！

1411
02:14:18,672 --> 02:14:21,800
这两家仇人在哪里？

1412
02:14:23,302 --> 02:14:24,470
凯布雷.

1413
02:14:28,683 --> 02:14:30,643
蒙泰鸠.

1414
02:14:37,984 --> 02:14:42,071
看看你们的仇恨得到了什么样的惩罚

1415
02:14:43,531 --> 02:14:48,327
上天竟利用爱情来剥夺你们的幸福

1416
02:14:50,997 --> 02:14:52,999
我....

1417
02:14:54,042 --> 02:14:57,670
对于你们的不睦也有疏于防范之处

1418
02:14:58,964 --> 02:15:03,552
也折损了两位亲眷

1419
02:15:06,138 --> 02:15:08,932
全部受到了惩罚

1420
02:15:13,479 --> 02:15:15,606
全部受到了惩罚！

1421
02:15:47,138 --> 02:15:51,142
清晨带来了凄凉的和平

1422
02:15:52,185 --> 02:15:56,189
太阳也愁得不愿露脸

1423
02:15:57,315 --> 02:16:00,402
因为，从来没有一个故事

1424
02:16:01,444 --> 02:16:06,366
比茱丽叶与罗密更令人黯然神伤
