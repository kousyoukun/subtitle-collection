1
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:28,648
Two households,
both alike in dignity,

2
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:35,144
in fair Verona
where we lay our scene,

3
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:40,159
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

4
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:45,665
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

5
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:49,999
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

6
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:57,678
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life,

7
00:00:57,745 --> 00:01:03,115
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows

8
00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:09,123
do with their death...
bury their parents'strife.

9
00:01:22,503 --> 00:01:24,130
[laughing]

10
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,145
But the quarrel is between
our masters and us their men.

11
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:34,408
Ah, 'tis all one.

12
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:36,143
[laughing]

13
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:39,482
Here come the house
of the Montagues.

14
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:43,656
Ah, good morrow.

15
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:45,521
Good morrow
to you, sir.

16
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:48,653
Quarrel,
I will back thee.

17
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:50,162
Right.

18
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:51,823
Fail me not.

19
00:02:01,842 --> 00:02:05,107
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

20
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:08,114
I do bite
my thumb, sir.

21
00:02:08,182 --> 00:02:13,119
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

22
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:15,621
No, sir.

23
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,625
I do not bite my
thumb at you, sir,

24
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:21,127
but I do bite
my thumb, sir.

25
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:22,628
Do you quarrel, sir?

26
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:28,135
Quarrel, sir?
No, no, no, sir.

27
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:30,636
If you do, sir,
I am for you.

28
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:32,639
I serve as good
a man as you.

29
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:33,639
No better?

30
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,938
Yes, better, sir.

31
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:42,148
You lie.

32
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:51,647
[laughing]

33
00:02:54,662 --> 00:02:56,152
Draw!

34
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,857
Draw if you be men!

35
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,763
Gregory, remember
thy swashing blow!

36
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:01,597
[shouting]

37
00:03:04,171 --> 00:03:06,162
Kill the Capulets!

38
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,105
[shouting]

39
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:24,123
Part, fools!
Put up your swords!

40
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:26,125
You know not what you do!

41
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:28,127
The Prince hath
expressly forbid

42
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,220
this bandying
in Verona streets!

43
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:32,128
Here come the Capulets!

44
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:37,637
Tybalt, Capulet's kinsman!

45
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:50,082
What, art thou drawn among
these heartless hinds?

46
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,655
Turn thee, Benvolio.
Look upon thy death.

47
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:57,156
I do but keep the peace.

48
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:58,657
Put up thy sword

49
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:01,092
or manage it
to part these men with me.

50
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:03,892
What, drawn
and talk of peace?

51
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,397
I hate the word,

52
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:09,869
as I hate hell,
all Montagues and thee.

53
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:11,427
Have at thee, cowards!

54
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:13,234
Capulet!

55
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:14,604
Montague!

56
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,939
[shouting]

57
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:19,104
Capulet!

58
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:29,888
Now hie thee home,
fragment.

59
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:32,221
You villain!

60
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,622
Capulet!

61
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:39,632
[shouting]

62
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,235
Give me my long sword! Ho!

63
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:47,638
Capulet!

64
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,141
Down to the market square!

65
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,144
Capulet!

66
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:53,908
Follow me! Follow me!

67
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:57,644
Kill that villain Montague!

68
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:03,088
My noble uncle!
My noble uncle!

69
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:04,886
What?

70
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,087
My sword! My sword!

71
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:12,098
Thou shalt not stir
a foot to seek a foe!

72
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:16,000
Hold me not!
Let me go!

73
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,095
Montague!

74
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,605
Montague!

75
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:21,106
Kill the villain!

76
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:31,112
[shouting]

77
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:43,053
[woman screams]

78
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:48,992
I'll strike thee, coward.

79
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:02,081
[trumpet fanfare]

80
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:05,778
The Prince!

81
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:08,048
The Prince is coming!
Put down your weapons!

82
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:10,352
The Prince!

83
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:12,585
The Prince!

84
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,224
Here comes the Prince!

85
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:19,459
Put your weapons down!
The Prince!

86
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:30,542
Rebellious subjects,
enemies to peace,

87
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:33,102
throw your mistempered
weapons to the ground...

88
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,943
Down with your weapons.

89
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,409
And hear the sentence
of your moved Prince.

90
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:49,129
Three civil brawls
bred of an airy word,

91
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:50,686
by thee, old Capulet...

92
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:52,356
No, no.

93
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:58,268
And Montague...

94
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,570
Have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

95
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:08,081
If ever you disturb
our streets again,

96
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:12,084
your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

97
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:17,590
For this time
all the rest depart away!

98
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,687
You, Capulet,
shall go along with me.

99
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:26,198
And, Montague,
come you this afternoon.

100
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:36,598
Once more, on pain of death,
all men depart.

101
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:38,076
[trumpet fanfare]

102
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:56,128
Where is Romeo?
Saw you him today?

103
00:07:56,196 --> 00:07:59,632
Right glad I am
he was not at this fray.

104
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,066
Madam, an hour before
the worshipped sun

105
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:04,627
peered forth
the golden window of the east,

106
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:08,072
a troubled mind drove me
to walk abroad:

107
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:10,576
where, underneath
the grove of sycamore

108
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:12,737
so early walking
did I see your son.

109
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:17,580
Towards him I made;
but he was ware of me,

110
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:19,551
and stole into
the cover of the wood.

111
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:27,559
Many a morning hath
he there been seen.

112
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:34,592
See, where he comes.

113
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:44,606
So please you, step aside.

114
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:48,114
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

115
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:51,117
I would thou wert
so happy by thy stay,

116
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:52,618
to hear true shrift.

117
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:55,120
Come, madam. Let's away.

118
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:29,017
Good morrow, cousin.

119
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:35,924
Is the day so young?

120
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:37,725
But new struck nine.

121
00:09:37,798 --> 00:09:39,095
Ay me!

122
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:42,601
Sad hours seem long.

123
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:51,109
Was that my father
that went hence so fast?

124
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:52,611
Hmm?

125
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,112
It was.

126
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:04,252
What sadness lengthens
Romeo's hours?

127
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:11,287
Not having that, which having
makes them short.

128
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:14,425
Hmm. Hmm!

129
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,128
But, Romeo...

130
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:18,296
Farewell, Coz.

131
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,140
[shouting]

132
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:26,636
[woman screaming]

133
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,650
God's me,
what fray was here?

134
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,151
Yet tell me not,

135
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,155
for I have heard it all.

136
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:43,663
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

137
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,427
Soft, I will go along.

138
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,166
But Montague is bound
as well as l,

139
00:10:56,243 --> 00:10:59,178
in penalty alike,

140
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:01,111
and 'tis not hard, I think,

141
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:04,617
for men as old as we
to keep the peace.

142
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:05,617
Oh...

143
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:08,120
Of honorable reckoning
are you both,

144
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:11,624
and pity 'tis you
lived at odds so long:

145
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:15,628
but, but now, my lord,

146
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:17,664
what say you to my suit?

147
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:20,632
But saying o'er what
I have said before,

148
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:24,831
my child is yet
a stranger in the world.

149
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:29,604
She hath not seen the change
of fourteen years.

150
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:33,978
[laughing]

151
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:37,141
Let two more summers
wither in their pride,

152
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:39,082
'ere we may think her
ripe to be a bride.

153
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:41,814
Younger than she
are happy mothers made.

154
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:43,651
[chuckling]

155
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:53,660
And too soon marred
are those so early made.

156
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,669
The earth hath swallowed
all my hopes but she,

157
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:59,672
she is the hopeful lady
of my earth.

158
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,107
But woo her, gentle
Paris, get her heart,

159
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:06,612
my will to her consent
is but a part.

160
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,114
Oh, Peter!

161
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:12,618
This night I hold
an old accustomed feast

162
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:15,120
whereto I have invited
many a guest.

163
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:18,123
Such as I love,
you among the store,

164
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:21,160
one more, most welcome,
makes my number more.

165
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:30,931
Nurse,
where's my daughter?

166
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:33,131
Call her forth to me.

167
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:35,140
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

168
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,698
I bade her come.

169
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:40,110
Where is the girl?
Juliet! Juliet!

170
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,344
Where is the girl?
Juliet!

171
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:48,650
Where is the girl? Juliet!

172
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:51,156
How now, who calls?

173
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:53,215
Your mother!
Your lady mother!

174
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:08,107
Juliet, it's your mother,
your lady mother.

175
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:10,109
Make haste, girl.
Make haste.

176
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:11,906
Where were you?

177
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:18,117
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

178
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:20,619
This is the matter.

179
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:25,123
Make haste, girls.
Come on, come on.

180
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,216
Nurse, um...

181
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:29,023
give leave awhile,
we must talk in secret.

182
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:39,638
Nurse, come back again.
I have remembered me.

183
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:43,142
Thou's hear our counsel.

184
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,144
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

185
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:47,146
I can tell her age
unto an hour.

186
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:48,538
She's not fourteen.

187
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:50,536
I'll lay fourteen
of my teeth.

188
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,541
And yet to
my teen be it spoke,

189
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:54,543
I have but four,
she's not fourteen.

190
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:56,238
How long is it
to Lammastide?

191
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:58,042
A fortnight and odd days.

192
00:13:58,114 --> 00:14:00,480
Even or odd, of all
the days of the year,

193
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,484
come Lammas Eve at night
shall she be fourteen.

194
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:03,985
Susan and she--

195
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:06,488
God rest all Christian
souls were of an age.

196
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:08,990
Well, Susan is with God.
She was too good for me.

197
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:10,856
But, as I said,
on Lammas Eve

198
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:13,020
at night
shall she be fourteen.

199
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,291
That shall she, marry!
I remember it well.

200
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:18,994
My lord and you
were then at Mantua!

201
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,503
Nay, I do bear a brain.

202
00:14:21,571 --> 00:14:24,005
For then she could,
she could stand high lone.

203
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:27,009
Nay, by the road she could have
run and waddled all about,

204
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:30,012
for even the day before
she broke her brow;

205
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,982
and then my husband-- God rest his soul,
'a were a merry man--

206
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,483
took up the child.

207
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:39,010
"Yea," quoth he,
"dost thou fall upon thy face?

208
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:41,956
"Thou wilt fall backward
when thou hast more wit;

209
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:43,014
wilt thou not, Jule?"

210
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:45,027
Nurse!

211
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:46,528
And by my holiday,

212
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:49,030
the pretty wretch left
crying and said, "Ay."

213
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:50,327
[laughing]

214
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:56,038
Enough of this,
I pray thee hold thy peace.

215
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:58,631
Yes, madam.

216
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:02,371
Now, Juliet.

217
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:03,969
[laughing]

218
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:06,481
God mark thee to His grace

219
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:09,916
Thou was the prettiest babe
that 'er I nurs'd.

220
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:11,977
And I might live to see
thee married once,

221
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:13,920
I have my wish.

222
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:20,486
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
I came to talk of.

223
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:21,757
Tell me,
daughter Juliet,

224
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:24,994
how stands your disposition
to be married?

225
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:35,009
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

226
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:37,512
An honor, were I not
thy only nurse,

227
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,481
I would say thou hadst sucked
wisdom from my teat.

228
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,018
Well, think
of marriage now.

229
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:46,021
Younger than you, here in Verona,
ladies of esteem,

230
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:47,522
are made
already mothers.

231
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,024
By my count
I was your mother

232
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:53,028
much upon these years
that you are now a maid.

233
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:54,529
Oh, yes, I remember.

234
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:57,361
Thus then, in brief...

235
00:15:57,434 --> 00:16:00,301
the valiant Paris
seeks you for his love.

236
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,467
A man, young lady!
Lady, such as all the world--

237
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,476
Why he's a man of wax.

238
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:09,478
Verona's summer hath
not such a flower.

239
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:11,480
Nay, he's
a flower in faith.

240
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:12,981
Shh.

241
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:17,986
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?

242
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:21,319
Madam! Madam!

243
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:23,484
The guests have come,
supper serv'd up,

244
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,687
you call'd,
my young lady ask'd for!

245
00:16:25,762 --> 00:16:27,992
We follow.

246
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:32,000
Speak briefly,
can you like of Paris' love?

247
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:37,506
I'll look to like,
if looking liking move.

248
00:16:37,574 --> 00:16:41,010
But no more deep
will I endart mine eye,

249
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:44,012
than your consent gives
strength to make it fly.

250
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:50,519
Juliet, the county stays.

251
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:52,020
Madam, I come.

252
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,527
Go, girl, seek happy nights
for happy days.

253
00:16:58,795 --> 00:16:59,955
[music playing]

254
00:17:08,371 --> 00:17:09,963
[singing]

255
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:24,219
Give me a case
to put my visage in;

256
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,255
a visor for a visor.

257
00:17:26,322 --> 00:17:30,986
What care I what curious eye
doth quote deformities.

258
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,496
Here are the beetle-brows
shall blush for me.

259
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:36,031
Ahh!

260
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:40,494
What, shall this speech
be spoke for our excuse?

261
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,504
Or shall we on
without apology?

262
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:44,335
The date is out
of such prolixity.

263
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:46,272
Let them measure us
by what they will.

264
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:48,503
We'll measure them
a measure and be gone.

265
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:51,513
Come, knock and enter,
and no sooner in,

266
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:55,381
but every man
betake him to his legs.

267
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:58,011
And we mean well in
going to this masque,

268
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,486
but 'tis no wit to go.

269
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:01,251
Why, may one ask?

270
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:05,420
I dreamt a dream tonight.

271
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,258
Ho, and so did I.

272
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,822
Well, what was yours?

273
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,233
That dreamers often lie.

274
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:18,900
In bed asleep while they
do dream things true.

275
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:22,536
Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.

276
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:25,274
Queen Mab?

277
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:30,843
She is...She is
the fairies' midwife.

278
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,478
[laughter]

279
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:33,920
And she comes in state

280
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,424
no bigger than
an agate stone

281
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:38,483
on the forefinger
of an alderman,

282
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:41,792
drawn with a team
of little atomies

283
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:45,027
athwart men's noses
as they lie asleep.

284
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:50,004
Her wagon spokes are made
of long spinner's legs;

285
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:53,509
and the cover,
of the wings of grasshoppers;

286
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:58,013
the traces
of the smallest spider's web;

287
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:03,951
and the collars, mmm,
of the moonshine's watery beams;

288
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,488
her whip, crack!

289
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:10,549
Is a cricket's bone;
the lash of film;

290
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,925
and in this state

291
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:15,658
she gallops night by night
through lovers' brains,

292
00:19:15,732 --> 00:19:19,168
and then they dream of love,

293
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:23,672
o'er ladies' lips,
who straight on kisses dream,

294
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:29,178
which oft the angry Mab
with blisters plagues,

295
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:32,180
because their breaths
with, er,

296
00:19:32,248 --> 00:19:33,681
sweetmeats tainted are.

297
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,186
And sometime comes she
with a tithe-pig's tail,

298
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:40,188
tickling the parson's nose
as he lies asleep,

299
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:45,319
and dreams he
of another benefice.

300
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:49,195
[all] Amen.

301
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:50,732
[laughter]

302
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,564
Sometimes she driveth
o'er a soldier's neck,

303
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:55,069
and then dreams he

304
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:58,505
of cutting foreign throats,
of breaches,

305
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,702
ambuscadoes, spanish blades,
drums in his ear,

306
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:03,211
at which he starts and wakes;

307
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,715
and being thus frighted
tries a prayer or two...

308
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:14,222
and sleeps again.

309
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,224
This is that very Mab

310
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:19,227
that plaits the manes
of horses in the night,

311
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:23,231
and bakes the elf-locks
in foul sluttish hairs,

312
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:26,860
which once untangled
much misfortune bodes.

313
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:31,236
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs,

314
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:34,743
that presses them
and learns them first to bear

315
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:39,248
making them women
of good carriage.

316
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:41,044
This is she...

317
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:44,245
This is she that...

318
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,017
This...is she.

319
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:57,765
Peace, Mercutio, peace.

320
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,200
Thou talk'st of nothing.

321
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:04,706
Thou talk'st of nothing.

322
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:08,903
True.

323
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:13,210
True, I talk of dreams;

324
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:17,218
which are the children
of an idle brain...

325
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:23,225
Begot of nothing
but vain fantasy;

326
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:27,729
which is as thin
of substance as the air,

00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:30,732
and more inconstant
than the wind

328
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,236
who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north,

329
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:38,239
and being angered
puffs away from thence,

330
00:21:38,307 --> 00:21:41,242
turning his side
to the dew-dropping south.

331
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:49,745
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves.

332
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:53,755
Strike drum.
Come, lusty gentlemen.

Romeo, we shall
arrive too late.

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,691
I fear too early...

337
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:10,705
For my mind misgives...

338
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:14,209
Some consequence,
yet hanging in the stars,

339
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:19,214
shall bitterly begin
his fearful date

340
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:21,716
with this night's revels,

341
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:24,719
and expire the term
of a despised life

342
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:27,722
closed in my breast,

343
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,727
by some vile forfeit
of untimely death.

the steerage of my course...

Direct my sail.

347
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:54,240
Enter my poor house.
Vido, vido, welcome.

348
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:59,254
Oh, my lovely Helena,
my lovely niece.

349
00:22:59,322 --> 00:23:02,189
Welcome all!
Be merry, gentlemen.

350
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:05,193
Be lively, ladies.
Ahoy! Ahoy!

Welcome, gentlemen.

352
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:09,196
I have seen the day
that I have worn a visor

353
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:11,699
and could tell a whispering tale
in a fair lady's ear,

such as would please.

[music playing]

She doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

359
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:07,903
It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night

360
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:11,174
as a rich jewel
in an Ethiop's ear;,

361
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:16,776
beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

trooping with crows,

363
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:26,819
as yonder lady
o'er her fellow shows.

364
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:34,065
Did my heart love till now?

365
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:37,628
Forswear it sight,

366
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:42,076
for I ne'er saw true beauty
till this night.

367
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:52,913
This by his voice
should be a Montague.

368
00:27:00,863 --> 00:27:04,663
Uncle, this is
a Montague, our foe;

a villain that is
hither come in spite,

our solemnity this night.

Young Romeo is it?

Dares the slave come hither
covered in an antic face,

at our solemnity?

Verona brags of him

to be a virtuous
and well managed youth.

377

I would not for the wealth
of all this town

here in my house
do him disparagement.

379

Therefore have patience,
take no note of him.

You are a saucy boy.

or you?

What is a maid?

It then will fade

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:53,433
So does the fairest maid

to hush us along

and bitter as gall

Love is a pastime
that never will pall

and bitter as gall

So does the fairest maid

427
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:38,667
If I profane
with my unworthiest hand

428
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,174
this holy shrine,

429
00:33:41,243 --> 00:33:44,303
the gentle sin is this;

430
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:50,579
my lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand

431
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:57,490
to smooth the rough touch
with a gentle kiss.

432
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,823
Oh.

433
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:20,148
Good pilgrim, you do wrong
your hand too much

434
00:34:20,215 --> 00:34:24,151
which mannerly devotion
shows in this;

435
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:28,656
for saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch

436
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:33,660
and palm to palm is
holy palmers' kiss.

437
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:37,664
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

438
00:34:37,732 --> 00:34:41,668
Ay, pilgrim, lips that
they must use in prayer.

439
00:34:41,736 --> 00:34:43,169
Oh...

440
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:47,174
O then, dear saint,

441
00:34:47,242 --> 00:34:51,679
let lips do
what hands do...

442
00:34:56,751 --> 00:35:02,121
They pray,
grant thou,

443
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,624
lest faith
turn to despair.

444
00:35:04,693 --> 00:35:06,627
Saints do not move,

445
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:08,629
though grants
for prayers' sake.

446
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:10,631
Then move not...

447
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:17,638
While my prayer's
effect I take.

448
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:27,137
Thus from my lips,
by thine,

449
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:30,810
my sin is purged.

450
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:44,665
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.

451
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:46,667
Sin from my lips!

452
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:48,669
O trespass sweetly urged!

453
00:35:48,737 --> 00:35:51,672
Give me my sin again.

454
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:58,175
A rose will bloom

455
00:35:58,246 --> 00:36:01,443
It then will fade

456
00:36:01,516 --> 00:36:07,580
So does a youth

457
00:36:07,655 --> 00:36:20,557
So does the fairest maid

458
00:36:29,377 --> 00:36:30,639
Juliet!

459
00:36:30,712 --> 00:36:33,306
Lady Juliet!

460
00:36:33,381 --> 00:36:35,076
Nurse?

461
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,812
Your mother craves
a word with you.

462

Make haste, make haste!

463
00:36:48,229 --> 00:36:49,662
What is her mother?

464
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:51,164
Hmm.
Merry, bachelor,

465
00:36:51,232 --> 00:36:54,167
her mother is
the lady of the house,

466
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:57,170
and a good lady,
and wise, and virtuous;

467
00:36:57,238 --> 00:36:59,672
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

468
00:36:59,741 --> 00:37:00,765
Hmm.

469
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:09,616
I tell you he that
shall lay hold of her

470
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:12,118
shall have the chinks.

471
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:17,688
Is she a Capulet?

472
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:22,119
Ah, dear account!

473
00:37:22,197 --> 00:37:25,462
My life is my foe's debt.

474
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:33,339
What, ho, my mistresses?

475
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:35,137
What, will you be gone?

476
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,644
It seems so, poor God,
it is so very late.

477
00:37:37,712 --> 00:37:39,907
We'll call it early,
by and by.

478
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:42,279
Good night,
sweet, my Lady Juliet.

479
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:48,655
Come hither, nurse.

480
00:37:48,723 --> 00:37:50,657
Hmm?

481
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:52,283
What is yon gentleman?

482
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,657
Count Paris.

483
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:57,289
No. What's he
that follows there?

484
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:01,096
Oh! I know not.

485
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:03,103
Go, ask his name.

486
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:08,608
Hmm. Romeo, of
the house of Montague.

487
00:38:08,676 --> 00:38:10,234
What?

488
00:38:10,311 --> 00:38:13,246
His name is Romeo,
and a Montague;

489
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:15,942
the only son of
your great enemy.

490
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:27,627
My only love sprung
from my only hate,

491
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:32,632
too early seen unknown,
and known too late!

492
00:38:34,702 --> 00:38:36,135
Oh!

493
00:38:36,204 --> 00:38:39,139
Prodigious birth of love
it is to me

494
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:42,005
that I must love
a loathed enemy.

495
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,152
Juliet!

496
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:55,689
My Lady Juliet!

497
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:59,158

[horn blows]

505
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:28,121
Romeo!

506
00:39:28,189 --> 00:39:30,123
Romeo!

507
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:32,125
[laughter]

508
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:35,128
Romeo!

00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:37,630

00:39:41,703 --> 00:39:44,638
Romeo!

00:39:44,706 --> 00:39:48,142
1, 2, 3.

514
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:53,647
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

515
00:39:53,715 --> 00:39:55,148
He is wise,

516
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:58,344
and on my life hath
stolen him home to bed.

517
00:39:58,419 --> 00:39:59,647
He leaped
this orchard wall.

518
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:00,847
Call, good Mercutio.

519
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:02,150
Romeo!

520
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:05,351
[whistles]

521
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:07,394
Romeo! Passion! Lover!

522
00:40:07,462 --> 00:40:09,930
O-hooo! Madman!

523
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:12,330
O-hooo! Romeo!

524
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,496
He heareth not,
he stirreth not, he moveth not.

525
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:18,004
The ape is dead.

526
00:40:18,072 --> 00:40:23,973
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.

527
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,631
Romeo, it's all right.

528
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,301
[dog barking]

529
00:40:29,712 --> 00:40:31,543
But soft,

530
00:40:31,614 --> 00:40:35,778
what light through
yonder window breaks?

531
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:49,888
[bell ringing]

532
00:41:02,145 --> 00:41:04,409
It is my lady,

533
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,508
oh, it is my love.

534
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:11,485
Oh...

535
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:15,012
O that she knew she were.

536
00:41:15,091 --> 00:41:18,527
She speaks,
yet she says nothing.

537
00:41:18,594 --> 00:41:20,755
What of that?

538
00:41:22,598 --> 00:41:27,035
Her eye discourses,
I will answer it.

539
00:41:27,103 --> 00:41:30,038
I am too bold,

540
00:41:30,106 --> 00:41:33,041
'tis not to me she speaks.

541
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:37,546
Two of the fairest stars
in all the heavens,

542
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:41,049
having some business,
do entreat her eyes

543
00:41:41,117 --> 00:41:45,053
to twinkle in their spheres
till they return.

544
00:41:45,121 --> 00:41:48,181
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

545
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:51,693
Oh, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

546
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:54,286
that I might touch
that cheek.

547
00:41:56,132 --> 00:41:57,895
Ay me!

548
00:41:57,967 --> 00:41:59,958
She speaks.

549
00:42:05,374 --> 00:42:08,707
Oh, speak again,
bright angel.

550
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:13,511
O Romeo, Romeo,

551
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:17,019
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

552
00:42:17,086 --> 00:42:22,149
Deny thy father,
and refuse thy name.

553
00:42:22,225 --> 00:42:26,161
Or if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

554
00:42:26,229 --> 00:42:28,527
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

555
00:42:28,598 --> 00:42:30,031
Shall I hear more,

556
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:32,033
or shall I speak at this?

557
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:34,035
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.

558
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:37,834
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.

559
00:42:40,443 --> 00:42:42,138
What is Montague?

560
00:42:43,613 --> 00:42:49,176
It is nor hand nor foot,
nor arm nor face

561
00:42:49,252 --> 00:42:53,052
nor any other part
belonging to a man.

562
00:42:53,122 --> 00:42:56,285
O be some other name.

563
00:42:58,127 --> 00:43:00,288
What's in a name?

564
00:43:00,363 --> 00:43:02,797
That which we call a rose

565
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:05,800
by any other name
would smell as sweet;

566
00:43:05,868 --> 00:43:09,497
so Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,

567
00:43:09,572 --> 00:43:12,006
retain that dear perfection

568
00:43:12,074 --> 00:43:15,043
which he owes
without that title.

569
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:18,512
Romeo, doff thy name,

570
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:21,516
and for that name
which is no part of thee,

571
00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:23,677
take all myself.

572
00:43:26,422 --> 00:43:28,720
I'll take thee
at thy word.

573
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:30,782
Call me but love,
and I'll be new baptized;

574
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,023
henceforth I never
will be Romeo.

575
00:43:34,096 --> 00:43:37,532
What man art thou,
that thus bescreened in night

576
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,295
so stumblest
on my counsel?

577
00:43:39,368 --> 00:43:43,168
By a name I know not how to
tell thee who I am.

578
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:45,036
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself,

579
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:46,472
because it is
an enemy to thee.

580
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:49,340
Had I it written,
I would tear the word.

581
00:43:52,114 --> 00:43:54,548
My ears have not yet drunk

582
00:43:54,617 --> 00:43:57,552
a hundred words
of that tongue's utterance,

583
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,554
yet I know the sound.

584
00:43:59,622 --> 00:44:02,682
Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?

585
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:05,192
Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.

586
00:44:05,261 --> 00:44:07,991
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me and wherefore?

587
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:10,498
The orchard walls are
high and hard to climb,

588
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,830
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

589
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:15,496
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

590
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:17,004
With love's light wings

591
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:19,007
did I o'er perch
these walls,

592
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:21,509
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,

593
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:24,512
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

594
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,309
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me.

595
00:44:26,382 --> 00:44:27,440
Sshhh!

596
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:32,554
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee.

597
00:44:32,622 --> 00:44:37,025
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their eyes.

598
00:44:37,093 --> 00:44:40,085
And but thou love me...

599
00:44:41,931 --> 00:44:43,865
Let them find me here

600
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:46,868
my life were better
ended by their hate,

601
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:50,269
than death prorogued,
wanting of thy love.

602
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:55,009
Dost thou love me?

603
00:44:55,077 --> 00:44:58,240
I know thou wilt say ay,
and I will take thy word;

604
00:44:58,314 --> 00:44:59,747
yet if thou swearest,

605
00:44:59,815 --> 00:45:01,180
thou mayst prove false;

606
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,653
at lovers' perjuries
they say jove laughs.

607
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:07,985
O gentle Romeo,

608
00:45:08,057 --> 00:45:13,154
if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

609
00:45:13,229 --> 00:45:15,993
Or if thou thinkest
I am too quickly won,

610
00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:19,557
I'll frown and be perverse,
and say thee nay,

611
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:22,934
so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world.

612
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:28,170
In truth, fair Montague,
I am too fond...

613
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:33,681
And therefore thou mayst think
my haviour light.

614
00:45:33,749 --> 00:45:34,841
No.

615
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:37,681
But trust me, gentleman,
I'll prove more true

616
00:45:37,753 --> 00:45:39,721
than those that have
more cunning to be strange.

617
00:45:42,758 --> 00:45:45,192
I should have been
more strange,

618
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:46,694
I must confess,

619
00:45:46,762 --> 00:45:49,697
but that thou overheard'st,
ere I was ware,

620
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:52,199
my true love's passion;

621
00:45:52,268 --> 00:45:56,136
therefore pardon me,

622
00:45:56,205 --> 00:45:59,140
and not impute this yielding
to light love,

623
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:02,075
which the dark night
hath so discovered.

624
00:46:02,144 --> 00:46:05,636
Lady, by yonder
blessed moon, I swear.

625
00:46:05,715 --> 00:46:07,615
Oh, swear not by the moon,

626
00:46:07,683 --> 00:46:09,150
th'inconstant moon,

627
00:46:09,218 --> 00:46:13,655
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,

628
00:46:13,723 --> 00:46:17,750
lest that thy love prove
likewise variable.

629
00:46:17,827 --> 00:46:20,227
What shall I swear by?

630
00:46:20,296 --> 00:46:22,230
Do not swear at all.

631
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:26,667
Or if thou wilt...

632
00:46:26,736 --> 00:46:28,670
Swear by thy gracious self,

633
00:46:28,738 --> 00:46:31,673
which is the god
of my idolatry,

634
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:34,175
and I'll believe thee.

635
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:39,237
If my heart's dear love,
I swear...

636
00:46:39,315 --> 00:46:41,180
Oh, Juliet!

637
00:46:57,266 --> 00:47:00,633
Sweet, good night.

638
00:47:00,703 --> 00:47:04,139
This bud of love
by summer's ripening breath

639
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:08,142
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

640
00:47:14,717 --> 00:47:19,313
Good night, good night.

641
00:47:19,388 --> 00:47:22,824
As sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart

642
00:47:22,892 --> 00:47:25,827
as that
within my breast.

643
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:34,202
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

644
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:39,036
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

645
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:42,942
Th' exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

646
00:47:43,012 --> 00:47:44,673
Ahh.

647
00:47:54,256 --> 00:47:58,192
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it.

648
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,990
And yet I would it were
to give again.

649
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:05,633
Wouldst thou
withdraw it?

650
00:48:05,701 --> 00:48:07,965
For what purpose, love?

651
00:48:08,037 --> 00:48:12,974
But to be frank
and give it thee again.

652
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:22,644
And yet I wish
but for the thing I have,

653
00:48:22,718 --> 00:48:25,653
my bounty is
as boundless as the sea,

654
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:27,154
my love as deep.

655
00:48:27,223 --> 00:48:30,158
The more I give to thee,
the more I have,

656
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:32,160
for both are infinite.

657
00:48:32,228 --> 00:48:33,661
Juliet!

658
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:35,162
Anon, good nurse!

659
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:38,667
Sweet Montague, be true.

660
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:41,168
Madam!

661
00:48:41,237 --> 00:48:44,172
Stay but a little,
I will come again.

662
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,674
Madam! Lady Juliet!

663
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,344
O blessed, blessed night!

664
00:48:59,088 --> 00:49:01,955
Oh! I am afeard,
being in night,

665
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:04,117
all this is but a dream,

666
00:49:04,193 --> 00:49:06,627
too flattering-sweet
to be substantial.

667
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:10,688
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

668
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:13,633
If that thy bent of love
be honorable,

669
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:16,136
thy purpose marriage,
send me word tomorrow,

670
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:18,696
by one that I'll procure
to come to thee.

671
00:49:18,774 --> 00:49:21,641
Where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite,

672
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,144
and all my fortunes
at thy foot I'll lay

673
00:49:24,213 --> 00:49:26,875
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

674
00:49:26,949 --> 00:49:28,143
Madam!

675
00:49:28,217 --> 00:49:31,277
I come, anon.

676
00:49:31,353 --> 00:49:34,652
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee--

677
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:35,815
Lady Juliet!

678
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:37,153
By and by I come!

679
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:40,389
To cease thy suit
and leave me to my grief.

680
00:49:40,462 --> 00:49:41,895
Tomorrow will I send.

681
00:49:41,964 --> 00:49:44,524
So thrive my soul.

682
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,262
A thousand times
good night!

683
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,667
Romeo!

684
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:55,471
At what o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

685
00:49:55,544 --> 00:49:56,670
At the hour of nine.

686
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:58,679
I will not fail.

687
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:00,977
'Tis twenty years
till then.

688
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:03,283
Romeo!

689
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,126
I have forgot
why I did call thee back.

690
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:17,690
Let me stand here
till thou remember it.

691
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:21,202
I shall forget, to have
thee still stand there,

692
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:22,430
remembering how
I love thy company.

693
00:50:22,504 --> 00:50:23,937
And I'll still stay,

694
00:50:24,006 --> 00:50:25,940
to have thee
still forget,

695
00:50:26,008 --> 00:50:28,943
forgetting
any other home but this.

696
00:50:29,011 --> 00:50:31,275
Ahh.

697
00:50:48,163 --> 00:50:50,529
[rooster crowing]

698
00:50:56,105 --> 00:50:59,040
Good night, good night!

699
00:50:59,108 --> 00:51:02,669
Parting is
such sweet sorrow

700
00:51:02,745 --> 00:51:05,805
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

701
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:48,717
Woo!

702
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:16,180
Woo!

703
00:53:06,502 --> 00:53:09,369
Friar Laurence!

704
00:53:09,438 --> 00:53:12,168
What early tongue
so sweet saluteth me?

705
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:14,175
Good morrow, father!

706
00:53:14,243 --> 00:53:16,177
Ha ha ha!

707
00:53:16,245 --> 00:53:18,679
Hey!

708
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,427
Young son, it argues
a distempered head

709
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,936
so soon to bid
good morrow to thy bed.

710
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:30,029
Therefore thy earliness
doth me assure

711
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,040
thou art uproused with
some distemperature.

712
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:35,544
Or if not so,
then here I put it right

713
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:38,045
our Romeo hath not
been in bed tonight.

714
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:41,277
The last is true.
The sweeter rest was mine.

715
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,546
God pardon sin!
Wast thou with Rosaline?

716
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:46,053
With Rosaline,
my ghostly father, no.

717
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:49,057
I have forgot that name
and that name's woe.

718
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,558
That's my good son.

719
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:52,560
Well, where hast
thou been then?

720
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:55,062
I'll tell thee ere
thou ask it me again.

721
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,565
I have been feasting
with mine enemy,

722
00:53:57,633 --> 00:53:59,999
where on a sudden
one hath wounded me.

723
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:03,004
Be plain, good son,
and homely in thy drift.

724
00:54:03,072 --> 00:54:05,199
Riddling confession finds
but riddling shrift.

725
00:54:05,274 --> 00:54:09,005
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set,

726
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:11,512
on the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.

727
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:15,017
As mine on hers,
so hers is set on mine,

728
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:17,518
and all combined,
save what thou must combine

729
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,521
by holy marriage.

730
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,523
When and where,
and how we met,

731
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,025
we woo'd, and made
exchange of vow,

732
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:25,424
I'll tell thee as we pass.

733
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:27,019
But this I pray,

734
00:54:27,096 --> 00:54:29,360
that thou consent
to marry us today.

735
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,525
Hmmm?

736
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,796
Holy Saint Francis!

737
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,031
Is Rosaline,
that thou didst love so dear,

738
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:37,538
so soon forsaken?

739
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,541
Thou doest not mock me, Father!

740
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,544
Young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts,

741
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,045
but in their eyes.

742
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:45,546
Hear me, Father.

743
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,549
Jesu Maria!
What a deal of brine

744
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,051
hath washed thy sallow cheeks
for Rosaline!

745
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:51,552
And art thou changed?

746
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,054
Pronounce this
sentence then.

747
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:56,057
Women may fall when
there's no strength in men.

748
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:58,559
Thou chidst me oft
for loving Rosaline.

749
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,562
Doting, not for loving,
pupil mine.

750
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,724
Yes, for loving and,
and badest me bury love.

751
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,735
Not in a grave
to lay one in,

752
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,327
another out to have.

753
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:26,020
Come, young waverer,

754
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,523
come, go with me.

755
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:32,527
In one respect
I'll thy assistant be.

756
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,028
O Father!

757
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:38,025
For this alliance
may so happy prove

758
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,535
to turn your households'
rancor to pure love.

759
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,036
O, let us hence!

760
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,039
I stand on sudden haste.

761
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,540
Shh! Wisely and slow,

762
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:48,543
they stumble
that run fast.

763
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,044
Ha ha ha!

764
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,512
Shh!

765
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:58,052
Where the devil
should this Romeo be?

766
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,554
Hmm?

767
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,991
Came he not home tonight?

768
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,493
Hmm?

769
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:06,994
Huh?

770
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,997
Came he not home tonight?

771
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:09,997
Who?

772
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,192
Romeo.

773
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:14,998
O no, not to his father's.
I spoke with his man.

774
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,505
Hey, Tybalt, the kinsman
to old Capulet,

775
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:20,508
hath sent a letter
to his father's house.

776
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:24,012
A challenge, on my life.

777
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,513
Romeo will answer it.

778
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:28,516
Any man that can write
may answer a letter.

779
00:56:28,584 --> 00:56:31,519
Nay, he will answer
the letter's master,

780
00:56:31,587 --> 00:56:33,521
how he dares,
being dared.

781
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:36,023
Alas, poor Romeo,
he is already dead;

782
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,526
stabbed with
a white wench's black eye;

783
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:41,529
run through the ear
with a love song;

784
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:44,532
the very pin
of his heart cleft

785
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,535
with the blind
bow-boy's buttshaft.

786
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:52,503
And is he a man
to encounter Tybalt?

787
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,409
Why, what is Tybalt!

788
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:59,279
More than Prince of Cats,
I can tell you.

789
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:06,349
Ah, good morrow
to you both.

790
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,494
[sniff]

791
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:13,996
That we should be
thus afflicted

792
00:57:14,065 --> 00:57:16,499
with these
strange flies,

793
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,501
these fashionmongers,

794
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:22,005
these pardonnez moi's.

795
00:57:22,073 --> 00:57:23,506
Ah, Signor Romeo,

796
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:25,007
Bonjour.

797
00:57:25,076 --> 00:57:26,509
Bonjour.

798
00:57:26,577 --> 00:57:29,011
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

799
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,513
Huh?

800
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:33,015
You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

801
00:57:33,084 --> 00:57:35,018
What counterfeit
did I give you?

802
00:57:35,086 --> 00:57:37,020
The slip, sir, the slip,

803
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:38,487
can you not conceive?

804
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:39,887
Pardon, good Mercutio.

805
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,288
My business was great--

806
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:42,518
Oh! Ha ha ha!

807
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:44,527
In such a case as mine

808
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:46,028
a man may strain courtesy.

809
00:57:46,097 --> 00:57:47,530
Come between us,
good Benvolio;

810
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:49,031
my wit faints.

811
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,034
Thy wit is
very bitter sweeting

812
00:57:51,102 --> 00:57:52,535
it is most sharp sauce.

813
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:54,537
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

814
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:56,038
Ha ha ha!

815
00:57:56,107 --> 00:57:58,041
Why, is not this
better now

816
00:57:58,109 --> 00:58:00,236
than groaning for love?

817
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,973
Now art thou sociable,

818
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:04,981
now art thou Romeo;

819
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:07,483
now art thou
what thou art,

820
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:10,452
by art as well as
by nature.

821
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:12,989
For this driveling love
is like a great natural

822
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:14,490
that runs malling
up and down

823
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:16,492
to hide his bauble
in a hole.

824
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,993
Stop there,
stop there.

825
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:20,997
Thou desirest me to stop
in my tale against the hair?

826
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:22,999
Thou wouldst else
have made thy tale large.

827
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:24,500
No, no, no,
thou art deceived;

828
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:28,004
For I was come to
the whole depth of my tale,

829
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:30,129
and meant to occupy
the argument no longer.

830
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:36,934
Here's goodly gear.

831
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:38,436
[laughter]

832
00:58:38,504 --> 00:58:41,268
Here's a fine barge.

833
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,432
A sail.

834
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:44,476
[all]
A sail, a sail.

835
00:58:44,544 --> 00:58:46,444
[laughter]

836
00:58:49,482 --> 00:58:54,112
Two, two; a shirt
and a smock.

837
00:58:54,186 --> 00:58:55,949
[laughter]

838
00:58:56,022 --> 00:58:57,455
Shh!

839
00:58:57,523 --> 00:58:58,490
Peter.

840
00:58:58,558 --> 00:59:00,890
Anon.

841
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,053
My fan, Peter.

842
00:59:03,129 --> 00:59:04,619
Good, Peter,
to hide her face,

843
00:59:04,697 --> 00:59:06,892
for her fan's
the fairer of the two.

844
00:59:06,966 --> 00:59:08,763
Ha ha ha!

845
00:59:08,834 --> 00:59:10,324
Oh!

846
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:13,938
God ye good morrow,
gentlemen.

847
00:59:14,006 --> 00:59:16,270
God ye good den,
fair gentlewoman.

848
00:59:16,342 --> 00:59:17,809
Is it good den,
I pray?

849
00:59:17,877 --> 00:59:20,402
Well, 'tis no less
I tell you,

850
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:22,777
for the bawdy hand
of the dial

851
00:59:22,848 --> 00:59:24,782
is now upon the prick
of noon.

852
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,408
Ha ha ha! Oh!

853
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:29,113
Out upon you,
what a man are you?

854
00:59:29,188 --> 00:59:32,919
One, gentlewoman, that God
hath made himself to mar.

855
00:59:32,992 --> 00:59:35,927
By my troth
it is well said,

856
00:59:35,995 --> 00:59:38,429
for himself to mar
quoth 'a?

857
00:59:38,497 --> 00:59:39,930
Hmm.

858
00:59:39,999 --> 00:59:42,934
Gentleman, can any
of you tell me

859
00:59:43,002 --> 00:59:44,629
where I may find
young Romeo?

860
00:59:44,704 --> 00:59:48,435
[all]
Romeo, Romeo.

861
00:59:48,507 --> 00:59:49,940
Hey!

862
00:59:50,009 --> 00:59:51,442
Shh!

863
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,944
I am the youngest
of that name

864
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:55,446
for fault of a worse.

865
00:59:55,514 --> 00:59:57,948
If you be he, sir,

866
00:59:58,017 --> 01:00:01,043
I desire some
conference with you.

867
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,384
[jeering and laughing]

868
01:00:06,058 --> 01:00:08,390
She will indite him
to some supper.

869
01:00:08,461 --> 01:00:09,826
A bawd, a bawd.

870
01:00:15,468 --> 01:00:16,958
A bawd!

871
01:00:17,036 --> 01:00:18,901
Aah!

872
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:22,236
[laughter]

873
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:24,401
You filthy varmint you!

874
01:00:24,477 --> 01:00:26,342
Here she comes!

875
01:00:26,412 --> 01:00:27,902
Mercutio, no!

876
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,914
Aah!

877
01:00:29,982 --> 01:00:32,416
An old hare hoar

878
01:00:32,485 --> 01:00:35,215
And an old hare hoar

879
01:00:35,287 --> 01:00:39,053
Is very good meat,
in lent

880
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:42,424
But a hare
that is a hoar

881
01:00:42,495 --> 01:00:46,488
Is too much
for a score

882
01:00:46,565 --> 01:00:49,693
When it hoars
ere it be spent

883
01:00:49,769 --> 01:00:50,701
[nurse] Aah!

884
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,067
[laughter and cheering]

885
01:00:52,138 --> 01:00:54,197
Ooh!

886
01:00:54,273 --> 01:00:57,538
[laughter]

887
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:01,569
Farewell, ancient lady.

888
01:01:01,647 --> 01:01:03,376
Ooh!

889
01:01:03,449 --> 01:01:06,316
[laughter and shouting]

890
01:01:06,385 --> 01:01:10,378
Scurvy knave,
scurvy knave.

891
01:01:10,456 --> 01:01:12,617
I'm none of
his flirt-gills.

892
01:01:12,692 --> 01:01:15,559
I'm none of
his skein mates.

893
01:01:15,628 --> 01:01:18,392
Er, cur, lousy knave,

894
01:01:18,464 --> 01:01:21,399
lousy, lousy knave.

895
01:01:21,467 --> 01:01:22,729
I pray you, sir.

896
01:01:22,802 --> 01:01:24,736
What saucy merchant
was this

897
01:01:24,804 --> 01:01:26,567
that was so full
of his property?

898
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:29,199
A gentleman, nurse, that loves
to hear himself talk,

899
01:01:29,275 --> 01:01:31,243
and will speak
more in a minute

900
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:33,244
than he will stand to
in a month.

901
01:01:33,312 --> 01:01:34,574
I'll take him down,

902
01:01:34,647 --> 01:01:36,547
an 'a were lustier
than he is,

903
01:01:36,615 --> 01:01:37,877
and twenty such jacks;

904
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:41,386
and if I cannot,
I'll find those that shall.

905
01:01:41,454 --> 01:01:43,422
Ha ha ha!

906
01:01:44,557 --> 01:01:48,425
Ha ha ha!

907
01:01:48,494 --> 01:01:52,931
And thou must
stand by too

908
01:01:52,998 --> 01:01:55,398
and suffer every knave

909
01:01:55,468 --> 01:01:58,130
to use me
at his pleasure.

910
01:01:58,204 --> 01:02:01,867
Ooh...

911
01:02:01,941 --> 01:02:04,876
Punk rampant!

912
01:02:04,944 --> 01:02:07,879
Pray you, sir,
a word.

913
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:09,244
Ooh!

914
01:02:14,453 --> 01:02:16,387
Beef wit.

915
01:02:16,455 --> 01:02:20,391
[organ playing]

916
01:02:37,476 --> 01:02:39,910
[choir singing]

917
01:02:58,998 --> 01:03:02,866
My young lady bid me
inquire you out.

918
01:03:02,935 --> 01:03:05,369
What she did
bid me say,

919
01:03:05,437 --> 01:03:07,371
I will keep to myself;,

920
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:09,873
but first
let me tell ye,

921
01:03:09,942 --> 01:03:13,378
if ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise--

922
01:03:13,445 --> 01:03:14,878
Nurse.

923
01:03:14,947 --> 01:03:16,380
Shh! As they say,

924
01:03:16,448 --> 01:03:18,882
it were a very gross
kind of behavior;,

925
01:03:18,951 --> 01:03:20,384
for the gentlewoman
is young;

926
01:03:20,452 --> 01:03:22,886
and therefore if you
should deal double with her,

927
01:03:22,955 --> 01:03:26,391
it were an ill thing to be
offered to any gentlewoman,

928
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:27,891
and very
weak dealing.

929
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,396
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady and mistress,

930
01:03:31,463 --> 01:03:33,488
I protest unto thee.

931
01:03:33,566 --> 01:03:34,999
Bid her devise,

932
01:03:35,067 --> 01:03:38,400
some means to come to
shrift this afternoon,

933
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:42,406
and there she shall
at Friar Laurence's cell

934
01:03:42,474 --> 01:03:46,604
be shrived and married.

935
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:48,909
Oh!

936
01:03:48,981 --> 01:03:50,414
Oh!

937
01:03:51,984 --> 01:03:53,451
Here's for thy pains.

938
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:56,420
No, no truly, sir,
not a penny.

939
01:03:56,488 --> 01:03:58,422
Go to,
I say you shall.

940
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:59,582
No.

941
01:03:59,658 --> 01:04:01,353
Well...

942
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:07,956
Sir, my mistress
is the sweetest lady.

943
01:04:08,033 --> 01:04:10,866
Lord, Lord, when she were
a little prating thing.

944
01:04:10,936 --> 01:04:12,369
Good-bye. Oh!

945
01:04:12,438 --> 01:04:14,372
O there is
a noble man in town,

946
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,374
One Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard.

947
01:04:16,442 --> 01:04:20,378
I anger her sometimes and say
that Paris is the properer man.

948
01:04:20,446 --> 01:04:22,880
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady.

949
01:04:22,948 --> 01:04:24,381
A thousand times.

950
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:27,248
Ooh! Ooh!

951
01:04:51,977 --> 01:04:53,410
[sighs]

952
01:04:53,479 --> 01:04:57,415
The clock struck nine
when I did send the nurse,

953
01:04:57,483 --> 01:05:01,351
in half an hour
she promised to return...

954
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:03,854
perchance
she cannot meet him;

955
01:05:03,923 --> 01:05:05,857
ahh, that's not so,

956
01:05:05,925 --> 01:05:07,859
oh, she's lame,

957
01:05:07,927 --> 01:05:10,361
love's heralds
should be thoughts!

958
01:05:11,931 --> 01:05:14,365
Had she affections
and warm youthful blood,

959
01:05:14,433 --> 01:05:16,867
she would be
as swift in motion

960
01:05:16,936 --> 01:05:18,369
as a ball.

961
01:05:18,437 --> 01:05:22,373
But old folks,
many feign as they were dead,

962
01:05:22,441 --> 01:05:26,377
unwieldy, slow, heavy...

963
01:05:26,445 --> 01:05:29,073
And pale as lead.

964
01:05:32,952 --> 01:05:34,385
O God, she comes.

965
01:05:34,453 --> 01:05:35,818
O honey nurse,
what news?

966
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:38,880
O Lord, why look'st
thou sad?

967
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:40,391
Oh!

968
01:05:40,459 --> 01:05:41,892
Though news be sad,

969
01:05:41,961 --> 01:05:43,394
yet tell
them merrily.

970
01:05:43,462 --> 01:05:44,895
[groaning]

971
01:05:44,964 --> 01:05:46,397
Send the man away.

972
01:05:46,465 --> 01:05:49,400
Peter, stay at the gate.

973
01:05:49,468 --> 01:05:51,902
Go on.

974
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:53,905
Hast thou met
with him?

975
01:05:53,973 --> 01:05:55,406
Oh, I am aweary.

976
01:05:55,474 --> 01:05:56,907
Give me leave awhile.

977
01:05:56,976 --> 01:05:58,910
Fie, how my bones ache!

978
01:05:58,978 --> 01:06:01,365
Ooh!

979
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:02,761
[groaning]

980
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:06,269
Sweet, sweet...

981
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,271
Sweet nurse.

982
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,773
Tell me, what says my love?

983
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,775
Ha ha ha!

984
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:16,779
Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

985
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:21,784
and courteous,
and kind,

Where is your mother?

989
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,792
Where is my mother?

990
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,293
Why, she is within.

991
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,795
Where should she be?

992
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,296
How oddly thou repliest!

"Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:40,302
Oh, God's lady,
are you so hot?

996
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,804
Marry, come up I trow.

997
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:44,306
Is this the poultice
for my aching bones?

Henceforward do
your messages yourself.

01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:47,309
Here's such a coil!

1000
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,142
Come! What says Romeo?

1001
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:56,820
Have you got leave
to go to shrift today?

1002
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,320
I have.

[chuckling]

1004
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:03,326
Then, hie you hence
to Friar Laurence's cell,

1005
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:07,831

to make you a wife.

1006
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:10,492
Ha ha ha!

1007
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:14,834
Now comes the wanton blood
up in your cheeks.

1008
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:17,965
They'll be in scarlet
straight at any news.

1009

Hie you to church!

Ha ha ha!

1013

So smile the heavens
upon this holy act,

1014
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,365
that after-hours with sorrow
chide us not.

1015

Amen, amen.

1016
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,869
Come what sorrow can,

1017
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:49,371
it cannot countervail
the exchange of joy

1018
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,375
that one short minute
gives me in her sight.

1019
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,377
These violent delights
have violent ends,

1020
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:55,878
and in
their triumph die,

1021
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,379
like fire and powder,

they kiss consume.

Therefore

Long love doth so.

Ah, here comes

wear out the everlasting flint.

Good even to
my ghostly confessor.

Romeo shall thank thee,
daughter, for us both.

1037
01:08:35,419 --> 01:08:36,852
Ah, Juliet,

1038
01:08:36,921 --> 01:08:40,084
if the measure of thy joy
be heaped like mine,

that thy skill be
more to blazon it,

1040
01:08:42,927 --> 01:08:44,360

with thy breath

They are but beggars
that can count their worth.

But my true love is
grown to such excess,

I cannot sum up
sum of half my wealth.

the confines of a tavern

claps me his sword

there is no need.

and you will
give me occasion.

Tybalt! Tybalt!

1318
01:27:16,429 --> 01:27:18,363
The best friend I had,

1319
01:27:18,431 --> 01:27:21,628
oh, courteous Tybalt,
honest gentleman,

1320
01:27:21,701 --> 01:27:25,137
that ever I should live
to see thee dead!

1321
01:27:25,205 --> 01:27:26,365
Oh, God!

1322
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:28,373
Did Romeo's hand
shed Tybalt's blood?

1323
01:27:28,441 --> 01:27:31,376
It did, it did,
alas the day, it did!

1324
01:27:31,444 --> 01:27:32,877
Oh, nurse,

1325
01:27:32,946 --> 01:27:37,383
oh, serpent heart,
hid with a flow'ring face!

1326
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:40,385
Was ever book containing
such vile matter

1327
01:27:40,453 --> 01:27:42,387
so fairly bound?

1328
01:27:42,455 --> 01:27:44,389
[crying]

1329
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,394
There's no faith,
no trust,

1330
01:27:49,462 --> 01:27:50,895
no honesty in men;

1331
01:27:50,964 --> 01:27:53,398
all perjured,
all forsworn,

1332
01:27:53,466 --> 01:27:55,900
all naught,
all dissemblers.

1333
01:27:55,969 --> 01:27:57,766
Shame come to Romeo.

1334
01:27:57,837 --> 01:28:01,398
Blistered be thy tongue
for such a wish.

1335
01:28:01,474 --> 01:28:03,908
He was not born
to shame.

1336
01:28:03,977 --> 01:28:06,673
Upon his brow shame
is ashamed to sit.

1337
01:28:06,746 --> 01:28:09,271
Will you speak well of him
that killed your cousin?

1338
01:28:09,349 --> 01:28:12,841
Shall I speak ill of him
that is my husband?

1339
01:28:12,919 --> 01:28:14,352
[crying]

1340
01:28:14,421 --> 01:28:16,855
[crying]

1341
01:28:16,923 --> 01:28:19,357
Poor my lord,

1342
01:28:19,426 --> 01:28:21,860
what tongue shall
smooth thy name

1343
01:28:21,928 --> 01:28:24,362
when I
thy three-hours wife

1344
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:26,456
have mangled it?

1345
01:28:26,533 --> 01:28:29,195
[crying]

1346
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:32,670
But wherefore villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?

1347
01:28:32,839 --> 01:28:35,501
Capulet! To the prince!

1348
01:28:35,575 --> 01:28:36,872
[crowd shouting]

1349
01:29:02,969 --> 01:29:05,267
Speak, Benvolio, speak!

1350
01:29:09,976 --> 01:29:11,910
Go on, speak.

1351
01:29:11,978 --> 01:29:13,912
Prince!
As thou art true,

1352
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:16,175
for blood of ours
shed blood of Montague.

1353
01:29:16,249 --> 01:29:19,343
[crowd shouting]

1354
01:29:19,419 --> 01:29:22,354
Benvolio, who began
this bloody fray?

1355
01:29:22,422 --> 01:29:23,980
Tybalt, here slain.

1356
01:29:24,057 --> 01:29:25,854
[Lady Capulet] No!

1357
01:29:25,925 --> 01:29:29,361
Romeo did
speak him fair,

1358
01:29:29,429 --> 01:29:32,364
bid him bethink how nice
the quarrel was,

1359
01:29:32,432 --> 01:29:34,263
and urged withal
your high displeasure.

1360
01:29:34,334 --> 01:29:35,665
It's true, Prince.

1361
01:29:35,735 --> 01:29:37,362
The picture
makes him false.

1362
01:29:37,437 --> 01:29:38,870
He speaks not true.

1363
01:29:38,938 --> 01:29:40,997
[crowd shouting]

1364
01:29:44,677 --> 01:29:46,110
I beg for justice,

1365
01:29:46,179 --> 01:29:48,875
which thou,
Prince must give.

1366
01:29:48,948 --> 01:29:54,011
Romeo slew Tybalt,
Romeo must not live.

1367
01:29:54,087 --> 01:29:56,612
[crowd shouting]

1368
01:29:56,689 --> 01:29:58,623
Romeo slew him.

1369
01:30:09,402 --> 01:30:11,165
He slew Mercutio.

1370
01:30:17,911 --> 01:30:21,711
Who now the price
of his dear blood doth owe?

1371
01:30:26,419 --> 01:30:28,853
Not Romeo, Prince...

1372
01:30:28,922 --> 01:30:31,356
He was Mercutio's friend.

1373
01:30:31,424 --> 01:30:35,360
His fault concludes
but what the law should end.

1374
01:30:35,428 --> 01:30:37,487
The life of Tybalt!

1375
01:30:37,564 --> 01:30:38,895
And for that offense,

1376
01:30:38,965 --> 01:30:40,398
immediately we do
exile him hence.

1377
01:30:42,435 --> 01:30:45,871
[Prince] Let Romeo
hence in haste,

1378
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:48,407
else, when he's found...

1379
01:30:48,474 --> 01:30:51,568
That hour is his last.

1380
01:31:04,424 --> 01:31:06,324
[crying]

1381
01:31:06,392 --> 01:31:08,826
Ah, banishment...

1382
01:31:08,895 --> 01:31:10,328
Be merciful, say death!

1383
01:31:10,396 --> 01:31:11,829
[banging]

1384
01:31:11,898 --> 01:31:13,991
Do not say banishment.

1385
01:31:14,067 --> 01:31:15,329
Arise.

1386
01:31:15,401 --> 01:31:18,336
One knocks;
good Romeo, hide thyself.

1387
01:31:18,404 --> 01:31:19,632
Who's there?

1388
01:31:19,706 --> 01:31:20,832
[bang bang]

1389
01:31:20,907 --> 01:31:23,341
Who knocks so hard?

1390
01:31:23,409 --> 01:31:25,843
Whence come you?

1391
01:31:25,912 --> 01:31:27,345
What's your will?

1392
01:31:27,413 --> 01:31:29,347
[nurse] Let me come in,

1393
01:31:29,415 --> 01:31:31,849
and you shall know
my errand.

1394
01:31:31,918 --> 01:31:33,852
I come from
Lady Juliet.

1395
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,354
[Romeo crying]

1396
01:31:36,422 --> 01:31:38,356
Welcome then.

1397
01:31:38,424 --> 01:31:40,858
Holy friar,
o tell me, holy friar,

1398
01:31:40,927 --> 01:31:42,861
where's my lady's lord,
where's Romeo?

1399
01:31:42,929 --> 01:31:45,625
There, on the ground.

1400
01:31:45,698 --> 01:31:47,131
With his own tears
made drunk.

1401
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,863
[Romeo] There is no world
without Verona walls.

1402
01:31:50,937 --> 01:31:53,371
Even so lies she,

1403
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:54,872
blubbering and weeping,

1404
01:31:54,941 --> 01:31:56,408
weeping and blubbering.

1405
01:31:56,476 --> 01:31:57,875
[crying]

1406
01:31:57,944 --> 01:31:59,377
Stand up!

1407
01:31:59,445 --> 01:32:02,881
Stand and you
be a man.

1408
01:32:02,949 --> 01:32:05,315
For Juliet's sake,
for her sake,

1409
01:32:05,385 --> 01:32:06,818
rise and stand.

1410
01:32:06,886 --> 01:32:10,322
Why should you fall
into so deep an 'ole?

1411
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:11,823
Nurse.

1412
01:32:11,891 --> 01:32:14,826
Ah, sir, death's
the end of all.

1413
01:32:14,894 --> 01:32:16,327
Speakst thou of Juliet?

1414
01:32:16,396 --> 01:32:17,829
How is it with her?

1415
01:32:17,897 --> 01:32:20,331
Does she not think
me an old murderer?

1416
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,834
Where is she?
How doth she?

1417
01:32:22,902 --> 01:32:24,335
What says
my concealed lady

1418
01:32:24,404 --> 01:32:25,837
to our canceled love?

1419
01:32:25,905 --> 01:32:28,840
She says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps,

1420
01:32:28,908 --> 01:32:31,069
and Tybalt calls,
and then on Romeo cries.

1421
01:32:31,144 --> 01:32:34,079
As if that name
did murder her.

1422
01:32:34,147 --> 01:32:36,843
O tell me, friar,
tell me,

1423
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:39,851
in what vile part
of this anatomy

1424
01:32:39,919 --> 01:32:41,352
doth my name lodge?

1425
01:32:41,421 --> 01:32:45,551
Tell me that I may sack
the hateful mansion!

1426
01:32:45,625 --> 01:32:46,853
[nurse screaming]

1427
01:32:46,926 --> 01:32:48,359
Hold thy
desperate hand.

1428
01:32:48,428 --> 01:32:49,861
By heavens!
Leave it!

1429
01:32:52,932 --> 01:32:55,366
Thou hast amazed me.

1430
01:32:55,435 --> 01:32:57,369
Thou a man?

1431
01:32:57,437 --> 01:32:59,871
Thy form
cries out thou art.

1432
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:01,873
Thy tears
are womanish,

1433
01:33:01,941 --> 01:33:05,809
thy wild acts denote the
unreasonable fury of a beast.

1434
01:33:05,878 --> 01:33:07,812
Hast thou slain Tybalt?

1435
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:10,314
Wilt thou slay thyself,
and slay thy lady,

1436
01:33:10,383 --> 01:33:11,816
that in thy life lives,

1437
01:33:11,884 --> 01:33:13,317
by doing damned hate
upon thyself?

1438
01:33:13,386 --> 01:33:15,820
Rouse thee, man...

1439
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:19,323
Thy Juliet is alive.

1440
01:33:19,392 --> 01:33:21,826
There art thou happy.

1441
01:33:21,894 --> 01:33:23,327
Tybalt would kill thee,

1442
01:33:23,396 --> 01:33:24,829
but thou slewest Tybalt;

1443
01:33:24,897 --> 01:33:26,330
there art thou happy.

1444
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:29,334
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend,

1445
01:33:29,402 --> 01:33:31,233
and turns it to exile;

1446
01:33:31,304 --> 01:33:32,737
there art thou happy.

1447
01:33:32,805 --> 01:33:36,332
A pack of blessings
light upon thy back...

1448
01:33:38,911 --> 01:33:41,436
Ascend her chamber,
hence and comfort her.

1449
01:33:42,915 --> 01:33:46,351
But look thou stay
not till the watch be set,

1450
01:33:46,419 --> 01:33:48,853
for then thou canst not
pass to Mantua,

1451
01:33:48,921 --> 01:33:51,856
where thou shalt live
till we find a time

1452
01:33:51,924 --> 01:33:54,358
to blaze your marriage,
reconcile your friends,

1453
01:33:54,427 --> 01:33:57,362
beg pardon of the Prince,
and call thee home,

1454
01:33:57,430 --> 01:34:00,365
with twenty hundred
thousand times more joy

1455
01:34:00,433 --> 01:34:02,526
than thou wentest forth
in lamentation.

1456
01:34:05,872 --> 01:34:07,305
Go before, nurse...

1457
01:34:07,373 --> 01:34:08,806
Commend me to thy lady,

1458
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:11,810
and bid her hasten
all the house to bed,

1459
01:34:11,878 --> 01:34:14,813
which heavy sorrow
makes them apt unto

1460
01:34:14,881 --> 01:34:16,815
Romeo's coming.

1461
01:35:10,167 --> 01:35:12,226
[birds chirping]

1462
01:36:22,506 --> 01:36:25,236
Wilt thou be gone?

1463
01:36:27,811 --> 01:36:32,748
It is not yet
near day.

1464
01:36:32,816 --> 01:36:35,751
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

1465
01:36:35,819 --> 01:36:40,756
that pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear.

1466
01:36:40,824 --> 01:36:43,850
Nightly she sings
on yond pomegranate tree.

1467
01:36:43,927 --> 01:36:46,259
Oh, believe me, love,

1468
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:49,766
it was the nightingale.

1469
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:52,768
It was the lark...

1470
01:36:52,836 --> 01:36:55,771
The herald of the morn,

1471
01:36:55,839 --> 01:36:57,773
no nightingale.

1472
01:36:59,343 --> 01:37:04,280
Night's candles
are burnt out...

1473
01:37:10,354 --> 01:37:17,783
And jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountaintops.

1474
01:37:20,364 --> 01:37:23,299
I must be gone and live,

1475
01:37:23,367 --> 01:37:25,562
or stay and die.

1476
01:37:27,371 --> 01:37:31,307
Yond light is not
daylight...

1477
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:34,310
I know it, I.

1478
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,144
Therefore stay yet,

1479
01:37:39,216 --> 01:37:42,310
thou needst not
to be gone.

1480
01:37:42,386 --> 01:37:43,819
Oh, let me be taken,

1481
01:37:43,887 --> 01:37:46,321
let me be put to death.

1482
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:49,325
I am content so thou
wilt have it so.

1483
01:37:49,393 --> 01:37:52,328
I'll say yon gray
is not the morning's eye,

1484
01:37:52,396 --> 01:37:54,330
nor that is not
the lark

1485
01:37:54,398 --> 01:37:56,832
whose notes do beat
the vaulty heavens

1486
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,162
so high above
our heads.

1487
01:37:58,235 --> 01:38:03,332
I have more care
to stay than will to go.

1488
01:38:03,407 --> 01:38:06,774
Come death, and welcome,
Juliet wills it so.

01:38:09,346 --> 01:38:11,780
It is...

1491
01:38:11,848 --> 01:38:14,681
It is, hie hence,
be gone away.

1492
01:38:14,751 --> 01:38:17,652
Romeo, it is.

1493
01:38:20,857 --> 01:38:24,793
It is the lark that
sings so out of tune,

1494
01:38:24,861 --> 01:38:29,298
straining harsh discords,
and unpleasing sharps.

1495
01:38:29,366 --> 01:38:32,301
Some say the lark
makes sweet division;

1496
01:38:32,369 --> 01:38:36,305
oh, this doth not so,
for she divideth us.

1497
01:38:36,373 --> 01:38:37,806
So now be gone,

it grows.

More light and light,

for in a minute
there are many days,

o by this count
I shall be much in years,

ere I again behold my Romeo.

1513

I will omit

Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

I doubt it not,

and all these woes
shall serve

where that same
banished runagate doth live

1534
01:41:10,327 --> 01:41:14,764
shall give him such
an unaccustomed dram,

But now I'll tell thee
joyful tidings, girl.

Well, then thou hast

hath sorted out
a sudden day of joy.

And joy comes well
in such a needy time.

1542
01:41:38,855 --> 01:41:41,790
Marry, my child,
early next Thursday morn,

1543
01:41:41,858 --> 01:41:44,292
the gallant, young
and noble prince,

1544

the county Paris,
at St. Peter's church,

1545
01:41:47,364 --> 01:41:50,299
shall happily make thee
there a joyful bride.

1546
01:41:51,868 --> 01:41:55,804
Now by St. Peter's church,
and Peter too,

1547
01:41:55,872 --> 01:42:00,309
he shall not make me there
a joyful bride!

No! No!

How now, wife, have you
delivered to her our decree?

1552

Ay, sir,
but she will none,

How? Will she none?

1559
01:42:44,888 --> 01:42:47,322
Doth she not
give us thanks?

1560
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:49,824
Is she not proud?

1561
01:42:49,893 --> 01:42:53,329
Doth she not count her blessed,
unworthy as she is,

1562
01:42:53,396 --> 01:42:57,833
that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

thou shalt not house with me!

get thee to church on Thursday,

1570

or never after
look me in the face.

Oh, father, good father,
I beseech you.

1572

Speak not, reply not,
do not answer me.

My fingers itch.

1574
01:43:22,859 --> 01:43:25,794
You are to blame, my lord,
to rate her so.

1575

And why,
my lady wisdom?

Hold your tongue!

with your gossips, go!

1578

o'er a gossip's bowl,

No!

For by my soul,
I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,

1593
01:44:02,999 --> 01:44:05,991
for what is mine
shall never do thee good.

Father!

1595
01:44:07,337 --> 01:44:12,274
Trust to't, bethink you,
I'll not be forsworn.

Oh sweet, my mother,
cast me not away.

1599
01:44:24,854 --> 01:44:27,288
Delay this marriage
for a month, a week, oh!

1600
01:44:27,357 --> 01:44:30,349
Talk not to me,
for I'll not speak a word.

1601
01:44:32,595 --> 01:44:35,792
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.

1602
01:44:39,369 --> 01:44:42,702
Oh, God!

1603

Oh, nurse?

1604

How shall this
be prevented?

1605
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:47,809
What sayest thou?

1606
01:44:47,877 --> 01:44:50,812
Hast thou not
a word of joy?

1607
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,144
Some comfort, nurse.

1608
01:44:53,216 --> 01:44:55,810
Faith, here it is.

1609
01:44:55,885 --> 01:44:58,319
Romeo is banished...

1610
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:02,756
And all the world
to nothing,

1611
01:45:02,826 --> 01:45:05,761
that he dares ne'er come back
to challenge you;

1612
01:45:05,829 --> 01:45:09,765
or if he do, it needs must
be by stealth.

1613
01:45:09,833 --> 01:45:14,270
Then since the case so stands
as now it doth,

1614
01:45:14,337 --> 01:45:19,138
I think it best
you marry with the county.

1615
01:45:29,853 --> 01:45:31,286
True.

1616
01:45:32,856 --> 01:45:35,791
O he's a lovely
gentleman.

1617

Romeo's
a dishclout to him.

An eagle, madam,
hath not so green,

1619
01:45:46,754 --> 01:45:50,190
so quick, so fair an eye
as Paris hath.

1620
01:45:50,257 --> 01:45:51,690
Beshrew my heart,

1621
01:45:51,759 --> 01:45:55,195
I think you happy
in this second match.

1622
01:45:55,262 --> 01:45:58,026
It excels your first.

1623
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,127
For if it did not,
your first is dead,

as living here,

and you no use of him.

1626
01:46:09,210 --> 01:46:11,974
Speakest thou
from thy heart?

1627
01:46:16,217 --> 01:46:18,310
And from my soul, too...

1628
01:46:20,721 --> 01:46:22,655
Or else
beshrew them both.

1629
01:46:22,723 --> 01:46:24,156
Amen.

[drawing curtain]

1631
01:46:25,226 --> 01:46:26,659
What?

1632
01:46:26,727 --> 01:46:31,494
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvelous much.

1633
01:46:34,735 --> 01:46:38,171
Go in, and tell my lady
I am gone,

1634
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:39,672
having displeased my father,

1635
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:41,674
to Laurence's cell,

1636
01:46:41,742 --> 01:46:44,677
to make confession
and to be absolved.

1637
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:50,176
Marry, I shall,
and this is wisely done.

1638
01:46:50,251 --> 01:46:51,684
Go!

1639
01:47:21,621 --> 01:47:24,556
You say you do not know
the lady's mind.

1640
01:47:24,624 --> 01:47:27,559
Uneven is the course,
I like it not.

1641
01:47:27,627 --> 01:47:30,061
Immoderately she weeps
for Tybalt's death,

1642
01:47:30,129 --> 01:47:32,563
and therefore have I
little talked of love,

1643
01:47:32,632 --> 01:47:35,567
for Venus smiles not
in a house of tears.

1644
01:47:35,635 --> 01:47:36,897
[footsteps]

1645
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:42,573
Oh!

1646
01:47:46,646 --> 01:47:49,672
Happily met,
my lady and my wife.

1647
01:47:52,151 --> 01:47:55,985
That may be, sir,
when I may be a wife.

1648
01:47:58,157 --> 01:48:01,126
Come you to make
confession to this father?

1649
01:48:03,562 --> 01:48:06,030
Are you at leisure,
holy father, now,

1650
01:48:06,098 --> 01:48:08,862
or shall I come to you
at evening mass?

1651
01:48:08,934 --> 01:48:11,198
My leisure serves me,
pensive daughter, now.

1652
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:13,761
My lord, we must entreat
the time alone.

1653
01:48:13,839 --> 01:48:16,535
God shield I should
disturb devotion.

1654
01:48:16,609 --> 01:48:19,942
Juliet, on Thursday early
will I rouse thee.

1655
01:48:21,614 --> 01:48:24,048
Till then, adieu...

1656
01:48:26,118 --> 01:48:29,554
and keep this holy kiss.

1657
01:48:35,294 --> 01:48:37,057
[sobbing]

1658
01:48:37,129 --> 01:48:40,929
Oh, shut the door,
and when thou hast done so,

1659
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,560
come weep with me,
past hope,

1660
01:48:43,636 --> 01:48:47,231
past care, past help.

1661
01:48:57,149 --> 01:49:00,084
Oh, Juliet, I already
know thy grief.

1662
01:49:00,152 --> 01:49:03,019
Tell me not, Friar,
that thou heard'st of this,

1663
01:49:03,089 --> 01:49:06,024
unless thou tell me
how I can prevent it.

1664
01:49:06,092 --> 01:49:09,528
If in thy wisdom
thou cans't give no help...

1665
01:49:09,595 --> 01:49:11,529
[sobbing]

1666
01:49:22,108 --> 01:49:23,666
Hold, daughter.

1667
01:49:27,613 --> 01:49:30,548
I do spy a kind of hope,

1668
01:49:30,616 --> 01:49:33,050
as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

1669
01:49:36,122 --> 01:49:39,114
If rather than to marry
county Paris,

1670
01:49:39,191 --> 01:49:41,056
thou hast
the strength of will to--

1671
01:49:41,127 --> 01:49:43,061
O bid me leap,
rather than marry Paris,

1672
01:49:43,129 --> 01:49:44,562
from off the battlements
of any tower,

1673
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:46,393
or bid me go
into a new-made grave

1674
01:49:46,465 --> 01:49:49,059
and hide me with a dead man
in his shroud.

1675
01:49:49,135 --> 01:49:50,193
Hold then.

1676
01:50:03,382 --> 01:50:04,508
Go home.

1677
01:50:06,085 --> 01:50:07,518
Be merry.

1678
01:50:10,322 --> 01:50:12,517
Give consent
to marry Paris.

1679
01:50:12,591 --> 01:50:13,956
Oh, no.

1680
01:50:14,026 --> 01:50:16,859
Wednesday is tomorrow.

1681
01:50:19,598 --> 01:50:22,533
Tomorrow night
look that thou lie alone,

1682
01:50:22,601 --> 01:50:26,196
let not the nurse
lie with thee in thy chamber.

1683
01:50:34,613 --> 01:50:38,174
Take thou this phial,
being then in bed...

1684
01:50:40,586 --> 01:50:46,650
And this distilling liquor
drink thou off...

1685
01:50:49,428 --> 01:50:52,556
When presently through
all thy veins shall run

1686
01:50:52,631 --> 01:50:55,460
a cold and drowsy humor;,

1687
01:50:55,594 --> 01:50:59,997
for no pulse shall keep
his native progress,

1688
01:51:00,065 --> 01:51:01,464
but surcease;

1689
01:51:01,533 --> 01:51:07,096
no warmth, no breath
shall testify thou livest...

1690
01:51:11,009 --> 01:51:14,001
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death

1691
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:19,984
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours...

1692
01:51:26,024 --> 01:51:30,620
And then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

1693
01:51:33,531 --> 01:51:38,594
In the meantime,
against thou shalt awake

1694
01:51:38,670 --> 01:51:41,969
shall Romeo by my letters
know our drift,

1695
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:43,974
and hither shall he come,

1696
01:51:44,042 --> 01:51:46,476
and he and I
will watch thy waking,

1697
01:51:46,544 --> 01:51:51,140
and that very night shall Romeo
bear thee hence to Mantua.

1698
01:51:53,051 --> 01:51:54,558
Give me, give me!

1699
01:51:54,725 --> 01:51:56,920
Tell me not of fear.

1700
01:51:56,994 --> 01:51:58,757
Hold, then.

1701
01:52:07,504 --> 01:52:08,937
Get thee gone.

1702
01:52:09,006 --> 01:52:11,440
Be strong and prosperous
in this resolve.

1703
01:52:48,045 --> 01:52:49,979
How now, my headstrong.

1704
01:52:50,047 --> 01:52:51,981
Where have you
been gadding?

1705
01:52:52,049 --> 01:52:53,983
Where I have learnt me

1706
01:52:54,051 --> 01:52:56,485
to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition.

1707
01:52:58,555 --> 01:53:00,489
Pardon me,
henceforward l,

1708
01:53:00,557 --> 01:53:03,924
I am ever ruled by you.

1709
01:53:03,994 --> 01:53:06,929
Why, I am glad on't!

1710
01:53:06,997 --> 01:53:09,431
This is well.
Stand up.

1711
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,764
This is
as it should be.

1712
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:51,132
Love give me strength.

1713
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,935
Give this letter
into the hand of Romeo,

1714
01:54:20,003 --> 01:54:21,095
in Mantua.

1715
01:54:50,534 --> 01:54:52,968
[woman screaming]

1716
01:54:56,106 --> 01:54:57,971
Aah!

1717
01:54:58,041 --> 01:54:59,474
My lord! My lord!

1718
01:54:59,543 --> 01:55:03,274
She's dead,
Juliet is dead!

1719
01:55:03,347 --> 01:55:06,145
My Lady Juliet, my lord.
She's dead, she's dead!

1720
01:55:06,216 --> 01:55:07,911
Juliet!

1721
01:55:07,985 --> 01:55:09,714
Juliet!

1722
01:55:09,786 --> 01:55:11,720
Juliet!

1723
01:55:11,788 --> 01:55:13,756
My baby,
where is she?

1724
01:55:16,493 --> 01:55:20,429
[Capulet] O lamentable day.

1725
01:55:20,497 --> 01:55:24,433
Death lies on her
like an untimely frost

1726
01:55:24,501 --> 01:55:29,268
upon the sweetest flower
of all the field.

1727
01:55:36,947 --> 01:55:38,938
[singing in Latin]

1728
01:56:44,514 --> 01:56:47,005
[crying]

1729
01:57:22,986 --> 01:57:24,476
[singing stops]

1730
01:57:44,007 --> 01:57:45,702
Master.

1731
01:57:45,776 --> 01:57:47,300
Balthasar!

1732
01:57:50,514 --> 01:57:51,947
How fares my Juliet?

1733
01:57:52,015 --> 01:57:55,212
For nothing can be ill,
if she be well.

1734
01:57:55,285 --> 01:57:58,118
How fares my lady?

1735
01:58:04,795 --> 01:58:06,387
[sobbing]

1736
01:58:10,467 --> 01:58:12,367
She's dead, my lord.

1737
01:58:12,436 --> 01:58:14,404
She's dead.

1738
01:58:14,471 --> 01:58:17,406
Her body sleeps
in capel's monument.

1739
01:58:17,474 --> 01:58:21,410
I saw her laid low
in her kindred's vault.

1740
01:58:31,988 --> 01:58:35,924
Then, I defy you, stars!

1741
01:59:59,936 --> 02:00:01,028
Live...

1742
02:00:02,539 --> 02:00:05,804
and be prosperous.

1743
02:00:05,876 --> 02:00:08,310
Farewell, good fellow.

1744
02:01:17,013 --> 02:01:18,310
Juliet.

1745
02:02:08,431 --> 02:02:10,023
O my love...

1746
02:02:14,938 --> 02:02:16,371
My wife.

1747
02:02:18,942 --> 02:02:22,878
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath,

1748
02:02:22,946 --> 02:02:26,040
hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.

1749
02:02:30,954 --> 02:02:32,888
Thou art not conquered...

1750
02:02:35,959 --> 02:02:40,896
Beauty's ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips

1751
02:02:40,964 --> 02:02:43,398
and in thy cheeks.

1752
02:02:45,135 --> 02:02:48,400
Death's pale flag
is not advanced there.

1753
02:02:53,977 --> 02:02:55,945
Tybalt.

1754
02:03:01,484 --> 02:03:05,250
Liest thou there
in thy bloody sheet?

1755
02:03:15,632 --> 02:03:19,568
What more favor
can I do to thee,

1756
02:03:19,636 --> 02:03:24,073
than with that hand
that cut thy youth in twain

1757
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:29,908
to sunder his
that was thine enemy?

1758
02:03:36,653 --> 02:03:38,587
Forgive me, cousin.

1759
02:03:49,165 --> 02:03:51,759
Ah, dear Juliet.

1760
02:03:56,673 --> 02:03:59,267
Why art thou yet so fair?

1761
02:04:01,678 --> 02:04:04,545
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous,

1762
02:04:04,614 --> 02:04:07,048
and that the lean
abhorred monster

1763
02:04:07,117 --> 02:04:10,348
keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

1764
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:17,121
For fear of that,
I still will stay with thee.

1765
02:04:21,131 --> 02:04:27,070
Never from this palace
of dim night depart again.

1766
02:04:29,139 --> 02:04:34,577
Here, here will I remain,

1767
02:04:34,644 --> 02:04:40,082
with worms that are
thy chambermaids.

1768
02:04:40,150 --> 02:04:41,913
[sobbing]

1769
02:04:57,667 --> 02:05:01,433
Eyes, look your last.

1770
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:11,046
Arms, take your last embrace.

1771
02:05:13,616 --> 02:05:18,553
And lips,
o you the doors of breath,

1772
02:05:18,621 --> 02:05:20,555
seal with a righteous kiss

1773
02:05:20,623 --> 02:05:23,387
a dateless bargain
to engrossing death.

1774
02:06:01,164 --> 02:06:04,190
Here's to my love.

1775
02:06:31,628 --> 02:06:34,722
Thus with a kiss...

1776
02:06:36,332 --> 02:06:38,061
I die.

1777
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:53,081
Who's there?

1778
02:06:53,149 --> 02:06:56,585
A friend, and one
that knows thee well.

1779
02:06:56,653 --> 02:06:59,588
Balthasar. How long
hast thou been here?

1780
02:06:59,656 --> 02:07:01,089
Full half an hour.

1781
02:07:01,157 --> 02:07:03,523
Go with me to the vault.

1782
02:07:03,593 --> 02:07:05,026
I dare not, sir.

1783
02:07:05,095 --> 02:07:08,030
My master knows not
that I am gone hence.

1784
02:07:08,098 --> 02:07:10,692
Stay then,
I'll go alone.

1785
02:07:12,602 --> 02:07:14,536
Fear comes upon me.

1786
02:07:14,604 --> 02:07:17,869
O much I fear
some ill unlucky thing.

1787
02:07:56,646 --> 02:07:58,079
Romeo!

1788
02:08:09,092 --> 02:08:11,026
Oh, what an unkind hour

1789
02:08:11,094 --> 02:08:14,689
is guilty of this
lamentable chance?

1790
02:08:58,141 --> 02:08:59,574
[Juliet] Ohh!

1791
02:09:07,083 --> 02:09:12,350
O comfortable Friar,
where is my lord?

1792
02:09:14,090 --> 02:09:17,025
I do remember well
where I should be,

1793
02:09:17,093 --> 02:09:19,027
and there I am.

1794
02:09:19,095 --> 02:09:21,029
Where is my Romeo?

1795
02:09:21,097 --> 02:09:23,531
[trumpet plays in distance]

1796
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:25,534
I hear some noise.

1797
02:09:25,602 --> 02:09:28,036
Oh, where is my Romeo?

1798
02:09:28,104 --> 02:09:32,040
Oh, lady, come from this nest
of death, contagion,

1799
02:09:32,108 --> 02:09:33,541
and unnatural sleep.

1800
02:09:35,612 --> 02:09:38,547
A greater power
than we can contradict

1801
02:09:38,615 --> 02:09:40,048
hath thwarted
our intents.

1802
02:09:40,116 --> 02:09:42,550
Come along.
The watch is coming.

1803
02:09:42,619 --> 02:09:44,712
Where is my Romeo?

1804
02:09:44,787 --> 02:09:46,550
[Juliet gasps]

1805
02:09:51,127 --> 02:09:53,391
Come. Go, good Juliet.

1806
02:09:54,631 --> 02:09:56,064
No.

1807
02:09:56,132 --> 02:09:58,066
I dare no longer stay.

1808
02:09:58,134 --> 02:09:59,567
No!

1809
02:09:59,636 --> 02:10:02,434
I dare no longer stay.

1810
02:10:02,505 --> 02:10:03,995
Juliet!

1811
02:10:04,073 --> 02:10:06,007
[trumpet]

1812
02:10:06,075 --> 02:10:08,509
I dare no longer stay.

1813
02:10:08,578 --> 02:10:11,012
I dare
no longer stay!

1814
02:10:51,621 --> 02:10:53,646
What's here?

1815
02:10:59,128 --> 02:11:02,825
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

1816
02:11:06,569 --> 02:11:08,503
O churl!

1817
02:11:08,571 --> 02:11:11,506
Drunk all,
and left no friendly drop

1818
02:11:11,574 --> 02:11:13,508
to help me after!

1819
02:11:13,576 --> 02:11:15,510
I will kiss thy lips;

1820
02:11:15,578 --> 02:11:18,513
haply some poison
yet doth hang on them

1821
02:11:18,581 --> 02:11:21,516
to make me die
with a restorative.

1822
02:11:27,090 --> 02:11:29,524
Thy lips are warm!

1823
02:11:40,603 --> 02:11:43,367
Oh, no, no!

1824
02:11:54,117 --> 02:11:56,051
[man] Lead, boy, which way?

1825
02:11:56,119 --> 02:11:57,950
Search about
the churchyard.

1826
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:59,544
Go, some of you...

1827
02:11:59,622 --> 02:12:01,055
Yea, noise?

1828
02:12:05,628 --> 02:12:06,720
No!

1829
02:12:11,134 --> 02:12:16,572
Then I'll be brief,
o happy dagger!

1830
02:12:18,141 --> 02:12:21,076
This is thy sheath;

1831
02:12:21,144 --> 02:12:24,580
there rest and let me die.

1832
02:12:24,647 --> 02:12:26,581
[moaning]

1833
02:12:44,567 --> 02:12:46,592
[bells tolling]

1834
02:14:14,979 --> 02:14:17,413
Where be these enemies?

1835
02:14:19,984 --> 02:14:21,246
Capulet!

1836
02:14:24,989 --> 02:14:26,422
Montague!

1837
02:14:34,499 --> 02:14:38,435
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate...

1838
02:14:40,004 --> 02:14:45,101
that heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love;

1839
02:14:45,176 --> 02:14:54,915
and l, for winking
at your discords too,

1840
02:14:54,986 --> 02:14:59,616
have lost
a brace of kinsmen.

1841
02:15:02,026 --> 02:15:04,722
All are punished.

1842
02:15:09,967 --> 02:15:12,367
All are punished!

1843
02:15:43,501 --> 02:15:48,438
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

1844
02:15:48,506 --> 02:15:53,944
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head,

1845
02:15:54,011 --> 02:15:57,447
for never was a story
of more woe

1846
02:15:57,515 --> 02:16:02,714
than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.
