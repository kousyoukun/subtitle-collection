1
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,944
WOMAN: There is darkness...

2
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,909
... and there is light.

3
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:41,594
There are men and women.

4
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,476
There's food.

5
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:55,942
There are restaurants.

6
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:02,824
Disease.

7
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,169
There's work.

8
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:21,926
Traffic.

9
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:27,807
The days as we know them.

10
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:33,772
The world as we imagine the world.

11
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:56,378
Hey.

12
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:00,924
Hey.

13
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:10,517
How would you feel about heading home?

14
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:15,313
I've only just fallen asleep.

15
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:17,482
Well, you have, I haven't.

16
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:22,570
I have a tough time sleeping with someone else in the bed.

17
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:27,409
Are you kicking me out?

18
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,577
I have to go to work soon anyway.

19
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,499
We dance and drink all night, we go back to your place, you fuck me

20
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,793
and now you wake me up and kick me out?

21
00:03:36,835 --> 00:03:39,254
I can't sleep with another person in the bed.

22
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:44,009
- That's funny.
- That's just the way it is.

23
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,811
I didn't know you'd started smoking again.

24
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:08,825
What do you feel like doing?

25
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:11,995
Throwing stones.

26
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:15,915
At what?

27
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,795
Seagulls.

28
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:30,430
Sweetheart.

29
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:35,435
- You'll find someone.
- Shut up and throw.

30
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:53,411
I suppose I should go back to work.

31
00:04:58,249 --> 00:04:59,959
Come on.

32
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:02,253
Poor baby.

33
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,932
Lebanon?

34
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,352
Morocco.

35
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:03,398
Morocco.

36
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:10,530
Now that's funny.

37
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:14,993
- What's funny?
- Seeing you today.

38
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:16,453
Hilarious.

39
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:20,123
Come with me for a minute, will you?
They want us at the hospital.

40
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,169
Aren't you going to ask
why I haven't been to work?

41
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:28,131
- Well, you've been sick.
- Not sick, just unhappy.

42
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:31,760
Well, it's the same thing.

43
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:33,845
Unhappy on account of a man.

44
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:36,514
No kidding?

45
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:39,517
So what are we wanted for?

46
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:41,895
Er, to see a patient.

47
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:44,064
- Why?
- What's going on?

48
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:45,648
Well, we're just going to find out.

49
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:48,902
- You know he's really pissed off in there.
- Excuse me.

50
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:50,403
When can I take him back home?

51
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:54,616
Oh, well, we just need to talk to him, so...

52
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:57,118
- He needs to explain it all again?
- Well...

53
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:58,620
Look. Look, listen.

54
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:01,748
He called me up, right, and he told me he was coming home...

55
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,169
and then all of a sudden his voice breaks
and he bursts into tears.

56
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:07,545
Mm-hm.

57
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:11,591
And then he starts telling me
that he doesn't see any meaning to life.

58
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,886
I mean, he's not usually like that.
He's a truck driver.

59
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:15,970
OK.

60
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:19,474
And then he pulls over at the side
and says he's fine again.

61
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:23,687
- Except, he cann'ae smell any more.
- He can't smell any more?

62
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,022
Well, I told him to find a hospital

63
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:28,608
because, you know,
that isn't normal, is it?

64
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:41,621
Hello, er... Donald.

65
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:44,541
Stephen Montgomery here again.

66
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,424
- Hi, I'm Susan.
- Hello, Stephen. Hello, Susan.

67
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:56,344
- You can't smell any more?
- That's right, Susan.

68
00:07:56,428 --> 00:07:58,263
I can't smell any more.

69
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,765
But is your mood back to normal?

70
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,852
I've been sitting here for nearly
11 hours. My mood is not great.

71
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,190
But you don't feel any discomfort
other than a lack of smell?

72
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,608
No, Susan.

73
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,696
And has anybody else in your family
or at work had similar experiences?

74
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:17,741
I haven't got a clue
cos I'm sitting here, aren't I?

75
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,041
- What do you want from me?
- I just want your opinion.

76
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:30,045
I'm an epidemiologist, Stephen.
So why am I talking to this guy?

77
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:33,006
Cos we've got seven more
just like him in Aberdeen.

78
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:34,674
Five in Dundee.

79
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:38,261
11 right here in Glasgow.
18 in Edinburgh.

80
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:40,805
There's over 100 reported cases
in England.

81
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,809
They've got them in France,
Belgium, Italy, Spain.

82
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:49,022
They've all appeared
in the last 24 hours.

83
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,652
How were they infected?

84
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,614
I'm not sure they are.

85
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:59,407
Meaning?

86
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:05,747
Well, all the early indications suggest
no connection between them at all.

87
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:07,999
No contact. No pattern. Nothing.

88
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,008
Is my wife still out there?
Let me speak to my wife.

89
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,344
Please, let me speak to my wife.

90
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:29,562
STEPHEN:
Maybe it'll just go away.

91
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:37,320
- So we won't panic.
- Hm.

92
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:49,040
Michael, that's a table of 12
just sat down.

93
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:50,917
- Where are they, at the bar?
- Yeah.

94
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,170
Where's that lobster and haggis?
I need that right now.

95
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:57,048
- That's table five, mains.
- You're an arsehole.

96
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,758
- What's the matter with you?
- What?

97
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,012
- Those starters for table seven...
- That girl was such a sweetheart.

98
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,097
- What girl?
- "What girl?"

99
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,516
You just fucked her and dumped her,
didn't you?

100
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:09,310
- Poor little baby.
- Theresa, where's those salads?

101
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,981
OK, one oysters, one soup, an antipasti,
two duck and a steak rare.

102
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:14,691
Yes, Chef.

103
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:18,403
I'd have made her breakfast.

104
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,947
Strawberries,
heated the milk for her coffee.

105
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:24,409
But they don't want to fuck the nice guy.
They want to fuck the arsehole.

106
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:26,911
- Next two checks at the same time.
- Yes, Chef.

107
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:29,289
How about those ravioli, boys?
How long on those?

108
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:32,000
- Three minutes, Chef.
- Right, right, right.

109
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:34,336
- Chef.
- OK, how do we know it's fresh?

110
00:10:34,336 --> 00:10:35,879
- We smell it?
- No, check the eyes.

111
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:38,089
They should be clear.
The gills should be red.

112
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:40,717
- It should be firm. And the smell?
- Fishy?

113
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,136
It can smell fishy.
But, if it does, it's not fresh.

114
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,764
It should smell like the sea.
Does it smell like the sea?

115
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:49,309
- Mostly smells of fish.
- Get me another fucking sea bass.

116
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,729
One day.

117
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:57,192
One day, son, you'll be in love.

118
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,571
And you'll be miserable.
Table seven. That's your karma.

119
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:04,449
- Hot pot!
- Truly in love and miserable.

120
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:06,743
Richard, I need that pot back!

121
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:07,911
Richard!

122
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:42,445
- Hi, Jen.
- Hi, sweetheart.

123
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:45,699
- Listen... (inaudible)
- Really?

124
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:50,578
- Do you want to come with me?
- Of course I do.

125
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:51,579
Great.

126
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:08,304
I can find someone else if you're busy.

127
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,765
Don't worry, it might not be that serious.

128
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,851
I'll call you as soon as I know more.

129
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:15,103
OK?

130
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:17,313
You wouldn't happen to have
a spare cigarette?

131
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:19,691
- I'm on the phone.
- Who's that you're talking to?

132
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:23,236
Oh, nothing.
It's just a guy asking for a cigarette.

133
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:24,821
- OK, I better go.
- Yeah.

134
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:26,614
- Bye.
- Hmm.

135
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:29,367
- OK, OK. Bye.
- Have you got a light?

136
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:34,414
How about board and lodging,
while we're at it?

137
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:37,500
Nah, I don't even know your name.

138
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:41,796
Do you have one, though?

139
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:45,133
Shit.

140
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,719
Oh, dear.

141
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:51,097
I'm Michael.
I work in the restaurant there.

142
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,478
- All right, sailor.
- I'm a chef.

143
00:12:56,478 --> 00:12:58,480
Good for you.

144
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,276
Come on, guys. What have we got?

145
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:06,488
We've checked all the Scottish cases
but have no obvious matches.

146
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:08,990
No proteins mutating, no prions, nothing.

147
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:12,786
There's nothing to say it's a virus.
Nothing that matches anything we know.

148
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:15,997
But it's fair to say
it isn't obviously contagious.

149
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,749
It's fair to say it's spreading.

150
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,793
OK.

151
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:23,463
Could be environmental, it could be
a toxin we know nothing about.

152
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:25,965
It could be terrorism.

153
00:13:27,342 --> 00:13:28,760
OK, so it's not a contagion.

154
00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:34,265
I'll tell them... probably disappear
in a short while and don't panic.

155
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,059
Maybe they put something in the water.

156
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,755
Overwhelmed with grief.

157
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:09,926
People are hit with all that they've lost.

158
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,849
Lovers they never had.

159
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:22,355
All the departed friends.

160
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:28,361
They think of all the people they've hurt.

161
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:46,963
First, overwhelmed with grief.

162
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:53,178
And then no sense of smell.

163
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:58,183
That's the disease.

164
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:07,984
They call it Severe Olfactory Syndrome.

165
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:12,489
SOS.

166
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:18,495
TV: This is a cause for concern
and requires a heightened state of alert.

167
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:21,873
But it's not a cause for alarm.

168
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:28,046
We stand ready for the arrival

169
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:30,173
of the first confirmed case of infection...

170
00:15:30,215 --> 00:15:33,718
... the World Health Organisation's
stepping to level five

171
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:36,429
doesn't automatically mean
that the human race...

172
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:00,036
They say it isn't contagious.

173
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:05,709
But who dare believe that?

174
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:34,195
Nothing.

175
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:42,245
Well, shall we call it a night?

176
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:44,372
I don't know what the fuck
we should call it.

177
00:16:44,414 --> 00:16:46,666
Let's go chase some pretty ladies, huh?

178
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,377
- You chase, I'll pick up the pieces.
- I don't feel like it.

179
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:52,672
Come on.
You want to watch that, Rich.

180
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:55,633
That's what happens when you have
too much high-class fanny.

181
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,761
He's been gorging himself
on Europe's finest.

182
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:00,263
- I'm going to get the Entonox quick!
- What's that?

183
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:03,433
Entonox. Laughing gas. Saint Nitrous.

184
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:05,435
Patron saint of pastry chefs.

185
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:07,729
Richard, don't. It'll make you feel...

186
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:09,147
James, leave him alone.

187
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:10,690
- Ssh.
- James.

188
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,276
- I recommend it for you especially, sir.
- Put it back.

189
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,738
What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.

190
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:18,907
Sniff my finger?

191
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,284
Yeah? I can smell that. Oranges.

192
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:23,411
Wrong. Balls.

193
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:26,081
Man down! Man down!

194
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:27,957
Quickly, evacuate! Evacuate!

195
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:32,170
- Good night.
- See you later.

196
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:34,089
- See you later, boss.
- Cheers, boys.

197
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,757
Good night.

198
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,928
- Keep smiling.
- Good night, James.

199
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:59,948
- Got your own smokes tonight, sailor?
- I'm still a chef.

200
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,954
My dad called everybody sailor.

201
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:08,206
He worked in the docks all his life.

202
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:11,418
He never went sailing anywhere
but he called everybody sailor.

203
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:12,919
All right.

204
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:16,673
Even people he didn't know.
"Hello, sailor." "Goodbye, sailor."

205
00:18:16,673 --> 00:18:21,136
Well, you can call me sailor, if you like.
Or Michael.

206
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:25,056
When I was a child,
I thought it was really embarrassing.

207
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:27,100
Now I'm doing it myself.

208
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:29,769
Are you hungry?

209
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:36,693
People aren't eating in restaurants these
days and we've got a lot of spare food.

210
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:57,589
This is... monkfish cheek.

211
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:01,176
Fish is my thing.

212
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,602
- Good?
- Mmm.

213
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,565
Mm.

214
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:26,743
- I'm a bit greedy when I eat.
- Oh, that's all right.

215
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:29,037
I had a disorder when I was younger.

216
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,164
Just trying to catch up.

217
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,838
So what do you do...
when you're not eating?

218
00:19:39,964 --> 00:19:42,592
- Death and misery.
- What?

219
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:46,971
I'm an epidemiologist.

220
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,017
I'll get you something sweet.

221
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:59,776
This is a mango jelly
and chocolate macaroons.

222
00:20:01,152 --> 00:20:02,362
And...

223
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:06,366
I didn't make these.

224
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:09,828
I can't remember what the fuck
that's called, but it's got coconut in it.

225
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:13,623
God...

226
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:17,252
All that sailor stuff, it reminds me of him.

227
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:21,214
My dad.

228
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,967
I miss him so much.

229
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,721
We had so much fun together.
He could always make me laugh.

230
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:29,764
Hey... Hey.

231
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:32,308
I'll...

232
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,102
Let me get you...

233
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:38,815
Here. This is... This is clean.

234
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:43,445
Thank you.

235
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:49,909
OK.

236
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:00,712
Here, here. You're all right.

237
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:04,716
Do not stand so close. You never know.

238
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,844
- Oh, no, they say it's not contagious.
- We don't know.

239
00:21:07,886 --> 00:21:10,180
It's just something we tell people.

240
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,978
Look... Would you... Would you like me
to take you back to your home?

241
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:18,646
Yeah? Come on.

242
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:21,024
You take the cloth. I'll get the...

243
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:22,901
Come on, come on.

244
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:32,989
- Hey.
- It's gone.

245
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:36,576
The smell.

246
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,953
All gone.

247
00:24:08,858 --> 00:24:10,902
Well, I think I'll...

248
00:24:11,611 --> 00:24:13,780
That was a crazy evening.

249
00:24:13,822 --> 00:24:15,490
Yeah.

250
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:48,606
Good morning.

251
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:53,028
Mmm. Well, it has its benefits.

252
00:24:54,195 --> 00:24:56,239
Yep.

253
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:03,288
We were in the Algarve once,
Maggie and me.

254
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:06,833
Came home, had a freezer full of food -
there'd been a power cut.

255
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,669
Never smelt anything so disgusting
in my life.

256
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:11,755
I'll never forget it.

257
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,550
Maybe you will.

258
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:25,101
I've met someone.

259
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:28,104
- Oh, OK.
- I'm pathetic.

260
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,359
I'm not even sure I like him.

261
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:34,569
OK.

262
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:38,198
I actually think he's a smooth arsehole.

263
00:25:44,913 --> 00:25:46,373
Now...

264
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,460
It'll probably come back.

265
00:25:50,502 --> 00:25:53,880
But at the moment our customers
won't be able to smell, so...

266
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:57,133
It'll be like cooking
for snotty-nosed people.

267
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:01,054
Bring out the big guns, all right?

268
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:05,016
Maybe a bit of saffron.

269
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:14,025
Oregano.

270
00:26:17,362 --> 00:26:19,781
Richard, can you get me a clean apple?

271
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:24,869
Life goes on.

272
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:28,415
The food becomes spicier...

273
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:31,126
... saltier...

274
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:32,544
more sweet...

275
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:34,254
more sour.

276
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:37,549
You get used to it.

277
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:45,765
The greater loss are all the memories
that are no longer triggered.

278
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,561
Smell and memory
were connected in the brain.

279
00:26:51,104 --> 00:26:54,691
Cinnamon might have reminded you
of your grandmother's apron.

280
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:58,611
The scent of cut hay
could evoke a childhood fear of cows.

281
00:27:00,113 --> 00:27:03,950
Diesel oil might bring back memories
of your first ferry crossing.

282
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:10,081
Without smell,
an ocean of past images disappears.

283
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,502
I'm off work.

284
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:57,754
Congratulations.

285
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:00,840
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

286
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:03,677
Any more news on death and misery?

287
00:28:04,427 --> 00:28:05,887
Not really.

288
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,224
I was a really good smeller.

289
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:11,309
- I bet you were.
- I was.

290
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,521
Do you want a cigarette?

291
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:17,190
- No, thanks.
- Something else, then?

292
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:20,777
- Like what?
- Oh, er... are you hungry?

293
00:28:21,486 --> 00:28:22,487
Nah.

294
00:28:23,363 --> 00:28:25,532
I could cook you something special.

295
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:28,159
Or buy you a lollipop.

296
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:31,663
We could go for a coffee
and eat apple pie and er... liquorice.

297
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:34,332
A glass of wine?

298
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:36,876
Some fresh air?

299
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:40,964
Come on.

300
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:47,512
My sister got married here
a few years ago

301
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:49,723
and I came to stay for a month and...

302
00:28:50,724 --> 00:28:53,518
- Met a guy.
- And then a good job came up.

303
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:55,270
And now, ladies and gentlemen.

304
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:57,147
We'll call upon a new smell.

305
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:59,858
The scent of the forest
after the spring rain.

306
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:03,028
We imagine the path
underneath our feet.

307
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,116
We see the green moist colour
surrounding us.

308
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:13,413
And we feel the wet branches
against our faces.

309
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,668
And now imagine...

310
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:21,463
- Oh...
- We pass between the trees.

311
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:24,007
- I'm not going on my own. Come on.
- Oh, no.

312
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,593
And we begin drawing in the air.

313
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:28,720
Deep inside.

314
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:30,930
And enjoy the moment.

315
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:37,228
The humidity level is high.

316
00:29:44,027 --> 00:29:49,574
At the lower end there is the moss,
the fungi, the rotten leaves.

317
00:29:55,288 --> 00:29:58,917
The middle tone is the tall, fresh grass.

318
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:02,295
A crisp and almost invigorating scent.

319
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:09,678
And at the top we feel
not only the leaves and the rainwater,

320
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,721
but also the sky.

321
00:30:13,682 --> 00:30:17,977
On a day like this...
we can smell the sky itself.

322
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:34,411
What shall we do now?

323
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:40,250
Well, now you could invite me
back to your place.

324
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:43,837
Don't know if I will.

325
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:48,341
Well, you... you can just start
walking home...

326
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,052
...and I'll follow you.

327
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:06,252
I should have made a bigger effort
to sniff you

328
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:08,296
the first time we were lying here.

329
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:14,928
A pity.

330
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:23,853
What do you want?

331
00:32:25,522 --> 00:32:27,691
What do I want?

332
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:30,944
Yeah.

333
00:32:33,238 --> 00:32:37,117
Well, soon I'd like to close my eyes
and try and go to sleep.

334
00:32:38,535 --> 00:32:43,331
Which is a big deal for me cos usually
I... I can't sleep in bed with someone.

335
00:33:03,601 --> 00:33:05,729
I need to be by myself.

336
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,105
OK?

337
00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:10,650
- Now?
- Now, yes.

338
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:13,486
You want me to leave?

339
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:15,572
I live here, so I guess you'll have to.

340
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:18,325
- Now?
- Yes, please.

341
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:23,371
Did I say something wrong?

342
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,023
Ah... Let me give you my... card,

343
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:54,652
in case you want to, you know...
call me or something.

344
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:56,363
You have a card?

345
00:33:56,404 --> 00:33:59,866
I had a catering company
that didn't do very well.

346
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:03,036
Not very many clients. Lots of cards.

347
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,795
You can call me.

348
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:13,922
My number's on there, and my address.

349
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:16,966
And I guess you know
where I work, so...

350
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,826
MAN: Repent, sinners!
The day of the Lord is upon you.

351
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,495
Do you know that this is
the day of the Lord?

352
00:34:45,537 --> 00:34:47,706
The prophecy has been spoken.

353
00:34:47,831 --> 00:34:51,501
Do you pray?
Are you aware of your sins?

354
00:34:51,543 --> 00:34:54,921
Come back and be aware.
This is the day of the prophecy!

355
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:40,800
Hello.

356
00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:43,678
No flowers?

357
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,646
She loved flowers, Michael.

358
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:12,040
Ian got married...

359
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:14,918
in a church with the full monty.

360
00:36:17,003 --> 00:36:20,173
Apparently, she's pregnant, his bride.

361
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:24,761
And what about this Michael?

362
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:28,264
What about him?

363
00:36:28,306 --> 00:36:30,016
He sounds nice.

364
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,352
I don't know.

365
00:36:32,394 --> 00:36:34,396
I usually pick arseholes.

366
00:36:35,772 --> 00:36:38,692
Well, they can't all be arseholes.
They just can't.

367
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:42,237
- I'm trying to take care of myself.
- Right.

368
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:45,824
You do that a lot, don't you?

369
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,411
Fuck you, sailor!

370
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:54,207
Can I have sweets?

371
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:56,251
Let me see.

372
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:04,092
- What do you say?
- One for you and one for you.

373
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:06,136
Not soap.

374
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:10,974
Big Soap. Big Soap.

375
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,147
Apparently, Big Tobacco and
Big Fizzy Cola have formed this cartel

376
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:20,400
to start selling - wait for it -
fruity flavoured oxygen.

377
00:37:20,984 --> 00:37:24,696
In order to create a proper market for it,
they've enlisted Big Soap.

378
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:29,534
Big Soap have flooded the environment
with enough organophosphates

379
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:32,746
to temporarily disable
your central nervous system.

380
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,748
That's why I've stopped washing...

381
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:37,375
in case you were wondering
what the smell was.

382
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:40,337
You don't half talk some shite.

383
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,843
Environmental groups are sure it's
the start of an ecological apocalypse

384
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:50,388
caused by pollution and genetically
modified plants and hormones.

385
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,351
Intelligence claims
it's an attack on the free world.

386
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:57,437
All indicators point to fundamentalists.

387
00:37:57,479 --> 00:38:01,608
The fundamentalists talk of God's
punishment on a world of unbelievers...

388
00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:04,861
and promise that all pure people
of the right faith

389
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:07,781
will regain their sense of smell
in the final days.

390
00:38:09,115 --> 00:38:11,910
Others talk of the degenerate
capitalist system

391
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,789
that has released a military virus
to stimulate the economy.

392
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:19,918
And there are other theories.

393
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:53,159
STEPHEN: Wake up.
There is so much hatred in the world!

394
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:55,203
There's so much hatred!

395
00:38:55,704 --> 00:38:57,914
- Easy.
- So much hatred in the world!

396
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:00,959
- They're fucking plotting against us.
- Stephen, calm down.

397
00:39:01,418 --> 00:39:04,004
They want to blow us up.
They want to destroy us.

398
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:07,007
Fucking so much...

399
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,301
- So much hatred.
- Ssh, ssh.

400
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:12,804
There.

401
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:17,559
So many sharp edges.
So many sharp edges.

402
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,477
- That's OK.
- Sharp things.

403
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:21,896
I've just given him
as much sedative as I dare.

404
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:24,315
- So many sharp edges.
- It'll kick in in a second.

405
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:26,401
So many sharp edges.

406
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:28,945
- Normally so soft. We are so soft.
- It's all right.

407
00:40:21,873 --> 00:40:23,875
Hey, are you all right?

408
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:26,336
I can't die alone.

409
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:28,380
I'm here with you. I'm Barbara.

410
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:30,006
I work in research.

411
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:32,801
- I've seen you in the canteen.
- That's how it'll end.

412
00:40:32,842 --> 00:40:34,803
Without anybody loving me.

413
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:37,889
Come on, now, just calm down.

414
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:39,349
What's your name?

415
00:40:40,308 --> 00:40:42,310
Oh, no.

416
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:44,479
See, the thing is, your body, OK?

417
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:46,231
It betrays... It betrays itself.

418
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:47,941
- Stop, Michael.
- No, no, listen.

419
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:50,610
Your body,
it takes away the colour of your skin.

420
00:40:50,652 --> 00:40:52,988
And... And betrays your... your spirit.

421
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:54,489
Michael, stop.

422
00:40:54,531 --> 00:40:56,533
Can I get some water over here?

423
00:40:57,158 --> 00:40:58,785
That's OK, it's OK.

424
00:40:58,827 --> 00:41:02,414
Pissing and bleeding and fucking puss
is coming out of your ear!

425
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:05,083
- There's no puss.
- I've seen it. I've seen it!

426
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,960
At the end, you're all alone.

427
00:41:07,043 --> 00:41:08,378
Don't say that.

428
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,547
You die on your own and it gets all dark.

429
00:41:10,588 --> 00:41:13,591
It's not true! Don't say that!
You're not on your own!

430
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:15,593
You're not on your own!

431
00:41:15,677 --> 00:41:19,014
All your body, it turns...
it turns to fucking soup.

432
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:20,306
First the terror.

433
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:23,435
Don't leave me. Don't leave me, Michael.

434
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:25,437
Don't leave me.

435
00:41:27,522 --> 00:41:29,524
And then a moment of hunger.

436
00:41:29,566 --> 00:41:31,568
Oh, my God. What's happened?

437
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:35,238
Oh, my God, what's happened?
What's happening?

438
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:59,090
This is how the sense of taste
disappears from our world.

439
00:44:05,138 --> 00:44:08,016
They don't even have time
to give the disease a name.

440
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:37,879
Do you think
we'll lose our other senses too?

441
00:44:41,591 --> 00:44:43,593
Smell and taste are related.

442
00:44:43,635 --> 00:44:45,637
They're the two chemical senses.

443
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:49,265
So the other ones
might be all right, then?

444
00:44:50,183 --> 00:44:51,893
They might.

445
00:44:51,935 --> 00:44:53,937
Just have to wait and see.

446
00:44:54,938 --> 00:44:56,940
That's right, sailor.

447
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:05,281
And what happens if you're wrong?

448
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:14,791
Then we're fucked.

449
00:47:04,776 --> 00:47:06,778
It's still out there.

450
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:09,823
What is?

451
00:47:09,906 --> 00:47:11,866
The world.

452
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,412
What can you see?

453
00:47:15,495 --> 00:47:17,414
People.

454
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:19,416
What are they doing?

455
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:22,335
They're heading off to work.

456
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:28,091
What should we do?

457
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:33,430
We go to work as well.

458
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:39,477
Do we kiss each other first...

459
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:42,981
Maybe.

460
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:47,485
...say we'd like to see each other again?

461
00:47:48,987 --> 00:47:50,989
We probably do.

462
00:47:51,031 --> 00:47:53,033
Maybe even this evening.

463
00:47:59,873 --> 00:48:00,999
Maybe.

464
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,462
And are we looking forward to that?

465
00:48:06,921 --> 00:48:08,089
Yes!

466
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:18,808
I may not even have a job any more.

467
00:48:23,897 --> 00:48:26,733
Forget it, Michael, we're closed.
We're closed.

468
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:28,735
We'll open again.

469
00:48:28,777 --> 00:48:30,904
People can't smell, they can't taste.

470
00:48:32,572 --> 00:48:34,574
They're going to buy flour and fat.

471
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:37,243
That's all you need to survive.

472
00:48:38,912 --> 00:48:40,914
Take a hit on that. Go on. Go on.

473
00:48:41,915 --> 00:48:43,375
Drink that.

474
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:45,502
Now, that is damned expensive brandy.

475
00:48:45,585 --> 00:48:47,504
Damned, damned expensive.

476
00:48:47,587 --> 00:48:50,757
But you might as well
drink surgical spirit or sniff glue.

477
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:52,801
It doesn't matter.

478
00:48:52,884 --> 00:48:54,427
Flour and fat.

479
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:56,763
- And yet it does matter.
- There's no difference.

480
00:48:56,846 --> 00:48:58,515
No, I think you're wrong.

481
00:48:59,182 --> 00:49:00,892
Life goes on.

482
00:49:07,816 --> 00:49:09,526
They'll come back.

483
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:11,736
People will ask each other
out to dinner again.

484
00:49:11,778 --> 00:49:14,531
They'll toast each other
while we take care of their needs.

485
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:18,326
- Yeah, and serve them flour and fat.
- No, anything but flour and fat.

486
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:26,418
We'll be all right.

487
00:49:48,815 --> 00:49:52,902
Slowly things return to normal
and life goes on.

488
00:49:57,907 --> 00:50:00,577
People do what they did before
as best they can.

489
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:25,518
Within a few weeks,
taste becomes a distant memory.

490
00:50:25,852 --> 00:50:28,605
And different sensations take its place.

491
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:55,256
In restaurants, it's all about offering
another person dinner,

492
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:58,093
letting yourself be waited on,

493
00:50:58,885 --> 00:51:02,430
listening to the trickle of wine
and the clink of glasses.

494
00:51:09,145 --> 00:51:11,648
"Not only has the food
received special attention,"

495
00:51:11,731 --> 00:51:14,985
but also the temperature of the food
and its consistency.

496
00:51:15,026 --> 00:51:17,028
And we tried it all,

497
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:19,990
from the freezing cold
to the scorching hot.

498
00:51:20,865 --> 00:51:23,576
It was dry, it was moist, it was crisp,

499
00:51:23,618 --> 00:51:28,832
it was spongy, it was crunchy
and it was all at the highest level,

500
00:51:28,915 --> 00:51:30,875
up to and including the dessert -

501
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:35,922
a light pudding with caramelised nuts
and a bright orange sorbet,

502
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:40,051
"and a dark blue... dark blue coulis
on blackberries and blackcurrant."

503
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,679
Chew on that.

504
00:51:43,346 --> 00:51:44,681
Great.

505
00:51:44,764 --> 00:51:46,766
Life goes on.

506
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:56,443
My dad let me shave him once.

507
00:51:58,028 --> 00:51:59,988
I was eight.

508
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:02,574
I managed to do it
without a single scratch.

509
00:52:04,492 --> 00:52:06,494
I was very proud.

510
00:52:06,995 --> 00:52:08,997
And then...

511
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:12,083
he went to the sink
and he shaved himself all over again

512
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:14,127
as if I hadn't been there.

513
00:52:15,587 --> 00:52:17,589
I was devastated.

514
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:21,718
Your turn.

515
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,491
Here, try. It's soft.

516
00:52:47,577 --> 00:52:49,537
- Mmm.
- Yeah?

517
00:52:49,621 --> 00:52:51,581
Mmm! Mmm.

518
00:52:56,086 --> 00:52:58,088
- Want to go dancing?
- Sure.

519
00:52:58,129 --> 00:52:59,547
- And get drunk?
- Sure.

520
00:52:59,589 --> 00:53:01,299
- And smoke cigarettes?
- Always.

521
00:53:01,341 --> 00:53:05,261
- There's still pleasures in the world, eh?
- Let's have them. All of them.

522
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:30,161
I got soap in my eye!

523
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:43,800
# No-one sentenced us

524
00:53:44,843 --> 00:53:46,845
Let's play a game, sailor.

525
00:53:46,845 --> 00:53:48,471
What game?

526
00:53:48,596 --> 00:53:50,557
It's called, "Make me special".

527
00:53:50,598 --> 00:53:52,600
What are the rules?

528
00:53:52,642 --> 00:53:54,144
Only one.

529
00:53:54,185 --> 00:53:56,187
Just tell me something.

530
00:53:56,229 --> 00:53:57,981
Something...?

531
00:53:57,981 --> 00:54:00,608
Something other people
don't know about you.

532
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,778
- Something secret.
- Like what?

533
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:08,158
# Unpoliced

534
00:54:10,785 --> 00:54:14,414
My sister's got two kids
and sometimes I hate them.

535
00:54:14,456 --> 00:54:16,458
# We drew uncertain breath

536
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:20,128
# The loss piled high unchecked

537
00:54:26,843 --> 00:54:28,845
I can't have children.

538
00:54:34,893 --> 00:54:36,895
My ovaries are crippled.

539
00:54:36,895 --> 00:54:38,897
My eggs are no good.

540
00:54:40,273 --> 00:54:42,275
Because of not eating.

541
00:54:45,737 --> 00:54:49,616
I pretend that I'm not that into them,
that I have an interesting job.

542
00:54:53,286 --> 00:54:54,871
Anyway...

543
00:54:57,123 --> 00:54:58,750
...I can't have them.

544
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:06,049
Your turn.

545
00:55:11,304 --> 00:55:12,847
I had a girlfriend.

546
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:15,517
You don't get this game, do you?

547
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:18,520
No, we had erm... a wedding planned.

548
00:55:20,689 --> 00:55:22,607
And she got sick.

549
00:55:23,525 --> 00:55:25,443
She got really sick.

550
00:55:26,361 --> 00:55:30,532
You could smell there was something
wrong inside her, like something damp,

551
00:55:30,573 --> 00:55:32,575
something from a basement.

552
00:55:36,454 --> 00:55:38,456
I didn't stay with her.

553
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,292
I didn't look after her, I ran away.

554
00:55:45,171 --> 00:55:47,173
I make myself go and visit her grave.

555
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:51,177
At first it was once a week
and then maybe it was once a month

556
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:52,595
and now less.

557
00:55:54,305 --> 00:55:56,307
I go there to feel guilty, you know?

558
00:55:57,892 --> 00:56:01,146
I thought I would feel guilty
for the rest of my life but...

559
00:56:03,106 --> 00:56:05,108
...actually it's starting to fade.

560
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:07,193
# And no song was sung

561
00:56:11,823 --> 00:56:14,200
- You're an arsehole?
- I am.

562
00:56:16,995 --> 00:56:19,789
# No voice was raised

563
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:29,341
It works.

564
00:56:30,675 --> 00:56:32,135
It works.

565
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:34,137
You're making me yours.

566
00:56:34,137 --> 00:56:36,139
- I'm an arsehole.
- So am I.

567
00:56:36,222 --> 00:56:38,224
A couple of arseholes.

568
00:56:39,225 --> 00:56:41,227
Mr and Mrs Arsehole.

569
00:56:52,906 --> 00:56:54,908
# No song was sung

570
00:57:06,294 --> 00:57:09,881
So this is the situation here in Bangkok,
Thailand.

571
00:57:09,964 --> 00:57:12,425
We call it Severe
Hearing Loss Syndrome,

572
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:14,469
and we still do not know much about it.

573
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:16,513
Anger, rage, hate.

574
00:57:17,555 --> 00:57:19,265
And then they go deaf.

575
00:57:19,307 --> 00:57:21,434
And how does it spread?

576
00:57:25,855 --> 00:57:29,693
I can't hear you very well but I do not
know what to do. Tell me what to do.

577
00:57:31,236 --> 00:57:33,196
... standing there looking at me!

578
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:38,493
Why are you just looking at me?

579
00:57:40,495 --> 00:57:42,497
You help us now!

580
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,918
... help us now!

581
00:57:47,002 --> 00:57:49,295
... send some help quick!

582
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:53,550
Send some help now!

583
00:58:01,683 --> 00:58:03,643
I think it's OK to panic now.

584
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:08,231
And that's basically
what the world does.

585
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:10,233
Severe Hearing Loss Syndrome.

586
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:12,819
Spreads from Thailand,

587
00:58:13,528 --> 00:58:15,697
across India to China,

588
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,741
Russia and beyond.

589
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:55,362
Rage.

590
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:56,905
Anger.

591
00:58:57,947 --> 00:58:58,990
Hatred.

592
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,202
And then the loss of another sense.

593
00:59:11,628 --> 00:59:14,339
All the unaffected can do is wait.

594
00:59:38,071 --> 00:59:41,700
- Can you still get film for those?
- Yeah, I got some from my uncle.

595
00:59:43,827 --> 00:59:45,787
He was a collector.

596
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:47,831
What did he collect?

597
00:59:48,665 --> 00:59:50,917
Polaroid cameras.

598
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:17,694
Incubation period is dropping all the time.
It's down from 24 hours to about 11.

599
01:00:17,736 --> 01:00:19,154
It's very aggressive.

600
01:00:19,195 --> 01:00:21,281
Yeah?

601
01:00:22,866 --> 01:00:25,785
Yeah, we stick with the 2006 plan.

602
01:00:25,827 --> 01:00:27,829
- Stephen.
- OK?

603
01:00:28,705 --> 01:00:30,290
It's still valid.

604
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:33,001
Isolate the first ones,
get ready for loads more.

605
01:00:34,044 --> 01:00:37,047
They're saying a child was born
in Berlin with all its senses.

606
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:40,008
There might be a chance of antibodies.

607
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:48,391
- What's going on?
- Somebody's infected on the third floor.

608
01:00:48,475 --> 01:00:50,727
- They sealed it off.
- Who owns this restaurant?

609
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:53,104
- Me.
- You're shutting down.

610
01:00:53,188 --> 01:00:56,191
- Give me a fucking break.
- Everywhere is shutting down.

611
01:00:56,232 --> 01:00:59,694
The council wants to hire you and
your staff to cook for the quarantined.

612
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:02,405
Thousands are holed up in their homes,
sports arenas.

613
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:04,449
They all need to be fed
three times a day.

614
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:07,452
- Here's your menu and budget.
- Municipal food?

615
01:01:07,452 --> 01:01:10,455
Other restaurants will do it.
If you don't want the job, just say no.

616
01:01:10,538 --> 01:01:13,541
- That's all I need to hear, a no.
- Aye, all right. We'll do it.

617
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:16,461
Aye, very moving.
You'll have us in tears in a minute.

618
01:01:17,045 --> 01:01:18,922
- Fuck you.
- We're just trying to do our jobs.

619
01:01:19,005 --> 01:01:22,550
- We're trying to keep things working.
- Bouillon and fusilli?

620
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:25,387
- Make sure that pasta's al dente.
- Fat and flour.

621
01:01:25,387 --> 01:01:27,389
Fat and fucking flour.

622
01:02:02,674 --> 01:02:04,342
You're homeless.

623
01:02:04,426 --> 01:02:05,468
Shit.

624
01:02:05,468 --> 01:02:08,847
TANNOY: Stay away from anyone
showing symptoms of aggression.

625
01:02:11,266 --> 01:02:14,060
You can choose between
a gym full of those not infected

626
01:02:14,102 --> 01:02:17,230
out behind the bus station,
or you can come home with me.

627
01:02:19,065 --> 01:02:20,483
Tough one.

628
01:02:38,376 --> 01:02:40,378
What?

629
01:02:49,846 --> 01:02:52,974
Stay away from people
showing symptoms of aggression.

630
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:55,870
MICHAEL: Oh, Jesus.

631
01:04:20,729 --> 01:04:23,064
So all of a sudden, we're living together.

632
01:04:23,148 --> 01:04:24,357
Yeah.

633
01:04:24,441 --> 01:04:26,109
Mr and Mrs Arsehole.

634
01:04:29,988 --> 01:04:32,240
We could play
"make me special" games.

635
01:04:33,325 --> 01:04:35,327
We could play at---as lovers.

636
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,122
And we could fuck.

637
01:04:42,709 --> 01:04:44,669
But you're just like all the others.

638
01:04:46,379 --> 01:04:49,007
Don't you think that you matter,
cos you don't.

639
01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:50,675
You're nothing.

640
01:04:50,759 --> 01:04:52,469
You are just passing time.

641
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:54,471
It's not difficult to understand.

642
01:04:54,512 --> 01:04:56,222
It's just fucking.

643
01:04:56,264 --> 01:04:58,850
And eating. And fat and flour.

644
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:04,898
You go out there, you lie down
on your back and spread your legs.

645
01:05:05,482 --> 01:05:09,361
Or take your profound conversations
and your emotions and fuck off.

646
01:05:11,488 --> 01:05:13,573
You're just a pair of ears and a mouth,

647
01:05:13,657 --> 01:05:15,241
an arsehole and a cunt.

648
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:18,411
It might surprise you to know this
but everyone else has that too.

649
01:05:18,912 --> 01:05:21,414
A pair of ears and an arsehole.

650
01:05:21,498 --> 01:05:23,375
Fat and fucking flour.

651
01:05:23,416 --> 01:05:25,377
Nothing special about this one,

652
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,420
except that she's infertile.

653
01:05:28,296 --> 01:05:31,049
Fat and flour. Fat and flour!

654
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:33,093
Fat and fucking flour!

655
01:05:33,885 --> 01:05:36,346
Fat and fucking flour!

656
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,183
Fat and flour!

657
01:05:40,934 --> 01:05:43,144
Fat, fat, fucking flour!

658
01:06:01,705 --> 01:06:03,915
Aargh! Oh, God!

659
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:02,640
Let me in! Let me in!

660
01:07:02,682 --> 01:07:04,768
Take me with you. Hey!

661
01:07:04,768 --> 01:07:05,894
Hey!

662
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:07,937
Come on, let me in!

663
01:08:31,062 --> 01:08:33,064
SUSAN: Hello?

664
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:48,872
Can you hear me?

665
01:08:50,415 --> 01:08:51,833
Pardon?

666
01:08:55,378 --> 01:08:56,963
Seen anyone else?

667
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:22,674
MICHAEL:
I hope you can hear this.

668
01:10:23,717 --> 01:10:25,927
Whatever I said to you, I didn't mean.

669
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:28,805
It wasn't me.

670
01:10:28,888 --> 01:10:30,890
It was the disease.

671
01:10:38,023 --> 01:10:39,566
It was not you.

672
01:10:40,233 --> 01:10:41,943
It was not you.

673
01:10:42,027 --> 01:10:44,029
It's not me.

674
01:10:44,029 --> 01:10:45,989
It's nobody.

675
01:10:46,031 --> 01:10:47,490
Nothing.

676
01:10:47,574 --> 01:10:49,576
Nobody's here. Nobody.

677
01:10:49,617 --> 01:10:50,785
No.

678
01:10:52,996 --> 01:10:54,956
Disease. Which disease?

679
01:10:56,499 --> 01:10:58,043
Where is it?

680
01:10:58,126 --> 01:11:00,045
Where are you hiding, you fucking cunt?

681
01:11:18,813 --> 01:11:20,649
Where are you?

682
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:22,776
MICHAEL:
I need you to come back to me.

683
01:11:22,817 --> 01:11:25,779
Take that... Nothing!

684
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,280
I need you to believe me.

685
01:11:31,117 --> 01:11:33,119
It's me.

686
01:11:33,161 --> 01:11:35,121
Why? Why?

687
01:11:35,205 --> 01:11:37,457
- Why?
- It's me asking you to come back.

688
01:11:37,457 --> 01:11:39,501
Why, why, why, why, why?

689
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:41,544
Why, why?

690
01:11:42,837 --> 01:11:45,090
- I love you.
- You're all fucking liars!

691
01:16:29,165 --> 01:16:31,710
There are two movements now.

692
01:16:31,793 --> 01:16:35,922
There are the people who run through
the streets, grabbing all they can.

693
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:40,760
People who don't believe in anything
but the end of the world.

694
01:16:44,014 --> 01:16:46,516
Then there's the other movement -

695
01:16:46,558 --> 01:16:49,394
farmers going out to milk their cows...

696
01:16:50,312 --> 01:16:52,647
... soldiers reporting for duty.

697
01:17:00,864 --> 01:17:03,742
Those who believe
that life will go on somehow...

698
01:17:05,952 --> 01:17:08,371
... or just don't know what else to do.

699
01:20:37,038 --> 01:20:39,416
People prepare for the worst...

700
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,754
... but hope for the best.

701
01:20:48,758 --> 01:20:51,928
They concentrate on the things
that are important to them.

702
01:21:05,066 --> 01:21:08,236
All the things beyond fat and flour.

703
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:24,562
Once we thought of the ice age
as something that crept up -

704
01:22:24,604 --> 01:22:27,107
glaciers slowly spreading...

705
01:22:27,148 --> 01:22:29,567
temperatures gradually dropping.

706
01:22:34,155 --> 01:22:37,742
But recently a number of intact
mammoths have been discovered

707
01:22:37,784 --> 01:22:40,453
with stomachs full of undigested grass.

708
01:22:43,164 --> 01:22:46,126
The cold must have hit them
like a blow from a club.

709
01:22:57,178 --> 01:23:00,348
That's how the darkness
descends upon the world.

710
01:23:18,575 --> 01:23:20,827
But first the shining moments.

711
01:23:32,088 --> 01:23:35,175
A shared flinching
of the brain's temporal lobe.

712
01:24:02,118 --> 01:24:06,247
A profound appreciation
of what it means to be alive.

713
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:21,888
But most of all, a shared urge
to reach out to one another.

714
01:24:26,643 --> 01:24:28,979
To offer warmth...

715
01:24:31,523 --> 01:24:33,733
... understanding...

716
01:24:35,735 --> 01:24:38,196
... acceptance...

717
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,575
... forgiveness...

718
01:24:46,621 --> 01:24:48,581
... love.

719
01:27:00,797 --> 01:27:03,383
It's dark now...

720
01:27:03,425 --> 01:27:05,593
but they feel each other's breath...

721
01:27:05,635 --> 01:27:07,804
and they know all they need to know.

722
01:27:08,847 --> 01:27:11,182
They kiss...

723
01:27:11,224 --> 01:27:14,060
and they feel each other's tears
on their cheeks.

724
01:27:15,061 --> 01:27:18,356
And if there had been
anybody left to see them,

725
01:27:18,398 --> 01:27:22,777
then they would look like normal lovers
caressing each other's faces...

726
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:25,613
... bodies close together...

727
01:27:25,655 --> 01:27:27,490
eyes closed...

728
01:27:28,241 --> 01:27:30,660
... oblivious to the world around them.

729
01:27:31,619 --> 01:27:33,788
Because that is how life goes on.

730
01:27:35,081 --> 01:27:37,083
Like that.
