Wahhhhh! Agh!

Aghhhh!

Dougal! I knew you'd make it. 

43
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,720
- You're just in time for the concert. 
- Yes, Florence, of course. 

44
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,960
- Wouldn't miss it for the world. 
- You don't get a sugar lump for coming. 

45
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,400
Sugar? Who needs sugar? 

46
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,840
Not me, I quit. This morning!

Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. 

83
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,920
What an unforeseeable accident. That's not an easy fix, that. 

84
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,840
We're looking at a multiple abrasion friction gash. 

85
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,760
I did not know you were a qualified mechanic, Dougal. 

86
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,320
Of course! If you bring me an air pump, some glue, four watermelons, 

87
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,640
water-skis, a trombone and a pack of gobstoppers, I may be able to help. 

88
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,000
I am lucky you were here. 

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,720
- Will you take care of my things? 
- Oh, I'll take care of them all right. 

90
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,680
Mmmm...I think I'll take care of those lollipops first 

91
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,640
and then, ooh, those sherbets and, ohh-ooh-ooh, those caramel creams.

- Thank you. Thank you. 
- Encore! Encore! 

95
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,360
Thank you. So sweet. 

96
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,920
- Now, for my next number, I shall... 
- Wahhhhh!

GIRL SCREAMS 

100
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,600
Get me off! How do I stop this thing?! 

101
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,080
- Please, help me! 
- SHE SCREAMS 

102
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,240
Ooh! 

103
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,000
Agh! Agh! Help! Wahhhh! 

104
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,800
- He's always got to make a big entrance. 
- BANG! 

105
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,400
- HE GASPS 
- Oh, dear. That's not good. 

106
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,920
SCREAMING 

107
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,960
- Hold on tight, children! 
- BOTH: Help! 

108
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,520
- Mr Rusty! 
- Whoa! Ooh! 

109
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,680
Quick! Turn it off! 

110
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,840
Oh, my goodness! It's out of control! 

111
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,440
MENACING LAUGHTER 

112
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,880
Ooh! Wh-what's happening? 

113
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,600
- This is too Wagnerian for words. 
- Oh, Florence! 

114
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,560
- What was that? 
- Bad trip! 

115
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,040
Puccini preserve us! What's happened to the roundabout? 

116
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,480
Uh! Oh, no! What's happening? 

117
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,560
- Florence! Are you all right? 
- Dougal, I'm cold! 

118
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,240
Don't worry, we'll get you out of there. 

119
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,960
What on earth shall we do? 

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,280
ALL: Zebedee! Zebedee! Zebedee! 

121
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,760
- Zebedee, thank goodness. 
- Whatever's the matter, my friends? 

122
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,280
- Something awful has happened. 
- Look. 

123
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,680
Oh, no! I hoped this day would never come. 

124
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,720
What, Tuesdays? But Tuesdays are great! 

125
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,000
- On Tuesdays we make cake. 
- No, Dougal, the day Zeebad escapes. 

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,360
- Zeebad? I thought that was just a shaggy-dog story. 
- I'm afraid not. 

127
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,240
He's all too real. Cold-hearted, tyrannous and cruel. 

128
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,880
For thousands of years he kept our world bound in ice. 

129
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,320
EVIL LAUGHTER 

130
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,520
And now you've released him, 

131
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,280
he's free to wield his terrifying power once more. 

132
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,200
SNIFFS 

133
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,840

ZEEBAD LAUGHS MENACINGLY 

137
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,400
Ooooh! Free, at last. 

138
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,960
It took 10,000 years 

139
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,800
but the best things are worth waiting for - 

140
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,360
power, revenge 

141
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,280
and, er...more power! 

142
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,840
- Grr! 
- HE LAUGHS 

143
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,000
HE GASPS 

144
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,800
Cold, but not cold enough for my liking. 

145
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,640
Ha-ha! Soon it'll be nice and frozen everywhere, 

146
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,480
just like it was before Zebedee ruined everything. 

147
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,680
Now, where to begin... 

148
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,280
Eh? 

149
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,760
Ah, what's this? 

150
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,920
Oooh, just what I need. 

151
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,960
A henchman! 

152
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,640
Today, one soldier, tomorrow, the world! 

153
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,480
And then, perhaps, three more soldiers. 

154
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,320
- HE LAUGHS 
- Ooh. Focus, Zeebad. 

155
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,360
Focus! 

156
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,160
I've done it. A lean, mean, fighting machine 

157
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,280
who'll obey my every command. 

158
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,120
Eyes right! Quick march! 

159
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,960
# He's a lean, mean fighting machine 

160
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,440
# The real team You know what I mean 

161
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,240
# Marching along And he will take you on 

162
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,000
# Watch out, here he comes He's a fighting machine. # 

163
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,040
Agh!

CLANG! 

165
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,920
Attention! 

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,880
- Name. 
- Sergeant Sam, first decorative clockwork regiment, sir! 

167
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,560
Good. From now on, your mission is to help me recover 

168
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,320
- three diamonds taken from me by a treacherous thief. 
- Oh. 

169
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,760
The road will be hard. 

170
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,200
Pain, misery and torment will be your constant companion. 

171
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,560
And your only release 

172
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,760
- will be death. 
- HE GULPS 

173
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,320
Oh. Er...can I ask about holidays? 

174
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,680
- Three weeks in summer. 
- Very generous, sir. 

175
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,400
Not that it will ever be summer again. 

176
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Oh. 

177
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,280
Now, let's see what that worm Zebedee is up to. 

178
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,720
Well, well. He's got some little friends, has he? 

179
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,280
I'll soon see to them. 

180
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,440
To my old lair. We shall plan our line of attack. 

181
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,080
Only by returning the enchanted diamonds 

182
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,760
to their original places on the roundabout will you defeat Zeebad. 

183
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,440
But if he finds them first, he will use them 

184
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
to freeze the sun. ALL: Oh! 

185
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,160
Nothing will grow, not even grass. SNORING 

186
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,040
Ugh! OK, people, we've got a problem. 

187
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,400
One of the diamonds is hidden here on the roundabout. 

188
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,360
I must stay behind to guard it. To find the other two, 

189
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,560
you will need this map. 

190
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,680
You must head north into the mountains. There is no time to waste. 

191
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,080
- Whoa! 
- Well, I hope you've supplied us 

192
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,440
with an appropriate mode of transportation. 

193
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,200
- 'Whoops!' 
- Back up. 
- It's hardly the Orient Express, darling. 

194
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,280
- Does it have first class? 
- 'What?!' 

195
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,000
Take good care of this little box of tricks. 

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,520
It may save you in your hour of need. 

197
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Florence, hold on. I'll be back. 

198
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,440
- I promise. 
- Don't be too long. 

199
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,400
Whatever happens, you mustn't blame yourself. 

200
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,760
- No, leave that to us. 
- All aboard! 

201
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,880
Don't worry, children, our friends will save us. 

202
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,800
- TRAIN 
- 'Steam check, furnace check, pistons check! Whey-hey! 

203
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,040
'Sorry. Passengers. I forgot the passengers. 

204
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,080
'Hello, trees. 

205
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,880
'Hello, birds. Hello, scary freezing mist. 

206
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,560
'Oh, dear. Lucky they can't hear me. 

207
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,120
'Wouldn't want them thinking I'm a scaredy train or anything.' 

208
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,920
Oh, Florence... 

209
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,400
'I wonder where we're going. I wonder if they know. 

210
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,200
'I wonder if they know I don't know. What a ridiculous train of thought!' 

211
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
- Dougal. 
- Yeah? 

212
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,760
- You mustn't feel guilty just because it's all your fault. 
- Me?! 

213
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,200
Sorry, didn't come out right. 

214
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,880
My fault. What did I do?! 

215
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,520
What, apart from wrecking the roundabout, 

216
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,480
trapping Florence and the children and causing the escape of a maniac 

217
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,600
- intent on freezing the sun? 
- I only wanted to eat some sweeties. 

218
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,040
Yeah, it starts with some sweets, man, and maybe an iced bun 

219
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,760
and before you know it you're on two bags a day. 

220
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,960
I know, man, I've been there. 

221
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,760
- Maybe you've got, like, a problem, my furry friend. 
- I have not! 

222
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,640
I'll not rest until I've done everything in my power 

223
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,640
to bake things right! I mean, make things right. 

224
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,000
Goodness it's getting cold. 

225
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,640
'Tell me about it. I'm freezing me nuts and bolts off here.' 

226
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,960
I must say, you're all doing a wonderful job. 

227
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,040
Keep up the good work! 

228
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,320
What's for dinner, anyway? I'm famished. 

229
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,600
Oh, I see. The silent treatment, is it? 

230
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,640
Huh! 

231
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,760
It's lucky I brought some secret supplies. Mm. 

232
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,080
Ah, full moon. 

233
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,320
They say the full moon puts people in the mood for romance. 

234
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Oh... 

235
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,960
What a perfect venue for an open-air Verdi festival! 

236
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,640
People would flock here. # La-la-la-la-la-la-la. # 

237
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,720
Not even sheep would flock to that noise. 

238
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,200
# La-la-la-lee-la-la-loo 

239
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,800
# Ahhhh... # 

240
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,360
Uh-oh. 

241
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
That was a close shave. 

242
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,480
Me gobstoppers! Oh, no! There's only one left! 

243
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,160
It's time we all got some beauty sleep. 

244
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,480
Dylan. 

245
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,840
- Dylan! 
- What? What? 
- Bed time! 

246
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,720
Jeez, thanks for waking me up to let me know. 

247
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,040
- Someone should keep watch. I was thinking... 
- Good of you to offer. 

248
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,720
- What? 
- Good night. 
- Good night, darlings. 

249
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,920
- Night-night, Ermindude. 
- Eh? What? 

250
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,280
- 'Now for my impression of a sleeper train.' 
- Wait! Wait! 

251
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,520
Oh! 

252
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,120
'Oh, no, I've run out of toothpaste.' 

253
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,440
Why do I have to be the guard dog? 

254
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,040
What's wrong with a guard snail or a guard cow or...? 

255
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,800
- GRUNTING 
- Who goes there? Friend or foe or... 

256
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
moose? F-feeling a bit blue? 

257
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,960
You're not the only one. 

258
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,520
Ooh! Is this a friend of yours? 

259
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,800
MENACING LAUGHTER 

260
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,040
I'll take that as a no. 

261
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,680
- Doogie! 
- Dougal! 

262
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,280
Dou...gal! 

263
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,440
- Doogie, man! Here, Dougal. 
- Here, Dougal. 

264
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,840
Ooh. I've found a trail. Maybe it'll lead us to him. 

265
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,280
Or maybe it'll lead us to that... 

266
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,240
moose. 

267
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,520
I think he's trying to tell us something. 

268
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,040
Have you seen our friend Dougal? Big black nose, 

269
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,920
- looks like a bad hair day on legs. 
- MOOSE GRUNTS 

270
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,160
You're wasting your time, Brian. Whoever heard of a talking moose? 

271
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,800
'Says the opera-singing cow.' 

272
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,240
GRUNTS 

273
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,400
I think he wants us to follow him. 

274
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,360
HE BELLOWS 

275
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,160
Come on, as fast as you can. 

276
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,760
SOLDIER HUMS 

277
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,720
Now, you dim-witted draught-excluder, 

278
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,680
- tell me everything. 
- Well, I was a very happy puppy. 

279
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,240
My first memories are of catching tennis balls with Florence. 

280
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,400
- As I grew up... 
- No, you follicly-enhanced freak, 

281
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,880
tell me about the diamonds 

282
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,880
or I'll make you wish you'd packed a pooper-scooper. 

283
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,840
Me? I don't know anything. I don't even have the map. 

284
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,440
So...there's a map, eh? 

285
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,600
No, no, no! No map. 

286
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,080
Of course they wouldn't trust YOU with it! 

287
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,640
You're just a silly little dog. You'd probably bury it. 

288
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,720
Or chew it! 

289
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,560
So, who does have the map? 

290
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,840
- Eh? 
- I'll never tell. 

291
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,520
Oh, no? Sam, stop mincing around with that duster! 

292
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,760
Torture this boarding house for fleas until he tells us everything. 

293
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,240
Yes, sir. Right, then, torture! 

294
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
Look, this is all a bit new to me 

295
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,800
so, erm, what is it you're most afraid of? 

296
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,360
Erm... Hm. 

297
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,520
Ooh, it won't be long now until I have my full powers back. 

298
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,720
- Then I... 
- Oh, no! No! No! 

299
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,360
Ah. Good, Sam. 

300
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,800
- Enjoy yourself. 
- Please, no more! 

301
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,200
- 26. 
- Oh! I can't stand it! 

302
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,960
27? You can't possibly take much more of this. 

303
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,440
- You've eaten 27 sugar cubes! 
- You'll have to make me eat 100 

304
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,600
before I tell you anything! 

305
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,200
- HE LAUGHS 
- Soon the diamonds will be mine 

306
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,360
and I'll be able to turn this hideous green planet 

307
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,360
- into a lovely frozen wasteland. 
- This is terrible! 

308
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,040
HE LAUGHS 

309
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,640
- No, you mustn't! 
- A little more. 

310
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,960
- Ooh, don't, ya... 
- I was just going to take... 

311
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,120
- THUD! 
- Eh? 

312
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,200
Ooh! Ow! You're killing me! 

313
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,680
EVIL LAUGH 

314
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,080
Ooh. 

315
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,320
- Agh! 
- Ooh, that sounded painful. 

316
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,680
Excellent work, Sam. 

317
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,000
No! Leave me alone, you evil fiend! 

318
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,200
What are you talking about? It's me, Ermintrude. 

319
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,880
Could you come back in five minutes? I was starting to enjoy meself. 

320
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
Oh, come on, Dougal! 

321
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,000
Full steam backwards! 

322
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,000
Finish him off, Sam. It's time we... 

323
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,360
The dog! What have you done with him, you idiot? 

324
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,240
Oh-h. Well, sir, I got flattened by a flying cow. Oh! 

325
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,800
What? 

326
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,840
- Not so fast. 
- Ooh! Let go of my tail, you brute! 

327
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,720
- Ermintrude! 
- Oh, no. 
- Pull faster! 

328
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,800
Help! 

329
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,280
- Agh! 
- Owwww! 

330
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,800
- Back it up, back it up. 
- How nice of you to drop in. 

331
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,000
Pull! 

332
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,800
Sorry, can't stay long. 

333
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,680
- Agh! 
- 'Uh-oh, whiplash.' 

334
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,120
Hello. Ah, she looks a lot better from this angle. 

335
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,800
She'll look a lot better when she's being served 

336
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,160
with a side order of fries. 

337
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,200
After them! 

338
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,800
It's cold and very unpleasant. Where are we? 

339
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,480
Keep going. Keep going. 

340
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,880
- There must be another way. 
- Yeah, man. Yeah, yeah. 

341
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,240
Keep going, people. Whoa! Ooh. 

342
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,520
- ALL SCREAM 
- 'I'm a train, not a snowboard!' 

343
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,360
- # Ba-ba-ba-bom 
- # We're spinning, spinning around 

344
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,360
- # Ba-ba-ba-bom 
- # We're spinning, spinning around 

345
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,640
- # Ba-ba-ba-bom 
- # We're spinning, spinning around 

346
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,160
- # Ba-ba-ba-bom 
- # We're spinning, spinning around 

347
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,560
# Ohh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 

348
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,400
# Bom-ba-ba-bom-bom-bom. # 

349
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,280
'I was made to shunt, not to ski!' 

350
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,280
Oh, man, that's...deep. 

351
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,960
Oh! I think we've reached the end of the line. 

352
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,400
You took the words right out of my mouth. 

353
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,400
- Sam, your sword. 
- Sir. On guard! 

354
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,320
Hey, man, give peace a chance. 

355
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,800
Nobody can save you now. 

356
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,960
HE LAUGHS MENACINGLY 

357
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,280
ALL: Zebedee! Zebedee! Zebedee! 

358
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,240
- You! 
- So, we meet again. 

359
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,880
Indeed. I've waited 10,000 years for my revenge 

360
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,600
and, as you know, revenge is a dish best served cold. 

361
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,320
Some like it hot, Zeebad. 

362
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,560
I've still got some spring in my step, Zeebad. 

363
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,880
- ALL GASP 
- Well done, Zebedee. 
- Oh, no. 

364
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,440
- TRAIN: 
- Y'know, I think this spring is sprung. 

365
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,520
Oi! Where do you think you lot are going? 

366
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,800
Sam? 

367
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,600
Sam, stop! Think about what you're doing! 

368
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,480
It's not my job to think. I'm a soldier. I'm just following orders. 

369
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,960
You may wear a soldier's uniform, Sam, 

370
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,800
- but it's what's inside that counts. 
- Zebedee, look out! 

371
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,880
- Agh! 
- Blimey. 

372
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,440
Run! Run! 

373
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,880
Come on, gang, here's our chance. 

374
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,640
Ohh! 

375
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,080
- Agh! 
- 'Move that moustache! Oops. Nearly a toothpick.' 

376
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,040
Your days in the sun are over, Zebedee, 

377
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,720
you benevolent bedspring. 

378
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,640
Now it's time for Zeebad. 

379
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,800
- Stop! Zebedee's in trouble! 
- No! Save yourselves! 

380
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,280
- What shall we do? What shall we do? 
- Well, we can't leave him. 

381
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,320
To the rescue! 

382
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,880
You've got to find the diamonds! 

383
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,800
Ah, so it ends, 

384
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,240
my nemesis finally vanquished forever. 

385
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,480
Get the diamonds...! 

386
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,680
No-o-o-o! 

387
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,440
We have no choice. We must leave now. 

388
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,840
There's nothing more we can do here. 

389
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,600
- Come on, Doog. 
- Quick. 

390
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,440
It's almost enough to make one weep. 

391
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,440
- If only I wasn't so very, very happy! 
- HE LAUGHS 

392
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,280
Now nothing can stand in my way. 

393
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,120
HE LAUGHS MANIACALLY 

394
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,560
Oh. 

395
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! 

396
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,280
No, Sam, it's all in the back of the throat. 

397
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,440
'Right now even if I could speak, I wouldn't know what to say.' 

398
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,480
- I can't believe he's really gone. 
- Zeb's dead, baby. Zeb's dead. 

399
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,960
And now who's going to help Florence and the children? 

400
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,440
- Who's going to help us? 
- Be strong, Ermintrude. 

401
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,360
We have to be brave and find the diamonds. 

402
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,880
After all, that was Zebedee's dying wish. 

403
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,600
It's no good, man. Without Zebedee, we're nothing. 

404
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,280
SHE SIGHS 

405
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,440
No. Brian's right. We're going to save our world. 

406
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,680
Now, where's the map? 

407
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,560
- There. Head for the tallest mountain in that range. 
- That's the spirit! 

408
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,920
Nothing but a sea of boiling lava will keep me from that diamond now. 

409
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,880
Oh, sugar. 

410
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,080
Well, that's where the diamond is. Who's going to get it? 

411
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,920
Er, well, diamonds are a girl's best friend. 

412
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,880
- Off you trot, Ermintrude. 
- Men are supposed to give ladies diamonds. 

413
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,160
I thought dogs were supposed to fetch. 

414
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,560
My forte has always been, "Sit, Dougal." 

415
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,600
That and, "Stay, Dougal, stay." 

416
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,800
Dylan, surely it's only a short hop for such a brave bunny. 

417
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,640
Or a long drop for a dumb rabbit. 

418
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,720
Quiet! 

419
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,640
Ahem. There's a bridge over there. 

420
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,800
I think I ought to keep a look out here 

421
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,800
- while you lot cross to the other side. 
- 'He's no dog, he's a chicken!' 

422
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,880
All right, all right, I understand. 

423
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,200
You don't want to go without your leader. 

424
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,800
- 'Talk about wag your own tail.' 
- Ooh, I'm scared of heights! 

425
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,080
'Don't worry about the heights, worry about the widths. 

426
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,480
- 'This is going to be easy.' Careful! 
- Easy does it. 

427
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,840
- We were close to the edge there! 
- 'Just don't look down.' 

428
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,200
'Look straight ahead.' 

429
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,960
- Whoa. Hot rocks, man. 
- Keep your eyes on the road! 

430
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,880
- What road, man? 
- 'I'm on it. Don't worry.' 

431
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,240
What's happened? Why have we stopped? 

432
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,880
'One step at a time.' 

433
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,320
- 'Oh!' 
- Gently does it. 

434
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,440
'There we go. This is going to be easy. 

435
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,360
- 'Agh!' 
- BOTH: No-o-o! 

436
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,200
TYRES SCREECH Agh. 

437
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,120
- ALL SCREAM 
- Dylan, do something! 

438
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,760
'Can't one of you hop out and push? 

439
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,520
- Whoa, I'm totally not train trained! 
- 'That's not helping!' 

440
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,440
Dylan! 

441
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,080
ALL: Oh! 

442
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,400
'Ah, for a nice shiny can of warm oil. 

443
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,560
'No need to panic. 

444
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,320
'Now. Now is a good time to panic. Move it!' 

445
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,080
Rock and roll, man. 

446
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,600
- Brilliant. 
- 'That's it, I've had it with public transport.' 

447
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,000
- ERMINTRUDE GASPS 
- The diamond! 
- Wow! 

448
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,800
And there you have it. I have led you all to the first diamond. 

449
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,280
- Wow! 
- Dylan, do the honours, would ya? 

450
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,840
Yeah. Cool. 

451
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,480
WHISTLING Er, I think this thing needs tuning. 

452
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,280
Something's happening. 

453
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,840
- My feet are frozen. 
- I'm cold. 

454
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,440
Come on, children, we have to be brave. 

455
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,680
Look, it's Florence. 

456
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,400
Strange, for a second there I-I thought I heard... 

457
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,320
- HE SIGHS 
- I must be going mad. 

458
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,560
She can hear me. Florence! It's me, Dougal! I've come to save you! 

459
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,160
Dougal, is that you? 

460
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,080
- Oh, no, she's fading. 
- Dougal? Dougal! 

461
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,400
It's only been one day and the children are freezing fast. 

462
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,200
DOUGAL SNIFFS 

463
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,080
- Concerned for your friends? Ha-ha! 
- ALL GASP 

464
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,360
- And I'll take the map, too, please. 
- Wait. 

465
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,120
- How do you know there's a... 
- ZEEBAD LAUGHS 

466
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,840
Well, they tortured it out of me. 

467
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,400
Give me that map. 

468
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,600
- Please? 
- Over my dead body! 

469
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,400
Sam, get out the garlic butter. 

470
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,440
- I'm feeling a little peckish. 
- You're bluffing. 

471
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,600
Try me, you spineless slime-spreader. 

472
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,080
Leave him alone! 

473
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,120
Take the map! 

474
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,440
You're a despicable fiend. 

475
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,160
I know. It's a gift, really. 

476
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,520
Compassion is such a weakness. 

477
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,960
Sorry we can't stay but you know how it is. 

478
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,520
People to rule, places to freeze. 

479
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,760
Come on, imbecile, we have to destroy the bridge! 

480
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,440
So long, suckers! 

481
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,680
Uh! Uh! Uh! 

482
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,080
Uh! Uh! Uh! 

483
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,840
Uh! Hold up. 

484
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,760
Agh-gh-gh! 

485
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,000
HE LAUGHS 

486
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,120
- Ooh! 
- Good work, soldier. 

487
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,720
- There's hope for you yet. 
- Thank you, sir. 

488
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,360
Man, they don't make crumbling rock causeways like they used to. 

489
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,960
Is there any chance it will, like, grow back? 

490
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,120
At least we'll be nice and warm. 

491
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,240
Oh, tragedy! We're doomed! 

492
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,800
- And just as I was about to make it big. 
- You are big. 

493
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,200
Thank you, Dougal, but I was hoping that the peak of a volcano 

494
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,320
- wouldn't be the pinnacle of my career. 
- Chill out, guys. 

495
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,120
I've got something stashed that just might help. 

496
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,920
We don't have time to experiment with recreational activities! 

497
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,200
- Zebedee's magic box! 
- Of course! 

498
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,480
Now, if I could just get my head round how to work this thing... 

499
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,360
Did Zebedee give anyone instructions? ALL: Just press the button! 

500
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,040
A boat! Brilliant! It'll be plain sailing from here on in. 

501
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,880
Wait. I've got it. 

502
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,040
The tents. 

503
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,360
He's really lost it this time. 

504
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,120
This heat is making my horns curl. I must look a sight. 

505
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,240
Oh, no, Ermintrude, I think you look... 

506
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,800
That is, I find you... 

507
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,560
Look, in case we don't make it out of here, 

508
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
I just want you to know that... 

509
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,560
All aboard! ALL GASP 

510
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,720
'This is amazing! I've never been this high before!' 

511
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,400
'I've never been off the ground before. What are we doing?' 

512
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,440
BOAT WHISTLES 

513
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,920
Well done, Dylan! A balloon escape! 

514
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,600
- My, you are clever. 
- It's all about altitude over attitude, Ermindude. 

515
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,040
Excuse me, but there's still one small problem. 

516
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,080
We have no idea where we're going. 

517
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,040
Brian's right. We could drift around for years! 

518
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,360
Or we could just, like, follow them. 

519
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,240
Faster, Sam! You row like a milkmaid! 

520
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,640
Ease up, sir. Now those pesky thieves are out the way, 

521
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,880
- what's the big rush? 
- Sam imagine if you'd waited 10,000 years 

522
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,600
to come home to your frozen kingdom only to find 

523
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,360
a world covered in flowers and animals and sunshine and... 

524
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,920
And trees and rainbows and tiny little bunny rabbits. 

525
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,280
Shut up and row, you wooden windbag! 

526
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,320
Soon I will have the second diamond 

527
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,800
and all those stranded simpletons will have is each other, 

528
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,520
for dinner! Ha-ha-ha-ha! 

529
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,560
SAM LAUGHS AWKWARDLY 

530
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,320
- Sam, you're ruining the moment. 
- Sorry, sir. 

531
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,800
Is that the Milky Way, Ermintrude? 

532
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,720
Brian! You should never ask a lady anything so personal. 

533
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,680
Huh? 

534
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,640
Aren't the stars beautiful? 

535
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,960
So beautiful. 

536
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,880
Wouldn't you love to be one of them? 

537
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,120
I'd give anything. 

538
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,000
You'd make a wonderful star. 

539
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,440
Oh! I dare say you're right. 

540
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,600
So serene. 

541
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,640
So heavenly. 

542
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,840
So admired 

543
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,720
and adored. 

544
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,120
Always looking down on everyone. 

545
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,920
Ohhh, yes! 

546
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,200
HE YAWNS We should get some sleep, man. 

547
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,880
Honestly. Is that all you ever think about? 

548
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,080
Sure, whenever I'm awake. 

549
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,040
I can't sleep. I'm too worried about my Florence. 

550
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,920
She's so helpless without me. She must be petrified. 

551
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,520
Pets fried? 

552
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,440
Bad karma. 

553
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,080
Exactly. I calm her down. 

554
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,560
The truth is, I do everything for her. 

555
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,040
Her life'd be quite empty without me there. 

556
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,680
Whoa. Don't toast the hamsters, dude. 

557
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,000
During scary thunder storms, she insists I climb into bed with her, 

558
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
for her protection. 

559
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,360
And she just loves to throw a tennis ball. 

560
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,520
Who's always there to bring it back 

561
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,360
so she can have the pleasure of throwing it again? 

562
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,040
I'm telling you, Dylan, I bet she really misses that. 

563
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,240
Really, really, 

564
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,480
really missing that. 

565
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,160
Florence? 

566
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,880
Florence!

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,240
Hey, man, tropical vibes! 

590
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,720
But, look, there's ice up ahead. 

591
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,120
- Where? 
- Something strange is definitely afoot. 

592
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,720
Yeah, it's definitely a foot. 

593
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,440
OK, everybody, prepare to land! 

594
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,040
Can't be far now. 

595
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,720
This is definitely the place. Let's press on. Sam. 

596
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,760
Ow! 

597
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,080
Hold up, sir. 

598
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,760
After me, sir. It could be dangerous 

599
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,160
and I've got a sixth sense. Oh... 

600
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,640
Try concentrating on the other five and you might not lose your head. 

601
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,600
Now what do we have here? 

602
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,480
Ah-ha! The whole place is booby-trapped. 

603
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,800
So, what do we do now, boss? 

604
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,400
'Tempo!' 

605
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,080
Hmm. 

606
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,760
Thank goodness. I can't wait to feel the earth against my hooves. 

607
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,200
Any idea how we can land this thing? 

608
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,520
- They're still alive. 
- Well, boil me busby. 

609
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,200
No matter. All that booby traps require are a bunch of boobies. 

610
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,080
We let them clear the way, then we can just stroll in. 

611
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,200
Come on! 

612
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,000
Lower. Lower. 

613
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,840
Loads of room. Lower. 

614
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,600
- 'Here comes...' 
- Stop! 

615
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,760
'...a smooth...crash.' 

616
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,640
- Huh. 
- Ow! 
- Just in time for lunch! 

617
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,080
And it looks like you're on the menu. 

618
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,240
- I wonder where Zeebad is. 
- We must have overtaken him. 

619
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,480
- Nice one, train. 
- 'No worries, rabbit.' 

620
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,760
Wait here and keep your pistons pumping. 

621
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,560
- We may need to make a quick getaway. 
- 'Let's make it quick and go now.' 

622
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,480
ZEEBAD LAUGHS 

623
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,360
I wonder what these symbols mean. 

624
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,760
- It's probably the ancient equivalent of a welcome mat. 
- Ooh! 

625
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,120
Ooh. Where are my manners? 

626
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,960
- Ladies first. 
- No, after you. 

627
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,240
- Age before beauty, dear. 
- Oh, for heaven's sake, I'll go. 

628
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,920
Don't look so shell-shocked, Ermintrude. 

629
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,080
I may be slow but I can still take the lead. Just follow my trail. 

630
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,840
- Look who's beginning to grow a spine. 
- Spine? What do you mean? 

631
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,120
I'm always the first into the fray. Those lazy tykes. 

632
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,840
I'm the only one who does anything around here. "Do this, do that." 

633
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,400
"Yes, sir, no, sir." They treat me like a slave. 

634
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,680
It's a disgrace. "Make my sugar, rake my grass." 

635
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,000
They must think I'm a soft touch. But I always crawl back. 

636
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,840
Well, come on, it's all clear. 

637
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,960
ALL GASP 

638
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,040
Let's go. 

639
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,600
I never thought I'd say this, but what a snail! 

640
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,520
'OK, wait here. That's what they said.' 

641
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,440
'Wait... Wah! Oh, I don't like this. I don't like this. 

642
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,800
'What's this? I'll go in the tunnel. I'm a train, I like tunnels. 

643
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,440
'I'll wait here. That's it. Yeah. I'll wait just...' 

644
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,840
Ooh! 

645
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,360
- Ooh. 
- Oh! 

646
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,480
HEY! Anyone find the diamonds? 

647
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,600
Dude, man, don't you know rabbits are kinda jumpy? 

648
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,360
I don't see any clues. 

649
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,760
We must be in the wrong place. Ooh, a throne. 

650
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,000
The perfect place to enjoy my last gobstopper. 

651
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,800
Ooh, great, a recline button! 

652
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,480
Huh? Ooh! Ooooh! 

653
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,040
Ooh! Ooh! Oooooooh! 

654
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,440
Ooh. Huh? 

655
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,160
The diamond! 

656
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,200
Cool light show, man. Hello, pretty lasers. 

657
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,200
No! They're alarm beams! 

658
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,120
Someone has to get through to the diamond. 

659
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,000
- Well, I'm too hairy. 
- I've got the shakes. 

660
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,280
For the love of Mozart, I'll do it! 

661
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,680
I trained as a ballerina, you know? My Swan Lake was the talk of... 

662
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,800
Stop milking the moment and get me out of here! 

663
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,240
MUSIC: "In The Hall Of The Mountain King" by Grieg

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,640
Agh!

00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,960

THUD!

00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,600
Well done! That was brill... 

669
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,840
ALL: No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! 

670
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,320
Oops. 

671
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,120
HE WHIMPERS 

672
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,840
SKELETON SNARLS 

673
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,960
I don't suppose anyone knows anything about martial arts. 

674
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,240
Just the basics of, like, kung fu, karate, 

675
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,600
judo, kendo, tae kwon do, anything-you-can-do 

676
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,400
- and t'ai chi. 
- Ooh, do they come with egg-fried rice? 

677
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,480
- Dylan, can you beat them up? 
- Sorry, I don't believe in violence. 

678
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,960
Except in self-defence. 

679
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,680
Er... Ooh. 

680
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,560
Oh, man. That's what I call pulling yourself together. 

681
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,360
Ya! Ya! 

682
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,840
Whee-ee! 

683
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,040
Whoa! 

684
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,480
Come on, man. 

685
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,160
Dylan! 

686
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,040
I'm not just another pretty face. 

687
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,640
Hi-ya! Whoo-hoo-ha! 

688
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,680
Good group effort. Now, let's grab the diamond and head off. 

689
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,280
- 'I'm a train. I have a whistle.' 
- WHISTLE BLOWS WEAKLY 

690
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,880
'It's dark down here. Lucky I have tunnel vision.' 

691
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,440
'Whoa! 

692
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,680
'Big engine. 

693
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,160
'Alloy wheels! 

694
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,320
'You wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of that.' 

695
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,240
Oh. SKELETON SNARLS 

696
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,800
Uh-oh. 

697
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,320
The fearless warrior of legend 

698
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,520
has come to claim the diamond. 

699
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,640
Erm, no, actually. 

700
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,240
The fearless warrior couldn't make it today so we came instead. 

701
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,520
We'll drop it in to him on the way home. 

702
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,000
Look, do you want the diamond or don't you? 

703
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,920
Er, well, if you're offering, yes, please. 

704
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,640
I've got a better idea. Let's jump him. 

705
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,320
Chaaaaaa... 

706
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,200
..aaaaaaaaaa... 

707
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,080
..aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarge! 

708
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,960
SKELETON LAUGHS 

709
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,440
It was just a thought. 

710
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,040
How about..."Run away!"? 

711
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,560
Oh, no! 

712
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,000
Agh-ha-ha! 

713
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,480
Agh-ha-haaaa! Dogs are meant to eat bones, 

714
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,840
not the other way around! 

715
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,920
Er, er... 

716
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,520
Aghhhhhh! 

717
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,240
- THUD! 
- Quick thinking, Dougal! 

718
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,360
If you keep your cool and don't run around like a headless chicken... 

719
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,240
No time for chitchat. Let's grab that diamond and get out. 

720
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,480
ALL GASP 

721
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,480
It's gone! HE LAUGHS 

722
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,360
Fools. Looking for this? 

723
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,600
You just can't get the staff these days. 

724
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,960
Now, do you want to tell me where the third diamond is? 

725
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,480
Nope. 

726
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,840
Resistance is futile! 

727
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,520
You're no match for the great Zeebad. 

728
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,240
Pride comes before a fall. Dougal, now! 

729
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,240
Hurray! That's the last we'll see of them! 

730
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,440
- BOTH: Oooh! 
- Bleurgh! 
- BOTH: Aghhhhh! 

731
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,560
- BOTH: Oooh! Ouch! 
- That took 'em down a peg or ten. 

732
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,200
Yeah, man, 'cept you just flushed away diamonds one and two. 

733
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,520
So, where do we go now? 

734
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,560
We must get back to the roundabout as fast as we can. 

735
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,080
I know there's, like, no rest for the wicked, 

736
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,600
but I'm one of the good guys and right now I need a siesta. 

737
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,120
RUMBLING Whoa! 

738
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,160
- Look! 
- 'Voices! I knew they'd come to rescue me. 

739
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,160
'Hang on. Maybe I'm supposed to be rescuing them.' 

740
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:45,280
TRAIN WHISTLES Hey, that sounds familiar. 

741
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,360
Typical train. Always turns up when you least expect it. 

742
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,160
Come on, gang. In we go. 

743
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,760
- 'Right, now, let's get out of here.' 
- Oh, do slow down. 

744
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,560
- You're making my milk churn. 
- Are you kidding? 

745
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,240
- We're moving at a snail's pace. 
- A snail's pace suits me just fine. 

746
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,960
Ooh, Ermintrude, that's the sweetest thing you've ever said. 

747
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,520
Relax, Doogie. Soon this whole crazy trip will be behind us. 

748
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,320
- SKELETON SNARLS 
- Behind us! 

749
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,160
That's what I said. 

750
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,280
No, behind us! 

751
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,960
Faster! Faster! 

752
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,720
'Duck!' 

753
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,360
'I always wanted to be a roller coaster! Waaaah!' 

754
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,400
Whoa, dudes, talk about a near-death experience. 

755
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,000
I thought I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. 

756
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,520
That is the light at the end of the tunnel. We're going to be OK. 

757
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,280
And Zeebad's still trapped in the temple. 

758
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,280
Then, like, who's that, his evil twin, Zeebadder? 

759
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,840
Where's my third diamond?! 

760
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:09,040
- Agh! 
- 'Wahhh! Furnace, don't fail me now!' 

761
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,240
'Waaaahhhh!' 

762
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,920
ALL SCREAM 

763
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,280
'Brace yourself, everybody!' 

764
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,720
'Wahhh! Mind the gap!' 

765
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,040
'Hey!' 

766
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,000
'Here comes big nose. Agh!' 

767
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,680
Somebody do something! 

768
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,440
Hey, this must be some kind of anti-spring device. 

769
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,560
- This'll slow Zeebad down. 
- Really? Agh! 
- Or it could be an ejector seat. 

770
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,800
Aghhhhhh! 

771
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,200
- THUD! 
- What the devil was that? 

772
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,240
What happened? Why am I blind? Did we reach the roundabout yet? 

773
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,000
So that's where you're heading. 

774
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,120
The roundabout! And that's where I'll find my diamond. Ha-ha-ha! 

775
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,760
So long, slimeball. 

776
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,160
Agh! Ooooohhhh! 

777
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,480
Sam, get up on the roof and dispose of the prisoner. 

778
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,440
Dispose of a prisoner? I can't do that, sir. Geneva Convention. 

779
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,080
Guess what - I'm unconventional! 

780
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,800
HE LAUGHS 

781
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,640
Un-convention-al! Off with his head. 

782
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,920
Aghhhhhh! Help! 

783
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,760
Agggghhhhhhhh! 

784
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,360
Agh! Aghhhhh! 

785
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,920
- Ouch! 
- Whoa! 

786
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,400
- 'Welcome aboard!' 
- Ermintrude, you saved me! 

787
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,800
Don't cross me, you tarted-up tin-opener! 

788
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Faster, you lily-livered traitor! I want that diamond! 

789
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,240
More coal! 

790
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,840
Agh! Whoa! Trouble dead ahead! 

791
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,080
'That's my line!' 

792
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,600
HE GROWLS 

793
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,800
Now, this is what happens when you don't brush regularly! 

794
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,560
Agh! 

795
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,400
Sir! The pressure! It's too much! 

796
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,520
I know, I know! 

797
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,520
Sometimes I feel I'm going quite insane! 

798
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,120
No, it's the boiler! It... 

799
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,680
Thank goodness! We're safe! 

800
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,880
- 'That's what I call letting off steam!' 
- Hoorah! 

801
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,040
'I can fl....yyyyyyy!' 

802
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,800
'No, I can't.' 

803
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,400
ALL: Aghhhhhhh! 

804
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,400
Oh, that's enough flying for one day. 

805
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,040
We've got to get to the roundabout before Zeebad. 

806
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,760
Hang on, Zeebad doesn't know the diamond's at the roundabout. 

807
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,400
Erm, that's not strictly true. 

808
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,560
Back there on the train, I was confused 

809
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,600
- and it just slipped out. 
- Brian, man! 

810
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,880
- Well, there's no use crying over spilt milk. 
- Easy for you to say. 

811
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,720
Come on, people, to the train! 

812
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,400
'Ow.' 

813
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,680
Whoa. Looks like this service has been cancelled. 

814
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,120
- Are you all right? 
- 'Yeah. Delays look likely. 

815
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,280
'I think I've pulled a piston. Ow! Nope, it's not going to happen.' 

816
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,520
- Oh, poor trainy. 
- Oh, the sun's setting. 

817
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,360
We'll just have to make it under our own steam. 

818
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,680
Goodbye for now, old buddy. 

819
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,360
You can make it. Just follow our tracks. 

820
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,400
'Don't worry about me. You go on. Find the diamond...' 

821
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,000
'One second thoughts... What about me?!' 

822
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,680
GROANS 

823
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,720
Wretched machines! I must reach the roundabout before... 

824
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Ooh! 

825
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,920
Sir, medic needed... SOS. 

826
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,040
Mayday. 

827
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,240
Me help you? 

828
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,320
You treacherous mollusc-sparing disco dolly! 

829
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,720
Your tour of duty is over. 

830
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,320
You can't leave an injured soldier, sir. 

831
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,200
Can't I? Just watch me. 

832
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,240
- HE LAUGHS 
- Wait. Come back! 

833
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,720
Evil villains can be so cruel. 

834
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,480
Oh! I can't go on. 

835
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,880
We've been walking for hours! 

836
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,480
So c-c-c-cold... 

837
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,440
I can't feel my limb. 

838
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,960
Poor Florence and the children. 

839
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,320
If we don't get there soon, they'll be frozen stiff. 

840
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,040
Oh, the cruel hands of time. 

841
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,960
But if it wasn't for time, 

842
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,720
ever-everything would, like, happen at once. 

843
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,600
Wait. What's that? 

844
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,200
Footprints! Maybe they'll lead us back to the village. 

845
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,120
But, like, what kind of freaky creatures 

846
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,240
would leave prints like these? 

847
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,480
They must be exhausted, too. 

848
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,600
One of them seems to be crawling along the ground. 

849
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,360
I prefer the term gliding. 

850
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,680
Oh, no, they're ours! 

851
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,880
Oh, no. No! 

852
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,600
Well, that's it, then. 

853
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,600
It's time for the big sleep. 

854
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,600
We did our best 

855
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,960
- but our best wasn't good enough. 
- ALL SHIVER 

856
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,360
Oh, it's the final curtain. 

857
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,760
Agh! 

858
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,200
No. We mustn't sleep. 

859
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,880
It's too cold. It's too cold. 

860
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,240
We mustn't. 

861
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,280
Florence... 

862
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,040
Dougal! 

863
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,160
- Dougal? 
- Florence! You're OK! 

864
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,320
I'm more than OK. 

865
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,240
I'm sweet. 

866
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,200
What about the roundabout? The children huddled, freezing. 

867
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,640
Don't worry, Dougal. You're with me now 

868
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,320
- in sugar paradise! 
- SHE LAUGHS 

869
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,760
Look. 

870
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,920
Sweets for my sweet Dougal. 

871
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,800
And you can eat 

872
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,360
as much as you like! 

873
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,920
No! This isn't right! 

874
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,840
I must be going nuts! I have to wake up! Save Florence! 

875
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,880
Florence! 

876
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,200
No! It was just a dream. 

877
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,520
Florence...! 

878
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,480
Florence! 

879
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,680
Come on! Wake up! Wake up! 

880
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:05,480
- Wake up! 
- Hey, man, I'm in a higher state of unconsciousness. 

881
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,200
It's getting light and we're still completely lost. 

882
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,080
- I'm not so sure we are. 
- Oh! 

883
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,880
Whoa, that was some serious sleepwalking. 

884
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,080
Look! Look, look, look! 

885
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,600
Quick, come and have a look! Look at that! 

886
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,720
Is that really what I think it is? 

887
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,160
Home! 

888
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,040
Curses! The diamond must be here somewhere! 

889
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,960
- Zeebad! 
- You... 

890
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,880
This roundabout ain't big enough for the both of us! 

891
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,000
When I leave someone for dead, 

892
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,400
I expect them to die! 

893
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,880
Can't you even do that right? 

894
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,080
I haven't done anything right since I left the roundabout. 

895
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,520
Now it's time for me to resume my post. 

896
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,200
You... You were on the roundabout? 

897
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,440
Yeah, I was. Guarding it from the likes of you. 

898
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,640
Ha! Look at the state of you! You couldn't guard a boiled egg! 

899
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,800
Well, I might have taken a battering, 

900
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,560
but it's like Zebedee told me, it's what's inside that counts. 

901
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,160
Cha-a-a-a-a-arge! 

902
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,400
Wahhhhh! Ooh. 

903
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,320
- Ooh! 
- The diamond! 

904
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,800
Ooh, Zebedee! 

905
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,760
You cunning slime. 

906
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,440
And to think, I nearly abandoned it when I left you to die. 

907
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,160
Oh, the irony! 

908
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:52,320
- Now, time for the big chill. 
- HE LAUGHS 

909
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,040
This can't be our village. I don't recognise a thing! 

910
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:08,440
- Like, maybe we took a wrong turn, dude. 
- No, no, this is definitely it. 

911
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,480
If we go past this white thingy and by this white bit... 

912
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,320
just round the corner should be the, er... 

913
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,640
Oh, no. 

914
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,960
ZEEBAD LAUGHS 

915
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,400
Zeebad! 

916
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,360
Ah, perfect! 

917
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,760
You've arrived just in time for the finale! 

918
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,480
So long, sunshine! 

919
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,600
- Ah! 
- Florence! 

920
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,000
Oh, Florence! 

921
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,920
Oh, no! No! No! 

922
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,080
No, no. This is all my fault. 

923
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:31,480
If only I hadn't been so greedy and stupid. Oh. 

924
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,880
Farewell, then, Dylan. 

925
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,880
Goodbye, dear Brian. 

926
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,080
Er, Ermintrude, 

927
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:43,280
before we freeze, there's something I've been tr-trying to tell you. 

928
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,560
Erm... MENACING LAUGH 

929
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,240
This guy...is seriously... 

930
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,160
messing...with my...karma! 

931
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,400
Eat this, you jumped-up jack-in-the-box! Agh! 

932
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,400
Oh! You just don't know when you're beaten, do you? 

933
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,320
- Take a chill pill, rabbit! 
- Whoa! 

934
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,520
Aghhhh! 

935
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,960
Wait a minute! That's it! 

936
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,120
Ermintrude! Sing! Sing as loud as you can! 

937
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,160
Oh! Oh! 

938
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,200
I'm not used to working under these conditions. 

939
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,520
Dougal might be onto something. 

940
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,920
Yes! Ermintrude, sing! 

941
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,960
I haven't even warmed up! 

942
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,720
Ermintrude, sing! 

943
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,720
Fine. # Ah-ah-ah 

944
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:48,160
- # Ah-ah-ah-ah... # 
- What is that abominable noise? 

945
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,560
- VERY HIGH: 
- # Ah-ah-ah-ah... # 

946
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,920
Whoa! 

947
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,240
HE GROWLS 

948
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,960
CRACKS KNUCKLES 

949
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,360
Shell loaded. 

950
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,440
Take this. 

951
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,000
- Run! 
- Whoa! 

952
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,160
Ready? And go! 

953
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,360
Whoa! Whoa-ho! 

954
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,000
HE GROWLS Well done! Ooh! 

955
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,440
Whoa-ho! 

956
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,760
Dylan! It's coming your way! 

957
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,280
Whoa! That was some hit! 

958
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,840
Whoa! Psychedelic! 

959
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,640
# We love to boogie 

960
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,280
# We love to boogie... # 

961
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,120
I got it, man. 

962
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,080
No! 

963
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,520
Whoa! 

964
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:04,040
- Over to me, over to me! 
- No! It's mine! Mine! 

965
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,600
Oh! 

966
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,160
ERMINTRUDE SINGS 

967
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,840
- Two-nil! 
- The game's not over yet! 

968
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,120
Ooh! 

969
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,520
Ooh, nice catch, Zeebad. 

970
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,920
Now let's get the final...diamond. 

971
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,720
Touch it and you're toast. 

972
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,760
You don't scare me. You're just a big, blue bully. 

973
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,800
The tables have turned. All we need to do is put this last diamond on... 

974
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:34,520
- Oops. 
- Here comes a home run. 

975
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,160
Not again! 

976
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,000
Ow! 

977
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,600
Victory! 

978
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,640
HE LAUGHS 

979
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,800
So close and yet so... 

980
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,600
Far out! 

981
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,720
Nice try for a bunch of dumb animals, 

982
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,760
but now it's closing time at the zoo. 

983
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:07,840
- Not with our secret weapon - Zebedee's magic box! 
- Huh. 

984
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,720
Oh! 

985
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,080
It d-doesn't work! 

986
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,600
ZEEBAD LAUGHS 

987
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,640
HE LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY 

988
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,440
Oo-ooh! Zebedee's toys can't help you now. 

989
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,720
'Bounce back from that, slinky!' Whoo-hoo!' 

990
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,760
- Train! I knew you'd make it! 
- 'Bang on schedule.' 
- The diamond! 

991
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,720
I'll get it. I got us into this mess 

992
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,240
and I'll get us out. 

993
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,040
'Go on, Dougal.' 

994
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,520
HE GROWLS 

995
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,240
ALL GASP 

996
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,880
Ooh. Ooh. 

997
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,800
Oh-h! 

998
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,440
No-o-o! 

999
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,960
Wha...? 

1000
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,560
HE GROANS 

1001
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,760
HE LAUGHS 

1002
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,000
Hooray! 

1003
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,640
We did it! We did it! 

1004
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,200
- We did it! 
- TRAIN TOOTS 

1005
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,800
Come on! 

1006
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,800
- 'Well done.' 
- There's nothing like opera for breaking the ice. 

1007
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,280
ALL LAUGH I can see grass, man. 

1008
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,400
Sweet green grass. 

1009
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,760
But where's Florence? 

1010
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,640
Florence? 

1011
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,160
Florence! 

1012
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:13,080
Florence, can you hear me? Please wake up. 

1013
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,880
Please wake up! Don't leave me. 

1014
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,760
- This world means nothing without you. 
- Sorry, old buddy. 

1015
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,040
No, it can't... She can't... 

1016
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,960
Florence! My lovely Florence! 

1017
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,880
Huh? 

1018
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,720
DOUGAL WEEPS 

1019
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,000
She moved! 

1020
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,760
She's alive! 

1021
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,880
Oh, Florence, I thought I'd lost you forever! 

1022
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,280
And I thought I'd lost you, too, Dougal. 

1023
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,480
But you saved my life 

1024
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,760
- and everyone else's. 
- Oh, stop it. 

1025
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,440
It's what any incredibly heroic dog would do. 

1026
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:02,640
Oh. So, you don't want a...little reward? 

1027
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,680
Oh, no. I've learnt my lesson. 

1028
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,480
I'm not having anything more to do with lollipops. Or gobstoppers. 

1029
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,480
Or toffees. 

1030
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,440
But wait. Where's Zebedee? 

1031
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,040
ALL: Zebedee! 

1032
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,280
Bravo, my friends! I always knew you could do it! 

1033
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,640
- But we thought you were dead! 
- Dead?! Nonsense, Dougal! 

1034
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,280
Everyone knows that after winter it's time for spring! 

1035
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,400
Come on, everyone, to the roundabout! 

1036
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,920
ALL GIGGLE 

1037
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,120
ROUNDABOUT MUSIC PLAYS 

1038
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:50,000
- MUSIC SLOWS TO A STOP 
- Oh, no! 

1039
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,960
- How come it's not moving? 
- I-it's, like, stuck, man! 

1040
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,000
- What's wrong with the roundabout? 
- Zebedee? 

1041
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,840
Don't you remember? The roundabout's still missing something. 

1042
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,880
- Or should I say someone? 
- Hm? 

1043
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,400
Sam? 

1044
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,040
But that's Zeebad's henchman. He tortured me. 

1045
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,760
Don't be too hard on him. Sam, too, was a victim 

1046
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,920
of Zeebad's maniacal magic. 

1047
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,840
- Oh! 
- It's time for you to return where you belong, Sam. 

1048
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,040
# Sugar 

1049
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,600
# Oh, honey, honey 

1050
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,400
# You are my candy girl 

1051
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,920
# And you got me wanting you 

1052
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,080
# Honey 

1053
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,680
# Oh, sugar, sugar 

1054
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:09,960
- # You are my candy girl 
- Nice shade of moose! 

1055
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:14,640
- # And you got me wanting you 
- With matching hooves! 

1056
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,560
# I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you... # 

1057
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,000
- Dougal. 
- Huh? 
- Dougal! Dougal! 

1058
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,560
Ooh! 

1059
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,360
- HE LAUGHS 
- Huh? 

1060
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,760
# The birds and the bees are all singing to me 

1061
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,840
# Tell me what you see 

1062
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,520
# The beautiful sky always making us happy 

1063
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,840
# Yeah, it's gonna be 

1064
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,680
# A wonderful trip to wherever it takes us 

1065
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,680
- # Together, you and me 
- Sugar, sugar, sugar! 

1066
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,840
Sugar! 

1067
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,120
# I'm climbing high up in the sky 

1068
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,520
# Can you see? 

1069
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,000
# The sun is shining 

1070
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,120
# These are good times 

1071
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,920
# The magic roundabout 

1072
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:22,000
# All friends together now 

1073
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,880
# Come and take your trip cos it's all right 

1074
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:30,280
# So join in with the fun 

1075
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,440
# The ride has just begun 

1076
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:38,400
# We're never coming down we're spinning round and round 

1077
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,160
# On the magic roundabout 

1078
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:48,680
# The magic roundabout 

1079
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,480
# Off on an adventure we're coming to get ya 

1080
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,480
# Wherever that may be 

1081
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,240
# I won't let anything come here and upset ya 

1082
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,120
# I'm gonna set you free 

1083
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,960
# Whatever happens along the way, it's gonna be fine... # 

1084
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,120
Oh, curses. 

1085
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,680
In prison once more. 

1086
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,720
Ah, well, at least it's cold. 

1087
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,960
Double curses! 

1088
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,880
# The magic roundabout 

1089
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:36,120
# I'm flying high up in the sky 

1090
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,200
# Can't you see? 

1091
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,880
# The sun is shining 

1092
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,600
# These are good times. # 

1093
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,800
Whoo! 

1094
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,600
Oh. Oh, you're still there. 

1095
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,640
Didn't I tell you? 

1096
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,360
Time for bed. HE LAUGHS
