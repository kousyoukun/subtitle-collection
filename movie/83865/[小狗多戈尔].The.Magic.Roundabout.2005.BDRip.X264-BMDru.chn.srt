24.000

2
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:08,075
Argh!

3
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:21,117
Ugh! Aaargh!

4
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:44,325
Aaaaargh!

5
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:46,492
Zeebad!

6
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,408
Only a bad dream.

7
00:01:58,283 --> 00:01:59,908
Everything seems fine.

8
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:03,825
# Magic

9
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:17,283
# Oh, ho, ho, it's magic

10
00:02:18,283 --> 00:02:20,742
# You know

11
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:25,242
# Never believe it's not so

12
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,283
# It's magic

13
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,200
# You know

14
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:36,242
# Never believe it's not so

15
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,325
# Never been awake

16
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,325
# Never seen a day break

17
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:47,283
# Leaning on my pillow in the morning

18
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,742
# Lazy day in bed

19
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:52,325
# Music in my head

20
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:58,158
# Crazy music playing
in the morning light

21
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,700
# Oh, ho, ho, it's magic

22
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,158
# You know

23
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:10,158
# Never believe it's not so

24
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:12,200
# It's magic

25
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:15,075
# You know

26
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:21,158
# Never believe it's not so

27
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:24,867
# I love my sunny day

28
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,908
# Dream of far away

29
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:29,658
# Dreaming on my pillow

30
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:32,200
# In the morning

31
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:34,242

# In the morning light

35
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:49,700
Oh!

36
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,950
Ooh, I'm gonna be late!

37
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:08,450
...a lot more of you later.

38
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,658
Not just now, please.

39
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:15,617
# La-la-la la-la-la la!

40
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:19,033
# Mm, la-la-la la-la-la la

41
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,700
# Mm, la-la-la lee-la-la lor

42
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:26,283
# La!

43
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,742
Dougal!

44
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:29,908
Ugh!

45
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:32,283
Dougal, I knew you'd make it.

46
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,367
You're just in time for the concert!

47
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:37,742
Yes, Florence, of course.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

48
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,825
Well, don't think you're getting
a sugar lump just for turning up.

49
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,950
Sugar? Who needs sugar?

50
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,783
Not me. I quit! This morning!

51
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,867
Hm, I'll believe that when I see it!

52
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:52,200
-# Toreador Song from Carmen
- Ermintrude's about to begin.

53
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:54,283
- Oh, no!
- Be brave!

54
00:04:57,825 --> 00:04:59,408
- Florence...
- Ssh!

55
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:10,242
# Toreador, en garde!

56
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:15,617
# Toreador, Toreador

57
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:20,825
# Et songe bien, oui,
songe en combattant

58
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:26,825
# Qu'un oeil noir te regarde

59
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:29,033
# Et que l'amour t'attend

60
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,242
# Toreador

61
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:41,408
# Toreador, l'amour t'attend!

62
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:44,742
Ugh!

63
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,825
# You Really Got Me

64
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,283
# Girl, you really got me goin'

65
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,242
# You got me so I don't know
what I'm doin'

66
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,367

# You got me so I can't sleep at night

68
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,908
Go baby!

69
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:08,283
# Ye-e-e-e-eah
# Yeah, you really got me now

70
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,283
# You got me so I...
I don't know what I'm doing

71
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,158
# Oh, yeah, you really got me now
- Mm?

72
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:17,908
# You got me so I can't sleep at night

73
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:20,325
# You really got me, you really got me

74
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:21,992
# You really got me

75
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,325
D'you know what I mean?

76
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:29,325
# See, don't ever set me free

77
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:32,825
# I always wanna be by your side
# La la-la-la-la-la-la la la la

78
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,200
# Girl, you really got me now

79
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,742
# You've got me so
I can't sleep at night

80
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:40,867
Take it out.

81
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,117
# Yeah
# You really got me now

82
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:46,242
# You got me so I don't know
what I'm doin'

83
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:50,117
# Oh, yeah, you really got me now

84
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:52,825
# You got me so I can't sleep at night

85
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:55,742
# You really got me
# Yeah, yeah, you really got me

86
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:58,950
# You really got me,
you know, you, like, really got me

87
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:01,658
# O-o-o-o-o-o-ow!

88
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:04,783
Groove me, Erminduda!

89
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,825
# You really got me, you really got me

90
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,783
# You really got me
- Yeah, baby

91
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,617
# You really got me
- Milk it, Mummy!

92
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:13,408
# Me-e-e-e-e-e-e!

93
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:25,575
Pfffft!

94
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,867
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

95
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:31,325
What an unforeseeable accident.
That's not an easy fix, that.

96
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,575
We're looking at
a multiple abrasion friction gash.

97
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:37,617
I did not know you were
a qualified mechanic, Dougal.

98
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:41,200
Of course! If you bring me an air pump,
some glue, four watermelons,

99
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,117
water skis, a trombone
and gobstoppers,

100
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:45,742
I might just be able to help you out.

101
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:48,158
Ha, ha! I am lucky you were here.

102
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:52,950
- Will you take care of my things?
- Oh, I'll take care of them, all right.

103
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,908
Mm!

104
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:00,450
I think I'll take care of
those lollipops first.

105
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,658
Then...ooh, those sherbets.
And...ooh, those caramel creams.

106
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,242
Whoa!

107
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:11,658
Whoooa!

108
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,658
Thank you. Thank you.

109
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,325
Encore! Encore!

110
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:17,325
Thank you. So sweet.

111
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:21,492
- Now, for my next number, I shall...
- Whoa!

112
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,867
Help!

113
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:29,033
Oh, Dougal!

114
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,617
Help! Get me off!

115
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:32,617
How do I stop this thing?

116
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:35,242
Please help me!

117
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:41,367
- Whoa!
- Oof!

118
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:45,200
He's always got to make
a big entrance.

119
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,117
Oh dear, that's not good.

120
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,075
- Hold on tight, children.
- Help!

121
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,075
Mr Rusty!

122
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:03,033
Whoa!

123
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:06,075
Quick! I can't get off!

124
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:11,075
Oh, my goodness, it's out of control!

125
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,575
Wh-What's happening?

126
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:29,242
This is too Wagnerian for words!

127
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:30,908
Oh, Florence!

128
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:33,242
- What was that?
- Bad trip!

129
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,658
Puccini preserve us!
What's happened to the Roundabout?

130
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:41,158
Ugh! Oh, no. What's happening?

131
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:43,242
Florence! Are you all right?

132
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,450
Dougal! I'm cold!

133
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,200
Don't worry, Florence.
We'll get you out of there.

134
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:50,117
What on earth shall we do?

135
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,742
Zebedee! Zebedee! Zebedee!

136
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:00,742
Zebedee, thank goodness.

137
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:03,117
Whatever's the matter, my friends?

138
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:05,950
- Something awful has happened.
- Look.

139
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:07,617
Oh, no!

140
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:09,617
I hoped this day would never come.

141
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,283
What, Tuesdays?

142
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,950
But Tuesdays are great!

143
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:15,158
- On Tuesdays we make cake...
- No Dougal.

144
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:18,158
The day Zeebad escapes!

145
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:20,992
Zeebad? I thought
that was just a shaggy dog story.

146
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:24,200
I'm afraid not, Dougal. He's all too real.

147
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:27,700
Cold-hearted, tyrannous and cruel.

148
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:31,867
For thousands of years,
he kept our world bound in ice.

149
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:39,283
And now you've released him, he's free
to wield his terrifying power once more.

150
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,700
Oooh!

151
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,825
Free at last!

152
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:14,658
It took 10,000 years,

153
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:17,200
but the best things
are worth waiting for.

154
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,742
Power. Revenge...

155
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:23,242
and, er...more power!

156
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:31,950
Cold.
But not cold enough for my liking.

157
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,783
Ha, ha!

158
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,992
Soon it will be
nice and frozen everywhere,

159
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:42,158
just like it was
before Zebedee ruined everything.

160
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:44,700
Now, where to begin?

161
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:46,825
Eh?

162
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,075
Aha!

163
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,158
What's this?

164
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:55,450
Ooh, just what I need - a henchman!

165
00:11:57,742 --> 00:12:02,742
Today one soldier, tomorrow the world!

166
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,908
And then, perhaps,
three more soldiers!

167
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:11,283
Focus, Zeebad, focus!

168
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,117
I've done it!

169
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:26,658
A lean, mean, fighting machine
who'll obey my every command!

170
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:28,450
Eyes right!

171
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,117
Quick march!

172
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,658
# He's a lean, mean, fighting machine

173
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:37,617
# The real deal, know what I mean?

174
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:39,658
# Marching along

175
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,658
# Well, he'll take you on

176
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:44,492
# Watch out, here he comes

177
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,908
# He's a fighting machine

178
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:49,825
Argh!

179
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,158
Attention!

180
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,117
Name?

181
00:12:56,283 --> 00:12:59,617
Sergeant Sam, First Decorative
Clockwork Regiment, saaaaah!

182
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:04,075
Good! From now on, your mission
is to help me recover three diamonds

183
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,742
taken from me
by a treacherous thief.

184
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:09,158
Mm. The road will be hard.

185
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:14,700
Pain, misery and torment
will be your constant companion,

186
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:17,908
and your only release will be death!

187
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:22,950
Oh. Er, can I ask about holidays?

188
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:26,367
- Three weeks in summer.
- Very generous, sir.

189
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:30,242
Not that it will ever be summer again!

190
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:32,200
Oh.

191
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:36,408
Now let's see
what that worm Zebedee is up to.

192
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:44,117
Well, well.
He's got some little friends, has he?

193
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,867
I'll soon see to them.

194
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:51,950
To my old lair!
We shall plan our line of attack.

195
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:55,950
Only by returning
the enchanted diamonds

196
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:59,742
to their original places on the
Roundabout will you defeat Zeebad.

197
00:13:59,908 --> 00:14:03,950
But if he finds them first,
he will use them to freeze the sun!

198
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:09,700
Nothing will grow. Not even grass.

199
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,700
OK, people. We've got a problem.

200
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:16,950
One of the diamonds is hidden here,
on the Roundabout.

201
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:19,033
I must stay behind to guard it.

202
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,908
To find the other two,
you will need this map.

203
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:24,783
You must head north
into the mountains.

204
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,783
There is no time to waste.

205
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,950
Whoa!

206
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,825
Well, I hope you've supplied us with
an appropriate mode of transportation.

207
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,825
Whoops! Ha, ha, I'll just back up.

208
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:42,117
It's hardly the Orient Express, darling!

209
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:43,783
Does it have first class?

210
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,117
What?

211
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:48,033
Take good care of
this little box of tricks.

212
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,658
It may save you in your hour of need.

213
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:53,492
Florence, hold on. I'll be back.

214
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:56,367
- I promise.
- Don't be too long.

215
00:14:57,492 --> 00:14:59,908
Whatever happens,
you mustn't blame yourself.

216
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:02,033
- No, leave that to us.
- Hm!

217
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,283
All aboard!

218
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,658
Don't worry, children.
Our friends will save us.

219
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:10,825
Steam, check. Furnace, check.
Pistons, check. Wahey!

220
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:15,242
Sorry. Passengers.
I forgot the passengers.

221
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:20,283
Hello, trees!

222
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,242
Hello, birds!

223
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:24,242
Hello, scary freezing mist.

224
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,825
Oh, dear. Lucky they can't hear me.

225
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,283
I wouldn't want them thinking
I'm a scaredy-train.

226
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:34,075
Oh, Florence.

227
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:47,075
I wonder where we're going.
I wonder if they even know.

228
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:50,742
I wonder if they know that I don't
even know. Oh, this is so exciting!

229
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,742
- Dougal.
- Yeah?

230
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:55,575
You mustn't feel guilty
just because it's all your fault.

231
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:58,783
- Me?
- Oh, sorry, that didn't come out right.

232
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,575
My fault?

233
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:02,200
What did I do?

234
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:04,658
What, apart from wrecking
the Roundabout,

235
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:06,575
trapping Florence and the children

236
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:10,075
and causing the escape of a maniac
intent on freezing the sun?

237
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:12,908
I only wanted to get my teeth
into some sweeties.

238
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:17,325
Yeah, it starts with some sweets, man,
maybe an iced bun,

239
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:20,617
and before you know it
you're on two bags a day.

240
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:22,658
I know man, I've been there.

241
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:25,700
Maybe you've got, like, a problem,
my furry friend?

242
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:29,450
I have not! And I'll not rest
until I've done everything in my power

243
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,575
to bake things right.

244
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,617
I mean make things right.

245
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:36,033
Goodness, it's getting cold.

246
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,825
Tell me about it.
I'm freezing my nuts and bolts off here!

247
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,283
I must say,
you're all doing a wonderful job.

248
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,575
Keep up the good work.

249
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:06,950
What's for dinner anyway?
I'm famished!

250
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:13,408
Oh, I see, the silent treatment is it?
Huh!

251
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:18,825
It's lucky I brought
some secret supplies. Mm!

252
00:17:18,992 --> 00:17:20,908
Ah, full moon.

253
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,158
They say the full moon
puts people in the mood for romance.

254
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:31,325
What a perfect venue
for an open-air Verdi festival.

255
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:33,325
People would flock here.

256
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:35,283
# La-la-la la-la-la la!

257
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,617
Not even sheep
would flock to that noise.

258
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:40,908
# La-la-la lee-la-la lor!

259
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:47,033
- Uh-oh.
- Mm?

260
00:17:47,992 --> 00:17:49,658
That was a close shave.

261
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:53,158
My gobstoppers! Oh, no!

262
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:54,950
There's only one left!

263
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,658
Right! It's time we all got
some beauty sleep.

264
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:58,908
Dylan?

265
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,117
Dylan!

266
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:03,825
- Wha... What?
- Bedtime!

267
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:06,700
Gee, thanks for waking me up
to let me know.

268
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,117
Someone should keep watch.

269
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:10,117
- I was thinking...
- Good of you to offer.

270
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:11,617
- What?
- Good night.

271
00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:14,700
- Good night, darlings.
- Night-night, Ermindude.

272
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,200
Eh? What?

273
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,075
Now my impression
of a sleeper train.

274
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:20,200
Wait, wait...

275
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,992
Oh, no. I've run out of toothpaste!

276
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,825
Why do I have to be the guard dog?

277
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,950
What's wrong with a guard snail
or a guard cow or...?

278
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:51,908
Who goes there?

279
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:54,742
Friend or foe? Or...

280
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,825
...moose? F-Feeling a bit blue?

281
00:18:57,992 --> 00:18:59,908
You're not the only one.

282
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,783
Oh, is this a friend of yours?

283
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:08,908
I'll take that as a no!

284
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:13,825
- Dooougaaal?
- Dooougie?

285
00:19:13,992 --> 00:19:16,158
- Dougal?
- Doooougal?

286
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:19,575
- Dougal?
- Doogie? Doogie, man?

287
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,408
Here, Dougal. Here, Dougal.

288
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,950
Oooh, I've found a trail.
Maybe it'll lead us to him.

289
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:28,658
Or maybe it'll lead us to that...

290
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:31,700
...moose.

291
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,867
I think he's trying to tell us something.

292
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,117
Have you seen our friend Dougal?

293
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:42,742
Big black nose,
looks like a bad hair day on legs?

294
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,700
You're wasting your time, Brian.

295
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,117
Whoever heard of a talking moose?

296
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,950
Says the opera-singing cow.

297
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,700
Look, I think he wants us to follow him.

298
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,783
Come on! As fast as you can!

299
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:22,492
Now, you dim-witted draft excluder,
tell me everything.

300
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:24,950
Well, I was a very happy puppy.

301
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:28,325
My first memories are
of catching tennis balls with Florence.

302
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:31,950
- Then, as I grew up, she...
- No, you follicly-enhanced freak!

303
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,575
Tell me about the diamonds,

304
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:37,783
or I'll make you wish
you'd packed a pooper-scooper!

305
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,867
Me? I don't know anything.
I don't even have the map.

306
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:44,700
So, there's a map, eh?

307
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,908
No, no, no, no... No map.

308
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:50,575
Well, of course
they wouldn't trust you with it.

309
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:52,867
You're just a silly little dog.

310
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:55,450
You'd probably bury it or chew it!

311
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:58,617
So, who does have the map?

312
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:01,533
- Eh?
- I'll never tell!

313
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,783
Oh, no?

314
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,575
Sam, stop mincing around
with that duster.

315
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:10,658
Torture this boarding house for fleas
until he tells us everything.

316
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:11,825
Yes, sir!

317
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,908
Right, then. Torture!

318
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,492
Look, this is all a bit new to me,
so, erm...

319
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,450
what is it you're most afraid of?

320
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:22,033
Erm... Hm.

321
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,450
It won't be long now until I have
my full powers back.

322
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:28,992
Then I...

323
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:31,658
Oh, no! No, no! Not that!

324
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:33,408
Good Sam!

325
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:34,992
Enjoy yourself!

326
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:37,117
No, please! Ooh, no more!

327
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:40,617
- 26...
- Ooh, I can't stand it!

328
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:44,575
27... He can't possibly
take much more of this!

329
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:46,658
You've eaten 27 sugar cubes!

330
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:51,283
You'll have to make me eat 100
before I tell you anything!

331
00:21:51,992 --> 00:21:53,867
No, no! Please!

332
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:56,158
Soon the diamonds will be mine

333
00:21:56,367 --> 00:22:00,617
and I'll be able to turn
this hideous green planet

334
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:03,950
into a lovely frozen wasteland.

335
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:06,492
This is terrible!

336
00:22:11,658 --> 00:22:14,450
- No, you mustn't!
- Little more.

337
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:17,408
-...don't you?
- How long will this take? I'm working...

338
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,492
- Eh?
- Ooh, Ow! You're killing me!

339
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:25,450
Ooh!

340
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,825
- Argh!
- Ooh, that sounded painful!

341
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:36,408
Hee, hee! Excellent work, Sam.

342
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:40,617
No! Leave me alone, you evil fiend!

343
00:22:40,783 --> 00:22:42,825
What are you talking about?

344
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:45,283
It's me - Ermintrude.

345
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,992
Could you come back in five minutes?
I was just starting to enjoy myself.

346
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:50,617
Oh, come on, Dougal.

347
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:56,575
Full steam backwards!

348
00:22:59,908 --> 00:23:01,658
Finish him off, Sam.

349
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:03,825
It's time we...

350
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:08,367
The dog! What have you done
with him, you idiot?

351
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:13,533
Ooh... Well, sir, I got flattened
by a flying cow. Oooh!

352
00:23:15,158 --> 00:23:16,658
Not so fast!

353
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:20,325
Ow! Ooh, let go of my tail,
you br-brute.

354
00:23:20,492 --> 00:23:21,492
Ermintrude!

355
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:23,450
Faster!

356
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:27,658
- Aaaagh!
- Oooow!

357
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,408
Back it up, back it up!

358
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:34,783
How nice of you to drop in.

359
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,367
Pull!

360
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:40,075
Sorry, can't stay long.

361
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:45,117
- Aaaagh!
- Uh-oh! Whiplash!

362
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:46,658
Hello.

363
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,700
Ah, she looks a lot better
from this angle.

364
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:54,367
She'll look a lot better when she's being
served with a side order of fries.

365
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,825
After them!

366
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,242
This is cold
and very unpleasant. Where are we?

367
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:07,117
- Keep going! Keep going!
- There must be another way.

368
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:09,367
Yeah, man. Yeah, yeah.

369
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,367
Keep going, people.

370
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,825
Whoa!

371
00:24:13,908 --> 00:24:16,825
I'm a train, not a snowboard!

372
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:18,117
# Ba-ba-ba bom

373
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:19,950
# Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

374
00:24:20,117 --> 00:24:21,450
# Ba-ba-ba bom

375
00:24:21,617 --> 00:24:23,200
# Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

376
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,367
# Ba-ba-ba bom

377
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:25,617
# Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

378
00:24:25,783 --> 00:24:26,783
# Ba-ba-ba bom

379
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,283
# Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

380
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,617
# A-a-a-ah

381
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:32,867
# Ba-ba-ba bom

382
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:34,033
Aagh!

383
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:39,867
I was made to shunt...not to ski!

384
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:41,533
Aaargh!

385
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,742
Whoa, man, that's deep.

386
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,992
I think we've reached
the end of the line.

387
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:54,492
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

388
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:56,450
Sam, your sword!

389
00:24:56,617 --> 00:24:58,825
Sir! En garde!

390
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:04,908
Hey, man, give peace a chance.

391
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:07,533
Nobody can save you now.

392
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,908
Zebedee! Zededee! Zebedeeeee!

393
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,742
You!

394
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:22,575
So we meet again.

395
00:25:22,742 --> 00:25:24,450
Indeed.

396
00:25:24,617 --> 00:25:27,325
I've waited 10,000 years
for my revenge.

397
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:32,575
And, as you know,
revenge is a dish best served cold.

398
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,325
Some like it hot, Zeebad!

399
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:53,117
I've still got some spring in my step,
Zeebad.

400
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:03,992
Well done, Zebedee!

401
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:07,117
- Oh, no.
- I think the spring has sprung.

402
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:12,825
Oi! Where do you think
you lot are going?

403
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,325
Sam?

404
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,283
Sam! Stop!
Think about what you're doing.

405
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,825
It's not my job to think.

406
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:23,325
I'm a soldier. I'm just following orders.

407
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:27,700
You may wear a soldier's uniform,
Sam, but it's what's inside that counts.

408
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:28,867
Look out!

409
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:30,783
Ugh!

410
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,325
Blimey.

411
00:26:32,492 --> 00:26:34,617
Run! Run!

412
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:36,825
Come on, gang, here's our chance.

413
00:26:40,158 --> 00:26:41,825
Argh!

414
00:26:41,992 --> 00:26:44,742
Move that moustache!
Oops, nearly a toothpick.

415
00:27:03,492 --> 00:27:09,992
Your days in the sun are over,
Zebedee, you benevolent bed spring!

416
00:27:10,158 --> 00:27:13,533
Now it's time for Zeebad!

417
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,825
Stop! Zebedee's in trouble!

418
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,825
No, save yourselves!

419
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:22,783
What shall we do? What shall we do?

420
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,742
Well, we can't leave him.
To the rescue!

421
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:30,742
You've got to find the diamonds!

422
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:45,825
Ah, so it ends.

423
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:49,450
My nemesis finally vanquished forever.

424
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:53,617
Get the diamonds!

425
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:57,408
Noooooo!

426
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:00,992
We have no choice.
We must leave now.

427
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:03,075
There's nothing more we can do here.

428
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:09,617
- Come on, Doog.
- Quick.

429
00:28:10,783 --> 00:28:13,325
It's almost enough to make one weep,

430
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:17,700
if only I wasn't so very, very happy.
Ha, ha!

431
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:21,783
Now nothing can stand in my way!

432
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:35,450
No, Sam.
It's all in the back of the throat.

433
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:51,575
Right now, even if I could speak,
I wouldn't know what to say.

434
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:55,283
I can't believe he's really gone.

435
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,492
Zeb's dead, baby. Zeb's dead.

436
00:28:59,658 --> 00:29:03,117
And now who's going to help Florence
and the children?

437
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,783
Who's going to help us?

438
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,950
Be strong, Ermintrude.

439
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:09,700
We have to be brave
and find the diamonds.

440
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:14,408
After all,
that was Zebedee's dying wish.

441
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:26,242
It's no good, man.

442
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:28,742
Without Zebedee, we're nothing.

443
00:29:33,617 --> 00:29:35,492
No, Brian's right.

444
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:37,533
We're gonna save our world.

445
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,450
Now where's the map?

446
00:29:41,575 --> 00:29:44,367
There! Head for the tallest mountain
in that range.

447
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,408
That's the spirit, Brian!

448
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:50,783
Nothing short of a sea of boiling lava
will keep me from that diamond now.

449
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:53,533
Oh, sugar.

450
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,450
Well, that's where the diamond is.

451
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:58,492
Who's going to get it?

452
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:02,408
Ah, well, diamonds are a girl's
best friend. Off you trot, Ermintrude.

453
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:05,533
Men are supposed to give ladies
diamonds. Not the other way round.

454
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,867
Hey, I thought dogs
were supposed to fetch.

455
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:12,533
My forte's always been "sit, Dougal".
That, and "Stay, Dougal, stay".

456
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,533
Dylan...surely it's only a short hop
for such a brave bunny.

457
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,783
More like a long drop
for a dumb rabbit.

458
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,533
Quiet!

459
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:22,992
Ahem. There's a bridge over there.

460
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:27,658
I think I ought to keep a lookout here
while you lot cross to the other s...

461
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:30,575
He's not a dog, he's a chicken.

462
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:32,742
All right, all right. I understand.

463
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:34,783
You don't want to go
without your leader.

464
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,450
Talk about wag your own tail.

465
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:38,492
Oooh, I'm scared of heights.

466
00:30:38,658 --> 00:30:41,867
Don't worry about them -
it's the widths you have to worry about.

467
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,742
This is gonna be easy.

468
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,700
- Careful!
- Easy does it.

469
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:49,408
- A bit close to the edge.
- Just don't look down.

470
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:53,908
Look straight ahead.

471
00:30:54,075 --> 00:30:55,242
Whoa!

472
00:30:57,617 --> 00:30:59,992
Ooh, hot rocks, man!

473
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,867
Keep your eyes on the road!

474
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:04,992
- Wha... What road, man?
- I'm on it. Don't worry.

475
00:31:05,158 --> 00:31:06,950
Why have you stopped?

476
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:09,325
One step at a time.

477
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,408
Oh, yeah, oh...

478
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:16,908
There we go. This is gonna be easy.

479
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:20,242
Argh!

480
00:31:20,408 --> 00:31:22,075
Noooo!

481
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:28,533
Dylan! Do something!

482
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,825
Can't one of you
just hop out and push?

483
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:33,867
Whoa. I'm totally not train trained.

484
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:36,075
That's not helping, Dylan!

485
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:45,825
Ah, for a nice siding
and a can of warm oil.

486
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,450
No need to panic.

487
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,575
Now. Now is a good time to panic.

488
00:31:59,158 --> 00:32:01,450
Rock and roll, man!

489
00:32:01,617 --> 00:32:02,867
Brilliant.

490
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:05,075
I've had it with public transport!

491
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,700
The diamond!

492
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:15,867
Wo-ow!

493
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:17,700
And there you have it!

494
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:20,867
- I have led you all to the first diamond!
- Wow!

495
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:23,575
Dylan, do the honours, would you?

496
00:32:25,617 --> 00:32:27,783
Yeah. Cool.

497
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,992
Er, I-I think this thing needs tuning.

498
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,492
Something's happening!

499
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:41,742
- My feet are frozen.
- I'm cold.

500
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:44,367
Come on, children.
We... We have to be brave.

501
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,825
Look! It's Florence!

502
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:51,367
Strange. For a second there,
I thought I heard...

503
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:54,700
Oh... I must be going mad.

504
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:56,867
She can hear me! Florence!

505
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:59,242
It's me, Dougal. I've come to save you!

506
00:32:59,408 --> 00:33:01,367
Dougal? Is that you?

507
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,367
- What? No!
- Dougal?

508
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:05,908
- She's fading!
- Dougal!

509
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:10,117
It's only been one day
and the children are freezing fast.

510
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:16,492
Concerned for your friends?
Ha, ha, ha!

511
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:21,992
And I'll take the map too, please.

512
00:33:22,158 --> 00:33:24,742
Wait, how do you know there's a...

513
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:32,825
Well, they tortured it out of me!

514
00:33:33,908 --> 00:33:36,408
Give me that map!

515
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:42,908
- Please!
- Over my dead body!

516
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:45,825
Sam, get out the garlic butter!

517
00:33:45,992 --> 00:33:48,492
I'm feeling a little peckish.

518
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:49,992
You're bluffing.

519
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:53,408
Try me, you spineless slime-spreader!

520
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:54,742
Leave him alone!

521
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,908
Take the map.

522
00:33:58,075 --> 00:34:00,492
You're a despicable fiend!

523
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:02,950
I know, ha, ha, ha. It's a gift, really.

524
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:05,783
Compassion is such a weakness.

525
00:34:05,908 --> 00:34:08,117
Sorry we can't stay
but you know how it is.

526
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:11,950
- People to rule, places to freeze.
- Hup, hup, hup!

527
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,783
Come on, imbecile,
we have to destroy the bridge!

528
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,700
So long, suckers!

529
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,533
Hold up.

530
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:44,575
Aaaagh!

531
00:34:44,742 --> 00:34:45,950
Oh!

532
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:50,242
Good work, soldier!

533
00:34:50,408 --> 00:34:52,492
There's hope for you yet.

534
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,492
Thank you, sir!

535
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:55,950
Cor!

536
00:34:56,117 --> 00:35:00,867
Man, they don't make crumbling
rock causeways like they used to.

537
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:04,492
Is there any chance
it will, like, grow back?

538
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,908
At least we'll be nice and warm.

539
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:13,117
Oh, tragedy! We're doomed!

540
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:15,408
And just as I was about to make it big.

541
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:18,325
- You are big.
- Thank you, Dougal.

542
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:22,242
But I was hoping the peak of a volcano
wouldn't be the pinnacle of my career.

543
00:35:22,408 --> 00:35:26,325
Chill out, guys. I've got something
stashed that just might help.

544
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:29,783
Dylan, we don't have time to
experiment with recreational activities.

545
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:34,325
Zebedee's Magic Box!

546
00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:36,033
Of course!

547
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,533
Now, if I could just get my head round
how to work this thing.

548
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,700
Did Zebedee give anyone
the instructions?

549
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:44,908
Just press the button!

550
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,325
Whoa!

551
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:50,283
A boat. Brilliant.

552
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,533
It'll be plain sailing from here on in.

553
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,617
Wait! I've got it.

554
00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:57,700
The tents!

555
00:35:57,867 --> 00:35:59,783
He's really lost it this time.

556
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,492
Oh, this heat is making my horns curl!

557
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:05,325
I must look a sight.

558
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:07,700
Oh, no, Ermintrude. I think you look...

559
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:10,450
That is, I find you...

560
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:11,992
Look...

561
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:15,992
in case we don't make it out of here,
I just want you to know that...

562
00:36:16,158 --> 00:36:19,325
All aboard!

563
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,367
This is amazing!
I've never been this high before.

564
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:29,908
In fact, I've never been off the ground
before. What are we doing?

565
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:43,325
Well done, Dylan. A balloon escape.

566
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,700
My! You are clever.

567
00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:49,450
It's all about altitude over attitude,
Ermindude.

568
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:52,950
Excuse me,
but there's still one small problem.

569
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:56,242
We have no idea where we're going.

570
00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:59,325
Brian's right.
We could drift around for years!

571
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:02,325
Or we could just, like, follow them.

572
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:16,658
Faster, Sam. You row like a milkmaid!

573
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:18,408
Ease up, sir.

574
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:21,533
Now those pesky thieves
are out the way, what's the big rush?

575
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,075
Sam, imagine if you'd waited
10,000 years

576
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,158
to come home to your frozen kingdom,

577
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:31,242
only to find a world covered in flowers
and animals and sunshine and...

578
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:35,617
And trees and rainbows
and tiny little bunny rabbits.

579
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:38,867
Shut up and row, you wooden windbag!

580
00:37:39,117 --> 00:37:42,158
Soon I will have the second diamond,

581
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:45,867
and all those stranded simpletons
will have is each other...

582
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:49,742
for dinner!

583
00:37:53,158 --> 00:37:56,117
Sam, you're ruining the moment.

584
00:37:56,283 --> 00:37:58,117
Sorry, sir.

585
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:12,575
Is that the Milky Way, Ermintrude?

586
00:38:12,742 --> 00:38:17,075
Brian! You should never ask a lady
anything so personal!

587
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:19,200
What?

588
00:38:23,492 --> 00:38:25,492
Aren't the stars beautiful?

589
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:28,742
So beautiful.

590
00:38:28,908 --> 00:38:31,242
Wouldn't you love to be one of them?

591
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:34,200
I'd give anything.

592
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:37,242
You'd make a wonderful star.

593
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:39,658
Oh, I dare say you're right.

594
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:42,283
So serene.

595
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,533
So heavenly.

596
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:49,367
So admired and adored.

597
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:51,658
Always looking down on everyone.

598
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:55,742
Oooh, yes!

599
00:38:55,908 --> 00:38:59,283
We should get some sleep, man.

600
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,117
Honestly,
is that all you ever think about?

601
00:39:02,283 --> 00:39:04,742
Sure. Whenever I'm awake.

602
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:07,408
I can't sleep.

603
00:39:07,575 --> 00:39:09,492
I'm too worried about my Florence.

604
00:39:09,658 --> 00:39:11,658
She's so helpless without me.

605
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:13,533
She must be petrified.

606
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,075
Pets? Fried?

607
00:39:16,242 --> 00:39:18,283
Bad karma.

608
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,783
Exactly. I calm her down.

609
00:39:22,117 --> 00:39:24,450
The truth is, I do everything for her.

610
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:27,283
Her life would be quite empty
without me there.

611
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:32,117
Whoa...
Don't toast the hamsters, dude.

612
00:39:32,283 --> 00:39:36,450
During scary thunderstorms,
she insists I climb into bed with her...

613
00:39:36,617 --> 00:39:38,450
for her protection.

614
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:40,992
And she just loves to throw
a tennis ball.

615
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:42,867
Who's always there to bring it back

616
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:45,533
so she can have the pleasure
of throwing it again?

617
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,492
I'm telling you, Dylan.

618
00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:49,575
I bet she really misses that.

619
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:54,950
Really, really, really missing that.

620
00:39:56,783 --> 00:39:58,742
Florence?

621
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:00,742
Florence!

622
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:03,283
# Mr Blue Sky

623
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:12,158
# Sun is shinin' in the sky

624
00:40:12,783 --> 00:40:15,200
# There ain't a cloud in sight

625
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:17,200
# It's stopped rainin'

626
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:19,325
# Everybody's in a play

627
00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:23,575
# And don't you know
it's a beautiful new day

628
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:25,617
# Hey-ey-ey

629
00:40:25,783 --> 00:40:28,450
# Runnin' down the avenue

630
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:32,200
# See how the sun shines brightly

631
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:33,408
# In the city

632
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:36,242
# On the streets where once was pity

633
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:40,158
# Mr Blue Sky is living here today

634
00:40:40,325 --> 00:40:42,200
# Hey-ey-ey

635
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:44,033
# Mr Blue Sky

636
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,408
# Please tell us why

637
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:50,283
# You had to hide away for so long
# So long

638
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,408
# Where did we go wrong?

639
00:41:11,908 --> 00:41:14,908
# Mr Blue, you did it right

640
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:18,617
# But soon comes Mr Night

641
00:41:18,783 --> 00:41:22,283
# Creepin' over,
Now his hand is on your shoulder

642
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,700
# Never mind,
I'll remember you this way

643
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:28,117
# I'll remember you this way

644
00:41:28,283 --> 00:41:29,617
# Mr Blue Sky

645
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:31,158
# Please tell us why

646
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:34,492
# You had to hide away for so long

647
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,700
# So long

648
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:38,200
# Where did we go wrong?

649
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:12,075
Hey, man. Tropical vibes!

650
00:42:12,242 --> 00:42:14,575
But look, there's ice up ahead.

651
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:18,200
- Where?
- Something strange is definitely afoot.

652
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,325
Yeah, it's definitely a foot.

653
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:23,492
OK, everybody, prepare to land.

654
00:42:29,158 --> 00:42:31,117
Can't be far now.

655
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:38,617
This is definitely the place.

656
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:41,658
- Let's press on.
- Ow!

657
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:45,783
Hold up, sir.

658
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:49,867
After me, sir. It could be dangerous,
and I've got a sixth sense for...

659
00:42:50,908 --> 00:42:54,200
Try concentrating on the other five

660
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:56,242
and you might not lose your head.

661
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:58,867
Now, what do we have here?

662
00:43:00,283 --> 00:43:01,283
Aha!

663
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,242
The whole place is booby-trapped.

664
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,700
So, what do we do now, boss?

665
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:10,075
Land ho!

666
00:43:11,075 --> 00:43:12,075
Hmm.

667
00:43:12,242 --> 00:43:14,117
Thank goodness! I can't wait

668
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:16,158
to feel earth beneath my hooves.

669
00:43:16,325 --> 00:43:18,575
Any idea how we can land this thing?

670
00:43:18,742 --> 00:43:20,617
They're still alive!

671
00:43:20,783 --> 00:43:22,158
Well, boil my busby!

672
00:43:22,325 --> 00:43:25,992
No matter. All that booby traps require
are a bunch of boobies.

673
00:43:26,158 --> 00:43:30,158
We'll let them clear the way,
then we can just stroll in.

674
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:33,325
- Come on!
- Ooh!

675
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,242
Lower, lower.

676
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:39,158
Loads of room! Lower.

677
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,033
Here comes a...

678
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,283
- Stop!
-...nice smooth...

679
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:45,283
...crash.

680
00:43:47,242 --> 00:43:48,492
- Ow!
- Ooh!

681
00:43:48,658 --> 00:43:51,575
Just in time for lunch.

682
00:43:52,908 --> 00:43:55,033
And it looks like you're on the menu.

683
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
I wonder where Zeebad is.

684
00:43:57,367 --> 00:44:00,325
We must have overtaken him.
Nice one, Train!

685
00:44:00,492 --> 00:44:01,575
No worries, Rabbit.

686
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:03,992
Wait here
and keep your pistons pumping.

687
00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:05,700
We may need to make
a quick getaway.

688
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:08,408
Hey, let's make it
really quick and go now.

689
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,408
I wonder what these symbols mean.

690
00:44:24,575 --> 00:44:28,075
It's probably the ancient equivalent
of a welcome mat... Oh!

691
00:44:28,242 --> 00:44:30,408
Oh, where are my manners?

692
00:44:30,575 --> 00:44:33,242
- Ladies first.
- No, after you.

693
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:35,200
Age before beauty, dear.

694
00:44:35,367 --> 00:44:37,742
Oh, for heaven's sake, I'll go.

695
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,575
Don't look so shell-shocked,
Ermintrude.

696
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,367
I may be slow
but I can still take the lead.

697
00:44:43,492 --> 00:44:45,075
Just follow my trail.

698
00:44:45,242 --> 00:44:47,242
Well, look who's beginning
to grow a spine.

699
00:44:47,408 --> 00:44:49,575
Spine? What do you mean "spine"?

700
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:51,658
I'm always the first into the fray!

701
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:55,158
Those lazy tykes. I'm the only one
who does anything around here!

702
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,075
It's "Brian do this, Brian do that."

703
00:44:57,242 --> 00:44:59,158
"Yes, sir. No, sir. Three bags full, sir."

704
00:44:59,325 --> 00:45:01,033
They treat me like a slave!

705
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,158
It's a disgrace. "Where's my sugar?"

706
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,700
"Where's my grass?"
They must think I'm a soft touch.

707
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:07,700
But I always go crawling back.

708
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:10,200
Well, come on, it's all clear.

709
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,492
Let's go.

710
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:27,242
I never thought I'd say this but...
what a snail!

711
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:30,200
OK, wait here. That's what they said.
Wait.

712
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:31,533
Urgh!

713
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,617
I-I don't like this.

714
00:45:33,783 --> 00:45:35,367
I don't like this.

715
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:38,575
What's this? I'll go into the tunnel.
I'm a train. I like tunnels.

716
00:45:38,742 --> 00:45:41,033
I'll wait here, that's it, yeah.

717
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,200
I'll wait just...

718
00:45:47,325 --> 00:45:49,283
Oooh!

719
00:45:56,617 --> 00:45:58,325
Mmm...

720
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,408
- Hey!
- Whoa!

721
00:46:00,575 --> 00:46:02,450
Anyone find the diamonds?

722
00:46:02,617 --> 00:46:05,658
Oh, Doog, man. Don't you know
rabbits are kind of jumpy?

723
00:46:05,825 --> 00:46:07,617
I don't see any clues.

724
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:11,575
We must be in the wrong place.

725
00:46:11,742 --> 00:46:16,242
Oooh, a throne - the perfect place
to enjoy my last gobstopper.

726
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,158
Oh, great, a recline button!

727
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
Ooooh!

728
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,617
Whoaaa!

729
00:46:32,492 --> 00:46:33,658
The diamond!

730
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,283
Cool light show, man.

731
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:49,117
Hello, pretty lasers.

732
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:50,533
No-ooo!

733
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,158
They're alarm beams!

734
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:55,200
Someone has to get through
to the diamond.

735
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:58,242
- Well, I'm too hairy.
- I've got the shakes.

736
00:46:58,408 --> 00:47:00,575
Oh, for the love of Mozart, I'll do it!

737
00:47:00,742 --> 00:47:03,117
I trained as a ballerina, you know.

738
00:47:03,283 --> 00:47:05,200
My Swan Lake was the talk of...

739
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:09,200
Stop milking the moment
and get me out of here!

740
00:47:10,658 --> 00:47:12,075
Ommmm.

741
00:47:12,242 --> 00:47:14,742
# In The Hall Of The Mountain King

742
00:47:23,867 --> 00:47:26,158
Aah...

743
00:47:28,658 --> 00:47:30,617
# Da-daaa!

744
00:47:30,783 --> 00:47:32,533
Weeeeee!

745
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,283
Well done! That was bril...

746
00:47:45,783 --> 00:47:47,575
No-oooo!

747
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,700
Oops!

748
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:21,617
I don't suppose anyone knows
anything about martial arts?

749
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:28,158
Just the basics of, like, kung fu, karate,
judo, kendo, tae kwon do,

750
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:31,033
anything-you-can-do and...t'ai chi.

751
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,408
Oooh!
Do they come with egg fried rice?

752
00:48:33,575 --> 00:48:36,158
Dylan...can you beat them up?

753
00:48:36,325 --> 00:48:38,825
Sorry, I don't believe in violence.

754
00:48:43,658 --> 00:48:45,533
Except in self-defence.

755
00:48:53,742 --> 00:48:58,658
Oh, man! That's what I call
pulling yourself together.

756
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:03,533
Ya! Ya!

757
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,325
Wee!

758
00:49:07,575 --> 00:49:10,742
- Wa! Ta! Come on, man.
- Dylan!

759
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,408
Ah, fa da!

760
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,992
I'm not just another pretty face!

761
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:20,700
Sha ka!

762
00:49:20,867 --> 00:49:22,658
Woo-hoo ya!

763
00:49:24,825 --> 00:49:26,783
Ya woo!

764
00:49:28,908 --> 00:49:32,825
Good group effort. Now, let's grab
the diamond and head off.

765
00:49:36,367 --> 00:49:38,200
I'm a train, I have a whistle.

766
00:49:40,408 --> 00:49:44,367
It's dark down here.
Lucky I have tunnel vision, hee, hee!

767
00:49:45,742 --> 00:49:48,325
Whoa!

768
00:49:48,492 --> 00:49:51,158
Big engine, alloy wheels...

769
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:55,283
You wouldn't want to be
on the wrong end of that.

770
00:49:57,867 --> 00:49:59,575
Whoa.

771
00:50:04,325 --> 00:50:05,575
Uh-oh!

772
00:50:09,283 --> 00:50:10,992
So...

773
00:50:11,158 --> 00:50:17,658
The fearless warrior of legend
has come to claim the diamond!

774
00:50:17,825 --> 00:50:21,992
Erm, no actually, the fearless warrior
couldn't make it today,

775
00:50:22,158 --> 00:50:23,658
so we came instead.

776
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:26,117
Er, we'll drop it in to him
on the way home.

777
00:50:26,283 --> 00:50:30,658
Look, do you want the diamond
or don't you?

778
00:50:30,825 --> 00:50:33,700
Er, well, if you're offering...yes, please!

779
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:35,658
I've got a better idea.

780
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,575
Let's jump him!

781
00:50:37,742 --> 00:50:41,450
Chaaaaaa...

782
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:44,450
...aaaaaaa...

783
00:50:44,617 --> 00:50:49,533
...aaaarge!

784
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:54,158
It was just a thought.

785
00:50:54,325 --> 00:50:56,783
How about...run away!

786
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,575
Oh, no!

787
00:51:06,617 --> 00:51:08,075
Aaagh!

788
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:09,283
He-He-Help!

789
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:10,992
Help!

790
00:51:11,158 --> 00:51:14,283
Dogs are meant to eat bones,
not the other way around!

791
00:51:25,825 --> 00:51:26,825
Huh?

792
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:29,658
Aaaaargh!

793
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:34,492
That was quick thinking, Dougal.

794
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,533
Yeah, well, if you keep your cool

795
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,783
and don't run around like a headless
chicken... No time for chitchat.

796
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,825
Let's grab that diamond and get out.

797
00:51:44,325 --> 00:51:45,450
It's gone!

798
00:51:47,492 --> 00:51:50,450
Fools! Looking for this?

799
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:54,408
You just can't get the staff these days.

800
00:51:55,325 --> 00:52:00,283
Now, do you want to tell me
where the third diamond is?

801
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,742
Nope.

802
00:52:01,908 --> 00:52:04,200
Resistance is futile!

803
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:07,158
You're no match for the great Zeebad!

804
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:08,658
Pride comes before a fall.

805
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,367
Dougal! Now!

806
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Whoa!

807
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:14,492
Hooray!
That's the last we'll see of them.

808
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:17,283
- Oooh...
- Euch!

809
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,408
Oooh!

810
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,033
Ouch!

811
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,783
That took him down a peg or ten!

812
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:28,575
Yeah, man, except you just flushed
away diamonds one and two.

813
00:52:28,742 --> 00:52:31,117
So...where do we go now?

814
00:52:31,283 --> 00:52:34,242
We must get back to the Roundabout
as fast as we can.

815
00:52:34,408 --> 00:52:36,658
I know there's like,
"no rest for the wicked",

816
00:52:36,825 --> 00:52:40,492
but I'm one of the good guys
and right now I need a siesta.

817
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,242
Whoa!

818
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:46,283
Look!

819
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,367
Voices! I knew they'd come
to rescue me.

820
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,492
Hang on, maybe I'm supposed to be
rescuing them.

821
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,742
Hey, that sound's familiar.

822
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:01,117
Typical train. Always turns up
when you least expect it.

823
00:53:01,283 --> 00:53:03,867
Come on, gang. In we go.

824
00:53:04,117 --> 00:53:05,658
Oh, no.

825
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,575
Right, now, let's get out of here.

826
00:53:09,742 --> 00:53:12,408
Oh, do slow down,
you're making my milk churn.

827
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:15,075
Are you kidding?
We're moving at a snail's pace!

828
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:16,700
Snail's pace suits me just fine.

829
00:53:16,867 --> 00:53:19,283
Oh, Ermintrude!

830
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:21,492
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said.

831
00:53:21,658 --> 00:53:23,367
Relax, Doogie.

832
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,283
Soon this whole crazy trip
will be behind us.

833
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,200
Behind us!

834
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:31,367
- That's what I said, man.
- No! Behind us!

835
00:53:33,492 --> 00:53:35,242
Faster! Faster!

836
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:38,450
Duck!

837
00:53:38,617 --> 00:53:40,158
Oof!

838
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,200
I always wanted to be a roller coaster!

839
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:47,033
Whoa!

840
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,492
Whoa, dudes!

841
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,408
Talk about a near-death experience.

842
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:52,700
I thought I saw the light
at the end of the tunnel.

843
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:55,617
That is the light
at the end of the tunnel!

844
00:53:55,783 --> 00:53:57,492
We're going to be OK!

845
00:53:57,658 --> 00:54:00,117
And Zeebad's still trapped
in the temple!

846
00:54:03,492 --> 00:54:07,700
Then, like, who's that,
his evil twin, Zeebadder?

847
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:15,617
Where's my third diamond?

848
00:54:20,908 --> 00:54:25,283
Whoa! Furnace, don't fail me now!

849
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,658
Whoo!

850
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,533
Aaagh!

851
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,992
Brace yourself, everybody!

852
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:40,325
Whoa! Mind the gap!

853
00:54:44,408 --> 00:54:45,408
Hey!

854
00:54:50,408 --> 00:54:52,408
Here comes big nose!

855
00:54:58,783 --> 00:55:00,325
Somebody do something!

856
00:55:00,908 --> 00:55:05,200
Hey, this must be
some kinda anti-spring device.

857
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:07,617
- This'll slow Zeebad down.
- Really?

858
00:55:07,783 --> 00:55:10,533
- Aaaagh!
- Or it could be an ejector seat.

859
00:55:13,908 --> 00:55:16,367
What the devil was that?

860
00:55:16,533 --> 00:55:18,617
What happened? Why am I blind?

861
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,617
Did we reach the Roundabout yet?

862
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,450
So that's where you're headed!

863
00:55:24,617 --> 00:55:25,742
The Roundabout!

864
00:55:25,908 --> 00:55:29,658
And that's where I'll find my diamond!

865
00:55:29,825 --> 00:55:32,617
So long, slimeball!

866
00:55:33,533 --> 00:55:36,200
Aaagh! Ooooh...

867
00:55:36,325 --> 00:55:39,533
Sam, get up on the roof
and dispose of the prisoner.

868
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,242
Dispose of a prisoner?

869
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:43,617
Can't do that, sir. Geneva Convention.

870
00:55:43,783 --> 00:55:46,242
Guess what? I'm unconventional!

871
00:55:49,408 --> 00:55:51,492
Un-con-ventional. Ha, ha, ha!

872
00:55:51,658 --> 00:55:53,283
Off with his head!

873
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,617
Aaaargh! He-eeelp!

874
00:55:55,783 --> 00:55:57,283
Brian!

875
00:56:03,408 --> 00:56:04,408
Ouch!

876
00:56:04,575 --> 00:56:06,117
Whoa!

877
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:10,742
- Welcome aboard!
- Ermintrude, you saved me!

878
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,367
Don't cross me,
you tarted-up tin opener!

879
00:56:16,533 --> 00:56:18,700
Faster, you lily-livered traitor!

880
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:20,533
I want that diamond!

881
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,408
More coal!

882
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:30,075
Oh! No!

883
00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:32,200
Trouble dead ahead!

884
00:56:33,283 --> 00:56:34,700
That's my line!

885
00:56:35,575 --> 00:56:37,408
Argh!

886
00:56:38,283 --> 00:56:42,783
Now, this is what happens
when you don't brush regularly!

887
00:56:48,908 --> 00:56:51,367
Sir! The pressure - it's too much!

888
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,367
I know, I know!

889
00:56:53,533 --> 00:56:57,658
Sometimes I feel
I'm going quite insane!

890
00:56:57,825 --> 00:56:59,533
No, sir, it's the boiler!

891
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,700
It's...

892
00:57:03,617 --> 00:57:07,283
Thank goodness! We're safe!

893
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,325
I call that letting off steam!

894
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:10,658
- Hurrah!
- Whoa!

895
00:57:12,158 --> 00:57:14,825
I can fly-y-y!

896
00:57:16,158 --> 00:57:17,158
No, I can't.

897
00:57:18,992 --> 00:57:20,367
Aaaargh!

898
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:26,575
Oh, that's enough flying for one day!

899
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:29,742
We've got to get to the Roundabout
before Zeebad.

900
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:34,325
Hang on, Zeebad doesn't know
the diamond's at the Roundabout.

901
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,950
Erm... Well, that's not strictly true...

902
00:57:37,117 --> 00:57:38,658
Back there, on the Train...

903
00:57:38,825 --> 00:57:42,158
I-I was confused and it...
it just slipped out.

904
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:43,492
Brian, man!

905
00:57:43,658 --> 00:57:45,950
Well there's no use
crying over spilt milk.

906
00:57:46,117 --> 00:57:48,033
That's easy for you to say.

907
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,033
Come on, people. To the Train!

908
00:57:51,742 --> 00:57:53,700
Ow!

909
00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:58,242
Whoa. Looks like
this service has been cancelled.

910
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,867
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

911
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:01,617
Delays look likely.

912
00:58:01,783 --> 00:58:03,575
I think I've pulled a piston.

913
00:58:03,742 --> 00:58:06,158
Ow! Nope, it's not gonna happen.

914
00:58:06,325 --> 00:58:08,075
Oh, poor Trainy!

915
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:10,492
Oh, the sun's setting.

916
00:58:10,658 --> 00:58:13,450
We'll just have to make it
under our own steam.

917
00:58:13,617 --> 00:58:16,033
Goodbye for now, old buddy.

918
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:19,033
You can make it.

919
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,617
Just follow our tracks.

920
00:58:20,783 --> 00:58:24,200
Don't worry about me.
You go on, find the diamond.

921
00:58:27,158 --> 00:58:30,033
On second thoughts... What about me?

922
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:35,867
Wretched machines!

923
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:38,908
I must reach the Roundabout before...

924
00:58:39,075 --> 00:58:40,533
Ooh, sir!

925
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,283
Medic needed.

926
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:45,408
SOS. Mayday. Oooh...

927
00:58:45,575 --> 00:58:47,325
Me? Help you?

928
00:58:47,492 --> 00:58:51,867
You treacherous
mollusc-sparing disco dolly!

929
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:54,450
Your tour of duty is over.

930
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:57,075
You can't leave an injured soldier, sir.

931
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,450
Can't I?

932
00:58:58,617 --> 00:59:00,575
Just watch me.

933
00:59:01,492 --> 00:59:03,033
Wait!

934
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,200
Come back!

935
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:11,075
Evil villains...can be so cruel.

936
00:59:21,075 --> 00:59:22,533
I can't go on.

937
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,908
We've been walking for hours.

938
00:59:25,075 --> 00:59:27,408
It's so c-c-cold.

939
00:59:27,575 --> 00:59:30,033
I can't feel my limb.

940
00:59:30,992 --> 00:59:33,367
But Florence...and the children.

941
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:36,867
If we don't get there soon,
they'll be frozen stiff.

942
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:39,575
Oh, the cruel hands of time!

943
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:45,492
But if it... if it wasn't for time,
everything would, like, happen at once.

944
00:59:45,658 --> 00:59:48,575
Wait. What's that?

945
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,367
Footprints! Maybe they'll lead us
back to the village.

946
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:59,575
But, like, what kinda freaky creatures
would leave prints like these?

947
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:01,867
They must be exhausted too.

948
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:06,242
One of them seems to be
crawling along the ground.

949
01:00:06,408 --> 01:00:08,992
I prefer the term gliding.

950
01:00:09,158 --> 01:00:11,242
Oh, no! They're ours!

951
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:12,908
Oh, no!

952
01:00:13,075 --> 01:00:14,908
No, no!

953
01:00:15,075 --> 01:00:20,908
Well, that's it, man.
It's time for the big sleep.

954
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,908
We did our best.

955
01:00:23,075 --> 01:00:26,367
But our best wasn't good enough. Oh...

956
01:00:26,533 --> 01:00:28,533
Oh, it's the final curtain.

957
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:33,992
No. We mustn't sleep.

958
01:00:34,158 --> 01:00:36,117
It's too cold.

959
01:00:37,075 --> 01:00:38,908
It's too cold.

960
01:00:39,075 --> 01:00:40,950
We mustn't...

961
01:00:41,117 --> 01:00:43,033
Florence...

962
01:01:06,283 --> 01:01:09,200
Doooougaaaal!

963
01:01:10,283 --> 01:01:13,450
- Dougal?
- Florence! You're OK!

964
01:01:13,617 --> 01:01:15,742
I'm more than OK.

965
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:18,950
I'm swee-eeet.

966
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:21,867
But what about the Roundabout?

967
01:01:22,033 --> 01:01:25,033
The children? Huddled. Freezing.

968
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,575
Don't worry, Dougal.

969
01:01:26,742 --> 01:01:28,533
You're with me now...

970
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:32,492
in sugar paradise!

971
01:01:33,367 --> 01:01:38,283
Look. Sweets for my sweet Dougal.

972
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:48,033
And you can eat as much as you like!

973
01:01:51,617 --> 01:01:55,117
N-No, this isn't right!
I must be going nuts.

974
01:01:55,283 --> 01:01:58,075
I have to wake up. Save Florence.

975
01:01:58,242 --> 01:01:59,908
Florence!

976
01:02:00,075 --> 01:02:01,200
No!

977
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:03,242
It was just a dream.

978
01:02:03,408 --> 01:02:06,700
Florence!

979
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:11,158
Flore-eeeeence!

980
01:02:31,617 --> 01:02:34,283
Come on. Wake up!

981
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,325
Wake up! Wake up!

982
01:02:36,492 --> 01:02:41,325
No way, man. I'm in a higher state
of unconsciousness.

983
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:45,117
It's getting light
and we're still completely lost.

984
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:47,117
I'm not so sure we are.

985
01:02:47,283 --> 01:02:49,242
Oh!

986
01:02:50,242 --> 01:02:54,158
Whoa, that was some
serious sleepwalking.

987
01:02:55,492 --> 01:02:57,158
Look!

988
01:02:57,325 --> 01:02:58,867
Look, look, look!

989
01:02:59,033 --> 01:03:01,408
Quick! Come and have a look!
Look at that!

990
01:03:01,575 --> 01:03:03,450
Is that really what I think it is?

991
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:05,533
Home?

992
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,242
Hm!

993
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,575
Curses!

994
01:03:14,742 --> 01:03:17,325
The diamond
must be here somewhere!

995
01:03:17,492 --> 01:03:18,867
Zeebad!

996
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:20,367
You!

997
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:23,408
This roundabout ain't big enough
for the both of us!

998
01:03:23,575 --> 01:03:29,075
When I leave someone for dead,
I expect them to die.

999
01:03:29,242 --> 01:03:31,742
Can't you even do that right? Eh?

1000
01:03:31,992 --> 01:03:35,117
Oh, I haven't done anything right
since I left the Roundabout.

1001
01:03:35,283 --> 01:03:37,575
Now it's time for me
to resume my post.

1002
01:03:37,742 --> 01:03:40,408
You? You were on the Roundabout?

1003
01:03:40,575 --> 01:03:41,992
Yeah, I was.

1004
01:03:42,158 --> 01:03:43,867
Guarding it from the likes of you.

1005
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:45,908
Ha! Look at the state of you!

1006
01:03:46,075 --> 01:03:48,200
You couldn't guard a boiled egg!

1007
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:51,158
Well, I might have taken a battering,

1008
01:03:51,325 --> 01:03:53,200
but it's like Zebedee told me:

1009
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:55,533
it's what's inside that counts!

1010
01:03:56,408 --> 01:04:00,283
Chaaaaarge!

1011
01:04:01,617 --> 01:04:03,117
Ugh!

1012
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,658
Ooh...

1013
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,242
Ooh!

1014
01:04:12,408 --> 01:04:13,908
The diamond!

1015
01:04:14,075 --> 01:04:18,617
Oooh, Zebedee, you cunning swine.

1016
01:04:18,783 --> 01:04:24,283
And to think, I nearly abandoned it
when I left you to die.

1017
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:27,200
Ooh, the irony!

1018
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:32,575
Now, time for the big chill!

1019
01:04:40,033 --> 01:04:42,117
This can't be our village.

1020
01:04:42,283 --> 01:04:43,867
I don't recognise a thing.

1021
01:04:44,033 --> 01:04:47,075
Yeah, like, maybe we took
a wrong turn, Doog.

1022
01:04:47,242 --> 01:04:49,367
No, no, this is definitely it.

1023
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:51,950
If we go past this white thingy

1024
01:04:52,117 --> 01:04:53,950
and by this white bit...

1025
01:04:54,117 --> 01:04:56,492
just round the corner should be the...

1026
01:04:56,658 --> 01:04:59,158
# Also Sprach Zarathustra

1027
01:04:59,992 --> 01:05:01,075
Oh, no!

1028
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:19,408
Ha, ha, ha!

1029
01:05:27,658 --> 01:05:28,783
Zeebad!

1030
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,075
Ah, perfect!

1031
01:05:32,242 --> 01:05:35,533
You've arrived
just in time for the finale.

1032
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,450
So long, sunshine!

1033
01:05:52,158 --> 01:05:53,992
Florence!

1034
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:05,033
Oh, Florence!

1035
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,492
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1036
01:06:09,658 --> 01:06:11,367
This is all my fault.

1037
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:15,742
If only I hadn't been
so greedy and stupid.

1038
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:20,450
Farewell, then, Dylan.
Goodbye, dear Brian.

1039
01:06:20,617 --> 01:06:24,242
Er...Ermintrude, before we freeze,

1040
01:06:24,408 --> 01:06:28,117
there's something
I've been t-trying to t-tell you...

1041
01:06:32,158 --> 01:06:39,450
This guy is seriously
messing with my karma!

1042
01:06:43,408 --> 01:06:48,242
Eat this,
you jumped-up jack-in-the-box! Ya!

1043
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:53,408
Ooof! You just don't know
when you're beaten, do you?

1044
01:06:55,158 --> 01:06:57,367
Take a chill pill, rabbit!

1045
01:06:57,533 --> 01:06:59,950
Whoa! Whoa!

1046
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,908
Aaaaaaaagh!

1047
01:07:04,075 --> 01:07:06,367
Wait a minute. That's it!

1048
01:07:06,533 --> 01:07:09,700
Ermintrude, sing!
Sing as loud as you can!

1049
01:07:14,283 --> 01:07:17,117
I'm not used to working
under these conditions!

1050
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,158
Dougal might be onto something.

1051
01:07:19,325 --> 01:07:22,033
Yes! Ermintrude! Sing!

1052
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,158
I haven't even warmed up!

1053
01:07:24,325 --> 01:07:26,408
Ermintrude! Sing!

1054
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,783
Fine.

1055
01:07:32,117 --> 01:07:35,950
What is that abominable noise?

1056
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:42,992
Whoa!

1057
01:07:58,617 --> 01:07:59,992
Shell loaded!

1058
01:08:00,158 --> 01:08:02,117
# I Love To Boogie

1059
01:08:02,283 --> 01:08:03,283
Take this!

1060
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:04,825
Run!

1061
01:08:04,992 --> 01:08:05,992
Whoa!

1062
01:08:06,158 --> 01:08:09,158
Ready? Aim. Fire!

1063
01:08:09,325 --> 01:08:10,908
Whoooooa!

1064
01:08:11,075 --> 01:08:12,533
Ooh-hoo!

1065
01:08:13,825 --> 01:08:15,575
Well done!

1066
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:17,742
Oof!

1067
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:20,950
Whoooa!

1068
01:08:21,117 --> 01:08:23,450
# Jenny lost her cherry
walking all the way home...

1069
01:08:23,617 --> 01:08:25,367
Dylan, it's coming your way!

1070
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:29,617
Whoa, that was some hit!

1071
01:08:30,617 --> 01:08:34,033
Whoa! Psy-che-delic!

1072
01:08:35,283 --> 01:08:37,033
# I said we love to boogie

1073
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,575
# We love to boogie...

1074
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,742
I got it, man.

1075
01:08:45,575 --> 01:08:46,575
No!

1076
01:08:46,742 --> 01:08:48,367
Whooooa!

1077
01:08:50,492 --> 01:08:52,200
Over to me! Over to me!

1078
01:08:52,367 --> 01:08:54,908
No! It's mine! Mine! Ha, ha!

1079
01:08:55,075 --> 01:08:56,367
Oof!

1080
01:09:01,533 --> 01:09:02,533
Two-nil!

1081
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,117
The game's not over yet.

1082
01:09:05,283 --> 01:09:07,408
Oof! Oh!

1083
01:09:07,575 --> 01:09:09,492
Oooh, nice catch, Zeebad!

1084
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:11,325
Now let's get the final...

1085
01:09:11,492 --> 01:09:12,492
diamond!

1086
01:09:12,658 --> 01:09:14,283
Touch it and you're toast.

1087
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,408
You don't scare me!
You're just a big, blue bully.

1088
01:09:17,575 --> 01:09:19,367
Now the tables have turned

1089
01:09:19,533 --> 01:09:21,908
and all we need do
is put this last diamond back on...

1090
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,075
Oops.

1091
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,533
Here comes a home run!

1092
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,283
Not again!

1093
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:30,325
Argh!

1094
01:09:38,658 --> 01:09:40,242
Victory!

1095
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:47,533
So close and yet so...

1096
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,533
far out!

1097
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,867
Nice try - for a bunch of dumb animals!

1098
01:09:53,033 --> 01:09:56,033
But now it's closing time at the zoo.

1099
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,533
Not with our secret weapon:
Zebedee's magic box!

1100
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,242
- Huh?
- Ya!

1101
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:09,992
It d-doesn't work. Aw!

1102
01:10:18,033 --> 01:10:19,908
Oooooh!

1103
01:10:20,075 --> 01:10:22,575
Zebedee's toys can't help you now.

1104
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:27,200
Bounce back from that, Slinky!
Woo-hoo!

1105
01:10:27,367 --> 01:10:29,158
Train! I knew you'd make it!

1106
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:31,367
- Bang on schedule.
- The diamond!

1107
01:10:31,533 --> 01:10:32,950
I'll get it.

1108
01:10:33,117 --> 01:10:36,325
I got us into this mess
and I'll get us out.

1109
01:10:38,533 --> 01:10:39,658
Go on, Dougal.

1110
01:11:39,658 --> 01:11:41,575
Ooh! Ow!

1111
01:11:46,575 --> 01:11:48,575
No-ooo-ooo!

1112
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:24,075
Huh?

1113
01:12:26,533 --> 01:12:28,492
Hm.

1114
01:12:31,408 --> 01:12:33,367
Mm-mm! Ha, ha, ha!

1115
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,658
We did it! We did it!

1116
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:45,242
We did it! We did it!

1117
01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:48,158
Come on!

1118
01:12:49,658 --> 01:12:51,200
Well done!

1119
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,908
There's nothing like opera
for breaking the ice.

1120
01:12:55,367 --> 01:13:00,033
I can see grass, man!
Sweet, green grass!

1121
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,158
But where's Florence?

1122
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:05,617
Florence?

1123
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:09,408
Florence!

1124
01:13:10,325 --> 01:13:12,242
Florence, can you hear me?

1125
01:13:12,408 --> 01:13:14,200
Please wake up.

1126
01:13:14,367 --> 01:13:16,908
Please wake up. Don't leave me.

1127
01:13:17,075 --> 01:13:19,283
This world means nothing without you!

1128
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:21,408
Sorry, old buddy.

1129
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:23,158
No, it can't...

1130
01:13:23,325 --> 01:13:24,742
She can't...

1131
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:26,658
Florence!

1132
01:13:26,825 --> 01:13:28,825
My lovely Florence!

1133
01:13:40,117 --> 01:13:41,325
She moved!

1134
01:13:44,992 --> 01:13:46,200
She's alive!

1135
01:13:46,367 --> 01:13:49,658
Oh, Florence!
I thought I'd lost you forever!

1136
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,867
And I thought I'd lost you too, Dougal.

1137
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:54,200
But you saved my life.

1138
01:13:54,367 --> 01:13:55,992
And everyone else's.

1139
01:13:56,158 --> 01:13:57,742
Oh, stop it.

1140
01:13:57,908 --> 01:14:00,200
It's what any incredibly heroic dog
would do.

1141
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:02,075
Oh?

1142
01:14:02,242 --> 01:14:04,242
So you don't want a...

1143
01:14:04,408 --> 01:14:05,950
little reward?

1144
01:14:06,117 --> 01:14:07,742
Oh, no. I've learnt my lesson.

1145
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:10,200
I'm not having anything more
to do with lollipops.

1146
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:11,700
Or gobstoppers.

1147
01:14:11,867 --> 01:14:13,117
Or toffees.

1148
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,408
But wait, where's Zebedee?

1149
01:14:21,742 --> 01:14:22,992
Zebedee!

1150
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:26,283
Bravo, my friends.
I always knew you could do it!

1151
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:27,908
But we thought you were dead!

1152
01:14:28,075 --> 01:14:29,908
Dead? Nonsense, Dougal!

1153
01:14:30,075 --> 01:14:34,367
Everyone knows that after winter
it's time for spring!

1154
01:14:41,242 --> 01:14:43,783
Come on, everyone.
To the Roundabout!

1155
01:14:46,867 --> 01:14:48,783
# Sugar Sugar

1156
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:55,200
Oh, no!

1157
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:57,033
How come it's not moving?

1158
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,283
It's like stuck, man.

1159
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,033
What's wrong with the Roundabout?

1160
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,742
Zebedee?

1161
01:15:02,908 --> 01:15:04,200
Don't you remember?

1162
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:06,742
The Roundabout's
still missing something.

1163
01:15:06,908 --> 01:15:09,617
Or should I say... someone?

1164
01:15:14,992 --> 01:15:16,575
Sam?

1165
01:15:16,742 --> 01:15:18,575
But that's Zeebad's henchman!

1166
01:15:18,742 --> 01:15:20,325
He tortured me!

1167
01:15:21,408 --> 01:15:23,658
Don't be too hard on him.

1168
01:15:23,825 --> 01:15:28,033
Sam too was a victim
of Zeebad's maniacal magic.

1169
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:41,200
It's time for you to return
where you belong, Sam.

1170
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,908
# Sugar

1171
01:15:54,908 --> 01:15:56,783
# Ah, honey, honey

1172
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:01,950
# You are my candy girl

1173
01:16:02,117 --> 01:16:05,783
# And you got me wanting you...

1174
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,783
Mm!

1175
01:16:10,658 --> 01:16:12,617
# Ah, sugar, sugar...

1176
01:16:15,992 --> 01:16:18,992
Nice shade of moose!

1177
01:16:20,825 --> 01:16:22,658
With matching hooves!

1178
01:16:23,408 --> 01:16:26,783
# I just can't believe
the loveliness of loving you...

1179
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,825
- Dougal?
- Huh?

1180
01:16:28,992 --> 01:16:32,117
Dougal? Dougal?

1181
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:35,283
# I just can't believe
the wonder of this feeling too

1182
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:38,200
# I just can't believe it's true

1183
01:16:38,367 --> 01:16:40,242
# Ah, sugar...

1184
01:16:44,492 --> 01:16:49,200
# The Magic Roundabout

1185
01:16:51,242 --> 01:16:54,742
# The birds and the bees
are all singin' to me

1186
01:16:54,908 --> 01:16:56,783
# Tell me what you see

1187
01:16:56,950 --> 01:17:00,575
# The beautiful sky
always makin' us happy

1188
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:03,658
# It's gonna be a wonderful trip...

1189
01:17:03,825 --> 01:17:06,700
- Dougal!
- Erm...

1190
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:08,700
# Together you and me...

1191
01:17:08,867 --> 01:17:10,825
Sugar, sugar, sugar!

1192
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:13,908
Sugar!

1193
01:17:14,825 --> 01:17:18,075
# I'm riding high up in the sky

1194
01:17:18,242 --> 01:17:20,242
# Can you see?

1195
01:17:20,408 --> 01:17:23,117
# The sun is shinin'

1196
01:17:23,283 --> 01:17:26,242

# The Magic Roundabout

1207
01:18:03,117 --> 01:18:07,033
# Off on an adventure,
we're comin' to getcha

1208
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,617
# Wherever that may be

1209
01:18:09,783 --> 01:18:13,033
# Won't let anything come here
and upset you

1210
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,242
# I'm gonna set you free

1211
01:18:15,408 --> 01:18:19,158
# Whatever happens along the way,
it's gonna be fine

1212
01:18:19,325 --> 01:18:21,033
# Oh, yeah

1213
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,950

1218
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:37,700
Oh, curses!

1219
01:18:37,867 --> 01:18:39,992
Imprisoned once more!

1220
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:44,617
Ah, well, at least it's cold.

1221
01:18:51,742 --> 01:18:53,700
Double curses!

1222
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:01,283
# The Magic Roundabout

01:19:02,325 --> 01:19:06,033

Time for bed!
