For thousands of years,he kept our world bound in ice.

127
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,931

00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,494
冷,但还不够冷到我高兴

134
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,218

不久之后,到处就会一片冰天雪地了
Soon it will be.nice and frozen everywhere,

136
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,299
就像齐比迪破坏掉一切之前那样子
just like it was before Zebedee ruined everything.

137
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,729
现在,从哪开始呢?
Now, where to begin?

138
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,937
这是什么?
What's this?

139
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,053
正是我需要的...一个心腹!
Ooh, just what I need - a henchman!

140
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,055
今日一个士兵,明日征服全世界!
Today one soldier, tomorrow the world!

141
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,090
然后也许,再多三个士兵!
And then, perhaps,three more soldiers!

142
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,252
专心,齐贝,专心点!
Focus, Zeebad, focus!

143
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,738
成功了!
I've done it!

144
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,015
一忠实,坏的格斗机器会服从我每个命令!
A lean, mean, fighting machine,who'll obey my every command!

145
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,732
向右看!
Eyes right!

146
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,339
齐步走!
Quick march!

147
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,736
"他是个忠实,坏心眼的格斗机器"
He's a lean, mean, fighting machine

148
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,535
"真正的坏蛋,懂我意思吧?"
The real deal, know what I mean?

149
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,491
"往前迈进"
Marching along

150
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,417
"他会和你一决胜负"
Well, he'll take you on

151
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,100
"小心,他来了"
Watch out, here he comes

152
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,450
"他是个格斗机器"
He's a fighting machine

153
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,411
立正!
Attention!

154
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,289
报名
Name?

155
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,651
中士山姆,皇家第一发条团!
Sergeant Sam, First Decorative Clockwork Regiment, saaaaah!

156
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,932
很好! 从现起,你任务就是帮我找回三颗钻石
Good! From now on, your mission is to help me recover 3 diamonds

157
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,494
被个奸诈小偷从我身上偷走的
taken from me by a treacherous thief.

158
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,815
路途会很艰辛
Mm. The road will be hard.

159
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:51,139
痛苦、悲惨和磨难将不断与你为伍
Pain, misery and torment will be your constant companion,

160
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,218
而你唯一的解脱将是死亡!
and your only release will be death!

161
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,055
可以要求放假吗?
Oh. Er, can I ask about holidays?

162
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,331
-夏天放假三周-非常慷慨,长官
- Three weeks in summer.- Very generous, sir.

163
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,055
不过不会再有夏天了!
Not that it will ever be summer again!

164
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,973
现在来看看那个臭虫齐比迪想搞什么鬼
Now let's see what that worm Zebedee is up to.

165
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,375
他有几位小朋友呢
Well, well.He's got some little friends, has he?

166
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,014
我很快会去拜访他们
I'll soon see to them.

167
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,895
到我的旧窝!我们计划来个一连串的攻击
To my old lair!We shall plan our line of attack.

168
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,728
唯有找回魔法钻石
Only by returning the enchanted diamonds

169
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,375
放回旋转木马原来的位置才能打败齐贝
to their original places on the Roundabout will you defeat Zeebad.

170
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,413
但如果被他先发现他会用它们来冰冻太阳!
But if he finds them first,he'll use them to freeze the sun!

171
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,930
寸土寸草不生
Nothing will grow. Not even grass.

172
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,813
好的,各位,我们有个问题
OK, people. We've got a problem.

173
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,897
其中一颗钻石就藏在这儿的旋转木马
One of the diamonds is hidden here,on the Roundabout.

174
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,897
我必须留在后面来守护它
I must stay behind to guard it.

175
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,659
要找出其它两颗你们会需要这份地图
To find the other two,you will need this map.

176
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,417
你们必须前往北边山上
You must head north into the mountains.

177
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,337
没时间好磨蹭了
There is no time to waste.

178
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,175
希望你有提供我们适合的交通工具
Well, I hope you've supplied us with an appropriate mode of transportation.

179
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,855
哈哈,我倒车一下
Whoops! Ha, ha, I'll just back up.

180
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,050
勉强算是东方快车,亲爱的!
It's hardly the Orient Express, darling!

181
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,659
它有头等舱吗?
Does it have first class?

182
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,929
什么?
What?

183
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,733
谨慎保管这个小小魔法盒
Take good care of this little box of tricks.

184
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,249
紧要关头时可能会救你们一命
It may save you in your hour of need.

185
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,940
佛罗伦丝,撑下去,我会回来的
Florence, hold on. I'll be back.

186
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,731
-我保证
-别太久唷
- I promise.- Don't be too long.

187
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,135
不管发生什么事
千万别怪你自己
Whatever happens,you mustn't blame yourself.

188
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,171
不,交给我们吧
- No, leave that to us.- Hm!

189
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,369
所有人登车!
All aboard!

190
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,617
孩子们别担心我们的朋友会救我们的
Don't worry, children.Our friends will save us.

191
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,619
蒸汽正常,锅炉室正常活塞正常!
Steam, check. Furnace, check.Pistons, check. Wahey!

192
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,855
乘客抱歉,忘了还有乘客
Sorry. Passengers.I forgot the passengers.

193
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,693
树木好!
Hello, trees!

194
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,572
小鸟好!
Hello, birds!

195
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,497
恐怖凛冽的雾气好
Hello, scary freezing mist.

196
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,978
幸亏它们没听到
Oh, dear. Lucky they can't hear me.

197
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,330
我不希望它们认为
我是辆恐怖列车
I wouldn't want them thinking I'm a scaredy-train.

198
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,938
哦,佛罗伦丝
Oh, Florence.

199
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,418
不知我们去何方,不知他们知不知道
I wonder where we're going.I wonder if they even know.

200
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,930
不知道他们知不知道我根本不知道,哦,这太刺激了!
I wonder if they know that I don't even know. Oh, this is exciting!

201
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,857
-嘟狗-干嘛?
- Dougal.- Yeah?

202
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,574
千万不要觉得内疚,只因为这全是你的错
You mustn't feel guilty just because it's all your fault.

203
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,658
-我?-不好意思,那样说不太好
- Me?- Oh, sorry, that didn't come out right.

204
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,372
我的错?
My fault?

205
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,933
我做了什么?
What did I do?

206
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,290
除了毁掉旋转木马...
What, apart from wrecking the Roundabout,

207
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,138
困住佛罗伦丝和孩子们...
trapping Florence and the children

208
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,491
还导致一个企图冰冻太阳的疯子脱逃
and causing the escape of a maniac intent on freezing the sun?

209
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,180
我只是想牙缝塞点糖果
I only wanted to get my teeth into some sweeties.

210
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,452
对,就是糖果起的因也许是冰面包
Yeah, it starts with some sweets, man,maybe an iced bun,

211
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,617
在你察觉之前你就已经一天吃了两包
and before you know it,you're on two bags a day.

212
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,571
我晓得,我有过经验
I know man, I've been there.

213
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,498
也许你有个问题我的毛茸茸朋友?
Maybe you've got, like, a problem,my furry friend?

214
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,090
我没有! 我不会放弃的直到我尽我一切力量...
I have not! And I'll not rest until I've done everything in my power

215
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,131
把事情烤好
to bake things right.

216
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,091
我是指把事情搞好
I mean make things right.

217
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,415
老天,越来越冷了
Goodness, it's getting cold.

218
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,055
告诉我一下在这里我螺栓螺帽都要冻僵了!
Tell me about it.I'm freezing my nuts and bolts off here!

219
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,613
我必须说,你们全做的很棒
I must say,you're all doing a wonderful job.

220
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,810
继续保持下去
Keep up the good work.

221
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,090
晚餐吃什么? 我饿扁了!
What's for dinner anyway?I'm famished!

222
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,299
我懂了,沉默以待,是不是?
哼!
Oh, I see, the silent treatment is it?Huh!

223
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,498
幸好我带了些秘密补给!
It's lucky I brought some secret supplies. Mm!

224
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,497
满月
Ah, full moon.

225
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,577
听说满月教人陷入罗曼蒂克气氛中
They say the full moon puts people in the mood for romance.

226
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,492
多么完美的场地呀,刚适合办户外韦瓦第节庆演唱
What a perfect venue for an open-air Verdi festival.

227
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,417
这里会挤的人山人海的
People would flock here.

228
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,492
就连羊也受不了那种噪音
Not even sheep
would flock to that noise.

229
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,571
惨了
- Uh-oh.- Mm?

230
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,098
真是九死一生
That was a close shave.

231
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,455
我的口香糖! 哦,不!
My gobstoppers! Oh, no!

232
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,172
只剩一个了!
There's only one left!

233
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,768
对! 我们都该好好睡个美容觉了
Right! It's time we all got some beauty sleep.

234
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,969
狄伦?
Dylan?

235
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,089
狄伦!
Dylan!

236
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,688
-怎...怎么?-睡觉时间到了!
- Wha... What?- Bedtime!

237
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,459
老天,谢谢你叫醒我让我晓得
Gee, thanks for waking me up to let me know.

238
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,808
应该要有人来守卫
Someone should keep watch.

239
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,737
-我在想...-真是太感谢你了
- I was thinking...- Good of you to offer.

240
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,179
-什么?-晚安
- What?- Good night.

241
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,133
-晚安,各位亲爱的-晚安安,爱蜜楚
- Good night, darlings.- Night-night, Ermindude.

242
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,579
什么?
Eh? What?

243
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,372
现在我是沉睡的列车了
Now my impression of a sleeper train.

244
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,411
等等,等等...
Wait, wait...

245
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,059
糟糕,我牙膏用完了!
Oh, no. I've run out of toothpaste!

246
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,017
我干嘛非得当守卫犬?
Why do I have to be the guard dog?

247
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,974
不能是守卫蜗牛或守卫母牛或...?
What's wrong with a guard snail or a guard cow or...?

248
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,852
谁在那里?
Who goes there?

249
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,540
是敌是友? 还是...
Friend or foe? Or...

250
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,538
糜鹿? 感觉有点忧郁(蓝色)?
...moose? F-Feeling a bit blue?

251
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,537
你不是唯一这样的
You're not the only one.

252
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,208
是你朋友吗?
Oh, is this a friend of yours?

253
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,177
我想这代表不是吧!
I'll take that as a no!

254
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,893
-嘟狗?-嘟嘟狗?
- Dougal?- Dougie?

255
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,136
-嘟狗?-嘟狗?
- Dougal?- Dougal?

256
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,411
-嘟狗?-小嘟? 小嘟?
- Dougal?- Doogie? Doogie, man?

257
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,178
出来,嘟狗! 出来,嘟狗!
Here, Dougal. Here, Dougal.

258
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,530
我发现个痕迹.也许会指引我们找到他
Oooh, I've found a trail.Maybe it'll lead us to him.

259
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,128
或者也许会指引我们找到...
Or maybe it'll lead us to that...

260
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,051
糜鹿
...moose.

261
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,054
我觉得他想告诉我们什么事
I think he's trying to tell us something.

262
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,216
你有见过我们朋友嘟狗吗?
Have you seen our friend Dougal?

263
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,652
又大又黑的鼻子,脚上的毛一团乱糟糟的
Big black nose,looks like a bad hair day on legs?

264
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,532
你在浪费时间,布莱恩
You're wasting your time, Brian.

265
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,855
谁听过会讲话的糜鹿呢?
Whoever heard of a talking moose?

266
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,540
该说是唱歌剧的母牛吧
Says the opera-singing cow.

267
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,130
听着,我觉得他想要我们跟他走
Look, I think he wants us to follow him.

268
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,017
快点! 用最快速度前进吧!
Come on! As fast as you can!

269
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,815
现在,你这低等智慧的毛刷
通通老实招来
Now, you dim-witted draft excluder,tell me everything.

270
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,170
我是只非常快乐的小狗
Well, I was a very happy puppy.

271
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,417
我最初的印象便是和佛罗伦丝接网球
My first memories are of catching tennis balls with Florence.

272
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,896
-后来我长大了,她...-不,你这进化迟钝的怪胎!
- Then, as I grew up, she...- No, you follicly-enhanced freak!

273
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,409
告诉我钻石的事
Tell me about the diamonds,

274
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,498
否则我教你求生不得求死不能!
or I'll make you wish you'd packed a pooper-scooper!

275
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,453
我? 我什么都不知道甚至连地图都没有
Me? I don't know anything.I don't even have the map.

276
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,129
原来有地图啊
So, there's a map, eh?

277
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,212
不不不不...没有地图
No, no, no, no... No map.

278
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,774
他们当然不会放心交给你携带
Well, of course they wouldn't trust you with it.

279
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,970
你只是只小笨狗
You're just a silly little dog.

280
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,455
你可能会埋起来或嚼了它!
You'd probably bury it or chew it!

281
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,496
地图在谁身上?
So, who does have the map?

282
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,291
我绝不会说的!
- Eh?- I'll never tell!

283
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,489
不会吗?
Oh, no?

284
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,135
山姆,别再拿着那根掸子刷来刷去的了
Sam, stop mincing around with that duster.

285
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,048
给他严刑逼供直到他全盘托出为止
Torture this boarding house for fleas until he tells us everything.

286
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,169
是,长官!
Yes, sir!

287
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,131
那好吧,酷刑!
Right, then. Torture!

288
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,615
听着,这种事我还不大熟
所以...
Look, this is all a bit new to me,so, erm...

289
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,492
你最怕的是什么?
what is it you're most afraid of?

290
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,171
不久就可以恢复我全部的实力了
It won't be long now until I have my full powers back.

291
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,653
然后我...
Then I...

292
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,214
不! 不,不! 不要那样!
Oh, no! No, no! Not that!

293
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,898
很好,山姆!
Good Sam!

294
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,419
好好玩吧!
Enjoy yourself!

295
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,451
拜不要! 别再来了!
No, please! Ooh, no more!

296
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,811
-26...
-哦,我受不了了!
- 26...- Ooh, I can't stand it!

297
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,615
27...他不可能吃下更多了!
27... He can't possibly take much more of this!

298
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,617
你已吃了27个方糖!
You've eaten 27 sugar cubes!

299
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,052
你得逼我吃下一百个
我才会告诉你一切!
You'll have to make me eat 100 before I tell you anything!

300
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,531
不,不! 拜!
No, no! Please!

301
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,730
钻石很快就会是我的了
Soon the diamonds will be mine

302
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,018
而我就能把这丑陋的绿色星球...
and I'll be able to turn this hideous green planet

303
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,212
变成一处可爱的冰冻荒地
into a lovely frozen wasteland.

304
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,649
太可怕了!
This is terrible!

305
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,299
-不,你千万不可!
-再来一点
- No, you mustn't!- Little more.

306
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,139
-...你不动手了吗?
-还要多久? 我在工作...
-...don't you?- How long will this take? I'm working...

307
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,015
喔! 你在害死我!
- Eh?- Ooh, Ow! You're killing me!

308
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,933
听起来蛮痛的!
- Argh!- Ooh, that sounded painful!

309
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,370
嘻嘻! 干的漂亮,山姆
Hee, hee! Excellent work, Sam.

310
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,413
不! 少碰我,你这邪恶的恶魔!
No! Leave me alone, you evil fiend!

311
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,531
你在碎碎个什么劲?
What are you talking about?

312
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,890
是我啊...爱蜜楚
It's me - Ermintrude.

313
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,456
你能五分钟后再来吗?
我才刚开始玩的开心呢
Could you come back in five minutes?I was just starting to enjoy myself.

314
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,013
快点,嘟狗
Oh, come on, Dougal.

315
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,732
蒸汽全开向后!
Full steam backwards!

316
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,618
解决掉他,山姆
Finish him off, Sam.

317
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,696
我们该...
It's time we...

318
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,053
狗!
你对他做了什么好事,你这白痴?
The dog! What have you done with him, you idiot?

319
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,015
长官,我被一头飞天母牛给压扁了!
Ooh... Well, sir, I got flattened by a flying cow. Oooh!

320
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,019
别跑的这么快!
Not so fast!

321
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,530
放开我的尾巴,畜生
Ow! Ooh, let go of my tail,you br-brute.

322
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,649
爱蜜楚!
Ermintrude!

323
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,532
再快一点!
Faster!

324
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,208
倒车,倒车!
Back it up, back it up!

325
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,418
你真好心来拜访我
How nice of you to drop in.

326
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,939
拉!
Pull!

327
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,499
很抱歉,无法久留了
Sorry, can't stay long.

328
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,333
极速飞车!
- Aaaagh!- Uh-oh! Whiplash!

329
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,814
你好
Hello.

330
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,738
她从这个角度看比较好看
Ah, she looks a lot better from this angle.

331
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,217
等她成为座上佳肴时会更好看
She'll look a lot better when she's being served with a side order of fries.

332
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,573
去追他们!
After them!

333
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,698
这里又冷又不舒服
我们在哪里?
This is cold and very unpleasant. Where are we?

334
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,459
-继续走! 继续走!
-一定有别条路的
- Keep going! Keep going!- There must be another way.

335
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,616
对,对
Yeah, man. Yeah, yeah.

336
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,537
继续走,各位
Keep going, people.

337
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,773
我是火车,不是雪橇!
I'm a train, not a snowboard!

338
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,015
"吧-吧-吧碰"
Ba-ba-ba bom

339
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,778
"继续转呀转"
Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

340
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,219
"吧-吧-吧碰"
Ba-ba-ba bom

341
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,898
"继续转呀转"
Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

342
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,009
"吧-吧-吧碰"
Ba-ba-ba bom

343
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,215
"继续转呀转"
Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

344
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,329
"吧-吧-吧碰"
Ba-ba-ba bom

345
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,735
"继续转呀转"
Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

346
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,976
"啊"
A-a-a-ah

347
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,169
"吧-吧-吧碰"
Ba-ba-ba bom

348
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,894
我的用途是行驶...不是滑雪!
I was made to shunt...not to ski!

349
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,495
哇,好深
Whoa, man, that's deep.

350
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,568
我们我们已抵达了尽头
I think we've reached the end of the line.

351
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,931
相信我所说的话吧
You took the words right out of my mouth.

352
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,812
山姆,拔剑!
Sam, your sword!

353
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,090
长官! 冲锋!
Sir! En garde!

354
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,934
喂,老兄,给和平一个机会
Hey, man, give peace a chance.

355
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,449
现在神仙也救不了你们了
Nobody can save you now.

356
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,656
齐比迪! 齐比迪! 齐比迪!
Zebedee! Zededee! Zebedeeeee!

357
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,172
是你!
You!

358
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,891
我们又见面了
So we meet again.

359
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,692
没错
Indeed.

360
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,459
我等了一万年要报仇
I've waited 10,000 year for my revenge.

361
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,495
诚如你所知道的
复仇这道菜,越冷越够味
And, as you know,revenge is a dish best served cold.

362
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,093
有些人喜欢热食,齐贝!
Some like it hot, Zeebad!

363
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,213
我底下还有些弹簧呢,齐贝
I've still got some spring in my step,Zeebad.

364
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,657
漂亮,齐比迪!
Well done, Zebedee!

365
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,658
-哦,不
-我想弹簧已经弹掉了
- Oh, no.- I think the spring has sprung.

366
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,130
喂! 你们想去哪呀?
Oi! Where do you think you lot are going?

367
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,493
山姆?
Sam?

368
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,339
山姆! 住手!
考虑清楚你在干嘛
Sam! Stop!Think about what you're doing.

369
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,813
我的任务不是考虑
It's not my job to think.

370
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,215
我是士兵,就遵守命令呀
I'm a soldier. I'm just following orders.

371
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,413
你或许穿着军服,山姆但心里面想的才重要
You may wear a soldier's uniform,Sam, but it's what's inside that counts.

372
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,529
小心!
Look out!

373
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,853
哎呀
Blimey.

374
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,050
逃! 快逃!
Run! Run!

375
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,171
大伙快点,我们的机会来了
Come on, gang, here's our chance.

376
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,773
小胡子让开!喔,差点变牙签了
Move that moustache!Oops, nearly a toothpick.

377
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:13,009
你在阳光下的日子结束了齐比迪,你这心软的弹簧!
Your days in the sun are over,Zebedee, you benevolent bed spring!

378
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,416
现在该轮到齐贝的时代了!
Now it's time for Zeebad!

379
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,491
停! 齐比迪有麻烦了!
Stop! Zebedee's in trouble!

380
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,417
不,救你们自己吧!
No, save yourselves!

381
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,292
怎么办? 怎么办?
What shall we do? What shall we do?

382
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,139
我们不能丢下他不官救他!
Well, we can't leave him.To the rescue!

383
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,934
你们得去找钻石!
You've got to find the diamonds!

384
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,417
结束了
Ah, so it ends.

385
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,896
我的仇人终于永远消失了
My nemesis finally vanquished forever.

386
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,899
去取得钻石!
Get the diamonds!

387
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,500
不!
Noooooo!

388
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,975
没得选择了,现在一定要离开
We have no choice.We must leave now.

389
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,977
这里我们再也帮不上忙了
There's nothing more we can do here.

390
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,251
-快点,嘟狗-快
- Come on, Doog.- Quick.

391
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,808
掉一滴泪差不多就够了
It's almost enough to make one weep,

392
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,013
若非我这么非常非常快乐的话哈哈!
if only I wasn't so very, very happy.Ha, ha!

393
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,928
现在什么也阻挡不了我了!
Now nothing can stand in my way!

394
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,055
不对,山姆
要从喉咙后面发出来
No, Sam.It's all in the back of the throat.

395
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,532
此时就算我能说话也不晓得该说什么了
Right now, even if I could speak,I wouldn't know what to say.

396
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,098
不敢相信他竟然真的走了
I can't believe he's really gone.

397
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,133
齐比死了,宝贝,齐比死了
Zeb's dead, baby. Zeb's dead.

398
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,616
现在谁来救佛罗伦丝和孩子们呢?
And now who's going to help Florence and the children?

399
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,219
谁会帮助我们?
Who's going to help us?

400
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,296
坚强点,爱蜜楚
Be strong, Ermintrude.

401
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,934
我们必须勇敢起来找到钻石
We have to be brave and find the diamonds.

402
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,451
毕竟那是齐比迪的临终愿望
After all,
that was Zebedee's dying wish.

403
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,818
情形不妙,老兄
It's no good, man.

404
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,215
少了齐比迪,我们一无是处
Without Zebedee, we're nothing.

405
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,691
不,布莱恩说的对
No, Brian's right.

406
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,651
我们要拯救我们的世界
We're gonna save our world.

407
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,498
地图在哪?
Now where's the map?

408
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,219
那边! 朝向那边最高峰
There! Head for the tallest mountain
in that range.

409
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,171
就是那股精神,布莱恩!
That's the spirit, Brian!

410
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,373
现在上刀山下油锅也阻止不了我取得钻石的决心
Nothing short of a sea of boiling lava will keep me from that diamond now.

411
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,011
哦,蜜糖
Oh, sugar.

412
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,810
钻石就在那里
Well, that's where the diamond is.

413
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,771
谁去拿?
Who's going to get it?

414
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,529
钻石是女孩最好的朋友快过去吧,爱蜜楚
Ah, well, diamonds are a girl's best friend. Off you trot, Ermintrude.

415
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,538
钻石应该由男士交给淑女而不是反过来才对
Men are supposed to give ladies diamonds. Not the other way round.

416
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,776
嘿,我以为狗狗才该去接取的
Hey, I thought dogs
were supposed to fetch.

417
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,257
我的优点一向是“坐下,嘟狗”以及“待着,嘟狗,待着”
My forte's always been "sit, Dougal".That, and "Stay, Dougal, stay".

418
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,089
狄伦...你这么勇敢的兔子一定只要稍微跳一下就过去了
Dylan...surely it's only a short hop for such a brave bunny.

419
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,256
对个呆兔子来说比较像是一落千丈
More like a long drop for a dumb rabbit.

420
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,938
安静!
Quiet!

421
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,291
那边有座桥
Ahem. There's a bridge over there.

422
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,777
我想我应该在这里警戒你们过桥到另一边...
I think I ought to keep a lookout here
while you lot cross to the other s...

423
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,573
他不是狗,是胆小鬼
He's not a dog, he's a chicken.

424
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,656
好吧好吧,我懂
All right, all right. I understand.

425
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,611
没我带队你们不肯去
You don't want to go
without your leader.

426
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,219
少往自己脸上贴金了
Talk about wag your own tail.

427
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,171
哦,我惧高
Oooh, I'm scared of heights.

428
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,417
别担忧高度...你要担忧的是宽度才对
Don't worry about them -it's the widths you have to worry about.

429
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,212
这事轻而易举
This is gonna be easy.

430
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,092
-小心点!-很容易嘛
- Careful!- Easy does it.

431
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,656
-离边边只差一点点-别往下看就是
- A bit close to the edge.- Just don't look down.

432
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,976
笔直看着前方
Look straight ahead.

433
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,809
哦,滚烫的岩浆,老天!
Ooh, hot rocks, man!

434
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,612
眼睛看着路面!
Keep your eyes on the road!

435
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,618
-什...什么路面?-没问题的,别担心
- Wha... What road, man?- I'm on it. Don't worry.

436
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,492
干嘛停下来?
Why have you stopped?

437
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,770
一次一步
One step at a time.

438
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,777
哦,没错,哦...
Oh, yeah, oh...

439
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,053
前进了,这会很容易的
There we go. This is gonna be easy.

440
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,018
不!
Noooo!

441
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,212
狄伦! 想想办法!
Dylan! Do something!

442
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,410
你们就不能一个跳出去推吗?
Can't one of you
just hop out and push?

443
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,338
我完全没受过火车训练
Whoa. I'm totally not train trained.

444
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,451
那样说根本没帮助,狄伦!
That's not helping, Dylan!

445
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,819
加上一段铁轨和一罐热油
Ah, for a nice siding
and a can of warm oil.

446
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,298
无须惊慌
No need to panic.

447
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,331
现在才该惊慌
Now. Now is a good time to panic.

448
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,810
摇滚,老天!
Rock and roll, man!

449
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,168
棒极了
Brilliant.

450
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,291
我受够了大众传输工具!
I've had it with public transport!

451
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,538
钻石!
The diamond!

452
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,418
就在那里!
And there you have it!

453
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,452
我已带领各位找到了第一颗钻石!
- I have led you all to the first diamond!
- Wow!

454
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,048
狄伦,头彩就让给你,好吗?
Dylan, do the honours, would you?

455
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,096
嗯,酷
Yeah. Cool.

456
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,178
我想这东西需要调整
Er, I-I think this thing needs tuning.

457
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,573
有事要发生了!
Something's happening!

458
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,497
-我的脚冻僵了-我好冷
- My feet are frozen.- I'm cold.

459
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,009
加油,孩子们我们...我们必须勇敢才行
Come on, children.We... We have to be brave.

460
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,370
看! 是佛罗伦丝!
Look! It's Florence!

461
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,738
奇怪,刚才我以为听到了...
Strange. For a second there,
I thought I heard...

462
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,930
哦...我一定是快疯了
Oh... I must be going mad.

463
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,016
她能听见我! 佛罗伦丝!
She can hear me! Florence!

464
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,290
是我嘟狗呀,我来救你了!
It's me, Dougal. I've come to save you!

465
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,331
嘟狗? 是你吗?
Dougal? Is that you?

466
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,217
-怎么? 不!
-嘟狗?
- What? No!- Dougal?

467
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,693
-她逐渐消失了!
-嘟狗!
- She's fading!- Dougal!

468
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,733
才一天光景
且孩子们迅速结冻中
It's only been one day and the children are freezing fast.

469
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,855
担忧你们的朋友吗?
哈哈哈!
Concerned for your friends?Ha, ha, ha!

470
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,137
我也要拿走地图,请
And I'll take the map too, please.

471
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,774
等等,你怎会知道有...
Wait, how do you know there's a...

472
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,530
他们逼供成招的!
Well, they tortured it out of me!

473
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,974
地图给我!
Give me that map!

474
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,208
-请!
-等我死掉再说!
- Please!- Over my dead body!

475
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,013
山姆,拿出大蒜奶油来!
Sam, get out the garlic butter!

476
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,574
我觉得有点儿嘴馋
I'm feeling a little peckish.

477
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,019
你吹牛
You're bluffing.

478
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,291
试试看呀,你这无骨的粘液!
Try me, you spineless slime-spreader!

479
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,569
少惹他!
Leave him alone!

480
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,617
地图拿去吧
Take the map.

481
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,095
你真是卑鄙的恶魔!
You're a despicable fiend!

482
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,450
我知道,哈哈哈
那是天生的,真的
I know, ha, ha, ha. It's a gift, really.

483
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,140
同情是天大的弱点
Compassion is such a weakness.

484
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,410
抱歉我们无法留下来
不过你们知道情形的
Sorry we can't stay but you know how it is.

485
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,090
一统万民,冰冻天下
- People to rule, places to freeze.- Hup, hup, hup!

486
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,780
快点,智障
我们得毁掉这座桥!
Come on, imbecile,we have to destroy the bridge!

487
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,533
再见了,废物们!
So long, suckers!

488
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,612
等一下
Hold up.

489
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,858
干的好,士兵!
Good work, soldier!

490
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,016
孺子可教也
There's hope for you yet.

491
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,937
谢谢你,长官!
Thank you, sir!

492
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,334
好险!
Cor!

493
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:45,056
老天,他们不像以前那样
铺设碎石子步道
Man, they don't make crumbling rock causeways like they used to.

494
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,536
还有机会...像是长回来吗?
Is there any chance it will, like, grow back?

495
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,731
至少我们平安且暖和
At least we'll be nice and warm.

496
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,818
悲剧啊! 我们死定了!
Oh, tragedy! We're doomed!

497
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,011
我才正要大大扬名呢
And just as I was about to make it big.

498
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,813
-你是很大呀
-谢了,嘟狗
- You are big.- Thank you, Dougal.

499
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,569
但我希望我的事业高峰
不会到这火山峰为止
But I was hoping the peak of a volcano wouldn't be the pinnacle of my career.

500
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,488
大伙冷静点
我藏了样东西可能有帮助
Chill out, guys. I've got something stashed that just might help.

501
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,817
狄伦,我们没空用娱乐活动来实验
Dylan, we don't have time to experiment with recreational activities.

502
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,172
齐比迪的魔法盒!
Zebedee's Magic Box!

503
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,813
当然!
Of course!

504
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,138
现在,只要我能弄懂
怎样操作这个东西
Now, if I could just get my head round how to work this thing.

505
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,216
齐比迪有给谁说明书吗?
Did Zebedee give anyone the instructions?

506
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,331
按下按钮就是!
Just press the button!

507
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,492
一艘船,好极了
A boat. Brilliant.

508
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,656
从这儿上船将会一帆风顺
It'll be plain sailing from here on in.

509
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,613
等一下! 我想到了
Wait! I've got it.

510
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,617
搭帐篷!
The tents!

511
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,617
他这回真的疯了
He's really lost it this time.

512
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,177
这种高温会令我的牛角弯曲!
Oh, this heat is making my horns curl!

513
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,938
我样子一定很难看
I must look a sight.

514
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,210
不,爱蜜楚,我认为你的样子...
Oh, no, Ermintrude. I think you look...

515
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,857
是这样子,我觉得你...
That is, I find you...

516
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,333
看起来...
Look...

517
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,169
万一我们无法逃离这里
我只想让你知道...
in case we don't make it out of here,I just want you to know that...

518
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,372
全体登船!
All aboard!

519
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,133
这太神奇了!
我以前从没到过这么高
This is amazing!I've never been this high before.

520
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,536
事实上,我以前从没离开过地面
我们在做什么呀?
In fact, I've never been off the groundbefore. What are we doing?

521
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,412
干的好,狄伦,用气球脱逃
Well done, Dylan. A balloon escape.

522
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,690
老天! 你真聪明
My! You are clever.

523
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,290
是在于高度重于态度,爱蜜楚
It's all about altitude over attitude,Ermindude.

524
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,651
抱歉一下,不过还是有个小小问题
Excuse me,but there's still one small problem.

525
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,817
我们不知道要往哪去
We have no idea where we're going.

526
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,773
布莱恩说的对
我们可能会飘浮好几年!
Brian's right.We could drift around for years!

527
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,653
或者我们可以跟在他们后头
Or we could just, like, follow them.

528
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,408
再快一点,山姆
你划的像个挤奶工人!
Faster, Sam. You row like a milkmaid!

529
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,098
别紧张,长官
Ease up, sir.

530
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,098
现在那些惹人厌的小偷
已经不碍事了,何必急呢?
Now those pesky thieves are out the way, what's the big rush?

531
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,496
山姆,想像一下
如果你等了一万年
Sam, imagine if you'd waited 10,000 years

532
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,497
回到你冰冻王国的家乡
to come home to your frozen kingdom,

533
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,408
结果却发现世界遍布
花朵、动物、阳光和...
only to find a world covered in flowers and animals and sunshine and...

534
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,613
还有树木、彩虹以及小兔子
And trees and rainbows and tiny little bunny rabbits.

535
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,732
闭上嘴巴划船吧
你这木头长舌男!
Shut up and row, you wooden windbag!

536
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,898
很快我就会拿到第二颗钻石了
Soon I will have the second diamond,

537
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,456
而那些进退不得的傻瓜
有的只有彼此...
and all those stranded simpletons will have is each other...

538
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,175
当作晚餐!
for dinner!

539
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,298
山姆,你毁了这一刻
Sam, you're ruining the moment.

540
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,217
对不起,长官
Sorry, sir.

541
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,092
那是银河(乳腺)吗,爱蜜楚?
Is that the Milky Way, Ermintrude?

542
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,418
布莱恩! 你不该问淑女
这么私人的问题!
Brian! You should never ask a lady anything so personal!

543
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,451
什么?
What?

544
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,496
星星是不是很美呀?
Aren't the stars beautiful?

545
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,610
好美
So beautiful.

546
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,015
你想不想成为他们其中之一呢?
Wouldn't you love to be one of them?

547
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,850
我愿不惜一切代价达成
I'd give anything.

548
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,778
你会成为一颗闪亮明星的
You'd make a wonderful star.

549
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,095
我敢说你说的没错
Oh, I dare say you're right.

550
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,609
如此晶莹剔透
So serene.

551
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,776
如此高高在上
So heavenly.

552
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,419
如此受人羡慕与崇拜
So admired and adored.

553
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,610
总是居高临下俯视着每个人
Always looking down on everyone.

554
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,528
没错!
Oooh, yes!

555
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,936
我们应该睡一下
We should get some sleep, man.

556
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,654
说真的,你光会想那件事吗?
Honestly,is that all you ever think about?

557
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,169
没错,只要我醒着的时候
Sure. Whenever I'm awake.

558
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,737
我睡不着
I can't sleep.

559
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,737
我太担心我的佛罗伦丝了
I'm too worried about my Florence.

560
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,816
她没有我好无助
She's so helpless without me.

561
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,612
她一定吓呆了
She must be petrified.

562
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,049
宠物? 炒炸?
Pets? Fried?

563
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,171
坏宿命
Bad karma.

564
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,575
没错,我安抚她
Exactly. I calm her down.

565
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,095
事实是,我愿为她做任何事
The truth is, I do everything for her.

566
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,814
没有我,她的生命会相当空虚
Her life would be quite empty without me there.

567
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,456
别烤金仓鼠,老弟
Whoa...Don't toast the hamsters, dude.

568
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,619
在可怕的雷雨交加期间
她坚持要我爬上床跟她一起睡...
During scary thunderstorms,she insists I climb into bed with her...

569
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,537
保护她
for her protection.

570
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,969
她喜欢抛网球
And she just loves to throw a tennis ball.

571
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,772
谁会去帮她捡回来
Who's always there to bring it back

572
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,335
好让她有再抛一次的乐趣呢?
so she can have the pleasure of throwing it again?

573
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,212
我告诉你,狄伦
I'm telling you, Dylan.

574
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,217
我敢打赌她真的很怀念那事
I bet she really misses that.

575
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,368
真的真的真的很怀念
Really, really, really missing that.

576
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,011
佛罗伦丝?
Florence?

577
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,937
佛罗伦丝!
Florence!

578
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,369
"蓝天先生"
Mr Blue Sky

579
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,892
"艳阳高照"
Sun is shinin' in the sky

580
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,815
"万里无云"
There ain't a cloud in sight

581
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,737
"雨过天青"
It's stopped rainin'

582
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,771
"人人在嬉戏"
Everybody's in a play

583
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,859
"你不明白这是美丽的新日子吗?"
And don't you know
it's a beautiful new day

584
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,811
"嘿-嘿-嘿"
Hey-ey-ey

585
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,534
"沿着大街奔跑"
Runnin' down the avenue

586
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,138
"看看阳光多么闪耀灿烂"
See how the sun shines brightly

587
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,295
"在城市里"
In the city

588
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,980
"在曾经荒芜的街道上"
On the streets where once was pity

589
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,775
"蓝天先生今日居住在此"
Mr Blue Sky is living here today

590
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,731
"嘿-嘿-嘿"
Hey-ey-ey

591
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,498
"蓝天先生"
Mr Blue Sky

592
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,814
"请告诉我们为什么"
Please tell us why

593
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,491
"你必须躲藏了那么久"
"那么久"
You had to hide away for so long.So long

594
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,531
"我们哪里做错了呢?"
Where did we go wrong?

595
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,132
"蓝天先生,你做的对"
Mr Blue, you did it right

596
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,690
"但夜晚先生就快到来"
But soon comes Mr Night

597
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,210
"悄悄地笼罩大地
如今他的手正在你的肩上"
Creepin' over,Now his hand is on your shoulder

598
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,491
"算了,我会这样子记住你的"
Never mind,I'll remember you this way

599
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,815
"我会这样子记住你的"
I'll remember you this way

600
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,259
"蓝天先生"
Mr Blue Sky

601
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,733
"请告诉我们为什么"
Please tell us why

602
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,932
"你必须躲藏了那么久"
You had to hide away for so long

603
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,095
"那么久"
So long

604
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,495
"我们哪里做错了呢?"
Where did we go wrong?

605
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,018
嘿,热带风情!
Hey, man. Tropical vibes!

606
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,415
可是你看,上面有冰覆盖着
But look, there's ice up ahead.

607
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,896
-哪里?
-肯定有奇怪的事情发生
- Where?- Something strange is definitely afoot.

608
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,931
对,肯定是只大脚
Yeah, it's definitely a foot.

609
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,972
好的,各位,准备降落
OK, everybody, prepare to land.

610
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,291
应该不远了
Can't be far now.

611
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,496
绝对是这处地方
This is definitely the place.

612
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,418
进去吧
- Let's press on.- Ow!

613
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,371
等一下,长官
Hold up, sir.

614
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,296
我先,长官! 可能很危险
我具有第六感...
After me, sir. It could be dangerous,and I've got a sixth sense for...

615
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,457
集中精神在其它五感上吧
Try concentrating on the other five

616
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,411
不然你可能会人头不保
and you might not lose your head.

617
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,929
这里有什么呢?
Now, what do we have here?

618
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,249
啊哈!
Aha!

619
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,059
这整个地方机关重重
The whole place is booby-trapped.

620
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,419
那我们怎么办,老大?
So, what do we do now, boss?

621
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,690
降落喽!
Land ho!

622
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,571
谢天谢地! 我等不及...
Thank goodness! I can't wait

623
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,531
体会脚踏实地的感觉
to feel earth beneath my hooves.

624
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,855
知道怎么降落这个东西吗?
Any idea how we can land this thing?

625
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,811
他们还活着!
They're still alive!

626
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,293
不会吧!
Well, boil my busby!

627
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,969
无所谓,所有的笨机关
需要一群呆子试闯
No matter. All that booby traps require are a bunch of boobies.

628
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,979
先让他们清除机关
我们再尾随进入
We'll let them clear the way,then we can just stroll in.

629
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,016
来吧!
- Come on!- Oh!

630
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,811
再低一点,再低一点
Lower, lower.

631
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,617
空间很大! 再低一点
Loads of room! Lower.

632
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,412
到站...
Here comes a...

633
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,576
-...了!
-平坦安稳的...
- Stop!-...nice smooth...

634
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,489
...坠毁
...crash.

635
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,533
刚好来得及吃午餐
Just in time for lunch.

636
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,850
看样子你在菜单上了
And it looks like you're on the menu.

637
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,936
不知道齐贝在哪里
I wonder where Zeebad is.

638
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,938
我们必定追上他了
做的不错,火车!
We must have overtaken him.Nice one, Train!

639
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,129
这没什么,兔子
No worries, Rabbit.

640
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,455
在这等着,保持待命状态
Wait here and keep your pistons pumping.

641
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,093
我们可能需要火速逃离
We may need to make a quick getaway.

642
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,688
嘿,我们速去速回吧
Hey, let's make itreally quick and go now.

643
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,054
不知道这些符号表示什么
I wonder what these symbols mean.

644
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,570
可能相当于古代的欢迎物... 喔!
It's probably the ancient equivalent of a welcome mat... Oh!

645
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,816
哦,我怎么这样没礼貌?
Oh, where are my manners?

646
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,534
-女士优先
-不,你先请
- Ladies first.- No, after you.

647
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,412
老人优先,亲爱的
Age before beauty, dear.

648
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,849
看在老天份上,我去吧
Oh, for heaven's sake, I'll go.

649
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,540
表情别这么惊讶,爱蜜楚
Don't look so shell-shocked,Ermintrude.

650
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,220
我或许慢吞吞
不过还是可以带头的
I may be slow,but I can still take the lead.

651
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,898
跟着我的足迹走吧
Just follow my trail.

652
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,976
看看谁在开始长脊骨呀
Well, look who's beginning to grow a spine.

653
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,216
脊骨? 你说“脊骨”是啥意思?
Spine? What do you mean "spine"?

654
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,217
打架我可是都冲第一名唷!
I'm always the first into the fray!

655
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,571
那些懒惰虫
这里就我任何事都肯做!
Those lazy tykes. I'm the only one who does anything around here!

656
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,418
老是“布莱恩做这个,布莱恩做那个”
It's "Brian do this, Brian do that."

657
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,417
“是,长官! 不,长官!
满满三袋,长官”
"Yes, sir. No, sir. Three bags full, sir."

658
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,212
他们待我像奴隶一般!
They treat me like a slave!

659
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,251
真是耻辱
“我的糖呢?”
It's a disgrace. "Where's my sugar?"

660
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,689
“我的草呢?”
他们一定以为我好欺负
"Where's my grass?"They must think I'm a soft touch.

661
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,617
但我总是爬回去
But I always go crawling back.

662
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,015
快过来吧,都安全了
Well, come on, it's all clear.

663
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,053
我们走
Let's go.

664
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:46,371
从没想到我会这么说,不过...
好个蜗牛呀!
I never thought I'd say this but...what a snail!

665
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,219
好的,在这儿等
他们是这么吩咐的,等
OK, wait here. That's what they said.Wait.

666
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,497
我不喜欢这样
I-I don't like this.

667
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,178
我不喜欢这样
I don't like this.

668
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,258
什么东西? 我要进入隧道
我是火车,我喜欢隧道
What's this? I'll go into the tunnel.I'm a train. I like tunnels.

669
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,610
我会在这里等,就是那样,对
I'll wait here, that's it, yeah.

670
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,696
我会等...
I'll wait just...

671
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,214
喂!
- Hey!- Who!

672
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,171
有人找到钻石吗?
Anyone find the diamonds?

673
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,258
哦,嘟狗
难道你不知道兔子有点神经质吗?
Oh, Doog, man. Don't you know rabbits are kind of jumpy?

674
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,132
我没看到任何线索呀
I don't see any clues.

675
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,935
我们一定找错地方了
We must be in the wrong place.

676
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:33,417
宝座...
享受我最后口香糖之最佳地方
Oooh, a throne - the perfect place to enjoy my last gobstopper.

677
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,136
太棒了,扶手按钮!
Oh, great, a recline button!

678
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,129
钻石!
The diamond!

679
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,259
好酷的炫光秀
Cool light show, man.

680
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,974
哈,美丽的雷射光
Hello, pretty lasers.

681
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,328
不!
No-ooo!

682
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,893
那是警报光束!
They're alarm beams!

683
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,818
得有人穿过去取钻石
Someone has to get through to the diamond.

684
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,738
-我毛太多了
-我会发抖
- Well, I'm too hairy.- I've got the shakes.

685
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,976
看在莫札特的份上,我来!
Oh, for the love of Mozart, I'll do it!

686
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,409
我受过芭蕾舞训练,你们知道的
I trained as a ballerina, you know.

687
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,417
我的天鹅湖乃众人津津乐道...
My Swan Lake was the talk of...

688
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,249
少说些有的没的,快救我们出去!
Stop milking the moment and get me out of here!

689
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,213
漂亮! 真是超...
Well done! That was bril...

690
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,092
不!
No-oooo!

691
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,779
我想没人懂得武功吧?
I don't suppose anyone knows anything about martial arts?

692
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:40,058
只是一些基本的,像是功夫
空手道、柔道、剑道、跆拳道
Just the basics of, like, kung fu, karate,judo, kendo, tae kwon do,

693
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,819
样样都会道,以及...太极拳
anything-you-can-do and...t'ai chi.

694
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,090
有附蛋炒饭吗?
Oooh!Do they come with egg fried rice?

695
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,734
狄伦...你能打倒他们吗?
Dylan...can you beat them up?

696
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,294
对不起,我不崇尚暴力
Sorry, I don't believe in violence.

697
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,731
自卫例外
Except in self-defence.

698
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:09,335
老天! 那才叫我所谓的振作起来
Oh, man! That's what I call pulling yourself together.

699
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,009
呀! 呀!
Ya! Ya!

700
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,932
-放马过来吧,老兄
-狄伦!
- Wa! Ta! Come on, man.- Dylan!

701
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,850
我不光有漂亮脸蛋而已!
I'm not just another pretty face!

702
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,128
精彩的团队合作
马上取走钻石离开吧
Good group effort. Now, let's grab the diamond and head off.

703
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,297
我是火车,我有汽笛
I'm a train, I have a whistle.

704
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,214
这底下好暗
幸好我有隧道照明,嘻嘻!
It's dark down here.Lucky I have tunnel vision, hee, hee!

705
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,734
超大引擎、合金轮子...
Big engine, alloy wheels...

706
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,699
我可绝对不想落到那付下场
You wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of that.

707
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,772
所以...
So...

708
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:25,169
传说中的英勇战士
已经来取钻石了!
The fearless warrior of legendhas come to claim the diamond!

709
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,339
不完全是
英勇战士今天没办法来
Erm, no actually, the fearless warrior couldn't make it today,

710
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,939
所以换我们代替
so we came instead.

711
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,290
我们回家途中会交给他的
Er, we'll drop it in to him on the way home.

712
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,652
听着,你到底要不要钻石?
Look, do you want the diamond or don't you?

713
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,578
如果你是在提议的话...是的,请!
Er, well, if you're offering...yes, please!

714
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,452
我想到个更好的主意
I've got a better idea.

715
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,298
我们扑上去吧!
Let's jump him!

716
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,015
冲啊...
Chaaaaaa...

717
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,219
只是想想而已啦
It was just a thought.

718
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,729
要不然就...溜之大吉!
How about...run away!

719
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,373
糟糕!
Oh, no!

720
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,735
救命呀!
He-He-Help!

721
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,373
救命!
Help!

722
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,537
应该是狗啃骨头
不是骨头啃狗!
Dogs are meant to eat bones,not the other way around!

723
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,930
脑筋转的真快,嘟狗
That was quick thinking, Dougal.

724
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,891
是啊,只要你保持镇静
Yeah, well, if you keep your cool

725
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,012
别像只无头苍蝇到处晃...
没时间聊天了
and don't run around like a headless chicken... No time for chitchat.

726
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,938
我们拿了钻石就离开吧
Let's grab that diamond and get out.

727
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,455
不见了!
It's gone!

728
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:54,258
一群傻瓜! 在找这个吗?
Fools! Looking for this?

729
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,058
你最近就是站不稳
You just can't get the staff these days.

730
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,690
现在,要告诉我第三颗钻石在哪吗?
Now, do you want to tell me where the third diamond is?

731
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,094
甭想
Nope.

732
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,450
反抗无益!
Resistance is futile!

733
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,299
你们不是伟大齐贝的对手!
You're no match for the great Zeebad!

734
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,739
骄者必败
Pride comes before a fall.

735
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,373
嘟狗! 现在!
Dougal! Now!

736
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,330
万岁!
那是见最后一面了
Hooray!That's the last we'll see of them.

737
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,218
他会丢脸丢死了!
That took him down a peg or ten!

738
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,855
对,只不过你刚刚冲掉了
一号钻石和二号钻石
Yeah, man, except you just flushedaway diamonds one and two.

739
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,289
那...我们现在要去哪?
So...where do we go now?

740
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,298
我们得尽快赶回旋转木马那里
We must get back to the Roundaboutas fast as we can.

741
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,615
我知道好比“祸害遗千年”
I know there's like,"no rest for the wicked",

742
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,289
不过我是好人
此刻我需要睡个午觉
but I'm one of the good guys and right now I need a siesta.

743
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,853
看!
Look!

744
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,857
声音! 我就知道他们会来救我
Voices! I knew they'd come to rescue me.

745
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,858
等等,也许应该由我去救他们
Hang on, maybe I'm supposed to be rescuing them.

746
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,858
嘿,听起来好熟悉
Hey, that sound's familiar.

747
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,097
典型的火车声
总是在绝望时出现
Typical train. Always turns up when you least expect it.

748
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,734
各位快点,走了
Come on, gang. In we go.

749
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,453
哦,不
Oh, no.

750
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,211
好,我们离开这儿吧
Right, now, let's get out of here.

751
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,900
开慢点,你令我的乳汁翻搅
Oh, do slow down,you're making my milk churn.

752
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,488
你在说笑吗?
我们慢得跟蜗牛似的!
Are you kidding?We're moving at a snail's pace!

753
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,053
慢得跟蜗牛刚好适合我
Snail's pace suits me just fine.

754
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,535
哦,爱蜜楚!
Oh, Ermintrude!

755
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,651
那是你说过最窝心的话
That's the sweetest thing you've ever said.

756
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,452
放松点,嘟狗
Relax, Doogie.

757
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,253
不久这整个疯狂之旅
将会抛到我们脑后
Soon this whole crazy trip will be behind us.

758
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,098
在我们后面!
Behind us!

759
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,132
-我就是这意思
-不! 在我们后面!
- That's what I said, man.- No! Behind us!

760
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,858
快一点! 再快一点!
Faster! Faster!

761
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,929
低头!
Duck!

762
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,416
我一直想当云霄飞车!
I always wanted to be a roller coaster!

763
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,574
哇,兄弟!
Whoa, dudes!

764
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,418
谈谈差点进鬼门关的经验吧
Talk about a near-death experience.

765
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,610
我想我看到隧道尽头有光芒
I thought I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.

766
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,413
这正是隧道尽头的光芒!
That is the light at the end of the tunnel!

767
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,212
我们就快脱险了!
We're going to be OK!

768
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,729
而齐贝依然困在神殿里!
And Zeebad's still trapped in the temple!

769
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,013
那么那是谁?
他的邪恶双胞胎齐贝德吗?
Then, like, who's that,his evil twin, Zeebadder?

770
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,613
我的第三颗钻石在哪里?
Where's my third diamond?

771
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:22,892
锅炉,现在别输掉!
Whoa! Furnace, don't fail me now!

772
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,090
大家抓稳了!
Brace yourself, everybody!

773
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,336
注意断轨!
Whoa! Mind the gap!

774
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,209
嘿!
Hey!

775
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,936
大鼻子来也!
Here comes big nose!

776
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,533
谁快想想办法!
Somebody do something!

777
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:01,212
嘿,这一定是某种反跳跃装置
Hey, this must be some kinda anti-spring device.

778
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,535
-这会教齐贝慢下来
-真的?
- This'll slow Zeebad down.- Really?

779
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,333
也可能是弹跳座椅
- Aaaagh!- Or it could be an ejector seat.

780
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,929
那究竟是啥声音?
What the devil was that?

781
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,096
发生什么事? 我为何瞎了?
What happened? Why am I blind?

782
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,017
我们到达旋转木马了吗?
Did we reach the Roundabout yet?

783
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,693
原来我们要往那里!
So that's where you're headed!

784
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,935
旋转木马!
The Roundabout!

785
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:24,689
在那里就可找到我的钻石了!
And that's where I'll find my diamond!

786
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,539
再见了,粘球!
So long, slimeball!

787
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:34,177
山姆,上去车顶除掉囚犯
Sam, get up on the roof and dispose of the prisoner.

788
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,813
除掉囚犯?
Dispose of a prisoner?

789
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,090
不能那么做,长官
那样违反日内瓦公约
Can't do that, sir. Geneva Convention.

790
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,609
你猜怎样? 我管它公不公约!
Guess what? I'm unconventional!

791
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,656
管它公不公约,哈哈哈!
Un-con-ventional. Ha, ha, ha!

792
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,372
斩断他的头!
Off with his head!

793
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,616
啊! 救命呀!
Aaaargh! He-eeelp!

794
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,219
布莱恩!
Brian!

795
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:04,132
-欢迎上车!
-爱蜜楚,你救了我!
- Welcome aboard!- Ermintrude, you saved me!

796
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,534
别想穿越我
你这花枝招展的开罐器!
Don't cross me,you tarted-up tin opener!

797
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,776
快一点,你这百合肝叛徒!
Faster, you lily-livered traitor!

798
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,538
我要抢到那颗钻石!
I want that diamond!

799
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,332
多加点煤炭!
More coal!

800
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,693
哦! 不!
Oh! No!

801
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,731
前面轨道合并!
Trouble dead ahead!

802
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,139
那是我的轨道!
That's my line!

803
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:34,897
这就是你们不让路的结果!
Now, this is what happens when you don't brush regularly!

804
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,129
长官! 压力...过高!
Sir! The pressure - it's too much!

805
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,057
我知道,我知道!
I know, I know!

806
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:49,173
有时候我觉得
我要大发神经了!
Sometimes I feel I'm going quite insane!

807
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,972
不,长官,是锅炉!
No, sir, it's the boiler!

808
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,089
是...
It's...

809
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,409
谢天谢地! 我们安全了!
Thank goodness! We're safe!

810
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,371
我称那爆炸为蒸汽烟火!
I call that letting off steam!

811
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,649
哇!
- Hurrah!- Whoa!

812
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,654
我能飞了!
I can fly-y-y!

813
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,889
不,我不能
No, I can't.

814
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,932
今天一天已经飞够了!
Oh, that's enough flying for one day!

815
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,972
我们得比齐贝早一步
赶到旋转木马
We've got to get to the Round about before Zeebad.

816
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:24,369
等等,齐贝并不知道
钻石在旋转木马那儿
Hang on, Zeebad doesn't know the diamond's at the Roundabout.

817
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,889
严格说来并不正确...
Erm... Well, that's not strictly true...

818
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,533
那时候,在火车上...
Back there, on the Train...

819
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,891
我一时糊涂就...
就脱口而出了
I-I was confused and it...it just slipped out.

820
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,169
布莱恩,老兄!
Brian, man!

821
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,530
话已覆水难收
Well there's no use crying over spilt milk.

822
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,537
你说的倒轻松
That's easy for you to say.

823
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,457
大家快点,上火车!
Come on, people. To the Train!

824
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,337
看样子火车已经停驶了
Whoa. Looks like this service has been cancelled.

825
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,893
-你不要紧吧?
-嗯
- Are you all right?- Yeah.

826
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,578
可能要误点了
Delays look likely.

827
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,452
我想我已拉了活塞
I think I've pulled a piston.

828
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,935
不,不会这样子的
Ow! Nope, it's not gonna happen.

829
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,778
可怜的小火车!
Oh, poor Trainy!

830
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,095
太阳快下山了
Oh, the sun's setting.

831
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,939
只好靠我们自己力量去办了
We'll just have to make it under our own steam.

832
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,415
暂别了,老弟
Goodbye for now, old buddy.

833
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,298
你能办到的
You can make it.

834
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,819
跟着我们的足迹走
Just follow our tracks.

835
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,250
别担心我
你们走吧,去找出钻石
Don't worry about me.You go on, find the diamond.

836
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,858
再想一想... 我怎么办?
On second thoughts... What about me?

837
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,457
烂机器!
Wretched machines!

838
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,378
我一定要赶到旋转木马,趁...
I must reach the Roundabout before...

839
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,933
长官!
Ooh, sir!

840
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,618
我需要医疗
Medic needed.

841
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,618
SOS,求救...
SOS. Mayday. Oooh...

842
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,458
我? 救你?
Me? Help you?

843
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:38,812
你这软弱无能的迪斯可娃娃!
You treacherou mollusc-sparing disco dolly!

844
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,295
你的职责到此结束
Your tour of duty is over.

845
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,809
你不能遗弃伤兵,长官
You can't leave an injured soldier, sir.

846
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,134
不能吗?
Can't I?

847
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,171
那就等着瞧吧
Just watch me.

848
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,533
等一下!
Wait!

849
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,616
回来!
Come back!

850
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,251
邪恶坏蛋...真够狠心的
Evil villains...can be so cruel.

851
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,253
我走不动了
I can't go on.

852
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,530
我们已经走好几个小时了
We've been walking for hours.

853
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,935
好冷...
It's so c-c-cold.

854
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,449
我手脚都没知觉了
I can't feel my limb.

855
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,649
可是佛罗伦丝...还有孩子们
But Florence...and the children.

856
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:22,011
如果我们不及早赶到
他们会冻成冰棒的
If we don't get there soon,they'll be frozen stiff.

857
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,608
哦,时间无情之手!
Oh, the cruel hands of time!

858
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:30,292
但要不是...要不是时间
一切会像是,瞬间发生
But if it... if it wasn't for time,everything would, like, happen at once.

859
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:33,253
等等,那是什么?
Wait. What's that?

860
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,809
脚印! 也许会带我们回村子里去
Footprints! Maybe they'll lead us back to the village.

861
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,809
可是,好像,有哪种古怪生物
会留下这些脚印?
But, like, what kinda freaky creatures would leave prints like these?

862
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,010
他们一定也是累毙了
They must be exhausted too.

863
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:50,213
其中一个好像用爬的爬过地面
One of them seems to be crawling along the ground.

864
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,854
我比较喜欢称为“滑过”
I prefer the term gliding.

865
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,016
不! 那是我们的脚印!
Oh, no! They're ours!

866
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,619
哦,不!
Oh, no!

867
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,537
不,不!
No, no!

868
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:04,292
就这样了,该好好睡上一觉了
Well, that's it, man.It's time for the big sleep.

869
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,217
我们尽力了
We did our best.

870
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,537
但我们的尽力还不够好...
But our best wasn't good enough. Oh...

871
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,616
哦,曲终人散
Oh, it's the final curtain.

872
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,849
不,千万不可睡着
No. We mustn't sleep.

873
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,891
太冷了
It's too cold.

874
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,577
太冷了
It's too cold.

875
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,531
我们千万不可...
We mustn't...

876
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,537
佛罗伦丝...
Florence...

877
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,653
嘟狗!
Doooougaaaal!

878
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,732
-嘟狗?
-佛罗伦丝! 你没事!
- Dougal?- Florence! You're OK!

879
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,930
比没事还要好
I'm more than OK.

880
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:00,018
我甜蜜无比
I'm swee-eeet.

881
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,810
但旋转木马呢?
But what about the Roundabout?

882
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,852
孩子们呢? 冻的缩成一团
The children? Huddled. Freezing.

883
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,333
别担心,嘟狗
Don't worry, Dougal.

884
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,212
你现在跟我在一起...
You're with me now...

885
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:13,015
在糖果天堂!
in sugar paradise!

886
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:18,575
你看,糖果要给我的小乖,嘟狗
Look. Sweets for my sweet Dougal.

887
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:27,933
喜欢吃多少就吃多少!
And you can eat as much as you like!

888
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,730
不,这样不对!我一定是疯了
N-No, this isn't right!I must be going nuts.

889
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,579
我得醒来,拯救佛罗伦丝
I have to wake up. Save Florence.

890
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,338
佛罗伦丝!
Florence!

891
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,575
不!
No!

892
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,531
只是一场梦
It was just a dream.

893
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,857
佛罗伦丝!
Florence!

894
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,133
佛罗伦丝!
Flore-eeeeence!

895
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,334
快醒醒!
Come on. Wake up!

896
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,291
醒醒! 醒醒!
Wake up! Wake up!

897
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:19,096
不行,我意识陷入高度恍惚状态
No way, man. I'm in a higher state
of unconsciousness.

898
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,735
天越来越亮了 我们却还完全迷失方向
It's getting light and we're still completely lost.

899
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,657
我不太确定我们是这样
I'm not so sure we are.

900
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:31,408
哇,真是严重的梦游
Whoa, that was some
serious sleepwalking.

901
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,298
看!
Look!

902
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,933
看,看,看!
Look, look, look!

903
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,369
快! 来看一下!看看那个!
Quick! Come and have a look!Look at that!

904
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,331
真的和我想的是一样吗?
Is that really what I think it is?

905
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,337
家?
Home?

906
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,015
诅咒!
Curses!

907
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,654
钻石一定在这里哪个地方!
The diamond
must be here somewhere!

908
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,133
齐贝!
Zeebad!

909
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,579
你!
You!

910
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,498
这旋转木马不够大容不下我们两个!
This roundabout ain't big enough for the both of us!

911
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:04,933
当我留下某人等死时就是指望对方死掉
When I leave someone for dead,I expect them to die.

912
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,494
你就不能乖乖死掉吗?
Can't you even do that right? Eh?

913
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,737
自从我离开旋转木马后还没做对过半样事
Oh, I haven't done anything right since I left the Roundabout.

914
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:13,090
现在是我重整旗鼓的时候了
Now it's time for me
to resume my post.

915
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,814
你? 你本来在旋转木马上面?
You? You were on the Roundabout?

916
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,339
对,我是
Yeah, I was.

917
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,132
阻挡住像你这种人
Guarding it from the likes of you.

918
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,091
哈! 瞧你这付模样!
Ha! Look at the state of you!

919
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,290
连颗水煮蛋都守不住了!
You couldn't guard a boiled egg!

920
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,139
我可能已受到损坏
Well, I might have taken a battering,

921
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,091
不过就像齐比迪跟我说的:
but it's like Zebedee told me:

922
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:30,336
心里想什么才重要!
it's what's inside that counts!

923
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,894
冲呀!
Chaaaaarge!

924
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,979
钻石!
The diamond!

925
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,491
齐比迪,你这狡猾的家伙
Oooh, Zebedee, you cunning swine.

926
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:57,933
再想一下,我留你自生自灭
差点就抛弃了钻石
And to think, I nearly abandoned it when I left you to die.

927
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,733
真是讽刺!
Ooh, the irony!

928
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:05,888
现在,该来天寒地冻了!
Now, time for the big chill!

929
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,056
这不可能是我们的村子
This can't be our village.

930
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,738
我一样都不认得了
I don't recognise a thing.

931
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:19,818
对,好像,也许我们转错弯了,嘟狗
Yeah, like, maybe we took a wrong turn, Doog.

932
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,010
不,不,绝对是这里
No, no, this is definitely it.

933
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,495
只要我们经过这个白色东东
If we go past this white thingy

934
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,417
再经过这个白色的...
and by this white bit...

935
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,849
转角过去应该就是...
just round the corner should be the...

936
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,249
哦,不!
Oh, no!

937
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,850
哈哈哈!
Ha, ha, ha!

938
01:02:58,740 --> 01:02:59,855
齐贝!
Zeebad!

939
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,011
完美极了!
Ah, perfect!

940
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:06,337
你们刚好赶上最后一幕
You've arrived just in time for the finale.

941
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:09,133
再见了,阳光!
So long, sunshine!

942
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,057
佛罗伦丝!
Florence!

943
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,651
哦,佛罗伦丝!
Oh, Florence!

944
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:38,932
不,不,不,不,不!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

945
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,732
全是我的错
This is all my fault.

946
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,933
如果我没那么贪吃、愚蠢
If only I hadn't been so greedy and stupid.

947
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:49,459
那么再会了,狄伦
再见,亲爱的布莱恩
Farewell, then, Dylan.Goodbye, dear Brian.

948
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:53,095
爱蜜楚,在我们结冻之前
Er...Ermintrude, before we freeze,

949
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:56,815
有件事我一直想告诉你...
there's something I've been t-trying to t-tell you...

950
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:07,691
这家伙严重扰乱我的宿命!
This guy is seriously messing with my karma!

951
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:16,136
吃这个吧
你这弹跳的恶作剧盒玩具!
Eat this,you jumped-up jack-in-the-box! Ya!

952
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:21,099
你就是不明白你被打败了,对不对?
Ooof! You just don't know when you're beaten, do you?

953
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,890
吃颗寒气丸吧,兔子!
Take a chill pill, rabbit!

954
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,530
等一下,就是那样!
Wait a minute. That's it!

955
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,732
爱蜜楚,唱歌!
能唱多大声就唱多大声!
Ermintrude, sing!Sing as loud as you can!

956
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,853
我不习惯在这种情况下演唱!
I'm not used to working under these conditions!

957
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,811
嘟狗可能想到了什么法子
Dougal might be onto something.

958
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,579
对! 爱蜜楚! 快唱!
Yes! Ermintrude! Sing!

959
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,611
我还没暖嗓呢!
I haven't even warmed up!

960
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,776
爱蜜楚! 快唱!
Ermintrude! Sing!

961
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,058
好啦
Fine.

962
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,929
那是什么讨厌的噪音啊?
What is that abominable noise?

963
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,013
装填弹药!
Shell loaded!

964
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,169
吃这招吧!
Take this!

965
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,653
快逃!
Run!

966
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,812
准备好没? 瞄准,发射!
Ready? Aim. Fire!

967
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,978
漂亮!
Well done!

968
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:49,378
狄伦,往你那边去了!
Dylan, it's coming your way!

969
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:53,459
哇,这一撞可不轻!
Whoa, that was some hit!

970
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,690
哇! 棒透了!
Whoa! Psy-che-delic!

971
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,016
我来挥棒
I got it, man.

972
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:09,729
不!
No!

973
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,132
给我! 给我!
Over to me! Over to me!

974
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,728
不! 是我的! 我的! 哈哈!
No! It's mine! Mine! Ha, ha!

975
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,049
二比零!
Two-nil!

976
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,535
比赛还没结束呢
The game's not over yet.

977
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,737
接的好,齐贝!
Oooh, nice catch, Zeebad!

978
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,498
现在来抢最后的...
Now let's get the final...

979
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,609
钻石!
diamond!

980
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,332
敢碰它你就死定了
Touch it and you're toast.

981
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,338
你吓不倒我!
你只是个蓝色大混蛋
You don't scare me!You're just a big, blue bully.

982
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,212
现在局势已逆转
Now the tables have turned

983
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,649
我们只需要
把最后这颗钻石放回...
and all we need do is put this last diamond back on...

984
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,097
全垒打出击!
Here comes a home run!

985
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,778
休想!
Not again!

986
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,258
胜利!
Victory!

987
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:08,256
就差这么一点...
So close and yet so...

988
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,177
太好了!
far out!

989
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:13,372
对一群呆子动物而言
做的还不错!
Nice try - for a bunch of dumb animals!

990
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,412
不过动物园关闭时间到了
But now it's closing time at the zoo.

991
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:20,738
用我们的秘密武器就不会
齐比迪的魔法盒!
Not with our secret weapon:Zebedee's magic box!

992
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:29,810
没有用!
- Huh?
- Ya!

993
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,894
现在齐比迪的玩具
也帮不了你们了
It d-doesn't work. Aw!

994
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,332
我回来了! 呀呼!
Bounce back from that, Slinky!Woo-hoo!

995
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,212
火车! 我就知道你办的到!
Train! I knew you'd make it!

996
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,331
-照时刻表行驶
-钻石!
- Bang on schedule.- The diamond!

997
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,859
我去拿
I'll get it.

998
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:55,097
我害大家淌这趟浑水
我要救大家出来
I got us into this mess and I'll get us out.

999
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,295
去呀,嘟狗
Go on, Dougal.

1000
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,456
不!
No-ooo-ooo!

1001
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:47,451
哈哈哈!
Mm-mm! Ha, ha, ha!

1002
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,371
成功了! 成功了!
We did it! We did it!

1003
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,855
成功了! 成功了!
We did it! We did it!

1004
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,659
快点!
Come on!

1005
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,573
干的好!
Well done!

1006
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,168
没什么能像歌剧一样能够破冰
There's nothing like opera
for breaking the ice.

1007
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:13,056
绿茵映眼帘!甜美苍翠的绿草!
I can see grass, man!Sweet, green grass!

1008
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,091
可是佛罗伦丝人呢?
But where's Florence?

1009
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,413
佛罗伦丝?
Florence?

1010
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,048
佛罗伦丝!
Florence!

1011
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,777
佛罗伦丝,能听见我吗?
Florence, can you hear me?

1012
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,652
拜你醒来
Please wake up.

1013
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:29,248
拜你醒来,别离开我
Please wake up. Don't leave me.

1014
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:31,530
没有你,这世界就毫无意义了!
This world means nothing without you!

1015
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,571
我很遗憾,老弟
Sorry, old buddy.

1016
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,259
不,不会的...
No, it can't...

1017
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:36,779
她不会的...
She can't...

1018
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,618
佛罗伦丝!
Florence!

1019
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,696
我可爱的佛罗伦丝!
My lovely Florence!

1020
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,694
她动了!
She moved!

1021
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,374
她还活着!
She's alive!

1022
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,697
哦,佛罗伦丝!
我以为我永远失去你了!
Oh, Florence!I thought I'd lost you forever!

1023
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,811
我也以为我失去你了,嘟狗
And I thought I'd lost you too, Dougal.

1024
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:05,056
但你救了我的命
But you saved my life.

1025
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,772
还有大家的命
And everyone else's.

1026
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,458
别说了
Oh, stop it.

1027
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:10,810
任何超级英雄狗都会这么做的
It's what any incredibly heroic dog would do.

1028
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,696
那么你不想要一份...
So you don't want a...

1029
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,333
小小的奖赏吗?
little reward?

1030
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,052
不用,我已经学乖了
Oh, no. I've learnt my lesson.

1031
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,410
我再也不跟棒棒糖扯上关系了
I'm not having anything more to do with lollipops.

1032
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:21,859
或口香糖
Or gobstoppers.

1033
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:23,208
或太妃糖
Or toffees.

1034
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:27,335
等一下,齐比迪到哪去了?
But wait, where's Zebedee?

1035
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:32,688
齐比迪!
Zebedee!

1036
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:35,857
好极了,我的朋友们
我一直明白你们能办到!
Bravo, my friends.I always knew you could do it!

1037
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,413
但我们以为你死了!
But we thought you were dead!

1038
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,337
死了? 胡说,嘟狗!
Dead? Nonsense, Dougal!

1039
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:43,612
人人都知道冬天过后
就是春天!
Everyone knows that after winter it's time for spring!

1040
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,648
大家快点来坐旋转木马吧!
Come on, everyone.To the Roundabout!

1041
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,617
哦,不!
Oh, no!

1042
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,378
为什么不动?
How come it's not moving?

1043
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,536
好像卡住了
It's like stuck, man.

1044
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,218
旋转木马怎么了?
What's wrong with the Roundabout?

1045
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:10,853
齐比迪?
Zebedee?

1046
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,254
你们不记得了吗?
Don't you remember?

1047
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,689
旋转木马还缺了一样东西
The Roundabout's still missing something.

1048
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:17,459
或者该说...缺了一个人
Or should I say... someone?

1049
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:24,138
山姆?
Sam?

1050
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,057
但那是齐贝的心腹!
But that's Zeebad's henchman!

1051
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,738
他折磨我!
He tortured me!

1052
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,935
别太苛责他
Don't be too hard on him.

1053
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:35,133
山姆也是齐贝
疯狂魔法下的受害者
Sam too was a victim of Zeebad's maniacal magic.

1054
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,770
该回去你原来的地方了,山姆
It's time for you to return where you belong, Sam.

1055
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,971

1061
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,577
鹿蹄也很适合!
With matching hooves!

01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,491
嘟狗?
- Dougal?- Huh?

1063
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:36,657
