1
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,229
Argh!

2
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,751
Ugh! Aaargh!

3
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,033
Aaaaargh!

4
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,116
Zeebad!

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,875
Only a bad dream.

6
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,992
Everything seems fine.

7
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,751
# Magic

8
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,672
# Oh, ho, ho, it's magic

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,989
# You know

10
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,319
# Never believe it's not so

11
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,271
# It's magic

12
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,073
# You know

13
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,868
# Never believe it's not so

14
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,790
# Never been awake

15
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,717
# Never seen a day break

16
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,470
# Leaning on my pillow in the morning

17
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,830
# Lazy day in bed

18
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,315
# Music in my head

19
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,912
# Crazy music playing
in the morning light

20
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,271
# Oh, ho, ho, it's magic

21
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,599
# You know

22
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,429
# Never believe it's not so

23
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,391
# It's magic

24
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,159
# You know

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,994
# Never believe it's not so

26
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,551
# I love my sunny day

27
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,511
# Dream of far away

28
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,154
# Dreaming on my pillow

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,589
# In the morning

30
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,551

# In the morning light

34
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,391
Oh!

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,989
Ooh, I'm gonna be late!

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,395
...a lot more of you later.

37
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,511
Not just now, please.

38
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,269
# La-la-la la-la-la la!

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,551
# Mm, la-la-la la-la-la la

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,114
# Mm, la-la-la lee-la-la lor

41
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,519
# La!

42
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,873
Dougal!

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,989
Ugh!

44
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,270
Dougal, I knew you'd make it.

45
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,277
You're just in time for the concert!

46
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,517
Yes, Florence, of course.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

47
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,436
Well, don't think you're getting
a sugar lump just for turning up.

48
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,471
Sugar? Who needs sugar?

49
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,194
Not me. I quit! This morning!

50
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,197
Hm, I'll believe that when I see it!

51
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,392
-# Toreador Song from Carmen
- Ermintrude's about to begin.

52
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,397
- Oh, no!
- Be brave!

53
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,318
- Florence...
- Ssh!

54
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,708
# Toreador, en garde!

55
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,868
# Toreador, Toreador

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,869
# Et songe bien, oui,
songe en combattant

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,632
# Qu'un oeil noir te regarde

58
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,751
# Et que l'amour t'attend

59
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,793
# Toreador

60
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:26,600
# Toreador, l'amour t'attend!

61
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,834
Ugh!

62
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,757
# You Really Got Me

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,993
# Girl, you really got me goin'

64
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,839
# You got me so I don't know
what I'm doin'

65
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,794

# You got me so I can't sleep at night

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,194
Go baby!

68
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,437
# Ye-e-e-e-eah
# Yeah, you really got me now

69
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,313
# You got me so I...
I don't know what I'm doing

70
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,035
# Oh, yeah, you really got me now
- Mm?

71
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,674
# You got me so I can't sleep at night

72
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,995
# You really got me, you really got me

73
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,599
# You really got me

74
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,748
D'you know what I mean?

75
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,633
# See, don't ever set me free

76
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,991
# I always wanna be by your side
# La la-la-la-la-la-la la la la

77
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,237
# Girl, you really got me now

78
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,669
# You've got me so
I can't sleep at night

79
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,711
Take it out.

80
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,876
# Yeah
# You really got me now

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,878
# You got me so I don't know
what I'm doin'

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,595
# Oh, yeah, you really got me now

83
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,188
# You got me so I can't sleep at night

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,993
# You really got me
# Yeah, yeah, you really got me

85
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,078
# You really got me,
you know, you, like, really got me

86
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,668
# O-o-o-o-o-o-ow!

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,672
Groove me, Erminduda!

88
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,598
# You really got me, you really got me

89
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,472
# You really got me
- Yeah, baby

90
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,238
# You really got me
- Milk it, Mummy!

91
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,952
# Me-e-e-e-e-e-e!

92
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,637
Pfffft!

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,830
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

94
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,157
What an unforeseeable accident.
That's not an easy fix, that.

95
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,272
We're looking at
a multiple abrasion friction gash.

96
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,198
I did not know you were
a qualified mechanic, Dougal.

97
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,630
Of course! If you bring me an air pump,
some glue, four watermelons,

98
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,478
water skis, a trombone
and gobstoppers,

99
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,989
I might just be able to help you out.

100
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,315
Ha, ha! I am lucky you were here.

101
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,908
- Will you take care of my things?
- Oh, I'll take care of them, all right.

102
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,672
Mm!

103
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,109
I think I'll take care of
those lollipops first.

104
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,154
Then...ooh, those sherbets.
And...ooh, those caramel creams.

105
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,552
Whoa!

106
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,878
Whoooa!

107
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,797
Thank you. Thank you.

108
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,399
Encore! Encore!

109
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,317
Thank you. So sweet.

110
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,319
- Now, for my next number, I shall...
- Whoa!

111
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,629
Help!

112
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,553
Oh, Dougal!

113
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,079
Help! Get me off!

114
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,997
How do I stop this thing?

115
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,509
Please help me!

116
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,390
- Whoa!
- Oof!

117
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,075
He's always got to make
a big entrance.

118
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,836
Oh dear, that's not good.

119
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,430
- Hold on tight, children.
- Help!

120
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,314
Mr Rusty!

121
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,192
Whoa!

122
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,111
Quick! I can't get off!

123
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,917
Oh, my goodness, it's out of control!

124
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,791
Wh-What's happening?

125
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,354
This is too Wagnerian for words!

126
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,959
Oh, Florence!

127
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,196
- What was that?
- Bad trip!

128
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,438
Puccini preserve us!
What's happened to the Roundabout?

129
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,791
Ugh! Oh, no. What's happening?

130
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,797
Florence! Are you all right?

131
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,911
Dougal! I'm cold!

132
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,554
Don't worry, Florence.
We'll get you out of there.

133
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,398
What on earth shall we do?

134
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,790
Zebedee! Zebedee! Zebedee!

135
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,597
Zebedee, thank goodness.

136
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,870
Whatever's the matter, my friends?

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,594
- Something awful has happened.
- Look.

138
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,199
Oh, no!

139
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,117
I hoped this day would never come.

140
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,719
What, Tuesdays?

141
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,319
But Tuesdays are great!

142
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,431
- On Tuesdays we make cake...
- No Dougal.

143
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,313
The day Zeebad escapes!

144
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,034
Zeebad? I thought
that was just a shaggy dog story.

145
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,118
I'm afraid not, Dougal. He's all too real.

146
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,471
Cold-hearted, tyrannous and cruel.

147
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,479
For thousands of years,
he kept our world bound in ice.

148
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,591
And now you've released him, he's free
to wield his terrifying power once more.

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,797
Oooh!

150
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,831
Free at last!

151
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,554
It took 10,000 years,

152
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,989
but the best things
are worth waiting for.

153
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,429
Power. Revenge...

154
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,791
and, er...more power!

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,154
Cold.
But not cold enough for my liking.

156
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,878
Ha, ha!

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,958
Soon it will be
nice and frozen everywhere,

158
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,959
just like it was
before Zebedee ruined everything.

159
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,389
Now, where to begin?

160
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,439
Eh?

161
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,595
Aha!

162
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,597
What's this?

163
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,713
Ooh, just what I need - a henchman!

164
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,715
Today one soldier, tomorrow the world!

165
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,750
And then, perhaps,
three more soldiers!

166
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,912
Focus, Zeebad, focus!

167
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,398
I've done it!

168
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,675
A lean, mean, fighting machine
who'll obey my every command!

169
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,392
Eyes right!

170
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,999
Quick march!

171
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,396
# He's a lean, mean, fighting machine

172
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,195
# The real deal, know what I mean?

173
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,151
# Marching along

174
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,077
# Well, he'll take you on

175
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,760
# Watch out, here he comes

176
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,110
# He's a fighting machine

177
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,916
Argh!

178
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,071
Attention!

179
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,949
Name?

180
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,311
Sergeant Sam, First Decorative
Clockwork Regiment, saaaaah!

181
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,592
Good! From now on, your mission
is to help me recover three diamonds

182
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,154
taken from me
by a treacherous thief.

183
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,475
Mm. The road will be hard.

184
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,799
Pain, misery and torment
will be your constant companion,

185
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,878
and your only release will be death!

186
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,715
Oh. Er, can I ask about holidays?

187
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,991
- Three weeks in summer.
- Very generous, sir.

188
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,715
Not that it will ever be summer again!

189
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,592
Oh.

190
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,633
Now let's see
what that worm Zebedee is up to.

191
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,035
Well, well.
He's got some little friends, has he?

192
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,674
I'll soon see to them.

193
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,555
To my old lair!
We shall plan our line of attack.

194
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,388
Only by returning
the enchanted diamonds

195
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,035
to their original places on the
Roundabout will you defeat Zeebad.

196
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,073
But if he finds them first,
he will use them to freeze the sun!

197
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,590
Nothing will grow. Not even grass.

198
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,473
OK, people. We've got a problem.

199
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,557
One of the diamonds is hidden here,
on the Roundabout.

200
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,557
I must stay behind to guard it.

201
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,319
To find the other two,
you will need this map.

202
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,077
You must head north
into the mountains.

203
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,997
There is no time to waste.

204
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,109
Whoa!

205
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,835
Well, I hope you've supplied us with
an appropriate mode of transportation.

206
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,515
Whoops! Ha, ha, I'll just back up.

207
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,710
It's hardly the Orient Express, darling!

208
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,319
Does it have first class?

209
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,589
What?

210
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,393
Take good care of
this little box of tricks.

211
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,909
It may save you in your hour of need.

212
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,600
Florence, hold on. I'll be back.

213
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,391
- I promise.
- Don't be too long.

214
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,795
Whatever happens,
you mustn't blame yourself.

215
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,831
- No, leave that to us.
- Hm!

216
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,029
All aboard!

217
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,277
Don't worry, children.
Our friends will save us.

218
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,279
Steam, check. Furnace, check.
Pistons, check. Wahey!

219
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,515
Sorry. Passengers.
I forgot the passengers.

220
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,353
Hello, trees!

221
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,232
Hello, birds!

222
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,157
Hello, scary freezing mist.

223
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,638
Oh, dear. Lucky they can't hear me.

224
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,990
I wouldn't want them thinking
I'm a scaredy-train.

225
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,598
Oh, Florence.

226
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,078
I wonder where we're going.
I wonder if they even know.

227
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,590
I wonder if they know that I don't
even know. Oh, this is so exciting!

228
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,517
- Dougal.
- Yeah?

229
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,234
You mustn't feel guilty
just because it's all your fault.

230
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,318
- Me?
- Oh, sorry, that didn't come out right.

231
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,032
My fault?

232
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,593
What did I do?

233
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,950
What, apart from wrecking
the Roundabout,

234
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,798
trapping Florence and the children

235
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,151
and causing the escape of a maniac
intent on freezing the sun?

236
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,840
I only wanted to get my teeth
into some sweeties.

237
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,112
Yeah, it starts with some sweets, man,
maybe an iced bun,

238
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,277
and before you know it
you're on two bags a day.

239
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,231
I know man, I've been there.

240
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,158
Maybe you've got, like, a problem,
my furry friend?

241
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,750
I have not! And I'll not rest
until I've done everything in my power

242
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,791
to bake things right.

243
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,751
I mean make things right.

244
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,075
Goodness, it's getting cold.

245
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,715
Tell me about it.
I'm freezing my nuts and bolts off here!

246
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,273
I must say,
you're all doing a wonderful job.

247
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,470
Keep up the good work.

248
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,750
What's for dinner anyway?
I'm famished!

249
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,959
Oh, I see, the silent treatment is it?
Huh!

250
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,158
It's lucky I brought
some secret supplies. Mm!

251
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,157
Ah, full moon.

252
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,237
They say the full moon
puts people in the mood for romance.

253
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,152
What a perfect venue
for an open-air Verdi festival.

254
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,077
People would flock here.

255
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,952
# La-la-la la-la-la la!

256
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,152
Not even sheep
would flock to that noise.

257
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,350
# La-la-la lee-la-la lor!

258
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,231
- Uh-oh.
- Mm?

259
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,758
That was a close shave.

260
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,115
My gobstoppers! Oh, no!

261
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,832
There's only one left!

262
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,428
Right! It's time we all got
some beauty sleep.

263
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,629
Dylan?

264
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,749
Dylan!

265
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,348
- Wha... What?
- Bedtime!

266
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,119
Gee, thanks for waking me up
to let me know.

267
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,468
Someone should keep watch.

268
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,397
- I was thinking...
- Good of you to offer.

269
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,839
- What?
- Good night.

270
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,793
- Good night, darlings.
- Night-night, Ermindude.

271
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,239
Eh? What?

272
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,032
Now my impression
of a sleeper train.

273
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,071
Wait, wait...

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,719
Oh, no. I've run out of toothpaste!

275
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,677
Why do I have to be the guard dog?

276
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,634
What's wrong with a guard snail
or a guard cow or...?

277
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,512
Who goes there?

278
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,200
Friend or foe? Or...

279
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,198
...moose? F-Feeling a bit blue?

280
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,197
You're not the only one.

281
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,868
Oh, is this a friend of yours?

282
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,837
I'll take that as a no!

283
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,553
- Dooougaaal?
- Dooougie?

284
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,796
- Dougal?
- Doooougal?

285
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,071
- Dougal?
- Doogie? Doogie, man?

286
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,838
Here, Dougal. Here, Dougal.

287
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,190
Oooh, I've found a trail.
Maybe it'll lead us to him.

288
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,788
Or maybe it'll lead us to that...

289
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,711
...moose.

290
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,714
I think he's trying to tell us something.

291
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,876
Have you seen our friend Dougal?

292
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,312
Big black nose,
looks like a bad hair day on legs?

293
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,192
You're wasting your time, Brian.

294
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,515
Whoever heard of a talking moose?

295
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
Says the opera-singing cow.

296
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,790
Look, I think he wants us to follow him.

297
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,677
Come on! As fast as you can!

298
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,475
Now, you dim-witted draft excluder,
tell me everything.

299
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,830
Well, I was a very happy puppy.

300
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,077
My first memories are
of catching tennis balls with Florence.

301
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,556
- Then, as I grew up, she...
- No, you follicly-enhanced freak!

302
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,069
Tell me about the diamonds,

303
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,158
or I'll make you wish
you'd packed a pooper-scooper!

304
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,113
Me? I don't know anything.
I don't even have the map.

305
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,789
So, there's a map, eh?

306
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,872
No, no, no, no... No map.

307
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,434
Well, of course
they wouldn't trust you with it.

308
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,630
You're just a silly little dog.

309
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,115
You'd probably bury it or chew it!

310
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,156
So, who does have the map?

311
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,951
- Eh?
- I'll never tell!

312
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,149
Oh, no?

313
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,795
Sam, stop mincing around
with that duster.

314
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,708
Torture this boarding house for fleas
until he tells us everything.

315
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,829
Yes, sir!

316
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,791
Right, then. Torture!

317
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,275
Look, this is all a bit new to me,
so, erm...

318
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,152
what is it you're most afraid of?

319
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,635
Erm... Hm.

320
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,831
It won't be long now until I have
my full powers back.

321
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,313
Then I...

322
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,874
Oh, no! No, no! Not that!

323
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,558
Good Sam!

324
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,079
Enjoy yourself!

325
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,111
No, please! Ooh, no more!

326
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,471
- 26...
- Ooh, I can't stand it!

327
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,275
27... He can't possibly
take much more of this!

328
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,277
You've eaten 27 sugar cubes!

329
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,712
You'll have to make me eat 100
before I tell you anything!

330
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,191
No, no! Please!

331
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,390
Soon the diamonds will be mine

332
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,678
and I'll be able to turn
this hideous green planet

333
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,872
into a lovely frozen wasteland.

334
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,309
This is terrible!

335
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,959
- No, you mustn't!
- Little more.

336
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,799
-...don't you?
- How long will this take? I'm working...

337
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,675
- Eh?
- Ooh, Ow! You're killing me!

338
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,513
Ooh!

339
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,593
- Argh!
- Ooh, that sounded painful!

340
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,030
Hee, hee! Excellent work, Sam.

341
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,073
No! Leave me alone, you evil fiend!

342
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,191
What are you talking about?

343
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,550
It's me - Ermintrude.

344
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,116
Could you come back in five minutes?
I was just starting to enjoy myself.

345
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,673
Oh, come on, Dougal.

346
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,392
Full steam backwards!

347
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,278
Finish him off, Sam.

348
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,356
It's time we...

349
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,713
The dog! What have you done
with him, you idiot?

350
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,675
Ooh... Well, sir, I got flattened
by a flying cow. Oooh!

351
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,679
Not so fast!

352
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,190
Ow! Ooh, let go of my tail,
you br-brute.

353
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,309
Ermintrude!

354
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,192
Faster!

355
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,231
- Aaaagh!
- Oooow!

356
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,868
Back it up, back it up!

357
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,078
How nice of you to drop in.

358
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,599
Pull!

359
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,159
Sorry, can't stay long.

360
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,993
- Aaaagh!
- Uh-oh! Whiplash!

361
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,474
Hello.

362
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,398
Ah, she looks a lot better
from this angle.

363
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,877
She'll look a lot better when she's being
served with a side order of fries.

364
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,233
After them!

365
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,358
This is cold
and very unpleasant. Where are we?

366
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,119
- Keep going! Keep going!
- There must be another way.

367
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,276
Yeah, man. Yeah, yeah.

368
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,197
Keep going, people.

369
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,594
Whoa!

370
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,433
I'm a train, not a snowboard!

371
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,675
# Ba-ba-ba bom

372
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,438
# Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

373
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,879
# Ba-ba-ba bom

374
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,558
# Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

375
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,669
# Ba-ba-ba bom

376
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,875
# Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

377
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,989
# Ba-ba-ba bom

378
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,395
# Keep spinnin', spinnin' around

379
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,636
# A-a-a-ah

380
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,829
# Ba-ba-ba bom

381
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,949
Aagh!

382
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,554
I was made to shunt...not to ski!

383
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,159
Aaargh!

384
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,155
Whoa, man, that's deep.

385
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,228
I think we've reached
the end of the line.

386
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,591
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

387
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,472
Sam, your sword!

388
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,750
Sir! En garde!

389
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,594
Hey, man, give peace a chance.

390
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,109
Nobody can save you now.

391
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,316
Zebedee! Zededee! Zebedeeeee!

392
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,832
You!

393
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,551
So we meet again.

394
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,352
Indeed.

395
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,119
I've waited 10,000 years
for my revenge.

396
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,155
And, as you know,
revenge is a dish best served cold.

397
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,753
Some like it hot, Zeebad!

398
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,873
I've still got some spring in my step,
Zeebad.

399
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,317
Well done, Zebedee!

400
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,318
- Oh, no.
- I think the spring has sprung.

401
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,790
Oi! Where do you think
you lot are going?

402
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,153
Sam?

403
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,999
Sam! Stop!
Think about what you're doing.

404
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,473
It's not my job to think.

405
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,875
I'm a soldier. I'm just following orders.

406
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,073
You may wear a soldier's uniform,
Sam, but it's what's inside that counts.

407
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,189
Look out!

408
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,029
Ugh!

409
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,513
Blimey.

410
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,710
Run! Run!

411
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,831
Come on, gang, here's our chance.

412
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,638
Argh!

413
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,433
Move that moustache!
Oops, nearly a toothpick.

414
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:03,669
Your days in the sun are over,
Zebedee, you benevolent bed spring!

415
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,076
Now it's time for Zeebad!

416
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,151
Stop! Zebedee's in trouble!

417
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,077
No, save yourselves!

418
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,952
What shall we do? What shall we do?

419
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,799
Well, we can't leave him.
To the rescue!

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,594
You've got to find the diamonds!

421
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,077
Ah, so it ends.

422
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,556
My nemesis finally vanquished forever.

423
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,559
Get the diamonds!

424
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,160
Noooooo!

425
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,635
We have no choice.
We must leave now.

426
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,637
There's nothing more we can do here.

427
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,911
- Come on, Doog.
- Quick.

428
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,468
It's almost enough to make one weep,

429
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,673
if only I wasn't so very, very happy.
Ha, ha!

430
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,588
Now nothing can stand in my way!

431
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,715
No, Sam.
It's all in the back of the throat.

432
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,192
Right now, even if I could speak,
I wouldn't know what to say.

433
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,758
I can't believe he's really gone.

434
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,793
Zeb's dead, baby. Zeb's dead.

435
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,276
And now who's going to help Florence
and the children?

436
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,879
Who's going to help us?

437
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,956
Be strong, Ermintrude.

438
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,594
We have to be brave
and find the diamonds.

439
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,111
After all,
that was Zebedee's dying wish.

440
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,478
It's no good, man.

441
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,875
Without Zebedee, we're nothing.

442
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,351
No, Brian's right.

443
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,311
We're gonna save our world.

444
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,158
Now where's the map?

445
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,879
There! Head for the tallest mountain
in that range.

446
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,831
That's the spirit, Brian!

447
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,033
Nothing short of a sea of boiling lava
will keep me from that diamond now.

448
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,671
Oh, sugar.

449
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,470
Well, that's where the diamond is.

450
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,431
Who's going to get it?

451
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,189
Ah, well, diamonds are a girl's
best friend. Off you trot, Ermintrude.

452
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,198
Men are supposed to give ladies
diamonds. Not the other way round.

453
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,436
Hey, I thought dogs
were supposed to fetch.

454
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,917
My forte's always been "sit, Dougal".
That, and "Stay, Dougal, stay".

455
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,749
Dylan...surely it's only a short hop
for such a brave bunny.

456
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,916
More like a long drop
for a dumb rabbit.

457
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,598
Quiet!

458
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,951
Ahem. There's a bridge over there.

459
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,437
I think I ought to keep a lookout here
while you lot cross to the other s...

460
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,233
He's not a dog, he's a chicken.

461
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,316
All right, all right. I understand.

462
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,271
You don't want to go
without your leader.

463
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,879
Talk about wag your own tail.

464
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,831
Oooh, I'm scared of heights.

465
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,077
Don't worry about them -
it's the widths you have to worry about.

466
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,872
This is gonna be easy.

467
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,752
- Careful!
- Easy does it.

468
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,316
- A bit close to the edge.
- Just don't look down.

469
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,636
Look straight ahead.

470
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,909
Whoa!

471
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,469
Ooh, hot rocks, man!

472
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,272
Keep your eyes on the road!

473
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,278
- Wha... What road, man?
- I'm on it. Don't worry.

474
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,152
Why have you stopped?

475
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,430
One step at a time.

476
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,437
Oh, yeah, oh...

477
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,713
There we go. This is gonna be easy.

478
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,911
Argh!

479
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,678
Noooo!

480
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,872
Dylan! Do something!

481
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,070
Can't one of you
just hop out and push?

482
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,998
Whoa. I'm totally not train trained.

483
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,111
That's not helping, Dylan!

484
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,479
Ah, for a nice siding
and a can of warm oil.

485
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,958
No need to panic.

486
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,991
Now. Now is a good time to panic.

487
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,470
Rock and roll, man!

488
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,828
Brilliant.

489
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,951
I've had it with public transport!

490
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,198
The diamond!

491
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,309
Wo-ow!

492
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,078
And there you have it!

493
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,112
- I have led you all to the first diamond!
- Wow!

494
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,708
Dylan, do the honours, would you?

495
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,756
Yeah. Cool.

496
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,838
Er, I-I think this thing needs tuning.

497
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,233
Something's happening!

498
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,157
- My feet are frozen.
- I'm cold.

499
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,669
Come on, children.
We... We have to be brave.

500
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,030
Look! It's Florence!

501
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,398
Strange. For a second there,
I thought I heard...

502
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,590
Oh... I must be going mad.

503
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,676
She can hear me! Florence!

504
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,950
It's me, Dougal. I've come to save you!

505
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,991
Dougal? Is that you?

506
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,877
- What? No!
- Dougal?

507
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,353
- She's fading!
- Dougal!

508
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,393
It's only been one day
and the children are freezing fast.

509
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,515
Concerned for your friends?
Ha, ha, ha!

510
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,797
And I'll take the map too, please.

511
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,434
Wait, how do you know there's a...

512
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,190
Well, they tortured it out of me!

513
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,634
Give me that map!

514
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,868
- Please!
- Over my dead body!

515
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,673
Sam, get out the garlic butter!

516
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,234
I'm feeling a little peckish.

517
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,679
You're bluffing.

518
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,951
Try me, you spineless slime-spreader!

519
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,229
Leave him alone!

520
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,277
Take the map.

521
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,755
You're a despicable fiend!

522
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,110
I know, ha, ha, ha. It's a gift, really.

523
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,800
Compassion is such a weakness.

524
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,070
Sorry we can't stay
but you know how it is.

525
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,750
- People to rule, places to freeze.
- Hup, hup, hup!

526
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,440
Come on, imbecile,
we have to destroy the bridge!

527
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,193
So long, suckers!

528
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,272
Hold up.

529
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,074
Aaaagh!

530
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,394
Oh!

531
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,518
Good work, soldier!

532
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,676
There's hope for you yet.

533
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,597
Thank you, sir!

534
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,994
Cor!

535
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,716
Man, they don't make crumbling
rock causeways like they used to.

536
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,196
Is there any chance
it will, like, grow back?

537
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,391
At least we'll be nice and warm.

538
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,478
Oh, tragedy! We're doomed!

539
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,671
And just as I was about to make it big.

540
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,473
- You are big.
- Thank you, Dougal.

541
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,229
But I was hoping the peak of a volcano
wouldn't be the pinnacle of my career.

542
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,148
Chill out, guys. I've got something
stashed that just might help.

543
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,477
Dylan, we don't have time to
experiment with recreational activities.

544
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,832
Zebedee's Magic Box!

545
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,473
Of course!

546
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,798
Now, if I could just get my head round
how to work this thing.

547
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,876
Did Zebedee give anyone
the instructions?

548
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,991
Just press the button!

549
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,272
Whoa!

550
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,152
A boat. Brilliant.

551
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,316
It'll be plain sailing from here on in.

552
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,273
Wait! I've got it.

553
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,277
The tents!

554
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,277
He's really lost it this time.

555
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,837
Oh, this heat is making my horns curl!

556
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,598
I must look a sight.

557
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,870
Oh, no, Ermintrude. I think you look...

558
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,517
That is, I find you...

559
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,993
Look...

560
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,829
in case we don't make it out of here,
I just want you to know that...

561
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,032
All aboard!

562
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,793
This is amazing!
I've never been this high before.

563
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,196
In fact, I've never been off the ground
before. What are we doing?

564
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,072
Well done, Dylan. A balloon escape.

565
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,350
My! You are clever.

566
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,950
It's all about altitude over attitude,
Ermindude.

567
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,311
Excuse me,
but there's still one small problem.

568
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,477
We have no idea where we're going.

569
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,433
Brian's right.
We could drift around for years!

570
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,313
Or we could just, like, follow them.

571
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,068
Faster, Sam. You row like a milkmaid!

572
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,758
Ease up, sir.

573
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,758
Now those pesky thieves
are out the way, what's the big rush?

574
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,156
Sam, imagine if you'd waited
10,000 years

575
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,157
to come home to your frozen kingdom,

576
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,068
only to find a world covered in flowers
and animals and sunshine and...

577
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,273
And trees and rainbows
and tiny little bunny rabbits.

578
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,392
Shut up and row, you wooden windbag!

579
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,558
Soon I will have the second diamond,

580
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,116
and all those stranded simpletons
will have is each other...

581
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,835
for dinner!

582
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,958
Sam, you're ruining the moment.

583
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,877
Sorry, sir.

584
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,752
Is that the Milky Way, Ermintrude?

585
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,078
Brian! You should never ask a lady
anything so personal!

586
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,111
What?

587
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,156
Aren't the stars beautiful?

588
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,270
So beautiful.

589
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,675
Wouldn't you love to be one of them?

590
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,510
I'd give anything.

591
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,438
You'd make a wonderful star.

592
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,755
Oh, I dare say you're right.

593
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,269
So serene.

594
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,436
So heavenly.

595
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,079
So admired and adored.

596
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,270
Always looking down on everyone.

597
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,188
Oooh, yes!

598
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,596
We should get some sleep, man.

599
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,314
Honestly,
is that all you ever think about?

600
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,829
Sure. Whenever I'm awake.

601
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,397
I can't sleep.

602
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,397
I'm too worried about my Florence.

603
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,476
She's so helpless without me.

604
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,272
She must be petrified.

605
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,709
Pets? Fried?

606
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,831
Bad karma.

607
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,235
Exactly. I calm her down.

608
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,755
The truth is, I do everything for her.

609
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,474
Her life would be quite empty
without me there.

610
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,116
Whoa...
Don't toast the hamsters, dude.

611
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,279
During scary thunderstorms,
she insists I climb into bed with her...

612
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,197
for her protection.

613
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,629
And she just loves to throw
a tennis ball.

614
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,432
Who's always there to bring it back

615
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,995
so she can have the pleasure
of throwing it again?

616
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,872
I'm telling you, Dylan.

617
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,877
I bet she really misses that.

618
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,028
Really, really, really missing that.

619
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,671
Florence?

620
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,597
Florence!

621
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,029
# Mr Blue Sky

622
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,552
# Sun is shinin' in the sky

623
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,475
# There ain't a cloud in sight

624
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,397
# It's stopped rainin'

625
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,431
# Everybody's in a play

626
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,519
# And don't you know
it's a beautiful new day

627
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,471
# Hey-ey-ey

628
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,194
# Runnin' down the avenue

629
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,798
# See how the sun shines brightly

630
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,955
# In the city

631
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,640
# On the streets where once was pity

632
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,435
# Mr Blue Sky is living here today

633
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,391
# Hey-ey-ey

634
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,158
# Mr Blue Sky

635
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,474
# Please tell us why

636
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,151
# You had to hide away for so long
# So long

637
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,191
# Where did we go wrong?

638
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,792
# Mr Blue, you did it right

639
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,350
# But soon comes Mr Night

640
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,870
# Creepin' over,
Now his hand is on your shoulder

641
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,151
# Never mind,
I'll remember you this way

642
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,475
# I'll remember you this way

643
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,919
# Mr Blue Sky

644
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,393
# Please tell us why

645
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,592
# You had to hide away for so long

646
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,755
# So long

647
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,155
# Where did we go wrong?

648
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,678
Hey, man. Tropical vibes!

649
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,075
But look, there's ice up ahead.

650
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,556
- Where?
- Something strange is definitely afoot.

651
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,591
Yeah, it's definitely a foot.

652
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,632
OK, everybody, prepare to land.

653
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,951
Can't be far now.

654
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,156
This is definitely the place.

655
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,078
- Let's press on.
- Ow!

656
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,031
Hold up, sir.

657
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,956
After me, sir. It could be dangerous,
and I've got a sixth sense for...

658
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,117
Try concentrating on the other five

659
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,071
and you might not lose your head.

660
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,589
Now, what do we have here?

661
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,909
Aha!

662
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,719
The whole place is booby-trapped.

663
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,079
So, what do we do now, boss?

664
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,350
Land ho!

665
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,269
Hmm.

666
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,231
Thank goodness! I can't wait

667
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,191
to feel earth beneath my hooves.

668
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,515
Any idea how we can land this thing?

669
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,471
They're still alive!

670
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,953
Well, boil my busby!

671
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,629
No matter. All that booby traps require
are a bunch of boobies.

672
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,639
We'll let them clear the way,
then we can just stroll in.

673
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,676
- Come on!
- Ooh!

674
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,471
Lower, lower.

675
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,277
Loads of room! Lower.

676
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,072
Here comes a...

677
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,236
- Stop!
-...nice smooth...

678
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,149
...crash.

679
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,228
- Ow!
- Ooh!

680
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,193
Just in time for lunch.

681
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,510
And it looks like you're on the menu.

682
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,596
I wonder where Zeebad is.

683
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,598
We must have overtaken him.
Nice one, Train!

684
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,789
No worries, Rabbit.

685
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,115
Wait here
and keep your pistons pumping.

686
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,753
We may need to make
a quick getaway.

687
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,348
Hey, let's make it
really quick and go now.

688
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,714
I wonder what these symbols mean.

689
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,230
It's probably the ancient equivalent
of a welcome mat... Oh!

690
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,476
Oh, where are my manners?

691
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,194
- Ladies first.
- No, after you.

692
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,072
Age before beauty, dear.

693
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,509
Oh, for heaven's sake, I'll go.

694
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,200
Don't look so shell-shocked,
Ermintrude.

695
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,880
I may be slow
but I can still take the lead.

696
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,558
Just follow my trail.

697
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,636
Well, look who's beginning
to grow a spine.

698
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,876
Spine? What do you mean "spine"?

699
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,877
I'm always the first into the fray!

700
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,231
Those lazy tykes. I'm the only one
who does anything around here!

701
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,078
It's "Brian do this, Brian do that."

702
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,077
"Yes, sir. No, sir. Three bags full, sir."

703
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,872
They treat me like a slave!

704
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,911
It's a disgrace. "Where's my sugar?"

705
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,349
"Where's my grass?"
They must think I'm a soft touch.

706
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,277
But I always go crawling back.

707
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,675
Well, come on, it's all clear.

708
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,713
Let's go.

709
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,031
I never thought I'd say this but...
what a snail!

710
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,879
OK, wait here. That's what they said.
Wait.

711
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,149
Urgh!

712
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,157
I-I don't like this.

713
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,838
I don't like this.

714
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,918
What's this? I'll go into the tunnel.
I'm a train. I like tunnels.

715
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,270
I'll wait here, that's it, yeah.

716
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,356
I'll wait just...

717
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,191
Oooh!

718
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,872
Mmm...

719
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,874
- Hey!
- Whoa!

720
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,831
Anyone find the diamonds?

721
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,918
Oh, Doog, man. Don't you know
rabbits are kind of jumpy?

722
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,792
I don't see any clues.

723
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,595
We must be in the wrong place.

724
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,077
Oooh, a throne - the perfect place
to enjoy my last gobstopper.

725
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,796
Oh, great, a recline button!

726
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,196
Ooooh!

727
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,991
Whoaaa!

728
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,789
The diamond!

729
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,919
Cool light show, man.

730
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,634
Hello, pretty lasers.

731
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,988
No-ooo!

732
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,553
They're alarm beams!

733
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,478
Someone has to get through
to the diamond.

734
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,398
- Well, I'm too hairy.
- I've got the shakes.

735
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,636
Oh, for the love of Mozart, I'll do it!

736
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,069
I trained as a ballerina, you know.

737
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,077
My Swan Lake was the talk of...

738
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,909
Stop milking the moment
and get me out of here!

739
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,679
Ommmm.

740
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,234
# In The Hall Of The Mountain King

741
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,190
Aah...

742
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,471
# Da-daaa!

743
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,318
Weeeeee!

744
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,873
Well done! That was bril...

745
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,752
No-oooo!

746
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,709
Oops!

747
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,439
I don't suppose anyone knows
anything about martial arts?

748
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,718
Just the basics of, like, kung fu, karate,
judo, kendo, tae kwon do,

749
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,479
anything-you-can-do and...t'ai chi.

750
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,750
Oooh!
Do they come with egg fried rice?

751
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,394
Dylan...can you beat them up?

752
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,954
Sorry, I don't believe in violence.

753
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,391
Except in self-defence.

754
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,995
Oh, man! That's what I call
pulling yourself together.

755
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,669
Ya! Ya!

756
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,392
Wee!

757
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,592
- Wa! Ta! Come on, man.
- Dylan!

758
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,078
Ah, fa da!

759
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,510
I'm not just another pretty face!

760
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,153
Sha ka!

761
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,032
Woo-hoo ya!

762
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,991
Ya woo!

763
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,788
Good group effort. Now, let's grab
the diamond and head off.

764
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,957
I'm a train, I have a whistle.

765
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,874
It's dark down here.
Lucky I have tunnel vision, hee, hee!

766
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,674
Whoa!

767
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,394
Big engine, alloy wheels...

768
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,359
You wouldn't want to be
on the wrong end of that.

769
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,472
Whoa.

770
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,228
Uh-oh!

771
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,432
So...

772
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:15,829
The fearless warrior of legend
has come to claim the diamond!

773
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,999
Erm, no actually, the fearless warrior
couldn't make it today,

774
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,599
so we came instead.

775
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,950
Er, we'll drop it in to him
on the way home.

776
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,312
Look, do you want the diamond
or don't you?

777
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,238
Er, well, if you're offering...yes, please!

778
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,112
I've got a better idea.

779
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,958
Let's jump him!

780
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,675
Chaaaaaa...

781
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,553
...aaaaaaa...

782
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,435
...aaaarge!

783
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,879
It was just a thought.

784
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,389
How about...run away!

785
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,033
Oh, no!

786
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,233
Aaagh!

787
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,395
He-He-Help!

788
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,033
Help!

789
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,197
Dogs are meant to eat bones,
not the other way around!

790
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,229
Huh?

791
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,954
Aaaaargh!

792
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,590
That was quick thinking, Dougal.

793
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,551
Yeah, well, if you keep your cool

794
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,672
and don't run around like a headless
chicken... No time for chitchat.

795
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,598
Let's grab that diamond and get out.

796
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,115
It's gone!

797
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,918
Fools! Looking for this?

798
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,718
You just can't get the staff these days.

799
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:54,350
Now, do you want to tell me
where the third diamond is?

800
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,754
Nope.

801
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,110
Resistance is futile!

802
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,959
You're no match for the great Zeebad!

803
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,399
Pride comes before a fall.

804
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,033
Dougal! Now!

805
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,789
Whoa!

806
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,990
Hooray!
That's the last we'll see of them.

807
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,677
- Oooh...
- Euch!

808
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,711
Oooh!

809
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,199
Ouch!

810
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,878
That took him down a peg or ten!

811
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,515
Yeah, man, except you just flushed
away diamonds one and two.

812
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,949
So...where do we go now?

813
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,958
We must get back to the Roundabout
as fast as we can.

814
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,275
I know there's like,
"no rest for the wicked",

815
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,949
but I'm one of the good guys
and right now I need a siesta.

816
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,638
Whoa!

817
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,513
Look!

818
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,517
Voices! I knew they'd come
to rescue me.

819
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,518
Hang on, maybe I'm supposed to be
rescuing them.

820
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,518
Hey, that sound's familiar.

821
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,757
Typical train. Always turns up
when you least expect it.

822
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,394
Come on, gang. In we go.

823
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,113
Oh, no.

824
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,871
Right, now, let's get out of here.

825
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,560
Oh, do slow down,
you're making my milk churn.

826
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,148
Are you kidding?
We're moving at a snail's pace!

827
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,713
Snail's pace suits me just fine.

828
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,195
Oh, Ermintrude!

829
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,311
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said.

830
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,112
Relax, Doogie.

831
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,913
Soon this whole crazy trip
will be behind us.

832
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,758
Behind us!

833
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,792
- That's what I said, man.
- No! Behind us!

834
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,518
Faster! Faster!

835
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,589
Duck!

836
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,233
Oof!

837
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,076
I always wanted to be a roller coaster!

838
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,838
Whoa!

839
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,234
Whoa, dudes!

840
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,078
Talk about a near-death experience.

841
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,270
I thought I saw the light
at the end of the tunnel.

842
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,073
That is the light
at the end of the tunnel!

843
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,872
We're going to be OK!

844
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,389
And Zeebad's still trapped
in the temple!

845
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,673
Then, like, who's that,
his evil twin, Zeebadder?

846
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,273
Where's my third diamond?

847
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,552
Whoa! Furnace, don't fail me now!

848
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,713
Whoo!

849
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,389
Aaagh!

850
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,750
Brace yourself, everybody!

851
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,996
Whoa! Mind the gap!

852
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,869
Hey!

853
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,596
Here comes big nose!

854
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,193
Somebody do something!

855
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,872
Hey, this must be
some kinda anti-spring device.

856
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,195
- This'll slow Zeebad down.
- Really?

857
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,993
- Aaaagh!
- Or it could be an ejector seat.

858
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,589
What the devil was that?

859
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,756
What happened? Why am I blind?

860
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,677
Did we reach the Roundabout yet?

861
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,353
So that's where you're headed!

862
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,595
The Roundabout!

863
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,349
And that's where I'll find my diamond!

864
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,199
So long, slimeball!

865
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,600
Aaagh! Ooooh...

866
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,837
Sam, get up on the roof
and dispose of the prisoner.

867
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,473
Dispose of a prisoner?

868
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,750
Can't do that, sir. Geneva Convention.

869
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,269
Guess what? I'm unconventional!

870
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,316
Un-con-ventional. Ha, ha, ha!

871
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,032
Off with his head!

872
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,276
Aaaargh! He-eeelp!

873
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,879
Brian!

874
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,709
Ouch!

875
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,353
Whoa!

876
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,792
- Welcome aboard!
- Ermintrude, you saved me!

877
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,194
Don't cross me,
you tarted-up tin opener!

878
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,436
Faster, you lily-livered traitor!

879
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,198
I want that diamond!

880
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,992
More coal!

881
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,353
Oh! No!

882
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,391
Trouble dead ahead!

883
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,799
That's my line!

884
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,397
Argh!

885
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,557
Now, this is what happens
when you don't brush regularly!

886
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,789
Sir! The pressure - it's too much!

887
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,717
I know, I know!

888
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,833
Sometimes I feel
I'm going quite insane!

889
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,632
No, sir, it's the boiler!

890
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,749
It's...

891
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,069
Thank goodness! We're safe!

892
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,031
I call that letting off steam!

893
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,309
- Hurrah!
- Whoa!

894
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,314
I can fly-y-y!

895
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,549
No, I can't.

896
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,633
Aaaargh!

897
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,592
Oh, that's enough flying for one day!

898
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,632
We've got to get to the Roundabout
before Zeebad.

899
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,029
Hang on, Zeebad doesn't know
the diamond's at the Roundabout.

900
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,549
Erm... Well, that's not strictly true...

901
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,193
Back there, on the Train...

902
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,551
I-I was confused and it...
it just slipped out.

903
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,829
Brian, man!

904
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,190
Well there's no use
crying over spilt milk.

905
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,197
That's easy for you to say.

906
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,117
Come on, people. To the Train!

907
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,631
Ow!

908
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,997
Whoa. Looks like
this service has been cancelled.

909
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,553
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

910
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,238
Delays look likely.

911
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,112
I think I've pulled a piston.

912
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,595
Ow! Nope, it's not gonna happen.

913
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,438
Oh, poor Trainy!

914
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,755
Oh, the sun's setting.

915
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,599
We'll just have to make it
under our own steam.

916
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,075
Goodbye for now, old buddy.

917
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,958
You can make it.

918
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,479
Just follow our tracks.

919
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,910
Don't worry about me.
You go on, find the diamond.

920
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,518
On second thoughts... What about me?

921
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,117
Wretched machines!

922
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,038
I must reach the Roundabout before...

923
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,593
Ooh, sir!

924
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,278
Medic needed.

925
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,278
SOS. Mayday. Oooh...

926
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,118
Me? Help you?

927
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,472
You treacherous
mollusc-sparing disco dolly!

928
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,955
Your tour of duty is over.

929
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,469
You can't leave an injured soldier, sir.

930
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,794
Can't I?

931
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,831
Just watch me.

932
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,193
Wait!

933
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,276
Come back!

934
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,911
Evil villains...can be so cruel.

935
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,913
I can't go on.

936
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,190
We've been walking for hours.

937
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,595
It's so c-c-cold.

938
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,109
I can't feel my limb.

939
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,309
But Florence...and the children.

940
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,671
If we don't get there soon,
they'll be frozen stiff.

941
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,268
Oh, the cruel hands of time!

942
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,952
But if it... if it wasn't for time,
everything would, like, happen at once.

943
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,913
Wait. What's that?

944
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,469
Footprints! Maybe they'll lead us
back to the village.

945
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,469
But, like, what kinda freaky creatures
would leave prints like these?

946
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,670
They must be exhausted too.

947
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,873
One of them seems to be
crawling along the ground.

948
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,514
I prefer the term gliding.

949
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,676
Oh, no! They're ours!

950
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,279
Oh, no!

951
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,197
No, no!

952
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:54,952
Well, that's it, man.
It's time for the big sleep.

953
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,877
We did our best.

954
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,197
But our best wasn't good enough. Oh...

955
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,276
Oh, it's the final curtain.

956
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,509
No. We mustn't sleep.

957
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,551
It's too cold.

958
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,237
It's too cold.

959
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,191
We mustn't...

960
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,197
Florence...

961
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,313
Doooougaaaal!

962
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,392
- Dougal?
- Florence! You're OK!

963
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,590
I'm more than OK.

964
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,678
I'm swee-eeet.

965
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,470
But what about the Roundabout?

966
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,512
The children? Huddled. Freezing.

967
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,993
Don't worry, Dougal.

968
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,872
You're with me now...

969
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,675
in sugar paradise!

970
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,235
Look. Sweets for my sweet Dougal.

971
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,593
And you can eat as much as you like!

972
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,390
N-No, this isn't right!
I must be going nuts.

973
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,239
I have to wake up. Save Florence.

974
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,998
Florence!

975
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,235
No!

976
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,191
It was just a dream.

977
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,517
Florence!

978
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,793
Flore-eeeeence!

979
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,994
Come on. Wake up!

980
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,951
Wake up! Wake up!

981
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,756
No way, man. I'm in a higher state
of unconsciousness.

982
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,395
It's getting light
and we're still completely lost.

983
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,317
I'm not so sure we are.

984
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,351
Oh!

985
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,068
Whoa, that was some
serious sleepwalking.

986
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,958
Look!

987
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,593
Look, look, look!

988
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,029
Quick! Come and have a look!
Look at that!

989
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,991
Is that really what I think it is?

990
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,997
Home?

991
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,599
Hm!

992
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,675
Curses!

993
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,314
The diamond
must be here somewhere!

994
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,793
Zeebad!

995
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,239
You!

996
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,158
This roundabout ain't big enough
for the both of us!

997
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:55,593
When I leave someone for dead,
I expect them to die.

998
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,154
Can't you even do that right? Eh?

999
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,397
Oh, I haven't done anything right
since I left the Roundabout.

1000
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,750
Now it's time for me
to resume my post.

1001
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,474
You? You were on the Roundabout?

1002
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,999
Yeah, I was.

1003
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,792
Guarding it from the likes of you.

1004
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,751
Ha! Look at the state of you!

1005
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,950
You couldn't guard a boiled egg!

1006
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,799
Well, I might have taken a battering,

1007
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,751
but it's like Zebedee told me:

1008
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,996
it's what's inside that counts!

1009
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,554
Chaaaaarge!

1010
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,279
Ugh!

1011
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,713
Ooh...

1012
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,033
Ooh!

1013
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,639
The diamond!

1014
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,151
Oooh, Zebedee, you cunning swine.

1015
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,593
And to think, I nearly abandoned it
when I left you to die.

1016
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,393
Ooh, the irony!

1017
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,548
Now, time for the big chill!

1018
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,716
This can't be our village.

1019
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,398
I don't recognise a thing.

1020
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,478
Yeah, like, maybe we took
a wrong turn, Doog.

1021
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,670
No, no, this is definitely it.

1022
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,155
If we go past this white thingy

1023
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,077
and by this white bit...

1024
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,509
just round the corner should be the...

1025
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,074
# Also Sprach Zarathustra

1026
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,909
Oh, no!

1027
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,510
Ha, ha, ha!

1028
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,515
Zeebad!

1029
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,671
Ah, perfect!

1030
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,997
You've arrived
just in time for the finale.

1031
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,793
So long, sunshine!

1032
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,717
Florence!

1033
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,311
Oh, Florence!

1034
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,592
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1035
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,392
This is all my fault.

1036
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,593
If only I hadn't been
so greedy and stupid.

1037
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,119
Farewell, then, Dylan.
Goodbye, dear Brian.

1038
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,755
Er...Ermintrude, before we freeze,

1039
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,475
there's something
I've been t-trying to t-tell you...

1040
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:58,351
This guy is seriously
messing with my karma!

1041
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:06,796
Eat this,
you jumped-up jack-in-the-box! Ya!

1042
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,759
Ooof! You just don't know
when you're beaten, do you?

1043
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,550
Take a chill pill, rabbit!

1044
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,035
Whoa! Whoa!

1045
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,839
Aaaaaaaagh!

1046
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,190
Wait a minute. That's it!

1047
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,392
Ermintrude, sing!
Sing as loud as you can!

1048
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,513
I'm not used to working
under these conditions!

1049
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,471
Dougal might be onto something.

1050
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,239
Yes! Ermintrude! Sing!

1051
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,271
I haven't even warmed up!

1052
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,436
Ermintrude! Sing!

1053
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,718
Fine.

1054
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,589
What is that abominable noise?

1055
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,359
Whoa!

1056
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,673
Shell loaded!

1057
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,711
# I Love To Boogie

1058
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:18,829
Take this!

1059
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,313
Run!

1060
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,429
Whoa!

1061
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,472
Ready? Aim. Fire!

1062
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,158
Whoooooa!

1063
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,713
Ooh-hoo!

1064
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,638
Well done!

1065
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,716
Oof!

1066
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,799
Whoooa!

1067
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,195
# Jenny lost her cherry
walking all the way home...

1068
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,038
Dylan, it's coming your way!

1069
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,119
Whoa, that was some hit!

1070
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,350
Whoa! Psy-che-delic!

1071
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,238
# I said we love to boogie

1072
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,671
# We love to boogie...

1073
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,676
I got it, man.

1074
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,389
No!

1075
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,112
Whooooa!

1076
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,792
Over to me! Over to me!

1077
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,388
No! It's mine! Mine! Ha, ha!

1078
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,794
Oof!

1079
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,709
Two-nil!

1080
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,195
The game's not over yet.

1081
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,390
Oof! Oh!

1082
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,397
Oooh, nice catch, Zeebad!

1083
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,158
Now let's get the final...

1084
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,269
diamond!

1085
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,992
Touch it and you're toast.

1086
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,998
You don't scare me!
You're just a big, blue bully.

1087
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,872
Now the tables have turned

1088
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,309
and all we need do
is put this last diamond back on...

1089
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,429
Oops.

1090
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,757
Here comes a home run!

1091
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,438
Not again!

1092
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,391
Argh!

1093
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,918
Victory!

1094
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,916
So close and yet so...

1095
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,837
far out!

1096
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,032
Nice try - for a bunch of dumb animals!

1097
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,072
But now it's closing time at the zoo.

1098
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:11,398
Not with our secret weapon:
Zebedee's magic box!

1099
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,033
- Huh?
- Ya!

1100
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:20,470
It d-doesn't work. Aw!

1101
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,991
Oooooh!

1102
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,554
Zebedee's toys can't help you now.

1103
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,992
Bounce back from that, Slinky!
Woo-hoo!

1104
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,872
Train! I knew you'd make it!

1105
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,991
- Bang on schedule.
- The diamond!

1106
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,519
I'll get it.

1107
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,757
I got us into this mess
and I'll get us out.

1108
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,955
Go on, Dougal.

1109
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,397
Ooh! Ow!

1110
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,116
No-ooo-ooo!

1111
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,197
Huh?

1112
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,431
Hm.

1113
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,111
Mm-mm! Ha, ha, ha!

1114
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,031
We did it! We did it!

1115
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,515
We did it! We did it!

1116
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,319
Come on!

1117
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,233
Well done!

1118
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,828
There's nothing like opera
for breaking the ice.

1119
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:03,716
I can see grass, man!
Sweet, green grass!

1120
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,751
But where's Florence?

1121
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,073
Florence?

1122
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,708
Florence!

1123
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,437
Florence, can you hear me?

1124
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,312
Please wake up.

1125
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,908
Please wake up. Don't leave me.

1126
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,190
This world means nothing without you!

1127
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,231
Sorry, old buddy.

1128
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,919
No, it can't...

1129
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,439
She can't...

1130
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,278
Florence!

1131
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,356
My lovely Florence!

1132
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,354
She moved!

1133
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,034
She's alive!

1134
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,357
Oh, Florence!
I thought I'd lost you forever!

1135
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,471
And I thought I'd lost you too, Dougal.

1136
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,716
But you saved my life.

1137
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,432
And everyone else's.

1138
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,118
Oh, stop it.

1139
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,470
It's what any incredibly heroic dog
would do.

1140
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,272
Oh?

1141
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,356
So you don't want a...

1142
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,993
little reward?

1143
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,712
Oh, no. I've learnt my lesson.

1144
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,070
I'm not having anything more
to do with lollipops.

1145
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,519
Or gobstoppers.

1146
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,868
Or toffees.

1147
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,995
But wait, where's Zebedee?

1148
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,348
Zebedee!

1149
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,517
Bravo, my friends.
I always knew you could do it!

1150
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,073
But we thought you were dead!

1151
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,997
Dead? Nonsense, Dougal!

1152
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:34,272
Everyone knows that after winter
it's time for spring!

1153
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,308
Come on, everyone.
To the Roundabout!

1154
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,117
# Sugar Sugar

1155
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,277
Oh, no!

1156
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,038
How come it's not moving?

1157
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,196
It's like stuck, man.

1158
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,878
What's wrong with the Roundabout?

1159
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,513
Zebedee?

1160
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,914
Don't you remember?

1161
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,349
The Roundabout's
still missing something.

1162
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,119
Or should I say... someone?

1163
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,798
Sam?

1164
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,717
But that's Zeebad's henchman!

1165
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,398
He tortured me!

1166
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,595
Don't be too hard on him.

1167
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:25,793
Sam too was a victim
of Zeebad's maniacal magic.

1168
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,430
It's time for you to return
where you belong, Sam.

1169
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,631
# Sugar

1170
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,391
# Ah, honey, honey

1171
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,352
# You are my candy girl

1172
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,029
# And you got me wanting you...

1173
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,877
Mm!

1174
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,591
# Ah, sugar, sugar...

1175
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,712
Nice shade of moose!

1176
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,237
With matching hooves!

1177
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,196
# I just can't believe
the loveliness of loving you...

1178
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,151
- Dougal?
- Huh?

1179
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:27,317
Dougal? Dougal?

1180
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,352
# I just can't believe
the wonder of this feeling too

1181
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,153
# I just can't believe it's true

1182
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,111
# Ah, sugar...

1183
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:43,711
# The Magic Roundabout

1184
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:49,030
# The birds and the bees
are all singin' to me

1185
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,991
# Tell me what you see

1186
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,635
# The beautiful sky
always makin' us happy

1187
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,593
# It's gonna be a wonderful trip...

1188
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,518
- Dougal!
- Erm...

1189
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,437
# Together you and me...

1190
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,471
Sugar, sugar, sugar!

1191
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,431
Sugar!

1192
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,431
# I'm riding high up in the sky

1193
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,516
# Can you see?

1194
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,279
# The sun is shinin'

1195
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,278

# Off on an adventure,
we're comin' to getcha

1207
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,915
# Wherever that may be

1208
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,191
# Won't let anything come here
and upset you

1209
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,311
# I'm gonna set you free

1210

1211
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,872

Oh, curses!

1218
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,070
Imprisoned once more!

1219
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,512
Ah, well, at least it's cold.

1220
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,231
Double curses!

1221

Time for bed!
