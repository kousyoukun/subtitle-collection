1
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,728
Stop!

2
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,914
<i>Hey, y'all.</i>

3
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,443
You bugger!

4
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,309
Not live rounds, Lara.

5
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,318
He's in real pain right now.

6
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,220
This is a major remodel.
This is a disaster.

7
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,386
Was it programmed to stop
before it took my head off?

8
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,295
Ah, well, that would be a no.

9
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,460
But you said make it
more challenging, so...

10
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,927
Hence, the live fire.

11
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,572
Hmm, live rounds again.

12
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,635
Poor Simon.

13
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,681
What has she done to you?

14
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,930
Very funny.

15
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,306
I'm only trying to
turn you into a lady.

16
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,637
And a lady should be modest.

17
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,979
Yes, a lady should be modest.

18
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,857
Brothers and sisters...

19
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,996
today is the 15th of May...

20
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:57,736
the first day
of the planetary alignment...

21
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,213
and we are still no nearer to
discovering the location of the key.

22
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,771
It seems...

23
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,182
we are running out of time.

24
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,586
This is not acceptable.

25
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:15,593
Mr. Powell,
your explanation for this, please?

26
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,030
I have no explanation.
Certainly no excuses.

27
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,297
Except to once again
respectfully remind the council...

28
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,431
that we are working from clues based
on ancient cosmological models...

29
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,208
predating Aristotle.

30
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,237
But I'm happy to announce
that we're almost ready.

31
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,614
And I am supremely confident...

32
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:44,088
that we will have our answer in time
for the relevant planetary alignment.

33
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,990
So, we will have possession
of the key in...

34
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,890
one week.

35
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:54,421
Yes, indeed... one week.

36
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,960
This is good news, Mr. Powell,
but remember...

37
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,007
we have only
a single opportunity...

38
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,510
to retrieve the two halves
of the triangle.

39
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,978
And if we fail...

40
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:12,814
we must wait another 5,000 years.

41
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,546
I don't know about you,
but that's more time...

42
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,988
than I am prepared to commit
to this enterprise.

43
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,660
We shall be ready.

44
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,031
Trust me.

45
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,277
We're not...
We're not ready, are we?

46
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,715
Good morning, Lara.
And what a beautiful morning it is.

47
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,023
Back to work, I'm afraid.

48
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,395
It's adventure time.

49
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,066
Egypt again.

50
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,330
It's nothing but pyramids and sand.

51
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,396
I know.
Gets everywhere... in the cracks.

52
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,304
Spanish galleon?

53
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,743
Do you know what day
it is, Hillary?

54
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,254
Yes, of course.

55
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,016
The 15th.

56
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,427
And that is never a good day.

57
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,119
I miss you, Daddy.

58
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,959
I wish we could get back the time
that was stolen from us.

59
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,946
My father would love
to have seen this.

60
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,555
Tonight Pluto and Neptune
align with Uranus.

61
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,117
It's the first stage of
the alignment of all nine planets...

62
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,528
culminating
in a full solar eclipse.

63
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,692
It only happens
once every 5,000 years.

64
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,702
When is the eclipse?

65
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,238
One week from today.

66
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:51,174
But there is plenty
to look out for until then.

67
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,675
Incredible.

68
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,340
I wish you could remember her.
She loved you so much.

69
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,111
Mummy!

70
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,549
I wish I could remember her too.

71
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,455
I still have you, Daddy.

72
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,117
Yes, you do.

73
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,625
<i>The exact alignment of the planets</i>
<i>necessary to activate the triangle...</i>

74
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:55,470
only occurs once every 5,000 years.

75
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,908
But that will prove to be
just long enough...

76
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,641
for little Lara Croft to grow up...

77
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,706
<i>and to find it.</i>

78
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,571
Bryce!

79
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,037
Hello, fellas.

80
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,912
- How's business?
- Bryce!

81
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,283
Okay, okay.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

82
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,518
We have 83 rooms.
Why can't you live in the house?

83
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,389
Well, I'm a free spirit, me.

84
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,052
Right.

85
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,126
What's that smell?

86
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,031
5:00 a.m. Let's go.

87
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,500
This had better be good.

88
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,043
It's a clock.

89
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,912
I found it last night.
It was ticking.

90
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,249
Must be one of them
ticking clocks, eh?

91
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,320
It was hidden in a secret room.

92
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,690
Don't start.

93
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:11,396
Lara, it's a clock. It ticks.
It tells the time. It's wrong.

94
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,370
It started ticking...

95
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,203
last night during the first stage
of the alignment.

96
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,012
Well, gonna need some coffee.

97
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,051
Okay, in we go.

98
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,957
Looks pretty ordinary to me.

99
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,962
Well, keep looking.

100
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,459
Your coffee, sir.
Decaf latte with nonfat milk.

101
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,272
Oh, champion.
Steaming sump oil.

102
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,606
Wait. What did you do?

103
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,482
- I don't know. What did I do?
- Where is that?

104
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,920
I don't know. I just took
my hand off the fiber optics.

105
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,548
What is that?

106
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,425
- Oh, bugger!
- Bugger.

107
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,231
Screw 13 to quadrant four.

108
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,932
- Screw 14 to quadrant three.
- Oh, please.

109
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,971
It's my map,
so I know where they all came from.

110
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,072
It's camouflage.

111
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,618
Okay.

112
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,007
Hidden within.

113
00:17:58,677 --> 00:17:59,871
What is that?

114
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,184
The All Seeing Eye.

115
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:24,366
Lot 121, a Louis XV Ormolu
mounted bracket clock.

116
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,497
Showing on my left,
1,800,000 pounds.

117
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,805
1,800,000. Thank you.
One million eight. 1,900,000.

118
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,402
Two million pounds.
Two million pounds now.

119
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,474
2,100,000. 2,100,000 now.
2,100,000 pounds.

120
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,213
Any advance on 2,100,000 pounds?

121
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,882
Any more? Two million one.
2,200,000. Thank you, sir.

122
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,926
2,200,000 pounds now.

123
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,588
At 2,200,000.
2,300,000.

124
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,654
Two million three.
2,400,000.

125
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:58,294
Lady's bid, 2,400,000 pounds.
2,400,000.

126
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,065
Against you, sir.
Two million five? No.

127
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:05,600
2,400,000 pounds, then. Lady's bid
at two million four. 2,500,000.

128
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,340
In a new place at 2,500,000 pounds.

129
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,941
Any more at 2,500,000 pounds?

130
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,349
Sold.

131
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,222
Lara, my dear.

132
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,091
- Mr. Wilson.
- Come to my study. I'll take that.

133
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,858
Lara Croft. I don't believe it.

134
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,031
- I'll just be a minute.
- Hi.

135
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,934
You still pretending
to be a photojournalist?

136
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,808
You know, I think it's really cool
that you still have a day job...

137
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,874
even though it's obviously
just for show.

138
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,988
So, Alex, are you still pretending
to be an archaeologist?

139
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,685
Do we always have to
fight like this?

140
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,994
I mean, maybe we don't.

141
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,296
- Maybe we do.
- Why?

142
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,836
- You stole my prayer wheels.
- Stole? Stole?

143
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,872
From you? You know, that's funny.
You know, it's...

144
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,670
It's not like you ever
really owned them or anything.

145
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,641
Hey, you're the tomb raider.

146
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,908
Mr. West, we are ready for you.

147
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,008
Oh, I think your clients need you.

148
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,078
Go ahead.
You're wanted on the floor.

149
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:28,456
After all, as you said so memorably,
"It's all just a business."

150
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,927
Right?
So go do business.

151
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,520
Go.

152
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:01,351
Lara, this is a unique object.

153
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,190
Only one of the dials
is working.

154
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,699
It glows, like the eye, lesser.

155
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,734
But it seems
to be getting brighter.

156
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,736
And it's also
running backwards...

157
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:16,205
like it's not so much keeping time
but counting down to something.

158
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,209
- Yes.
- And look at the back.

159
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,974
It's as though it fits into
something, almost like a key.

160
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,316
Yes. Yes, fascinating.

161
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:32,221
- Incredibly beautiful.
- My father once told me...

162
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,657
of a magical triangle
stamped with the All Seeing Eye.

163
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,820
He said it gave its possessor
extraordinary power...

164
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,524
the power to control time.

165
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:44,558
He called it the Triangle of Light.
Have you heard of it?

166
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,695
No. No, I haven't.

167
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,843
He always steered his own course,
your father.

168
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,281
He was a great man.

169
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,588
Would you like some port?

170
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,217
- It's really very fine.
- No.

171
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,488
I can't help you, Lara.

172
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:15,124
This clock truly is a mystery.

173
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,154
- Hello.
- <i>Lara?</i>

174
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,156
Hello, it's Mr. Wilson.

175
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:43,092
Yes. Well, l...
You see, I had a second thought...

176
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,891
about that clock.

177
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,829
There is a man who
may be able to help you.

178
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,926
<i>I gave him your number.</i>
<i>His name is Manfred Powell.</i>

179
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,994
<i>You should see him.</i>

180
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,404
Thank you. I will.

181
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,205
- <i>Good-bye, Lara.</i>
- You take care.

182
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,972
<i>Thank you.</i>

183
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,907
Bugger.

184
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,892
Forgive me.

185
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,148
Lady Croft.

186
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,051
- Ah, Mr. Powell.
- Oh, no, no, no. Good heavens, no.

187
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,955
I'm actually
his associate, Mr. Pimms.

188
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,461
- Mr. Pimms?
- Yeah, like the beverage.

189
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,904
Yeah, she's here.

190
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,937
What does Mr. Powell do?

191
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,209
He's a lawyer.
I'm his law clerk...

192
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,481
and fairly recent appointment,
but enjoying it, all the varied work.

193
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,047
- A lawyer.
- Isn't it obvious?

194
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,060
Lady Croft, my pleasure.

195
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,098
- Manfred Powell, Q C.
- Good morning.

196
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,862
I believe you are quite an authority
on things ancient and mythological.

197
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,369
Well, I travel.

198
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,895
No, no, Mr. Wilson said you were
quite the archaeologist.

199
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,908
Please.

200
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,706
Oh, he's very sweet.

201
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,713
He knew your father, I believe.

202
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,011
Yes, they were great friends.

203
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:52,149
I had the honor of meeting him
myself once, in Venice.

204
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,523
I was so sorry
to hear about his death.

205
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,429
This is the clock I spoke of.

206
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,598
Very interesting.

207
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,035
It's a shame you
only brought photographs.

208
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,375
Nevertheless, it is fascinating.

209
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,318
You said it started ticking
the night of the alignment.

210
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,479
Yes.

211
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,524
- You said you were a lawyer?
- Yes.

212
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,656
And the study of clocks is a hobby?

213
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,827
This is an obsession.

214
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,838
Really my speciality. My practice
centers around antiquities.

215
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,001
But the origin of this clock...

216
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,441
completely eludes me.

217
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,611
I think I've never seen
anything quite so beautiful...

218
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,844
that I know so little about.

219
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,351
This is a pleasurable torment.

220
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,130
My ignorance amuses me.

221
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,467
"My ignorance amuses me."

222
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,837
Yes, well, I've always found
your ignorance quite amusing.

223
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,103
Powell, however, is not ignorant.

224
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,981
He's a liar.

225
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,157
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Hillary.

226
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:43,223
- Don't you stay up too late.
- I won't.

227
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,910
<i>Forward team, wait for my command.</i>

228
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,711
<i>In position awaiting your order.</i>

229
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,867
Bastards!

230
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,096
Bloody hell!

231
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,174
<i>On the left.</i>
<i>On the left.</i>

232
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,030
Come on, Simon!

233
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:41,907
Bugger!

234
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,849
<i>Lara, Lara, are you there?</i>
<i>Pick up!</i>

235
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,417
<i>Lara, can you hear me?</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

236
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,730
<i>I'm in the equipment room.</i>
<i>They're stealing my bloody clock.</i>

237
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,096
I know. I saw them.

238
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,136
- You have to be my eyes.
- Are you armed?

239
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,177
After a fashion, yes.

240
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,509
All right.
Three bad guys.

241
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,674
Number one standing
by the Aston Martin.

242
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,774
Right.

243
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,721
Bingo!

244
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,032
- Next.
- Okay, number two...

245
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,041
<i>crouched by the McLaren.</i>

246
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,040
Oh, bugger!

247
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,317
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- I just found my car keys.

248
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,039
You're done, mate.
Nice one.

249
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,012
I think they've all gone.

250
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,226
They got what they came for.

251
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,695
Sorry about that.

252
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,363
That's fine.

253
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,103
Hello?

254
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,244
What the hell happened here?

255
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,259
- Morning.
- Lady Lara Croft?

256
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,853
Yes. You have something for me?

257
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,066
I woke up this morning,
and I just hated everything.

258
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,272
Right. Thanks.

259
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:57,251
Who's Stribling, Clive
and Winterset then?

260
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,313
- Sounds like a bunch of lawyers.
- They are a bunch of lawyers.

261
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:05,417
- Well, I'll shut my face again.
- You are nosy.

262
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,623
I'm not nosy.
I just saw the name.

263
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:11,134
It was a funny name.
I just asked her what the name was.

264
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,397
It's from my father.

265
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,141
It was written before he died...

266
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,978
and delivered today
as per his instructions.

267
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,950
- Blimey!
- Holy sh...

268
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:40,096
"To see a world
in a grain of sand...

269
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,792
and a heaven in a wild flower...

270
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,530
hold infinity
in the palm of your hand...

271
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,765
and eternity in an hour."

272
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,831
William Blake.

273
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,002
The All Seeing Eye.

274
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,025
<i>My darling daughter...</i>

275
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,293
<i>I knew you'd figure this out.</i>

276
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,028
<i>If you are reading this letter,</i>
<i>I am no longer with you...</i>

277
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,036
<i>and I miss you...</i>

278
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,130
and love you always and forever.

279
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:59,404
It also means I have failed...

280
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,913
and must place an awful burden
on your shoulders.

281
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,350
<i>Lara, by now I am sure you will have</i>
<i>discovered the clock I concealed.</i>

282
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:12,048
<i>The clock is the key, Lara.</i>

283
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:17,117
<i>It will unlock the hiding place</i>
<i>of two pieces of a sacred icon.</i>

284
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:21,028
<i>This is the magical triangle I told</i>
<i>you about when you were little.</i>

285
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:25,899
The Triangle of Light.
But it is no bedtime story.

286
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,736
<i>The triangle was forged from metal</i>
<i>found in the crater of a meteor...</i>

287
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,832
<i>that had fallen to Earth</i>
<i>at the exact moment...</i>

288
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,844
<i>of the previous alignment</i>
<i>of the nine planets.</i>

289
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,540
<i>The people of the light built</i>
<i>a great city in this crater...</i>

290
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,551
<i>where they worshipped the triangle</i>
<i>for its ability to control time.</i>

291
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:46,181
<i>It gave its possessor a power that</i>
<i>could be used for good or great evil.</i>

292
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:49,784
<i>An abuse of this power led</i>
<i>to the destruction of the city.</i>

293
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,396
<i>To be sure no man would</i>
<i>ever again wield this power...</i>

294
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,662
<i>they split the triangle</i>
<i>into two pieces...</i>

295
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,103
<i>and hid them at opposite ends</i>
<i>of the Earth.</i>

296
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:06,405
<i>Lara, do you remember thejasmine</i>
<i>that only grows in one temple...</i>

297
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,310
<i>along the ancient Khmer trail</i>
<i>in Cambodia?</i>

298
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,314
<i>Find that and you will</i>
<i>have found the entrance...</i>

299
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,680
<i>to the Tomb of the Dancing Light...</i>

300
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,743
<i>where the first half</i>
<i>of the triangle is hidden.</i>

301
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,517
<i>You must be there</i>
<i>at the exact moment...</i>

302
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,855
of the second phase
of the planetary alignment.

303
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,828
<i>You must hurry.</i>
<i>You have very little time.</i>

304
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,921
<i>And as the planets</i>
<i>move into alignment...</i>

305
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,466
<i>the world will be</i>
<i>in great danger...</i>

306
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,300
<i>for the secret society</i>
<i>known as the Illuminati...</i>

307
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,932
<i>devious, dangerous men...</i>

308
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,975
<i>who seek to fulfill</i>
<i>an ancient prophecy...</i>

309
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,443
<i>by reuniting the two halves...</i>

310
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:46,472
<i>and attaining the triangle's</i>
<i>awesome and terrible powers.</i>

311
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,577
<i>This you must prevent</i>
<i>at all costs.</i>

312
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:55,023
<i>So, Lara, I am asking you</i>
<i>to complete my work...</i>

313
00:39:55,092 --> 00:40:00,120
<i>to find and destroy</i>
<i>both halves of the triangle.</i>

314
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:07,668
How are you going to get to Cambodia
and get the clock back in 15 hours?

315
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,831
I'll be calling in a favor.

316
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,173
- What kind of favor?
- Well, that is a secret.

317
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,941
If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

318
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,749
<i>Lady Croft, are you on target? Over.</i>

319
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,727
Right on target.
Thank you, boys. Over and out.

320
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,405
How predictable.

321
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,908
Alex West.

322
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,380
What are you doing here?

323
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:09,122
We have <i>7</i>2 minutes
to the next alignment.

324
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,127
We have to work faster.

325
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,632
Come on, guys!

326
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,207
Come on, guys! Come on. Pull!

327
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,544
Pull! It's coming!

328
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,094
Good.

329
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:57,266
So, any sign of Lady Croft?

330
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,494
Not yet.

331
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:02,130
Lara's overrated.
She's good, don't get me wrong...

332
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,902
but she's in it for the glory...

333
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,170
whereas I'm in it for the money.

334
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:09,508
Fortunately.

335
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,209
- Into the belly of the beast.
- And out of the demon's ass.

336
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,447
Jasmine.

337
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,117
Remember, what we are looking for
is hidden not only in space...

338
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,629
but also in time.

339
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,594
The clock is the key.

340
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,643
My God.

341
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:39,082
"Return the iron to
the stone's embrace...

342
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,249
the wheel of heaven will turn.

343
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,953
Exhume the light
from its watery grave...

344
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:48,328
to receive the gift of heaven...

345
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:51,526
as you are condemned
to the depths of hell."

346
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:56,800
Right. Pretty much touch anything
and you get your head chopped off.

347
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,003
We have two minutes, Mr. West.

348
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:04,514
You're the tomb raider.
Figure it out.

349
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,861
<i>Tempus fugit.</i>

350
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,902
Yes, "time flies."

351
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,062
It's the swords!

352
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:32,370
Come on, guys. Get up here.
Give me a hand here.

353
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,138
That's it. Come on.
Coming down.

354
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,276
I want them all down.

355
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:45,219
Take them, carry them
across the ladders.

356
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,847
Let's hustle.

357
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:53,457
All right. Now slide them
into the slots over there.

358
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,899
We place the clock here
at the exact moment of alignment.

359
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,334
Come on. Let's go! Move it!

360
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,340
Too slow, ladies, too slow.
Come on.

361
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,916
- That's it.
- Count it down.

362
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,516
- The timing needs to be exact.
- No shit.

363
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,008
Sixty seconds to go.

364
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,540
59, 58...

365
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,018
5<i>7</i>, 56...

366
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:54,751
55, 54...

367
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,591
53, 52, 51...

368
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,687
fifty seconds.

369
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,703
Cease fire!
Hold your fire!

370
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,877
- Keep counting.
- You're making a big mistake!

371
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,781
41, 40...

372
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,252
39, 38...

373
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,982
- 3<i>7</i>...
- Tourist visa?

374
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:29,219
- No, I'm working.
- Lady Croft, tell me...

375
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,283
is there a good reason
why I kept you alive?

376
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:35,092
Yes. That is not the true eye.

377
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:39,226
- This is the true eye.
- It's not, actually.

378
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:40,394
It's a mirror image.

379
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,803
I think you're trying to cheat me
out of my little ray of sunshine.

380
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,808
Why would I try and cheat you
out of anything now?

381
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,902
I need you to get the piece
so I can steal it from you later.

382
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:51,072
You're bluffing.
Julius, make a mental note...

383
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,582
Kill Miss Croft
if she attempts any such thing.

384
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,914
Yes, sir, Mr. Powell.

385
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:59,513
We can do it my way, or we can come
back in time for the next alignment...

386
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,648
and you are welcome
to try and kill me then.

387
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,853
In, oh, say
another 5,000 years.

388
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:13,002
12, 11...

389
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,799
ten...

390
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:17,362
nine, eight...

391
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:22,811
seven, six, five...

392
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,383
four, three...

393
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,051
two, one...

394
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:34,813
zero.

395
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,062
I guess she was right.

396
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,568
The log must pierce the urn.

397
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,739
Come on!

398
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,416
It's slowing down.
It's never gonna make it.

399
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,867
Pure light, fire and water.

400
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,433
Get the clock.

401
00:54:30,502 --> 00:54:32,527
Got it.

402
00:59:32,437 --> 00:59:34,371
Hold it right there!

403
00:59:38,176 --> 00:59:40,167
Give it up.

404
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:43,270
Are you going to shoot me, Alex?

405
01:00:42,874 --> 01:00:44,933
My phone is wet.

406
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,817
Yes?

407
01:00:56,888 --> 01:00:58,446
Lady Croft, how are you?

408
01:00:58,523 --> 01:01:00,115
Alive.

409
01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:02,489
And kicking, I hope.

410
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,687
- <i>And you?</i>
- Superlative.

411
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:08,323
<i>Of course, I digress.</i>
<i>You have my half of the triangle.</i>

412
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:10,594
And you have
my father's clock.

413
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:13,967
Listen, my dear. Without each other
we are quite useless at this point.

414
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,836
<i>We should reevaluate</i>
<i>our positions.</i>

415
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:19,502
<i>Like it or not,</i>
<i>you and I are in business together.</i>

416
01:01:19,577 --> 01:01:21,101
We should have
a business meeting.

417
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:25,616
You mean you'd love to have another
opportunity to try and kill me.

418
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:28,379
Oh, that's harsh.

419
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:31,785
But perhaps.
Wait and see.

420
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:34,984
Come to Venice,
Via Dolorosa.

421
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:37,459
Wonderful. Bye then.

422
01:01:41,332 --> 01:01:43,562
Harder.

423
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:48,967
<i>Here it comes. Hide, everybody.</i>

424
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,634
<i>Look out.</i>
<i>It's some sort of machine.</i>

425
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:55,604
<i>Bryce, it's me.</i>

426
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,275
- Hello?
- <i>It's Lara. I found the temple.</i>

427
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,910
- <i>Ran into Mr. Powell.</i>
- Did you get the clock?

428
01:02:01,986 --> 01:02:04,648
No, but I got the first piece.

429
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:06,849
Oh, beautiful, smashing.

430
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:09,688
Seems I'm level pegging
with Mr. Powell.

431
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,887
- Won't he just want to kill you now?
<i>- No, silly.</i>

432
01:02:11,963 --> 01:02:15,262
His problem is that he needs
the piece that I have.

433
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:18,302
Until then,
I'm his new best friend.

434
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:20,860
<i>What about the other half?</i>
<i>The final alignment...</i>

435
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:24,203
is in 66 hours and 53 minutes,
and we've still got no idea...

436
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:26,971
<i>where the second piece is hidden.</i>

437
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:29,512
He's going to tell me
where the second piece is.

438
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,913
- He will?
- <i>Bryce, trust me. Pack for Venice.</i>

439
01:02:32,984 --> 01:02:35,748
<i>Pack for where? Hello? Lara?</i>

440
01:02:38,656 --> 01:02:39,918
Bye then.

441
01:03:09,687 --> 01:03:11,552
Drink.

442
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:16,122
Rest.

443
01:03:17,895 --> 01:03:19,988
There's no rest
for the wicked.

444
01:03:20,064 --> 01:03:23,227
You got what you came for?

445
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:25,394
- I did, yes.
- Too bad.

446
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,437
Bad for the world.

447
01:03:27,505 --> 01:03:29,496
The world is safe now.

448
01:03:30,675 --> 01:03:33,974
Little bit safer,
perhaps...

449
01:03:34,045 --> 01:03:36,240
because you will go on.

450
01:03:36,314 --> 01:03:38,942
Your father said
you will never give up.

451
01:03:39,016 --> 01:03:42,508
My father?
You knew my father?

452
01:03:43,788 --> 01:03:45,119
Now, drink.

453
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:46,952
Finish your tea.

454
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:53,525
It tastes quite bad,
but it is good for you.

455
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:55,155
See?

456
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,506
Good evening.

457
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:42,209
You're with the Illuminati.

458
01:04:45,483 --> 01:04:46,848
Beg your pardon?

459
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:50,478
There's no such thing.
It's just a bedtime story.

460
01:04:57,628 --> 01:04:59,493
Illuminati...

461
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:02,565
The people of the light.

462
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:07,093
Have you brought my triangle?

463
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:11,073
No, of course you haven't.
You've hidden it somewhere.

464
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,712
You can keep
the triangle you have...

465
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:19,409
and I will keep your father's clock,
and we can be partners.

466
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:21,212
Who sits here?

467
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,782
We can be partners
and go for the big prize...

468
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:28,188
the Triangle of Light.

469
01:05:28,259 --> 01:05:31,456
Yes, but who sits here?

470
01:05:31,529 --> 01:05:36,057
It's an incredible dream,
an awesome power.

471
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:38,067
It could set right
so many wrongs.

472
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:42,265
I don't think you sit here,
do you?

473
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:54,614
I sit here...

474
01:05:56,554 --> 01:05:58,988
on God's right hand,
as it were.

475
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,220
In fact...

476
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:05,820
I now sit exactly
where your father sat.

477
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:12,132
You're lying.

478
01:06:14,572 --> 01:06:17,439
No, he mentored me
in the order.

479
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:20,910
It was truly an honor.

480
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:24,046
I don't believe you.

481
01:06:25,516 --> 01:06:27,143
My father was not
with the Illuminati.

482
01:06:27,218 --> 01:06:29,686
- He would have told me.
- He had a great many secrets.

483
01:06:33,524 --> 01:06:35,458
Not from me.

484
01:06:35,526 --> 01:06:37,790
Especially from you.

485
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,990
I know what you want, Lara.

486
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:46,593
Oh, I doubt it.

487
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,477
Another life with your father...

488
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:01,984
a second chance.

489
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:04,543
It'll be within my power
to give.

490
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:09,589
The triangle gives
its possessor...

491
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,525
the power of God...

492
01:07:11,595 --> 01:07:16,623
to move back and forth
through time, undo the past.

493
01:07:17,902 --> 01:07:21,895
Help me, and you will get
what I know you want...

494
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:25,373
to have your father
returned to you.

495
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:32,172
And how do I know
once I gave you that piece...

496
01:07:32,249 --> 01:07:34,513
that you wouldn't then
just try to kill me?

497
01:07:37,955 --> 01:07:40,924
Would it make it easier
for you...

498
01:07:40,991 --> 01:07:45,360
on more familiar ground...
if I killed you now?

499
01:07:47,164 --> 01:07:48,825
Will you reconsider?

500
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:52,726
- Hello, Alex.
- I suppose you think...

501
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,661
I'm a greedy,
unscrupulous sellout...

502
01:08:54,732 --> 01:08:57,667
- and do about anything for money.
- Yes, that's right.

503
01:08:59,003 --> 01:09:00,937
Well, the money bit's true,
I guess.

504
01:09:06,043 --> 01:09:08,068
Is it, Alex?

505
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:12,104
If you cross me, we may not
be able to remain friends.

506
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,981
Always a pleasure.

507
01:09:22,092 --> 01:09:24,026
Now for a cold shower.

508
01:09:24,094 --> 01:09:26,289
I think we're in big trouble.

509
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:28,593
- Hold this, will you?
- Thank you.

510
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:31,897
They already think we have
Lady Croft's piece of the triangle.

511
01:09:31,969 --> 01:09:35,405
Yes. They think it's in that box
you're carrying right now.

512
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:38,202
Is it?

513
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:39,708
Why don't you
worry about something else?

514
01:09:39,777 --> 01:09:41,836
Of course it's not.

515
01:09:41,912 --> 01:09:46,110
I don't understand. What chance
of success do we have without it?

516
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,674
Zero. Don't dwell on it.

517
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:50,481
But...

518
01:09:57,227 --> 01:09:59,320
What a nice surprise.

519
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:03,599
Thank you.

520
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:09,204
Now, time to save the universe
again then, is it?

521
01:10:09,273 --> 01:10:10,706
Absolutely.

522
01:10:45,275 --> 01:10:48,733
Are we sure
she's really necessary?

523
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:51,906
Well, one tomb raider
is good. Two, better.

524
01:11:00,691 --> 01:11:04,183
Me bum's gone to sleep again,
all down the left cheek.

525
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:07,128
Really?
That's fascinating.

526
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:15,129
- How much longer?
- A few hours.

527
01:11:15,205 --> 01:11:17,639
We have to take
the last hour over land.

528
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:21,041
Helicopters won't
fly near the ruined city.

529
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:23,136
It's a dead zone.

530
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,613
We take all doggies.

531
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:11,026
Much-o U.S. Greenback.

532
01:12:12,563 --> 01:12:14,087
All doggies.

533
01:14:06,977 --> 01:14:09,138
Welcome to the dead zone.

534
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:27,260
It's not a country.
It's an ice cube!

535
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,292
Come on!

536
01:16:01,124 --> 01:16:03,251
All right. Let's go.

537
01:16:56,546 --> 01:16:58,571
Go on, get it!

538
01:17:05,222 --> 01:17:06,712
Holy shit.

539
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:13,058
It's a time storm.
Time is broken here.

540
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:16,998
We must find the eye!
All of you! Hurry!

541
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:20,298
We're running out of time!
Hurry! Hurry!

542
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:40,912
It's begun.

543
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:46,860
Fifty bucks says
the piece is inside the sun.

544
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:34,369
For God's sake, hurry! The eclipse
will be over in a few minutes!

545
01:18:42,219 --> 01:18:44,915
Give me the clock.
I know what to do.

546
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:41,071
Has she got the piece?

547
01:19:50,854 --> 01:19:52,446
We will now...

548
01:19:52,522 --> 01:19:54,888
unite these two parts...

549
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:59,292
the past and the present.

550
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:03,264
At last,
we of the Illuminati...

551
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:06,302
will control time and fulfill
the sacred promise...

552
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:08,837
to our ancestors.

553
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:14,172
- Soon, the entire world will bow...
- Enough of this twaddle.

554
01:20:18,581 --> 01:20:20,606
Come on! Come on!

555
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:49,936
Not quite what you hoped for,
Mr. Powell?

556
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,650
I have a gut instinct
about this.

557
01:21:01,358 --> 01:21:04,452
After all, you are
the daughter of a genius.

558
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:06,995
Let me test my theory.

559
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:02,513
You had to let him go.
No more bubbles.

560
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:04,450
You show me
how to complete the triangle...

561
01:22:04,521 --> 01:22:06,512
we can change his fate.

562
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:12,026
If you deliver me the power of God,
I will spare him.

563
01:22:12,095 --> 01:22:14,029
It's only a little trip
back in time.

564
01:22:15,832 --> 01:22:19,598
But I'm pretty sure you've figured
out the answer to the problem.

565
01:22:21,638 --> 01:22:25,074
And then, of course,
there's the loss of your father.

566
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:27,371
I can change that.

567
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:42,555
You'd better be ready
for this.

568
01:22:48,064 --> 01:22:51,932
- Unhook your laser sight.
- Do it.

569
01:23:29,038 --> 01:23:31,836
"To see a world
in a grain of sand."

570
01:24:04,574 --> 01:24:06,007
Daddy?

571
01:24:15,118 --> 01:24:17,052
Is this real?

572
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:20,648
It is a crossing...

573
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:22,850
of my past and your present.

574
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,255
Why did you not tell me
about the Illuminati?

575
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:28,422
You were only a child.

576
01:24:28,498 --> 01:24:30,489
You could have written
in your journals.

577
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:34,094
- You never mentioned it... not once.
- I burst to tell you everything.

578
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:36,730
But in the fierceness
of my own battles...

579
01:24:36,806 --> 01:24:40,503
I strove to tell you
only that which would inspire you...

580
01:24:40,577 --> 01:24:42,169
and keep you safe.

581
01:24:43,112 --> 01:24:45,046
I love you so much.

582
01:24:46,482 --> 01:24:47,949
But I've missed you.

583
01:24:49,385 --> 01:24:51,615
And I have missed you.

584
01:24:54,023 --> 01:24:56,355
I know why you came here...

585
01:24:56,426 --> 01:24:59,691
why you took the power of the
light... but this must not happen.

586
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:03,994
Why? Why can't we use
the power just this once?

587
01:25:05,368 --> 01:25:06,960
Why can't you stay?

588
01:25:07,036 --> 01:25:10,870
We can't change time.

589
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,875
But time was stolen from us...

590
01:25:15,612 --> 01:25:17,546
and it's not fair.

591
01:25:17,614 --> 01:25:20,913
No, it's not fair.

592
01:25:20,984 --> 01:25:23,043
But you have stolen
time itself...

593
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:27,078
and you must give it back.

594
01:25:27,156 --> 01:25:29,488
You must destroy the triangle.

595
01:25:32,295 --> 01:25:35,128
Suddenly I feel so alone.

596
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:40,830
You're never alone. I am with you
always, just as I've always been.

597
01:27:23,005 --> 01:27:24,336
Move out!

598
01:27:36,419 --> 01:27:37,886
Wait!

599
01:27:39,188 --> 01:27:40,883
Your father begged for his life...

600
01:27:40,957 --> 01:27:43,118
when we caught him betraying us.

601
01:27:43,192 --> 01:27:46,184
He pleaded like a baby.

602
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:47,524
Surrender.

603
01:27:49,465 --> 01:27:51,456
Never.

604
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:58,867
He seemed particularly concerned
that I shouldn't take this.

605
01:28:04,614 --> 01:28:07,105
Lara, no!
The place is coming down!

606
01:28:07,183 --> 01:28:10,209
- This is insane!
- Get them out of here.

607
01:28:15,725 --> 01:28:17,386
You just hurry.

608
01:28:29,038 --> 01:28:30,801
There you go...

609
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:33,000
safe and sound.

610
01:28:43,419 --> 01:28:44,681
No guns.

611
01:31:42,832 --> 01:31:44,993
Oh, my God!

612
01:31:47,336 --> 01:31:48,769
Quiet.

613
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:22,662
What?
