1
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,900
<i>... and I'll tell you what,</i>
<i>the storm system's still moving west.</i>

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What are you looking at, Caroline?

3
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,600
The wind, Mom.

4
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,100
They say the hurricane is coming.

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm on a boat.

6
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,300
I'm drifting.

7
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,000
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

8
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,200
Make anything easier?

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,600
Oh, sugar...

10
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,400
There's nothing left to do.

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,500
Is what it is.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open.

13
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,100
My mouth's full of cotton.

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,700
There, there, Miss Daisy.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,600
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,300
Do you want any more
medication, Mother?

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,400
Doctor said you could have
as much as you want.

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,700
No need for anybody to suffer.

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,600
A friend told me
that she never had the chance

20
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,000
to say goodbye to her mother.

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,500
- I wanted to...
- It's okay.

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,100
I wanted to tell you
how much I'm gonna miss you so...

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,700
Mom.

24
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,500
Oh, Caroline.

25
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,800
Are you afraid?

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,600
I'm curious.

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,000
What comes next?

28
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,300
They built the train station in 1918.

29
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,100
My father was there the day it opened.

30
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,400
He said they had

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,700
a tuba band playing.

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,500
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

33
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,900
to build that glorious clock.

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
<i>His name was...</i>

35
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,100
Mr. Gateau.

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
Mr. Cake.

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,300
<i>He was married to a Creole</i>
<i>of Evangeline Parish</i>

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,700
<i>and they had a son.</i>

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,700
<i>Mr. Gateau was, from birth,</i>
<i>absolutely blind.</i>

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,200
<i>When their son was old enough,</i>
<i>he joined the army.</i>

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,500
<i>And they prayed God would</i>
<i>keep him out of harm's way.</i>

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,200
<i>For months,</i>
<i>he did nothing but work on that clock.</i>

43
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
<i>One day,</i>

44
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,000
<i>a letter came.</i>

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,000
<i>And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,</i>

46
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,200
<i>went up, alone, to bed.</i>

47
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
<i>And their son came home.</i>

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,600
<i>They buried him in the family plot,</i>

49
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,600
<i>where he would be with them</i>
<i>when their time came.</i>

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,700
<i>Mr. Cake worked on his clock,</i>

51
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,200
<i>laboring to finish.</i>

52
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,400
<i>It was a morning to remember.</i>

53
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,900
<i>Papa said</i>
<i>there were people everywhere.</i>

54
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,900
<i>Even Teddy Roosevelt came.</i>

55
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,500
It's running backwards!

56
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,900
I made it that way

57
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,300
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war

58
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,800
might stand and come home again.

59
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,100
<i>Home to farm,</i>

60
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
<i>work,</i>

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,700
<i>have children.</i>

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
<i>To live long, full lives.</i>

63
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,400
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,600
I'm sorry if I've offended anybody.

65
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,400
I hope you enjoy my clock.

66
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,200
<i>Mr. Cake was never seen again.</i>

67
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,000
<i>Some say he died of a broken heart.</i>

68
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,000
<i>Some say he went to sea.</i>

69
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,300
Excuse me.

70
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,000
Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

71
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,300
Sure.

72
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,800
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

73
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,000
You couldn't disappoint me.

74
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,300
Well, I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

75
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,300
Find my dark suitcase.

76
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,600
There's a diary.

77
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
This?

78
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,500
Could you read it to me?

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,300
Is this what you want to do?

80
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,300
I tried to read it
a hundred different times.

81
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,200
Mom, it's not exactly...

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,800
It's just the sound of your voice, darling.

83
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,600
Okay.

84
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,700
It's dated April 4th, 1985.

85
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,200
And it says New Orleans.

86
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,000
"This is my last will and testament.

87
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,300
"I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money, really.

88
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,900
"I will go out of this world the same way
I came in, alone and with nothing.

89
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,500
"All I have is my story,

90
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,000
"and I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

91
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,000
"My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button."

92
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,400
<i>And I was born under</i>
<i>unusual circumstances.</i>

93
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,600
<i>The First World War had ended,</i>

94
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,200
<i>and I've been told it was</i>
<i>an especially good night to be born.</i>

95
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,000
Thank God it's over!

96
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,900
We won the war!

97
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
The Great War is over!

98
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
What are you doing here?

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,300
Thomas,

100
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm afraid she's going to die.

101
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,300
What?

102
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,100
That's enough.
All of you, get away from her.

103
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,400
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

104
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,800
Thomas.

105
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,900
Promise me he has a place.

106
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,400
Yeah.

107
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
<i>She gave her life for me.</i>

108
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
<i>And for that, I am forever grateful.</i>

109
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,800
Mr. Button.

110
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,300
Thomas!

111
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,700
Thomas.

112
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,800
Thomas? Where are you going?

113
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,800
Hey! What are you doing there?

114
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,100
What do you have there?

115
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,100
- Come on, Queenie.
- Now, Mr. Weathers!

116
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,500
Come on, now, you know I ain't got
nothing but work to do around here.

117
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,900
- Come on. Just take some time.
- Stop all this foolishness.

118
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,900
The air is sweet.

119
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,400
You look very handsome tonight,
Miss Queenie.

120
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,800
Handsome as I've ever seen.

121
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,500
The brown matches your eyes.

122
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, hush!

123
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,600
Let's see here.
You ain't no slouch yourself.

124
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,900
Hambert's back in town.

125
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,800
He came home legless, but he's home.

126
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,400
I know you were sweet on him one time.

127
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,900
Sweeter than I should've been.

128
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,900
Miss Simone messed herself.

129
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
Oh, sweet Jesus.

130
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,800
She got to stop doing that
or it's diapers for her.

131
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,000
- I'll be right there, Miss Jameson!
- Now, Queenie, now come on.

132
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,600
Okay, Queenie'll be right there.

133
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,000
It's awful nice out here.

134
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,300
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

135
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
You're so bad.

136
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
- What in God's name?
- What's this?

137
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,600
Oh, the Lord done something here.

138
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,200
Hope I didn't hurt it none
stepping on it like that.

139
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,800
We best leave that for the police.

140
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,400
Poor baby.

141
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,600
I'll go.

142
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,000
It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it.
Come on, baby.

143
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,100
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

144
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,100
Hold your water! You go deal with it.

145
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,300
Okay. No, go, I'll be back.

146
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,400
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed
herself all over again!

147
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,400
Jane Childress, start her a bath!

148
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,600
And mind your own business,
Mrs. Duprey.

149
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,500
You'll be messing yourself
soon enough.

150
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,100
Somebody stole my necklace.

151
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,200
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I'll be right with you, okay?

152
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,500
Go on back upstairs, hear?

153
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,300
You are as ugly as an old pot

154
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,100
but you're still a child of God.

155
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,600
Queenie, Apple,
she won't take a bath without you!

156
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,100
Mercy.

157
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I'll be right there!

158
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Okay. You just wait right here
for me now, okay?

159
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,100
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

160
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,100
- Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
- They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

161
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,500
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

162
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,200
- Is Dr. Rose still here?
- I don't know.

163
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,300
Your heart is strong.

164
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,400
You just want to avoid
any undue stimulation.

165
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,100
I trust you ladies
will help me out with that?

166
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,300
I have something.
Could you come downstairs?

167
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,700
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

168
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,900
I'm not sure if he can hear.
His bones indicate severe arthritis.

169
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,100
His skin has lost all elasticity,
and his hands and feet are ossified.

170
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,800
He shows all the deterioration,
the infirmities, not of a newborn,

171
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,500
but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave.

172
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
He's dying?

173
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,000
His body is failing him
before his life's begun.

174
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,800
Where'd he come from?

175
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,200
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

176
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,300
The poor child, he got the worst of it.
Come out white.

177
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,900
There are places for unwanted babies
like these, Queenie.

178
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,200
No room for another mouth to feed here.

179
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,800
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

180
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,700
thinks this place is
a large nuisance as it is.

181
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:22,900
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

182
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,000
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

183
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,600
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

184
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,800
No, this baby, he is a miracle.
That's for certain.

185
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

186
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,400
Y'all listen. Y'all listen up here.

187
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
We're gonna have us a visitor

188
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,400
that's gonna be staying with us
for a little while.

189
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,200
My sister had a child
and she couldn't see right by it, so...

190
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,200
He's known as...

191
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,800
Benjamin.

192
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,800
Benjamin.

193
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,600
He's not a well child, so we're gonna
have to take good care of him.

194
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,800
I had 10 children.

195
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,200
There's not a baby I can't care for.
Let me see him.

196
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,100
God in Heaven.
He looks just like my ex-husband.

197
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,500
Look, he's prematurely old.

198
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,600
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more
time on this earth.

199
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,000
Join the club.

200
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,600
He's smiling!

201
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,000
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

202
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,200
Are you right out of your mind?

203
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,900
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

204
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,200
but this ain't yours to keep.

205
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,600
It may not even be humankind.

206
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,100
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

207
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,700
Please.

208
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,600
You never know what's coming for you.

209
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,000
<i>It seemed I had found a home.</i>

210
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Is any of this true?

211
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,700
You have such a lovely voice.

212
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,900
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token.

213
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,800
That clock just kept going,

214
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,000
year after year after year.

215
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,200
<i>But I didn't know I was a child.</i>

216
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,800
Same old crap every day.

217
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,400
<i>I thought I was like everyone else there.</i>

218
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,600
<i>An old man in the twilight of his life.</i>

219
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,000
Could you make him stop that?

220
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,100
Stop banging that fork.
It's used for eating, not for playing with.

221
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,000
And use your napkin, please,
Mr. Benjamin.

222
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,700
Queenie!

223
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,000
Hey, boy.

224
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,700
<i>Always had a healthy curiosity.</i>

225
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,400
<i>What was up the street?</i>
<i>Or around the next corner?</i>

226
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,500
Go get him!

227
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,300
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here.

228
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,800
Stay put, child.

229
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,100
<i>I loved her very much.</i>

230
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,500
<i>She was my mother.</i>

231
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,800
Mama.

232
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,600
Mama.

233
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,200
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

234
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Everybody feels different about
themselves, one way or another.

235
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,000
But we're all going the same way.

236
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,000
Just taking different roads to get there,
that's all.

237
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,600
You're on your own road, Benjamin.

238
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,000
Mama? How much longer I got?

239
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,800
Just be thankful
for what you're given, hear?

240
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,000
You're already here longer
than you're supposed to.

241
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,800
<i>Some nights, I'd have to sleep alone.</i>

242
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,200
<i>I didn't mind.</i>

243
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,800
<i>I would listen to the house breathing.</i>

244
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,100
<i>All those people sleeping.</i>

245
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,700
<i>I felt safe.</i>

246
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,200
<i>It was a place of great routine.</i>

247
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,200
<i>Every morning at 5:30,</i>
<i>no matter the weather,</i>

248
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,400
<i>General Winslow, U.S. Army, Retired,</i>
<i>would raise the flag.</i>

249
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,200
<i>Mrs. Sybil Wagner,</i>
<i>once an opera singer of some note,</i>

250
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,900
<i>well, she sang Wagner.</i>

251
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,200
All right, baby, come on.

252
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,100
We got to put some life
into these old sticks for you.

253
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,500
Get you walking so you can help me out
around here. Come on now, hear?

254
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,500
<i>No matter the season,</i>
<i>supper was served promptly at 5:30.</i>

255
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,700
Molasses.

256
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,100
Molasses.

257
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,900
Molasses.

258
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,400
I learned to read when I was five.

259
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,900
My grandfather was a dresser
for a famous actor.

260
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,700
He brung home every play
for me to read.

261
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,700
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,

262
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,200
"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

263
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,700
"Even like a man
new haled from the rack,

264
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,500
"So fare my limbs
with long imprisonment.

265
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,900
"And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

266
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,500
"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer."

267
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,800
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

268
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,500
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

269
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,200
The actor my grandfather worked for
was John Wilkes Booth.

270
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

271
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,900
You never know what's coming for you.

272
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,200
<i>On Saturday nights,</i>
<i>Mama would make me go to church.</i>

273
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Benjamin!

274
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,300
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

275
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,300
What can I do for you, sister?

276
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,600
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

277
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

278
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,600
so she can bear the fruit of the womb.

279
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,100
Out, damnable affliction!

280
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,400
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

281
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,700
Hallelujah!

282
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

283
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,000
And what's this old man's irrediction?

284
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,200
He's got the Devil on his back,

285
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,500
trying to ride him into the grave
before his time.

286
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,300
- Out, Zebuchar!
- Yes!

287
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,200
- Out, Beelzebub!
- Yes!

288
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,800
How old are you?

289
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,400
Seven. But I look a lot older.

290
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,000
God bless you.

291
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,100
He's seven.

292
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,800
Now, this is a man
with optimism in his heart.

293
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,600
- All right.
- Belief in his soul!

294
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
- Yes!
- Yes!

295
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,600
We are all children in the eyes of God!

296
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,000
- Yes!
- Hallelujah!

297
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,000
We are gonna get you out of that chair.

298
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
- And we're gonna have you walk.
- Amen.

299
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,600
It's all right.

300
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,700
In the name of God's glory...

301
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,000
Rise up!

302
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,900
Come on.

303
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,500
Come on. Walk.

304
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
Come on, son. Come on.

305
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,900
- Come on with it, son. Come on.
- Come on.

306
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,300
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

307
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,200
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

308
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,100
He's gonna see that you walk
from faith...

309
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,200
- Hallelujah!
...and divine inspiration alone!

310
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,500
- Yes.
- Hey, Ben!

311
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,900
- Go, son!
- Now walk.

312
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
- Yes.
- Come on.

313
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,000
Don't touch him.

314
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,100
Rise up, old man.

315
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,700
Rise up like Lazarus.

316
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,000
I said, rise up!

317
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,000
Hallelujah!

318
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,400
Yes.

319
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,000
Come on.

320
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,100
Say hallelujah.

321
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,600
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

322
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,500
Walk.

323
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,400
Walk on. Yes.

324
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
That's right, Benjamin.

325
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,600
<i>Now when I look back on it,</i>
<i>it was miraculous.</i>

326
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,800
<i>But you know the saying, the Lord</i>
<i>giveth and the Lord taketh away.</i>

327
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,900
Glory in the highest!

328
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,200
Sweet Jesus!

329
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,400
- No!
- No!

330
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,200
<i>There were so many birthdays.</i>

331
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,900
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow...</i>

332
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,600
<i>So we wouldn't run out,</i>
<i>we would spare the candles.</i>

333
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,700
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

334
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,300
<i>And death was a common visitor.</i>
<i>People came and went.</i>

335
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,600
<i>You always knew</i>
<i>when someone left us.</i>

336
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,200
<i>There was a silence in the house.</i>

337
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,500
<i>It was a wonderful place to grow up.</i>

338
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,100
<i>I was with people who had shed</i>
<i>all the inconsequences of earlier life.</i>

339
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,900
<i>Left wondering about the weather,</i>
<i>the temperature of a bath,</i>

340
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,300
<i>the light at the end of a day.</i>

341
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,700
<i>For everyone that died, someone would</i>
<i>come to take their place.</i>

342
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,100
I've been married five times.

343
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,300
My fifth wife and I are captured
by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

344
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,500
Oh, goodness gracious.

345
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,000
We escaped across the river.

346
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,500
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

347
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,800
Oh, my God.

348
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,700
My second wife steps on cobra
and dies.

349
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,100
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

350
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

351
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,400
- The next summer I'm captured...
- He's a Pygmy.

352
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,400
...with three others
by the Baschiele tribe.

353
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,400
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer
to a very strange American man.

354
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,000
I hear you're not so old
as you're looking.

355
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,300
You just fooling everybody.

356
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,900
What's the matter?
Did you get <i>Madjembe?</i>

357
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,400
What's <i>Madjembe?</i>

358
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,800
Worms.

359
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,500
I don't think I have worms.

360
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,700
This is just how I am.

361
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,600
- Did you take your pills today?
- No, ma'am.

362
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,100
Come. Let's get a cold root beer.

363
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,300
I found the medication
under your pillow.

364
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm not supposed to. It's dangerous.

365
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,400
Who said that? Come on, little man.

366
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,400
Hello, children.

367
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,100
Hold, please.

368
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,100
Then I'm in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

369
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,500
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

370
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Look.

371
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,500
What's it like living in a cage?

372
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,100
It stinks.

373
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,000
But the monkeys.

374
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
They do some tricks there.

375
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,800
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.

376
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
She is orangutan.

377
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,300
When I'm not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars

378
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,500
in my cage, with my teeth.

379
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
So then what'd you do?

380
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,500
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there.
Wandered most of the time.

381
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,000
You were all alone?

382
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,400
Plenty of time you'll be alone.

383
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,900
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

384
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,800
But I'll tell you a little secret.

385
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,200
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,

386
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,300
white people,
they're just as alone as we are.

387
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,000
But they're scared shitless.

388
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,900
I think about the river I grew up on.

389
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,200
It would be nice to sit by my river again.

390
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,900
Come, I have an appointment.

391
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,800
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

392
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,300
Always ready. Always ready.

393
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,200
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

394
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,300
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

395
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
You can find your own way home,
can't you?

396
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,200
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.

397
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,800
Hey! Hey!

398
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,600
Where in God's name have you been?
Get in here.

399
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,400
I mean, you take my breath away,
you know that?

400
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,400
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you.

401
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,700
<i>It had been the best day of my life.</i>

402
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,300
- How's her breathing?
- It's shallow.

403
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,900
They say it'll reach us in a few hours,

404
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,000
so I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

405
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,500
They say there's nothing to worry about
here in the hospital.

406
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,100
Nurses'll be right here if you need them.
Are you okay?

407
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,000
- Yeah, I'm okay reading.
- I shouldn't be more than an hour.

408
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,000
Was there just company?

409
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,000
It was just Dorothy leaving.

410
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,600
Go on, Caroline.

411
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,800
"On Sundays, the families would come
and visit."

412
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,100
<i>It was Thanksgiving, 1930.</i>

413
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,200
<i>I met the person</i>
<i>who changed my life forever.</i>

414
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
Well, Benjamin.

415
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,100
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

416
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,100
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

417
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,500
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow.

418
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,900
What elixir have you been drinking?

419
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,400
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Grandma! Look at me!

420
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,200
That was really something.

421
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,200
Come on over here, you.

422
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,100
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.

423
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,900
This is Mr...

424
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,700
I'm afraid, Benjamin,
I don't rightly know your last name.

425
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,400
Benjamin's fine.

426
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,400
<i>I never forgot her blue eyes.</i>

427
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,500
Good people, supper is served.

428
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,700
Health and food, for love and friends.
For everything thy goodness sends.

429
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,300
Amen.

430
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,600
- Amen!
- Amen!

431
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,900
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds?

432
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Why do you say that?

433
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,300
They're in the pheasant family,
can't hardly fly.

434
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,900
It's sad, don't you think?
Birds that can't fly?

435
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,200
I love birds that can't fly.

436
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,300
They are so delicious.

437
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,900
- That's terrible.
- I have something to tell y'all

438
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,200
while we're giving thanks
for God's blessings.

439
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,200
I had a miracle happen.

440
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,300
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.

441
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,400
What does she mean,
answered her prayers?

442
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,000
Thanks. Thank you.

443
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,500
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

444
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,400
That's what my mama said
when I was gonna have a baby brother,

445
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,800
but he didn't live long,

446
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,400
'cause he didn't breathe right.

447
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,200
"In the afternoon, when he had got
his beautiful hind legs

448
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,900
"just as Big God Nqong had promised.

449
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,000
"You can see that it is 5:00,

450
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,100
"because Big God Nqong's
clock says so."

451
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,000
Isn't that something?

452
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,000
Again, read it again.

453
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,400
Oh, read it again, please.

454
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,800
All right.
But afterwards, you must go to bed.

455
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,500
I promise.

456
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,300
"Old Man Kangaroo."

457
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,300
Are you sleeping?

458
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,300
Who's that?

459
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,000
It's me, Daisy.

460
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,500
Oh, hi!

461
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,600
'Kay, come on.

462
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,500
Where are we going?

463
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,500
Come on. Under here.

464
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,400
Here, you light it.

465
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,600
I'm not supposed to play with matches.

466
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,000
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

467
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,100
I'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one.

468
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,600
Okay.

469
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,000
I saw my mama kissing another man.

470
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,500
Her face was red from it.

471
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,300
Your turn.

472
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,900
I'm not as old as I look.

473
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,500
I thought so.

474
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,000
You don't seem like an old person.

475
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,800
- Like my grandma.
- I'm not.

476
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,100
Are you sick?

477
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,900
Well, I heard Mama
and Tizzy whispering.

478
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,200
They said I was gonna die soon,
but maybe not.

479
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,900
You're odd.

480
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,600
You're different
than anybody I've ever met.

481
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,900
- May I?
- Okay.

482
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,600
What are you doing under there?

483
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,100
You come right out here
and get back up to bed!

484
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,000
It's after midnight!

485
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,200
You are not to be playing together.

486
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,800
Yes, ma'am.

487
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,100
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

488
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,200
You're too young to be wandering
around in the night on your own.

489
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,700
And you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

490
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You are a different child.

491
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,900
A man-child.

492
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,500
And, baby, people aren't gonna
understand just how different you are.

493
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,900
What's wrong with me, Mama?

494
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,600
Come here.

495
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,000
God hasn't said yet, baby.

496
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,000
Now go on to bed, hear?
And behave yourself.

497
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,900
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

498
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,800
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

499
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,000
Once when I was repairing
a leak on the roof.

500
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,400
Once I was just crossing
the road to get the mail.

501
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,700
<i>I never forgot her...</i>

502
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,300
"...blue eyes."

503
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,300
Mom?

504
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,200
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you?

505
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,900
Not many people experience that.

506
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,200
Want me to go on?

507
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
He crosses something out.

508
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,600
<i>When that baby came,</i>
<i>things were different.</i>

509
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,000
<i>Your mama gone away</i>
<i>And your daddy gonna stay</i>

510
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,900
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

511
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,000
<i>Babies were born, people died.</i>

512
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,700
<i>A lot of folks been through</i>
<i>that old house.</i>

513
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,900
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm going away.

514
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,300
Going?

515
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,300
Where?

516
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,000
I haven't figured that out yet,

517
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,600
but I'll send you a postcard
when I get there.

518
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,500
What about your friend, the tall lady?

519
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,000
We are not friends anymore.

520
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,300
That's what happens
with tall people sometimes.

521
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,200
Well, goodbye.

522
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,300
<i>Spent a lot of time by myself that year.</i>

523
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,900
Hello?

524
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,400
- Hi.
- I'm moving in today.

525
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,300
Welcome. We've been expecting you.

526
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,500
Can you please show her up
to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?

527
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,900
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

528
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Well, she's old as the hills.
She's almost blind.

529
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,000
She won't be a bother much longer.

530
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,800
Well, all right,
long as she stays from up underfoot.

531
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,100
Right this way, ma'am.

532
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,400
<i>As hard as I try,</i>
<i>I can't remember her name.</i>

533
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,600
<i>Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.</i>

534
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,400
<i>Maybe it was Maple.</i>

535
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,900
<i>It's funny how sometimes</i>
<i>the people we remember the least</i>

536
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,500
<i>make the greatest impression on us.</i>

537
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,400
<i>I do remember she wore diamonds.</i>

538
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,300
<i>And she always dressed in fine</i>
<i>clothing, as if she was going out.</i>

539
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,000
<i>Although she never did</i>
<i>and nobody ever came to visit her.</i>

540
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,100
<i>She taught me to play the piano.</i>

541
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,100
It's not about how well you play.

542
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,700
It's how you feel
about what you're playing.

543
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,100
Try this.

544
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,700
You can't help putting yourself
in the music.

545
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,700
<i>There were many changes.</i>

546
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,900
<i>Some you could see,</i>
<i>some you couldn't.</i>

547
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,900
<i>Hair had started growing</i>
<i>in all sorts of places,</i>

548
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
<i>along with other things.</i>

549
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,400
<i>I felt pretty good, considering.</i>

550
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,200
Darling, the pain.

551
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,800
All right, Mom, I'll get the nurse.

552
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,000
<i>Look at this eye.</i>
<i>This is a major hurricane,</i>

553
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,100
<i>a slow hurricane,</i>
<i>with maximum sustained winds of...</i>

554
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,100
Not doing too good?

555
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,200
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

556
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm gonna ride it out.

557
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,600
There.
That should make things much easier.

558
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,200
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

559
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,800
My father waited four hours for
my brother to get here from Boger City.

560
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
Couldn't go without him.

561
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,100
- She seems like a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

562
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,400
I haven't had as much time with her
as I would've...

563
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,400
- You busy? I could use your help.
- Excuse me.

564
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,800
Sure.

565
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
"Queenie would let me go
with Mr. Daws..."

566
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,900
<i>... to Poverty Point to watch the boats</i>
<i>go up and down the river.</i>

567
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,900
<i>These were hard times.</i>

568
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,700
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

569
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,000
Once when I was in the field,
just tending to my cows.

570
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,800
My fourth hand didn't show up.

571
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,500
Anybody want to make $2
for a day's work 'round here?

572
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,200
What's the matter?

573
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,000
Nobody wants to do an honest
day's work for an honest day's pay?

574
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,700
He never pays.

575
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,400
- Nobody wants a job?
- I do.

576
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,900
You got your sea legs about you,
old man?

577
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,400
I think.

578
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,800
Well, that's good enough for me.

579
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,400
Get your ass on board.
We'll sure as hell find out.

580
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,500
<i>I was as happy as I could be.</i>

581
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,900
I need a volunteer!

582
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,300
<i>I would do anything.</i>

583
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,800
Yes, Captain!

584
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,200
Scrape off all this bird shit!

585
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,700
Right away, sir.

586
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,000
<i>And I was actually gonna be paid</i>
<i>for something I would've done for free.</i>

587
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,000
<i>His name was Captain Mike Clark.</i>

588
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,900
<i>He'd been on a tugboat</i>
<i>since he was seven.</i>

589
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,700
Get moving, then.

590
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,100
Come here.

591
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,300
Can you still get it up?

592
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
I do every morning.

593
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,700
The old pole, huh? The high, hard one?

594
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,600
I guess.

595
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,900
When was the last time
you had a woman?

596
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,300
- Never.
- Never?

597
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,900
Not that I know of, sir.

598
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,200
Wait a minute, now.

599
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,100
You mean to say you've been
on this earth however many years

600
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,500
and you've never had a woman?

601
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,200
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

602
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,900
Never?

603
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,800
No.

604
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,500
Well, then, by Jesus,
you are coming with me.

605
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,100
What did your father do?

606
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,300
I never met my father.

607
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,300
You lucky bastard.

608
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,800
All fathers want to do is hold you down.

609
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,900
Out on my father's boat,
workin' the two-a-day,

610
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,700
this little, fat bastard.

611
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,400
"Tug Irish," they called him.

612
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,900
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve
and tell him,

613
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,500
"I don't want to spend the rest of my life
on a goddamn tugboat."

614
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
You know what I'm saying?

615
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,700
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life on a tugboat.

616
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,100
Absolutely! Damn right!

617
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,400
So you know
what my father says to me?

618
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,700
He says,
"Who the hell do you think you are?

619
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,500
"What the hell do you think you can do?"

620
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,500
So I tell him.

621
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,300
"Well, if you're asking,

622
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,600
"I want to be an artist."

623
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,100
He laughs.

624
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,600
"An artist? God meant for you
to work a tugboat, just like me.

625
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,400
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do."

626
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,700
Well, I turned myself into an artist.

627
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,900
A tattoo artist!

628
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,100
I put on every one of these myself.

629
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,500
You have to skin me alive
to take my art away from me now.

630
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,800
When I'm dead,
I'm gonna send him my arm.

631
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,500
That one.

632
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,400
Don't let anyone tell you different.

633
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,100
You gotta do what you're meant to do.

634
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,300
And I happen to be a goddamned artist.

635
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,200
But you're a tugboat captain.

636
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,600
Captain Mike?

637
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,400
We're ready for you and your friend.

638
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,200
Let's go, old timer, eh?
Break your cherry.

639
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,100
- Hello, my lovelies!
- Hey, Captain.

640
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

641
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

642
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,600
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

643
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,800
How are you tonight, grandpa?

644
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,600
<i>It was a night to remember.</i>

645
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,000
What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
I've got to rest.

646
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,400
Again.

647
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,000
- Thank you.
- No, thank you. You have a nice night.

648
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,200
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Every night but Sunday.

649
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,100
<i>It sure made me understand</i>
<i>the value of earning a living.</i>

650
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,500
Good night, sweetie. Come back now.

651
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,800
<i>Things money can buy you.</i>

652
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,200
It's nasty out.

653
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,600
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

654
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,600
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir.

655
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,400
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

656
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,200
- I'm Benjamin.
- Benjamin.

657
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,600
It's a pleasure to know you.

658
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,300
Would you like to stop somewhere
and have a drink?

659
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,800
All right.

660
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,400
Evening, Mr. Button.

661
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,900
What'll it be, sir?

662
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,700
- I'll have whatever he's having.
- Sazerac for the both of us.

663
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,100
With whiskey, not brandy.

664
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,700
You don't drink, do you?

665
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,400
- It's a night for firsts.
- How's that?

666
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,600
I've never been to a brothel, either.

667
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,500
Well, it's an experience.

668
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,700
It certainly is.
There's a time for everything.

669
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,200
- True enough.
- Your drinks.

670
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:34,100
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands.
Is that painful?

671
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,000
Well, I was born
with some form of disease.

672
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,700
What kind of disease?

673
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,600
I was born old.

674
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,800
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

675
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,400
There's nothing wrong with old age.

676
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,300
My wife passed away many years ago.

677
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,600
I'm so, so sorry.

678
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,900
She died in childbirth.

679
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,900
- To children.
- To mothers.

680
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,100
What line of work you in, Mr. Button?

681
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,300
Buttons. Button's Buttons.
There isn't a button that we don't make.

682
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,900
Our biggest competition
is B.F. Goodrich

683
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,700
and his infernal zippers.

684
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,600
Would you gentlemen like
anything else?

685
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,700
One for the road, Benjamin?

686
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,700
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.

687
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,400
So, what line of work do you do?

688
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,300
I'm a tugboat man.

689
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,500
I enjoyed talking to you.

690
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,100
I enjoyed drinking with you.

691
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,100
Benjamin?

692
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,700
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

693
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,200
Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.

694
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,500
Good night, Benjamin.

695
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,600
Drive on.

696
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,600
Where have you been?

697
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,700
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to some music.

698
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,700
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

699
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,800
<i>Growing up's a funny thing.</i>
<i>Sneaks up on you.</i>

700
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,000
<i>One person is there, then suddenly</i>
<i>somebody else has taken her place.</i>

701
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,300
<i>She wasn't all elbows</i>
<i>and knees anymore.</i>

702
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,100
Benjamin! Come on!

703
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,800
Okay.

704
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,700
<i>I loved those weekends</i>
<i>when she'd come</i>

705
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,600
<i>and spend the night</i>
<i>with her grandmother.</i>

706
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,100
Daisy. Daisy.

707
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,500
You want to see something?

708
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,400
You gotta keep it a secret,
so get dressed. I'll meet you out back.

709
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,300
Come on.

710
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,200
- Can you swim?
- I can do anything you can do.

711
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,900
Here, put this on. We gotta hurry.

712
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,400
Is he okay?

713
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,000
Captain?

714
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,100
Captain Mike?

715
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,500
Morning, Captain. Can you take us out?

716
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,000
Do you know what day it is?

717
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,400
Sunday?

718
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,600
Do you know what that means?

719
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,400
Means I was very drunk last night.

720
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,200
Well, you're drunk every night.

721
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,000
- Is that a girl?
- Close friend.

722
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,800
I want to show her the river.

723
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,200
You're not supposed to go joyriding
with civilians.

724
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,500
I could lose my license.

725
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,800
What are you waiting for?

726
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,100
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck.

727
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,600
She's flying now, huh?

728
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,800
Ahoy, sailor!

729
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,700
I wish we could go with them.

730
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,000
Did you say something, Mom?

731
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,800
It's getting really bad.

732
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,600
Can you hear me, Mom?

733
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,900
Time just seeped out of me.

734
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,400
"Things were changing quickly."

735
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,600
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

736
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,100
What if I told you
that I wasn't getting older,

737
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,500
but I was getting younger
than everybody else?

738
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,600
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,

739
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,500
to have to see everybody you love
die before you do.

740
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,500
It's an awful responsibility.

741
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,200
<i>I'd never thought about life or death</i>
<i>that way before.</i>

742
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,900
Benjamin, we're meant
to lose the people we love.

743
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,700
How else would we know
how important they are to us?

744
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,300
<i>And one fall day, a familiar visitor</i>
<i>came knocking on our door.</i>

745
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,800
You want to go with me
to the drugstore?

746
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,300
<i>She taught me how to play the piano.</i>

747
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,700
- Amen.
- Amen.

748
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,000
<i>And she taught me</i>
<i>what it meant to miss somebody.</i>

749
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,000
Let's go.

750
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,900
<i>I had gone to a brothel.</i>

751
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,300
<i>I'd had my first drink.</i>

752
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,900
<i>Said goodbye to one friend</i>
<i>and buried another.</i>

753
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,300
<i>In 1936, when I was coming to the end</i>
<i>of the 17th year of my life,</i>

754
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,300
<i>I packed my bag, said goodbye.</i>

755
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,700
- Bye, Benjamin.
- Goodbye.

756
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,300
<i>I knew, life being what it was,</i>
<i>I'd probably never see them again.</i>

757
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,100
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

758
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,700
- Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

759
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,100
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

760
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,500
I want you to say your prayers
every night, hear?

761
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,400
Be safe, hear?

762
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,200
Benjamin!

763
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,000
- Where you going?
- To sea.

764
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
I'll send you a postcard.

765
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,200
From everywhere.

766
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,900
Write me a postcard from everywhere.

767
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,300
Can you imagine?

768
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:41,800
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

769
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,300
Every place he worked.

770
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,700
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

771
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,400
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

772
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:59,000
He had gone with that Captain Mike.

773
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,200
<i>Captain Mike had contracted</i>
<i>for three years</i>

774
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,600
<i>with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage.</i>

775
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,600
<i>The old ship had been refitted with</i>
<i>a diesel engine and a new sea winch.</i>

776
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,600
<i>We went around Florida</i>
<i>and up the Atlantic seaboard.</i>

777
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,100
<i>We were a crew of seven now.</i>
<i>Captain Mike and me.</i>

778
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,500
<i>Cookie, Prentiss Mayes</i>
<i>from Wilmington, Delaware.</i>

779
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,000
<i>The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,</i>

780
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,400
<i>who got along fine at sea</i>
<i>but, for some reason,</i>

781
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,500
<i>once they were on dry land</i>
<i>couldn't stand the sight of each other.</i>

782
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,200
You know, one in every
eight boats never returns.

783
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,500
<i>There was John Grimm,</i>
<i>who sure fit his name.</i>

784
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,400
All hands lost at sea.

785
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,700
<i>From Belvedere, South Dakota.</i>

786
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,000
<i>And Pleasant Curtis</i>
<i>from Asheville, Notch.</i>

787
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,200
<i>Never said a word to anyone,</i>
<i>except himself.</i>

788
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:47,600
I wrote him constantly.

789
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,200
I wrote him constantly.

790
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:56,900
<i>I told him I had been invited to</i>
<i>audition in New York City</i>

791
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,100
<i>for the School of American Ballet.</i>

792
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,600
Please stay.

793
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,800
Thank you. Thank you.

794
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,100
You can stay.

795
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,700
<i>But I was relegated to the corps.</i>

796
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,400
<i>Another dancing gypsy.</i>

797
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,200
Benjamin!

798
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,300
How is it when you showed up

799
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,300
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave,

800
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,600
but now, either I drink a hell
of a lot more than I think I do,

801
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,500
or you sprouted?

802
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,200
What's your secret?

803
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,200
Well, Captain,

804
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,800
you do drink a lot.

805
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,800
<i>We stayed in a small hotel</i>
<i>with a grand name, The Winter Palace.</i>

806
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,700
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

807
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,300
The hummingbird
is not just another bird.

808
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,700
Its heart rate's 1,200 beats per minute.

809
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,200
Its wings beat 80 times a second.

810
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,100
If you was to stop their wings
from beating,

811
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,600
it would be dead
in less than 10 seconds.

812
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,300
This is no ordinary bird.

813
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,000
This is a frickin' miracle.

814
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,100
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

815
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,000
and you know what they saw?

816
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,300
Their wingtips are doing that.

817
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,200
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

818
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,700
Infinity.

819
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,100
Infinity!

820
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,500
<i>Everybody, no matter</i>
<i>what differences they had,</i>

821
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,700
<i>the languages, the color of their skin,</i>
<i>had one thing in common.</i>

822
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,000
<i>They were drunk every single night.</i>

823
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,600
Three, please.

824
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,300
Could you hold, dear, for us, please?

825
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,700
Thank you very much. Good evening.

826
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,500
<i>Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.</i>

827
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,900
<i>She was not beautiful.</i>
<i>She was plain as paper.</i>

828
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,800
<i>But she was pretty as any picture to me.</i>

829
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,100
What are you looking at?

830
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,900
If you must know,
we have a longstanding agreement

831
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,400
never to go to bed sober.

832
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,900
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Whatever you say, darling.

833
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
<i>Her husband was Walter Abbott.</i>

834
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,000
<i>He was Chief Minister of</i>
<i>the British Trade Mission in Murmansk,</i>

835
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,800
<i>and he was a spy.</i>

836
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,700
- Darling.
- Oh, thank you, my darling.

837
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,900
- Key, darling.
- Oh, yes.

838
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,400
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.

839
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,100
I'm not in the habit of walking about
in my stocking feet.

840
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,700
<i>They were long days there.</i>

841
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,200
<i>And even longer nights.</i>

842
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,900
<i>One particular night,</i>
<i>I was having trouble sleeping.</i>

843
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,900
I'm sorry.

844
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,500
I couldn't sleep.

845
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,900
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

846
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,600
Oh, no. Thank you.

847
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,000
Milk? Honey?

848
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,600
A bit of honey, please.

849
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,900
I hope you like flies in your honey.

850
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,700
Oh, perhaps not.

851
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,800
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.

852
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,000
Steep?

853
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,400
Soak.

854
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,300
I don't know, I mean,
there's a proper way of making tea.

855
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,700
Well, where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

856
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,900
Well, quite right.

857
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,200
- Now, you're a seaman.
- A sailor.

858
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,000
I hope you won't think me impolite,
but I have to ask,

859
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,300
aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

860
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,800
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

861
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,900
And you have trouble sleeping?
Thank you.

862
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,200
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

863
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,600
Something's been keeping me up.

864
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,000
My father, in his 80s,

865
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,400
he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep,

866
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,200
he limited himself
to having afternoon naps.

867
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,700
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

868
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,700
- Did he?
- Did he what?

869
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,500
Die in his sleep?

870
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,800
He died sitting in his favorite chair

871
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,500
listening to his favorite program
on the wireless.

872
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:09,100
He must have known something.

873
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:19,900
My husband's the British Trade Minister,
and we've been here for 14 months.

874
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,400
- Good God.
- We were supposed to go to Peking

875
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,900
but it never seemed to work out.

876
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,100
Have you been in the Far East?

877
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,400
No. I've never been anywhere, really.

878
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,900
I mean, outside of harbors.

879
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,700
And where is it that you're from?

880
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,300
New Orleans. Louisiana.

881
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,100
I didn't know there was another.

882
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,500
<i>And she told me about all the places</i>
<i>she had been, and what she had seen.</i>

883
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,000
<i>And we talked till just before the dawn.</i>

884
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,500
I'm just a lush, myself.

885
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:02,500
<i>And we went back to our rooms,</i>
<i>to our separate lives.</i>

886
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:11,200
<i>But every night,</i>
<i>we'd meet again in that lobby.</i>

887
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,500
<i>A hotel in the middle of the night</i>
<i>can be a magical place.</i>

888
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,300
<i>A mouse running, and stopping.</i>

889
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,800
<i>A radiator hissing.</i>

890
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,700
<i>A curtain blowing.</i>

891
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,800
<i>There's something peaceful,</i>
<i>even comforting</i>

892
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,100
<i>knowing that the people you love</i>
<i>are asleep in their beds</i>

893
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,500
<i>where nothing can harm them.</i>

894
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,500
<i>Elizabeth and I would lose track</i>
<i>of the night</i>

895
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,200
<i>until just before daybreak.</i>

896
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,600
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

897
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,300
Beg pardon?

898
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,200
Well, married women don't customarily
sit around

899
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,300
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

900
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,900
I wouldn't know what a married woman
does or doesn't do.

901
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,100
Good night.

902
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,800
Murmansk.

903
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,500
"I've met somebody,
and I've fallen in love."

904
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,800
Mom?

905
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,200
That was over 60 years ago.

906
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,500
Did you love him, Mother?

907
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,400
What does a girl know about love?

908
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,200
Well...

909
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:21,400
- I'm not dressed.
- Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

910
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,800
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,

911
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,900
'cause they're really
completely ordinary,

912
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
but the caviar and the vodka

913
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,700
are sublime and plentiful.

914
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,700
So.

915
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,300
Savor it.

916
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,400
And don't eat it all at once,

917
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,600
because that way,
there's nothing left to enjoy.

918
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,700
And now, take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

919
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,400
You haven't been with many women,
have you?

920
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,200
Not on Sundays.

921
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,100
And you've never had caviar before,
have you?

922
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,900
No, ma'am.

923
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,400
When I was 19,

924
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:45,700
I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

925
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,100
Really?

926
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,700
But the current that day
was so strong that,

927
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,900
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

928
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,100
<i>I was in the water for 32 hours.</i>

929
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,900
And when I was two miles from Calais,

930
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,800
<i>it started to rain.</i>

931
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,500
That's it! Steady on!

932
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,600
<i>When I couldn't go any further,</i>

933
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,700
I stopped.

934
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,700
<i>I just stopped.</i>

935
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:23,100
And everybody asked me,
would I try again?

936
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,700
<i>For why wouldn't I?</i>

937
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,300
But I never did.

938
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,000
As a matter of fact, I've never done
anything with my life after that.

939
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,200
Your hands are so coarse.

940
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,100
I can feel the wind in your cheek.

941
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,400
I'm afraid it's the witching hour.

942
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,500
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>a woman had ever kissed me.</i>

943
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,500
<i>It's something you never forget.</i>

944
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I think you make me feel younger.

945
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,700
You make me feel years younger, too.

946
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,400
I wish I was.

947
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,500
So many things I'd change.

948
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,500
I'd undo all my mistakes.

949
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,300
What mistakes?

950
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,800
I kept waiting, you know?

951
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:52,000
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

952
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,000
Do something.

953
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,800
Such an awful waste.
You never get it back.

954
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,700
Wasted time.

955
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,400
If we're going to have an affair,

956
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,000
you're never to look at me
during the day.

957
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,600
And we're always to part before sunrise.

958
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,900
And we will never say "I love you."

959
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,300
Those are the rules.

960
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,100
- Are you cold?
- I'm freezing.

961
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,100
Oh, you! You're frozen.

962
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,400
What an idiot, I'm standing here
in this fur. How thoughtless of me.

963
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,900
<i>She was the first woman</i>
<i>that ever loved me.</i>

964
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:15,100
You want me to skip some?

965
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:21,000
No, I'm glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

966
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,100
"I couldn't wait to see her again."

967
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,300
<i>We saw each other every night.</i>

968
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,200
<i>We always used the same room.</i>

969
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,500
<i>But each time seemed new</i>
<i>and different.</i>

970
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,400
Come here.

971
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,300
Elizabeth.

972
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,000
Good night.

973
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,400
<i>Until one night.</i>

974
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:52,200
<i>Yesterday, December 7th, 1941,</i>

975
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,400
<i>a date which will live in infamy...</i>

976
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,700
It's a meeting, a policy meeting
regarding your future,

977
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,200
possibly beyond.

978
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,100
There's been a change of plan, lads.

979
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,900
As you may or may not know,

980
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,600
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

981
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:15,500
Frank D. Roosevelt's asked
each of us to do our part.

982
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:20,200
The <i>Chelsea's</i> been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.

983
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,900
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue.

984
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,700
Anybody doesn't want to go to war,
now is the time to say so.

985
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:34,000
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

986
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,300
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk with you, Mike.

987
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,400
My wife's doing poorly.

988
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,300
I'd like to maybe see her one more time.

989
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,800
You're free to make your way home
any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

990
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,200
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook?

991
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:02,400
Food poisoning's one of the leading
causes of death at sea.

992
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,800
Right after
inadequate safety equipment.

993
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,600
I can cook, Captain.
Been doing it all my life.

994
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:12,100
I don't know.
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.

995
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,200
What the hell?

996
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:18,600
I'll take any man wants to kick the shite
out of the Japs and the Huns.

997
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,800
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

998
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,400
<i>She had left a note.</i>

999
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,500
<i>She wrote,</i>
<i>"It was nice to have met you."</i>

1000
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:38,900
<i>And that was it.</i>

1001
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,200
<i>It wasn't the war any of us expected.</i>

1002
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,900
<i>We would just tow crippled ships,</i>
<i>scraps of metal, really.</i>

1003
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,500
<i>If there was a war, we didn't see it.</i>

1004
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,500
<i>There was a man assigned to us.</i>
<i>The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.</i>

1005
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,800
<i>But most of all, he loved America.</i>

1006
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,800
There is no other country in the world.

1007
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,000
When you spell America...

1008
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,200
<i>His name was Dennis Smith,</i>
<i>and he was a full-blooded Cherokee.</i>

1009
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,400
<i>His family had been Americans</i>
<i>for over 500 years.</i>

1010
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:17,100
These pacifists.
They say they won't fight on conscience.

1011
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,800
Now, where would be
if everybody decided to act

1012
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,800
- according to their conscience?
- Keep it down, would you, Chief?

1013
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:44,400
Hey. I've been watching you.

1014
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,400
You seem trustworthy.

1015
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,300
If something happens to me,

1016
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,900
could you see that this gets to my wife?

1017
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:02,600
<i>He'd given me all of his pay.</i>
<i>Hadn't spent a dime of it.</i>

1018
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,800
I want my family to know
I was thinking about them.

1019
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,400
All hands on deck!

1020
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,700
Get your asses up here,
you lazy bastards!

1021
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,200
<i>The war had finally found us.</i>

1022
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,300
All stop!

1023
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,100
Pleasant, man that light.

1024
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,100
<i>A transport carrying 1,300 men</i>
<i>had been split by a torpedo.</i>

1025
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,800
<i>We were first to arrive at the scene.</i>

1026
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,500
- Cut the engines!
- All stop!

1027
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,500
<i>We were the only sound.</i>

1028
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,900
Fellas!

1029
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:45,900
Sub!

1030
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,500
We sure as hell
can't outrun them fuckers.

1031
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,500
Battle stations!

1032
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,400
Thank you, Chief.

1033
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,800
What?

1034
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,600
Is that the last one?

1035
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,700
Captain!

1036
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,900
They shot the hell out of my painting!

1037
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,000
Give me your other hand.

1038
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,400
You'll be all right, Captain.

1039
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,800
They got a nice spot in Heaven
waiting for you. Nice spot.

1040
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,400
You can be as mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1041
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:33,100
You could swear, curse the Fates.

1042
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,500
But when it comes to the end,

1043
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,400
you have to let go.

1044
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,700
Captain?

1045
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,800
Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men
died that day.

1046
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:19,400
I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee,
Dennis Smith.

1047
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,500
John Grimm, who was right,
he was gonna die there.

1048
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,700
I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money.

1049
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,700
I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,

1050
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,400
and to Mike Clark,
captain of the tugboat Chelsea.

1051
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:43,400
I said goodbye to all the other men
who had dreams of their own,

1052
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,000
all the men
who wanted to be insurance salesmen

1053
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:49,100
or doctors or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

1054
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,900
This don't get fixed.

1055
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,100
Out here, death didn't seem natural.

1056
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:17,300
I'd never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.

1057
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,400
Before or since.

1058
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:32,400
And in May of 1945,
when I was 26 years old,

1059
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,500
I came home.

1060
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,000
I'm ready! I'm ready!

1061
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,500
I'm coming!

1062
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:43,000
- I'm ready!
- All right, I'm coming, Miss Alfalina.

1063
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,600
- Queenie?
- Yes?

1064
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:56,400
Sweet Jesus! Oh, you're home!
Oh, Lord, you came back!

1065
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,300
- Let me look at you.
- Who's that, Mama?

1066
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,600
- Child, it's your brother, Benjamin.
- I didn't know he was my brother.

1067
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,400
There's a shitload of things
you don't know, child.

1068
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,700
Get on out there and finish sweeping.

1069
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,900
Come here, wash your hands,
help me with the table. Go on, now.

1070
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,900
Turn around.
You look like you've been born again.

1071
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,300
Younger than the springtime.

1072
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:18,000
I think that preacher laid hands on you
gave you a second life.

1073
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:21,800
I knew it that moment I saw you,
you were special.

1074
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,700
I tell you what, my knees are sore,

1075
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:26,400
'cause I've been on them every night
asking the Lord,

1076
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:30,200
I said,
"God, just bring him home safely."

1077
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:32,800
Remember what I told you?

1078
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,600
"You never know
what's coming for you"?

1079
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,600
That's right. Sit down.

1080
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,100
Well, you learn anything
worth repeating?

1081
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:48,400
- I sure saw some things.
- Oh, you seen some pain.

1082
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,700
- Some joy, too?
- Sure. Sure, I did.

1083
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,900
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.
Look at you.

1084
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,500
- Where's Tizzy?
- Oh, baby.

1085
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,900
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep
one night last April.

1086
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,400
- Mama, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you worry about that, baby.

1087
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,800
Yeah, well, it's only
one or two of them left now.

1088
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,400
They all just about new.

1089
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:20,400
Guess they're waiting their turn
like everybody else, huh?

1090
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,200
I'm so glad you're back home with me!

1091
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:26,400
Now, we're gonna have to find you
a wife and a new job! That's right.

1092
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,400
Come on in here,
help me with this table.

1093
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,200
Benjamin.

1094
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,400
You're wasting your time, baby.
She's stone deaf.

1095
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:40,600
Oh, and you'll be staying in
what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room.

1096
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,600
You're too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

1097
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,300
It's a funny thing about coming home.

1098
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,700
Looks the same,
smells the same, feels the same.

1099
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:01,300
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

1100
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,400
Once when I was sitting in my truck,
just minding my own business.

1101
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:15,700
You realize what's changed is you.

1102
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,400
And late one morning,
not long after I'd been back...

1103
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,100
Thank you.

1104
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,300
Hey.

1105
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:55,700
- Excuse me, is Queenie here?
- Daisy?

1106
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:03,100
- It's me, Benjamin.
- Benjamin?

1107
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,800
Oh, my God!

1108
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:14,000
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

1109
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:19,000
How are you?
It's been such a long time.

1110
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:21,800
There's so much I want to know.
When did you get back?

1111
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,300
Well, I got back a few weeks ago.

1112
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:27,400
I spoke to Queenie, she said you were
in the war, somewhere at sea.

1113
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,300
- We were so, so worried about you.
- Oh, I'm okay.

1114
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:35,200
Well, look at you. You're so lovely.

1115
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,800
You stopped writing.

1116
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:46,000
"When I had left, she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

1117
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,500
"She was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen."

1118
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,000
Beautiful.

1119
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,000
"The most beautiful."

1120
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,500
- You remember Grandma Fuller?
- Why, sure I do.

1121
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,700
- She passed.
- I heard that. I'm sorry.

1122
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,400
I just can't believe we're both here.
Must be fate.

1123
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,400
No, no, what do they call it?

1124
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,900
Kismet.

1125
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,900
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic?

1126
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I don't believe I...

1127
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:16,000
He says
that everything is predetermined,

1128
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:19,500
but I like to think of it as fate.

1129
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,900
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

1130
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,600
Have you been to Manhattan?
It's right across the river from me.

1131
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,900
Now, I can see
the Empire State Building

1132
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,700
if I stand on my bed.

1133
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,800
What about you?
Where have you been?

1134
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:39,500
Tell me everything. Last time you wrote,
you said you'd been to Russia.

1135
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,800
I've always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

1136
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:46,700
- Twice as cold.
- My goodness.

1137
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:51,900
We always said you were different.
But I think you really are.

1138
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:57,600
You wrote that you met somebody.
Did it work out?

1139
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,800
It ran its course.

1140
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,200
Hey, do you remember this?

1141
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,800
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1142
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,000
"at 5:00 in the afternoon."

1143
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,000
Would you like to have dinner?

1144
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,400
Did I tell you
that I danced for Balanchine?

1145
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:38,600
Oh, he's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.

1146
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,900
You know, in a rehearsal once,
a dancer fell.

1147
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,800
And he just...
He just put it right into the production.

1148
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:51,400
I mean, can you imagine that?
Like in a... In a classical ballet?

1149
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,700
You know, a dancer,
intentionally falling.

1150
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,500
There's a whole new word
for dance now. It's called "abstract."

1151
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,900
No, he's not the only one, though.

1152
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,900
There's Lincoln Kirstein
and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...

1153
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,500
Oh, there's Agnes de Mille.

1154
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,700
She's just torn up all those conventions,

1155
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,800
you know,
all that straight-up-and-down stuff.

1156
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:14,100
It's not about the formality of the dance,
it's about what the dancer's feeling.

1157
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,900
As she told me
about this big new world,

1158
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,500
names that didn't mean a thing to me,

1159
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,600
I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.

1160
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,000
It's new and it's modern
and it's American.

1161
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:27,200
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

1162
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,500
Oh, my God.
I've just been talking and talking.

1163
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:34,100
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.
I didn't know you smoked.

1164
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,700
I'm old enough.

1165
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:41,600
I'm old enough for a lot of things.

1166
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:47,000
In New York, we stay up all night,

1167
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:51,000
watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

1168
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,700
There's always something to do.

1169
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,500
I have to go back tomorrow.

1170
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,800
- So soon.
- Wish I could stay.

1171
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,700
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

1172
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,400
I can imagine
dancing completely naked.

1173
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:34,000
Have you read D.H. Lawrence?

1174
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:36,200
- Well...
- His books were banned.

1175
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,900
The words are like making love.

1176
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:29,000
In our company,
we have to trust each other.

1177
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:38,000
Sex is a part of it.

1178
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,300
You know,
a lot of the dancers are lesbians.

1179
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:50,500
There was one woman
who wanted to sleep with me.

1180
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:00,900
- Does that upset you?
- Which part?

1181
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,400
Somebody wanting to sleep with me.

1182
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:06,100
You're a desirable woman.

1183
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,900
I would think most of them
would want to sleep with you.

1184
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,100
Let's go back to the house.

1185
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,500
Or we could get a room somewhere.

1186
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:21,600
- We could lay down your jacket.
- I don't know, Daisy.

1187
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:27,100
It's not that I wouldn't like to or anything.
I think I'll just disappoint you.

1188
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,100
Oh, Benjamin, I've been with older men.

1189
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,900
You're going back to New York
in the morning.

1190
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,300
You should be with your friends.

1191
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,800
- You're only young once.
- Oh, I'm old enough.

1192
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:42,500
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

1193
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,200
We could go hear some music.

1194
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:03,200
Our lives are defined by opportunities.

1195
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Even the ones we miss.

1196
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:10,500
You look so handsome
and so distinguished.

1197
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,800
They're saying the hurricane's
gonna miss us, blow right on by.

1198
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:17,500
- Oh, that's great.
- I'll stay under the blankets with Mother.

1199
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:21,700
She says nothing... Benjamin?

1200
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,700
"Things were becoming different..."

1201
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,900
... for me.

1202
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:29,600
My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.

1203
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:33,500
My sense of smell was keener.
My hearing, more acute.

1204
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,300
I could walk further and faster.

1205
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:42,100
While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger, all alone.

1206
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,400
Come in.

1207
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,100
Benjamin.

1208
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:53,300
- Do you remember me?
- Well, sure I do, Mr. Button.

1209
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,600
- What happened to you?
- Darn foot. Got infected, so...

1210
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,500
Welcome home, my friend.

1211
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:06,300
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1212
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,600
Creature of habit.

1213
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,800
You still visiting the house
on Bourbon Street?

1214
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,700
Not for a long time.

1215
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,400
Interesting times, though.

1216
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:19,900
We went from making 40,000
to nearly half a million buttons a day.

1217
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
We employed 10 times
the number of people.

1218
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,600
We were operating around the clock.

1219
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,500
Damn shame.

1220
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:34,600
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1221
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,700
You know,

1222
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,300
I'm sick.
I don't know how much longer I have.

1223
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,200
- I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.
- No...

1224
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,700
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

1225
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:57,200
I hope you don't mind,
but, whenever possible,

1226
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,300
I'd enjoy your company.

1227
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,900
I'll certainly do what I can.

1228
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:08,100
Benjamin, do you know anything
about buttons?

1229
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:16,400
Now, Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1230
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,600
My grandfather was a tailor,
and he had a small shop in Richmond.

1231
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:24,100
After the Civil War,
he moved to New Orleans,

1232
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:29,300
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1233
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:34,200
So, with his help,
the tailor shop grew to this.

1234
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,600
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1235
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,100
That's very, very interesting.

1236
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,200
You sure have done well for yourself.

1237
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:55,200
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button?

1238
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:00,700
Benjamin? You're my son.

1239
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:10,900
I'm so sorry I never told you before.

1240
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:16,500
You were born
the night the Great War ended.

1241
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:22,100
Your mother died giving birth to you.

1242
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,800
I thought you were a monster.

1243
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:32,600
I promised your mother
I'd make sure you were safe.

1244
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,500
I should never have abandoned you.

1245
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,000
My mother?

1246
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:51,300
At the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1247
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,800
When I was a boy,
I'd love to wake up before anyone else,

1248
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:57,900
run down to that lake
and watch the day begin.

1249
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,200
It was as if I was the only one alive.

1250
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,700
I fell in love the first time I saw her.

1251
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:09,900
Your mother's name
was Caroline Murphy.

1252
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:13,400
She worked
in your grandfather's kitchen.

1253
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,400
She's from Dublin.

1254
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:23,500
In 1903, Caroline and all her brothers
and sisters came to live here,

1255
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,100
in New Orleans.

1256
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,100
I'd find excuses
to go down to that kitchen

1257
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,000
just so I could look at her.

1258
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:43,100
April 25th, 1918.
Happiest day of my life.

1259
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:46,100
The day I married your mother.

1260
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:50,000
Why didn't you just tell me?

1261
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:53,700
I plan on leaving everything I have
to you.

1262
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:57,700
- I have to go.
- Where?

1263
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,100
Home.

1264
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,200
And what does he think, anyway?

1265
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:03,600
He thinks he can just show up

1266
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,500
and everything's
supposed to be fine and dandy.

1267
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,200
Everybody's just supposed to be friends.

1268
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:11,200
Well, he got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

1269
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:14,700
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming.

1270
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,900
He left us $18 that night you was found.

1271
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,800
Eighteen ratty dollars

1272
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,600
- and a filthy diaper.
- Good night, Mama.

1273
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,200
Good night, baby.

1274
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:41,800
Did I ever tell you
I was struck by lightning seven times?

1275
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,700
Once, I was walking my dog
down the road.

1276
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:54,500
I'm blind in the one eye,
can't hardly hear,

1277
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,400
get twitches and shakes out of nowhere,
always losing my line of thought.

1278
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,600
But you know what?

1279
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:07,300
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

1280
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:14,600
Storm's coming.

1281
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,800
May I help you, sir?
Up the stairs, first bedroom.

1282
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:46,000
Thank you.

1283
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,100
Wake up.

1284
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,500
Let's get you dressed.

1285
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,500
Now that's something.

1286
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,200
Thank you.

1287
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:45,300
You can be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1288
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,800
You can swear and curse the Fates.

1289
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,600
But when it comes to the end,

1290
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,600
you have to let go.

1291
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:19,200
Well, it sure is a beautiful service.

1292
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:23,900
He'll be buried
right next to your mother.

1293
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,000
You're my mother.

1294
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,000
My baby.

1295
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,800
Now, I'd never seen New York.

1296
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,300
- Excuse me, I'm a friend of Daisy's.
- Right this way.

1297
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:16,700
- Daisy has company. Daisy! Daisy!
- Yes!

1298
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:20,400
- We need the wardrobe.
- Is somebody looking for me?

1299
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:23,700
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1300
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:25,200
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1301
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:30,300
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd come visit.

1302
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,800
Spend some time with you, if I could.

1303
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,800
Oh, well, I wish you would've called.
You took me by surprise.

1304
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:45,300
- You can just throw them out.
- No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1305
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,800
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1306
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,600
Thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

1307
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:03,000
I better get changed.
A group of us are going to a party.

1308
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:06,300
- Would you want to come?
- Someone told me about a restaurant

1309
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,700
I thought you might enjoy.

1310
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:10,300
I made a reservation, just in case.

1311
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:13,400
Just, all the dancers go out
after the show. You're...

1312
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:17,300
You're welcome to come with us.
I'll get changed. All right?

1313
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:25,900
She choreographs
for the Ballets Russes.

1314
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,300
She's divine.

1315
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:29,800
You were breathtaking.

1316
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:36,700
Sweetie.

1317
01:47:37,900 --> 01:47:40,800
This is David.
He dances with the company.

1318
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,800
- This is Benjamin.
- Who?

1319
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:47,100
- I told you about him.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing?

1320
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:50,700
- I'll go get you a drink.
- All right. Thanks.

1321
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:01,600
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1322
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:03,600
Or something like that?

1323
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:06,500
Something like that.

1324
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:08,400
Hey, excuse me.

1325
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,000
Come on.

1326
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:54,400
Hey!

1327
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:57,900
Now, I had no idea you were coming.

1328
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:00,400
Lord, Benjamin.

1329
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,900
What did you expect?
What, you want me to drop everything?

1330
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Now, this is my life.

1331
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:11,500
Babe! You going downtown?

1332
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:19,600
Come on. You'll have a good time.

1333
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:21,900
There's lots of musicians,
interesting people.

1334
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:25,000
You don't have to do that.
This is my fault.

1335
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,500
I should've called.

1336
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,400
I thought I'd come here

1337
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:33,200
and sweep you off your feet
or something.

1338
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:39,200
- Daisy! Come on! Let's go.
- Be right there.

1339
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,400
Seems nice.

1340
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:45,300
Do you love him?

1341
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:49,800
I think so.

1342
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,600
I'm happy for you.

1343
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,700
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1344
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:01,400
Okay.

1345
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:05,200
I enjoyed the show!

1346
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:17,300
He came to tell me his father had died.

1347
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:25,000
- You couldn't have known.
- I was 23. I... I just didn't care.

1348
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,000
What did you do next?

1349
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:36,000
Some photographs, I think,
in the front of my bag.

1350
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:42,200
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1351
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:46,000
For five years, I...

1352
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,600
I danced everywhere.

1353
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,500
London, Vienna, Prague.

1354
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:58,000
I've never seen these.

1355
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:02,400
Mom.

1356
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:06,400
You never talked about your dancing.

1357
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,500
Well, I was the only American

1358
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:13,600
to be invited to dance
with the Bolshoi, sugar.

1359
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:17,400
It was glorious.

1360
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:25,600
But Benjamin was never far
from my thoughts.

1361
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,300
And I'd find myself saying...

1362
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,200
Good night, Benjamin.

1363
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:39,900
- "Good night, Daisy."
- He said that?

1364
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,200
"Life wasn't all that complicated.

1365
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:46,900
"If you want, you might say
I was looking for something."

1366
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:59,300
Benjamin?
Mrs. La Tourneau just passed.

1367
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:09,400
- Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button?
- That'd be me.

1368
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,600
Thank you.

1369
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,900
Miss Daisy Fuller.

1370
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,800
- Just a minute. Please have a seat.
- Sure.

1371
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:56,600
Sometimes we're on a collision course
and we just don't know it.

1372
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:01,700
Whether it's by accident or by design,
there's not a thing we can do about it.

1373
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:07,600
A woman in Paris was on her way
to go shopping.

1374
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:12,700
But she had forgotten her coat,
went back to get it.

1375
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,000
When she had gotten her coat,
the phone had rung.

1376
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:18,100
So she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.

1377
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,400
While the woman was on the phone,

1378
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:25,700
Daisy was rehearsing for a performance
at the Paris Opera House.

1379
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,500
And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,

1380
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,900
had gone outside to get a taxi.

1381
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,800
Now, a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,

1382
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:40,600
and had stopped to get a cup of coffee.

1383
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:44,200
And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing.

1384
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:48,000
And this cab driver,
who dropped off the earlier fare

1385
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,300
And this cab driver,
who dropped off the earlier fare

1386
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,300
and had stopped
to get the cup of coffee,

1387
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,100
he picked up the lady
who was going shopping

1388
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,900
and had missed getting the earlier cab.

1389
01:53:57,900 --> 01:54:00,300
The taxi had to stop
for a man crossing the street,

1390
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:03,200
who had left for work five minutes later
than he normally did

1391
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,800
because he forgot to set his alarm.

1392
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:09,900
While that man, late for work,
was crossing the street,

1393
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,400
Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.

1394
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,200
And while Daisy was showering,

1395
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:19,000
the taxi was waiting outside a boutique
for the woman to pick up a package

1396
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:20,200
which hadn't been wrapped yet,

1397
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:22,100
because the girl
who was supposed to wrap it

1398
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:25,800
had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before and forgot.

1399
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:29,700
When the package was wrapped,
the woman, who was back in the cab,

1400
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:31,400
was blocked by a delivery truck.

1401
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:34,200
All the while,
Daisy was getting dressed.

1402
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:39,100
The delivery truck pulled away,
and the taxi was able to move

1403
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:41,300
while Daisy, the last to be dressed,

1404
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:44,900
waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.

1405
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:48,300
While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,

1406
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:52,300
Daisy and her friend
came out the back of the theater.

1407
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,800
And if only one thing
had happened differently,

1408
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:58,000
if that shoelace hadn't broken

1409
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:00,600
or that delivery truck
had moved moments earlier

1410
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:02,600
or that package
had been wrapped and ready

1411
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:05,400
because the girl hadn't broken up
with her boyfriend,

1412
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:09,200
or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier

1413
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:12,400
or that taxi driver hadn't stopped
for a cup of coffee

1414
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:16,500
or that woman had remembered
her coat and got into an earlier cab,

1415
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:19,800
Daisy and her friend
would have crossed the street

1416
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:22,300
and the taxi would have driven by.

1417
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:35,100
But, life being what it is,

1418
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:38,200
a series of intersecting lives
and incidents

1419
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:40,100
out of anyone's control,

1420
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,700
that taxi did not go by,

1421
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:46,600
and that driver was
momentarily distracted.

1422
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:48,600
Daisy!

1423
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,000
And that taxi hit Daisy.

1424
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:51,800
Daisy! Help!

1425
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And her leg was crushed.

1426
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:05,600
Daisy?

1427
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:12,400
- Who told you?
- Your friend wired me.

1428
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:17,500
Very kind of you to come all this way
to see that I was all right.

1429
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:21,100
You'd do the same for me.

1430
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,200
My God.

1431
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,800
Look at you. You're perfect.

1432
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:37,200
I wish you hadn't come here.
I don't want you to see me like this.

1433
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,900
Her leg had been broken in five places.

1434
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,100
And with therapy and time,
she might walk again.

1435
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:52,600
But she'd never dance.

1436
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:56,600
I'm gonna take you home with me.

1437
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:59,500
- I want to look after you.
- I'm not going back to New Orleans.

1438
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:01,800
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1439
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:05,400
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

1440
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:10,800
I know I'm feeling sorry for myself,
but I don't want to be with you.

1441
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:14,600
Tried to tell you that in New York.
You don't listen.

1442
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:18,100
You might change your mind.

1443
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:21,200
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

1444
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:26,400
Just stay out of my life.

1445
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:52,500
I was awfully cruel.

1446
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:59,000
He didn't understand.
I couldn't have him see me like that.

1447
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:03,100
"I didn't leave right away.

1448
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:09,000
"I stayed in Paris for a while
to look out for her."

1449
01:58:12,700 --> 01:58:14,500
I never knew that.

1450
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:22,000
Oh, darling, could you get the nurse?

1451
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:30,700
I taught myself to walk again.

1452
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:36,300
I took the train to Lourdes.

1453
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:43,300
Let's take a look. That's normal.
Pulse rate is slowing.

1454
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:45,400
She is gonna struggle to breathe.

1455
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,700
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

1456
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:06,800
All right, he says, "I went back home."
And then there's a lot of pages torn out.

1457
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,700
"I listened to the sound of the house."
I read that already.

1458
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:12,700
He...

1459
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:16,900
He spilt something on it,
so it's hard to read, Mom.

1460
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:20,800
Something about sailing,
does that make sense?

1461
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:25,000
I learned to sail an old boat
of my father's from the lake house.

1462
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,100
I can't lie.

1463
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:39,000
I did enjoy the company
of a woman or two.

1464
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:48,900
Or maybe three.

1465
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:29,700
Don't know why you bother, Sam,
just gonna be there again tomorrow.

1466
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:35,200
Mama.

1467
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:42,500
And in the spring of 1962,

1468
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:47,900
she came back.

1469
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:10,900
- You want to know where I've been?
- No.

1470
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:17,800
How come you didn't write or nothing?
Just disappearing like that.

1471
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:20,500
It was something I needed to do
for myself.

1472
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:24,300
Yeah, well, I never took you
to be the selfish type.

1473
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:26,900
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1474
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,100
I'm usually not wrong about people.

1475
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:32,700
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

1476
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:35,300
Y'all have fun.

1477
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:42,500
- You haven't said two words.
- I don't want to ruin it.

1478
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:15,000
- Sleep with me?
- Absolutely.

1479
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:55,100
I asked her to come away with me.

1480
02:02:57,400 --> 02:03:00,500
We sailed into the Gulf
along the Florida Keys.

1481
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:46,200
I am so glad we didn't find one another
when I was 26.

1482
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:50,600
- Why do you say that?
- I was so young.

1483
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:52,500
And you were so old.

1484
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:56,100
It happened
when it was supposed to happen.

1485
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:59,300
I will enjoy each and every moment
I have with you.

1486
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:07,000
I bet I can stay out here longer than you.

1487
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:08,700
I bet you can't.

1488
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:14,000
Barely a line or a crease.

1489
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:17,600
Every day I have more wrinkles.
It's not fair.

1490
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:23,000
I love your wrinkles. Both of them.

1491
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:31,000
What's it like growing younger?

1492
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:38,100
I can't really say.
I'm always looking out my own eyes.

1493
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:46,900
Will you still love me
when my skin grows old and saggy?

1494
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,500
Will you still love me when I have acne?
When I wet the bed?

1495
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:55,700
When I'm afraid
of what's under the stairs?

1496
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:04,200
What?

1497
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:14,200
- What are you thinking?
- Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1498
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:18,600
And what a shame that is.

1499
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:23,200
Some things last.

1500
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:29,700
- Good night, Daisy.
- Good night, Benjamin.

1501
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,200
Mom?

1502
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:53,500
- When did you meet Dad?
- Some time after that.

1503
02:05:56,700 --> 02:06:01,400
- Did you tell him about this Benjamin?
- He knew enough, darling.

1504
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:22,500
Mama?

1505
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:31,000
Queenie?

1506
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:35,500
Hello?

1507
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:39,500
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1508
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:44,800
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.
I'm so sorry.

1509
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:16,900
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1510
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,800
Our deepest condolences.

1511
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
We buried her
beside her beloved Mr. Weathers.

1512
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,400
And so we might have memories
of our own,

1513
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:39,500
we sold my father's house
on Esplanade.

1514
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:42,200
It is a wonderful old place, darling.

1515
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,700
I think we are going to be
so happy here.

1516
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:48,700
Oh, what a long family history you have.

1517
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,800
They come with the house.

1518
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:56,300
- Come on.
- You have to see the master suite.

1519
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:00,000
We bought ourselves a duplex.

1520
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:04,100
I loved that house.

1521
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:08,500
It smelled like firewood.

1522
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:12,900
Don't... Don't stop, darling.

1523
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:16,400
"It was one of the happiest times
of my life."

1524
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:19,000
We didn't have a stick of furniture.

1525
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:22,500
We would have picnics
in the living room.

1526
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:30,000
We ate when we felt like it.
Stayed up all night when we wanted.

1527
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:33,400
We vowed never to fall into routine,

1528
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:36,400
to go to bed or wake up
at the same time.

1529
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:38,500
We lived on that mattress.

1530
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:17,700
Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.

1531
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:22,000
We lived four blocks from a public pool.

1532
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:03,200
You know, you might've got
a few more years out of it,

1533
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:07,400
but you chose to do
something so special and unique

1534
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:12,600
that there was only
a short window of time you could do it.

1535
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,900
So, even if nothing ever happened,

1536
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,100
you'd still be right here
where you are now.

1537
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:22,400
I just don't like getting old.

1538
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,500
They put too much chlorine in here.

1539
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:11,700
I promise you I'll never lose myself
to self-pity again.

1540
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,100
And I think right there and then

1541
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:23,200
she realized
none of us is perfect forever.

1542
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:28,700
She found peace.

1543
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:33,600
She opened a studio
and taught young girls how to dance.

1544
02:11:33,700 --> 02:11:36,700
And tendu.

1545
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:41,900
Come back the other way.
And spot, spot, spot. Excellent.

1546
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:46,100
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Good night.

1547
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:14,200
You certainly are beautiful to watch.

1548
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,400
Dancing's all about the line.

1549
02:12:20,700 --> 02:12:22,500
The line of your body.

1550
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:28,200
Sooner or later, you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

1551
02:12:34,100 --> 02:12:40,100
I figure, you were born in 1918,
49 years ago.

1552
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:41,700
I'm 43.

1553
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:46,400
We are almost the same age.

1554
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:53,900
- We're meeting in the middle.
- We finally caught up with each other.

1555
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:56,200
Wait.

1556
02:12:57,600 --> 02:13:00,200
I want to remember us
just as we are now.

1557
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:12,600
I'm pregnant.

1558
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:33,900
You know, I swear the nurse slipped
and said it was a boy.

1559
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:50,900
But I think it's a girl.

1560
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:59,800
- I know you're afraid.
- I'm not hiding it.

1561
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:01,000
Okay.

1562
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:09,400
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1563
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:10,900
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1564
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,400
Then I will love it all the more.

1565
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:20,400
Okay. How can I be a father
when I'm heading in the other direction?

1566
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:24,400
It's not fair to a child.
I don't want to be anybody's burden.

1567
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:27,300
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1568
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:30,900
I am gonna make this work.

1569
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:36,400
I want this, and I want it with you.

1570
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:39,900
I want you to have everything you want,
all of it.

1571
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,200
I'm just not sure how to reconcile this.

1572
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:45,400
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1573
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:47,100
Here you go.

1574
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:50,600
You'll be a father for as long as you can.

1575
02:14:50,700 --> 02:14:53,500
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

1576
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:56,200
Loving you is worth everything to me.

1577
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:02,400
I have to go pee.

1578
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:18,700
The oldest woman
to ever swim the English Channel

1579
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,500
arrived here today in Calais...

1580
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:23,100
- Keep it.
- ... having made the swim in 34 hours,

1581
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:25,400
22 minutes and 14 seconds.

1582
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:30,400
The 68-year-old Elizabeth Abbott
arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,

1583
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:32,200
exhausted but happy.

1584
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:35,900
Miss Abbott, how would you sum up,
in words, this achievement?

1585
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,500
I suppose...

1586
02:15:38,900 --> 02:15:40,700
Anything's possible.

1587
02:15:44,700 --> 02:15:45,900
- All right?
- Yes. Thank you.

1588
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:46,900
- You ready?
- Thank you very much.

1589
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Thank you. Thank you all.

1590
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:51,000
- Yeah.
- You're very kind.

1591
02:15:58,300 --> 02:16:02,200
In the spring, on a day like any other...

1592
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:04,900
I'll be back in an hour!

1593
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:11,100
Honey?

1594
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:15,200
Go and call an ambulance!

1595
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:19,800
The baby's coming.

1596
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:21,700
Operator, I need an ambulance.

1597
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:24,200
- The baby's coming!
- 2714 Napoleon.

1598
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:34,100
There you go. Keep breathing.

1599
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:37,400
Deep breaths. Push.

1600
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:48,700
There we go.

1601
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:08,500
Everyone's fine.
She's a perfectly healthy baby girl.

1602
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:16,600
Honey?

1603
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:22,200
She gave birth to a five pound,
four ounce baby girl.

1604
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:40,300
Did you count the toes?

1605
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:46,100
She's perfect.

1606
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:49,800
"And we named her
for my mother, Caroline."

1607
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:55,700
This Benjamin was my father?

1608
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,400
And this is how you tell me?

1609
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,300
Excuse me.

1610
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:19,600
... because all the ingredients are there
for a major storm,

1611
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:22,200
possibly even up to a Category 5.

1612
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,600
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1613
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:38,200
Nobody can tell you exactly
where it's gonna hit,

1614
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:40,100
but we have to go with the guidance
that we have,

1615
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:43,900
incorporate that information
and then pass it along to you.

1616
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:55,600
"You grew as the doctor had promised,
normal and healthy."

1617
02:19:04,300 --> 02:19:07,400
You're gonna have to find a real father
for her.

1618
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:12,300
What are you talking about?

1619
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:15,700
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1620
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:18,600
She'll learn to accept
whatever happens. She loves you.

1621
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:21,500
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

1622
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:26,900
- Is it me?
- Of course not.

1623
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
- Is my age beginning to bother you?
- Of course not.

1624
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:33,100
- Is that what you're telling me?
- You can't raise the both of us.

1625
02:19:41,800 --> 02:19:46,700
It was your first birthday.
We had a party for you.

1626
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:49,300
The house was filled with children.

1627
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:51,300
- How are you?
- Hey, man.

1628
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:55,000
Before you turn around,
they'll be in high school, dating.

1629
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:31,500
I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain,

1630
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:34,300
I sold Button's Buttons,

1631
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:38,900
I sold my father's sailboat,
put it all into a savings account.

1632
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:44,400
And so that you
and your mother might have a life,

1633
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:49,500
I left,
before you could ever remember me.

1634
02:21:39,300 --> 02:21:41,400
"I left with just the clothes on my back."

1635
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:47,500
I don't want to read this now.
Can you just tell me where he went?

1636
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:51,200
I don't really know.

1637
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:07,400
It's for me. 1970. I was two.
"Happy Birthday."

1638
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:13,000
"I wish
I could have kissed you good night."

1639
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:19,900
They're all for me.

1640
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:25,900
Five. "I wish I could have taken you
to your first day of school."

1641
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:36,200
Six. "I wish I could have been there
to teach you to play piano."

1642
02:22:39,700 --> 02:22:42,700
1981, 13.

1643
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:46,100
"I wish I could have told you
not to chase some boy.

1644
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:51,000
"I wish I could have held you
when you had a broken heart.

1645
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:58,300
"I wish I could have been your father.
Nothing I ever did will replace that."

1646
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:08,300
I guess he went to India.

1647
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:10,900
"For what it's worth, it's never too late,

1648
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,800
- "or, in my case, too early..."
- ... or, in my case, too early,

1649
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:16,000
to be whoever you want to be.

1650
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:22,800
There's no time limit.
Start whenever you want.

1651
02:23:25,700 --> 02:23:30,100
You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.

1652
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:36,200
We can make the best or the worst of it.

1653
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:38,600
And I hope you make the best of it.

1654
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:44,400
I hope you see things that startle you.

1655
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:50,100
I hope you feel things
you never felt before.

1656
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:56,000
I hope you meet people
with a different point of view.

1657
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:59,900
I hope you live a life you're proud of.

1658
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:08,000
And if you find that you're not,
I hope you have the strength

1659
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:11,300
- to start all over again.
- "...start all over again."

1660
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:16,500
He had been gone a long time.

1661
02:24:18,300 --> 02:24:20,400
I'll see you next Thursday.

1662
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:26,800
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Oh, good night, sweetheart.

1663
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:46,600
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1664
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:51,100
Can I help you?

1665
02:24:52,700 --> 02:24:55,100
Are you here to pick somebody up?

1666
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:07,400
Why did you come back?

1667
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,200
Mom?

1668
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:12,400
Mom?

1669
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:15,100
You ready yet?

1670
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:19,200
Mom, what's wrong?

1671
02:25:19,300 --> 02:25:22,900
I was just hearing a very sad story
about a mutual friend

1672
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,700
who I hadn't seen for a very long time.

1673
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,700
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1674
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:32,500
You knew him
when you were just a baby.

1675
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:36,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

1676
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:40,000
Hey.

1677
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,800
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done.
- Oh, this is a friend of my family's.

1678
02:25:46,900 --> 02:25:51,900
Benjamin Button,
this is my husband, Robert.

1679
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,400
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.

1680
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:05,500
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

1681
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:07,400
- We'll be in the car, darling.
- All right.

1682
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:08,700
Bye.

1683
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:11,200
I'm just locking up.

1684
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:17,000
Wow.

1685
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:22,400
She's beautiful. Like her mother.

1686
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,500
- Does she dance?
- Not very well.

1687
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:28,500
I guess that'd be
from my side of things.

1688
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:30,600
She's a dear, sweet girl.

1689
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:36,100
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at 12?

1690
02:26:36,300 --> 02:26:40,600
A lot of her reminds me of you.

1691
02:26:41,500 --> 02:26:45,400
My husband, he's a widower, or was...
Was a widower.

1692
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:49,700
He's an incredibly kind, just bright,
adventurous man.

1693
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:55,600
- He's been a terrific father.
- Good.

1694
02:27:00,300 --> 02:27:04,200
- You are so much younger.
- Only on the outside.

1695
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:07,800
You were right.

1696
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:13,000
I couldn't have been raising both of you.

1697
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:14,800
I'm not that strong.

1698
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,100
So, where are you staying?

1699
02:27:23,700 --> 02:27:24,700
What are you gonna do?

1700
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:28,600
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel
on the Avenue.

1701
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:32,300
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1702
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:33,500
But...

1703
02:27:40,100 --> 02:27:41,700
They're waiting.

1704
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:27,100
I remember that. That was him?

1705
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:30,900
The hurricane has changed directions.

1706
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,900
It's going to make landfall
sometime soon.

1707
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,700
- Am I supposed to do something?
- Arrangements are being made

1708
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:36,000
to move people, but it's up to you.

1709
02:28:36,100 --> 02:28:38,000
No. No, we're... We're staying.

1710
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:40,700
I'll let you know if anything changes.

1711
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:47,100
"That night, while I was sitting
and wondering why I came back at all,

1712
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:49,600
"there was a knock at the door."

1713
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:54,400
Come in.

1714
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:10,400
Are you all right?

1715
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:17,600
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1716
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:28,100
Nothing lasts.

1717
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:34,000
I have never stopped loving you.

1718
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,700
Oh, but, Benjamin,
I'm an old woman now.

1719
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:55,500
Some things you never forget.

1720
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:16,900
... so few people even know

1721
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,700
that you were ever in jail
in the first place.

1722
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:21,000
I'll tell you, I am sick about it, too,

1723
02:30:21,100 --> 02:30:23,600
because, please,
if they're not gonna give you an award

1724
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:25,800
like "Man of the Year,"
at least what they could do

1725
02:30:25,900 --> 02:30:28,600
is stop having you listed
as an ex-convict

1726
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:31,200
which I think is, again, so unfair.

1727
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,800
Good night, Benjamin.

1728
02:30:47,300 --> 02:30:49,000
Good night, Daisy.

1729
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:56,400
And as I knew I would,
I watched her go.

1730
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:01,400
That's the last thing he wrote.

1731
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:07,200
Sometime after your father passed,

1732
02:31:07,300 --> 02:31:10,100
there was a call.

1733
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:14,400
Hello.

1734
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:17,000
Yes, speaking.

1735
02:31:20,300 --> 02:31:22,800
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1736
02:31:32,700 --> 02:31:34,500
It's the corner house.

1737
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:58,100
Come on in.

1738
02:32:03,700 --> 02:32:05,700
- I'm Daisy Fuller.
- I'm David Hernandez,

1739
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:09,500
with the Orleans Parish Department
of Child Welfare Services.

1740
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:12,200
He was living in a condemned building.

1741
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:16,400
The police found this with him.

1742
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:19,400
This address.
It's got your name in it a lot.

1743
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:23,200
He's in very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

1744
02:32:23,300 --> 02:32:27,400
He doesn't seem to know who
or where he is. He's very confused.

1745
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:31,000
I was telling Mr. Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1746
02:32:31,100 --> 02:32:35,000
If he needs a place to stay,
it's all right, he can stay here.

1747
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:05,700
Benjamin?

1748
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:11,400
You play beautifully.

1749
02:33:14,900 --> 02:33:16,700
He doesn't seem to like to be touched.

1750
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:18,500
He goes in and out
of states of recognition.

1751
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:20,200
The doctors say,
if they didn't know any better,

1752
02:33:20,300 --> 02:33:22,800
he has the beginnings of dementia.

1753
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:26,300
Do you remember me?

1754
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:30,800
I'm Daisy.

1755
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:34,900
I'm Benjamin.

1756
02:33:40,600 --> 02:33:43,200
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1757
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:50,300
Would you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1758
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:55,700
Do I know you?

1759
02:34:00,700 --> 02:34:02,300
- I want some breakfast.
- And every day,

1760
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:06,400
I would stop by to make sure
that he was comfortable.

1761
02:34:06,500 --> 02:34:09,100
- No, I didn't.
- You just finished eating.

1762
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:11,500
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing!

1763
02:34:11,600 --> 02:34:14,400
You're all fucking liars!

1764
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:16,900
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1765
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:17,400
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1766
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:22,300
Now, why don't we see

1767
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:25,800
if we can't find something else
for you to do?

1768
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:29,200
I have a feeling
there's a lot of things I can't remember.

1769
02:34:29,300 --> 02:34:31,200
Well, like what, sugar?

1770
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:36,400
It's like there's this whole life I had,

1771
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:40,300
and I can't remember what it was.

1772
02:34:43,100 --> 02:34:44,400
It's okay.

1773
02:34:46,500 --> 02:34:48,000
It's okay to forget things.

1774
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:53,800
Many times, he would simply forget
who or where he was.

1775
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:55,800
There he is, he's up there on the roof.

1776
02:34:55,900 --> 02:34:57,600
It wasn't easy.

1777
02:34:57,700 --> 02:35:00,000
- Benjamin!
- I can see everything!

1778
02:35:00,100 --> 02:35:01,800
- I can see the big river!
- That's right,

1779
02:35:01,900 --> 02:35:03,700
you can see everything, sweetheart.

1780
02:35:03,800 --> 02:35:05,800
I can see the graveyard
where Mama's buried,

1781
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:09,200
- and all those other people.
- I want you to come down!

1782
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:13,100
- What if I could fly?
- I knew a man who could fly.

1783
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:17,000
You come down
and I'll tell you all about him.

1784
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:22,200
Somebody go up there.

1785
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:31,800
He was five when I moved in.

1786
02:35:31,900 --> 02:35:36,300
Nearly the same age I was
when I had met him.

1787
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:46,300
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1788
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:48,800
"at 5:00 in the afternoon

1789
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:52,400
"when he had got
his beautiful hind legs."

1790
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:54,900
The days passed.

1791
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:59,300
And I watched as he forgot how to walk

1792
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:07,000
- and how to talk.
- What's my name?

1793
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:08,800
I'm Daisy.

1794
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:11,700
Can you say "Daisy"?

1795
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:18,500
In 2002, they put up a new clock
in that train station.

1796
02:36:25,400 --> 02:36:29,100
And in the spring of 2003,

1797
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:35,200
he looked at me

1798
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:42,800
and I knew that he knew who I was.

1799
02:36:46,300 --> 02:36:52,100
And then he closed his eyes
as if to go to sleep.

1800
02:37:24,700 --> 02:37:28,800
- I wish I'd known him.
- Now you do.

1801
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:37,100
Mom, I think I should go see
what's going on.

1802
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:46,200
Good night, Benjamin.

1803
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:10,900
We're expecting flash flooding
after the levee break.

1804
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,300
It occurred in the Ninth Ward.

1805
02:38:16,300 --> 02:38:19,200
Some people are born to sit by a river.

1806
02:38:20,700 --> 02:38:22,600
Some get struck by lightning.

1807
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:26,600
Some have an ear for music.

1808
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:29,900
Some are artists.

1809
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:32,500
Some swim.

1810
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:35,600
Some know buttons.

1811
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:38,800
Some know Shakespeare.

1812
02:38:39,900 --> 02:38:41,700
Some are mothers.

1813
02:38:43,700 --> 02:38:46,700
And some people dance.
