1
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,550
Testing, testing, One, two, One, two,

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,554
Okay, that's good, Ready, Mom?

3
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,262
Okay, how do you want me to sit?

4
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,567
Anyway you want,
I'm just glad you're finally doing this,

5
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,333
All right, Go ahead, Start,

6
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,502
Great, So, why...

7
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,513
You're just gonna ask me questions, right?

8
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,311
- Hence the "why."
- All right,

9
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:56,952
I guess I better be careful answering
if this is gonna be how you remember me,

10
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,304
Mr. Bergman?

11
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,506
Mr. Bergman?

12
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,443
Your coffee.

13
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:21,844
Oh, right.

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,977
Thanks.

15
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,390
Is it okay?

16
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,228
You'd hardly know it was instant.

17
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,538
- Hey.
- Hey.

18
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,203
When are the boys coming?

19
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,805
Barry's flying the redeye tonight,

20
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,545
and Matthew's driving,
so I guess two days.

21
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,849
And he's not alone.

22
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,752
Welcome to
Wilmington International Airport,

23
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:04,881
Oh, great.

24
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,119
For your security, do not leave...

25
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,024
How's she doing?

26
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:12,428
Sick. In pain. She nods off a lot.

27
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,864
You better start reading.

28
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,469
- There's an instruction manual?
- You're gonna wanna read it.

29
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:23,566
Well, just too bad nobody ever comes back
and tells these guys if they got it right.

30
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:25,942
That's me.

31
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,381
Holy shit!

32
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,895
Well, if we study the literature,
maybe we can grow from this experience.

33
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:47,399
Absolutely. Yeah.
I own the whole Good Tragedy series.

34
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,401
Enjoy your Parasitic Infection,

35
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,666
Making the Most of Incest,
that was a good one.

36
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,642
I especially enjoyed
Congratulations! Your Child's an Addict,

37
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,337
- Will you just read it?
- Give me a break, Em.

38
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,039
- This whole thing sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

39
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,809
And I've been down here
with Mom and Jim

40
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,679
all by myself all week watching it happen.

41
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,653
And I don't have anyone else to talk to,
and so I went to a bookstore.

42
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:09,915
Sorry.

43
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,958
Yeah, I know
you've been working really hard, okay?

44
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,123
And I will read the book.

45
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,994
Okay.

46
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,400
- They must have been happy to see you.
- Yeah, they are.

47
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,772
I mean, there's only the two of them,
and they really need the help.

48
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,902
No, I meant the bookstore.

49
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,679
Fuck you, Keith.

50
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,842
This is News 6 at 11:00,

51
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,752
Southeastern North Carolina's
most watched 11:00 newscast,

52
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,552
Another missing persons case tonight
with a Blaine County connection,

53
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,991
Mom? Keith's here.

54
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,621
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

55
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,528
Glad you could come.

56
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,433
I had to get a few things settled.
Take care of a little business, remember?

57
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,265
Yes, I remember.

58
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,771
You're my oldest son,

59
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,534
the one who called me
every day this week.

60
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,044
- Yeah, I was just...
- I'm dying, not senile.

61
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,640
- Yes, Mother.
- Don't "Yes, Mother" me.

62
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,581
Hand me the clicker.

63
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,548
Thanks.

64
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,686
All right.

65
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,286
Go get settled.

66
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,803
Why did you fire your first oncologist?

67
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,601
You wanna know that for posterity?

68
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,232
I'm a trained film professional,

69
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,972
I'll ask the questions,
you answer them, okay?

70
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,877
Well,
when I asked him how I was gonna die,

71
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:46,317
he said my intestines would clog up
and I'd puke myself to death,

72
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,717
Which turns out to be true,

73
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,120
But I figured, for $275 a visit,

74
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,387
I deserved a little better
bedside manner than that,

75
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,519
I'll be out
for the 9:30 conference call this morning,

76
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,029
but I'll be available on my cell.

77
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,724
Leave the "B" calls on voicemail.

78
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,733
Tell Swisher
I need her Cisco report by 3:30,

79
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,462
that's 3:30 p.m. my time, by e-mail,

80
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,163
and I'll call you if I think of anything else.

81
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,536
I'll be back as soon as I can. Later.

82
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,474
You forgot to tell them
how to wipe their asses.

83
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,773
So, is it front to back or back to front?

84
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,678
Either way is fine.
I like employees to have a little autonomy.

85
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,682
Do Mom and Jim have DSL?

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,342
- No.
- No.

87
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,446
Well, listen, I'll stay as long as I can,
but I'm really busy.

88
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,990
What time is it?

89
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,824
On the West Coast, it's 5:45 a.m.
Up and at 'em, tiger.

90
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,021
Thanks for waking me.

91
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,292
- You see Mom?
- Not yet.

92
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,235
- In that case, thanks for waking me first.
- I'll see her.

93
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,364
I'll see her. I'm just waiting,
you know, to see if she feels up to it.

94
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,500
If who feels up to it?

95
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,010
Keith, come on,
you know I hate all that stuff.

96
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,604
That's what being here is all about,

97
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,149
blood, IVs,

98
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,485
puking.

99
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,813
Yeah.

100
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,153
Listen, they're playing your song.

101
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,591
A little help here!

102
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,603
Let's walk to the bathroom.

103
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,236
- I'm so sorry.
- Here. No, stop it.

104
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,808
- Hi, Barry.
- Mom.

105
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,452
- Thanks for coming.
- Wouldn't miss it.

106
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,956
- Hey, Barry.
- Hey, Em.

107
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,049
Can you clean up the bed?

108
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,019
Sure.

109
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,883
My cowboy sheets.

110
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,156
Awesome.

111
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,767
- How's it going?
- Almost done.

112
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,020
- You set here?
- Sure.

113
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,072
Keith, she's puking up shit.

114
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,674
Yeah.

115
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,752
Look, the honest to God truth,
I'm down here because my mother's dying.

116
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,055
I want you to do this for her.

117
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,119
Yeah, it's like her last wish,
something she never had.

118
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,064
Yeah, she really wants
high-speed Internet access.

119
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,591
No good. She'll be dead by then.
Is there some kind of rush fee I can pay?

120
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,804
Oh, this whole dying-mother thing
really motivates people.

121
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,809
- It's too bad you can only use it once.
- Do you think?

122
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,277
Here you go.

123
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,372
- What's this?
- A cheat sheet from the hospice.

124
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,885
"The stages of dying."

125
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,319
They're coming tomorrow.
We have to be ready.

126
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,256
Haven't you seen the bumper stickers,
"One day at a time"?

127
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,451
That's my philosophy.

128
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,223
You Hollywood guys,
always in and out of rehab.

129
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,594
You make me sick.
What is it, booze again?

130
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,190
It may be AA, but it's also Zen.

131
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,929
Be in the moment.

132
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,563
Nothing happens until it happens.

133
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,699
I can't affect the future,
so I choose not to worry about it.

134
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,175
- That's called denial.
- Exactly.

135
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,303
In LA we call it Zen.

136
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,816
Kind of a mystical, far-Eastern denial.
You know, alcoholics can be like that.

137
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,078
- Well, I'm not an alcoholic.
- Well, not yet.

138
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,484
I know it's hard, just listen.

139
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,991
"Death is a natural process.
It is normal to feel emotional."

140
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,355
Bullshit.

141
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,860
When it's my turn,

142
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,092
they're gonna have to carry me out
kicking and screaming.

143
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,168
- Denial.
- Total.

144
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,066
- No.
- You said that I would have the table...

145
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,131
I said you could have the car,
not the dining room table.

146
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,766
It's an heirloom.

147
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,175
What am I gonna eat on?

148
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,682
- Mom, none of us really want the...
- Hush, hush, hush, hush.

149
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,740
What about the armoire?

150
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,581
We bought that together.

151
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,484
Give it to Emily.

152
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,683
- All right, then I get to keep the table?
- Done.

153
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,628
- Fine.
- Write that down.

154
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,795
I just wanna make sure
you all get your fair share.

155
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,710
What's next?

156
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:19,383
So, I read about a new clinical trial
on the Web yesterday.

157
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,886
Now, I know it's a long shot,
but I e-mailed them.

158
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,650
And I thought maybe we'll get a hit
before hospice comes.

159
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,782
Keith.

160
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,658
Then I got into this chat group
that reviews local hospices,

161
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,754
so I know which nurses to look out for.

162
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,423
- Then...
- Keith.

163
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,832
Honey, you can't problem-solve your way
out of this one.

164
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,370
Well, I was just doing what I can.

165
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,640
- It's kind of a...
- Zen thing.

166
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,711
I know, Emily told me.

167
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,908
Okay.

168
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,496
Tell me the story of my birth,

169
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,725
What story?

170
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,531
The one you tell me every year
when you call me on my birthday,

171
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,629
- I don't,
- Yeah, you do,

172
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,174
I do? How boring,

173
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,573
Okay,

174
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,577
Well, you were my first baby
and you had a very big head,

175
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,514
which is not a good combo,

176
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,814
It was before Lamaze,

177
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,378
and so they just
put me in a room by myself,

178
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,549
and let me writhe there
until they thought I was ready,

179
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,652
And then they gave me a total block,
not an epidural or anything,

180
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,926
so I couldn't move my arms and legs
and barely knew where I was,

181
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,663
And they tied down my hands,
and then two big nurses pushed on me,

182
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,604
I didn't get to push
or be involved in any way,

183
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,870
And then, all of a sudden,
I wasn't pregnant anymore,

184
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,810
and I was back in the room
and your father was there,

185
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,212
and I started screaming,
"Where's my baby? Where's my baby?"

186
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:02,084
And so, then the nurses brought you in
so I could see you,

187
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:06,454
and then I started to cry
and my nose was running,

188
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,188
because you were the ugliest baby
I had ever seen,

189
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,826
So ugly,

190
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,730
Yeah, but I got better looking, right?

191
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,466
Jesus.

192
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,065
What time is it?

193
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,709
Oh, God, it's 6:00.

194
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,717
Forgot to change watch.

195
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,246
Hospice is here.

196
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,961
Best family reunion ever, eh, Bar?

197
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,957
I'm very pleased that we have
Carol available to work with you.

198
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,333
Oh, she's good. Very, very good.

199
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:56,272
- She was Gilda Radner's hospice nurse.
- Really?

200
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,503
How did that turn out for her?

201
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,840
In the end?

202
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,813
- Who?
- Gilda.

203
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,548
She died.

204
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,513
I see.

205
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:24,827
So, how long do you think
this process will take?

206
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,362
Well, the process is different
for each individual. It's...

207
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,305
- Very different.
- Very different, right. Yeah.

208
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,244
But, I mean, if you had to guess?
Just for planning purposes.

209
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,249
Well, normally, I'd expect
that she'd have very little time left.

210
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:43,277
But for a dying person,
your mother is looking very healthy.

211
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,321
So if you had to pin it down?

212
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,987
Well, I'd say very little time.

213
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,529
I see.

214
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,566
Could I check in with you
on another thing?

215
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,657
Sure.

216
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,463
What happens with the leftover morphine?

217
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,935
- Keith!
- Oh, well,

218
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,495
after the dying process is completed,

219
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,805
we'll dispose of remaining narcotics
according to federal law.

220
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:09,280
If you have any other important questions,
please don't hesitate to call, day or night.

221
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,838
Carol will be over at 3:00.

222
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,578
- Thank you so much for your help.
- Thank you.

223
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,618
- I call morphine.
- Percodan!

224
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,488
- Guys, I'm not in the mood.
- You're just pissed 'cause you didn't call it.

225
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,120
I bet if we'd flown Mom to LA,
we could've gotten a bigger star's nurse.

226
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,356
I don't know.

227
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,331
I think Gilda's top of the A-list
for ovarian cancer.

228
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,300
- Yeah, I was thinking all terminal illnesses.
- Oh, I see.

229
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,496
Why don't you both shut the fuck up?

230
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,936
I mean it.

231
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,206
Cousin Eve? It's Keith.

232
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,976
Aunt Wilma? It's Emily.

233
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,074
Yeah, it has been a while.

234
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,116
Emily!

235
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,350
Not that well, really.
That's why I'm calling.

236
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,653
I'm sorry, you want what back?

237
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,587
When did she borrow it?

238
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,688
No, not long, I'm afraid.

239
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,830
Well, that would depend
on what you meant exactly by "long."

240
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,999
Not long.

241
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,897
I'm supposed to be
in Singapore next week.

242
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,805
Okay read that back to me.

243
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,502
I'm getting phone finger here.

244
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:20,178
Would you mind calling the Scotts,
the Weidermans and the Parkers?

245
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,244
I really don't know
what to say to these people.

246
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,153
- Well...
- Sorry.

247
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,794
Hello?

248
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,737
Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah. Hold on.

249
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,803
It's for you.

250
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,379
Hello?

251
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,709
Hey, Dad.

252
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:58,756
Okay, so I set the nutrient IV
up into the port-a-cath.

253
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,291
I'm sorry, what's that?

254
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,793
The metal valve
I've had inserted in my chest,

255
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,692
opens right into an artery,

256
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,464
chemo gets in quicker.

257
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,825
- You don't leak, do you?
- Haven't yet.

258
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,394
It's one-way.

259
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,236
The morphine dispenser
hooks into the same line.

260
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,369
So, if you're feeling any pain,
just press the button.

261
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,107
You wanna try it?

262
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,410
It's on a timer, so you can give yourself
a dose whenever you need it,

263
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,149
but you can't OD.

264
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,681
The box only allows
one dose every 10 minutes to start.

265
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,227
What if I need more?

266
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,992
I can increase the dosage
and the frequency as you need it.

267
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,791
- Yeah, Keith?
- Do we each get one?

268
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,666
Sorry.

269
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,851
I thought you quit that stuff after college.

270
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,854
I did.

271
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,482
A grip on my last shoot gave me this.

272
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,686
We were talking about dying relatives.

273
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,993
It's good to see you're dealing with this
in an open, straightforward way.

274
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,056
Just takes the edge off.

275
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,203
Dad called.

276
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,299
Did they talk?

277
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,139
Yeah, 20 minutes.

278
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,441
- What about?
- She wouldn't say.

279
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,183
Why did you and Dad split up?

280
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,461
I don't know,

281
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,567
What were we talking about?

282
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,839
Nothing, Mom. Why don't you rest?

283
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,780
Don't start with me.
What were we talking about?

284
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,612
The antique clocks.

285
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,550
The antique clocks. All right.

286
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,085
So I have divvied them up.

287
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,293
You can trade, but no fighting.

288
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,023
- Got it?
- Got it.

289
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,089
Open that, after.

290
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,895
Oh.

291
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,171
And there's this.

292
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,174
- You wrote your own obituary?
- I had some time.

293
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,751
Do you have anything for, you know,

294
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,389
the funeral?

295
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,624
Just cremate me. No funeral.

296
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,295
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

297
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,701
I don't think I can be there anyway.

298
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,421
- Hey, Matthew.
- Hey.

299
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,982
Hey, Matthew.

300
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:28,259
- How was the trip?
- My ass has been asleep since Virginia.

301
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,928
I didn't even see his lips move.

302
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,872
Come in and say hi.
And then I've got a book for you to read.

303
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,501
Hey.

304
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:46,547
- I'm giving you the best stuff.
- It's not who gets what jewelry.

305
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,349
- It's that bitch getting any of it.
- Oh, she's your brother's wife.

306
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,856
- I thought you hated her.
- I never said that.

307
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,122
You did, actually,
at their wedding reception.

308
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,129
Egads! Was I drunk?

309
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,492
Well, I'm wiser now.
They're married, for better or for worse.

310
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:06,026
Don't make him choose
between his family and his wife.

311
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,634
Hi, Jim.

312
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,408
- Julia. Come on in. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

313
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,552
All I did was kiss a few boys.

314
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:26,557
You were in the janitor's closet
doing it with Harry Wexler.

315
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,650
- Yes.
- My God, Harry Wexler?

316
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,719
But discretion was never your strong suit.

317
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,824
If you hadn't published
their "lip ratings" in the Nottingham Rag,

318
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,994
you probably could've gotten away with it.

319
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,689
- What is this?
- Julia brought a tuna casserole.

320
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,956
Tuna, noodles,
Campbell's cream of mushroom soup.

321
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,621
- Jesus.
- I know.

322
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,263
- What are you doing?
- Everyone's gonna start bringing food.

323
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,704
We have to stay ahead of this
or we're gonna be buried.

324
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,869
Keith.

325
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,345
Keith, Julia's Mom's best friend.

326
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,173
I see what you're saying.

327
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,726
We should probably
dirty some plates, too.

328
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,227
Good idea.

329
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,560
Gerald Henderson, three lips out of 10.
He was not pleased.

330
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,432
And?

331
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,268
- He had a little dick, too.
- Oh, stop!

332
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,671
Yes, he did.

333
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,402
- Stop!
- Tiny.

334
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,918
I'm so sorry, Neat.

335
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,488
I've gotta drive back tonight.

336
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,825
I could only take the day off.

337
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,559
It's always good to see you.

338
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:22,135
They don't make friends like us anymore,
do they?

339
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,834
No. Not anymore.

340
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:34,184
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

341
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,549
Love you.

342
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,145
Thanks for coming, Julia.

343
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,155
What are you talking about?
She'd come for me, I'd come for her.

344
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,819
Well, thanks.
And the casserole, it was great.

345
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,259
Is it gonna be in Syracuse?

346
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,061
After?

347
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,864
Yeah, that's where the relatives are.

348
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,598
I'll be there. And I'll call every day.

349
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,812
- Don't you remember your grandfather?
- I was five when he died,

350
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,246
Not at all?

351
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,748
You tell me, Tell me about him,

352
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,517
He was a tailor,
He owned a dry cleaning shop,

353
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,257
And your mother?

354
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,852
Nanna was a housewife,

355
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,728
A great cook, Always entertaining,

356
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,395
- This explains why you can't sew or cook,
- Exactly,

357
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,735
Luckily Nanna is still with us,
so I don't have to,

358
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,375
- What?
- Nothing,

359
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,751
All my grandkids are about five,

360
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,955
Some of them younger,

361
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,093
- Hey, you guys! Hey!
- Daddy!

362
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,129
- How was your flight?
- Airplane!

363
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,033
- Airplane, was there an airplane? Really?
- Yes, Daddy.

364
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,036
- Yeah?
- We slept on the airplane.

365
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,901
- Did you?
- No.

366
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,736
- No?
- No.

367
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,139
- Hey.
- Hi.

368
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,441
The redeye always seems
like such a good idea, right?

369
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,073
Oh, yeah. That's why I'm gonna let you
do it all by yourself next time.

370
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,209
- Oh, yeah.
- Come with me.

371
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,116
- How you been, sweetie?
- So, how're you doing?

372
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,745
- Really?
- Yeah.

373
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,551
I'm glad you're here.

374
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:59,624
- Daddy, is Grandma sick?
- Yes, she is.

375
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:03,134
Will she be all better tomorrow?

376
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,170
I wish she were, Sarah,
but I'm afraid she's pretty sick.

377
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,103
Is she going to die?

378
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,343
What do you know about dying, sweetie?

379
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,539
Hanna had a fish that died,
but it got better.

380
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,742
I see.

381
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,912
Well, Grandma's not feeling well,

382
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:27,288
but I know that she's gonna be very,
very happy to see you guys. Okay?

383
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,760
Come in.

384
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,990
- Grandma!
- Grandma! Hi!

385
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,292
Hey, hi.

386
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:38,930
Come on up here. Come on.
Oh, my goodness, that was...

387
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,336
- Oh, did you make these for me?
- Yeah.

388
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,135
Thank you so much!

389
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,268
- Hey, Ben, did you ride on an airplane?
- No.

390
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:49,939
- You didn't?
- We came to see you 'cause you're sick.

391
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,610
I'm so glad you did. Thank you.

392
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,916
- Do you have any toys for us?
- Sarah, that's not nice.

393
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,446
It's just fine.
I do happen to have something for you.

394
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,119
Dad, in the top drawer over there.

395
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,652
Something for Sarah
and something for Ben.

396
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,199
Let me see. Okay.

397
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,531
This is for you.

398
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,401
Oh, it's a shark.

399
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,498
And for Sarah I have a kitty.

400
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,477
- What do you say?
- Thank you, Grandma.

401
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,069
- Oh, you're...
- Thank you.

402
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,012
You're so welcome.

403
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,879
Give me a hug.

404
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,112
Oh, I love you guys.

405
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,917
Hey, guys, why don't you
go show Mommy your toys,

406
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:37,223
and then Grandma
can rest a little bit? Okay?

407
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,956
- Bye.
- Bye, Grandma.

408
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,794
I got lipstick on you.
Bye, honey. See you later, okay?

409
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,528
- See you later.
- Okay.

410
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,128
See you. Bye.
- Goodbye.

411
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,435
- See you.
- See you.

412
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,013
Do you still want to go
to the beach today?

413
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,719
You sure?
'Cause maybe we should go tomorrow.

414
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,980
Today.

415
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,352
Today.

416
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,924
Who is that woman?

417
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,899
- With Barry?
- Yeah.

418
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,702
That's Suzanne, his wife.

419
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,606
She flew in with the kids last night,
remember?

420
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:28,134
Don't be smart.
I just can't see too well, that's all.

421
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,178
How you doing?

422
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,252
Ready to go home?

423
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,587
How long have we been here?

424
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,393
Forty-five minutes.

425
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,163
Not yet.

426
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,263
You sure?

427
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,396
You look tired.

428
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,301
You paid $10 for parking.
I want you to get your money's worth.

429
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,369
I'm good for the 10 bucks, Mom.

430
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,416
- Don't start, Keith.
- Okay.

431
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,948
You don't get weather like this every day.

432
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,500
That looks good.

433
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:35,177
- It's no Motel 6, but...
- We said you could stay here.

434
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,044
Right. On the floor? Thank you.

435
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,107
Give me a break.
I can't believe you're whining...

436
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:43,484
I'm sorry but what kind of break did you
give me when I was in the hospital?

437
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,353
- Did any of you call or write?
- You had your adenoids out.

438
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,790
You were there for three hours.

439
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,920
You know, it is so obvious
that I am not welcome in this family.

440
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,258
Not one of you cares about anything...

441
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,094
That explains why you're rifling
through the jewelry box

442
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,758
so you can buy someone
who gives a shit about you.

443
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:00,828
I actually think of it more as payment for
being forced to hang out with you people.

444
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,339
I just came here to help Matthew.

445
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,635
What's with the "you people" thing?

446
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:10,374
Are we a cult now?

447
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,644
She's just here to help.
Why is it always about Katrina anyway?

448
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,655
- What about Miss Perfect?
- Emily's a mess.

449
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:23,285
Yes, I know. Her mother's dying.
Oh, wait, mine is, too!

450
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,524
Look, maybe if Katrina
just gave her a little space,

451
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,293
- just took the night off...
- You guys don't even try.

452
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,424
You don't even reach out to her.

453
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,661
You know, she has feelings, too.

454
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,033
Yeah, but if she's here to help,
why should we be reaching out?

455
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,004
I'm sorry, isn't she part of the family?

456
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,734
It's her mother-in-law.

457
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,867
Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

458
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,672
Matthew, I'm not.

459
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,744
You know, I've never seen you cry.

460
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,809
- Oh, please, not again. I cry.
- When?

461
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,882
I cried at our wedding.

462
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,221
I sniff a little at really sad commercials.

463
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,523
What, is there some amount
that I'm supposed to cry?

464
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:02,760
No. I just think it's perfectly normal,
with your mother dying, I mean...

465
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:06,326
I'm fine. Sherry, really. Honestly, I'm fine.

466
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,998
I just... I'm playing it as it goes.

467
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,700
You're not gonna give me the Zen speech,
are you?

468
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,005
Well, not unless you make me.

469
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,406
I just think tomorrow, you know,

470
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,506
when I leave,
you're gonna bottle this all up.

471
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:22,644
As soon as I cry,
I'll e-mail you the digital photos.

472
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,952
Come on. We have DSL.

473
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,060
- Rice?
- No, thank you. I have...

474
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:40,863
Good.

475
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,538
I want a sparerib.

476
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,411
Mom, you can't eat.

477
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,781
You'll get sick again.
It's got nowhere to go.

478
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,220
Do you want to sit and spit, Mom?

479
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:00,948
What?

480
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,960
Gilda used to do it.
Carol told us. When she...

481
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,964
When she couldn't eat,
she would chew the food but not swallow.

482
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,796
Yeah. Sit and spit.

483
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,463
Let me sit and spit.

484
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,501
Okay.

485
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,377
Can I have a bowl, please?

486
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,850
And the spareribs?

487
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,724
God.

488
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,564
I love spareribs.

489
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,241
I love Kung Pao chicken!

490
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,596
Matthew, that's enough.
Your eyes are bigger than your stomach.

491
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,361
Mom, I'm 27 years old.

492
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,265
I think I can figure out
how much food I can eat.

493
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,769
Bullshit!

494
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:23,773
No son of mine
could possibly be 27 years old.

495
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,468
He's older.

496
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,636
Well, that's true.

497
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,043
I am, too.

498
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,647
Sorry, Mom.

499
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,117
And you married an old guy, too.

500
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,813
Oh, God.

501
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,289
You are all so worthless.

502
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,958
Oh, boy.

503
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,327
You can't say that.

504
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,798
- You can't say that.
- Why not?

505
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,924
Are you okay?

506
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,049
Shut it down.

507
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,721
The TV?

508
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,187
The IV.

509
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,892
But without the nutrients you'll just...

510
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,194
- Oh, Mom.
- I asked Carol.

511
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,399
She said it would make things go quicker.

512
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,966
Shut it down.

513
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:42,117
No one should have to go through...

514
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,554
Mom?

515
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,896
Good night, Mom.

516
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,313
Well, actually,
we always planned to stop at three,

517
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,476
What happened?

518
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,160
As I recall,
it was a great big bottle of Mateus,

519
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,494
which is a pink kind of rose wine,

520
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:05,195
Your father got a great big bottle
for Christmas one year,

521
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,864
He would make a candleholder
out of the bottle afterward,

522
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:14,477
Wait, wait, so, Matthew was an accident?

523
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,184
You make it sound so tragic,
Cancer is an accident,

524
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,515
Matthew was a blessing,

525
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,919
Matthew, I love you,

526
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:30,385
You sent us to the circus with Julia
the day he was born,

527
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,861
When we came home,
you were there with a new baby,

528
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,161
And you were always
so scared of clowns after that,

529
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,564
Oh, yeah,

530
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,366
A little help here!

531
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:41,769
Let's go.

532
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,685
What are we doing?

533
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,821
The photographers
from House Beautiful are here,

534
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,225
and we want the place to look nice.

535
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,489
Right.

536
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,526
Hey, Katrina, can you take
that pile of sheets to the laundry?

537
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:14,059
You know, I can't do anything
until I've had my coffee.

538
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,177
Okay.

539
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,783
Matthew. Hi, Matthew.

540
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,324
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey.

541
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,859
Good morning.

542
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,822
Dad?

543
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,366
Hi, Dad.

544
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:54,810
I try not to be, but I am, sort of.

545
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,545
- Who are you talking to, Mom?
- Don't interrupt.

546
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,211
My dad's talking to me.

547
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:06,086
"It is common for the dying to converse
with loved ones that have already died.

548
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:10,252
"Be calm and reassuring,
and listen carefully."

549
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,657
Where is Grandpa, Mom?

550
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,131
He's there.

551
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,563
He's there.

552
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,347
- Is there a window open in here?
- No.

553
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,815
I will try.

554
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,077
I love you, too.

555
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,857
I love you, too. I will.

556
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,021
I will.

557
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,834
Come on, let's lie down.

558
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,005
No one's gonna believe this.

559
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,346
Matthew, honey,
nobody made coffee. Will you help me?

560
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,681
Or that.

561
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,562
So we'll take two-hour shifts at night,
okay?

562
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:22,063
All right. Here's the schedule. Jim. Em.

563
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,096
And there are some holes in the schedule

564
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,364
because I didn't know
if you could do them.

565
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,372
Yeah, I'll do my share.

566
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,574
So, Suzanne and the kids
are leaving tomorrow.

567
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,242
- I'm thinking I might go with them.
- What?

568
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,717
Well, I don't know
how long this is gonna take,

569
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,152
so I thought maybe I'll work a couple days,
then I'll come back.

570
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:45,347
Wait, you're kidding, right?

571
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,947
Look, Keith, I've got responsibilities,
all right?

572
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,049
I was fine with a few days,
maybe a week even,

573
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,957
but I don't know
how long this is gonna take, so...

574
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:55,397
Yeah, well, there is that life-or-death
PowerPoint presentation.

575
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,366
I don't know what I was thinking
telling you,

576
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,596
but I'm pretty sure
I was not asking permission.

577
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,797
Don't you fucking judge me.

578
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:25,795
- Katrina, are you leaving?
- Yeah, the hospital needs me. So...

579
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,661
- Aren't you in human resources?
- Yeah.

580
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,104
I just wish I could be here
to help nurse poor Anita.

581
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,536
We all do.

582
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,600
- You ready?
- Yeah.

583
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,304
- Bye.
- Bye.

584
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,705
- Take care.
- Yeah, you, too.

585
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,817
Mom, Carol's here.

586
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,655
And I brought oxygen and a catheter.

587
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,323
No. No.

588
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,263
Emily said walking
was becoming more difficult for you.

589
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,526
It is.

590
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:07,767
Mom, you're not throwing up anymore.
The only reason to get out of bed is to pee.

591
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,501
We thought it'd be easier for you
if you just stayed in bed.

592
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:13,602
Okay?

593
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,705
Okay.

594
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:22,747
Never thought I'd be sentimental
about the last time I peed.

595
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,491
She okay?

596
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,230
Yeah, I guess. She's just been sleeping.

597
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:39,065
- Barry? Barry, where are you?
- I'm here, Mom.

598
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:47,576
- Who are you?
- It's me, Mom. It's Keith.

599
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,371
You rest, okay?

600
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,612
- You know what?
- What?

601
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,007
Leave the Nintendo.

602
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,574
Sorry.

603
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:31,382
- Who's your favorite child?
- I don't have one,

604
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,616
Barry,

605
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,181
- No,
- Come on, admit it,

606
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:39,958
Look, I have spent the last 30-some
odd years trying not to play favorites,

607
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,362
And failing, Come on, admit it,

608
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:44,996
No, I...

609
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:50,304
Well, Barry is the responsible one,

610
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,070
Do you remember
that trip we took to the Adirondacks,

611
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:59,138
when Smokey the dog
was so scared of thunder

612
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:00,478
he shit all over my car?

613
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:05,887
And who was the only one to ride
with your dad when I took his car?

614
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,382
- Barry,
- Barry,

615
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,324
Yes, You see?

616
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,259
And I loved him for that,

617
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,456
He's been like that his whole life,

618
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,865
He's just always there
for whoever needs him,

619
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,234
But is he my favorite?

620
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,672
Well, I...

621
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,937
I love you all equally,

622
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,509
but it's impossible
to love you all the same,

623
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,192
All right.

624
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,390
I'll be back in a couple of days.

625
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,096
No kiss goodbye for me?

626
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:54,603
You know what? I'd stay if I could.
I'll be back in a couple of days.

627
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,163
Yeah, sure.
This isn't that important, anyway.

628
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,335
Blow me. All right? You're both freelance.
I'm the only one with a real job.

629
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,276
Look, Barry, whatever you need to do.

630
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:06,282
You can blow me, too.
I'll call you from San Francisco tonight.

631
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,051
- What?
- Nothing.

632
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:14,981
It's your call.

633
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,653
I'm doing the best I can here.

634
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,797
- Daddy?
- Yes, honey.

635
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,927
What does "blow me" mean?

636
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,732
- It means see you soon.
- Oh.

637
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,608
Listen,
what time is the HP meeting tomorrow?

638
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,168
What do you mean it's canceled?
Who canceled it?

639
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,215
- What do you mean I did?
- Did what?

640
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,580
What?

641
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:43,085
Listen, you cannot cancel my meetings
without even...

642
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,986
Are you... Well, who's gonna cover...

643
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,755
They are?

644
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,562
Hang on. No, not you.
So what you're saying is...

645
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,029
You're my assistant. You can't fire me.

646
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:01,003
What do you mean, "It's real life"?

647
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,099
Yeah.

648
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,903
Yeah. I guess.

649
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,277
Yeah, hold.

650
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,840
Will you be mad
if I don't come home right now?

651
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,647
Of course not.

652
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,484
Because, I mean, this is just work.

653
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:22,423
The other thing's real life.

654
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,760
Yeah, I know.

655
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,528
What? No. Yes, we're done.

656
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,725
Yes.

657
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,994
- Well?
- Yeah, I'm gonna stay.

658
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,904
- You guys go on ahead. I'll call you later.
- Okay.

659
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,068
- You're doing the right thing.
- You're awesome.

660
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,544
Okay. Come on, guys.

661
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,050
- Go with Mommy.
- It's time to go.

662
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,052
Where's Mommy going?

663
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,281
- Bye, Savannah.
- Mommy...

664
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,957
Hey, Daddy.

665
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,424
Blow me!

666
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,936
Excuse me.
Yeah, I need to get my bag back.

667
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,236
I'm sorry, sir. Your bag has been checked.

668
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:14,004
That's it right there, you can just grab it.

669
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,137
- Sorry.
- Oh, come on.

670
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,988
- Security.
- Hold it right there, sir!

671
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:36,557
Put the bag slowly down.
Put your arms in the air.

672
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,760
But this is my bag.

673
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:43,034
I'm not trying to sneak it onto a plane.
I'm trying to take it home.

674
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:48,111
Welcome to
Wilmington International Airport,

675
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:51,614
For your security,
do not leave bags unattended,

676
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,055
Hey, Em. Why don't you go take a break?

677
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,754
You know, walk around the block
or something?

678
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:08,025
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can. Just take my cell phone.

679
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,724
Matt and I will be here,
and we can keep an eye on things.

680
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,100
No, I promised her. I said I'd be here.

681
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:17,402
Well, this could take days.
You can't just stay in the house.

682
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:18,634
I promised.

683
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,303
Well, I promised I'd take the couch.

684
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,814
Oh, my God. Does Sherry know?

685
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,442
No, but what I was trying to say
was that...

686
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:30,817
Well, where are you gonna put it?
It doesn't go with anything you own.

687
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:33,049
Yeah, enough about the couch.
My point was that...

688
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,786
Even I wouldn't promise
to take that couch. Yuck.

689
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,657
Even if you re-covered it,
it's still a big piece of shit.

690
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,720
Okay, the couch is gross.
We know the couch is gross.

691
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,163
What I was trying to say was that...

692
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:46,760
My point was that we all,
you know, promise things to dying people

693
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,771
in moments of weakness.

694
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:54,002
And... Well, just take a break.

695
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,170
She'll be fine for 45 minutes.

696
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,045
I can't. I promised.

697
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,641
Hello?

698
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:04,516
It's a mother-daughter thing, I guess.

699
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,920
- Okay. I guess.
- It's Barry.

700
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,785
How are you gonna get it to California?

701
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:25,032
Now, a $5,000 bail seems pretty fair to me.

702
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:28,635
- You did try to steal your own suitcase.
- Fucking crackers.

703
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,203
Actually, I'm kind of glad
that you can't leave the state.

704
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,578
Blow me.

705
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,215
Attaboy.

706
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,918
Patients on a high dose of morphine
develop tolerance,

707
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,391
and the pain can be intense.

708
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,089
So, I'm increasing her dosage
to eight milliliters

709
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:50,292
and the frequency to five-minute intervals.

710
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,429
Anita.

711
00:47:56,506 --> 00:48:00,340
If you can't press the button,
we can press it for you, okay?

712
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,180
Mom?

713
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,481
Mom, what do you need?

714
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,919
Do you want more morphine, Anita?

715
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:13,880
Morphine, Mom?

716
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,653
Maybe something's wrong with the pillow.

717
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,700
I don't know, Mom.

718
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,377
I don't know what you need.

719
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:35,706
Hug her.

720
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,006
What?

721
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,616
Hug her.

722
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:21,781
I'm right here.

723
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,588
I'm right here.

724
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,897
- I'll sit with you, okay?
- Yeah.

725
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,065
Yeah.

726
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,075
Jim?

727
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:49,644
What?

728
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,446
What are you doing?

729
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,582
What am I supposed to do?

730
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:59,320
You people, you're like locusts.

731
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,629
You come into my house,

732
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,302
and you just take over.

733
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:13,168
It's just, she's our mother. You know?

734
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:15,177
She's my wife.

735
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:21,241
I mean, we've been together for 13 years.

736
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,410
I didn't know.

737
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,182
You didn't know that it'd been that long?

738
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:28,088
You didn't know that I loved your mother?

739
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,790
Or you didn't even know that I was here?

740
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,535
Just go downstairs, all right?
I'll be fine tomorrow.

741
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,319
Hey.

742
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,993
Anything?

743
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:10,928
She was moaning a little.

744
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,767
So I've been hitting the morphine
every 10 minutes or so.

745
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,136
She didn't wake up?

746
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,300
No, that was it today.

747
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:22,174
She stayed for the grandkids,
but that was it.

748
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,777
You think?

749
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,343
Yeah.

750
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,035
We bought these
because they're indestructible,

751
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:56,912
They're gonna be
worth something someday,

752
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,447
They're real wood,

753
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,783
I know you kids
don't like some of these things,

754
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:06,482
but they're important,
They've been in the family for years,

755
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,957
You can sell some of them if you want to,
but you cannot give them away,

756
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,994
They're much too valuable,

757
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,189
You mean like the couch?

758
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,526
You are gonna thank me one day
for making you take that couch,

759
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,434
You just wait,

760
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,904
Yeah, sure,

761
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,047
It's Yom Kippur Friday.

762
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,054
- So?
- It's the Day of Atonement.

763
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,919
Well, since we're only half Jewish,

764
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,255
I like to think of it
as the Morning of Atonement.

765
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,623
I take the afternoon off.

766
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,162
This is like the Christmas
of Jewish holidays.

767
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,461
I'm thinking we should
get a rabbi in to come visit Mom.

768
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,967
- Mom?
- Yeah.

769
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,761
- Our mom?
- I'm just...

770
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,863
It's something I'm thinking about,
that's all.

771
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,701
- Hello, dear.
- Hi.

772
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,473
- You must be Keith.
- Yeah.

773
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,811
I am your mother's friend, Sylvia.

774
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:06,974
Oh, please, come in.

775
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,951
Oh, no. I won't trouble you,
but I brought you this.

776
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,922
- Your mother said it's your favorite.
- Oh, thank you. What is it?

777
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,389
Tuna casserole.

778
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,722
I made it with cream of mushroom soup

779
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:20,922
and some of those
fancy canned onion rings, right on top.

780
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:23,830
- Wow. Hi, I'm Matthew.
- Hi, Matthew.

781
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,492
This is great.

782
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:28,129
- I'm gonna check on you again tomorrow.
- Okay, all right.

783
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,604
- Bye.
- Bye.

784
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:39,581
Hey, Matthew, it was really nice of you
to tell that lady that you love that stuff.

785
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,776
What are you talking about?

786
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,883
- You want some?
- No, thank you.

787
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,159
Come on, we are never
gonna get this place cleaned out.

788
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,400
Why would she keep
her expired driver's license from 1987?

789
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:07,842
Let me see that.
It's a good picture. We should keep this.

790
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,139
Come on.

791
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:13,641
Mr. Ruthless is in the house.
What about these?

792
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,483
I don't know. They're so Mom.

793
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,286
What the hell? Look.

794
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:26,022
I especially like this one of you with
your mouth open, chewing on a hot dog.

795
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,724
- It was a tofu dog.
- Of course it was.

796
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,426
Hey, guys, look at this.

797
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,471
"Dr. Vannick, chemo,

798
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:45,105
"blood test, chemo,

799
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,479
"support group, blood test."

800
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,313
Jesus.

801
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,779
She had an appointment every day
for the last three months.

802
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,484
That's a lot of work.

803
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,924
After five years of that,
I wouldn't want surgery either.

804
00:54:58,762 --> 00:54:59,820
No.

805
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,189
No.

806
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,396
I'm sorry. It feels like grave robbing.

807
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,932
Jim, if that money goes to probate,

808
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:13,032
it'll be tied up for a year
and the lawyers will get 100%.

809
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,743
- I don't know.
- Jim.

810
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:24,542
By next week, you're going to be
up to your ass in medical bills.

811
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,614
Yeah.

812
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:32,391
- All right. I'm in, okay?
- Well done.

813
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:33,622
- Good.
- Good.

814
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,823
How's it coming?

815
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,230
Well, I got pretty good
when I skipped school,

816
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,200
but it's been a while.

817
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:42,670
Forgery's like riding a bicycle,
you never forget how.

818
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,640
I've heard.

819
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:51,770
- What do I get to do?
- You're driving the getaway car.

820
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,389
Ready? Let's go.

821
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,411
If you hear gunfire,

822
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:28,144
make sure the engine's running
and the doors are unlocked.

823
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,527
How is Mrs. Bergman?

824
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,529
- Not well.
- Fine, thanks.

825
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:45,395
She's fine, fine.
She's not well enough to come in.

826
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,901
- She has a bit of a cold.
- Right.

827
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,939
So she asked us
to close her account for her.

828
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,373
Just a moment.

829
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:10,349
I just want to say how great it is to be
working with the two surviving Stooges.

830
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,919
- We were supposed to say, "Not well."
- Well, yeah.

831
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,329
- The whole point of being here...
- Real smooth, Jim.

832
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:17,491
She's dying.

833
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,091
We're not supposed to tell her she's dying.

834
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:20,295
Here she comes.

835
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,072
We know.

836
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,576
You know?

837
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:31,807
I told him.

838
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,475
- See, the thing is...
- It was all my idea.

839
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,816
I talked them both into coming here.

840
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:39,714
I know...

841
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:43,088
I know we should have done it
when she was feeling better, but I didn't...

842
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:46,060
Bedelia's sister works
at the cancer center.

843
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:52,395
Please tell Ms. Bergman that we all hope
to see her in here again real soon.

844
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,536
- Thank you.
- Sure.

845
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,267
- Thank you.
- We will.

846
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,640
- Bedelia will cut your check.
- Oh, well, thank you.

847
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,377
You know,
the confessing thing worked for you,

848
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:15,220
but next time, just rat out Barry
'cause he's already got a record.

849
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,553
Blow me.

850
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:20,719
Well, The Dying Experience says
religious support can be very comforting.

851
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,890
- To who?
- No, "whom."

852
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:27,625
Well, I guess
I just don't find rabbis all that comforting.

853
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,899
But rabbits are comforting, though.

854
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,965
All soft and fuzzy.
We could get one of those.

855
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,669
Your mother's not very religious.

856
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:38,874
- Well, maybe if we had someone here...
- Em, she's comatose.

857
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:43,743
The books say that nobody knows
what comatose people can hear.

858
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,516
Besides,
Mom doesn't like rabbis all that much.

859
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:50,685
The last time she set foot in a synagogue
was Matthew's bar mitzvah.

860
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,784
Yeah, me, too.

861
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,352
I'm not exactly clear on
why I even had a bar mitzvah.

862
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,897
- To piss off Dad.
- To piss Dad off.

863
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,593
Oh, yeah. Hey, you guys
remember Aunt Eva's rabbit?

864
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:00,499
- Excuse me.
- Is she the one who lived at the junkyard?

865
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,300
Yeah. But she didn't call it a junkyard,
she called it an antique yard.

866
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,841
- Died a multi-millionaire.
- Excuse me.

867
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,434
We should have visited more often.

868
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,604
Will you guys just shut up?

869
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,016
Mom's dying.

870
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,516
That's what religion is for.

871
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:18,918
I'm calling a rabbi.
Does anyone wanna fight about it?

872
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:22,415
No.

873
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,486
Emily's my best friend,

874
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,087
I talk to her two or three times a day,

875
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:31,224
I love her to death, Em, I do,

876
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,564
- But?
- But?

877
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,103
Well...

878
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:48,077
But I don't know that I did her any favors
making her my best friend,

879
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,516
Especially during the divorce,

880
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:57,550
She took everything on
like it was her job to support me,

881
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:01,997
I would come home and discuss my dates
with my 14-year-old daughter,

882
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:07,368
She seemed so grown up,

883
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:15,808
I remember we were on vacation
at Raquette Lake,

884
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:18,574
right after your father and I separated,

885
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:22,049
And you were fooling around
with that married cop,

886
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,915
You knew about that?

887
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,386
Well, she was very grown up,

888
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,515
but she couldn't keep a secret
to save her life,

889
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:31,617
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago,

890
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,788
She keeps secrets better now, right?

891
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,529
Keith?

892
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,741
Mom?

893
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,861
It's okay to let go, Mom.

894
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,402
We'll really miss you, but it's okay.

895
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,504
I'm right here. I'm right here.

896
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,432
Thanks for coming so late, Carol.

897
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:23,438
I can increase the morphine
and the frequency.

898
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,270
Well, what happens if she gets too much?

899
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:29,743
In the hospitals, they tend to err
on the side of a few more days of life.

900
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:33,646
But, in hospice, we leave that
up to the patient and their families.

901
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:36,879
So too much morphine...

902
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,655
It's up to you and your mom.

903
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,291
She's not very responsive.

904
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:48,588
- Increase the dosage.
- Okay.

905
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:58,872
How about this?

906
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,040
- That was Uncle Abe's daughter's.
- How do you know that?

907
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,373
Who's Uncle Abe?

908
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,209
It's real silver.

909
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,682
"Hong Kong. Silver plate." It's crap.

910
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:11,948
- We can't leave it.
- I am not keeping this stuff.

911
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,819
If you leave it, I'm gonna sell it.

912
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:15,949
It's sentimental.

913
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,822
- Not to me.
- Me, either.

914
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,988
Fine, I'll take it. Thank you.

915
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:26,559
I guess that's it then.
I'm gonna stash my stuff in my luggage.

916
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,836
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

917
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,244
I can go to U-Haul
and get you some boxes.

918
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,478
Thanks.

919
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:50,354
Look, Arnie, I don't want to take
advantage of the family relationship, but...

920
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,596
So, can we get it down to $650?

921
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:58,632
Great, thanks.

922
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:01,636
She wants to have them spread
on her father's grave.

923
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:05,605
Yeah, well,
so it's an Orthodox cemetery. So what?

924
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,780
Yeah. Well, we wouldn't want to piss off
a whole field of dead people,

925
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,217
now would we?

926
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,486
Yeah, well, we'll talk about it, okay?

927
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,649
Yeah, yeah. Great, great.
Thank you. Thanks, Arnie.

928
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,255
Bye.

929
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,733
Thank you for coming, Rabbi.

930
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,409
Well, I'm actually an assistant rabbi.

931
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:47,741
But I guess,
after 26 years as a Navy chaplain,

932
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,007
I know a thing or two.

933
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:52,919
Is there a prayer or something
we should say for her for Yom Kippur?

934
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:56,584
Why, she doesn't need a prayer.
She just needs to get well.

935
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,228
Anita?

936
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,424
Can you hear me?

937
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,334
You're going to be all right!

938
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:13,606
Now, I was a Navy chaplain for 26 years,
so I know a thing or two!

939
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,537
You'll be fine, okay?

940
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,983
You look good!

941
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:27,349
Now, take care, you hear?

942
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:41,897
Well, when Matthew was little,

943
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:43,461
he liked to get up
in the middle of the night

944
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,473
and come get in bed
with Mommy and Daddy,

945
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,908
which drove Daddy crazy
because he was a very light sleeper,

946
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,079
So what did you do?

947
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:56,417
Well, there was a closet door
right outside of his bedroom door,

948
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,953
so, at night, we would tie the doorknob
from the closet

949
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:03,549
onto the doorknob of his bedroom,
and that was the end of problem,

950
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,890
What if there had been a fire?

951
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,454
Oh, my God,
How did I raise such a bunch of wusses?

952
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:14,560
You guys, you grew up without seatbelts,
breathing secondhand smoke,

953
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,105
I spanked you a couple of times,

954
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:21,542
Yes, I think I even had an occasional
glass of wine when I was pregnant,

955
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,441
and you all turned out fine,

956
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,876
Except, of course,
for the psychological damage,

957
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:32,115
Let me give you one really great lesson,
don't judge us too much,

958
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:35,521
We didn't do it all wrong,
We did the best we could, And so will you,

959
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:38,059
That's all there is, Don't over-think it,

960
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,155
Not me,

961
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,355
Especially you,

962
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:53,306
You read the book?

963
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:55,902
No.

964
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,912
- None of them?
- Nope.

965
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,607
So you're not dealing with this at all?

966
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,913
- Don't "big sister" me.
- Why not? I'm your big sister.

967
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,215
I'll deal with it my own way.

968
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,449
Katrina and I talk.

969
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,452
Leave it alone, Em.

970
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:28,400
There's no food in this house
invented after 1967.

971
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:43,623
- You left your cell phone.
- Yeah.

972
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,159
Don't you think we should bring it?

973
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,524
Do you want to find out your mother died

974
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,358
in the cereal aisle of Sir Buy A Lot?

975
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:49,431
Nope.

976
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,649
Wait a minute. Excuse me.
That orange juice is on sale.

977
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:15,849
Well, do you have
a Sir Buy A Lot club card?

978
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,153
No.

979
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:20,593
Then I'm afraid it's not on sale.

980
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:22,721
But the sign on the shelf
said that it was just on sale.

981
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,823
Well, that's club members only.

982
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:29,133
Fine, so how do I join
the Sir Buy A Lot club?

983
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:43,083
- I hear it's very tough to get in.
- Well, that's right.

984
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:48,649
Look, the woman next to you
just scanned a spare card for somebody.

985
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:51,557
Well, that's against store policy.

986
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,561
I'm seeing a no-win here.

987
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,756
I'm having a bad week, okay?

988
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:59,528
And my mother brought me up to believe
that there is

989
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:04,767
a solution to every problem
if we all just try hard enough.

990
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:08,266
So tell me, please, please,

991
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:13,181
who do I have to fuck

992
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:18,243
to get the Sir Buy A Lot club price
on my orange juice?

993
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,080
I've never been thrown out
of a grocery store.

994
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,887
You get used to it.

995
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,894
And any more?

996
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,330
- What?
- Regrets,

997
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:33,966
Yes,

998
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,697
Regrets?

999
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:40,003
I regret that I won't be around to torture
you like this when you're old and sick,

1000
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,337
Hey, hey,

1001
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:45,603
So, how do you feel
about your mother dying?

1002
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,684
- Come on, Mom,
- I'm waiting,

1003
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,582
Fine, I'm thrilled,

1004
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,625
This is a growth experience
second to none,

1005
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,684
and I thank God every day
I get to go through it,

1006
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,997
You 're not gonna answer me, are you?

1007
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:10,462
This video's not about me,

1008
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:28,187
Bowel obstruction's gone.

1009
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,083
Mom took a shit.

1010
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:36,131
Great.
Let's wake her up and feed her breakfast.

1011
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,016
No, it's not like that.

1012
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:08,920
Look. No, babe,

1013
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,523
I know
you don't get along with them, but...

1014
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:16,938
They respect me. They just don't always...

1015
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,906
No, they do listen to me.

1016
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:24,410
It's just not a good time
to bring shit up, okay? Mom's...

1017
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:28,575
Yeah.

1018
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:32,078
Yeah.

1019
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,116
I'm scared.

1020
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,086
I just wish you were here.

1021
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:48,662
Her heart rate, pulse and breathing
are steady and strong.

1022
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,900
But she hasn't eaten anything
in three weeks.

1023
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,374
- Yeah.
- She's been off of IV for days.

1024
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:58,106
She had a lot of swelling
from the disease and steroids she was on.

1025
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:01,240
Swelling is just water
collecting in the tissues.

1026
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,184
- Maybe that has something to do with it.
- So...

1027
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:09,423
So she's like a camel, living off her hump.

1028
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,753
Could be.

1029
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,059
- What if she's getting better?
- Keith.

1030
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:17,257
Seriously.

1031
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,961
You know, maybe starvation
is some kind of cure for cancer.

1032
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:21,593
- Keith.
- No. What if...

1033
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:25,367
What if it's the morphine
and the starvation that are killing her?

1034
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:31,103
- What if we're doing the wrong thing?
- Come with me.

1035
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:34,114
- What if we're doing the wrong thing?
- No. Come on.

1036
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:42,982
Look.

1037
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:45,492
That's cancer.

1038
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,663
She's got so much in her, it's coming out.

1039
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:51,723
You fix one bowel obstruction,
another one grows.

1040
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:54,660
I didn't know.

1041
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:57,001
You can't do anything.

1042
01:12:57,072 --> 01:13:00,371
We tried it all before.
We're doing what she wants, okay?

1043
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,543
So, anyway, I have started to prepare

1044
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:13,111
a list of things
that I want you to do in your lifetime,

1045
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:16,646
things that I won't be here
to make sure you do,

1046
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:20,456
You know, kind of a model of how to live,

1047
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,463
A mother can't be too careful,

1048
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,123
So, this is yours,

1049
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,429
I've made some for each of you,

1050
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:30,870
I've just begun, too, It's gonna get bigger,

1051
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:32,372
Much bigger,

1052
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,736
- Why would we play this?
- It's one of her favorites!

1053
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:35,936
Over my dead body.

1054
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:38,377
I can't even stand listening to it right now.

1055
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:41,906
Is this Neil Diamond?

1056
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:46,719
- Tony Orlando and Dawn, 1973.
- I'll handle this.

1057
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:49,815
I mean, it's just, you don't play
something like this at a memorial service.

1058
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:51,826
- Sometimes you do.
- Some...

1059
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:54,954
This is our mom's memorial service
and you want...

1060
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,327
What are you kids doing?

1061
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:58,923
He doesn't want me to put this on the tape
for the memorial service.

1062
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:00,059
And she loves this song.

1063
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:02,433
Well, she loves
the Oscar Mayer wiener song, too.

1064
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,472
Do you wanna put that
on the memorial tape?

1065
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,167
Would you like one man's opinion?

1066
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:07,640
- Absolutely.
- Not really.

1067
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,303
Why don't we save it for your funeral?

1068
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,142
You can't respect an original for what it is,

1069
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:14,114
but if somebody like U2
decided to remake it,

1070
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,616
suddenly it would seem brilliant.

1071
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:18,482
I must've missed when
they announced that on their website.

1072
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:26,820
Punch out.

1073
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,654
I'm okay for a couple of hours.

1074
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,193
Nah, it's cool. I'm up.

1075
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,598
Well, maybe you should wake me
at 3:00 then.

1076
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:36,899
Barry's turn.

1077
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:40,833
Okay.

1078
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:45,313
- Did you give her morphine?
- Oh, shit!

1079
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:49,076
It's been 10 minutes. I must be really tired.

1080
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:20,508
Oh, God.

1081
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:24,975
We killed her.

1082
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,014
What do we do?

1083
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:35,354
Nothing.

1084
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:39,661
Nothing.

1085
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:49,505
Oh, Mom.

1086
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:57,211
I always thought if I could picture it,
that meant it was going to be,

1087
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,712
Like on an airplane,

1088
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:02,113
if I could picture
getting up on the other side,

1089
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:04,015
then I knew I would be safe,

1090
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,954
The funny thing is, I can...

1091
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:13,587
I can...

1092
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:17,830
I can picture the rest of my life,

1093
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:22,603
how I will be at 70 and 80 and 90,
like Nanna,

1094
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:28,002
Then why don't I get to live it?

1095
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,872
I wanna see how it turns out, damn it,

1096
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,152
I can't stand not seeing
my grandchildren grow up,

1097
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:44,922
I haven't been bad,
Not worse than anyone else,

1098
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,324
Not really,

1099
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:56,704
I deserve to see how it turns out, don't I?

1100
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,856
- To Mom.
- To Mom.

1101
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,196
I've got to make a call.

1102
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:39,171
- Carol? What...
- No. No way.

1103
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:49,450
I give you the letter.

1104
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:51,920
- The letter.
- The letter.

1105
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:06,974
"Dear Keith, Barry, Matthew, Emily,

1106
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:10,238
"I have never made a secret
of my love for you

1107
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:13,145
"or how important you are to me,

1108
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:18,380
"but maybe I've never come right out
and said 'Thank you.'

1109
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:23,285
"Thank you for turning out
to be such fantastic people.

1110
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,127
"Thank you for putting up with me

1111
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:31,859
"even though I upset your lives
through a divorce even I can't explain,

1112
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:46,804
"And thank you
for being there for me in all the best ways

1113
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:49,578
"that kids can be there for their parents.

1114
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:57,218
"I know you'll be sad now,
because, after all, I am your mother,

1115
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,828
"but we've had a lot of fun and good times

1116
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:05,492
"and that's how I'd like to be remembered.

1117
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:09,401
"Use your own judgment
about the memorial service, I like it small,

1118
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:13,635
"but it seems to be more your decision
on saying goodbye than mine, "

1119
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:15,607
I love you.

1120
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:24,281
"On the next page, I've divided up all
the important items that can't be shared.

1121
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:27,544
"I trust you to share the rest equally.

1122
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:36,728
"Much love.

1123
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:39,266
"I'll always be with you.

1124
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,562
"Mom."

1125
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:53,213
All those days
when you lay here unconscious,

1126
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:58,043
I felt like when I was talking to you,

1127
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:03,287
it was like you were really there.

1128
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:04,858
And now...

1129
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:09,457
Now, I don't feel...

1130
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:15,533
I don't feel...

1131
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:19,901
I don't...

1132
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,087
Goodbye, Mom.

1133
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:20,158
It's normal out, isn't it?

1134
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,097
Yeah.

1135
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:29,275
The most important thing is,
you guys need to stay close,

1136
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:32,005
Your kids need to know each other,

1137
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,846
the way you knew your cousins
when you were growing up,

1138
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:39,353
You guys will stay together, right?
After I'm gone?

1139
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:42,084
It'll be hard,

1140
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:45,216
We'll miss the guilt,

1141
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:50,893
No, that'll ride with you
the rest of your life,

1142
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,450
Hey, what are you doing?

1143
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:17,419
Matthew.

1144
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,921
- Hey, Matthew.
- I've got a headache.

1145
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:24,193
- Well, join the fucking club.
- I don't feel well. I'm going home.

1146
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:25,391
Come on, we've got stuff to do.

1147
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:27,662
Yeah, you mean you've got stuff
you want to order me to do?

1148
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,533
Well, yeah, kind of.

1149
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:31,367
The three of you
treat me like I'm 10 years old.

1150
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,930
You hate my wife,
you don't even give her a chance...

1151
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,499
You know what? I'm fucking sick of it.

1152
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:38,045
Look, come on. We'll make a cup of coffee
and we'll talk about it.

1153
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:40,240
Would you stop trying to control me?

1154
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:43,478
All right?
My mother just died, I don't feel well.

1155
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:46,111
And I'm going home.

1156
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,270
What are we gonna do about it?

1157
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:07,103
You're the oldest.
Order him to get a divorce.

1158
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:10,570
Nah, probably wouldn't work.

1159
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:14,513
Well, Dad's Uncle Stanley
didn't talk to his brother for 48 years.

1160
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:17,050
Really? How'd they patch it up?

1161
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:18,483
Well, they didn't.

1162
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:21,920
Stanley got run over by a bus
when he was 90.

1163
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:24,254
Very uplifting. Thank you, Em.

1164
01:24:27,929 --> 01:24:31,126
I'll see your Percodan,
and I'll raise you one Dilaudid.

1165
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:40,734
Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener

1166
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:44,835
That is what I'd truly like to be

1167
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:18,205
Hi, I'm meeting my mother,
and I didn't see her come off the plane.

1168
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:20,941
- Sir, this is the luggage office.
- Right.

1169
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:24,576
She's about this big,
coming in on the 2:45 from Charlotte.

1170
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:27,849
And she's probably addressed to me,
that's Keith Bergman.

1171
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:26,777
Arnie, thanks for setting this up.

1172
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,042
- Don't mention it.
- Thank you.

1173
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:29,208
No.

1174
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:32,245
Harriet.

1175
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,288
- We feel terrible.
- I know.

1176
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,186
- She was a good woman.
- Yeah.

1177
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:39,019
Excuse us.

1178
01:26:40,228 --> 01:26:43,197
Are you still going to go ahead with,
you know, after?

1179
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:45,494
Well, what would you do, Arnie?

1180
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,432
Spreading her remains would

1181
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:50,767
clearly violate the Orthodox Jewish laws
against cremation.

1182
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:55,874
Of course, your mother always did
pretty much what she wanted.

1183
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:57,241
There is that.

1184
01:26:58,246 --> 01:27:00,180
Look, today's Friday.

1185
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:03,081
Go out after 3:00, 3:30,
nobody will be there.

1186
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,180
Just don't tell anybody.

1187
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:30,140
It's locked.

1188
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,376
I don't know.
Those spikes look pretty sharp.

1189
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:34,574
Yeah, you're right.

1190
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,708
Why don't we just toss the box over
and run?

1191
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:37,910
No, I'm just saying.

1192
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:40,386
Look, can we not take
all fucking day discussing it?

1193
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:42,286
I'm not climbing the fence.

1194
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:44,655
Great. Well, suggest something else.

1195
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,925
There, it's not so bad.

1196
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,368
Give me the box.

1197
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:11,409
Hey, Keith, how did...

1198
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:18,250
Shit.

1199
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:28,834
How did you get there?

1200
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:32,964
I told you I wasn't climbing over.
There's a break in the fence over there.

1201
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:35,172
There's a...

1202
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:45,950
A little help?

1203
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,388
Did you get directions?

1204
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:56,396
I've been here before.
How hard can it be to find?

1205
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,092
It's right next to a tall tree.

1206
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:09,070
- Is this it?
- No, I think it's over there more.

1207
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:13,076
- This is it.
- What?

1208
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:21,621
Yeah, it does look kind of familiar.

1209
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,624
What, with our grandfather's name on it
and all?

1210
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,187
- Give me the box.
- No, I got it.

1211
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,995
- Wait. Keith, give me the box.
- I got it.

1212
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:47,075
- All right, great. Can I have it?
- No.

1213
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:48,342
- Can I have it now?
- No, I got it.

1214
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:51,044
Just give me... Keith. Let go of it.
Give me the...

1215
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,519
- Guys. Guys.
- Give me the box, Keith.

1216
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:08,430
Nice work, men.

1217
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:10,334
At least it's open.

1218
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:15,736
Wait, what's this stuff?

1219
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:20,540
I thought it was all supposed to be ash,
but what's this?

1220
01:30:24,652 --> 01:30:25,744
Bone.

1221
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:27,783
Oh, man.

1222
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:31,319
What do we spread it with?

1223
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:35,854
Well, our hands, I guess.

1224
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:37,691
Really?

1225
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,234
We're already wearing her.

1226
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:41,768
Let's just pour it.

1227
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:48,103
How do we know that that's really her?

1228
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:51,111
I mean,
they could've just given us anyone, right?

1229
01:30:57,852 --> 01:30:59,114
It's that...

1230
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:04,021
It's the port-a-cath,
that thing that the IV went through.

1231
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:07,620
Wow.

1232
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:10,058
It's Mom.

1233
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:16,998
It's Mom.

1234
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,342
What are you doing?

1235
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,009
I'm keeping it.

1236
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:27,775
No, you're not. We're throwing it away.

1237
01:31:27,849 --> 01:31:29,908
Keith, throw it away.

1238
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:31,076
No.

1239
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:35,345
- No. Why? Why?
- Just toss it.

1240
01:31:35,423 --> 01:31:37,186
Why? Why throw it away?

1241
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:39,385
- Keith, throw it away, please.
- No.

1242
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,920
You're not keeping it.

1243
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:49,833
Don't make me throw it away.

1244
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:14,690
It's okay.

1245
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:25,597
Hey.

1246
01:32:27,441 --> 01:32:28,931
It's okay, man.

1247
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:31,504
We're here.

1248
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:36,307
We're all here.
