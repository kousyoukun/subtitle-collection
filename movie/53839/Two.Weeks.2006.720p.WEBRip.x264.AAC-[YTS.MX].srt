1383
01:26:45,374 --> 01:26:47,550
Spreading her remains would

1384
01:26:47,593 --> 01:26:50,422
clearly violate
the Orthodox Jewish laws
against cremation.

1385
01:26:52,555 --> 01:26:55,601
Of course, your mother
always did pretty much
what she wanted.

1386
01:26:55,645 --> 01:26:57,037
There is that.

1387
01:26:58,038 --> 01:27:00,258
Look, today's Friday.

1388
01:27:00,302 --> 01:27:02,826
Go out after 3:00, 3:30,
nobody will be there.

1389
01:27:04,306 --> 01:27:05,916
Just don't tell anybody.

1390
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,896
It's locked.

1391
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:33,248
Ooh, I don't know.
Those spikes look
pretty sharp.

1392
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:34,553
Yeah, you're right.

1393
01:27:34,597 --> 01:27:36,642
Why don't we just
toss the box over and run?

1394
01:27:36,686 --> 01:27:38,209
No, I'm just saying.

1395
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:40,255
Look, can we not take
all fucking day
discussing it?

1396
01:27:40,298 --> 01:27:42,126
I'm not climbing
the fence.

1397
01:27:42,169 --> 01:27:44,259
Great. Well,
suggest something else.

1399
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,571
There, it's not so bad.

1400
01:27:54,704 --> 01:27:56,140
Give me the box.

1401
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:10,937
Hey, Keith, how did...

[GRUNTING SOFTLY]

1403
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:17,988
Shit.

[PANTS TEARING]Oh...

1405
01:28:27,214 --> 01:28:28,781
How did you get there?

1406
01:28:28,825 --> 01:28:30,348
I told you
I wasn't climbing over.

1407
01:28:30,392 --> 01:28:32,611
There's a break
in the fence over there.

1408
01:28:33,525 --> 01:28:34,918
There's a...

1410
01:28:44,406 --> 01:28:45,581
A little help?

EMILY:
Did you get directions?

1412
01:28:53,284 --> 01:28:56,200
I've been here before.
How hard can it be to find?

1413
01:28:57,897 --> 01:28:59,769
It's right next to
a tall tree.

1414
01:29:05,557 --> 01:29:07,211
Is this it?

1415
01:29:07,254 --> 01:29:09,039
No, I think
it's over there more.

1416
01:29:10,606 --> 01:29:11,737
This is it.

1417
01:29:11,781 --> 01:29:13,130
KEITH: What?

1418
01:29:16,002 --> 01:29:17,003
Huh.

1419
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:21,443
Yeah, it does look
kind of familiar.

1420
01:29:21,486 --> 01:29:24,184
What, with our
grandfather's name
on it and all?

1421
01:29:26,012 --> 01:29:27,884
Give me the box.No, I got it.

1422
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,630
Wait. Keith, give me the box.I got it.

All right, great.
Can I have it?No.

Can I have it now?No, I got it.

Just give me... Keith.

Nice work, men.

1429

At least it's open.

Wait, what's this stuff?

1431
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:20,066
I thought it was all
supposed to be ash,
but what's this?

1432
01:30:24,506 --> 01:30:25,332
Bone.

1433

Oh, man.

1434
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:31,077
What do we spread it with?

Really?

1438
01:30:37,954 --> 01:30:39,999
We're already wearing her.

1439

Let's just pour it.

1440
01:30:46,353 --> 01:30:48,094
How do we know
that that's really her?

given us anyone, right?

Wow, it's the portacath,
that thing that
the IV went through.

Wow.
