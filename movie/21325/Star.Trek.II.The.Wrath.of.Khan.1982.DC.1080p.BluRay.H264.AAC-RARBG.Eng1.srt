00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,465

12
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:42,512
MAN: Imperative! This is the Kobayashi

Mr. Sulu? Plot an intercept course.

27
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,931
May I remind the Captain
that if a starship enters the Zone...

28
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,850
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.

Maintenance crew,
report to Bridge Simulator.

68
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:46,071
- "Physician, heal thyself."
- Is that all you've got to say?

69
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,449
- What about my performance?
- I'm not a drama critic.

70
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,870
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you gonna stay
with the sinking ship?

71
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,416
- Permission to speak candidly, sir?
- Granted.

72
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,419
SAAVIK: I don't believe this was
a fair test of my command abilities.

73
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,588
- And why not?
- Because there was no way to win.

74
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,509
A no-win situation is a possibility
every commander may face.

75
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,012
- Has that never occurred to you?
- No, sir. It has not.

76
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,767
How we deal with death is at least
as important as how we deal with life,

77
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,519
wouldn't you say?

78
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,106
As I indicated, Admiral,
that thought had not occurred to me.

79
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,442
Well, now you have something new
to think about. Carry on.

80
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,278
WOMAN ON PA: Engineering cadets,
assemble on C-Level.

McCOY: Admiral.

82
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,534
Wouldn't it be easier to just put
an experienced crew back on the ship?

83
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,330
Galloping around the cosmos
is a game for the young, Doctor.

84
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,666
Now, what is that supposed to mean?

85
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,216
Aren't you dead?

86
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,637
I assume you're loitering around here

87
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,307
to learn what efficiency rating
I plan to give your cadets?

88
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,559
I am understandably curious.

89
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,396
They destroyed the Simulator Room
and you with it.

90
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,441
The Kobayashi Maru scenario
frequently wreaks havoc

91

92
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,155
As I recall,
you took the test three times yourself.

93
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,700
Your final solution was,
shall we say, unique.

94
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,911
It had the virtue
of never having been tried.

95
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,248
By the way, thank you for this.

96
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,210

- None that I'm conscious of.

99
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,306
Except, of course, happy birthday.
Surely the best of times.

- The Enterprise.

103
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,484
I must check in before your inspection.
And you?

104
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,862

00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,969
Beware Romulans bearing gifts.

00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,057
- Happy birthday, Jim.
- Thanks.

00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,106
Romulan ale.
Why, Bones, you know this is illegal.

111
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,692
I only use it for medicinal purposes.

112
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,194
I got a border ship that brings me in
a case every now and then

113
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,946
across the Neutral Zone.

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,615
- Now, don't be a prig.
- 2283.

115
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,952
Yeah, well,
it takes this stuff a while to ferment.

116
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,706
Here, give me. Now, you open this one.

117
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,876
I'm almost afraid to. What is it?

118
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,504
Klingon aphrodisiacs?

119
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,299
No. More antiques for your collection.

120
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:58,346
Bones, this is charming.

121
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,681
They're 400 years old.

122
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,518
And you don't find many
with the lenses still intact.

123
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:06,896
- What is it?
- They're for your eyes.

124
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:11,484
For most patients your age,
I generally recommend Retinax V.

125
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:14,904
- I'm allergic to Retinax.
- Exactly. Cheers.

126
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,572

Why are we treating yours
like a funeral?

- Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
- What the hell do you want?

00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,489
This is not about age and you know it.

136
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,700
It's about you flying
a goddamn computer console

- Who am I hiding from?
- From yourself, Admiral.

Don't mince words, Bones.
What do you really think?

00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:18,193
in connection with Project Genesis.

151
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,779
We are continuing our search
for a lifeless planet

152
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:23,031
to satisfy the requirement of a test site

153
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:26,660
for the Genesis experiment.
So far, no success.

154
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,537
Standard orbit, please.

155
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:31,582
Mr. Beach, any change
in the surface scan?

156
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:36,962
Negative. Limited atmosphere
dominated by craylon gas, sand,

157
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:40,549
high-velocity winds.
Incapable of supporting life forms.

158
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:44,761
Does it have to be completely lifeless?

159
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,972
Don't tell me you found something.

160
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:51,518
We've picked up a minor energy flux
reading on one dynoscanner.

161
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:55,230
Damn. Are you sure?
Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment.

162
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,612
I suppose it could be a particle of
preanimate matter caught in the matrix.

163
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:06,158
All right.
Get on the comm-pic to Dr. Marcus.

164
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:07,284
Aye, sir.

165
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:11,121
Maybe it's something we can transplant.

166
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,290

170
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:24,676

342
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:33,102
Aye, sir.

343
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:36,230
But, Admiral, how about
the rest of the inspection?

344
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:38,107
(MOUTHING)

345
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:52,621
MAN ON RADIO:
This is Starfleet Operations.

346
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:54,539
Enterprise is clear for departure.

347
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:56,500
Admiral on the Bridge.

348
00:29:57,335 --> 00:29:59,419
WOMAN ON RADIO:
Pre-stage flux chillers, port.

349
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:00,504
MAN ON RADIO: On.

350
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:02,297
WOMAN:
Pre-stage flux chillers, starboard.

351
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:03,382
MAN: On.

352
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:05,342
WOMAN: Main stage flux chillers, port.

353
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:06,468
MAN: Enabled.
SAAVIK: Running lights on.

354
00:30:06,552 --> 00:30:08,303
WOMAN:
Main stage flux chillers, starboard.

355
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:09,513
MAN: Enabled.

356
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,768
Very well, Mr. Saavik.
You may clear all moorings.

357
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:16,144
SAAVIK: Aye, sir.

358
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:21,775
- All moorings are clear, Captain.
- Thank you.

359
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:26,697
Lieutenant?

360
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:31,451
Have you ever piloted a starship
out of space dock?

361
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:32,911
Never, sir.

362
00:30:43,256 --> 00:30:45,215
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

363
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,052
Aye, sir.

364
00:30:56,936 --> 00:31:00,230
For everything,
there is a first time, Lieutenant.

365
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:01,815
Don't you agree, Admiral?

366
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:02,941
KIRK: Mmm-hmm.

367
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:05,736
- Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
- SULU: Aft thrusters.

368
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:09,364
Would you like a tranquillizer?

369
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:11,658
SAAVIK:
Ahead one-quarter impulse power.

370
00:31:11,743 --> 00:31:13,744
Ahead one-quarter impulse power.

371
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,358
We are free and clear to navigate.

372
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:28,109
Course heading, Captain?

373
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:35,867
- Captain's discretion.
- Mr. Sulu, you may indulge yourself.

374
00:32:37,745 --> 00:32:38,995
Aye, sir.

375
00:33:05,231 --> 00:33:06,690
Does that about do it?

376
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:08,316
I don't think
there's another piece of information

377
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:11,027
we could squeeze
into the memory banks.

378
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:14,573
- Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
- Who'd wanna build it?

379
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:18,326
Dr. Marcus? Comm-pic coming in
on hyperchannel.

380
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,747
- It's the Starship Reliant.
- On the screen, please, Jedda.

381
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:27,210
Come in, please.
This is the Reliant calling Regula I.

382
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:31,631
Repeat, this is U.S.S. Reliant.

383
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:36,261
CAROL: Commander, we are receiving.
This is Regula I. Go ahead.

384
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:42,183
Dr. Marcus. Good. We're en route to
you and should be there in three days.

385
00:33:42,894 --> 00:33:46,897
En route? Why? We weren't expecting
you for another three months.

386
00:33:47,565 --> 00:33:50,150
- Has something happened?
- Nothing has happened.

387
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:52,444
Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

388
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,198
- Then I don't understand why you...
- We have received new orders.

389
00:33:57,283 --> 00:33:59,492
Upon our arrival at Regula I,

390
00:33:59,744 --> 00:34:03,747
all materials of Project Genesis
will be transferred to this ship

391
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:06,207
for immediate testing on Ceti Alpha VI.

392
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:08,835
- Who in the hell do they think they are?
- Please be quiet.

393
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,963
Commander Chekov,
this is completely irregular.

394
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:14,257
Who gave the order?

395
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:18,219
The order comes
from Starfleet Command, Dr. Marcus,

396
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:20,055
direct from the general staff.

397
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,140
- It's a civilian...
- (SHUSHING)

398
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:25,018
Genesis is a civilian project
under my control.

399
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:29,397
- I have my orders.
- Pin him down, Mother.

400
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:31,816
Who gave the order?

401
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:34,486
The order comes from

402
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,240
Admiral James T. Kirk.

403
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:40,992
I knew it! I knew it!

404
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,577
All along, the military's wanted to get...

405
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:45,329
This is completely improper,
Commander Chekov.

406
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:49,667
I have no intention of allowing Reliant
or any other unauthorized personnel

407
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:52,086
access to our work or materials.

408
00:34:52,546 --> 00:34:57,258
I'm sorry that you feel that way, Doctor.
Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.

409
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,763
Please prepare to deliver Genesis
to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

410
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:08,144
Well done, Commander.

411
00:35:10,397 --> 00:35:14,066
You realize, sir, they will attempt
to contact Admiral Kirk

412
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:16,027
and confirm the order.

413
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:30,333
SAAVIK: Hold, please.

414
00:35:33,462 --> 00:35:35,004
Thank you, sir.

415
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:40,968
Lieutenant, are you wearing
your hair differently?

416
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:43,346
It's still regulation, Admiral.

417
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:47,642
May I speak, sir?

418
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:53,481
Self-expression doesn't seem
to be one of your problems.

419
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:00,988
You're bothered by your performance
on the Kobayashi Maru.

420
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:02,698
I failed to resolve the situation.

421
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:05,701
There's no correct resolution.
It's a test of character.

422
00:36:06,662 --> 00:36:09,288
May I ask how you dealt with the test?

423
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,417
You may ask.

424
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:18,089
That's a little joke.

425
00:36:18,674 --> 00:36:21,300
Humor. It is a difficult concept.

426
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,887
It is not logical.

427
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:27,932
We learn by doing.

428
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:30,267
Who's been holding up
the damn elevator?

429
00:36:30,352 --> 00:36:31,852
Thank you, sir.

430
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,065
- Did she change her hairstyle?
- I hadn't noticed.

431
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:39,193
Wonderful stuff, that Romulan ale.

432
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:41,612
UHURA ON INTERCOM: Admiral Kirk?

433
00:36:41,697 --> 00:36:42,780
Kirk here.

434
00:36:42,864 --> 00:36:46,075
I have an urgent comm-pic from
Space Lab Regula I for you, sir.

435
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,743
Dr. Carol Marcus.

436
00:36:51,581 --> 00:36:53,708
- I'll take it in my quarters, Uhura.
- UHURA: Aye, sir.

437
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,918
It never rains, but it pours.

438
00:36:57,421 --> 00:36:59,255
As a physician,
you of all people should appreciate

439
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,757
the dangers of re-opening old wounds.

440
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:06,679
Sorry.

441
00:37:06,763 --> 00:37:07,805
CAROL: Jim, can you read me?

442
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:11,350
I can hear you, Carol. What's wrong?
What's the matter?

443
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:14,895
Why are you taking Genesis
away from us?

444
00:37:15,814 --> 00:37:18,024
Taking Genesis?
Who's taking Genesis?

445
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:19,900
Who is taking Genesis?

446
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:22,820
- I can see you, but I can't hear.
- Carol...

447
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,406
Jim, did you give the order?

448
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,784
What order? Who's taking Genesis?

449
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:29,994
Please help us, Jim.

450
00:37:30,078 --> 00:37:32,997
I will not let them have Genesis
without proper authorization!

451
00:37:33,081 --> 00:37:36,876
- Have Genesis? Who's taking...
- On whose authority can they do this?

452
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,004
- No one's authority!
- (DISTORTED) Jim, please...

453
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:41,088
Uhura, what's happening?

454
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:43,883
UHURA:
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.

455
00:37:46,803 --> 00:37:49,555
- Alert Starfleet Headquarters.
- UHURA: Aye, sir.

456
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,349
I want to talk to Starfleet Command.

457
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:55,269
CAROL: Quiet.
We must have order in here.

458
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:56,854
This has to be some sort of mistake.

459
00:37:56,938 --> 00:38:00,190
DAVID: Mistake! We're all alone here.

460
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:03,360
They waited until everyone was on leave
to do this.

461
00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:06,405
Reliant is supposed to be
at our disposal, not vice-versa.

462
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:07,614
It seems clear Starfleet never intended...

463
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:09,825
CAROL: I know that,
but I can't believe the Starfleet...

464
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:11,243
DAVID: I've tried warning you before.

465
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:13,495
Scientists have always been pawns
of the military.

466
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,247
Starfleet has kept the peace
for 100 years.

467
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:19,334
I cannot and will not subscribe
to your interpretation of this event.

468
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:22,754
You may be right, Doctor.
But what about Reliant?

469
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:25,716
She's on her way.

470
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:30,637
Now, get your gear together
where it's handy.

471
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:31,972
And where are we going?

472
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:34,683
That's for us to know,
and Reliant to find out.

473
00:38:45,861 --> 00:38:47,529
KIRK: We have a problem.

474
00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:50,991
Something may be wrong on Regula I.
We've been ordered to investigate.

475
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:56,788
If memory serves, Regula I
is a scientific research laboratory.

476
00:38:57,373 --> 00:39:01,292
I told Starfleet Command
all we had was a boatload of children,

477
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,380
but we're the only ship in the quadrant.

478
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:10,468
Spock, these cadets of yours,
how good are they?

479
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:12,637
How will they respond
under real pressure?

480
00:39:12,722 --> 00:39:16,224
As with all living things,
each according to his gifts.

481
00:39:17,393 --> 00:39:19,644
Of course, this ship is yours.

482
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:23,106
No, that won't be necessary.

483
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:26,317
Just get me to Regula I.

484
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:30,905
As a teacher on a training mission,
I'm content to command the Enterprise.

485
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:33,158
If we are to go on actual duty,

486
00:39:33,242 --> 00:39:37,203
it is clear that the senior officer
onboard must assume command.

487
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:38,997
It may be nothing.

488
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:42,167
Garbled communications.

489
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,920
- You take the ship.
- Jim.

490
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:48,548
You proceed from a false assumption.

491
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:52,177
I'm a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

492
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,017
KIRK: You're about to remind me
that logic alone dictates your actions?

493
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:02,562
I would not remind you
of that which you know so well.

494
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:07,650
If I may be so bold, it was a mistake
for you to accept promotion.

495
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:12,155
Commanding a starship is your first,
best destiny.

496
00:40:12,656 --> 00:40:15,617
Anything else is a waste of material.

497
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:18,328
I would not presume to debate you.

498
00:40:19,455 --> 00:40:20,955
That is wise.

499
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:24,334
In any case, were I to invoke logic,

500
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,461
logic clearly dictates

501
00:40:26,545 --> 00:40:30,131
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

502
00:40:31,675 --> 00:40:33,051
Or the one.

503
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:42,644
You are my superior officer.
You are also my friend.

504
00:40:43,854 --> 00:40:46,481
I have been and always shall be yours.

505
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,070
- Stop energizers.
- SULU: Stop energizers.

506
00:40:52,154 --> 00:40:53,905
Put me on speakers.

507
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:59,369
An emergency situation has arisen.

508
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,747
By order of Starfleet Command,
as of now, 1800 hours,

509
00:41:02,832 --> 00:41:04,916
I'm assuming command of this vessel.

510
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,918
Duty officer, so note in the ship's log.

511
00:41:07,002 --> 00:41:09,629
Plot a new course
for Space Laboratory Regula I.

512
00:41:09,713 --> 00:41:11,131
Engine Room.

513
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:13,299
- Mr. Scott.
- SCOTTY ON INTERCOM: Aye, sir?

514
00:41:13,801 --> 00:41:16,511
- We'll be going to warp speed.
- Aye, sir.

515
00:41:17,346 --> 00:41:21,057
- Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral.
- KIRK: Engage warp engines.

516
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,811
- Prepare for warp speed.
- Ready, sir.

517
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,651
I know that none of you
were expecting this. I'm sorry.

518
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:35,864
I'm going to have to ask you to grow up
a little bit sooner than you expected.

519
00:41:35,948 --> 00:41:37,407
Warp 5, Sulu.

520
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:42,162
So much for the little training cruise.

521
00:41:51,046 --> 00:41:53,464
WOMAN: Course to intercept Enterprise
ready, sir.

522
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:54,716
KHAN: Excellent.

523
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,719
- Helmsman?
- Sir, may I speak?

524
00:42:03,475 --> 00:42:05,435
We're all with you, sir.

525
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,438
But consider this.

526
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:13,568
We are free. We have a ship
and the means to go where we will.

527
00:42:15,237 --> 00:42:18,364
We have escaped
permanent exile on Ceti Alpha V.

528
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:25,455
You have proved your superior intellect
and defeated the plans of Admiral Kirk.

529
00:42:27,374 --> 00:42:29,918
You do not need to defeat him again.

530
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:35,798
He tasks me.
He tasks me and I shall have him.

531
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,054
I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia

532
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:44,140
and round the Antares maelstrom

533
00:42:44,225 --> 00:42:48,228
and round perdition's flames
before I give him up.

534
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:53,441
Prepare to alter course.

535
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:57,779
UHURA:
Space Station Regula I, please come in.

536
00:42:58,113 --> 00:43:00,114
Dr. Marcus, please respond.

537
00:43:02,701 --> 00:43:04,744
This is Enterprise...

538
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:08,665
It's no use.
There's no response from Regula I.

539
00:43:08,749 --> 00:43:11,626
- But no longer jammed?
- No, sir. No nothing.

540
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,261
There are two possibilities.

541
00:43:21,345 --> 00:43:24,931
They are unable to respond.
They are unwilling to respond.

542
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:28,351
- How far?
- 12 hours, 43 minutes, present speed.

543
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,815
"Give up Genesis," she said.

544
00:43:34,566 --> 00:43:36,901
What in God's name does it mean?
Give it up to whom?

545
00:43:36,986 --> 00:43:40,655
It might help my analysis
if I knew what Genesis was,

546
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:42,699
beyond the biblical reference.

547
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:45,576
Uhura, have Dr. McCoy
join us in my quarters.

548
00:43:45,661 --> 00:43:47,453
UHURA: Aye, sir.
KIRK: Mr. Saavik?

549
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,206
You have the conn.

550
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:56,129
Well, I've got Sickbay ready.

551
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:58,965
Now, will someone please tell me
what's going on?

552
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:03,970
Computer. Request security procedure

553
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:07,098
and access to Project Genesis
summary.

554
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:10,101
COMPUTER VOICE:
Identify for retina scan.

555
00:44:10,185 --> 00:44:12,562
Kirk, Admiral James T.

556
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:24,198
- Security Scan approved.
- Summary, please?

557
00:44:28,662 --> 00:44:32,248
Project Genesis.
A proposal to the Federation.

558
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:35,376
- Carol Marcus.
- Yes.

559
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:37,712
What exactly is Genesis?

560
00:44:38,964 --> 00:44:43,259
Well, put simply,
Genesis is life from lifelessness.

561
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,431
It is a process whereby
molecular structure is reorganized

562
00:44:48,515 --> 00:44:53,353
at the subatomic level into
life-generating matter of equal mass.

563
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:57,148
Stage one of our experiments
was conducted in the laboratory.

564
00:44:57,232 --> 00:45:01,486
Stage two of the series will be
attempted in a lifeless underground.

565
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:05,239
Stage three will involve
the process on a planetary scale.

566
00:45:05,908 --> 00:45:08,993
It is our intention to introduce
the Genesis device

567
00:45:09,078 --> 00:45:12,330
into a preselected area
of a lifeless space body,

568
00:45:12,414 --> 00:45:14,248
a moon or other dead form.

569
00:45:15,209 --> 00:45:16,584
The device is delivered,

570
00:45:16,668 --> 00:45:20,254
instantaneously causing
what we call the Genesis Effect.

571
00:45:21,256 --> 00:45:24,550
Matter is reorganized
with life-generating results.

572
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:43,736
Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet

573
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:47,865
capable of sustaining whatever
life forms we see fit to deposit on it.

574
00:45:49,118 --> 00:45:50,243
Fascinating.

575
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:52,286
The reformed moon simulated here

576
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:55,498
represents the merest fraction
of the Genesis' potential,

577
00:45:55,582 --> 00:45:58,000
should the Federation
wish to fund these experiments

578
00:45:58,085 --> 00:46:00,211
to their logical conclusion.

579
00:46:00,796 --> 00:46:05,258
When we consider the cosmic problems
of population and food supply,

580
00:46:05,342 --> 00:46:08,302
the usefulness of this process
becomes clear.

581
00:46:08,637 --> 00:46:11,806
This concludes our proposal.
Thank you for your attention.

582
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:14,642
It literally is genesis.

583
00:46:16,478 --> 00:46:18,146
Power of creation.

584
00:46:20,774 --> 00:46:22,692
Have they proceeded
with their experiments?

585
00:46:22,776 --> 00:46:24,068
KIRK: Well, the tape was made
about a year ago,

586
00:46:24,153 --> 00:46:27,613
so I can only assume
they've reached stage two by now.

587
00:46:28,115 --> 00:46:31,534
Dear Lord, do you think
we're intelligent enough to...

588
00:46:32,453 --> 00:46:36,998
Suppose... What if this thing
were used where life already exists?

589
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:41,502
It would destroy such life
in favor of its new matrix.

590
00:46:42,171 --> 00:46:46,549
Its new matrix? Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

591
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:51,304
I was not attempting to evaluate
its moral implications, Doctor.

592
00:46:51,513 --> 00:46:53,264
As a matter of cosmic history,

593
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:56,601
it has always been easier to destroy
than to create.

594
00:46:56,685 --> 00:46:59,854
Not anymore!
Now we can do both at the same time.

595
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:03,232
According to myth,
the Earth was created in six days.

596
00:47:03,317 --> 00:47:07,570
Now, watch out. Here comes Genesis.
We'll do it for you in six minutes.

597
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,322
I do not dispute,
that in the wrong hands...

598
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:12,157
"In the wrong hands?"

599
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:16,912
Would you mind telling me whose are
the right hands, my logical friend?

600
00:47:19,624 --> 00:47:22,793
Are you, by any chance,
in favor of these experiments?

601
00:47:22,877 --> 00:47:24,002
Gentlemen, gentlemen, this isn't...

602
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:27,673
Really, Dr. McCoy,
you must learn to govern your passions.

603
00:47:28,424 --> 00:47:31,885
They will be your undoing.
Logic suggests...

604
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:35,430
Logic?
My God, the man's talking about logic.

605
00:47:35,974 --> 00:47:38,725
We're talking about
universal Armageddon.

Admiral, sensors indicate
a vessel in our area, closing fast.

608
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:51,071
- What do you make of her?
- It's one of ours, Admiral. It's Reliant.

609
00:47:51,155 --> 00:47:52,405
SPOCK: Reliant?

610
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,994
Try the emergency channels.

611
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:04,417

Aye, sir.

It would explain a great many things.

621
00:48:55,094 --> 00:48:57,721
They're requesting communications, sir.

622
00:48:58,181 --> 00:48:59,598

They're still running with shields down.

"Revenge is a dish

- Raise ours.

I'll agree to your terms if,
in addition to yourself,

681
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:50,263
you hand over to me
all data and material

- Don't insult my intelligence, Kirk.

Give me some time to recall
the data on our computers.

he doesn't have Genesis.

- It's coming through now, Khan.

702
00:55:13,264 --> 00:55:18,601
- Reliant's prefix number is 16309.
- I don't understand.

703
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:21,729
You have to learn
why things work on a starship.

704

from doing what we're attempting.

We're using our console

Assuming he hasn't changed
the combination. He's quite intelligent.

Khan, how do we know
you'll keep your word?

I've given you no word to keep, Admiral.

711

In my judgment,
you simply have no alternative.

712

- SPOCK: Spock here.

848
01:07:06,892 --> 01:07:09,018
Captain Spock, damage report.

849
01:07:09,103 --> 01:07:13,148
Admiral, if we go by the book,
like Lieutenant Saavik,

850
01:07:14,024 --> 01:07:16,109
hours could seem like days.

851
01:07:16,861 --> 01:07:20,363
- I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
- The situation is grave, Admiral.

852
01:07:20,448 --> 01:07:25,535
We won't have main power for six days.
Auxiliary power has temporarily failed.

853
01:07:25,995 --> 01:07:31,708
Restoration may be possible
in two days, by the book, Admiral.

854
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:35,253
- Meaning you can't even beam us back?
- Not at present.

855
01:07:38,174 --> 01:07:41,759
Captain Spock. If you don't hear
from us within one hour,

856
01:07:42,428 --> 01:07:45,013
your orders are to restore
what power you can,

857
01:07:45,097 --> 01:07:47,724
take the Enterprise
to the nearest starbase

858
01:07:47,808 --> 01:07:50,435
and alert Starfleet Command
as soon as you're out of jamming range.

859
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:52,812
UHURA: Sir, we won't leave you behind.

860
01:07:52,938 --> 01:07:57,442
Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.

861
01:07:58,611 --> 01:08:01,321
Well, gentlemen,
you can stay here, or...

862
01:08:01,655 --> 01:08:04,782
If it's all the same, Admiral,
we'd like to share the risk.

863
01:08:06,577 --> 01:08:08,870
Right. Let's go. Saavik?

864
01:08:10,831 --> 01:08:13,958
- Go? Where are we going?
- Where they went.

865
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,463
Suppose they went nowhere?

866
01:08:18,797 --> 01:08:22,425
Then this will be your big chance
to get away from it all.

867
01:08:51,622 --> 01:08:52,830
Admiral.

Mother, he killed everybody
we left behind.

875
01:09:53,017 --> 01:09:54,767
Of course he didn't.

876
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:57,979
David, you're just making this harder.

877
01:09:58,063 --> 01:10:01,357
I'm afraid it's even harder
than you think, Doctor.

have you been listening?

881
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:19,917
I have indeed, Captain.

Still, old friend, you've managed
to kill just about everyone else,

- The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

if we're playing out that scenario now?

will you tell me what you did?

I would really like to know.

Lieutenant, you are looking
at the only Starfleet cadet

991
01:19:40,812 --> 01:19:43,272
who ever beat the no-win scenario.

992
01:19:44,107 --> 01:19:45,149
How?

993
01:19:46,151 --> 01:19:50,237
I reprogrammed the simulation
so it was possible to rescue the ship.

994
01:19:50,322 --> 01:19:52,740
- What?
- He cheated.

995
01:19:52,824 --> 01:19:55,409
I changed the conditions of the test.

996
01:19:55,619 --> 01:19:58,495

I don't like to lose.

998
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:04,960
Then you never faced that situation,
faced death?

999
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:07,796
I don't believe in the no-win scenario.

1002
01:20:14,387 --> 01:20:16,931
Just give us your coordinates
and we'll beam you aboard.

01:20:17,015 --> 01:20:18,349
All right.

- SPOCK: Why, of course.

- SAAVIK: By the book?
- By the book.

are being monitored during battle...

on an open channel."

1013
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:51,673

- I exaggerated.

Hours instead of days.
Now we have minutes instead of hours.

1015
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:03,393
- They're inoperative below C-Deck.
- What is working around here?

1016
01:21:03,478 --> 01:21:05,521
Not much, Admiral.

I don't mean to intrude.

1188
01:45:44,081 --> 01:45:47,583
No, not at all. I should be on the Bridge.

1189
01:45:49,711 --> 01:45:52,046
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1190
01:45:52,297 --> 01:45:53,965
I poured myself a drink.
Would you like it?

1191
01:45:54,049 --> 01:45:56,175
Lieutenant Saavik was right.

1192
01:45:58,387 --> 01:46:00,555
You never have faced death.

1193
01:46:09,815 --> 01:46:11,482
No, not like this.

1194
01:46:14,403 --> 01:46:17,530
I haven't faced death.
I've cheated death.

1195
01:46:21,285 --> 01:46:23,619
I've tricked my way out of death

1196
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:27,123
and patted myself on the back
for my ingenuity.

1197
01:46:31,253 --> 01:46:32,378
I know nothing.

1198
01:46:32,463 --> 01:46:35,006
You knew enough to tell Saavik
that how we face death

1199
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:37,717
is at least as important
as how we face life.

1200
01:46:40,137 --> 01:46:42,597
- Just words.
- But good words.

1201
01:46:44,558 --> 01:46:48,519
That's where ideas begin.
Maybe you should listen to them.

1202
01:46:52,024 --> 01:46:56,277
I was wrong about you and I'm sorry.

1203
01:47:00,491 --> 01:47:04,410
- Is that what you came here to say?
- Mainly.

1204
01:47:11,710 --> 01:47:15,671
And also that I'm proud,

1205
01:47:18,091 --> 01:47:21,469
very proud to be your son.

1206
01:47:51,333 --> 01:47:54,669
KIRK: Captain's Log, Stardate 8141.6.

1207
01:47:55,212 --> 01:47:57,713
Starship Enterprise
departing for Ceti Alpha V

1208
01:47:57,798 --> 01:48:00,383
to pick up the crew of U.S.S. Reliant.

1209
01:48:01,552 --> 01:48:02,969
All is well.

1210
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,682
And yet, I can't help wondering
about the friend I leave behind.

1211
01:48:09,351 --> 01:48:12,270
"There are always possibilities,"
Spock said.

1212
01:48:12,938 --> 01:48:16,691
And if Genesis is indeed life from death,

1213
01:48:18,485 --> 01:48:20,903
I must return to this place again.

1214
01:48:25,701 --> 01:48:30,538
He's really not dead,
as long as we remember him.

1215
01:48:37,129 --> 01:48:41,090
"It's a far, far better thing I do
than I have ever done before.

1216
01:48:44,094 --> 01:48:48,889
"A far better resting place I go to

1217
01:48:49,766 --> 01:48:51,100
"than I have ever known."

1218
01:48:51,852 --> 01:48:53,394
Is that a poem?

1219
01:48:55,897 --> 01:48:59,233
Something Spock was trying
to tell me on my birthday.

1220
01:49:00,235 --> 01:49:03,529
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

1221
01:49:07,075 --> 01:49:08,242
Young.

1222
01:49:10,412 --> 01:49:11,871
(INHALES)

1223
01:49:12,497 --> 01:49:13,956
I feel young.

1224
01:50:26,863 --> 01:50:29,740
SPOCK: Space, the final frontier.

1225
01:50:30,909 --> 01:50:36,497
These are the continuing voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

1226
01:50:37,999 --> 01:50:43,254
Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,

1227
01:50:44,548 --> 01:50:49,218
to seek out new life forms
and new civilizations,

1228
01:50:50,387 --> 01:50:56,183
to boldly go
where no man has gone before.
