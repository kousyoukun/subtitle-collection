00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,018
Captain's Log, Stardate 8130.3.

2
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,688
Starship Enterprise on training mission
to Gamma Hydra,

3
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:15,110
Section 14, coordinates 22-87-4.

4
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,780
Approaching Neutral Zone.
All systems normal

5
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:23,452
- and functioning.
- Leaving Section 14 for Section 15.

6
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,373
Stand by. Project parabolic course
to avoid entering Neutral Zone.

7
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,958
Aye, Captain.

8
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,754
Course change projected.

9
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,465
Captain, I'm getting something
on the distress channel.

10
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,758
On speakers.

11
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:42,512
Imperative! This is the Kobayashi Maru,
19 periods out of Altair VI.

12
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,016
We have struck a gravitic mine
and have lost all power.

13
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,644
Our hull is penetrated and we have
sustained many casualties...

14
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,231
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Your message is breaking up.

15
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,484
Can you give us your coordinates?
Repeat, this is the Starship...

16
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,862
Enterprise, our position
is Gamma Hydra, Section 10.

17
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,323
In the Neutral Zone.

18
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,034
Hull penetrated,
life support systems failing.

19
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,911
Can you assist us, Enterprise?

20
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,205
- Can you assist us?
- Data on Kobayashi Maru.

21
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,916
Subject vessel is
third class neutronic fuel carrier,

22
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,710
crew of 81, 300 passengers.

23
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,630
Damn.

24
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,176
Mr. Sulu? Plot an intercept course.

25
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,931
May I remind the Captain
that if a starship enters the Zone...

26
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,850
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.

27
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,733
Estimating two minutes to intercept.

28
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,572
Now entering the Neutral Zone.

29
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,741
Warning.
We have entered Neutral Zone.

30
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,619
We are now
in violation of treaty, Captain.

31
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,956
Stand by, Transporter Room,
ready to beam survivors aboard.

32
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,375
Captain! I've lost their signal.

33
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:58,630
Alert. Sensors indicate three
Klingon cruisers, bearing 3-1-6 mark 4.

34
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,549
- Closing fast.
- Visual.

35
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,845
Battle stations. Activate shields.

36
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,055
Shields activated.

37
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,974
Inform the Klingons
we are on a rescue mission.

38
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,809
They're jamming
all the frequencies, Captain.

39
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,562
Klingons on attack course and closing.

40
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,231
We're over our heads.
Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.

41
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,983
I'll try, Captain.

42
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,028
Alert. Klingon torpedoes activated.

43
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,030
- Alert.
- Evasive action!

44
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,163
- Engineering, damage report.
- Main energizer hit, Captain.

45
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,333
Engage auxiliary power.
Prepare to return fire.

46
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,629
Shields collapsing, Captain.

47
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,762
- Fire all phasers.
- No power to the weapons, Captain.

48
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,394
Captain, it's no use.
We're dead in space.

49
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,192
Activate escape pods. Send out
the log buoy. All hands abandon ship.

50
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,862
- Repeat, all hands abandon ship.
- All right. Open her up.

51
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,083
- Any suggestions, Admiral?
- Prayer, Mr. Saavik.

52
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,627
The Klingons don't take prisoners.

53
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,088
Lights.

54
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,090
Motors on.

55
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,177
Captain?

56
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,976
Trainees, to the briefing room.

57
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,688
Maintenance crew,
report to Bridge Simulator.

58
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,275
Maintenance crew,
report to Bridge Simulator.

59
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:46,071
- "Physician, heal thyself."
- Is that all you've got to say?

60
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,449
- What about my performance?
- I'm not a drama critic.

61
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,870
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you gonna stay
with the sinking ship?

62
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,416
- Permission to speak candidly, sir?
- Granted.

63
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,419
I don't believe this was a fair test
of my command abilities.

64
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,588
- And why not?
- Because there was no way to win.

65
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,509
A no-win situation is a possibility
every commander may face.

66
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,012
- Has that never occurred to you?
- No, sir. It has not.

67
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,767
How we deal with death is at least
as important as how we deal with life,

68
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,519
wouldn't you say?

69
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,106
As I indicated, Admiral,
that thought had not occurred to me.

70
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,442
Well, now you have something new
to think about. Carry on.

71
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,278
Engineering cadets,
assemble on C-Level.

72
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,780
Admiral.

73
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,534
Wouldn't it be easier to just put
an experienced crew back on the ship?

74
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,330
Galloping around the cosmos
is a game for the young, Doctor.

75
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,666
Now, what is that supposed to mean?

76
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,216
Aren't you dead?

77
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,637
I assume you're loitering around here

78
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,307
to learn what efficiency rating
I plan to give your cadets?

79
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,559
I am understandably curious.

80
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,396
They destroyed the Simulator Room
and you with it.

81
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,441
The Kobayashi Maru scenario
frequently wreaks havoc

82
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,693
with students and equipment.

83
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,155
As I recall,
you took the test three times yourself.

84
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,700
Your final solution was,
shall we say, unique.

85
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,911
It had the virtue
of never having been tried.

86
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,248
By the way, thank you for this.

87
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,210
I know of your fondness for antiques.

88
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,089
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times..."

89
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,885
- Message, Spock?
- None that I'm conscious of.

90
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,306
Except, of course, happy birthday.
Surely the best of times.

91
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,810
Captain Spock, Captain Spock,
space shuttle leaving in 15 minutes.

92
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,105
- Where are you off to now?
- The Enterprise.

93
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,484
I must check in before your inspection.
And you?

94
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,862
Home.

95
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,464
Why, bless me, Doctor.

96
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,466
What beams you
into this neck of the woods?

97
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,969
Beware Romulans bearing gifts.

98
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,057
- Happy birthday, Jim.
- Thanks.

99
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,106
Romulan ale.
Why, Bones, you know this is illegal.

100
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,692
I only use it for medicinal purposes.

101
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,194
I got a border ship that brings me in
a case every now and then

102
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,946
across the Neutral Zone.

103
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,615
- Now, don't be a prig.
- 2283.

104
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,952
Yeah, well,
it takes this stuff a while to ferment.

105
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,706
Here, give me. Now, you open this one.

106
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,876
I'm almost afraid to. What is it?

107
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,504
Klingon aphrodisiacs?

108
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,299
No. More antiques for your collection.

109
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:58,805
Bones, this is charming.

110
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,765
They're 400 years old.

111
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:03,518
And you don't find many
with the lenses still intact.

112
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,021
- What is it?
- They're for your eyes.

113
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:11,484
For most patients your age,
I generally administer Retinax V.

114
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:14,904
- I'm allergic to Retinax.
- Exactly. Cheers.

115
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,572
Cheers.

116
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:27,458
Happy birthday.

117
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,714
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, you could say thank you.

118
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:35,132
Thank you.

119
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:44,016
Damn it, Jim,
what the hell's the matter with you?

120
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,225
Other people have birthdays.

121
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,727
Why are we treating yours
like a funeral?

122
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:50,773
- Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
- What the hell do you want?

123
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,489
This is not about age and you know it.

124
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,700
It's about you flying
a goddamn computer console

125
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,786
when you want to be out there
hopping galaxies.

126
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,162
Spare me your notions of poetry,
please.

127
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:07,956
- We all have our assigned duties.
- Bull!

128
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:13,003
You're hiding,
hiding behind rules and regulations.

129
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:17,132
- Who am I hiding from?
- From yourself, Admiral.

130
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:27,059
Don't mince words, Bones.
What do you really think?

131
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:36,485
Jim, I'm your doctor and I'm your friend.

132
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:39,905
Get back your command.

133
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:44,493
Get it back before
you turn into part of this collection.

134
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:48,080
Before you really do grow old.

135
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,475
Starship Log, Stardate 8130.4.

136
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,937
Log entry by First Officer Pavel Chekov.

137
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:15,607
Starship Reliant
on orbital approach to Ceti Alpha VI

138
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:18,193
in connection with Project Genesis.

139
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,779
We are continuing our search
for a lifeless planet

140
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:23,031
to satisfy the requirement of a test site

141
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:26,660
for the Genesis experiment.
So far, no success.

142
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,537
Standard orbit, please.

143
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:31,582
Mr. Beach, any change
in the surface scan?

144
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:36,962
Negative. Limited atmosphere
dominated by craylon gas, sand,

145
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:40,549
high-velocity winds.
Incapable of supporting life forms.

146
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:44,761
Does it have to be completely lifeless?

147
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,972
Don't tell me you found something.

148
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:51,518
We've picked up a minor energy flux
reading on one dynoscanner.

149
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:55,230
Damn. Are you sure?
Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment.

150
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,612
I suppose it could be a particle of
preanimate matter caught in the matrix.

151
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:06,158
All right.
Get on the comm-pic to Dr. Marcus.

152
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:07,284
Aye, sir.

153
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:11,121
Maybe it's something we can transplant.

154
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,290
You know what she'll say.

155
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,585
Let me get this straight.
Something you can transplant?

156
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:18,086
Yes, Doctor.

157
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:21,048
Something you can transplant?

158
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:24,676
I don't know.

159
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:28,013
But it may only be a particle
of preanimate matter.

160
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:32,684
Then again, it may not.
You boys have to be clear on this.

161
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:36,271
There can't be so much as a microbe,
or the show's off.

162
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:38,023
Why don't you have a look?

163
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:39,775
But if it is something
that can be moved, I want...

164
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:42,277
You bet, Doctor. We're on our way.

165
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,952
Well, don't have kittens,
Genesis is going to work.

166
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:53,497
They'll remember you in one breath
with Newton, Einstein, Surak!

167
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:56,416
Thanks a lot.
No respect from my offspring.

168
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:58,502
Par for the course.

169
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:00,671
Are you teaming up with me
for bridge after dinner?

170
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:03,090
Maybe. What is it?

171
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:09,263
Every time we have dealings
with Starfleet, I get nervous.

172
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:14,685
We are dealing with something
that could be perverted

173
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,478
into a dreadful weapon.

174
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:20,774
Remember that overgrown Boy Scout
you used to hang around with?

175
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:23,193
- That's exactly the kind of man...
- Listen, kiddo.

176
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,573
Jim Kirk was many things,
but he was never a Boy Scout.

177
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:31,868
Captain Terrell, stand by to beam down.

178
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:50,387
Chekov, are you sure
these are the correct coordinates?

179
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:55,183
Captain, this is the garden spot
of Ceti Alpha VI.

180
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:58,645
I can barely see it.

181
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:12,951
There's nothing here.
The tricorder must be broken.

182
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,634
Chekov, over here.

183
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:39,061
Those look like cargo carriers.

184
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:50,447
Hey, give me a hand.

185
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:32,531
What the hell happened?

186
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:35,784
If they crashed,
then where's the rest of the ship?

187
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:50,507
What the hell is that?

188
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:05,897
Botany Bay.

189
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:08,984
Botany Bay?

190
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:11,820
Oh, no!

191
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:15,657
We've got to get out of here now. Damn.

192
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,827
- What about the tricorder?
- Hurry. Never mind that. Hurry. Hurry!

193
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:22,414
Chekov, what's the matter with you?
Chekov!

194
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,417
Come on! Hurry!

195
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:43,435
Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell.

196
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,063
This is Commander Kyle.
Will you please respond, Captain?

197
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:51,026
Captain Terrell. Respond, please.

198
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,034
Let's give them a little more time.

199
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:33,985
Khan.

200
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:50,919
I don't know you.

201
00:18:58,636 --> 00:18:59,970
But you...

202
00:19:01,597 --> 00:19:03,473
I never forget a face.

203
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,436
Mr. Chekov,

204
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:11,815
isn't it?

205
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:17,571
I never thought to see your face again.

206
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:20,740
- Chekov, who is this man?
- A criminal, Captain.

207
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:24,578
A product of late 20th century
genetic engineering.

208
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:27,080
What do you want with us?
Sir, I demand to be...

209
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:30,125
You are in a position
to demand nothing, sir.

210
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:37,924
I, on the other hand,
am in a position to grant nothing.

211
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,138
What you see is all that remains
of the ship's company and crew

212
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:45,265
of the Botany Bay,

213
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:51,396
marooned here 15 years ago
by Captain James T. Kirk.

214
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:55,150
- Listen to me. You men and women...
- Captain, Captain, Captain.

215
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:01,489
Save your strength, Captain.

216
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:04,659
These people have sworn

217
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:09,289
to live and die at my command
200 years before you were born.

218
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,835
Do you mean he never told you the tale?

219
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,964
To amuse your captain? No?

220
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:24,095
Never told you how the Enterprise
picked up the Botany Bay,

221
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,265
lost in space from the year 1996,

222
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,394
myself and the ship's company
in cryogenic freeze?

223
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:34,356
- I've never even met Admiral Kirk.
- Admiral?

224
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:36,608
Admiral.

225
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:39,319
Admiral.

226
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:47,369
Never told you how Admiral Kirk

227
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:53,667
sent 70 of us into exile
on this barren sand heap,

228
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:58,505
with only the contents
of these cargo bays to sustain us?

229
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:02,050
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life!

230
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,428
- A fair chance.
- This is Ceti Alpha V.

231
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,610
Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months
after we were left here.

232
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:26,282
The shock shifted the orbit of this planet
and everything was laid waste.

233
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:32,455
Admiral Kirk never bothered
to check on our progress.

234
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:41,172
It was only the fact
of my genetically engineered intellect

235
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:43,800
that allowed us to survive.

236
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:49,848
On Earth,

237
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:54,019
two hundred years ago,

238
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:57,564
I was a prince

239
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,985
with power over millions.

240
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:04,696
Captain Kirk was your host.

241
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:09,492
You repaid his hospitality by trying
to steal his ship and murder him.

242
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,635
You didn't expect to find me.
You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.

243
00:22:33,225 --> 00:22:34,559
Why are you here?

244
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,653
Why?

245
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:56,247
Allow me to introduce you
to Ceti Alpha V's

246
00:22:56,332 --> 00:23:00,543
only remaining indigenous life form.

247
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:14,265
What do you think?

248
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:17,060
They killed 20 of my people,

249
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:22,148
including my beloved wife.

250
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:39,707
Not all at once

251
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:47,048
and not instantly, to be sure.

252
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,606
You see, their young
enter through the ears

253
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:08,236
and wrap themselves
around the cerebral cortex.

254
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:10,822
This has the effect
of rendering the victim

255
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:14,450
extremely susceptible to suggestion.

256
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:20,165
Later, as they grow,

257
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:27,255
follows madness and death.

258
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:37,765
Khan, listen to me.

259
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,519
These are pets, of course.

260
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:47,775
Not quite domesticated.

261
00:24:49,028 --> 00:24:52,238
Khan,
Captain Kirk was only doing his duty.

262
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:54,741
No!

263
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:23,728
That's better.

264
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:29,567
Now, tell me, why are you here?

265
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:35,990
And tell me
where I may find James Kirk.

266
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:41,704
Enterprise to Admiral Kirk's shuttle.

267
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:45,416
You're cleared for docking.
Approach portside torpedo bay.

268
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:51,923
Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's party
on final approach.

269
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:54,968
Enterprise welcomes you.
Prepare for docking.

270
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:11,317
I hate inspections.

271
00:26:13,112 --> 00:26:16,531
I'm delighted.
Any chance to go aboard the Enterprise.

272
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,419
Well, I, for one, am glad to have you
at the helm for three weeks.

273
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:31,212
I don't think these kids can steer.

274
00:26:48,397 --> 00:26:50,064
Open the airlock.

275
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,693
- Permission to come aboard, Captain.
- Welcome, Admiral.

276
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:57,697
I think you know my training crew.
Certainly they have come to know you.

277
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:00,908
Yes. We've been through
death and life together.

278
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:08,708
Mr. Scott, you old space dog.
You're well?

279
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:12,170
I had a wee bout, sir,
but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.

280
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:14,964
- A wee bout of what?
- Shore leave, Admiral.

281
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:16,257
Oh, yes.

282
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:20,511
And who do we have here?

283
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:24,015
Midshipman, first class,
Peter Preston, engineer's mate, sir!

284
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,641
First training voyage, Mr. Preston?

285
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:28,311
- Yes, sir!
- I see.

286
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:32,857
Well, shall we start
with the Engine Room?

287
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:35,276
We'll see you there, sir.
And everything is in order.

288
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:37,653
That'll be a pleasant surprise, Mr. Scott.

289
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:43,034
I'll see you on the Bridge, Admiral.
Company dismissed.

290
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:39,840
I believe you'll find
everything shipshape, Admiral.

291
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:40,966
Do you?

292
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,303
Do you have any idea,
Midshipman Preston,

293
00:28:44,387 --> 00:28:46,722
how many times I've had to listen
to Mr. Scott on the comm,

294
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:48,307
telling me his trouble?

295
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:51,852
Do you have any idea, the ribbing
I've had to endure in the officer's mess,

296
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:55,898
to the effect that
the Enterprise is a flying deathtrap?

297
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:57,566
No, sir.

298
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,486
This is the finest engine room
in the whole Starfleet.

299
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:03,655
If the Admiral
can't see the facts for himself,

300
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,366
then, with all due respect,

301
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,951
he is as blind as a Tiberian bat.

302
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,620
Sir!

303
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,415
Midshipman, you're a tiger.

304
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,544
My sister's youngest, Admiral.
Crazy to get to space.

305
00:29:18,254 --> 00:29:21,799
Every young man's fantasy.
I seem to remember it myself.

306
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:24,927
Well, Mr. Scott, are your engines

307
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:27,471
capable of handling
a minor training cruise?

308
00:29:27,555 --> 00:29:31,809
- Give the word, Admiral.
- Mr. Scott, the word is given.

309
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:33,102
Aye, sir.

310
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:36,230
But, Admiral, how about
the rest of the inspection?

311
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:54,539
This is Starfleet Operations.
Enterprise is clear for departure.

312
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:56,500
Admiral on the Bridge.

313
00:29:57,335 --> 00:30:00,003
- Pre-stage flux chillers, port.
- On.

314
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:03,173
- Pre-stage flux chillers, starboard.
- On.

315
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:05,342
Main stage flux chillers, port.

316
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:06,468
- Enabled.
- Running lights on.

317
00:30:06,552 --> 00:30:09,179
- Main stage flux chillers, starboard.
- Enabled.

318
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,768
Very well, Mr. Saavik.
You may clear all moorings.

319
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:16,144
Aye, sir.

320
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:21,775
- All moorings are clear, Captain.
- Thank you.

321
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:26,697
Lieutenant?

322
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:31,451
Have you ever piloted a starship
out of space dock?

323
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:32,911
Never, sir.

324
00:30:43,256 --> 00:30:45,215
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

325
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,052
Aye, sir.

326
00:30:56,936 --> 00:31:00,230
For everything,
there is a first time, Lieutenant.

327
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:02,691
Don't you agree, Admiral?

328
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:05,736
- Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
- Aft thrusters.

329
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:11,658
- Would you like a tranquillizer?
- Ahead one-quarter impulse power.

330
00:31:11,743 --> 00:31:13,744
Ahead one-quarter impulse power.

331
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,358
We are free and clear to navigate.

332
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:28,109
Course heading, Captain?

333
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:35,867
- Captain's discretion.
- Mr. Sulu, you may indulge yourself.

334
00:32:37,745 --> 00:32:38,995
Aye, sir.

335
00:33:05,231 --> 00:33:06,690
Does that about do it?

336
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:08,316
I don't think
there's another piece of information

337
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:11,027
we could squeeze
into the memory banks.

338
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:14,573
- Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
- Who'd wanna build it?

339
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:18,326
Dr. Marcus? Comm-pic coming in
on hyperchannel.

340
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,747
- It's the Starship Reliant.
- On the screen, please, Jedda.

341
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:27,210
Come in, please.
This is the Reliant calling Regula I.

342
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:31,631
Repeat, this is U.S.S. Reliant.

343
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:36,261
Commander, we are receiving.
This is Regula I. Go ahead.

344
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:42,183
Dr. Marcus. Good. We're en route to
you and should be there in three days.

345
00:33:42,894 --> 00:33:46,897
En route? Why? We weren't expecting
you for another three months.

346
00:33:47,565 --> 00:33:50,150
- Has something happened?
- Nothing has happened.

347
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:52,444
Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

348
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,198
- Then I don't understand why you...
- We have received new orders.

349
00:33:57,283 --> 00:33:59,492
Upon our arrival at Regula I,

350
00:33:59,744 --> 00:34:03,747
all materials of Project Genesis
will be transferred to this ship

351
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:06,207
for immediate testing on Ceti Alpha VI.

352
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:08,835
- Who in the hell do they think they are?
- Please be quiet.

353
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,963
Commander Chekov,
this is completely irregular.

354
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,758
Who gave the order?

355
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:18,261
The order comes
from Starfleet Command, Dr. Marcus,

356
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:20,055
direct from the general staff.

357
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:21,973
It's a civilian...

358
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:25,185
Genesis is a civilian project
under my control.

359
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:29,397
- I have my orders.
- Pin him down, Mother.

360
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:31,816
Who gave the order?

361
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:34,486
The order comes from

362
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,240
Admiral James T. Kirk.

363
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:40,992
I knew it! I knew it!

364
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,577
All along, the military's wanted to get...

365
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:45,329
This is completely improper,
Commander Chekov.

366
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:49,667
I have no intention of allowing Reliant
or any other unauthorized personnel

367
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:52,086
access to our work or materials.

368
00:34:52,546 --> 00:34:57,258
I'm sorry that you feel that way, Doctor.
Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.

369
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,763
Please prepare to deliver Genesis
to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

370
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:08,144
Well done, Commander.

371
00:35:10,397 --> 00:35:14,066
You realize, sir, they will attempt
to contact Admiral Kirk

372
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:16,027
and confirm the order.

373
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:30,333
Hold, please.

374
00:35:33,462 --> 00:35:35,004
Thank you, sir.

375
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:40,968
Lieutenant, are you wearing
your hair differently?

376
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:43,346
It's still regulation, Admiral.

377
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:47,642
May I speak, sir?

378
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:53,481
Self-expression doesn't seem
to be one of your problems.

379
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:00,988
You're bothered by your performance
on the Kobayashi Maru.

380
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:02,698
I failed to resolve the situation.

381
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:05,701
There's no correct resolution.
It's a test of character.

382
00:36:06,662 --> 00:36:09,288
May I ask how you dealt with the test?

383
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,417
You may ask.

384
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:18,089
That's a little joke.

385
00:36:18,674 --> 00:36:21,300
Humor. It is a difficult concept.

386
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,887
It is not logical.

387
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:27,932
We learn by doing.

388
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:30,267
Who's been holding up
the damn elevator?

389
00:36:30,352 --> 00:36:31,852
Thank you, sir.

390
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,065
- Did she change her hairstyle?
- I hadn't noticed.

391
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:39,193
Wonderful stuff, that Romulan ale.

392
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:42,446
- Admiral Kirk?
- Kirk here.

393
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:46,075
I have an urgent comm-pic from
Space Lab Regula I for you, sir.

394
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,743
Dr. Carol Marcus.

395
00:36:51,581 --> 00:36:53,708
- I'll take it in my quarters, Uhura.
- Aye, sir.

396
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,918
It never rains, but it pours.

397
00:36:57,421 --> 00:36:59,255
As a physician,
you of all people should appreciate

398
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,757
the dangers of re-opening old wounds.

399
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:06,679
Sorry.

400
00:37:06,763 --> 00:37:07,805
Jim, can you read me?

401
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:11,350
I can hear you, Carol. What's wrong?
What's the matter?

402
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:14,895
Why are you taking Genesis
away from us?

403
00:37:15,814 --> 00:37:18,024
Taking Genesis?
Who's taking Genesis?

404
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:19,900
Who is taking Genesis?

405
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:22,820
- I can see you, but I can't hear.
- Carol...

406
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,406
Jim, did you give the order?

407
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,784
What order? Who's taking Genesis?

408
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:29,994
Please help us, Jim.

409
00:37:30,078 --> 00:37:32,997
I will not let them have Genesis
without proper authorization!

410
00:37:33,081 --> 00:37:36,876
- Have Genesis? Who's taking...
- On whose authority can they do this?

411
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,004
- No one's authority!
- Jim, please...

412
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:41,088
Uhura, what's happening?

413
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:43,883
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.

414
00:37:46,803 --> 00:37:49,555
- Alert Starfleet Headquarters.
- Aye, sir.

415
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,349
I want to talk to Starfleet Command.

416
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:56,854
Quiet. We must have order in here.
This has to be some sort of mistake.

417
00:37:57,105 --> 00:38:00,357
Mistake! We're all alone here.

418
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:03,360
They waited until everyone was on leave
to do this.

419
00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:06,405
Reliant is supposed to be
at our disposal, not vice-versa.

420
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:07,990
It seems clear
Starfleet never intended...

421
00:38:08,074 --> 00:38:09,825
I know that,
but I can't believe the Starfleet...

422
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:11,285
I've tried warning you before.

423
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:13,620
Scientists have always been pawns
of the military.

424
00:38:13,705 --> 00:38:15,539
Starfleet has kept the peace
for 100 years.

425
00:38:15,623 --> 00:38:19,251
I cannot and will not subscribe
to your interpretation of this event.

426
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:22,838
You may be right, Doctor.
But what about Reliant?

427
00:38:24,632 --> 00:38:25,841
She's on her way.

428
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,137
Now, get your gear together
where it's handy.

429
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,014
And where are we going?

430
00:38:32,098 --> 00:38:34,433
That's for us to know,
and Reliant to find out.

431
00:38:45,861 --> 00:38:47,529
We have a problem.

432
00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:50,991
Something may be wrong on Regula I.
We've been ordered to investigate.

433
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:56,788
If memory serves, Regula I
is a scientific research laboratory.

434
00:38:57,373 --> 00:39:01,292
I told Starfleet Command
all we had was a boatload of children,

435
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,380
but we're the only ship in the quadrant.

436
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:10,468
Spock, these cadets of yours,
how good are they?

437
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:12,637
How will they respond
under real pressure?

438
00:39:12,722 --> 00:39:16,224
As with all living things,
each according to his gifts.

439
00:39:17,393 --> 00:39:19,644
Of course, this ship is yours.

440
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:23,106
No, that won't be necessary.

441
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:26,317
Just get me to Regula I.

442
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:30,905
As a teacher on a training mission,
I'm content to command the Enterprise.

443
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:33,158
If we are to go on actual duty,

444
00:39:33,242 --> 00:39:37,203
it is clear that the senior officer
onboard must assume command.

445
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:38,997
It may be nothing.

446
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:42,167
Garbled communications.

447
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,920
- You take the ship.
- Jim.

448
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:48,548
You proceed from a false assumption.

449
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:52,177
I'm a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

450
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,017
You're about to remind me
that logic alone dictates your actions?

451
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:02,562
I would not remind you
of that which you know so well.

452
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:07,650
If I may be so bold, it was a mistake
for you to accept promotion.

453
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:12,155
Commanding a starship is your first,
best destiny.

454
00:40:12,656 --> 00:40:15,617
Anything else is a waste of material.

455
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:18,328
I would not presume to debate you.

456
00:40:19,455 --> 00:40:20,955
That is wise.

457
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:24,334
In any case, were I to invoke logic,

458
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,461
logic clearly dictates

459
00:40:26,545 --> 00:40:30,131
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

460
00:40:31,675 --> 00:40:33,051
Or the one.

461
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:42,644
You are my superior officer.
You are also my friend.

462
00:40:43,854 --> 00:40:46,481
I have been and always shall be yours.

463
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,070
- Stop energizers.
- Stop energizers.

464
00:40:52,154 --> 00:40:53,905
Put me on speakers.

465
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:59,369
An emergency situation has arisen.

466
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,747
By order of Starfleet Command,
as of now, 1800 hours,

467
00:41:02,832 --> 00:41:04,916
I'm assuming command of this vessel.

468
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,918
Duty officer, so note in the ship's log.

469
00:41:07,002 --> 00:41:09,629
Plot a new course
for Space Laboratory Regula I.

470
00:41:09,713 --> 00:41:11,131
Engine Room.

471
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:13,299
- Mr. Scott.
- Aye, sir?

472
00:41:13,801 --> 00:41:16,511
- We'll be going to warp speed.
- Aye, sir.

473
00:41:17,346 --> 00:41:21,057
- Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral.
- Engage warp engines.

474
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,811
- Prepare for warp speed.
- Ready, sir.

475
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,651
I know that none of you
were expecting this. I'm sorry.

476
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:35,864
I'm going to have to ask you to grow up
a little bit sooner than you expected.

477
00:41:35,948 --> 00:41:37,407
Warp 5, Sulu.

478
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:42,162
So much for the little training cruise.

479
00:41:51,046 --> 00:41:53,464
Course to intercept Enterprise
ready, sir.

480
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:54,716
Excellent.

481
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,719
- Helmsman?
- Sir, may I speak?

482
00:42:03,475 --> 00:42:05,435
We're all with you, sir.

483
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,438
But consider this.

484
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:13,568
We are free. We have a ship
and the means to go where we will.

485
00:42:15,237 --> 00:42:18,364
We have escaped
permanent exile on Ceti Alpha V.

486
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:25,455
You have proved your superior intellect
and defeated the plans of Admiral Kirk.

487
00:42:27,374 --> 00:42:29,918
You do not need to defeat him again.

488
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:35,798
He tasks me.
He tasks me and I shall have him.

489
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,054
I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia

490
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:44,140
and round the Antares maelstrom

491
00:42:44,225 --> 00:42:48,228
and round perdition's flames
before I give him up.

492
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:53,441
Prepare to alter course.

493
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:57,779
Space Station Regula I, please come in.

494
00:42:58,113 --> 00:43:00,114
Dr. Marcus, please respond.

495
00:43:02,701 --> 00:43:04,744
This is Enterprise...

496
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:08,665
It's no use.
There's no response from Regula I.

497
00:43:08,749 --> 00:43:11,626
- But no longer jammed?
- No, sir. No nothing.

498
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,261
There are two possibilities.

499
00:43:21,345 --> 00:43:24,931
They are unable to respond.
They are unwilling to respond.

500
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:28,351
- How far?
- 12 hours, 43 minutes, present speed.

501
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,815
"Give up Genesis," she said.

502
00:43:34,566 --> 00:43:36,901
What in God's name does it mean?
Give it up to whom?

503
00:43:36,986 --> 00:43:40,655
It might help my analysis
if I knew what Genesis was,

504
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:42,699
beyond the biblical reference.

505
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:45,576
Uhura, have Dr. McCoy
join us in my quarters.

506
00:43:45,661 --> 00:43:47,453
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Saavik?

507
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,206
You have the conn.

508
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:56,129
Well, I've got Sickbay ready.

509
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:58,965
Now, will someone please tell me
what's going on?

510
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:03,970
Computer. Request security procedure

511
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:07,098
and access to Project Genesis
summary.

512
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:12,562
- Identify for retina scan.
- Kirk, Admiral James T.

513
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:24,198
- Security Scan approved.
- Summary, please?

514
00:44:28,662 --> 00:44:32,248
Project Genesis.
A proposal to the Federation.

515
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:35,376
- Carol Marcus.
- Yes.

516
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:37,712
What exactly is Genesis?

517
00:44:38,964 --> 00:44:43,259
Well, put simply,
Genesis is life from lifelessness.

518
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,431
It is a process whereby
molecular structure is reorganized

519
00:44:48,515 --> 00:44:53,353
at the subatomic level into
life-generating matter of equal mass.

520
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:57,148
Stage one of our experiments
was conducted in the laboratory.

521
00:44:57,232 --> 00:45:01,486
Stage two of the series will be
attempted in a lifeless underground.

522
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:05,239
Stage three will involve
the process on a planetary scale.

523
00:45:05,908 --> 00:45:08,993
It is our intention to introduce
the Genesis device

524
00:45:09,078 --> 00:45:12,330
into a preselected area
of a lifeless space body,

525
00:45:12,414 --> 00:45:14,248
a moon or other dead form.

526
00:45:15,209 --> 00:45:16,584
The device is delivered,

527
00:45:16,668 --> 00:45:20,254
instantaneously causing
what we call the Genesis Effect.

528
00:45:21,256 --> 00:45:24,550
Matter is reorganized
with life-generating results.

529
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:43,736
Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet

530
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:47,865
capable of sustaining whatever
life forms we see fit to deposit on it.

531
00:45:49,118 --> 00:45:50,243
Fascinating.

532
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:52,286
The reformed moon simulated here

533
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:55,498
represents the merest fraction
of the Genesis' potential,

534
00:45:55,582 --> 00:45:58,000
should the Federation
wish to fund these experiments

535
00:45:58,085 --> 00:46:00,211
to their logical conclusion.

536
00:46:00,796 --> 00:46:05,258
When we consider the cosmic problems
of population and food supply,

537
00:46:05,342 --> 00:46:08,302
the usefulness of this process
becomes clear.

538
00:46:08,637 --> 00:46:11,806
This concludes our proposal.
Thank you for your attention.

539
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:14,642
It literally is genesis.

540
00:46:16,478 --> 00:46:18,146
Power of creation.

541
00:46:20,774 --> 00:46:22,692
Have they proceeded
with their experiments?

542
00:46:22,776 --> 00:46:24,068
Well, the tape was made
about a year ago,

543
00:46:24,153 --> 00:46:27,613
so I can only assume
they've reached stage two by now.

544
00:46:28,115 --> 00:46:31,534
Dear Lord, do you think
we're intelligent enough to...

545
00:46:32,453 --> 00:46:36,998
Suppose... What if this thing
were used where life already exists?

546
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:41,502
It would destroy such life
in favor of its new matrix.

547
00:46:42,171 --> 00:46:46,549
Its new matrix? Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

548
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:51,304
I was not attempting to evaluate
its moral implications, Doctor.

549
00:46:51,513 --> 00:46:53,264
As a matter of cosmic history,

550
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:56,601
it has always been easier to destroy
than to create.

551
00:46:56,685 --> 00:46:59,854
Not anymore!
Now we can do both at the same time.

552
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:03,232
According to myth,
the Earth was created in six days.

553
00:47:03,317 --> 00:47:07,570
Now, watch out. Here comes Genesis.
We'll do it for you in six minutes.

554
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,239
I do not dispute,
that in the wrong hands...

555
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:12,407
"In the wrong hands?"

556
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:16,870
Would you mind telling me whose are
the right hands, my logical friend?

557
00:47:19,624 --> 00:47:22,918
Are you, by any chance,
in favor of these experiments?

558
00:47:23,002 --> 00:47:24,002
Gentlemen, gentlemen, this isn't...

559
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:27,673
Really, Dr. McCoy,
you must learn to govern your passions.

560
00:47:28,424 --> 00:47:31,885
They will be your undoing.
Logic suggests...

561
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:35,430
Logic?
My God, the man's talking about logic.

562
00:47:35,974 --> 00:47:38,725
We're talking about
universal Armageddon.

563
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:41,144
- You green-blooded, inhuman...
- Bridge to Admiral Kirk.

564
00:47:42,814 --> 00:47:46,608
Admiral, sensors indicate
a vessel in our area, closing fast.

565
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:51,071
- What do you make of her?
- It's one of ours, Admiral. It's Reliant.

566
00:47:51,155 --> 00:47:52,405
Reliant?

567
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,994
Try the emergency channels.

568
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:04,417
Picture, Mr. Saavik.

569
00:48:20,184 --> 00:48:22,102
Slow to one-half impulse power.

570
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:28,150
- Let's be friends.
- Slowing to one-half impulse power.

571
00:48:28,776 --> 00:48:32,320
Reliant in our section,
this quadrant, sir, and slowing.

572
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:37,534
Sir? May I quote General Order 12?
"On the approach of any vessel

573
00:48:37,618 --> 00:48:39,369
"when communications
have not been established..."

574
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:42,998
Lieutenant. The Admiral is well aware
of the regulations.

575
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:45,458
Aye, sir.

576
00:48:49,297 --> 00:48:52,174
Is it possible
their comm system has failed?

577
00:48:52,884 --> 00:48:54,426
It would explain a great many things.

578
00:48:55,094 --> 00:48:57,721
They're requesting communications, sir.

579
00:48:58,181 --> 00:48:59,598
Let them eat static.

580
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:04,394
They're still running with shields down.

581
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:07,772
Of course. We are one big happy fleet.

582
00:49:09,817 --> 00:49:12,569
Kirk, my old friend.

583
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:15,947
Do you know the Klingon proverb
that tells us,

584
00:49:16,032 --> 00:49:19,659
"Revenge is a dish
that is best served cold?"

585
00:49:22,788 --> 00:49:27,292
It is very cold in space.

586
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:39,137
This is damn peculiar.

587
00:49:41,182 --> 00:49:43,850
- Yellow alert.
- Energize defense fields.

588
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:51,775
I'm getting a voice message.

589
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:55,278
They say their chambers coil
is overloading their comm system.

590
00:49:55,363 --> 00:49:57,030
- Spock?
- Scanning.

591
00:49:58,282 --> 00:49:59,741
Their coil emissions are normal.

592
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:06,539
- They still haven't raised their shields.
- Raise ours.

593
00:50:09,043 --> 00:50:10,043
Their shields are going up.

594
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:11,878
Lock phasers on target.

595
00:50:13,297 --> 00:50:14,756
Locking phasers on target.

596
00:50:14,882 --> 00:50:17,008
- They're locking phasers.
- Raise shields.

597
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:18,218
Fire!

598
00:50:33,442 --> 00:50:35,318
- Sulu, get those shields up.
- Trying, sir.

599
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:40,573
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

600
00:50:51,252 --> 00:50:53,420
I need air! I need air!

601
00:50:58,718 --> 00:51:00,593
I can't get power, sir.

602
00:51:02,763 --> 00:51:03,972
Scotty?

603
00:51:04,765 --> 00:51:07,892
- Uhura, turn off those damn channels!
- Mr. Scott on the screen.

604
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:12,397
We're just hanging on, sir.
The main energizer's out.

605
00:51:12,481 --> 00:51:15,984
- Try auxiliary power!
- Aye, aye, sir.

606
00:51:16,068 --> 00:51:17,569
Damage report.

607
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:26,453
They knew exactly where to hit us.

608
00:51:26,537 --> 00:51:29,956
Who? Who knew where to hit us?
And why?

609
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:33,710
One thing is certain.
We cannot escape on auxiliary power.

610
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:37,047
Visual.

611
00:51:39,884 --> 00:51:42,052
- Sulu, divert all power to phasers.
- Too late.

612
00:51:42,136 --> 00:51:43,386
Hang on!

613
00:51:54,648 --> 00:51:57,442
Scotty! What's left?

614
00:51:57,526 --> 00:52:01,112
Just the batteries, sir. I can have
auxiliary power in a few minutes.

615
00:52:01,197 --> 00:52:03,323
We don't have a few minutes!

616
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:12,665
- Can you give me phaser power?
- A few shots, sir.

617
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,168
- Not enough against their shields.
- Who the hell are they?

618
00:52:15,252 --> 00:52:18,546
Admiral, the Commander of the Reliant
is signaling.

619
00:52:18,756 --> 00:52:21,674
He wishes to discuss
terms of our surrender.

620
00:52:31,685 --> 00:52:33,478
- Put it on screen.
- Admiral...

621
00:52:33,562 --> 00:52:36,231
Do it! While we still have time.

622
00:52:43,114 --> 00:52:44,656
On screen, sir.

623
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:56,251
- Khan.
- You still remember, Admiral.

624
00:52:57,294 --> 00:53:02,632
I cannot help but be touched.
I, of course, remember you.

625
00:53:02,716 --> 00:53:06,970
What is the meaning of this attack?
Where is the crew of the Reliant?

626
00:53:07,763 --> 00:53:10,306
Surely I have made my meaning plain.

627
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:14,227
I mean to avenge myself
upon you, Admiral.

628
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:16,396
I've deprived your ship of power,

629
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,191
and when I swing around,
I mean to deprive you of your life.

630
00:53:22,236 --> 00:53:26,364
But I wanted you to know first
who it was who had beaten you.

631
00:53:27,992 --> 00:53:32,537
Khan, if it's me you want,

632
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:37,417
I'll have myself beamed aboard.
Spare my crew.

633
00:53:38,169 --> 00:53:40,420
I make you a counterproposal.

634
00:53:40,754 --> 00:53:47,302
I'll agree to your terms if,
in addition to yourself,

635
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:50,263
you hand over to me
all data and material

636
00:53:50,347 --> 00:53:53,933
regarding the project called Genesis.

637
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:58,438
- Genesis? What's that?
- Don't insult my intelligence, Kirk.

638
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:02,525
Give me some time to recall
the data on our computers.

639
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,944
I give you 60 seconds, Admiral.

640
00:54:11,827 --> 00:54:13,453
Clear the Bridge.

641
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:21,794
At least we know
he doesn't have Genesis.

642
00:54:22,254 --> 00:54:25,298
Keep nodding
as though I'm still giving orders.

643
00:54:25,466 --> 00:54:29,219
Mr. Saavik, punch up the data charts
of Reliant's command console.

644
00:54:29,303 --> 00:54:30,678
Reliant's command?

645
00:54:30,763 --> 00:54:31,888
- Hurry!
- 45 seconds.

646
00:54:31,972 --> 00:54:33,848
- The prefix code?
- That's all we've got.

647
00:54:40,314 --> 00:54:42,565
- The chart's up, sir.
- Admiral.

648
00:54:42,942 --> 00:54:44,567
We're finding it.

649
00:54:46,111 --> 00:54:47,153
Admiral.

650
00:54:47,488 --> 00:54:48,738
Please.

651
00:54:48,822 --> 00:54:50,448
Please, you've gotta give us time.

652
00:54:50,533 --> 00:54:53,243
The Bridge is smashed.
The computer's inoperative.

653
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:56,037
Time is a luxury
you don't have, Admiral.

654
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,504
Damn!

655
00:55:06,006 --> 00:55:08,716
- Admiral?
- It's coming through now, Khan.

656
00:55:13,264 --> 00:55:18,601
- Reliant's prefix number is 16309.
- I don't understand.

657
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:21,729
You have to learn
why things work on a starship.

658
00:55:21,814 --> 00:55:24,107
Each ship has its own combination code

659
00:55:24,191 --> 00:55:27,527
to prevent an enemy
from doing what we're attempting.

660
00:55:28,404 --> 00:55:33,408
We're using our console
to order Reliant to lower her shields.

661
00:55:33,492 --> 00:55:36,578
Assuming he hasn't changed
the combination. He's quite intelligent.

662
00:55:36,662 --> 00:55:38,663
Fifteen seconds, Admiral.

663
00:55:43,419 --> 00:55:46,129
Khan, how do we know
you'll keep your word?

664
00:55:46,213 --> 00:55:48,881
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral.

665
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:52,635
In my judgment,
you simply have no alternative.

666
00:55:55,723 --> 00:55:57,390
I see your point.

667
00:55:58,684 --> 00:56:01,269
Stand by to receive our transmission.

668
00:56:02,605 --> 00:56:05,898
Mr. Sulu, lock the phasers on target
and await my command.

669
00:56:05,983 --> 00:56:07,525
Phasers locked.

670
00:56:08,652 --> 00:56:12,864
- Time's up, Admiral.
- Here it comes.

671
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:15,867
Now, Mr. Spock.

672
00:56:22,207 --> 00:56:24,417
Sir, our shields are dropping.

673
00:56:26,462 --> 00:56:29,797
- Raise them.
- I can't!

674
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:34,177
Where's the override? The override?

675
00:56:34,762 --> 00:56:35,845
Fire.

676
00:56:38,557 --> 00:56:39,641
Fire.

677
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:46,689
Fire! Fire!

678
00:56:46,774 --> 00:56:49,025
- We can't fire, sir.
- Why can't you?

679
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:53,655
They've damaged the photon control
and the warp drive. We must withdraw.

680
00:56:53,906 --> 00:56:55,782
- No! No!
- Sir, we must!

681
00:57:02,956 --> 00:57:06,626
Enterprise can wait.
She's not going anywhere.

682
00:57:15,803 --> 00:57:18,137
- Sir, you did it.
- I did nothing.

683
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:22,266
Except get caught
with my breeches down.

684
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:24,102
I must be getting senile.

685
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,106
Mr. Saavik, you go right on
quoting regulations.

686
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,027
In the meantime,
let's find out how badly we've been hurt.

687
00:58:21,034 --> 00:58:22,535
- Is the word given, Admiral?

688
00:58:22,827 --> 00:58:24,411
The word is given.

689
00:58:26,247 --> 00:58:27,623
Warp speed.

690
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,416
Aye.

691
00:58:46,976 --> 00:58:47,976
Why?

692
00:58:51,439 --> 00:58:53,357
He wants to kill me

693
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:56,193
for passing sentence on him
15 years ago.

694
00:58:56,277 --> 00:58:59,780
And he doesn't care who stands
between him and his vengeance.

695
00:59:01,282 --> 00:59:02,574
I'm sorry, Scotty.

696
00:59:04,827 --> 00:59:08,747
He stayed at his post
when the trainees ran.

697
00:59:08,998 --> 00:59:12,793
- Admiral? This is Spock.
- Yes, Spock?

698
00:59:13,086 --> 00:59:15,879
Engine Room
reports auxiliary power restored.

699
00:59:15,964 --> 00:59:18,298
We can proceed at impulse power.

700
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,677
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out.

701
00:59:26,557 --> 00:59:28,225
Scotty, I have to ask.

702
00:59:30,061 --> 00:59:32,729
Is there any chance of getting
the mains back on the line?

703
00:59:32,814 --> 00:59:35,732
I do not think so, sir,
but you'll have my best.

704
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:40,529
Thanks, I know you tried, Doctor.

705
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:49,496
Are you all right?

706
00:59:49,747 --> 00:59:51,957
Well, I don't know.

707
00:59:53,418 --> 00:59:56,545
Doctors lose patients sometimes.
Damn it.

708
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,507
I'm still in the dark.
How did he know about Genesis?

709
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:02,009
I don't know.

710
01:00:03,678 --> 01:00:06,930
But what's important now is to
prevent him from getting his hands on it.

711
01:00:07,015 --> 01:00:10,517
You said it yourself, it's a bang
that could rearrange the universe.

712
01:00:11,019 --> 01:00:12,686
There still may be time.

713
01:00:15,023 --> 01:00:17,024
You gave as good as you got.

714
01:00:20,028 --> 01:00:21,528
We're alive only because

715
01:00:21,612 --> 01:00:24,364
I knew something about these ships
that he didn't.

716
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:33,123
Approaching Regula
and Space Lab Regula I.

717
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:36,668
Space Station Regula I,
this is the Starship Enterprise.

718
01:00:36,753 --> 01:00:38,295
Please come in.

719
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:44,676
Space Station Regula I, do you read?

720
01:00:47,555 --> 01:00:51,475
Space Station Regula I,
this is Enterprise. Please acknowledge.

721
01:00:53,394 --> 01:00:55,896
This is Enterprise. Do you read me?

722
01:00:58,649 --> 01:01:02,944
Space Station Regula I, do you read?
Please come in.

723
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,781
There's no response, sir.

724
01:01:09,702 --> 01:01:11,203
Sensors, Captain?

725
01:01:11,287 --> 01:01:13,622
The scanners and sensors
are still inoperative.

726
01:01:13,706 --> 01:01:16,249
There's no way
to ascertain what's inside the station.

727
01:01:16,334 --> 01:01:18,460
No way of telling
if Reliant is still in the area.

728
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:19,878
Precisely.

729
01:01:20,046 --> 01:01:22,464
What do you make
of that planetoid beyond?

730
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,382
Regula is Class-D.

731
01:01:24,467 --> 01:01:28,220
It consists
of various unremarkable ores,

732
01:01:28,721 --> 01:01:30,430
essentially a great rock in space.

733
01:01:30,515 --> 01:01:32,390
And Reliant could be hiding
behind that rock.

734
01:01:32,475 --> 01:01:34,392
A distinct possibility.

735
01:01:36,521 --> 01:01:38,355
- Engineering.
- Aye, sir?

736
01:01:38,439 --> 01:01:41,733
Mr. Scott? Do you have
enough power for transporters?

737
01:01:42,777 --> 01:01:44,194
Barely, sir.

738
01:01:46,948 --> 01:01:49,449
- I'm going down there.
- Khan could be down there.

739
01:01:49,534 --> 01:01:51,326
He's been there,
hasn't found what he wants.

740
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,078
Can you spare someone?
There may be people hurt.

741
01:01:53,162 --> 01:01:56,164
- Yeah, I can spare me.
- Begging the Admiral's pardon.

742
01:01:56,249 --> 01:01:58,875
General Order 15,
"No flag officer shall beam

743
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,586
"into a hazardous area
without armed escort."

744
01:02:01,879 --> 01:02:03,964
There's no such regulation.

745
01:02:08,261 --> 01:02:10,846
All right, join the party.
Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

746
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:14,975
- Jim, be careful.
- We will.

747
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,959
Indeterminate life signs.

748
01:02:44,672 --> 01:02:46,298
Phasers on stun.

749
01:02:50,052 --> 01:02:51,303
Move out.

750
01:03:57,078 --> 01:03:58,161
Jim!

751
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:09,464
Well, rigor hasn't set in.

752
01:04:09,548 --> 01:04:11,716
This couldn't have happened
too long ago, Jim.

753
01:04:13,052 --> 01:04:14,052
Carol.

754
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:18,390
This is Enterprise calling
Space Lab Regula I. Respond, please.

755
01:04:18,891 --> 01:04:23,561
- Admiral, over here.
- Dr. Marcus, come in, please.

756
01:04:48,546 --> 01:04:49,879
Oh, my God.

757
01:04:49,964 --> 01:04:51,923
Please acknowledge signal.

758
01:04:52,008 --> 01:04:53,508
- Please...
- Commander Uhura,

759
01:04:53,592 --> 01:04:57,595
this is Lieutenant Saavik.
We're all right. Please stand by. Out.

760
01:04:59,932 --> 01:05:02,851
Oh, sir, it was Khan.

761
01:05:03,936 --> 01:05:07,522
- We found him on Ceti Alpha V.
- Easy. Easy, Pav.

762
01:05:08,274 --> 01:05:14,446
He put creatures in our bodies
to control our minds.

763
01:05:16,324 --> 01:05:18,658
It's all right. You're safe now.

764
01:05:18,784 --> 01:05:21,619
Made us say lies, do things.

765
01:05:22,955 --> 01:05:24,748
But we beat him.

766
01:05:24,832 --> 01:05:27,751
He thought he controlled us,
but he did not.

767
01:05:28,627 --> 01:05:31,046
- The Captain was strong.
- Captain.

768
01:05:32,506 --> 01:05:36,634
Where's Dr. Marcus?
Where are the Genesis materials?

769
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,889
He couldn't find them.
Even the data banks were empty.

770
01:05:41,307 --> 01:05:44,768
- Erased?
- He tortured those people,

771
01:05:45,895 --> 01:05:49,898
but none of them
would tell him anything. He went wild.

772
01:05:49,982 --> 01:05:55,028
He slit their throats.
He wanted to tear the place apart.

773
01:05:56,238 --> 01:05:57,572
But he was late.

774
01:05:57,656 --> 01:06:00,825
He had to get back to the Reliant
in time to blow you to bits.

775
01:06:01,535 --> 01:06:03,745
Where's Reliant's crew? Dead?

776
01:06:05,915 --> 01:06:07,916
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V.

777
01:06:09,293 --> 01:06:13,046
He's completely mad, Admiral.
He blames you for the death of his wife.

778
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,340
I know what he blames me for.

779
01:06:19,303 --> 01:06:24,849
The escape pods are all in place.
Where's the Transporter Room?

780
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:30,188
- Did he make it down here?
- It was not my impression.

781
01:06:30,272 --> 01:06:31,439
He spent most of his time

782
01:06:31,524 --> 01:06:33,858
trying to wring the information
out of the people.

783
01:06:33,943 --> 01:06:36,778
- Anything?
- The unit's been left on.

784
01:06:38,364 --> 01:06:40,657
Which means
nobody remained to turn it off.

785
01:06:40,741 --> 01:06:45,161
Those people back there bought
escape time for Genesis with their lives.

786
01:06:45,246 --> 01:06:46,621
This is not logical.

787
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,125
These coordinates
are deep inside Regula,

788
01:06:50,209 --> 01:06:52,710
a planetoid we know to be lifeless.

789
01:06:55,256 --> 01:06:58,633
If stage two was completed,
it was going to be underground.

790
01:06:58,717 --> 01:07:01,094
It was going to be underground,
she said.

791
01:07:01,178 --> 01:07:02,846
Stage two of what?

792
01:07:04,557 --> 01:07:06,808
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Spock here.

793
01:07:06,892 --> 01:07:09,018
Captain Spock, damage report.

794
01:07:09,103 --> 01:07:13,148
Admiral, if we go by the book,
like Lieutenant Saavik,

795
01:07:14,024 --> 01:07:16,109
hours could seem like days.

796
01:07:16,861 --> 01:07:20,363
- I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
- The situation is grave, Admiral.

797
01:07:20,448 --> 01:07:25,535
We won't have main power for six days.
Auxiliary power has temporarily failed.

798
01:07:25,995 --> 01:07:31,708
Restoration may be possible
in two days, by the book, Admiral.

799
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:35,253
- Meaning you can't even beam us back?
- Not at present.

800
01:07:38,174 --> 01:07:41,759
Captain Spock. If you don't hear
from us within one hour,

801
01:07:42,428 --> 01:07:45,013
your orders are to restore
what power you can,

802
01:07:45,097 --> 01:07:47,724
take the Enterprise
to the nearest starbase

803
01:07:47,808 --> 01:07:50,435
and alert Starfleet Command
as soon as you're out of jamming range.

804
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:52,812
Sir, we won't leave you behind.

805
01:07:52,938 --> 01:07:57,442
Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.

806
01:07:58,611 --> 01:08:01,321
Well, gentlemen,
you can stay here, or...

807
01:08:01,655 --> 01:08:04,782
If it's all the same, Admiral,
we'd like to share the risk.

808
01:08:06,577 --> 01:08:08,870
Right. Let's go. Saavik?

809
01:08:10,831 --> 01:08:13,958
- Go? Where are we going?
- Where they went.

810
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,463
Suppose they went nowhere?

811
01:08:18,797 --> 01:08:22,425
Then this will be your big chance
to get away from it all.

812
01:08:51,622 --> 01:08:52,830
Admiral.

813
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:08,972
Genesis, I presume.

814
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:20,233
- Phasers down.
- You.

815
01:09:29,368 --> 01:09:31,786
- Where's Dr. Marcus?
- I'm Dr. Marcus.

816
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:33,162
Jim!

817
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,136
Is that David?

818
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:51,389
Mother, he killed everybody
we left behind.

819
01:09:53,017 --> 01:09:54,767
Of course he didn't.

820
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:57,979
David, you're just making this harder.

821
01:09:58,063 --> 01:10:01,357
I'm afraid it's even harder
than you think, Doctor.

822
01:10:01,984 --> 01:10:04,652
Please don't move.

823
01:10:05,321 --> 01:10:09,907
- Chekov.
- I'm sorry, Admiral.

824
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:14,245
Your Excellency,
have you been listening?

825
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:19,917
I have indeed, Captain.

826
01:10:20,628 --> 01:10:21,836
You have done well.

827
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,172
I knew it! You son of a bitch!

828
01:10:26,675 --> 01:10:31,054
- Don't move! Anybody!
- Captain? We are waiting.

829
01:10:32,097 --> 01:10:33,139
What's the delay?

830
01:10:33,682 --> 01:10:35,141
All is well, sir.

831
01:10:35,351 --> 01:10:37,435
You have the coordinates
to beam up Genesis.

832
01:10:39,688 --> 01:10:42,482
First things first, Captain.

833
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:47,028
Kill Admiral Kirk.

834
01:10:58,082 --> 01:11:00,124
Sir, it is difficult. I...

835
01:11:01,043 --> 01:11:04,212
- I try to obey, but...
- Kill him.

836
01:11:04,963 --> 01:11:06,005
I...

837
01:11:14,223 --> 01:11:16,140
Kill him, Terrell, now.

838
01:11:39,957 --> 01:11:41,332
God's sakes!

839
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:44,335
What is it?

840
01:12:05,107 --> 01:12:06,315
Khan, you bloodsucker!

841
01:12:07,317 --> 01:12:08,985
You're gonna have to do
your own dirty work now.

842
01:12:09,069 --> 01:12:10,903
Do you hear me? Do you?

843
01:12:13,991 --> 01:12:15,074
Kirk.

844
01:12:17,911 --> 01:12:20,997
Kirk, you're still alive, my old friend.

845
01:12:21,874 --> 01:12:28,337
Still, old friend, you've managed
to kill just about everyone else,

846
01:12:28,422 --> 01:12:31,883
but like a poor marksman,
you keep missing the target.

847
01:12:41,935 --> 01:12:44,687
Perhaps I no longer need to try,
Admiral.

848
01:12:51,403 --> 01:12:53,821
- Oh, no.
- Let go. He can't take it!

849
01:12:57,242 --> 01:12:58,326
Khan.

850
01:13:03,415 --> 01:13:06,334
Khan, you've got Genesis,
but you don't have me.

851
01:13:06,418 --> 01:13:09,086
You were going to kill me, Khan.
You're gonna have to come down here.

852
01:13:09,171 --> 01:13:11,798
You're going to have
to come down here.

853
01:13:12,758 --> 01:13:15,218
I've done far worse than kill you.

854
01:13:18,263 --> 01:13:24,602
I've hurt you,
and I wish to go on hurting you.

855
01:13:27,815 --> 01:13:30,233
I shall leave you as you left me,

856
01:13:30,776 --> 01:13:32,360
as you left her,

857
01:13:32,694 --> 01:13:37,615
marooned for all eternity
in the center of a dead planet.

858
01:13:39,618 --> 01:13:43,037
Buried alive. Buried alive.

859
01:13:44,957 --> 01:13:46,040
Khan!

860
01:13:47,876 --> 01:13:48,960
Khan!

861
01:13:55,801 --> 01:13:59,637
This is Lieutenant Saavik
calling Enterprise. Can you read us?

862
01:14:01,056 --> 01:14:03,766
This is Lieutenant Saavik
calling Enterprise. Can you read us?

863
01:14:03,851 --> 01:14:05,685
- He's coming around.
- Pavel?

864
01:14:05,769 --> 01:14:07,353
Can you read us?

865
01:14:09,398 --> 01:14:12,984
It's no use, Admiral.
They're still jamming all channels.

866
01:14:13,819 --> 01:14:16,612
If Enterprise followed orders,
she's long since gone.

867
01:14:16,697 --> 01:14:19,323
If she couldn't obey, she's finished.

868
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:22,201
So are we, it looks like.

869
01:14:23,787 --> 01:14:27,039
I don't understand.
Who's responsible for all this?

870
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:29,542
Who is Khan?

871
01:14:29,918 --> 01:14:33,337
- Well, it's a long story.
- We appear to have plenty of time.

872
01:14:38,051 --> 01:14:39,176
Is there anything to eat?

873
01:14:39,261 --> 01:14:42,305
I don't know about anybody else,
but I'm starved.

874
01:14:42,431 --> 01:14:44,974
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

875
01:14:45,058 --> 01:14:47,518
First order of business, survival.

876
01:14:48,061 --> 01:14:50,521
There's food in the Genesis cave.

877
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:55,568
Enough to last a lifetime, if necessary.

878
01:14:56,862 --> 01:14:59,363
- We thought this was Genesis.
- This?

879
01:15:02,826 --> 01:15:06,370
It took the Starfleet Corps of Engineers
10 months in spacesuits

880
01:15:06,455 --> 01:15:08,414
to tunnel out all this.

881
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,877
What we did in there, we did in a day.

882
01:15:13,545 --> 01:15:18,215
David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy
and the Lieutenant our idea of food?

883
01:15:19,009 --> 01:15:20,384
We can't just sit here.

884
01:15:22,638 --> 01:15:23,804
Oh, yes, we can.

885
01:15:23,889 --> 01:15:26,515
This is just to give us something to do,
isn't it?

886
01:15:29,645 --> 01:15:30,895
Come on.

887
01:15:38,737 --> 01:15:39,987
Admiral?

888
01:15:41,156 --> 01:15:42,990
As your teacher Mr. Spock
is fond of saying,

889
01:15:43,075 --> 01:15:46,619
"I'd like to think
that there always are possibilities."

890
01:15:59,633 --> 01:16:02,927
I did what you wanted. I stayed away.

891
01:16:06,181 --> 01:16:08,099
Why didn't you tell him?

892
01:16:09,101 --> 01:16:11,102
How can you ask me that?

893
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:15,648
Were we together?
Were we going to be?

894
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:19,944
You had your world and I had mine,

895
01:16:21,613 --> 01:16:23,614
and I wanted him in mine,

896
01:16:23,865 --> 01:16:27,034
not chasing through the universe
with his father.

897
01:16:37,587 --> 01:16:43,968
Actually, he's a lot like you
in many ways.

898
01:16:48,223 --> 01:16:50,725
Please tell me what you're feeling.

899
01:16:54,146 --> 01:16:57,314
There's a man out there
I haven't seen in 15 years

900
01:16:57,399 --> 01:16:59,358
who's trying to kill me.

901
01:17:01,695 --> 01:17:04,697
You show me a son
that'd be happy to help him.

902
01:17:07,826 --> 01:17:09,035
My son.

903
01:17:13,498 --> 01:17:15,875
My life that could have been

904
01:17:17,002 --> 01:17:18,502
and wasn't.

905
01:17:21,214 --> 01:17:22,882
What am I feeling?

906
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,304
Old.

907
01:17:32,017 --> 01:17:33,309
Worn out.

908
01:17:40,192 --> 01:17:42,193
Let me show you something

909
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:48,032
that'll make you feel young,
as when the world was new.

910
01:18:02,214 --> 01:18:04,090
Impulse power restored.

911
01:18:05,217 --> 01:18:10,054
Excellent.
More than a match for poor Enterprise.

912
01:18:31,243 --> 01:18:33,244
You did all this in a day?

913
01:18:34,287 --> 01:18:36,413
The matrix formed in a day.

914
01:18:36,915 --> 01:18:41,794
The life forms grew later
at a substantially accelerated rate.

915
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:49,969
Jim, this is incredible!
Have you ever seen the like?

916
01:18:52,889 --> 01:18:55,224
Can I cook or can't I?

917
01:19:13,994 --> 01:19:15,452
Where is she?

918
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:23,961
Sir, may I ask you a question?

919
01:19:24,296 --> 01:19:27,673
- What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
- The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

920
01:19:27,757 --> 01:19:30,176
Are you asking me
if we're playing out that scenario now?

921
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:33,846
On the test, sir,
will you tell me what you did?

922
01:19:35,098 --> 01:19:36,599
I would really like to know.

923
01:19:36,683 --> 01:19:40,728
Lieutenant, you are looking
at the only Starfleet cadet

924
01:19:40,812 --> 01:19:43,272
who ever beat the no-win scenario.

925
01:19:44,107 --> 01:19:45,149
How?

926
01:19:46,151 --> 01:19:50,237
I reprogrammed the simulation
so it was possible to rescue the ship.

927
01:19:50,322 --> 01:19:52,740
- What?
- He cheated.

928
01:19:52,824 --> 01:19:55,409
I changed the conditions of the test.

929
01:19:55,619 --> 01:19:58,495
I got a commendation
for original thinking.

930
01:19:59,664 --> 01:20:00,748
I don't like to lose.

931
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:04,960
Then you never faced that situation,
faced death?

932
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:07,796
I don't believe in the no-win scenario.

933
01:20:10,842 --> 01:20:12,885
Kirk to Spock. It's two hours.
Are you ready?

934
01:20:12,969 --> 01:20:14,303
Right on schedule, Admiral.

935
01:20:14,387 --> 01:20:16,931
Just give us your coordinates
and we'll beam you aboard.

936
01:20:17,015 --> 01:20:18,349
All right.

937
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:23,646
I don't like to lose.

938
01:20:24,522 --> 01:20:28,275
...report, we were immobilized.
Captain Spock said it'd be two days.

939
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:31,612
Come, come, Lieutenant.
You of all people go by the book. Spock!

940
01:20:32,072 --> 01:20:33,364
- You know Dr. Marcus.
- Why, of course.

941
01:20:33,448 --> 01:20:35,783
- Hello, Mr. Spock.
- I'm taking this bunch to Sickbay.

942
01:20:35,867 --> 01:20:38,035
- By the book?
- By the book.

943
01:20:38,954 --> 01:20:42,414
Regulation 46A. "If transmissions
are being monitored during battle...

944
01:20:42,999 --> 01:20:45,751
"No un-coded messages
on an open channel."

945
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:51,673
- You lied.
- I exaggerated.

946
01:20:51,758 --> 01:20:55,511
Hours instead of days.
Now we have minutes instead of hours.

947
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:03,393
- They're inoperative below C-Deck.
- What is working around here?

948
01:21:03,478 --> 01:21:05,521
Not much, Admiral.
We have partial main power.

949
01:21:05,605 --> 01:21:07,981
- That's it?
- Best we could do in two hours.

950
01:21:38,262 --> 01:21:40,972
- Admiral on the Bridge.
- Battle stations.

951
01:21:42,975 --> 01:21:44,267
Tactical.

952
01:21:50,316 --> 01:21:52,984
She can still outrun us and outgun us,

953
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:56,905
but there is the Mutara Nebula
at 1-5-3 mark 4.

954
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,740
Scotty, can we make it inside?

955
01:21:58,825 --> 01:22:00,867
The energizer's bypassed
like a Christmas tree,

956
01:22:00,952 --> 01:22:02,536
so don't give me too many bumps.

957
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:04,663
No promises. On your way.

958
01:22:04,914 --> 01:22:06,414
Trouble with the nebula, sir,

959
01:22:06,499 --> 01:22:10,252
is all that static discharge and gas
clouds our tactical display.

960
01:22:10,336 --> 01:22:13,547
Visual won't function
and shields will be useless.

961
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:16,883
Sauce for the goose, Mr. Saavik.

962
01:22:18,594 --> 01:22:20,011
The odds will be even.

963
01:23:06,559 --> 01:23:10,103
There she is. There she is.

964
01:23:13,649 --> 01:23:16,401
Not so wounded
as we were led to believe.

965
01:23:17,528 --> 01:23:18,945
So much the better.

966
01:23:44,305 --> 01:23:48,433
Estimating nebula penetration
in 2.2 minutes.

967
01:23:50,478 --> 01:23:52,228
Reliant is closing.

968
01:24:01,948 --> 01:24:04,574
If they go in there, we'll lose them.

969
01:24:05,117 --> 01:24:06,826
Explain it to them.

970
01:24:17,046 --> 01:24:18,588
That was close.

971
01:24:19,465 --> 01:24:21,090
They just don't want us going in there.

972
01:24:21,341 --> 01:24:25,928
Admiral, what happens if Reliant
fails to follow us into the nebula?

973
01:24:26,472 --> 01:24:29,474
I think we can guarantee
that she'll follow us, Lieutenant.

974
01:24:29,808 --> 01:24:33,186
Remind me to explain to you,
the concept of the human ego.

975
01:24:35,814 --> 01:24:37,023
Best speed, Scotty.

976
01:24:44,823 --> 01:24:46,365
One minute to nebula perimeter.

977
01:24:47,076 --> 01:24:48,826
Why are we slowing?

978
01:24:49,912 --> 01:24:54,248
Daren't follow them into the nebula, sir.
Our shields would be useless.

979
01:24:58,295 --> 01:25:01,297
- They are reducing speed.
- Uhura, patch me in.

980
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:04,258
Aye, sir. You're on, Admiral.

981
01:25:06,386 --> 01:25:07,845
This is Admiral Kirk.

982
01:25:07,929 --> 01:25:11,140
We tried it once your way, Khan.
Are you game for a rematch?

983
01:25:13,143 --> 01:25:17,897
Khan, I'm laughing
at the superior intellect.

984
01:25:20,317 --> 01:25:23,903
- Full impulse power.
- No, sir.

985
01:25:24,321 --> 01:25:27,114
You have Genesis.
You can have whatever you...

986
01:25:27,324 --> 01:25:29,825
Full power! Damn you!

987
01:25:36,124 --> 01:25:38,834
I'll say this for him, he's consistent.

988
01:25:40,003 --> 01:25:42,755
We are now entering
the Mutara Nebula.

989
01:25:51,681 --> 01:25:53,349
Emergency lights.

990
01:26:23,463 --> 01:26:24,713
Tactical.

991
01:26:26,716 --> 01:26:28,133
Inoperative.

992
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:33,222
Raise the shields.

993
01:26:34,266 --> 01:26:38,310
As I feared, sir, not functional.
I'm reducing speed.

994
01:27:21,062 --> 01:27:22,438
Target, sir.

995
01:27:22,605 --> 01:27:26,817
- Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
- Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.

996
01:27:35,493 --> 01:27:37,286
Aft torpedoes, fire!

997
01:27:46,129 --> 01:27:47,755
Hold your course.

998
01:28:10,653 --> 01:28:11,653
Evasive starboard!

999
01:28:22,749 --> 01:28:23,749
Fire!

1000
01:28:45,814 --> 01:28:47,439
Damage, Mr. Scott?

1001
01:28:49,275 --> 01:28:53,112
Admiral, I've got to take
the mains off the line.

1002
01:28:53,488 --> 01:28:56,031
- It's the radiation...
- Scotty.

1003
01:28:57,158 --> 01:28:58,367
Joachim!

1004
01:29:00,036 --> 01:29:04,998
Yours is superior...

1005
01:29:13,341 --> 01:29:14,550
I shall avenge you.

1006
01:29:24,936 --> 01:29:27,646
Could you use another hand, Admiral?

1007
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:30,190
Man the weapons console, Mr. Chekov.

1008
01:29:35,405 --> 01:29:38,157
- Spock.
- Sporadic energy readings.

1009
01:29:38,241 --> 01:29:40,993
Port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.

1010
01:29:43,037 --> 01:29:44,913
He won't break off now.

1011
01:29:46,499 --> 01:29:49,209
He followed me this far, he'll be back.

1012
01:29:51,004 --> 01:29:52,546
But from where?

1013
01:29:53,673 --> 01:29:56,341
He's intelligent but not experienced.

1014
01:29:57,302 --> 01:30:00,387
His pattern indicates
two-dimensional thinking.

1015
01:30:07,395 --> 01:30:09,480
- Full stop.
- Full stop, sir.

1016
01:30:11,774 --> 01:30:14,943
Z-minus 10,000 meters.
Stand by photon torpedoes.

1017
01:31:08,206 --> 01:31:09,998
Torpedoes ready, sir.

1018
01:31:20,843 --> 01:31:22,177
Look sharp.

1019
01:31:26,015 --> 01:31:26,682
Fire!

1020
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:35,023
Fire!

1021
01:32:08,182 --> 01:32:13,854
Uhura, send to Commander Reliant,
"Prepare to be boarded."

1022
01:32:13,938 --> 01:32:15,230
Aye, sir.

1023
01:32:16,566 --> 01:32:18,942
Commander Reliant, this is Enterprise.

1024
01:32:19,777 --> 01:32:22,321
Surrender and prepare to be boarded.

1025
01:32:22,905 --> 01:32:27,326
Enterprise to Reliant. You are ordered
to surrender your vessel. Respond.

1026
01:32:39,088 --> 01:32:41,006
Reliant, come in, Reliant.

1027
01:32:42,091 --> 01:32:44,676
You are ordered
to surrender your vessel.

1028
01:32:45,011 --> 01:32:49,431
Enterprise to Reliant. You are ordered
to surrender your vessel. Respond.

1029
01:33:04,781 --> 01:33:06,031
No, Kirk.

1030
01:33:07,575 --> 01:33:09,326
The game's not over.

1031
01:33:46,072 --> 01:33:49,908
"To the last I will grapple with thee."

1032
01:34:04,215 --> 01:34:08,218
Admiral, scanning an energy source
on Reliant,

1033
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:11,847
a pattern I've never seen before.

1034
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,688
- It's the Genesis wave.
- What?

1035
01:34:19,939 --> 01:34:22,482
They're on a build-up to detonation.

1036
01:34:23,818 --> 01:34:26,319
- How soon?
- We encoded four minutes.

1037
01:34:26,863 --> 01:34:29,698
- We'll beam aboard and stop it.
- You can't.

1038
01:34:32,702 --> 01:34:36,538
Scotty, I need warp speed
in three minutes or we're all dead.

1039
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:40,751
- No response, Admiral.
- Scotty!

1040
01:34:41,002 --> 01:34:43,628
Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Best possible speed.

1041
01:34:43,713 --> 01:34:44,963
Aye, sir.

1042
01:35:23,544 --> 01:35:25,587
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

1043
01:35:25,671 --> 01:35:28,131
No human can tolerate
the radiation that's in there.

1044
01:35:28,257 --> 01:35:31,760
As you are so fond of observing,
Doctor, I am not human.

1045
01:35:33,221 --> 01:35:35,263
You're not going in there.

1046
01:35:36,724 --> 01:35:40,018
Perhaps you're right.
What is Mr. Scott's condition?

1047
01:35:41,938 --> 01:35:43,814
Well, I don't think that he...

1048
01:35:43,898 --> 01:35:47,609
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I have no time to discuss this logically.

1049
01:35:51,864 --> 01:35:53,114
Remember.

1050
01:36:02,792 --> 01:36:05,001
Spock! Get out of there!

1051
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:06,962
Spock!

1052
01:36:07,129 --> 01:36:08,839
Spock! Get out of there!

1053
01:36:20,184 --> 01:36:23,144
- Time from my mark?
- Two minutes, 10 seconds.

1054
01:36:23,813 --> 01:36:26,314
Engine Room, what's happening?

1055
01:36:26,482 --> 01:36:28,191
Spock!

1056
01:36:28,693 --> 01:36:31,736
- Spock! Get out of there!
- Good God, man, get out of there!

1057
01:36:31,821 --> 01:36:35,323
- No! Don't! Don't!
- Spock! Spock!

1058
01:37:05,521 --> 01:37:06,605
Time?

1059
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:10,734
Three minutes, 30 seconds.

1060
01:37:16,449 --> 01:37:19,910
- Distance from Reliant?
- 4,000 kilometers.

1061
01:37:20,202 --> 01:37:22,704
We're not gonna make it, are we?

1062
01:37:34,717 --> 01:37:35,759
No.

1063
01:37:37,762 --> 01:37:39,679
No, you can't get away.

1064
01:37:42,725 --> 01:37:46,645
"From hell's heart I stab at thee.

1065
01:37:48,856 --> 01:37:55,695
"For hate's sake
I spit my last breath at thee."

1066
01:38:08,751 --> 01:38:12,587
- Sir, the mains are back online.
- Bless you, Scotty. Go, Sulu!

1067
01:38:56,382 --> 01:38:58,425
My God, Carol. Look at it.

1068
01:39:10,521 --> 01:39:14,149
Engine Room. Well done, Scotty.

1069
01:39:15,609 --> 01:39:19,154
Jim, I think you'd better get down here.

1070
01:39:20,656 --> 01:39:23,825
- Bones?
- Better hurry.

1071
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:29,664
Saavik, take the conn.

1072
01:39:58,027 --> 01:40:00,528
No! You'll flood the whole compartment.

1073
01:40:00,613 --> 01:40:03,281
- He'll die.
- Sir, he's dead already.

1074
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:09,621
It's too late.

1075
01:40:32,394 --> 01:40:33,561
Spock!

1076
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:07,762
Ship out of danger?

1077
01:41:09,974 --> 01:41:11,057
Yes.

1078
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:16,604
Don't grieve, Admiral.

1079
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:21,151
It is logical.

1080
01:41:24,697 --> 01:41:27,949
The needs of the many outweigh...

1081
01:41:30,327 --> 01:41:34,122
- The needs of the few.
- Or the one.

1082
01:41:43,799 --> 01:41:47,719
I never took the Kobayashi Maru test.

1083
01:41:49,471 --> 01:41:50,805
Until now.

1084
01:41:53,184 --> 01:41:55,602
What do you think of my solution?

1085
01:41:58,439 --> 01:41:59,606
Spock.

1086
01:42:11,493 --> 01:42:16,998
I have been, and always shall be,
your friend.

1087
01:42:23,339 --> 01:42:27,342
Live long and prosper.

1088
01:42:49,657 --> 01:42:50,698
No.

1089
01:43:10,928 --> 01:43:13,346
We are assembled here today

1090
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:16,474
to pay final respects
to our honored dead.

1091
01:43:23,107 --> 01:43:26,859
And yet it should be noted that,
in the midst of our sorrow,

1092
01:43:27,111 --> 01:43:30,280
this death takes place
in the shadow of new life,

1093
01:43:30,572 --> 01:43:32,657
the sunrise of a new world,

1094
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:37,453
a world that our beloved comrade
gave his life to protect and nourish.

1095
01:43:38,414 --> 01:43:41,624
He did not feel this sacrifice
a vain or empty one,

1096
01:43:42,668 --> 01:43:45,795
and we will not debate his profound
wisdom at these proceedings.

1097
01:43:49,341 --> 01:43:51,759
Of my friend, I can only say this.

1098
01:43:57,099 --> 01:44:00,268
Of all the souls I have
encountered in my travels,

1099
01:44:01,395 --> 01:44:03,104
his was the most

1100
01:44:06,775 --> 01:44:08,067
human.

1101
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:11,779
Honors!

1102
01:45:36,448 --> 01:45:37,532
Come.

1103
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,079
I don't mean to intrude.

1104
01:45:44,081 --> 01:45:47,583
No, not at all. I should be on the Bridge.

1105
01:45:49,711 --> 01:45:52,046
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1106
01:45:52,297 --> 01:45:53,965
I poured myself a drink.
Would you like it?

1107
01:45:54,049 --> 01:45:56,175
Lieutenant Saavik was right.

1108
01:45:58,387 --> 01:46:00,555
You never have faced death.

1109
01:46:09,815 --> 01:46:11,482
No, not like this.

1110
01:46:14,403 --> 01:46:17,530
I haven't faced death.
I've cheated death.

1111
01:46:21,285 --> 01:46:23,619
I've tricked my way out of death

1112
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:27,123
and patted myself on the back
for my ingenuity.

1113
01:46:31,253 --> 01:46:32,378
I know nothing.

1114
01:46:32,463 --> 01:46:35,006
You knew enough to tell Saavik
that how we face death

1115
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:37,717
is at least as important
as how we face life.

1116
01:46:40,137 --> 01:46:42,597
- Just words.
- But good words.

1117
01:46:44,558 --> 01:46:48,519
That's where ideas begin.
Maybe you should listen to them.

1118
01:46:52,024 --> 01:46:56,277
I was wrong about you and I'm sorry.

1119
01:47:00,491 --> 01:47:04,410
- Is that what you came here to say?
- Mainly.

1120
01:47:11,710 --> 01:47:15,671
And also that I'm proud,

1121
01:47:18,091 --> 01:47:21,469
very proud to be your son.

1122
01:47:51,333 --> 01:47:54,669
Captain's Log, Stardate 8141.6.

1123
01:47:55,212 --> 01:47:57,713
Starship Enterprise
departing for Ceti Alpha V

1124
01:47:57,798 --> 01:48:00,383
to pick up the crew of U.S.S. Reliant.

1125
01:48:01,552 --> 01:48:02,969
All is well.

1126
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,682
And yet, I can't help wondering
about the friend I leave behind.

1127
01:48:09,351 --> 01:48:12,270
"There are always possibilities,"
Spock said.

1128
01:48:12,938 --> 01:48:16,691
And if Genesis is indeed life from death,

1129
01:48:18,485 --> 01:48:20,903
I must return to this place again.

1130
01:48:25,701 --> 01:48:30,538
He's really not dead,
as long as we remember him.

1131
01:48:37,129 --> 01:48:41,090
"It's a far, far better thing I do
than I have ever done before.

1132
01:48:44,094 --> 01:48:48,889
"A far better resting place I go to

1133
01:48:49,766 --> 01:48:51,100
"than I have ever known."

1134
01:48:51,852 --> 01:48:53,394
Is that a poem?

1135
01:48:55,897 --> 01:48:59,233
Something Spock was trying
to tell me on my birthday.

1136
01:49:00,235 --> 01:49:03,529
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

1137
01:49:07,075 --> 01:49:08,242
Young.

1138
01:49:12,497 --> 01:49:13,956
I feel young.

1139
01:50:26,863 --> 01:50:29,740
Space, the final frontier.

1140
01:50:30,909 --> 01:50:36,497
These are the continuing voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

1141
01:50:37,999 --> 01:50:43,254
Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,

1142
01:50:44,548 --> 01:50:49,218
to seek out new life forms
and new civilizations,

1143
01:50:50,387 --> 01:50:56,183
to boldly go
where no man has gone before.
