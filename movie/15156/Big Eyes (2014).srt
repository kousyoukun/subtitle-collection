00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,700
North Beach is 30 miles,
might as well be 300.

734
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,700
Well, you're probably busy hanging out
with all your new rich buddies.

735
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,580
Please. Those are Walter's friends.
He brings people by.

736
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,580
- The Beach Boys came by.
- Wow.

737
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,820
- Are you hungry?
- I'm thirsty.

738
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,220
When we moved in, I thought that
a wet bar was kind of extravagant,

739
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,100
but you'd be surprised
how much use you can get out of it.

740
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:21,780
- So how is Walter?
- Oh. Well, he couldn't be happier.

741
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,460
He has everything he's ever dreamed of.

742
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,948
And so do you. Fabulous.

743
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,700
Is that your art studio?

744
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,700
Oh. No, you don't wanna go in there.

745
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,180
I wanna take a peek.

746
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,020
I wanna see what the workspace of
a wildly successful artist looks like.

747
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,180
No, no, no. No.

748
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,460
Dee-Ann, please do not go down there.

749
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,745
Look... Look, you can't go in there.

750
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,348
Walter paints here, too.

751
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,665
Is Walter home now?

752
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,191
- What the hell's going on?
- Oh. Nothing. Um...

753
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,146
I just... invited Dee-Ann over
for some...

754
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:15,111
You know I don't like anyone
seeing my work before it's done!

755
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,260
You and your whole
non-representational crowd are frauds!

Get out of my big house!

Go back to selling your coat hanger
sculptures in Fisherman's Wharf!

invited here again.

761
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,990
I won't.

- Good boy. Oh!

Oh! Good boy.
All right, Janie, I'm gonna get to work.

764
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,060
Can I come? No, I can never come.

765
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,547
No, I shouldn't even ask.

766
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,700
Now, how did you get in here? Hm?

767
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:40,269
Didn't you hear?
There are no visitors. <font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font>

This is what it's come to, huh?

769
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,980
You are the only living soul
I can tell my secret to.

770
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:52,940
Well... I painted them.

771
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,780
I did. Every single one of them.

772
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,824
Every big eye. Me.

773
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,622
And no one will ever know but you.

774
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,940
And I'm gonna paint
another one right now.

775
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:11,351
To tick Walter off, maybe I'll paint one
about a crazy girl talking to a dog.

- I had a productive day today.

777
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,380
Stumbled onto some hot gossip.

778
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,507
Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming
to town, straight from Taipei.

779
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,820
I think we should present her
with a painting.

780
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,060
Get Dick to flack it.

781
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,020
Or the hell with Dick.
I met a new guy at UPI.

782
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,860
Maybe, uh... she'd like one
of your street scenes.

783
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,460
Yeah, I don't know. I thought you could
whip off a doodle of Chinatown.

784
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,745
With a cute little girl,
sort of a big-eyed, slanty-eyed thing.

785
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,740
No.

786
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,740
No, no. She is a dignitary,
and she deserves a piece

787
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,624
that comes straight from you.

788
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,500
- You think?
- Uh-huh.

789
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,980
Maybe you're right.

790
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,460
She probably doesn't have a Parisian
street scene hanging in her palace.

791
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,028
Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek
already has a Cenic.

792
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,660
- What's that?
- A Cenic.

793
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,751
That's the painter that painted
all your early work.

794
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,350
<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font>

795
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,500
It's Scenic!

796
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,980
That's my nickname in Paris!

797
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,260
All my art school pals
loved my scenic views so much,

798
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,660
they called me... well,
they couldn't pronounce it properly,

799
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,780
so they called me "Cenic."

800
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,824
The more you lie, the smaller you seem.

801
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,980
How dare you accuse me of lying!
I'm proud of my early Cenics!

802
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,660
Then why did you paint over the name?

803
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,780
A piece of advice,
never use water-based over an oil.

804
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,550
It'll just fleck right off.

805
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:13,342
You sound crazy!
For God's sake, you've seen me paint!

806
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,824
No, I haven't.

807
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,740
I always thought that I had,
but it's like a mirage.

808
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,547
From a distance,
you look like a painter,

809
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,471
but up close there's
just not much there.

810
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,220
I've been to Paris!
I studied at the Beaux-Arts!

811
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,580
At the Grand Chaumiere!

812
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,260
I spent hours and hours in the Louvre,

813
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,340
staring at the greatness of the masters!

814
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,190
Walter...

815
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,546
have you even been to Paris?

816
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,980
I wanted...
I so wanted to become an artist.

817
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,104
It just never turned out so well.

818
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,180
I don't want you
sleeping here any longer.

819
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,544
There are three extra bedrooms
in this house. Go pick one.

820
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,380
How many more of these are in the back?

821
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,860
- I don't know. Um, maybe 3,000 or so.
- Does the printer owe us more?

822
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,620
Excuse me, miss.
How much is this painting?

823
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,220
- Go! What do I pay you for?
- Yes, Mr. Keane.

824
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,751
Sorry about that...

825
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,621
It's not even one of mine.
It's one of hers.

826
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,828
This doesn't change anything.

827
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,940
- I know the truth.
- Who cares?

828
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,540
Maybe it's time to shake things up.

829
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,420
- Start putting my name on the MDHs.
- No!

830
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:34,020
Absolutely not! I already hate myself
for giving you the waifs.

831
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,820
Quiet! Don't raise your voice!

832
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,020
Oh, I will talk as loud as I want.

833
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,941
No, you won't! Or I'll have you whacked!

834
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,620
What?

835
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,900
If you tell anyone,
I'll have you taken out!

836
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,344
I know people. Remember Banducci's
cousin? The liquor wholesaler?

837
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,100
Are you threatening me?

838
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,980
Fine, kill me!

839
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,700
My God, I have kept
our secret for years.

840
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,709
Never once have I...

841
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,349
Do you know how hard
this has been for me?

842
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,260
I don't have any friends.

843
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,669
I've lied to my own child.

844
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,065
Life imitating art... a crying Keane!

845
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,348
Walter, what do you want?

846
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,540
Everything with you is calculated.

847
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,108
We're back where we had our first date.

848
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:46,869
Look, I don't deny I need you.
You're the one with the gift.

849
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,380
Now, there's a shot...

850
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,420
Oh, God, I'm shaking I'm so excited.

851
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,180
The New York World's Fair.

852
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,860
Seventy million visitors.
Opening day, I unveil my masterpiece!

853
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,701
- What masterpiece?
- Exactly!

854
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,020
What have we been missing all this time?

855
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,740
Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa,
Renoir has his Boatmen's Lunch.

856
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,180
Where's my defining statement?

857
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,340
You sound insane.

858
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,660
An artist doesn't
just announce his masterpiece.

859
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,220
Why not? Didn't Michelangelo
know he was hitting a home run

860
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,420
when he was on his back
painting the Sistine Chapel?

861
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,020
That took him four years.

862
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,620
But here's the best part.

863
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,231
It's for UNICEF.

864
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,820
UNICEF sponsors the Hall of Education.

865
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,469
We can finally give back
to the children of the world.

866
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,460
Hello, everybody

867
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:50,340
I'm Lowell Thomas, standing in front
of what will soon be

868
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,225
one of the wonders of the modern world.

869
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,580
<font color="#808080">DICK</font>: When people ask me,
"Why did she stay?

870
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,147
Was it fear? Lack of confidence?"

871
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,340
Margaret was trapped
in a lie that she'd helped create.

872
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,781
And now the cover-up
was worse than the crime.

873
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,980
Why did you have
to promise them Cinerama size?

874
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:29,460
Because it has to encompass
all children, all races.

875
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,980
Hundreds of stricken faces,
marching to infinity.

876
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,500
The ultimate Walter Keane.

A publisher says it's good timing
to put out a coffee table book.

You know, classy, Tomorrow's Masters.

879
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,220
They need my early portfolio,
my artistic evolution.

880
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,100
Yes, where are all
of your preliminary sketches? Hm?

881
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,340
All of that time
that you spent in art school,

882
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,340
and we seem to have waylaid
all of your youthful experiments.

883
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,386
All of those unfinished charcoals.
They've gotta be around here somewhere.

that our newspapers published statements
aware of probable falsity.

And regardless of the truth,
Mrs. Keane has contributed

immeasurably to the confusion.

01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:13,540
and the other one
a delightful bon vivant.

1183
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,540
Well, that's you, Walter.
You're Jekyll and Hyde.

1184
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,340
That's an outrageous statement!

1185
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,980
- I demand we strike it off the record!
- Overruled!

1186
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,620
No, you were outrageous,

1187
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,020
constantly criticizing me,
wearing me down,

1188
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,500
saying that you would have me
knocked off if I told the truth.

1189
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,589
- Well, I am telling the truth.
- Your Honor!

1190
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,420
- I ask for mistrial.
- You're a liar!

1191
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,700
You don't even know what the truth is!

1192
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,900
You don't even know I'm saying the truth
now, and you cannot shut me up!

1193
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,020
Hey, hey, hey!
This is not a domestic squabble!

1194
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,460
Or maybe it is.

1195
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,710
But the rest of us have no interest
in watching you two go at it.

1196
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,904
I'm sorry for my emotion.

1197
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,830
I'm an artist.

1198
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,860
Maybe.

1199
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,980
Your Honor, I call as my witness

1200
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:14,185
Mr. Walter Stanley Keane.

1201
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,860
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1202
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:23,020
- and nothing but the truth...
- Yes.

1203
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,541
- ...so help you God?
- Yes.

1204
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,780
Mr. Keane, there seems
to be a lot of innuendo

1205
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:42,900
and contradictory testimony
about the genesis of the big-eyed waifs.

1206
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,660
Would you mind clarifying to this court

1207
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:49,750
who spawned these paintings?

1208
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:57,031
Why, I created these children.

1209

1210
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:04,190
The choreography is not necessary.
Just sit down and testify.

1211
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,460
I had a wonderful life.

1212
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,460
I was an artist,

1213
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:20,860
a friend of untold celebrities.

1214
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:24,030
Yet, when I look back at it all,

1215
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,060
to define what really mattered,

1216
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:31,902
it was that I was dedicated
to the hungry children of the world.

1217
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,620
It all began in... in Berlin.

1218
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,820
After World War II.

1219
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,380
The orphans...

1220
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,900
clutching the barbed wire.

1221
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,060
Their bodies lacerated.

1222
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,220
Their fingers scrawny,

1223
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,741
their eyes big.

1224
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:59,900
- Miss Joan Crawford walked up...
- Mr. Keane. Sit down.

1225
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,980
Marilyn Monroe...

1226
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,940
Wayne Newton and I...

1227
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,740
Jerry Lewis calls me and says,
"I want you to paint me

1228
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,500
and my family in clown suits."

1229
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:13,180
Miss Natalie Wood walked up to me
and said,

1230
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:17,020
"This is the greatest single painting

1231
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,740
I've ever seen in my entire life!"

1232
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,940
- You're done!
- I'm not finished.

1233
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,220
Actually, you are.

1234
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,260
I cannot stomach one more wild tangent
or shaggy dog tale.

1235
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,340
You're not testifying,
you're filibustering.

1236
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:29,980
Federal courts are overburdened enough

1237
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,180
without all your
docket-clogging nonsense.

1238
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:35,220
We can stay here
until we grow old and die,

1239
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,980
but it's obvious that
this case boils down

1240
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,540
to your word versus Mrs. Keane's word.

1241
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,903
- Mistrial.
- No, it's not a mistrial!

1242
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,628
In my opinion, there's only one way
to clear this thing up.

1243
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,862
You're both going to paint.

1244
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:58,710
All right, bring those easels down,
set them up on both sides of the bench.

1245
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:15,260
Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece.
I don't know much about these things.

1246
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:19,380
I'm a jurist, not an art critic.
But is one hour enough?

1247
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,230
Yes, Your Honor.

1248
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:29,300
Okay, then. You've both been provided
with identical supplies.

1249
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:34,028
So, without any further business,
Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours.

1250
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,306
Mr. Keane?

1251
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,110
I'm just setting the mood.

1252
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:51,544
Waiting for the muse to strike.

1253
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:55,226
Well, your muse has 58 minutes.

Mr. Keane? Are you all right?

1257
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,700
Oh, shit.

1258

<font color="#D900D9">(EXHALES)</font> My old shoulder injury
just flared up.

1259

I have, um, um... bad muscles.

1260
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:40,623
It's... I've been taking medication
for the inflammation.

1261
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,945

I don't think I'll
be able to paint today.

1264
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:20,060
The jury found in favor
of Margaret Keane on all points.

1265
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,260
She won on charges of defamation,
emotional distress,

1266
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,060
and damaged reputation.

- <font color="#808080">MAN</font>: Congratulations!
- <font color="#808080">WOMAN</font>: Congratulations, Margaret!

- <font color="#808080">WOMAN</font>: Congratulations!

1269
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,750
Margaret, what are you going
to call the painting?

- Uh... Exhibit 224.

have your autograph?

her daughter and her paintings.

1273

And after all the crazy turns
the story took,

1274
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:53,104
she came out at the end
with both of them.
