00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:18,442
Old lady.

14
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:20,446
Well, aren't you sweet.

15
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,752
Excuse me, miss.

16
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:39,422
Ma'am we are
closing for the day.

17
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:44,092
Well could I just use the
ladies room for a minute?

18
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:47,388
Oh, okay, it's
just down the hall.

19
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,556
Oh, thank you hun.

20
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:51,936
You're just so nice, thank you.

21
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:02,446
Hello.

22
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:09,871
Oh, okay I'll be right there.

23
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:11,078
Hey Jim,

24
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,787
I have to pick up my
daughter from daycare,

25
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:14,289
they close early today.

26
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,375
I'll see ya tomorrow.

27
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:19,671
All right, see
you in the morning.

28
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:33,268
Excuse me.

29
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,103
I'm sorry ma'am but we're
about to close for the day,

30
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,646
I'm just about to leave.

31
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:41,942
If you could just talk
me for just a few minutes,

32
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:43,904
I'd really appreciate it.

33
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:47,406
Okay, I only have a second.

34
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:49,866
Is this about a new
policy or an existing one?

35
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:53,120
I'm sure there must be
something nice about you,

36
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:56,458
but I just heard
you're really selfish

37
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:59,796
and a manipulative bastard.

38
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,253
Pardon me.

39
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:06,549
You have done bad, bad
things to my friend Bobby.

40
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:08,718
Listen lady, I don't
what your deal is

41
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,347
but I'm gonna have
to call the police.

42
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:12,597
Oh no you're not.

43
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,431
No you're not.

44
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:14,724
Put that phone down.

45
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:16,811
We're not done here yet.

46
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:18,314

You have a beautiful
voice sweetie,

60
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:18,164
you could have been
bigger than Tammy.

61
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,623
Thanks, Virginia.

62
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,292
You are so modest,
you know you can sing.

63
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:24,712
You should do it again Mimi.

64
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:29,174
Oh Virginia, don't be
silly, I'm too old to do that.

65
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:31,301
Besides who'd come and see me.

66
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:32,595
Us.

67
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:35,347
And maybe we could
meet some nice men.

68
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:38,392
Oh, there aren't any nice men.

69
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:40,102
Oh Coralee.

70
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:41,811
- No, no, no.
- Yes there are.

71
00:05:41,813 --> 00:05:44,023
They're just not
interested in us.

72
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:47,150
Most of the men we've
known are in the cemetery

73
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:48,695
or in a nursing home.

74
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:54,450
Well we'd still come to see
you, and my daughter Ava too.

75
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:56,785
Yeah, your daughter maybe.

76
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:59,037
Is Lisa still
not talking to you?

77
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,289
Nope.

78
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,794
Oh, what's wrong
with kids these days?

79
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:05,835
Where is that Bobby?

80
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:08,297
We have to get started
on our rummy game,

81
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:10,508
it's not like her to be late.

82
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:13,553
Maybe that's Bobby now.

83
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:16,847
Bobby, where have you been?

84
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,181
What?

85
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:19,140
What's the matter?

86
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:20,100
Oh Mimi.

87
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:21,393
Oh sweetheart.

88
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:27,400
Bobby, what's the matter?

89
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:30,570
We were so worried about you.

90
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,907
Well, my ex-son-in-law
James, Jim,

91
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,619
the guy who owns my house,

92
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:40,371
he's trying to force me out.

93
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:41,330
What?

94
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,623
Can he do that?

95
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,458
How in the world
did that happen?

96
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,421
Before Amy passed away.

97
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:50,338
Oh sweetheart,
we all miss her.

98
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,674
I signed my house over to Amy,

99
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:56,511
in a trust, while she
was still married to Jim.

100
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:59,515
The agreement was that
she would keep the house

101
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:03,604
but as long as I was still
alive, I could stay there.

102
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:09,736
I didn't realize that she
signed everything over to Jim.

103
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:15,448
And now that Amy's
gone, he wants me out.

104
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,241
Oh, that son of a bitch.

105
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:21,412
That was just a few months
ago, you are still grieving.

106
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:23,748
Do you want a
piece of pie, Bobby?

107
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,087
Yes Virginia, I would
like a piece of pie.

108
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:31,049
Here you go.

109
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,967
You know what, this
just dills my pickle.

110
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:39,597
I mean, you just lost your
daughter, just a few months ago,

111
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,265
and now this.

112
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:44,727
Nobody deserves
that kind of luck.

113
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,563
Especially you Bobby.

114
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:49,775
Girls.

115
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:55,864
We gotta do
something about this.

116
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:58,075
This is really good pie.

117
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:01,785
So, there you have it.

118
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:03,453
Now you do what's
right for Bobby,

119
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:06,582
so she doesn't end
up on the street.

120
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:07,917
Now listen lady,

121
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,835
you're gonna be in a
great deal of trouble

122
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,503
for holding me at gunpoint.

123
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:12,546
There isn't any way around it.

124
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:14,547
You should worry
about yourself.

125
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:17,717
You know, when Father Time's
breathing down your neck

126
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:20,388
and you don't have
much left to lose,

127
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,558
you can become a very
dangerous person.

128
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:28,186
But I never took
nothing from you.

129
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,479
What'd you say your name was?

130
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:30,438
It don't matter
what my name is.

131
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,773
This is about Bobby.

132
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:33,566
Now I want you to give
her, her house back.

133
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:36,236
Bobby is a terrible person.

134
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:38,741
She was a lousy mother-in-law.

135
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:43,536
Mother-in-law's are
supposed to be lousy,

136
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:45,955
that doesn't change
a damn thing.

137
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:48,832
Now, I want you to give
her her house back.

138
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:49,667
Okay.

139
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,002
Okay, you win.

140
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:54,213
Just need to get the paperwork
out of that file cabinet

141
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:55,630
and then I'll make it happen.

142
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:56,466
Well.

143
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:58,051
Okay.

144
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:08,768
Hold it.

145
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,812
You might have a gun
stashed in there.

146
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:12,398
Nice try old binny.

147
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,566
- Oh no!
- But it's over.

148
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:24,909
Oh.

149
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:26,037
Oh God.

150
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,412
Oh God.

151
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:28,580
Oh.

152
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:29,831
Oh no.

153
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,337
Oh Jesus, Jesus
help me, help me.

154
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:34,339
Oh.

155
00:09:35,798 --> 00:09:40,634
I didn't mean for you to
die, but you did deserve it.

156
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:42,762
And I don't know if
there is a hereafter,

157
00:09:42,764 --> 00:09:44,095
but if there is,

158
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:47,724
I hope your ex-wife is
up there kicking your ass

159
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:51,856
for screwing over her mother
with your dirty dealings.

160
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:07,954
Hello?

161
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,913
Oh Coralee, get yourselves
over here right away.

162
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:11,666
Things have gotten
all screwed up.

163
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:13,709
The son of a bitch,
what is he doing?

164
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:15,380
He's not co-operating?

165
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:18,630
Oh it's way beyond that.

166
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:19,965
Like how?

167
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:23,094
Well, he's kind
of, sort of, dead.

168
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:24,177
What do you mean?

169
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:25,595
He can't be sort of dead.

170
00:10:25,597 --> 00:10:27,181
He's either dead or he ain't.

171
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:29,724
Well if you put
that way then I guess,

172
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:31,143
I guess he's dead.

173
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:32,644
So get your butts over here,

174
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:34,604
right now so we can
get rid of the body.

175
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:38,526
Oh and bring some
cleaning supplies, bye.

176
00:10:44,826 --> 00:11:02,050
Oh thank goodness you're
here, come here, quick.

177
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,676
Well he sure ain't
playing possum.

178
00:11:04,678 --> 00:11:07,220
Well of course not
Coralee, he's dead.

179
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:08,556
He shot himself.

180
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:10,016
He committed suicide?

181
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:13,728
No, he sort of
accidentally shot himself.

182
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,936
He had a gun?

183
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:18,148
No, Virginia it was my gun.

184
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,734
I don't get it.

185
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:22,777
Bobby, there's no
time to explain, okay.

186
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,946
We just, we gotta
get rid of the body.

187
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:26,489
Get rid of it where?

188
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:28,075
Anywhere but here.

189
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,576
He wasn't the best son-in-law,

190
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:31,162
but I didn't wish
him to be dead.

191
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:32,412
Mm hmm.

192
00:11:32,414 --> 00:11:34,790
But a dead man, is a good man.

193
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,917
Coralee stop talking.

194
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,752
What?

195
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:39,586
We gotta get rid of this body.

196
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:41,422
Oh, this is gonna
be a disaster.

197
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:43,965
We are gonna be in so much
trouble, so much trouble.

198
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:47,470
Bobby will you stop whining
and just let me think.

199
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:49,388
Oh here we go again.

200
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,808
Dammit, you're as much
trouble dead as he was alive.

201
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,187
Wait, maybe we can put
him in this office chair

202
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,605
and wheel him out.

203
00:11:58,607 --> 00:11:59,440
Get over here.

204
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,316
That is a good idea.

205
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:01,399
Okay.

206
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:02,902
Help me with this chair.

207
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:05,321
You girls get ready.

208
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:06,571
Wooh.

209
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:09,157
Okay, one, two, three.

210
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,205
Good job, good
job girls, good job.

211
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,666
- Oh my goodness.
- Get his legs, get his legs.

212
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,667
Here wait a minute.

213
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:21,336
Okay, now let's get
him out of here.

214
00:12:21,338 --> 00:12:23,882
Coralee is your butt gonna
fit through that door?

215
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:30,515
Watch your hand Coralee.

216
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:36,143
Oh.

217
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:38,186
Okay Coralee, let's put him
in the backseat of your car,

218
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:41,023
it'll a lot easier than trying
to get him in the trunk.

219
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:42,108
No, no, no, no, no.

220
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,276
Why my car?

221
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,027
I don't want this old
dead gizzard in my car.

222
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:47,363
Shut your trap Coralee.

223
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,989
No, no, he's gonna
bleed all over my stuff...

224
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:54,036
No, no, no, no.

225
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:54,869
Ah, get him!

226
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:55,787
Okay.

227
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,163
Oh my God, going in my car.

228
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:59,082
See if you just be quiet,
let's just get this done.

229
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,627
All right come on, let's
get him in the car.

230
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:02,878
You open it open Virginia.

231
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,007
I'm trying.

232
00:13:05,007 --> 00:13:07,048
Here you go, okay.

233
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,551
Now I'm gonna go around,

234
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:11,097
you push I'll pull.

235
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:14,556
Wait, wait, wait
let me get my purse.

236
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:16,850
Okay, watch his leg there.

237
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:18,020
Okay.

238
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:21,939
Push, push.

239
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:22,981
Move the
chair, move the chair.

240
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,566
I got it Bobby okay.

241
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:25,859
Should I get the door for you?

242
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:28,237
No, no, I got it.

243
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,324
You help them.

244
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:32,282
Don't touch my car.

245
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:35,201
Come on
Virginia, hurry up.

246
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:36,077
Okay.

247
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,370
Do we look okay?

248
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:38,998
Yeah we do.

249
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,008
Are you out of gas?

250
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,843
Pump it, pump it.

251
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:51,676
No, no, no.

252
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:53,597
What'd you do to my car?

253
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,614
What are we gonna do now?

254
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:14,492
Oh Virginia, will you relax.

255
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:17,286
You act like you've never
seen a dead body before.

256
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:20,873
Most everybody we've known
is dead or on their way.

257
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,960
Yeah of natural causes,
but not like this.

258
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,878
Well this was natural.

259
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,007
A bullet went in his chest
and he naturally died.

260
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:31,841
You act like I'm a killer.

261
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:33,386
You are a killer.

262
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:34,887
No, I am not Coralee.

263
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,138
Yes you are, we
gonna go to prison.

264
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,098
He shot himself.

265
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:39,349
Stop it.

266
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:40,685
Well I'm just saying.

267
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:42,228
To be honest Mimi, I am
nervous like a long tailed cat

268
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,604
in a room full of
rocking chairs.

269
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:45,898
I need a drink.

270
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,024
I think we all do come on.

271
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,153
Okay girls.

272
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:54,489
This ought to take the edge off.

273
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:56,032
Let's make a toast.

274
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:57,909
We've got a dead
body in the garage,

275
00:14:57,911 --> 00:14:59,787
what's there to toast?

276
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:01,372
Oh don't be silly Virginia.

277
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:06,127
To us, to many more years
of life and laughter.

278
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:07,545
Amen to that.

279
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:10,049
To that dead son of a bitch.

280
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,969
I have a toast too.

281
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:15,886
Fill her up.

282
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:17,888
Okay, here it comes.

283
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,431
To Mimi.

284
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:22,976
May her daughter start
talking to her again.

285
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:26,730
Well, I'd like to
make a toast to Bobby.

286
00:15:26,732 --> 00:15:28,523
For getting what she deserves

287
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,735
from that greedy,
slickering owl shit bastard

288
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,403
rotting in my garage.

289
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:35,116
Oh say that again.

290
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,244
Oh my.

291
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:41,954
My belly thinks
my throats been cut.

292
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:46,667
I'll fix us something
to eat okay, just relax.

293
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:02,099
Bobby.

294
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:03,893
Don't you feel bad about this.

295
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:05,226
He wouldn't be lying there dead

296
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:06,979
if he'd done the right
thing in the first place.

297
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:09,648
I know but he
was my son-in-law.

298
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,108
Ex.

299
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,401
Son-in-law.

300
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:14,402
Yeah, who was gonna throw
you out on the street.

301
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:18,201
Mimi!

302
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,245
Mimi, Mimi.

303
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:23,579
He's alive.

304
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:24,414
He's alive.

305
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:27,460
Oh, for crying out loud.

306
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:31,088
Mimi, he just.

307
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:34,549
You bitch.

308
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,258
You shot me.

309
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,762
No I didn't,
you shot yourself.

310
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,013
If I shot you, you'd be dead.

311
00:16:42,015 --> 00:16:45,395
But it's never too
late to right a wrong.

312
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:53,817
That ought to do it.

313
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:55,735
Virginia why are you crying?

314
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:56,988
I don't know.

315
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,114
He meant nothing to me.

316
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:02,868
Wait a minute, have you
been chopping onions.

317
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,036
Yes.

318
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:06,330
Well you should've
used a different knife.

319
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:09,457
Oh Virginia, you want me
to run out and buy a knife

320
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,003
before I take care of business?

321
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:14,506
I wish you'd stop complaining.

322
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:28,226
You know, I've been thinking

323
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:32,939
and I don't think we
should dispose of his body.

324
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:34,233
What do you mean?

325
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,150
What the
hell are we gonna do?

326
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:36,068
We can't leave him here.

327
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,153
That would be crazy.

328
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,489
Listen to me.

329
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,784
What I think, we should do,

330
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:48,374
is chop up his body and
leave it in my deep freezer.

331
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,417
Why would you wanna
do something like that?

332
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,753
Because, if he isn't found

333
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:56,546
he's just a missing person.

334
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:58,549
But if we move him somewhere,

335
00:17:58,551 --> 00:18:03,763
and his body is found then
there's a murder investigation.

336
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:08,892
But isn't chopping him
up gonna be be a bit messy?

337
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:11,395
Yes Virginia, that is true.

338
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:15,440
But you see, I've
been watching Dexter.

339
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:17,194
What's a dexter?

340
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:22,990
Because you're
weekends and Wednesdays.

341
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:24,908
Oh I'm not always
weekends and Wednesdays.

342
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,494
This was your decision for me
not to pick him up last week,

343
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:29,371
so it's always
somebody else's fault.

344
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:32,207
- You know what...
- Hey, you keep it up

345
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:33,458
I'm gonna take
him away from you.

346
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,503
Six o'clock tonight
I want him here.

347
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:37,172
- You can't do that.
- Six o'clock.

348
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,224
Thank you.

349
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:52,061
Oh Lisa, I didn't know
you were working here.

350
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:52,897
Hi mama.

351
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:57,065
What did Rick want?

352
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:58,652
What do you care?

353
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:02,405
And what do you need
so much wrap for?

354
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,115
Oh, it's not for me.

355
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:07,368
I'm helping out some friends.

356
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,580
That's good you can
help someone out mama.

357
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:13,581
Lisa, I know you
haven't forgiven me,

358
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,583
for not standing
up for you more,

359
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:17,461
when you were going through
your divorce with Rick,

360
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:20,046
but sweetheart, your
daddy had just died.

361
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:22,632
I could hardly
stand up for myself.

362
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:25,761
It's always someone
else's fault, ain't it.

363
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:26,637
Oh Lisa.

364
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,179
I don't wanna talk about it.

365
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:29,974
Could I just try to explain?

366
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:31,183
No.

367
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:34,227
Could you please just
go in another line.

368
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:35,271
Please.

369
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:37,442
I've got somebody to wait on.

370
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:40,568
Please mom.

371
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,446

381
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:47,301
Ooh yeah.

382
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:52,555
Okay, now Bobby,

383
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:55,559
I didn't want to show
you this last night,

384
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:59,357
but is this the paper
that Jim showed you?

385
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:07,907
Yes.

386
00:21:09,324 --> 00:21:10,325
Yes, yes.

387
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:16,289
Well hopefully this
is the only evidence.

388
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,333
So, I say we burn it

389
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:23,670
and then everything
remains in your name

390
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:28,009
and nobody will ever be
able to figure it out.

391
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:29,260
I get to keep my house.

392
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:30,429
Yes.

393
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:36,309
All right get ready girls.

394
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,976
Look at her.

395
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:40,061
She's gonna do
it, she's really gonna do it.

396
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:42,898
Is she gonna do it?

397
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,527
Come on baby light my fire.

398
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:47,986
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

399
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:49,321
The devil's in the kitchen.

400
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:51,698
Look at
the flame on that.

401
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,617
There we go.

402
00:21:57,873 --> 00:21:58,955
Oh, what are we gonna do?

403
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:02,042
Dammit, that thing
is always doing that.

404
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:03,002
Unbelievable.

405
00:22:03,004 --> 00:22:04,337
We got worried detective.

406
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,670
Jim's car was in the
back parking lot,

407
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:07,590
right where he
left it yesterday.

408
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:10,426
His office door was left
open, which is unusual,

409
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,052
he always locks it
before he leaves.

410
00:22:12,054 --> 00:22:15,348
The front door wasn't locked
and the alarm wasn't set.

411
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,099
We've called his
house several times.

412
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:22,146
It's been almost 24 hours,
so we thought we should call.

413
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:24,940
Darling, I'm glad you did.

414
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:27,109
May I take a look in his office?

415
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:28,653
Yes sir.

416
00:22:56,932 --> 00:23:00,309
There's probably a
logical explanation.

417
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:03,022
Maybe he had a family emergen...

418
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:09,820
Well I'll be.

419
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:12,657
What is it detective?

420
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:18,537
Possibly blood.

421
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:23,874
I'll have forensics
take a looksie.

422
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:25,917
Don't you worry now ma'am,

423
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,506
we'll figure out
what happened to Jim.

424
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:32,465
Does he have any
relatives in town?

425
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:34,342
All his relatives
live out of state,

426
00:23:34,344 --> 00:23:36,012
except for his ex-mother-in-law,

427
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:39,389
though I guess she's not
really a relative.

428
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:41,016
Well, we've gotta
start somewhere.

429
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:41,975
What's her name?

430
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:42,937
It's Bobby.

431
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,125
Well thank you kindly.

432
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:07,167
Thank you.

433
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:08,168
I appreciate it.

434
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,337
Now you be safe.

435
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:10,713
I will indeed.

436
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,505
You call me if you think
of anything else all right?

437
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:13,424
I will.

438
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:36,407
Goodbye sweetheart.

439
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,782
Hey there Bobby, this
years school picture?

440
00:24:38,784 --> 00:24:42,535
Oh my, Ava he
is getting so big.

441
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:43,913
I know, I know.

442
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:44,871
Isn't he cute.

443
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:45,872
He's a great kid,

444
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:47,750
he's doing real
good in school too.

445
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,877
Well that's good to know,
what's his favorite subject?

446
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:50,794
- Bobby.
- He loves math.

447
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:52,881
Bobby, somebody's coming.

448
00:24:58,428 --> 00:25:00,931
Hello ma'am.

449
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:03,558
I'm looking for a Bobby Mcluuu

450
00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:06,226
McClouchesky.

451
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:07,770
That's me.

452
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,606
I'm detective Randy Mclemore,

453
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:12,984
may I ask you a few questions?

454
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:15,403
Sure detective,
you wanna come on in?

455
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:16,779
Not necessary ma'am.

456
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,613
Detective this is
my friend Virginia

457
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:20,866
and her daughter Ava.

458
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:22,493
Pleased to meet
all of you ladies.

459
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:23,785
Detective would you
like something to drink,

460
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:25,161
a cup of sweet tea?

461
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:26,997
No thank you ma'am.

462
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:29,919
It would appear your
ex-son-in-law is missing.

463
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:34,629
Jim's missing?

464
00:25:34,631 --> 00:25:36,840
What do you mean?

465
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:40,427
He disappeared after work,
left his car, everything.

466
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:42,388
Hasn't returned.

467
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,349
Have you been in contact
with him recently?

468
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:46,850
Hmmm.

469
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:47,687
No.

470
00:25:48,603 --> 00:25:51,022
According to his
cell phone records

471
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:56,234
he called you 11 days ago
and spoke for four minutes.

472
00:25:56,236 --> 00:25:59,487
His office receptionist
said that you visited him

473
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:01,742
for about for 20 minutes.

474
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:06,121
Oh, yes actually
I remember now.

475
00:26:08,957 --> 00:26:11,207
Getting old you
know, memory goes.

476
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:15,087
Jim said that he had some
photos with me and my daughter

477
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:18,381
and he thought that
I would want them.

478
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:19,841
May I see those photos?

479
00:26:19,843 --> 00:26:22,594
I don't know where
they're at right now,

480
00:26:22,596 --> 00:26:24,679
I'd have to go look for 'em.

481
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:25,515
Please.

482
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,601
Virginia, would
you come help me?

483
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:30,438
Sure.

484
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,692
Hello ma'am.

485
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:44,742
Okay, okay, what are
we gonna do Virginia?

486
00:26:44,744 --> 00:26:45,993
I don't know.

487
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:47,954
You told him you had pictures,
go get some pictures.

488
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:50,039
All the photos I
have are all framed

489
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,791
and they're in the house,
I can't show him those.

490
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:54,001
Is that your boy?

491
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:54,837
Yes.

492
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,507
That's a
good looking kid.

493
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:02,342
He's a handful.

494
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:03,718
Oh I bet.

495
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,554
Especially for a single mom.

496
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:08,808
Well
ain't that a shame.

497
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,642
Tell him you don't have them.

498
00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:12,019
That's a good idea.

499
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,103
Okay but we have to act like
we're really out of breath,

500
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:14,562
because we've up and
down looking for 'em.

501
00:27:14,564 --> 00:27:15,814
Do five jumping jacks.

502
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:16,940
I can't do jumping
jacks, I'll pant.

503
00:27:16,942 --> 00:27:18,693
Okay well then
run, really fast.

504
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:19,651
Breathe hard.

505
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:20,485
I am.

506
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:22,655
Let's go come on.

507
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:24,031
See I reckon,

508
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:27,659
a woman like you would have
men lined up around the block.

509
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:28,912
You're too kind.

510
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:33,959
Thank you Virginia,
you are a gem.

511
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:36,712
Oh boy, that walk
was exhausting.

512
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,090
I'm sorry detective, I
can't find them right now.

513
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:42,927
Oh, okay.

514
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:47,763
Will you please call me if
you think of anything else...

515
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:48,597
I sure will.

516
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,598
I might need to know.

517
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,183
Yes, I will.

518
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:52,061
I sure will.

519
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:55,814
Bugs.

520
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:57,857
Have a good day ladies.

521
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:04,198
Well you
have a nice day too.

522
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:05,949
He sure is handsome.

523
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,660
Virginia, let's
go get a drink.

524
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:11,496
Oh yes.

525
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,253
I saw you shaking for
those young guys out there.

526
00:28:20,255 --> 00:28:21,421
Everything was shaking.

527
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:23,799
And I have a lot to shake so...

528
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:26,801
Yeah you do Coralee.

529
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:28,763
Oh, I had some fun though.

530
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:31,599
It was fun, I
love that country band.

531
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:32,435
Yeah.

532
00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:37,814
Bobby.

533
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,317
Bobby, come on it's your turn.

534
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:51,079
Come on girl, give me something.

535
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:54,080
Bobby, you keep making
the same mistakes.

536
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:56,874
Come on, I know
Mimi's gonna win.

537
00:28:56,876 --> 00:28:58,583
Who cares.

538
00:28:58,585 --> 00:28:59,417
Rummy.

539
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:00,336
Rummy.

540
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,799
Oh no, here we go.

541
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,257
Bobby, is something
bothering you?

542
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:07,094
What's wrong?

543
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:14,015
I got a visit from a police
detective looking for Jim.

544
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:16,560
Well, they're not gonna
find him at your house,

545
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:21,817
so don't you worry.

546
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:24,526
Mimi, what are you doing?

547
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:26,948
Oh, it's medical marijuana.

548
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:34,663
It's perfectly legal, the doctor
diagnosed me with anxiety.

549
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:36,414
Anxiety?

550
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,001
You're shitting me.

551
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,084
Did you roll that yourself?

552
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:42,128
No.

553
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,213
Kid down the street
did it for me.

554
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:49,342
First killing, now juvenile
delinquency and pot smoking,

555
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:52,346
girl you're turning
into a Ma Parker.

556
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:54,225
- Ma Parker.
- Ma Parker.

557
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:57,017
No I ain't Virginia.

558
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:59,938
I am just trying
to enjoy my life.

559
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,234
Well I have got to be going.

560
00:30:06,236 --> 00:30:07,903
Oh Bob, so soon?

561
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:09,821
Yeah, I got an early morning.

562
00:30:09,823 --> 00:30:12,657
Preparing food for the
church chili cook off.

563
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,284
Oh I already did
my fried chicken.

564
00:30:14,286 --> 00:30:16,161
I got my corn bread coming.

565
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:18,455
Gotta stop by the grocery
store on my way home.

566
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:19,790
Hey, don't forget

567
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:21,751
we got a beauty parlor
appointment tomorrow.

568
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,627
You bet.

569
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:24,169
Bye Mimi, I love you.

570
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:25,338
Bye.

571
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,591
Poor little thing.

572
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,901
Do you need help with that?

573
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:48,904
Go, go, go.

574
00:30:50,113 --> 00:30:51,656
Come on let's go.

575
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:10,507
Hey Randy.

576
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:11,343
Hey Bill.

577
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:17,807
What's this?

578
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,349
I was digging
through a few old files

579
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:22,186
and came across that, guys
name was Harry Lovelace.

580
00:31:22,188 --> 00:31:23,812
Been in and out of
prison a few times,

581
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:25,898
was a loan shark and
other petty things.

582
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,858
Turns out he now runs
an automotive body shop

583
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,234
right down there
off Main Street.

584
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:32,154
We thought it was a chop shop
but we couldn't prove it.

585
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,323
Isn't that your insurance
broker he's talking too?

586
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:36,159
Sure is.

587
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:40,788
Well, might be
worth a looksie.

588
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,706
You can say that.

589
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:44,043
Good job Bill.

590
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:47,962
So, you gonna go
question him or...

591
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:49,629
It's not the way I roll.

592
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:52,716
Gotta be more subtle than
storming in there as a cop.

593
00:31:52,718 --> 00:31:53,676
All right.

594
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,844
Didn't I teach you nothing.

595
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:56,803
Good catch.

596
00:31:56,805 --> 00:31:58,013
I'll keep that in mind.

597
00:31:58,015 --> 00:31:59,266
Yeah you should.

598
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,986
You are a mean man.

599
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:13,154
I didn't get a wink
of sleep last night

600
00:32:13,156 --> 00:32:14,405
sitting in God darn chair.

601
00:32:14,407 --> 00:32:15,865
Where's Jim?

602
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,949
Your son-in-law.

603
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:20,035
He's my ex-son-in-law
I'll remind you,

604
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:21,870
and darling he's done dead.

605
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:23,040
What?

606
00:32:24,374 --> 00:32:25,374
Dead?

607
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,833
How?

608
00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:27,669
When?

609
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:33,256
Better start working that jaw
old lady, he owes me money.

610
00:32:33,258 --> 00:32:36,926
He was gonna give me that
money selling your house.

611
00:32:36,928 --> 00:32:39,847
I meant he's dead to
me, that's what I meant.

612
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:41,307
Selling my house?

613
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:42,143
Yeah.

614
00:32:43,226 --> 00:32:45,936
Maybe the police would
like to know what you know.

615
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:48,272
Yeah, call the police
and while you're at it,

616
00:32:48,274 --> 00:32:50,983
tell 'em you've got an old
lady that has a chili cook off

617
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:52,818
later this afternoon
tied up in your,

618
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,862
whatever the hell this place is.

619
00:33:19,805 --> 00:33:20,640
Hello.

620
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:23,309
Anyone home?

621
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:38,281
Hey Harry.

622
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,490
Hey, what do you always knock

623
00:33:39,492 --> 00:33:42,534
if you're just gonna
walk in anyway?

624
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:46,038
We're not supposed to use
our real names, you dipshit.

625
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,417
Well you just confirmed
it was your real name.

626
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:50,417
All right.

627
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:53,672
And why aren't you
disguising your voice.

628
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:58,050
This is my real
voice, you dumbass.

629
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:00,093
Okay, what do you want?

630
00:34:00,095 --> 00:34:02,096
Well, the cop
you've been following

631
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:04,514
just pulled up outside.

632
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:05,390
Oh.

633
00:34:05,392 --> 00:34:06,224
Help!

634
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:07,059
Help me!

635
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,652
Well come on.

636
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:19,282
Shut up.

637
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,497
Can I help you sir?

638
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,791
Yeah, I got a car,
it's been a bad accident

639
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:33,376
and it needs some bodywork.

640
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:35,379
Well that ain't no
good, let's go see...

641
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:36,213
Oh it's,

642
00:34:36,215 --> 00:34:38,841
it's not the car I'm driving.

643
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,050
Okay.

644
00:34:40,052 --> 00:34:42,428
What can I do you for then?

645
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,095
Maybe you could
get me some prices?

646
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:44,972
Maybe you got a...

647
00:34:44,974 --> 00:34:46,015
Prices.

648
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:46,849
You got a brochure?

649
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,059
Brochure.

650
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:48,975
Or something like
that you can give me.

651
00:34:48,977 --> 00:34:50,854
A brochure, well sure.

652
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,988
Don't have much cause for one,

653
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,490
it's a neighborhood
business and everything,

654
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:05,869
but I know I got one somewhere.

655
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:08,037
I do appreciate that.

656
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,207
Yes sir.

657
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:15,251
Here you go, prices and
everything in there.

658
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:16,586
Why thank you,
thank you kindly.

659
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:20,591
I'll look this over
and might be back.

660
00:35:20,593 --> 00:35:22,637
Well I hope to see you.

661
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:26,265
Howdy.

662
00:35:32,438 --> 00:35:35,525
He's sniffing around.

663
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:38,776
He doesn't know I
know he's a cop.

664
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,198
It's not funny.

665
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:45,367
Should be scared.

666
00:35:55,378 --> 00:35:58,421
Coralee, get your
butt over here now.

667
00:35:58,423 --> 00:35:59,841
I need your help.

668
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,008
Well, Bobby was supposed
to come over here

669
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,637
so we could go to the beauty
parlor, but she never showed.

670
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,222
Well that's not like her.

671
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:11,057
And she's not
answering her phone.

672
00:36:28,077 --> 00:36:31,329
Okay,
so we found her.

673
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:33,164
She's in the grocery store.

674
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,624
Seriously Coralee,

675
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,709
when did your brains
turn into some meatballs?

676
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:39,586
She said she was going
shopping last night.

677
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:43,215
Now if she did, why is her
car still in the parking lot?

678
00:36:43,217 --> 00:36:45,550
Something's happened to her.

679
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:47,595
Mimi, how many
times have I told you,

680
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:50,263
don't speak to me in that
tone, I don't appreciate it.

681
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:51,474
I ain't your bitch.

682
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,559
I'm sorry Coralee.

683
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:55,811
It's just the anxiety, I just...

684
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,104
Mimi.

685
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:58,314
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

686
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,899
Put that down.

687
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:00,735
Oh fine.

688
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:03,445
Bossy pants.

689
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,155
Did you set the brake?

690
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:09,658
Yes, I set the brake.

691
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,369
You didn't the last time.

692
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,702
No wonder your
husband left you,

693
00:37:12,704 --> 00:37:14,872
you are the biggest
nag I ever saw.

694
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:16,289
Well I'm trying to live.

695
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,834
Well, shut your mouth,
you'll live longer.

696
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,251
Oh look, look.

697
00:37:20,253 --> 00:37:23,588
Coralee they got
cameras, come on.

698
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,758
Can't you walk any faster?

699
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,099
Yes.

700
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:33,390
Excuse me young man.

701
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:34,684
Yes ma'am.

702
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,559
Can you tell us where
the manager's office is?

703
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:38,604
Yes ma'am it's right around
the corner right there.

704
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:40,273
Oh, all right thank you.

705
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:41,731
Thank you, y'all
have a great day.

706
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:43,819
Yeah you too, thank you.

707
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:48,323
Wonder if it's this corner?

708
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:53,369
No I don't think so,
there's no sign on the door.

709
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,537
Let's keep walking.

710
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:59,668
No Coralee, we're not
looking at food now, come on.

711
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,380
Ah, here we go.

712
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:08,760
Can I help you ma'am?

713
00:38:10,178 --> 00:38:11,762
Are you the manager?

714
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:13,305
Yes ma'am I am.

715
00:38:13,307 --> 00:38:16,182
Well, our friend is missing

716
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:19,144
and her cars in
your parking lot.

717
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:20,687
And I have reason to believe

718
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:22,856
that there's been
some foul play,

719
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:26,693
and I noticed that you have
cameras outside your store

720
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:31,073
and inside and maybe I could
look at some of that video.

721
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,742
Look, if you truly think

722
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,367
something happened
to your friend,

723
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:36,745
then you need to
call the police,

724
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:42,251
or perhaps your friend is fine
and just visiting someone.

725
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,669
Are you talking
down to me young man?

726
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:47,048
I have lived a very long time,

727
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,383
I've probably forgotten more
than you will ever know.

728
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:53,303
Now I would like to
see some of that video.

729
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:54,597
No.

730
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,930
I don't have to
show you nothing.

731
00:38:55,932 --> 00:39:00,102
Now you best be moving along,
before I call the police.

732
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,312
Ma'am.

733
00:39:01,314 --> 00:39:03,481
Well that's not the very nice,

734
00:39:03,483 --> 00:39:04,776
you big asshole.

735
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:10,613
Mimi, what we gonna do?

736
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:14,742
I don't know Coralee,
I just need to think.

737
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:16,327
I got an idea.

738
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:17,662
Wooh.

739
00:39:17,664 --> 00:39:18,495
Help!

740
00:39:18,497 --> 00:39:19,454
Oh help me.

741
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:20,457
Ow, ow, ow.

742
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,249
Help me.

743
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,044
I can't get up.

744
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,554
You back from the war Mary?

745
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:38,642
Kiss your mama, come on baby.

746
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:50,530
Where is that video tape?

747
00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:55,909
Oh, it's probably new
fangled contraption.

748
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,289
Come on here, help her up.

749
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:03,916
Come back from the dead.

750
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:07,171
It's okay, I'm
here now, it's okay.

751
00:40:09,423 --> 00:40:10,757
One, two, three.

752
00:40:11,718 --> 00:40:12,550
Mom?

753
00:40:12,552 --> 00:40:13,383
Yeah, I'm here baby.

754
00:40:13,385 --> 00:40:14,343
Mom is that you?

755
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,803
Yeah it's okay,
it's all right,

756
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:17,305
she just forgot to
take her medicine.

757
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:19,432
Wait a minute, it's you again.

758
00:40:19,434 --> 00:40:21,559
Yeah, well we're
going now bye, bye.

759
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:22,434
Mom.

760
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:23,894
Come on.

761
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:26,354
All right have a good day.

762
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:28,483
Okay girl, come along.

763
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,702
Hi Mimi, you need
another joint rolled?

764
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,537
Get your butt in here.

765
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:45,291
What are you trying
to get me arrested?

766
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:46,584
Come over here.

767
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:48,129
Now, what is this?

768
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:50,798
A flash drive.

769
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,050
How does it work?

770
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:56,510
You record video on it.

771
00:40:56,512 --> 00:40:57,510
Oh.

772
00:40:57,512 --> 00:40:58,680
Oh, video.

773
00:41:00,015 --> 00:41:02,432
Coralee we did it,
we got the pictures.

774
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:04,477
On here, we did it.

775
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:06,606
Well how does it work?

776
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,274
No, no, no don't start it yet.

777
00:41:10,276 --> 00:41:11,608
Just tell me what to do.

778
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,693
Press this
button, right there.

779
00:41:13,695 --> 00:41:14,986
All right, I got it.

780
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:17,365
You can skedaddle now.

781
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:19,783
I can take it from here.

782
00:41:19,785 --> 00:41:22,035
Pick up your laptop tomorrow.

783
00:41:22,037 --> 00:41:24,914
Wait a minute, I
wanna see what it is.

784
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:25,830
Um, no.

785
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:27,499
No, it's porn.

786
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,919
Oh I definitely
wanna see it then.

787
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:32,799
Well okay, but
it's elderly porn.

788
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:37,593
Made by the elderly,
for the elderly

789
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,764
with old, old elderly actors.

790
00:41:42,684 --> 00:41:44,809
I'll be back tomorrow.

791
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:48,814
On your way back, will
you bring me a dime bag.

792
00:41:56,863 --> 00:41:59,823
We can't wait all day
for Bobby to show up.

793
00:41:59,825 --> 00:42:02,367
Well there's gotta be one
of those fast forward buttons

794
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:04,663
on this thing, try that one.

795
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,374
Okay, there she is.

796
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:10,961
Stop it, pause, stop.

797
00:42:13,006 --> 00:42:17,218
Well, who is that slime bag
that took our friend Bobby.

798
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:31,604
Still working?

799
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:33,775
A detective never sleeps.

800
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:38,403
Got a bunch of files from
the insurance brokers office,

801
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,615
trying to make heads
or tails of it.

802
00:42:40,617 --> 00:42:41,450
Yeah.

803
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:44,285
It's like Mr insurance
man withdrew a lot of money

804
00:42:44,287 --> 00:42:48,079
from the company bank
account about six months ago.

805
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:51,876
A couple of hundred
thousand dollars.

806
00:42:51,878 --> 00:42:54,713
Anybody notice a paper trail.

807
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:57,923
Not everybody's
as smart as I am.

808
00:42:57,925 --> 00:43:00,675
Okay, Starsky then why
didn't anybody catch it.

809
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:02,010
Because two days later,

810
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:06,640
he deposited an equal amount
of money right back in.

811
00:43:06,642 --> 00:43:07,684
Gambling?

812
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,187
That's what I'm thinking.

813
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:14,481
Maybe the dimwit withdrew the
money, gambled it and won.

814
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:17,319
And replaced the
original amount.

815
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,863
Or,

816
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,115
he gambled it and lost

817
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:28,456
and had to get a quick
loan to replace it.

818
00:43:28,456 --> 00:43:29,997
A loan from...

819
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:31,624
Harry Lovelace.

820
00:43:31,626 --> 00:43:33,667
And maybe he couldn't pay it.

821
00:43:33,669 --> 00:43:34,503
So Harry...

822
00:43:37,256 --> 00:43:38,091
Yeah.

823
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:46,262
You know though, this
has got me thinking.

824
00:43:46,264 --> 00:43:50,268
If Harry killed Jim, he'd
never get that money.

825
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,396
Duh.

826
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:57,858
Maybe he wrote it off as a
lost cause and exacted revenge.

827
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,528
Or maybe Harry had nothing
to do with Jim's disappearance

828
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,030
in the first place,
you ever think of that?

829
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:06,702
Maybe, really only
one way to find out.

830
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:11,622
Oh I'm glad you're here.

831
00:44:11,624 --> 00:44:14,709
I ran a minute and
30 seconds to get here,

832
00:44:14,711 --> 00:44:17,044
after I got your message.

833
00:44:17,046 --> 00:44:18,044
You ran?

834
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:18,963
Why didn't you walk?

835
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:20,965
I mean come on, or even drive?

836
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:21,966
What's she doing?

837
00:44:21,968 --> 00:44:24,095
Is she getting high again.

838
00:44:26,014 --> 00:44:28,638
I think I found him.

839
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,517
That's him,
that's that slimeball.

840
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:32,684
Let me see.

841
00:44:32,686 --> 00:44:34,687
Harry Lovelace.

842
00:44:34,689 --> 00:44:36,521
Why would he keep Bobby?

843
00:44:36,523 --> 00:44:38,608
I mean how would
he even know her?

844
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,483
I think it has to do with Jim.

845
00:44:40,485 --> 00:44:44,238
That's slickering owl shit
was up to his neck in no good.

846
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,990
That damn criminal.

847
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:52,706
What are we gonna do?

848
00:45:04,718 --> 00:45:06,593
We're getting nowhere fast.

849
00:45:06,595 --> 00:45:08,180
Let me think will ya.

850
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:13,434
If we kill her, we don't have
any way of getting the money.

851
00:45:18,398 --> 00:45:19,232
It's Jim.

852
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:23,363
Maybe he's not dead after all.

853
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:28,407
Hey Jimmy boy, where
the hell have you been?

854
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:30,450
Um, this isn't Jim.

855
00:45:30,452 --> 00:45:33,747
Mr. Harry Lovelace.

856
00:45:33,747 --> 00:45:35,205
Well who is it?

857
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:37,749
Well it doesn't
matter who I am,

858
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:39,920
you pig slime sack of shit.

859
00:45:41,798 --> 00:45:44,590
What's important is that
you're holding my friend

860
00:45:44,592 --> 00:45:46,800
and I want her back.

861
00:45:46,802 --> 00:45:49,720
Well, I don't what
you're talking about.

862
00:45:49,722 --> 00:45:52,682
Oh well, I have a video
from a grocery store

863
00:45:52,684 --> 00:45:54,310
that says different.

864
00:45:55,477 --> 00:45:59,523
Now, you do as I say and we
can both get what we want.

865
00:46:01,901 --> 00:46:02,902
All right.

866
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:05,861
How do you know what I want?

867
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:08,698
I'm not playing 20 questions.

868
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,826
You tell me.

869
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:14,037
Fair enough.

870
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:19,624
I want her house or $200,000,
makes no difference to me.

871
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:23,169
Well, you bring Bobby back
and you can have the house.

872
00:46:23,171 --> 00:46:25,715
How do you know I haven't
already killed the old bitch?

873
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:28,008
Hey, you watch
your potty mouth.

874
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,970
Well, if you have then
we have no fish to fry

875
00:46:30,972 --> 00:46:34,807
and I have a video to
deliver right to the police.

876
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:35,807
All right, all right.

877
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:39,354
Look don't do anything hasty.

878
00:46:39,354 --> 00:46:41,731
Your friend is still alive.

879
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:43,441
Let me talk to her.

880
00:46:43,443 --> 00:46:44,691
She's sleeping?

881
00:46:44,693 --> 00:46:46,484
Is she snoring?

882
00:46:46,486 --> 00:46:47,486
Yeah.

883
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:48,573
Let me hear.

884
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,747
Yeah that's Bobby all right.

885
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,874
Okay, you bring her to my house

886
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:02,751
and I got Jim's paperwork here

887
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:06,048
and I'm sure she'll
sign it over to you.

888
00:47:08,008 --> 00:47:09,092
Okey dokey.

889
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,220
Okay, here's my address.

890
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:16,642
All right.

891
00:47:17,934 --> 00:47:21,144
Go to this address,
kill everyone there.

892
00:47:21,146 --> 00:47:25,231
Get all the paperwork they
have and bring it back here.

893
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:28,318
I'm gonna get us
some sandwiches.

894
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,570
What about this grandma?

895
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:30,655
She'll be fine.

896
00:47:30,657 --> 00:47:32,155
I'll be back in a jiff.

897
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:33,573
And when you get back here,

898
00:47:33,575 --> 00:47:37,912
get her to sign the papers and
then dump her in the river.

899
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:39,579
Oh yeah.

900
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:43,919
You're gonna have a good
time tonight, ain't ya.

901
00:48:26,628 --> 00:48:29,838
Why did you tell him, you're
gonna give him the paperwork?

902
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,383
You done burn that paperwork up.

903
00:48:32,385 --> 00:48:34,050
Well I had to
tell him something.

904
00:48:34,052 --> 00:48:36,095
Shh, be quiet Coralee.

905
00:48:36,097 --> 00:48:38,138
Just let me think.

906
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,182
Let me think.

907
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,396
You sure
this is a good idea?

908
00:48:45,398 --> 00:48:48,066
Hell no, it's a great idea.

909
00:48:50,445 --> 00:48:51,818
Show time.

910
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,778
Randy I don't
like this one bit.

911
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,863
We're law men.

912
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:55,363
That we are.

913
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,283
But I believe in
justice more than law.

914
00:48:58,285 --> 00:49:01,704
Besides we're just gonna
take a little looksie.

915
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:03,124
No harm, no foul.

916
00:49:09,421 --> 00:49:12,340
Stand look out, I
won't be a minute.

917
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:13,758
I'm nervous as hell Randy.

918
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,216
Why?

919
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,678
You got a gun and a badge, you
could legally shoot anyone.

920
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,098
Where you been?

921
00:50:23,037 --> 00:50:24,327
You Harry?

922
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:26,206
Does a fish swim?

923
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,459
So did you find anything out?

924
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:15,715
Oh yeah, let's
scooter out of here.

925
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,182
You don't sound like Harry.

926
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:27,932
I sure am.

927
00:51:27,934 --> 00:51:29,100
Show me your ID.

928
00:51:29,102 --> 00:51:31,437
I ain't showing nothing.

929
00:51:31,439 --> 00:51:33,104
Where's the paperwork?

930
00:51:33,106 --> 00:51:34,689
Well where's my friend.

931
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,108
In the car.

932
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,693
We wanna see her.

933
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:41,905
Okay, but I wanna see
the paperwork first.

934
00:51:41,907 --> 00:51:42,741
Well.

935
00:51:45,077 --> 00:51:45,911
Virginia.

936
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:49,704
Paperwork!

937
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:50,580
Hey.

938
00:51:50,582 --> 00:51:51,749
Give it to me.

939
00:51:51,751 --> 00:51:52,791
What?

940
00:51:52,793 --> 00:51:54,336
The paperwork.

941
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:06,012
Yeah, I'm getting it
right now and everything.

942
00:52:06,014 --> 00:52:06,848
All right.

943
00:52:12,354 --> 00:52:13,187
Oh my God.

944
00:52:13,189 --> 00:52:15,231
Oh Coralee, you did it.

945
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:16,524
You did it.

946
00:52:16,526 --> 00:52:19,193
The only good
man, is a dead man.

947
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:21,736
Well he ain't dead.

948
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,030
You gonna stay dead.

949
00:52:36,461 --> 00:52:41,006
Oh my God, y'all gonna
have to help me up.

950
00:52:41,008 --> 00:52:42,508
Come on Coralee.

951
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:45,512
Good job.

952
00:52:45,512 --> 00:52:46,346
Wooh.

953
00:52:47,557 --> 00:52:50,599
Come on let's go get Bobby.

954
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,475
Nope, first things first.

955
00:52:52,477 --> 00:52:56,981
We've got to put Harry
here in the freezer.

956
00:52:56,983 --> 00:53:00,318
Is that chainsaw still here?

957
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,448
I'm just gonna
check something here?

958
00:53:04,907 --> 00:53:05,742
Aha.

959
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:10,371
Ah, I knew it.

960
00:53:11,247 --> 00:53:14,707
He's not Harry,
his name is Stan.

961
00:53:14,709 --> 00:53:18,254
Oh shame on you, you
liar, shame on you.

962
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:23,466
Come on girls, let's
take him to the garage.

963
00:53:23,468 --> 00:53:25,383
I'm just gonna.

964
00:53:25,385 --> 00:53:26,968
Can you push a little harder.

965
00:53:37,898 --> 00:53:38,732
Evening.

966
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:53,537
You hungry?

967
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:54,872
Want a sandwich?

968
00:53:54,874 --> 00:53:56,207
Not if it's fast food.

969
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:57,832
That stuff will kill ya.

970
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,378
Besides I got diverticulitis.

971
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,546
Diver's what?

972
00:54:02,631 --> 00:54:03,715
Never mind.

973
00:54:04,925 --> 00:54:06,800
Why are you being nice to me?

974
00:54:06,802 --> 00:54:10,680
Well, you could think
of that as your last meal.

975
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:13,349
What are you talking about?

976
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,600
My boy Stan went over
to your friends house,

977
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:20,689
to kill that old woman and
bring Jim's paperwork back.

978
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:23,943
You're gonna sign it, if
you wanna keep on breathing.

979
00:54:23,945 --> 00:54:25,111
I don't believe you.

980
00:54:25,113 --> 00:54:27,405
I think you're gonna kill me.

981
00:54:27,407 --> 00:54:29,698
I don't care.

982
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,534
What?

983
00:54:31,994 --> 00:54:35,162
I don't car what you believe.

984
00:54:39,668 --> 00:54:41,376
Well, well, well.

985
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,715
There is he now.

986
00:54:43,715 --> 00:54:45,338
I'm gonna put this
on speakerphone

987
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,883
so you can here the details
of your friends demise

988
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,468
in all it's glory.

989
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,178
Talk to me Stan.

990
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,807
Your asshole friend is dead.

991
00:54:54,809 --> 00:54:55,682
Hi Mimi.

992
00:54:55,684 --> 00:54:56,725
Get me away from this jerk,

993
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:58,686
he's feeding me fast
food sandwiches.

994
00:54:59,689 --> 00:55:01,646
Will you shut that
damn thing off Coralee,

995
00:55:01,648 --> 00:55:05,276
I'm trying to have
a conversation here.

996
00:55:05,278 --> 00:55:06,693
Mimi.

997
00:55:06,695 --> 00:55:09,364
I'm trying to chop this guy up.

998
00:55:10,115 --> 00:55:11,825
Them's my friends.

999
00:55:13,285 --> 00:55:14,619
What'd you do?

1000
00:55:14,621 --> 00:55:17,622
The same thing he
was gonna do to us.

1001
00:55:17,624 --> 00:55:18,705
Listen lady.

1002
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:21,584
No, you listen to me mister.

1003
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:22,959
We want our friend back,

1004
00:55:22,961 --> 00:55:27,550
and if you harm one little
hair on her pretty head,

1005
00:55:28,635 --> 00:55:31,676
I'm going straight to the
police with that video.

1006
00:55:31,678 --> 00:55:32,803
Fine.

1007
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:36,140
You wanna play
hardball, let's play.

1008
00:55:36,142 --> 00:55:37,515
Forget the house.

1009
00:55:37,517 --> 00:55:41,102
You give me 200 grand and
you get your friend back,

1010
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:43,689
or she sleeps with the cronads.

1011
00:55:43,691 --> 00:55:45,276
You got two days.

1012
00:55:48,153 --> 00:55:50,153
Are we gonna get Bobby back?

1013
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:51,488
How'd it go?

1014
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,990
It didn't go so well girls.

1015
00:55:53,992 --> 00:55:56,411
He wants $200,000 in two days

1016
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:01,417
or Bobby's gonna
go to see Jesus.

1017
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:05,419
How we gonna get
that much money Mimi?

1018
00:56:05,421 --> 00:56:08,925
What kind of mess have
you gotten us into.

1019
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,570
Body shops just a cover.

1020
00:56:31,572 --> 00:56:34,657
Harry's definitely back in
the loan shark business.

1021
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:39,202
I saw the file of all the
people who owe him money.

1022
00:56:39,204 --> 00:56:41,747
Jim's names in the list.

1023
00:56:41,749 --> 00:56:46,001
Well how much do you think
Jim is into him for then?

1024
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:46,962
$200,000.

1025
00:56:47,796 --> 00:56:49,421
I think Harry got
tired of waiting,

1026
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:52,675
killed Jim and
disposed of the body.

1027
00:56:52,677 --> 00:56:55,678
How in the hell are
you gonna prove that?

1028
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,053
Well for starters,

1029
00:56:57,055 --> 00:56:59,180
I'm gonna pay Jim's ex-mother-in-law
a visit in the morning

1030
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:03,394
and find out what she knows
about this Harry Lovelace.

1031
00:57:03,396 --> 00:57:04,812
All right.

1032
00:57:04,814 --> 00:57:06,396
All right.

1033
00:57:06,398 --> 00:57:08,774
Well that sounds like
a pretty good plan.

1034
00:57:08,776 --> 00:57:10,360
I'd say.

1035
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,403
Give me the keys.

1036
00:57:12,405 --> 00:57:13,613
In the car.

1037
00:57:13,615 --> 00:57:16,157
You got ice cream
on your pants.

1038
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:18,450
I better get you napkins huh.

1039
00:57:18,452 --> 00:57:19,492
Sloppy.

1040
00:57:19,494 --> 00:57:20,660
All right.

1041
00:57:20,662 --> 00:57:21,706
Sloppy boy.

1042
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:36,486
Hey there.

1043
00:58:36,488 --> 00:58:37,782
Looking for Bobby?

1044
00:58:38,657 --> 00:58:39,659
Yes sir.

1045
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:41,908
You won't by any chance

1046
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,952
happen to know where
she might be, would you?

1047
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:45,122
Who's asking?

1048
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:48,541
It's official business.

1049
00:58:48,543 --> 00:58:50,251
I wanna ask you a few questions.

1050
00:58:50,253 --> 00:58:51,584
Have you seen her?

1051
00:58:51,586 --> 00:58:55,213
No, not for a
couple of days now.

1052
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:58,216
Have you tried her friend?

1053
00:58:58,218 --> 00:58:59,095
Who's that?

1054
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:05,515
Her name is Mimi, they
get together every weekend,

1055
00:59:05,517 --> 00:59:07,977
her and a couple of others.

1056
00:59:07,979 --> 00:59:12,148
I'm thinking Mimi will probably
know right where she's at.

1057
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,231
Thanks.

1058
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:14,566
You have her address.

1059
00:59:14,568 --> 00:59:15,901
I do.

1060
00:59:15,903 --> 00:59:17,945
I think I got something
in my kitchen over there.

1061
00:59:17,947 --> 00:59:23,033
I got a pot of coffee on
too son, come on around.

1062
00:59:23,035 --> 00:59:23,869
All right.

1063
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:31,499
Oh Ava, it's so nice of
you to help out around here.

1064
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,336
Oh no problem at all Mimi.

1065
00:59:33,338 --> 00:59:34,669
I like helping.

1066
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,838
Well, I'm gonna give
you a few bucks you know.

1067
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,883
You just find me
a nice cowboy Mimi.

1068
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:40,800
I ain't got no use
for your money.

1069
00:59:40,802 --> 00:59:43,470
I'll keep my eyes open for ya.

1070
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:48,810
Oh dammit that always happens.

1071
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:54,523
This old house just can't
seem to handle the power.

1072
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:56,568
Wait, I got it.

1073
00:59:56,568 --> 00:59:58,361
Where's the circuit breaker?

1074
00:59:58,363 --> 00:59:59,656
In the garage.

1075
01:00:01,615 --> 01:00:04,617
She can't find her
ass with two hands.

1076
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:07,914
Mimi, she's my daughter.

1077
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:13,251
Well.

1078
01:00:24,222 --> 01:00:25,055
Freezer.

1079
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,381
Harry.

1080
01:01:00,383 --> 01:01:01,590
I wouldn't put it past him,

1081
01:01:01,592 --> 01:01:04,468
after he sent that other
man to try to kill us.

1082
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:06,428
It's okay Ava, I'll get it.

1083
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:07,264
Sit down.

1084
01:01:27,869 --> 01:01:29,120
Can I help you?

1085
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,079
Well howdy ma'am,
I hope you can.

1086
01:01:34,499 --> 01:01:36,041
Did you hear something?

1087
01:01:36,043 --> 01:01:38,588
No.

1088
01:01:38,588 --> 01:01:39,756
Oh.

1089
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:42,923
Well I'm detective
Randall Mclemore,

1090
01:01:42,925 --> 01:01:45,508
but you can call me Randy.

1091
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:49,763
I've got some questions for
you if you have a minute?

1092
01:01:49,765 --> 01:01:52,267
Oh, sure detective, come in.

1093
01:01:56,021 --> 01:02:00,317
Well, what did you wanna
ask me concerning Bobby?

1094
01:02:02,028 --> 01:02:03,986
I wanted to talk
to Bobby further

1095
01:02:03,988 --> 01:02:08,073
about her ex-son-in-law Jim,
but can't seem to find her.

1096
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:11,242
Would you know her whereabouts?

1097
01:02:11,244 --> 01:02:14,247
No, I have no
idea where she's at.

1098
01:02:15,374 --> 01:02:20,086
Me and my friends, we spend
every weekend together,

1099
01:02:20,088 --> 01:02:23,508
but Bobby's missed
the last few weekends.

1100
01:02:25,718 --> 01:02:28,718
Virginia, how many
weekends has Bobby missed?

1101
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,554
Huh?

1102
01:02:30,514 --> 01:02:31,974
Oh, two, I think.

1103
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:35,852
Yes.

1104
01:02:36,729 --> 01:02:38,646
Two.

1105
01:02:38,648 --> 01:02:40,856
So she's missing?

1106
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:44,193
Oh no, I wouldn't
say that, no.

1107
01:02:44,195 --> 01:02:47,113
Did you know that
Jim was missing too?

1108
01:02:47,115 --> 01:02:48,113
No.

1109
01:02:48,115 --> 01:02:49,240
No.

1110
01:02:49,242 --> 01:02:52,617
Oh Bobby never said
anything to us about that.

1111
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:53,952
Well mama you knew,

1112
01:02:53,954 --> 01:02:57,289
you were at Bobby's when
the detective here came by.

1113
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:58,874
Oh yeah.

1114
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,044
I remember now.

1115
01:03:01,586 --> 01:03:03,505
Jim is missing, yeah.

1116
01:03:08,177 --> 01:03:10,262
That pie sure is yummy.

1117
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:14,434
Do either of you
ladies know this man?

1118
01:03:20,356 --> 01:03:24,858
No, no, I really,
I can't place him.

1119
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,026
What about you ma'am?

1120
01:03:26,028 --> 01:03:26,861
Nope.

1121
01:03:26,863 --> 01:03:28,195
Nope, nope.

1122
01:03:28,197 --> 01:03:31,242
No.

1123
01:03:31,242 --> 01:03:35,785
Does anyone else smell
something foul in here?

1124
01:03:35,787 --> 01:03:37,162
Oh no!

1125
01:03:37,164 --> 01:03:39,874
I unplugged the freezer when
I was vacuuming last night.

1126
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:41,709
Ava, don't open it.

1127
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:43,753
If there's rotten meat in there,

1128
01:03:43,755 --> 01:03:47,213
it's just gonna stink
up the whole house.

1129
01:03:47,215 --> 01:03:51,345
Well, is there anything else
I can help you with detective?

1130
01:03:52,805 --> 01:03:53,803
No, no, no thank you.

1131
01:03:53,805 --> 01:03:56,307
That's all for now.

1132
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:58,186
Pie sure was to die for.

1133
01:03:59,186 --> 01:04:02,606
If your friend calls,
will you please,

1134
01:04:03,775 --> 01:04:05,106
if you find her.

1135
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:07,151
Yes, if I hear anything
from Bobby, yes sir,

1136
01:04:07,153 --> 01:04:10,905
I'll sure be happy
too let you know.

1137
01:04:10,907 --> 01:04:12,073
If we hear anything
about Bobby, goodbye.

1138
01:04:12,075 --> 01:04:12,907
Goodbye.

1139
01:04:12,909 --> 01:04:14,077
Mimi.

1140
01:04:17,162 --> 01:04:18,412
Bill are you there.

1141
01:04:18,414 --> 01:04:19,829
I'm right here.

1142
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:22,332
There's something bass
ackwards going on in that house.

1143
01:04:22,334 --> 01:04:25,961
My spidey senses are
going through the roof.

1144
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,254
I'm smelling some rotten fish

1145
01:04:27,256 --> 01:04:29,215
and I'm starting to think
that those old ladies

1146
01:04:29,217 --> 01:04:31,508
are in cahoots
with Harry Lovelace

1147
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:34,012
and killed both Jim and Bobby.

1148
01:04:42,396 --> 01:04:43,521
Oh you plugged it in.

1149
01:04:43,523 --> 01:04:44,729
I'm so sorry.

1150
01:04:44,731 --> 01:04:46,064
I'll help you get rid
of the rotten meat.

1151
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:47,399
No, no that's okay.

1152
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:48,441
We can take care of it.

1153
01:04:48,443 --> 01:04:50,568
What is wrong with
you two, come on.

1154
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,990
- Ava.
- Don't open it Ava.

1155
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:54,491
Why?

1156
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:56,619
Because we...

1157
01:04:58,287 --> 01:05:01,037
We killed a deer in my car.

1158
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,374
And it's against the law.

1159
01:05:03,376 --> 01:05:05,542
No it's not, it's an accident.

1160
01:05:05,544 --> 01:05:08,004
Not if it's out of season.

1161
01:05:08,006 --> 01:05:10,588
We were planning on eating it,

1162
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:13,008
but it's obviously gone bad.

1163
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:13,843
It's disgusting.

1164
01:05:13,845 --> 01:05:15,928
We'll take care of it.

1165
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:19,222
Honey you should go on
home, your son needs you.

1166
01:05:19,224 --> 01:05:20,349
Mama, you're my ride

1167
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:23,184
and the sitters gonna be
there for another hour.

1168
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:25,937
Look I told Mimi that I'd help
her take care of the trash,

1169
01:05:25,939 --> 01:05:27,981
so I'll just go do that.

1170
01:05:27,983 --> 01:05:33,905
You two are acting goofy.

1171
01:05:33,905 --> 01:05:36,323
Virginia we gotta get
rid of these guys soon.

1172
01:05:36,325 --> 01:05:38,325
The clock is ticking
on Bobby's life

1173
01:05:38,327 --> 01:05:41,995
and that detective is
getting real suspicious.

1174
01:05:41,997 --> 01:05:43,414
You think so.

1175
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:47,584
Have your brains
gone chopping Virginia?

1176
01:05:47,586 --> 01:05:49,211
For God's sake.

1177
01:05:49,213 --> 01:05:50,796
We couldn't have done any worse

1178
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:52,381
on that question
and answer session

1179
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,800
than if we'd actually
committed a murder.

1180
01:05:54,802 --> 01:05:57,428
We did actually
commit a murder.

1181
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:58,389
Well you did.

1182
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,932
Well, technically speaking.

1183
01:06:01,934 --> 01:06:04,934
But, well one was
in self defense.

1184
01:06:04,936 --> 01:06:07,146
Okay,
if you say so.

1185
01:06:12,403 --> 01:06:15,198
I gotta
go light a joint.

1186
01:06:31,631 --> 01:06:32,757
Is that blood?

1187
01:06:35,008 --> 01:06:36,968
Back so soon stranger.

1188
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:38,221
Oh hi, Ava.

1189
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,262
What are you doing out here?

1190
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:43,307
Taking out the trash.

1191
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:46,059
I should be asking you
that question though.

1192
01:06:46,061 --> 01:06:48,479
Well, that smell
was so pungent

1193
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:52,235
that I was concerned
for you and the others.

1194
01:06:54,236 --> 01:06:56,447
Ain't you sweet detective.

1195
01:06:57,698 --> 01:07:03,119
No need to worry though, they
told me what the smell was.

1196
01:07:03,121 --> 01:07:04,122
Well?

1197
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:07,582
Don't leave me in suspense.

1198
01:07:09,918 --> 01:07:12,421
They killed a...

1199
01:07:12,421 --> 01:07:13,380
Deer.

1200
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:18,050
They said it was
illegal, is that true?

1201
01:07:18,052 --> 01:07:20,137
This time of year, yeah.

1202
01:07:21,055 --> 01:07:23,222
You gonna arrest them?

1203
01:07:23,224 --> 01:07:26,102
No, I like deer meat, it's...

1204
01:07:28,521 --> 01:07:29,354
juicy.

1205
01:07:30,523 --> 01:07:31,356
Tasty.

1206
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,153
Can be eaten in many forms.

1207
01:07:37,363 --> 01:07:39,323
I prefer the sausage.

1208
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:51,082
Well, looks like
everything seems fine out here.

1209
01:07:51,084 --> 01:07:55,923
I think I could um,
I should be going.

1210
01:07:55,923 --> 01:07:57,048
Yeah.

1211
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:58,215
Well have a good night.

1212
01:07:58,217 --> 01:08:00,720
Always a pleasure detective.

1213
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:12,439
Where the hell
did I put my car.

1214
01:08:17,445 --> 01:08:19,903
Sit down and have
some more tequila,

1215
01:08:19,905 --> 01:08:21,988
it will take the
edge off of you.

1216
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:24,785
Okay, let's finish
the card game.

1217
01:08:29,874 --> 01:08:31,916
Well what got into you girl?

1218
01:08:31,918 --> 01:08:34,502
Did you get into Mimi's pot?

1219
01:08:34,504 --> 01:08:36,044
No.

1220
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:39,840
That wonderful detective,
he's a real cowboy.

1221
01:08:39,842 --> 01:08:42,760
He was so worried about us,
about that smell you know,

1222
01:08:42,762 --> 01:08:47,181
that he was outside looking
in the garage window.

1223
01:08:47,183 --> 01:08:49,141
Ain't he something.

1224
01:08:49,143 --> 01:08:51,351
I didn't see no
ring on him either.

1225
01:08:51,353 --> 01:08:53,897
Well, was he snooping around?

1226
01:08:55,232 --> 01:09:00,151
He can come snooping
around me anytime he wants.

1227
01:09:00,153 --> 01:09:03,071
We gotta get rid of 'em soon.

1228
01:09:03,073 --> 01:09:04,198
I know.

1229
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,034
But we got a much bigger
problem than that.

1230
01:09:08,036 --> 01:09:11,415
We need to raise 200
grand to save Bobby.

1231
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:15,251
How are we gonna do that?

1232
01:09:15,253 --> 01:09:18,253
I don't Virginia,
let me think.

1233
01:09:18,255 --> 01:09:20,422
Oh I need to smoke.

1234
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:22,925
Oh no, I'm all out.

1235
01:09:22,927 --> 01:09:24,512
I gotta call the kid.

1236
01:09:32,812 --> 01:09:35,270
I have run out of options.

1237
01:09:35,272 --> 01:09:39,233
Randy that detective is
about to break the case

1238
01:09:39,235 --> 01:09:42,655
and well Bobby's gonna die.

1239
01:09:42,655 --> 01:09:43,488
Mimi.

1240
01:09:44,616 --> 01:09:47,658
Oh, he knows I'm
writing a novel.

1241
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,994
We're just working out some
of the plotting issues.

1242
01:09:50,996 --> 01:09:53,332
Yeah, I think it's cool.

1243
01:09:56,419 --> 01:09:58,338
Now roll some more.

1244
01:09:59,296 --> 01:10:01,381
Uh, can I have a hit.

1245
01:10:02,674 --> 01:10:03,508
No.

1246
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:08,846
I'm not gonna contribute
to no juvenile delinquency.

1247
01:10:08,848 --> 01:10:13,601
Mimi, I think you've already
crossed that line already.

1248
01:10:13,603 --> 01:10:14,601
Good point.

1249
01:10:14,603 --> 01:10:15,437
Yeah.

1250
01:10:19,107 --> 01:10:21,777
So, what about my story idea?

1251
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:26,407
You said, your main characters

1252
01:10:28,076 --> 01:10:31,702
are a group of old ladies right?

1253
01:10:31,704 --> 01:10:32,787
Old ladies?

1254
01:10:32,789 --> 01:10:36,000
They say, write
what you know, so yes.

1255
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:41,462
Why can't they just
kill the detective?

1256
01:10:41,464 --> 01:10:44,047
Believe me, it's
cross my mind.

1257
01:10:44,049 --> 01:10:45,882
No, they can't do that because

1258
01:10:45,884 --> 01:10:51,137
one of the old ladies
daughters loves that detective.

1259
01:10:51,139 --> 01:10:53,601
Besides that, the freezers full.

1260
01:10:55,436 --> 01:10:57,354
Now here's an idea.

1261
01:11:00,148 --> 01:11:02,275
Choose a hand.

1262
01:11:02,277 --> 01:11:04,404
Now all they need to do,

1263
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:07,782
is misdirect the detective.

1264
01:11:11,244 --> 01:11:12,077
Oh.

1265
01:11:14,914 --> 01:11:17,375
Mimi, can I try that thing?

1266
01:11:18,793 --> 01:11:20,293
What?

1267
01:11:20,295 --> 01:11:21,921
That joint thing?

1268
01:11:23,423 --> 01:11:25,008
Coralee, listen.

1269
01:11:25,883 --> 01:11:29,302
I don't do this for pleasure.

1270
01:11:29,304 --> 01:11:32,848
I do it for my...

1271
01:11:32,848 --> 01:11:33,724
My anxiety.

1272
01:11:35,143 --> 01:11:36,559
And my stress.

1273
01:11:36,561 --> 01:11:38,269
I feel stressed.

1274
01:11:38,271 --> 01:11:41,646
And I got anxiety, you
give me anxiety everyday.

1275
01:11:41,648 --> 01:11:43,481
So let me, let me
try that thing.

1276
01:11:43,483 --> 01:11:44,859
All right Coralee.

1277
01:11:44,861 --> 01:11:47,028

1308
01:13:04,732 --> 01:13:13,241
Well girls,
let's get her done.

1309
01:13:17,327 --> 01:13:18,910
You have my money?

1310
01:13:18,912 --> 01:13:21,872
Well that's a
fine how do you do.

1311
01:13:21,874 --> 01:13:23,039
Do you?

1312
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:24,292
Yes.

1313
01:13:24,294 --> 01:13:25,834
We have your money.

1314
01:13:25,836 --> 01:13:26,918
How's Bobby?

1315
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,297
Old, wrinkled and
not long to this Earth.

1316
01:13:29,299 --> 01:13:31,507
You stop that bullshit.

1317
01:13:31,509 --> 01:13:36,555
Let me hear her.

1318
01:13:36,555 --> 01:13:38,346
She wants to talk to you.

1319
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:39,556
Ouch.

1320
01:13:39,558 --> 01:13:42,017
Mimi, I've been in the
same position for days.

1321
01:13:42,019 --> 01:13:45,354
My arthritis is acting up,
you gotta get me out of here.

1322
01:13:45,356 --> 01:13:48,524
Oh don't you worry
hun, we're on our way.

1323
01:13:48,526 --> 01:13:50,400
You hear that,
she's in bad shape.

1324
01:13:50,402 --> 01:13:51,820
You better hurry.

1325
01:13:55,407 --> 01:13:57,160
Okay, come on girls.

1326
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:04,958
Oh that's insurance.

1327
01:14:12,467 --> 01:14:13,423
Well hey Mimi.

1328
01:14:13,425 --> 01:14:14,883
I'm here with His Majesty.

1329
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:15,717
Oh.

1330
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:17,093
Don't you remember,

1331
01:14:17,095 --> 01:14:18,553
I said I'd come by and make
a fish fry for all of you.

1332
01:14:18,555 --> 01:14:19,846
Of course we remember.

1333
01:14:19,848 --> 01:14:22,391
We were just going to the
Southern Bell Pie Shop

1334
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:25,226
to get dessert for after dinner.

1335
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:27,896
But you can come
on in and wait.

1336
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:29,398
Oh look at Travis.

1337
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,191
Cute as ever.

1338
01:14:33,487 --> 01:14:34,403
What's in the bag?

1339
01:14:34,405 --> 01:14:36,071
Oh it's full of money, honey.

1340
01:14:36,073 --> 01:14:40,661
She's just
kidding, she's just kidding.

1341
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:47,251
Something fishy
going on in there.

1342
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,547
Can I help you with those?

1343
01:14:53,549 --> 01:14:55,134
Oh, hi detective.

1344
01:14:56,469 --> 01:14:57,303
Sure.

1345
01:14:58,054 --> 01:14:59,345
What brings you by?

1346
01:14:59,347 --> 01:15:00,596
Just wanted to
check in on you,

1347
01:15:00,598 --> 01:15:02,931
make sure you're all right

1348
01:15:02,933 --> 01:15:04,432
I'm fine.

1349
01:15:04,434 --> 01:15:06,435
You got a little something.

1350
01:15:06,437 --> 01:15:07,271
Come on in.

1351
01:15:14,403 --> 01:15:15,237
Thank you.

1352
01:15:16,406 --> 01:15:17,738
Can I use the
little boys room?

1353
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,990
Oh yeah, it's
right over there.

1354
01:15:19,992 --> 01:15:21,576
I'll be right here.

1355
01:15:42,723 --> 01:15:45,474
Well that ain't
the little boys room.

1356
01:15:45,476 --> 01:15:46,768
Down the hall.

1357
01:15:51,816 --> 01:15:54,483
Okay girls, now here's
what we're gonna do.

1358
01:15:54,485 --> 01:15:55,860
We're gonna give Harry the money

1359
01:15:55,862 --> 01:15:58,361
and then we're gonna
get Bobby back.

1360
01:15:58,363 --> 01:15:59,821
What if that doesn't work?

1361
01:15:59,823 --> 01:16:01,990
Well, we'll just kill him.

1362
01:16:01,992 --> 01:16:04,952
Just like we did that guy in
the house, what was his name?

1363
01:16:04,954 --> 01:16:06,328
Oh, Stan.

1364
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:08,122
I hit him in the head with
the skillet and killed him.

1365
01:16:08,124 --> 01:16:10,541
I killed him, so stop
taking all the credit.

1366
01:16:10,543 --> 01:16:12,376
Oh Coralee, you
wanna keep score.

1367
01:16:12,378 --> 01:16:13,543
Yeah, I'm a good killer.

1368
01:16:13,545 --> 01:16:14,962
Now listen,

1369
01:16:14,964 --> 01:16:18,632
Harry's never seen me, so he
has no idea what I look like.

1370
01:16:18,634 --> 01:16:21,636
So we're gonna use misdirection.

1371
01:16:21,638 --> 01:16:23,471
You got it Mimi.

1372
01:16:23,473 --> 01:16:24,932
What's misdirection?

1373
01:16:30,854 --> 01:16:34,690
Well don't just stand there
silly, make yourself useful.

1374
01:16:34,692 --> 01:16:36,194
Pleased to help.

1375
01:16:38,862 --> 01:16:42,364
You know, we're like
a little family here.

1376
01:16:42,366 --> 01:16:45,117
Your ma spends a lot of
time here with Mimi, huh?

1377
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:47,953
Well, Mimi's kind
of lonely these days.

1378
01:16:47,955 --> 01:16:49,163
She a widow?

1379
01:16:49,165 --> 01:16:50,623
No kids?

1380
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:57,173
Yeah, you know I really
shouldn't be talking about them.

1381
01:16:57,173 --> 01:17:00,675
Her daughter Lisa, got
pregnant by that no good Rick,

1382
01:17:00,677 --> 01:17:03,511
and Mimi kind of talked
her into marrying him.

1383
01:17:03,513 --> 01:17:05,221
Well that didn't go so well,

1384
01:17:05,223 --> 01:17:07,931
Mimi's husband was kinda
able to keep him in check,

1385
01:17:07,933 --> 01:17:09,557
when he became
drunk and abusive,

1386
01:17:09,559 --> 01:17:10,976
but after he passed away,

1387
01:17:10,978 --> 01:17:14,896
Mimi just got scared
and backed down.

1388
01:17:14,898 --> 01:17:16,606
Sounds like a real asshole.

1389
01:17:16,608 --> 01:17:17,440
Yeah.

1390
01:17:17,442 --> 01:17:18,775
Pardon my french.

1391
01:17:18,777 --> 01:17:19,860
That's all right.

1392
01:17:19,862 --> 01:17:22,154
He was and he still is.

1393
01:17:22,156 --> 01:17:24,573
Lisa finally got up the
nerve to divorce him,

1394
01:17:24,575 --> 01:17:26,786
but she just blames Mimi.

1395
01:17:28,955 --> 01:17:31,331
It's sad.

1396
01:17:31,331 --> 01:17:35,128
Yeah it sure is.

1397
01:17:35,128 --> 01:17:37,544
Let me help you bread
some of your fish.

1398
01:17:37,546 --> 01:17:38,712
All right.

1399
01:17:38,714 --> 01:17:40,006
My hands are clean.

1400
01:17:40,008 --> 01:17:41,716
Good.

1401
01:17:55,689 --> 01:17:57,064
Your friends better
get here quick,

1402
01:17:57,066 --> 01:17:59,736
I'm getting tired of waiting.

1403
01:18:10,287 --> 01:18:11,121
What?

1404
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,957
You know, I've seen
a lot of you lately,

1405
01:18:14,959 --> 01:18:16,708
and I've been thinking.

1406
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,961
Why would you
wanna do that for?

1407
01:18:18,963 --> 01:18:21,547
You could really
use a makeover.

1408
01:18:21,549 --> 01:18:24,969
New hairstyle, new
wardrobe, the whole bit.

1409
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:28,178
Well I look just fine.

1410
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:32,099
When was the last time
you been with a woman?

1411
01:18:32,101 --> 01:18:35,144
When was the last time
you were with a man?

1412
01:18:35,146 --> 01:18:39,105
I'm old, wrinkled and
not long for this Earth,

1413
01:18:39,107 --> 01:18:41,984
my men were during the
Carter administration,

1414
01:18:41,986 --> 01:18:44,988
back when your
clothes were in style.

1415
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:51,788
Enough of you.

1416
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,127
You know, when Jim ran
over your daughter,

1417
01:19:00,129 --> 01:19:03,713
he should have waited
'til you were with her,

1418
01:19:03,715 --> 01:19:06,928
to kill two bitches's
with one stone.

1419
01:19:12,183 --> 01:19:16,977
Ava, I saw Mimi and her
friends leave,

1420
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:17,895
as I was arriving.

1421
01:19:17,897 --> 01:19:19,062
Where were they going?

1422
01:19:19,064 --> 01:19:23,275
Oh, to the pie shop to
bring back some dessert.

1423
01:19:23,277 --> 01:19:24,111
Pie shop.

1424
01:19:27,906 --> 01:19:31,369
Oh I saw Mimi, toting
a bowling ball bag,

1425
01:19:33,705 --> 01:19:35,870
she in some kind of league?

1426
01:19:35,872 --> 01:19:37,498
You know I asked
about that bag too

1427
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,166
and they dodged the question.

1428
01:19:39,168 --> 01:19:42,586
Mama said it was full of money.

1429
01:19:42,588 --> 01:19:43,796
Was she just joking?

1430
01:19:43,798 --> 01:19:47,800
Sure, they ain't got
no money like that.

1431
01:19:47,802 --> 01:19:48,635
Yeah.

1432
01:19:50,763 --> 01:19:51,597
Yeah.

1433
01:19:53,849 --> 01:19:56,809
Ava dear, I gotta get going.

1434
01:19:56,811 --> 01:19:59,060
What about the fish fry?

1435
01:19:59,062 --> 01:20:02,230
Oh, I gotta take
care of business.

1436
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:05,902
I'll be back real soon
for that fish fry.

1437
01:20:09,741 --> 01:20:10,992
Darn it.

1438
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:12,869
What did I do?

1439
01:20:25,505 --> 01:20:28,298
You girls, you know
what you're gonna do.

1440
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,132
Yes.

1441
01:20:29,134 --> 01:20:30,887
Okay, let's do it.

1442
01:20:47,653 --> 01:20:49,112
Let's go bowling.

1443
01:20:55,661 --> 01:20:59,039
We have the money,
show us Bobby.

1444
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:09,925
Toss me the bag.

1445
01:21:11,678 --> 01:21:12,929
Come on.

1446
01:21:17,976 --> 01:21:19,557
I know what you're thinking,

1447
01:21:19,559 --> 01:21:20,726
but y'all ain't fast enough

1448
01:21:20,728 --> 01:21:23,147
to hobble away
before I shoot you.

1449
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,961
Really?

1450
01:21:47,296 --> 01:21:48,130
Really?

1451
01:21:49,048 --> 01:21:52,093
They only do this in the movies.

1452
01:21:56,347 --> 01:21:58,221
Well I guess this is it.

1453
01:21:58,223 --> 01:22:02,184
'Cause I don't get the money
and y'all don't get to live.

1454
01:22:02,186 --> 01:22:03,727
I guess we all lose.

1455
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,287
Wait, wait I didn't
hear that, repeat that.

1456
01:22:21,289 --> 01:22:22,997
Old ladies with guns?

1457
01:22:22,999 --> 01:22:24,873
Yes,
they're shooting 'em too.

1458
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:27,376
I'm on my way,
get me some back up.

1459
01:22:27,378 --> 01:22:30,048
What in the hell is going on?

1460
01:22:32,342 --> 01:22:35,553
Hurry up gals, you
ain't got all day.

1461
01:22:59,952 --> 01:23:02,078
What the hells going on?

1462
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,870
Oh, our friend Bobby
she's been kidnapped

1463
01:23:03,872 --> 01:23:05,998
and Mimi's in a
shootout with this guy.

1464
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,292
Mimi, drop the gun.

1465
01:23:08,294 --> 01:23:12,797
Oh praise Jesus,
thank God you're here.

1466
01:23:12,799 --> 01:23:14,090
Drop the gun.

1467
01:23:14,092 --> 01:23:15,007
Okay.

1468
01:23:15,009 --> 01:23:16,135
Good girl.

1469
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:18,513
Police.

1470
01:23:19,597 --> 01:23:20,682
Drop the gun.

1471
01:23:37,991 --> 01:23:39,949
Well, well, well.

1472
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:42,120
If it isn't Harry Lovelace.

1473
01:23:50,335 --> 01:23:51,502
That was a stupid
stunt ladies,

1474
01:23:51,504 --> 01:23:53,712
you could've gotten
yourselves killed.

1475
01:23:53,714 --> 01:23:56,590
Next time, just call the police.

1476
01:23:56,592 --> 01:23:57,468
Detective.

1477
01:24:01,347 --> 01:24:04,681
I had nothing to do with
Jim's disappearance.

1478
01:24:04,683 --> 01:24:06,226
They killed him.

1479
01:24:07,228 --> 01:24:11,107
Who said anything about
Jim's disappearance?

1480
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:15,985
Open the trunk.

1481
01:24:15,987 --> 01:24:17,528
Why detective?

1482
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,282
I said, open it.

1483
01:24:19,948 --> 01:24:21,449
Do you have a warrant?

1484
01:24:21,451 --> 01:24:24,200
I'll impound the
car and get one.

1485
01:24:24,202 --> 01:24:25,453
Come on, let's open it.

1486
01:24:25,455 --> 01:24:29,539
Coralee, grab that
handle in there, come on.

1487
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:31,292
If he has to see it,
he has to see it.

1488
01:24:31,294 --> 01:24:33,209
All right,
he's gonna see it.

1489
01:24:33,211 --> 01:24:36,129
There it is
detective, clean as a whistle.

1490
01:24:40,385 --> 01:24:41,552
Detective,

1491
01:24:41,554 --> 01:24:43,721
you're gonna want to
come and see this.

1492
01:24:43,723 --> 01:24:53,566
It's pretty gruesome.

1493
01:24:53,566 --> 01:24:56,441
There's at least two
chopped up bodies in here.

1494
01:24:56,443 --> 01:25:00,572
It's gonna be like putting
together a jigsaw puzzle.

1495
01:25:05,827 --> 01:25:09,704
Chopping up more than car
parts these days, huh Harry.

1496
01:25:09,706 --> 01:25:10,540
No.

1497
01:25:11,416 --> 01:25:14,377
You bitches, you set me up!

1498
01:25:14,379 --> 01:25:15,543
No!

1499
01:25:15,545 --> 01:25:17,712
You think you can drag me to
the eighth circle of Hell?

1500
01:25:17,714 --> 01:25:21,385
I'll be back, I'll be
back, I'll get y'all.

1501
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:29,516
Somehow, something
smells fishy.

1502
01:25:29,518 --> 01:25:31,560
Is there something
you're not telling me?

1503
01:25:31,562 --> 01:25:36,856
Oh detective, we're just a
group of little old ladies.

1504
01:25:36,858 --> 01:25:39,025
We're completely harmless.

1505
01:25:39,027 --> 01:25:40,110
Right.

1506
01:25:40,112 --> 01:25:41,236
I can't wait to get home

1507
01:25:41,238 --> 01:25:43,571
and have a nice home
cooked meal again.

1508
01:25:43,573 --> 01:25:48,034
That bastards been force
feeding sandwiches for days.

1509
01:25:48,036 --> 01:25:50,037
Bobby, it's all right now.

1510
01:25:50,039 --> 01:25:53,293
Ava's fixing us a
real nice fish fry.

1511
01:25:54,544 --> 01:25:58,337
Oh and detective, we'd
just love to have you come.

1512
01:25:58,339 --> 01:26:01,090
Thank you kindly Mimi,
but some other time.

1513
01:26:01,092 --> 01:26:02,593
Police work calls.

1514
01:26:04,344 --> 01:26:06,595
You take care now.

1515
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:08,765
Bye.

1516
01:26:08,765 --> 01:26:10,181
Okay girls, get in.

1517
01:26:10,183 --> 01:26:11,600
I'll drop you off at my house,

1518
01:26:11,602 --> 01:26:15,689
and then I have to go and do
something really important.

1519
01:26:29,036 --> 01:26:32,288
Thank you
for coming in, bye.

1520
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,124
Lisa.

1521
01:26:34,082 --> 01:26:35,833
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1522
01:26:35,835 --> 01:26:37,168
I don't have time right now.

1523
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:38,918
Oh just for a minute.

1524
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:41,758
Well, well, well.

1525
01:26:41,758 --> 01:26:44,132
Look who we have here.

1526
01:26:44,134 --> 01:26:46,345
The ex-bitch and her mom.

1527
01:26:47,472 --> 01:26:48,803
Leave me alone Rick.

1528
01:26:48,805 --> 01:26:50,847
Yeah, leave her alone.

1529
01:26:50,849 --> 01:26:52,141
Oh yeah.

1530
01:26:52,143 --> 01:26:56,606
Well, I'm gonna do and
say whatever I want.

1531
01:26:56,606 --> 01:26:58,271
Oh no you're not.

1532
01:26:58,273 --> 01:27:01,652
You beer guzzling bastard.

1533
01:27:01,652 --> 01:27:04,861
You touch my daughter and you're
gonna have to deal with me,

1534
01:27:04,863 --> 01:27:07,989
and I'm not the same
person you dealt with.

1535
01:27:07,991 --> 01:27:10,284
You cheap sack of shit.

1536
01:27:10,286 --> 01:27:13,119
Now take your beer
and get out of here.

1537
01:27:13,121 --> 01:27:17,250
I said get you son of a bitch.

1538
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:19,253
Sorry kid.

1539
01:27:25,134 --> 01:27:31,515
Thank you mama.

1540
01:27:31,515 --> 01:27:33,934
Can I see my grandson now?

1541
01:27:35,812 --> 01:27:36,771
Of course.

1542
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,292
Someone's at the door.

1543
01:27:59,294 --> 01:28:00,167
I'll be right back.

1544
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:13,388
Hello detective.

1545
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:17,560
Well, well, well, what
brings you here, detective?

1546
01:28:17,562 --> 01:28:19,770
Well, I don't want
you to be alarmed,

1547
01:28:19,772 --> 01:28:22,400
but I have some troubling news.

1548
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:26,360
Harry Lovelace escaped
the county jail

1549
01:28:26,362 --> 01:28:28,570
where he was awaiting trial.

1550
01:28:28,572 --> 01:28:30,780
And considering the
threat he made to you

1551
01:28:30,782 --> 01:28:35,328
when he was arrested, I
thought I should warn you.

1552
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:38,204
Oh, that's so sweet
of you detective,

1553
01:28:38,206 --> 01:28:41,419
but you don't need
to worry about us.

1554
01:28:42,586 --> 01:28:45,671
Us girls can take
of ourselves, right.

1555
01:28:45,673 --> 01:28:47,506
We sure can.

1556
01:28:47,508 --> 01:28:49,633
Detective why don't you
come and stay for a while?

1557
01:28:49,635 --> 01:28:51,636
Yeah, sit down
and have some tea and pie

1558
01:28:51,638 --> 01:28:53,178
and play a couple
of round of rummy.

1559
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:55,056
Well I guess I
got a few minutes.

1560
01:28:55,058 --> 01:28:57,141
Coralee, why don't you
go and get them ice cream

1561
01:28:57,143 --> 01:28:59,060
from the freezer, go ahead.

1562
