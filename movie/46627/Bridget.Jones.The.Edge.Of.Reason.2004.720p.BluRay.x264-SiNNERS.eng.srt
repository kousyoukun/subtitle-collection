Once again I was summoned,

00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:28,555
to my mother's turkey curry buffet,

00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:32,812

shaming experiences of my life.

It was, as usual, crammed full

8
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:43,994
with some of the most dangerous perverts
in the UK,

9
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:47,200
disguised as close, personal friends
of my parents.

- Oh, no, thanks.
- Love the jumper.

there was one crucial difference.

17
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:17,185
- Nice jumper.
- My mother's taste never falters.

Be as late as you like.

I only said he was working late.

Even if he isn't shagging her already,
he's thinking about it.

00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:06,273
Rubbish. Mark's above all that nonsense.

158
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:09,317
Jellyfisher alert. Jellyfisher alert.

159
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:15,450
[Bridget] Janey Osborne.
Talking to her is like swimming in a sea

160
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:18,871
and being stung repeatedly
by an enormous jellyfish.

161
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:23,750
Bridget. How's it going
with that divine man of yours?

162
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:26,840
You must be so pleased
to have a boyfriend at last.

163
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,964
First jellyfish of the evening.

164
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,460
Is he taking you
to the Law Council Dinner?

165
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:33,962
Oh. Well, I'm sure he's just forgotten.

166
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,595
Better start slimming into that dress.

167
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:41,095
He's given you the night off
to cheer up your single friends. Sweet.

168
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:46,146
Actually, he's got a big case on, trying
to get everyone in Mexico out of prison.

169
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,106
We're meeting for a very late
romantic dinner.

170
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,686
Really? That's so odd,

171
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:55,732
'cause I saw him an hour ago going
into his house with Rebecca Gillies.

172
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:59,076
She's only 22.
She's got legs up to here.

173
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:01,572
And Daddy owns half of Australia.

174
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,875
See ya, babes.

175
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:13,462
Who is Rebecca Gillies? What's she doing
going into my boyfriend's house?

176
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:16,921
Where he never asks me.
And with legs up to here?

177
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:20,880
- My legs only come up to there.
- [Jude] You have fine legs.

178
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:23,052
Climber's legs.

179
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:25,933
I say go over there and ask him,
straight out,

180
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:29,105
are you or are you not
sleeping with Rebecca Gillies?

181
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:33,226
- [Shazzer] If he says...
- I won't dignify that with an answer...

182
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:35,397
Then you know he's shagging her.

183
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:39,901
¡ò All that I have
is all that you've given...

184
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,241
[Bridget] It's all about confidence and
trust. Mark would never betray me.

185
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,783
Everything will be lovely
and we'll have sex in the kitchen.

186
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,036
- Oh, God.
- [woman inside] I'm coming.

187
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:54,704
Oh, God! What is that?

188
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:57,421
[woman] Two seconds,
I'll be straight down.

189
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:59,586
Who is that?

190
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:02,432
¡ò...I find you lied

191
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,885
¡ò And I can't believe it's true

192
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:12,052
¡ò Wrapped in her arms
I see you across the street

193
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:14,641
¡ò I see you across the street

194
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:21,236
¡ò And I can't help but wonder
If she knows what's going on

195
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,829
¡ò You talk of love
But don't know how it feels

196
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,745
¡ò When you realise

197
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,457
¡ò You're not the only one

198
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,291
[Mark] Let's get on with it.

199
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:41,669
¡ò...oh, you better stop

200
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,252
- ¡ò Stop
- ¡ò Before

201
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,100
¡ò You tear me all apart

202
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,305
¡ò You better stop

203
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:52,595
- ¡ò Stop...
- You are a very demanding man.

204
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:55,855
- ¡ò...you go and break my heart...
- [Bridget yelps]

205
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:03,029
[chuckles] Bridget Jones.

206
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,321
No, I'm Bridget Jones.

207
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:08,327
- [chuckles] That's what I meant.
- You must be...

208
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:11,863
Rebecca Gillies. I've been
so looking forward to meeting you

209
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,158
- after everything Mark's told me.
- Why? What's he said?

210
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,458
- Where is Mark?
- Actually, er...

211
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:21,465
- [Mark] Becky, who is it?
- Becky?

212
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:24,204
- Right.
- Great.

213
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:27,126
- Right...
- Bridget.

214
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:31,464
Hello, Mark.

215
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:39,894
[laughs nervously] Hello...

216
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:43,066
Iawyers who work with Mark.

217
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:45,359
[all] Good evening.

218
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:48,615
Everything under control, I see.

219
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:51,238
Um... Excellent graph.

220
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:55,569
- Lovely legs.
- Thank you.

221
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:57,823
[lawyers chat]

222
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,120
I am so sorry.

223
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,999
I thought...
Oh, I don't know what I thought.

224
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:11,169
Now you're really angry with me.

225
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:14,382
- No, I'm not.
- It's OK, you can say if you are.

226
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:17,973
- It's not the end of the world.
- I'll get you a glass of wine.

227
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:21,850
The thing is I ran into Janey Osborne,

228
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:27,146
who said she'd just seen you
with this girl, with really long legs,

229
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,399
and Shazzer and Jude said
I should get over here straightaway.

230
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:35,405
Following the orders of the dating
war command, you executed a raid.

231
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:38,364
- You are angry.
- I'm not, just disappointed.

232
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:42,203
Disappointed?
Oh, God, that's worse than angry.

233
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:47,878
I'm just disappointed
I can't take you home this instant.

234
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:53,465
Oh. [chuckles]
What about all those lawyers?

235
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:57,800
Oh, plenty of time to butter them up
at the Law Council Dinner next Friday.

236
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:09,270
Don't want to go, do you?

237
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:11,186
I'd love to.

238
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,780
Oh, stupid Bridget, stupid friends.

239
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:22,621
Wonderful, loyal Mark Darcy...

240
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,744
...who loves me just the way I am.

241

[Bridget pants]

243
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,061
- [Mark] What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.

244
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,646
Why are you dancing around in that tent?

245
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:05,445
[sighs] Because I don't want you to see
any of my wobbly bits.

246
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:09,571
That's pointless, because I have
a very high regard for your wobbly bits

247
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,743
in all circumstances.

248
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,911
- Really?
- Absolutely.

249
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:16,918
I think it's high time
we had another look.

250
00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:20,050
¡ò Yeah

251
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,545
¡ò Are you digging on me?

252
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:25,511
¡ò Yeah

253
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:28,923
¡ò I'm digging on you, now, baby

254
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:30,345
¡ò Yeah

255
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,929
¡ò Do you want a little bit of my love?

256
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:35,137
¡ò Yeah...

257
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:39,100
[Bridget]
He really is very, very, very nice.

258
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:42,521
¡ò All the time I knew

259
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:44,322
¡ò That you loved me

260
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,948
¡ò And you promised me...

261
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,195
I miss you too.

262
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:54,411
¡ò That you would be my only man

263
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:55,781
¡ò Yeah

264
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:59,328
¡ò Are you digging on me?

265
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,383
[Bridget] I've never been happier
in my entire life.

266
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:06,753
However, must not obsess or fantasise.

267
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,381
Bridget Darcy.

268
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:12,596
Mrs Darcy.

269
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,892
Mr and Mrs Darcy.

270
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:17,469
Lord and Lady Darcy.

271
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:23,269
Wonder what Mark Darcy
would be like as a father.

272
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:25,816
To his children, I mean, not to me.

273
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,906
That would be a weird,
Oedipus-like thought.

274
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:32,112
At last, life is on track.

275
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:35,820
Bridget Jones: fiancee, wife...

276

mother.

Bugger.

278
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:43,371
[man] Ever fancied doing it in the dark
with a total stranger?

279
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:50,623
All right, perhaps not a total stranger.

280
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:56,303
Back off, Cleaver, or I'll report you
to a sexual harassment tribunal.

281
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:57,935
I'm a serious journalist.

282
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,558
Is that your most serious skirt, Jones?

283
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:02,273
Oh...

284
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,313
Do you like it?

285
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:06,809
I thought you hated television.

286
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:10,272
I hate watching television.
Being on it is... Hello there.

287
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,440
...entirely different.

288
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:16,615
Daniel, thought the Madrid piece
was outstanding, really original.

289
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,737
Cheers, Jeremy. Appreciate that.
We had to work really hard on that one.

290
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:24,035
Tosser. Talking of which,
how is Mark Darcy?

291
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,668
- You still...?
- Yes, I am.

292
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,246
And I intend to be for a very long time.

293
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:34,125
Good. You know what a fan I am
of any woman married to Mark Darcy.

294
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:37,553
- That's not funny.
- Seriously, though, Jones,

295
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:40,510
speaking purely unselfishly,
I worry about you.

296
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:45,140
You do know that it's a fact that
most lawyer's wives die of boredom?

297
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:49,355
And what about you?
Still shagging anything that moves?

298
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:52,772
As a matter of fact, no.
No shagging whatsoever.

299
00:19:52,947 --> 00:19:55,152
I'm in shag therapy.

300
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:59,487
It turns out I have a problem. I go
to meetings, talk about my feelings.

301
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:01,700
Hug people who smell.

302
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:04,577
- I don't believe you.
- I'm trying...

303
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,992
...to be a better man, Bridge,

304
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,086
so that the next time
a better woman comes along,

305
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:13,291
I won't make a pig's ear of it.

306
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:16,376
Daniel. Meeting?

307
00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:19,087
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

308
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:22,882
Very good hair, Jones.

309
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:28,845
By the way, um, you're not free
for dinner tonight, are you?

310
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:32,722
No, I'm not.
I'm going to the Law Council Dinner.

311
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:35,356
It's a very important evening.

312
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,279
[¡ò Kylie Minogue:
Can't Get You Out Of My Head]

313
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:41,232
I can't wear that.

314
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,620
Bridge, do you want to get married and
have babies before you become barren?

315
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,903
Trust me...

316
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,995
[Bridget] Magda: my only grown-up
friend. Married to Mark's partner.

317
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,036
She actually got engaged
on the night of the Law Council Dinner.

318
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:57,206
Try it with the dress.

319
00:20:57,383 --> 00:20:58,757
Oh, my God!

320
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:02,839
Remember, we are trying to reduce
your body size by 1 5 per cent.

321
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:06,346
You hold the front, I'll hold the back.
One, two, three...

322
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:08,889
[Bridget whimpers]

323
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,895
- [Bridget shrieks]
- What's going on in there?

324
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:14,522
Not too bad, actually.

325
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,233
Tra-la!

326
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,443
Fantastic.

327
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,862
Right, let us begin.

328
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:28,195
I am going to make you into a princess.

329
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,485
Goody.

330
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,364
[Bridget] Nothing like being
in the hands of a total genius.

331
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,911
[whooshing]

332
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,911
Wow.

333
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,835
- [Jude on phone] Whatever you do...
- Bugger it.

334
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,049
...don't iron your hair.

335
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,053
[Jude] It's a lot worse than I thought.

336
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,299
We could flatten it with Brylcreem.

337
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,847
What about a wig? Lawyers love wigs.

338
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:58,348
- I preferred you in the gold.
- No, whatever you do, not the gold.

339
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:03,315
Great. I'm late with mad hair and can
barely breathe in scary knickers.

340
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,069
¡ò La la la
La la la la la...

341
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:09,777
[Bridget] Oh, God. I'm very worried.

342
00:22:09,952 --> 00:22:15,026
What if someone says "Bridget Jones,
get out of here, you are ridiculous"?

343
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,825
Stop it.

344
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:22,376
The most important thing, of course,
is to look absolutely wonderful

345
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:25,215
and make a magnificent entrance.

346
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:28,632
¡ò I just can't get you out of my head...

347
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:31,009
[chatter]

348
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:37,092
[violins]

349
00:22:37,604 --> 00:22:40,639
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

350
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:45,146
- Hello.
- I think you should go to the ladies.

351
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,938
But I went before I left home.

352
00:22:48,864 --> 00:22:50,605
Trust me on this one.

353
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,024
[gasps] Oh.

354
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:55,192
Not good.

355
00:22:56,873 --> 00:22:59,243
[thinks]
All right, tiny make-up mistake,

356
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:04,326
but I always have wit and conversation
to fall back on.

357
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,461
Thank you.

358
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:19,513
- Bridget.
- Hello.

359
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:22,890
Derek, Horatio, Camilla.

360
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:26,264
- Horatio?
- Yes, Horatio.

361
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:30,224
Horatio was just saying
he's totally against charitable giving.

362
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:32,395
[laughs]

363
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:36,067
- What?
- Well, obviously you don't mean it.

364
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:40,783
Absolutely. Do you think it's helpful
to give a beggar fifty pence?

365
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:43,991
- Maybe he's just hungry.
- Don't be so naive.

366
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:48,033
The people you see outside the tube
every day are there by choice.

367
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:51,211
- End of story.
- Oh, no, it's not.

368
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:54,001
Some people
have terrible personal problems,

369
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:59,085
and other people might have lost their
family in some tragic ferry disaster.

370
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:02,929
And some people are just plain hopeless.

371
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:07,976
Honestly, this is the sort of rubbish
you'd expect from fat, balding

372
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:14,183
Tory, Home Counties,
upper-middle-class twits.

373
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:15,475
[music stops]

374
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:19,607
- [chatter resumes]
- [laughs uneasily]

375
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:24,116
[violins, chatter]

376
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,743
[man] Yeah, very good.
Tested my resolve.

377
00:24:33,463 --> 00:24:35,086
How did I do?

378
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:38,091
You seem to have made
quite an impression.

379
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:41,125
I've put you next to Giles Benwick.

380
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:44,719
- Oh, I'm not sitting next to you?
- No. He's terribly nice,

381
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:48,508
but his wife's just run off
with one of the partners.

382
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,521
He probably won't mention it,
but you should know.

383
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:54,558
I always knew she was out of my league.

384
00:24:54,733 --> 00:25:00,852
You see, there's the high-fliers,
like Annabel and Mark Darcy

385
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:05,774
and there's the gorgeous girls,
like Rebecca there

386
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:08,407
and there's the rest of us.

387
00:25:10,624 --> 00:25:13,292
Like you and me, you mean?

388
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,498
Absolutely.

389
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,835
I mean, look at the state of us.

390
00:25:19,715 --> 00:25:24,422
You and me stumbled into the VlP room
by mistake

391
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:28,177
and it's only a matter of moments
before they show us the door.

392
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:33,633
[pounding]

393
00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:39,524
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
let the quiz begin.

394
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:43,776
[laughs] Oh, goody. I love quizzes.

395
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:48,106
All those years of playing
Trivial Pursuits are about to pay off.

396
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:53,782
Now I want to see your hands
poised over those bells. Ready?

397
00:25:53,956 --> 00:25:57,655
Here we go. What are something
called "customary freeholds"?

398
00:25:57,835 --> 00:26:01,036
- [bell]
- [man] Superior copyhold.

399
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:02,457
[speaker] Yes.

400
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:05,381
What is the correct grace
used in the lnner Temple

401
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:09,001
for the second mooting night
of Michaelmas term?

402
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,342
- [bell]
- [man] Amas bibendo... fructis.

403
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:16,765
Jolly good.
What is an overreaching conveyance?

404
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:20,137
What is rack-rent?
When was breach of promise abolished?

405
00:26:20,315 --> 00:26:22,353
Define "damnum sentit dominus".

406
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:27,683
Translate "reddendo singula singulis"
into Ancient Greek.

407
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:30,068
I believe this is the answer.

408
00:26:30,242 --> 00:26:31,651
[bell]

409
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:35,608
Hippodamoi credemnon louestai.

410
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:38,906
- [speaker] Absolutely correct.
- [applause]

411
00:26:42,878 --> 00:26:46,625
[speaker] Now, for our final
and deciding round,

412
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,379
the category is contemporary culture.

413
00:26:50,552 --> 00:26:52,045
[murmuring]

414
00:26:52,221 --> 00:26:55,636
Who did the design
for Princess Diana's wedding dress?

415
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:59,172
- [bell]
- The Emmanuels.

416
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:01,758
- Correct.
- Excellent, Bridget.

417
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:04,972
Name the character in Footballers' Wives

418
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:10,900
who, in one memorable episode,
set fire to her own breasts.

419
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:12,445
- [bell]
- Chardonnay.

420
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:14,606
- [speaker] Correct.
- [applause]

421
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:19,950
At this point,
there are only two tables in contention

422
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:22,576
and only one question left.

423
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:28,119
What was the name of Madonna's
first UK single?

424
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:30,701
- [bell]
- [Bridget quietly] Lucky Star.

425
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:34,083
- [speaker] Sorry, I didn't quite hear.
- Are you sure?

426
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,343
- Wasn't it Holiday?
- No, everyone thinks it is,

427
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:38,709
but it's not.

428
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:41,888
My entire life has been leading up
to this very moment.

429
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:46,221
Take that knife, slice off my head
and boil it if I'm wrong.

430
00:27:47,189 --> 00:27:50,023
The correct answer is Lucky Star.

431
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:54,560
- No.
- [groans of disappointment]

432
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:57,524
- The correct answer is...
- Is it Holiday?

433
00:27:57,699 --> 00:28:00,698
- [speaker] Holiday, indeed, yes.
- [applause]

434
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:07,744
[speaker] The winners of
the 42nd Annual Law Council Quiz are...

435
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:10,074
the Legal Eagles.

436
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:12,243
[cheering]

437
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:18,965
- Lovely to see you, Bridget.
- Oh, thanks, Rebecca.

438
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:21,127
Good night.

439
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:38,734
[horn]

440
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:41,525
[Bridget]
Why didn't you speak to me all night?

441
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:44,023
[Mark]
That's the point of those dinners.

442
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:47,865
But you talked to Rebecca.
And you talked to Horatio.

443
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:52,240
I'll never fit in with your friends.

444
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:56,626
Not if you go on calling everyone
"balding, upper-middle-class twits".

445
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:59,997
Well, they were balding,
upper-middle-class twits.

446
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:02,331
Except for the ones who had hair.

447
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:06,794
I suppose you agree with them
that poor people deserve to be poor?

448
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:08,964
Don't be ridiculous.

449
00:29:09,142 --> 00:29:12,806
- So now I'm ridiculous?
- Yes, tonight you were a little.

450
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:15,433
Well, tonight you were an arrogant arse.

451
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:20,977
I think I may have
made a mistake inviting you

452
00:29:21,153 --> 00:29:23,689
and your folding underpants
into my life.

453
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:28,608
Good night.

454
00:29:32,664 --> 00:29:34,786
If you had asked me tonight,

455
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,987
I'd have said no, anyway.

456
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:42,245
Asked you what?

457
00:29:42,423 --> 00:29:45,042
- Bridget?
- [sirens nearby]

458
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:47,209
Asked you what?

459
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:00,891
[Bridget] Oh, God, I've done it.

460
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,187
I've gone and done it.

461
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,439
One minute, you're closer to someone
than anyone in the whole world,

462
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:10,697
next minute,
you're never going to see them again.

463
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:23,582

[rings]

465
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:33,417
[Mark] If you have a message for
Mark Darcy, please speak after the tone.

466

00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:39,052
Hello, it's me.
I'm really, really sorry...

468
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:40,802
[buzzer]

469
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:43,136
Sorry, it's the door.

470
00:30:43,313 --> 00:30:46,930
Don't go away, I have something
really, really important to say.

471
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:57,062
[buzzer]

472
00:30:57,953 --> 00:31:00,489
- Yes, who is it?
- [Mark] It's me.

473
00:31:00,664 --> 00:31:03,414
- Mark.
- Oh, right.

474
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,788
Er, just a moment.

475
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:08,619
I'm on the phone.

476
00:31:08,796 --> 00:31:10,787
[alarm]

477
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:14,339
[laughs] You're outside.

478
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:17,466
Look, er,...

479
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,214
I'll ring you later.

480
00:31:21,684 --> 00:31:25,099
Unless you've come to chuck me
once and for all.

481
00:31:25,562 --> 00:31:27,553
In which case,

482
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:31,941
bye and thank you,
and... sorry.

483
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,568
[buzzer]

484
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:35,860
Oh, God, please don't chuck me.

485
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,735
If you have chucked me,
please change your mind,

486
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:40,946
I'll behave much better in future.

487
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,609
- [buzzer]
- On the other hand, if you haven't,

488
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:47,321
please behave better
next time we go out. Stuck-up snob.

489
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,071
[beep]

490
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:56,298
What do you want?

491
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:59,419
I'd like to come up.
You are, after all, my girlfriend.

492
00:31:59,595 --> 00:32:02,927
Even though I shouted at you
and called you an arrogant arse?

493
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:06,384
Unfortunately, yes.
You see, the problematic thing is...

494
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,511
I love you.

495
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:12,974
W-what?

496
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:26,907
- I said I love you.
- I'm sorry, I missed that again.

497
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,035
I said I love you, for God's sake!

498
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,114
[all jeer]

499
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:37,127
All right, no need to shout.

500
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:39,336
I'll come down and let you in.

501
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,589
[all cheer]

502
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,381
You might be needing this in the future.

503
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,687
He said he loves me.

504
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:07,861
- [Tom] He said he loves you?
- He said he loves me.

505
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:11,946
- Right, where is he now?
- [whispers] He's in the bedroom.

506
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:15,155
Go back in there, Bridge,

507
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:19,543
and whatever you do,
act completely nonchalant.

508
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:26,997
Bridget, you're staring at me again.

509
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:29,297
Sorry.

510
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:34,305
Listen, I know this evening
didn't go exactly as planned,

511
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:40,135
but there was a very important question
I wanted to ask you tonight.

512
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,640
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

513
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:47,395
[takes deep breath]

514
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:50,940
I've actually been meaning
to ask this for quite some time.

515
00:33:51,117 --> 00:33:54,983
I've just never really found
the right way to put it.

516
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:01,532
Darling Bridget...

517
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:05,878
...would you...

518
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,704
...Iike to go on a skiing mini-break?

519
00:34:14,223 --> 00:34:15,716
Yes!

520
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:21,263
¡ò What the world...

521
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:23,843
[Bridget] This is not just a mini-break.

522
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:28,314
This is a holiday in heaven.

523
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:34,741
Told a tiny lie about being
an extremely experienced skier.

524
00:34:35,744 --> 00:34:38,494
But, honestly, how hard can it be?

525
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:41,576
- Ah.
- Shall we?

526
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:50,918
[Bridget[
I know I'm going to like skiing a lot.

527
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:53,925
Very romantic, very relaxing.

528
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,135
- Bar going up.
- No. What? Why?

529
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,049
[Bridget whimpers]

530
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,225
Um...

531
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:07,354
Er...

532
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,513
Oh. Oh, God.

533
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:11,433
[whimpers]

534
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,359
Oh, God. Oh.

535
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,444
[groans]

536
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,157
Ah.

537
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,875
[screams]

538
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,632
Bridget.

539
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,218
Rebecca. What are you doing here?

540
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:45,757
- Didn't Mark tell you we were coming?
- No, he didn't.

541
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:48,091
It was me who recommended the place.

542
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,020
- I've been coming since I was 1 1.
- Really?

543
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,766
[thinks] Three whole years.

544
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,147
Come on, up you get.

545
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,060
Come on.

546
00:35:58,029 --> 00:36:00,353
- There you go.
- Are you all right?

547
00:36:01,574 --> 00:36:03,363
Yes, fine, thanks.

548
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:05,858
- You sure?
- Why is Rebecca here?

549
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:09,285
Oh, God. Well, I mentioned
that we were coming

550
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:13,500
and she said why didn't they come too,
and I couldn't say no, could l?

551
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,124
Come on, you two, let's crack on,
shall we?

552
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:20,338
Actually, I might just sit this one out.
You head on.

553
00:36:20,509 --> 00:36:22,915
- See you down there.
- You sure?

554
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:25,335
Absolutely. I'll be fine in a minute.

555
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,003
Right, I'll see you at base camp, then.

556
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:34,720
[thinks] Bastard.
I can't believe he's left me.

557
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:39,723
Ooh.

558
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:49,326
Oooh.

559
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:04,374
[thinks] So, romantic getaway
has turned into lawyer's reunion.

560
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:06,044
Oooh.

561
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:09,302
I can't believe
we're already into group holidays

562
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:12,804
after only eight weeks
of total, undisturbed sex.

563
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:15,467
Wait a minute...

564
00:37:15,644 --> 00:37:18,050
No. Eight weeks?

565
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:20,637
It couldn't be, could it?

566
00:37:20,816 --> 00:37:22,938
Totally undisturbed...

567
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,395
Oh, God. I'm pregnant.

568
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,065
[whines]

569
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:30,947
[screams]

570
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:33,156
And going to die!

571
00:37:34,204 --> 00:37:36,195
[cheering]

572
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,251
[screams]

573
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:50,627
[screams] Oh, my God!

574
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:52,754
I can't see!

575
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:55,086
[screams] Big bump!

576
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:57,388
Get out of the way!

577
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,549
[screams]

578
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,598
Who's this? An eccentric
but exhilarating performance

579
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:04,935
from a total unknown,

580
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:08,441
who's now solidly in position
for the bronze.

581
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,861
- [screams]
- [bell clangs]

582
00:38:21,957 --> 00:38:23,746
[whines]

583
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:36,216
I would like a pregnancy test, please.

584
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:39,008
A pregnancy test.

585
00:38:39,391 --> 00:38:43,008
Ich bien, er, possibly...

586
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:44,975
mit baby.

587
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:48,014
Er...

588
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,481
Kinder! I am on back...

589
00:38:52,653 --> 00:38:54,858
and he, er,...

590
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:58,861
maken ze lieben.
Er, with me.

591
00:39:00,744 --> 00:39:02,153
[German] She's pregnant!

592
00:39:04,164 --> 00:39:06,404
Oh, no! No, no, not pregnant.

593
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:09,248
[German] She's bloated.

594
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:11,291
- Condom?
- Nein. Nein, nein.

595
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:14,415
Maybe like this, but maybe like this.

596
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,254
[German]
I think her problem is psychological.

597
00:39:18,427 --> 00:39:20,998
[German] There is nothing
a pill can do to help her.

598
00:39:21,181 --> 00:39:23,967
I'm a girl and I met a boy.

599
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:27,426
Fraulein, and I met frau... boy.

600
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,430
And possibly now mit baby, uh-huh?

601
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,436
Right, moment of truth awaits.

602
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:43,608
What if I am pregnant?

603
00:39:44,452 --> 00:39:46,858
I must try not to get hopes up too high.

604
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:50,121
Boyfriend and baby seems just too lucky.

605
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:53,540
Bridget? I have been looking
everywhere for you.

606
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:57,790
I thought you'd broken a leg
or something... Oh, God.

607
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:05,846
- You're not...?
- I might be.

608
00:40:07,891 --> 00:40:11,555
- What if I were?
- Well, I suppose l'd...

609
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:17,437
To be quite frank,
it'd be bloody fantastic.

610
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:20,395
I mean, if a little ahead of schedule.

611
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:24,482
- Are you really pregnant?
- Well, give it three minutes.

612
00:40:35,376 --> 00:40:39,869
- What do you fancy? Boy or a girl?
- I dunno, it doesn't matter.

613
00:40:40,923 --> 00:40:44,171
Although, I suppose I've always had
the fantasy of a son.

614
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:49,343
- Another Mark Darcy.
- Or maybe something like Huck.

615
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:53,344
Or River. Or some fabulous
Hebrew name like Noah.

616
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:56,933
Anyway, I could teach him
to play cricket and rugby

617
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:59,392
and visit him at Eton
on St Andrew's Day.

618
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:00,595
Eton?

619
00:41:00,774 --> 00:41:04,901
Yes. The Darcy men have been going
to Eton for five generations.

620
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:08,776
Well, my son's not going to be
sent away from home.

621
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:13,195
Especially to some fascist institution
where they stick a poker up your arse

622
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,859
that you're never allowed
to remove again.

623
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:18,864
I see.

624
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,867
- I didn't mean you.
- No, of course not.

625
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:25,210
So what's the alternative?
Sleeping in his parents' bed,

626
00:41:25,381 --> 00:41:27,419
breastfeeding until he's a teenager

627
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:32,132
and some progressive school, where the
day is spent singing Yellow Submarine?

628
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:33,962
Oh, you're absolutely right.

629
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:38,430
It's madness to allow a child to enjoy
his education or live with his parents.

630
00:41:38,602 --> 00:41:42,551
What is madness is to have a child
if his parents can't have a discussion

631
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:44,686
without one shouting at the other.

632
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:46,055
It's negative.

633
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:48,689
- That's too bad.
- Yes, very sad.

634
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:27,346
Perhaps we should go out for lunch
tomorrow. Get out of the grump.

635
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:33,935
That's a good idea in theory,
but you made a family arrangement.

636
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:37,027
Oh, God.

637
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,775
[doorbell]

638
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:40,147
Darlings!

639
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:43,279
I've had the fabulous idea
of inviting your parents.

640
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:46,539
[Bridget] Another one
of Mother's culinary triumphs.

641
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:50,408
- Everything in miniature.
- Mini treacle tart, Admiral Darcy?

642
00:42:50,587 --> 00:42:54,631
No, no, thank you. The mini spotted dick
rather finished me off.

643
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:56,173
[polite laughter]

644
00:42:58,053 --> 00:43:01,965
So, Mark, Bridget, when are you
two lovebirds going to name the day?

645
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,972
Bridget, you must want to hear
those ding-dong bells.

646
00:43:12,734 --> 00:43:16,813
Well, we're certainly not thinking
about that yet. Are we, Bridget?

647
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:19,609
No. God, no.

648
00:43:19,782 --> 00:43:21,654
Of course not.

649
00:43:21,824 --> 00:43:24,278
[Mr Jones] Good.
Well, that's that sorted.

650
00:43:24,452 --> 00:43:27,071
So, Admiral, out on the high seas.
How was it?

651
00:43:42,594 --> 00:43:45,629
- Did you mean that thing you said?
- What thing?

652
00:43:45,805 --> 00:43:49,338
- You know what thing.
- No, I don't know what thing.

653
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:52,260
The thing thing.

654
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:56,104
Now, let's see, there are any number
of things, um...

655
00:43:56,275 --> 00:43:58,681
in an afternoon full
of all sorts of things,

656
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,732
so l, um,...

657
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:05,444
The thing where you said
you're not, um,...

658
00:44:08,328 --> 00:44:13,568
That you're not,
not even thinking about, um...

659
00:44:30,098 --> 00:44:32,552
What's the matter?

660
00:44:33,268 --> 00:44:35,390
Let's get a drink.

661
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:46,691
I'm going to go to the loo,
then I'm going to come back.

662
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:49,234
And then we're going to be civilised.

663
00:44:53,954 --> 00:44:55,328
[telephone]

664
00:44:57,792 --> 00:45:00,993
Ifyou have a message for Mark Darcy,
speak after the tone.

665
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,199
[beep]

666
00:45:02,379 --> 00:45:04,584
Mark, it's Rebecca. Are you there?

667
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:09,339
Obviously not.
Probably still out with Bridget.

668
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:13,795
Um... Anyway, I hope lunch
with the parents went well.

669
00:45:13,974 --> 00:45:17,139
I'm sure you were dutiful
and very polite, as usual.

670
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:22,432
Er... Whatever. Anyway, look, maybe
give me a ring when you get back.

671
00:45:22,606 --> 00:45:25,274
I thought I might pop round
for a nightcap.

672
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:29,733
But I suppose that's a silly idea.
Bridget's probably there.

673
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,520
- Sleep tight.
- [beep]

674
00:45:36,662 --> 00:45:38,949
Oh, Christ, what now?

675
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:43,072
Are you or are you not having an affair
with Rebecca Gillies?

676
00:45:43,794 --> 00:45:46,710
I won't dignify that question
with an answer.

677
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,668
Right.

678
00:45:49,632 --> 00:45:51,457
All I did was go to the loo.

679
00:45:52,635 --> 00:45:54,507
Bridget!

680
00:45:56,932 --> 00:45:58,638
Bridget.

681
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:02,173
That's not your coat.

682
00:46:03,937 --> 00:46:06,142
Oh, right.

683
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,896
Oh, Bridget, what are you doing?

684
00:46:16,657 --> 00:46:21,364
I read you should never date someone if
you can think of three reasons not to.

685
00:46:21,538 --> 00:46:23,327
- Can you think of three?
- Yes.

686
00:46:23,497 --> 00:46:27,363
- Which are?
- Well, first off, I embarrass you.

687
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:30,827
I can't ski, I can't ride,
I can't speak Latin.

688
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:34,704
My legs only come up to here and yes,
I will always be a little bit fat.

689
00:46:34,884 --> 00:46:38,465
And you, you fold your underpants
before you go to bed.

690
00:46:38,636 --> 00:46:42,086
- Now, hang on, that can't be a reason.
- No, it's not a reason.

691
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,341
But you're not perfect either.

692
00:46:44,517 --> 00:46:47,267
You look down your nose
at absolutely everyone,

693
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:52,145
and you're incapable of doing anything
spontaneous or potentially affectionate.

694
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:55,685
It feels like you're waiting
to find someone in the VlP room

695
00:46:55,862 --> 00:46:58,433
who's, who's so fantastic...

696
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,231
just the way she is,

697
00:47:01,408 --> 00:47:04,076
that you don't need to fix her.

698
00:47:04,245 --> 00:47:05,821
Bridget, this is mad.

699
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:08,450
Perhaps you've already found her.

700
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,414
Do you want to marry me?

701
00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:18,623
Look, l...

702
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,843
You see, you can never
muster the strength...

703
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:27,422
to fight for me.

704
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:49,151
[Bridget] I can't believe I did that.

705
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:30,606
¡ò What do I gotta do
to make you love me?

706
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:37,663
¡ò What do I gotta do to make you care?

¡ò Hmm

00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:52,429
¡ò And I wake to find
that you're not there?

711
00:48:55,809 --> 00:49:00,516
¡ò What do I gotta do
to make you want me?

00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,299
¡ò Hmm

713
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:07,684
¡ò What do I gotta do to be heard?

¡ò And what do I say
when it's all over, babe?

¡ò Oooh-ooh

¡ò And sorry seems to be the hardest word

¡ò It's sad
So sad

719
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,873
¡ò Why can't we talk it over, babe?

720
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,589
¡ò Always seems to me

¡ò The hardest word ¡ò

00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:51,599
[Bridget] Five weeks later.

724
00:49:51,778 --> 00:49:54,647
Weight: 4, 000 pounds.

725
00:49:54,823 --> 00:49:59,033
Am enjoying a relationship with two men
simultaneously.

726
00:49:59,203 --> 00:50:02,535
The first is called Ben,
the other, Jerry.

727
00:50:02,705 --> 00:50:05,990
Number of current boyfriends: zero.

728
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:08,491
Number of calls from ex-boyfriend:

729
00:50:08,668 --> 00:50:12,000
[electronic voice]
You have absolutely no messages.

730
00:50:12,173 --> 00:50:15,837
Not a single one.
Not even from your mother.

731
00:50:16,552 --> 00:50:18,590
[telephone]

732
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:24,129
- Hello?
- Hello, darling.

733
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:28,175
- You haven't forgotten our lunch date?
- [Bridget] Of course I have.

734
00:50:28,354 --> 00:50:31,437
- I'm suicidally depressed.
- Don't be silly, Bridget.

735
00:50:31,607 --> 00:50:34,061
Meet me at Debenhams at twelve o'clock.

736
00:50:35,236 --> 00:50:38,319
Mum... I thought we were going
to have something to eat.

737
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:42,271
[Mum] Patience, please. I've got
a big surprise for you, darling.

738
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:46,035
- What?
- Don't say "what", say "pardon".

00:50:47,998 --> 00:50:49,739
[shrill] Tra-la!

00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:52,952
- What do you think?
- Oh, my God.

741
00:50:53,128 --> 00:50:55,166
Daddy and I are getting married.

742
00:50:55,339 --> 00:50:58,125
- You're already married.
- We're doing it again.

743
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,632
Reaffirming our vows.
You are going to be a bridesmaid,

744
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:04,672
and absolutely everything
is going to be lavender.

745
00:51:04,848 --> 00:51:07,384
And when I say everything, I mean...

746
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:09,476
...everything.

are doing it twice.

¡ò No more candlelight
No more romance

- ¡ò No more small talk...
- [Bridget] Bloody know-it-all.

752
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:30,322
New York: the Big, Juicy Apple.

753
00:51:30,497 --> 00:51:34,446
The city that never sleeps
with the same person two nights running.

754
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:38,871
My favourite place in America, where Sex
And The City isn't just a programme,

755
00:51:39,046 --> 00:51:41,001
it's a promise.

758
00:51:47,222 --> 00:51:49,011
Sorry.

759
00:51:49,182 --> 00:51:52,929
Oh, cheer up, misery guts.
I have good news for you.

760
00:51:53,102 --> 00:51:55,093
[chuckles] Sure, right.

761
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,353
What's the angle?
I interview some rocket scientist

762
00:51:58,524 --> 00:52:01,476
while he looks through my skirt
with X-ray glasses?

763
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,145
No.

764
00:52:03,779 --> 00:52:05,770
Although that is a bloody good idea.

765
00:52:06,407 --> 00:52:10,451
No. The fact is The Smooth Guide
is doing very well with women,

766
00:52:10,618 --> 00:52:15,111
but the network want us to cast
a wider net and use a Smooth Guide-ess.

767
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:18,490
Me? With Daniel Cleaver?

768
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:22,534
It's the next logical step.
I think Thailand is first on the list.

769
00:52:22,713 --> 00:52:25,381
No. I won't do it.

770
00:52:25,549 --> 00:52:28,335
Not now.
Not in a million years from now.

771
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:31,262
- Excuse me?
- I am a top television journalist,

772
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,670
not some boorish bint in a bikini.

773
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:38,389
Really? Strong words from somebody
who doesn't know where Germany is.

774
00:52:38,561 --> 00:52:40,848
- [sniggering]
- Who told you that?

775
00:52:41,023 --> 00:52:44,556
Cleaver. He said he couldn't be expected
to go out with someone

776
00:52:44,817 --> 00:52:49,809
who thought lran was David Bowie's wife,
and who didn't know where Germany was.

777
00:52:50,698 --> 00:52:57,149
Daniel Cleaver is a deceitful, sexist,
disgusting specimen of humanity,

778
00:52:57,329 --> 00:53:00,033
that I wouldn't share a lift with,
let alone a job.

779
00:53:00,207 --> 00:53:02,624
Come on, Jones, there must have been
something you liked about me.

780
00:53:02,627 --> 00:53:03,870
Come on, Jones, there must have been
something you liked about me.

781
00:53:04,044 --> 00:53:07,245
Well,... you have a nice car.

782
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,458
And quite nice manners.
Outside the bedroom.

783
00:53:11,634 --> 00:53:13,672
But that's about it.

784
00:53:14,221 --> 00:53:16,840
And by the way,
I know exactly where Germany is.

785
00:53:17,014 --> 00:53:20,464
The question is do you know the location
of your arsehole?

786
00:53:24,563 --> 00:53:29,519
As a matter of fact, I do know the
exact location of my arsehole. And hers.

787
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:33,649
Oh, come on, Jones,
it was just a silly joke.

788
00:53:33,822 --> 00:53:35,363
Not a very funny one.

789
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:36,942
- Go on, then.
- What?

790
00:53:37,117 --> 00:53:39,108
Where is it? Where is Germany?

791
00:53:39,286 --> 00:53:42,072
- Next to France.
- And?

792
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:44,571
And also Belgium,...

793
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,369
Poland. And it has a sea coast.

794
00:53:48,127 --> 00:53:50,533
Which sea?

795
00:53:57,637 --> 00:53:59,628
Oh, sod it. Now, look,

796
00:53:59,806 --> 00:54:02,556
I think we should talk
about Finch's suggestion.

797
00:54:02,724 --> 00:54:04,799
I am going to Thailand, Jones.

798
00:54:04,977 --> 00:54:07,596
Wouldn't you like to be
my little Girl Guide?

799
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:08,843
Thailand?

800
00:54:09,022 --> 00:54:12,721
- You'll shag before you leave Heathrow.
- I'll be perfectly fine.

801
00:54:12,902 --> 00:54:14,977
I'm eschewing all men.

802
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:18,404
And cigarettes. And carbohydrates.

803
00:54:18,573 --> 00:54:21,442
- We can't possibly let you go.
- On your own.

804
00:54:21,618 --> 00:54:23,609
Oh, stop it, all of you.

805
00:54:23,787 --> 00:54:26,621
I am a mature, sophisticated,
professional woman

806
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:31,532
and I'm going to Thailand
entirely on my own, thank you very much.

807
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,167
- [Shazzer] Fuck!
- Sorry.

808
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:35,412
- Fuckity fuck.
- Sorry.

809
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:40,166
[pilot] And now our final passengers
have joined us, we can get underway.

810
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:42,419
Someone's gotta be last.

811
00:54:44,871 --> 00:54:47,686
- [crunching]
- [Bridget] Are we not sitting together?

812
00:54:46,934 --> 00:54:48,925
Oh, fuck.

813
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:54,646
I don't think we're really
in a position to, um,...

814
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,971
...make a fuss.
Sorry. Hi.

815
00:54:59,053 --> 00:55:01,341
- Sorry.
- [man chuckles]

816
00:55:02,597 --> 00:55:04,256
[woman] What's our film?

817
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,471
What's your name? Mine's Clive.

818
00:55:07,643 --> 00:55:09,635
- Er, Bridget.
- [Clive chuckles]

819
00:55:09,812 --> 00:55:12,812
[pilot] Good afternoon again,
ladies and gentlemen.

820
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:15,898
We're about to offer a wide range
of duty-free items.

821
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:18,771
Details can be found
in your in-flight magazine.

822
00:55:18,944 --> 00:55:20,735
[baby cries]

823
00:55:26,576 --> 00:55:30,786
Wonderful people, the Thais.
Particularly the young ladies.

824
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:32,946
If you know what I mean, eh?

825
00:55:33,123 --> 00:55:35,827
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- Come with me.

826
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,205
Come with me now.

827
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,914
- Where are we going?
- Just through here.

828
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,210
Thank you. This is worse than school.

829
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,503
It really wasn't my fault.

830
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,046
It's a fizzy drink, you know, it just...

831
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,424
It just sort of fizzied over.

832
00:55:51,805 --> 00:55:55,220
Couldn't bear to think of you back there
in slum class, Jones.

833
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:59,518
Graham, thank you. You are the best
air steward I've ever come across.

834
00:55:59,686 --> 00:56:01,761
And if I may say so, the smartest.

835
00:56:01,938 --> 00:56:03,396
Thank you, sir.

836
00:56:06,275 --> 00:56:09,061
I thought you were there already,
doing research.

837
00:56:09,236 --> 00:56:11,192
Fuck, no. I make it up as I go along.

838
00:56:11,363 --> 00:56:15,062
It's 1 3 hours for this trip.
I need some in-flight entertainment.

839
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:18,905
Why don't you tell me, in detail,
about your school netball tour,

840
00:56:19,078 --> 00:56:22,576
particularly the unsavoury incident
in the communal showers.

841
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:25,830
I didn't play netball.
Or go to a girls' school.

842
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,617
- Or have showers.
- Now that's just not true, is it?

843
00:56:29,795 --> 00:56:31,787
- Let me start you off.
- No.

844
00:56:31,963 --> 00:56:35,662
If you're gonna be dull, I'm going
to plunge back into Mrs Dalloway,

845
00:56:35,841 --> 00:56:39,043
and you know how she loves that.
Dirty, dirty bitch.

846
00:57:00,737 --> 00:57:03,025
- [elephant trumpets]
- ¡ò Here's a new thing

847
00:57:03,197 --> 00:57:04,856
¡ò That's gonna please ya

848
00:57:05,032 --> 00:57:07,522
¡ò Just a little town down in Indonesia

849
00:57:07,743 --> 00:57:08,822
¡ò Bangkok...

850
00:57:08,994 --> 00:57:11,828
[Bridget] Arrived Bangkok. Very hot.

851
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:15,993
Relieved at last to throw myself
into serious journalistic work.

852
00:57:18,043 --> 00:57:22,205
Thailand has long called travellers
from around the globe

853
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,044
to take spiritual succour
and karmic rest.

854
00:57:26,217 --> 00:57:31,341
For centuries, Western visitors
have been inevitably drawn

855
00:57:31,513 --> 00:57:34,881
to some of Bangkok's oldest sanctuaries.

856
00:57:35,057 --> 00:57:38,639
So true, Bridget. Even l,
fight it as I may, am no exception.

857
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:42,937
The moment I arrive here,
I almost feel an irresistible pull...

858
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:46,853
...to this. The Temple of Tranquillity.

859
00:57:47,568 --> 00:57:52,608
Indeed, nothing symbolises Thailand's
extraordinary fusion of East and West,

860
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,195
of tradition and innovation,
better than this.

861
00:57:56,367 --> 00:57:58,608
Fully body-to-body massage.

862
00:57:58,785 --> 00:58:01,192
- Sawatdee kha?
- Sawatdee khrab?

863
00:58:01,371 --> 00:58:05,782
An incredible thing about Thailand
is the amazing traditional cuisine.

864
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:10,001
I'm going to taste kapaluk,
the ultimate delicacy.

865
00:58:11,879 --> 00:58:14,203
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

866
00:58:14,382 --> 00:58:16,374
Oh, my God. My God.

867
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:19,087
Um... Er... Mmm.

868
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:21,751
How about a lovely locust?

869
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:24,087
I can't. No, no, I can't.

870
00:58:24,265 --> 00:58:26,304
- They're delicious.
- [crunching

871
00:58:28,643 --> 00:58:30,053
Oh!

872
00:58:33,022 --> 00:58:38,181
[Daniel] Now that is Ko Panyi, which is
the setting for a very famous Thai poem,

873
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,684
which I think you'd like very much,
Jones.

874
00:58:40,862 --> 00:58:45,072
It's all about a badly-behaved prince
who finds true love with a beautiful,

875
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,442
and as it happens,
very slightly overweight princess.

876
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:52,784
- You're teasing me.
- I never tease about poetry.

877
00:58:53,539 --> 00:58:57,405
"Oh, Suvarnamali
Why can you not see that I adore you?"

878
00:58:57,584 --> 00:58:59,991
"Why do you avoid and scorn me?"

879
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,162
"lf you cast me off and leave me

880
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,543
How should I live another day?"

881
00:59:07,551 --> 00:59:11,844
And you thought all I knew of Thailand
was pussies and ping-pong balls.

882
00:59:12,013 --> 00:59:15,048
- You wouldn't sleep with him?
- No, of course not.

883
00:59:15,224 --> 00:59:17,595
Absolutely not.

884
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:19,842
But he is clever.

885
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:21,560
- Yes?
- And handsome.

886
00:59:21,729 --> 00:59:25,263
He's also a dysfunctional,
fucked-up, middle-aged, lost boy.

887
00:59:25,441 --> 00:59:27,433
Well, no-one's perfect.

888
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:29,233
[birdsong

889
00:59:32,405 --> 00:59:34,776
I didn't realise you were busy.

890
00:59:38,702 --> 00:59:42,401
- He's young enough to be your grandson.
- I know. Isn't that great?

891
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,702
- [man yells]
- [ladies shriek]

892
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:49,871
Come on, guys, I've got a very special
treat lined up for lunch.

893
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,415
[Bridget]
I'm getting rather fond of Jed,

894
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:55,956
and I must say he has a genuine interest
in Thai cuisine.

895
00:59:56,133 --> 01:00:00,046
[Bridget] I wouldn't have thought
omelette would be big in Thailand.

896
01:00:00,219 --> 01:00:03,836
- Or mushrooms, for that matter.
- [Jed] It's magic.

897
01:00:06,725 --> 01:00:09,725
It is a magic mushroom omelette,
isn't it?

898
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:14,888
Well, that's awful.
There is nothing funny in this at all.

899
01:00:17,067 --> 01:00:19,059
Although, thank God,

900
01:00:19,694 --> 01:00:22,611
the mushrooms don't actually
seem to be working.

901
01:00:25,574 --> 01:00:27,447
[¡ò Primal Scream: Loaded]

902
01:00:28,368 --> 01:00:30,573
¡ò Just what is it
that you want to do?

903
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,998
Such lovely colours! [gasps]

904
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:39,166
¡ò We wanna get loaded
And we wanna have a good time...

905
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:44,079
Beautiful Bridget! Beautiful Bridget!
Beautiful Bridget!

906
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:48,666
Bridget Jones!

907
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:53,960
[Daniel's voice, distorted]
Bridget Jones!

908
01:00:54,139 --> 01:00:55,846
But, wait...

909
01:00:56,016 --> 01:00:59,348
- [Daniel, distorted] Bridget Jones?
- What sound is that?

910
01:01:04,981 --> 01:01:08,183
It is Daniel Cleaver. [echoes]

911
01:01:08,359 --> 01:01:12,272
[thinks]
How unutterably beautiful he is.

912
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,270
Jones, what the hell are you doing?

913
01:01:19,827 --> 01:01:22,661
[Bridget] You are lovely colours.

914
01:01:23,622 --> 01:01:26,373
- ¡ò I don't wanna lose your love...
- Here.

01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:28,616
Here I am.

916
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,950
I think you're completely off your face.

917
01:01:33,338 --> 01:01:35,211
- Hey.
- [Bridget groans]

918
01:01:35,382 --> 01:01:38,417
- Bloody hell.
- [Bridget groans and sighs]

919
01:01:38,968 --> 01:01:42,003
Oh... Oh, I'm an angel.

920
01:01:42,971 --> 01:01:45,841
Oh. How lovely.

921
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:48,387
Glorious sand.

922
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,350
Oh.

923
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:52,724
I want to be naked.

924
01:01:53,313 --> 01:01:57,689
- Naked as a baby.
- Come on, then, angel. Up you get.

925
01:01:57,859 --> 01:01:59,851
[Daniel strains]

926
01:02:00,945 --> 01:02:02,937
- All right?
- Mmm.

927
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:07,528
- [Daniel] How are you feeling?
- Completely embarrassed.

928
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,068
Don't be. You're charming on drugs.
In future, just say yes.

929
01:02:11,912 --> 01:02:17,071
Do you know, I never really understood
why you wanted to go out with me.

930
01:02:17,959 --> 01:02:20,912
- It seemed so unlikely.
- Come on. For God's sake.

931
01:02:21,086 --> 01:02:24,039
You're sexy. You make me laugh.

932
01:02:24,214 --> 01:02:26,621
At you, of course, not with you.

933
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,339
And you were,...

934
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:31,301
... incidentally,...

935
01:02:33,013 --> 01:02:34,804
...the best shag...

936
01:02:34,973 --> 01:02:36,597
...I ever had.

937
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:38,343
The best?

938
01:02:38,517 --> 01:02:41,849
Aside from Simon Reade
in the fifth-form locker room, yeah.

939
01:02:42,854 --> 01:02:45,391
Suppose I said you were pretty good too?

940
01:02:47,483 --> 01:02:49,558
Pretty good?

941
01:02:50,652 --> 01:02:53,023
Was I better than Mark Darcy?

942
01:02:54,155 --> 01:02:58,566
By the way, is it true he always says
"I'm sorry, I think I'm going to come"?

943
01:02:58,743 --> 01:03:01,743
- Who told you that?
- It's common knowledge, isn't it?

944
01:03:02,996 --> 01:03:05,830
Come on, Jones. Who gave who the hoof?

945
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:08,121
And why?

946
01:03:09,293 --> 01:03:11,332
Let's just say

947
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:14,788
that we suffered
from a fatal incompatibility.

948
01:03:18,509 --> 01:03:20,714
I have missed you, Jones.

949
01:03:20,886 --> 01:03:23,637
I don't suppose
there's any circumstances

950
01:03:23,805 --> 01:03:26,176
in which you would ever consider

951
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:29,135
thinking about trusting me again?

952
01:03:31,812 --> 01:03:33,804
Absolutely not.

953
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:43,936
Well, I suppose I'll be getting back
to my little hut now.

954
01:03:44,697 --> 01:03:48,279
Thank you very much, Daniel.
I had a nice time.

955
01:03:59,835 --> 01:04:04,294
Is that the Big Dipper
or the little one?

956
01:04:04,464 --> 01:04:06,669
I can never tell them apart.

957
01:04:06,841 --> 01:04:08,584
Definitely the big one.

958
01:04:08,759 --> 01:04:11,794
You can't see the little one
this close to the equator.

959
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:15,634
Oh, please.
You don't know about astronomy.

960
01:04:15,806 --> 01:04:18,343
I most certainly do.
I'm passionate about it.

961
01:04:20,727 --> 01:04:24,593
You know, Jones, if stargazing
is something that interests you,

962
01:04:24,772 --> 01:04:28,851
then it has to be said that the view
from my balcony is quite outstanding.

963
01:04:30,193 --> 01:04:33,146
Perhaps you'd like to come up
and have a little look?

964
01:04:33,321 --> 01:04:35,194
I don't think so.

965
01:04:35,364 --> 01:04:38,530
See over there? Along my arm.

966
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,739
That's it, over there.

967
01:04:41,745 --> 01:04:44,069
That is Orion's Belt.

968
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:49,536
And next to that is a very sexy little
constellation called Ursa's Maiden.

969
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:50,741
Ah.

970
01:04:50,919 --> 01:04:54,287
She's being very naughty
and trying to undo Orion's belt.

971
01:04:55,298 --> 01:04:59,377
All right, what about...
that one?

972
01:05:00,385 --> 01:05:03,504
Yes, well that is
a very, very famous star.

973
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,051
Um, right next to, of course, um...

that's been there for years and years.

976
01:05:12,854 --> 01:05:16,186
Seen one star, you've seen the lot,
that's what I say, Jones.

977
01:05:19,735 --> 01:05:22,023
Different with girls, though.

978
01:05:24,113 --> 01:05:26,105
Some girls...

979
01:05:26,282 --> 01:05:28,274
...are special.

980
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:30,572
Are they?

981
01:05:31,453 --> 01:05:33,445
I think so.

982
01:05:33,621 --> 01:05:36,028
[¡ò 1 0cc: I'm Not In Love]

What is this special power
you hold over me, Jones?

984
01:05:57,015 --> 01:05:59,220
And what about your therapy?

985
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:03,094

- You're looking for a weekend of sex,

that you should go and fuck yourself.

- That's true.
- In the last year,

If you want something smooth

you could do worse than John Currin.

He is about the only
contemporary painter who can paint.

Did you see her surrounded by police,

Oh, no, it's not possible.

to be the villain of this piece.

and half of Ml5.

1358
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:38,638
But none of them could locate Jed,
so Mark flew over to lnterpol.

1359
01:28:38,812 --> 01:28:41,183
Which is in Lyon.
They located Jed in Dubai,

1360
01:28:41,356 --> 01:28:43,976
but they don't normally
extradite people,

1361
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:47,518
so Mark rang the Home Secretary
who rang our ambassador...

1362
01:28:47,694 --> 01:28:50,979
In Riyadh. Then Mark flew to Dubai
where he identified Jed,

1363
01:28:51,156 --> 01:28:53,527
who was impounded and pushed out into...

1364
01:28:53,699 --> 01:28:56,699
Saudi Arabia, where Mark was waiting
with the police.

1365
01:28:56,869 --> 01:29:01,280
Jed was arrested and extradited back
to Britain. Then Mark flew to Bangkok,
