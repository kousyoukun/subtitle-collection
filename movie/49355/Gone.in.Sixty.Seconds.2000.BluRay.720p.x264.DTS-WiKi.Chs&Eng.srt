(星期日，11点58分) 威顿与威瑟街口

6
00:03:27,65 --> 00:03:28,61
<i>Corner of Wiltern and Wetherly.</i>

7
00:03:30,93 --> 00:03:35,06
小飞弄错了 他说保时捷在威顿与威瑟街口
Tumbler messed up. He said the Porsche should be...

8
00:03:32,69 --> 00:03:34,78
<i>at the corner of Wiltern and Wetherly.</i>

9
00:03:35,14 --> 00:03:36,16
它就在这里
<i>- It's right there. - You're bullshittin' me, right?</i>

10
00:03:36,24 --> 00:03:39,57
不会吧…威顿街9O24号?
- 9024 Wiltern? - What? That?

11
00:03:39,64 --> 00:03:41,70
什么，那台?
I gotta get my tool.

12
00:03:41,78 --> 00:03:44,07
我得拿工具
Kip! He ain't bullshittin'.

13
00:03:44,15 --> 00:03:46,71
奇普!他说的是真的

14
00:03:48,88 --> 00:03:50,04
奇普
<i>Kip! That's not a tool. That's a damn brick!</i>

15
00:03:50,45 --> 00:03:53,32
什么鬼工具，那是砖头

16
00:03:53,39 --> 00:03:56,85
要用那玩意儿…乾脆直接跟监狱订房算了
Kip, man, we gonna use a brick, man, we might as well call a prison and make reservations.

17
00:03:56,92 --> 00:03:58,45
别这样
<i>Ah, come on.</i>

18
00:04:02,90 --> 00:04:04,87
去找号码
Get the number.

19
00:04:06,97 --> 00:04:09,94
4285O
42850.

20
00:04:10,00 --> 00:04:11,67
快点
<i>Hurry up, man.</i>

21
00:04:13,31 --> 00:04:14,80
走吧
<i>Man, let's go!</i>

22
00:04:17,58 --> 00:04:18,64
快闪人吧
Let's get the hell outta here.

23
00:04:18,90 --> 00:04:22,13
Okay, Billy Badass, you got us in here.

24
00:04:20,41 --> 00:04:21,68
好了，大神偷

25
00:04:21,75 --> 00:04:24,98
你带我们近来就得带我们出去
Now tell me how the hell we gonna get out.

26
00:04:24,81 --> 00:04:27,80
Oh, no. I know you ain't gonna do what I think you're gonna do.

27
00:04:26,39 --> 00:04:28,65
你不会想那么做吧?
- Oh, man! - Come on!

28
00:04:28,72 --> 00:04:30,02
天啊

29
00:04:30,73 --> 00:04:31,71
快啊

30
00:04:33,89 --> 00:04:35,26
这又不是"不可能的任务"
<i>- This ain't The Dukes of Hazzard. - Come on!</i>

31
00:04:35,33 --> 00:04:36,06
冲啊

32
00:04:51,45 --> 00:04:53,44
听听我的新技巧
Yo, so check out my new move. I call it "The Stranger."

33
00:04:53,51 --> 00:04:56,21
我称之为"坐坐爽
What I do is, I sit on my hand for like 15, 20 minutes...

34
00:04:56,28 --> 00:05:00,74
我坐著我的手，l5到2O分钟直到它变麻

35
00:04:58,37 --> 00:05:01,74
<i>until it goes numb, no feeling at all.</i>

36
00:05:00,89 --> 00:05:03,72
没有知觉，接著...
And then... I rub one out.

37
00:05:04,49 --> 00:05:05,48
再对它狂抽猛送
The Stranger, huh?

38
00:05:05,59 --> 00:05:07,06
坐坐爽?
It's like a little boys' nursery school I've come upon here.

39
00:05:07,13 --> 00:05:10,76
我真觉得自己像幼稚园保姆

40
00:05:11,93 --> 00:05:13,76
他们人呢?
Where are they?

41
00:05:16,92 --> 00:05:19,15
<i>- You want it? All right. - Hey.</i>

42
00:05:20,11 --> 00:05:21,54
别惹他们
<i>- Leave those people alone. - Oh, my God. Sweetie, you're so talented.</i>

43
00:05:21,61 --> 00:05:23,94
甜心，你真够呛的
- Wha... Hey, hey. Stolen car. Stolen car. - I know. I know.

44
00:05:24,01 --> 00:05:26,91
这是贼车、贼车

45
00:05:26,10 --> 00:05:28,36
Hey, I love you.

46
00:05:28,25 --> 00:05:29,24
我爱你

47
00:05:33,35 --> 00:05:34,98
我们会被捕的
Man, we goin' to jail, man!

48
00:05:36,96 --> 00:05:38,08
来啊
Come on!

49
00:05:43,96 --> 00:05:46,59
你有权保持缄点
Keep your hands behind your back. You have the right to remain silent.

50
00:05:47,80 --> 00:05:48,77
小心
Hey, watch it!

51
00:05:52,61 --> 00:05:55,20
有辆银色保时捷，时速约8O哩
We have a silver Porsche. Estimated speed: 80 miles per hour.

52
00:05:55,28 --> 00:05:57,27
在威夏街向西行驶
Heading west on Wilshire Boulevard.

53
00:05:59,31 --> 00:06:03,55
这是制空一号 谦犯在桥上上往南行驶
<i>This is Air One. We have a visual of the suspect southbound...</i>

54
00:06:01,34 --> 00:06:04,17
<i>on Vincent Thomas Bridge.</i>

55
00:06:07,22 --> 00:06:08,52
出状况了?
<i>- Something wrong, Tumbler? - Yeah, I'm missing Jerry Springer.</i>

56
00:06:08,59 --> 00:06:11,25
是啊，我想看"杰瑞开炮"

57
00:06:16,63 --> 00:06:19,10
好耶、好耶...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

58
00:06:24,44 --> 00:06:26,91
很好、很好
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right!

59
00:06:30,48 --> 00:06:31,71
你好，大车商
What's up, old man?

60
00:06:31,78 --> 00:06:34,54
她从静止到6O哩只要5.2秒
She'll go zero to 60 in 5.2 seconds.

61
00:06:34,62 --> 00:06:36,98
这点我能证明
<i>Believe me, I can vouch for that.</i>

62
00:06:37,05 --> 00:06:38,68
地面人员
<i>Ground units be advised, suspects last seen entering south side of warehouse.</i>

63
00:06:38,75 --> 00:06:40,62
谦犯已进入货栈南端

64
00:06:40,91 --> 00:06:44,37
Thirteen down, thirty-seven to go.

65
00:06:42,76 --> 00:06:45,28
搞定十三辆，还有三十七辆

66
00:06:51,57 --> 00:06:53,26
那是什么?
- What the hell is that? - What is that, man?

67
00:06:54,17 --> 00:06:55,76
你惹出麻烦了
- Now you've gone and done it, Raines. - Tumbler!

68
00:06:55,84 --> 00:06:58,33
小飞，把字擦掉、拿走灯
<i>- Get the board and get the lights! - I got it, I got it!</i>

69
00:06:58,43 --> 00:07:00,66
This is bullshit. It's not comin' off!

70
00:07:01,31 --> 00:07:02,47
擦不掉
<i>- Keys! Get the keys! - I got 'em. I got 'em!</i>

71
00:07:02,54 --> 00:07:03,84
拿擒匙 我去拿
<i>Come on, everybody! Let's go! Hurry up!</i>

72
00:07:03,91 --> 00:07:05,67
快点

73
00:07:05,75 --> 00:07:08,18
拿到了 走吧
<i>- I got it! - Let's go! Toby, get it!</i>

74
00:07:08,25 --> 00:07:10,24
托比，去拿
<i>- Let's go, boys! - Come on, come on! I got the light!</i>

75
00:07:10,32 --> 00:07:10,98
快走

76
00:07:11,05 --> 00:07:13,58
拿灯

77
00:07:13,65 --> 00:07:16,42
走、快走...
Go, go, go! Let's go!

78
00:07:18,66 --> 00:07:19,42
该死
Shit!

79
00:07:33,19 --> 00:07:35,56
<i>Get the VIN number on that?</i>

80
00:07:35,63 --> 00:07:38,76
<i>- I got it. - We've got a lamp shade by a truck.</i>

81
00:07:38,83 --> 00:07:42,03
What do we got?

82
00:07:41,48 --> 00:07:42,92
查到些什么?
All gone. We didn't get a single one of 'em.

83
00:07:43,32 --> 00:07:44,15
全跑了

84
00:07:44,25 --> 00:07:47,98
一个也没抓到，都是行家
And we are talking about professionals.

85
00:07:48,09 --> 00:07:52,65
车锁、架驶盘、点火装置都完好无伤
No visible damage to locking mechanisms, steering columns or ignitions.

86
00:07:52,79 --> 00:07:55,52
你看，这些可不是三阳喜美
And, as you can see, these are not Honda Civics.

87
00:07:55,66 --> 00:07:58,53
这是新款的宝士
This is one of three brand-new Mercedes,

88
00:07:58,63 --> 00:08:02,69
他们宣称这车能完全防窃
a car they say is unstealable.

89
00:08:02,74 --> 00:08:05,57
除非有从汉堡直接寄来的...
Yeah, unless you get the laser-cut transponder key...

90
00:08:05,67 --> 00:08:07,94
数位雷射车匙
sent directly to the U.S. Dealer from Hamburg.

91
00:08:08,04 --> 00:08:09,74
他们有内应
They got somebody working on the inside.

92
00:08:09,84 --> 00:08:13,25
查出车是哪个车商的 还有其他资料
- Find out which dealership sold them, serviced them, etc., etc. - Yeah, I'll get on it.

93
00:08:13,31 --> 00:08:14,87
我会去查

94
00:08:17,15 --> 00:08:18,31
小戴
- Mr. Drycoff? - Yeah?

95
00:08:20,09 --> 00:08:22,32
扣留这些车一个月
Let's impound these cars for one month. I don't give a damn if they belong to Tom Cruise.

96
00:08:22,39 --> 00:08:24,48
就算车主是汤姆克鲁斯也一样

97
00:08:48,18 --> 00:08:51,15
(星期一，2点l5分)

98
00:08:51,22 --> 00:08:52,41
操控
<i>Control, vision, determination.</i>

99
00:08:52,49 --> 00:08:53,95
抱负

100
00:08:54,05 --> 00:08:56,15
决心
These are the three fundamental components...

101
00:08:56,26 --> 00:09:01,70
这些是新世代赛车手的三项基本要件

102
00:08:57,91 --> 00:09:00,78
of the new generation race car driver.

103
00:09:01,76 --> 00:09:05,06
速度只是副产品，速度很快
Speed is a byproduct. Going fast.

104
00:09:05,17 --> 00:09:08,60
但要记得…车子就是你
But remember: The car is you, you are the car.

105
00:09:08,74 --> 00:09:10,17
你就是车子

106
00:09:11,64 --> 00:09:14,07
好了，上路吧
Okay? Let's ride!

107
00:09:17,50 --> 00:09:21,76
Billy, you just shaved one second off your lap time!

108
00:09:19,48 --> 00:09:22,64
比利，你这圈加快一秒了

109
00:09:36,03 --> 00:09:39,02
汤来，我是要你赛车不是玩碰碰车
Tommy, I don't know what that was, but it wasn't driving.

110
00:09:43,67 --> 00:09:45,73
去追上他们吧
Go get 'em!

111
00:09:52,53 --> 00:09:55,97
Well, well, well. What do you pay your pit crews with?

112
00:09:55,12 --> 00:09:58,92
你拿什么付修车技师?糖果跟饼乾?
Oreos and Gummy Bears?

113
00:09:58,81 --> 00:10:03,24
I folded, Atley. You know that. What are you doing here?

114
00:10:00,62 --> 00:10:02,82
我洗手了，老艾

115
00:10:02,89 --> 00:10:04,15
你有何贵斡?
- Is there someplace we can talk? - About what?

116
00:10:04,26 --> 00:10:06,25
能借一步说话吗? 说什么?

117
00:10:06,39 --> 00:10:08,88
你弟弟，还有他惹上的麻烦
About your brother and the deep shit he's in.

118
00:10:08,11 --> 00:10:12,28
Frank, can you watch the kids for a minute?

119
00:10:10,06 --> 00:10:13,23
法阑?帮我看一下好吗?

120
00:10:20,67 --> 00:10:22,07
奇普怎么了?
Tell me about Kip.

121
00:10:22,24 --> 00:10:24,68
他搞砸工作，现在惨了
He took a job, and he fumbled it.

122
00:10:24,78 --> 00:10:28,37
他真的惨了
Now he's jammed up. He's jammed up bad.

123
00:10:28,48 --> 00:10:29,97
什么工作?
- What kind of job? - A boost. A big boost.

124
00:10:30,08 --> 00:10:33,45
一椿买卖，大买卖

125
00:10:33,55 --> 00:10:35,52
买卖?
A boost?

126
00:10:39,13 --> 00:10:41,19
奇普怎么会做买卖?
What's Kip doing on a boost?

127
00:10:41,36 --> 00:10:43,49
你不是开玩笑吧?
Oh, you're shittin' me, man.

128
00:10:43,73 --> 00:10:46,89
你走之后，奇普就成了头头
Kip's become quite the little crew runner since you left.

129
00:10:46,02 --> 00:10:48,51
You don't talk to your ma?

130
00:10:47,84 --> 00:10:49,43
你没跟你妈联络?
She neglected to mention it.

131
00:10:49,50 --> 00:10:51,90
她忘了提了

132
00:10:51,09 --> 00:10:53,82
Listen, I need something.

133
00:10:52,81 --> 00:10:56,80
始著，我需要喝点冰的
I-I need something cold to drink.

134
00:10:56,88 --> 00:10:59,37
我以为我们会找个地方淡
I thought we were goin' someplace to talk.

135
00:11:05,05 --> 00:11:06,21
帮谁做买卖?
- Who was the job for? - A new guy named Raymond Calitri.

136
00:11:06,29 --> 00:11:11,02
一个叫卡雷蒙的新人

137
00:11:09,31 --> 00:11:12,11
They call him "The Carpenter."

138
00:11:11,09 --> 00:11:13,46
人称"木匠
He's runnin' all the dark ponies down there now.

139
00:11:13,56 --> 00:11:16,39
现在整个长堤都归他管了

140
00:11:16,46 --> 00:11:20,63
他是真正的"魔鬼大帝
It's a full-on "Devil came down to Long Beach" trip.

141
00:11:20,70 --> 00:11:23,00
他很危险
He's bad. He's real bad.

142
00:11:23,07 --> 00:11:24,80
真的很危险
And this Calitri is the one who's after my brother?

143
00:11:24,84 --> 00:11:28,64
这个姓卡的在钉我老弟?

144
00:11:28,71 --> 00:11:30,68
毫不留情
Like stains on a mattress.

145
00:11:32,31 --> 00:11:35,15
你该知道…我在他手下做事
And you should know... I work for him.

146
00:11:37,52 --> 00:11:39,95
跛脚的退休偷车贼
There weren't a lot of opportunities for retired car thieves on the gimp.

147
00:11:40,02 --> 00:11:42,85
就业行情并不好

148
00:11:42,92 --> 00:11:44,79
他让我重回战场
He put me to work.

149
00:11:45,79 --> 00:11:51,66
我得跟你说，曼斐 连我都怕这家伙
I-I gotta tell you, Memphis, this guy, he scares the shit out of even me.

150
00:12:13,45 --> 00:12:15,82
你斡么?
What are you doin', man?

151
00:12:16,29 --> 00:12:17,69
住手
Stop! Stop!

152
00:12:18,39 --> 00:12:20,69
住手…

153
00:12:24,22 --> 00:12:26,88
Atley Jackson.

154
00:12:25,83 --> 00:12:27,80
杰艾利
<i>Got it. They have Kip.</i>

155
00:12:28,60 --> 00:12:31,44
知道了 他们逮住奇普了

156
00:12:31,74 --> 00:12:33,57
带我去
Take me there.

157
00:12:34,68 --> 00:12:38,17
(艾克西特废铁场)

158
00:13:02,40 --> 00:13:06,00
卡雷蒙，雷曼斐
Raymond Calitri, Memphis Raines.

159
00:13:04,59 --> 00:13:06,82
I try...

160
00:13:06,94 --> 00:13:11,34
我试着了解并学习美国人的行为
to learn your ways, understand your obsessions.

161
00:13:11,41 --> 00:13:14,97
但棒球…真是够无聊了
<i>But this baseball... it's so bleeding boring, isn't it?</i>

162
00:13:15,25 --> 00:13:16,55
我弟弟呢?
Where's my brother?

163
00:13:19,45 --> 00:13:22,68
雷曼斐…久仰大名
Memphis Raines, your legend precedes you.

164
00:13:22,76 --> 00:13:24,02
艾利说你是第一好手
Atley tells me you're the best.

165
00:13:25,19 --> 00:13:26,32
你走后
<i>After you left, auto theft in the South Bay area went down 47 percent.</i>

166
00:13:26,43 --> 00:13:28,92
南海区的汽车失窃率就降了百分之四十七

167
00:13:29,30 --> 00:13:30,63
我弟弟呢?
Where's my brother?

168
00:13:33,60 --> 00:13:35,19
我很以这些为傲
<i>I'm proud of these. Straddle chair from the Arts and Crafts period.</i>

169
00:13:35,27 --> 00:13:37,70
工艺时代的椅子
Mahogany table with cloud-lift pattern.

170
00:13:37,77 --> 00:13:40,17
还有红木桌
Black walnut wine table. Metal's cold, ugly.

171
00:13:40,24 --> 00:13:43,21
黑胡桃木餐桌，金属冷酷丑陋

172
00:13:43,48 --> 00:13:45,54
木头温暖、洁净...
<i>Wood's warm, clean, provided by nature.</i>

173
00:13:45,61 --> 00:13:48,14
来自大自然
See a piece of furniture take shape, it's like watching a child grow.

174
00:13:48,22 --> 00:13:51,38
看家俱成形就像看著孩子成长

175
00:13:51,54 --> 00:13:54,94
I asked you a question.

176
00:13:53,09 --> 00:13:55,25
你还没回答我的问题

177
00:13:55,89 --> 00:13:59,38
我们被逼离开英国和法国 但我们到了这里
They threw us out of England, threw us out of France,

178
00:13:57,98 --> 00:14:00,45
but here we are, flourishing really,

179
00:13:59,89 --> 00:14:04,76
很繁荣，真的 只是有一点不方便
except for the minor inconvenience of despising everything about your country.

180
00:14:06,17 --> 00:14:09,26
这张单子上列有五十辆车
On this list you'll find 50 cars... five-zero.

181
00:14:08,39 --> 00:14:14,12
I need all 50 delivered to Long Beach Harbor, pier 14 by 8:00 a.m. Four days from now.

182
00:14:10,37 --> 00:14:13,17
我需要在四天后的早上八点

183
00:14:13,24 --> 00:14:14,97
将它们运到十四号码头
I'm paying $200,000.

184
00:14:15,04 --> 00:14:17,07
我会付二十万
I'm not interested. I'm just here for my brother.

185
00:14:17,14 --> 00:14:19,64
没兴趣，我是来找我弟的

186
00:14:19,71 --> 00:14:23,15
你弟来找我，他的风评很好
Young Kip came to me. He had street cred.

187
00:14:23,22 --> 00:14:26,19
大名鼎鼎的雷曼斐的弟弟
The brother of the notorious Memphis Raines.

188
00:14:26,25 --> 00:14:30,09
所以我两周前雇用他付了一万订金给他
So two weeks ago I hired him and advanced him $10,000.

189
00:14:30,16 --> 00:14:31,15
艾利都说了
Atley told me. If it's about the advance, I can understand your anger.

190
00:14:31,79 --> 00:14:34,96
若是订金的问题，我能了解

191
00:14:35,06 --> 00:14:37,03
欠债就要还钱
The debt has to be settled. Ten grand, from me to you.

192
00:14:37,10 --> 00:14:38,69
这是一万

193
00:14:38,80 --> 00:14:40,16
我还给你
- I wish it was that easy. - I don't see the complication.

194
00:14:40,70 --> 00:14:42,03
真希望有那么简单

195
00:14:42,10 --> 00:14:43,90
我看不出有多复杂
I have four days to deliver 50 cars, and I have no cars.

196
00:14:43,97 --> 00:14:45,80
我四天内要交出五十辆车

197
00:14:45,87 --> 00:14:47,17
但我没车
- Well, that's another problem. - It is another problem, isn't it?

198
00:14:47,24 --> 00:14:48,77
那是你的问题

199
00:14:49,81 --> 00:14:50,94
是啊，不是吗?
It's about me delivering 50 top-end cars because I said I would.

200
00:14:51,81 --> 00:14:55,54
是我要变出这五十辆好车

201
00:14:55,62 --> 00:14:58,68
交不出我就失信于我南美的朋友
Because if I don't, my South American friend goes somewhere else from now on.

202
00:14:58,75 --> 00:15:01,22
生意泡汤，这是耻辱
And that's not good. It's a humiliation.

203
00:15:01,22 --> 00:15:03,21
因为说能交车的笨蛋就是我
Because I'm the asshole who said I could deliver.

204
00:15:03,29 --> 00:15:06,45
我长得像笨蛋吗?
Am I an asshole? Do I look like an asshole?

205
00:15:05,61 --> 00:15:09,01
Yeah.

206
00:15:07,16 --> 00:15:08,13
像

207
00:15:11,50 --> 00:15:13,02
我需要那些车
- I need that paper satisfied. - I'm retired.

208
00:15:13,13 --> 00:15:16,53
我早洗手不斡了我弟弟呢?
And where the hell is my brother?

209
00:15:22,28 --> 00:15:23,40
这也是我做的
I made this as well.

210
00:15:25,01 --> 00:15:26,64
我做的第一个
My first one.

211
00:15:44,60 --> 00:15:47,80
压扁一辆车要八万磅的力量
It takes 80,000 pounds of pressure to crush a car.

212
00:15:57,38 --> 00:15:58,37
奇普?
- Kip? - Who's that?

213
00:15:59,85 --> 00:16:00,87
你是推?
- Memphis. - Oh, shit.

214
00:16:01,42 --> 00:16:02,51
曼斐

215
00:16:02,58 --> 00:16:04,24
该死 你还好吧?
You okay?

216
00:16:08,64 --> 00:16:11,84
Shut it off!

217
00:16:11,59 --> 00:16:12,72
关掉它
<i>- Turn it off! - You've got 30 seconds to consider your options.</i>

218
00:16:13,46 --> 00:16:15,62
你有三十秒可以考虑
- Shut it off! - One: You kill me; they kill you.

219
00:16:15,73 --> 00:16:16,59
关掉

220
00:16:16,66 --> 00:16:18,65
第一，你杀我，他们也会杀你
Your brother dies anyway.

221
00:16:18,77 --> 00:16:19,73
你弟还是死路一条

222
00:16:20,03 --> 00:16:22,59
第二，你骗我接下工作
Two: You lie, you accept the job, you take your brother, you run.

223
00:16:22,67 --> 00:16:24,50
带著你弟远走高飞
I hunt you down, I kill you, I kill your brother, and I kill your mother...

224
00:16:24,57 --> 00:16:26,97
我会找到你，杀了你和你弟

225
00:16:27,04 --> 00:16:30,03
因为被你惹怒 我还会杀了你妈
for the aggravation you've caused me.

226
00:16:30,71 --> 00:16:32,54
第三，你接下工作
<i>Three: You accept the deal, you steal some cars,</i>

227
00:16:32,61 --> 00:16:36,28
偷车赚钱，还能当老大哥
you make some money and you be a big brother.

228
00:16:44,78 --> 00:16:47,64
<i>- Memphis! - 8:00 a.m. Friday morning.</i>

229
00:16:46,76 --> 00:16:48,66
星期五早上8点
The cars are on the boat, or your brother's in the coffin.

230
00:16:48,73 --> 00:16:50,79
交车上船或你老弟进棺材

231
00:16:51,60 --> 00:16:55,23
放我出去，快放我出去
<i>Get me outta here! Somebody get me outta here.</i>

232
00:16:57,67 --> 00:17:02,37
(距最后期限72小时)

233
00:17:01,53 --> 00:17:04,52
<i>Listen, you really don't have to make me anything.</i>

234
00:17:03,04 --> 00:17:05,20
你不需要招待我

235
00:17:05,28 --> 00:17:08,61
你来这里救了我一命
Oh, hey, you come down here.

236
00:17:06,83 --> 00:17:08,96
You saved my ass. It's the least I can do.

237
00:17:08,68 --> 00:17:09,84
我至少该招待你一下

238
00:17:11,34 --> 00:17:15,97
Hey, I heard you were, uh, pumping gas someplace up North or something, right?

239
00:17:12,95 --> 00:17:16,82
听说你在加油站做什么的

240
00:17:16,89 --> 00:17:18,02
跟小孩玩赛车
- Yeah, working with kids. - Oh, really?

241
00:17:22,26 --> 00:17:23,66
冠军
"First place." I remember this.

242
00:17:25,47 --> 00:17:26,93
我记得这个

243
00:17:26,99 --> 00:17:30,98
Oh, yeah, that was... that was a long time ago.

244
00:17:28,87 --> 00:17:31,86
是啊，那是很久以前的事了

245
00:17:40,83 --> 00:17:42,89
What'd you put in it?

246
00:17:42,58 --> 00:17:43,78
这里面是什么?
I don't know.

247
00:17:43,85 --> 00:17:45,78
不知道

248
00:17:51,26 --> 00:17:53,25
满好吃的
It's good.

249
00:17:56,15 --> 00:17:59,28
Ow. Ow. Oh, God.

250
00:17:59,35 --> 00:18:03,15
Does Mom know about any of this?

251
00:18:02,14 --> 00:18:04,07
妈知道这件事吗?
No, no, no, she doesn't, and I don't think she should.

252
00:18:04,14 --> 00:18:06,47
不…她不知道

253
00:18:06,54 --> 00:18:10,41
我不认为她该知道，她很辛苦
You know, she... she works really hard, and this... this...

254
00:18:10,48 --> 00:18:13,47
她不需要知道这些麻烦事
She doesn't need to know about any of this stuff.

255
00:18:13,55 --> 00:18:15,71
一切都在我掌握之中
Look, you know, I got everything under control.

256
00:18:16,95 --> 00:18:18,38
厨房著火了
Kitchen's on fire.

257
00:18:23,49 --> 00:18:25,46
天啊
Uh, man.

258
00:18:33,57 --> 00:18:35,03
曼斐
Hey, Memphis.

259
00:18:37,57 --> 00:18:39,33
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

260
00:18:43,20 --> 00:18:45,32
<i>Haul the cartons over there!</i>

261
00:18:46,65 --> 00:18:47,64
小费
<i>- Hey, Fuzzy. - Aw, shit. What are you doin' here?</i>

262
00:18:47,71 --> 00:18:50,51
你们来干嘛? 我说过我什么都不知道
- I told you I don't know anything. - Yeah, but you're a liar.

263
00:18:50,58 --> 00:18:52,78
对，但你说慌

264
00:18:53,75 --> 00:18:54,95
你们会害我失业的
- You're gonna get me fired, man. - Fired? That's not good. You're on parole, right?

265
00:18:55,02 --> 00:18:57,49
那可不妙，你正在假释期间呢

266
00:18:57,56 --> 00:19:03,00
小费，没人想害你失业 我们只想要点消息
Fuzzy, hey, nobody wants to get you fired.

267
00:19:00,11 --> 00:19:03,01
We just need this information is all.

268
00:19:04,43 --> 00:19:07,23
有人在两周前要一拖拉库高级车
Two weeks ago, a call came in for a lot of top-end cars.

269
00:19:07,30 --> 00:19:08,63
那个人是推?
- And who made that call? - I don't have a clue.

270
00:19:09,24 --> 00:19:11,43
我不知道 好，我们问你老板好了
- Okay. We should go talk to your boss. - Oh, shhh.

271
00:19:12,26 --> 00:19:15,56
The delivery date. I know the delivery date.

272
00:19:13,81 --> 00:19:16,04
我知道交货日

273
00:19:16,11 --> 00:19:17,24
何时?
- And when is that? - Thursday, Friday, end of the week.

274
00:19:17,54 --> 00:19:19,14
周末
Well, you get me a name within 48 hours, or we'll be back.

275
00:19:19,21 --> 00:19:21,91
限你两天内给我个名字

276
00:19:21,10 --> 00:19:23,03
Good to see you, buddy.

277
00:19:22,95 --> 00:19:23,92
真高兴看到你
Thank you.

278
00:19:23,98 --> 00:19:25,32
谢谢

279
00:19:30,86 --> 00:19:32,72
我找雷海伦
I'm looking for Helen Raines.

280
00:19:32,83 --> 00:19:34,62
海伦,有人找你
<i>Helen, some guy's here for you.</i>

281
00:19:34,73 --> 00:19:37,03
谁，他长什么样子?
What guy? What's he look like?

282
00:19:37,10 --> 00:19:40,33
很帅，像你儿子
Like a firecracker. Like your son.

283
00:19:39,49 --> 00:19:41,78
You look so good.

284
00:19:41,27 --> 00:19:43,00
你气色真好
Thank you, Momma. Here. Spring... Spring bouquet.

285
00:19:43,07 --> 00:19:44,37
你也一样，妈

286
00:19:44,80 --> 00:19:47,30
春天的花束
What are you doing here?

287
00:19:47,37 --> 00:19:48,74
你来这被斡嘛?
Well, uh, Atley Jackson came to see me.

288
00:19:48,98 --> 00:19:53,67
杰艾利去找我 跟我谈奇普的事

289
00:19:51,60 --> 00:19:53,72
Told me something about Kip.

290
00:19:54,65 --> 00:19:56,38
要我帮你吗?
Can I help you with one of these?

291
00:19:59,57 --> 00:20:02,63
<i>Okay, that's yours.</i>

292
00:20:03,26 --> 00:20:07,72
跟凯瑟说 搞点咖啡来了个稀客
Tell Castlebeck he's not gonna believe who just walked into the Quality Cafe.

293
00:20:07,99 --> 00:20:10,59
我并不意外
I can't say I'm surprised.

294
00:20:10,93 --> 00:20:14,70
他一直都崇拜你，想变成你
All his life he looked up to you, tried to be you.

295
00:20:15,30 --> 00:20:17,43
我想他成功了
I guess now he is.

296
00:20:17,90 --> 00:20:21,10
怎会这样?我都有寄钱给你们
So why is this happening? I send you guys money.

297
00:20:21,17 --> 00:20:24,44
他认识了一些人，他变了
He... He met some people, and he changed.

298
00:20:25,51 --> 00:20:30,21
他已经不单纯了
He lost that... that sweetness, you know?

299
00:20:31,62 --> 00:20:32,85
好吧
Okay... tell me. How deep in is he?

300
00:20:33,79 --> 00:20:35,55
告诉我

301
00:20:35,62 --> 00:20:37,15
他惹上多大的麻烦?
Deep.

302
00:20:37,22 --> 00:20:38,95
很大
Can you get him out?

303
00:20:39,39 --> 00:20:41,16
你能帮他吗?

304
00:20:43,83 --> 00:20:46,63
那我就得做些事
It means doin' things,

305
00:20:46,42 --> 00:20:49,65
things I told you I'd never do again.

306
00:20:48,07 --> 00:20:50,56
做你叫我别做的事

307
00:20:51,07 --> 00:20:53,37
能怎么做就怎么做吧
Do what it takes, Randall.

308
00:21:05,72 --> 00:21:07,58
你何时回来的?
<i>When did you get into town, Raines?</i>

309
00:21:07,92 --> 00:21:10,05
昨晚 回来干嘛?
- Last night. - Last night? What for?

310
00:21:10,19 --> 00:21:13,85
想看湖人队打球 听说侠客球技炫毙了
I thought I'd catch a Lakers game. Heard we got Shaquille.

311
00:21:11,98 --> 00:21:15,07
Guys wanna go?

312
00:21:14,03 --> 00:21:15,96
想一起去看吗?
- Guess not. - Randall, Randall, Randall, come here.

313
00:21:16,10 --> 00:21:17,39
我猜是不想

314
00:21:17,53 --> 00:21:20,23
小雷，过来

315
00:21:19,39 --> 00:21:22,29
I get this call from this uniform, you know?

316
00:21:21,27 --> 00:21:23,46
是一个制服员警通知我的
Axton. Very nice man. Remembers everything.

317
00:21:23,60 --> 00:21:25,87
他脑筋可灵光了

318
00:21:26,04 --> 00:21:28,13
他说"你猜谁回来了?
This man calls me up, says, "Guess who's back in town?" I say, "Who?"

319
00:21:28,27 --> 00:21:29,21
我说"谁?"
<i>He says, "Randall Raines." I say, "Randall Raines the car thief?"</i>

320
00:21:29,28 --> 00:21:30,54
他说"雷曼斐"

321
00:21:30,61 --> 00:21:32,58
我说"偷车大王?"他说"对"
He says, "Yeah." I say, "Impossible." He says, "No, he's back."

322
00:21:32,65 --> 00:21:38,61
我说"不可能" 他说"我敢跟你赌二百元"...

323
00:21:34,20 --> 00:21:37,80
I say, "No, he's not." He says, "Yes, I will bet you $200 I just saw Randall Raines."

324
00:21:38,72 --> 00:21:41,02
你们真爱抬杠，听着...
<i>- You guys said a lot. Look, Detective... - No, whoa, whoa.</i>

325
00:21:42,72 --> 00:21:45,05
最讽刺的是
What's really, really ironic about this...

326
00:21:45,13 --> 00:21:48,86
二天前… 我们查到十三辆待运的贼车
Two nights ago we snare these 13 fresh stolens waiting for export.

327
00:21:48,96 --> 00:21:51,59
当时，我在想...
At the time I'm thinking, "This feels like Randall Raines."

328
00:21:51,70 --> 00:21:53,46
这感受真像雷曼斐
Now, it didn't have your panache, your, uh, flash,

329
00:21:53,53 --> 00:21:56,56
手法没有你好，也不聪明

330
00:21:56,64 --> 00:21:59,80
但感受就像雷曼斐
but it just felt like Randall Raines.

331
00:21:59,87 --> 00:22:01,41
而你却在这里
<i>And now here you are.</i>

332
00:22:01,41 --> 00:22:03,77
我不知道你在找什么
Look, I don't know what you boys are looking for, but I just got back, okay?

333
00:22:03,84 --> 00:22:06,54
但我刚回来，我家里有事
It was a family emergency. Now, that's the truth.

334
00:22:06,61 --> 00:22:08,01
事实就是如此
Family emergency. Yeah, I got a family emergency too, Randall.

335
00:22:08,08 --> 00:22:10,71
我家里也有事了

336
00:22:11,72 --> 00:22:16,05
我得告诉我老婆 我刚打赌输了二百元
I gotta go tell my woman that I just lost $200 on a stupid deal.

337
00:22:16,12 --> 00:22:17,28
她很凶的
- Mmm, she's mean. - What?

338
00:22:17,36 --> 00:22:18,69
什么?
She can be mean.

339
00:22:19,46 --> 00:22:22,43
她有时会很凶

340
00:22:22,53 --> 00:22:24,39
过来,小雷
Come here. Come here, Randall.

341
00:22:25,53 --> 00:22:28,13
请你拿下眼镜吧
Take those glasses off, Randall. Please, do me a favor.

342
00:22:29,76 --> 00:22:33,16
Six years ago you make a real smart move, you know?

343
00:22:31,91 --> 00:22:33,96
六年前，你很聪明
You retire from a life that's gonna get you busted or killed or maybe even both.

344
00:22:34,04 --> 00:22:37,44
你洗手不干保全性命

345
00:22:37,51 --> 00:22:41,41
但我有机会逮你时不逮你
And I'm thinkin' that not putting you away when I had a chance...

346
00:22:41,48 --> 00:22:46,25
就等于是… 拿自己的前途开玩笑
is like this big bug up the ass of this real impressive career that I've had.

347
00:22:46,32 --> 00:22:50,02
我知道，胜利...
Oh, yeah.

348
00:22:47,44 --> 00:22:51,57
Well, without disappointment, you can't appreciate victory.

349
00:22:50,09 --> 00:22:52,08
本就得来不易

350
00:22:51,64 --> 00:22:53,77
Eleanor tell you that?

351
00:22:53,39 --> 00:22:54,66
伊琳诺告诉你的?
Now, that's hittin' below the belt.

352
00:22:54,76 --> 00:22:56,75
这么说很不公平
Yeah, all right, let me tell you about below the belt, Randall.

353
00:22:56,86 --> 00:22:58,80
我跟你说什么是不公平吧

354
00:22:58,87 --> 00:23:04,10
从现在起 你若违规穿越马路、不看号志
From here on out, if you walk across the street outside of a crosswalk,

355
00:23:01,69 --> 00:23:04,12
if you roll through a stop sign,

356
00:23:04,10 --> 00:23:07,90
或是垃圾分分类不确实...
if you use an aerosol can in a manner other than directed...

357
00:23:07,97 --> 00:23:13,28
我不管 只要你稍一犯错，我就逮你
I mean, I don't care, you make one slip,

358
00:23:10,20 --> 00:23:12,39
and I will put you away for good.

359
00:23:13,61 --> 00:23:17,55
等你出狱，人们早就不用车了
<i>- Okay. - By the time you get out, asshole,</i>

360
00:23:15,07 --> 00:23:17,23
there won't even be cars.

361
00:23:17,62 --> 00:23:21,95
到时我们开的是太空船
We'll all be cruising around in your little, vroom, spaceships.

362
00:23:22,69 --> 00:23:24,92
那真糟
That's gonna suck.

363
00:23:27,79 --> 00:23:29,19
伊琳诺是谁?
Who's Eleanor?

364
00:23:29,26 --> 00:23:31,13
是一辆车
It's a damn car.

365
00:23:31,20 --> 00:23:33,72
不准你再谈我老婆了
And don't ever talk about my wife.

366
00:23:40,87 --> 00:23:43,31
抱歉，奥图在哪?
Excuse me. You know where Otto is?

367
00:23:43,38 --> 00:23:45,64
在喷漆室后面
He's in the back, in the paint shop.

368
00:23:54,54 --> 00:23:59,44
Is that you? About time you came to see me.

369
00:23:56,16 --> 00:23:57,15
是你吗?

370
00:23:58,63 --> 00:24:00,32
你也该来看我了
- I missed you. - Good to see you!

371
00:24:00,43 --> 00:24:02,29
见到你真好
You look great.

372
00:24:04,26 --> 00:24:05,23
你气色很好
- It's good to see you. - You too. Oh, remember my Junie?

373
00:24:05,33 --> 00:24:06,70
见到你真好

374
00:24:07,43 --> 00:24:10,06
记得茱妮吧 茱妮，你好吗?
Hey, Junie. How are you?

375
00:24:10,14 --> 00:24:12,66
我们很好，谢谢
- We're doin' good, thank you. - Good, good.

376
00:24:11,86 --> 00:24:14,29
You look happy.

377
00:24:13,77 --> 00:24:15,17
看来你很幸福
Well, I am happy. I really am.

378
00:24:15,24 --> 00:24:17,44
我是很幸福，真的
So what happened here?

379
00:24:18,14 --> 00:24:19,44
这里是怎么回事?
- What do you mean? - Well, it's nice.

380
00:24:19,51 --> 00:24:21,50
什么意思?这极不错，但…
But the chop shop, the stripped cars, my education.

381
00:24:21,58 --> 00:24:25,24
诉车厂、解体车… 我的学校呢?

382
00:24:25,32 --> 00:24:28,12
怎么回事?
What happened? Hey.

383
00:24:28,19 --> 00:24:32,12
老了，就是这样 我不想再诉解车子了
Old age happened. That's what happened.

384
00:24:29,78 --> 00:24:31,07
Got tired of killing 'em.

385
00:24:32,19 --> 00:24:37,63
接著我想到… 我不是毁灭者，是重生者
You know, I woke up one morning and thought,

386
00:24:33,65 --> 00:24:36,71
"I'm no longer a destroyer. I'm a means of resurrection."

387
00:24:37,70 --> 00:24:40,17
我们修复、重组
Now we restore, we revive.

388
00:24:40,70 --> 00:24:43,07
过来，记得怎么玩吧?
<i>Come here. Remember we used to do this?</i>

389
00:24:43,14 --> 00:24:44,33
过来
- What? - You know. Come here. Okay.

390
00:24:46,44 --> 00:24:49,60
法拉利365GTB一4
It's a Ferrari 365 GTB-4 Daytona.

391
00:24:49,68 --> 00:24:52,94
勒曼大赛，l971年
Le Mans, 1971.

392
00:24:53,01 --> 00:24:54,78
四凸轮轴     Vl2引擎
<i>- Five cam... - That's a V-12.</i>

393
00:24:54,85 --> 00:24:56,48
没错、没错…
V-12, right, right, right, right!

394
00:24:56,55 --> 00:25:01,82
转速到顶点了，转速5500
Here it peaks at 5,500 r.p.m.!

395
00:25:01,82 --> 00:25:03,62
告诉我卡雷蒙的事
- What do you know about Raymond Calitri? - Who?

396
00:25:04,12 --> 00:25:06,59
谁? 卡雷蒙
Raymond Calitri.

397
00:25:07,45 --> 00:25:10,51
Uh, excuse us, sweetness. I'll be right back.

398
00:25:09,40 --> 00:25:11,09
抱歉，我们马上回来
- We can talk here. - No, no, no, no, no. It's all right.

399
00:25:11,20 --> 00:25:13,76
可以在这里讲    不、不…

400
00:25:13,87 --> 00:25:15,73
卡雷蒙
Raymond Calitri.

401
00:25:15,80 --> 00:25:20,90
他是个压榨弱者的豺狼
He's a jackal tearing at the soft belly of our... of our fair town.

402
00:25:20,09 --> 00:25:24,76
And he's an asshole to boot, so be careful.

403
00:25:22,38 --> 00:25:25,64
他也是个混蛋，要小心他

404
00:25:25,71 --> 00:25:27,65
我始说奇普的事了
I heard about Kip. Are you considering a comeback tour?

405
00:25:28,68 --> 00:25:30,58
你想重出江湖?
- Do you think it can be done? - Don't do this to me, okay?

406
00:25:30,65 --> 00:25:32,24
可行吗

407
00:25:32,32 --> 00:25:35,05
别这么对我
Please, please not now.

408
00:25:35,12 --> 00:25:38,06
拜托，不是现在

409
00:25:39,49 --> 00:25:41,43
天啊
<i>Oh, man.</i>

410
00:25:47,53 --> 00:25:49,13
要多少车?
<i>- How many cars? - Fifty.</i>

411
00:25:49,20 --> 00:25:50,86
五十辆
<i>- How many days? - Three.</i>

412
00:25:51,10 --> 00:25:53,87
几天时间?三天

413
00:25:53,66 --> 00:25:55,92
How many in your crew?

414
00:25:55,31 --> 00:25:56,78
有多少人手?
One, but I came here hoping to negotiate for a second.

415
00:25:56,84 --> 00:26:00,30
一个，我来这是想找第二个

416
00:26:00,38 --> 00:26:02,35
不行，不可能的
No way. It can't be done.

417
00:26:02,35 --> 00:26:04,82
你需要时间准备、找目标
I mean, you need time to prep, time to shop. You know that.

418
00:26:04,88 --> 00:26:08,34
一定得成功，他们会杀了他
It has to be. They're gonna kill him.

419
00:26:12,39 --> 00:26:13,95
天啊
Oh, man.

420
00:26:22,94 --> 00:26:25,30
我不该来的
It was a mistake to come here.

421
00:26:24,49 --> 00:26:28,62
You have a great life now. I don't want to upset that.

422
00:26:26,44 --> 00:26:29,50
你过的很好，我不该打扰你

423
00:26:32,33 --> 00:26:36,83
<i>Uh, wait a minute. Uh, hold on.</i>

424
00:26:34,18 --> 00:26:36,38
等等，等一等

425
00:26:37,18 --> 00:26:39,08
看看这里
Look around you.

426
00:26:39,82 --> 00:26:44,31
这些日子以来 我完全相信第二次机会
These days... I'm all about second chances.

427
00:26:44,39 --> 00:26:48,16
我们先打几个电话 事成后再重新出发
So, uh, let's make a few phone calls, and we'll go from there, okay?

428
00:26:47,35 --> 00:26:49,84
Okay.

429
00:26:48,86 --> 00:26:50,76
好
- Don't look at me! Look at the people next to you!

430
00:26:52,33 --> 00:26:56,27
别看我，看旁边的架驶 转弯

431
00:26:54,22 --> 00:26:56,69
That's... Turn the wheel!

432
00:26:57,67 --> 00:26:59,50
靠边、靠边停
Pull over! Pull her the hell over!

433
00:27:01,41 --> 00:27:02,81
混蛋
Asshole!

434
00:27:02,91 --> 00:27:04,71
认真学开车吧
Learn how to drive!

435
00:27:04,83 --> 00:27:08,77
Don't touch nothing. Just...

436
00:27:06,95 --> 00:27:08,88
别碰任何东西

437
00:27:08,83 --> 00:27:11,67
No!

438
00:27:12,95 --> 00:27:16,35
你不会转弯、不会打灯号
You can't negotiate turns. You can't signal properly.

439
00:27:16,42 --> 00:27:18,05
不会保持速度
You can't maintain speed. You can't parallel park. Hell, you can't drive, honey.

440
00:27:18,12 --> 00:27:20,18
不会路边停车

441
00:27:20,29 --> 00:27:21,78
你根本不会开车
Shit, I can't swim. I know I can't.

442
00:27:21,89 --> 00:27:24,19
我不会游泳，我有自知之明

443
00:27:24,26 --> 00:27:27,63
所以我根本不去游泳池
So you know what I do? I stay my black ass outta the pool.

444
00:27:28,23 --> 00:27:30,57
好吧，你…
All right now, just...

445
00:27:34,27 --> 00:27:35,33
拜托…
Can you... Oh! Hello?

446
00:27:36,16 --> 00:27:40,66
Memphis! Hey, how are you?

447
00:27:38,31 --> 00:27:41,47
曼斐，你好吗?

448
00:27:42,15 --> 00:27:44,38
当然…何时?
Sure, sure. When? Okay.

449
00:27:45,45 --> 00:27:46,35
好
- 32969811. - All right. Thanks a lot.

450
00:27:46,95 --> 00:27:48,82
多谢了，兄弟
Donny.

451
00:27:50,09 --> 00:27:50,92
唐尼

452
00:27:52,59 --> 00:27:55,39
绕着街角开，好吗?
Just take it around the block a couple of times, okay?

453
00:27:55,50 --> 00:27:56,79
好
<i>All right.</i>

454
00:28:03,40 --> 00:28:06,30
你好，我找费法阑
Hello. I'm calling for Frankie Fish.

455
00:28:06,37 --> 00:28:09,31
他死了，被人砍死的
Frank's dead, man. Yeah, he got scragged.

456
00:28:09,38 --> 00:28:10,57
抱歉
- I'm sorry. - Uh, yeah, I'm looking for Henry Santoro.

457
00:28:11,98 --> 00:28:13,57
我找桑亨利
He went down to Florida with that asshole Frankie Fish.

458
00:28:13,65 --> 00:28:16,05
他跟那个费法阑去佛罗里达了

459
00:28:16,12 --> 00:28:17,58
叫他把钱还给我
<i>- Tell him I want my money. - I didn't mess with your money.</i>

460
00:28:17,65 --> 00:28:18,91
我没拿你的钱
Yes, ma'am. I'm looking for Dan and Mikey.

461
00:28:18,99 --> 00:28:20,82
我找丹和来基
Both of 'em up to Chino. Doin' a nickel apiece.

462
00:28:20,89 --> 00:28:23,58
他们在蹲苦牢，要蹲五年

463
00:28:23,66 --> 00:28:25,65
我才不告诉你我是谁
Now I'm not so sure I want to tell you who this is.

464
00:28:25,73 --> 00:28:27,25
你敢，混球
- Yeah, try it, asshole. - You sound very busy right now.

465
00:28:27,36 --> 00:28:28,99
你听起来很忙
You sound very, very busy.

466
00:28:30,10 --> 00:28:31,32
真的很忙

467
00:28:33,02 --> 00:28:36,15
Whew. There's only two names left.

468
00:28:35,47 --> 00:28:37,44
只剩两个了
Yeah? Let me see.

469
00:28:37,50 --> 00:28:39,70
让我看是谁

470
00:28:40,61 --> 00:28:42,97
"史芬克、莎薇" 那两个，不可能的
<i>Those two? No way.</i>

471
00:28:43,04 --> 00:28:44,51
没别人了
There's no one else.

472
00:28:44,58 --> 00:28:46,48
你确定?
Are you sure?

473
00:28:49,28 --> 00:28:51,34
你跟他讲 为什么是我?
- You tell him. - Listen, why should I...

474
00:28:51,42 --> 00:28:54,05
是你接的电话 好吧
- Come on! - You were the one who answered the phone.

475
00:28:54,12 --> 00:28:56,71
他又不会说话要怎么讲电括?
- Fine! Fine! - But how's a guy who can't speak gonna take a phone call?

476
00:28:56,79 --> 00:28:58,42
你有电话
<i>You've got a call!</i>

477
00:29:15,11 --> 00:29:16,54
史芬克，是你吗?
Sphinx, is that you?

478
00:29:17,81 --> 00:29:19,90
是你的话就按个钮
Press a button if it's you.

479
00:29:27,99 --> 00:29:30,58
莎薇，你要修刹车?
Sway, you set up this brake job?

480
00:29:30,66 --> 00:29:34,89
对，刹车轴变形了 他开车习惯不好
<i>Yeah. He warped all four rotors.</i>

481
00:29:32,11 --> 00:29:34,55
<i>Must've been ridin' those brakes like an old lady.</i>

482
00:29:34,99 --> 00:29:36,22
好
<i>- That's nice. - Sounds like the left bank's running lean.</i>

483
00:29:36,33 --> 00:29:38,76
听来左边的汽缸有问题

484
00:29:49,94 --> 00:29:52,27
客户服务部在那边
The service department's over there.

485
00:29:52,88 --> 00:29:54,18
能跟你谈谈吗?
- Can I talk to you? - Talk to me? Yeah, sure, talk.

486
00:29:54,25 --> 00:29:56,58
跟我谈?好，谈吧

487
00:29:56,65 --> 00:29:58,17
我回来的原因是…
- The thing of it is, I came back because... - Do you know what time it is?

488
00:29:58,25 --> 00:30:00,15
几点了?

489
00:30:01,42 --> 00:30:03,08
五点半
It's 5:30. I came back because...

490
00:30:03,16 --> 00:30:04,32
我回来的原因是…
I gotta go. I'm late for work.

491
00:30:04,39 --> 00:30:06,19
我上班迟了

492
00:30:09,08 --> 00:30:11,02
You're at work.

493
00:30:10,83 --> 00:30:11,89
你已经在上班了
I got two jobs.

494
00:30:12,33 --> 00:30:14,32
我有两个工作

495
00:30:14,09 --> 00:30:19,89
I have discovered that you have to work twice as hard when it's honest.

496
00:30:15,84 --> 00:30:20,77
我发现要不犯法养活自己就得加倍努力

497
00:30:27,11 --> 00:30:28,94
莎薇，再给我一杯吧?
- Hey, Sway, can I get another shot? - Yep.

498
00:30:29,78 --> 00:30:32,05
你还是那么迷人
Still lookin' amazing.

499
00:30:32,12 --> 00:30:34,64
你倒像卖圣经的推销员
While you look like a Bible salesman.

500
00:30:35,12 --> 00:30:35,88
你得救了
You're healed.

501
00:30:37,46 --> 00:30:39,29
我们能不能自然点?
<i>Can we improvise a little bit?</i>

502
00:30:39,39 --> 00:30:42,05
当然，你在想什么?
Sure. What do you have in mind? Wanna get a little crazy?

503
00:30:42,16 --> 00:30:43,56
后面有辆奥斯摩比
There's a Cutlass 442 in the back we can strip down and shine the hood.

504
00:30:43,63 --> 00:30:46,72
我们可以脱光在引擎盖上打滚 怎样?
- What do you say? - Uh, that's not what I had in mind.

505
00:30:47,30 --> 00:30:49,43
我不是想这个
No?

506
00:30:51,54 --> 00:30:53,97
是我弟弟的事
It's about my brother.

507
00:30:54,21 --> 00:30:55,67
奇普有麻烦了
- Kip's in trouble. - I n trouble?

508
00:30:55,74 --> 00:30:58,21
他搞砸了一庄买卖
- Took a boost, and he blew it. - Shit.

509
00:30:57,83 --> 00:31:01,60
And you got some Italians?

510
00:31:01,45 --> 00:31:02,47
所以你得偷些意大利跑车?
<i>- Five or six. - Right.</i>

511
00:31:02,92 --> 00:31:04,82
五或六辆
It's 50 ladies in 24 hours, $200,000.

512
00:31:04,88 --> 00:31:08,48
二十四小时内弄五十辆 有二十万

513
00:31:08,99 --> 00:31:11,32
我已退出江湖了
Well, I've cleaned up.

514
00:31:15,53 --> 00:31:18,79
我了解，我真不愿意来问你
I understand. I hate to even come here and ask...

515
00:31:18,86 --> 00:31:20,80
莎薇，我的酒呢?
Sway, can I get that drink now, please?

516
00:31:20,87 --> 00:31:22,66
我也去问了其他人
I had to ask a few of the others too, and I feel bad about it, but...

517
00:31:22,74 --> 00:31:25,00
我感觉很不好
- But you had no choice. You had to come here... - Pretty much.

518
00:31:25,07 --> 00:31:27,37
但你别无选择 没错

519
00:31:28,07 --> 00:31:30,04
很抱歉
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

520
00:31:30,11 --> 00:31:31,17
没关系

521
00:31:33,25 --> 00:31:37,11
我想帮奇普 但我不想再偷车了
I'd love to help Kip, but I-I'm not into the life anymore.

522
00:31:39,35 --> 00:31:41,41
那很好
Well, that's a good thing.

523
00:31:40,64 --> 00:31:44,47
- Yeah. - I'm glad to see you're doing well.

524
00:31:43,46 --> 00:31:45,36
很高兴你过的很好
Sorry, I can't help you.

525
00:31:45,56 --> 00:31:47,62
抱歉我不能帮你
- I'd like to pay for your drink. - That's fine.

526
00:31:47,96 --> 00:31:51,19
我请你吧 好

527
00:31:53,33 --> 00:31:54,30
我的酒呢?
How about that drink?

528
00:31:56,30 --> 00:31:59,27
是啊，酒呢?
Yeah, how about that drink?

529
00:31:59,84 --> 00:32:03,38
姓雷的，雷曼斐
<i>Raines! Memphis Raines, huh?</i>

530
00:32:03,38 --> 00:32:04,54
我认识你吗?
<i>- Do I know you? - Well, you should know me...</i>

531
00:32:04,61 --> 00:32:06,34
你该认识
considering all the business you done screwed up for me in the past, baby.

532
00:32:06,41 --> 00:32:09,85
你搞砸了我所有的买卖

533
00:32:09,92 --> 00:32:12,44
你是强尼毕 没错
- Johnny B. - That's me.

534
00:32:13,12 --> 00:32:14,52
我能为你效劳吗?
What can I do for you?

535
00:32:14,59 --> 00:32:17,32
帮我一个忙
Well, I'm gonna tell you what you can do for me, baby.

536
00:32:17,82 --> 00:32:20,19
今晚就离开长堤
Get out of Long Beach, tonight.

537
00:32:20,29 --> 00:32:22,76
我回来处理家务事
I'll be gone in three days. I'm just here on some family business.

538
00:32:21,91 --> 00:32:26,01
Word on the street says Raymond Calitri hired you and your brother...

539
00:32:23,43 --> 00:32:25,09
传言说…

540
00:32:25,20 --> 00:32:27,93
卡雷蒙有笔大买卖
for a top order, a order that should've went to me.

541
00:32:28,00 --> 00:32:30,20
本来该给我的，他却雇了你
That's not the way it went down, Johnny.

542
00:32:30,27 --> 00:32:31,70
事情不是这样的

543
00:32:44,10 --> 00:32:48,51
Hey! Get away from my car, asshole!

544
00:32:45,82 --> 00:32:49,38
别碰我的车，混球

545
00:33:03,70 --> 00:33:06,30
你有什么遗言吗??
<i>Got somethin' to say before I kill you, fool?</i>

546
00:33:26,29 --> 00:33:27,88
史芬克…
Sphinx. Otto send you?

547
00:33:29,03 --> 00:33:30,72
奥图叫你来的?

548
00:33:46,65 --> 00:33:48,14
爸…
Oh, Dad.

549
00:33:50,08 --> 00:33:53,42
若他在世，我们会做业务员
We'd probably both be working at the dealership if he hadn't died,

550
00:33:53,49 --> 00:33:55,11
就跟普通人一样
just like normal people.

551
00:33:56,19 --> 00:33:57,85
妈的
Shit.

552
00:34:03,26 --> 00:34:04,29
怎么了?
What's the matter with you?

553
00:34:04,48 --> 00:34:08,61
Eh, six years does a lot of different things to people.

554
00:34:07,23 --> 00:34:09,53
六年时间会改变很多事
<i>You know, I don't know where you went, but...</i>

555
00:34:09,60 --> 00:34:12,70
我不知道你去哪了，但…

556
00:34:12,77 --> 00:34:15,80
你来了，跟我谈做普通人
you know, you're in there, you're talking about being normal...

557
00:34:15,88 --> 00:34:19,00
但你以前却不务正业
<i>I mean, you were always the one who was goin' after the easy money.</i>

558
00:34:23,52 --> 00:34:25,75
我偷车不是为了钱
I didn't do it for the money.

559
00:34:28,49 --> 00:34:30,11
我是为了车子
I did it for the cars.

560
00:34:33,99 --> 00:34:36,29
闪亮的海蓝色…
Gleaming in marina blue,

561
00:34:36,40 --> 00:34:39,09
亮桔黄
sunfire yellow,

562
00:34:39,20 --> 00:34:41,10
艳绯红
Marlboro red.

563
00:34:41,57 --> 00:34:45,26
求我带走它们
<i>Begging to be plucked.</i>

564
00:34:46,31 --> 00:34:48,27
我就下手了
And I'd do it.

565
00:34:49,14 --> 00:34:51,37
我偷了她
I'd boost her...

566
00:34:51,44 --> 00:34:54,57
狂飙过棕搁泉
and just blast to Palm Springs,

567
00:34:54,65 --> 00:34:58,31
立刻觉得全身舒畅
instantly feeling better about being me.

568
00:34:57,50 --> 00:35:01,30
<i>And then the next day, it seems like,</i>

569
00:34:59,08 --> 00:35:02,12
后来，不久之后…

570
00:35:02,12 --> 00:35:06,22
我中了枪 我的朋友们也很惨
<i>I'm getting shot at, my friends are dying,</i>

571
00:35:06,29 --> 00:35:08,35
大家都去坐牢了
<i>people are going to jail.</i>

572
00:35:08,56 --> 00:35:11,09
我不喜欢变成这样
I didn't like what I'd become.

573
00:35:14,67 --> 00:35:17,53
是啊，接著你就跑了
Yeah, and then you left,

574
00:35:17,60 --> 00:35:21,13
然后我就没了大哥
and then I didn't have a brother anymore,

575
00:35:21,21 --> 00:35:23,11
现在你却想…
<i>and now you want to give me advice...</i>

576
00:35:23,18 --> 00:35:24,16
教训我
<i>and I don't even know you.</i>

577
00:35:24,24 --> 00:35:26,27
而我根本不了解你
<i>And, you know, I got my own family now, I got my own friends.</i>

578
00:35:26,35 --> 00:35:28,18
我现在有自己的家人了

579
00:35:28,25 --> 00:35:29,87
我有朋友
And you can say what you want about them, but they're loyal.

580
00:35:29,95 --> 00:35:33,21
随你怎么说，但他们很忠实

581
00:35:35,32 --> 00:35:39,31
一犯法，情形也会一样
Well, when you hit the wall, the same thing's gonna happen.

582
00:35:39,39 --> 00:35:42,02
你和你的家人
You and your family...

583
00:35:41,21 --> 00:35:44,41
<i>are either gonna get shot...</i>

584
00:35:43,43 --> 00:35:45,33
不是送命…
or get a five-year jolt at Corcoran.

585
00:35:46,17 --> 00:35:48,50
就是会被送进牢里蹲五年

586
00:35:53,67 --> 00:35:56,87
(汽车窃案防治局)

587
00:35:58,81 --> 00:36:02,68
我们扣留的那三部宝士…
<i>Those Mercedes we impounded? Need those newfangled laser-cut keys.</i>

588
00:36:02,68 --> 00:36:05,41
全都来自德斯进口汽车
Each one's from Dressner Foreign Motors downtown Newport...

589
00:36:05,48 --> 00:36:08,82
里面只有这个赖詹姆有前科
where all the employees are clean, except for him.

590
00:36:08,89 --> 00:36:11,86
因汽车保险金诈骗案坐过牢
James Lakewood. Served a nickel at Folsom for auto insurance fraud.

591
00:36:11,51 --> 00:36:16,78
My gosh, I bet he just neglected to mention that to the people at Dressner Foreign Motors, huh?

592
00:36:13,16 --> 00:36:17,53
我敢说他没跟公司被的人提过

593
00:36:17,60 --> 00:36:23,03
更劲爆的消息是 他跟宝士总公司申请备用车轮
It gets better. Young James there places orders for lost keys...

594
00:36:19,99 --> 00:36:23,58
to the Mercedes home office in Germany.

595
00:36:24,64 --> 00:36:28,77
(距最后期限42小时)

596
00:36:29,74 --> 00:36:31,23
这是清单
The list.

597
00:36:32,04 --> 00:36:36,85
我们开始想办法找车吧…
The list. I guess we gotta start beating the bushes and try to find out where they...

598
00:36:35,07 --> 00:36:38,50
<i>- Whoa! 1967 Shelby GT-500. - I know. I know.</i>

599
00:36:36,92 --> 00:36:39,35
67年野马GT500? 我知道

600
00:36:39,42 --> 00:36:40,78
伊琳诺也在上面?
- You got Eleanor here? - Otto, there's somebody here to see you.

601
00:36:41,09 --> 00:36:42,92
奥图，有人找你

602
00:36:44,99 --> 00:36:47,25
小狗长大了
<i>Oh, the puppy's a big dog now!</i>

603
00:36:46,44 --> 00:36:50,54
<i>- How are you doin'? - Hey there, Kip, what is this... What's that up under there?</i>

604
00:36:48,76 --> 00:36:51,42
奇普，你也会长胡子啊

605
00:36:50,62 --> 00:36:53,11
Hey, Otto, how you doin'?

606
00:36:52,93 --> 00:36:56,16
奥图，好久不见，幸会了
It's a long time. Good to see you.

607
00:36:55,32 --> 00:36:57,69
What are you doin' here, Kip?

608
00:36:57,30 --> 00:36:58,53
你来这干么?
- Well, we actually came to talk about some things. - About what?

609
00:36:58,60 --> 00:37:02,17
我们来谈事情的 谈什么?

610
00:37:02,17 --> 00:37:05,20
你们似乎需要人帮忙
Well, you know, it seems like you guys need a little help,

611
00:37:05,28 --> 00:37:07,61
我们觉得我们可以参与
<i>and we thought that we should participate.</i>

612
00:37:07,68 --> 00:37:09,65
但是妈要你别碰这件事
But I just promised Mom I was getting you out of this.

613
00:37:09,72 --> 00:37:11,95
这庄买卖值一大笔钱
No, no, we're talking about a lot of money here.

614
00:37:12,02 --> 00:37:14,85
什么，钱? 你别想拿走我们的钱
- And if you guys think you're gonna get into our Kool-Aid... - - What? Money?

615
00:37:14,92 --> 00:37:17,72
你这个令人讨厌的小混混
Is that why you think I'm doing this, you inconsiderate little punk!

616
00:37:17,79 --> 00:37:19,92
三个失意的偷车贼…
If you wanna participate, well, then you call Mom and you explain to her...

617
00:37:19,99 --> 00:37:24,99
好，去跟妈说你受到伤害了 两天内才偷不到50辆车
<i>Can you explain how you are gonna steal 50 cars in two days?</i>

618
00:37:23,75 --> 00:37:27,05
Hey. Hey.

619
00:37:28,03 --> 00:37:30,90
这就是我不跟家人合伙的原因
This is why I do not do business with family.

620
00:37:30,97 --> 00:37:33,37
你该考虑一下
I think you should consider this.

621
00:37:33,44 --> 00:37:36,90
不，他不能再犯法了
Oh, come on, Otto, please. No, his criminal career has come to an end.

622
00:37:36,98 --> 00:37:39,57
我们若不能成功，他也死定了
Well, his life will come to an end unless we pull this off.

623
00:37:39,65 --> 00:37:43,48
没有他我们也成不了事 你知道的
How can we do it without them? It can't be done, and you know it.

624
00:37:48,25 --> 00:37:49,65
你们有专长吗?
You guys have any skills at all?

625
00:37:48,87 --> 00:37:51,43
- Please! - Yeah, we have skills.

626
00:37:50,76 --> 00:37:55,75
有，藏镜人是电子专家
We... Mirror Man here, he's an electronics expert.

627
00:37:55,86 --> 00:37:59,19
他有些工具你们根本闻所未闻
You know, he's got some gadgets that... that you old farts probably never heard of.

628
00:37:59,26 --> 00:38:03,44
只要有轮子的东西小飞都能开
You know, uh, Tumbler over here, he can pretty much drive anything with wheels...

629
00:38:03,44 --> 00:38:05,60
有些没轮子的也行
<i>and, you know, some things without wheels.</i>

630
00:38:05,67 --> 00:38:08,80
托比是电脑天才
And, uh, and Toby, he's a computer genius.

631
00:38:08,87 --> 00:38:11,67
他能用电脑做很多事
He's... He does fascinating things with computers.

632
00:38:11,74 --> 00:38:14,58
你用电脑能干嘛?
What exactly can you do with a computer, Toby?

633
00:38:14,65 --> 00:38:16,62
我能入侵监理所的主机
I can hack into the D.M.V. Mainframe.

634
00:38:16,68 --> 00:38:18,65
改变引擎号码
<i>I can change VIN numbers. I can change addresses, registrations.</i>

635
00:38:18,72 --> 00:38:20,48
窜改地址、注册内容
I can do a lot of really tricky stuff. I can.

636
00:38:20,55 --> 00:38:22,92
我能做很多事

637
00:38:22,99 --> 00:38:26,15
好，要做就照我的方法去做
All right, all right. We do this, we do it my way.

638
00:38:26,23 --> 00:38:30,86
听我的指挥行事 不高兴就滚蛋
I run the show. You take your orders from me.

639
00:38:27,85 --> 00:38:29,94
If you have any problems with that, you can leave now.

640
00:38:30,96 --> 00:38:32,93
不，那样很好
No, that's fine. That's fine.

641
00:38:33,00 --> 00:38:34,66
怎么会有个笨小孩在这?
<i>- Well, who is Gilligan here, and what does he do? - Gilligan is actually Freb.</i>

642
00:38:34,73 --> 00:38:36,83
笨小孩叫小佛
- Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business. - What?

643
00:38:37,14 --> 00:38:39,63
他叫披萨的本事一流 什么?

644
00:38:39,71 --> 00:38:40,73
及时送达
<i>- It's true. - Hey, people gotta eat, right?</i>

645
00:38:41,61 --> 00:38:43,34
人都得吃饭吧?

646
00:38:44,94 --> 00:38:47,14
这太过分了
This is outrageous. I want my lawyer.

647
00:38:47,21 --> 00:38:50,84
我要找律即 律师来我才说括
I'm not saying a word till I get a lawyer.

648
00:38:52,15 --> 00:38:55,59
那是个选择 也很合理
All right, James, that's an option.

649
00:38:53,34 --> 00:38:55,70
And frankly, a reasonable one.

650
00:38:56,92 --> 00:38:58,58
你找律师吧
So you call your lawyer, James.

651
00:38:58,66 --> 00:39:02,89
我们会以窃车罪名逮捕你 并起诉你
You tell him you've been arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto.

652
00:39:01,05 --> 00:39:03,07
<i>- We indict you. - He'll bail you out.</i>

653
00:39:02,93 --> 00:39:05,12
他会保你出来 我们就等著法庭见
- And we move on to trial. - Okay, okay.

654
00:39:05,23 --> 00:39:06,29
好吧，好吧

655
00:39:08,00 --> 00:39:11,80
有个小子来找我 说他付五百万一支钥匙
A kid came to me, said he'd pay $500 a key.

656
00:39:12,81 --> 00:39:15,71
所以我申请钥匙
So I put the order forms through, and he picked 'em up a couple days later.

657
00:39:16,14 --> 00:39:17,57
他钱天校再来取货
- What's the kid's name? - We kept it anonymous.

658
00:39:17,64 --> 00:39:19,13
他叫什么?

659
00:39:19,38 --> 00:39:21,35
这是匿名交易
He was a well-built kid. Uh, looks like a boxer.

660
00:39:22,15 --> 00:39:25,98
他体格很好，像个拳击手

661
00:39:27,32 --> 00:39:29,01
你们要我怎么做?
- What do you want me to do? - When he comes back, you call us.

662
00:39:29,09 --> 00:39:30,95
他再来就通知我们
- What says he comes back? - A hunch.

663
00:39:31,02 --> 00:39:32,25
你怎知他会再来?

664
00:39:33,29 --> 00:39:34,73
直觉4
To make the Friday 8:00 a.m. Deadline, you're gonna have to go old school.

665
00:39:34,89 --> 00:39:38,19
要及时完成任务就得照规矩来

666
00:39:38,26 --> 00:39:42,60
行动集中在一个晚上孤注一掷
A one-night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket, okay?

667
00:39:42,87 --> 00:39:45,50
一个晚上，你疯了?
<i>- One night? What, are you crazy? - Yes. No, I'm not crazy.</i>

668
00:39:45,57 --> 00:39:47,16
有更好的计划吗?
- What, do you have like a better plan or something'? - Yeah, you spread it out.

669
00:39:47,24 --> 00:39:49,57
有，分开行动、声动击西
- You play shadow games and shit. - We're on a truncated timetable.

670
00:39:49,64 --> 00:39:51,11
我们没时间
Otto, I'm sorry. Can you just listen to me for one second, all right?

671
00:39:51,18 --> 00:39:55,55
奥图，听我说 我们听见了，声东击西

672
00:39:53,37 --> 00:39:56,70
<i>We heard you, Kip. Shadow games. But what you have to understand...</i>

673
00:39:55,61 --> 00:39:58,64
要是玩声东击西…
is that if you play shadow games, by the second night, the heat is onto you.

674
00:39:58,72 --> 00:40:01,31
条子第二晚就会盯上了

675
00:40:01,39 --> 00:40:04,95
一个晚上行动 等有人报窃案
With a one-night boost, by the time the first car's reported stolen,

676
00:40:05,29 --> 00:40:06,69
车子早装船了
your ship's set sail; it's a surprise attack.

677
00:40:06,79 --> 00:40:08,32
这是偷袭
This is a complicated list, fellas, it really is, okay?

678
00:40:08,86 --> 00:40:12,49
这清单很复杂，真的

679
00:40:12,90 --> 00:40:15,56
其中25辆没问题，不过…
<i>There are 25 that aren't a problem,</i>

680
00:40:15,63 --> 00:40:17,10
这些外国车很难找
but these exotics are tough to find.

681
00:40:17,17 --> 00:40:20,57
新款宝士又要有雷射钥匙
And the new Mercedes, they require laser-cut keys, okay?

682
00:40:20,64 --> 00:40:22,66
我有辨法
- Yeah, I got that covered. - You have that covered?

683
00:40:22,78 --> 00:40:24,04
什么?
- What'd I just say? Yeah, I got it covered. - Yeah.

684
00:40:24,11 --> 00:40:26,37
我说了，我有辨法 没错
All right, all right. Well, then let's get to work.

685
00:40:26,45 --> 00:40:29,04
好，大家开始工作吧

686
00:40:29,28 --> 00:40:31,31
托比，入侵保险资料库
<i>Toby, hack into the insurance database...</i>

687
00:40:31,38 --> 00:40:33,25
设法找车
<i>and find as many cars as you can.</i>

688
00:40:33,75 --> 00:40:37,48
找到希拉蕊、纳塔莉和崔茜了
<i>Yes! I got addresses on Hillary, Natalie and Tracy.</i>

689
00:40:37,56 --> 00:40:40,89
唐尼，到监理所查其他的车
<i>Donny, check the D.M.V.For the remaining cars on the list.</i>

690
00:40:40,99 --> 00:40:44,19
抱歉，答错五题，你没通过
<i>I'm sorry, miss, but you've missed five questions.</i>

691
00:40:42,58 --> 00:40:45,61
<i>- That's a failing. - No!</i>

692
00:40:44,30 --> 00:40:46,39
不
<i>- Next. - No! Why?</i>

693
00:40:46,50 --> 00:40:48,76
不，为什么?

694
00:40:48,93 --> 00:40:51,80
有人跟紧车尾时 当然要开快点啊
You're supposed to go faster when somebody tailgates you.

695
00:40:51,87 --> 00:40:53,06
又见面了
<i>- Ah. Hello again. - Mm-hmm. Here's your list...</i>

696
00:40:53,14 --> 00:40:57,04
你要的二十个车主名字和地址
of the 20 car owners' names and addresses that you requested.

697
00:40:57,14 --> 00:40:59,27
谢啦 总共一百元
- Thank you. - That's $100, please.

698
00:40:59,34 --> 00:41:00,57
一百?
- A hundred dollars? - Well, five dollars a car.

699
00:41:00,65 --> 00:41:04,65
一辆车五元，共二十辆 要计算机吗?
Twenty cars. Would you like a calculator?

700
00:41:04,65 --> 00:41:07,85
以前一辆只要二元 多谢了
It used to be two dollars a car. Thanks a lot.

701
00:41:07,04 --> 00:41:11,10
My name's Roger, sir. May I be of some help?

702
00:41:09,05 --> 00:41:11,96
我是罗杰，需要效劳吗?

703
00:41:13,86 --> 00:41:15,69
怪了，我也叫罗杰
That's funny, my name's Roger. Two Rogers don't make a right.

704
00:41:15,79 --> 00:41:18,32
一山不能容二虎
- Roger, I have a problem. - Yes?

705
00:41:18,83 --> 00:41:21,66
我有个问题 我到洛杉矶三个月了
I've been in L.A. For three months now. I have money, I have taste.

706
00:41:21,73 --> 00:41:23,50
我有财富、品味…
But I'm not on anybody's "A" list,

707
00:41:23,57 --> 00:41:25,04
但我却不受人注意
and Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week for me.

708
00:41:25,10 --> 00:41:27,70
周六晚上更是寂寞

709
00:41:28,61 --> 00:41:30,63
一台法拉利可以改变这一切
- Oh. A Ferrari would certainly change that. - Perhaps. Mmm.

710
00:41:30,71 --> 00:41:32,57
也许吧，但是…
But, you know, this is the one. Yes, yes, yes.

711
00:41:32,91 --> 00:41:34,94
就是这辆，没错
I saw three of these parked outside the local Starbucks this morning,

712
00:41:35,01 --> 00:41:38,97
我今天在咖啡店外就看到了三辆

713
00:41:39,05 --> 00:41:45,08
这让我感觉到 这里太多有钱又放纵的笨蛋了
which tells me only one thing.

714
00:41:39,90 --> 00:41:44,20
There's too many self-indulgent wieners in this city with too much bloody money!

715
00:41:44,28 --> 00:41:47,21
Now, if I was driving...

716
00:41:45,82 --> 00:41:48,09
要是我开着一辆
a 1967275 GTB four-cam...

717
00:41:48,19 --> 00:41:52,56
67年的275GTB…

718
00:41:52,97 --> 00:41:57,06
你就不是笨蛋，是个鉴赏家
You would not be a self-indulgent weiner, sir.

719
00:41:54,72 --> 00:41:57,15
- You'd be a connoisseur. - Precisely.

720
00:41:57,14 --> 00:41:59,90
没错，香槟会从天上洒下
Champagne would fall from the heavens.

721
00:41:59,97 --> 00:42:03,24
大家会争相欢迎我
Doors would open. Velvet ropes would part.

722
00:42:03,74 --> 00:42:08,18
这里没有，但仓库里有一辆
I don't have one here,

723
00:42:04,76 --> 00:42:07,36
however I do have one in the warehouse.

724
00:42:08,25 --> 00:42:09,24
太好了
Superb.

725
00:42:10,58 --> 00:42:12,38
仓库里还有什么车?
What else do you have in the warehouse?

<i>Mm-hmm. All right. Uh-huh.</i>

727
00:42:14,39 --> 00:42:16,58
很好

728
00:42:17,79 --> 00:42:19,98
是车商那里的赖詹姆
That was Mr. Lakewood from the dealership.

729
00:42:20,09 --> 00:42:24,55
那小子今天会去拿三支新钥匙
<i>He says that boxer-looking punk is gonna pick up the keys...</i>

730
00:42:21,48 --> 00:42:23,67

731
00:42:24,66 --> 00:42:27,46
车款跟我们扣留的一样
Same make and models as the ones we already got impounded.

732
00:42:27,53 --> 00:42:29,00
好戏上场了
Now we're talkin'.

736
00:42:39,14 --> 00:42:42,67
将车都放距此45分车程处
We'll target all the cars within 45 minutes of here.

737
00:42:42,92 --> 00:42:45,88
等到车子追踪系统启动时…
<i>By the time their alarm tracking systems are activated,</i>

738
00:42:45,95 --> 00:42:48,65
所有车子早就进货柜了
<i>the cars will already be in these containers.</i>

739
00:42:57,03 --> 00:42:59,36
各位，这是莎薇
Fellas, this is Sway.

740
00:43:00,33 --> 00:43:02,80
别发问，我是来帮奇普的
No questions. I'm here for Kip.

741
00:43:02,05 --> 00:43:04,15
<i>- All right. - All right.</i>

742
00:43:20,75 --> 00:43:22,38
是我，他来了
- It's me. He's here. - The red Chevy Nova?

743
00:43:22,45 --> 00:43:23,65
开红色雪佛阑的?
That's affirmative, sir.

744
00:43:23,72 --> 00:43:25,62
没错

745
00:43:26,76 --> 00:43:29,66
他一走，就把车主地址给我
As soon as he leaves, you call me with the owners' addresses, all right?

746
00:43:29,73 --> 00:43:32,20
我马上把表格拿过去
I'll get those forms right over, sir.

747
00:43:32,38 --> 00:43:36,25
Damn boss. Always on my case.

748
00:43:34,40 --> 00:43:37,20
讨厌的老阎，老爱盯我

749
00:43:37,27 --> 00:43:40,47
里面有三支?谢了
- I got three here? - Mm-hmm.

750
00:43:39,16 --> 00:43:41,39
Thank you.

00:43:52,54 --> 00:43:57,77
<i>Huh, Randall Raines, Donny Astricky, Otto Halliwell.</i>

752

雷曼斐、厄唐尼、哈奥图

753
00:43:59,22 --> 00:44:01,73
要派人盯梢吗?
Should I set up some tails?

754
00:44:00,01 --> 00:44:02,10
Uh-uh. They're too smart for that.

755
00:44:01,73 --> 00:44:04,82
他们太聪明了，那反而坏事
They'll just dump the cars.

756
00:44:04,93 --> 00:44:07,63
不，等他们偷宝士时再下手
No, we'll get them with the Mercedes.

757
00:44:08,27 --> 00:44:11,83
派三组人马盯车主家
Let's set up, uh, three surveillance teams at those addresses.

758
00:44:14,11 --> 00:44:16,73
你尽管动手吧
You go ahead and you make your move, man.

759
00:44:16,09 --> 00:44:18,82
And I will be waiting for you.

760
00:44:17,74 --> 00:44:19,68
我会等著你的

761
00:44:24,85 --> 00:44:26,78
干嘛都用女人的名字?
Why do you call 'em girls' names?

762
00:44:26,85 --> 00:44:29,79
是啊，干嘛这样?
<i>That's a good question. Why do you call 'em girls' names?</i>

763
00:44:29,86 --> 00:44:33,19
这是代号，珍、雪莉…
<i>It's code. You say Jane, you say Shirley, Lucy, Edna,</i>

764
00:44:33,29 --> 00:44:37,85
露西、艾德娜 有人监听就会搞不清楚
and nobody listening on the waves is the wiser.

765
00:44:39,03 --> 00:44:40,29
到手了
Got 'em.

766
00:44:44,49 --> 00:44:47,15
Okay.

767
00:44:48,14 --> 00:44:49,23
好了
All right, we've got the addresses on all 50 ladies. Let's scout 'em.

768
00:44:49,84 --> 00:44:52,40
五十位小姐的地址都有了

769
00:44:52,48 --> 00:44:53,47

770
00:44:59,28 --> 00:45:00,62
她在那里
- There she is. - Nice.

771
00:45:00,69 --> 00:45:02,28
很好
Damn, it's cold up here! They keep these Ferraris refrigerated?

772
00:45:02,45 --> 00:45:05,32
真冷 他们冷藏保存法拉利吗

773
00:45:05,39 --> 00:45:07,42
黑人不喜欢冷
And you know black people don't like cold weather! We're tropical people, man.

774
00:45:07,53 --> 00:45:08,65
我们是热带民族
When this is over, I'm gonna smoke a joint,

<i>It's a camera. Looks like he's just doing some homework.</i>

让他去吧，我不想打草惊蛇
<i>All right, let's leave him be.</i>

You know what? Let's go over to Otto's in the morning.

820
00:47:19,26 --> 00:47:22,23
查探一下，看有什么线索
Kick over some rocks, see what's underneath there.

821
00:47:21,95 --> 00:47:24,57
We saved the best for last.

没错,就是伊琳诺

00:47:44,88 --> 00:47:47,08
伊琳诺是曼斐的独角兽
Eleanor is Memphis's unicorn.

830
00:47:47,15 --> 00:47:48,48
什么是独角兽?
- What's a unicorn? - Fabled creature.

831
00:47:48,55 --> 00:47:52,51
传中的动物 有角的马，难以俘获
You know, the horse with the horn, impossible to capture.

832
00:47:52,66 --> 00:47:56,75
那种车…你一想偷它，就会发生事情
<i>It's the one car, no matter how many times you try to boost, something always happens.</i>

833
00:48:01,57 --> 00:48:04,03
这次不会有事的
We're gonna get through this this time, right? It's gonna be smooth...

834
00:48:04,44 --> 00:48:06,20

<i>- What's he doing? - And easy.</i>

835
00:48:06,44 --> 00:48:08,53
他在干嘛?别紧张
He's talkin' to her, man. Tryin' to get reacquainted.

836
00:48:08,61 --> 00:48:10,54
他在跟她说话

837
00:48:10,94 --> 00:48:14,24
重新熟悉，他们有段历史
<i>Done had a rough history. She almost got him killed a couple of times.</i>

838
00:48:14,31 --> 00:48:16,18
她有几次差点害死了他
<i>- I don't want any talking back. - He flipped one on the Harbor freeway.</i>

839
00:48:16,78 --> 00:48:18,98
不争执 在高速公路上翻过车
He went off the Long Beach pier once.

840
00:48:19,28 --> 00:48:21,28
掉进长堤码头一次
A smooth, easy ride.

841
00:48:21,35 --> 00:48:23,79
一次轻松自在的旅程

842
00:48:25,39 --> 00:48:27,38
我们要滑翔
We're just gonna glide.

843
00:48:30,33 --> 00:48:33,63
明晚很重要，我们回家吧
Big night tomorrow, guys. Let's go home.

844
00:48:34,43 --> 00:48:36,26
照好了?   好了
- Did you... Did you get the picture? - Yeah.

845
00:48:37,14 --> 00:48:38,86
明晚见，伊琳诺
See you tomorrow night, Eleanor, with your fine ass.

846
00:48:39,20 --> 00:48:41,17
你屁股长的具俏

847
00:48:44,18 --> 00:48:46,14
要吃点什么吗?
Man, we're almost home. You wanna get something to eat?

848
00:48:48,05 --> 00:48:50,24
我想喝杯巧克力麦芽
<i>I'd like to get a chocolate malt.</i>

849
00:49:02,33 --> 00:49:03,49
快下车
- Hey! - Get out of the car!

850
00:49:03,60 --> 00:49:07,43
快、快…
Go, go, go, go, go!

851
00:49:09,92 --> 00:49:12,36
Why are people shooting at us?

852
00:49:11,50 --> 00:49:14,87
他们干嘛对我们开枪? 我炸了他们的车
'Cause I blew up their car!

853
00:49:36,56 --> 00:49:37,22
这里
Over here!

854
00:49:43,37 --> 00:49:44,13
"野兽"
"Beast."

855
00:49:44,20 --> 00:49:45,10
野欺

856
00:49:45,86 --> 00:49:48,38
Okay, okay.

857
00:49:52,13 --> 00:49:55,06
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

858
00:49:53,68 --> 00:49:55,48
该死,真该死
Hey!

859
00:50:05,41 --> 00:50:09,51
Oh!

860
00:50:39,91 --> 00:50:42,64
<i>Oh, you... you think it's a game?</i>

861
00:50:42,19 --> 00:50:43,49
你以为这是在玩游戏吗?
Johnny B. Cops, man.

862
00:50:43,60 --> 00:50:46,62
强尼，有条子

863
00:50:45,82 --> 00:50:48,79
<i>I ain't got nothin' but time, baby.</i>

864
00:50:47,53 --> 00:50:49,83
我有的是时间

865
00:50:59,70 --> 00:51:02,72
Oh, man, we're gonna be here all night, man.

866
00:51:01,75 --> 00:51:03,61
我们会整晚待在这

867
00:51:05,65 --> 00:51:08,12
你看，警车
Look! Cop car! Uh-huh.

868
00:51:08,72 --> 00:51:13,12
只要我在这 你就得坐在那，一整晚
Long as I'm in here, you're just gonna sit out there, aren't ya? Aye?

869
00:51:15,63 --> 00:51:18,36
听着，计划是这样
Hey, listen, this is the plan.

870
00:51:18,46 --> 00:51:21,02
那里有辆牵引车
This is what we're gonna do. There's a big rig over there.

871
00:51:24,40 --> 00:51:28,30
外面那台牵引车是你的?
Uh, mister, is that your truck out there, the Big Rig Wrecker?

872
00:51:28,37 --> 00:51:30,40
没错 真酷
- Big Rig Wrecker's mine. - That's cool.

873
00:51:44,49 --> 00:51:47,22
我要去哪学习开它?
What do I gotta do? How do I learn? Where do I go?

874
00:51:47,29 --> 00:51:48,92
去卡车架训班
- Well, you gotta go to truck drivin' school. - Truck dri...

875
00:51:49,03 --> 00:51:51,69
我知道，我是说…
I know, man. I know. But I mean like, um... -

876
00:51:51,68 --> 00:51:56,18
- You boys ready to play a little pin the tail on the donkey?

877
00:51:53,26 --> 00:51:56,70
准备好要绝命大复仇了?

878
00:51:57,17 --> 00:51:59,97
我能请你吃个甜甜圈吗?不，我要走了
- Can I get you a jelly donut or something, man? - No, I'm just gonna go.

879
00:52:00,04 --> 00:52:03,37
我要吃松饼 改天吧
- 'Cause I'm gonna have a waffle. - Maybe next time, though.

880
00:52:23,23 --> 00:52:24,75
我要轰了你
I'm gonna smoke you!

881
00:52:39,70 --> 00:52:42,03
What the hell's going on?

882
00:52:44,68 --> 00:52:46,58
想喝点吗?
Want some of this?

883
00:52:46,14 --> 00:52:48,07
Yeah.

884
00:52:48,05 --> 00:52:48,92
好啊

885
00:52:51,56 --> 00:52:54,05
你们有武器持有证明吗?
- You guys got permits for these weapons? - Oh, man!

886
00:52:56,73 --> 00:53:03,03
(距最后期限24小时)

887
00:53:13,08 --> 00:53:15,88
你们以为我只会叫披萨吗?
So you think I can only get pizzas, huh? Boosted it myself.

888
00:53:15,95 --> 00:53:17,68
我自己斡的
Yeah, yeah, yeah. How'd you get it?

889
00:53:17,75 --> 00:53:19,81
是啊，你怎么到手的?

890
00:53:19,88 --> 00:53:21,15
钥匙就在里面
<i>- Actually, the keys were in it. - Oh, well, that kind of defies the point then, don't it?</i>

891
00:53:21,22 --> 00:53:23,48
造就难怪了

892
00:53:23,56 --> 00:53:25,05
你偷了一辆不在清单上的车
You stole a car that wasn't on the list.

893
00:53:26,42 --> 00:53:29,05
你偷了清单上没列名的车子
You stole a car that wasn't on the list!

894
00:53:29,16 --> 00:53:32,10
你乾脆穿上小丑服去警局
Why didn't you just go to the police station in a red clown suit...

895
00:53:32,16 --> 00:53:34,03
把我们的计划告诉条子吧
and let everybody know what we're doin' here?

896
00:53:34,10 --> 00:53:37,00
什么东西? 不知道
- What have we got? - I don't know.

897
00:53:38,57 --> 00:53:40,20
该死，各位
Shit! Fellas.

898
00:53:40,27 --> 00:53:41,10
拿给我看
<i>- What? - Gimme that. - Check this out.</i>

899
00:53:41,17 --> 00:53:43,64
我看看 拿给我看
- Check this out! - Let me see that. This looks like heroin.

900
00:53:45,51 --> 00:53:47,67
看来像是海洛因? 什么?
- Yeah. - What! - Exactly.

901
00:53:50,85 --> 00:53:53,54
你在哪偷到这辆车的? 中国城
- Where did you get this car? - I n front of some poker parlor in Chinatown.

902
00:53:53,62 --> 00:53:56,75
你想这辆车为何没拔车钥匙?
Did you ever consider why a car in a neighborhood like that...

903
00:53:54,84 --> 00:53:56,83
<i>- would have its keys left in it? - No.</i>

904
00:53:56,82 --> 00:54:00,66
也许没人会笨到偷这辆车
Maybe because nobody in that neighborhood would be stupid enough to rip this car off.

905
00:54:00,76 --> 00:54:03,16
开回去 不行
- All right. Get this shit outta here. Take it back. - No, no. We can't take it back.

906
00:54:03,16 --> 00:54:04,15
把它开走
- Get it outta here! - Will everybody relax for a second?

907
00:54:04,26 --> 00:54:05,19
大家别激勤
Take it back!

908
00:54:06,06 --> 00:54:07,53
把它开走…

909
00:54:07,60 --> 00:54:08,59
开回去

910
00:54:11,44 --> 00:54:13,20
把那玩意给我
I'm comin' after that shit. Gimme that.

911
00:54:12,39 --> 00:54:16,09
No!

912
00:54:15,27 --> 00:54:16,74
看你弄的
Man, I will knock the shit out of you.

913
00:54:16,81 --> 00:54:19,17
我要扁你一顿

914
00:54:19,24 --> 00:54:20,40
等等、等等
<i>- Wait, wait, wait. - Who is it?</i>

915
00:54:21,65 --> 00:54:22,94
是谁?
- Detective Castlebeck. - Oh. Christ.

916
00:54:23,01 --> 00:54:24,54
凯瑟警探

917
00:54:24,62 --> 00:54:26,41
好极了

918
00:54:39,86 --> 00:54:41,73
该死
Goddamn it.

919
00:54:41,35 --> 00:54:45,45
- Hey, hello, Otto. - Detective. Good to see you.

920
00:54:43,13 --> 00:54:45,97
你好，奥图警探，真是幸会

921
00:54:46,84 --> 00:54:49,64
很久不见了 是啊，你气色不错
<i>- Long time. - Yeah. You're lookin' good.</i>

922
00:54:48,89 --> 00:54:51,29
Thank you.

923
00:54:52,34 --> 00:54:54,47
这里在搞什么?
So Randall, what do we got here?

924
00:54:55,08 --> 00:54:58,38
跨世代窃车贼聚会，是吗?
We got a multigenerational gathering of players?

925
00:54:56,90 --> 00:54:58,53
<i>- Is that what we got here? - Right.</i>

926
00:54:59,45 --> 00:55:00,64
唐尼在那里

00:55:01,95 --> 00:55:03,11
你好啊，唐尼
- How you been, D? - I'm just happy to see you, brother.

928
00:55:03,19 --> 00:55:04,71
很高兴见到你
Yeah. I gotta tell you, Randall. Seeing you here, Otto, Donny,

929
00:55:05,72 --> 00:55:08,02
曼斐，我得说…

930
00:55:08,13 --> 00:55:10,06
看到你、奥图和唐尼
makes me feel almost nostalgic.

931
00:55:10,13 --> 00:55:12,39
让我几乎想起从前
Kind of like a big reunion.

932
00:55:12,46 --> 00:55:14,93
我们是在重聚

933
00:55:15,03 --> 00:55:20,34
别走 我们等会要烤甜点、唱歌呢
You should stick around, 'cause a little later we're gonna...

934
00:55:16,72 --> 00:55:19,48
make s'mores and sing "Kumbayah."

935
00:55:23,04 --> 00:55:24,10
这是什么?

936
00:55:24,18 --> 00:55:26,30
这个 这是凯迪拉克
Yeah.

937
00:55:28,95 --> 00:55:30,61
它怎么了?
- What's wrong with it, Otto? - Rest...

938
00:55:30,68 --> 00:55:32,71
它需要翻修   怎么了?
<i>- Needs restoration. - What?</i>

939
00:55:32,98 --> 00:55:34,28
烤漆
- Brightening. - Otto.

940
00:55:34,85 --> 00:55:37,75
奥图，你有辆39年的福特
- You got a '39 Ford right there. - That's a pretty car.

941
00:55:37,82 --> 00:55:39,76
那辆车很棒吧?
- Isn't that a nice car? - Yeah. Right here you got a '53 Fiat Vignale.

942
00:55:39,82 --> 00:55:42,79

943
00:55:42,86 --> 00:55:44,33
真美的车
<i>Now, these are beautiful cars, Otto. And here we got a '83 Cadillac Eldorado.</i>

944
00:55:44,43 --> 00:55:47,23

945
00:55:46,42 --> 00:55:48,98
- Yeah. - I mean, who the hell pays...

946
00:55:48,27 --> 00:55:49,82
谁会付钱…
to brighten up a Cadillac Eldorado?

947
00:55:50,84 --> 00:55:53,17
帮凯迪拉克重新烤漆?

948
00:55:53,24 --> 00:55:58,17
我想车主是对它有感情 没别的了
I think it holds a certain sentimental value, you know.

949
00:55:55,83 --> 00:55:58,42
<i>Nothing more.</i>

950
00:56:00,91 --> 00:56:03,04

你不相信我们改过向善了?
No faith in our newfound goodness, Detective? Huh?

955
00:56:22,70 --> 00:56:26,10
警察只相信证据，你知道的
Task force runs on statistics and numbers, Otto. You know that.

956
00:56:26,20 --> 00:56:28,33
曼斐，这是奇普?
<i>- Randall, this Kip? - That's my brother.</i>

957
00:56:28,41 --> 00:56:29,40
没错

See, I know what you're doin'. I know.

964
00:56:45,72 --> 00:56:47,09
你在想，无通报…
You're thinkin' there's no want, but that I stripped its guts...

965
00:56:47,16 --> 00:56:51,32
我就会把它解体出售
and crated her up, right?

966
00:56:51,53 --> 00:56:52,93
你真的都这么做?
Is that what you did, Randall?

967
00:56:53,00 --> 00:56:55,59
我没有，算了
No. I didn't do it. You know, you're trying to hurt my feelings? Fine.

968
00:56:55,70 --> 00:56:58,26

972
00:57:06,68 --> 00:57:10,55
我不知道 你现在可能比我还懂车呢
Oh, I don't know. You probably know more about cars at this point than I do.

973
00:57:10,62 --> 00:57:14,55
你连我都比不上了? 你只是知识比我强
- You slippin' on me, Randall? - No, it's just your knowledge overwhelms me.

978
00:57:29,93 --> 00:57:30,87
很好
- Yeah, that's it! - Go, go!

979
00:57:30,94 --> 00:57:32,20
再催、再催

980
00:57:34,37 --> 00:57:36,03
你真强
Baby, don't be so mean! Yeah, that's it!

981
00:57:39,61 --> 00:57:44,10
感受真好 弄坏了你可要赔
<i>- Oh, that was good. - Yeah, you break it, you buy it, my friend.</i>

All right.

985

好吧

986
00:57:53,83 --> 00:57:55,62
改天兄了
I'll catch you later.

987
00:58:12,24 --> 00:58:15,14
今晚行动 你怎么知道?
- It's on for tonight. - How do you know?

988
00:58:16,88 --> 00:58:20,28
他们定好今晚的联络代号了
They got the call signs on all the units working tonight.

989
00:58:22,09 --> 00:58:24,18
你想用这干嘛?
- Wh-What were you gonna do with this? - I was gonna bonk him.

990
00:58:24,26 --> 00:58:25,55
打昏他
Bonk? For the next 24 hours,

991
00:58:25,62 --> 00:58:27,11
打昏?

992
00:58:27,43 --> 00:58:31,89
接下来的二十四小时 你们无权做任何决定

'懂了吗?

'懂了 好
Obviously they're onto us. He's sniffin' real close.

995
00:58:34,53 --> 00:58:37,37
条子盯上了，他差点就查到了

996
00:58:37,94 --> 00:58:39,90
今晚要有任何不对劲
If anything tonight appears out of place,

997
00:58:39,97 --> 00:58:42,50
就停止行动、离开现场
I want you to cut bait, get out of there and walk away.

998
00:58:42,74 --> 00:58:44,87
把那辆车解决掉
And get rid of this goddamn car!

999
00:58:47,55 --> 00:58:48,41
什么事，奇普?
- What's up, Kip? - Bobby, what are you doin'?

1000
00:58:48,48 --> 00:58:50,38
你在干嘛?
You think you're comin' with us, but you're not.

1001
00:58:50,45 --> 00:58:52,47
你不能跟我们去

1002
00:58:52,55 --> 00:58:54,88
我也是一份子，我要去
What are you talkin' about, man? I'm part of the team. I get to go.

1003
00:58:54,95 --> 00:58:59,41
你会被捕或送命的，别蠢了
No, no, wake up. Gonna end up in the jail or the morgue or some shit. Don't be stupid.

1004
00:58:59,92 --> 00:59:01,72
那我该做什么?
What am I supposed to do?

1005
00:59:02,16 --> 00:59:04,29
需要橡胶手套吗?
Did you see a box of rubber gloves here, man?

1006
00:59:04,40 --> 00:59:07,69
不用，这是高科技时代，你看
Gloves? Man, you don't need gloves. This is the new age. Check this out.

1007
00:59:09,40 --> 00:59:10,26
这是什么?
- What is this? - Let me just see that big claw you call a hand.

1008
00:59:10,33 --> 00:59:12,73
把你的大熊掌仲过来

1009
00:59:14,27 --> 00:59:16,40
这不是果冻，别乱吃
That's not doughnut jelly, so don't eat it.

1010
00:59:16,47 --> 00:59:19,50
你的新指纹，猫王还魂了
Your new fingerprints. Elvis is back.

1011
00:59:18,73 --> 00:59:20,56
Hmm.

1012
00:59:20,63 --> 00:59:24,07
- Boy got skills, right? - Yeah, you do.

没错
Look like a little ghetto Smurf.

1015
00:59:26,02 --> 00:59:28,14
具像长了厚茧

1016
00:59:46,34 --> 00:59:50,93
我是坏胚子
I am a bad man.

1017
00:59:58,55 --> 01:00:00,02
谢了
Thanks. Thanks for doin' this.

1018

集中注意力，想清楚
Keep it real. Think slow.

1020
01:00:07,89 --> 01:00:09,69

把手电筒给我
Gimme that torch. Aha!

1028
01:01:10,49 --> 01:01:11,79
你看，看我的吧
I tell you, I'm the man. Now, where does this go?

1029
01:01:12,52 --> 01:01:16,62
得想辨法打开它
Find a way to get in here. Get this...

1030
01:01:18,33 --> 01:01:21,32
由我主导行动 你再这样我就-…
I tell you, I'm runnin' this shit! You do that again, I will kick...

1031
01:01:21,70 --> 01:01:24,17
没事，我不是针对你
Cool, man. You don't have to take it so damn personal.

1032
01:01:25,12 --> 01:01:27,85
Ah. Everything is perfect.

哈罗，小姐们
Hello, ladies. Always was a sucker for a redhead.

1035

Let's go. Come on, move, move! Go, go!

1036
01:01:46,96 --> 01:01:49,95
动手吧，快点

1037
01:01:53,00 --> 01:01:56,36
我知道你懂法拉利，动手吧
Work your magic, baby. I know you know Ferraris. Work your magic.

1038
01:01:56,43 --> 01:01:58,13
这女孩真有本事
<i>- Girl got skill.</i>

1039
01:02:23,53 --> 01:02:25,12
你还好吧?
You all right?

1040
01:02:28,77 --> 01:02:29,89
能成功吗?
- You think we're gonna make it? - I don't know. It's too early to tell.

1041
01:02:30,23 --> 01:02:32,17
现在还不知道

1042
01:02:56,96 --> 01:03:00,29
黛安、翠西、娜汀… 还有罗丝都上路了
<i>Diana, Tricia, Nadine and Rose are on their way.</i>

Son of a bitch.

1048
01:03:29,38 --> 01:03:30,36
混蛋
I know you're not parking right in front of me.

1049
01:03:31,78 --> 01:03:33,24
你不能把车停在我前面

1050
01:03:34,81 --> 01:03:37,21
我什么都看不到了
Oh, no. I can't see a damn thing.

1051
01:03:37,92 --> 01:03:39,82
好吧，我们得移一下
All right. We gotta move.

1052
01:03:55,40 --> 01:03:56,63
(距最后期限lO小时)
<i>You ever feel bad about any of this?</i>

1053
01:03:56,70 --> 01:03:59,33
你偷车会有罪恶感吗? 没有
Hell, no. I'm Robin Hood, man. I rob from the rich and give to the needy.

1054
01:03:59,41 --> 01:04:02,67
我是罗宾汉，我劫富济贫

1055
01:04:03,24 --> 01:04:04,44
该死
Damn. Donny!

钳子     钳子
Cutters.

1059
01:04:12,72 --> 01:04:14,59
No, like I said, the needy.

1060
01:04:14,35 --> 01:04:15,58
不，是需要的人

1061
01:04:18,46 --> 01:04:20,48
兄弟，我们需要这辆车
'Cause, brother, we need this car.

1062
01:04:28,10 --> 01:04:28,96
你好啊，朋友?
- What's up, Doc? - You're new, aren't ya?

1063
01:04:29,57 --> 01:04:32,13

- Yeah. How can you tell? - Now, listen, son. You take real good care of this car,

1064
01:04:32,20 --> 01:04:35,44
听着，顾好这辆车

1065
01:04:34,54 --> 01:04:37,45
and I'll take care of you.

1066
01:04:36,91 --> 01:04:38,31
我就会照顾你
Tell you what. Save it. You get another one of these suits, all right?

1067
01:04:38,38 --> 01:04:40,87
留着买套新西装吧

1068
01:04:40,98 --> 01:04:42,00
上帝保佑你
- God bless you, son. - You need a fashion counselor.

1069
01:04:42,11 --> 01:04:43,84
你需要造型顾问
All right, babe. I ain't here for the door. I here for the car. Get your big ass out.

1070
01:04:43,92 --> 01:04:47,25
我只负责泊车，不负责开门 大屁股快下车

1071
01:04:47,75 --> 01:04:49,74
下车，你看什么看?
- Hmm? - Out! What are you lookin' at?

1072
01:04:52,62 --> 01:04:54,92
妈的，真是易如反掌
- Hey, man, that was as easy as pie. - I'm a veteran, son.

1073
01:04:54,99 --> 01:04:56,09
我是老手
Get outta the car, bitch, or I'll blow your brains out!

1074
01:04:56,16 --> 01:04:58,19
下车，不然我开枪了
- You gotta be shittin' me. - I will shoot you, damn it!

1075
01:04:58,26 --> 01:04:59,36
别用玩笑了

1076
01:04:59,43 --> 01:05:00,99
我会开枪的
Damn!

1077
01:05:01,63 --> 01:05:02,46
该死
You lazy, half-ass bully! Any asshole can pull a gun on somebody!

1078
01:05:03,57 --> 01:05:06,20
懒惰无能的家伙

1079
01:05:06,27 --> 01:05:08,07
白痴也会用枪
You don't know the first thing about stealin' a car! Boy, I...

1080
01:05:08,17 --> 01:05:11,57
你根本不懂偷车，怎么?

1081
01:05:11,88 --> 01:05:13,74
去拜师吧
You need a role model!

快看
<i>Hey. Check this out.</i>

1088
01:06:33,43 --> 01:06:34,76
他回来了
J.J., he's back. But he's smart. He watches his ass.

1089
01:06:34,83 --> 01:06:36,92
他很聪明，也很小心
<i>Just hold our positions. If he rolls,</i>

1090
01:06:37,00 --> 01:06:38,46
别妄动

1091
01:06:38,53 --> 01:06:40,86
他一下手，你就跟上去

他在干嘛?
<i>What's he doin'? What... What are you doing?</i>

1094
01:06:52,58 --> 01:06:54,44
你在干嘛?

1095
01:07:02,49 --> 01:07:05,48
我们也许该摇下车窗跟他挥手
<i>We might as well roll down our windows and wave.</i>

1096
01:07:05,56 --> 01:07:07,82
小杰，你跟着他 知道了
<i>- J.J., you tail him. All right? - Copy that.</i>

1097
01:07:12,36 --> 01:07:14,06
我们走
Let's go.

1098
01:07:17,97 --> 01:07:19,73
祝好运
- Good luck. - Piece of cake.

1099
01:07:19,94 --> 01:07:21,77

他们一下手就逮捕
<i>If they roll, we take them down.</i>

1102
01:07:33,15 --> 01:07:37,18
昨晚那车停在四间房子之外 现在却只隔两间了
Last night that van was parked four houses down. Now it's only two.

1103
01:07:38,42 --> 01:07:40,19
我们有同伴了
- We got company. - Shit.

1104

该死
He's at the car.

1105
01:07:41,93 --> 01:07:43,09
他到车旁了

1106
01:07:45,28 --> 01:07:48,08
<i>Bird, come back.</i>

在赌场外，正要接老阎的女人

1111
01:07:58,38 --> 01:07:59,87
那女的有问题
- The ladies are dirty. Walk away. The ladies are dirty. - What?

1112
01:07:59,98 --> 01:08:02,57
快走，那女的有问题 什么?

1113
01:08:02,61 --> 01:08:05,28
大家快回车库
I want everybody to get back to the garage now.

1114
01:08:04,43 --> 01:08:07,37
Oh, so she's havin' a baby right now?

1115
01:08:05,95 --> 01:08:08,15
她要生了?
I guess I better get to the hospital then, huh?

1116
01:08:08,22 --> 01:08:10,38
我得快点赶到医院
Something's got him spooked.

1117
01:08:10,62 --> 01:08:12,18
有事情吓到他了
My wife is havin' a baby. Gotta get...

1118
01:08:12,26 --> 01:08:14,73
我老婆要生了

1119
01:08:14,79 --> 01:08:17,63
这不是我的车，我的车在那边
I'm nervous! This ain't even my car! Way over here...

1120
01:08:18,80 --> 01:08:20,86
他万开车子了
He's heading away from the vehicle.

1121
01:08:21,85 --> 01:08:24,11
I see you.

1122
01:08:24,04 --> 01:08:25,90

开进去里面
Pull in over there.

01:08:45,14 --> 01:08:49,04
- Hello. This is unit two. I lost them.

1125
01:08:47,13 --> 01:08:49,75
这是第二组，我跟丢了

1126
01:08:54,50 --> 01:08:57,33
该去找小费谈谈了
<i>All right, it's time to talk to Fuzzy again.</i>

1127
01:08:58,94 --> 01:09:00,03
你看
<i>Check this out. Laser-encoded keys that send a message to a receiver...</i>

1128
01:09:00,11 --> 01:09:04,30
雷射钥匙送出讯号

1129
01:09:01,62 --> 01:09:03,35
inside the car.

1130
01:09:04,34 --> 01:09:06,81
钥匙从哪来的?
You wanna tell me what you're doin' with these?

1131
01:09:06,91 --> 01:09:09,35
上周偷车时搭上的
Yeah. These are from last week. These are from the other boost.

1132
01:09:16,52 --> 01:09:18,01
是谁?
Who is it?

1133
01:09:19,81 --> 01:09:24,14
<i>- The keys, the keys, the keys! - Take it easy!</i>

1134
01:09:25,70 --> 01:09:26,86
怎么了?
<i>- Now gimme this! - What happened? What happened?</i>

1135
01:09:26,93 --> 01:09:29,13
这些钥匙哪来的? 怎么了?
<i>- Where'd you get these from? - What's the problem?</i>

1136
01:09:29,20 --> 01:09:31,93
那些宝士有人监视
The Mercedes are dirty! There's surveillance vans all over them.

1137
01:09:32,00 --> 01:09:33,16
钥匙哪来的?
- Where'd they come from? - Whoa. My guy in Southland. The same guy I used last time.

1138
01:09:33,24 --> 01:09:36,83
南部的朋友，我以前找过他

1139
01:09:34,99 --> 01:09:37,18
- Same guy I used before. - Before when?

1140
01:09:36,94 --> 01:09:37,91
什么以前?
- When we... When we took the other cars. - Other Mercedes.

1141
01:09:38,01 --> 01:09:41,07
我们偷其他车时 其他的宝士

1142
01:09:39,96 --> 01:09:43,26
- Christ. - Castlebeck.

1143
01:09:42,38 --> 01:09:44,11
是凯瑟
He got to one of the guys at the dealership, and he turned him. That's what happened.

1144
01:09:44,18 --> 01:09:47,52
他找到车商的人，逼他合作

1145
01:09:47,59 --> 01:09:50,08
只剩八小时了
Eight hours left.

1146
01:09:50,16 --> 01:09:53,78
我们要继续站在这里开会吗?
So what, we're gonna stand around and have a meeting? Wh-What's goin' on?

1147
01:09:53,93 --> 01:09:55,29
曼斐
Memphis, maybe it's time for us to start thinking about...

1148
01:09:56,09 --> 01:09:58,65
也许我们该把这些孩子送走
- how to get these young kids out of town, 'cause...

1149
01:09:58,73 --> 01:10:02,03
拜托，你知道…

1150
01:10:02,10 --> 01:10:06,30
没有宝士，偷其他车也没用
If there's no Mercedes, there's no point in boosting any other cars. You hear me?

1151
01:10:06,37 --> 01:10:07,67
完了
- That's it. - 47 is not 50, Memphis. You know that's what he'll say.

1152
01:10:07,74 --> 01:10:10,77
他会说四十七辆不等于五十辆

1153
01:10:09,46 --> 01:10:11,39
Yeah.

1154
01:10:12,24 --> 01:10:16,65
曼斐，我们还有上回偷到的宝士车钥匙
<i>Hey, Memphis. You know, we still have the Mercedes keys from the last boost.</i>

1155
01:10:16,72 --> 01:10:20,71
那些车被警方扣留了
Hey! Those cars are at the police impound.

1156
01:10:21,12 --> 01:10:24,09
你要我们去那里偷车吗?
Okay? The police impound. You want us to go there and start stealin' cars?

1157
01:10:24,52 --> 01:10:26,12
没错
<i>- Yeah. - Yeah, let's do it. - You're crazy.</i>

1158
01:10:26,19 --> 01:10:27,25
你疯了?
- We're gonna get hectic. Let's go. - No, Memphis, no. Don't do this.

1159
01:10:27,33 --> 01:10:30,69
振作起来，那些钥匙呢? 不行

1160
01:10:31,76 --> 01:10:33,86
我看起来不可疑吧?
Hey, Sphinx, I don't look suspicious, do I, man?

1161
01:10:34,50 --> 01:10:37,33
奥图，你的狗把钥匙吃了
<i>Otto, man, I think that your dog ate the keys.</i>

1162
01:10:37,94 --> 01:10:41,34
它通常都吃车牌的，你确定?
He usually goes for the license plates.

1163
01:10:39,89 --> 01:10:44,12
- Are you sure? - What? Wait a minute. The dog ate the keys?

1164
01:10:42,64 --> 01:10:45,70
等等，狗吃了钥匙? 是啊

1165
01:10:44,19 --> 01:10:47,92
- Yes. How you gonna get them out?

1166
01:10:47,08 --> 01:10:50,74
要怎么才弄得出钥匙? 这不好笑
- Not funny. - I'm...

1167
01:10:50,82 --> 01:10:53,22
想都别想
- Hey, hey, don't even think about it, Sphinx.

1168
01:10:53,29 --> 01:10:54,72
没关系
It's all right.

1169
01:10:54,74 --> 01:10:58,14
Say, uh, Toby,

1170
01:10:56,56 --> 01:11:00,65
托比，设法去弄点…

1171
01:10:58,21 --> 01:11:02,51
go see if you can get some, uh, Alpo, and get some Ex-lax.

1172
01:11:00,73 --> 01:11:03,46
狗罐头跟泻药

1173
01:11:03,46 --> 01:11:04,62
不会吧
- No way, man. - Bad dog!

1174
01:11:04,70 --> 01:11:05,96
坏狗狗
<i>- Let's get back to work.</i>

1175
01:11:06,60 --> 01:11:08,53
工作吧

1176
01:11:22,50 --> 01:11:25,69
Hey! Open the door.

1177
01:11:24,78 --> 01:11:26,44
开门
<i>- Ah, Jesus. - Hurry up. Hurry up.</i>

1178
01:11:26,52 --> 01:11:28,08
快点

1179
01:11:28,15 --> 01:11:31,02
别闹了，摇滚巨星 天啊
- End it, rock star. Get in. - Jesus Christ.

1180
01:11:31,99 --> 01:11:33,92
怎么，你们还要什么?
Now what, man? What else?

1181
01:11:35,89 --> 01:11:39,19
小费，你都没给我报讯 现在我们得留在这…
Fuzzy, you never called me. So now we gotta stay down here...

1182
01:11:39,26 --> 01:11:41,39
除非你说出你所知道的一切
till you tell me everything you know.

1183
01:11:41,47 --> 01:11:43,40
我都说了
I... I told you everything I know. I know that,

1184
01:11:43,47 --> 01:11:45,94
我说过我只知道这些的
because I said, "This is everything I know."

1185
01:11:46,00 --> 01:11:47,16
戴警探
Detective Drycoff, does it seem like the suspect is violating his parole right now?

1186
01:11:47,24 --> 01:11:50,23
你想嫌犯是否违反假释?

1187
01:11:50,51 --> 01:11:51,81
当然，凯瑟警探
<i>Why, yes, Detective Castlebeck, if by violating his parole...</i>

1188
01:11:51,91 --> 01:11:56,24
他拒绝跟执法人员合作
you mean failing to cooperate with a law enforcement officer.

1189
01:12:02,35 --> 01:12:05,05
我在偷车贼退休之家学的
A little trick I learned in the car thief retirement home.

1190
01:12:06,16 --> 01:12:07,46
帮我拿着好吗?
Can you hold this?

1191
01:12:07,83 --> 01:12:11,09
我没有拒绝合作，我只是…
No, no, no. I'm not failing to cooperate. It's just that...

1192
01:12:11,63 --> 01:12:13,29
好吧、好吧
Y-Y-Yeah. Okay. Okay. Uh, word has it...

1193
01:12:13,37 --> 01:12:17,39
传说雷奇普接下买卖部搞砸了
that Kip Raines took the job and he screwed up. Uh, he screwed up pretty bad.

1194
01:12:17,47 --> 01:12:19,10
糟糕透了
And who put out the order for the job?

1195
01:12:19,57 --> 01:12:21,40
谁的买卖?

1196
01:12:24,54 --> 01:12:26,20
卡雷蒙
It's Raymond Calitri's order.

1197
01:12:25,36 --> 01:12:27,55
<i>Nice.</i>

1198
01:12:27,05 --> 01:12:28,48
干的好

1199
01:12:34,85 --> 01:12:36,72
快、快啊
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on.</i>

1200
01:12:35,87 --> 01:12:39,67
Yes.

1201
01:12:39,09 --> 01:12:40,58
好耶

1202
01:12:43,86 --> 01:12:46,59
还剩六小时 那只狗拉了没?
<i>We have six hours left. Has the dog done its business yet?</i>

1203
01:12:46,67 --> 01:12:48,72
托比和小佛去它了
Toby and Freb are walking him right now.

1204
01:12:47,88 --> 01:12:51,55
- He's not gonna go it. It's not gonna happen, man.

1205
01:12:49,47 --> 01:12:52,30
它不会拉的，钥匙拿不到了

1206
01:12:52,44 --> 01:12:53,90
快啊，狗狗
Come on, dog. What's wrong, Hemi? Poop, dog.

1207
01:12:53,97 --> 01:12:57,14
怎么了，快拉啊?

1208
01:12:59,78 --> 01:13:01,51
这一定是女人的车
- It had to be a girl car. - Girl car, what kind of a girl drives a Hemi 'Cuda?

1209
01:13:01,51 --> 01:13:04,48
女人的车? 女人怎会开这种车

1210
01:13:05,02 --> 01:13:06,98
我证明给你看
I'll show you.

1211
01:13:07,95 --> 01:13:09,01
唇膏?
Lipstick?

1212
01:13:10,02 --> 01:13:11,75
颜色跟车子很配
Matches the car.

1213
01:13:14,06 --> 01:13:16,46
接下来呢，腮红、睫毛膏?
<i>- What's next? Blush? Mascara? - Next time...</i>

1214
01:13:16,53 --> 01:13:22,59
下回，我要穿皮衣、高跟鞋 还有粉红色内衣
I'll pull out the, uh, leather and high heels and pink underwear for you.

1215
01:13:22,67 --> 01:13:25,50
皮衣、高跟鞋和粉红色内衣
- Leather, high heels and pink underwear. - Pink underwear.

1216
01:13:25,57 --> 01:13:28,13
我喜欢粉红色内衣，我喜欢
- Pink underwear works. Pink underwear works.

1217
01:13:31,04 --> 01:13:35,98
卡雷蒙因杀人在南伦敦服过刑
<i>Raymond Vincent Calitri did five years in South London for manslaughter.</i>

1218
01:13:36,05 --> 01:13:37,51
98年移民
- He immigrated in '98. - Look at this.

1219
01:13:37,58 --> 01:13:41,25
你看… 放高利贷、勒索、收售贼物
Loan shark and extortion, fencing. Ha. His front's a salvage yard.

1220
01:13:41,52 --> 01:13:43,65
他真是前科累累

1221
01:14:01,41 --> 01:14:03,27
得等他们上床才行
Gonna have to wait it out.

1222
01:14:05,43 --> 01:14:09,49
So, you seeing anybody?

1223
01:14:07,21 --> 01:14:10,41
你有对象吗?

1224
01:14:10,48 --> 01:14:11,57
没有
No. No, I had a girl once.

1225
01:14:11,75 --> 01:14:14,22
我以前有个女友

1226
01:14:14,49 --> 01:14:15,75
她很棒
- She was great. - Mmm. So if she was so great, why'd you leave her?

1227
01:14:16,49 --> 01:14:20,02
她要是那么棒，为何万开她?

1228
01:14:40,58 --> 01:14:42,77
我有要你跟我一起走
I did ask you to come with me.

1229
01:14:44,38 --> 01:14:46,91
不，你是要我变成另一个人
No, you asked me to be a different person.

1230
01:14:48,49 --> 01:14:51,68
我不想看到有人受伤
I didn't want to see people get hurt. I just wanted you to slow down.

1231
01:14:51,76 --> 01:14:53,55
我只是要你放慢脚步
Well, I couldn't.

1232
01:14:53,63 --> 01:14:58,09
我没办法，我还没准备好

1233
01:14:55,24 --> 01:14:57,18
'Cause I wasn't ready.

1234
01:14:59,20 --> 01:15:00,63
你现在很循规蹈矩了
- You're straight now. - Yeah, I am.

1235
01:15:00,70 --> 01:15:03,86
因为没有你，一切都变了
'Cause it wasn't the same without you.

1236
01:15:09,77 --> 01:15:11,24
抱歉
- Excuse me, gentlemen. - Hey, asshole. I was reading that.

1237
01:15:11,31 --> 01:15:13,00
我还在看，混蛋
- Watch your mouth, kid. - What's goin' on?

1238
01:15:13,11 --> 01:15:14,64
说话小心点
<i>- This is a homicide file from a homicide investigation. - All right.</i>

1239
01:15:14,75 --> 01:15:17,37
这是一庄凶杀案的档案

1240
01:15:17,45 --> 01:15:20,42
等了三个月法官才授权监听
It took us three months to get a magistrate to give us a wiretap on 'em.

1241
01:15:20,85 --> 01:15:23,12
没有任何部门，包话肃窃局
<i>No other division, including GRAB, can go near his person, residence or place of business.</i>

1242
01:15:23,19 --> 01:15:25,68
可以接近他、他家或他公司

1243
01:15:25,76 --> 01:15:28,39
懂了吧，我告诉你们吧…
All right? Got it? Let me tell you guys something.

1244
01:15:27,54 --> 01:15:32,31
All right. Raymond Calitri is going down for murder one. Boneheads.

1245
01:15:29,23 --> 01:15:32,20
卡雷蒙会以一级谋杀罪起拆

1246
01:15:32,26 --> 01:15:37,06
谁鸟什么窃车案啊?
Who gives a shit about grand theft auto? Really.

1247
01:15:38,84 --> 01:15:40,60
我看不下去了
<i>I can't watch this.</i>

1248
01:15:40,67 --> 01:15:43,77
快点，快上啊
Come on, come on, come on. Get it on. Get it over with.

1249
01:15:49,45 --> 01:15:53,75
你觉得哪一样比较刺激… 做爱还是偷车?
What do you think is more exciting, having sex, or stealing cars?

1250
01:15:53,82 --> 01:15:55,91
做爱还是偷车?
Having sex or boosting cars?

1251
01:15:55,07 --> 01:15:57,50
<i>Um. Ooh!</i>

1252
01:15:57,57 --> 01:15:59,51
Uh.

1253
01:16:03,01 --> 01:16:06,17
<i>Well, uh, how about, uh...</i>

1254
01:16:05,80 --> 01:16:10,89
一边偷车… 一边做爱如何?
<i>having sex while boosting cars?</i>

1255
01:16:10,97 --> 01:16:13,13
说的好
God, that's a good line.

1256
01:16:12,29 --> 01:16:16,85
<i>Oh, doesn't work on a lot of girls, though.</i>

1257
01:16:15,21 --> 01:16:16,67
但对很多女人都没用

1258
01:16:16,78 --> 01:16:19,77
我只是随口说说…
I just blurted it out. I'm s...

1259
01:16:21,98 --> 01:16:24,21
但你还没回答
But you haven't answered the question.

1260
01:16:23,93 --> 01:16:27,03
Well, you see, the problem is,

1261
01:16:25,58 --> 01:16:27,95
问题是…

1262
01:16:27,10 --> 01:16:29,19
how do you get over the shifter?

1263
01:16:28,92 --> 01:16:31,32
排档杆卡在中间
- Oh. Oh, right. 'Cause the, uh... - Because it gets in the way.

1264
01:16:31,39 --> 01:16:33,79
是啊，它… 刚好挡住

1265
01:16:33,86 --> 01:16:37,59
你不会想弄坏同步装置吧?
Because you wouldn't want to disrupt the, uh, synchromesh. Right?

1266
01:16:40,53 --> 01:16:42,76
或进气阀门…
Or the throttle linkage.

1267
01:16:48,24 --> 01:16:51,00
主汽缸万合器…
The clutch master cylinder.

1268
01:16:54,29 --> 01:16:56,39
Double overhead cam shaft.

1269
01:16:56,11 --> 01:16:57,58
双凸轮轴
- I can't do this. - Wait, wait. Just straight in-line six,

1270
01:16:57,68 --> 01:16:58,61
我没办法

1271
01:16:58,72 --> 01:17:00,48
等等、等等

1272
01:17:00,72 --> 01:17:04,82
用同轴引擎、韦伯化油器
triple Weber carburetors...

1273
01:17:04,82 --> 01:17:08,19
连结到彼此的身上
<i>Bolted to each other's body structures.</i>

1274
01:17:11,36 --> 01:17:13,06
该动手了
Oh, it's time to work.

1275
01:17:13,13 --> 01:17:14,50
刹车踩的好
Good brakes. Good brakes too.

1276
01:17:15,93 --> 01:17:17,40
刹车踩的好

1277
01:17:31,35 --> 01:17:33,15
没有动静
- There's nothin' happening. - Maybe he's got indigestion.

1278
01:17:33,22 --> 01:17:34,98
也许它消化不良
- Well, dude, we'll give him some more Ex-lax. - He already ate two.

1279
01:17:35,05 --> 01:17:38,18
再多喂它一点泻药 它已经吃两颗了

1280
01:17:38,26 --> 01:17:39,35
小鬼
<i>- Hey, little man. - Oh, man.</i>

1281
01:17:39,42 --> 01:17:40,41
糟糕
I thought I told you this is our turf. What, you wanna make a move?

1282
01:17:42,19 --> 01:17:44,39
我说过这是我们的地盘了

1283
01:17:44,46 --> 01:17:45,93
你想开战吗?
We don't want anything to do with your turf.

1284
01:17:46,00 --> 01:17:47,90
我们不要你的地盘
<i>Something wrong with where we live?</i>

1285
01:17:47,97 --> 01:17:49,90
不喜欢我们住的地方吗?
Oh, no, it's cool for you. I mean, it's just not for us.

1286
01:17:49,97 --> 01:17:52,99
你们住很好，但不适合我们

1287
01:17:53,07 --> 01:17:55,30
你自以为比我们优秀吗?
Oh, so now you think you're better than us or something, huh?

1288
01:17:55,41 --> 01:17:57,07
也许我们该砍死你
<i>- Maybe we should cut you up, doll? - Um...</i>

1289
01:17:58,64 --> 01:18:00,67
兄弟，钥匙
- Dude, the keys. Freb. - Excuse me a second, guys.

1290
01:18:00,78 --> 01:18:02,71
恕我失陪

1291
01:18:03,68 --> 01:18:06,55
天啊
<i>Man!</i>

1292
01:18:06,78 --> 01:18:08,75
我要吐了
- Aw, I'm gonna throw up, dog! - Man, that's disgusting.

1293
01:18:08,82 --> 01:18:09,95
真恶心
What kind of pervert gets their jollies off playing with dog shit?

1294
01:18:10,02 --> 01:18:13,25
只有变态会玩狗大便

1295
01:18:13,32 --> 01:18:15,88
快看，三支都找到了
Look, man! I got 'em. All three, man.

1296
01:18:15,96 --> 01:18:17,39
你们真是有病
- You guys are sick. - I got 'em!

1297
01:18:17,46 --> 01:18:18,55
我找到了

1298
01:18:18,63 --> 01:18:22,96
(距最后期限6小时)

1299
01:18:23,03 --> 01:18:27,73
(洛城警局车辆保管场)

1300
01:18:31,38 --> 01:18:33,74
醒醒，看一下这个
Wake up, man. Check this out.

1301
01:18:33,81 --> 01:18:36,18
我每回开富豪车去比佛利山
Every time I drive my Volvo in Beverly Hills, they tow the shit.

1302
01:18:36,25 --> 01:18:37,24
就会被拖吊

1303
01:18:46,82 --> 01:18:48,66
我们这里没富豪车
- We ain't got any Volvos here. - There is a Volvo here. I know.

1304
01:18:48,73 --> 01:18:50,82
你们有，条子说的
- They told me... - Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

1305
01:18:50,90 --> 01:18:55,20
等等 我告诉你，这里没有富豪车
What I'm tryin' to tell you is, there ain't no Volvos here.

1306
01:19:01,51 --> 01:19:04,34
查一下，找找我的富豪车
Then get in your book, do something. Find my damn Volvo!

1307
01:19:04,44 --> 01:19:07,17
史芬克、莎薇
Sphinx. Sway.

1308
01:19:07,38 --> 01:19:09,74
一定登记在里面，查一下
It's got to be somewhere in there. Check it out, man.

1309
01:19:11,35 --> 01:19:13,61
这里什么都没有，你看
Wait, wait. There's nothing here. Look.

1310
01:19:14,09 --> 01:19:15,21
还有一个保管场…
- There's another one... - No, no! Uh-uh, hey! Tell you what, look at this.

1311
01:19:15,29 --> 01:19:17,91
你看这个

1312
01:19:17,99 --> 01:19:20,36
看着她…她法力条边…
Look at her.

1313
01:19:32,17 --> 01:19:34,37
抱歉，我不该在这里的
<i>Look, I'm sorry. I don't even need to be out here.</i>

1314
01:19:34,44 --> 01:19:37,47
有人找我
Hey, uh... I got a midget pagin' me right now.

1315
01:19:37,58 --> 01:19:39,54
我得走了，时间就是金钱
- Wait... - I gotta get outta here. Hey, time is money.

1316
01:19:38,89 --> 01:19:43,02
This is the worst damn day of my life.

1317
01:19:41,28 --> 01:19:44,04
这是我这辈子最糟的一天

1318
01:19:48,62 --> 01:19:55,08
凯瑟警探，仓库里的… 玻璃碎片是紫外线灯泡碎片
"Detective Castlebeck. Glass shards...

1319
01:19:50,70 --> 01:19:54,27
"from the warehouse from a black light bulb...

1320
01:19:55,16 --> 01:19:57,75
五金行都有卖
available at any local hardware store."

1321
01:19:59,15 --> 01:20:01,24
<i>All right.</i>

1322
01:20:02,20 --> 01:20:05,80
干嘛在长堤仓库…
What the hell is a black light bulb doin' in a...

1323
01:20:06,27 --> 01:20:08,26
用紫外线灯泡?
warehouse in Long Beach?

1324
01:20:13,04 --> 01:20:15,01
跟我来
Come with me.

1325
01:20:22,02 --> 01:20:23,25
看到吗?
- See this glass right here? - Let me guess.

1326
01:20:23,32 --> 01:20:25,62
我猜猜看，紫外线?
- Black light? - Black light.

1327
01:20:26,02 --> 01:20:29,93
紫外线 检查那面墙，我检查这面
Take that wall. I'll take this wall.

1328
01:20:30,73 --> 01:20:31,92
记得70年代吧?
<i>- Remember the seventies? - Too young, thank God.</i>

1329
01:20:32,40 --> 01:20:34,39
我还很小，感谢上帝

1330
01:20:34,47 --> 01:20:37,23
那时紫外线灯管很流行
Black lights were all the rage back then.

1331
01:20:37,30 --> 01:20:40,17
还有紫外线墨水、魔术笔
You know, they had this ink, these magic markers.

1332
01:20:40,91 --> 01:20:42,96
要在紫外线照射下才看的到
Only show up under black light.

1333
01:20:43,14 --> 01:20:47,94
你若有资讯不想让人知道
So if you got a whole lot of information that you don't want anybody to have...

1334
01:20:48,01 --> 01:20:51,04
像是偷车清单… 没错
- Like a shopping list of cars? - There you go. Whoa!

1335
01:20:53,52 --> 01:20:55,78
好耶、好耶
Yes. Yes!

1336
01:20:56,25 --> 01:20:57,81
清单在这里
Here is our list.

1337
01:20:58,32 --> 01:21:02,35
数量很大 我们条法完全掌握
That's a big list. We can't handle all these cars.

1338
01:21:02,76 --> 01:21:05,32
也并不需要，我们只要…
Maybe we don't have to. I'd say where let's concentrate on the rarest ones,

1339
01:21:05,40 --> 01:21:08,33
注意稀有的车款
and let's just hope for some luck.

1340
01:21:08,50 --> 01:21:10,63
找人监视这几辆
Let's get somebody on this right here. You and I will take this one right her.

1341
01:21:10,70 --> 01:21:14,07
我们盯这辆：67年的野马
'67 Shelby Mustang.

1342
01:21:14,14 --> 01:21:16,33
城里应该很少有
- Can't be but a few of these in town. - Yeah.

1343
01:21:16,44 --> 01:21:18,64
你怎么知道他还没偷走它?
But how do you know he hasn't already stolen it?

1344
01:21:18,74 --> 01:21:22,08
我了解他，他会把它留到最后
Oh, if I know our boy, I believe he'll leave this one till last.

1345
01:21:22,15 --> 01:21:24,74
为什么?他怕它
- Why? - He's afraid of it.

1346
01:21:27,12 --> 01:21:30,65
(距最后期限三小时)

1347
01:21:36,63 --> 01:21:37,99
各位
<i>Yo, guys. It's me.</i>

1348
01:21:40,57 --> 01:21:42,56
天啊，你在干嘛?
- Oh, man. What are you doing? - I want to come along with you guys on a boost.

1349
01:21:42,63 --> 01:21:44,36
我要参与行动
Come on. Let's go. Later. Come on.

1350
01:21:44,44 --> 01:21:45,96
待会再说，走吧

1351
01:22:01,69 --> 01:22:03,18
快、快、快
Go, go, go.

1352
01:22:13,08 --> 01:22:16,88
What's the matter with you? Come on!

1353
01:22:16,63 --> 01:22:17,79
你是怎么回事?
<i>Hey, call security! Someone's stealing the car!</i>

1354
01:22:17,87 --> 01:22:20,34
通知保安，有人偷车

1355
01:22:20,41 --> 01:22:23,10
快走，你在干嘛?
- Go, go, go! - What are you doing?

1356
01:22:21,76 --> 01:22:25,32
Whoa. I ought to leave your ass. You know that? What's the matter with you?

1357
01:22:23,57 --> 01:22:26,20
我本想丢下你不管的 你是怎么回事?

1358
01:22:38,46 --> 01:22:42,26
你看，牌照上写着"大蛇
Hey, Sphinx. Check this out. Home boy got "Snake" on the license plate.

1359
01:22:42,53 --> 01:22:45,99
大蛇主明天得搭公车了
<i>Well, Snake will have to slither his ass all the way to the bus stop in the morning.</i>

1360
01:22:48,42 --> 01:22:52,88
Police officers. We need to check the lot for a car.

1361
01:22:50,44 --> 01:22:53,46
警察，我们要查看一辆车

1362
01:22:53,54 --> 01:22:54,94
去吧
Go ahead.

1363
01:23:02,08 --> 01:23:04,55
来点开车音乐吧
Check this out, man. Here's some low-ridin' music.

1364
01:23:04,62 --> 01:23:08,02
跟你之前放的蠢歌不太一样
It's a little bit different than that cracker shit you used to be playin'. Check this out.

1365
01:23:12,06 --> 01:23:13,55
你喜欢的
You like that. You feelin' it? Are you feelin' it?

1366
01:23:14,49 --> 01:23:17,12
喜欢吗?我就知道你会喜欢
I know you're feelin' it.

1367
01:23:19,96 --> 01:23:22,76
蛇，快弄走它
Oh! Snake! Get this thing off me!

1368
01:23:22,83 --> 01:23:25,06
蛇…
Snake! Snake! Snake!

1369
01:23:33,21 --> 01:23:34,58
快把它弄走
Get this thing off me, man! It's a snake!

1370
01:23:35,01 --> 01:23:36,27
有蛇
It's tryin' to kill me, man! Get this thing off me!

1371
01:23:36,35 --> 01:23:38,61
它想害死我，快弄走它

1372
01:23:40,05 --> 01:23:42,18
它们最喜欢害黑人兄弟了
<i>Somebody always want to kill a brother. Man, this is wrong.</i>

1373
01:23:42,25 --> 01:23:44,48
你在干嘛，把蛇弄走
What the hell are you doing? Get the snake!

1374
01:23:47,12 --> 01:23:48,56
踩刹车 我有踩啊
- Use the brakes! - I am!

1375
01:23:50,68 --> 01:23:54,31
<i>This snake is crawlin' up my ass, man!</i>

1376
01:23:53,03 --> 01:23:55,23
这条蛇爬上我的屁眼了
This snake is up my ass!

1377
01:23:55,30 --> 01:23:56,73
它爬上来了

1378
01:23:58,54 --> 01:24:00,40
它会吃掉我的大便
This snake gonna swallow my shit!

1379
01:24:19,62 --> 01:24:24,58
(距最后期限2小时)

1380
01:24:29,20 --> 01:24:31,23
老天，我真爱那辆车
God, I love that car. All right. Two ladies, home safe.

1381
01:24:31,30 --> 01:24:33,43
两位小姐平安到家了
<i>He's tucking in Vanessa, and Bernadine just took me for a ride.</i>

1382
01:24:33,50 --> 01:24:34,94
他送雯妮莎上床

1383
01:24:35,01 --> 01:24:38,00
蓓娜汀则和我有了一腿

1384
01:24:38,23 --> 01:24:40,16
What's the count?

1385
01:24:40,08 --> 01:24:41,04
多少了?
- Forty-eight. - Yes!

1386
01:24:41,25 --> 01:24:42,21
四十八辆

1387
01:24:42,31 --> 01:24:43,44
好耶
But Mirror and Sphinx had some unexpected visitors.

1388
01:24:43,55 --> 01:24:46,21
藏镜人和史芬克遇到不速之客

1389
01:24:46,48 --> 01:24:48,71
是凯瑟? 我想是吧
- Castlebeck? - I think so.

1390
01:24:48,79 --> 01:24:50,91
一切都还好吧? 很好
- Everything cool? - Yeah, yeah, they're fine.

1391
01:24:50,99 --> 01:24:53,98
他们跟唐尼和小佛在奥图那里
They're on their way back to Otto's. Donny and Freb are already there.

1392
01:24:54,06 --> 01:24:55,18
奇普和小飞呢?
- What about Kip and Tumbler? - No word yet.

1393
01:24:55,63 --> 01:24:57,39
还没有消息
<i>Lost in suburbia. Hell, where are we?</i>

1394
01:24:58,43 --> 01:25:00,52
在鬼郊区迷路，我们在哪?
- What do you mean? You don't know where you're going? - Which way is out?

1395
01:25:00,77 --> 01:25:01,93
你迷路了?
I don't know where I am. Everything looks the same to me.

1396
01:25:01,93 --> 01:25:04,42
怎么出去? 附近全都长的一样

1397
01:25:04,50 --> 01:25:06,49
你不知道我们在哪?
You don't know where you're going?

1398
01:25:06,57 --> 01:25:08,51
是条子 不，是保安
<i>- That is a cop. - No, it's not. That's rent-a-cop.</i>

1399
01:25:10,54 --> 01:25:12,84
慢一点 他要回转了
- Slow down. Slow down. - He's pulling a U-turn.

1400
01:25:15,65 --> 01:25:17,38
天啊，我们有麻烦了
Oh, man, we're in big trouble.

1401
01:25:17,45 --> 01:25:19,35
被窃的凯迪拉克休旅车…
<i>In pursuit of stolen Cadillac S.U.V.,</i>

1402
01:25:19,42 --> 01:25:21,82
在莫瑞街上往西行驶
<i>traveling west on Murray Drive.</i>

1403
01:25:23,02 --> 01:25:24,58
路障 小心
- Roadblock, Kip. Oh, shit. - Look out for the roadblock! - Go, go!

1404
01:25:24,66 --> 01:25:25,38
枪

1405
01:25:32,80 --> 01:25:34,16
快走
Go!

1406
01:25:37,25 --> 01:25:40,22
- Oh, man. - Motherfucker.

1407
01:25:38,84 --> 01:25:40,36
天啊
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. - I need help, man.

1408
01:25:41,17 --> 01:25:42,80
该死、真该死
<i>- What? - He's been shot! Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</i>

1409
01:25:43,51 --> 01:25:45,57
怎么回事?

1410
01:25:45,68 --> 01:25:47,34
他中枪了

1411
01:25:47,45 --> 01:25:48,74
别碰
- Don't touch me! - We need to go to the hospital, man!

1412
01:25:48,81 --> 01:25:50,41
快去医院
People ask questions in hospitals, Kip.

1413
01:25:50,51 --> 01:25:53,45
医院会盘问我们的 快去
<i>- Go to the hospital! - You should use your head. We're in a stolen car!</i>

1414
01:25:53,52 --> 01:25:55,38
想清楚，我们开着贼车

1415
01:25:57,04 --> 01:25:59,30
Now, this does not look good.

1416
01:25:58,92 --> 01:26:00,22
情况不妙
You're gonna be all right.

1417
01:26:00,29 --> 01:26:01,85
不会有事的

1418
01:26:04,81 --> 01:26:06,61
- Oh, man! - What happened?

1419
01:26:06,70 --> 01:26:09,56
怎么回事? 我们碰到保安人员
- We ran into security patrol. - He hid in the van. We didn't know he was there.

1420
01:26:09,63 --> 01:26:11,30
他躲在车里
We gotta get you to a doctor, private. I know just where to go.

1421
01:26:11,37 --> 01:26:15,20
我们会帮你找私人医生 把他扶进我车里

1422
01:26:12,95 --> 01:26:16,45
- Let's get him to a car. - No! Ow!

1423
01:26:18,41 --> 01:26:19,93
躺在后座
Lie in the back. Lie down in the back.

1424
01:26:20,11 --> 01:26:21,58
到后座躺下
Tumbler, you and Kip take the last van back to Otto's.

1425
01:26:22,21 --> 01:26:25,15
小飞，你和奇普把车开给奥图

1426
01:26:24,10 --> 01:26:26,36
<i>- You all right? - Yeah, go.</i>

1427
01:26:29,15 --> 01:26:30,42
你干嘛?
- What are you doin'? - I'm goin' with him.

1428
01:26:31,42 --> 01:26:32,41
我要跟他一起去

1429
01:26:37,29 --> 01:26:39,23
要是出事… 走吧
<i>- If something should go wrong, just... - Let's go!</i>

1430
01:26:39,30 --> 01:26:41,99
我会照料他的
I'll take care of him, man.

1431
01:26:45,87 --> 01:26:47,77
做个了结吧
Let's finish this.

1432
01:26:51,84 --> 01:26:55,18

(距最后期限l小时)

1435
01:27:03,55 --> 01:27:04,54
怎么了?
- What's up? - What's the story with that Humvee?

1436
01:27:04,62 --> 01:27:06,89
悍马车怎样了 没了
- Gone. - Cadillac?

1437
01:27:07,32 --> 01:27:09,85
凯迪拉克? 一样，我们要去哪?
The same. Where are we goin'?

1438
01:27:09,93 --> 01:27:12,12
这附近唯一一辆67年野马
The only '67 Shelby in the area is registered...

1439
01:27:12,20 --> 01:27:14,96
在长堤国际名郊
at a place called the International Towers in Long Beach.

1440
01:27:15,03 --> 01:27:16,83
我们去长堤吧
Let's go to Long Beach.

1441
01:27:51,27 --> 01:27:53,20
我知道我们有段过去，伊琳诺
I know we got a history, Eleanor,

1442
01:27:52,35 --> 01:27:57,02
and that that history has not been great, but I promise...

1443
01:27:54,07 --> 01:27:57,91
那段过去并不好，但我保证…

1444
01:27:58,78 --> 01:28:01,30
你照料我，我也会照料你
you take care of me, I'll take care of you.

1445
01:28:23,57 --> 01:28:24,90
该死
Shit.

1446
01:28:29,67 --> 01:28:32,11
简单还是难走的路
The easy way or the hard way, Raines. Easy way or the hard way?

1447
01:28:41,33 --> 01:28:45,46
- Hey! - I think he's choosin' the hard way.

1448
01:28:44,76 --> 01:28:46,38
我想他选难走的那条路
All right.

1449
01:28:48,29 --> 01:28:49,52
好吧

1450
01:29:01,91 --> 01:29:06,04
这是lBll 追踪67年灰色野马
One-Baker-eleven. I n pursuit of '67 Ford Mustang, gray.

1451
01:29:12,12 --> 01:29:15,21
"请勿进入"耶 你注意到了?
- That sign said "Do Not Enter." - Yeah. You noticed, huh?

1452
01:29:15,29 --> 01:29:16,81
天啊 坐稳了
- Jesus! - Keep your pants on.

1453
01:29:20,26 --> 01:29:23,35
嫌犯在第四街向东前进
Suspect now traveling east on Fourth Street.

1454
01:29:29,97 --> 01:29:32,13
更正，缅因街向北前进
<i>Correction. Make that north on Main.</i>

1455
01:29:48,09 --> 01:29:49,18
走开 退后
Move! Get the fuck... Just move!

1456
01:29:49,29 --> 01:29:50,28
走开啊

1457
01:30:02,33 --> 01:30:03,60
别挡路
Get out of there!

1458
01:30:08,24 --> 01:30:10,61
你想让我发狂?
Oh, you wanna get crazy with me!

1459
01:30:10,82 --> 01:30:13,32
Come on, boy.

1460
01:30:12,98 --> 01:30:14,21
来吧

1461
01:31:23,78 --> 01:31:28,84
这是lBll 第三组在第七街口发生车祸
<i>One-Baker-eleven. Unit three involved in a T.A. At St. Vincent's and Seventh.</i>

1462
01:32:03,52 --> 01:32:06,96
全体注意 目标进入高速公路旁防洪道
<i>All units, pursuit has entered flood control adjacent to 710 freeway.</i>

1463
01:32:07,02 --> 01:32:08,15
空中小组呢?
- Where's that air unit? - Requesting air unit. Same location.

1464
01:32:08,23 --> 01:32:10,06
请求空中支援

1465
01:32:12,36 --> 01:32:14,16
Al飞跃目标
<i>Air One. We're over the pursuit.</i>

1466
01:32:15,10 --> 01:32:18,16
嫌犯时速90哩向南飞驰
<i>Suspect traveling southbound at 90 miles an hour.</i>

1467
01:32:22,04 --> 01:32:24,34
跟着他 我紧跟着他
<i>- Stay with him, Air One. - I'm all over him.</i>

1468
01:32:28,61 --> 01:32:30,14
"注入一氧化氮"

1469
01:32:31,08 --> 01:32:32,45
"动啊，宝贝"
<i>- Suspect has increased speed to 120. - Maintain visual, Air One.</i>

1470
01:32:33,12 --> 01:32:34,95
嫌犯加速至l20哩

保持目标距万
<i>140 miles an hour.</i>

01:32:38,72 --> 01:32:40,02
别跟丢了
<i>- Do not lose him. - This is an A-Star, sir, not an Apache.</i>

1474
01:32:40,19 --> 01:32:42,35
这又不是阿帕契
<i>One-fifty. One-sixty.</i>

1475
01:32:42,93 --> 01:32:44,69
150，l60

1476
01:32:45,90 --> 01:32:47,09
他跑了
- He's gone. - God!

1477
01:32:47,16 --> 01:32:48,10
天啊
- Man, this guy can drive. - What, what?

1478
01:32:48,17 --> 01:32:49,69
这家伙真会开车

1479
01:32:49,77 --> 01:32:52,29
什么? 也许是车子的关系吧
It's probably mostly the car.

1480
01:32:55,54 --> 01:32:57,53
几点了?
Hey, what time is it?

1481
01:32:59,78 --> 01:33:01,64
七点半
7:30.

1482
01:33:04,75 --> 01:33:08,48
我想我得把你送出城去了
I think I'm gonna have to get you out of town or something.

1483
01:33:08,55 --> 01:33:11,28
你哥是世上最棒的偷车贼
Your brother's the best boost in the world, but I don't know if he's gonna make this one.

1484
01:33:11,36 --> 01:33:13,35
但他这回可能不会成功了

1485
01:33:15,69 --> 01:33:20,03
我不像我哥，我不会抛弃朋友
I'm not like my brother, you know. I just don't abandon my friends.

1486
01:33:20,10 --> 01:33:22,86
我真该海扁你一顿
Oh, man. I ought to smack you silly, boy.

1487
01:33:25,60 --> 01:33:28,44
你以为你哥跑了?
You know, your brother ran away, is that what you think?

1488
01:33:28,51 --> 01:33:30,06
认清真相吧
You better get your story straight.

1489
01:33:33,21 --> 01:33:35,61
那就说啊，把真相告诉我
Well, go on then. Straighten it out.

1490
01:33:36,75 --> 01:33:38,91
你妈叫他走的
Your mother told him to go.

1491
01:33:39,45 --> 01:33:42,15
她知道要是曼斐留下
<i>She knew if Memphis stayed, you were gonna walk his line.</i>

1492
01:33:42,22 --> 01:33:43,74
你就会步他后尘
<i>You were gonna join his crew.</i>

1493
01:33:43,82 --> 01:33:47,92
你会加入他，所以她叫他走
<i>But she told him to pick up and go.</i>

1494
01:33:47,99 --> 01:33:52,05
他走了，以为这样针你最好
And he did, thinkin' it was best for you.

1495
01:33:52,13 --> 01:33:55,86
他为了你…万开我们
<i>He left all of us. For you.</i>

1496
01:33:57,84 --> 01:33:59,74
那其实没什么大不了
Guess it wasn't that big a deal for him though, really.

1497
01:33:59,80 --> 01:34:04,00
抛下一切并不是多大的牺牲
Wasn't that big a sacrifice, leavin' everything he'd ever known behind.

1498
01:34:04,64 --> 01:34:06,91
六年后，人生真奇妙…
And six years later, ain't life grand?

1499
01:34:07,01 --> 01:34:09,27
你还是成了一个偷车贼
You became a car boost anyway. How about that?

1500
01:34:10,21 --> 01:34:11,68
怎么样?

1501
01:34:12,38 --> 01:34:15,11
我给他打了镇静剂，他睡了
I sedated him. He's sleeping.

1502
01:34:15,19 --> 01:34:17,09
他不会有事的
<i>He's gonna be just fine.</i>

1503
01:34:19,92 --> 01:34:23,55
(距最后期限二十五分钟)

1504
01:34:44,92 --> 01:34:48,04
只是小伤，伊琳诺 可以修好的
It's just a scratch, Eleanor. It can be fixed.

1505
01:34:47,77 --> 01:34:50,43
No, no, no, don't.

1506
01:34:49,92 --> 01:34:53,45
不…别这样，别这么对我
Don't do this to me. Don't... Don't start with me.

1507
01:34:53,52 --> 01:34:55,96
不、不要…快启动
Don't... No, no... No, start!

1508
01:34:56,03 --> 01:34:58,82
启动啊，拜托，启动
Start, start, start. Come on. Come on.

1509
01:35:01,20 --> 01:35:02,50
我需要你，伊琳诺
<i>I need you, Eleanor. I need you now, now.</i>

1510
01:35:02,50 --> 01:35:04,93
我现在就需要你

1511
01:35:10,86 --> 01:35:12,79
<i>All units, be advised.</i>

1512
01:35:12,48 --> 01:35:13,50
全体注意
<i>Suspect vehicle headed south on Henry Ford Boulevard.</i>

1513
01:35:13,61 --> 01:35:16,41
嫌犯在福特大道上向南前进

1514
01:35:16,48 --> 01:35:18,91
我们该在海洋街拦下他
We should hit him at Ocean Avenue at the end of this bridge.

1515
01:35:20,85 --> 01:35:22,82
他在那里
There he is. There he is! Yeah.

1516
01:35:22,89 --> 01:35:25,98
我看到你了，小子
I got you, Raines! I got you, boy!

1517
01:35:31,36 --> 01:35:32,76
再过来
That's it. Keep it comin'.

1518
01:35:35,60 --> 01:35:36,96
(港口船坞)

1519
01:35:48,11 --> 01:35:49,98

Whoa! Shit! Shit.

<i>One-Baker-eleven, be advised. Suspect heading westbound.</i>

<i>Head east to intercept.</i>

1523
01:36:21,68 --> 01:36:25,14

<i>One-Baker-eleven, maintain your course. Suspect heading in your direction.</i>

1524
01:36:40,66 --> 01:36:43,39
他在码头底，正转向朝你前进
<i>One-Baker-eleven, he's at the end of the pier turning towards you.</i>

1525
01:36:46,57 --> 01:36:48,33
走开
<i>Wait! Hang on! Hang onto it!</i>

1526
01:36:55,41 --> 01:36:56,38
可恶

1527
01:37:14,51 --> 01:37:16,28
Oh, shit.

1528
01:37:30,78 --> 01:37:31,98
动啊
Move, move!

1529
01:37:48,80 --> 01:37:50,39
还好吗
Is he okay?

1530
01:37:51,60 --> 01:37:55,70
你没事吧，别乱动 我想是吧
- How are you doing? Are you all right? - Yeah.

1531
01:37:52,92 --> 01:37:54,98
- Are you okay? Just sit back. You all right? - I think so.

1532
01:37:55,77 --> 01:37:58,87
你确定?你刚穿过一面墙呢
Are you sure? 'Cause you just went through a wall.

1533

下车

1544
01:39:19,36 --> 01:39:20,32
姓雷的
Raines!

1545

曼斐呢?
- Where's, uh... Where's Memphis? - I don't know, man.

1546
01:40:10,31 --> 01:40:11,83
不知道
- He's not back yet. - What do you mean, he's not back yet?

1547
01:40:11,94 --> 01:40:13,64
他还没回来

1548
01:40:14,34 --> 01:40:16,74
什么叫还没回来?八点了
It's 8:00.

1549
01:40:22,69 --> 01:40:23,55
我是艾利
- Atley. - Time's up, Atley.

1550
01:40:23,62 --> 01:40:27,49
时间到，老艾 只有四十九辆，还差一辆
I've got 49 cars. That's one less than required.

1551
01:40:27,56 --> 01:40:30,12
把那小子带来，我们要解决他 什么小子?
- Bring the kid, and we'll settle this. - What kid is that?

1552
01:40:30,19 --> 01:40:34,19
你以为我指的是谁?
Oh, you know. The Cincinnati Kid, Billy the Kid. Which kid did you think I mean?

1553
01:40:34,26 --> 01:40:36,76
我想你指的是雷奇普
Oh, gee, I don't know. I think that maybe you mean Kip Raines.

1554
01:40:36,83 --> 01:40:38,96
我想你说的对
<i>Well, gee. I think you're right.</i>

1555
01:40:39,04 --> 01:40:40,80
情况很可笑
Yeah. Well, you know, it's a funny thing. That little son of a bitch evaded me.

1556
01:40:40,87 --> 01:40:44,14
那个小混球躲着我

1557
01:40:44,24 --> 01:40:47,27
找到他 要是找不到呢?
- Find him, Atley. - Well, what if I can't find him?

1558
01:40:47,38 --> 01:40:50,35
那就惩罚他哥哥，我不在乎
Then big brother takes the fall for the slipup. It doesn't matter much to me.

1559
01:40:50,41 --> 01:40:52,21
一个姓雷的就够用了
One Raines is as good as another. It never rains, but it pours.

1560
01:40:52,28 --> 01:40:54,48
不能雷声大雨点小吧

1561
01:40:55,82 --> 01:40:58,12
该死…
Son of a...! Just... Well, you know, I think you can thank your big brother.

1562
01:40:58,19 --> 01:40:59,78
感谢你哥吧
I think he just took your place under the guillotine.

1563
01:40:59,86 --> 01:41:03,69
他要代你上断头台了

1564
01:41:11,92 --> 01:41:15,25
Sorry, mate. We're all done here.

1565
01:41:13,87 --> 01:41:16,17
抱歉，兄弟，一切都结束了
<i>- No, we're not done. This is number 50. - You're late.</i>

1566
01:41:16,24 --> 01:41:18,33
不，还没有，这是第50辆

1567
01:41:18,44 --> 01:41:20,57
你退到了，滚吧
So sod off. You got a problem with that,

1568
01:41:20,68 --> 01:41:23,70
有疑问就去找卡先生谈
take it up with Calitri.

1569
01:41:42,43 --> 01:41:43,42
你迟到了
- You're late. - Wait. You're gonna argue with me over 12 minutes?

1570
01:41:44,37 --> 01:41:47,73
等等，你要跟我争这十二分钟

1571
01:41:46,89 --> 01:41:49,95
I just stole 50 cars for you in one night!

1572
01:41:48,41 --> 01:41:51,27
我一晚帮你偷了五十辆车

1573
01:41:51,37 --> 01:41:54,00
我有点累…有点急躁
All right? I'm a little tired. I'm a little wired!

1574
01:41:54,11 --> 01:41:56,91
我想我该值得称赞
And I think I deserve a little appreciation.

1575
01:41:57,25 --> 01:41:59,55
我说五十辆，不是四十九辆半
I said 50 cars, not 491/2.

1576
01:41:59,62 --> 01:42:03,72
四十九辆半?她没那么糟吧
491/2? She's not so bad, man. She's got, what? You know, some paint and, uh...

1577
01:42:03,72 --> 01:42:05,02
她只需要烤个漆

1578
01:42:06,89 --> 01:42:09,55
再加点玻璃纤维，没错
<i>Some fiberglass. Yes, indeedy.</i>

1579
01:42:09,63 --> 01:42:12,49
年签上写她价值六、七万
You know, and the book on her is 60, 70, call it 80.

1580
01:42:12,56 --> 01:42:14,39
是八万，用八万来算…
So you take 80, all right? You subtract it from 200. All right. And we make a deal.

1581
01:42:14,46 --> 01:42:16,90
从二十万中扣掉

1582
01:42:16,97 --> 01:42:18,33
交易达成
You take 80 from 200, and we call it even.

1583
01:42:18,40 --> 01:42:21,53
二十万扣八万我们就算互不相欠吧

1584
01:42:20,65 --> 01:42:23,05
Done.

1585
01:42:22,27 --> 01:42:23,57
同意
All right. Good. And this thing with my brother's over.

1586
01:42:24,07 --> 01:42:27,04
很好，我弟弟的事了结了

1587
01:42:27,34 --> 01:42:28,87
了结了
It's over.

1588
01:42:29,61 --> 01:42:31,41
了结、结束了
It's done. It's finished.

1589
01:42:32,78 --> 01:42:34,77
了结、结束了
Done. Finished.

1590
01:42:41,93 --> 01:42:45,79
没人侮辱过我 或用枪指着我过
Nobody insults me. Nobody puts a gun to me head.

1591
01:42:48,03 --> 01:42:50,80
杀了他，把车毁了
Kill him. Shred the car.

1592
01:43:00,31 --> 01:43:01,64
好
All right. Where's Raymond Calitri's place?

1593
01:43:02,81 --> 01:43:04,68
姓卡的巢穴在哪?
Exeter Salvage and Steel. It's on the water. Why, are we goin'?

1594
01:43:04,75 --> 01:43:06,15
艾克西特废铁场

1595
01:43:06,22 --> 01:43:10,08
要去吗?凶杀组不准我们…
Because, you know, homicide specifically ordered us not to interfere.

1596
01:43:10,15 --> 01:43:12,49
去他的凶杀组
To hell with homicide.

1597
01:43:28,67 --> 01:43:30,40
独角兽
Unicorn.

1598
01:43:30,51 --> 01:43:31,80
什么?
- What? - Nothing.

1599
01:43:31,91 --> 01:43:32,77
没什么

1600
01:43:37,38 --> 01:43:40,25
你喜散射哪里?
So, where would you like it, sir?

1601
01:43:40,45 --> 01:43:43,01
射头还是胸口?
I n the head or in the chest?

1602
01:43:43,52 --> 01:43:44,51
胸口
- The chest. - My pleasure.

1603
01:43:44,59 --> 01:43:45,99
我的荣幸
<i>Hey, wait a minute, fellas! Hold it.</i>

1604
01:43:46,56 --> 01:43:49,92
等等，各位，计划改变
- Big change of plan here. - That's far enough, Atley.

1605
01:43:49,99 --> 01:43:51,55
别再靠近了，老艾
What are you doing? No, no, no!

1606
01:43:51,63 --> 01:43:53,96
你在干嘛?不

1607
01:43:54,03 --> 01:43:55,05
别过来
I said stop there, Atley!

1608
01:43:55,93 --> 01:43:58,99
老大派我上来问你一个问题
<i>No, no. Calitri just sent me up here to ask you a question.</i>

1609
01:44:09,55 --> 01:44:11,38
不会有事的
<i>All right? Everything's gonna be all right. We got it covered.</i>

1610
01:44:11,45 --> 01:44:13,25
带大家离开
Get my brother outta here.

1611
01:44:14,53 --> 01:44:18,49
Hey.

1612
01:44:19,19 --> 01:44:22,25
你挑孩子帮你做事是错的
You made a mistake pickin' a kid to do your dirty work.

1613
01:44:23,26 --> 01:44:25,99
更大的错误是挑上我弟弟
<i>Made an even bigger mistake pickin' my kid brother.</i>

1614
01:44:26,36 --> 01:44:29,85
而最大错特错的就是想杀我
And now, you just made the biggest mistake tryin' to kill me.

1615
01:44:34,57 --> 01:44:35,66
小心点
- No. Be careful with that. - This?

1616
01:44:35,74 --> 01:44:37,07
这个? 把它放下
- Just put it down. - That's right. You got a thing about wood.

1617
01:44:37,14 --> 01:44:39,30
对了，你对木头有癖好

1618
01:44:39,74 --> 01:44:40,44
把它放下
Just put it down.

1619
01:44:41,18 --> 01:44:42,87
不
No! No!

1620
01:44:44,08 --> 01:44:44,81
不
- No! - I... I...

1621
01:44:44,88 --> 01:44:46,54
我…
- No! - Oh, no.

1622
01:44:47,48 --> 01:44:48,45
糟糕

1623
01:45:29,38 --> 01:45:32,50
- Psst. - I'm good.

1624
01:45:32,13 --> 01:45:33,43
我还好

1625
01:46:39,51 --> 01:46:41,41
God! Jesus!

1626
01:46:41,33 --> 01:46:42,32
天啊
God.

1627
01:46:47,44 --> 01:46:50,34
你是谁? 我是警察
- Who are you? - I'm a police officer. You don't wanna do that now.

1628
01:46:50,41 --> 01:46:52,57
你不会想那么做的 我想
- Yeah, I do. - Listen to me.

1629
01:46:52,68 --> 01:46:54,58
听着，跟我走
You walk outta here with me, you got some options. You kill me... now you think about this...

1630
01:46:54,64 --> 01:46:56,34
你有很多选择

1631
01:46:56,45 --> 01:46:58,44
要是杀了我，你想想…
I'm a police officer. Your life will be over.

1632
01:46:58,55 --> 01:47:01,14
我是警察，你保证死定了

1633
01:47:01,22 --> 01:47:04,58
你弄错了，是你死定了
No, you've got that the wrong way around. If I kill you, your life's over.

1634
01:47:04,65 --> 01:47:09,18
结果也不会太坏 葬礼会有电视转播
<i>Not all bad, though. Funeral will be on the telly. Everybody out there, pressed and dressed.</i>

1635
01:47:09,46 --> 01:47:12,09
有仪仗队还有鸣枪21响致敬
Guard of honor. Twenty-one gun salute and the Stars and Stripes draped all over your coffin.

1636
01:47:12,16 --> 01:47:14,15
你的棺木上还会覆盖国旗

1637
01:47:15,33 --> 01:47:17,06
人生最光荣的一天
It'll be the greatest day of your life.

1638
01:47:47,70 --> 01:47:51,10
我面临最大的道德困境
Here I am smack dab in the middle of a moral dilemma, Randall.

1639
01:47:51,37 --> 01:47:55,77
你和你的伊琳诺 搞得城里鸡飞狗跳
You've torn this town to shreds with that little escapade of yours. You and your Eleanor.

1640
01:47:56,11 --> 01:47:58,60
但我知道你重出江湖的原因
But I understand what brought you back here.

1641
01:47:59,91 --> 01:48:02,40
手足之情…
A brother's love is a brother's love.

1642
01:48:02,45 --> 01:48:03,94
就是手足之情

1643
01:48:06,52 --> 01:48:08,75
你救了我一命
You saved my life, didn't you?

1644
01:48:07,90 --> 01:48:10,73
<i>So what am I gonna do?</i>

1645
01:48:09,62 --> 01:48:11,45
我该怎么办呢?
It's your call, Detective.

1646
01:48:11,52 --> 01:48:13,82
由你决定，警探

1647
01:48:15,96 --> 01:48:19,79
快走吧，曼斐 一切由我来处理
Get outta here, Randall. I'll clean this up.

1648
01:48:22,03 --> 01:48:25,90
走吧，趁我还没改变主意
Go, Randall, before I change my mind. Go.

1649
01:48:27,29 --> 01:48:32,52
Oh, uh, there's a container ship. At pier 14.

1650
01:48:29,97 --> 01:48:33,43
十四号码头有艘货柜船

1651
01:48:33,54 --> 01:48:35,44
你也许会想去查一下
You might want to check it out.

1652
01:48:43,84 --> 01:48:49,21
Oh. Look here. Can a good-lookin', hard-workin' chef get a beer around here?

1653
01:48:47,42 --> 01:48:50,29
英俊努力的大厨能喝啤酒吗?

1654
01:48:50,36 --> 01:48:52,73
小飞，你很闭，帮我拿啤酒
Come on, Tumbler. You ain't doin' nothin'. Hand me a beer, baby.

1655
01:48:54,40 --> 01:48:57,37
好耶，曼斐，大家快吃吧
All right, Memphis, guys, food! Thank you, sir.

1656
01:48:57,43 --> 01:48:58,42
谢了
Damn.

1657
01:48:58,74 --> 01:48:59,60
妈的
- Ow, ow. - Wait, wait, wait.

1658
01:49:03,14 --> 01:49:04,47
可怜的托比
Poor Toby, man. Sure looks like he's in a lot of pain.

1659
01:49:05,01 --> 01:49:06,98
他一定痛毙了

1660
01:49:07,08 --> 01:49:09,74
那样会痛，你杀了我算了
If that's pain, you can shoot me anytime.

1661
01:49:10,25 --> 01:49:12,41
性感小猫
Sexy, sexy.

1662
01:49:13,88 --> 01:49:18,29
他的受伤要是能启发你们…
If his unpleasant wounding...

1663
01:49:15,20 --> 01:49:17,40
has in some way enlightened the rest of you...

1664
01:49:18,35 --> 01:49:21,95
认清犯罪生活下的残酷结局
<i>as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life...</i>

1665
01:49:22,03 --> 01:49:24,36
并让你们改变生活
<i>and inspired you to change your ways,</i>

1666
01:49:24,83 --> 01:49:29,99
那么他的伤… 就既尊贵又荣耀
then his injuries carry with it an inherent nobility and a supreme glory.

1667
01:49:30,07 --> 01:49:32,00
我们应该都很幸运
We should all be so fortunate.

1668
01:49:32,07 --> 01:49:34,06
你说"可怜的托比"
You say, "Poor Toby."

1669
01:49:35,57 --> 01:49:37,13
我说"可怜的我们"
I say, "Poor us."

1670
01:49:39,58 --> 01:49:41,57
他说话了
- He spoke. - Yeah.

1671
01:49:41,68 --> 01:49:43,65
我一直以为你是长堤人
Hey, man, I thought you were from Long Beach.

1672
01:49:46,18 --> 01:49:47,41
斐曼
<i>Hey, Memphis. Hey.</i>

1673
01:49:51,45 --> 01:49:53,32
我有东西要给你
I have something for you.

1674
01:49:53,39 --> 01:49:55,69
这是什么? 打开吧
- What is this? - Open it.

1675
01:49:57,36 --> 01:49:58,38
钥匙
Keys. Keys are good. What do I do with 'em?

1676
01:49:58,46 --> 01:50:01,09
钥匙很好，我要钥匙干嘛?

1677
01:50:01,16 --> 01:50:05,00
大家进来，快过来
<i>Hey, everybody. Everybody.</i>

1678
01:50:02,61 --> 01:50:06,28
Inside here. Let's go. Everybody, come on. Let's go.

1679
01:50:05,07 --> 01:50:07,20
大家快进来
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my great pleasure...

1680
01:50:07,27 --> 01:50:09,50
各位女士先生…

1681
01:50:09,57 --> 01:50:11,01
我很荣幸

1682
01:50:12,01 --> 01:50:13,84
来呈现…
to present...

1683
01:50:14,54 --> 01:50:16,44
天啊 你的伊琳诺
- Oh, man. Oh, man! - There you go. Eleanor.

1684
01:50:15,56 --> 01:50:18,76
<i>- What? What? It's Eleanor. - How about that?</i>

1685
01:50:18,68 --> 01:50:19,65
是伊琳诺呢
<i>- Look at his face. - All yours.</i>

1686
01:50:21,08 --> 01:50:22,57
她是你的了

1687
01:50:24,02 --> 01:50:26,78
她有点旧，给我几周
Now it's a heap, but give me a couple of weeks and it'll look like...

1688
01:50:26,86 --> 01:50:28,69
她就能脱胎换骨了
a streamlined butterfly.

1689
01:50:32,73 --> 01:50:33,92
你没有…
- You didn't... - Oh, no, no, no.

1690
01:50:34,26 --> 01:50:38,36
没有…我卖了摩托车买的
I, uh... I parted the chopper out for that.

1691
01:50:37,48 --> 01:50:40,65
I'm blown away.

1692
01:50:39,10 --> 01:50:40,90
我真惊讶

1693
01:50:41,44 --> 01:50:43,53
你卖了一辆车给我
You bought me a car.

1694
01:50:43,84 --> 01:50:47,44
是啊，她代表我对你的感谢
Well, yeah, you know. It's just a token of my appreciation for, uh...

1695
01:50:47,81 --> 01:50:49,87
你懂吧?
<i>For everything.</i>

1696
01:50:51,06 --> 01:50:54,16
<i>That's the way it should be.</i>

1697
01:50:52,78 --> 01:50:57,24
兄弟就该这样，没错
That's the way it should be. That's right.

1698
01:50:59,40 --> 01:51:03,00
- Yeah. - Why don't you get in there and go for a ride?

1699
01:51:01,59 --> 01:51:03,92
你何不开车兜一图
I know what you did.

1700
01:51:03,99 --> 01:51:05,55
我知道你所做的一切

1701
01:51:06,73 --> 01:51:08,13
谢谢你
- And I thank you. - I'll see you later, man.

1702
01:51:08,87 --> 01:51:10,30
待会见了

1703
01:51:22,35 --> 01:51:24,91
想兜风吗? 好啊
- You wanna go for a ride? - Hell, yes.

1704
01:51:47,50 --> 01:51:49,30
别这样
<i>Oh, don't do this to me.</i>

1705
01:51:51,54 --> 01:51:56,50
本片结束
