1
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,750
Corner of Wiltern and Wetherly.

2
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,540
Tumbler messed up.
He said the Porsche would be
at the corner of Wiltern and Wetherly.

3
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,630
- It's right there.
- You're bullshittin' me, right?

4
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,090
- 9024 Wiltern?
- What?

5
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,760
- That?
- I gotta get my tool.

6
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,020
- Kip!
- He ain't bullshittin'.

7
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,980
Kip! Man, that's not a tool.
That's a damn brick.

8
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,530
Kip, man, we gonna use a brick, man,
we might as well call prison
and make reservations.

9
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,820
Aw, come on.

10
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,530
- Oh--
- Get the number.

11
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,580
42850.

12
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,330
Hurry up, man.

13
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Man, let's go!

14
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,880
Let's get the hell outta here.

15
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,220
Okay, Billy Bad-ass,
you got us in here.

16
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,350
Now tell me
how the hell we gonna get out.

17
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,350
Oh, no, I know you ain't gonna do
what I think you're gonna do.

18
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,390
- Oh, man!
- Come on!

19
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,730
- This ain't The Dukes ofHazzard!
- Come on!

20
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,460
Yo, so check out my new move.
I call it the stranger.

21
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,300
What I do is, I sit on my hand...

22
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,420
for, like, 1 5, 20 minutes,
until it goes numb.

23
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,220
No feeling at all.

24
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,720
- And then I rub one out.
- The stranger, huh?

25
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,520
It's like a little boy's nursery school
I've come upon here.

26
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,810
Where are they?

27
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,740
- Yeah.
- You want to? All right.
- Hey!

28
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,280
- Man, leave those people alone, man.
- Oh, my God, sweetie,
you're so talented.

29
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,610
- What-- Hey. Hey.
- What did he say?

30
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,580
- No. Stop. No! No!
- Stolen car. Stolen car.

31
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,910
Hey, I-- I love you.

32
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,670
Man, we going tojail, man!

33
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,050
Come on!

34
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,220
Put your hands behind your back.
You have the right to remain silent.

35
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,220
Hey, watch it!

36
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,690
We have a silver Porsche,
estimated speed 80 miles per hour...

37
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,440
heading west on Wilshire Boulevard.

38
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,940
Yeah.

39
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,900
This is Air One.
We have a visual of the suspect.

40
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,150
Southbound on Vincent Thomas Bridge.

41
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,910
- Something wrong, Tumbler?
- Yeah. I'm missing Jerry Springer.

42
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

43
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,680
That's right, that's right,
that's right.

44
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,100
- What's up, old man?
- She'll go zero to 60 in 5.2. seconds.

45
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,110
Believe me, I can vouch for that.

46
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,400
Ground units, be advised, suspects last
seen entering south side of warehouse.

47
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,950
Thirteen down,
thirty-seven to go.

48
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,750
- What the hell is that?
- What is that, man?

49
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,420
- Now you've gone and done it, Raines.
- What is that?

50
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,420
- Tumbler!
- What's going on?
- Get the board and get the lights!

51
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,920
- All right, I got it, I got it!
- This is bullshit!

52
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,590
- It's not comin' off!
- Keys! Get the keys!

53
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,340
- I got 'em, I got 'em!
- Come on, everybody, let's go!
Hurry up!

54
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,800
- I got it!
- Let's go!

55
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,640
Toby, get it!
Let's go, boys!

56
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,270
Come on, come on, come on!
I got the light! I got the light!

57
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,100
Go, go, go! Let's go!

58
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,980
- Get busy, get busy, get busy
- Shit!
- l guess l didn't know

59
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,200
l guess l didn't know
Get busy time

60
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,660
l guess l didn't
l guess l didn't know

61
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,290
We got tape
all over the other side.

62
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,580
- Get the VIN number on that?
- Got it.

63
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,260
- We've got some more lamp shades
by the truck.
- Let's get those tools dusted.

64
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,170
What do we got?

65
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,430
All gone.
We didn't get a single one of them.

66
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,970
And we are talkin' about professionals.

67
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,220
No visible damage to locking mechanisms,
steering columns or ignitions...

68
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,560
and, as you can see,
these are not Honda Civics.

69
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,480
This is one ofthree
brand new Mercedes...

70
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,530
a car they say is unstealable.

71
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,070
Yeah, unless you get the laser-cut
transponder key...

72
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,780
sent directly to the U.S. dealer
from Hamburg.

73
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,660
They got somebody
working on the inside.

74
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,910
Let's find out which dealership
sold 'em, who serviced 'em,
et cetera, et cetera.

75
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,460
Yeah, I'll get on it.

76
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,710
- Mr Drycoff?
- Yeah?

77
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,050
Let's impound these cars
for one month.

78
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,430
I don't give a damn
ifthey belong to Tom Cruise.

79
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,870
Control, vision, determination.

80
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,330
These are the three
fundamental components...

81
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,340
of the new generation race car driver.

82
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,720
Speed is a byproduct.
Going fa st.

83
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,800
But remember:
The car is you, you are the car.

84
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,890
Okay? Let's ride!

85
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,320
Billy, you just shaved one second
off your lap time!

86
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,040
Tommy, I don't know what that was,
but it wasn't driving.

87
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,670
Go get 'em.

88
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,770
Well, well, well.

89
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,020
What do you pay your pit crews with,
Oreos and Gummi Bears?

90
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,820
I folded, Atley. You know that.
What are you doing here?

91
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,070
- Is there some place we can talk?
- About what?

92
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,610
About your brother
and the deep shit he's in.

93
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,870
Frank. Would you watch the kids
for a minute?

94
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,340
- Tell me about Kip.
- He took a job and he fumbled it.

95
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,180
Now he's jammed up.
He's jammed up bad.

96
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,180
- What kind ofjob?
- A boost. A big boost.

97
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,680
A boost.

98
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,940
What's Kip doin' on a boost?

99
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,320
Oh, you're shittin' me, man.

100
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,490
Kip's become quite the little
crew runner since you left.

101
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,570
- You don't talk to your ma?
- She neglected to mention it.

102
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,500
Listen, I need somethin'.
I-I need somethin' cold to drink.

103
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,130
I thought we were goin'
someplace to talk.

104
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:10,720
- Who was the job for?
- A new guy named Raymond Calitri.

105
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,010
They call him ''The Carpenter.''

106
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,230
He's runnin'
all the dark ponies down there now.

107
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,310
It's a full-on
''Devil Came Down to Long Beach'' trip.

108
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,440
He's bad. He's real bad.

109
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,320
And this Calitri
is the one who's after my brother?

110
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,360
Like stains on a mattress.

111
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,830
And you should know,
I work for him.

112
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,500
There weren't a lot ofopportunities
for retired car thieves on the gimp.

113
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,460
He put me to work.

114
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,300
But I gotta tell you, Memphis, this guy,
he scares the shit out of even me.

115
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,910
What are you doing, man?

116
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,670
Stop! Stop!

117
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,130
AtleyJackson.

118
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Right. They have Kip.

119
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,640
Take me there.

120
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,460
Raymond Calitri, Memphis Raines.

121
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:11,010
I try to learn your ways,
understand your obsessions.

122
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,850
But this baseball,
it's so bleeding boring. Isn't it?

123
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,470
Where's my brother?

124
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,350
Memphis Raines.
Your legend proceeds you.

125
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,770
Atley tells me you're the best.

126
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,610
Afteryou left, auto theft in
the South Bay area went down 47 percent.

127
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,490
Where's my brother?

128
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,330
I'm proud of these. Straddle chair
from the Arts and Crafts period.

129
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,120
Mahogany table with cloud-lift pattern.
Black walnut wine table.

130
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,210
Metal's cold, ugly.
Wood's warm, clean.

131
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,880
Provided by nature.

132
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,680
To see a piece of furniture take shape,
it's like watching a child grow.

133
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,510
I asked you a question.

134
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,480
They threw us out England, threw us
out of France, but here we are.

135
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,360
Flourishing, really, except for
the minor inconvenience of despising
everything about your country.

136
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,900
On this list you'll find 50 cars--
five, zero.

137
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,620
I need all 50 delivered
to Long Beach Harbor, pier 1 4,
by 8:00 a.m. four days from now.

138
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,740
I'm paying $200,000.

139
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,330
I'm not interested.
I'm just here for my brother.

140
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,790
Your Kip came to me.
He had street cred.

141
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,880
The brother
of the notorious Memphis Raines.

142
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,760
So two weeks ago I hired him
and advanced him $1 0,000.

143
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,760
Atley told me. If it's about the
advance, I can understand your anger.

144
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:40,430
A debt has to be settled.
Ten grand, from me to you.

145
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,560
- I wish it was that easy.
- I don't see the complication.

146
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,860
I have four days to deliver 50 cars,
and I have no cars.

147
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,200
- Well, that's another problem.
- It is another problem, isn't it?

148
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,240
It's about me delivering 50 top-end cars
because I said I would...

149
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,450
because if I don't my South American
friend goes somewhere else from now on.

150
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,660
And that's not good.
It's a humiliation.

151
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,960
Because I'm the asshole
who said I could deliver.

152
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,880
Am I an asshole?
Do I look like an asshole?

153
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,590
Yeah.

154
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,510
- I need that paper satisfied.
- I'm retired.

155
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,720
Now, where the hell is my brother?

156
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,310
I made this as well.
My first one.

157
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,460
It takes 80,000 pounds of pressure
to crush a car.

158
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,600
Kip?

159
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,180
- Who's that?
- Memphis.

160
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,730
- Oh, shit.
- You okay?

161
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,990
- Shut it off!
- Turn it off!

162
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,240
- You've got 30 seconds
to consideryour options.
- Shut it off!

163
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,410
One: You kill me, they kill you,
your brother dies anyway.

164
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,170
Two: You lie, you accept the job,
you take your brother, you run.

165
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,630
I hunt you down, I kill you,
I kill your brother...

166
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,340
and I kill your mother
for the aggravation you've caused me.

167
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,800
Three: You accept the deal, you steal
some cars, you make some money...

168
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,220
and you be a big brother.

169
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,150
- Memphis!
- 8:00 a.m. Friday morning.

170
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,230
The cars are on the boat,
or your brother's in the coffi n.

171
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,860
Get me out of here!
Somebody get me out of here!

172
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,750
Listen, you don't really
have to make me anything.

173
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,540
Oh, hey, you come down here, you
save my ass, it's the least I can do.

174
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,510
Hey, I heard you were pumpin' gas
someplace up north or somethin', right?

175
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,180
- Yeah, I'm workin' with kids.
- Oh, really?

176
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,390
First place.

177
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,480
I remember this.

178
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,570
Oh, yeah, that was a--
that was a long time ago.

179
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,410
Yeah.

180
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,370
- What'd you put in it?
- I don't know.

181
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,920
It's good.

182
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,390
Ow. Ow.

183
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,680
Oh, God.

184
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,190
- Does Mom know about any of this?
- No, no, no, she doesn't.

185
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,270
And, uh, I don't think she should.

186
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,190
You know, she-- she works really hard,
and this, this-- she doesn't need
to know about any of this stuff.

187
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,400
Look, you know,
I got everything under control.

188
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,120
The kitchen's on fi re.

189
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,670
Uh, man.

190
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,130
Hey, Memphis.

191
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,010
It's good to see you.

192
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,390
Yeah, haul the cartons over there!

193
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,850
- Hey, Fuzzy.
- Aw, shit. What are you doing here?

194
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,400
- I told you I don't know anything.
- Yeah, but you're a liar.

195
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,200
- You're gonna get me fired, man.
- Fired? That's not good.
You're on parole, right?

196
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,490
Fuzzy. Hey.
Nobody wants to get you fired.

197
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,000
Wejust need this information
is all.

198
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,920
Two weeks ago a call came in
for a lot oftop-end cars.

199
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,420
- And who made that call?
- I don't have a clue.

200
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,340
- Okay, we'll just go talk to your boss.
- Shh!

201
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,720
The delivery date.
I know the delivery date.

202
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,840
- And when is that?
- Thursday, Friday, end of the week.

203
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,510
Well, you get me a name within 48 hours,
or we'll be back.

204
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,270
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Thankyou.

205
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,940
- I'm looking for Helen Raines.
- Helen.

206
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,490
- Some guy is here foryou.
- What guy? What's he look like?

207
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,820
Like a fi recracker. Like your son.

208
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,040
- You look so good.
- Thankyou, Mom.

209
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,080
Okay, Spring, uh-- Spring Bouquet.

210
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,790
-What are you doing here?
-Well, uh, AtleyJackson came to see me.

211
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,300
He told me something about Kip.

212
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,800
Can I help you with one of these?

213
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,810
Okay. That's yours.

214
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,390
Tell Castlebeck he's not gonna believe
who just walked into the Quality Cafe.

215
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,520
I can't say I'm surprised.

216
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,860
All his life he looked up to you,
tried to be you.

217
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,530
I guess now he is.

218
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,820
So why is this happening?
I send you guys money.

219
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,910
He-- He met some people,
and he changed.

220
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,920
He lost that-- that s-sweetness.
You know?

221
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,300
Okay, tell me.

222
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,970
- How deep in is he?
- Deep.

223
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,100
Can you get him out?

224
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,970
It means doing things.

225
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,230
Things I told you
I'd never do again.

226
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,320
Do what it takes, Randall.

227
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,580
- When did you get into town, Raines?
- Last night.

228
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,630
- Last night? What for?
- I thought I'd catch a Lakers game.

229
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,630
Heard we got Shaquille.
Guys wanna go?

230
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,880
- Guess not.
- Randall, Randall, Randall. Come here.

231
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,260
I get this call from this uniform,
you know.

232
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,680
Axton. Very nice man.
Remembers everything.

233
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,020
This man calls me up, says,
''Guess who's back in town?''

234
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,230
I say, ''Who?''
He says, ''Randall Raines.''

235
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,360
I say, ''Randall Raines, the car thief? ''
He says, ''Yeah.''

236
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,900
I say, ''Impossible.''
He says, ''No, he's back.''

237
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,360
I say, ''No, he's not.''
He says, ''Yes, I will bet you $200
I just saw Randall Raines.''

238
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,450
- You guys said a lot. Look, Detective--
- No, w-w-whoa, whoa.

239
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,660
What's really,
really ironic about this--

240
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,580
Two nights ago we snare these 1 3
fresh stolens waiting for export, right?

241
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,130
And at the time I'm thinking,
''This feels like Randall Raines.''

242
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,210
Now, it didn't have your panache,
your, uh, flash...

243
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,510
but it just fe lt like Randall Raines.

244
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,260
And now here you are.

245
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,010
Look, I don't know what you boys are
looking for, but I just got back. Okay?

246
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,680
It was a family emergency.
Now, that's the truth.

247
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,230
''Family emergency.'' Yeah, I got
a family emergency too, Randall.

248
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,190
I gotta go tell my woman
that I just lost $200 on a stupid deal.

249
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,940
- Mmm, she's mean.
- What?

250
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,200
She can be mean to m--
It's not so--

251
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,910
Come here. Come here, Randall.

252
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,790
Take those glasses off, man, please.
Do me a favour.

253
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,670
Six years ago you make
a real smart move, you know.

254
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,130
You retire from a life
that's gonna get you busted or killed,
or maybe even both.

255
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,550
And I'm thinkin' that not putting you
away when I had a chance...

256
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,930
is like this big bug up the ass of this
real impressive career that I've had.

257
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,150
Oh, yeah, well, without disappointment,
you can't appreciate victory.

258
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,440
- Eleanor tell you that?
- Well, now, that's hittin'
below the belt.

259
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,360
Yeah, all right, let me tell you
about ''below the belt,'' Randall.

260
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,110
I tell you what-- From here on out,
ifyou walk across the street
outside of a cross walk...

261
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,540
ifyou roll through a stop sign,
ifyou use an aerosol can in a manner
other than directed--

262
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,960
I mean, I don't care. You make one slip,
and I will put you away for good.

263
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,170
- Okay.
- By the time you get out, asshole,
there won't even be cars.

264
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,380
We'll all be cruisin' around
in, you know, little spaceships.

265
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,890
That's gonna suck.

266
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,770
- Who's Eleanor?
- It's a damn car.

267
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,900
And don't you ever talk about my wife.

268
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,990
Excuse me.
Do you know where Otto is?

269
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,120
He's in the back in the paint shop.

270
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,010
Is that you?
It's about time you came to see me.

271
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,050
- H-Hey!
- I missed you.
- It's good to see you!

272
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,350
- You look great.
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

273
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,770
- Ah. You remember myJunie?
- Hey,Junie. How are you?

274
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,350
- We're doing good, thankyou.
- Good. Good.

275
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,980
- You look happy.
- Well, I am happy. I really am.

276
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,820
- So what happened here?
- What do you mean?

277
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,950
Well, it's nice. But the chop shop,
the stripped cars, my education--

278
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,830
What happened? Hey.

279
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,750
Old age happened, that's what happened.
Got tired of killin' 'em.

280
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,580
You know, I woke up
one morning and thought...

281
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,290
''I'm no longer a destroyer.
I am a means of resurrection.''

282
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,380
Now we restore, we revive.

283
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,760
- Come here.
Remember when we used to do this?
- What?

284
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,050
You know. Come here. Okay.

285
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:52,640
The Ferrari 365 GDB4, Daytona.
Le Mans, 1 971 .

286
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,480
- Five cam--
- No, that's a V-1 2.

287
00:24:54,650 --> 00:25:01,440
V-1 2! Right, right, right, right!
Here it peaks at 5,500 r.p.m.!

288
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,490
-What do you know about Raymond Calitri?
-Who?

289
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,030
Raymond Calitri.

290
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,660
Uh, excuse us, sweetness.
I'll be right back.

291
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,500
- Listen, we can talk right here.
- Okay? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's all right.

292
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,630
Raymond Calitri.

293
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,590
He's a jackal tearing at the soft belly
ofour-- of our fair town.

294
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,340
And he's an asshole to boot,
so be careful.

295
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,180
I heard about Kip.

296
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,930
- Are you considering a comeback tour?
- Do you think it can be done?

297
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,770
Don't do this to me, okay?
Pl-- Please.

298
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,110
Please. Not now.

299
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,690
Oh, man.

300
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,790
- How many cars?
- Fifty.

301
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,290
- How many days?
- Three.

302
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,000
- How many in your crew?
- One, but I came here hoping
to negotiate for a second.

303
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,510
No way. It can't be done.
I mean, you need time to prep,
time to shop. You know that.

304
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,050
It has to be.
They're gonna kill him.

305
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,520
Oh, man.

306
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,070
It was a mistake to come here.

307
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,450
You have a great life now.
I don't want to upset that.

308
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,830
Uh, uh, wait a minute.
Whoa. Hold on.

309
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,460
Look around you.

310
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,170
These days
I'm all about second chances.

311
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,680
So, uh, let's make a few phone calls
and we'll go from there, okay?

312
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,430
Okay.

313
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,940
Don't look at me!
Look at the people next to you!
Next to you! Turn the wheel!

314
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,070
Pull over!
Pull it the hell over!

315
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,110
Asshole!
Learn how to drive!

316
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,950
Don't touch nothin'.Just--

317
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,660
No!

318
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,040
You can't negotiate turns,
you can't signal properly...

319
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,790
you can't maintain speed,
you can't parallel park.

320
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,920
Hell, you can't drive, honey.
Shit, I can't swim. I know I can't.

321
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,840
So you know what I do?
I stay my black ass out the pool!

322
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,350
All right, now, just--

323
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,230
Can you-- Oh! Hello.

324
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,980
Memphis! Hey, how are you?

325
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,110
Sure, sure. When? Okay.

326
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,530
- 323-969-81 1 .
- All right, man. Thanks a lot.

327
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,200
Donny.

328
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,460
Just take it around the block
a couple of times. Okay? All right.

329
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,920
- l've seen betterdays
- Hello. I'm calling for Frankie Fish.

330
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,010
Frank's dead, man.
Yeah, h-he got scragged.

331
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,270
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, yeah, I'm looking
for Henry Santoro.

332
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,310
- He went down to Florida with that
asshole Frankie Fish. You see him,
you tell him I want my money.

333
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,560
- I didn't mess with your money.
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm looking for Dan and Mikey.

334
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,280
Both of'em up to Chino.
Doin' a nickel apiece.

335
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,360
Now I'm not so sure I want
to tell you who this is.

336
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,700
- Yeah, try it, asshole.
- You sound, uh, very busy right now.

337
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,830
You sound very, very busy.

338
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,500
- There's only two names left.
- Yeah? Let's see which ones you got.

339
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,670
Sphinx-- Those two? No way.

340
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,800
- There's no one else.
- Are you sure?

341
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,510
- ..going in there.
- You tell him.
- Listen, why should I--

342
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,180
- Come on!
- You were the one
who answered the phone, right?

343
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,310
Fine. But how's a guy who can't speak
gonna take a phone call?

344
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,810
You've got a call!

345
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,620
Sphinx, is thatyou?

346
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,000
Press a button if it's you.

347
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,300
Sway, you set up this brakejob?

348
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,560
Yeah. He warped all four rotors.
He must've been riding those brakes
like an old lady.

349
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,440
- That's nice.
- Sounds like the left bank's
running lean.

350
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,530
The service department's over there.

351
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,290
- Can I talk to you?
- Talk to me? Yeah, sure, talk.

352
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,040
- Well, thing of it is,
I came back because--
- Do you know what time it is?

353
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,880
It's 5:30.
I came back because--

354
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,340
- I gotta go. I'm late for work.
- Here, let me--

355
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:15,390
- You're at work.
- I got twojobs.

356
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,480
I have discovered that you have to work
twice as hard when it's honest.

357
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,150
- Hey, Sway, can I get another shot?
- Yeah.

358
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,780
You're still looking amazing.

359
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,370
While you look like a bible salesman.

360
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,870
You're healed.

361
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,580
- Can we improvise a little bit?
- Sure. What do you have in mind?

362
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,090
Do you wanna get a little crazy?
There's a Cutlass 442 in the back.

363
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,920
We can strip down and shine the hood.
What do you say?

364
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,090
Uh, that's not what I had in mind.

365
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,180
No?

366
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,850
It's about my brother.

367
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,390
- Kip's in trouble.
- In trouble?

368
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,350
- He took a boost, and he blew it.
- Shit.

369
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,820
- And you got some Italians?
- Five or six.

370
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,780
- Right.
- It's 50 ladies in 24 hours, $200,000.

371
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,950
Well, I've cleaned up.

372
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,460
I understand. I hate to
even come here and askyou--

373
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,460
-Sway, can I get that drink now, please?
-Yes.

374
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,710
And I had to ask a few of the others
too, and I feel bad about it, but--

375
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,800
- But you had no choice.
You had to come here. Yeah.
- Pretty much.

376
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,970
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

377
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,680
I'd love to help Kip,
but I-I'm not into the life any more.

378
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,110
- Well, that's a good thing.
- Yeah.

379
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,320
- I'm glad to see you're doing well.
- Sorry I can't help you.

380
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,660
- I'd like to pay for your drink.
- That's fi ne.

381
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,120
How about that drink?

382
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,950
Yeah, how about that drink?

383
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,290
- Raines. Memphis Raines, huh?
- Do I know you?

384
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,630
Well, you should know me, considering
all the business you done screwed up
for me in the past, baby.

385
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,800
-Johnny B.
- That's me.

386
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,560
- What can I do foryou?
- Well, I'm gonna tell you
what you can do for me, baby.

387
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,890
Get out of Long Beach tonight.

388
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,100
I'll be gone in three days.
I'm just here on some family business.

389
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,780
Word on the street says Raymond Calitri
hired you and your brother
for a top order...

390
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,860
a order shoulda went to me.

391
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,280
That's not the way it went down,Johnny.

392
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,090
Hey! Get away from my car, asshole!

393
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,020
You got somethin' to say
before I kill you, fool?

394
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,760
Sphinx.

395
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,260
Otto send you?

396
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,810
l'm gonna call the doctor

397
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,480
l'm gonnaget better

398
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,860
- l'm gonna run for the priest
- Oh, Dad.

399
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,110
We'd probably both be working
at the dealership if he hadn't died...

400
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,280
just like normal people.

401
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,790
Shit.

402
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,670
- What's the matter with you?
- Man, six years does a lot of
different things to people.

403
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,510
You know, I-- I don't know where you
went, but, you know, you're in there,
you're talkin' about bein' normal.

404
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,890
I mean, y-you were always the one who
was goin' after the easy money. Shit.

405
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,230
I didn't do it for the money.

406
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,570
I did it for the cars.

407
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,070
Gleaming in marina blue...

408
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,830
sun fire yellow...

409
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,290
Marlboro red...

410
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,870
begging to be plucked.

411
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,710
And I'd do it.

412
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,260
I'd boost her...

413
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,300
and just blast to Palm Springs...

414
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,720
instantly feeling better about being me.

415
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:03,810
And then, the next day, it seems like,
I'm getting shot at...

416
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,070
my friends are dying,
people are going tojail.

417
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,570
I didn't like what I'd become.

418
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,240
Yeah, and then you left...

419
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,910
and then I didn't have
a brother any more.

420
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,870
And now you wanna give me advice...

421
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,960
and I don't even know you.

422
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,630
And, you know, I got my own family now.
I got my own friends.

423
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,920
And, you know, you can say what you want
about them, but they're loyal.

424
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,970
Well, when you hit the wall,
the same thing is gonna happen.

425
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,100
You and your family...

426
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,940
are either gonna get shot...

427
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,440
or get a five-yearjolt at Corcoran.

428
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,330
Those Mercedes we impounded,
need those newfa ngled laser-cut keys?

429
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,170
Each one's from Dressner Foreign Motors,
downtown Newport...

430
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,750
where all the employees are clean
except for him.

431
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,760
James Lakewood. Served a nickel
at Folsom for auto insurance fraud.

432
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,140
Well, gosh, I bet hejust neglected
to mention that to the people
at Dressner Foreign Motors, huh?

433
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,850
It gets better. YoungJames there
places orders for lost keys
to the Mercedes home offi ce in Germany.

434
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,530
- The list.
- Ah, the list.

435
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,570
Well, I guess we gotta start
beatin' the bushes and try to
find out where they l-- Whoa.

436
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,490
- 1 967 Shelby GT 500.
- I know. I know.
- You got Eleanor here?

437
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,290
Otto, there's somebody here to see you.

438
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,630
Oh! The puppy's a big dog now.

439
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,130
- How you doin'?
- Hey there, Kipper. What is this up--
What's that up under there?

440
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,470
Hey. Hey, Otto. How you doin'?
It's a long time. Good to see you.

441
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:00,680
- Uh, what are you doin' here, Kip?
- Well, actually, we-- We actually
came to talk about some things.

442
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,350
- About what?
- Well, you know.

443
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,310
It seems like you guys need
a little help, and we thought
that we should participate.

444
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,360
But I just promised Mom
I was getting you out of this.

445
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,650
Listen-- Loo-- No, we're talking
about a lot of money here.

446
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,570
- A-And ifyou guys think you're
gonna be gettin' into our Kool-Aid...
- Money?

447
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,900
- you gotta be out of your minds.
- Is that why you think I'm doing this?

448
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,660
- You inconsiderate little punk!
- Can you explain to me how think three
washed-up car thieves...

449
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,910
- well, then you call Mom
and you explain to her...
- and an old man...

450
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,750
- how you wanna--
- are gonna steal 50 cars in two days?

451
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,250
Hey. Hey. Hey.

452
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,630
This is why I do not do business
with family.

453
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,130
I thinkyou should consider this.

454
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,680
Oh, come on, Otto, please. No, his
criminal career has come to an end.

455
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,340
Well, his life will come to an end
unless we pull this off.

456
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,180
And how can we do it without him?
It can't be done, and you know it.

457
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,400
- You guys have any skills at all?
- Please.

458
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,690
Yeah, we have skills. We, um-- Mirror
Man here, he's an electronics expert.

459
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,780
You know, h-he's got some gadgets
that-- that you old fa rts
probably never heard of.

460
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,580
You know, uh, Tumbler over here,
he can pretty much drive
anything with wheels...

461
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,870
and, you know,
some things without wheels.

462
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,000
And, uh, and Toby,
he's a computer genius.

463
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,380
He's-- He's-- He does
fa scinating things with computers.

464
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,300
Wh-What exactly can you do
with a computer, Toby?

465
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,880
I can hack into the DMV mainframe,
I can change VIN numbers...

466
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,180
I can change addresses, registrations.

467
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,640
I can do a lot
of really tricky stuff, okay?

468
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,890
All right, all right,
we do this, we do it my way.

469
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,140
I run the show.
You take your orders from me.

470
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,520
- Ifyou have any problems with that,
you can leave now.
- N-No, that's fi ne.

471
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,360
- Yeah, well, w-who is--
- That's fi ne.
- Who is Gilligan here,

472
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,570
Uh, Gilligan is actually Freb. Freb
can order pizzas like nobody's business.

473
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,200
- What?
- It's true.

474
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,080
Hey, people gotta eat right?

475
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,460
This is outrageous.
I want my lawyer.

476
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,750
I'm not saying a word
till I get a lawyer.

477
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,300
- All right,James, that's an option.
- And, frankly, a reasonable one.

478
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,550
So you call your lawyer,James.
You tell him you've been arrested
on suspicion of grand theft auto.

479
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,680
- We indict you.
- He'll bail you out.

480
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,020
- And we move on to trial.
- Okay, okay.

481
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,520
Kid came to me,
said he'd pay $500 a key.

482
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,280
So I put the order forms through, and
he picked 'em up a couple days later.

483
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,820
- What's the kid's name?
- We kept it anonymous.

484
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,700
He was a well-built kid.
Uh, uh, looks like a boxer.

485
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,670
- What do you want me to do?
- When he comes back, you call us.

486
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,460
- What says he comes back?
- A hunch.

487
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,840
To make the Friday 8:00 a.m. deadline
you're gonna have to go old school.

488
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,510
A one-night boost.
Put all your nuts in one basket. Okay?

489
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,220
- ''One night''?
- Yes.
- What, are you crazy? ''One night.''

490
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,770
- What, do you have, like,
a better plan or something?
- Yeah. You spread it out.

491
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,810
- You play shadow games and shit.
- We're on a truncated timetable.

492
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,900
- Otto, I'm sorry. C-Can you just listen
to me for one second? All right?
- We've heard you, Kip. Shadow games.

493
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,240
But what you have to understand is
that ifyou play shadow games...

494
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,030
by the second night
the heat is onto you.

495
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:08,500
With a one-night boost, by the time the
first car is reported stolen, your ship
sets sail; it's a surprise attack.

496
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:12,540
This is a complicated list, fe llas.
It really is. Okay?

497
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,760
There are 25 that aren't a problem,
but these exotics are tough to find.

498
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,300
And the new Mercedes,
they require laser-cut keys. Okay?

499
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,760
- Uh, yeah, I got that covered.
- You have that covered?

500
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,100
- What'd I just say?
Yeah, I got it covered.
- Yeah. Yeah.

501
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,770
All right, all right.
Well, then, let's get to work.

502
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,980
Toby, hack into the insurance database
and find as many cars as you can.

503
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:37,190
Yes! I got addresses
on Hillary, Natalie and Tracy.

504
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,700
Donny, check the DMV
for the remaining cars on the list.

505
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm sorry, miss, but you've missed
five questions. That's failing.

506
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,120
- Oh, no!
- Next.

507
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,620
No! Why?

508
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,290
- You're supposed to go fa ster
when somebody tailgates you!
- Ah. Hello again.

509
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,710
Mm-hmm. Here's your list
of the 20 car owners' names
and addresses that you requested.

510
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,010
- Thankyou.
- That's $1 00, please.

511
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,760
- A hundred dollars?
- Five dollars a car, 20 cars.

512
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:07,560
- Would you like a calculator?
- It used to be two dollars a car.
Thanks a lot.

513
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,690
- That's all redesigned, right?
- My name is Roger, sir.
May I be of some help?

514
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:17,360
That's funny. My name's Roger.
Two Rogers don't make a right.

515
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,070
- Roger, I have a problem.
- Yes?

516
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,200
I've been in L.A. three months now.
I have money, I have taste.

517
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:27,410
But I'm not on anybody's ''A'' list,
and Saturday night is the loneliest
night of the week for me.

518
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,370
Well, a Ferrari
would certainly change that.

519
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,540
Perhaps, mmm. But you know,
this is the one. Yes, yes, yes.

520
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:40,130
I saw three of these parked outside
the local Starbucks this morning,
which tells me only one thing--

521
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,510
there's too many self- indulgent wieners
in this city with too much bloody money!

522
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:52,230
Now, if I was driving
a 1 967 275 GTB fo ur-cam--

523
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,610
You would not be
a self- indulgent wiener, sir.

524
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,690
- You would be a connoisseur.
- Precisely.

525
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,650
Champagne would fa ll from the heavens.

526
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,530
Doors would open.
Velvet ropes would part.

527
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,950
I don't have one here.
However, I do have one in the warehouse.

528
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,120
Superb.
What else do you have in the warehouse?

529
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,090
Mm-hmm. All right. Uh-huh.

530
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,720
That was Mr Lakewood
from the dealership.

531
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,260
He says that boxer-lookin' punk
is gonna pick up the keys
to three new Mercedes today.

532
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,140
Same make and model as the ones
we already got impounded.

533
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,720
Now we talkin'.

534
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:36,860
The El Spirito de Graciela
sails Friday...

535
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,820
8:00 a.m. sharp.

536
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,400
We'll target all the cars
within 45 minutes of here.

537
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,450
By the time their alarm
tracking systems are activated...

538
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,580
the cars will already be
in these containers.

539
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,960
Fellas, this is Sway.

540
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,510
No questions. I'm here for Kip.

541
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,010
- All right.
- All right.

542
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,240
- lt 's me. He's-- He's here.
- ln the redChevy Nova ?

543
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,410
- Uh, that's affirmative, sir.
- Pull over.

544
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,910
All right, as soon as he leaves,
you call me with the owners' addresses.

545
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,910
-All right?
- I'll get those forms right over, sir.

546
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,880
Damn boss.
Always on my case.

547
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,630
- I got three here?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thankyou.

548
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,770
Huh.

549
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,860
Randall Raines,
Donny Astricky, Otto Halliwell.

550
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,610
- Should I set up some tails?
- Uh-uh.

551
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,530
They're too smart for that.
They'll just dump the cars.

552
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,830
No, we'll get them
with the Mercedes.

553
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,790
Let's set up, uh, three surveillance
teams at those addresses.

554
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,420
Now, you go ahead
and you make your move, man...

555
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,630
and I will be waiting foryou.

556
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:28,100
- Why do you call 'em girls' names?
- That's a good question.

557
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,470
- Why do you call 'em girls' names?
- It's a code.

558
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,770
You say Jane, you say Shirley,
Lucy, Edna...

559
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,400
and nobody listening on the waves
is the wiser.

560
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,150
Got 'em.

561
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:53,580
All right, we've got the addresses
on all 50 ladies. Let's scout 'em.

562
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,130
- There she is.
- Nice.

563
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,930
Damn, it's cold up here.
They keep these Ferraris refrigerated?

564
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:08,390
And you know black people
don't like cold weather.
We're a tropical people, man.

565
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:13,890
When this is over, I'm gonna
smoke a joint, watch two hours of Roots,
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

566
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,690
Hello, and welcome to TVCar Trivia.

567
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,030
First question:
Who was the driver of a '73 Firebird?

568
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,700
- Uh, Otto.
- Uh,Jim Rockford, Rockford Files.

569
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,280
Give me Columbo.

570
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,570
- A Peugeot convertible.
- What colour?

571
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,950
- Grey.
- How you know that?

572
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,950
'Cause llo ve thatshow.

573
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,170
Well, I got three words for all y'all:
get a life.

574
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,330
Oh, this is some kiddie shit, Sphinx.

575
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,170
What's on Magnum P.I.'s licence plate?

576
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:46,050
- Robin 1.
- Wait, wasn 't Robin that faggoty guy
who hung with him ?

577
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,640
No, that was Higgins.
That was Higgins.

578
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,760
Hey, ten points
for our fearless leader.

579
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,810
Sway, how about giving us the honour
of the Bill Bixby trifecta?

580
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,820
He dro ve a Corvette in The Magician,
a Ford pickup truck
in The Incredible Hulk...

581
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,150
and in The Courtship of Eddie 's Father
he walked.

582
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,910
- Bingo.
- My man.

583
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,170
We get tired of lookin '
at each other

584
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,600
Al, tell me somethin '.

585
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,430
Nothin' doin' here, sir.
Nobody's showing.

586
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,270
Copy.

587
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,350
A minivan approaching.

588
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,900
It seems a little late
for soccer practise.

589
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,950
Heads up. I think we got
some activity right here.

590
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:56,120
Oh, that is--
Looks like it's Kip Raines.
And we got a Randall Raines.

591
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:58,750
Ifthey take this,
we will take them down.

592
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,630
He's pulling something out
of his pocket. You see that?

593
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,550
It's a camera. Looks like
he'sjust doing some homework.

594
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,310
All right, let's leave him be. I don't
wanna burn this. They will be back.

595
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,930
Huh.

596
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,900
You know what? Let's go over
to Otto's in the morning.

597
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,530
Kick over some rocks
and see what's underneath there.

598
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:29,820
We saved the best for last:
the '67 Shelby Mustang GT-500.

599
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,370
- The GT-500?
- Yeah, yeah.

600
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,710
There she is.

601
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:42,670
Yep. There's Eleanor.

602
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,800
Eleanor is Memphis' unicorn.

603
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,800
- What's a unicorn?
- A fa bled creature?

604
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,310
You know, the horse with the horn?
Impossible to capture?

605
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,270
It's the one car that, no matter
how many times you try to boost...

606
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,270
something always happens.

607
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,940
We're gonna get through this this time,
right? It's gonna be smooth.

608
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,240
- What's he doing?
- It's gonna be easy.

609
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:11,780
He's talking to her, man,
trying to get reacquainted.

610
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:15,910
You know, they had a rough history. She
almost got him killed a couple of times.

611
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,750
- I don't want any talking back.
- He flipped one on the Harbor Freeway.

612
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,000
He went off the Long Beach Pier once.

613
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:25,170
A smooth, easy ride.

614
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,090
We'rejust gonna glide.

615
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,850
Big night tomorrow, guys.
Let's go home.

616
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,770
- Did you-- Did you get the picture?
- Yeah.

617
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:40,900
See you tomorrow night, Eleanor,
with your fi ne ass.

618
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,860
Man, we're almost home.
You wanna get something to eat?

619
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,240
I'd like to get a chocolate malt.

620
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,210
- Hey! Hey!
- Get out of the car!

621
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,130
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

622
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,560
- Why are people shooting at us?
- 'Cause I blew up their car.

623
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:37,790
Over here!

624
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,380
''Beast.''

625
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,340
Okay, okay.

626
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,680
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

627
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,390
Hey!

628
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:43,190
Oh, you-- y-you think it's a game?

629
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,110
Johnny B.
The cops, man.

630
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,360
I ain't got nothin' but time, baby.

631
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,330
Oh, man,
we're gonna be here all night, man.

632
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:08,460
Look! Cop car! Uh-huh!

633
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:12,840
Long as I'm in here, you'rejust gonna
sit out there. Aren't ya? All right?

634
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:19,390
Hey, listen, this is the plan.
This is what we're gonna do.

635
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,230
There's a big rig over there--

636
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,150
Uh, mister, is that your truck
out there, the Big Rig Wrecker?

637
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,110
- The Big Rig Wrecker's mine, but--
- That's cool.

638
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,090
What do I gotta do? How do I learn?
What do I do? Where do I go?

639
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,470
- Well, you gotta go
to truck driving school.
- Truck dri-- I know, man, I know.

640
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:53,050
But I mean, like, um--

641
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,810
You boys ready to play
a little Pin the Tail on the Donkey?

642
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,850
- Can I get you
a jelly doughnut or something, man?
- No, I'm just gonna go ahead and go.

643
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,600
- 'Cause I'm gonna have the waffl e and--
- I'm gonna-- Maybe next time, though.

644
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,750
I'm gonna smoke you!

645
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,560
- Hey! Damn!
- What the hell's going on?

646
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,690
- Want some of this?
- Yeah.

647
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,410
-You guys got permits for these weapons?
-Oh, man.

648
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,590
So you think I can
only get pizzas, huh?

649
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,470
- Boosted it myself.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. How'd you get it?

650
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,190
- Actually, the keys were in it.
- Oh, yeah, well, that kind of
defies the point then, don't it?

651
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:28,770
You stole a car that wasn't on the list.
You stole a car that wasn't on the list!

652
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,610
Why didn't you just go to the police
station in-- in a red clown suit...

653
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,700
and let everybody know
what we're doin' here?

654
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,820
- What have we got?
- I don't know.

655
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,370
- Shit! Fellas.
- What?

656
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,210
- Give me that.
- Check this out.
- Let me see that.

657
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,330
- Check this out.
- Let me see that.

658
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,170
- What?
- Look.
- This looks like heroin.

659
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,380
- Yeah.
- What?
- Exactly.

660
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,300
- Where did you get this car?
- In front of some poker parlour
in Chinatown.

661
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,760
You ever consider why a car
in a neighbourhood like that
would have its keys left in it?

662
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:00,350
- No.
- Maybe because nobody in that
neighbourhood would be stupid enough

663
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,770
- All right.
Get this shit out of here. Take it back.
- No, no, no, we can't take it back.

664
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:04,850
- Get it out of here!
- Will everybody relax for a second?

665
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,320
- Shut up.
- No, no, no! Take it back!
- Take it back!

666
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:14,490
- I want that shit.
Give me that. Give me that.
- Now! Out!

667
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,080
- Look what you--
- Man, I will knock the shit out ofyou.

668
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,330
- Shut up.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

669
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,250
- Who is it?
- Detective Castlebeck.

670
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,120
Oh. Christ.

671
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,850
Goddamn it.

672
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:46,600
- Hey, hello, Otto.
- Detective. Good to see ya.

673
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,360
- Long time.
- Yeah. You're looking good.

674
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,320
Thankyou.

675
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:56,780
So, Randall, what do we got here?
We got a multigenerational
gathering of players?

676
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,450
- Is that what we got here?
- Yeah, right.

677
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,830
Here's Donny. How you been, D?

678
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,370
- I'm just happy to see you, brother.
- Yeah.

679
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,750
I got to tell you, Randall,
seeing you here, Otto, Donny...

680
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,090
makes me feel almost nostalgic.

681
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,590
Kind of like a big reunion.

682
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,680
You should stick around,
'cause a little later we're gonna...

683
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,060
make s'mores and sing ''Kumbayah.''

684
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,810
- Yeah. What is this?
- What's it--
- This.

685
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,610
They call this a Cadillac. Yeah.

686
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,610
- What's wrong with it, Otto?
- Needs restoration.

687
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,530
- What?
- Brightening.

688
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,700
- Otto. You got a '39 Ford right there.
- Well, that's a pretty car, isn't it?

689
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:42,450
- Yeah.
- Isn't that a nice car?
- And right here you got

690
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,920
Now, these are beautiful cars, Otto.
And here we got a '83 Cadillac Eldorado?

691
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,540
- Yeah.
- I mean, who the hell pays...

692
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,880
to brighten up a Cadillac Eldorado?

693
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:56,340
I-I think it holds a certain,
uh, sentimental value, you know?

694
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:59,010
N-Nothing more.

695
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,680
Run me down a tag.

696
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,770
C licence 3-2-9-H-R-O.

697
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:14,490
That is, uh, Harold, Randall, Otto,
burgundy Cadillac.

698
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:22,330
No fa ith in our newfo und
goodness, Detective, huh?

699
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:25,830
Task force runs on statistics
and numbers, Otto. You know that.

700
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,540
- Randall, this Kip?
- That's my brother. He's all grown up.

701
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:36,010
One-Baker-eleven, Pacific Division,
three-two-niner, Harold, Randall, Otto.

702
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:40,600
No wants, no warrants at this time.
DMVnot on file.

703
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,640
- Copy that. Thankyou.
- See, I know what you're doin'.

704
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,810
I know. You--
You're thinking there's no want...

705
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:51,020
but that, uh, I stripped its guts
and crated her up, right?

706
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,690
- Is that what you did, Randall?
- No, I didn't do it.

707
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,940
You know, forget it.
You're trying to hurt my feelings? Fine!

708
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,990
You know what? Go ahead.
Do it. Let her rip.

709
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,120
- Go ahead. Rev it up.
- All right, goddamn it. I will.

710
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,240
Sell it to you cheap.

711
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:06,330
Yeah, '83, first year they put
the auto-ride control on these boys.

712
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,460
Oh, I don't know. You probably know more
about cars at this point than I do.

713
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:14,260
- What? You slippin' on me, Randall?
- No, it'sjust your knowledge
overwhelms me.

714
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,550
- It's got a real nice-sounding engine,
right, Otto?
- 4.1 litre.

715
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,470
- Digital fuel injection?
- You got it.

716
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,350
- All right. Let's see what she got.
- You the man.

717
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,560
Give it some more. Give it some more.

718
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,900
- Yeah, that's it!
- Go! Go!

719
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,980
- Let's go!
- Come on.

720
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,610
Baby, don't be so mean!

721
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,910
- Yeah, that's it!
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, yeah, that was good.

722
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:43,910
Yeah, you break it,
you buy it, my friend.

723
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,040
Yeah, she got some power goin' on.

724
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,920
All right.

725
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,130
I'll catch you later then.

726
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:16,530
- It's on for tonight.
- How do you know?

727
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,990
They got the call signs
on all the units working tonight.

728
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,910
What-- What were you
gonna do with this?

729
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,290
- I was gonna bonk him.
- What? Bonk?

730
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:31,580
For the next 24 hours,
all your decision-making privileges
have been removed!

731
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,130
- You got it?
- Got it.
- Yeah, that's cool, man.

732
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,720
Obviously they're onto us.
He's sniffi n' real close.

733
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,220
If anything tonight appears
out of place, I want you to cut bait,
get out of there and walk away.

734
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:44,600
And get rid of this goddam car!

735
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:50,190
- What's up, Kip?
- Toby, what are you doin'?

736
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:52,270
You think you're comin' with us,
but you're not.

737
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,570
- What are you talkin' about, man?
I'm part of the team. I get to go.
- No.

738
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:59,650
No, no, wake up. You're gonna end up
in jail or in the morgue or some shit.
Don't be stupid.

739
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,780
What am I supposed to do?

740
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,080
Did you see a box
of rubber gloves here, man?

741
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,040
Gloves? Man, you don't need gloves.
This is the new age. Check this out.

742
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:13,710
- What is this?
- Let mejust see that big claw
you call a hand.

743
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,260
That's not doughnut jelly,
so don't eat it.

744
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,260
Your new fingerprints.
Elvis is back.

745
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,720
- Boy got skills, right?
- Yeah, you do.

746
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,850
Look like a little ghetto Smurf.

747
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,670
I am a bad man.

748
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,510
Thanks. Thanks for doin' this.

749
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:07,310
Keep it real. Think slow.

750
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,350
We should get through it just fi ne.

751
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:15,940
''Low Rider,'' Donny.
Donny? ''Low Rider.''

752
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:32,170
All my friends know the lo wrider

753
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:37,250
Yeah, the lo wrider
is a little higher

754
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,630
Yeah

755
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,140
Okay, let's ride.

756
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,030
Oh! Shit.

757
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,040
Give me the damn torch.

758
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,250
What? I tell you, I'm the man.

759
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:17,960
Now, where does this go?
Find a way to get in here. Get this--

760
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:21,340
I tell you, I'm running this shit!
You do that again, I will kick--

761
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,840
Cool, man. You don't have
to take it so damn personal.

762
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,430
Ah! Everything is perfect.

763
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:46,160
Hello, ladies.
Always was a sucker for a redhead.

764
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:50,290
Let's go. Come on.
Move. Move. Go, go!

765
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:56,040
Workyour magic, baby. I know you know
Ferraris. Work your magic.

766
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:58,250
Girl got skills.

767
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,990
You all right?

768
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,870
- You think we're gonna make it?
- I don't know. It's too early to tell.

769
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:59,980
Diana, Tricia, Nadine and Rose
are on their way.

770
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,240
Good goin', guys.

771
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:28,930
- Al, tell me something.
- Unit Two. Sorry, sir, nothin' yet.

772
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:34,520
Son of a bitch. I know you're not
parking right in front of me.

773
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,560
Oh, no, I can't see a damn thing.

774
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,900
All right, we gotta move.

775
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:58,920
- You ever feel bad about any of this?
- Hell, no.

776
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:02,840
I'm Robin Hood, man. I rob from
the rich and give to the needy.

777
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,760
- Damn! Donny!
- I got you. I got you.

778
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:11,390
- You mean, the poor.
- Cutters.

779
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,230
Cutters.

780
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,190
No, like I said, the needy.

781
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:20,110
'Cause, brother, we need this car.

782
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:30,740
- What's up, Doc?
- You're new, aren't you?

783
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,040
- Yeah, how can you tell?
- Now, listen, son.

784
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,420
- You take real good care of this car--
- All right.

785
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,090
- And I'll take care ofyou.
- Tell you what. Save it.

786
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,210
- You get another one
of these suits, all right?
- God bless you, son.

787
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,550
All right.
You need a fa shion counsellor.

788
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,720
All right, babe. I ain't here
for the door. I'm here for the car.
Get your big ass out.

789
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:49,300
- Hmm?
- Out! What are you lookin' at?

790
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:55,690
- Hey, man, that was as easy as pie.
- I'm a veteran, son.

791
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,810
Get out of the car, bitch,
or I'll blow your brains out!

792
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,190
- You gotta be shittin' me.
- I will shoot you! Damn it!

793
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,110
Damn!

794
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,780
You lazy, half-ass bully!
Any asshole can pull a gun on somebody!

795
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,240
You don't know the first thing
about stealing a car! Boy, I--

796
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,330
You need a role model!

797
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,420
Stacy.

798
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:37,520
Down and dirty, baby
Down and dirty, baby

799
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:41,570
Down and dirty, baby

800
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:44,400
- Shannon.
- Can't stop the rock
You can't stop the rock

801
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:48,910
Can't stop the rock, you can't
stop the rock, can't stop the rock

802
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:52,540
You can't stop the rock
Can't stop the rock

803
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,460
You can't stop the rock

804
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,960
Laura.

805
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,970
Lindsey.

806
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,510
Rachel.

807
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,690
Hey. Check this out.

808
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,500
J.J ., he's back, but he's smart.
He watches his ass.

809
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,670
Just hold ourpositions.
lfhe rolls, you follow him out.

810
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,420
Copy that.

811
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:54,020
What's he doin'?
What are you doin'? What are you doing?

812
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:05,110
We might as well roll down
our windows and wave.

813
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,450
-J.J ., you tail him, all right?
- Copy that.

814
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,370
Let's go.

815
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:21,080
- Good luck.
- Piece ofcake.

816
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:28,180
Unit One, this is Unit Two.
Astricky has landed.

817
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,430
lfthey roll, we take them down.

818
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,980
Last night that van was parked
four houses down. Now it's only two.

819
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,480
- We got company.
- Shit!

820
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:42,690
He's at the car.

821
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,570
Bird, come back.

822
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,700
- Stand by, Unit One.
- What?

823
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,910
- Where are you?
- Where do you think I am?

824
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,870
I'm at the casino, picking up
the pit boss's lady. What do you want?

825
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,040
The ladies are dirty. Walk away.

826
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:02,130
- The ladies are dirty.
- What?

827
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:05,460
I want everybody to get back
to the garage now.

828
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:07,800
Oh, so she's having
the baby right now?

829
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:10,010
- I guess I better get
to the hospital then, huh?
- He's having a baby.

830
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,720
- Something's got him spooked.
- My wife is having a baby.

831
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:17,230
That's-- Gotta get-- I'm just nervous.
This ain't even my car.
I'm way over here.

832
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,440
He's heading away
from the vehicle.

833
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:26,320
I see you.

834
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,620
Pull in over there.

835
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,930
Uh, this is Unit Two.
l-llost them.

836
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,930
All right, it's time
to talk to Fuzzy again.

837
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,810
Check this out.
Laser-encoded keys...

838
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:03,860
that send a message
to a receiver inside the car.

839
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:06,400
You want to tell me what you're--
you're doin' with these?

840
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:10,400
Yeah, these are from last week.
These are from the other boost.

841
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,620
- Give me this back.
- Who is it?

842
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,500
- Where did they come from?
- The keys! The keys! The keys!

843
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:24,380
- Give me them!
- Take it easy!
- Now, look!

844
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,050
- Now, give me this!
- What happened?
- Hey!

845
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,920
- What happened?
- Where'd you get these from?

846
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:30,130
- What's the problem?
- The Mercedes are dirty!

847
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,180
There's surveillance vans all over them.
Where'd they come from?

848
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:36,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa. My guy in Southland.
The same guy I used last time.
Same guy I used before.

849
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,560
- Before when?
- When we-- When we took the other cars.

850
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:41,900
- Other Mercedes.
- Oh, Christ.

851
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,690
Castlebeck.

852
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:47,230
He got to one of the guys
at the dealership, and he turned him.
That's what happened.

853
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,780
Eight hours left.

854
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:53,570
So, what? We're gonna
stand around and have a meeting?
What's-- What's going on?

855
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:58,370
Memphis, maybe it's time for us
to start thinking about how to get
these young kids out oftown, 'cause--

856
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:01,210
- Oh, man, you know what? No! That's--
- What are you talking about?
- Hey! Hey!

857
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:05,460
- They can't go--
- If there's no Mercedes, there's
no point in boosting any other cars.

858
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:07,380
You hear me? That's it.

859
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,760
47 is not 50, Memphis.
You know that's what he'll say.

860
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,840
Yeah.

861
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:16,220
Hey, Memphis, you know, we still have
the Mercedes keys from the last boost.

862
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:20,690
Hey! Those cars are
at the police impound.

863
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,770
Okay? The police impound. You want us
to go there and start stealin' cars?

864
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,690
- Well--
- Yeah.
- What?

865
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:26,900
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah.
- You're crazy.

866
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:31,320
- We're gonna get hectic. Let's go.
- No, Memphis, no. Don't do this!
- What?

867
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:33,490
Hey, Sphinx, I don't
look suspicious, do I, man?

868
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,950
Otto, man, I think that
your dog ate the keys!

869
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,330
Wait. He usually goes
for the licence plates.

870
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,420
- You sure? What?
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

871
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:46,630
- The dog ate the keys?
- Yes.

872
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,550
- How-- How are you gonna get them out?
- Not funny.

873
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,840
- I'm--
- Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't even think about it, Sphinx.

874
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:56,180
It's all right.

875
01:10:56,350 --> 01:11:00,770
Say, uh, Toby. Go, uh,
see ifyou can get some, uh, Alpo...

876
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:03,020
- and get some Ex-- Ex-Lax.
- Oh, Lord.

877
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:06,270
- No way, man!
- Bad dog!

878
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,150
Let's get back to work.

879
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,170
- Hey! Open the door!
- Oh,Jesus.

880
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:29,210
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- End it, rock star. Get in.

881
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:31,220
Jesus Christ!

882
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,550
- Now what, man? What else?
- Huh?

883
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:38,810
Fuzzy, you never called me.
So now we gotta stay down here...

884
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:40,980
till you tell me
everything you know.

885
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:45,560
Y-Yeah, I told you everything I know.
I know that because I said,
''This is everything I know.''

886
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:50,030
Detective Drycoff,
does it seem like the suspect
is violating his parole right now?

887
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,990
Why, yes, Detective Castlebeck,
if by violating his parole...

888
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:55,820
you mean failing to cooperate
with a law enforcement offi cer.

889
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,670
A little trick I learned
in the car thief retirement home.

890
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:07,290
Can you hold this?

891
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,710
No, no, no, I'm not failing
to cooperate. It'sjust that--

892
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,880
Well, yeah, yeah, o-o-okay. Okay. Okay.
Uh, uh, uh, word has it that, uh,

893
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:19,180
Kip Raines took the job,
and he-- he screwed up--
uh, he screwed up pretty bad.

894
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:21,020
And who put out the order
for the job?

895
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,770
It's Raymond Calitri's order.

896
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,070
Nice.

897
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:36,280
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

898
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,200
Yes!

899
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:46,170
We have six hours left.
Has the dog done its businessyet?

900
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:48,340
Toby and Freb
are walking him right now.

901
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,090
He's not gonna do it.
It's not gonna happen, man.

902
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:56,760
Come on, dog.
What's wrong, Hemi? Poop, dog.

903
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:01,680
- It had to be a girl car.
- Girl car?

904
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:04,690
What kind of a girl
drives a Hemi 'Cuda?

905
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,650
I'll show you.

906
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:09,730
Lipstick?

907
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,360
Matches the car.

908
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:16,110
What's next? Blush? Mascara?

909
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,370
Next time I'll, uh--
I'll pull out the, uh...

910
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:22,250
leather and high heels
and pink underwear foryou.

911
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:25,120
-Leather, high heels and pink underwear.
-Pink underwear.

912
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:27,750
Pink underwear works.
Pink underwear works.

913
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:35,550
Raymond Vincent Calitri did five years
in South London for manslaughter.

914
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,220
- He immigrated in '98.
- Look at this.

915
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:43,930
Loan sharking, extortion, fe ncing.
Ha. His front's a salvage yard.

916
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,160
Gonna have to wait it out.

917
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:11,750
- So, you seeing anybody?
- No.

918
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,380
No, I had a girl once.
She was great.

919
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:19,640
Hmm. So, ifshe was so great,
why'd you leave her?

920
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,370
I did askyou to come with me.

921
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,620
No, you asked me
to be a different person.

922
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:53,170
Yeah. I didn't want to see people get
hurt. I just wanted you to slow down.

923
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:57,720
Well, I couldn't,
'cause I wasn't ready.

924
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:01,470
- You're straight now.
- Yeah, I am.

925
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,390
'Cause it wasn't
the same without you.

926
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:12,900
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Hey, asshole. I was reading that.

927
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,490
- Watch your mouth, kid.
- What's goin' on?

928
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:17,070
- This is a homicide fi le
from a homicide investigation.
- All right.

929
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,450
It took us three months to get a
magistrate to give us a wiretap on 'im.

930
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:25,500
No other division, including GRAB,
can go near his person, residence
or place of business, all right?

931
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,790
- I just--
- You got it? Let me tell you guys
something, all right?

932
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:33,340
Raymond Calitri is going down
for murder one, boneheads.

933
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,670
Who gives a shit about
grand theft auto? Really.

934
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,390
- Man, I can't watch this.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Get it on. Get it over with.

935
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:49,190
Burnin 'on my lips

936
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:53,360
What do you think is more exciting,
having sex or stealing cars?

937
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:58,030
Having sex or boosting cars?
Um-- Ooh!

938
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,280
Uh--

939
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:05,370
Well, um, well, uh--

940
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:10,880
How about, uh,
having sex while boosting cars?

941
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,670
God, that's a good line.

942
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,380
Oh, doesn't work on
a lot of girls though.

943
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:19,760
I-- I just blurted it out.
I'm so--

944
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:25,220
But you haven't
answered the question.

945
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:30,310
Well, you see, the problem is,
how do you get over the shifter?

946
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,520
- Oh, oh, right, 'cause the, uh--
- 'Cause it gets in the way.

947
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:38,700
Because you-- you wouldn't want
to disrupt the, uh, synchromesh, right?

948
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,530
Or the throttle linkage.

949
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:46,160
lt's your kiss, kiss, kiss

950
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,830
The clutch master cylinder.

951
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,130
The touch of your fingertips

952
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,300
- Or the overhead cam shaft.
- I can't do this.

953
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:02,430
Wait, wait, wait.
Just straight in-line six...

954
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:07,940
triple lever carburettors bolted
to each other's body structures.

955
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,560
- What?
- Oh, it's time to work.

956
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:16,990
Good brakes. Good brakes too.

957
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:22,740
l've Still got your face

958
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:27,000
Painted on my heart

959
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,750
Fastenedon my memory

960
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,670
- There's nothin' happenin'.
- Maybe he's got indigestion.

961
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:38,260
- Well, dude, well,
get him some more Ex-Lax.
- He already ate two.

962
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:42,050
- Hey, little man.
- Oh, man.

963
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:45,560
I thought I told you. This is our turf.
What? You want to make a move?

964
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,520
We don't want anything
to do with your turf.

965
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,520
Something wrong with
where we live, dog?

966
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:52,610
No, no, it's cool foryou.
I mean, it'sjust not for us.

967
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,770
Oh, so now you think you're
better than us or something, huh?

968
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:58,280
- Maybe we should cut you up, dog?
- Um--

969
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:02,740
- Dude, the keys.
- Right. Excuse me a second, guys.

970
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:06,370
Oh, man!

971
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,580
- Oh, I'm gonna throw up, dog!
- Man, that's disgusting.

972
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:12,880
Man, what kind of pervert gets
theirjollies off playing with dog shit?

973
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,500
Look, man, I got 'em!
Look, all three, man!

974
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:18,170
- You guys are sick!
- I got 'em!

975
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:33,360
Wake up, man. Check this out.

976
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,860
Every time I drive my Volvo
in Beverly Hills, they tow the shit.

977
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:50,250
- We ain't got any Volvos here.
- There is a Volvo here. I know it.

978
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:51,750
- They told me--
-Just wait a minute. Wait. Wait.

979
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,790
What I'm tryin' to tell you is,
there ain't no Volvos here.

980
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,970
Then get in your book, do something.
Find my damn Volvo!

981
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,930
Sphinx. Sway.

982
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,310
It's got to be somewhere in there.
Check it out, man.

983
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,230
Wait, wait. It's not-- Nothing here.
There's nothing here. Look.

984
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,860
- So, man-- No! No! Uh-uh!
- Look, there's another one back here.

985
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,440
Hey, hey, hey, tell you what.
Look at this. Look at her. Look at her.

986
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:21,150
She's a brickhouse

987
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,080
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't even need to be out here.

988
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:37,050
Hey, uh, I got a midget
pagin' me right now.

989
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:39,300
-Wait, wait--
-I gotta get out of here. Time is money.

990
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:43,510
This is the worst damn day of my life !

991
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:53,060
''Detective Castlebeck,
Glass shards from the warehouse...

992
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:57,570
from a black light bulb available
at any local hardware store.''

993
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:03,950
All right, what the hell
is a black light bulb...

994
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,910
doin' in a warehouse in Long Beach?

995
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,170
Come with me.

996
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,680
- See this glass right here?
- Let me guess. Black light?

997
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:30,350
Black light. Take that wall.
I'll take this wall.

998
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,100
- Remember the '70s?
- Too young, thank God.

999
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:36,860
Black lights were
all the rage back then.

1000
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:40,530
You know, they had this ink,
these magic markers.

1001
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:42,700
Only show up under black light.

1002
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:47,530
So ifyou got a whole lot of information
that you don't want anybody to have--

1003
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:52,710
- Like a shopping list ofcars?
- There you go. Whoa!

1004
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:55,420
Yes! Yes!

1005
01:20:55,580 --> 01:21:00,130
- Here is our list.
- That's a big list.

1006
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,510
- We can't handle all these cars.
- Maybe we don't have to.

1007
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:08,140
I tell you what--
Let's concentrate on the rarest ones,
and let'sjust hope for some luck.

1008
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:10,270
Let's get somebody
on these right here.

1009
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:14,100
You and I will take this one
right here, '67 Shelby Mustang.

1010
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:16,190
- Can't be but a few of these in town.
- Yeah.

1011
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,360
But how do you know
he hasn't already stolen it?

1012
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,740
Oh, if I know our boy, I believe

1052
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,150
Yeah, but Mirror and Sphinx

1053
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,360

- What about Kip and Tumbler?
- No word yet.

1057
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:00,170
Lost in suburbia.
Hell, where are we?

1058
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:02,250
- What do you mean,
you don't know where you're goin'?
- Which way is out?

1059
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:04,130
I don't know where I am.
Everything looks the same to me.

1060
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,130
- Which way?
- You don't know where you're going?

1061
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:10,100
- That is a cop.

1062
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:12,470
- Slow down. Slow down.
- He's pulling a U-turn.

1063
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:16,980
Oh, man, we're in big trouble.

1064
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:22,610

- Oh, shit!

1066
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:33,790
Go!

1067
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:39,670
- Kip!
- Oh, man!

1068
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:42,500

1069
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:45,380
- I need some help, man.

1070
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:48,340
- He's been shot! Oh, shit!
- Don't touch me!

1071
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,180
Shit! Dude,

1072
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:53,100
-People ask questions in hospitals, Kip.
-Go to the hospital!

1073
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:56,020
- Kip, use your head.
We're in a stolen car!
- Oh, man!

1074
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:59,810
- Oh, man! Don't move, man!

1075
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:03,070
You're gonna be all right!
You're gonna be all right!

1076
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,780
- Oh, man!
- What happened?
- We ran into security patrol, man.

1077
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:10,950
He hid in the van.
We didn't know he was there.

1078
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,410
We gotta get you to a doctor.
Private. I knowjust where to go.

1079
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,830

1080
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:18,000
Shit.

1081
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:21,750
Just lie in the back.
Lie down in the back.

1082
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,380
Tumbler, you and Kip

1083
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,840
- You all right?
- Yeah. Go.

1084
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:32,390
- What are you doin'?
- I'm goin' with him.

1085
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:39,230
- Ifsomething should go wrong, just--
- Let's go!

1086
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:42,310
I-I'll take care of him, man.

1087
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:47,900
Let's fi nish this.

1088

Let's go to Long Beach.

1094
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:53,640
I know we got a history,
Eleanor...

1095
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,560
and that that history has not
been great, but I promise...

Shit.

1098
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:31,680
The easy way or the hard way, Raines.
Easy way or the hard way?

1099
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:46,020
- Hey!

1100
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:50,650

1103
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:16,470

1118
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:42,560
This is anA-Star, sir,
not anApache.

1119
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:46,730
150! 160! He's gone.

1120
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,360
- God!
- Man, this guy can drive!

1121
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,940
- What? What?
- It's probably mostly the car.

1122
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,700
Hey, what time is it?

1123
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,790
7:30.

1124
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:08,130
I think I'm gonna have to get you
out oftown or something.

1125
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:12,760
Your brother's the best boost
in the world, but I don't know
if he's gonna make this one.

1126
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:19,680
Uh, I'm not like my brother, you know?
I just don't abandon my friends.

1127
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:22,520
Oh, man, I ought to
smackyou silly, boy.

1128
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:29,730
You thinkyour brother ran away?
Is that what you think?
You better get your story straight.

1129
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:36,200
Well, go on then.
Straighten it out.

1130
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,200
Your mother told him to go.

1131
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:43,370
She knew if Memphis stayed,
you were gonna walk his line.

1132
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:47,580
You were gonna join his crew,
and she told him to pick up and go.

1133
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:51,710
And he did, thinkin'
it was best foryou.

1134
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:55,760
He left all of us, foryou.

1135
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:59,430
Guess it wasn't that big a deal
for him though really.

1136
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:04,180
Wasn't that big a sacrifi ce, leavin'
everything he'd ever known behind.

1137
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:09,860
And six years later, ain't life grand?
You became a car boost anyway.

1138
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,070
How about that?

1139
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:16,240
I sedated him. He's sleeping.
He's gonna bejust fi ne.

1140
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:49,600
It'sjust a scratch, Eleanor.
It can be fi xed.

1141
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:51,690
No, no, no, don't.
Don't-- Don't do this to me.

1142
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:54,860
Don't-- Don't start with me.
Don't-- No, don't do-- No, no, start!

1143
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:57,450
Start, start.
Come on. Come on.

1144
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:04,580
I need you, Eleanor.
I need you now, now. Yes!

at the end of this bridge.

1147
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:22,510
- There he is. There he is!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1148
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:25,640
I got you, Raines!
I got you, boy!

1149
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:32,440
That's it! Keep it comin'!

1150
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:50,880
Whoa! Shit! Shit!

1151
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:54,380

1156
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,710
Take it up!

1157
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:43,010
One-Baker-eleven, he's at the end
of the pier turning toward you.

1158
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:47,980
Wait! Hang on! Hang on to it!

1159
01:36:55,570 --> 01:36:57,320
Hey!

1160
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:11,830
Hey!

1161
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:15,920
Whoa! Shit!

1162
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:27,770
- Whoa!
- Hey!

1163
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:31,020
- Hey!
- Move! Move!

1164
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:51,330
Is he okay?

1165
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,880
- How ya doin'? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1166
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,670
Are you okay?Just sit back.
You all right?

1167
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:59,720
- I think so.
- Are you sure?
'Cause you just went through a wall.

1168
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,090
Long Beach To wer, this is LAPD Air One
in pursuit ofsuspect.

1169
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:05,180
Requesting permission
to cross airfield.

1170
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:10,440
Negative, Air One. lncoming aircraft
on approach. Holdyourposition.

1171
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:15,480
l repeat!
Do not enter airport airspace!

1172
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:22,110
Hey!

1173
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:33,580
- Ready to go.
- Yeah. Lieutenant.

1174
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:38,000
We're done. Wait up.

1175
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:42,840
That one's got a broken leg.

1176
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,990
There he is. There he is!

1177
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,670
Get out of the car, man!

1178
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:20,510
Raines!

1179
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:07,220
Yeah, bring me two more.

1180
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:11,480
- Where's, uh-- Where's Memphis?
- I don't know, man.

1181
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,980
- He's not backyet.
- What do you mean, he's not backyet?

1182
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:17,730
It's 8:00.

1183
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:24,360
- Atley.
- Time's up, Atley.

1184
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:27,120
I've got 49 cars.
That's one less than required.

1185
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,700
- Bring the kid, and we'll settle this.
- What kid is that?

1186
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:33,830
Oh, you know, the Cincinnati Kid. Billy
the Kid. Which kid do you think I mean?

1187
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,460
Oh, gee, I don't know.
I think that maybe you mean Kip Raines.

1188
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,590
Well, gee, l think you're right.

1189
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:43,760
Yeah, well,
you know, it's a funny thing.
The little son of a bitch evaded me.

1190
01:40:43,930 --> 01:40:46,890
- Find him, Atley.
- Well, what if I can't find him?

1191
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:49,890
Then big brother takes the fa ll for
the slip-up. Doesn't matter much to me.

1192
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:53,980
One Raines is as good as another.
It never rains, but it pours.

1193
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:59,400
Son ofa-- God--Just-- Well, you know,
I think you can thank your big brother.

1194
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:03,200
I think hejust took your place
under the guillotine.

1195
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,790
Sorry, mate.
We're all done here.

1196
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:18,790
- No, we're not done. This is number 50.
- You're late.

1197
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:24,090
So sod off. You got a problem with that,
take it up with Calitri.

1198
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:44,530
- You're late.
- Wait. Wait.

1199
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:48,070
You're gonna argue with me
over 1 2 minutes?

1200
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:51,040
I just stole 50 cars foryou
in one night. All right?

1201
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:56,540
I'm a little tired, I'm a little wired,
and I think I deserve
a little appreciation.

1202
01:41:56,670 --> 01:41:59,170
I said 50 cars, not 49 and a half.

1203
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:01,380
Forty-nine and a half?
She's not so bad, man.

1204
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:06,470
She's got, what, you know, a li--
some paint and, uh--

1205
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:09,300
You know, some fi breglass.
Yes, indeedy, you know.

1206
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:12,680
And the book on her is 60, 70.
Call it 80.

1207
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:16,520
So you take 80-- All right?
You subtract it from 200.

1208
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:21,780
All right? And we make a deal. You
take 80 from 200, and we call it even.

1209
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:24,900
- Done.
- All right. Good.

1210
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:28,870
-And this thing with my brother is over.
-It's over.

1211
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:32,330
It's done. It's fi nished.

1212
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:34,410
Done. Finished.

1213
01:42:41,550 --> 01:42:45,420
Nobody insults me.
Nobody puts a gun to me head.

1214
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:50,430
Kill him. Shred the car.

1215
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:04,150
All right,
where's Raymond Calitri's place?

1216
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:07,070
Exeter Salvage and Steel.
It's on the water. Why? Are we goin'?

1217
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,700
Because, you know, Homicide specifi cally
ordered us not to interfe re.

1218
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:12,120
To hell with Homicide.

1219
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:31,470
- Unicorn.
- What?

1220
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,930
Nothing.

1221
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:43,150
So, where would you like it, sir?
In the head, or in the chest?

1222
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:46,070
- The chest.
- My pleasure.

1223
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:49,570
Hey, wait a minute, fe llas. Hold it.
Big change of plans here.

1224
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:52,240
- That's fa r enough, Atley.
- Wh-What are you doing?

1225
01:43:52,410 --> 01:43:55,500
- No, no, no.
- I said stop there, Atley.

1226
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:58,620
No, no. Calitri just sent me up here
to askyou a question.

1227
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:13,470
- All right? Everything's gonna
be all right. We got it covered.
- Get my brother out of here.

1228
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:17,230
Hey.

1229
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:22,940
You made a mistake picking a kid
to do your dirty work.

1230
01:44:23,110 --> 01:44:25,650
Made an even bigger mistake
picking my kid brother.

1231
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:29,490
And now you just made the biggest
mistake tryin' to kill me.

1232
01:44:34,330 --> 01:44:36,080
- No. Be careful with that.
- This?

1233
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:39,290
-Just put it down.
- That's right.
You got a thing about wood.

1234
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:41,750
Just put it down.

1235
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:46,170
- No. No! No!
- I'm-- I'm--

1236
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:48,800
- No!
- Oh, no! No.

1237
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:11,240
Go!

1238
01:45:30,010 --> 01:45:33,050
- Psst!
- I'm good.

1239
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,960
God!Jesus!

1240
01:46:43,290 --> 01:46:45,380
God!

1241
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:50,010
- Who are you?
- I'm a police offi cer.

1242
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:52,220
- Hey, you don't wanna do that, now.
- Yeah, I do.

1243
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:55,930
Listen to me. You walk out of here
with me, you got some options.

1244
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:58,890
You kill me-- Now you think about this.
I'm a police offi cer.

1245
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:02,060
- Your life will be over.
- No, you've got that
the wrong way around.

1246
01:47:02,230 --> 01:47:04,230
If I kill you, your life's over.

1247
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:06,860
Not all bad, though.
Funeral will be on the telly.

1248
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:10,570
Everybody out there pressed and dressed.
Guard of honour.

1249
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:14,740
Twenty-one gun salute and the Stars
and Stripes draped all overyour coffi n.

1250
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:17,040
It'll be the greatest day
of your life.

1251
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:50,740
Here I am smack-dab in the middle
of a moral dilemma, Randall.

1252
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:55,410
You've torn this town to shreds
with that little escapade of yours,
you and your Eleanor.

1253
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:59,410
But I understand
what brought you back here.

1254
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:03,580
A brother's love is a brother's love.

1255
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:09,210
You saved my life, didn't you?

1256
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:14,010
- So, what am I gonna do?
- It's your call, Detective.

1257
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:19,430
Get out of here, Randall.
I'll clean this up.

1258
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:25,610
Go, Randall, before
I change my mind. Go.

1259
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:33,070
Oh, um, there's a container ship
at pier 1 4.

1260
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,240
You might wanna check it out.

1261
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:49,800
Oh. Look here.
Can a good-lookin', hard-workin' chef
get a beer around here?

1262
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:53,840
Come on, Tumbler. You ain't doin'
nothin'. Hand me a beer, baby.

1263
01:48:54,010 --> 01:48:58,060
All right, Memphis, guys. Food!
Thankyou, sir.

1264
01:48:58,220 --> 01:49:00,560
Damn.

1265
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:02,810
- Ow. Ow.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1266
01:49:02,980 --> 01:49:06,480
Poor Toby, man. Sure looks
like he's in a lot of pain.

1267
01:49:06,650 --> 01:49:09,780
Hey, ifthat's pain,
you can shoot me anytime.

1268
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:11,990
Sexy, sassy.

1269
01:49:13,570 --> 01:49:17,950
If his unpleasant wounding has in
some way enlightened the rest ofyou...

1270
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:21,580
as to the grim fi nish below
the glossy veneer of criminal life...

1271
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:24,500
and inspired you to change your ways...

1272
01:49:24,670 --> 01:49:29,670
then his injuries carry with it an
inherent nobility and a supreme glory.

1273
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,720
We should all be so fortunate.

1274
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:36,760
You say, ''Poor Toby.''
I say, ''Poor us.''

1275
01:49:39,310 --> 01:49:41,230
- He spoke.
- Yeah.

1276
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:44,520
Hey, man, I thought
you were from Long Beach.

1277
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:48,440
Hey, Memphis. Hey.

1278
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:53,780
- I have something foryou.
- What is this?

1279
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:56,870
Open it.

1280
01:49:57,030 --> 01:50:00,750
Keys. Keys are good.
What do I do with them?

1281
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:04,620
Hey, everybody.
Everybody inside here. Let's go.

1282
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:06,830
Everybody come on.
Let's go!

1283
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,090
Ladies and gentlemen...

1284
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:14,090
it's my great pleasure to present--

1285
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:17,220
- Oh, man. Oh, man! What?
- There you go. Eleanor.

1286
01:50:17,390 --> 01:50:20,680
- What? It's Eleanor.
- Look at his fa ce.

1287
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:23,600
All yours.

1288
01:50:23,770 --> 01:50:28,320
Now it's a heap, but, uh,
give me a couple of weeks and it'll
look like a streamlined butterfly.

1289
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:35,110
- You didn't--
- Oh, no, no, no, no. I--

1290
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:38,700
I, uh, I parted the chopper out
for that.

1291
01:50:38,870 --> 01:50:40,870
I'm blown away.

1292
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,410
You bought me a car.

1293
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:49,750
Well, yeah, you know,
it'sjust a token of, of my appreciation
for, uh, for everything, you know.

1294
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:57,220
That's right. That's the way
it should be. That's the way
it should be. That's right.

1295
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:03,560
- Yeah.
- Why don't you get in there
and go for a ride?

1296
01:51:03,730 --> 01:51:06,310
I know what you did.

1297
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,560
And I thankyou.

1298
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:11,280
I'll see you later, man.

1299
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:16,070
