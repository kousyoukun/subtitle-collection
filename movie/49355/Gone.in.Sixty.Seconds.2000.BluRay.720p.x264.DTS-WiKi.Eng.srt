1
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:28,619
<i>Corner of Wiltern
and Wetherly.</i>

2
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:32,621
Tumbler messed up.
He said the Porsche should be...

3
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,784
<i>at the corner
of Wiltern and Wetherly.</i>

4
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,090
<i>- It's right there.
- You're bullshittin' me, right?</i>

5
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:40,859
- 9024 Wiltern?
- What? That?

6
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:43,197
I gotta get my tool.

7
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:46,465
Kip! He ain't
bullshittin'.

8
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:52,437
<i>Kip! That's not a tool.
That's a damn brick!</i>

9
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:56,641
Kip, man, we gonna use a brick, man, we might
as well call a prison and make reservations.

10
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:59,275
<i>Ah, come on.</i>

11
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,988
Get the number.

12
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:09,020
42850.

13
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:11,790
<i>Hurry up, man.</i>

14
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:14,491
<i>Man, let's go!</i>

15
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:18,827
Let's get the hell
outta here.

16
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:22,135
Okay, Billy Badass,
you got us in here.

17
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,732
Now tell me how the hell
we gonna get out.

18
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,802
Oh, no. I know you ain't gonna do
what I think you're gonna do.

19
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:30,848
- Oh, man!
- Come on!

20
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:35,681
<i>- This ain't The Dukes of Hazzard.
- Come on!</i>

21
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,005
Yo, so check out my new move.
I call it "The Stranger."

22
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:58,304
What I do is, I sit on my hand
for like 15, 20 minutes...

23
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:01,744
<i>until it goes numb,
no feeling at all.</i>

24
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,281
And then... I rub one out.

25
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:06,180
The Stranger, huh?

26
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:09,880
It's like a little boys' nursery
school I've come upon here.

27
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:13,253
Where are they?

28
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:19,158
<i>- You want it? All right.
- Hey.</i>

29
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,064
<i>- Leave those people alone.
- Oh, my God. Sweetie, you're so talented.</i>

30
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:26,036
- Wha... Hey, hey. Stolen car. Stolen car.
- I know. I know.

31
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:28,368
Hey, I love you.

32
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:36,038
Man, we goin' to jail, man!

33
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:38,480
Come on!

34
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:46,819
Keep your hands behind your back.
You have the right to remain silent.

35
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:49,417
Hey, watch it!

36
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,494
We have a silver Porsche.
Estimated speed: 80 miles per hour.

37
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:58,400
Heading west on Wilshire Boulevard.

38
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,268
<i>This is Air One. We have a visual
of the suspect southbound...</i>

39
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,173
<i>on Vincent Thomas Bridge.</i>

40
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:12,241
<i>- Something wrong, Tumbler?
- Yeah, I'm missing Jerry Springer.</i>

41
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:18,245
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

42
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:26,320
That's right, that's right,
that's right, that's right!

43
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,727
What's up, old man?

44
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:34,465
She'll go zero to 60
in 5.2 seconds.

45
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:37,167
<i>Believe me,
I can vouch for that.</i>

46
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:40,837
<i>Ground units be advised, suspects last
seen entering south side of warehouse.</i>

47
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:44,370
Thirteen down, thirty-seven to go.

48
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:53,217
- What the hell is that?
- What is that, man?

49
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,021
- Now you've gone and done it, Raines.
- Tumbler!

50
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:58,358
<i>- Get the board and get the lights!
- I got it, I got it!</i>

51
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,660
This is bullshit.
It's not comin' off!

52
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:02,996
<i>- Keys! Get the keys!
- I got 'em. I got 'em!</i>

53
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:06,094
<i>Come on, everybody!
Let's go! Hurry up!</i>

54
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,402
<i>- I got it!
- Let's go! Toby, get it!</i>

55
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:12,739
<i>- Let's go, boys!
- Come on, come on! I got the light!</i>

56
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:15,575
Go, go, go!
Let's go!

57
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:19,444
Shit!

58
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:35,564
<i>Get the VIN number on that?</i>

59
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:38,762
<i>- I got it.
- We've got a lamp shade by a truck.</i>

60
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:42,034
What do we got?

61
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:44,974
All gone. We didn't get
a single one of 'em.

62
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:47,671
And we are talking
about professionals.

63
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:52,012
No visible damage to locking mechanisms,
steering columns or ignitions.

64
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,211
And, as you can see,
these are not Honda Civics.

65
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:58,051
This is one of three
brand-new Mercedes,

66
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:01,718
a car they say
is unstealable.

67
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:04,887
Yeah, unless you get
the laser-cut transponder key...

68
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:07,454
sent directly to the U.S.
Dealer from Hamburg.

69
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:10,023
They got somebody
working on the inside.

70
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:14,902
- Find out which dealership sold them, serviced them, etc., etc.
- Yeah, I'll get on it.

71
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:19,136
- Mr. Drycoff?
- Yeah?

72
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:23,614
Let's impound these cars for one month. I
don't give a damn if they belong to Tom Cruise.

73
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:54,470
<i>Control, vision, determination.</i>

74
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:57,845
These are the three
fundamental components...

75
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,783
of the new generation
race car driver.

76
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:04,151
Speed is a byproduct.
Going fast.

77
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:09,250
But remember: The car is you,
you are the car.

78
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:13,330
Okay? Let's ride!

79
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:21,768
Billy, you just shaved
one second off your lap time!

80
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,480
Tommy, I don't know what
that was, but it wasn't driving.

81
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:44,262
Go get 'em!

82
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:55,973
Well, well, well. What do you pay
your pit crews with?

83
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,737
Oreos and Gummy Bears?

84
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,247
I folded, Atley. You know that.
What are you doing here?

85
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:05,909
- Is there someplace we can talk?
- About what?

86
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:08,043
About your brother
and the deep shit he's in.

87
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:12,283
Frank, can you watch
the kids for a minute?

88
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:21,198
Tell me about Kip.

89
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,996
He took a job,
and he fumbled it.

90
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:27,197
Now he's jammed up.
He's jammed up bad.

91
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:32,175
- What kind of job?
- A boost. A big boost.

92
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:34,609
A boost?

93
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:40,376
What's Kip doing on a boost?

94
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:42,750
Oh, you're shittin' me, man.

95
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:45,949
Kip's become quite
the little crew runner since you left.

96
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,515
You don't talk to your ma?

97
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:51,027
She neglected to mention it.

98
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:53,826
Listen, I need something.

99
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:56,196
I-I need something
cold to drink.

100
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:59,566
I thought we were goin'
someplace to talk.

101
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:09,237
- Who was the job for?
- A new guy named Raymond Calitri.

102
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:12,112
They call him
"The Carpenter."

103
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:15,380
He's runnin' all the dark
ponies down there now.

104
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:19,822
It's a full-on "Devil came
down to Long Beach" trip.

105
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:23,884
He's bad.
He's real bad.

106
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:27,762
And this Calitri is the one
who's after my brother?

107
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:29,800
Like stains on a mattress.

108
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:34,267
And you should know...
I work for him.

109
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:42,077
There weren't a lot of opportunities
for retired car thieves on the gimp.

110
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:45,139
He put me to work.

111
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:50,745
I-I gotta tell you, Memphis, this guy,
he scares the shit out of even me.

112
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:15,341
What are you doin', man?

113
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:19,975
Stop! Stop!

114
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:26,884
Atley Jackson.

115
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,724
<i>Got it. They have Kip.</i>

116
00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:33,059
Take me there.

117
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:04,519
Raymond Calitri,
Memphis Raines.

118
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:06,826
I try...

119
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:10,425
to learn your ways,
understand your obsessions.

120
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:14,268
<i>But this baseball...
it's so bleeding boring, isn't it?</i>

121
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,671
Where's my brother?

122
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:21,770
Memphis Raines,
your legend precedes you.

123
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:24,212
Atley tells me
you're the best.

124
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:28,048
<i>After you left, auto theft in the
South Bay area went down 47 percent.</i>

125
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:30,713
Where's my brother?

126
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,490
<i>I'm proud of these. Straddle chair
from the Arts and Crafts period.</i>

127
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:39,121
Mahogany table
with cloud-lift pattern.

128
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:42,291
Black walnut wine table.
Metal's cold, ugly.

129
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:46,827
<i>Wood's warm, clean,
provided by nature.</i>

130
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:51,467
See a piece of furniture take shape,
it's like watching a child grow.

131
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:54,944
I asked you a question.

132
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:57,914
They threw us out of England,
threw us out of France,

133
00:13:57,982 --> 00:14:00,450
but here we are,
flourishing really,

134
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:05,217
except for the minor inconvenience of
despising everything about your country.

135
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,316
On this list you'll find
50 cars... five-zero.

136
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:14,127
I need all 50 delivered to Long Beach Harbor,
pier 14 by 8:00 a.m. Four days from now.

137
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,167
I'm paying $200,000.

138
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,759
I'm not interested.
I'm just here for my brother.

139
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:22,364
Young Kip came to me.
He had street cred.

140
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,409
The brother of the notorious
Memphis Raines.

141
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:29,173
So two weeks ago I hired him
and advanced him $10,000.

142
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:33,684
Atley told me. If it's about the
advance, I can understand your anger.

143
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:39,246
The debt has to be settled.
Ten grand, from me to you.

144
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:43,021
- I wish it was that easy.
- I don't see the complication.

145
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:46,291
I have four days to deliver 50 cars,
and I have no cars.

146
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:50,027
- Well, that's another problem.
- It is another problem, isn't it?

147
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:54,367
It's about me delivering 50 top-end cars
because I said I would.

148
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:58,068
Because if I don't, my South American
friend goes somewhere else from now on.

149
00:14:58,142 --> 00:15:00,576
And that's not good.
It's a humiliation.

150
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:02,943
Because I'm the asshole
who said I could deliver.

151
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:05,539
Am I an asshole?
Do I look like an asshole?

152
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:09,018
Yeah.

153
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:13,887
- I need that paper satisfied.
- I'm retired.

154
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,155
And where the hell
is my brother?

155
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,057
I made this as well.

156
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:27,229
My first one.

157
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:46,884
It takes 80,000 pounds
of pressure to crush a car.

158
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:59,927
- Kip?
- Who's that?

159
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:03,371
- Memphis.
- Oh, shit.

160
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,170
You okay?

161
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:11,843
Shut it off!

162
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,749
<i>- Turn it off!
- You've got 30 seconds to consider your options.</i>

163
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:17,788
- Shut it off!
- One: You kill me; they kill you.

164
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:20,221
Your brother dies anyway.

165
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,590
Two: You lie, you accept the job,
you take your brother, you run.

166
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:27,188
I hunt you down, I kill you, I kill
your brother, and I kill your mother...

167
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,756
for the aggravation
you've caused me.

168
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:33,133
<i>Three: You accept the deal,
you steal some cars,</i>

169
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:35,399
you make some money
and you be a big brother.

170
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:47,649
<i>- Memphis!
- 8:00 a.m. Friday morning.</i>

171
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:50,916
The cars are on the boat,
or your brother's in the coffin.

172
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:54,322
<i>Get me outta here!
Somebody get me outta here.</i>

173
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:04,524
<i>Listen, you really don't
have to make me anything.</i>

174
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:06,763
Oh, hey, you come down here.

175
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:08,965
You saved my ass.
It's the least I can do.

176
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:15,972
Hey, I heard you were, uh, pumping gas
someplace up North or something, right?

177
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:18,607
- Yeah, working with kids.
- Oh, really?

178
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:26,917
"First place."
I remember this.

179
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:30,984
Oh, yeah, that was...
that was a long time ago.

180
00:17:40,838 --> 00:17:42,897
What'd you put in it?

181
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:45,636
I don't know.

182
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:52,349
It's good.

183
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:59,282
Ow. Ow. Oh, God.

184
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:03,157
Does Mom know
about any of this?

185
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:06,685
No, no, no, she doesn't,
and I don't think she should.

186
00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:09,790
You know, she... she works
really hard, and this... this...

187
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:12,631
She doesn't need to know
about any of this stuff.

188
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:16,002
Look, you know,
I got everything under control.

189
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:18,542
Kitchen's on fire.

190
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:24,647
Uh, man.

191
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:36,051
Hey, Memphis.

192
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:38,459
It's good to see you.

193
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:45,328
<i>Haul the cartons over there!</i>

194
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:48,270
<i>- Hey, Fuzzy.
- Aw, shit. What are you doin' here?</i>

195
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:52,833
- I told you I don't know anything.
- Yeah, but you're a liar.

196
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,812
- You're gonna get me fired, man.
- Fired? That's not good. You're on parole, right?

197
00:18:56,881 --> 00:19:00,044
Fuzzy, hey, nobody
wants to get you fired.

198
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:03,019
We just need this
information is all.

199
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:06,352
Two weeks ago, a call came in
for a lot of top-end cars.

200
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:09,393
- And who made that call?
- I don't have a clue.

201
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,190
- Okay. We should go talk to your boss.
- Oh, shhh.

202
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:15,562
The delivery date.
I know the delivery date.

203
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:18,101
- And when is that?
- Thursday, Friday, end of the week.

204
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,036
Well, you get me a name
within 48 hours, or we'll be back.

205
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:23,039
Good to see you, buddy.

206
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:25,041
Thank you.

207
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:32,376
I'm looking
for Helen Raines.

208
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,509
<i>Helen, some guy's
here for you.</i>

209
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:36,780
What guy?
What's he look like?

210
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:39,414
Like a firecracker.
Like your son.

211
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,788
You look so good.

212
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:45,226
Thank you, Momma. Here.
Spring... Spring bouquet.

213
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:47,856
What are you doing here?

214
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:51,527
Well, uh, Atley Jackson
came to see me.

215
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:53,729
Told me something about Kip.

216
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:56,466
Can I help you
with one of these?

217
00:19:59,577 --> 00:20:02,637
<i>Okay, that's yours.</i>

218
00:20:02,713 --> 00:20:06,809
Tell Castlebeck he's not gonna believe
who just walked into the Quality Cafe.

219
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:09,944
I can't say I'm surprised.

220
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:13,787
All his life he looked up to you,
tried to be you.

221
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,952
I guess now he is.

222
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:20,259
So why is this happening?
I send you guys money.

223
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:24,665
He... He met some people,
and he changed.

224
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:29,331
He lost that...
that sweetness, you know?

225
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:36,278
Okay... tell me.
How deep in is he?

226
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:38,406
Deep.

227
00:20:38,482 --> 00:20:41,280
Can you get him out?

228
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:46,348
It means doin' things,

229
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:49,655
things I told you
I'd never do again.

230
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:52,753
Do what it takes, Randall.

231
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:06,702
<i>When did you get into town, Raines?</i>

232
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:09,507
- Last night.
- Last night? What for?

233
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,912
I thought I'd catch a Lakers game.
Heard we got Shaquille.

234
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:15,077
Guys wanna go?

235
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:19,316
- Guess not.
- Randall, Randall, Randall, come here.

236
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,291
I get this call from this
uniform, you know?

237
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,124
Axton. Very nice man.
Remembers everything.

238
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:28,324
This man calls me up, says, "Guess
who's back in town?" I say, "Who?"

239
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:31,835
<i>He says, "Randall Raines."
I say, "Randall Raines the car thief?"</i>

240
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:34,132
He says, "Yeah." I say, "Impossible."
He says, "No, he's back."

241
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:37,800
I say, "No, he's not." He says, "Yes, I
will bet you $200 I just saw Randall Raines."

242
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,311
<i>- You guys said a lot. Look, Detective...
- No, whoa, whoa.</i>

243
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:44,314
What's really, really
ironic about this...

244
00:21:44,382 --> 00:21:48,011
Two nights ago we snare these
13 fresh stolens waiting for export.

245
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:52,545
At the time I'm thinking,
"This feels like Randall Raines."

246
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:55,649
Now, it didn't have your
panache, your, uh, flash,

247
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:58,923
but it just felt
like Randall Raines.

248
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:01,021
<i>And now here you are.</i>

249
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:04,659
Look, I don't know what you boys are
looking for, but I just got back, okay?

250
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:07,397
It was a family emergency.
Now, that's the truth.

251
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:10,838
Family emergency. Yeah, I got
a family emergency too, Randall.

252
00:22:10,908 --> 00:22:15,004
I gotta go tell my woman
that I just lost $200 on a stupid deal.

253
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:18,071
- Mmm, she's mean.
- What?

254
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:21,846
She can be mean.

255
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,479
Come here.
Come here, Randall.

256
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:28,218
Take those glasses off, Randall.
Please, do me a favor.

257
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,161
Six years ago you make
a real smart move, you know?

258
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,563
You retire from a life that's gonna get
you busted or killed or maybe even both.

259
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:40,502
And I'm thinkin' that not putting
you away when I had a chance...

260
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:45,372
is like this big bug up the ass of this
real impressive career that I've had.

261
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:47,377
Oh, yeah.

262
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:51,575
Well, without disappointment,
you can't appreciate victory.

263
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:53,776
Eleanor tell you that?

264
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:55,876
Now, that's hittin'
below the belt.

265
00:22:55,953 --> 00:22:58,513
Yeah, all right, let me tell you
about below the belt, Randall.

266
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:01,615
From here on out, if you walk across
the street outside of a crosswalk,

267
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:04,126
if you roll
through a stop sign,

268
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:07,426
if you use an aerosol can in
a manner other than directed...

269
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:10,126
I mean, I don't care,
you make one slip,

270
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:12,396
and I will put you away
for good.

271
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,995
<i>- Okay.
- By the time you get out, asshole,</i>

272
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:17,233
there won't even be cars.

273
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:21,142
We'll all be cruising around
in your little, vroom, spaceships.

274
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:24,010
That's gonna suck.

275
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,284
Who's Eleanor?

276
00:23:28,352 --> 00:23:30,286
It's a damn car.

277
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:33,619
And don't ever
talk about my wife.

278
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,430
Excuse me.
You know where Otto is?

279
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,596
He's in the back, in the paint shop.

280
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:59,448
Is that you? About time
you came to see me.

281
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:01,382
- I missed you.
- Good to see you!

282
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:04,352
You look great.

283
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:07,357
- It's good to see you.
- You too. Oh, remember my Junie?

284
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,154
Hey, Junie.
How are you?

285
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:11,786
- We're doin' good, thank you.
- Good, good.

286
00:24:11,862 --> 00:24:14,296
You look happy.

287
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,560
Well, I am happy.
I really am.

288
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:18,568
So what happened here?

289
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:20,627
- What do you mean?
- Well, it's nice.

290
00:24:20,704 --> 00:24:24,367
But the chop shop,
the stripped cars, my education.

291
00:24:24,442 --> 00:24:27,377
What happened? Hey.

292
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:29,709
Old age happened.
That's what happened.

293
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,077
Got tired of killing 'em.

294
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:33,582
You know, I woke up
one morning and thought,

295
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:36,711
"I'm no longer a destroyer.
I'm a means of resurrection."

296
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:39,255
Now we restore,
we revive.

297
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:41,723
<i>Come here.
Remember we used to do this?</i>

298
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:45,523
- What?
- You know. Come here. Okay.

299
00:24:45,596 --> 00:24:48,895
It's a Ferrari 365 GTB-4 Daytona.

300
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:52,060
Le Mans, 1971.

301
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:53,899
<i>- Five cam...
- That's a V-12.</i>

302
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:56,201
V-12, right, right,
right, right!

303
00:24:56,273 --> 00:25:00,869
Here it peaks
at 5,500 r.p.m.!

304
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:03,914
- What do you know about Raymond Calitri?
- Who?

305
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:05,710
Raymond Calitri.

306
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:10,511
Uh, excuse us, sweetness.
I'll be right back.

307
00:25:10,588 --> 00:25:12,886
- We can talk here.
- No, no, no, no, no. It's all right.

308
00:25:12,957 --> 00:25:15,084
Raymond Calitri.

309
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,028
He's a jackal tearing at the
soft belly of our... of our fair town.

310
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:24,761
And he's an asshole to boot,
so be careful.

311
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:29,704
I heard about Kip.
Are you considering a comeback tour?

312
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:33,504
- Do you think it can be done?
- Don't do this to me, okay?

313
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:36,671
Please, please not now.

314
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:41,107
<i>Oh, man.</i>

315
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:49,860
<i>- How many cars?
- Fifty.</i>

316
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:53,590
<i>- How many days?
- Three.</i>

317
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,928
How many in your crew?

318
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,436
One, but I came here
hoping to negotiate for a second.

319
00:25:59,503 --> 00:26:01,368
No way.
It can't be done.

320
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:04,930
I mean, you need time to prep,
time to shop. You know that.

321
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:07,477
It has to be.
They're gonna kill him.

322
00:26:11,682 --> 00:26:13,616
Oh, man.

323
00:26:22,192 --> 00:26:24,422
It was a mistake
to come here.

324
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:28,625
You have a great life now.
I don't want to upset that.

325
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:36,830
<i>Uh, wait a minute.
Uh, hold on.</i>

326
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:39,102
Look around you.

327
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:43,442
These days...
I'm all about second chances.

328
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:47,280
So, uh, let's make a few phone calls,
and we'll go from there, okay?

329
00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:49,842
Okay.

330
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,150
- Don't look at me!
Look at the people next to you!

331
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:56,692
That's... Turn the wheel!

332
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,491
Pull over! Pull her the hell over!

333
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:02,532
Asshole!

334
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,761
Learn how to drive!

335
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:08,771
Don't touch nothing. Just...

336
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,672
No!

337
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:15,473
You can't negotiate turns.
You can't signal properly.

338
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:20,916
You can't maintain speed. You can't
parallel park. Hell, you can't drive, honey.

339
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:23,453
Shit, I can't swim.
I know I can't.

340
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,251
So you know what I do?
I stay my black ass outta the pool.

341
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:30,259
All right now, just...

342
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,097
Can you... Oh!
Hello?

343
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:40,660
Memphis! Hey, how are you?

344
00:27:40,738 --> 00:27:45,539
Sure, sure.
When? Okay.

345
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:47,941
- 32969811.
- All right. Thanks a lot.

346
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:50,037
Donny.

347
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:54,515
Just take it around the block
a couple of times, okay?

348
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:56,883
<i>All right.</i>

349
00:28:02,493 --> 00:28:05,428
Hello. I'm calling
for Frankie Fish.

350
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:08,431
Frank's dead, man.
Yeah, he got scragged.

351
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:12,765
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, yeah, I'm looking for Henry Santoro.

352
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:15,737
He went down to Florida
with that asshole Frankie Fish.

353
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:18,070
<i>- Tell him I want my money.
- I didn't mess with your money.</i>

354
00:28:18,142 --> 00:28:20,269
Yes, ma'am. I'm looking
for Dan and Mikey.

355
00:28:20,344 --> 00:28:22,710
Both of 'em up to Chino.
Doin' a nickel apiece.

356
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,771
Now I'm not so sure
I want to tell you who this is.

357
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:28,113
- Yeah, try it, asshole.
- You sound very busy right now.

358
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:30,449
You sound very, very busy.

359
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:36,151
Whew. There's
only two names left.

360
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:39,992
Yeah? Let me see.

361
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,089
<i>Those two? No way.</i>

362
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,100
There's no one else.

363
00:28:44,168 --> 00:28:46,864
Are you sure?

364
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:50,396
- You tell him.
- Listen, why should I...

365
00:28:50,474 --> 00:28:52,669
- Come on!
- You were the one who answered the phone.

366
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:56,304
- Fine! Fine!
- But how's a guy who can't speak gonna take a phone call?

367
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,940
<i>You've got a call!</i>

368
00:29:14,732 --> 00:29:16,791
Sphinx, is that you?

369
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:19,427
Press a button if it's you.

370
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,708
Sway, you set up
this brake job?

371
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,044
<i>Yeah. He warped all four rotors.</i>

372
00:29:32,116 --> 00:29:34,550
<i>Must've been ridin' those
brakes like an old lady.</i>

373
00:29:34,618 --> 00:29:37,849
<i>- That's nice.
- Sounds like the left bank's running lean.</i>

374
00:29:49,466 --> 00:29:51,957
The service department's
over there.

375
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:55,698
- Can I talk to you?
- Talk to me? Yeah, sure, talk.

376
00:29:55,773 --> 00:30:00,142
- The thing of it is, I came back because...
- Do you know what time it is?

377
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,304
It's 5:30.
I came back because...

378
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,315
I gotta go.
I'm late for work.

379
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:11,020
You're at work.

380
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:14,023
I got two jobs.

381
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:19,893
I have discovered that you have
to work twice as hard when it's honest.

382
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,568
- Hey, Sway, can I get another shot?
- Yep.

383
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:31,130
Still lookin' amazing.

384
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,768
While you look
like a Bible salesman.

385
00:30:33,844 --> 00:30:36,278
You're healed.

386
00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:38,814
<i>Can we improvise
a little bit?</i>

387
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:41,783
Sure. What do you have in mind?
Wanna get a little crazy?

388
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:44,844
There's a Cutlass 442 in the back
we can strip down and shine the hood.

389
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:48,517
- What do you say?
- Uh, that's not what I had in mind.

390
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:50,583
No?

391
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:53,255
It's about my brother.

392
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,457
- Kip's in trouble.
- I n trouble?

393
00:30:55,532 --> 00:30:57,762
- Took a boost, and he blew it.
- Shit.

394
00:30:57,835 --> 00:31:01,601
And you got some Italians?

395
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:04,072
<i>- Five or six.
- Right.</i>

396
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:07,599
It's 50 ladies in 24 hours,
$200,000.

397
00:31:07,678 --> 00:31:10,306
Well, I've cleaned up.

398
00:31:15,052 --> 00:31:17,885
I understand. I hate
to even come here and ask...

399
00:31:17,955 --> 00:31:20,014
Sway, can I get
that drink now, please?

400
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:24,117
I had to ask a few of the others too,
and I feel bad about it, but...

401
00:31:24,194 --> 00:31:27,493
- But you had no choice. You had to come here...
- Pretty much.

402
00:31:27,564 --> 00:31:30,499
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

403
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:36,164
I'd love to help Kip,
but I-I'm not into the life anymore.

404
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:40,574
Well, that's a good thing.

405
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:44,478
- Yeah.
- I'm glad to see you're doing well.

406
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:46,743
Sorry, I can't help you.

407
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:50,309
- I'd like to pay for your drink.
- That's fine.

408
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:54,753
How about that drink?

409
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:57,419
Yeah, how about that drink?

410
00:31:58,562 --> 00:32:02,430
<i>Raines!
Memphis Raines, huh?</i>

411
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:04,524
<i>- Do I know you?
- Well, you should know me...</i>

412
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:09,061
considering all the business you done
screwed up for me in the past, baby.

413
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:11,607
- Johnny B.
- That's me.

414
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:13,643
What can I do for you?

415
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,474
Well, I'm gonna tell you
what you can do for me, baby.

416
00:32:16,546 --> 00:32:19,310
Get out of Long Beach, tonight.

417
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:21,851
I'll be gone in three days.
I'm just here on some family business.

418
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,015
Word on the street says Raymond Calitri
hired you and your brother...

419
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:29,286
for a top order, a order
that should've went to me.

420
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:32,055
That's not the way
it went down, Johnny.

421
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:48,510
Hey! Get away
from my car, asshole!

422
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,428
<i>Got somethin' to say
before I kill you, fool?</i>

423
00:33:25,716 --> 00:33:29,277
Sphinx. Otto send you?

424
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:48,896
Oh, Dad.

425
00:33:48,972 --> 00:33:52,533
We'd probably both be working
at the dealership if he hadn't died,

426
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:55,237
just like normal people.

427
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:56,973
Shit.

428
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,420
What's the matter with you?

429
00:34:04,488 --> 00:34:08,618
Eh, six years does
a lot of different things to people.

430
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:11,820
<i>You know, I don't know
where you went, but...</i>

431
00:34:11,895 --> 00:34:14,921
you know, you're in there,
you're talking about being normal...

432
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:18,126
<i>I mean, you were always the one
who was goin' after the easy money.</i>

433
00:34:22,706 --> 00:34:25,641
I didn't do it
for the money.

434
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:31,010
I did it for the cars.

435
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:35,548
Gleaming in marina blue,

436
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:38,110
sunfire yellow,

437
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:40,179
Marlboro red.

438
00:34:40,257 --> 00:34:43,954
<i>Begging to be plucked.</i>

439
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:47,827
And I'd do it.

440
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:50,731
I'd boost her...

441
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:53,793
and just blast
to Palm Springs,

442
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,431
instantly feeling better
about being me.

443
00:34:57,507 --> 00:35:01,307
<i>And then the next day,
it seems like,</i>

444
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:05,405
<i>I'm getting shot at,
my friends are dying,</i>

445
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:07,473
<i>people are going to jail.</i>

446
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:10,520
I didn't like
what I'd become.

447
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:16,657
Yeah, and then you left,

448
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:20,162
and then I didn't
have a brother anymore,

449
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,290
<i>and now you want
to give me advice...</i>

450
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:25,664
<i>and I don't even know you.</i>

451
00:35:25,735 --> 00:35:29,227
<i>And, you know, I got my own family now,
I got my own friends.</i>

452
00:35:29,306 --> 00:35:32,332
And you can say what you want
about them, but they're loyal.

453
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:38,071
Well, when you hit the wall,
the same thing's gonna happen.

454
00:35:38,148 --> 00:35:41,140
You and your family...

455
00:35:41,218 --> 00:35:44,415
<i>are either
gonna get shot...</i>

456
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:47,582
or get a five-year
jolt at Corcoran.

457
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:01,860
<i>Those Mercedes we impounded?
Need those newfangled laser-cut keys.</i>

458
00:36:01,938 --> 00:36:04,873
Each one's from Dressner Foreign Motors
downtown Newport...

459
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:07,432
where all the employees
are clean, except for him.

460
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:11,447
James Lakewood. Served a nickel
at Folsom for auto insurance fraud.

461
00:36:11,515 --> 00:36:16,782
My gosh, I bet he just neglected to mention that
to the people at Dressner Foreign Motors, huh?

462
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:19,913
It gets better. Young James there
places orders for lost keys...

463
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,585
to the Mercedes
home office in Germany.

464
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,100
The list.

465
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:35,002
The list. I guess we gotta start beating
the bushes and try to find out where they...

466
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:38,507
<i>- Whoa! 1967 Shelby GT-500.
- I know. I know.</i>

467
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:42,033
- You got Eleanor here?
- Otto, there's somebody here to see you.

468
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,374
<i>Oh, the puppy's
a big dog now!</i>

469
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:50,545
<i>- How are you doin'?
- Hey there, Kip, what is this... What's that up under there?</i>

470
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,111
Hey, Otto, how you doin'?

471
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,249
It's a long time.
Good to see you.

472
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:57,691
What are you
doin' here, Kip?

473
00:36:57,761 --> 00:37:01,219
- Well, we actually came to talk about some things.
- About what?

474
00:37:01,298 --> 00:37:04,358
Well, you know, it seems like
you guys need a little help,

475
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:06,732
<i>and we thought
that we should participate.</i>

476
00:37:06,803 --> 00:37:08,771
But I just promised Mom
I was getting you out of this.

477
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:11,068
No, no, we're talking
about a lot of money here.

478
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,974
- And if you guys think you're gonna
get into our Kool-Aid... - - What? Money?

479
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:16,877
Is that why you think I'm doing this,
you inconsiderate little punk!

480
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:20,383
If you wanna participate, well, then
you call Mom and you explain to her...

481
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:23,681
<i>Can you explain how you are gonna
steal 50 cars in two days?</i>

482
00:37:23,753 --> 00:37:27,052
Hey. Hey.

483
00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:30,058
This is why I do not
do business with family.

484
00:37:30,126 --> 00:37:32,686
I think you should
consider this.

485
00:37:32,762 --> 00:37:36,357
Oh, come on, Otto, please. No, his
criminal career has come to an end.

486
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:39,334
Well, his life will come to an end
unless we pull this off.

487
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:42,599
How can we do it without them?
It can't be done, and you know it.

488
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:48,810
You guys have
any skills at all?

489
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:51,438
- Please!
- Yeah, we have skills.

490
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:54,915
We... Mirror Man here,
he's an electronics expert.

491
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:58,352
You know, he's got some gadgets that...
that you old farts probably never heard of.

492
00:37:58,421 --> 00:38:02,323
You know, uh, Tumbler over here, he can
pretty much drive anything with wheels...

493
00:38:02,392 --> 00:38:04,758
<i>and, you know,
some things without wheels.</i>

494
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:07,763
And, uh, and Toby,
he's a computer genius.

495
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:10,800
He's... He does fascinating
things with computers.

496
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:13,700
What exactly can you do
with a computer, Toby?

497
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,761
I can hack
into the D.M.V. Mainframe.

498
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,639
<i>I can change VIN numbers.
I can change addresses, registrations.</i>

499
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:22,041
I can do a lot
of really tricky stuff. I can.

500
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:25,309
All right, all right.
We do this, we do it my way.

501
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:27,782
I run the show.
You take your orders from me.

502
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:29,944
If you have any problems
with that, you can leave now.

503
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,011
No, that's fine.
That's fine.

504
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:35,956
<i>- Well, who is Gilligan here, and what does he do?
- Gilligan is actually Freb.</i>

505
00:38:36,026 --> 00:38:38,790
- Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business.
- What?

506
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:42,491
<i>- It's true.
- Hey, people gotta eat, right?</i>

507
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:47,666
This is outrageous.
I want my lawyer.

508
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:50,763
I'm not saying a word
till I get a lawyer.

509
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,274
All right, James,
that's an option.

510
00:38:53,343 --> 00:38:55,709
And frankly,
a reasonable one.

511
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:57,713
So you call
your lawyer, James.

512
00:38:57,781 --> 00:39:00,978
You tell him you've been arrested
on suspicion of grand theft auto.

513
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:03,076
<i>- We indict you.
- He'll bail you out.</i>

514
00:39:03,153 --> 00:39:07,089
- And we move on to trial.
- Okay, okay.

515
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:11,753
A kid came to me,
said he'd pay $500 a key.

516
00:39:11,828 --> 00:39:16,697
So I put the order forms through, and
he picked 'em up a couple days later.

517
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:20,497
- What's the kid's name?
- We kept it anonymous.

518
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:26,406
He was a well-built kid.
Uh, looks like a boxer.

519
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:30,071
- What do you want me to do?
- When he comes back, you call us.

520
00:39:30,146 --> 00:39:33,877
- What says he comes back?
- A hunch.

521
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:37,509
To make the Friday 8:00 a.m. Deadline,
you're gonna have to go old school.

522
00:39:37,587 --> 00:39:41,921
A one-night boost.
Put all your nuts in one basket, okay?

523
00:39:41,991 --> 00:39:44,619
<i>- One night? What, are you crazy?
- Yes. No, I'm not crazy.</i>

524
00:39:44,694 --> 00:39:47,128
- What, do you have like a better plan or something'?
- Yeah, you spread it out.

525
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:50,223
- You play shadow games and shit.
- We're on a truncated timetable.

526
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,292
Otto, I'm sorry. Can you just listen
to me for one second, all right?

527
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,703
<i>We heard you, Kip. Shadow games.
But what you have to understand...</i>

528
00:39:56,773 --> 00:40:00,436
is that if you play shadow games, by
the second night, the heat is onto you.

529
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,071
With a one-night boost, by the time
the first car's reported stolen,

530
00:40:04,147 --> 00:40:07,446
your ship's set sail;
it's a surprise attack.

531
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:11,954
This is a complicated list,
fellas, it really is, okay?

532
00:40:12,021 --> 00:40:14,649
<i>There are 25
that aren't a problem,</i>

533
00:40:14,724 --> 00:40:16,885
but these exotics
are tough to find.

534
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,724
And the new Mercedes,
they require laser-cut keys, okay?

535
00:40:19,796 --> 00:40:23,163
- Yeah, I got that covered.
- You have that covered?

536
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:25,497
- What'd I just say? Yeah, I got it covered.
- Yeah.

537
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:28,162
All right, all right.
Well, then let's get to work.

538
00:40:28,238 --> 00:40:30,399
<i>Toby, hack into
the insurance database...</i>

539
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:32,407
<i>and find as many cars
as you can.</i>

540
00:40:32,475 --> 00:40:36,605
<i>Yes! I got addresses
on Hillary, Natalie and Tracy.</i>

541
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:40,171
<i>Donny, check the D.M.V.For
the remaining cars on the list.</i>

542
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,514
<i>I'm sorry, miss, but you've
missed five questions.</i>

543
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:45,611
<i>- That's a failing.
- No!</i>

544
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:48,054
<i>- Next.
- No! Why?</i>

545
00:40:48,124 --> 00:40:51,150
You're supposed to go faster
when somebody tailgates you.

546
00:40:51,227 --> 00:40:53,161
<i>- Ah. Hello again.
- Mm-hmm. Here's your list...</i>

547
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:56,164
of the 20 car owners' names and
addresses that you requested.

548
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:58,427
- Thank you.
- That's $100, please.

549
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:01,197
- A hundred dollars?
- Well, five dollars a car.

550
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:03,705
Twenty cars.
Would you like a calculator?

551
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:06,970
It used to be two dollars a car.
Thanks a lot.

552
00:41:07,043 --> 00:41:11,104
My name's Roger, sir.
May I be of some help?

553
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:16,584
That's funny, my name's Roger.
Two Rogers don't make a right.

554
00:41:16,653 --> 00:41:19,588
- Roger, I have a problem.
- Yes?

555
00:41:19,656 --> 00:41:22,625
I've been in L.A. For three months now.
I have money, I have taste.

556
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:24,819
But I'm not
on anybody's "A" list,

557
00:41:24,894 --> 00:41:27,829
and Saturday night is the
loneliest night of the week for me.

558
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:30,991
- Oh. A Ferrari would certainly change that.
- Perhaps. Mmm.

559
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:34,002
But, you know, this is the one.
Yes, yes, yes.

560
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,836
I saw three of these parked outside
the local Starbucks this morning,

561
00:41:37,907 --> 00:41:39,841
which tells me
only one thing.

562
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:44,209
There's too many self-indulgent wieners
in this city with too much bloody money!

563
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,215
Now, if I was driving...

564
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:51,652
a 1967275 GTB four-cam...

565
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:54,656
You would not be
a self-indulgent weiner, sir.

566
00:41:54,724 --> 00:41:57,158
- You'd be a connoisseur.
- Precisely.

567
00:41:57,227 --> 00:41:59,422
Champagne would fall
from the heavens.

568
00:41:59,496 --> 00:42:02,329
Doors would open.
Velvet ropes would part.

569
00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:04,696
I don't have one here,

570
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:07,361
however I do have one
in the warehouse.

571
00:42:07,437 --> 00:42:09,371
Superb.

572
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,532
What else do you have
in the warehouse?

573
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:15,132
<i>Mm-hmm. All right.
Uh-huh.</i>

574
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:19,106
That was Mr. Lakewood
from the dealership.

575
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:21,412
<i>He says that boxer-looking punk
is gonna pick up the keys...</i>

576
00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:23,679
to three new Mercedes today.

577
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:26,551
Same make and models
as the ones we already got impounded.

578
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:31,253
Now we're talkin'.

579
00:42:31,327 --> 00:42:34,194
<i>The El Spirito
de Graciela...</i>

580
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:38,223
sails Friday,
8:00 a.m. Sharp.

581
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:41,793
We'll target all the cars
within 45 minutes of here.

582
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:44,931
<i>By the time their alarm
tracking systems are activated,</i>

583
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:48,239
<i>the cars will already be
in these containers.</i>

584
00:42:56,152 --> 00:42:59,383
Fellas, this is Sway.

585
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,980
No questions.
I'm here for Kip.

586
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:04,151
<i>- All right.
- All right.</i>

587
00:43:20,376 --> 00:43:22,810
- It's me. He's here.
- The red Chevy Nova?

588
00:43:22,879 --> 00:43:25,814
That's affirmative, sir.

589
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:29,318
As soon as he leaves, you call me
with the owners' addresses, all right?

590
00:43:29,385 --> 00:43:32,320
I'll get those forms
right over, sir.

591
00:43:32,388 --> 00:43:36,256
Damn boss.
Always on my case.

592
00:43:36,326 --> 00:43:39,090
- I got three here?
- Mm-hmm.

593
00:43:39,162 --> 00:43:41,392
Thank you.

594
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:57,775
<i>Huh, Randall Raines,
Donny Astricky, Otto Halliwell.</i>

595
00:43:57,847 --> 00:43:59,940
Should I set up
some tails?

596
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:02,109
Uh-uh. They're
too smart for that.

597
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:04,278
They'll just
dump the cars.

598
00:44:04,354 --> 00:44:06,914
No, we'll get them
with the Mercedes.

599
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:11,017
Let's set up, uh, three surveillance
teams at those addresses.

600
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:16,025
You go ahead and you
make your move, man.

601
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:18,829
And I will
be waiting for you.

602
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,133
Why do you call 'em
girls' names?

603
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:29,337
<i>That's a good question.
Why do you call 'em girls' names?</i>

604
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:34,008
<i>It's code. You say Jane,
you say Shirley, Lucy, Edna,</i>

605
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:37,746
and nobody listening
on the waves is the wiser.

606
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,788
Got 'em.

607
00:44:44,494 --> 00:44:47,156
Okay.

608
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:52,998
All right, we've got the addresses
on all 50 ladies. Let's scout 'em.

609
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:01,542
- There she is.
- Nice.

610
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:04,546
Damn, it's cold up here!
They keep these Ferraris refrigerated?

611
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:07,549
And you know black people don't like
cold weather! We're tropical people, man.

612
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:09,983
When this is over,
I'm gonna smoke a joint,

613
00:45:10,053 --> 00:45:12,749
<i>watch two hours of Roots,
and I'm gonna kick your ass.</i>

614
00:45:12,822 --> 00:45:16,849
<i>Hello, and welcome
to TV Car Trivia.</i>

615
00:45:16,926 --> 00:45:20,521
First question: Who was
the driver of a '73 Firebird?

616
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:23,087
<i>- Uh, Otto?
- Uh, Jim Rockford, Rockford Files.</i>

617
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,691
<i>Give me Columbo.</i>

618
00:45:25,768 --> 00:45:27,963
- A Peugeot convertible.
- What color?

619
00:45:28,037 --> 00:45:30,471
- Grey.
- How'd you know that?

620
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,508
'Cause I love that show.

621
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:35,339
I got three words
for all of y'all. Get a life!

622
00:45:35,411 --> 00:45:37,777
Ah, this is some kiddie shit, Sphinx.

623
00:45:37,847 --> 00:45:40,645
What's on Magnum P.I.'s
license plate?

624
00:45:40,717 --> 00:45:42,651
<i>"Robin 1."</i>

625
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,449
<i>Wait. Wasn't Robin that
faggoty guy who hung with him?</i>

626
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:48,046
No, that was Higgins.
That was Higgins.

627
00:45:48,124 --> 00:45:50,149
Hey, hey, ten points
for our fearless leader.

628
00:45:50,226 --> 00:45:53,218
<i>Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor
of the Bill Bixby trifecta?</i>

629
00:45:56,733 --> 00:45:59,429
<i>He drove a Corvette in The Magician,</i>

630
00:45:59,502 --> 00:46:02,630
<i>A Ford pickup truck
in The Incredible Hulk,</i>

631
00:46:02,705 --> 00:46:06,402
<i>and in The Courtship
of Eddie's Father, he walked.</i>

632
00:46:11,347 --> 00:46:14,316
- Bingo.
- My man.

633
00:46:27,563 --> 00:46:30,396
<i>Al, tell me something.</i>

634
00:46:30,466 --> 00:46:32,832
Nothin' doing here, sir.
Nobody's showing.

635
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:34,665
Copy.

636
00:46:34,737 --> 00:46:36,728
Minivan approaching.

637
00:46:36,806 --> 00:46:39,297
<i>It seems a little late
for soccer practice.</i>

638
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,105
Heads up. I think we got
some activity right here.

639
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:53,316
<i>Oh, that is...
Looks like it's Kip Raines,</i>

640
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:55,516
<i>and we got a Randall Raines.</i>

641
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:59,254
If they take this,
we will take them down.

642
00:46:59,328 --> 00:47:02,559
<i>He's pulling something
out of his pocket. You see that?</i>

643
00:47:02,632 --> 00:47:05,658
<i>It's a camera. Looks like
he's just doing some homework.</i>

644
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:07,828
<i>All right,
let's leave him be.</i>

645
00:47:07,904 --> 00:47:10,702
I don't wanna burn this.
They will be back.

646
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:15,340
<i>Huh.</i>

647
00:47:15,411 --> 00:47:18,312
You know what? Let's go over
to Otto's in the morning.

648
00:47:18,381 --> 00:47:21,873
Kick over some rocks,
see what's underneath there.

649
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:24,579
We saved the best for last.

650
00:47:24,654 --> 00:47:28,181
The '67 Shelby Mustang GT-500.

651
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:31,749
- The GT-500?
- Yeah, yeah.

652
00:47:35,264 --> 00:47:38,131
There she is.

653
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:42,001
<i>Yep, there's Eleanor.</i>

654
00:47:43,472 --> 00:47:46,202
Eleanor is Memphis's unicorn.

655
00:47:46,275 --> 00:47:49,005
- What's a unicorn?
- Fabled creature.

656
00:47:49,078 --> 00:47:52,912
You know, the horse with the horn,
impossible to capture.

657
00:47:52,982 --> 00:47:56,850
<i>It's the one car, no matter how many times
you try to boost, something always happens.</i>

658
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:05,352
We're gonna get through this this time,
right? It's gonna be smooth...

659
00:48:05,428 --> 00:48:07,623
<i>- What's he doing?
- And easy.</i>

660
00:48:07,697 --> 00:48:11,428
He's talkin' to her, man.
Tryin' to get reacquainted.

661
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,300
<i>Done had a rough history. She almost
got him killed a couple of times.</i>

662
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:18,101
<i>- I don't want any talking back.
- He flipped one on the Harbor freeway.</i>

663
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:20,404
He went off
the Long Beach pier once.

664
00:48:20,476 --> 00:48:22,910
A smooth, easy ride.

665
00:48:24,513 --> 00:48:26,481
We're just gonna glide.

666
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:32,313
Big night tomorrow, guys.
Let's go home.

667
00:48:33,723 --> 00:48:36,453
- Did you... Did you get the picture?
- Yeah.

668
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:40,291
See you tomorrow night,
Eleanor, with your fine ass.

669
00:48:42,865 --> 00:48:47,131
Man, we're almost home.
You wanna get something to eat?

670
00:48:47,203 --> 00:48:49,637
<i>I'd like to get
a chocolate malt.</i>

671
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:04,147
- Hey!
- Get out of the car!

672
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,518
Go, go, go, go, go!

673
00:49:09,926 --> 00:49:12,360
Why are people shooting at us?

674
00:49:12,428 --> 00:49:15,363
'Cause I blew up their car!

675
00:49:35,685 --> 00:49:37,949
Over here!

676
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:45,783
"Beast."

677
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:48,386
Okay, okay.

678
00:49:52,134 --> 00:49:55,069
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

679
00:49:55,137 --> 00:49:57,867
Hey!

680
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:09,510
Oh!

681
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:42,645
<i>Oh, you...
you think it's a game?</i>

682
00:50:42,718 --> 00:50:45,744
Johnny B.
Cops, man.

683
00:50:45,821 --> 00:50:48,790
<i>I ain't got nothin' but time, baby.</i>

684
00:50:59,702 --> 00:51:02,728
Oh, man, we're gonna
be here all night, man.

685
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:07,300
Look! Cop car! Uh-huh.

686
00:51:07,376 --> 00:51:12,245
Long as I'm in here, you're just gonna
sit out there, aren't ya? Aye?

687
00:51:14,884 --> 00:51:17,478
Hey, listen,
this is the plan.

688
00:51:17,553 --> 00:51:20,147
This is what we're gonna do.
There's a big rig over there.

689
00:51:23,526 --> 00:51:27,485
Uh, mister, is that your truck
out there, the Big Rig Wrecker?

690
00:51:27,563 --> 00:51:29,531
- Big Rig Wrecker's mine.
- That's cool.

691
00:51:43,646 --> 00:51:46,581
What do I gotta do?
How do I learn? Where do I go?

692
00:51:46,649 --> 00:51:48,879
- Well, you gotta go to truck drivin' school.
- Truck dri...

693
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:51,613
I know, man. I know.
But I mean like, um... -

694
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:56,181
- You boys ready to play
a little pin the tail on the donkey?

695
00:51:56,258 --> 00:51:59,091
- Can I get you a jelly donut or something, man?
- No, I'm just gonna go.

696
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:02,995
- 'Cause I'm gonna have a waffle.
- Maybe next time, though.

697
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:26,219
I'm gonna smoke you!

698
00:52:39,702 --> 00:52:42,034
What the hell's going on?

699
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:46,071
Want some of this?

700
00:52:46,142 --> 00:52:48,076
Yeah.

701
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,810
- You guys got permits for these weapons?
- Oh, man!

702
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:16,835
So you think I can only
get pizzas, huh? Boosted it myself.

703
00:53:16,906 --> 00:53:19,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How'd you get it?

704
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:22,874
<i>- Actually, the keys were in it.
- Oh, well, that kind of defies the point then, don't it?</i>

705
00:53:22,945 --> 00:53:25,470
You stole a car
that wasn't on the list.

706
00:53:25,548 --> 00:53:28,210
You stole a car
that wasn't on the list!

707
00:53:28,284 --> 00:53:31,151
Why didn't you just go to the
police station in a red clown suit...

708
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,154
and let everybody know
what we're doin' here?

709
00:53:33,222 --> 00:53:37,488
- What have we got?
- I don't know.

710
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,357
Shit! Fellas.

711
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:41,623
<i>- What?
- Gimme that.
- Check this out.</i>

712
00:53:41,697 --> 00:53:45,599
- Check this out!
- Let me see that. This looks like heroin.

713
00:53:45,668 --> 00:53:47,795
- Yeah. -
What! - Exactly.

714
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:52,667
- Where did you get this car?
- I n front of some poker parlor in Chinatown.

715
00:53:52,741 --> 00:53:54,766
Did you ever consider why a car
in a neighborhood like that...

716
00:53:54,843 --> 00:53:56,834
<i>- would have its keys left in it?
- No.</i>

717
00:53:56,912 --> 00:53:59,779
Maybe because nobody in that neighborhood
would be stupid enough to rip this car off.

718
00:53:59,848 --> 00:54:02,442
- All right. Get this shit outta here. Take it back.
- No, no. We can't take it back.

719
00:54:02,518 --> 00:54:04,281
- Get it outta here!
- Will everybody relax for a second?

720
00:54:04,353 --> 00:54:07,754
Take it back!

721
00:54:10,593 --> 00:54:12,322
I'm comin' after that shit.
Gimme that.

722
00:54:12,394 --> 00:54:16,091
No!

723
00:54:16,165 --> 00:54:18,895
Man, I will knock the shit out of you.

724
00:54:18,968 --> 00:54:22,096
<i>- Wait, wait, wait.
- Who is it?</i>

725
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:25,538
- Detective Castlebeck.
- Oh. Christ.

726
00:54:38,954 --> 00:54:41,286
Goddamn it.

727
00:54:41,357 --> 00:54:45,453
- Hey, hello, Otto.
- Detective. Good to see you.

728
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:48,826
<i>- Long time.
- Yeah. You're lookin' good.</i>

729
00:54:48,897 --> 00:54:51,297
Thank you.

730
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:53,631
So Randall,
what do we got here?

731
00:54:53,702 --> 00:54:56,830
We got a multigenerational
gathering of players?

732
00:54:56,905 --> 00:54:58,532
<i>- Is that what we got here?
- Right.</i>

733
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:00,973
Here's Donny.

734
00:55:01,043 --> 00:55:03,841
- How you been, D?
- I'm just happy to see you, brother.

735
00:55:03,912 --> 00:55:09,282
Yeah. I gotta tell you, Randall.
Seeing you here, Otto, Donny,

736
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:11,512
makes me feel
almost nostalgic.

737
00:55:11,587 --> 00:55:14,215
Kind of like
a big reunion.

738
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,656
You should stick around,
'cause a little later we're gonna...

739
00:55:16,725 --> 00:55:19,489
make s'mores
and sing "Kumbayah."

740
00:55:21,897 --> 00:55:25,458
- What is this?
- What? They call this a Cadillac.

741
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:28,025
Yeah.

742
00:55:28,103 --> 00:55:29,730
- What's wrong with it, Otto?
- Rest...

743
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:32,069
<i>- Needs restoration.
- What?</i>

744
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:34,837
- Brightening.
- Otto.

745
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:38,175
- You got a '39 Ford right there.
- That's a pretty car.

746
00:55:38,247 --> 00:55:41,876
- Isn't that a nice car?
- Yeah. Right here you got a '53 Fiat Vignale.

747
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:46,353
<i>Now, these are beautiful cars, Otto.
And here we got a '83 Cadillac Eldorado.</i>

748
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:48,982
- Yeah.
- I mean, who the hell pays...

749
00:55:49,058 --> 00:55:52,289
to brighten up
a Cadillac Eldorado?

750
00:55:52,361 --> 00:55:55,762
I think it holds a certain
sentimental value, you know.

751
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:58,425
<i>Nothing more.</i>

752
00:56:00,035 --> 00:56:02,128

That is Harold, Randall, Otto,

No faith in our newfound
goodness, Detective? Huh?

756
00:56:21,824 --> 00:56:25,260
Task force runs on statistics

Thank you.

763
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:44,541
See, I know what you're doin'.
I know.

764
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:48,242
You're thinkin' there's no want,
but that I stripped its guts...

765
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:50,444
and crated her up, right?

766
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:52,544
Is that what you did,
Randall?

767
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:55,419
No. I didn't do it. You know, you're
trying to hurt my feelings? Fine.

768
00:56:55,491 --> 00:56:57,425
You know what? Go ahead.
Do it. Let her rip.

769
00:56:57,493 --> 00:57:00,519
- Go ahead, rev it up.
- All right, goddamn it. I will.

770
00:57:00,596 --> 00:57:02,655
Sell it to you cheap.

771
00:57:02,731 --> 00:57:05,894
Yeah. '83. First year they
put the auto-ride control on these boys.

772
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:09,631
Oh, I don't know. You probably know
more about cars at this point than I do.

773
00:57:09,705 --> 00:57:13,664
- You slippin' on me, Randall?
- No, it's just your knowledge overwhelms me.

774
00:57:13,742 --> 00:57:16,973
- It's got a real nice-sounding engine.
Right, Otto? - Four point one liter.

775
00:57:17,045 --> 00:57:19,843
- Digital fuel injection?
- You got it. You're the man.

All right.

00:57:53,282 --> 00:57:55,216
I'll catch you later.

783
00:58:11,934 --> 00:58:13,868
- It's on for tonight.
- How do you know?

784
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:19,434
They got the call signs
on all the units working tonight.

785
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:25,241
- Wh-What were you gonna do with this?
- I was gonna bonk him.

786

Bonk?
For the next 24 hours,

<i>- You got it? - Got
it. - Yeah, that's cool.</i>

789
00:58:33,622 --> 00:58:36,455
Obviously they're onto us.
He's sniffin' real close.

790
00:58:36,525 --> 00:58:39,119
If anything tonight
appears out of place,

791
00:58:39,194 --> 00:58:41,662
I want you to cut bait,
get out of there and walk away.

792
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:44,028
And get rid of this
goddamn car!

793
00:58:46,668 --> 00:58:49,796
- What's up, Kip?
- Bobby, what are you doin'?

794
00:58:49,872 --> 00:58:51,931
You think you're comin'
with us, but you're not.

795
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:54,032
What are you talkin' about, man?
I'm part of the team. I get to go.

796
00:58:54,109 --> 00:58:58,978
No, no, wake up. Gonna end up in the jail
or the morgue or some shit. Don't be stupid.

797
00:58:59,047 --> 00:59:01,208
What am I supposed to do?

798
00:59:01,283 --> 00:59:03,615
Did you see a box
of rubber gloves here, man?

799
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:08,452
Gloves? Man, you don't need gloves.
This is the new age. Check this out.

800
00:59:08,524 --> 00:59:11,618
- What is this?
- Let me just see that big claw you call a hand.

801
00:59:13,228 --> 00:59:15,059
That's not doughnut jelly,
so don't eat it.

802
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,657
Your new fingerprints.
Elvis is back.

803
00:59:18,734 --> 00:59:20,565
Hmm.

- Yeah, you do.

805
00:59:25,307 --> 00:59:27,275
Look like a little
ghetto Smurf.

806
00:59:45,928 --> 00:59:50,092
I am a bad man.

807
00:59:57,906 --> 01:00:00,500
Thanks.
Thanks for doin' this.

808
01:00:03,011 --> 01:00:05,741
Keep it real.
Think slow.

809
01:00:06,882 --> 01:00:08,816
We should get through it
just fine.

Okay, let's ride.

812
01:00:59,067 --> 01:01:01,467
Oh! Shit.

813
01:01:05,874 --> 01:01:08,434
Gimme that torch. Aha!

814
01:01:10,012 --> 01:01:13,004
I tell you, I'm the man.
Now, where does this go?

815
01:01:13,081 --> 01:01:15,743
Find a way to get in here.
Get this...

816
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:20,754
I tell you, I'm runnin' this shit!
You do that again, I will kick...

817
01:01:20,822 --> 01:01:23,256
Cool, man. You don't have
to take it so damn personal.

818
01:01:25,127 --> 01:01:27,857
Ah. Everything is perfect.

819
01:01:40,876 --> 01:01:45,609
Hello, ladies. Always was
a sucker for a redhead.

Go, go!

Nothing yet.

Oh, no. I can't see

another one of these suits, all right?

845
01:04:40,121 --> 01:04:43,022

- You need a fashion counselor.

All right, babe. I ain't here for the door.
I here for the car. Get your big ass out.

<i>If they roll, we take them down.</i>

01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:54,418
- Where are you?
- Where do you think I am?

pit boss's lady. What do you want?

- What?

879
01:08:01,701 --> 01:08:04,363
I want everybody to get back
to the garage now.

880

Oh, so she's havin'
a baby right now?

881
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,499
I guess I better get
to the hospital then, huh?

882
01:08:09,575 --> 01:08:11,270
Something's got him spooked.

Way over here...

885

He's heading away
from the vehicle.

I see you.

887
01:08:29,695 --> 01:08:32,129
Pull in over there.

891
01:09:01,627 --> 01:09:03,356
inside the car.

892
01:09:03,429 --> 01:09:05,920
You wanna tell me
what you're doin' with these?

893
01:09:05,998 --> 01:09:08,831
Yeah. These are from last week.
These are from the other boost.

894
01:09:15,641 --> 01:09:18,439
Who is it?

895
01:09:19,812 --> 01:09:24,146
<i>- The keys, the keys, the keys!
- Take it easy!</i>

896
01:09:24,217 --> 01:09:26,242
<i>- Now gimme this!
- What happened? What happened?</i>

897
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,446
<i>- Where'd you get these from?
- What's the problem?</i>

898
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:31,456
The Mercedes are dirty!
There's surveillance vans all over them.

899
01:09:31,524 --> 01:09:34,925
- Where'd they come from?
- Whoa. My guy in Southland. The same guy I used last time.

900
01:09:34,994 --> 01:09:37,189
- Same guy I used before.
- Before when?

901
01:09:37,263 --> 01:09:39,891
- When we... When we took the other cars.
- Other Mercedes.

902
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:43,265
- Christ.
- Castlebeck.

903
01:09:43,336 --> 01:09:46,635
He got to one of the guys at the dealership,
and he turned him. That's what happened.

904
01:09:46,706 --> 01:09:49,470
Eight hours left.

905
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:53,069
So what, we're gonna stand around and
have a meeting? Wh-What's goin' on?

906
01:09:53,145 --> 01:09:57,047
Memphis, maybe it's time for us
to start thinking about...

907
01:09:57,116 --> 01:10:01,109
- how to get these young kids
out of town, 'cause...

908
01:10:01,187 --> 01:10:05,590
If there's no Mercedes, there's no point
in boosting any other cars. You hear me?

909
01:10:05,658 --> 01:10:09,389
- That's it.
- 47 is not 50, Memphis. You know that's what he'll say.

910
01:10:09,462 --> 01:10:11,396
Yeah.

911
01:10:11,464 --> 01:10:15,730
<i>Hey, Memphis. You know, we still have
the Mercedes keys from the last boost.</i>

912
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:20,295
Hey! Those cars are
at the police impound.

913
01:10:20,373 --> 01:10:23,365
Okay? The police impound. You want
us to go there and start stealin' cars?

914
01:10:23,442 --> 01:10:26,411
<i>- Yeah. - Yeah, let's do
it. - You're crazy.</i>

915
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:30,916
- We're gonna get hectic. Let's go.
- No, Memphis, no. Don't do this.

916
01:10:30,983 --> 01:10:32,974
Hey, Sphinx, I don't look
suspicious, do I, man?

917
01:10:33,052 --> 01:10:36,419
<i>Otto, man, I think that
your dog ate the keys.</i>

918
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:39,822
He usually goes for the license plates.

919
01:10:39,892 --> 01:10:44,124
- Are you sure?
- What? Wait a minute. The dog ate the keys?

920
01:10:44,196 --> 01:10:47,927
- Yes.
How you gonna get them out?

921
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,831
- Not funny.
- I'm...

922
01:10:49,902 --> 01:10:52,336
- Hey, hey, don't even
think about it, Sphinx.

923
01:10:52,405 --> 01:10:54,669
It's all right.

924
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:58,141
Say, uh, Toby,

925
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:02,510
go see if you can get some,
uh, Alpo, and get some Ex-lax.

926
01:11:02,581 --> 01:11:05,049
- No way, man.
- Bad dog!

927
01:11:05,117 --> 01:11:07,608
<i>- Let's get back to work.</i>

928
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:25,698
Hey! Open the door.

929
01:11:25,771 --> 01:11:28,171
<i>- Ah, Jesus.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.</i>

930
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,708
- End it, rock star. Get in.
- Jesus Christ.

931
01:11:30,776 --> 01:11:34,803
Now what, man?
What else?

932
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,281
Fuzzy, you never called me.
So now we gotta stay down here...

933
01:11:38,351 --> 01:11:40,512
till you tell me everything
you know.

934
01:11:40,586 --> 01:11:42,952
I... I told you everything I know.
I know that,

935
01:11:43,022 --> 01:11:45,047
because I said,
"This is everything I know."

936
01:11:45,124 --> 01:11:49,720
Detective Drycoff, does it seem like the
suspect is violating his parole right now?

937
01:11:49,795 --> 01:11:52,662
<i>Why, yes, Detective Castlebeck,
if by violating his parole...</i>

938
01:11:52,732 --> 01:11:55,292
you mean failing to cooperate
with a law enforcement officer.

939
01:12:01,474 --> 01:12:04,136
A little trick I learned in
the car thief retirement home.

940
01:12:05,244 --> 01:12:06,768
Can you hold this?

941
01:12:06,846 --> 01:12:10,179
No, no, no. I'm not failing
to cooperate. It's just that...

942
01:12:10,249 --> 01:12:13,377
Y-Y-Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Uh, word has it...

943
01:12:13,452 --> 01:12:18,219
that Kip Raines took the job and he
screwed up. Uh, he screwed up pretty bad.

944
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:20,485
And who put out
the order for the job?

945
01:12:23,362 --> 01:12:25,296
It's Raymond Calitri's order.

946
01:12:25,364 --> 01:12:27,559
<i>Nice.</i>

947
01:12:33,973 --> 01:12:35,804
<i>Come on, come on,
come on, come on.</i>

948
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:39,675
Yes.

949
01:12:42,948 --> 01:12:45,815
<i>We have six hours left.
Has the dog done its business yet?</i>

950
01:12:45,885 --> 01:12:47,819
Toby and Freb
are walking him right now.

951
01:12:47,887 --> 01:12:51,550
- He's not gonna go it.
It's not gonna happen, man.

952
01:12:51,624 --> 01:12:56,220
Come on, dog.
What's wrong, Hemi? Poop, dog.

953
01:12:58,864 --> 01:13:03,597
- It had to be a girl car.
- Girl car, what kind of a girl drives a Hemi 'Cuda?

954
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:06,570
I'll show you.

955
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:09,335
Lipstick?

956
01:13:09,408 --> 01:13:13,071
Matches the car.

957
01:13:13,145 --> 01:13:17,172
<i>- What's next? Blush? Mascara?
- Next time...</i>

958
01:13:17,249 --> 01:13:21,709
I'll pull out the, uh, leather and
high heels and pink underwear for you.

959
01:13:21,787 --> 01:13:24,620
- Leather, high heels and pink underwear.
- Pink underwear.

960
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:27,250
- Pink underwear works.
Pink underwear works.

961
01:13:30,262 --> 01:13:35,029
<i>Raymond Vincent Calitri did five years
in South London for manslaughter.</i>

962
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,568
- He immigrated in '98.
- Look at this.

963
01:13:37,636 --> 01:13:42,437
Loan shark and extortion, fencing. Ha.
His front's a salvage yard.

964
01:14:01,427 --> 01:14:03,691
Gonna have to
wait it out.

965
01:14:05,431 --> 01:14:09,492
So, you seeing anybody?

966
01:14:09,568 --> 01:14:13,527
No. No, I had
a girl once.

967
01:14:13,606 --> 01:14:19,101
- She was great.
- Mmm. So if she was so great, why'd you leave her?

968
01:14:39,665 --> 01:14:41,860
I did ask you
to come with me.

969
01:14:43,469 --> 01:14:47,098
No, you asked me
to be a different person.

970
01:14:47,172 --> 01:14:52,667
I didn't want to see people get hurt.
I just wanted you to slow down.

971
01:14:52,745 --> 01:14:55,179
Well, I couldn't.

972
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:57,181
'Cause I wasn't ready.

973
01:14:58,651 --> 01:15:00,949
- You're straight now.
- Yeah, I am.

974
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,920
'Cause it wasn't the same
without you.

975
01:15:09,194 --> 01:15:12,129
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Hey, asshole. I was reading that.

976
01:15:12,197 --> 01:15:14,131
- Watch your mouth, kid.
- What's goin' on?

977
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:16,759
<i>- This is a homicide file from a homicide investigation.
- All right.</i>

978
01:15:16,835 --> 01:15:19,497
It took us three months to get a
magistrate to give us a wiretap on 'em.

979
01:15:19,572 --> 01:15:24,976
<i>No other division, including GRAB, can go near
his person, residence or place of business.</i>

980
01:15:25,044 --> 01:15:27,478
All right? Got it?
Let me tell you guys something.

981
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:32,313
All right. Raymond Calitri
is going down for murder one. Boneheads.

982
01:15:32,384 --> 01:15:36,150
Who gives a shit
about grand theft auto? Really.

983
01:15:37,556 --> 01:15:39,717
<i>I can't watch this.</i>

984
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:42,886
Come on, come on, come on.
Get it on. Get it over with.

985
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,835
What do you think is more
exciting, having sex, or stealing cars?

986
01:15:52,905 --> 01:15:54,998
Having sex or boosting cars?

987
01:15:55,074 --> 01:15:57,508
<i>Um. Ooh!</i>

988
01:15:57,576 --> 01:15:59,510
Uh.

989
01:16:03,015 --> 01:16:06,178
<i>Well, uh, how about, uh...</i>

990
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:09,778
<i>having sex
while boosting cars?</i>

991
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,221
God, that's
a good line.

992
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:16,853
<i>Oh, doesn't work on
a lot of girls, though.</i>

993
01:16:16,929 --> 01:16:19,227
I just blurted it out.
I'm s...

994
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,864
But you haven't
answered the question.

995
01:16:23,936 --> 01:16:27,030
Well, you see,
the problem is,

996
01:16:27,106 --> 01:16:29,199
how do you get over
the shifter?

997
01:16:29,274 --> 01:16:33,074
- Oh. Oh, right. 'Cause the, uh...
- Because it gets in the way.

998
01:16:33,145 --> 01:16:39,050
Because you wouldn't want to disrupt
the, uh, synchromesh. Right?

999
01:16:39,118 --> 01:16:41,552
Or the throttle linkage.

1000
01:16:47,726 --> 01:16:50,490
The clutch master cylinder.

1001
01:16:54,299 --> 01:16:56,392
Double overhead cam shaft.

1002
01:16:56,468 --> 01:17:02,065
- I can't do this.
- Wait, wait. Just straight in-line six,

1003
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:03,870
triple Weber carburetors...

1004
01:17:03,942 --> 01:17:07,378
<i>Bolted to each other's
body structures.</i>

1005
01:17:10,482 --> 01:17:12,416
Oh, it's time to work.

1006
01:17:12,484 --> 01:17:16,477
Good brakes.
Good brakes too.

1007
01:17:30,402 --> 01:17:34,270
- There's nothin' happening.
- Maybe he's got indigestion.

1008
01:17:34,339 --> 01:17:37,740
- Well, dude, we'll give him some
more Ex-lax. - He already ate two.

1009
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:39,573
<i>- Hey, little man.
- Oh, man.</i>

1010
01:17:39,645 --> 01:17:45,015
I thought I told you this is our turf.
What, you wanna make a move?

1011
01:17:45,084 --> 01:17:47,018
We don't want anything
to do with your turf.

1012
01:17:47,086 --> 01:17:48,986
<i>Something wrong with
where we live?</i>

1013
01:17:49,054 --> 01:17:51,648
Oh, no, it's cool for you.
I mean, it's just not for us.

1014
01:17:51,724 --> 01:17:54,852
Oh, so now you think you're
better than us or something, huh?

1015
01:17:54,927 --> 01:17:57,623
<i>- Maybe we should cut you up, doll?
- Um...</i>

1016
01:17:57,696 --> 01:18:02,224
- Dude, the keys. Freb.
- Excuse me a second, guys.

1017
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:05,862
<i>Man!</i>

1018
01:18:05,938 --> 01:18:09,032
- Aw, I'm gonna throw up, dog!
- Man, that's disgusting.

1019
01:18:09,108 --> 01:18:12,373
What kind of pervert gets their jollies
off playing with dog shit?

1020
01:18:12,444 --> 01:18:14,969
Look, man! I got 'em.
All three, man.

1021
01:18:15,047 --> 01:18:17,641
- You guys are sick.
- I got 'em!

1022
01:18:30,295 --> 01:18:32,820
Wake up, man.
Check this out.

1023
01:18:32,898 --> 01:18:36,334
Every time I drive my Volvo
in Beverly Hills, they tow the shit.

1024
01:18:45,744 --> 01:18:49,703
- We ain't got any Volvos here.
- There is a Volvo here. I know.

1025
01:18:49,782 --> 01:18:51,249
- They told me...
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

1026
01:18:51,316 --> 01:18:54,285
What I'm tryin' to tell you is,
there ain't no Volvos here.

1027
01:19:00,626 --> 01:19:03,424
Then get in your book, do something.
Find my damn Volvo!

1028
01:19:03,495 --> 01:19:06,430
Sphinx. Sway.

1029
01:19:06,498 --> 01:19:08,830
It's got to be somewhere
in there. Check it out, man.

1030
01:19:10,435 --> 01:19:12,699
Wait, wait.
There's nothing here. Look.

1031
01:19:12,771 --> 01:19:17,037
- There's another one... - No, no!
Uh-uh, hey! Tell you what, look at this.

1032
01:19:17,109 --> 01:19:20,636
Look at her.

1033
01:19:31,023 --> 01:19:33,491
<i>Look, I'm sorry. I don't
even need to be out here.</i>

1034
01:19:33,559 --> 01:19:36,528
Hey, uh... I got a midget
