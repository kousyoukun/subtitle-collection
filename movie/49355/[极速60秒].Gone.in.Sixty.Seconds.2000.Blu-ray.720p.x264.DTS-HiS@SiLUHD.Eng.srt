1
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:27,369
<i>Corner of Wiltern</i>
<i>and Wetherly.</i>

2
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:32,371
Tumbler messed up.
He said the Porsche should be...

3
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,534
<i>at the corner</i>
<i>of Wiltern and Wetherly.</i>

4
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,840
- <i>It's right there.</i>
- <i>You're bullshittin' me, right?</i>

5
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:40,609
- 9024 Wiltern?
- What? That?

6
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,947
I gotta get my tool.

7
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:46,215
Kip! He ain't
bullshittin'.

8
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:52,187
<i>Kip! That's not a tool.</i>
<i>That's a damn brick!</i>

9
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:56,391
Kip, man, we gonna use a brick, man, we might
as well call a prison and make reservations.

10
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:59,025
<i>Ah, come on.</i>

11
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,738
Get the number.

12
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,770
42850.

13
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:11,540
<i>Hurry up, man.</i>

14
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:14,241
<i>Man, let's go!</i>

15
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:18,577
Let's get the hell
outta here.

16
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:21,885
Okay, Billy Badass,
you got us in here.

17
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:24,482
Now tell me how the hell
we gonna get out.

18
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,552
Oh, no. I know you ain't gonna do
what I think you're gonna do.

19
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:30,598
- Oh, man!
- Come on!

20
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:35,431
- <i>This ain't</i> The Dukes of Hazzard.
- Come on!

21
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,755
Yo, so check out my new move.
I call it "The Stranger."

22
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:58,054
What I do is, I sit on my hand
for like 15, 20 minutes...

23
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:01,494
<i>until it goes numb,</i>
<i>no feeling at all.</i>

24
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:04,031
And then... I rub one out.

25
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:05,930
The Stranger, huh?

26
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:09,630
It's like a little boys' nursery
school I've come upon here.

27
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:13,003
Where are they?

28
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:18,908
- <i>You want it? All right.</i>
- Hey.

29
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:21,814
- <i>Leave those people alone.</i>
- Oh, my God. Sweetie, you're so talented.

30
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:25,786
- Wha... Hey, hey. Stolen car. Stolen car.
- I know. I know.

31
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:28,118
Hey, I love you.

32
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:35,788
Man, we goin' to jail, man!

33
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:38,230
Come on!

34
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:46,569
Keep your hands behind your back.
You have the right to remain silent.

35
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:49,167
Hey, watch it!

36
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,244
We have a silver Porsche.
Estimated speed: 80 miles per hour.

37
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:58,150
Heading west on Wilshire Boulevard.

38
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,018
<i>This is Air One. We have a visual</i>
<i>of the suspect southbound...</i>

39
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,923
<i>on Vincent Thomas Bridge.</i>

40
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:11,991
- Something wrong, Tumbler?
- Yeah, I'm missing <i>Jerry Springer</i>.

41
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:17,995
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

42
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:26,070
That's right, that's right,
that's right, that's right!

43
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:31,477
What's up, old man?

44
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:34,215
She'll go zero to 60
in 5.2 seconds.

45
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,917
<i>Believe me,</i>
<i>I can vouch for that.</i>

46
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:40,587
<i>Ground units be advised, suspects last</i>
<i>seen entering south side of warehouse.</i>

47
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:44,120
Thirteen down, thirty-seven to go.

48
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:52,967
- What the hell is that?
- What is that, man?

49
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,771
- Now you've gone and done it, Raines.
- Tumbler!

50
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:58,108
- Get the board and get the lights!
- <i>I got it, I got it!</i>

51
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,410
This is bullshit.
It's not comin' off!

52
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:02,746
- <i>Keys! Get the keys!</i>
- I got 'em. I got 'em!

53
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:05,844
<i>Come on, everybody!</i>
<i>Let's go! Hurry up!</i>

54
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:09,152
- I got it!
- <i>Let's go! Toby, get it!</i>

55
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:12,489
- <i>Let's go, boys!</i>
- Come on, come on! I got the light!

56
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:15,325
Go, go, go!
Let's go!

57
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:19,194
Shit!

58
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:35,314
<i>Get the VIN number on that?</i>

59
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:38,512
- <i>I got it.</i>
- <i>We've got a lamp shade by a truck.</i>

60
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:41,784
What do we got?

61
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:44,724
All gone. We didn't get
a single one of 'em.

62
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:47,421
And we are talking
about professionals.

63
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:51,762
No visible damage to locking mechanisms,
steering columns or ignitions.

64
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,961
And, as you can see,
these are not Honda Civics.

65
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:57,801
This is one of three
brand-new Mercedes,

66
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:01,468
a car they say
is unstealable.

67
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:04,637
Yeah, unless you get
the laser-cut transponder key...

68
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:07,204
sent directly to the U.S.
Dealer from Hamburg.

69
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:09,773
They got somebody
working on the inside.

70
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:14,652
- Find out which dealership sold them, serviced them, etc., etc.
- Yeah, I'll get on it.

71
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:18,886
- Mr. Drycoff?
- Yeah?

72
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:23,364
Let's impound these cars for one month. I
don't give a damn if they belong to Tom Cruise.

73
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:54,220
<i>Control, vision, determination.</i>

74
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:57,595
These are the three
fundamental components...

75
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,533
of the new generation
race car driver.

76
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:03,901
Speed is a byproduct.
Going fast.

77
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:09,000
But remember: The car is you,
you are the car.

78
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:13,080
Okay? Let's ride!

79
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:21,518
Billy, you just shaved
one second off your lap time!

80
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,230
Tommy, I don't know what
that was, but it wasn't driving.

81
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:44,012
Go get 'em!

82
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:55,723
Well, well, well. What do you pay
your pit crews with?

83
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,487
Oreos and Gummy Bears?

84
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,997
I folded, Atley. You know that.
What are you doing here?

85
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:05,659
- Is there someplace we can talk?
- About what?

86
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:07,793
About your brother
and the deep shit he's in.

87
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:12,033
Frank, can you watch
the kids for a minute?

88
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:20,948
Tell me about Kip.

89
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:23,746
He took a job,
and he fumbled it.

90
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:26,947
Now he's jammed up.
He's jammed up bad.

91
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:31,925
- What kind of job?
- A boost. A big boost.

92
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:34,359
A boost?

93
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,126
What's Kip doing on a boost?

94
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:42,500
Oh, you're shittin' me, man.

95
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:45,699
Kip's become quite
the little crew runner since you left.

96
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:48,265
You don't talk to your ma?

97
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,777
She neglected to mention it.

98
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:53,576
Listen, I need something.

99
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:55,946
I-I need something
cold to drink.

100
00:10:56,017 --> 00:10:59,316
I thought we were goin'
someplace to talk.

101
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:08,987
- Who was the job for?
- A new guy named Raymond Calitri.

102
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:11,862
They call him
"The Carpenter."

103
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:15,130
He's runnin' all the dark
ponies down there now.

104
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:19,572
It's a full-on "Devil came
down to Long Beach" trip.

105
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:23,634
He's bad.
He's real bad.

106
00:11:23,712 --> 00:11:27,512
And this Calitri is the one
who's after my brother?

107
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:29,550
Like stains on a mattress.

108
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:34,017
And you should know...
I work for him.

109
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:41,827
There weren't a lot of opportunities
for retired car thieves on the gimp.

110
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:44,889
He put me to work.

111
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:50,495
I-I gotta tell you, Memphis, this guy,
he scares the shit out of even me.

112
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:15,091
What are you doin', man?

113
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:19,725
Stop! Stop!

114
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:26,634
Atley Jackson.

115
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:30,474
<i>Got it. They have Kip.</i>

116
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:32,809
Take me there.

117
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:04,269
Raymond Calitri,
Memphis Raines.

118
00:13:04,346 --> 00:13:06,576
I try...

119
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:10,175
to learn your ways,
understand your obsessions.

120
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:14,018
<i>But this baseball...</i>
<i>it's so bleeding boring, isn't it?</i>

121
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:16,421
Where's my brother?

122
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:21,520
Memphis Raines,
your legend precedes you.

123
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:23,962
Atley tells me
you're the best.

124
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:27,798
<i>After you left, auto theft in the</i>
<i>South Bay area went down 47 percent.</i>

125
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:30,463
Where's my brother?

126
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,240
<i>I'm proud of these. Straddle chair</i>
<i>from the Arts and Crafts period.</i>

127
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,871
Mahogany table
with cloud-lift pattern.

128
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:42,041
Black walnut wine table.
Metal's cold, ugly.

129
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:46,577
<i>Wood's warm, clean,</i>
<i>provided by nature.</i>

130
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:51,217
See a piece of furniture take shape,
it's like watching a child grow.

131
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:54,694
I asked you a question.

132
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:57,664
They threw us out of England,
threw us out of France,

133
00:13:57,732 --> 00:14:00,200
but here we are,
flourishing really,

134
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:04,967
except for the minor inconvenience of
despising everything about your country.

135
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,066
On this list you'll find
50 cars... five-zero.

136
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:13,877
I need all 50 delivered to Long Beach Harbor,
pier 14 by 8:00 a.m. Four days from now.

137
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:15,917
I'm paying $200,000.

138
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:18,509
I'm not interested.
I'm just here for my brother.

139
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:22,114
Young Kip came to me.
He had street cred.

140
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,159
The brother of the notorious
Memphis Raines.

141
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:28,923
So two weeks ago I hired him
and advanced him $10,000.

142
00:14:28,997 --> 00:14:33,434
Atley told me. If it's about the
advance, I can understand your anger.

143
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:38,996
The debt has to be settled.
Ten grand, from me to you.

144
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:42,771
- I wish it was that easy.
- I don't see the complication.

145
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:46,041
I have four days to deliver 50 cars,
and I have no cars.

146
00:14:46,114 --> 00:14:49,777
- Well, that's another problem.
- It is another problem, isn't it?

147
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:54,117
It's about me delivering 50 top-end cars
because I said I would.

148
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:57,818
Because if I don't, my South American
friend goes somewhere else from now on.

149
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:00,326
And that's not good.
It's a humiliation.

150
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:02,693
Because I'm the asshole
who said I could deliver.

151
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:05,289
Am I an asshole?
Do I look like an asshole?

152
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:08,768
Yeah.

153
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:13,637
- I need that paper satisfied.
- I'm retired.

154
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,905
And where the hell
is my brother?

155
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:23,807
I made this as well.

156
00:15:23,885 --> 00:15:26,979
My first one.

157
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:46,634
It takes 80,000 pounds
of pressure to crush a car.

158
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:59,677
- Kip?
- Who's that?

159
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:03,121
- Memphis.
- Oh, shit.

160
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:04,920
You okay?

161
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:11,593
Shut it off!

162
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,499
- <i>Turn it off!</i>
- You've got 30 seconds to consider your options.

163
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:17,538
- Shut it off!
- One: You kill me; they kill you.

164
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,971
Your brother dies anyway.

165
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,340
Two: You lie, you accept the job,
you take your brother, you run.

166
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:26,938
I hunt you down, I kill you, I kill
your brother, and I kill your mother...

167
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,506
for the aggravation
you've caused me.

168
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:32,883
<i>Three: You accept the deal,</i>
<i>you steal some cars,</i>

169
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:35,149
you make some money
and you be a big brother.

170
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:47,399
- <i>Memphis!</i>
- 8:00 a.m. Friday morning.

171
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:50,666
The cars are on the boat,
or your brother's in the coffin.

172
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:54,072
<i>Get me outta here!</i>
<i>Somebody get me outta here.</i>

173
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:04,274
<i>Listen, you really don't</i>
<i>have to make me anything.</i>

174
00:17:04,352 --> 00:17:06,513
Oh, hey, you come down here.

175
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:08,715
You saved my ass.
It's the least I can do.

176
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:15,722
Hey, I heard you were, uh, pumping gas
someplace up North or something, right?

177
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:18,357
- Yeah, working with kids.
- Oh, really?

178
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:26,667
"First place."
I remember this.

179
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:30,734
Oh, yeah, that was...
that was a long time ago.

180
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:42,647
What'd you put in it?

181
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:45,386
I don't know.

182
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:52,099
It's good.

183
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:59,032
Ow. Ow. Oh, God.

184
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:02,907
Does Mom know
about any of this?

185
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:06,435
No, no, no, she doesn't,
and I don't think she should.

186
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:09,540
You know, she... she works
really hard, and this... this...

187
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:12,381
She doesn't need to know
about any of this stuff.

188
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:15,752
Look, you know,
I got everything under control.

189
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:18,292
Kitchen's on fire.

190
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:24,397
Uh, man.

191
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:35,801
Hey, Memphis.

192
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:38,209
It's good to see you.

193
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:45,078
<i>Haul the cartons over there!</i>

194
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:48,020
- <i>Hey, Fuzzy.</i>
- Aw, shit. What are you doin' here?

195
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:52,583
- I told you I don't know anything.
- Yeah, but you're a liar.

196
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,562
- You're gonna get me fired, man.
- Fired? That's not good. You're on parole, right?

197
00:18:56,631 --> 00:18:59,794
Fuzzy, hey, nobody
wants to get you fired.

198
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:02,769
We just need this
information is all.

199
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:06,102
Two weeks ago, a call came in
for a lot of top-end cars.

200
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:09,143
- And who made that call?
- I don't have a clue.

201
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,940
- Okay. We should go talk to your boss.
- Oh, shhh.

202
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:15,312
The delivery date.
I know the delivery date.

203
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:17,851
- And when is that?
- Thursday, Friday, end of the week.

204
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,786
Well, you get me a name
within 48 hours, or we'll be back.

205
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:22,789
Good to see you, buddy.

206
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,791
Thank you.

207
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:32,126
I'm looking
for Helen Raines.

208
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,259
<i>Helen, some guy's</i>
<i>here for you.</i>

209
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:36,530
What guy?
What's he look like?

210
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:39,164
Like a firecracker.
Like your son.

211
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,538
You look so good.

212
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:44,976
Thank you, Momma. Here.
Spring... Spring bouquet.

213
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:47,606
What are you doing here?

214
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:51,277
Well, uh, Atley Jackson
came to see me.

215
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:53,479
Told me something about Kip.

216
00:19:53,554 --> 00:19:56,216
Can I help you
with one of these?

217
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:02,387
<i>Okay, that's yours.</i>

218
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:06,559
Tell Castlebeck he's not gonna believe
who just walked into the Quality Cafe.

219
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:09,694
I can't say I'm surprised.

220
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:13,537
All his life he looked up to you,
tried to be you.

221
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:16,702
I guess now he is.

222
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:20,009
So why is this happening?
I send you guys money.

223
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:24,415
He... He met some people,
and he changed.

224
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:29,081
He lost that...
that sweetness, you know?

225
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:36,028
Okay... tell me.
How deep in is he?

226
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:38,156
Deep.

227
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,030
Can you get him out?

228
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:46,098
It means doin' things,

229
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:49,405
things I told you
I'd never do again.

230
00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:52,503
Do what it takes, Randall.

231
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:06,452
<i>When did you get into town, Raines?</i>

232
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:09,257
- Last night.
- Last night? What for?

233
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,662
I thought I'd catch a Lakers game.
Heard we got Shaquille.

234
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:14,827
Guys wanna go?

235
00:21:14,902 --> 00:21:19,066
- Guess not.
- Randall, Randall, Randall, come here.

236
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,041
I get this call from this
uniform, you know?

237
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,874
Axton. Very nice man.
Remembers everything.

238
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:28,074
This man calls me up, says, "Guess
who's back in town?" I say, "Who?"

239
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:31,585
<i>He says, "Randall Raines."</i>
<i>I say, "Randall Raines the car thief?"</i>

240
00:21:31,652 --> 00:21:33,882
He says, "Yeah." I say, "Impossible."
He says, "No, he's back."

241
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:37,550
I say, "No, he's not." He says, "Yes, I
will bet you $200 I just saw Randall Raines."

242
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:41,061
- You guys said a lot. Look, Detective...
- <i>No, whoa, whoa.</i>

243
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:44,064
What's really, really
ironic about this...

244
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:47,761
Two nights ago we snare these
13 fresh stolens waiting for export.

245
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:52,295
At the time I'm thinking,
"This feels like Randall Raines."

246
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:55,399
Now, it didn't have your
panache, your, uh, flash,

247
00:21:55,476 --> 00:21:58,673
but it just felt
like Randall Raines.

248
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:00,771
<i>And now here you are.</i>

249
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:04,409
Look, I don't know what you boys are
looking for, but I just got back, okay?

250
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:07,147
It was a family emergency.
Now, that's the truth.

251
00:22:07,221 --> 00:22:10,588
Family emergency. Yeah, I got
a family emergency too, Randall.

252
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:14,754
I gotta go tell my woman
that I just lost $200 on a stupid deal.

253
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:17,821
- Mmm, she's mean.
- What?

254
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:21,596
She can be mean.

255
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:24,229
Come here.
Come here, Randall.

256
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:27,968
Take those glasses off, Randall.
Please, do me a favor.

257
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,911
Six years ago you make
a real smart move, you know?

258
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,313
You retire from a life that's gonna get
you busted or killed or maybe even both.

259
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:40,252
And I'm thinkin' that not putting
you away when I had a chance...

260
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:45,122
is like this big bug up the ass of this
real impressive career that I've had.

261
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:47,127
Oh, yeah.

262
00:22:47,195 --> 00:22:51,325
Well, without disappointment,
you can't appreciate victory.

263
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:53,526
Eleanor tell you that?

264
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:55,626
Now, that's hittin'
below the belt.

265
00:22:55,703 --> 00:22:58,263
Yeah, all right, let me tell you
about below the belt, Randall.

266
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:01,365
From here on out, if you walk across
the street outside of a crosswalk,

267
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:03,876
if you roll
through a stop sign,

268
00:23:03,945 --> 00:23:07,176
if you use an aerosol can in
a manner other than directed...

269
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:09,876
I mean, I don't care,
you make one slip,

270
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:12,146
and I will put you away
for good.

271
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,745
- Okay.
- <i>By the time you get out, asshole,</i>

272
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:16,983
there won't even be cars.

273
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:20,892
We'll all be cruising around
in your little, vroom, spaceships.

274
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:23,760
That's gonna suck.

275
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,034
Who's Eleanor?

276
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:30,036
It's a damn car.

277
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:33,369
And don't ever
talk about my wife.

278
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,180
Excuse me.
You know where Otto is?

279
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,346
He's in the back, in the paint shop.

280
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:59,198
Is that you? About time
you came to see me.

281
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:01,132
- I missed you.
- Good to see you!

282
00:24:01,235 --> 00:24:04,102
You look great.

283
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:07,107
- It's good to see you.
- You too. Oh, remember my Junie?

284
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,904
Hey, Junie.
How are you?

285
00:24:08,976 --> 00:24:11,536
- We're doin' good, thank you.
- Good, good.

286
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:14,046
You look happy.

287
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:16,310
Well, I am happy.
I really am.

288
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,318
So what happened here?

289
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:20,377
- What do you mean?
- Well, it's nice.

290
00:24:20,454 --> 00:24:24,117
But the chop shop,
the stripped cars, my education.

291
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:27,127
What happened? Hey.

292
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:29,459
Old age happened.
That's what happened.

293
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,827
Got tired of killing 'em.

294
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:33,332
You know, I woke up
one morning and thought,

295
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:36,461
"I'm no longer a destroyer.
I'm a means of resurrection."

296
00:24:36,537 --> 00:24:39,005
Now we restore,
we revive.

297
00:24:39,073 --> 00:24:41,473
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>Remember we used to do this?</i>

298
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:45,273
- What?
- You know. Come here. Okay.

299
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:48,645
It's a Ferrari 365 GTB-4 Daytona.

300
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:51,810
Le Mans, 1971.

301
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:53,649
- <i>Five cam...</i>
- That's a V-12.

302
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:55,951
V-12, right, right,
right, right!

303
00:24:56,023 --> 00:25:00,619
Here it peaks
at 5,500 r.p.m.!

304
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:03,664
- What do you know about Raymond Calitri?
- Who?

305
00:25:03,731 --> 00:25:05,460
Raymond Calitri.

306
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:10,261
Uh, excuse us, sweetness.
I'll be right back.

307
00:25:10,338 --> 00:25:12,636
- We can talk here.
- No, no, no, no, no. It's all right.

308
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:14,834
Raymond Calitri.

309
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:19,778
He's a jackal tearing at the
soft belly of our... of our fair town.

310
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:24,511
And he's an asshole to boot,
so be careful.

311
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:29,454
I heard about Kip.
Are you considering a comeback tour?

312
00:25:29,523 --> 00:25:33,254
- Do you think it can be done?
- Don't do this to me, okay?

313
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:36,421
Please, please not now.

314
00:25:38,366 --> 00:25:40,857
<i>Oh, man.</i>

315
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:49,610
- How many cars?
- <i>Fifty.</i>

316
00:25:49,677 --> 00:25:53,340
- How many days?
- <i>Three.</i>

317
00:25:53,414 --> 00:25:55,678
How many in your crew?

318
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,186
One, but I came here
hoping to negotiate for a second.

319
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,118
No way.
It can't be done.

320
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:04,680
I mean, you need time to prep,
time to shop. You know that.

321
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,227
It has to be.
They're gonna kill him.

322
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:13,366
Oh, man.

323
00:26:21,942 --> 00:26:24,172
It was a mistake
to come here.

324
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:28,375
You have a great life now.
I don't want to upset that.

325
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:36,580
<i>Uh, wait a minute.</i>
<i>Uh, hold on.</i>

326
00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:38,852
Look around you.

327
00:26:38,926 --> 00:26:43,192
These days...
I'm all about second chances.

328
00:26:43,264 --> 00:26:47,030
So, uh, let's make a few phone calls,
and we'll go from there, okay?

329
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,592
Okay.

330
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,900
- Don't look at me!
Look at the people next to you!

331
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:56,442
That's... Turn the wheel!

332
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,241
Pull over! Pull her the hell over!

333
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:02,282
Asshole!

334
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,511
Learn how to drive!

335
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:08,521
Don't touch nothing. Just...

336
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:11,422
No!

337
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:15,223
You can't negotiate turns.
You can't signal properly.

338
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:20,666
You can't maintain speed. You can't
parallel park. Hell, you can't drive, honey.

339
00:27:20,735 --> 00:27:23,203
Shit, I can't swim.
I know I can't.

340
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,001
So you know what I do?
I stay my black ass outta the pool.

341
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:30,009
All right now, just...

342
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,847
Can you... Oh!
Hello?

343
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:40,410
Memphis! Hey, how are you?

344
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:45,289
Sure, sure.
When? Okay.

345
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,691
- 32969811.
- All right. Thanks a lot.

346
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:49,787
Donny.

347
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:54,265
Just take it around the block
a couple of times, okay?

348
00:27:54,335 --> 00:27:56,633
<i>All right.</i>

349
00:28:02,243 --> 00:28:05,178
Hello. I'm calling
for Frankie Fish.

350
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:08,181
Frank's dead, man.
Yeah, he got scragged.

351
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:12,515
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, yeah, I'm looking for Henry Santoro.

352
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:15,487
He went down to Florida
with that asshole Frankie Fish.

353
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:17,820
- <i>Tell him I want my money.</i>
- I didn't mess with your money.

354
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:20,019
Yes, ma'am. I'm looking
for Dan and Mikey.

355
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:22,460
Both of 'em up to Chino.
Doin' a nickel apiece.

356
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,521
Now I'm not so sure
I want to tell you who this is.

357
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:27,863
- Yeah, try it, asshole.
- You sound very busy right now.

358
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:30,199
You sound very, very busy.

359
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:35,901
Whew. There's
only two names left.

360
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:39,742
Yeah? Let me see.

361
00:28:39,814 --> 00:28:41,839
<i>Those two? No way.</i>

362
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,850
There's no one else.

363
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:46,614
Are you sure?

364
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:50,146
- You tell him.
- Listen, why should I...

365
00:28:50,224 --> 00:28:52,419
- Come on!
- You were the one who answered the phone.

366
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:56,054
- Fine! Fine!
- But how's a guy who can't speak gonna take a phone call?

367
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,690
<i>You've got a call!</i>

368
00:29:14,482 --> 00:29:16,541
Sphinx, is that you?

369
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:19,177
Press a button if it's you.

370
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,458
Sway, you set up
this brake job?

371
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,794
<i>Yeah. He warped all four rotors.</i>

372
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:34,300
<i>Must've been ridin' those</i>
<i>brakes like an old lady.</i>

373
00:29:34,368 --> 00:29:37,599
- <i>That's nice.</i>
- Sounds like the left bank's running lean.

374
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:51,707
The service department's
over there.

375
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:55,448
- Can I talk to you?
- Talk to me? Yeah, sure, talk.

376
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:59,892
- The thing of it is, I came back because...
- Do you know what time it is?

377
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,054
It's 5:30.
I came back because...

378
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,065
I gotta go.
I'm late for work.

379
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:10,770
You're at work.

380
00:30:10,838 --> 00:30:13,773
I got two jobs.

381
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:19,643
I have discovered that you have
to work twice as hard when it's honest.

382
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,318
- Hey, Sway, can I get another shot?
- Yep.

383
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,880
Still lookin' amazing.

384
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,518
While you look
like a Bible salesman.

385
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:36,028
You're healed.

386
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:38,564
<i>Can we improvise</i>
<i>a little bit?</i>

387
00:30:38,632 --> 00:30:41,533
Sure. What do you have in mind?
Wanna get a little crazy?

388
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:44,594
There's a Cutlass 442 in the back
we can strip down and shine the hood.

389
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:48,267
- What do you say?
- Uh, that's not what I had in mind.

390
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:50,333
No?

391
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:53,005
It's about my brother.

392
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,207
- Kip's in trouble.
- I n trouble?

393
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:57,512
- Took a boost, and he blew it.
- Shit.

394
00:30:57,585 --> 00:31:01,351
And you got some Italians?

395
00:31:01,422 --> 00:31:03,822
- Five or six.
- <i>Right.</i>

396
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:07,349
It's 50 ladies in 24 hours,
$200,000.

397
00:31:07,428 --> 00:31:10,056
Well, I've cleaned up.

398
00:31:14,802 --> 00:31:17,635
I understand. I hate
to even come here and ask...

399
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:19,764
Sway, can I get
that drink now, please?

400
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,867
I had to ask a few of the others too,
and I feel bad about it, but...

401
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:27,243
- But you had no choice. You had to come here...
- Pretty much.

402
00:31:27,314 --> 00:31:30,249
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

403
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:35,914
I'd love to help Kip,
but I-I'm not into the life anymore.

404
00:31:37,992 --> 00:31:40,324
Well, that's a good thing.

405
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:44,228
- Yeah.
- I'm glad to see you're doing well.

406
00:31:44,298 --> 00:31:46,493
Sorry, I can't help you.

407
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:50,059
- I'd like to pay for your drink.
- That's fine.

408
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:54,503
How about that drink?

409
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:57,169
Yeah, how about that drink?

410
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:02,180
<i>Raines!</i>
<i>Memphis Raines, huh?</i>

411
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:04,274
- Do I know you?
- <i>Well, you should know me...</i>

412
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:08,811
considering all the business you done
screwed up for me in the past, baby.

413
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:11,357
- Johnny B.
- That's me.

414
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:13,393
What can I do for you?

415
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,224
Well, I'm gonna tell you
what you can do for me, baby.

416
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:19,060
Get out of Long Beach, tonight.

417
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:21,601
I'll be gone in three days.
I'm just here on some family business.

418
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:25,765
Word on the street says Raymond Calitri
hired you and your brother...

419
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,036
for a top order, a order
that should've went to me.

420
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:31,805
That's not the way
it went down, Johnny.

421
00:32:43,857 --> 00:32:48,260
Hey! Get away
from my car, asshole!

422
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,178
<i>Got somethin' to say</i>
<i>before I kill you, fool?</i>

423
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:29,027
Sphinx. Otto send you?

424
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:48,646
Oh, Dad.

425
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:52,283
We'd probably both be working
at the dealership if he hadn't died,

426
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,987
just like normal people.

427
00:33:55,062 --> 00:33:56,723
Shit.

428
00:34:01,702 --> 00:34:04,170
What's the matter with you?

429
00:34:04,238 --> 00:34:08,368
Eh, six years does
a lot of different things to people.

430
00:34:08,442 --> 00:34:11,570
<i>You know, I don't know</i>
<i>where you went, but...</i>

431
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:14,671
you know, you're in there,
you're talking about being normal...

432
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:17,876
<i>I mean, you were always the one</i>
<i>who was goin' after the easy money.</i>

433
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:25,391
I didn't do it
for the money.

434
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:30,760
I did it for the cars.

435
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:35,298
Gleaming in marina blue,

436
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:37,860
sunfire yellow,

437
00:34:37,938 --> 00:34:39,929
Marlboro red.

438
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:43,704
<i>Begging to be plucked.</i>

439
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:47,577
And I'd do it.

440
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:50,481
I'd boost her...

441
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:53,543
and just blast
to Palm Springs,

442
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,181
instantly feeling better
about being me.

443
00:34:57,257 --> 00:35:01,057
<i>And then the next day,</i>
<i>it seems like,</i>

444
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:05,155
<i>I'm getting shot at,</i>
<i>my friends are dying,</i>

445
00:35:05,232 --> 00:35:07,223
<i>people are going to jail.</i>

446
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:10,270
I didn't like
what I'd become.

447
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:16,407
Yeah, and then you left,

448
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:19,912
and then I didn't
have a brother anymore,

449
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,040
<i>and now you want</i>
<i>to give me advice...</i>

450
00:35:23,116 --> 00:35:25,414
<i>and I don't even know you.</i>

451
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:28,977
<i>And, you know, I got my own family now,</i>
<i>I got my own friends.</i>

452
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:32,082
And you can say what you want
about them, but they're loyal.

453
00:35:34,294 --> 00:35:37,821
Well, when you hit the wall,
the same thing's gonna happen.

454
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:40,890
You and your family...

455
00:35:40,968 --> 00:35:44,165
<i>are either</i>
<i>gonna get shot...</i>

456
00:35:44,238 --> 00:35:47,332
or get a five-year
jolt at Corcoran.

457
00:35:57,651 --> 00:36:01,610
<i>Those Mercedes we impounded?</i>
<i>Need those newfangled laser-cut keys.</i>

458
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:04,623
Each one's from Dressner Foreign Motors
downtown Newport...

459
00:36:04,691 --> 00:36:07,182
where all the employees
are clean, except for him.

460
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:11,197
James Lakewood. Served a nickel
at Folsom for auto insurance fraud.

461
00:36:11,265 --> 00:36:16,532
My gosh, I bet he just neglected to mention that
to the people at Dressner Foreign Motors, huh?

462
00:36:16,603 --> 00:36:19,663
It gets better. Young James there
places orders for lost keys...

463
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,335
to the Mercedes
home office in Germany.

464
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:30,850
The list.

465
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:34,752
The list. I guess we gotta start beating
the bushes and try to find out where they...

466
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:38,257
- Whoa! 1967 Shelby GT-500.
- <i>I know. I know.</i>

467
00:36:38,325 --> 00:36:41,783
- You got Eleanor here?
- Otto, there's somebody here to see you.

468
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,124
<i>Oh, the puppy's</i>
<i>a big dog now!</i>

469
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:50,295
- <i>How are you doin'?</i>
- Hey there, Kip, what is this... What's that up under there?

470
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,861
Hey, Otto, how you doin'?

471
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,999
It's a long time.
Good to see you.

472
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:57,441
What are you
doin' here, Kip?

473
00:36:57,511 --> 00:37:00,969
- Well, we actually came to talk about some things.
- About what?

474
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:04,108
Well, you know, it seems like
you guys need a little help,

475
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:06,482
<i>and we thought</i>
<i>that we should participate.</i>

476
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:08,521
But I just promised Mom
I was getting you out of this.

477
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:10,818
No, no, we're talking
about a lot of money here.

478
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:13,724
- And if you guys think you're gonna
get into our Kool-Aid... - - What? Money?

479
00:37:13,794 --> 00:37:16,627
Is that why you think I'm doing this,
you inconsiderate little punk!

480
00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:20,133
If you wanna participate, well, then
you call Mom and you explain to her...

481
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,431
<i>Can you explain how you are gonna</i>
<i>steal 50 cars in two days?</i>

482
00:37:23,503 --> 00:37:26,802
Hey. Hey.

483
00:37:26,873 --> 00:37:29,808
This is why I do not
do business with family.

484
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:32,436
I think you should
consider this.

485
00:37:32,512 --> 00:37:36,107
Oh, come on, Otto, please. No, his
criminal career has come to an end.

486
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:39,084
Well, his life will come to an end
unless we pull this off.

487
00:37:39,152 --> 00:37:42,349
How can we do it without them?
It can't be done, and you know it.

488
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:48,560
You guys have
any skills at all?

489
00:37:48,628 --> 00:37:51,188
- Please!
- Yeah, we have skills.

490
00:37:51,264 --> 00:37:54,665
We... Mirror Man here,
he's an electronics expert.

491
00:37:54,735 --> 00:37:58,102
You know, he's got some gadgets that...
that you old farts probably never heard of.

492
00:37:58,171 --> 00:38:02,073
You know, uh, Tumbler over here, he can
pretty much drive anything with wheels...

493
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:04,508
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>some things without wheels.</i>

494
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:07,513
And, uh, and Toby,
he's a computer genius.

495
00:38:07,581 --> 00:38:10,550
He's... He does fascinating
things with computers.

496
00:38:10,617 --> 00:38:13,450
What exactly can you do
with a computer, Toby?

497
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,511
I can hack
into the D.M.V. Mainframe.

498
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:19,389
<i>I can change VIN numbers.</i>
<i>I can change addresses, registrations.</i>

499
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:21,791
I can do a lot
of really tricky stuff. I can.

500
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:25,059
All right, all right.
We do this, we do it my way.

501
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:27,532
I run the show.
You take your orders from me.

502
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:29,694
If you have any problems
with that, you can leave now.

503
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,761
No, that's fine.
That's fine.

504
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:35,706
- Well, who is Gilligan here, and what does he do?
- <i>Gilligan is actually Freb.</i>

505
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,540
- Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business.
- What?

506
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:42,241
- <i>It's true.</i>
- Hey, people gotta eat, right?

507
00:38:44,117 --> 00:38:47,416
This is outrageous.
I want my lawyer.

508
00:38:47,487 --> 00:38:50,513
I'm not saying a word
till I get a lawyer.

509
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,024
All right, James,
that's an option.

510
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:55,459
And frankly,
a reasonable one.

511
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:57,463
So you call
your lawyer, James.

512
00:38:57,531 --> 00:39:00,728
You tell him you've been arrested
on suspicion of grand theft auto.

513
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:02,826
- <i>We indict you.</i>
- He'll bail you out.

514
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:06,839
- And we move on to trial.
- Okay, okay.

515
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:11,503
A kid came to me,
said he'd pay $500 a key.

516
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:16,447
So I put the order forms through, and
he picked 'em up a couple days later.

517
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:20,247
- What's the kid's name?
- We kept it anonymous.

518
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,156
He was a well-built kid.
Uh, looks like a boxer.

519
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:29,821
- What do you want me to do?
- When he comes back, you call us.

520
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:33,627
- What says he comes back?
- A hunch.

521
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:37,259
To make the Friday 8:00 a.m. Deadline,
you're gonna have to go old school.

522
00:39:37,337 --> 00:39:41,671
A one-night boost.
Put all your nuts in one basket, okay?

523
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:44,369
- One night? What, are you crazy?
- <i>Yes. No, I'm not crazy.</i>

524
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:46,878
- What, do you have like a better plan or something'?
- Yeah, you spread it out.

525
00:39:46,947 --> 00:39:49,973
- You play shadow games and shit.
- We're on a truncated timetable.

526
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,042
Otto, I'm sorry. Can you just listen
to me for one second, all right?

527
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,453
<i>We heard you, Kip. Shadow games.</i>
<i>But what you have to understand...</i>

528
00:39:56,523 --> 00:40:00,186
is that if you play shadow games, by
the second night, the heat is onto you.

529
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,821
With a one-night boost, by the time
the first car's reported stolen,

530
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:07,196
your ship's set sail;
it's a surprise attack.

531
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:11,704
This is a complicated list,
fellas, it really is, okay?

532
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:14,399
<i>There are 25</i>
<i>that aren't a problem,</i>

533
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:16,635
but these exotics
are tough to find.

534
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,474
And the new Mercedes,
they require laser-cut keys, okay?

535
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:22,913
- Yeah, I got that covered.
- You have that covered?

536
00:40:22,983 --> 00:40:25,247
- What'd I just say? Yeah, I got it covered.
- Yeah.

537
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:27,912
All right, all right.
Well, then let's get to work.

538
00:40:27,988 --> 00:40:30,149
<i>Toby, hack into</i>
<i>the insurance database...</i>

539
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:32,157
<i>and find as many cars</i>
<i>as you can.</i>

540
00:40:32,225 --> 00:40:36,355
<i>Yes! I got addresses</i>
<i>on Hillary, Natalie and Tracy.</i>

541
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:39,921
<i>Donny, check the D.M.V.For</i>
<i>the remaining cars on the list.</i>

542
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,264
<i>I'm sorry, miss, but you've</i>
<i>missed five questions.</i>

543
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:45,361
- <i>That's a failing.</i>
- No!

544
00:40:45,438 --> 00:40:47,804
- <i>Next.</i>
- No! Why?

545
00:40:47,874 --> 00:40:50,900
You're supposed to go faster
when somebody tailgates you.

546
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:52,911
- Ah. Hello again.
- <i>Mm-hmm. Here's your list...</i>

547
00:40:52,979 --> 00:40:55,914
of the 20 car owners' names and
addresses that you requested.

548
00:40:55,982 --> 00:40:58,177
- Thank you.
- That's $100, please.

549
00:40:58,251 --> 00:41:00,947
- A hundred dollars?
- Well, five dollars a car.

550
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:03,455
Twenty cars.
Would you like a calculator?

551
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:06,720
It used to be two dollars a car.
Thanks a lot.

552
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:10,854
My name's Roger, sir.
May I be of some help?

553
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:16,334
That's funny, my name's Roger.
Two Rogers don't make a right.

554
00:41:16,403 --> 00:41:19,338
- Roger, I have a problem.
- Yes?

555
00:41:19,406 --> 00:41:22,375
I've been in L.A. For three months now.
I have money, I have taste.

556
00:41:22,442 --> 00:41:24,569
But I'm not
on anybody's "A" list,

557
00:41:24,644 --> 00:41:27,579
and Saturday night is the
loneliest night of the week for me.

558
00:41:27,647 --> 00:41:30,741
- Oh. A Ferrari would certainly change that.
- Perhaps. Mmm.

559
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:33,752
But, you know, this is the one.
Yes, yes, yes.

560
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,586
I saw three of these parked outside
the local Starbucks this morning,

561
00:41:37,657 --> 00:41:39,591
which tells me
only one thing.

562
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:43,959
There's too many self-indulgent wieners
in this city with too much bloody money!

563
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,965
Now, if I was driving...

564
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:51,402
a 1967275 GTB four-cam...

565
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:54,406
You would not be
a self-indulgent weiner, sir.

566
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:56,908
- You'd be a connoisseur.
- Precisely.

567
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:59,172
Champagne would fall
from the heavens.

568
00:41:59,246 --> 00:42:02,079
Doors would open.
Velvet ropes would part.

569
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:04,446
I don't have one here,

570
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:07,111
however I do have one
in the warehouse.

571
00:42:07,187 --> 00:42:09,121
Superb.

572
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:11,282
What else do you have
in the warehouse?

573
00:42:11,424 --> 00:42:14,882
<i>Mm-hmm. All right.</i>
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

574
00:42:16,763 --> 00:42:18,856
That was Mr. Lakewood
from the dealership.

575
00:42:18,932 --> 00:42:21,162
<i>He says that boxer-looking punk</i>
<i>is gonna pick up the keys...</i>

576
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,429
to three new Mercedes today.

577
00:42:23,503 --> 00:42:26,301
Same make and models
as the ones we already got impounded.

578
00:42:26,373 --> 00:42:31,003
Now we're talkin'.

579
00:42:31,077 --> 00:42:33,944
The <i>El Spirito</i>
<i>de Graciela...</i>

580
00:42:34,014 --> 00:42:37,973
sails Friday,
8:00 a.m. Sharp.

581
00:42:38,051 --> 00:42:41,543
We'll target all the cars
within 45 minutes of here.

582
00:42:41,621 --> 00:42:44,681
<i>By the time their alarm</i>
<i>tracking systems are activated,</i>

583
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:47,989
<i>the cars will already be</i>
<i>in these containers.</i>

584
00:42:55,902 --> 00:42:59,133
Fellas, this is Sway.

585
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:01,730
No questions.
I'm here for Kip.

586
00:43:01,808 --> 00:43:03,901
- All right.
- <i>All right.</i>

587
00:43:20,126 --> 00:43:22,560
- It's me. He's here.
- The red Chevy Nova?

588
00:43:22,629 --> 00:43:25,564
That's affirmative, sir.

589
00:43:25,632 --> 00:43:29,068
As soon as he leaves, you call me
with the owners' addresses, all right?

590
00:43:29,135 --> 00:43:32,070
I'll get those forms
right over, sir.

591
00:43:32,138 --> 00:43:36,006
Damn boss.
Always on my case.

592
00:43:36,076 --> 00:43:38,840
- I got three here?
- Mm-hmm.

593
00:43:38,912 --> 00:43:41,142
Thank you.

594
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:57,525
<i>Huh, Randall Raines,</i>
<i>Donny Astricky, Otto Halliwell.</i>

595
00:43:57,597 --> 00:43:59,690
Should I set up
some tails?

596
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:01,859
Uh-uh. They're
too smart for that.

597
00:44:01,935 --> 00:44:04,028
They'll just
dump the cars.

598
00:44:04,104 --> 00:44:06,664
No, we'll get them
with the Mercedes.

599
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,767
Let's set up, uh, three surveillance
teams at those addresses.

600
00:44:13,113 --> 00:44:15,775
You go ahead and you
make your move, man.

601
00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:18,579
And I will
be waiting for you.

602
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,883
Why do you call 'em
girls' names?

603
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:29,087
That's a good question.
Why <i>do</i> you call 'em girls' names?

604
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:33,758
<i>It's code. You say Jane,</i>
<i>you say Shirley, Lucy, Edna,</i>

605
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:37,496
and nobody listening
on the waves is the wiser.

606
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,538
Got 'em.

607
00:44:44,244 --> 00:44:46,906
Okay.

608
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:52,748
All right, we've got the addresses
on all 50 ladies. Let's scout 'em.

609
00:44:57,891 --> 00:45:01,292
- There she is.
- Nice.

610
00:45:01,361 --> 00:45:04,296
Damn, it's cold up here!
They keep these Ferraris refrigerated?

611
00:45:04,364 --> 00:45:07,299
And you know black people don't like
cold weather! We're tropical people, man.

612
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:09,733
When this is over,
I'm gonna smoke a joint,

613
00:45:09,803 --> 00:45:12,499
watch two hours of <i>Roots</i>,
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

614
00:45:12,572 --> 00:45:16,599
Hello, and welcome
to <i>TV Car Trivia.</i>

615
00:45:16,676 --> 00:45:20,271
First question: Who was
the driver of a '73 Firebird?

616
00:45:20,346 --> 00:45:22,837
- <i>Uh, Otto?</i>
- Uh, Jim Rockford, <i>Rockford Files</i>.

617
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:25,441
Give me <i>Columbo</i>.

618
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:27,713
- A Peugeot convertible.
- What color?

619
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:30,221
- Grey.
- How'd you know that?

620
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,258
'Cause I love that show.

621
00:45:32,325 --> 00:45:35,089
I got three words
for all of y'all. Get a life!

622
00:45:35,161 --> 00:45:37,527
Ah, this is some kiddie shit, Sphinx.

623
00:45:37,597 --> 00:45:40,395
What's on Magnum P.I.'s
license plate?

624
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:42,401
<i>"Robin 1."</i>

625
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:45,199
<i>Wait. Wasn't Robin that</i>
<i>faggoty guy who hung with him?</i>

626
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:47,796
No, that was Higgins.
That was Higgins.

627
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:49,899
Hey, hey, ten points
for our fearless leader.

628
00:45:49,976 --> 00:45:52,968
<i>Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor</i>
<i>of the Bill Bixby trifecta?</i>

629
00:45:56,483 --> 00:45:59,179
<i>He drove a Corvette in</i> The Magician<i>,</i>

630
00:45:59,252 --> 00:46:02,380
<i>A Ford pickup truck</i>
<i>in</i> The Incredible Hulk<i>,</i>

631
00:46:02,455 --> 00:46:06,152
<i>and in</i> The Courtship
of Eddie's Father<i>, he walked.</i>

632
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:14,066
- Bingo.
- My man.

633
00:46:27,313 --> 00:46:30,146
<i>Al, tell me something.</i>

634
00:46:30,216 --> 00:46:32,582
Nothin' doing here, sir.
Nobody's showing.

635
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:34,415
Copy.

636
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:36,478
Minivan approaching.

637
00:46:36,556 --> 00:46:39,047
<i>It seems a little late</i>
<i>for soccer practice.</i>

638
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:44,855
Heads up. I think we got
some activity right here.

639
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:53,066
<i>Oh, that is...</i>
<i>Looks like it's Kip Raines,</i>

640
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:55,266
<i>and we got a Randall Raines.</i>

641
00:46:55,341 --> 00:46:59,004
If they take this,
we will take them down.

642
00:46:59,078 --> 00:47:02,309
<i>He's pulling something</i>
<i>out of his pocket. You see that?</i>

643
00:47:02,382 --> 00:47:05,408
<i>It's a camera. Looks like</i>
<i>he's just doing some homework.</i>

644
00:47:05,485 --> 00:47:07,578
<i>All right,</i>
<i>let's leave him be.</i>

645
00:47:07,654 --> 00:47:10,452
I don't wanna burn this.
They will be back.

646
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:15,090
<i>Huh.</i>

647
00:47:15,161 --> 00:47:18,062
You know what? Let's go over
to Otto's in the morning.

648
00:47:18,131 --> 00:47:21,623
Kick over some rocks,
see what's underneath there.

649
00:47:21,701 --> 00:47:24,329
We saved the best for last.

650
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:27,931
The '67 Shelby Mustang GT-500.

651
00:47:28,007 --> 00:47:31,499
- The GT-500?
- Yeah, yeah.

652
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:37,881
There she is.

653
00:47:37,951 --> 00:47:41,751
<i>Yep, there's Eleanor.</i>

654
00:47:43,222 --> 00:47:45,952
Eleanor is Memphis's unicorn.

655
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:48,755
- What's a unicorn?
- Fabled creature.

656
00:47:48,828 --> 00:47:52,662
You know, the horse with the horn,
impossible to capture.

657
00:47:52,732 --> 00:47:56,600
<i>It's the one car, no matter how many times
you try to boost, something always happens.</i>

658
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:05,102
We're gonna get through this this time,
right? It's gonna be smooth...

659
00:48:05,178 --> 00:48:07,373
- What's he doing?
- <i>And easy.</i>

660
00:48:07,447 --> 00:48:11,178
He's talkin' to her, man.
Tryin' to get reacquainted.

661
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:15,050
<i>Done had a rough history. She almost</i>
<i>got him killed a couple of times.</i>

662
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:17,851
- I don't want any talking back.
- <i>He flipped one on the Harbor freeway.</i>

663
00:48:17,924 --> 00:48:20,154
He went off
the Long Beach pier once.

664
00:48:20,226 --> 00:48:22,660
A smooth, easy ride.

665
00:48:24,263 --> 00:48:26,231
We're just gonna glide.

666
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:32,063
Big night tomorrow, guys.
Let's go home.

667
00:48:33,473 --> 00:48:36,203
- Did you... Did you get the picture?
- Yeah.

668
00:48:36,275 --> 00:48:40,041
See you tomorrow night,
Eleanor, with your fine ass.

669
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:46,881
Man, we're almost home.
You wanna get something to eat?

670
00:48:46,953 --> 00:48:49,387
<i>I'd like to get</i>
<i>a chocolate malt.</i>

671
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:03,897
- Hey!
- Get out of the car!

672
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,268
Go, go, go, go, go!

673
00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:12,110
Why are people shooting at us?

674
00:49:12,178 --> 00:49:15,113
'Cause I blew up their car!

675
00:49:35,435 --> 00:49:37,699
Over here!

676
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:45,533
"Beast."

677
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:48,136
Okay, okay.

678
00:49:51,884 --> 00:49:54,819
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

679
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:57,617
Hey!

680
00:50:05,164 --> 00:50:09,260
Oh!

681
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:42,395
<i>Oh, you...</i>
<i>you think it's a game?</i>

682
00:50:42,468 --> 00:50:45,494
Johnny B.
Cops, man.

683
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:48,540
<i>I ain't got nothin' but time, baby.</i>

684
00:50:59,452 --> 00:51:02,478
Oh, man, we're gonna
be here all night, man.

685
00:51:03,956 --> 00:51:07,050
Look! Cop car! Uh-huh.

686
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:11,995
Long as I'm in here, you're just gonna
sit out there, aren't ya? Aye?

687
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:17,228
Hey, listen,
this is the plan.

688
00:51:17,303 --> 00:51:19,897
This is what we're gonna do.
There's a big rig over there.

689
00:51:23,276 --> 00:51:27,235
Uh, mister, is that your truck
out there, the Big Rig Wrecker?

690
00:51:27,313 --> 00:51:29,281
- Big Rig Wrecker's mine.
- That's cool.

691
00:51:43,396 --> 00:51:46,331
What do I gotta do?
How do I learn? Where do I go?

692
00:51:46,399 --> 00:51:48,629
- Well, you gotta go to truck drivin' school.
- Truck dri...

693
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:51,363
I know, man. I know.
But I mean like, um... -

694
00:51:51,437 --> 00:51:55,931
- You boys ready to play
a little pin the tail on the donkey?

695
00:51:56,008 --> 00:51:58,841
- Can I get you a jelly donut or something, man?
- No, I'm just gonna go.

696
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:02,745
- 'Cause I'm gonna have a waffle.
- Maybe next time, though.

697
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:25,969
I'm gonna smoke you!

698
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:41,784
What the hell's going on?

699
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:45,821
Want some of this?

700
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:47,826
Yeah.

701
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:53,560
- You guys got permits for these weapons?
- Oh, man!

702
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:16,585
So you think I can only
get pizzas, huh? Boosted it myself.

703
00:53:16,656 --> 00:53:19,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How'd you get it?

704
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:22,624
- Actually, the keys were in it.
- <i>Oh, well, that kind of defies the point then, don't it?</i>

705
00:53:22,695 --> 00:53:25,220
You stole a car
that wasn't on the list.

706
00:53:25,298 --> 00:53:27,960
You stole a car
that wasn't on the list!

707
00:53:28,034 --> 00:53:30,901
Why didn't you just go to the
police station in a red clown suit...

708
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,904
and let everybody know
what we're doin' here?

709
00:53:32,972 --> 00:53:37,238
- What have we got?
- I don't know.

710
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,107
Shit! Fellas.

711
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:41,373
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Gimme that.</i>
- <i>Check this out.</i>

712
00:53:41,447 --> 00:53:45,349
- Check this out!
- Let me see that. This looks like heroin.

713
00:53:45,418 --> 00:53:47,545
- Yeah. -
What! - Exactly.

714
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:52,417
- Where did you get this car?
- I n front of some poker parlor in Chinatown.

715
00:53:52,491 --> 00:53:54,516
Did you ever consider why a car
in a neighborhood like that...

716
00:53:54,593 --> 00:53:56,584
- <i>would have its keys left in it?</i>
- No.

717
00:53:56,662 --> 00:53:59,529
Maybe because nobody in that neighborhood
would be stupid enough to rip this car off.

718
00:53:59,598 --> 00:54:02,192
- All right. Get this shit outta here. Take it back.
- No, no. We can't take it back.

719
00:54:02,268 --> 00:54:04,031
- Get it outta here!
- Will everybody relax for a second?

720
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:07,504
Take it back!

721
00:54:10,343 --> 00:54:12,072
I'm comin' after that shit.
Gimme that.

722
00:54:12,144 --> 00:54:15,841
No!

723
00:54:15,915 --> 00:54:18,645
Man, I will knock the shit out of you.

724
00:54:18,718 --> 00:54:21,846
- <i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>
- Who is it?

725
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:25,288
- Detective Castlebeck.
- Oh. Christ.

726
00:54:38,704 --> 00:54:41,036
Goddamn it.

727
00:54:41,107 --> 00:54:45,203
- Hey, hello, Otto.
- Detective. Good to see you.

728
00:54:45,277 --> 00:54:48,576
- <i>Long time.</i>
- <i>Yeah. You're lookin' good.</i>

729
00:54:48,647 --> 00:54:51,047
Thank you.

730
00:54:51,117 --> 00:54:53,381
So Randall,
what do we got here?

731
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:56,580
We got a multigenerational
gathering of players?

732
00:54:56,655 --> 00:54:58,282
- <i>Is that what we got here?</i>
- Right.

733
00:54:58,357 --> 00:55:00,723
Here's Donny.

734
00:55:00,793 --> 00:55:03,591
- How you been, D?
- I'm just happy to see you, brother.

735
00:55:03,662 --> 00:55:09,032
Yeah. I gotta tell you, Randall.
Seeing you here, Otto, Donny,

736
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:11,262
makes me feel
almost nostalgic.

737
00:55:11,337 --> 00:55:13,965
Kind of like
a big reunion.

738
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,406
You should stick around,
'cause a little later we're gonna...

739
00:55:16,475 --> 00:55:19,239
make s'mores
and sing "Kumbayah."

740
00:55:21,647 --> 00:55:25,208
- What is this?
- What? They call this a Cadillac.

741
00:55:25,284 --> 00:55:27,775
Yeah.

742
00:55:27,853 --> 00:55:29,480
- What's wrong with it, Otto?
- Rest...

743
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:31,819
- <i>Needs restoration.</i>
- What?

744
00:55:31,891 --> 00:55:34,587
- Brightening.
- Otto.

745
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,925
- You got a '39 Ford right there.
- That's a pretty car.

746
00:55:37,997 --> 00:55:41,626
- Isn't that a nice car?
- Yeah. Right here you got a '53 Fiat Vignale.

747
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:46,103
<i>Now, these are beautiful cars, Otto.</i>
<i>And here we got a '83 Cadillac Eldorado.</i>

748
00:55:46,172 --> 00:55:48,732
- Yeah.
- I mean, who the hell pays...

749
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:52,039
to brighten up
a Cadillac Eldorado?

750
00:55:52,111 --> 00:55:55,512
I think it holds a certain
sentimental value, you know.

751
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:58,175
<i>Nothing more.</i>

752
00:55:59,785 --> 00:56:01,878

That is Harold, Randall, Otto,

No faith in our newfound
goodness, Detective? Huh?

756
00:56:21,574 --> 00:56:25,010
Task force runs on statistics
and numbers, Otto. You know that.

757
00:56:25,077 --> 00:56:28,308
- <i>Randall, this Kip?</i>
- That's my brother.

Thank you.

763
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:44,291
See, I know what you're doin'.
I know.

764
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:47,992
You're thinkin' there's no want,
but that I stripped its guts...

765
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:50,194
and crated her up, right?

766
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:52,294
Is that what you did,
Randall?

767
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:55,169
No. I didn't do it. You know, you're
trying to hurt my feelings? Fine.

768
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:57,175
You know what? Go ahead.
Do it. Let her rip.

769
00:56:57,243 --> 00:57:00,269
- Go ahead, rev it up.
- All right, goddamn it. I will.

770
00:57:00,346 --> 00:57:02,405
Sell it to you cheap.

771
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:05,644
Yeah. '83. First year they
put the auto-ride control on these boys.

772
00:57:05,718 --> 00:57:09,381
Oh, I don't know. You probably know
more about cars at this point than I do.

773
00:57:09,455 --> 00:57:13,414
- You slippin' on me, Randall?
- No, it's just your knowledge overwhelms me.

774
00:57:13,492 --> 00:57:16,723
- It's got a real nice-sounding engine.
Right, Otto? - Four point one liter.

775
00:57:16,795 --> 00:57:19,593
- Digital fuel injection?
- You got it. You're the man.

776

Give it some more.

00:57:28,807 --> 00:57:31,071
- Yeah, that's it!
- Go, go!

Yeah, that's it!

- Yeah, you break it, you buy it, my friend.

<i>Yeah, she got some power goin' on.</i>

All right.

00:57:53,032 --> 00:57:54,966
I'll catch you later.

783
00:58:11,684 --> 00:58:13,618
- It's on for tonight.
- How do you know?

784
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:19,184
They got the call signs
on all the units working tonight.

785

- Wh-What were you gonna do with this?
- I was gonna bonk him.

786

Bonk?
For the next 24 hours,

it. - Yeah, that's cool.

Obviously they're onto us.
He's sniffin' real close.

If anything tonight
appears out of place,

791
00:58:38,944 --> 00:58:41,412
I want you to cut bait,
get out of there and walk away.

792
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,778
And get rid of this

- What's up, Kip?
- Bobby, what are you doin'?

794

You think you're comin'
with us, but you're not.

What are you talkin' about, man?
I'm part of the team. I get to go.

00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:58,728
No, no, wake up. Gonna end up in the jail
or the morgue or some shit. Don't be stupid.

797
00:58:58,797 --> 00:59:00,958
What am I supposed to do?

798
00:59:01,033 --> 00:59:03,365
Did you see a box
of rubber gloves here, man?

799
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:08,202
Gloves? Man, you don't need gloves.
This is the new age. Check this out.

800
00:59:08,274 --> 00:59:11,368
- What is this?
- Let me just see that big claw you call a hand.

801
00:59:12,978 --> 00:59:14,809
That's not doughnut jelly,
so don't eat it.

802

Your new fingerprints.
Elvis is back.

01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,493
Find a way to get in here.
Get this...

816
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:20,504
I tell you, I'm runnin' this shit!
You do that again, I will kick...

817

Cool, man. You don't have
to take it so damn personal.

Ah. Everything is perfect.

- Where are you?
- Where do you think I am?

877
01:07:54,244 --> 01:07:57,179
I'm at the casino, picking up
pit boss's lady. What do you want?

878
01:07:57,247 --> 01:08:01,377
- The ladies are dirty. Walk away. The ladies are dirty.
- What?

879
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:04,113
I want everybody to get back
to the garage now.

880

Oh, so she's havin'
a baby right now?

881
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,249
I guess I better get
to the hospital then, huh?

882
01:08:09,325 --> 01:08:11,020
Something's got him spooked.

883
01:08:11,094 --> 01:08:13,790
My wife is havin' a baby.
Gotta get...

884
01:08:13,863 --> 01:08:16,457
I'm nervous! This ain't even my car!
Way over here...

885
01:08:17,767 --> 01:08:19,701
He's heading away
from the vehicle.

886
01:08:21,604 --> 01:08:23,868
I see you.

887
01:08:29,445 --> 01:08:31,879
Pull in over there.

888
01:08:44,894 --> 01:08:48,796
- Hello.
This is unit two. I lost them.

889
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:56,167
<i>All right, it's time</i>
<i>to talk to Fuzzy again.</i>

890
01:08:57,941 --> 01:09:01,308
<i>Check this out. Laser-encoded keys
that send a message to a receiver...</i>

891
01:09:01,377 --> 01:09:03,106
inside the car.

892
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:05,670
You wanna tell me
what you're doin' with these?

893
01:09:05,748 --> 01:09:08,581
Yeah. These are from last week.
These are from the other boost.

894
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:18,189
Who is it?

895
01:09:19,562 --> 01:09:23,896
- <i>The keys, the keys, the keys!</i>
- <i>Take it easy!</i>

896
01:09:23,967 --> 01:09:25,992
- <i>Now gimme this!</i>
- What happened? What happened?

897
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:28,196
- Where'd you get these from?
- <i>What's the problem?</i>

898
01:09:28,271 --> 01:09:31,206
The Mercedes are dirty!
There's surveillance vans all over them.

899
01:09:31,274 --> 01:09:34,675
- Where'd they come from?
- Whoa. My guy in Southland. The same guy I used last time.

900
01:09:34,744 --> 01:09:36,939
- Same guy I used before.
- Before when?

901
01:09:37,013 --> 01:09:39,641
- When we... When we took the other cars.
- Other Mercedes.

902
01:09:39,716 --> 01:09:43,015
- Christ.
- Castlebeck.

903
01:09:43,086 --> 01:09:46,385
He got to one of the guys at the dealership,
and he turned him. That's what happened.

904
01:09:46,456 --> 01:09:49,220
Eight hours left.

905
01:09:49,292 --> 01:09:52,819
So what, we're gonna stand around and
have a meeting? Wh-What's goin' on?

906
01:09:52,895 --> 01:09:56,797
Memphis, maybe it's time for us
to start thinking about...

907
01:09:56,866 --> 01:10:00,859
- how to get these young kids
out of town, 'cause...

908
01:10:00,937 --> 01:10:05,340
If there's no Mercedes, there's no point
in boosting any other cars. You hear me?

909
01:10:05,408 --> 01:10:09,139
- That's it.
- 47 is not 50, Memphis. You know that's what he'll say.

910
01:10:09,212 --> 01:10:11,146
Yeah.

911
01:10:11,214 --> 01:10:15,480
<i>Hey, Memphis. You know, we still have</i>
<i>the Mercedes keys from the last boost.</i>

912
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:20,045
Hey! Those cars are
at the police impound.

913
01:10:20,123 --> 01:10:23,115
Okay? The police impound. You want
us to go there and start stealin' cars?

914
01:10:23,192 --> 01:10:26,161
- Yeah. - Yeah, let's do
it. - <i>You're crazy.</i>

915
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:30,666
- We're gonna get hectic. Let's go.
- No, Memphis, no. Don't do this.

916
01:10:30,733 --> 01:10:32,724
Hey, Sphinx, I don't look
suspicious, do I, man?

917
01:10:32,802 --> 01:10:36,169
<i>Otto, man, I think that</i>
<i>your dog ate the keys.</i>

918
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:39,572
He usually goes for the license plates.

919
01:10:39,642 --> 01:10:43,874
- Are you sure?
- What? Wait a minute. The dog ate the keys?

920
01:10:43,946 --> 01:10:47,677
- Yes.
How you gonna get them out?

921
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,581
- Not funny.
- I'm...

922
01:10:49,652 --> 01:10:52,086
- Hey, hey, don't even
think about it, Sphinx.

923
01:10:52,155 --> 01:10:54,419
It's all right.

924
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:57,891
Say, uh, Toby,

925
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,260
go see if you can get some,
uh, Alpo, and get some Ex-lax.

926
01:11:02,331 --> 01:11:04,799
- No way, man.
- Bad dog!

927
01:11:04,867 --> 01:11:07,358
- <i>Let's get back to work.</i>

928
01:11:22,251 --> 01:11:25,448
Hey! Open the door.

929
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:27,921
- <i>Ah, Jesus.</i>
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

930
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:30,458
- End it, rock star. Get in.
- Jesus Christ.

931
01:11:30,526 --> 01:11:34,553
Now what, man?
What else?

932
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:38,031
Fuzzy, you never called me.
So now we gotta stay down here...

933
01:11:38,101 --> 01:11:40,262
till you tell me everything
you know.

934
01:11:40,336 --> 01:11:42,702
I... I told you everything I know.
I know that,

935
01:11:42,772 --> 01:11:44,797
because I said,
"This is everything I know."

936
01:11:44,874 --> 01:11:49,470
Detective Drycoff, does it seem like the
suspect is violating his parole right now?

937
01:11:49,545 --> 01:11:52,412
<i>Why, yes, Detective Castlebeck,</i>
<i>if by violating his parole...</i>

938
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:55,042
you mean failing to cooperate
with a law enforcement officer.

939
01:12:01,224 --> 01:12:03,886
A little trick I learned in
the car thief retirement home.

940
01:12:04,994 --> 01:12:06,518
Can you hold this?

941
01:12:06,596 --> 01:12:09,929
No, no, no. I'm not failing
to cooperate. It's just that...

942
01:12:09,999 --> 01:12:13,127
Y-Y-Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Uh, word has it...

943
01:12:13,202 --> 01:12:17,969
that Kip Raines took the job and he
screwed up. Uh, he screwed up pretty bad.

944
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,235
And who put out
the order for the job?

945
01:12:23,112 --> 01:12:25,046
It's Raymond Calitri's order.

946
01:12:25,114 --> 01:12:27,309
<i>Nice.</i>

947
01:12:33,723 --> 01:12:35,554
<i>Come on, come on,</i>
<i>come on, come on.</i>

948
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:39,425
Yes.

949
01:12:42,698 --> 01:12:45,565
<i>We have six hours left.</i>
<i>Has the dog done its business yet?</i>

950
01:12:45,635 --> 01:12:47,569
Toby and Freb
are walking him right now.

951
01:12:47,637 --> 01:12:51,300
- He's not gonna go it.
It's not gonna happen, man.

952
01:12:51,374 --> 01:12:55,970
Come on, dog.
What's wrong, Hemi? Poop, dog.

953
01:12:58,614 --> 01:13:03,347
- It had to be a girl car.
- Girl car, what kind of a girl drives a Hemi 'Cuda?

954
01:13:03,419 --> 01:13:06,320
I'll show you.

955
01:13:06,389 --> 01:13:09,085
Lipstick?

956
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:12,821
Matches the car.

957
01:13:12,895 --> 01:13:16,922
- What's next? Blush? Mascara?
- <i>Next time...</i>

958
01:13:16,999 --> 01:13:21,459
I'll pull out the, uh, leather and
high heels and pink underwear for you.

959
01:13:21,537 --> 01:13:24,370
- Leather, high heels and pink underwear.
- Pink underwear.

960
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,000
- Pink underwear works.
Pink underwear works.

961
01:13:30,012 --> 01:13:34,779
<i>Raymond Vincent Calitri did five years</i>
<i>in South London for manslaughter.</i>

962
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:37,318
- He immigrated in '98.
- Look at this.

963
01:13:37,386 --> 01:13:42,187
Loan shark and extortion, fencing. Ha.
His front's a salvage yard.

964
01:14:01,177 --> 01:14:03,441
Gonna have to
wait it out.

965
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:09,242
So, you seeing anybody?

966
01:14:09,318 --> 01:14:13,277
No. No, I had
a girl once.

967
01:14:13,356 --> 01:14:18,851
- She was great.
- Mmm. So if she was so great, why'd you leave her?

968
01:14:39,415 --> 01:14:41,610
I did ask you
to come with me.

969
01:14:43,219 --> 01:14:46,848
No, you asked me
to be a different person.

970
01:14:46,922 --> 01:14:52,417
I didn't want to see people get hurt.
I just wanted you to slow down.

971
01:14:52,495 --> 01:14:54,929
Well, I couldn't.

972
01:14:54,997 --> 01:14:56,931
'Cause I wasn't ready.

973
01:14:58,401 --> 01:15:00,699
- You're straight now.
- Yeah, I am.

974
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:02,670
'Cause it wasn't the same
without you.

975
01:15:08,944 --> 01:15:11,879
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Hey, asshole. I was reading that.

976
01:15:11,947 --> 01:15:13,881
- Watch your mouth, kid.
- What's goin' on?

977
01:15:13,949 --> 01:15:16,509
- This is a homicide file from a homicide investigation.
- <i>All right.</i>

978
01:15:16,585 --> 01:15:19,247
It took us three months to get a
magistrate to give us a wiretap on 'em.

979
01:15:19,322 --> 01:15:24,726
<i>No other division, including GRAB, can go near
his person, residence or place of business.</i>

980
01:15:24,794 --> 01:15:27,228
All right? Got it?
Let me tell you guys something.

981
01:15:27,296 --> 01:15:32,063
All right. Raymond Calitri
is going down for murder one. Boneheads.

982
01:15:32,134 --> 01:15:35,900
Who gives a shit
about grand theft auto? Really.

983
01:15:37,306 --> 01:15:39,467
<i>I can't watch this.</i>

984
01:15:39,542 --> 01:15:42,636
Come on, come on, come on.
Get it on. Get it over with.

985
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:52,585
What do you think is more
exciting, having sex, or stealing cars?

986
01:15:52,655 --> 01:15:54,748
Having sex or boosting cars?

987
01:15:54,824 --> 01:15:57,258
<i>Um. Ooh!</i>

988
01:15:57,326 --> 01:15:59,260
Uh.

989
01:16:02,765 --> 01:16:05,928
<i>Well, uh, how about, uh...</i>

990
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:09,528
<i>having sex</i>
<i>while boosting cars?</i>

991
01:16:09,605 --> 01:16:11,971
God, that's
a good line.

992
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:16,603
<i>Oh, doesn't work on</i>
<i>a lot of girls, though.</i>

993
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:18,977
I just blurted it out.
I'm s...

994
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:23,614
But you haven't
answered the question.

995
01:16:23,686 --> 01:16:26,780
Well, you see,
the problem is,

996
01:16:26,856 --> 01:16:28,949
how do you get over
the shifter?

997
01:16:29,024 --> 01:16:32,824
- Oh. Oh, right. 'Cause the, uh...
- Because it gets in the way.

998
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:38,800
Because you wouldn't want to disrupt
the, uh, synchromesh. Right?

999
01:16:38,868 --> 01:16:41,302
Or the throttle linkage.

1000
01:16:47,476 --> 01:16:50,240
The clutch master cylinder.

1001
01:16:54,049 --> 01:16:56,142
Double overhead cam shaft.

1002
01:16:56,218 --> 01:17:01,815
- I can't do this.
- Wait, wait. Just straight in-line six,

1003
01:17:01,891 --> 01:17:03,620
triple Weber carburetors...

1004
01:17:03,692 --> 01:17:07,128
<i>Bolted to each other's</i>
<i>body structures.</i>

1005
01:17:10,232 --> 01:17:12,166
Oh, it's time to work.

1006
01:17:12,234 --> 01:17:16,227
Good brakes.
Good brakes too.

1007
01:17:30,152 --> 01:17:34,020
- There's nothin' happening.
- Maybe he's got indigestion.

1008
01:17:34,089 --> 01:17:37,490
- Well, dude, we'll give him some
more Ex-lax. - He already ate two.

1009
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,323
- <i>Hey, little man.</i>
- Oh, man.

1010
01:17:39,395 --> 01:17:44,765
I thought I told you this is our turf.
What, you wanna make a move?

1011
01:17:44,834 --> 01:17:46,768
We don't want anything
to do with your turf.

1012
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:48,736
<i>Something wrong with</i>
<i>where we live?</i>

1013
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:51,398
Oh, no, it's cool for you.
I mean, it's just not for us.

1014
01:17:51,474 --> 01:17:54,602
Oh, so now you think you're
better than us or something, huh?

1015
01:17:54,677 --> 01:17:57,373
- <i>Maybe we should cut you up, doll?</i>
- Um...

1016
01:17:57,446 --> 01:18:01,974
- Dude, the keys. Freb.
- Excuse me a second, guys.

1017
01:18:02,051 --> 01:18:05,612
<i>Man!</i>

1018
01:18:05,688 --> 01:18:08,782
- Aw, I'm gonna throw up, dog!
- Man, that's disgusting.

1019
01:18:08,858 --> 01:18:12,123
What kind of pervert gets their jollies
off playing with dog shit?

1020
01:18:12,194 --> 01:18:14,719
Look, man! I got 'em.
All three, man.

1021
01:18:14,797 --> 01:18:17,391
- You guys are sick.
- I got 'em!

1022
01:18:30,045 --> 01:18:32,570
Wake up, man.
Check this out.

1023
01:18:32,648 --> 01:18:36,084
Every time I drive my Volvo
in Beverly Hills, they tow the shit.

1024
01:18:45,494 --> 01:18:49,453
- We ain't got any Volvos here.
- There is a Volvo here. I know.

1025
01:18:49,532 --> 01:18:50,999
- They told me...
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

1026
01:18:51,066 --> 01:18:54,035
What I'm tryin' to tell you is,
there ain't no Volvos here.

1027
01:19:00,376 --> 01:19:03,174
Then get in your book, do something.
Find my damn Volvo!

1028
01:19:03,245 --> 01:19:06,180
Sphinx. Sway.

1029
01:19:06,248 --> 01:19:08,580
It's got to be somewhere
in there. Check it out, man.

1030
01:19:10,185 --> 01:19:12,449
Wait, wait.
There's nothing here. Look.

1031
01:19:12,521 --> 01:19:16,787
- There's another one... - No, no!
Uh-uh, hey! Tell you what, look at this.

1032
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:20,386
Look at her.

1033
01:19:30,773 --> 01:19:33,241
<i>Look, I'm sorry. I don't</i>
<i>even need to be out here.</i>

1034
01:19:33,309 --> 01:19:36,278
Hey, uh... I got a midget
pagin' me right now.

1035
01:19:36,345 --> 01:19:38,506
- Wait...
- I gotta get outta here. Hey, time is money.

1036
01:19:38,647 --> 01:19:42,777
This is the worst damn day of my life.

1037
01:19:47,756 --> 01:19:50,384
"Detective Castlebeck.
Glass shards...

1038
01:19:50,459 --> 01:19:54,020
"from the warehouse
from a black light bulb...

1039
01:19:54,096 --> 01:19:56,291
available at any
local hardware store."

1040
01:19:58,901 --> 01:20:00,994
<i>All right.</i>

1041
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:04,062
What the hell is a black
light bulb doin' in a...

1042
01:20:05,207 --> 01:20:07,141
warehouse in Long Beach?

1043
01:20:12,414 --> 01:20:14,382
Come with me.

1044
01:20:20,889 --> 01:20:22,823
- See this glass right here?
- Let me guess.

1045
01:20:22,891 --> 01:20:26,327
- Black light?
- Black light.

1046
01:20:26,395 --> 01:20:29,660
Take that wall.
I'll take this wall.

1047
01:20:29,732 --> 01:20:33,862
- <i>Remember the seventies?</i>
- Too young, thank God.

1048
01:20:33,936 --> 01:20:36,200
Black lights were
all the rage back then.

1049
01:20:36,271 --> 01:20:39,866
You know, they had this ink,
these magic markers.

1050
01:20:39,942 --> 01:20:42,001
Only show up
under black light.

1051
01:20:42,077 --> 01:20:46,912
So if you got a whole lot of information
that you don't want anybody to have...

1052
01:20:46,982 --> 01:20:51,919
- Like a shopping list of cars?
- There you go. Whoa!

1053
01:20:51,987 --> 01:20:54,649
Yes. Yes!

1054
01:20:54,723 --> 01:20:56,691
Here is our list.

1055
01:20:56,759 --> 01:21:01,128
That's a big list.
We can't handle all these cars.

1056
01:21:01,196 --> 01:21:05,360
Maybe we don't have to. I'd say where
let's concentrate on the rarest ones,

1057
01:21:05,434 --> 01:21:08,096
and let's just hope
for some luck.

1058
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:11,367
Let's get somebody on this right here.
You and I will take this one right her.

1059
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,374
'67 Shelby Mustang.

1060
01:21:13,442 --> 01:21:15,376
- Can't be but a few of these in town.
- Yeah.

1061
01:21:15,444 --> 01:21:17,674
But how do you know
he hasn't already stolen it?

1062
01:21:17,746 --> 01:21:20,374
Oh, if I know our boy, I believe
he'll leave this one till last.

1063
01:21:20,449 --> 01:21:23,577
- Why?
- He's afraid of it.

1064
01:21:35,631 --> 01:21:38,862
<i>Yo, guys.</i>
<i>It's me.</i>

1065
01:21:38,934 --> 01:21:42,927
- Oh, man. What are you doing?
- I want to come along with you guys on a boost.

1066
01:21:43,005 --> 01:21:45,997
Come on. Let's go.
Later. Come on.

1067
01:22:00,889 --> 01:22:03,357
Go, go, go.

1068
01:22:12,835 --> 01:22:16,635
What's the matter with you? Come on!

1069
01:22:16,705 --> 01:22:19,173
<i>Hey, call security!</i>
<i>Someone's stealing the car!</i>

1070
01:22:19,241 --> 01:22:21,436
- Go, go, go!
- What are you doing?

1071
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:25,071
Whoa. I ought to leave your ass. You
know that? What's the matter with you?

1072
01:22:37,426 --> 01:22:41,328
Hey, Sphinx. Check this out. Home boy
got "Snake" on the license plate.

1073
01:22:41,396 --> 01:22:45,765
<i>Well, Snake will have to slither his ass
all the way to the bus stop in the morning.</i>

1074
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:52,630
Police officers.
We need to check the lot for a car.

1075
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:54,642
Go ahead.

1076
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:03,384
Check this out, man.
Here's some low-ridin' music.

1077
01:23:03,452 --> 01:23:07,149
It's a little bit different than that cracker
shit you used to be playin'. Check this out.

1078
01:23:10,926 --> 01:23:14,521
You like that. You feelin' it?
Are you feelin' it?

1079
01:23:14,596 --> 01:23:18,157
I know you're feelin' it.

1080
01:23:18,233 --> 01:23:21,396
Oh! Snake!
Get this thing off me!

1081
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:23,904
Snake! Snake! Snake!

1082
01:23:32,047 --> 01:23:35,073
Get this thing off me, man!
It's a snake!

1083
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:37,482
It's tryin' to kill me, man!
Get this thing off me!

1084
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:41,651
<i>Somebody always want to kill</i>
<i>a brother. Man, this is wrong.</i>

1085
01:23:41,723 --> 01:23:44,191
What the hell are you doing?
Get the snake!

1086
01:23:46,028 --> 01:23:48,963
- Use the brakes!
- I am!

1087
01:23:50,432 --> 01:23:54,061
<i>This snake is crawlin' up my ass, man!</i>

1088
01:23:54,136 --> 01:23:57,299
This snake is up my ass!

1089
01:23:57,372 --> 01:23:59,237
This snake gonna swallow
my shit!

1090
01:24:27,936 --> 01:24:32,270
God, I love that car.
All right. Two ladies, home safe.

1091
01:24:32,341 --> 01:24:36,539
<i>He's tucking in Vanessa,</i>
<i>and Bernadine just took me for a ride.</i>

1092
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,914
What's the count?

1093
01:24:39,982 --> 01:24:42,883
- Forty-eight.
- Yes!

1094
01:24:42,951 --> 01:24:45,078
But Mirror and Sphinx
had some unexpected visitors.

1095
01:24:45,153 --> 01:24:47,587
- Castlebeck?
- I think so.

1096
01:24:47,656 --> 01:24:49,749
- Everything cool?
- Yeah, yeah, they're fine.

1097
01:24:49,825 --> 01:24:52,419
They're on their way back to Otto's.
Donny and Freb are already there.

1098
01:24:52,494 --> 01:24:56,260
- What about Kip and Tumbler?
- No word yet.

1099
01:24:56,331 --> 01:24:59,391
<i>Lost in suburbia. Hell, where are we?</i>

1100
01:24:59,468 --> 01:25:01,732
- What do you mean? You don't know where you're going?
- Which way is out?

1101
01:25:01,803 --> 01:25:03,737
I don't know where I am.
Everything looks the same to me.

1102
01:25:03,805 --> 01:25:05,329
You don't know
where you're going?

1103
01:25:05,407 --> 01:25:07,375
- <i>That is a cop.</i>
- No, it's not. That's rent-a-cop.

1104
01:25:09,378 --> 01:25:11,676
- Slow down. Slow down.
- He's pulling a U-turn.

1105
01:25:14,449 --> 01:25:16,178
Oh, man,
we're in big trouble.

1106
01:25:16,251 --> 01:25:18,185
<i>In pursuit of stolen Cadillac S.U.V.,</i>

1107
01:25:18,253 --> 01:25:21,814
<i>traveling west</i>
<i>on Murray Drive.</i>

1108
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:24,950
- Roadblock, Kip. Oh, shit. - Look
out for the roadblock! - Go, go!

1109
01:25:31,667 --> 01:25:34,659
Go!

1110
01:25:37,005 --> 01:25:39,974
- Oh, man.
- Motherfucker.

1111
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:42,272
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- I need help, man.

1112
01:25:42,344 --> 01:25:47,543
- <i>What?</i>
- He's been shot! Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1113
01:25:47,616 --> 01:25:49,481
- Don't touch me!
- We need to go to the hospital, man!

1114
01:25:49,551 --> 01:25:51,485
People ask questions
in hospitals, Kip.

1115
01:25:51,553 --> 01:25:55,216
- <i>Go to the hospital!</i>
- You should use your head. We're in a stolen car!

1116
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:59,056
Now, this does not look good.

1117
01:25:59,127 --> 01:26:02,255
You're gonna be all right.

1118
01:26:04,566 --> 01:26:06,363
- Oh, man!
- What happened?

1119
01:26:06,435 --> 01:26:10,166
- We ran into security patrol.
- He hid in the van. We didn't know he was there.

1120
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:12,638
We gotta get you to a doctor, private.
I know just where to go.

1121
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:16,200
- Let's get him to a car.
- No! Ow!

1122
01:26:17,412 --> 01:26:20,939
Lie in the back.
Lie down in the back.

1123
01:26:21,016 --> 01:26:23,780
Tumbler, you and Kip take
the last van back to Otto's.

1124
01:26:23,852 --> 01:26:26,116
- <i>You all right?</i>
- <i>Yeah, go.</i>

1125
01:26:28,023 --> 01:26:31,618
- What are you doin'?
- I'm goin' with him.

1126
01:26:36,465 --> 01:26:38,626
- If something should go wrong, just...
- <i>Let's go!</i>

1127
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:41,533
I'll take care of him, man.

1128
01:26:44,706 --> 01:26:47,106
Let's finish this.

1129
01:27:02,557 --> 01:27:04,616
- What's up?
- What's the story with that Humvee?

1130
01:27:04,693 --> 01:27:06,820
- Gone.
- Cadillac?

1131
01:27:06,895 --> 01:27:08,886
The same.
Where are we goin'?

1132
01:27:08,964 --> 01:27:11,398
The only '67 Shelby
in the area is registered...

1133
01:27:11,466 --> 01:27:13,934
at a place called
the International Towers in Long Beach.

1134
01:27:14,002 --> 01:27:16,732
Let's go to Long Beach.

1135
01:27:49,638 --> 01:27:52,038
I know we got a history, Eleanor,

1136
01:27:52,107 --> 01:27:56,771
and that that history has not
been great, but I promise...

1137
01:27:57,946 --> 01:28:00,107
you take care of me,
I'll take care of you.

1138
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:23,733
Shit.

1139
01:28:28,477 --> 01:28:30,945
The easy way or the hard way,
Raines. Easy way or the hard way?

1140
01:28:41,089 --> 01:28:45,219
- Hey!
- I think he's choosin' the hard way.

1141
01:28:45,293 --> 01:28:48,387
All right.

- Yeah. You noticed, huh?

1144
01:29:14,122 --> 01:29:16,386
- Jesus!
- Keep your pants on.

1145
01:29:19,761 --> 01:29:22,787
Suspect now traveling east
on Fourth Street.

<i>Correction.</i>
<i>Make that north on Main.</i>

1147

Just move!

1148
01:30:01,203 --> 01:30:03,603
Get out of there!

1149
01:30:07,075 --> 01:30:10,511
Oh, you wanna get
crazy with me!

1150
01:30:10,579 --> 01:30:13,070
Come on, boy.

1151
01:31:22,617 --> 01:31:27,680
<i>One-Baker-eleven. Unit three involved</i>

<i>One-fifty. One-sixty.</i>

- Man, this guy can drive.
- What, what?

1163
01:32:49,504 --> 01:32:52,234
It's probably mostly the car.

1164
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:56,476
Hey, what time is it?

1165
01:32:58,847 --> 01:33:00,974
7:30.

1166

I think I'm gonna have to get
you out of town or something.

01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:37,782
Your mother told him to go.

1174
01:33:37,852 --> 01:33:42,516
<i>She knew if Memphis stayed,</i>
<i>you were gonna walk his line.</i>

1175
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:44,524
<i>You were gonna join</i>
<i>his crew.</i>

1176
01:33:44,592 --> 01:33:46,787
<i>But she told him</i>
<i>to pick up and go.</i>

1177
01:33:46,861 --> 01:33:50,888
And he did, thinkin'
it was best for you.

1178
01:33:50,965 --> 01:33:54,958
<i>He left all of us.</i>
<i>For you.</i>

1179
01:33:56,805 --> 01:33:58,796
Guess it wasn't that big a deal
for him though, really.

1180
01:33:58,873 --> 01:34:03,537
Wasn't that big a sacrifice, leavin'
everything he'd ever known behind.

1181
01:34:03,611 --> 01:34:05,841
And six years later,
ain't life grand?

1182
01:34:05,914 --> 01:34:10,544
You became a car boost anyway.
How about that?

1183
01:34:11,619 --> 01:34:14,486
I sedated him.
He's sleeping.

1184
01:34:14,556 --> 01:34:16,490
<i>He's gonna be just fine.</i>

1185
01:34:43,918 --> 01:34:47,445
It's just a scratch, Eleanor.
It can be fixed.

1186
01:34:47,522 --> 01:34:50,184
No, no, no, don't.

1187
01:34:50,258 --> 01:34:52,351
Don't do this to me.
Don't... Don't start with me.

1188
01:34:52,427 --> 01:34:54,361
Don't... No, no... No, start!

1189
01:34:54,429 --> 01:34:57,694
Start, start, start.
Come on. Come on.

1190
01:35:00,034 --> 01:35:03,765
<i>I need you, Eleanor.</i>
<i>I need you now, now.</i>

1191
01:35:10,612 --> 01:35:12,546
<i>All units, be advised.</i>

1192
01:35:12,614 --> 01:35:15,242
<i>Suspect vehicle headed south</i>
<i>on Henry Ford Boulevard.</i>

1193
01:35:15,316 --> 01:35:17,750
We should hit him at Ocean Avenue
at the end of this bridge.

1194
01:35:19,721 --> 01:35:21,655
There he is.
There he is! Yeah.

1195
01:35:21,723 --> 01:35:24,851
I got you, Raines!
I got you, boy!

1196
01:35:30,164 --> 01:35:32,928
That's it. Keep it comin'.

1197
01:35:46,948 --> 01:35:50,076
Whoa! Shit!
Shit.

1198
01:36:09,537 --> 01:36:13,029
<i>One-Baker-eleven,</i>
<i>be advised. Suspect heading westbound.</i>

1199
01:36:13,107 --> 01:36:14,631
<i>Head east to intercept.</i>

1200
01:36:20,515 --> 01:36:24,042
<i>One-Baker-eleven, maintain your course.</i>
<i>Suspect heading in your direction.</i>

1201
01:36:39,534 --> 01:36:42,264
<i>One-Baker-eleven, he's at the end</i>
<i>of the pier turning towards you.</i>

1202
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,307
<i>Wait! Hang on! Hang onto it!</i>

1203
01:37:14,268 --> 01:37:16,031
Oh, shit.

1204
01:37:29,617 --> 01:37:32,108
Move, move!

1205
01:37:47,635 --> 01:37:50,604
Is he okay?

1206
01:37:50,672 --> 01:37:52,606
- How are you doing? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1207
01:37:52,674 --> 01:37:54,733
- Are you okay? Just sit back. You all right?
- I think so.

1208
01:37:54,809 --> 01:37:58,905
Are you sure?
'Cause you just went through a wall.

1209
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:02,347
<i>Long Beach Tower, this is L.A.P.D.</i>
<i>Air One in pursuit of suspect,</i>

1210
01:38:02,417 --> 01:38:05,409
<i>requesting permission</i>

1211
01:38:05,486 --> 01:38:07,818
<i>Negative, Air One.</i>
<i>Incoming aircraft on approach.</i>

01:38:07,889 --> 01:38:10,653
<i>Hold your position.</i>

1213
01:38:10,725 --> 01:38:14,661
<i>I repeat, do not enter</i>
<i>airport air space.</i>

1214
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,329
<i>Hey!</i>

1215
01:38:39,821 --> 01:38:42,346
<i>That one's got a broken leg!</i>

1216
01:39:05,379 --> 01:39:07,210
There he is.
There he is.

1217
01:39:11,786 --> 01:39:14,846
Get outta the car, man!

1218
01:39:18,226 --> 01:39:20,558
Raines!

1219
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:10,708
- Where's, uh... Where's Memphis?
- I don't know, man.

1220
01:40:10,778 --> 01:40:14,214
- He's not back yet.
- What do you mean, he's not back yet?

1221
01:40:14,282 --> 01:40:16,944
It's 8:00.

1222
01:40:21,022 --> 01:40:23,547
- Atley.
- Time's up, Atley.

1223
01:40:23,624 --> 01:40:26,821
I've got 49 cars.
That's one less than required.

1224
01:40:26,894 --> 01:40:28,885
- Bring the kid, and we'll settle this.
- What kid is that?

1225
01:40:28,963 --> 01:40:33,059
Oh, you know. The Cincinnati Kid, Billy
the Kid. Which kid did you think I mean?

1226
01:40:33,134 --> 01:40:35,796
Oh, gee, I don't know.
I think that maybe you mean Kip Raines.

1227
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:37,804
<i>Well, gee.</i>
<i>I think you're right.</i>

1228
01:40:37,872 --> 01:40:42,969
Yeah. Well, you know, it's a funny thing.
That little son of a bitch evaded me.

1229
01:40:43,044 --> 01:40:46,070
- Find him, Atley.
- Well, what if I can't find him?

1230
01:40:46,147 --> 01:40:49,275
Then big brother takes the fall for the
slipup. It doesn't matter much to me.

1231
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:54,413
One Raines is as good as another.
It never rains, but it pours.

1232
01:40:54,488 --> 01:40:58,618
Son of a...! Just... Well, you know,
I think you can thank your big brother.

1233
01:40:58,693 --> 01:41:02,424
I think he just took your place
under the guillotine.

1234
01:41:11,672 --> 01:41:15,005
Sorry, mate.
We're all done here.

1235
01:41:15,076 --> 01:41:18,011
- No, we're not done. This is number 50.
- <i>You're late.</i>

1236
01:41:18,079 --> 01:41:20,912
So sod off.
You got a problem with that,

1237
01:41:20,982 --> 01:41:23,314
take it up with Calitri.

1238
01:41:41,369 --> 01:41:46,568
- You're late.
- Wait. You're gonna argue with me over 12 minutes?

1239
01:41:46,641 --> 01:41:49,701
I just stole 50 cars for you
in one night!

1240
01:41:49,777 --> 01:41:52,837
All right? I'm a little tired.
I'm a little wired!

1241
01:41:52,914 --> 01:41:55,712
And I think I deserve
a little appreciation.

1242
01:41:55,783 --> 01:41:58,377
I said 50 cars, not 491/2.

1243
01:41:58,452 --> 01:42:03,822
491/2? She's not so bad, man. She's got,
what? You know, some paint and, uh...

1244
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,661
<i>Some fiberglass.</i>
<i>Yes, indeedy.</i>

1245
01:42:08,729 --> 01:42:11,960
You know, and the book
on her is 60, 70, call it 80.

1246
01:42:12,033 --> 01:42:17,300
So you take 80, all right? You subtract
it from 200. All right. And we make a deal.

1247
01:42:17,371 --> 01:42:20,340
You take 80 from 200,
and we call it even.

1248
01:42:20,408 --> 01:42:22,808
Done.

1249
01:42:22,877 --> 01:42:25,846
All right. Good. And this thing
with my brother's over.

1250
01:42:25,913 --> 01:42:28,074
It's over.

1251
01:42:28,149 --> 01:42:30,174
It's done.
It's finished.

1252
01:42:31,686 --> 01:42:33,620
Done. Finished.

1253
01:42:40,661 --> 01:42:44,620
Nobody insults me.
Nobody puts a gun to me head.

1254
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,628
Kill him.
Shred the car.

1255
01:42:59,113 --> 01:43:03,743
All right. Where's
Raymond Calitri's place?

1256
01:43:03,818 --> 01:43:06,514
Exeter Salvage and Steel.
It's on the water. Why, are we goin'?

1257
01:43:06,587 --> 01:43:09,112
Because, you know, homicide specifically
ordered us not to interfere.

1258
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:11,317
To hell with homicide.

1259
01:43:27,475 --> 01:43:29,443
Unicorn.

1260
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:31,569
- What?
- Nothing.

1261
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:39,246
So, where would
you like it, sir?

1262
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:41,845
I n the head
or in the chest?

1263
01:43:41,922 --> 01:43:44,823
- The chest.
- My pleasure.

1264
01:43:44,892 --> 01:43:47,019
<i>Hey, wait a minute, fellas! Hold it.</i>

1265
01:43:47,094 --> 01:43:50,393
- Big change of plan here.
- That's far enough, Atley.

1266
01:43:50,464 --> 01:43:52,830
What are you doing?
No, no, no!

1267
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,697
I said stop there, Atley!

1268
01:43:54,769 --> 01:43:57,829
<i>No, no. Calitri just sent me</i>
<i>up here to ask you a question.</i>

1269
01:44:07,982 --> 01:44:10,382
<i>All right? Everything's</i>
<i>gonna be all right. We got it covered.</i>

1270
01:44:10,451 --> 01:44:12,681
Get my brother outta here.

1271
01:44:14,288 --> 01:44:18,247
Hey.

1272
01:44:18,325 --> 01:44:21,522
You made a mistake
pickin' a kid to do your dirty work.

1273
01:44:21,595 --> 01:44:24,860
<i>Made an even bigger mistake</i>
<i>pickin' my kid brother.</i>

1274
01:44:24,932 --> 01:44:28,698
And now, you just made
the biggest mistake tryin' to kill me.

1275
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:35,306
- No. Be careful with that.
- This?

1276
01:44:35,376 --> 01:44:38,470
- Just put it down.
- That's right. You got a thing about wood.

1277
01:44:38,546 --> 01:44:40,980
Just put it down.

1278
01:44:41,048 --> 01:44:43,608
No! No!

1279
01:44:43,684 --> 01:44:45,379
- No!
- I... I...

1280
01:44:45,453 --> 01:44:47,318
- No!
- Oh, no.

1281
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:32,258
- Psst.
- I'm good.

1282
01:46:39,266 --> 01:46:41,166
God! Jesus!

1283
01:46:42,403 --> 01:46:44,564
God.

1284
01:46:46,273 --> 01:46:50,039
- Who are you?
- I'm a police officer. You don't wanna do that now.

1285
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:52,271
- Yeah, I do.
- Listen to me.

1286
01:46:52,346 --> 01:46:56,612
You walk outta here with me, you got some
options. You kill me... now you think about this...

1287
01:46:56,684 --> 01:46:59,983
I'm a police officer.
Your life will be over.

1288
01:47:00,054 --> 01:47:03,421
No, you've got that the wrong way
around. If I kill you, your life's over.

1289
01:47:03,490 --> 01:47:08,018
<i>Not all bad, though. Funeral will be on the
telly. Everybody out there, pressed and dressed.</i>

1290
01:47:08,095 --> 01:47:12,930
Guard of honor. Twenty-one gun salute and the
Stars and Stripes draped all over your coffin.

1291
01:47:14,034 --> 01:47:16,229
It'll be the greatest day
of your life.

1292
01:47:46,767 --> 01:47:49,930
Here I am smack dab in the middle
of a moral dilemma, Randall.

1293
01:47:50,004 --> 01:47:54,600
You've torn this town to shreds with that
little escapade of yours. You and your Eleanor.

1294
01:47:54,675 --> 01:47:58,509
But I understand
what brought you back here.

1295
01:47:58,579 --> 01:48:02,777
A brother's love
is a brother's love.

1296
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:07,582
You saved my life,
didn't you?

1297
01:48:07,655 --> 01:48:10,488
<i>So what am I gonna do?</i>

1298
01:48:10,557 --> 01:48:13,219
It's your call,
Detective.

1299
01:48:15,062 --> 01:48:18,623
Get outta here, Randall.
I'll clean this up.

1300
01:48:20,501 --> 01:48:24,494
Go, Randall, before
I change my mind. Go.

1301
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:32,274
Oh, uh, there's
a container ship. At pier 14.

1302
01:48:32,346 --> 01:48:34,439
You might want to
check it out.

1303
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:48,960
Oh. Look here. Can a good-lookin',
hard-workin' chef get a beer around here?

1304
01:48:49,029 --> 01:48:51,998
Come on, Tumbler. You ain't
doin' nothin'. Hand me a beer, baby.

1305
01:48:53,467 --> 01:48:57,267
All right, Memphis,
guys, food! Thank you, sir.

1306
01:48:57,338 --> 01:48:59,465
Damn.

1307
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:01,565
- Ow, ow.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1308
01:49:01,642 --> 01:49:06,511
Poor Toby, man. Sure looks
like he's in a lot of pain.

1309
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:08,775
If that's pain,
you can shoot me anytime.

1310
01:49:08,849 --> 01:49:11,682
Sexy, sexy.

1311
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,888
If his unpleasant wounding...

1312
01:49:14,955 --> 01:49:17,150
has in some way enlightened
the rest of you...

1313
01:49:17,224 --> 01:49:20,751
<i>as to the grim finish below</i>
<i>the glossy veneer of criminal life...</i>

1314
01:49:20,828 --> 01:49:23,194
<i>and inspired you to change</i>
<i>your ways,</i>

1315
01:49:23,263 --> 01:49:28,792
then his injuries carry with it an
inherent nobility and a supreme glory.

1316
01:49:28,869 --> 01:49:31,030
We should all be
so fortunate.

1317
01:49:31,105 --> 01:49:34,404
You say, "Poor Toby."

1318
01:49:34,475 --> 01:49:38,343
I say, "Poor us."

1319
01:49:38,412 --> 01:49:40,437
- He spoke.
- Yeah.

1320
01:49:40,514 --> 01:49:42,448
Hey, man, I thought you were
from Long Beach.

1321
01:49:45,052 --> 01:49:47,612
<i>Hey, Memphis. Hey.</i>

1322
01:49:50,023 --> 01:49:52,150
I have something for you.

1323
01:49:52,226 --> 01:49:54,626
- What is this?
- Open it.

1324
01:49:56,296 --> 01:49:59,959
Keys. Keys are good.
What do I do with 'em?

1325
01:50:00,033 --> 01:50:02,297
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>
<i>Everybody.</i>

1326
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:06,032
Inside here. Let's go.
Everybody, come on. Let's go.

1327
01:50:06,106 --> 01:50:09,837
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my great pleasure...

1328
01:50:11,245 --> 01:50:13,270
to present...

1329
01:50:13,347 --> 01:50:15,247
- Oh, man. Oh, man!
- There you go. Eleanor.

1330
01:50:15,315 --> 01:50:18,512
- <i>What? What? It's Eleanor.</i>
- <i>How about that?</i>

1331
01:50:18,585 --> 01:50:21,179
- Look at his face.
- <i>All yours.</i>

1332
01:50:22,856 --> 01:50:25,620
Now it's a heap, but give me
a couple of weeks and it'll look like...

1333
01:50:25,692 --> 01:50:27,523
a streamlined butterfly.

1334
01:50:31,799 --> 01:50:34,324
- You didn't...
- Oh, no, no, no.

1335
01:50:34,401 --> 01:50:37,165
I, uh... I parted the chopper
out for that.

1336
01:50:37,237 --> 01:50:40,400
I'm blown away.

1337
01:50:40,474 --> 01:50:42,601
You bought me a car.

1338
01:50:42,676 --> 01:50:46,271
Well, yeah, you know. It's just
a token of my appreciation for, uh...

1339
01:50:46,346 --> 01:50:48,940
<i>For everything.</i>

1340
01:50:50,818 --> 01:50:53,912
<i>That's the way it should be.</i>

1341
01:50:53,987 --> 01:50:56,421
That's the way it should be.
That's right.

1342
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:02,754
- Yeah.
- Why don't you get in there and go for a ride?

1343
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:05,492
I know what you did.

1344
01:51:05,566 --> 01:51:09,127
- And I thank you.
- I'll see you later, man.

1345
01:51:21,081 --> 01:51:23,777
- You wanna go for a ride?
- Hell, yes.

1346
01:51:45,839 --> 01:51:48,171
<i>Oh, don't do this to me.</i>
