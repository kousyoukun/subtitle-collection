1
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:53,205
It's her!
I know it's her!

2
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,646
She wants to tell us something!

3
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:57,274
We must do something!
Please.

4
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,727
In the name of his Imperial Majesty
and the city of Vienna,

5
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:19,004
I hereby arrest Edward Abramowitz.

6
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:22,201
Also known as
Eisenheim the Illusionist.

7
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:26,508
On charges of
disturbing public order, charlatanism,

8
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:29,139
and threats against the Empire.

9
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:30,613
Leave him alone!

10
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:40,090
They're arresting him!
They're arresting Eisenheim!

11
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:04,919
Chief Inspector Uhl.

12
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:17,992
You're late.

13
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:19,896
My apologies, your Highness.

14
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:22,970
I was attending
to the loose ends of the case.

15
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,468
Are there still loose ends?

16
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,867
Very few.

17
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:29,208
Did he do it again?

18
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:32,612
How does he do it?

19
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:35,506
I'm afraid I still don't know.

20
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:39,854
Did you ask him?

21
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:42,249
He's not talking at this point.

22
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:47,453
Well, I'm sure you have methods
for that kind of thing.

23
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:55,332
I want you to put an end to it.
Surely you have something on him.

24
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:58,264
Something from his past?

25
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:04,476
Yes. Yes, I think I do.

26
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,387
In fact we know
all about his life.

27
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:18,052
We've spoken to
almost everyone who ever knew him.

28
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:29,468
As a boy, I'm told he had a
chance encounter with a traveling magician.

29
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:35,940
Boy.

30
00:07:09,444 --> 00:07:11,571
One version
of the story was that the man

31
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:17,242
himself then
vanished along with the tree.

32
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:20,821
Who knows what actually happened?

33
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:39,070
People began to think
he had some kind of special power,

34
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,266
or at least that
he was a bit different.

35
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:50,176
And then he met her.

36
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:00,989
Don't drop it.

37
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:02,687
Careful, you're going to trip.

38
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,423
Drop it, you muck-snipe.

39
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,932
Oh! Watch out for that hole,
alley rat!

40
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,195
Drop it!

41
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:27,414
Pick a card.
Put it back in the deck.

42
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:36,221
Now, watch.

43
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,973
Duchess Von Teschen,
you can't be in a place like this.

44
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:55,344
They're peasants.
Remember who you are.

45
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:29,516
She was brought back to the castle
and they were forbidden to see each other.

46
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,110
But soon they
were doing just that.

47
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:36,854
Over the next few years they could
always find a way to be together.

48
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,520
Quick, come on.

49
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:48,002
In China there's a magician
that could make anything disappear.

50
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,170
A house, a wagon, anything.

51
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,001
We'll go visit him.

52
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:54,837
They can't stop us
if we want to be together.

53
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,709
They'll never find us.

54
00:09:57,512 --> 00:09:59,207
Do you promise
you'll take me with you?

55
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:02,506
One day I will.

56
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,856
One day we'll run away together.
We'll disappear.

57
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,261
There's a secret way to open it.

58
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,272
I wanted a picture.

59
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:26,800
Sophie, are you there?

60
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:30,899
We must hurry!
They're coming!

61
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,164
Duchess von Teschen!

62
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:39,838
Duchess von Teschen!

63
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:42,176
Duchess von Teschen!

64
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:48,322
Make us disappear.
Make us disappear.

65
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:51,222
Duchess von Teschen!

66
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:57,927
Stop. Stop.

67
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:09,138
Don't do this.
Let me go. Let go.

68
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:19,811
No! Please, let go!
No! Let her go, please!

69
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:23,550
Let go! Stop it!

70
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:24,750
Sophie!

71
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:26,291
Eduard!

72
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,151
-Sophie!
-Eduard!

73
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:30,854
Sophie.

74
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:35,298
Stay away from her or next time
we'll arrest you and your family.

75
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,719
What happened next remains a mystery.
We do know that he traveled the world.

76
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,554
That he began to perform
his magic in public.

77
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:57,389
That he changed
his name to Eisenheim.

78
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:05,021
And then almost fifteen
years later he appeared in Vienna.

79
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:21,142
Life and death, space and time,
fate and chance.

80
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:24,717
These are the forces
of the universe.

81
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:27,346
Tonight, ladies and gentleman,

82
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:33,520
I present to you a man
who has unlocked these mysteries.

83
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:39,362
From the furthest corners of the
world where the dark arts still hold sway,

84
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:45,969
he returns to us to demonstrate
how nature's laws may be bent.

85
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,803
I give you... Eisenheim.

86
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:02,680
Might I borrow
a handkerchief from someone?

87
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,254
You, Madam.

88
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:27,744
Thank you.
Ah, be patient.

89
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:35,113
Now, if you please, I would like to
continue with an examination of time.

90
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,920
From the moment we enter
this life we are in the flow of it.

91
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:45,662
We measure it and
we mark it but we cannot defy it.

92
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,327
We cannot even speed it up
or slow it down.

93
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:53,140
Or can we?

94
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,004
Have we not each
experienced a sensation

95
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,807
that a beautiful moment
seemed to pass too quickly?

96
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:03,511
And wished that
we could make it linger?

97
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:09,453
Or felt time slow on a dull day

98
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,591
and wished that
we could speed things up a bit?

99
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:21,623
I assure you, they're quite real.

100
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:28,333
And you, Madam,
where is your handkerchief?

101
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,329
Bravo! Very good.

102
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:10,107
Give us something.
Please, please, give us something.

103
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:12,340
-Please.
-What's all this?

104
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,774
We're poor.

105
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:15,775
Do you think you're poor?

106
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,111
Yes.

107
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:22,814
I want to show you something.
You're not poor.

108
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:27,327
You have everything
that you need right here.

109
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:28,889
Thank you.

110
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:32,430
Thank you.

111
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,027
Thank you.

112
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,943
And that's yours.
And this too.

113
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,926
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

114
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,825
-Coffee?
-No.

115
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,165
Strudel?
I have two.

116
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:10,271
Nothing, thank you.

117
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:14,803
You look very pleased with yourself.

118
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:16,675
How are the receipts?

119
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:18,244
Not bad.
A three-quarter house.

120
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:19,038
Well done.

121
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,238
But we're going
to do better than that.

122
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:22,076
Listen to this. Listen.

123
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:25,546
"There is no argument
that his uncanny displays separate

124
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,986
him from the ranks of
garden variety stage wizards.

125
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:35,590
Some of his effects transcend mere
illusion and approach the realm of art.

126
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,222
He is very young
to be so masterful.

127
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:42,864
You see?
We'll pack the house with this review.

128
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:46,106
We are going to make more money
than you ever dreamed of.

129
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:50,707
But if it was mechanical, maybe he
had it wrapped in some kind of bark?

130
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:52,506
Oh, yeah, of course
I thought of that.

131
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,511
It's the butterflies
I'm trying to work out.

132
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:57,307
Oh, for Pete's sake,
invisible wire.

133
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:58,779
Too obvious.

134
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,578
How many men
have you detailed for tonight?

135
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:03,249
We have eight men inside,
another eight out front.

136
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,759
Perhaps you'll get another look
at your butterflies.

137
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:15,363
Check the last ten rows there.

138
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,692
You! Don't touch that!
Put that down!

139
00:19:39,827 --> 00:19:40,450
Ah, Herr Eisenheim.

140
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:41,985
Who are you and
what do you think you're doing?

141
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,428
I'm Chief Inspector Walter Uhl
and I'm inspecting your theatre.

142
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:48,000
I've seen you perform.

143
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,865
Very impressive.
Very impressive.

144
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,267
How can we help you,
Inspector?

145
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,404
You will be honored
to know that the Crown Prince plans

146
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:57,943
to attend your performance tonight.

147
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,670
The Crown Prince?

148
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:02,476
Yes! So, obviously
we have to inspect the theatre.

149
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:05,142
I think that one's
a bit small for an assassin, don't you?

150
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,651
Yes, the orange tree.

151
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,758
You know,
I have seen things like this before

152
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:15,591
but never one like that.
Extraordinary.

153
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,526
Thank you.

154
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:22,500
I have been puzzling over how it works,
especially how the butterflies fly.

155
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:27,237
I assure you your secret
is safe with me.

156
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:32,078
I'm an officer of the law after all,
and a bit of an amateur conjourer.

157
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,139
Are you really?

158
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:39,586
Yes. Well, card tricks, coins,
uh, slight of hand, yes?

159
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:44,518
But nothing fancy.
Perhaps you'll give me a tip?

160
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:50,057
Yes, all right.
I'll show you one I'm very fond of.

161
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:51,187
Are you a gambling man?

162
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:52,822
On occasion, yes.

163
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,798
I will bet you the secret
of the orange tree

164
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,837
that I can guess which hand you
place this in every time.

165
00:20:58,206 --> 00:20:59,468
Excellent.

166
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:05,074
Put it in your fist,
raise your hand against your forehead,

167
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:07,647
concentrate on it,
form a mental picture.

168
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:10,147
-Yes.
-Have you got it? -Yes.

169
00:21:10,284 --> 00:21:12,013
Put your hands in front of you.

170
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:17,515
It's in your left.

171
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,301
-Well !
-A lucky guess, perhaps.

172
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:22,488
You have a
confederate who signals you.

173
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,621
No.
It's more primitive than that.

174
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:25,596
Uh-huh.

175
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:29,760
When you raise your hand to your head,
the blood drains from it.

176
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:32,399
It will be paler every time.

177
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:40,837
Oh, oh, I like that very much.

178
00:21:41,215 --> 00:21:43,149
Please take it with my compliments.

179
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:46,845
Why, thank you.
Eh, the blood drains.

180
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:51,084
Now, Inspector,
if you don't mind,

181
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:53,489
I've got to prepare
for tonight's performance.

182
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:54,661
Ah.

183
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:10,336
Please stand for his Imperial Highness,
Crown Prince Leopold.

184
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:41,642
I thought we might end this evening
with a discussion of the soul.

185
00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:45,675
All of the greatest
religions speak

186
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:48,373
of the soul's endurance
beyond the end of life.

187
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:53,710
So, what then does it mean to die?

188
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:58,185
I need a volunteer from the audience.

189
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:05,829
Someone not afraid of death.
Please, someone?

190
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:08,501
I assure you no
tragedy will befall you.

191
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:40,363
It's an honor,
Duchess Von Teschen.

192
00:23:54,248 --> 00:23:55,374
Do you know me?

193
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:58,585
No.

194
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:03,312
You're quite certain
that we've never met before?

195
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:04,991
Yes, of course.

196
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:24,770
Now please gaze directly into my eyes.
Look nowhere else.

197
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:07,419
Wave to yourself.
Turn in a circle.

198
00:25:15,663 --> 00:25:17,460
Now, bow to yourself.

199
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,373
Away.

200
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:05,335
They must have liked you.

201
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:07,464
They've waited
for you nearly five minutes.

202
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:14,040
Your Highness, may I introduce
Eisenheim the Illusionist?

203
00:27:17,785 --> 00:27:18,713
Well done.

204
00:27:18,753 --> 00:27:21,244
Thank you for coming.
I hope you enjoyed it.

205
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:23,719
Oh, we more than enjoyed it.

206
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:26,326
Stimulated great debate amongst us,
hasn't it?

207
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,951
Except of course for your assistant,
Duchess Von Teschen.

208
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:30,996
You seemed to have struck
her quite speechless.

209
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:33,630
A feat in itself.
Did you hypnotize her?

210
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,029
In a fashion.

211
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:37,602
I'd like to learn that trick.

212
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,372
Rainier here thinks
you have supernatural powers.

213
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,440
Do you claim
supernatural powers?

214
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:50,144
I've never said anything
of that kind.

215
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:52,115
Then you won't mind
a question or two.

216
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,481
Now let's not ruin it.

217
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:56,089
You needn't divulge anything
I can't guess.

218
00:27:57,825 --> 00:27:58,814
As you wish.

219
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,961
Your assistants are behind a
mirror somewhere in robes obviously.

220
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:08,290
Lights in the frame perhaps
to illuminate them, or angled mirrors?

221
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:10,836
That would be one way to do it.

222
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:14,039
I think I understand
it all except the ghost.

223
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:16,370
That was very, very good.

224
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:18,907
Another viewing perhaps?

225
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,616
You must come to the Hofburg next time.
We'll make an evening of it.

226
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:24,979
That will be my pleasure.

227
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,311
So be it. Sophie?

228
00:28:37,064 --> 00:28:41,967
And we'll gather our best minds next time.
You'll really have a challenge then.

229
00:28:42,102 --> 00:28:46,471
Then I'll prepare something special.
Perhaps I'll make you disappear.

230
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:02,989
Oh, my God, when he volunteered
her I heard the crashing sound

231
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:05,284
of money falling on me in piles.

232
00:29:06,193 --> 00:29:09,162
Every lady of means in Vienna
will want to get up there with you now.

233
00:29:09,897 --> 00:29:11,125
What a showoff.

234
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:13,796
His father would have died
if he had seen such a display.

235
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:15,902
She didn't seem
too happy about it either.

236
00:29:16,103 --> 00:29:17,468
Well, she'd better get used to it.

237
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:19,838
-How's that?
-Word is she'll marry him soon.

238
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:24,202
-Really?
-Taking her chances if you ask me.

239
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:25,577
Why?

240
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:28,974
He likes to give his lady friends
a good thrashing now and again.

241
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,815
People say he pushed
one of them off a balcony

242
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:33,977
just to cover the beating
he had given her.

243
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,715
For Herr Eisenheim.

244
00:30:47,394 --> 00:30:48,861
Hello, Sophie.

245
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:58,270
When I was on the stage,
you knew me right away.

246
00:30:58,572 --> 00:31:03,532
It took me a moment but,
yes, I knew.

247
00:31:03,677 --> 00:31:05,167
You could have said something.

248
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:08,008
I thought you'd figure
it out eventually.

249
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:09,740
Yes, I would have.

250
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:12,775
I would have come another night,
volunteered,

251
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,820
walked right
on stage and said hello.

252
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:16,786
And then you'd really have
had to move quickly.

253
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,986
I suspect you would have.

254
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,092
I don't understand why.

255
00:31:28,302 --> 00:31:32,170
Perhaps for the same reasons you find
it prudent to meet in a carriage.

256
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,937
It's just a game
I have to play with them.

257
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:39,068
I'm followed everywhere.

258
00:31:39,947 --> 00:31:41,812
It's-it's supposed
to be for my protection.

259
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:50,585
Yes.
So, I hear congratulations are in order.

260
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:52,388
What for?

261
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:56,524
They say you'll be the princess.

262
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,220
It's not decided at all.

263
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:00,094
Ah.

264
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:03,361
It makes a certain sense,
I suppose.

265
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,538
We've known each other for years
and of course our families.

266
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:13,112
He's very intelligent.
A little too intelligent for his own good.

267
00:32:17,117 --> 00:32:22,077
You're lucky, you know.
To have broken free as you did.

268
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,822
I often wish that I had...

269
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:32,356
Wished what?

270
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:38,137
I wished that
I would see you again.

271
00:32:43,577 --> 00:32:45,272
And now you have.

272
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:52,118
Yes, now I have.

273
00:32:59,193 --> 00:33:01,559
I look forward to
seeing you again at the Hofburg.

274
00:33:01,795 --> 00:33:03,262
Until then.

275
00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:29,315
Here's the report
on Duchess Von Teschen.

276
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:31,424
Mmm. Anything interesting?

277
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:33,322
See for yourself.

278
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:42,599
The magician?

279
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:47,204
They drove around for half an hour,
then he got out near the theatre.

280
00:33:52,045 --> 00:33:53,342
What do you want us to do?

281
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,632
Join us for a drink?

282
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:22,635
Please.

283
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:35,582
You like something to eat,
something to drink, mmm?

284
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,220
No, thank you.

285
00:34:37,457 --> 00:34:44,090
Herr Eisenheim, I'm going to ask you
a question that may not seem friendly.

286
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:46,563
But I assure you, in fact, is.

287
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,504
What is your relationship
with the Duchess Von Teschen?

288
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:56,299
You're right,
that doesn't seem friendly.

289
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:58,468
Oh, but that
is precisely my point.

290
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:04,911
For, you see, where others might
judge a discreet carriage ride

291
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:11,787
for what it seemed to be,
I am willing to find out what it actually was.

292
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:16,228
All right.
We were childhood acquaintances.

293
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:17,488
Acquaintances?

294
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:22,596
Childhood friends.
My father was a cabinetmaker.

295
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:25,601
He made the furniture
for her family's house.

296
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:30,201
I see, the cabinet
maker's son friends with a--

297
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:32,175
Has there been a complaint?

298
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:33,244
Oh, no, no.

299
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,574
If there'd been a complaint...

300
00:35:35,415 --> 00:35:39,044
Well, we'd be having a very,
uh, different sort of conversation.

301
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:44,886
Yes. He relies on you
for that sort of thing, does he?

302
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:47,523
I'm a simple public servant,
Herr Eisenheim.

303
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,922
That's not what I hear.

304
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:52,898
I hear you'll be the Chief
of Police very soon.

305
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,635
Maybe Mayor of Vienna?
Party Secretary?

306
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,432
All subject to his whim.

307
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:01,335
You better hope he doesn't dissolve
the Parliament before you get there.

308
00:36:02,142 --> 00:36:06,010
Now, the Prince has some progressive ideas,
but he will make a fine Emperor.

309
00:36:06,146 --> 00:36:09,138
Well, they say you're very close to him,
so I'm sure you'll be fine.

310
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:14,311
Look-- Yes, indeed, they say that
I'm very close to the Prince.

311
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,224
But the simple truth of the matter is,
Herr Eisenheim,

312
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,257
I'm the son of a butcher.

313
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:22,521
He's the heir to the Empire.

314
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:25,963
How close could
we be to such as him, Hmm?

315
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:28,666
Do you see my point?

316
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,836
Don't fool yourself
that you can play in their game.

317
00:36:38,312 --> 00:36:44,148
I've served on the edge
of it for many, many years

318
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:49,054
and I can tell you with certainty
there's no trick they haven't seen.

319
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,825
It's not worth it.

320
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:08,699
My guest tonight is not a showman
at all, but rather a wizard

321
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:15,012
who has sold his soul to the devil
in return for unholy powers.

322
00:37:15,782 --> 00:37:18,683
Or so at least some of our friends
here would have us believe.

323
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:26,217
But fear not,
everything can and will be explained.

324
00:37:26,526 --> 00:37:30,360
All mysteries penetrated.

325
00:37:30,497 --> 00:37:35,025
Here, Here.
Well said. Well said.

326
00:37:59,893 --> 00:38:00,860
Is that the emperor?

327
00:38:00,994 --> 00:38:02,325
Ah, yes, your father.

328
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:04,454
I didn't think he was invited .

329
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:19,239
A fair likeness of the old man.

330
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,080
Too modern a style for him, of course.

331
00:38:23,316 --> 00:38:25,284
I'm afraid I'm not much of a painter.

332
00:38:25,452 --> 00:38:28,486
It's true, there are no
brush strokes in this painting,

333
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:31,386
I can see that clearly.

334
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:37,622
So to achieve the color some sort
of chemical must be interacting, presumably.

335
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:42,400
Some sort of sprayer up your sleeve?
May I?

336
00:38:43,236 --> 00:38:44,635
If you feel you must.

337
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,168
I do.

338
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,599
Oh, let the man do his show.

339
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:53,006
You want me to
just sit there when it's so obvious?

340
00:38:53,146 --> 00:38:54,340
I do.

341
00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:58,017
He tries to trick you.
I try to enlighten you.

342
00:38:58,151 --> 00:38:59,778
Which is the more noble pursuit?

343
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:03,945
May we have the lights please,
so his Highness can better see?

344
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:07,021
See here, Leopold,
let's have a show.

345
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:08,223
Here, here.

346
00:39:08,361 --> 00:39:10,761
Come on, Leopold,
get on with it.

347
00:39:10,897 --> 00:39:14,094
Very well, I propose a challenge.

348
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:25,535
Why don't you astonish us,
if you can, without all the gadgetry?

349
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:28,579
As you wish.

350
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,746
Your sword is very beautiful.
Might I see it?

351
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:35,979
Certainly.

352
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:40,323
May I?

353
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,992
Where does power flow from?

354
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:55,501
Skill or destiny,
or divine right?

355
00:39:57,878 --> 00:40:01,314
We all know the story
of a sword called Excalibur.

356
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:12,114
Excalibur's blade was fixed in stone,
and there it stayed.

357
00:40:15,562 --> 00:40:18,224
Many worthy knights tried
to pull the sword from the stone.

358
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,099
Only Arthur succeeded proving
his right to rule.

359
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:31,910
Who can take this sword?
You sir, can you take the sword?

360
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,066
No surprise there.

361
00:40:55,435 --> 00:40:56,834
Perhaps you, sir.

362
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,901
Not so eager, cousin.

363
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:20,382
You shall live a long life.

364
00:41:22,495 --> 00:41:24,258
Thank you for your indulgence.

365
00:41:38,144 --> 00:41:40,669
Come now, if you can't
pull it out you'll never be Emperor.

366
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:42,679
Your father
will live to be a hundred.

367
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,528
The sword to its rightful owner!

368
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:12,205
That's enough light
entertainment for this evening.

369
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:17,442
For more serious discussion,
please join me for a drink.

370
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:31,328
Shut him down.

371
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:34,328
Well, he's very popular,
your Highness.

372
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:35,900
I'm sure you'll find a way.

373
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:44,670
What did you do to him?

374
00:42:45,211 --> 00:42:47,475
I gave him what he asked for.

375
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:51,150
What would possess you
to do something so foolish?

376
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:55,577
Duchess Von Teschen,
you must come along, my dear.

377
00:42:56,256 --> 00:43:00,659
We don't want to keep the Prince waiting.
Did you enjoy the show?

378
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,622
It was wonderful, wasn't it?

379
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:03,092
It was amusing.

380
00:43:42,302 --> 00:43:44,167
Who told you where to find me?

381
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:45,665
Your manager.

382
00:43:46,406 --> 00:43:48,806
I told him if he wants to stay
in Vienna, you need my help.

383
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:51,206
Ah, so I'm to be driven
from the city, is that it?

384
00:43:51,478 --> 00:43:52,968
Good, I shall relish it.

385
00:43:53,113 --> 00:43:58,380
Stop it!
I came here to try to help you.

386
00:43:58,651 --> 00:44:02,348
Why! Why should you possibly
care what happens to me now?

387
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:05,014
You were my friend.
I am your friend.

388
00:44:05,158 --> 00:44:08,093
We knew each other
very briefly a long time ago.

389
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,490
You don't know me at all.

390
00:44:09,729 --> 00:44:14,223
Then why did you speak to me?
Why did you even bother talking-

391
00:45:30,777 --> 00:45:32,711
And you kept it all this time.

392
00:45:34,814 --> 00:45:41,014
I used to sit and stare at your
picture trying to imagine where you were.

393
00:45:42,422 --> 00:45:46,256
At night I'd have dreams
I had gone with you,

394
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:50,555
and then I'd wake up
and realize where I was.

395
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:02,639
But in my dreams you had
shorter hair and no beard.

396
00:46:11,784 --> 00:46:13,945
Where did you go when you left?

397
00:46:16,656 --> 00:46:19,386
To my uncle's farm near Prague.

398
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,451
How exotic.

399
00:46:25,965 --> 00:46:32,495
I went to Russia, then Asia Minor,
and then the Orient for many years.

400
00:46:33,273 --> 00:46:34,672
So long.

401
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,265
I always meant to return.

402
00:46:39,846 --> 00:46:44,681
I just- I kept thinking
I'd find it around the next corner.

403
00:46:45,818 --> 00:46:47,183
What?

404
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:51,450
A real mystery.

405
00:46:54,294 --> 00:46:57,229
I saw remarkable things,
but the only mystery

406
00:46:57,363 --> 00:47:02,733
I never solved was
why my heart couldn't let go of you.

407
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:29,551
He wants me to go to Budapest with him
next week to announce our engagement.

408
00:47:32,131 --> 00:47:38,195
He wants the Hungarians behind him.
They're going to crown him King.

409
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,770
I'm sure his father
will have something to say about that.

410
00:47:40,907 --> 00:47:42,670
He plans to overthrow his father.

411
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:48,975
That could go very badly for him...
and for you.

412
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,243
You shouldn't be involved.

413
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:53,684
I am part of his plan.

414
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:57,449
He only gets Hungary
by aligning himself with my family.

415
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,755
Leave him.

416
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:01,890
It's not that easy.

417
00:48:02,328 --> 00:48:05,092
Call it off and come away with me.

418
00:48:06,532 --> 00:48:09,092
Or don't say
anything and we'll just go.

419
00:48:11,537 --> 00:48:16,440
As long as
we are alive he'll hunt us.

420
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:18,934
And when he
finds us he'll kill us.

421
00:48:33,092 --> 00:48:39,429
Look at me.
Do you truly want to leave with me?

422
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,503
Yes, I do.

423
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:27,444
There you are.
As I predicted they shut us down.

424
00:49:27,914 --> 00:49:31,281
Are you happy now, hmm?
You made your point.

425
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:34,982
It doesn't matter that
we were sold out for the whole run.

426
00:49:35,121 --> 00:49:38,989
No, look.
You got it off your chest.

427
00:49:39,158 --> 00:49:40,352
Do we have money?

428
00:49:40,493 --> 00:49:41,289
What?

429
00:49:41,427 --> 00:49:42,826
Do we have any money saved?

430
00:49:42,962 --> 00:49:46,159
Yes, we have some.
But we could have had much, much more.

431
00:49:47,834 --> 00:49:49,461
Mmm, it will have to do.

432
00:49:51,637 --> 00:49:53,798
And the second account, all of it.

433
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,703
Of course, Herr Eisenheim.

434
00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:02,071
Thank you.

435
00:50:57,403 --> 00:50:59,530
And you have no doubt
it was Duchess Von Teschen?

436
00:50:59,672 --> 00:51:01,071
I'd stake my life on it.

437
00:51:03,075 --> 00:51:04,736
What was in the suitcase?

438
00:51:05,578 --> 00:51:06,840
I don't know.

439
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,382
He's by the first car.

440
00:51:46,085 --> 00:51:47,609
The map will show you where to meet.

441
00:51:48,354 --> 00:51:52,188
When it's done, you'll travel ahead
with her and I shall follow.

442
00:51:52,325 --> 00:51:54,623
And she understands
everything this entails?

443
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,992
Completely.
There's not a lot of time.

444
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:35,223
As you know, we sometimes follow
Duchess Von Teschen for her protection.

445
00:52:37,937 --> 00:52:40,997
Yesterday she was seen
in the company of another man.

446
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:42,465
What man?

447
00:52:43,643 --> 00:52:46,510
Eisenheim, the Illusionist.

448
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,247
What were they doing?

449
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:51,043
Well, they were meeting and, uh--

450
00:52:51,183 --> 00:52:55,916
Touching? Kissing?
Were they fucking?

451
00:52:56,055 --> 00:52:58,216
Not that we observed, no.

452
00:52:59,225 --> 00:53:02,717
However, I have reason to believe that
they may be planning something together.

453
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:06,394
It's possible
they may be leaving.

454
00:53:06,499 --> 00:53:08,990
I'm not certain of anything yet,
your Highness.

455
00:53:09,135 --> 00:53:11,262
Thank you, Inspector.

456
00:53:11,404 --> 00:53:13,998
We can of course
acquire more information-

457
00:53:45,671 --> 00:53:48,162
He spent the afternoon
in Vienna with his father.

458
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:50,006
He's expected shortly.

459
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:27,671
What a surprise.
I thought you didn't like it here.

460
00:54:32,651 --> 00:54:34,619
I suppose you
think you're very clever

461
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:42,558
and very democratic
in your friendships, aren't you?

462
00:54:42,795 --> 00:54:44,285
What are you talking about?

463
00:54:44,463 --> 00:54:48,832
Your magician friend.
I know you've been with him.

464
00:54:51,203 --> 00:54:55,071
It's true.
We've been friends since childhood.

465
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:57,471
You sleep with all your
childhood friends?

466
00:54:57,676 --> 00:54:59,303
I will not be spoken to this way.

467
00:54:59,545 --> 00:55:01,570
You'll be spoken
to as I wish to speak to you.

468
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,310
You're drunk.

469
00:55:03,682 --> 00:55:05,741
You're getting quite old,
aren't you?

470
00:55:07,386 --> 00:55:10,651
You know, my mother was sixteen years old
when she married my father.

471
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,382
And you?
Can you even bear children?

472
00:55:12,525 --> 00:55:16,757
Are you any use at all?
Are you trying to embarrass me?

473
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:17,692
It has nothing
to do with you.

474
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,821
It has everything
to do with me!

475
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,097
You will not share my bed
if you've slept with him!!

476
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:32,206
You don't understand.
I'm not going to share your bed at all.

477
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,711
I'm not going
to Budapest with you.

478
00:55:38,784 --> 00:55:40,649
I don't want to be part
of what you're planning.

479
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:44,216
And I will not marry you.

480
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,624
I assume you haven't been
so stupid as to tell him anything.

481
00:55:51,497 --> 00:55:52,521
'Cause if you disrupt my plans

482
00:55:52,665 --> 00:55:54,656
I will have no further use for you,
do you understand?

483
00:56:02,975 --> 00:56:05,170
Now, you will travel
to Budapest tomorrow.

484
00:56:06,378 --> 00:56:10,940
I recommend that you are here
early packed and ready to go.

485
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:13,242
Do nothing more to embarrass me.

486
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,114
Goodbye.

487
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:21,316
What do you mean "goodbye"?

488
00:56:22,895 --> 00:56:24,362
Come back here.

489
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:30,132
Come back here!

490
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:47,283
Don't disobey me again.
Whore!

491
00:56:54,894 --> 00:57:00,764
Out of my way.
Please, don't-- Uugh.

492
00:57:26,959 --> 00:57:29,757
No, leave that.
Leave all the lanterns.

493
00:58:36,395 --> 00:58:39,660
Duchess Von Tuschen!

494
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:44,200
Duchess Von Tuschen!

495
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:00,451
Over here!

496
01:00:03,248 --> 01:00:05,216
I thought you saw
her get on the train with him!

497
01:00:05,384 --> 01:00:08,376
No, sir, we were waiting
in Vienna for them.

498
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,614
But they left from Barden?.
We assumed she was him.

499
01:00:12,157 --> 01:00:14,182
Should I wire the
Crown Prince in Budapest?

500
01:00:14,326 --> 01:00:17,853
It's been done!
Who are you?

501
01:00:17,996 --> 01:00:22,160
I'm the family's doctor.
Are you the Chief Inspector?

502
01:00:22,434 --> 01:00:23,799
Yes, I am.

503
01:00:24,236 --> 01:00:26,204
You understand this is
a police matter now?

504
01:00:26,338 --> 01:00:27,862
Of course I understand.

505
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,142
Good, good.

506
01:00:29,942 --> 01:00:31,407
You have determined the cause of death?

507
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,143
She bled to death.

508
01:00:33,278 --> 01:00:37,908
There's a wound on her throat
just above the left collarbone-

509
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:41,542
Uh, some knife or sword.

510
01:00:42,154 --> 01:00:43,416
May I take a look?

511
01:01:06,512 --> 01:01:08,878
Inspector,
l-I will not stand for it.

512
01:01:09,014 --> 01:01:14,008
The Crown Prince will not stand for it.
This is not some circus sideshow.

513
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:18,656
My apologies, of course.

514
01:01:24,029 --> 01:01:25,690
Thank you, doctor.

515
01:01:29,535 --> 01:01:32,902
Probably robbed.
Gypsies maybe?

516
01:01:33,172 --> 01:01:35,333
Saw all those diamonds,
couldn't say no.

517
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:40,377
Chief Inspector,
there's one thing you should know.

518
01:01:40,512 --> 01:01:41,911
Yes, what is that?

519
01:01:42,214 --> 01:01:47,117
In the folds of her dress
I found this small gemstone.

520
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:07,070
Seen last Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
riding without

521
01:02:07,206 --> 01:02:09,265
an escort toward the
Imperial Hunting Lodge.

522
01:02:09,408 --> 01:02:12,070
Groomsman said
she arrived about 8:30.

523
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,071
What was she doing riding alone?

524
01:02:18,684 --> 01:02:20,914
He did this. You know he did.

525
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:21,915
I know who did what?

526
01:02:22,054 --> 01:02:25,581
The Crown Prince! He killed her.
He's done it before and you know it!

527
01:02:25,724 --> 01:02:26,383
No, I don't know that.
In fact, I'm sure he didn't. He's in Budapest.

528
01:02:28,594 --> 01:02:30,118
He killed her before he left.

529
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:31,923
I'm afraid the
facts don't support your theory.

530
01:02:34,566 --> 01:02:36,261
She was leaving him.

531
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:37,698
For who? You?
Yes.

532
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:39,861
Don't be absurd, Herr Eisenheim.

533
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:42,098
He killed her because
he couldn't let her go.

534
01:02:43,008 --> 01:02:44,407
She knew his secret.

535
01:02:44,576 --> 01:02:45,668
What secret?

536
01:02:46,144 --> 01:02:47,042
Ask your Inspector.
He knows.

537
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:48,441
Stop this right now!

538
01:02:50,883 --> 01:02:52,373
Are you completely corrupt?

539
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:56,747
No, not completely,
no, which is

540
01:02:56,889 --> 01:03:00,825
why I'll advise you not to accuse
anyone especially his Imperial Highness,

541
01:03:01,927 --> 01:03:04,054
or you'll end up
in jail yourself.

542
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:28,509
Where's the guard who
let her out of the gate?

543
01:03:28,654 --> 01:03:29,916
Gone with the Crown Prince.

544
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,352
Did any of the
servants see her leave?

545
01:03:31,523 --> 01:03:32,547
All asleep.

546
01:03:33,325 --> 01:03:34,314
What about him?

547
01:03:34,893 --> 01:03:38,090
He uh, he put her horse in the
first stall when she arrived.

548
01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:44,863
This one?

549
01:03:55,314 --> 01:03:58,442
We don't have jurisdiction
on imperial property.

550
01:03:59,051 --> 01:04:00,916
Thank you.
I know.

551
01:04:02,654 --> 01:04:03,882
So, what are you doing?

552
01:04:07,526 --> 01:04:09,016
Investigating.

553
01:04:10,395 --> 01:04:16,857
Listening to that magician, are you?
For all we know, he did it.

554
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:19,964
No, I think not.

555
01:04:20,505 --> 01:04:22,234
The Crown Prince-- He's back.

556
01:04:30,983 --> 01:04:37,411
Chief Inspector, we should go.
Now.

557
01:04:41,426 --> 01:04:42,916
And what have you found out?

558
01:04:43,161 --> 01:04:45,061
She was last
seen riding here alone.

559
01:04:45,197 --> 01:04:48,894
Yes, and based on your information
I then threw her out, Chief?.

560
01:04:49,034 --> 01:04:50,433
Did she commit suicide?

561
01:04:50,569 --> 01:04:52,298
No, it was surely murder.

562
01:04:52,904 --> 01:04:54,166
Do you have a suspect?

563
01:04:54,306 --> 01:04:55,671
We will soon, your Highness.

564
01:05:04,616 --> 01:05:08,108
Later that week, we arrested
a man and charged him with murder.

565
01:05:09,021 --> 01:05:12,013
But I knew that that
wouldn't satisfy Eisenheim.

566
01:05:17,429 --> 01:05:19,693
I had my men continue
to watch him.

567
01:05:35,881 --> 01:05:39,180
He finally emerged from his grief
and bought a rundown theatre.

568
01:05:40,419 --> 01:05:41,784
It's perfect.

569
01:05:48,126 --> 01:05:53,758
He fired his manager and began
preparing for a new kind of show.

570
01:07:57,889 --> 01:07:58,913
Who is he?

571
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,455
My name is Frankel.

572
01:08:05,397 --> 01:08:06,659
Where did you come from?

573
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,365
I come from Brunn.
My father is a lens grinder there.

574
01:08:11,703 --> 01:08:13,671
How did you come
to be here tonight?

575
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:20,343
I don't know.

576
01:08:20,478 --> 01:08:21,877
Are you alive?

577
01:08:25,717 --> 01:08:27,708
What can you tell us
about the other side?

578
01:08:27,953 --> 01:08:28,977
What's it like?

579
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:29,848
Yes, tell us.

580
01:08:29,988 --> 01:08:32,980
You must know things,
secret things.

581
01:08:57,415 --> 01:08:59,349
They don't seem
to think it's a trick.

582
01:09:09,027 --> 01:09:12,258
Eisenheim's audience
had always been enthusiastic.

583
01:09:12,397 --> 01:09:17,494
But now he was attracting
a more impassioned following.

584
01:09:46,731 --> 01:09:48,528
Madame, please.

585
01:09:57,342 --> 01:10:01,301
With these spirts,
these manifestations,

586
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:06,577
Eisenheim has given us hard proof
of the soul's immortality.

587
01:10:07,519 --> 01:10:13,185
A spirit has been reaffirmed in the
face of modern scientific materialism.

588
01:10:13,925 --> 01:10:19,830
The work of spiritualism will arouse
humanity to a new moral earnestness.

589
01:10:20,131 --> 01:10:22,031
It is a revolutionary movement

590
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:26,365
and we will turn the empire
into a spiritual republic.

591
01:10:29,074 --> 01:10:31,008
Do you think
Eisenheim's behind all this?

592
01:10:37,649 --> 01:10:40,618
Why must I be bothered
with a magician?

593
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,685
He has proven to be more than
a magician, your Highness.

594
01:10:46,358 --> 01:10:48,690
He is a charlatan.
He's a faker.

595
01:10:50,562 --> 01:10:57,263
If he pretends to have supernatural
I powers put him on trial for fraud.

596
01:10:59,671 --> 01:11:01,795
First we have to show it as fraud then do it

597
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,999
find out how the trick
is done and then arrest him.

598
01:11:13,685 --> 01:11:16,381
This is just
a rough demonstration, Inspector.

599
01:11:16,521 --> 01:11:18,614
But you can see
how it could work.

600
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:28,898
Yes, I see.
Not bad. Not bad.

601
01:11:33,405 --> 01:11:35,600
We need a spy in Eisenheim's troop.

602
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,469
Those Orientals,
yhey won't give us anything.

603
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:39,304
I already tried.

604
01:11:39,677 --> 01:11:41,235
Then try something else.

605
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:01,857
What has happened here?

606
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,424
One of those ghosts from the theatre,
down the street.

607
01:13:04,562 --> 01:13:05,654
Where!

608
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:08,958
Right there, and it's a boy.

609
01:13:10,768 --> 01:13:11,860
Sick.

610
01:13:15,773 --> 01:13:17,172
Where is this thing?

611
01:13:18,409 --> 01:13:19,569
Over there.

612
01:13:19,777 --> 01:13:20,869
Did you see it?

613
01:13:32,357 --> 01:13:34,325
It was right over there.

614
01:14:24,909 --> 01:14:26,433
Where are you taking him?

615
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:33,977
I want to know how it's done.

616
01:14:35,253 --> 01:14:36,982
First the orange tree,
now this.

617
01:14:38,156 --> 01:14:40,647
Do I have to share all
my professional secrets with the police?

618
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:43,420
Well, in this case, yes.
Or I'll be forced to arrest you.

619
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:44,391
On what charge?

620
01:14:44,529 --> 01:14:46,224
Mmm, well, we'll start with fraud.

621
01:14:47,832 --> 01:14:48,821
Excuse me, Chief Inspector.

622
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:49,763
What!

623
01:14:49,934 --> 01:14:51,868
I think you
should look outside the window.

624
01:15:05,383 --> 01:15:06,407
Who are they?

625
01:15:07,385 --> 01:15:09,114
They are here for him.

626
01:15:09,487 --> 01:15:14,356
Ah, my goodness,
you have a devoted following.

627
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:16,888
What is it they expect of you?

628
01:15:17,061 --> 01:15:20,258
I have no idea.
What do your spies tell you?

629
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:23,725
That you plan to separate?
the monarchy perhaps?

630
01:15:24,535 --> 01:15:25,627
Why?

631
01:15:26,371 --> 01:15:28,566
Just because
the Crown Prince is a murderer?

632
01:15:30,074 --> 01:15:31,098
He's not a murderer.

633
01:15:31,242 --> 01:15:34,109
We have the real murderer in prison.
He pleaded guilty.

634
01:15:34,379 --> 01:15:35,744
You've got the wrong man.

635
01:15:36,147 --> 01:15:37,205
You don't know that.

636
01:15:37,382 --> 01:15:38,542
No, but you do.

637
01:15:45,356 --> 01:15:48,052
Herr Eisenheim,
you will also go to prison

638
01:15:48,192 --> 01:15:51,252
if you don't explain to me
what it is you are doing.

639
01:15:55,566 --> 01:15:59,366
The sentence will be greater
if that mob attacks the building.

640
01:16:03,508 --> 01:16:04,805
Well?

641
01:16:08,813 --> 01:16:11,839
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop!

642
01:16:16,187 --> 01:16:21,022
Listen to me, please.
You must listen to me, please.

643
01:16:23,528 --> 01:16:24,961
Thank you all for coming.

644
01:16:26,297 --> 01:16:28,492
I've been speaking
with the Chief Inspector,

645
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,791
and I think there's been
a serious misunderstanding.

646
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:37,837
I want you all
to know that everything

647
01:16:37,975 --> 01:16:40,705
that you have seen
in my theatre is an illusion.

648
01:16:41,879 --> 01:16:45,906
It's a trick.
It's not real.

649
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,481
I can't bring loved ones
back from the grave.

650
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:55,619
I can't receive messages
from the other side.

651
01:16:57,862 --> 01:17:00,353
I apologize if
I've given you any false hope.

652
01:17:01,632 --> 01:17:03,964
My intention
has only been to entertain.

653
01:17:05,336 --> 01:17:06,564
Nothing more.

654
01:17:10,174 --> 01:17:14,133
Now I appreciate your support,
but you must go home.

655
01:17:16,147 --> 01:17:17,671
Please, you must go.

656
01:17:30,328 --> 01:17:37,063
There, now I've explained it.
So it can't be fraud. May I go?

657
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:01,221
Has he tricked you?
Is that it?

658
01:18:03,227 --> 01:18:04,717
No, your Highness.

659
01:18:04,929 --> 01:18:06,362
Then why are you failing me?

660
01:18:11,602 --> 01:18:13,365
I thought I could trust you.

661
01:18:15,573 --> 01:18:19,976
I thought you were a man I could
bring with me when I took the throne.

662
01:18:22,647 --> 01:18:23,807
Am I wrong about you?

663
01:18:23,948 --> 01:18:25,813
No. You're not wrong,
your Highness, no.

664
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:30,985
I need men who can complete
the tasks assigned to them!!

665
01:18:38,629 --> 01:18:40,824
Instead I'm surrounded by fools.

666
01:18:41,933 --> 01:18:43,992
In the end
I must do everything myself.

667
01:18:45,603 --> 01:18:47,901
I can see this case
will be no different.

668
01:19:07,425 --> 01:19:08,551
How do I look?

669
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,093
Ordinary, your Highness,
very ordinary.

670
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:19,798
I think I'm going to enjoy this.

671
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:42,486
They don't recognize you.

672
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:48,962
Good. Now keep your distance.
I don't want to be seen with a policeman.

673
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:10,607
Who are you?

674
01:21:12,116 --> 01:21:13,777
Are you Duchess Von Teschen?

675
01:21:15,019 --> 01:21:16,179
Yes.

676
01:21:17,388 --> 01:21:18,753
What's happened to you?

677
01:21:19,256 --> 01:21:22,054
She was murdered.
Were you murdered?

678
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:29,021
By who?
Did they arrest the right man?

679
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:31,157
Tell us, please.
Who murdered you?

680
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:35,605
Someone... here.

681
01:21:36,607 --> 01:21:40,177
Tell us, point him out.
Was it the Crown Prince?

682
01:21:40,378 --> 01:21:42,437
He's killed a woman before!

683
01:21:42,747 --> 01:21:44,942
Word? the Crown
Prince isn't even here.

684
01:21:45,082 --> 01:21:48,279
The Crown Prince killed her!
Something must be done!

685
01:22:15,046 --> 01:22:17,241
Chief Inspector,
are you sure you have the right man?

686
01:22:17,381 --> 01:22:18,370
Quite sure.
Excuse me.

687
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:20,074
Did you investigate
the Crown Prince?

688
01:22:20,217 --> 01:22:23,414
He cannot continue if this is true.
He must be brought to justice.

689
01:22:23,554 --> 01:22:26,280
It's not true, the magic trick is not evidence.
What is your name?

690
01:22:26,991 --> 01:22:28,618
I don't see how that matters.

691
01:22:28,759 --> 01:22:30,727
I advise you
to watch what you say, sir.

692
01:22:37,168 --> 01:22:39,102
That actress didn't
even look like Sophie.

693
01:22:40,271 --> 01:22:42,296
But the audience
is stupid and he knows it.

694
01:22:42,506 --> 01:22:46,067
He manipulates them.
He himself said nothing.

695
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:48,469
His actress said
nothing inflammatory.

696
01:22:48,612 --> 01:22:51,080
He left it to the audience
to make their accusations.

697
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:53,547
All taunts paid for by him,
of course.

698
01:22:55,586 --> 01:22:57,713
I don't suppose you made
a note of those people?

699
01:22:57,855 --> 01:23:00,050
I'm afraid we didn't
have enough men tonight.

700
01:23:00,191 --> 01:23:02,819
At the next performance
I want them all arrested,

701
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,123
every one of them-Eisenheim
and the whole troupe.

702
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:11,493
I want to have an example made
of him in front of all his followers.

703
01:23:16,006 --> 01:23:24,641
That was very foolish last night.
You can't destroy him, you know.

704
01:23:24,849 --> 01:23:26,874
You can't bring down the monarchy.

705
01:23:27,017 --> 01:23:28,006
Oh, I know I can't.

706
01:23:28,152 --> 01:23:32,851
Then don't raise her again!
Don't provoke those questions.

707
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:40,319
Herr Eisenheim,
I don't want to arrest you.

708
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:45,135
I'm a cynical man,
God knows.

709
01:23:45,269 --> 01:23:48,170
But if your
manifestations are somehow real-

710
01:23:48,305 --> 01:23:51,331
and even I'm willing to
admit you're a very special person,

711
01:23:51,475 --> 01:23:54,308
and if it's a trick
then it's equally impressive--

712
01:23:54,445 --> 01:23:59,712
Either way you have a gift,
so don't make me put you in jail.

713
01:24:01,318 --> 01:24:02,910
Promise me you won't do it again.

714
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:05,589
I promise you
you'll enjoy this next show.

715
01:24:09,193 --> 01:24:10,217
What do you want?

716
01:24:10,895 --> 01:24:11,919
Nothing.

717
01:24:12,463 --> 01:24:14,590
Then why bring her back?

718
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,393
Just to be with her.

719
01:24:21,505 --> 01:24:23,200
To be with her.

720
01:24:33,384 --> 01:24:34,949
-Everything is ready?
-Yes, sir.

721
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:36,816
We're trying to assess
how he might escape.

722
01:24:37,054 --> 01:24:39,784
He will not escape!
I want guards at every door and window!

723
01:24:39,924 --> 01:24:41,016
Sir.

724
01:24:48,632 --> 01:24:51,294
I want to apologize
to you for my behavior of late.

725
01:24:51,535 --> 01:24:53,765
But I want to make it up to you
if you'll listen to a proposition.

726
01:24:53,904 --> 01:24:54,962
Well, I don't know.

727
01:24:55,105 --> 01:24:57,005
I'll make it worth your while, Josef.

728
01:24:57,608 --> 01:24:58,836
You know,
I'm very busy right now.

729
01:24:58,976 --> 01:25:00,876
I haven't just been sitting
around waiting for you.

730
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:02,444
No, no, of course.

731
01:25:07,418 --> 01:25:12,583
I want you to assume control
of all my finances and my assets.

732
01:25:13,457 --> 01:25:14,788
Everything.

733
01:25:15,092 --> 01:25:16,150
Everything?

734
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:19,093
Yes, including this theatre

735
01:25:19,563 --> 01:25:21,292
and all the receipts
from tonight's performance,

736
01:25:21,432 --> 01:25:23,366
which I offer
with my sincere thanks.

737
01:25:28,005 --> 01:25:29,097
What do you say?

738
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:33,032
All right, I'll do it.

739
01:25:33,177 --> 01:25:35,407
Good. Good.

740
01:25:36,747 --> 01:25:38,715
Would you like me
to introduce you tonight?

741
01:25:39,516 --> 01:25:43,008
No. Tonight just enjoy the show.

742
01:26:05,075 --> 01:26:08,169
Excuse me, Chief Inspector,
I'm Josef Fischer, Eisenheim's manager.

743
01:26:08,512 --> 01:26:09,843
Yes, I remember.

744
01:26:10,814 --> 01:26:12,679
What's going on?
Why all the police?

745
01:26:12,816 --> 01:26:14,681
Precautions,
Herr Fischer, precautions.

746
01:26:15,219 --> 01:26:17,050
Are you planning
to arrest Eisenheim?

747
01:26:17,321 --> 01:26:19,016
That's entirely up to him.

748
01:27:04,001 --> 01:27:05,628
It's Duchess Von Teschen.

749
01:27:17,781 --> 01:27:19,271
Why were you murdered?

750
01:27:21,352 --> 01:27:22,717
I was leaving him.

751
01:27:22,853 --> 01:27:24,013
Leaving who?

752
01:27:24,188 --> 01:27:24,984
The Crown Prince?

753
01:27:25,122 --> 01:27:26,987
Of course
it was the Crown Prince.

754
01:27:27,124 --> 01:27:28,148
We won't stand for it!

755
01:27:28,292 --> 01:27:30,021
I tried to get away.

756
01:27:34,531 --> 01:27:38,524
I was wearing my locket
when I died but now it's gone.

757
01:27:38,669 --> 01:27:39,693
It's lost.

758
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:41,429
Tell us, please,
who murdered you?

759
01:27:41,572 --> 01:27:42,470
Was it the Crown Prince?

760
01:27:42,606 --> 01:27:44,233
We must do something!

761
01:27:57,755 --> 01:27:58,983
Get up!

762
01:28:02,226 --> 01:28:06,128
In the name of his Imperial
Majesty and the city of Vienna,

763
01:28:06,663 --> 01:28:09,860
I hereby arrest
Eduard Abramovitz,

764
01:28:10,134 --> 01:28:12,694
also known as
Eisenheim the Illusionist,

765
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:16,505
on charges of disturbing public order,
charlatanism,

766
01:28:16,707 --> 01:28:19,801
and threats against the empire!

767
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:32,309
Find him!

768
01:29:43,427 --> 01:29:44,451
Where is he?

769
01:29:44,695 --> 01:29:45,787
He was right there.

770
01:29:45,929 --> 01:29:48,156
-How is his trick done?
-No trick.

771
01:29:48,298 --> 01:29:49,265
How is it done!

772
01:29:49,399 --> 01:29:51,162
I don't know.
Nobody knows.

773
01:29:58,575 --> 01:29:59,974
Dammit!

774
01:33:47,637 --> 01:33:50,765
I had my driver take the sword
to police headquarters.

775
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:54,807
My men will examine it and see

776
01:33:54,945 --> 01:33:57,937
if it matches the gemstone found
on Duchess Von Teschen's body.

777
01:33:58,081 --> 01:33:59,708
I have no doubt that it will.

778
01:34:03,887 --> 01:34:10,190
And after that, I came in here
and you asked me why I was late.

779
01:34:12,062 --> 01:34:13,757
You've stolen
Imperial property.

780
01:34:13,864 --> 01:34:15,627
That seems trivial
compared with murder.

781
01:34:15,766 --> 01:34:18,098
Even if that were true,
you have no jurisdiction here.

782
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:19,361
That's right.

783
01:34:19,703 --> 01:34:22,433
You may do as you
wish here without consequence.

784
01:34:24,007 --> 01:34:29,104
Nobody can punish you,
except one man.

785
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:30,177
Who's that?

786
01:34:30,313 --> 01:34:31,575
The Emperor.

787
01:34:32,949 --> 01:34:36,146
I don't suppose he'll leave
his crown to a murderer, do you?

788
01:34:39,022 --> 01:34:40,512
He'll never believe you.

789
01:34:40,991 --> 01:34:41,980
Maybe not.

790
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:51,190
But I wrote a letter to his
general staff telling them everything.

791
01:34:52,369 --> 01:34:54,769
Including your plan
to overthrow the Emperor.

792
01:34:55,672 --> 01:34:57,162
I know they'll listen to that.

793
01:34:58,942 --> 01:35:01,433
You'll not take the throne,
not with my help.

794
01:35:01,845 --> 01:35:03,676
You no longer want
to be Chief of Police?

795
01:35:05,482 --> 01:35:06,380
Mayor of Vienna?

796
01:35:06,516 --> 01:35:09,747
You don't want to be a baron,
an aristocrat?

797
01:35:11,021 --> 01:35:13,182
I'm afraid that's out
of the question at this point.

798
01:35:19,496 --> 01:35:22,294
You fool, he's tricking you.
He's manipulating you.

799
01:35:22,899 --> 01:35:24,696
He had the sword
at the command performance.

800
01:35:24,835 --> 01:35:27,429
He could have pried the stones loose 
then and planted them here.

801
01:35:27,571 --> 01:35:29,294
-He's planted everything.
-You were drunk..

802
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:34,240
It's all a trick.
It's an illusion.

803
01:35:35,712 --> 01:35:37,839
Perhaps there's truth
in this illusion.

804
01:35:52,028 --> 01:35:54,826
You need to wire your driver
and have the sword returned.

805
01:35:55,265 --> 01:35:56,197
Or what?

806
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,597
I'll shoot you.
Perhaps I'll shoot you anyway.

807
01:35:59,035 --> 01:36:01,970
And then you'll have killed
a police inspector and a Duchess.

808
01:36:02,105 --> 01:36:03,629
Or perhaps you'll kill yourself.

809
01:36:03,807 --> 01:36:07,504
You, uh, committed suicide,
distraught at having failed your leader.

810
01:36:24,261 --> 01:36:27,719
Ah, some officers
of the general staff I'd guess.

811
01:36:29,733 --> 01:36:31,166
They must've received my letter.

812
01:36:40,277 --> 01:36:41,608
What do you want?

813
01:36:41,745 --> 01:36:43,303
I don't want anything.

814
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:49,083
Fine. Fine.
You shall have nothing.

815
01:36:57,294 --> 01:36:58,261
Gentlemen.

816
01:36:58,495 --> 01:37:00,588
The situation is so obvious.

817
01:37:00,964 --> 01:37:02,761
Everyone's completely incompetent.

818
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,299
My father runs the Empire
into the ground and no one notices.

819
01:37:07,437 --> 01:37:08,199
No one does anything about it.

820
01:37:08,338 --> 01:37:11,205
I propose to cleanup the mess
and you thank me by betraying me.

821
01:37:11,341 --> 01:37:13,969
Well, you're all becoming irrelevant.
You'll all be replaced.

822
01:37:14,978 --> 01:37:16,912
The country
will be run by mongrels.

823
01:37:17,881 --> 01:37:22,081
A thousand different voices screaming
to be heard and nothing will be done!

824
01:37:22,218 --> 01:37:23,150
Nothing!

825
01:37:23,286 --> 01:37:24,810
I've done everything I can!

826
01:37:26,456 --> 01:37:33,487
Too much!
Far too much.

827
01:37:33,797 --> 01:37:38,825
Your Highness, are you in there?
Your Highness, open door.

828
01:37:39,703 --> 01:37:42,103
Please, open the door.

829
01:37:43,506 --> 01:37:46,839
By your father's authority
I insist you open the door.

830
01:37:47,544 --> 01:37:49,671
You must open the door!

831
01:37:49,913 --> 01:37:51,210
You're all fools...

832
01:37:52,349 --> 01:37:53,941
Please, your Highness.

833
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:58,612
And I can't stand it.
I won't stand it.

834
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:02,756
Break down the door.
Break it down!

835
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:08,358
What happened?

836
01:38:09,032 --> 01:38:10,761
The Crown Prince
just shot himself.

837
01:38:57,447 --> 01:38:59,415
Are you Chief Inspector Uhl?

838
01:39:00,483 --> 01:39:01,882
I used to be.

839
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:33,010
You! Who gave you this!
Who gave you this!

840
01:39:33,149 --> 01:39:34,616
Herr, Eisenheim!

841
01:39:36,352 --> 01:39:37,842
When!

842
01:41:05,141 --> 01:41:06,540
All aboard!

843
01:41:07,343 --> 01:41:08,674
Tickets and papers.

844
01:41:12,782 --> 01:41:14,511
All aboard!

845
01:41:43,947 --> 01:41:44,914
When it's done...

846
01:41:45,849 --> 01:41:48,079
...you'll travel ahead
with her and I shall follow.

847
01:41:48,251 --> 01:41:50,617
And she understands everything
this entails?

848
01:41:50,753 --> 01:41:51,777
Completely.

849
01:41:52,121 --> 01:41:54,214
Do you think
Eisenheim's behind all this?

850
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:00,791
So, what does it mean to die?

851
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,160
What do you want?

852
01:42:06,369 --> 01:42:07,768
To be with her.

853
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:09,570
To be with her.

854
01:42:14,077 --> 01:42:18,138
Chief Inspector,
there's one thing you should know.

855
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:24,854
Your sword is very beautiful.
Might I see it?

856
01:42:24,988 --> 01:42:26,148
You're drunk.

857
01:42:26,256 --> 01:42:27,689
You were drunk.

858
01:42:41,571 --> 01:42:43,835
He's a charlatan
and he's a faker.

859
01:42:43,973 --> 01:42:45,406
He's plotted everything.

860
01:42:57,587 --> 01:43:00,181
Everything you have seen
is an illusion.

861
01:43:00,723 --> 01:43:01,883
It's a trick.
