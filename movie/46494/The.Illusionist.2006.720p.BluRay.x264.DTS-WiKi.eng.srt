1
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,559
It's her! I know it's her!

2
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:54,000
She wants to tell us something!

3
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:56,628
We must do something! Please.

4
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:14,081
In the name of his Imperial Majesty and the city of Vienna,

5
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:18,358
I hereby arrest Edward Abramowitz.

6
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:21,555
Also known as Eisenheim the Illusionist.

7
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:25,862
On charges of disturbing public order, charlatanism,

8
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:28,493
and threats against the Empire.

9
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:29,967
Leave him alone!

10
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,444
They're arresting him! They're arresting Eisenheim!

11
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,273
Chief Inspector Uhl.

12
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:17,346
You're late.

13
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:19,250
My apologies, your Highness.

14
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:22,324
I was attending to the loose ends of the case.

15
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,822
Are there still loose ends?

16
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:26,221
Very few.

17
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:28,562
Did he do it again?

18
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:31,966
How does he do it?

19
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,860
I'm afraid I still don't know.

20
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:39,208
Did you ask him?

21
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:41,603
He's not talking at this point.

22
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,807
Well, I'm sure you have methods for that kind of thing.

23
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:54,686
I want you to put an end to it. Surely you have something on him.

24
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:57,618
Something from his past?

25
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:03,830
Yes. Yes, I think I do.

26
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:12,741
In fact we know all about his life.

27
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:17,406
We've spoken to almost everyone who ever knew him.

28
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:28,822
As a boy, I'm told he had a chance encounter with a traveling magician.

29
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:35,294
Boy.

30
00:07:08,798 --> 00:07:10,925
One version of the story was that the man

31
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:16,596
himself then vanished along with the tree.

32
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:20,175
Who knows what actually happened?

33
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,424
People began to think he had some kind of special power,

34
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,620
or at least that he was a bit different.

35
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,530
And then he met her.

36
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:00,343
Don't drop it.

37
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,041
Careful, you're going to trip.

38
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:03,777
Drop it, you muck-snipe.

39
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,286
Oh! Watch out for that hole, alley rat!

40
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:07,549
Drop it!

41
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:26,768
Pick a card. Put it back in the deck.

42
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:35,575
Now, watch.

43
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:51,327
Duchess Von Teschen, you can't be in a place like this.

44
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,698
They're peasants. Remember who you are.

45
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:28,870
She was brought back to the castle and they were forbidden to see each other.

46
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:32,464
But soon they were doing just that.

47
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:36,208
Over the next few years they could always find a way to be together.

48
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,874
Quick, come on.

49
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:47,356
In China there's a magician that could make anything disappear.

50
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:49,524
A house, a wagon, anything.

51
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,355
We'll go visit him.

52
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:54,191
They can't stop us if we want to be together.

53
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:56,063
They'll never find us.

54
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,561
Do you promise you'll take me with you?

55
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:01,860
One day I will.

56
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:08,210
One day we'll run away together. We'll disappear.

57
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,615
There's a secret way to open it.

58
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:03,626
I wanted a picture.

59
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:26,154
Sophie, are you there?

60
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:30,253
We must hurry! They're coming!

61
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,518
Duchess von Teschen!

62
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:39,192
Duchess von Teschen!

63
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:41,530
Duchess von Teschen!

64
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:47,676
Make us disappear. Make us disappear.

65
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:50,576
Duchess von Teschen!

66
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,281
Stop. Stop.

67
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:08,492
Don't do this. Let me go. Let go.

68
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:19,165
No! Please, let go! No! Let her go, please!

69
00:12:21,277 --> 00:12:22,904
Let go! Stop it!

70
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,104
Sophie!

71
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,645
Eduard!

72
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:27,505
-Sophie! -Eduard!

73
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:30,208
Sophie.

74
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,652
Stay away from her or next time we'll arrest you and your family.

75
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:51,073
What happened next remains a mystery. We do know that he traveled the world.

76
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:53,908
That he began to perform his magic in public.

77
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:56,743
That he changed his name to Eisenheim.

78
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:04,375
And then almost fifteen years later he appeared in Vienna.

79
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:20,496
Life and death, space and time, fate and chance.

80
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,071
These are the forces of the universe.

81
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,700
Tonight, ladies and gentleman,

82
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:32,874
I present to you a man who has unlocked these mysteries.

83
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:38,716
From the furthest corners of the world where the dark arts still hold sway,

84
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:45,323
he returns to us to demonstrate how nature's laws may be bent.

85
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:50,157
I give you... Eisenheim.

86
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:02,034
Might I borrow a handkerchief from someone?

87
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:06,608
You, Madam.

88
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:27,098
Thank you. Ah, be patient.

89
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:34,467
Now, if you please, I would like to continue with an examination of time.

90
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:39,274
From the moment we enter this life we are in the flow of it.

91
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:45,016
We measure it and we mark it but we cannot defy it.

92
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:48,681
We cannot even speed it up or slow it down.

93
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:52,494
Or can we?

94
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,358
Have we not each experienced a sensation

95
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:59,161
that a beautiful moment seemed to pass too quickly?

96
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:02,865
And wished that we could make it linger?

97
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:08,807
Or felt time slow on a dull day

98
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:11,945
and wished that we could speed things up a bit?

99
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:20,977
I assure you, they're quite real.

100
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,687
And you, Madam, where is your handkerchief?

101
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,683
Bravo! Very good.

102
00:17:06,162 --> 00:17:09,461
Give us something. Please, please, give us something.

103
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:11,694
-Please. -What's all this?

104
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:13,128
We're poor.

105
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:15,129
Do you think you're poor?

106
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:16,465
Yes.

107
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:22,168
I want to show you something. You're not poor.

108
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:26,681
You have everything that you need right here.

109
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,243
Thank you.

110
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:31,784
Thank you.

111
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:35,381
Thank you.

112
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:42,297
And that's yours. And this too.

113
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:02,280
-Good morning. -Good morning.

114
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,179
-Coffee? -No.

115
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:07,519
Strudel? I have two.

116
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:09,625
Nothing, thank you.

117
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:14,157
You look very pleased with yourself.

118
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:16,029
How are the receipts?

119
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:17,598
Not bad. A three-quarter house.

120
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:18,392
Well done.

121
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:19,592
But we're going to do better than that.

122
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,430
Listen to this. Listen.

123
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:24,900
"There is no argument that his uncanny displays separate

124
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,340
him from the ranks of garden variety stage wizards.

125
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:34,944
Some of his effects transcend mere illusion and approach the realm of art.

126
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:38,576
He is very young to be so masterful.

127
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:42,218
You see? We'll pack the house with this review.

128
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:45,460
We are going to make more money than you ever dreamed of.

129
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:50,061
But if it was mechanical, maybe he had it wrapped in some kind of bark?

130
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,860
Oh, yeah, of course I thought of that.

131
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:53,865
It's the butterflies I'm trying to work out.

132
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:56,661
Oh, for Pete's sake, invisible wire.

133
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:58,133
Too obvious.

134
00:18:58,374 --> 00:18:59,932
How many men have you detailed for tonight?

135
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:02,603
We have eight men inside, another eight out front.

136
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:05,113
Perhaps you'll get another look at your butterflies.

137
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:14,717
Check the last ten rows there.

138
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:39,046
You! Don't touch that! Put that down!

139
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:39,804
Ah, Herr Eisenheim.

140
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,339
Who are you and what do you think you're doing?

141
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:45,782
I'm Chief Inspector Walter Uhl and I'm inspecting your theatre.

142
00:19:45,955 --> 00:19:47,354
I've seen you perform.

143
00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:50,219
Very impressive. Very impressive.

144
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,621
How can we help you, Inspector?

145
00:19:53,062 --> 00:19:55,758
You will be honored to know that the Crown Prince plans

146
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:57,297
to attend your performance tonight.

147
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:58,024
The Crown Prince?

148
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:01,830
Yes! So, obviously we have to inspect the theatre.

149
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:04,496
I think that one's a bit small for an assassin, don't you?

150
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:08,005
Yes, the orange tree.

151
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:10,112
You know, I have seen things like this before

152
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:14,945
but never one like that. Extraordinary.

153
00:20:15,084 --> 00:20:15,880
Thank you.

154
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:21,854
I have been puzzling over how it works, especially how the butterflies fly.

155
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,591
I assure you your secret is safe with me.

156
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:31,432
I'm an officer of the law after all, and a bit of an amateur conjourer.

157
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:32,493
Are you really?

158
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:38,940
Yes. Well, card tricks, coins, uh, slight of hand, yes?

159
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:43,872
But nothing fancy. Perhaps you'll give me a tip?

160
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:49,411
Yes, all right. I'll show you one I'm very fond of.

161
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:50,541
Are you a gambling man?

162
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:52,176
On occasion, yes.

163
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:54,152
I will bet you the secret of the orange tree

164
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,191
that I can guess which hand you place this in every time.

165
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,822
Excellent.

166
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:04,428
Put it in your fist, raise your hand against your forehead,

167
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:07,001
concentrate on it, form a mental picture.

168
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:09,501
-Yes. -Have you got it? -Yes.

169
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:11,367
Put your hands in front of you.

170
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:16,869
It's in your left.

171
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,655
-Well ! -A lucky guess, perhaps.

172
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:21,842
You have a confederate who signals you.

173
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:23,975
No. It's more primitive than that.

174
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,950
Uh-huh.

175
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:29,114
When you raise your hand to your head, the blood drains from it.

176
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:31,753
It will be paler every time.

177
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:40,191
Oh, oh, I like that very much.

178
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,503
Please take it with my compliments.

179
00:21:42,638 --> 00:21:46,199
Why, thank you. Eh, the blood drains.

180
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:50,438
Now, Inspector, if you don't mind,

181
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,843
I've got to prepare for tonight's performance.

182
00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:54,015
Ah.

183
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:09,690
Please stand for his Imperial Highness, Crown Prince Leopold.

184
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,996
I thought we might end this evening with a discussion of the soul.

185
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:45,029
All of the greatest religions speak

186
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,727
of the soul's endurance beyond the end of life.

187
00:22:49,071 --> 00:22:53,064
So, what then does it mean to die?

188
00:22:54,877 --> 00:22:57,539
I need a volunteer from the audience.

189
00:22:57,913 --> 00:23:05,183
Someone not afraid of death. Please, someone?

190
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:07,855
I assure you no tragedy will befall you.

191
00:23:37,453 --> 00:23:39,717
It's an honor, Duchess Von Teschen.

192
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:54,728
Do you know me?

193
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:57,939
No.

194
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,666
You're quite certain that we've never met before?

195
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:04,345
Yes, of course.

196
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:24,124
Now please gaze directly into my eyes. Look nowhere else.

197
00:25:00,903 --> 00:25:06,773
Wave to yourself. Turn in a circle.

198
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:16,814
Now, bow to yourself.

199
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:00,727
Away.

200
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:04,689
They must have liked you.

201
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:06,818
They've waited for you nearly five minutes.

202
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:13,394
Your Highness, may I introduce Eisenheim the Illusionist?

203
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:18,067
Well done.

204
00:27:18,107 --> 00:27:20,598
Thank you for coming. I hope you enjoyed it.

205
00:27:20,843 --> 00:27:23,073
Oh, we more than enjoyed it.

206
00:27:23,212 --> 00:27:25,680
Stimulated great debate amongst us, hasn't it?

207
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:28,305
Except of course for your assistant, Duchess Von Teschen.

208
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,350
You seemed to have struck her quite speechless.

209
00:27:30,652 --> 00:27:32,984
A feat in itself. Did you hypnotize her?

210
00:27:34,223 --> 00:27:35,383
In a fashion.

211
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:36,956
I'd like to learn that trick.

212
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:42,726
Rainier here thinks you have supernatural powers.

213
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:46,794
Do you claim supernatural powers?

214
00:27:47,803 --> 00:27:49,498
I've never said anything of that kind.

215
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:51,469
Then you won't mind a question or two.

216
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:52,835
Now let's not ruin it.

217
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:55,443
You needn't divulge anything I can't guess.

218
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,168
As you wish.

219
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:03,315
Your assistants are behind a mirror somewhere in robes obviously.

220
00:28:03,685 --> 00:28:07,644
Lights in the frame perhaps to illuminate them, or angled mirrors?

221
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,190
That would be one way to do it.

222
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:13,393
I think I understand it all except the ghost.

223
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:15,724
That was very, very good.

224
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:18,261
Another viewing perhaps?

225
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:21,970
You must come to the Hofburg next time. We'll make an evening of it.

226
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:24,333
That will be my pleasure.

227
00:28:25,174 --> 00:28:27,665
So be it. Sophie?

228
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:41,321
And we'll gather our best minds next time. You'll really have a challenge then.

229
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:45,825
Then I'll prepare something special. Perhaps I'll make you disappear.

230
00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:02,343
Oh, my God, when he volunteered her I heard the crashing sound

231
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:04,638
of money falling on me in piles.

232
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:08,516
Every lady of means in Vienna will want to get up there with you now.

233
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:10,479
What a showoff.

234
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:13,150
His father would have died if he had seen such a display.

235
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:15,256
She didn't seem too happy about it either.

236
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:16,822
Well, she'd better get used to it.

237
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,192
-How's that? -Word is she'll marry him soon.

238
00:29:20,495 --> 00:29:23,556
-Really? -Taking her chances if you ask me.

239
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:24,931
Why?

240
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,328
He likes to give his lady friends a good thrashing now and again.

241
00:29:29,338 --> 00:29:31,169
People say he pushed one of them off a balcony

242
00:29:31,306 --> 00:29:33,331
just to cover the beating he had given her.

243
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:04,069
For Herr Eisenheim.

244
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:48,215
Hello, Sophie.

245
00:30:53,221 --> 00:30:57,624
When I was on the stage, you knew me right away.

246
00:30:57,926 --> 00:31:02,886
It took me a moment but, yes, I knew.

247
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:04,521
You could have said something.

248
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,362
I thought you'd figure it out eventually.

249
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:09,094
Yes, I would have.

250
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:12,129
I would have come another night, volunteered,

251
00:31:12,274 --> 00:31:14,174
walked right on stage and said hello.

252
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:16,140
And then you'd really have had to move quickly.

253
00:31:16,645 --> 00:31:18,340
I suspect you would have.

254
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:23,446
I don't understand why.

255
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:31,524
Perhaps for the same reasons you find it prudent to meet in a carriage.

256
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:34,291
It's just a game I have to play with them.

257
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:38,422
I'm followed everywhere.

258
00:31:39,301 --> 00:31:41,166
It's-it's supposed to be for my protection.

259
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:49,939
Yes. So, I hear congratulations are in order.

260
00:31:50,445 --> 00:31:51,742
What for?

261
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:55,878
They say you'll be the princess.

262
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:57,574
It's not decided at all.

263
00:31:58,186 --> 00:31:59,448
Ah.

264
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:02,715
It makes a certain sense, I suppose.

265
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:05,892
We've known each other for years and of course our families.

266
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:12,466
He's very intelligent. A little too intelligent for his own good.

267
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:21,431
You're lucky, you know. To have broken free as you did.

268
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:28,176
I often wish that I had...

269
00:32:30,652 --> 00:32:31,710
Wished what?

270
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:37,491
I wished that I would see you again.

271
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:44,626
And now you have.

272
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:51,472
Yes, now I have.

273
00:32:58,547 --> 00:33:00,913
I look forward to seeing you again at the Hofburg.

274
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:02,616
Until then.

275
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:28,669
Here's the report on Duchess Von Teschen.

276
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,778
Mmm. Anything interesting?

277
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:32,676
See for yourself.

278
00:33:40,622 --> 00:33:41,953
The magician?

279
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:46,558
They drove around for half an hour, then he got out near the theatre.

280
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:52,696
What do you want us to do?

281
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:12,986
Join us for a drink?

282
00:34:20,795 --> 00:34:21,989
Please.

283
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:34,936
You like something to eat, something to drink, mmm?

284
00:34:35,277 --> 00:34:36,574
No, thank you.

285
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:43,444
Herr Eisenheim, I'm going to ask you a question that may not seem friendly.

286
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:45,917
But I assure you, in fact, is.

287
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:52,858
What is your relationship with the Duchess Von Teschen?

288
00:34:53,628 --> 00:34:55,653
You're right, that doesn't seem friendly.

289
00:34:55,797 --> 00:34:57,822
Oh, but that is precisely my point.

290
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:04,265
For, you see, where others might judge a discreet carriage ride

291
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:11,141
for what it seemed to be, I am willing to find out what it actually was.

292
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:15,582
All right. We were childhood acquaintances.

293
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,842
Acquaintances?

294
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:21,950
Childhood friends. My father was a cabinetmaker.

295
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:24,955
He made the furniture for her family's house.

296
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:29,555
I see, the cabinet maker's son friends with a--

297
00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:31,529
Has there been a complaint?

298
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,598
Oh, no, no.

299
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:33,928
If there'd been a complaint...

300
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:38,398
Well, we'd be having a very, uh, different sort of conversation.

301
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:44,240
Yes. He relies on you for that sort of thing, does he?

302
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:46,877
I'm a simple public servant, Herr Eisenheim.

303
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:48,276
That's not what I hear.

304
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:52,252
I hear you'll be the Chief of Police very soon.

305
00:35:53,054 --> 00:35:55,989
Maybe Mayor of Vienna? Party Secretary?

306
00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:57,786
All subject to his whim.

307
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:00,689
You better hope he doesn't dissolve the Parliament before you get there.

308
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:05,364
Now, the Prince has some progressive ideas, but he will make a fine Emperor.

309
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,492
Well, they say you're very close to him, so I'm sure you'll be fine.

310
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:13,665
Look-- Yes, indeed, they say that I'm very close to the Prince.

311
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,578
But the simple truth of the matter is, Herr Eisenheim,

312
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:19,611
I'm the son of a butcher.

313
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:21,875
He's the heir to the Empire.

314
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,317
How close could we be to such as him, Hmm?

315
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:28,020
Do you see my point?

316
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:35,190
Don't fool yourself that you can play in their game.

317
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:43,502
I've served on the edge of it for many, many years

318
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:48,408
and I can tell you with certainty there's no trick they haven't seen.

319
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:54,179
It's not worth it.

320
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:08,053
My guest tonight is not a showman at all, but rather a wizard

321
00:37:08,496 --> 00:37:14,366
who has sold his soul to the devil in return for unholy powers.

322
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,037
Or so at least some of our friends here would have us believe.

323
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:25,571
But fear not, everything can and will be explained.

324
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,714
All mysteries penetrated.

325
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:34,379
Here, Here. Well said. Well said.

326
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:00,214
Is that the emperor?

327
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:01,679
Ah, yes, your father.

328
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:03,808
I didn't think he was invited .

329
00:38:15,897 --> 00:38:18,593
A fair likeness of the old man.

330
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:22,434
Too modern a style for him, of course.

331
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,638
I'm afraid I'm not much of a painter.

332
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:27,840
It's true, there are no brush strokes in this painting,

333
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:30,740
I can see that clearly.

334
00:38:31,413 --> 00:38:36,976
So to achieve the color some sort of chemical must be interacting, presumably.

335
00:38:37,385 --> 00:38:41,754
Some sort of sprayer up your sleeve? May I?

336
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,989
If you feel you must.

337
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,522
I do.

338
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:48,953
Oh, let the man do his show.

339
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:52,360
You want me to just sit there when it's so obvious?

340
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,694
I do.

341
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:57,371
He tries to trick you. I try to enlighten you.

342
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,132
Which is the more noble pursuit?

343
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:03,299
May we have the lights please, so his Highness can better see?

344
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:06,375
See here, Leopold, let's have a show.

345
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:07,577
Here, here.

346
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:10,115
Come on, Leopold, get on with it.

347
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:13,448
Very well, I propose a challenge.

348
00:39:14,923 --> 00:39:24,889
Why don't you astonish us, if you can, without all the gadgetry?

349
00:39:26,568 --> 00:39:27,933
As you wish.

350
00:39:29,504 --> 00:39:34,100
Your sword is very beautiful. Might I see it?

351
00:39:34,275 --> 00:39:35,333
Certainly.

352
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:39,677
May I?

353
00:39:46,855 --> 00:39:49,346
Where does power flow from?

354
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:54,855
Skill or destiny, or divine right?

355
00:39:57,232 --> 00:40:00,668
We all know the story of a sword called Excalibur.

356
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:11,468
Excalibur's blade was fixed in stone, and there it stayed.

357
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:17,578
Many worthy knights tried to pull the sword from the stone.

358
00:40:19,254 --> 00:40:24,453
Only Arthur succeeded proving his right to rule.

359
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:31,264
Who can take this sword? You sir, can you take the sword?

360
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:54,420
No surprise there.

361
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:56,188
Perhaps you, sir.

362
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,255
Not so eager, cousin.

363
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:19,736
You shall live a long life.

364
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,612
Thank you for your indulgence.

365
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:40,023
Come now, if you can't pull it out you'll never be Emperor.

366
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:42,033
Your father will live to be a hundred.

367
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:58,882
The sword to its rightful owner!

368
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:11,559
That's enough light entertainment for this evening.

369
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,796
For more serious discussion, please join me for a drink.

370
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:30,682
Shut him down.

371
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:33,682
Well, he's very popular, your Highness.

372
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:35,254
I'm sure you'll find a way.

373
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,024
What did you do to him?

374
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:46,829
I gave him what he asked for.

375
00:42:48,036 --> 00:42:50,504
What would possess you to do something so foolish?

376
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:54,931
Duchess Von Teschen, you must come along, my dear.

377
00:42:55,610 --> 00:43:00,013
We don't want to keep the Prince waiting. Did you enjoy the show?

378
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:00,976
It was wonderful, wasn't it?

379
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:02,446
It was amusing.

380
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:43,521
Who told you where to find me?

381
00:43:43,825 --> 00:43:45,019
Your manager.

382
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,160
I told him if he wants to stay in Vienna, you need my help.

383
00:43:48,296 --> 00:43:50,560
Ah, so I'm to be driven from the city, is that it?

384
00:43:50,832 --> 00:43:52,322
Good, I shall relish it.

385
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:57,734
Stop it! I came here to try to help you.

386
00:43:58,005 --> 00:44:01,702
Why! Why should you possibly care what happens to me now?

387
00:44:01,843 --> 00:44:04,368
You were my friend. I am your friend.

388
00:44:04,512 --> 00:44:07,447
We knew each other very briefly a long time ago.

389
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:08,844
You don't know me at all.

390
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:13,577
Then why did you speak to me? Why did you even bother talking-

391
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:32,065
And you kept it all this time.

392
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:40,368
I used to sit and stare at your picture trying to imagine where you were.

393
00:45:41,776 --> 00:45:45,610
At night I'd have dreams I had gone with you,

394
00:45:47,315 --> 00:45:49,909
and then I'd wake up and realize where I was.

395
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:01,993
But in my dreams you had shorter hair and no beard.

396
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:13,299
Where did you go when you left?

397
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,740
To my uncle's farm near Prague.

398
00:46:19,814 --> 00:46:21,805
How exotic.

399
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:31,849
I went to Russia, then Asia Minor, and then the Orient for many years.

400
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:34,026
So long.

401
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:36,619
I always meant to return.

402
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,035
I just- I kept thinking I'd find it around the next corner.

403
00:46:45,172 --> 00:46:46,537
What?

404
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:50,804
A real mystery.

405
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:56,583
I saw remarkable things, but the only mystery

406
00:46:56,717 --> 00:47:02,087
I never solved was why my heart couldn't let go of you.

407
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:28,905
He wants me to go to Budapest with him next week to announce our engagement.

408
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:37,549
He wants the Hungarians behind him. They're going to crown him King.

409
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:40,124
I'm sure his father will have something to say about that.

410
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:42,024
He plans to overthrow his father.

411
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:48,329
That could go very badly for him... and for you.

412
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:50,597
You shouldn't be involved.

413
00:47:51,605 --> 00:47:53,038
I am part of his plan.

414
00:47:54,175 --> 00:47:56,803
He only gets Hungary by aligning himself with my family.

415
00:47:57,812 --> 00:47:59,109
Leave him.

416
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:01,244
It's not that easy.

417
00:48:01,682 --> 00:48:04,446
Call it off and come away with me.

418
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:08,446
Or don't say anything and we'll just go.

419
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:15,794
As long as we are alive he'll hunt us.

420
00:48:16,263 --> 00:48:18,288
And when he finds us he'll kill us.

421
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:38,783
Look at me. Do you truly want to leave with me?

422
00:48:43,524 --> 00:48:46,857
Yes, I do.

423
00:49:23,431 --> 00:49:26,798
There you are. As I predicted they shut us down.

424
00:49:27,268 --> 00:49:30,635
Are you happy now, hmm? You made your point.

425
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:34,336
It doesn't matter that we were sold out for the whole run.

426
00:49:34,475 --> 00:49:38,343
No, look. You got it off your chest.

427
00:49:38,512 --> 00:49:39,706
Do we have money?

428
00:49:39,847 --> 00:49:40,643
What?

429
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:42,180
Do we have any money saved?

430
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:45,513
Yes, we have some. But we could have had much, much more.

431
00:49:47,188 --> 00:49:48,815
Mmm, it will have to do.

432
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:53,152
And the second account, all of it.

433
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,057
Of course, Herr Eisenheim.

434
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:01,425
Thank you.

435
00:50:56,757 --> 00:50:58,884
And you have no doubt it was Duchess Von Teschen?

436
00:50:59,026 --> 00:51:00,425
I'd stake my life on it.

437
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:04,090
What was in the suitcase?

438
00:51:04,932 --> 00:51:06,194
I don't know.

439
00:51:17,178 --> 00:51:18,736
He's by the first car.

440
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:46,963
The map will show you where to meet.

441
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:51,542
When it's done, you'll travel ahead with her and I shall follow.

442
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,977
And she understands everything this entails?

443
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:58,346
Completely. There's not a lot of time.

444
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:34,577
As you know, we sometimes follow Duchess Von Teschen for her protection.

445
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:40,351
Yesterday she was seen in the company of another man.

446
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:41,819
What man?

447
00:52:42,997 --> 00:52:45,864
Eisenheim, the Illusionist.

448
00:52:47,134 --> 00:52:48,601
What were they doing?

449
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:50,397
Well, they were meeting and, uh--

450
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:55,270
Touching? Kissing? Were they fucking?

451
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:57,570
Not that we observed, no.

452
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:02,071
However, I have reason to believe that they may be planning something together.

453
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:05,748
It's possible they may be leaving.

454
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:08,344
I'm not certain of anything yet, your Highness.

455
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:10,616
Thank you, Inspector.

456
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:13,352
We can of course acquire more information-

457
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:47,516
He spent the afternoon in Vienna with his father.

458
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:49,360
He's expected shortly.

459
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:27,025
What a surprise. I thought you didn't like it here.

460
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:33,973
I suppose you think you're very clever

461
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:41,912
and very democratic in your friendships, aren't you?

462
00:54:42,149 --> 00:54:43,639
What are you talking about?

463
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:48,186
Your magician friend. I know you've been with him.

464
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:54,425
It's true. We've been friends since childhood.

465
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:56,825
You sleep with all your childhood friends?

466
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,657
I will not be spoken to this way.

467
00:54:58,899 --> 00:55:00,924
You'll be spoken to as I wish to speak to you.

468
00:55:01,402 --> 00:55:02,664
You're drunk.

469
00:55:03,036 --> 00:55:05,095
You're getting quite old, aren't you?

470
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,005
You know, my mother was sixteen years old when she married my father.

471
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:11,736
And you? Can you even bear children?

472
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:16,111
Are you any use at all? Are you trying to embarrass me?

473
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,046
It has nothing to do with you.

474
00:55:17,184 --> 00:55:19,175
It has everything to do with me!

475
00:55:20,754 --> 00:55:24,451
You will not share my bed if you've slept with him!!

476
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:31,560
You don't understand. I'm not going to share your bed at all.

477
00:55:34,268 --> 00:55:36,065
I'm not going to Budapest with you.

478
00:55:38,138 --> 00:55:40,003
I don't want to be part of what you're planning.

479
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,570
And I will not marry you.

480
00:55:47,214 --> 00:55:49,978
I assume you haven't been so stupid as to tell him anything.

481
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:51,875
'Cause if you disrupt my plans

482
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:54,010
I will have no further use for you, do you understand?

483
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:04,524
Now, you will travel to Budapest tomorrow.

484
00:56:05,732 --> 00:56:10,294
I recommend that you are here early packed and ready to go.

485
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:12,596
Do nothing more to embarrass me.

486
00:56:14,274 --> 00:56:15,468
Goodbye.

487
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:20,670
What do you mean "goodbye"?

488
00:56:22,249 --> 00:56:23,716
Come back here.

489
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:29,486
Come back here!

490
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,637
Don't disobey me again. Whore!

491
00:56:54,248 --> 00:57:00,118
Out of my way. Please, don't-- Uugh.

492
00:57:26,313 --> 00:57:29,111
No, leave that. Leave all the lanterns.

493
00:58:35,749 --> 00:58:39,014
Duchess Von Tuschen!

494
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:43,554
Duchess Von Tuschen!

495
00:58:58,372 --> 00:58:59,805
Over here!

496
01:00:02,602 --> 01:00:04,570
I thought you saw her get on the train with him!

497
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:07,730
No, sir, we were waiting in Vienna for them.

498
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:10,968
But they left from Barden?. We assumed she was him.

499
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:13,536
Should I wire the Crown Prince in Budapest?

500
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,207
It's been done! Who are you?

501
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:21,514
I'm the family's doctor. Are you the Chief Inspector?

502
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:23,153
Yes, I am.

503
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:25,558
You understand this is a police matter now?

504
01:00:25,692 --> 01:00:27,216
Of course I understand.

505
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:28,496
Good, good.

506
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:30,761
You have determined the cause of death?

507
01:00:31,064 --> 01:00:32,497
She bled to death.

508
01:00:32,632 --> 01:00:37,262
There's a wound on her throat just above the left collarbone-

509
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:40,896
Uh, some knife or sword.

510
01:00:41,508 --> 01:00:42,770
May I take a look?

511
01:01:05,866 --> 01:01:08,232
Inspector, l-I will not stand for it.

512
01:01:08,368 --> 01:01:13,362
The Crown Prince will not stand for it. This is not some circus sideshow.

513
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:18,010
My apologies, of course.

514
01:01:23,383 --> 01:01:25,044
Thank you, doctor.

515
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:32,256
Probably robbed. Gypsies maybe?

516
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:34,687
Saw all those diamonds, couldn't say no.

517
01:01:34,828 --> 01:01:39,731
Chief Inspector, there's one thing you should know.

518
01:01:39,866 --> 01:01:41,265
Yes, what is that?

519
01:01:41,568 --> 01:01:46,471
In the folds of her dress I found this small gemstone.

520
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:06,424
Seen last Thursday at 7:30 p.m. riding without

521
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,619
an escort toward the Imperial Hunting Lodge.

522
01:02:08,762 --> 01:02:11,424
Groomsman said she arrived about 8:30.

523
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:14,425
What was she doing riding alone?

524
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:20,268
He did this. You know he did.

525
01:02:20,473 --> 01:02:21,269
I know who did what?

526
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:24,935
The Crown Prince! He killed her. He's done it before and you know it!

527
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:25,737
No, I don't know that. In fact, I'm sure he didn't. He's in Budapest.

528
01:02:27,948 --> 01:02:29,472
He killed her before he left.

529
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:31,277
I'm afraid the facts don't support your theory.

530
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,615
She was leaving him.

531
01:02:35,755 --> 01:02:37,052
For who? You? Yes.

532
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:39,215
Don't be absurd, Herr Eisenheim.

533
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,452
He killed her because he couldn't let her go.

534
01:02:42,362 --> 01:02:43,761
She knew his secret.

535
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,022
What secret?

536
01:02:45,498 --> 01:02:46,396
Ask your Inspector. He knows.

537
01:02:46,533 --> 01:02:47,795
Stop this right now!

538
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:51,727
Are you completely corrupt?

539
01:02:52,005 --> 01:02:56,101
No, not completely, no, which is

540
01:02:56,243 --> 01:03:00,179
why I'll advise you not to accuse anyone especially his Imperial Highness,

541
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,408
or you'll end up in jail yourself.

542
01:03:26,373 --> 01:03:27,863
Where's the guard who let her out of the gate?

543
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:29,270
Gone with the Crown Prince.

544
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:30,706
Did any of the servants see her leave?

545
01:03:30,877 --> 01:03:31,901
All asleep.

546
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:33,668
What about him?

547
01:03:34,247 --> 01:03:37,444
He uh, he put her horse in the first stall when she arrived.

548
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:44,217
This one?

549
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:57,796
We don't have jurisdiction on imperial property.

550
01:03:58,405 --> 01:04:00,270
Thank you. I know.

551
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:03,236
So, what are you doing?

552
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,370
Investigating.

553
01:04:09,749 --> 01:04:16,211
Listening to that magician, are you? For all we know, he did it.

554
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:19,318
No, I think not.

555
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:21,588
The Crown Prince-- He's back.

556
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:36,765
Chief Inspector, we should go. Now.

557
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,270
And what have you found out?

558
01:04:42,515 --> 01:04:44,415
She was last seen riding here alone.

559
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:48,248
Yes, and based on your information I then threw her out, Chief?.

560
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:49,787
Did she commit suicide?

561
01:04:49,923 --> 01:04:51,652
No, it was surely murder.

562
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:53,520
Do you have a suspect?

563
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:55,025
We will soon, your Highness.

564
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:07,462
Later that week, we arrested a man and charged him with murder.

565
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:11,367
But I knew that that wouldn't satisfy Eisenheim.

566
01:05:16,783 --> 01:05:19,047
I had my men continue to watch him.

567
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:38,534
He finally emerged from his grief and bought a rundown theatre.

568
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:41,138
It's perfect.

569
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:53,112
He fired his manager and began preparing for a new kind of show.

570
01:07:57,243 --> 01:07:58,267
Who is he?

571
01:08:01,114 --> 01:08:02,809
My name is Frankel.

572
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:06,013
Where did you come from?

573
01:08:06,953 --> 01:08:10,719
I come from Brunn. My father is a lens grinder there.

574
01:08:11,057 --> 01:08:13,025
How did you come to be here tonight?

575
01:08:18,264 --> 01:08:19,697
I don't know.

576
01:08:19,832 --> 01:08:21,231
Are you alive?

577
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:27,062
What can you tell us about the other side?

578
01:08:27,307 --> 01:08:28,331
What's it like?

579
01:08:28,474 --> 01:08:29,202
Yes, tell us.

580
01:08:29,342 --> 01:08:32,334
You must know things, secret things.

581
01:08:56,769 --> 01:08:58,703
They don't seem to think it's a trick.

582
01:09:08,381 --> 01:09:11,612
Eisenheim's audience had always been enthusiastic.

583
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:16,848
But now he was attracting a more impassioned following.

584
01:09:46,085 --> 01:09:47,882
Madame, please.

585
01:09:56,696 --> 01:10:00,655
With these spirts, these manifestations,

586
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:05,931
Eisenheim has given us hard proof of the soul's immortality.

587
01:10:06,873 --> 01:10:12,539
A spirit has been reaffirmed in the face of modern scientific materialism.

588
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:19,184
The work of spiritualism will arouse humanity to a new moral earnestness.

589
01:10:19,485 --> 01:10:21,385
It is a revolutionary movement

590
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:25,719
and we will turn the empire into a spiritual republic.

591
01:10:28,428 --> 01:10:30,362
Do you think Eisenheim's behind all this?

592
01:10:37,003 --> 01:10:39,972
Why must I be bothered with a magician?

593
01:10:41,774 --> 01:10:45,039
He has proven to be more than a magician, your Highness.

594
01:10:45,712 --> 01:10:48,044
He is a charlatan. He's a faker.

595
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:56,617
If he pretends to have supernatural I powers put him on trial for fraud.

596
01:10:59,025 --> 01:11:01,149
First we have to show it as fraud then do it

597
01:11:01,294 --> 01:11:03,353
find out how the trick is done and then arrest him.

598
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:15,735
This is just a rough demonstration, Inspector.

599
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:17,968
But you can see how it could work.

600
01:11:25,385 --> 01:11:28,252
Yes, I see. Not bad. Not bad.

601
01:11:32,759 --> 01:11:34,954
We need a spy in Eisenheim's troop.

602
01:11:35,094 --> 01:11:36,823
Those Orientals, yhey won't give us anything.

603
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:38,658
I already tried.

604
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:40,589
Then try something else.

605
01:12:59,812 --> 01:13:01,211
What has happened here?

606
01:13:01,514 --> 01:13:03,778
One of those ghosts from the theatre, down the street.

607
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:05,008
Where!

608
01:13:06,185 --> 01:13:08,312
Right there, and it's a boy.

609
01:13:10,122 --> 01:13:11,214
Sick.

610
01:13:15,127 --> 01:13:16,526
Where is this thing?

611
01:13:17,763 --> 01:13:18,923
Over there.

612
01:13:19,131 --> 01:13:20,223
Did you see it?

613
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:33,679
It was right over there.

614
01:14:24,263 --> 01:14:25,787
Where are you taking him?

615
01:14:31,704 --> 01:14:33,331
I want to know how it's done.

616
01:14:34,607 --> 01:14:36,336
First the orange tree, now this.

617
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:40,001
Do I have to share all my professional secrets with the police?

618
01:14:40,146 --> 01:14:42,774
Well, in this case, yes. Or I'll be forced to arrest you.

619
01:14:42,949 --> 01:14:43,745
On what charge?

620
01:14:43,883 --> 01:14:45,578
Mmm, well, we'll start with fraud.

621
01:14:47,186 --> 01:14:48,175
Excuse me, Chief Inspector.

622
01:14:48,321 --> 01:14:49,117
What!

623
01:14:49,288 --> 01:14:51,222
I think you should look outside the window.

624
01:15:04,737 --> 01:15:05,761
Who are they?

625
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:08,468
They are here for him.

626
01:15:08,841 --> 01:15:13,710
Ah, my goodness, you have a devoted following.

627
01:15:14,513 --> 01:15:16,242
What is it they expect of you?

628
01:15:16,415 --> 01:15:19,612
I have no idea. What do your spies tell you?

629
01:15:20,519 --> 01:15:23,079
That you plan to separate? the monarchy perhaps?

630
01:15:23,889 --> 01:15:24,981
Why?

631
01:15:25,725 --> 01:15:27,920
Just because the Crown Prince is a murderer?

632
01:15:29,428 --> 01:15:30,452
He's not a murderer.

633
01:15:30,596 --> 01:15:33,463
We have the real murderer in prison. He pleaded guilty.

634
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:35,098
You've got the wrong man.

635
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:36,559
You don't know that.

636
01:15:36,736 --> 01:15:37,896
No, but you do.

637
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,406
Herr Eisenheim, you will also go to prison

638
01:15:47,546 --> 01:15:50,606
if you don't explain to me what it is you are doing.

639
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,720
The sentence will be greater if that mob attacks the building.

640
01:16:02,862 --> 01:16:04,159
Well?

641
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:11,193
What are you doing? Stop! Stop!

642
01:16:15,541 --> 01:16:20,376
Listen to me, please. You must listen to me, please.

643
01:16:22,882 --> 01:16:24,315
Thank you all for coming.

644
01:16:25,651 --> 01:16:27,846
I've been speaking with the Chief Inspector,

645
01:16:28,654 --> 01:16:31,145
and I think there's been a serious misunderstanding.

646
01:16:34,393 --> 01:16:37,191
I want you all to know that everything

647
01:16:37,329 --> 01:16:40,059
that you have seen in my theatre is an illusion.

648
01:16:41,233 --> 01:16:45,260
It's a trick. It's not real.

649
01:16:48,674 --> 01:16:50,835
I can't bring loved ones back from the grave.

650
01:16:52,812 --> 01:16:54,973
I can't receive messages from the other side.

651
01:16:57,216 --> 01:16:59,707
I apologize if I've given you any false hope.

652
01:17:00,986 --> 01:17:03,318
My intention has only been to entertain.

653
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:05,918
Nothing more.

654
01:17:09,528 --> 01:17:13,487
Now I appreciate your support, but you must go home.

655
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:17,025
Please, you must go.

656
01:17:29,682 --> 01:17:36,417
There, now I've explained it. So it can't be fraud. May I go?

657
01:17:58,778 --> 01:18:00,575
Has he tricked you? Is that it?

658
01:18:02,581 --> 01:18:04,071
No, your Highness.

659
01:18:04,283 --> 01:18:05,716
Then why are you failing me?

660
01:18:10,956 --> 01:18:12,719
I thought I could trust you.

661
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:19,330
I thought you were a man I could bring with me when I took the throne.

662
01:18:22,001 --> 01:18:23,161
Am I wrong about you?

663
01:18:23,302 --> 01:18:25,167
No. You're not wrong, your Highness, no.

664
01:18:25,504 --> 01:18:30,339
I need men who can complete the tasks assigned to them!!

665
01:18:37,983 --> 01:18:40,178
Instead I'm surrounded by fools.

666
01:18:41,287 --> 01:18:43,346
In the end I must do everything myself.

667
01:18:44,957 --> 01:18:47,255
I can see this case will be no different.

668
01:19:06,779 --> 01:19:07,905
How do I look?

669
01:19:09,114 --> 01:19:12,447
Ordinary, your Highness, very ordinary.

670
01:19:17,423 --> 01:19:19,152
I think I'm going to enjoy this.

671
01:19:40,145 --> 01:19:41,840
They don't recognize you.

672
01:19:42,514 --> 01:19:48,316
Good. Now keep your distance. I don't want to be seen with a policeman.

673
01:21:08,801 --> 01:21:09,961
Who are you?

674
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:13,131
Are you Duchess Von Teschen?

675
01:21:14,373 --> 01:21:15,533
Yes.

676
01:21:16,742 --> 01:21:18,107
What's happened to you?

677
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:21,408
She was murdered. Were you murdered?

678
01:21:22,414 --> 01:21:28,375
By who? Did they arrest the right man?

679
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,511
Tell us, please. Who murdered you?

680
01:21:32,024 --> 01:21:34,959
Someone... here.

681
01:21:35,961 --> 01:21:39,531
Tell us, point him out. Was it the Crown Prince?

682
01:21:39,732 --> 01:21:41,791
He's killed a woman before!

683
01:21:42,101 --> 01:21:44,296
Word? the Crown Prince isn't even here.

684
01:21:44,436 --> 01:21:47,633
The Crown Prince killed her! Something must be done!

685
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,595
Chief Inspector, are you sure you have the right man?

686
01:22:16,735 --> 01:22:17,724
Quite sure. Excuse me.

687
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:19,428
Did you investigate the Crown Prince?

688
01:22:19,571 --> 01:22:22,768
He cannot continue if this is true. He must be brought to justice.

689
01:22:22,908 --> 01:22:25,634
It's not true, the magic trick is not evidence. What is your name?

690
01:22:26,345 --> 01:22:27,972
I don't see how that matters.

691
01:22:28,113 --> 01:22:30,081
I advise you to watch what you say, sir.

692
01:22:36,522 --> 01:22:38,456
That actress didn't even look like Sophie.

693
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:41,650
But the audience is stupid and he knows it.

694
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:45,421
He manipulates them. He himself said nothing.

695
01:22:45,764 --> 01:22:47,823
His actress said nothing inflammatory.

696
01:22:47,966 --> 01:22:50,434
He left it to the audience to make their accusations.

697
01:22:50,569 --> 01:22:52,901
All taunts paid for by him, of course.

698
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:57,067
I don't suppose you made a note of those people?

699
01:22:57,209 --> 01:22:59,404
I'm afraid we didn't have enough men tonight.

700
01:22:59,545 --> 01:23:02,173
At the next performance I want them all arrested,

701
01:23:02,314 --> 01:23:05,477
every one of them-Eisenheim and the whole troupe.

702
01:23:05,784 --> 01:23:10,847
I want to have an example made of him in front of all his followers.

703
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:23,995
That was very foolish last night. You can't destroy him, you know.

704
01:23:24,203 --> 01:23:26,228
You can't bring down the monarchy.

705
01:23:26,371 --> 01:23:27,360
Oh, I know I can't.

706
01:23:27,506 --> 01:23:32,205
Then don't raise her again! Don't provoke those questions.

707
01:23:37,182 --> 01:23:39,673
Herr Eisenheim, I don't want to arrest you.

708
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:44,489
I'm a cynical man, God knows.

709
01:23:44,623 --> 01:23:47,524
But if your manifestations are somehow real-

710
01:23:47,659 --> 01:23:50,685
and even I'm willing to admit you're a very special person,

711
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:53,662
and if it's a trick then it's equally impressive--

712
01:23:53,799 --> 01:23:59,066
Either way you have a gift, so don't make me put you in jail.

713
01:24:00,672 --> 01:24:02,264
Promise me you won't do it again.

714
01:24:02,975 --> 01:24:04,943
I promise you you'll enjoy this next show.

715
01:24:08,547 --> 01:24:09,571
What do you want?

716
01:24:10,249 --> 01:24:11,273
Nothing.

717
01:24:11,817 --> 01:24:13,944
Then why bring her back?

718
01:24:16,155 --> 01:24:17,747
Just to be with her.

719
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:22,554
To be with her.

720
01:24:32,738 --> 01:24:34,303
-Everything is ready? -Yes, sir.

721
01:24:34,339 --> 01:24:36,170
We're trying to assess how he might escape.

722
01:24:36,408 --> 01:24:39,138
He will not escape! I want guards at every door and window!

723
01:24:39,278 --> 01:24:40,370
Sir.

724
01:24:47,986 --> 01:24:50,648
I want to apologize to you for my behavior of late.

725
01:24:50,889 --> 01:24:53,119
But I want to make it up to you if you'll listen to a proposition.

726
01:24:53,258 --> 01:24:54,316
Well, I don't know.

727
01:24:54,459 --> 01:24:56,359
I'll make it worth your while, Josef.

728
01:24:56,962 --> 01:24:58,190
You know, I'm very busy right now.

729
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:00,230
I haven't just been sitting around waiting for you.

730
01:25:00,365 --> 01:25:01,798
No, no, of course.

731
01:25:06,772 --> 01:25:11,937
I want you to assume control of all my finances and my assets.

732
01:25:12,811 --> 01:25:14,142
Everything.

733
01:25:14,446 --> 01:25:15,504
Everything?

734
01:25:15,614 --> 01:25:18,447
Yes, including this theatre

735
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:20,646
and all the receipts from tonight's performance,

736
01:25:20,786 --> 01:25:22,720
which I offer with my sincere thanks.

737
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:28,451
What do you say?

738
01:25:29,895 --> 01:25:32,386
All right, I'll do it.

739
01:25:32,531 --> 01:25:34,761
Good. Good.

740
01:25:36,101 --> 01:25:38,069
Would you like me to introduce you tonight?

741
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:42,362
No. Tonight just enjoy the show.

742
01:26:04,429 --> 01:26:07,523
Excuse me, Chief Inspector, I'm Josef Fischer, Eisenheim's manager.

743
01:26:07,866 --> 01:26:09,197
Yes, I remember.

744
01:26:10,168 --> 01:26:12,033
What's going on? Why all the police?

745
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:14,035
Precautions, Herr Fischer, precautions.

746
01:26:14,573 --> 01:26:16,404
Are you planning to arrest Eisenheim?

747
01:26:16,675 --> 01:26:18,370
That's entirely up to him.

748
01:27:03,355 --> 01:27:04,982
It's Duchess Von Teschen.

749
01:27:17,135 --> 01:27:18,625
Why were you murdered?

750
01:27:20,706 --> 01:27:22,071
I was leaving him.

751
01:27:22,207 --> 01:27:23,367
Leaving who?

752
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:24,338
The Crown Prince?

753
01:27:24,476 --> 01:27:26,341
Of course it was the Crown Prince.

754
01:27:26,478 --> 01:27:27,502
We won't stand for it!

755
01:27:27,646 --> 01:27:29,375
I tried to get away.

756
01:27:33,885 --> 01:27:37,878
I was wearing my locket when I died but now it's gone.

757
01:27:38,023 --> 01:27:39,047
It's lost.

758
01:27:39,191 --> 01:27:40,783
Tell us, please, who murdered you?

759
01:27:40,926 --> 01:27:41,824
Was it the Crown Prince?

760
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,587
We must do something!

761
01:27:57,109 --> 01:27:58,337
Get up!

762
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:05,482
In the name of his Imperial Majesty and the city of Vienna,

763
01:28:06,017 --> 01:28:09,214
I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovitz,

764
01:28:09,488 --> 01:28:12,048
also known as Eisenheim the Illusionist,

765
01:28:12,924 --> 01:28:15,859
on charges of disturbing public order, charlatanism,

766
01:28:16,061 --> 01:28:19,155
and threats against the empire!

767
01:29:30,435 --> 01:29:31,663
Find him!

768
01:29:42,781 --> 01:29:43,805
Where is he?

769
01:29:44,049 --> 01:29:45,141
He was right there.

770
01:29:45,283 --> 01:29:47,510
-How is his trick done? -No trick.

771
01:29:47,652 --> 01:29:48,619
How is it done!

772
01:29:48,753 --> 01:29:50,516
I don't know. Nobody knows.

773
01:29:57,929 --> 01:29:59,328
Dammit!

774
01:33:46,991 --> 01:33:50,119
I had my driver take the sword to police headquarters.

775
01:33:52,864 --> 01:33:54,161
My men will examine it and see

776
01:33:54,299 --> 01:33:57,291
if it matches the gemstone found on Duchess Von Teschen's body.

777
01:33:57,435 --> 01:33:59,062
I have no doubt that it will.

778
01:34:03,241 --> 01:34:09,544
And after that, I came in here and you asked me why I was late.

779
01:34:11,416 --> 01:34:13,111
You've stolen Imperial property.

780
01:34:13,218 --> 01:34:14,981
That seems trivial compared with murder.

781
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,452
Even if that were true, you have no jurisdiction here.

782
01:34:17,589 --> 01:34:18,715
That's right.

783
01:34:19,057 --> 01:34:21,787
You may do as you wish here without consequence.

784
01:34:23,361 --> 01:34:28,458
Nobody can punish you, except one man.

785
01:34:28,633 --> 01:34:29,531
Who's that?

786
01:34:29,667 --> 01:34:30,929
The Emperor.

787
01:34:32,303 --> 01:34:35,500
I don't suppose he'll leave his crown to a murderer, do you?

788
01:34:38,376 --> 01:34:39,866
He'll never believe you.

789
01:34:40,345 --> 01:34:41,334
Maybe not.

790
01:34:46,084 --> 01:34:50,544
But I wrote a letter to his general staff telling them everything.

791
01:34:51,723 --> 01:34:54,123
Including your plan to overthrow the Emperor.

792
01:34:55,026 --> 01:34:56,516
I know they'll listen to that.

793
01:34:58,296 --> 01:35:00,787
You'll not take the throne, not with my help.

794
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,030
You no longer want to be Chief of Police?

795
01:35:04,836 --> 01:35:05,734
Mayor of Vienna?

796
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:09,101
You don't want to be a baron, an aristocrat?

797
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:12,536
I'm afraid that's out of the question at this point.

798
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:21,648
You fool, he's tricking you. He's manipulating you.

799
01:35:22,253 --> 01:35:24,050
He had the sword at the command performance.

800
01:35:24,189 --> 01:35:26,783
He could have pried the stones loose  then and planted them here.

801
01:35:26,925 --> 01:35:28,648
-He's planted everything. -You were drunk..

802
01:35:28,793 --> 01:35:33,594
It's all a trick. It's an illusion.

803
01:35:35,066 --> 01:35:37,193
Perhaps there's truth in this illusion.

804
01:35:51,382 --> 01:35:54,180
You need to wire your driver and have the sword returned.

805
01:35:54,619 --> 01:35:55,551
Or what?

806
01:35:55,687 --> 01:35:57,951
I'll shoot you. Perhaps I'll shoot you anyway.

807
01:35:58,389 --> 01:36:01,324
And then you'll have killed a police inspector and a Duchess.

808
01:36:01,459 --> 01:36:02,983
Or perhaps you'll kill yourself.

809
01:36:03,161 --> 01:36:06,858
You, uh, committed suicide, distraught at having failed your leader.

810
01:36:23,615 --> 01:36:27,073
Ah, some officers of the general staff I'd guess.

811
01:36:29,087 --> 01:36:30,520
They must've received my letter.

812
01:36:39,631 --> 01:36:40,962
What do you want?

813
01:36:41,099 --> 01:36:42,657
I don't want anything.

814
01:36:43,534 --> 01:36:48,437
Fine. Fine. You shall have nothing.

815
01:36:56,648 --> 01:36:57,615
Gentlemen.

816
01:36:57,849 --> 01:36:59,942
The situation is so obvious.

817
01:37:00,318 --> 01:37:02,115
Everyone's completely incompetent.

818
01:37:03,354 --> 01:37:06,653
My father runs the Empire into the ground and no one notices.

819
01:37:06,791 --> 01:37:07,553
No one does anything about it.

820
01:37:07,692 --> 01:37:10,559
I propose to cleanup the mess and you thank me by betraying me.

821
01:37:10,695 --> 01:37:13,323
Well, you're all becoming irrelevant. You'll all be replaced.

822
01:37:14,332 --> 01:37:16,266
The country will be run by mongrels.

823
01:37:17,235 --> 01:37:21,435
A thousand different voices screaming to be heard and nothing will be done!

824
01:37:21,572 --> 01:37:22,504
Nothing!

825
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,164
I've done everything I can!

826
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:32,841
Too much! Far too much.

827
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:38,179
Your Highness, are you in there? Your Highness, open door.

828
01:37:39,057 --> 01:37:41,457
Please, open the door.

829
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:46,193
By your father's authority I insist you open the door.

830
01:37:46,898 --> 01:37:49,025
You must open the door!

831
01:37:49,267 --> 01:37:50,564
You're all fools...

832
01:37:51,703 --> 01:37:53,295
Please, your Highness.

833
01:37:53,404 --> 01:37:57,966
And I can't stand it. I won't stand it.

834
01:37:59,744 --> 01:38:02,110
Break down the door. Break it down!

835
01:38:06,484 --> 01:38:07,712
What happened?

836
01:38:08,386 --> 01:38:10,115
The Crown Prince just shot himself.

837
01:38:56,801 --> 01:38:58,769
Are you Chief Inspector Uhl?

838
01:38:59,837 --> 01:39:01,236
I used to be.

839
01:39:26,164 --> 01:39:32,364
You! Who gave you this! Who gave you this!

840
01:39:32,503 --> 01:39:33,970
Herr, Eisenheim!

841
01:39:35,706 --> 01:39:37,196
When!

842
01:41:04,495 --> 01:41:05,894
All aboard!

843
01:41:06,697 --> 01:41:08,028
Tickets and papers.

844
01:41:12,136 --> 01:41:13,865
All aboard!

845
01:41:43,301 --> 01:41:44,268
When it's done...

846
01:41:45,203 --> 01:41:47,433
...you'll travel ahead with her and I shall follow.

847
01:41:47,605 --> 01:41:49,971
And she understands everything this entails?

848
01:41:50,107 --> 01:41:51,131
Completely.

849
01:41:51,475 --> 01:41:53,568
Do you think Eisenheim's behind all this?

850
01:41:56,914 --> 01:42:00,145
So, what does it mean to die?

851
01:42:03,354 --> 01:42:04,514
What do you want?

852
01:42:05,723 --> 01:42:07,122
To be with her.

853
01:42:07,525 --> 01:42:08,924
To be with her.

854
01:42:13,431 --> 01:42:17,492
Chief Inspector, there's one thing you should know.

855
01:42:21,239 --> 01:42:24,208
Your sword is very beautiful. Might I see it?

856
01:42:24,342 --> 01:42:25,502
You're drunk.

857
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:27,043
You were drunk.

858
01:42:40,925 --> 01:42:43,189
He's a charlatan and he's a faker.

859
01:42:43,327 --> 01:42:44,760
He's plotted everything.

860
01:42:56,941 --> 01:42:59,535
Everything you have seen is an illusion.

861
01:43:00,077 --> 01:43:01,237
It's a trick.
