[cars passing]

00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:52,748
[woman] We got this letter
in the mail today from
a very angry customer.

6
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:57,448
[somber music]

7
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,017
"After leaving Cambodia
for everything America
has to offer,

8
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:05,717
then why would you want
to change our government
to that system of government?

9
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:12,202
Would you have had that success
with your restaurant
in Cambodia?

10
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:18,991
You seem to blame
President Trump for COVID.

11
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:21,820
If we would have shut down
completely any longer,

12
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,084
your business and most others
would have failed

13
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:27,261
and our country
would be in a depression.

14
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:30,786
Of course, you could return
to Cambodia for opportunity.

15
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:39,403
You are right that
many of your customers
are Trump supporters,

16
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:43,103
but Bad Axe isn't changing from
traditional American values.

17
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:49,631
My family
and many will be changing
our restaurant routine,

18
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,981
and Rachel's is no longer
a choice."

19
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,811
And about ten
exclamation marks.

20
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:59,815
I feel like exactly what we were
afraid of happening by...

21
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:04,689
I guess,
sharing our family's story
and speaking up

22
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,169
is happening.

23
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,520
Everything we were afraid of
is happening.

24
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:16,614
[somber music]

25
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:24,361
[Trump]
My fellow Americans,
it started in China

26
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:26,537
and is now spreading
throughout the world.

27
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:29,279
This is a global pandemic.

28
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,892
[woman]
Every day, we keep reporting
increasing numbers

29
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:37,331
of cases and deaths
here in Michigan.

30
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:40,160
[man 1]
Michigan is currently
fifth in the nation,

31
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,250
and in deaths
we are currently seventh.

32
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,121
[thunder rumbling]

33
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,992
[woman]
Asian Americans are reporting

34
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:50,300
an increase
in racist encounters.

35
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,173
[woman 2]
And the state's case count
now jumps by the hundreds.

36
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:55,827
There are now more than
a thousand confirmed cases

37
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,873
of coronavirus
here in Michigan.

38
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,527
[man 2]
...restaurants, coffee shops--

39
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:02,269
all ordered by Governor Whitmer
to stop normal business

40
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:05,402
to prevent the spread
of coronavirus.

41
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,536
[woman 3] The surge in hate
crimes against Asian Americans
only getting worse.

42
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,626
[man 3]
The number of coronavirus cases
at home and abroad...

43
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:19,416
[wind whistling]

44
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:33,561
[car door closes]

45
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:46,400
[Governor Whitmer] If you're not
an essential business,
you need to close

46
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,403
and you need
to protect your employees,
and we're confident that

47
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,014
the vast majority of people
are gonna do the right thing.

48
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:56,236
The carry-out/dine-out option
is still something that
is available to people.

49
00:03:56,366 --> 00:04:00,022
This is an essential service,
which is the feeding of
the people of our state.

50
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:03,286
So the restaurant where you can
get your takeout,

51
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:07,159
those will all still continue
to serve the public.

52
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,901
[liquid dripping]

53
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:16,212
[woman] We spray our car doors
before we even open 'em.

54
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:17,692
We spray 'em
when we get back in.

55
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:18,997
-[woman 2] Wear
freaking gloves, please.
-We are!

56
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,173
We will wear masks,
glasses, gloves.

57
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,523
We know.

58
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:24,220
We're not stupid, Jaclyn.

59
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,266
You have high blood pressure!

60
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:29,138
Three-fourths of the people
that have died,

61
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,620
three-fourths all have
had high blood pressure.

62
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,926
That is their preexisting
condition.

63
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:38,234
Can-- can we just stop
for one moment?

64
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:42,194
I'm going home.
You just go do whatever
you've gotta do.

65
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:56,687
David, why are you
filming me right now?

66
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,950
[David]
I've got a lot of free time.

67
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,996
You can work at the restaurant.

68
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:07,437
Dude, I definitely, like--
you can't really post these

69
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:11,920
because you really
don't want people to know
that you were just on a cruise.

70
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,357
I bet Mommy and Baba
never thought they'd have
all four kids

71
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,403
living under
the same roof again.

72
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:20,320
And you guys just moved into
a new apartment last week.

73
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,234
[David] Mm-hmm.

74
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:25,803
And I don't really want to be
in New York right now, so...

75
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:29,677
That's true.
Bad Axe is probably a lot safer
than New York right now.

76
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,943
It's probably a good thing
you guys got out when you did.

77
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:39,774
But it's crazy to think
that literally one week ago

78
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:42,516
we were on a cruise ship.

79
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:45,693
And now, like,
things are, like...

80
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,870
starting to get really bad.

81
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,052

[gentle music]

83
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,587
[man] Why are you filming
everything, David?

84
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:13,851
[David]
I just think it's a...

85
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,592
it's an important time
in history right now

86
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:19,422
and I just wanna
document everything.

87
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:21,381
[man]
And why are you filming me?

88
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:24,732
[David] I don't know.

89
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:26,473
[hissing]

90
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:39,964
[Rachel] Am I gonna be
in your way over here?

91
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:42,619
[David] No, but it's--
it's the sound, Mom.
Sound is the concern.

92
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,536
-I won't make any sound.
-Even the footsteps.

93
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,625
-Oh, okay.
-[David chuckles]

94
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:54,805
[David]
Tell me about these photos.

95
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,765
Just make sure you show them
to camera, to me too.

96
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,680
Show it to the camera
like this?

97
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,857
Yeah, just talk about them
and show them to me.

98
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:06,164
[somber guitar music]

99
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:10,212
[Chun] This is what a piece
of land is

100
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:14,521
right before
any footing going around.

101
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,610
Here's a picture of Rachel
with our children,

102
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,177
Jaclyn and Michelle.

103
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,441
Our baby at the time,
David.

104
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:28,360
Here's the three kids standing
in front of the front entrance.

105
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:33,017
It didn't take a whole lot
to keep the "childrens" happy.

106
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:37,544
Just tell 'em this is gonna be
our future donut shop.

107
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:41,025
It "felts" like building
the American dream,

108
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:45,900
having come into this country
as a refugee from Cambodia.

109
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,473
Raquel was born
right after the opening.

110
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:56,998
As business keep growing,
children keep growing,

111
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:59,609
the minute they're old enough
to work, there they are.

112
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,264
Part of our family business.

113
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:06,050
I'm proud of these kids.

114
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,923
[voice breaks]
Really proud of them.

115
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:14,276
[phone ringing]

116
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:17,192
[Jaclyn]
They wanted ketchup
with your kids' tenders, okay.

117
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,411
They want ranch,
and then we just need

118
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,501
a kids' quesadilla,
all right?

119
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,982
Raquel, is there any salsa
and sour cream in there?

120
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,377
[Raquel]
Quesadilla with french fries.

121
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:31,859
[man]
Raquel, is it busy right now?

122
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:33,643
We're actually not super busy
right now.

123
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:36,646
But we're not used to doing
this many takeout orders,

124
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:39,127
so it's a bit
of a learning curve.

125
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:40,955
[sizzling]

126
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,396
-[Raquel] Hot food coming out!
-Okay.

127
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,401
[broom clatters]

128
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:56,318
[David]
So where are we at right now?

129
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:59,190
Well, this is pretty much
my second home here.

130
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:03,804
Uh, I've been working
ever since I was a little girl
and we were making donuts.

131
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:07,416
I actually have a whole 'nother
life and career in Ann Arbor.

132
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,115
I have a corporate job
that I work at, you know,
on the weekdays,

133
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:15,076
but I always come home
on the weekends to help
the family out.

134
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,688
With COVID and everything
going on now,

135
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:21,473
my husband Mike and I
are able to work from home,

136
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:24,520
so we decided to move back
temporarily

137
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:27,001
to help my parents
kind of run the business

138
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,482
and hopefully
they can stay home more
where they're safe.

139
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,485
Mike?

140
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,532
Can you come get
new mop water?

141
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:40,449
He's pretty good
about helping out
when you ask him to.

142
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,799
-[Mike] I came right back--
-You did come back
and do dishes.

143
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,323
-[Mike] So, yeah--
-I'm very proud of you,
thank you.

144
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:50,720
-You really need new mop water?
-I really need new mop water.
[chuckles]

145
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,461
No, Mike's good.
He helps out.

146
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,420
I mean, he obviously didn't,
like, grow up in a restaurant

147
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,205
like we did, so...

148
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,599
Ah, cricket!

149
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,513
Oh, come here, little guy.

150
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,559
We've all put a lot of blood,
sweat, and tears

151
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,735
into this kitchen
over the past 20 years,

152
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:09,652
but that's kind of how we got
to where we are today.

153
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:17,181
[light somber music]

154
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:20,794
[TV playing faintly]

155
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,674
[man on TV]
...investigated 25,000
restaurants and bars.

156
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:36,853
Business leaders say
a comprehensive restaurant
rescue plan will be needed.

157
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:39,508
-I mean, I don't know
what else to say...
-[Chun] Mm.

158
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,076
...other than
you're kind of gonna
have to have that talk

159
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,252
of unemployment.

160
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,907
It-- it's not--
you have no choice.

161
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,865
They're just gonna have to.

162
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,998
Who would've ever thought
a freaking virus

163
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:55,698
would put this whole world
and country in a halt?

164
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,961
Nobody.

165
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,181
[woman on TV]
...if you completely
sideline it for,

166
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:03,445
let's say three months,
is $1 trillion enough?

167
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:05,055
That is the conversation...

168
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:08,058
[sizzling]

169
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:18,678
I'm just going back
and looking at parties

170
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:22,638
that we were supposed to have,
you know, this month.

171
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,119
I mean, I have a couple people
that are great

172
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,774
with keeping their deposits
and rescheduling,

173
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,994
and then I have a couple
people that are, you know,

174
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,170
"they're not on the same page
as us" type of thing.

175
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,259
They're like, "Well,
this shouldn't be happening,"

176
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,784
and, you know, by law,
we can't open,

177
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,699
so there's nothing we can do.

178
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,442
[coins rattling]

179
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,930
[David]
How much did we make today?

180
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:57,064
[Jaclyn] Let's just say it was
a really bad day.

181
00:11:57,194 --> 00:12:01,721
Probably
the worst day we've had...
in, like, five years.

182
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,548
Probably more.

183
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,812
[Rachel]
Our whole lives just changed,

184
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,770
shut down,

185
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,947
no longer have customers
come into the building.

186
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,688
[Jaclyn]
It's not because we're, like,

187
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:16,823
making bad food
or not trying or anything,
it's...

188
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:20,217
obviously out
of everybody's control.

189
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:25,483
It reminds me of when
we literally--

190
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,616
like, we're just
struggling to survive,

191
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,314
trying to make money
off of donuts.

192
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:34,231
[somber music]

193
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:37,191
Our lives were completely
different growing up.

194
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:39,889
Back when the restaurant
was still a donut shop,

195
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,891
there were multiple times
that I remember

196
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,893
we almost had our
electricity shut off,

197
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,940
both at the donut shop
and at our house.

198
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,681
There were seven of us
living in a two-bedroom,

199
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,162
like, 1,000-square-foot home...

200
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,513
and we all shared one bathroom.

201
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:58,865
David, actually, you slept
on the floor the first
ten years of your life

202
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,867
because there was
only two bedrooms.

203
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:05,654
[David]
Yeah, that was pretty rough.

204
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,049
[Jaclyn] I guess when
you grow up knowing what
it's like to have nothing,

205
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,443
you're always afraid
of going back to that point.

206
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:15,577
[David] I know.
I think we'll be okay, though.

207
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:22,323
[wind whistling]

208
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,938
[Jaclyn]
So, sushi night, or sushi day.

209
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:31,158
First time that we're gonna
be serving sushi

210
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,116
starting at noon.

211
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:39,166
Hopefully, today helps make up
for a lot of lost business
over the week.

212
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:43,300
Also, we really
have to figure out
an organized system, though.

213
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:45,694
I'm actually really
stressed out about that.

214
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,437
Becca, go sanitize yourself.
Go dip your hands in bleach,
wash yourself-- everything.

215
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,439
I'm a little nervous,
but I think it's just

216
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:54,529
the nervousness
of sushi night in general.

217
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,575
I think Jaclyn's precautions
are very necessary.

218
00:13:57,706 --> 00:14:00,056
[Jaclyn]
Emily, I need you to take it
really, really seriously.

219
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:01,884
A lot of people who are
coming in here are either

220
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,886
trying sushi
for their first time

221
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:06,280
or their first time
trying sushi was
at our restaurant.

222
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,977
[Rachel]
It's a new system for us.

223
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:09,718
We've never ever, ever
done it this way

224
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,459
and so we're just trying
to get in the groove.

225
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,809
Hello, Chilinger-- Chilinger.

226
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,247
-[man] Yes.
-All righty, it's gonna be
$14.84, please.

227
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:21,208
[Jaclyn] All of our sushi--
it's like sushi but with
our own twist on it.

228
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:22,992
And once people try it,
they're like,

229
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:25,255
"Huh, it's not
what I thought it was."

230
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:28,041
And then it's like a thing.
It's like its own event now

231
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,826
that a lot of people
in our community
look forward to.

232
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,394
-[phone ringing]
-[Rachel] Okay, where's that
freaking phone?

233
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:35,570
Hello, Rachel's of Bad Axe,
how may I help you?

234
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,877
-$44.52, please.
-[phone ringing]

235
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:39,269
It's not in sync yet.

236
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,054
-Maybe rice--
-Why don't you take orders?

237
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:42,794
-I was taking orders, Jaclyn!
-Shut up.

238
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,796
[Jaclyn]
Come on. It's not time--

239
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,234
-You're wasting
more time bitching.
-[Jaclyn] No, you are, Mom!

240
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,801
-I top--
I top them with avocado.
-Look at it. It says "avocado."

241
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,892
-[phone ringing]
-[Rachel mockingly weeping]

242
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:55,546
-Don't drop it.
-Whose is this? What is this?

243
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:59,637
-[phone ringing]
-[Rachel sighs]

244
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:03,990
-[woman] The sushi kitchen
has a ball in here.
-[workers cheering]

245
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:08,646
You guys rock, man.
Good job.

246
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:12,520
Could not have done it
without not a single one of you.

247
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,872
This was something that people
appreciated and so forth.

248
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,483
-Sorry for being mean to you.
-I'm sorry for being mean
to you too.

249
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,138
-[woman]
Pip, where does this go?
-Oh, my gosh.

250
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,401
[wind whistling]

251
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:41,331
[gentle guitar music]

252
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:53,430
[Mike] With the restaurant
being slow, we're trying
this new delivery thing.

253
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:56,259
When I'm done working, I--
I'll make runs for
the restaurant.

254
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,133
I know this town so well,
you know, growing up here.

255
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:03,266
Bad Axe is a place where, like,
if you grew up here,

256
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,573
you really couldn't
wait to get out.

257
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:09,490
All we did as kids was,
like, play basketball

258
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,709
or football or hockey.

259
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,190
But there's really
not much else to do.

260
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:17,411
It's got a theater
that shows two movies.

261
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:22,155
It's got two stoplights
and it's got a Walmart,

262
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:26,420
so it's not-- it doesn't have
a whole lot of things to offer.

263
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,467
We've talked
about moving back here
just 'cause it's a--

264
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:33,166
it's a nice place to raise
a family.

265
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:35,951
You know, it's safe,
it's, uh...

266
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,388
Everybody knows everybody,
so it's a--

267
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,521
it's a sense of community
in that way.

268
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,177
All right, have a good day.
Thanks.

269
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,266
[car ajar beeping]

270
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:49,008
$10 tip,
I will take it.

271
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,753
Yeah, the CDC recommends
everybody wear masks

272
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:58,713
when they're out-- out
in public around people

273
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:04,023
and apparently it's getting
a lot of backlash
in this community.

274
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:06,329
People don't like to be
told what to do.

275
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:11,030
So, uh, they will fight that
as much as they can.

276
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:17,253
[Chun]
Making a homemade face mask.

277
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:25,131
It's not a bad-looking mask.

278
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:27,307
[Jaclyn]
So, the best thing
for Mom and Baba to do,

279
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:31,398
instead of him sitting here,
hanging around all of us,
is to go home.

280
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:33,269
You know how Dad is.

281
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,924
If I just said it,
he'd be like... [scoffs]
"What do you know?"

282
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,058
I have to, like, get mad
about it and, like, fight.

283
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:41,103
Do you understand
what the mask does?

284
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:44,367
[Chun] These are so your
spit doesn't get all over
the fucking place, okay?

285
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,500
If an N95's
not even effective

286
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,068
unless you wear it perfect,
then these masks are not
gonna be effective...

287
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,287
-Okay, here.
[exhales forcefully]
-...unless you wear it perfect.

288
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:54,551
-You're so cool.
-And that's the fucking
thing, okay?

289
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:56,249
[Chun]
God damn it.

290
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:58,990
Do you need to be here
right now?

291
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,123
I know, I know.
I'm going home.

292
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:04,257
-And bring Baba with you.
-I know, I'm going home.

293
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:06,694
[Raquel] It's more effective
than any mask.

294
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:12,091
-[Jaclyn] You're panicked!
-[Chun] I'm panicked!
I'm scared!

295
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:13,788
-[Jaclyn] So you-- I know!
-Okay, and you know what?

296
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:17,748
I'm scared because I don't want
three of my kids

297
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:20,882
to take care of me
when I'm sick!

298
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:25,147
Then stay quarantined
and stop going places!

299
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:28,368
You were literally
at the restaurant from
10:00 until 7:00 tonight.

300
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:31,545
-[Chun] I'm sewing masks.
-Baba, what don't you
understand?

301
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:35,331
That if you get sick,
it doesn't matter anyways.

302
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:38,943
-If-- if who gets sick?
-You!

303
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:44,297
If I-- if anybody gonna
get sick, okay--

304
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:49,693
[voice breaks]
It's gonna be you.
That's fine... but then--

305
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:51,739
then we stop being positive

306
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:55,612
and we stop caring about
making anything work.

307
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:58,006
Why don't you
understand that?

308
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,443
If something happens to you,
it does--

309
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,576
nothing matters anymore!

310
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:06,841
I don't care if we're poor.
I don't care if we even lose
the restaurant,

311
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:09,974
and I love the restaurant.
I don't care about
any of that stuff!

312
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:12,934
You know that!

313
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,503
Come here.

314
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,374
It's okay. I know.

315
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,904
Obviously, Baba and I are both
really scared and worried.

316
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,646
We just have a different way
of dealing with--

317
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,909
-like, dealing with our fear.
-[cat meowing]

318
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,695
It's okay. It's okay.

319
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:40,962
He just always goes into this
survival mode.

320
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,356
Like, his every thought becomes,

321
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,358
"What am I gonna do
to survive?"

322
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:47,098
And that's all
he can think about.

323
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,666
Like, the safest thing he can do
is stay at home.

324
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:53,453
That's what's gonna
minimize the risk the most.

325
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,195
-[cat meowing]
-[grunts] Ow-w-w.

326
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,588
Goo, go away. [chuckles]

327
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,678
I know, I know. It's okay.

328
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:09,251
[Chun]
When they say a fruit don't
fall far off from its tree,

329
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:13,603
it's almost true
when I look at Jaclyn--

330
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,997
how passionate she is
toward life

331
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:19,435
and how dedicated she is
to her family.

332
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:22,177
She's taking care of this cat
that was born handicapped,

333
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:24,745
paralyzed
from the waist down.

334
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:32,187
I think Jaclyn remind me
a lot of her grandmother,

335
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,884
which is my mom.

336
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,976
When Rachel and I would
struggle with the donut shop,

337
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:42,806
thank God we had my mom
at home help raising the kids.

338
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:45,026
[indistinct chatter]

339
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:47,376
[Chun]
Shortly after she passed away,

340
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:50,510
Jaclyn was just
a young teenager.

341
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,513
She just stepped right in.

342
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,385
[Jaclyn] My Ma, which is
what we call my grandma,

343
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,605
is the one
who taught me what it means

344
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:01,129
to sacrifice for your family.

345
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,741
I just always grew up thinking
if she could survive a genocide

346
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:07,657
and come to this country,
the least I could do

347
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:10,834
is help my family
run a business.

348
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:14,098
[Chun]
We couldn't survive
just selling coffee and donuts,

349
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:18,277
so we had to turn
the whole business
into a family restaurant.

350
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:21,584
We don't know
what we are doing.

351
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:25,632
After Jaclyn
graduated from college,
she have a full-time job

352
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:29,070
and she took that income
to help support and invest

353
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,422
in the family business
to make us successful
as we are today.

354
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,602
Taking care of her job,
taking care of her
family's business,

355
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,735
taking care of her family.

356
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:46,653
Now, that is Jaclyn.

357
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:53,486
-[both chuckling]
-[Jaclyn muffled] Sorry.

358
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,488
[Jaclyn] Seriously.

359
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:00,797
-[Mike mumbles]
-Fine, I'll dance with you,
but usually you dance like...

360
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:02,886
[chuckles] other ways.

361
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:05,846
[TV playing in background]

362
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,456
[Jaclyn sighs]

363
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:14,202
This concrete was poured
in April of 2000.

364
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,031
Raquel would have not even
been two years old yet.

365
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:20,339
Now she can run
the whole restaurant.

366
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:23,429
[guitar music]

367
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:34,178
[professor] A few announcements.
Final papers are gonna be
due next Tuesday.

368
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:36,790
-Thanks for coming.
Hi, Raquel.
-Hi, sorry.

369
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,314
No, that's all right.
We're just getting going.
All right, so...

370
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:42,970
[Raquel]
This year, I'm graduating
from University of Michigan.

371
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:46,365
Unfortunately,
due to the pandemic,

372
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:49,585
I have to finish
my classes online.

373
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:52,632
But that's okay.

374
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:56,026
In between classes,
I get to hang out
with my family.

375
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:59,073
And my boyfriend Austin
also works at the restaurant,

376
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:02,859
so it's nice to be surrounded
by the people I love.

377
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:08,952
-Uh, we've got the Alfredo
pandemic of 2020.
-[both chuckle]

378
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,044
[Raquel] Whenever somebody
asks me what my plans are
after graduation,

379
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:17,831
I always get nervous
because I'm not exactly sure.

380
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:21,356
But all I know is, like,
right now I need to help

381
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:24,533
at the restaurant and be here
for my family.

382
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:27,841
[David] So do you think you're
gonna take over the restaurant
one day?

383
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:32,498
Um... I don't know, I...

384
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:36,763
It's not-- I'm not exactly
sure what my future plans are.

385
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:41,463
It's not always easy.
Not everybody knows what
their passion is right away,

386
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:44,161
-like you, David.
-[David] Yeah.

387
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:48,644
-This good?
-[woman] Yeah, okay.

388
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:52,169
I'm pretty sure you just lazily
put that mic on your shirt.

389
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,955
I did, but that's because
I don't think we're gonna
use this footage at all.

390
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,653
We should use this footage.
You're part of the family.

391
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:59,873
[guitars playing]

392
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:07,054
[Chun singing
"Champa Battambang"]

393
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:09,012
[Kat] Are you happy
that you came to Michigan?

394
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:11,754
I am. I'm very happy
I came to Michigan, um...

395
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,716
Yeah, I-- I can't imagine
being in New York right now.

396
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:19,936
[singing continues]

397
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:27,857
I love coming home.
Being able to spend
time with family...

398
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:30,120
-Hey, what's up?
Welcome to, uh...
-[Jaclyn] David...

399
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:31,992
And she got two.

400
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,561
...for all that it is--
the good, the bad, the ugly...

401
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,388
All right, ready, guys?

402
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:42,263
-[all laughing]
-How much did you drink?

403
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:46,180
[Kat] What made you wanna
make this documentary?

404
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:49,226
[David]
I don't really know yet.

405
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:52,142
Right now it's really observing
the story of our family,

406
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:55,885
of how this pandemic
is affecting us.

407
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:59,454
[singing continues]

408
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,848
[David]
But I've always felt my family

409
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,677
had an important story
to share,

410
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,635
especially my dad.

411
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:09,769
[singing continues]

412
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:12,728
[David]
His stories about surviving
Cambodia has shaped

413
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:15,905
so much of who I am
as a filmmaker.

414
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:18,342
We even made my first
short film together

415
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:21,824
about his childhood
in Cambodia.

416
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:25,436
And the more I learn
about my family's history

417
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:28,657
and how far we've all come
in this country,

418
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:31,399
the more I just want
to share those stories.

419
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,489
[Chun singing continues]

420
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:53,464
[Chun]
You know, I am scared to death
about this pandemic.

421
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:58,165
I never get that scared during
the Cambodian Killing Field

422
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,384
as what I am today.

423
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:08,175
-[somber music]
-[explosions]

424
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:11,831
-[Chun] April 17, 1975...
-[people screaming]

425
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:17,184
...when everything changed
in Cambodia.

426
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:19,882
Now we're dealing with
a brand-new government

427
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:24,408
-that are full
of hate and anger.
-[indistinct shouting]

428
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,021
They forced everybody
from the city

429
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:30,501
into the countryside.

430
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,329
Get out, get out.

431
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,854
If you can't move,
decide not to get out,

432
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:37,552
they would just kill you
right there on the spot.

433
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,602
That is when
the Killing Field begin.

434
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,821
[music continues]

435
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,403
This is the last place
that I saw my father.

436
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:06,668
My mom survived
with six children,

437
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,804
make our way to arrive
in Romeo, Michigan.

438
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:16,417
The nature of all--
everything what we did
is through survival.

439
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:24,860
It's no different
when I'm talking
to just two of you.

440
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:28,647
I'm talking to all eight of you
all at one time.

441
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:31,214
I'm gonna close
the restaurant down.

442
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:33,390
Okay? Once I get done,
I'm trying to get a little bit

443
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,523
of money from the bank first.

444
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:39,832
How long can we afford
to stay closed?

445
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:43,400
[scoffs] Ha!
Right now we've got
nothing to lose.

446
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:48,362
But I can't make
another one of you or you
or you or her or me.

447
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:50,843
Yes, a lot of people
have died from it,

448
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:54,455
-but a lot of people have
also been okay.
-Yes. Yes.

449
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:57,023
That's what we say
the chances are.

450
00:27:57,153 --> 00:28:00,722
I still have really high hope

451
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:03,464
that none of us is infected.

452
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:06,946
Don't push it.

453
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,253
[soft music]

454
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:14,693
Think really hard.
Does Baba actually mean that?

455
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:18,653
-We all want to be healthy.
-But you have to be logical.

456
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:21,351
Okay, I know.
I'm not saying that
we close the restaurant--

457
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:22,918
-What does...
-[overlapping dialogue]

458
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:25,312
[Jaclyn] Even as a kid,
I worried about money.

459
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:27,227
Being the oldest child,

460
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:30,709
I always felt that I had
to do everything I could

461
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,537
to make sure I helped
the restaurant

462
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:35,757
so that we would
have a house to live in.

463
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:39,152
It was never an option
to give up.

464
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:43,025
They're gonna start closing
gas stations too,

465
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:45,549
like the convenience part.

466
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,596
-Just if you want gas,
you just pay out at the pump.
-Oh.

467
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,946
Credit card only.

468
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:53,122
[Rachel] I wanna know
why you wanna stay open.

469
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:56,169
[Jaclyn] Because I think
that you and Baba
are panicking,

470
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:58,519
and I'm not saying
that people shouldn't
be concerned.

471
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:00,477
That is not what I'm saying.

472
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:02,958
Baba can't even be happy
when things are good,

473
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,613
and you think he's gonna be
happy when things are bad?

474
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,834
Jaclyn, what about
if just you guys open?

475
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:11,358
-You told me you--
-I just want you guys
to stay away from us.

476
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,664
-[Rachel] Okay.
-And don't bug us
when we're here.

477
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:16,189
[Rachel]
I won't, I promise. Pssh.

478
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:21,411
-[Jaclyn] What is, uh...
-Chicken burrito one time,
b-mac quesadilla.

479
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:23,370
Give me a buffalo mac, please.

480
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,764
-We just need
those shrimp tacos.
-Yeah.

481
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,419
[Jaclyn] This is the first time
in 30 years

482
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,248
that my parents can
actually take a little break

483
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:35,469
and not have to worry
about waking up and going
to run a business.

484
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,780
[Rachel]
We don't have to see anybody,
we don't have to talk to anyone.

485
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,305
Just enjoy the drive,
the view.

486
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:50,005
[Jaclyn] Even with
all of the craziness going on
in the world right now,

487
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:54,401
I think it's important
to appreciate the little things
in life

488
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:57,143
that maybe we took
for granted before.

489
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:03,105
[Chun] Easter Sunday,
April the 12th, 2020.

490
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,454

00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:14,369
regardless of race,
unified in understanding
the significance of this.

818
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,850
[woman on TV]
That is the Los Angeles
Police Department.

819
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:19,722
There was a much more sizable
police presence

820
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:22,812
that just suddenly advanced
off of that one block.

821
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:25,685
And what's been happening
is that at...

822
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:27,643
[music continues]

823
00:48:27,774 --> 00:48:29,428
[Austin]
Honestly, I recognize that

824
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:33,258
I'm different in only one way
and that's my skin color.

825
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:35,129
But other than that, man,

826
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,089
I'm pretty much the same
as everybody around here.

827
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,612
[David]
And you're adopted, right?

828
00:48:39,742 --> 00:48:41,222
[Austin]
Right, yeah, I am adopted.

829
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:42,745
You know, my parents,
they're white,

830
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:45,270
so that probably helps a lot.

831
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:47,881
[Raquel]
I think it's hard for Austin

832
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:50,318
to talk about his Blackness
because he grew up

833
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:53,800
in this white community,

834
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,108
but when I talk
to Austin about my experiences

835
00:48:57,238 --> 00:49:01,286
of growing up in this community
as a minority,

836
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:06,769
I think he realized that racism
comes in many different forms.

837
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,426
[Austin]
I hate that Huron County
is judged as, like, racist.

838
00:49:11,557 --> 00:49:15,474
People are usually
nice to me when I'm around,
but maybe when I'm not around,

839
00:49:15,604 --> 00:49:17,911
they can be a completely
different person.

840
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:23,351
[Raquel] So I'm just trying
to let him know

841
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:26,789
that it's okay for him
to have those conversations

842
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,490
about him being Black
and how that makes him feel.

843
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,275
[Austin] It's just not fun
to talk about at all.

844
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:37,104
Anything related to being
a Black person,

845
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:39,802
any questions related to being
Black, man,

846
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:42,240
just I hate talking about it.

847
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,330
[crickets chirping]

848
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:54,034
[Jaclyn] Part of me is, like,
scared of like-- not scared
of going-- but, like--

849
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:57,429
I'm scared to see our customers.
Like, I'm gonna be in front of--

850
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,866
Like, I'm scared
to see our customers,
and I'm scared that it, like,

851
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,216
for it to be held, like,
against our family.

852
00:50:02,347 --> 00:50:05,654
Like, I-- I want to go.

853
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:08,092
Just show up
and show your support.

854
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:09,832
I think they're gonna have
a couple of speakers...

855
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:11,530
[Jaclyn]
I feel like one of the reasons

856
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,055
why my parents are able to make
the restaurant successful

857
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:19,581
is because they
assimilated in the way
that people expect them to.

858
00:50:19,712 --> 00:50:21,540
Come to work,
get your stuff done,

859
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,368
don't open your mouth,
don't say too much,

860
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:25,718
make sure you don't speak up
too loud.

861
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:28,721
My parents are good
at biting their tongue,

862
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:32,377
but I don't think
I can be that way.

863
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:35,423
[sizzling]

864
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:40,559
[Chun] As a businessman
in a small town, the art of
winning the war

865
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:46,043
is not always,
you know, get out there
and expose yourself.

866
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:48,784
I'm not gonna expose myself.

867
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:51,309
I'm not gonna go on top
of a stage.

868
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:56,183
I am a Asian American.

869
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:59,621
You are the Mexican American.

870
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:03,364
Trying to do business
in this community,

871
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:05,801
try to learns
about this community,

872
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:08,978
fight all the adversity
from the beginning,

873
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:13,113
why now, all of a sudden,
you just want to stick
your head out

874
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:17,248
to be the-- might be the target?

875
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:22,905
[birds chirping]

876
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:29,434
Austin?

877
00:51:31,392 --> 00:51:32,524
Hello?

878
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,048
Are you coming?

879
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:40,097
Yeah. I'm sure
I'll be in the area.

880
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:43,752
-[chuckles]
What does that mean?
-Who knows?

881
00:51:43,883 --> 00:51:47,234
-What do you mean
you're gonna "be in the area"?
-I'll be in the area.

882
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:51,325
-Why don't you go with
your parents? Maybe then--
-You might see 'em.

883
00:51:58,245 --> 00:52:01,205
[somber music]

884
00:52:04,338 --> 00:52:05,774
Where is it?

885
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,655
[exhales]
There are just cops
stationed everywhere, so...

886
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:18,047
[David] It's crazy.

887
00:52:22,922 --> 00:52:25,968
Are you, like, nervous at all?
'Cause I am.

888
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:29,537
-Yeah, I mean...
-It's like...

889
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:33,498
We're also gonna be-- not only
am I Black coming up there,
you've got a big camera.

890
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:35,761
-We're gonna have eyes on us.
-[turn signal clicking]

891
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:38,851
Right here should be good.

892
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,211
-[Rachel] Hello.
-Hi.

893
00:52:52,995 --> 00:52:55,128
-Hi, Rachel.
Good, how are you?
-Hello, how are you doing?

894
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:56,477
I'm okay.

895
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:58,784
[Raquel] It's so weird
having this happen

896
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:00,742
in this environment.

897
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:03,005
Like, I'm more comfortable,
I guess, in Ann Arbor

898
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:04,790
at a Black Lives Matter
protest

899
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:10,099
versus being in Bad Axe
at a Black Live Matters protest.

900
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:15,540
[Skyler]
In the 2016 election,
I voted for Donald Trump.

901
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:21,894
I had been surrounding myself
with very conservative

902
00:53:22,024 --> 00:53:26,115
Republican people--
families, friends--

903
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:31,469
and it took me
a really long time to realize

904
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,646
what type of a person
he truly is.

905
00:53:34,776 --> 00:53:37,257
I really dug deep into my soul
and thought,

906
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:39,346
"I can be my own person."

907
00:53:39,477 --> 00:53:42,262
This will be the first step
that I've taken publicly

908
00:53:42,393 --> 00:53:45,178
and I'll be able to look back
on it one day

909
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,920
and tell my children, you know,

910
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:51,358
it takes every ounce
of your soul

911
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:54,492
-to stand up
for what's right...
-[indistinct chanting]

912
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:56,711
even if your family
doesn't agree with you.

913
00:53:56,842 --> 00:54:00,933
[protesters chanting]
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

914
00:54:01,063 --> 00:54:04,893
[Chun]
Am I stick my head out there
to put myself as a target?

915
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:08,245
No, I don't.
I'm not silence
about this whole thing.

916
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,986
Let these kids express
themself.

917
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:12,510
[protesters chanting]
I can't breathe!

918
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,468
-[woman] No justice!
-[crowd] No peace!

919
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:16,078
[Austin]
Before the George Floyd thing,

920
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:19,560
did I really pay much attention
to police brutality?

921
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:22,041
No. I don't pay attention
to really anything.

922
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:26,480
[protesters chanting]
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

923
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:28,700
-[protesters] George Floyd!
-[woman] Say his name!

924
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,963
-George Floyd!
-Say his name!

925
00:54:31,093 --> 00:54:33,095
-George Floyd!
-Say his name!

926
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:35,272
-George Floyd!
-Say his name!

00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,535
-George Floyd!
-Say his name!

928
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:39,624
-George Floyd!
-Say his name!

00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:42,017
-George Floyd!
-[man] White power!

00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:43,976
-[protesters] George Floyd!
-[woman] Say his name!

931
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:46,239
-George Floyd!
-Say his name!

932
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,285
-George Floyd!
-Say his name!

933
00:54:48,415 --> 00:54:50,591
-George Floyd!
-Say his name!

934
00:54:50,722 --> 00:54:52,201
-George Floyd!
-Say his name!

935
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:54,726
[woman 2] We're unarmed!
We're unarmed!

936
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:56,989
Why do you feel the need
to be armed?

937
00:54:58,033 --> 00:54:59,905
We have a right.
We have freedom of speech.

938
00:55:00,035 --> 00:55:02,211
-And we are
protecting your right.
-Right, good.

939
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:03,648
They're fucking cowards,

940
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:06,390
that's why,
that's why, that's why!

941
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,044
That's why you have
your fucking guns!
'Cause they're fucking cowards!

942
00:55:09,175 --> 00:55:11,569
-[woman 3]
You ain't shit with that gun!
-[protesters shouting]

943
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:13,745
-[man] That's why!
-[woman 3] Are you scared?!

944
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:15,573
-You're a tough guy!
-Ignore them. I'm out.

945
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:17,444
-You don't need
that fucking gun!
-Hold that in their face.

946
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:21,709
Some people are dead!
They're dead because
I've been silent

947
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,930
because I didn't
have these conversations.
Another death happens.

948
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,411
[Jaclyn]
Wait, who are they worried
about inciting violence, though?

949
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:30,370
The protesters
or the fucking little bitches
here?

950
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:33,242
You tell me, look around you.

951
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:35,941
I could've been gunned down,
died the next day.

952
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:37,638
And it wouldn't
have mattered to him,

953
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:40,467
but it made me feel like
my life didn't matter.

954
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:43,122
[cheering and applause]

955
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:45,037

Sieg Heil!

-Would you be willing to say
Black lives matter?
-All lives matter.

961
00:56:03,142 --> 00:56:04,926
It's Black people
right now in America

962
00:56:05,057 --> 00:56:06,493
that are crying out
for our help.

963
00:56:06,624 --> 00:56:07,886
All lives matter.

[man] You, sir,
serve your country!

00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:14,066
-It's fucking
disrespectful that you're here.
-[masked man] Quiet, gook.

967
00:56:14,196 --> 00:56:16,764
[man] What?
No, you're talking to me
right now, fucker, come on!

968
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,071
-No, he called me a gook.
-You don't wanna speak out
against me.

969
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:21,160
[Jaclyn]
I think you mean a gook,
you fucking dumbass.

970
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,380
You can't even fucking
pronounce it right.

You think you're tough.

974
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:33,999

Take that mask off!
Take those sunglasses off!

975
00:56:34,129 --> 00:56:36,218
-[masked man] We are supported
by the establishment.
-[man shouting]

Fuck you and fuck you,
fuck you and fuck you!

01:04:48,101 --> 01:04:50,451
and out of the way
and move on.

1136
01:04:50,582 --> 01:04:52,453
Does anyone have any questions?

1137
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:54,978
No?

1138
01:04:55,108 --> 01:04:58,198
Okay, well, I hope the morale
picks up because right now,

1139
01:04:58,329 --> 01:05:01,027
I just feel like
I'm just down here low.

1140
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:03,943
I feel low.
I don't wanna feel low.

1141
01:05:04,074 --> 01:05:05,858
[emotional music]

1142
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:19,654
What if I don't want you
to go to the restaurant?
You okay with that?

1143
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:23,354
When do you see me happy?
Like, I feel like--

1144
01:05:23,484 --> 01:05:25,138
-With your pets.
-That's true.

1145
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:27,097
And if you had kids,
I think you'd be just as happy.

1146
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:29,664
I'm... don't doubt
that kids would make me happy.

1147
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:32,537
If I-- We're thinking
about what's in the best
interest of like our family,

1148
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:35,453
like, and like Raquel, like...

1149
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,890
I truly think that she should

1150
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:40,501
do the restaurant
for at least a little bit.

1151
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:42,242
Well, what if there's
a possibility for you

1152
01:05:42,373 --> 01:05:47,552
to be in Bad Axe
and do your job and then...

1153
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:52,774
you don't have, like,
the full ownership of the place.

1154
01:05:52,905 --> 01:05:55,386
-Or you just help out.
-I mean, I think a big part
is, though, like,

1155
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:57,823
what is Raquel
going to decide to do?

1156
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,999
'Cause I know,
and I don't want to, like...

1157
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:01,958
I know restaurant business
is so hard.

1158
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:04,177
I can't do it by myself.
I can't.

1159
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:05,962
I don't wanna be like
my parents,

1160
01:06:06,092 --> 01:06:08,138
and I don't mean that
in a bad way.

1161
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:11,445
[music continues]

1162
01:06:11,576 --> 01:06:14,231
[Raquel]
Jaclyn's been
asking me a lot about

1163
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:17,364
what my plans are,
and my mom's been asking me.

1164
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:19,671
But it's hard for me to make
a decision

1165
01:06:19,801 --> 01:06:24,241
'cause who am I to not help
the family when they need it?

1166
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:27,853
They take a lot of pride
in the restaurant

1167
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:33,424
and that our family was able
to get to where it is today.

1168
01:06:35,948 --> 01:06:37,341
[Rachel]
Seriously, David?

1169
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:42,128
What are you doing?
Why do you do that?

1170
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:46,785
-[David] Aren't you gonna miss
the camera in your face?
-Oh. [laughs]

1171
01:06:46,915 --> 01:06:49,440
Mmm, I don't think so, honey.

1172
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:54,836
What are we gonna do now?
What are you gonna do now?

1173
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:57,796
-Put it all together.
-Now you gotta go work
for somebody else

1174
01:06:59,406 --> 01:07:01,060
for a little while.

1175
01:07:01,191 --> 01:07:03,410
[Mike] Yeah, David,
what are you gonna do now?

1176
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:06,413
[David] Finish this movie.

1177
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:08,372
[dramatic music]

1178
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:13,420

[computer mouse clicks]

1187
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,525
[Brianna Keilar]
Racist rhetoric against Asians

1188
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:17,223
and Asian Americans has become
a real problem in the US

1189
01:08:17,354 --> 01:08:20,096
amid the coronavirus
that originated in China.

1190
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:22,315
The president is promoting
this kind of language.

1191
01:08:22,446 --> 01:08:24,448
He refers to and has referred
to the virus

1192
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:27,015
as the "China Virus,"
as the "Kung Flu."

1193
01:08:32,804 --> 01:08:34,719
"What a nice video
about your family

1194
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:37,374
and living the American dream
after leaving Cambodia

1195
01:08:37,504 --> 01:08:39,767
for everything America
has to offer.

1196
01:08:39,898 --> 01:08:42,553
You were right that many of your
customers are Trump supporters.

1197
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:45,860
But Bad Axe isn't changing from
traditional American values.

1198
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:48,646
My family and many that
we've discussed your video with

1199
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:50,735
will be changing
our restaurant routine,

1200
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:53,607
and Rachel's
is no longer a choice.

1201
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:57,045
Of course, you could return
to Cambodia for opportunity."

1202
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:01,615
[Mike] That's what a small
community should do.

1203
01:09:01,746 --> 01:09:04,792
You should be able to disagree
and still support each other.

1204
01:09:04,923 --> 01:09:08,274
And not just be like,
"Oh, if you don't believe
the way I believe,

1205
01:09:08,405 --> 01:09:10,537
I'm not coming
to your restaurant and neither
are any of my friends."

1206
01:09:12,017 --> 01:09:13,540
I guess they just
don't understand.

1207
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:16,761
They don't know
because they don't ever
go through that.

1208
01:09:16,891 --> 01:09:18,806
They don't-- They're not
in Walmart parking lot

1209
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:21,766
getting called
an Asian slur at them

1210
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:25,944
like you have
and your family has.

1211
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:31,558
When you come out
and say things like you have,

1212
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:34,648
they can't understand it because
they don't think it exists.

1213
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:37,564
"We'll support you if you

1214
01:09:39,871 --> 01:09:43,614
stay quiet and just act the way
we want you to act.

1215
01:09:43,744 --> 01:09:47,661
And if you don't,
then screw you."

1216
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:51,099
[wind blowing]

1217
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:57,584
David, this whole--
this whole filming thing
that you do,

1218
01:09:57,715 --> 01:10:00,631
I am really proud of you, okay?

1219
01:10:00,761 --> 01:10:03,416
-But at the same time--
-Okay, but it also feels like
you're so proud of me,

1220
01:10:03,547 --> 01:10:05,418
but, like, don't say
how you feel.

1221
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:07,551
-[Rachel] Uh, that's why we--
-Actually, at the end
of the day,

1222
01:10:07,681 --> 01:10:10,206
it's my love letter to Bad Axe.

1223
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:12,469
[Mike]
If you think this is
a love letter to Bad Axe...

1224
01:10:12,599 --> 01:10:13,687
-[David] Mm-hmm.
-...that--

1225
01:10:13,818 --> 01:10:15,341
You need to rewrite
the love letter.

1226
01:10:15,472 --> 01:10:17,822
And that can be up to you,

1227
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:20,390
how you can end that film.

1228
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,740
It's gonna be up to you

1229
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:27,135
if you think
that it gonna be a love letter
you want to wrote to Bad Axe.

1230
01:10:28,876 --> 01:10:31,749
[emotional music]

1231
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:36,449
Baba's just afraid that your
"love letter" to Bad Axe is...

1232
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:40,018
not gonna be taken
as a love letter

1233
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:42,150
by some people in Bad Axe.

1234
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:48,679
-[David] Yeah.
-Our Bad Axe and our experience
in Bad Axe is different

1235
01:10:48,809 --> 01:10:51,986
than probably most of the people
that grew up here.

1236
01:10:52,117 --> 01:10:55,642
Like, Bad Axe is still our home,
and we still love it.

1237
01:10:55,773 --> 01:10:58,297
[David] Right. Like, for me,
what I love about Bad Axe

1238
01:10:58,428 --> 01:11:01,648
is just being home
and being here.

1239
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:07,959
It's not necessarily
all of the small-town things
that every small town has.

1240
01:11:08,089 --> 01:11:11,267
It's home
because family's here.

1241
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:14,574
Yeah.

1242
01:11:15,923 --> 01:11:17,664
[music continues]

1243
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:42,254
[woman on phone]
The thing is, right,
you're making a movie,

1244
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:44,561
and you have them
in this movie,

1245
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:46,476
you know,
making it out to be,

1246
01:11:46,606 --> 01:11:49,783
"Oh, we're being attacked
by white supremacists."

1247
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:53,352
[Rachel] Did you not show up
and did the Nazi salute?
Are you that one?

1248
01:11:53,483 --> 01:11:56,529
[woman] Yes.
We were there first, correct?

1249
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:59,140
And, you know,
the little Asian bitch came up

1250
01:11:59,271 --> 01:12:01,752
when they weren't
even there for you.

1251
01:12:01,882 --> 01:12:05,408
-[Rachel] Who were
you there for with hate?
-[woman] Black Lives Matter.

1252
01:12:05,538 --> 01:12:08,019
They weren't even there
for Asians,

1253
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:11,718
but you guys decided to go up
and start some shit
just to get...

1254
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:14,504
[Rachel]
No, I'm-- I don't think so.
I don't really think

1255
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:17,289
-that was the intention at all.
-[woman] ...footage.

1256
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:19,073
[Rachel]
The local picture
was in the newspaper.

1257
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:22,250
Did you call the newspaper
and have them remove it?

1258
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:25,166
It was in the-- it was in
the Huron Daily Tribune.

1259
01:12:25,297 --> 01:12:27,995
[man on phone]
No, they were not
making an image.

1260
01:12:28,126 --> 01:12:29,823
They were putting it
how it was.

1261
01:12:29,954 --> 01:12:33,261
They had no...
no agenda.

1262
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,089
-[Jaclyn] Mom, you know...
-[Rachel] Okay.

1263
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,570
Now there is an agenda
behind the movie
against racism,

1264
01:12:37,701 --> 01:12:39,398
literally talking about it
in the description...

1265
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:41,487
-[Jaclyn] Say,
"The filmmaker will call you."
-...in the link.

1266
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:43,184
I'm in the front of it.

1267
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:45,709
I got doxed
because of this shit.

1268
01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:49,974
-[Rachel] Well--
-[Jaclyn] Race-- racism
is not being a Nazi?

1269
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:51,410
-What?
-Yes.

1270
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:53,238
Okay, I'm sorry,
if you wanna talk

1271
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,718
to the filmmaker,
talk to the filmmaker,

1272
01:12:54,848 --> 01:12:57,024
but you're not gonna talk
to my manager like this.

1273
01:12:57,155 --> 01:12:58,809
Leave the note.
That's all I'm asking.

1274
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:01,551
Don't tell me
to leave the note,
I will leave the note.

1275
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:05,076
[woman 2 on phone] You're
getting involved with things
that you know nothing about.

1276
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:07,905
You're going to end up
digging yourself
your own grave.

1277
01:13:08,035 --> 01:13:10,168
[Rachel]
I'm digging a grave
for myself now?

1278
01:13:10,298 --> 01:13:12,388
-[Stephanie] Rachel, you don't
owe them anything.
-Wow.

1279
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:15,303
-[Rachel] I'm pretty sure...
-She said we're gonna end up
digging our own grave.

1280
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:20,700
I am not here to bring up
or digging myself into a grave
or anything like that.

1281
01:13:20,831 --> 01:13:23,355
I'm trying to make sure
there's a conversation

1282
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:28,491
so that we can live together,
you know, among one another.

1283
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:32,233
I just want you to know
that it's better to have
conversations

1284
01:13:32,364 --> 01:13:37,717
than threatening some restaurant
that is not a part of it.

1285
01:13:37,848 --> 01:13:40,372
[automated voice]
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up--

1286
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:42,200
[phone beeps]

1287
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:44,811
Mom, you have to dissociate
yourself from that--

1288
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:48,293
-You need to calm down.
-[Raquel] No, Jaclyn,
'cause you're too hot.

1289
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,556
-Okay.
-[David] Do you think we can
call the police, though?

1290
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:54,168
I just got like
a call from the-- the--
[clicks tongue]

1291
01:13:54,299 --> 01:13:57,433
You know, the kids' face,
the Nazi kid?

1292
01:13:58,521 --> 01:14:02,960
He kinda made a threat,
so, um, I was gonna call
the police.

1293
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:05,049
But I wanted
to let you know first.

1294
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:09,793
-I really don't
wanna do this anymore.
-[Jaclyn] Are you scared or not?

1295
01:14:09,923 --> 01:14:13,144
'Cause if you're scared,
then the better thing to do
would be dissociate yourself.

1296
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:16,147
I'm scared
for the "Asian bitch."
That's what I'm scared about.

1297
01:14:16,277 --> 01:14:19,280
-I'm not scared for myself.
-[Raquel] Jaclyn, well,
you should be!

1298
01:14:19,411 --> 01:14:22,893
I knew this was gonna happen
the minute the backlash came
from David.

1299
01:14:23,023 --> 01:14:25,199
-I just-- it's--
-[Raquel] Exactly...

1300
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,767
David, you don't live here.
You have no clue.

1301
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:29,334
[Raquel whispers]
So stupid.

1302
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:34,600
-[David] Mom, I grew up here
just like everyone else.
-David, David.

1303
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:37,429
-But you really don't live here.
-I don't, no--

1304
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,911
-Exactly, so it doesn't
cost you a damn thing.
-[Raquel] Mom...

1305
01:14:43,087 --> 01:14:47,961
[David] What happened today
is gonna happen again when
the film comes out itself.

1306
01:14:48,092 --> 01:14:52,400
Like... do you want
to carry through with this?

1307
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:58,102
As long as nobody gets hurt,
then it's worth it.
Like words...

1308
01:15:00,017 --> 01:15:02,715
and threats and phone calls

1309
01:15:02,846 --> 01:15:07,372
and mail
and letters and messages,
it's like those are just things.

1310
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,635
Like if that's the worst
it's gonna be,

1311
01:15:09,766 --> 01:15:12,943
then it-- then it's worth it.

1312
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:16,033
[Mike] You gotta stop thinking
that they're dumb. Please!

1313
01:15:16,163 --> 01:15:19,123
Because if you think
they don't know this stuff,
you're wrong.

1314
01:15:19,253 --> 01:15:22,866
Okay, I'm not literally here
to get my ass chewed out
by Nazis and then by you.

1315
01:15:22,996 --> 01:15:24,650
Jaclyn, you don't know
what these guys

1316
01:15:24,781 --> 01:15:27,044
are capable of fucking doing
when you're by yourself.

1317
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:30,308
-I agree.
-Okay, stop, stop, stop.

1318
01:15:30,438 --> 01:15:33,180
-You belittled,
like rightfully so...
-Okay. Okay!

1319
01:15:33,311 --> 01:15:35,618
...belittled those guys
in front of a lot of people.

1320
01:15:35,748 --> 01:15:37,533
But like why-- do you think
I really want

1321
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:40,057
to get like bitched at
right now?

1322
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:41,841
You're mad 'cause
I fucking care? Like, you--

1323
01:15:41,972 --> 01:15:43,887
No, I'm mad because, like,
you're making it...

1324
01:15:44,017 --> 01:15:46,542
because like you're making me
feel worse and I just...

1325
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:48,021
I don't know what to do
'cause I'm scared

1326
01:15:48,152 --> 01:15:50,110
the next time you have
an interaction with them.

1327
01:15:50,241 --> 01:15:52,417
I'm not thatstupid.

1328
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:57,683
[somber music]

1329
01:15:57,814 --> 01:16:02,122
[Jaclyn]
Who do you think you are
walking in here with your guns

1330
01:16:02,253 --> 01:16:07,040
and your fucking combat gear?

1331
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:12,002
And I guess I just wanted
to make it a point, like,
"You don't scare me."

1332
01:16:12,132 --> 01:16:16,136
'Cause in that moment,
I wasn't scared. [chuckles]

1333
01:16:16,267 --> 01:16:20,140
And I don't know
if anyone else in this town
could understand that.

1334
01:16:26,538 --> 01:16:27,844
So I don't wanna have
a long discussion

1335
01:16:27,974 --> 01:16:29,802
and I don't feel like
getting lectured.

1336
01:16:29,933 --> 01:16:32,196
I just want to know
if Mike and I

1337
01:16:32,326 --> 01:16:35,112
can put a shotgun in the room
upstairs that we sleep in

1338
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:36,896
just-- just in case.

1339
01:16:37,027 --> 01:16:39,551
If you can't prove to me
you can shoot...

1340
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:41,727
You want me to go
load it right now?

1341
01:16:41,858 --> 01:16:43,381
[keypad beeping]

1342
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:47,994
[Jaclyn] Safety is on.

1343
01:16:49,169 --> 01:16:50,562
[clicking]

1344
01:16:52,303 --> 01:16:55,349
-It's loaded. It's ready to go.
Yeah, safety off.
-It's loaded.

1345
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,005
-It's ready to go.
-Lean, lean into the guns
like this.

1346
01:16:59,136 --> 01:17:01,007
Right there, just waiting.

1347
01:17:01,138 --> 01:17:05,403
-[clicking]
-[Chun] Just remember,
even if a block that big,

1348
01:17:05,533 --> 01:17:07,274
that still can save you.

1349
01:17:07,405 --> 01:17:09,494
-Just like that.
-[Jaclyn] Thank you.

1350
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,409
[music continues]

1351
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:15,108
[wind blowing]

1352
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:31,647
[car horn honking]

1353
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:43,659
[light dramatic music]

1354
01:17:46,444 --> 01:17:47,575
[Chun] Yep.

1355
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:50,230
[gun clip clicking]

1356
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:01,633
[music continues]

1357
01:18:14,124 --> 01:18:17,475
-[Raquel on phone] Dad?
-I'm right here waiting
for that guy.

1358
01:18:17,605 --> 01:18:22,610
Walk out there all by yourself,
get in your car, and drive
in this way.

1359
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:24,221
You can make a big loop.

1360
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:26,745
-Go back to the front
of the restaurant.
-Okay.

1361
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:29,052
Baba, don't do
anything dangerous.

1362
01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:33,970
We want to make sure
that somebody is not actually
look for you, follow you.

1363
01:18:35,188 --> 01:18:36,755
If there ends up any shooting,

1364
01:18:36,886 --> 01:18:39,845
you stay down to the lowest
floor as you can.

1365
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,806
-Is it her?
-[Rachel] Yes.

1366
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:47,070
[music continues]

1367
01:18:49,115 --> 01:18:51,509
[Raquel]
There's not even as many
of them as there usually are.

1368
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:53,816
[Rachel]
There's two trucks
coming right now.

1369
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:02,607
[Chun] Okay, now
follows that truck up.
They're right behind those guys.

1370
01:19:09,092 --> 01:19:10,484
[Rachel]
Yeah, they're following her.

1371
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:12,922
[Mike]
They're also going straight.

1372
01:19:13,052 --> 01:19:15,881
[Chun] That's okay,
I'm right behind him.
You'll be fine.

1373
01:19:17,578 --> 01:19:19,624
[Rachel]
They know I'm following them.

1374
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,366
-[Chun] The guy... [mumbles]
-[Rachel] Oh, my God.

1375
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:26,109
[Chun]
Piece of shit.

1376
01:19:28,154 --> 01:19:30,069
[Chun] Just a bunch
of high school kids

1377
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,941
-who got nothing better to do.
-[phone dings]

1378
01:19:32,071 --> 01:19:33,551
[Rachel]
Well, I hope that's what it is.

1379
01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:35,509
[Chun]
That's all they are.

1380
01:19:39,731 --> 01:19:42,778
[indistinct chatter]

1381
01:19:46,999 --> 01:19:49,872
The last two nights
I've come home,

1382
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:53,353
those... trucks

1383
01:19:53,484 --> 01:19:55,442
that hang out
outside the restaurant

1384
01:19:55,573 --> 01:19:59,359
with their Trump flags
and Confederate flags

1385
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:02,014
and All Lives Matter

1386
01:20:02,145 --> 01:20:05,235
have tried following me.

1387
01:20:06,976 --> 01:20:09,761
I think they can tell
that they...

1388
01:20:09,892 --> 01:20:13,809
freaked me out 'cause
I definitely stepped on the gas.

1389
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:15,767
And they turned the other way,

1390
01:20:15,898 --> 01:20:19,031
and it was just very
uncomfortable, I don't know.

1391
01:20:21,947 --> 01:20:24,558
I've just been very paranoid
ever since, so...
[chuckles]

1392
01:20:24,689 --> 01:20:26,299
[TV playing in background]

1393
01:20:30,738 --> 01:20:33,263
[Chun]
They will come after you.

1394
01:20:33,393 --> 01:20:35,743
Not likely right now.

1395
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:38,572
And if Trump happens
to be in the office,

1396
01:20:38,703 --> 01:20:42,315
you got a bunch of racists
that can't wait.

1397
01:20:42,446 --> 01:20:45,057
We have to constantly worry
every night.

1398
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:48,974
I hope and pray
that they don't hurt

1399
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:51,585
any of my family members
because...

1400
01:20:51,716 --> 01:20:54,501
I'm not the kind of father
that can sit down

1401
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:57,678
and watch a trial.

1402
01:20:58,941 --> 01:21:02,727
So be careful what you do
and what you say.

1403
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,557
-We don't want you
to not be passionate about...
-You can't reverse it.

1404
01:21:06,687 --> 01:21:10,430
That's-- that's probably one
of the worst kind of hate ever.

1405
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:13,085
-But there's other ways
that you can fight it.
-[sniffles]

1406
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:17,873
If I have to explain to people

1407
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:21,833
why Black lives matter,

1408
01:21:21,964 --> 01:21:24,357
tell them to take
a look at that

1409
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:26,882
and what our country
has suffered.

1410
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:29,536
[gentle music]

1411
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,804
[upbeat music playing
over speakers]

1412
01:21:41,722 --> 01:21:43,289
[Jaclyn] Oh, my God!

1413
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:50,818
-[Jaclyn] Where's my mom?
-[Skyler] Out on the patio.

1414
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:52,646
-Is there anybody out there?
-Yeah.

1415
01:21:52,777 --> 01:21:55,519
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Mike] What just happened?

1416
01:21:55,649 --> 01:21:56,650
[Raquel]
The Nazis got arrested.

1417
01:21:56,781 --> 01:21:57,956
[Jaclyn]
They just got arrested,

1418
01:21:58,087 --> 01:21:59,827
two of them,
Michigan State Police,

1419
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:02,700
got arrested yesterday,
four felony charges
against them.

1420
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:05,355
One of 'em is the ringleader
of a white supremacy--

1421
01:22:05,485 --> 01:22:07,487
The guy is 25, Justen Watkins,
he was just arrested.

1422
01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:10,099
It's an ongoing story.
They're going to prison.

1423
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:12,101
Holy shit!

1424
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:15,017
What a day for America.

1425
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,282
I was telling her, I'm-- like,
we could be terrorized.

1426
01:22:19,412 --> 01:22:21,023
And I'm like I'm not even
worried about me.

1427
01:22:21,153 --> 01:22:23,416
I'm worried about, like, you
and them keeping an eye on you.

1428
01:22:23,547 --> 01:22:25,636
And then you find out
that these two guys

1429
01:22:25,766 --> 01:22:28,552
actually did terrorize
a family, like...

1430
01:22:28,682 --> 01:22:30,815
That's how close
I think this was.

1431
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,948
Put your camera down.
The cops are coming.

1432
01:22:34,514 --> 01:22:36,038
[David]
What's that right there, Mike?

1433
01:22:37,126 --> 01:22:38,605
That's the house.

1434
01:22:41,652 --> 01:22:43,610
[wind blowing]

1435
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:51,705
-[officer] Morning.
-[David] Hi, officers.

1436
01:22:51,836 --> 01:22:53,446
-[officer] How we doing?
-Good, how are you doing?

1437
01:22:53,577 --> 01:22:56,493
I'm okay.
Okay, and your--
I'm sorry, your family

1438
01:22:56,623 --> 01:22:58,669
-owns what restaurant?
-[David] Rachel's.

1439
01:23:00,236 --> 01:23:02,586
Okay. [clicks tongue]
All right, good enough.

1440
01:23:02,716 --> 01:23:07,069
So, uh, potential that somebody
might wanna talk to you

1441
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:10,072
-and maybe see your... footage.
-Sure, sure.

1442
01:23:10,202 --> 01:23:11,725
-Would that be all right?
-Yeah.

1443
01:23:16,513 --> 01:23:19,559
In the name of their
white supremacist beliefs,

1444
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:23,781
FBI agents arrested 25-year-old
Justen Watkins of Bad Axe

1445
01:23:23,911 --> 01:23:28,003
and 35-year-old Alfred Gorman
of Taylor this morning.

1446
01:23:28,133 --> 01:23:32,529
Investigators say the two
belong to a neo-Nazi group
called the Base,

1447
01:23:32,659 --> 01:23:37,316
which aims to carry out
violent acts and incite
a race war.

1448
01:23:37,447 --> 01:23:40,885
The two are accused of
terrorizing a family in Dexter

1449
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,453
mistakenly thinking
they were at the home

1450
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:48,675
of a man who runs
an anti-supremacist podcast.

1451
01:23:48,806 --> 01:23:52,288
[announcer]
Weekdays at noon and 5:30,
coverage you can count on.

1452
01:23:52,418 --> 01:23:55,247
-[guitar music on TV]
-[man on TV] Michigan...

1453
01:23:55,378 --> 01:23:59,164
a place where people
respect each other.

1454
01:23:59,295 --> 01:24:01,862
Every single person
that went online

1455
01:24:01,993 --> 01:24:04,561
and defended those people
saying that it's their right

1456
01:24:04,691 --> 01:24:06,432
-to show up...
-[Mike] I have screenshots...

1457
01:24:06,563 --> 01:24:08,695
And it is
their right to show up.

1458
01:24:08,826 --> 01:24:12,308
It is not your right to run
a frickin' Nazi training camp
to train people

1459
01:24:12,438 --> 01:24:15,789
how to exterminate everybody
except white people.

1460
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,878
Like, that is not your right.

1461
01:24:18,009 --> 01:24:20,142
So all those people defending,

1462
01:24:20,272 --> 01:24:22,187
and all those people
who defended those Nazis,

1463
01:24:22,318 --> 01:24:24,450
I hope they feel
like frickin' asses.

1464
01:24:24,581 --> 01:24:26,409
[somber music]

1465
01:24:26,539 --> 01:24:30,543
[Chun] Some people
will never understand

1466
01:24:30,674 --> 01:24:33,198
what the power of hate and evil

1467
01:24:33,329 --> 01:24:35,983
can do to a human being.

1468
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:37,333
But I do.

1469
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:48,431
Many people
in the village died.

1470
01:24:48,561 --> 01:24:50,737
But you don't care.

1471
01:24:50,868 --> 01:24:52,565
You see people die
all the time.

1472
01:24:52,696 --> 01:24:55,786
You see people get shot.
You see people get slaughtered.

1473
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:57,657
You see corpse floating around.

1474
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:03,010
And that's when my father
began to say

1475
01:25:03,141 --> 01:25:07,058
that if he stay there,
he gonna be dead.

1476
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:10,801
He might as well try to get out,

1477
01:25:10,931 --> 01:25:13,064
try to escape.

1478
01:25:13,195 --> 01:25:15,022
I put my dad on a canoe,

1479
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:17,938
paddle him all the way
across that river,

1480
01:25:18,069 --> 01:25:22,726
drop him off, and hope that
someday we'll meet again.

1481
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:29,515
But I never even get to shed
one drop of tear.

1482
01:25:33,476 --> 01:25:34,999
He never returned.

1483
01:25:38,655 --> 01:25:41,962
All a sudden, one night
they make a run for it.

1484
01:25:42,093 --> 01:25:44,922
You can hear the bullets
just flying across your head.

1485
01:25:45,052 --> 01:25:47,142
Keep going, keep going.

1486
01:25:47,272 --> 01:25:50,275
One day, next day,
the following day.

1487
01:25:50,406 --> 01:25:53,974
We made that journey
to Thailand's border.

1488
01:25:55,454 --> 01:25:57,804
For everything that I did,

1489
01:25:57,935 --> 01:26:04,071
my mom
and all six children survive.

1490
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:08,989
When we get into
the Red Cross camp

1491
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,731
as a refugee with no country,

1492
01:26:12,993 --> 01:26:16,475
where do you want to go?

1493
01:26:16,606 --> 01:26:18,216
That's when Mom say

1494
01:26:18,347 --> 01:26:20,827
United State of America.

1495
01:26:23,526 --> 01:26:26,268
You can't wait
for the plane to land.

1496
01:26:26,398 --> 01:26:29,358
The flight attendant say,
"Okay, you can get up now."

1497
01:26:29,488 --> 01:26:32,578
For the first time in our life

1498
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:35,102
and probably...

1499
01:26:36,103 --> 01:26:37,844
almost five years

1500
01:26:37,975 --> 01:26:41,065
that we was greeting by

1501
01:26:42,588 --> 01:26:43,850
a flower,

1502
01:26:45,112 --> 01:26:48,855
hug, kiss, with love.

1503
01:26:50,509 --> 01:26:51,902
With care...

1504
01:26:55,122 --> 01:26:56,863
and with our dream

1505
01:26:56,994 --> 01:27:00,345
of what America is.

1506
01:27:05,959 --> 01:27:07,787
[music continues]

1507
01:27:12,401 --> 01:27:14,185
[wind blowing]

1508
01:27:24,804 --> 01:27:28,243
[Kat] Your dad is right.
[chuckles] You need to re-write
your love letter

1509
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:30,157
because it's not to the people
of Bad Axe.

1510
01:27:30,288 --> 01:27:32,682
-Yeah.
-It's to your family

1511
01:27:32,812 --> 01:27:35,685
-and what they've
gone through...
-Yeah.

1512
01:27:35,815 --> 01:27:37,513
-...in Bad Axe.
-Yeah.

1513
01:27:38,557 --> 01:27:41,952
I think-- I think
even just, um...

1514
01:27:42,082 --> 01:27:46,173
growing up in Bad Axe
has just shaped like so much
of like who are family is.

1515
01:27:46,304 --> 01:27:48,872
It's helped create this bond

1516
01:27:49,002 --> 01:27:53,572
and, you know, for that
I, like, I'm thankful, you know.

1517
01:27:53,703 --> 01:27:56,053
It's a love letter
to Bad Axe because...

1518
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:00,362
like, yeah,
even though, you know,

1519
01:28:01,493 --> 01:28:05,018
our family has our frustrations
with Bad Axe,

1520
01:28:05,149 --> 01:28:07,238
we still wouldn't be
where we are today

1521
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:09,719
if we didn't have the community
of Bad Axe,

1522
01:28:09,849 --> 01:28:12,069
and that includes the people
that have supported us

1523
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:15,159
and the people
that haven't supported us.

1524
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:19,424
Because it's the people
that supported us that continue
to support our business

1525
01:28:19,555 --> 01:28:21,861
and allow us to, like,
achieve this American dream.

1526
01:28:21,992 --> 01:28:24,516
And it's the people
who haven't supported us

1527
01:28:24,647 --> 01:28:27,911
who have only forced us
that much closer together
as a family

1528
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:32,655
and, you know,
for that I'm thankful
and, um...

1529
01:28:32,785 --> 01:28:36,136
I'm thankful for Bad Axe
for-- for doing that.

1530
01:28:36,267 --> 01:28:37,660
That's why it's a love letter.

1531
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:40,010
[sentimental music]

1532
01:28:47,017 --> 01:28:49,585
[Jaclyn] Bad Axe is home for me.
It's hard to describe.

1533
01:28:49,715 --> 01:28:51,978
And it's a place
that I can one day
maybe raise a family,

1534
01:28:52,109 --> 01:28:54,067
kind of like how my parents
moved here

1535
01:28:54,198 --> 01:28:57,419
with their young kids
and started a life.

1536
01:28:57,549 --> 01:29:01,161
You want it to get better.
You don't wanna just, like,
write it off.

1537
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:04,426
And it's a place
that I, like, see hope in it.

1538
01:29:06,645 --> 01:29:09,431
[Skyler] I'm gonna take a lot
away from how my parents

1539
01:29:09,561 --> 01:29:13,043
raised me in a positive way,
you know...

1540
01:29:13,173 --> 01:29:16,263
I don't agree with
everything on them, but...

1541
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:20,311
they really are good people,
and I love them so much.

1542
01:29:20,442 --> 01:29:22,313
Love conquers all.

1543
01:29:22,444 --> 01:29:26,012
-[David] Why you drinking
Fireball, Austin?
-I...

1544
01:29:26,143 --> 01:29:28,406
It's like tailgating season.
It's chilly.

1545
01:29:28,537 --> 01:29:29,755
[Raquel]
Are you a little nervous?

1546
01:29:29,886 --> 01:29:31,409
-Your first time voting.
-[mumbles]

1547
01:29:32,584 --> 01:29:34,151
[Raquel] It's okay.

1548
01:29:34,281 --> 01:29:37,459
I was nervous
my first time voting.

1549
01:29:37,589 --> 01:29:40,636
[David] Do you feel like your
vote's making a difference?
This, like...

1550
01:29:40,766 --> 01:29:46,250
[Austin] Well, not necessarily
my vote, but the collection
of votes this year,

1551
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,034
I think, is gonna
make a difference.

1552
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:51,516
[David] Show me
what you got, Austin.

1553
01:29:51,647 --> 01:29:53,997
[Austin] A sticker.
Voted, first time.

1554
01:29:55,302 --> 01:29:57,479
[Jaclyn]
How's it looking so far?

1555
01:29:57,609 --> 01:29:59,655
Well, Iowa looks good.

1556
01:29:59,785 --> 01:30:02,353
The margins are huge
compared to like Clinton's.

1557
01:30:02,484 --> 01:30:04,964
[man] You're seeing
the map right now that's gonna
make democrats nervous.

1558
01:30:05,095 --> 01:30:07,184
If you look
at this map right now,
the name of the game,

1559
01:30:07,314 --> 01:30:09,404
if you're Joe Biden,
is takeaway because
Donald Trump,

1560
01:30:09,534 --> 01:30:11,667
the incumbent president,
who won last time...

1561
01:30:11,797 --> 01:30:14,365
-[David] How's it going so far?
-I don't know.

1562
01:30:14,496 --> 01:30:16,367
[light guitar music]

1563
01:30:16,498 --> 01:30:20,284
-Feels a little,
like, a bit like 2016.
-[Jaclyn] Mmm, no...

1564
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,981
This feeling in my stomach,
it does.

1565
01:30:22,112 --> 01:30:23,940
[Raquel] Yeah, I feel that.

1566
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:27,465
I feel like I'm gonna
wake up tomorrow
and it's gonna be...

1567
01:30:27,596 --> 01:30:29,641
[music continues]

1568
01:30:36,126 --> 01:30:39,738
[man 1]
Joe Biden has vaulted into
the lead in the crucial

1569
01:30:39,869 --> 01:30:42,349
swing state of Michigan,
you can see it right there.

1570
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,657
[man 2]
If Joe Biden wins Georgia
or Pennsylvania,

1571
01:30:45,788 --> 01:30:50,009
there is no path
to 270 electoral votes
for President Trump.

1572
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:54,971
We are currently in day four
of election watching.

1573
01:30:55,101 --> 01:30:57,016
[music continues]

1574
01:30:59,323 --> 01:31:01,891
-[cat meows]
-[David] Raquel wants
to talk to you.

1575
01:31:02,021 --> 01:31:03,414
Mike. Boo!

1576
01:31:04,676 --> 01:31:05,721
Come on... [mumbles]

1577
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:07,766
[Raquel] Pennsylvania!

1578
01:31:07,897 --> 01:31:09,942
[Jaclyn]
Finally! God!

1579
01:31:11,248 --> 01:31:12,771
Joe Biden's president.

1580
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:14,469
[Jaclyn] Oh, my God.

1581
01:31:15,513 --> 01:31:18,516
What a long four years.

1582
01:31:18,647 --> 01:31:20,692
[Raquel laughs]
What a long four days.

1583
01:31:20,823 --> 01:31:23,434
[both laughing]

1584
01:31:23,565 --> 01:31:24,827
Oh...

1585
01:31:24,957 --> 01:31:28,352
[man shouting] No! No!

1586
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:31,529
-Get that on video.
-[David chuckles]

1587
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:33,705
[shouts] Fuck Joe!

1588
01:31:33,836 --> 01:31:36,229
And they already know
how we think.

1589
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,362
I guess
if you're gonna make a stand
and make this film,

1590
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,583
then you gotta...
stand by it.

1591
01:31:41,713 --> 01:31:43,889
I know times
have been challenging,

1592
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:46,631
especially the last
several months.

1593
01:31:46,762 --> 01:31:50,417
But we've also witnessed
your courage,

1594
01:31:50,548 --> 01:31:55,379
your resilience,
and the generosity
of your spirit.

1595
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,948
And the road ahead
will not be easy,

1596
01:31:59,078 --> 01:32:01,907
-but America is ready.
-[crowd cheering]

1597
01:32:02,038 --> 01:32:04,780
Because we, the people,

1598
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:08,697
-have the power
to build a better future.
-[Jaclyn] Whoo!

1599
01:32:10,568 --> 01:32:13,963
-[woman] Yeah! Wow.
-All right, ladies
and gentlemen.

1600
01:32:27,063 --> 01:32:29,631
-[phone dings]
-[Rachel] How'd you like to stay
in that motel, David?

1601
01:32:29,761 --> 01:32:34,287
-[David] Nope.
-[Rachel] That's been there
since I was a little girl.

1602
01:32:34,418 --> 01:32:36,376
[emotional piano music]

1603
01:32:52,697 --> 01:32:56,266
[Chun] Well, Mom, we miss you
every day.

1604
01:32:56,396 --> 01:32:59,225
[music continues]

1605
01:32:59,356 --> 01:33:00,705
Been, uh...

1606
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:04,361
dreaming about you.

1607
01:33:04,491 --> 01:33:06,972
So I thought it was
a really pleasant dream.

1608
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,062
And, uh, when we drive by today,

1609
01:33:10,193 --> 01:33:13,239
I just wanted to come visit.

1610
01:33:15,328 --> 01:33:16,808
Come to visit you.

1611
01:33:21,073 --> 01:33:22,335
I miss you.

1612
01:33:26,818 --> 01:33:28,037
Miss you.

1613
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:30,605
-[music continues]
-[indistinct chatter]

1614
01:33:36,306 --> 01:33:39,614
This is the mom that brought
all six of her children

1615
01:33:39,744 --> 01:33:43,313
out of the Killing Field
in Cambodia.

1616
01:33:43,443 --> 01:33:45,620
It's incredible woman.

1617
01:33:52,844 --> 01:33:54,629
She is incredible.

1618
01:34:00,286 --> 01:34:01,940
[dramatic music]

1619
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,207
-[David] Can you read that?
-Mmm...

1620
01:34:08,338 --> 01:34:11,515
Yeah.
Where did you find this?

1621
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,692
It was under
a bunch of old photos.

1622
01:34:14,823 --> 01:34:17,390
[Jaclyn] Come here.
[exclaims, grunts]

1623
01:34:17,521 --> 01:34:20,219
David,
whenever I talk about Ma,
I cry, like, instantly.

1624
01:34:21,481 --> 01:34:24,571
"Dear Ma, I guess
first and foremost,

1625
01:34:24,702 --> 01:34:28,053
I miss you more than anyone
could ever imagine.

1626
01:34:28,184 --> 01:34:29,794
[voice breaking]
I can't believe that
it's already been

1627
01:34:29,925 --> 01:34:32,710
a little over four years
since you died.

1628
01:34:32,841 --> 01:34:34,277
Often you come
to me in my dreams,

1629
01:34:34,407 --> 01:34:36,540
and I want to thank you
for that.

1630
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,455
Thank you for everything
you have done for me,

1631
01:34:38,585 --> 01:34:43,025
and I promise I'll continue
to try and make you proud.

1632
01:34:43,155 --> 01:34:45,549
Love always and forever."

1633
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:49,292
I can see a lot
of Ma in Baba, actually.

1634
01:34:49,422 --> 01:34:52,512
They both have
this strong will to survive

1635
01:34:52,643 --> 01:34:54,601
and keep going no matter what.

1636
01:34:55,864 --> 01:34:58,344
And I think that deep down
Baba knows

1637
01:34:58,475 --> 01:35:01,434
that me and him
are very much alike.

1638
01:35:02,305 --> 01:35:04,699
[David]
Do you think that
you and Baba are so similar

1639
01:35:04,829 --> 01:35:06,657
in so many ways
because of Ma?

1640
01:35:06,788 --> 01:35:10,530
I guess I never really
thought of that, honestly.
[chuckles]

1641
01:35:10,661 --> 01:35:13,098
That would make sense.

1642
01:35:13,229 --> 01:35:15,144
What do you think you learned
this past year?

1643
01:35:15,274 --> 01:35:18,277
[Jaclyn]
I don't think it's anything
that, like, I learned.

1644
01:35:18,408 --> 01:35:21,977
I think it just became
more, like, cemented.

1645
01:35:22,107 --> 01:35:25,284
I just know that I like
being around my family

1646
01:35:25,415 --> 01:35:27,896
all the time,
but that's not new news.

1647
01:35:28,026 --> 01:35:30,637
Like, I've always done this.
I've always, like...

1648
01:35:30,768 --> 01:35:32,814
Like, I just want to...

1649
01:35:34,467 --> 01:35:37,601
be there for as many moments
as I can.

1650
01:35:39,429 --> 01:35:41,518
[uplifting music]

1651
01:35:41,648 --> 01:35:42,780
[David grunts]

1652
01:35:45,304 --> 01:35:47,306
-What does it say?
-I don't know. Read it.

1653
01:35:47,437 --> 01:35:50,570
[laughs]
"David, ew, David."

1654
01:35:50,701 --> 01:35:52,790
-What does it say?
-What does yours say?

1655
01:35:52,921 --> 01:35:54,966
Kat, you can put yours on too.

1656
01:35:55,097 --> 01:35:56,489
[Kat] Just hold it up.

1657
01:35:57,882 --> 01:35:59,405
This is for Kat.

1658
01:36:07,152 --> 01:36:09,633
-Oh, my God.
-Read your shirt.
[chuckles]

1659
01:36:12,418 --> 01:36:14,377
-[sniffles]
-[laughs]

1660
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,208
[Jaclyn inhales]

1661
01:36:20,818 --> 01:36:23,429
-[Jaclyn] I promise--
-Oh, I just ruined
all my makeup.

1662
01:36:26,128 --> 01:36:29,261
Okay.
What do our shirts say?

1663
01:36:29,392 --> 01:36:33,788
-Cat mom, cat...
Dog mom, dog...
-[chuckles]

1664
01:36:35,528 --> 01:36:37,487
[Jaclyn giggles, laughs]

1665
01:36:37,617 --> 01:36:40,011
What does your shirt say?

1666
01:36:40,142 --> 01:36:42,361
[sobs] You swear to God?

1667
01:36:42,492 --> 01:36:44,581
Why would I lie?

1668
01:36:46,235 --> 01:36:47,323
[Raquel sniffles]

1669
01:36:47,453 --> 01:36:49,064
[Jaclyn chuckles]

1670
01:36:49,194 --> 01:36:50,674
[Raquel exclaims]

1671
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,719
[Jaclyn gasps, giggles]
Careful.

1672
01:36:53,764 --> 01:36:56,245
[Raquel sobbing, laughing]

1673
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:58,247
No way.

1674
01:37:01,903 --> 01:37:03,905
Are you serious?

1675
01:37:04,035 --> 01:37:05,820
She's for real?

1676
01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:07,996
Oh, my God.

1677
01:37:08,126 --> 01:37:10,955
-Oh, for real?
-[Jaclyn] Mm-hmm.

1678
01:37:13,653 --> 01:37:15,438
[music continues]

1679
01:37:22,662 --> 01:37:24,273
I hope you're ready
for this, babe.

1680
01:37:30,627 --> 01:37:32,890
Wha?!

1681
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:35,240
[sobbing, laughing]

1682
01:37:35,371 --> 01:37:37,547
[screams] What?!

1683
01:37:37,677 --> 01:37:41,203
Ah! [hyperventilates]

1684
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:43,466
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

1685
01:37:43,596 --> 01:37:46,208
-[screams]
-[Jaclyn laughs]

1686
01:37:47,296 --> 01:37:50,647
-[Rachel inhales, exhales]
-"Mommy and Daddy
are get us

1687
01:37:50,777 --> 01:37:55,565
-a human baby."
-[Rachel laughs]

1688
01:37:55,695 --> 01:37:57,697
[music continues]

1689
01:38:03,529 --> 01:38:05,531
[Rachel cries, laughs]

1690
01:38:20,764 --> 01:38:22,026
[sniffles]

1691
01:38:25,682 --> 01:38:28,641
-[Chun] I love you.
-[Jaclyn] I love you too.
[chuckles]

1692
01:38:31,862 --> 01:38:33,733
-[sniffling]
-[Chun] Mm.

1693
01:38:38,651 --> 01:38:40,523
[David]
One, two, three, four.

1694
01:38:40,653 --> 01:38:44,005
[upbeat guitar music]

1695
01:38:49,314 --> 01:38:53,014
[singing "Champa Battambang"]

1696
01:39:13,077 --> 01:39:16,428
Can I get two calamari,
a fish and chips,

1697
01:39:16,559 --> 01:39:18,256
and seafood bowl?

1698
01:39:19,692 --> 01:39:21,694
[music continues]

1699
01:39:25,089 --> 01:39:27,135
And order up! Pickup!

1700
01:39:27,265 --> 01:39:29,920
[singing continues]

1701
01:39:38,276 --> 01:39:41,888
-[Raquel shouting indistinctly]
-[singing continues]

1702
01:39:50,506 --> 01:39:52,725
Well, baby,
we're waiting for you.

1703
01:39:52,856 --> 01:39:54,684
You're in there right now.

1704
01:39:54,814 --> 01:39:56,381
[Raquel] You're coming down
the birth canal.

1705
01:39:56,512 --> 01:39:58,949
You're coming down
the birth canal, and, uh...

1706
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:01,996
-honestly,
we can't wait to meet you.
-Jaclyn! Jaclyn! Jaclyn!

[all cheering and whooping]

1711
01:40:16,358 --> 01:40:19,361
[Rachel]
Oh, look at her eyes.
They're really cool.

1712

-Hi.
-Hi, beautiful.
