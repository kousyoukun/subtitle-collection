Here's the plan.

297
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:00,729
We're gonna drop you into
Northern Afghanistan.

298
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:03,300
There, you will meet up
with a CIA operative

299
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:05,301
who will take you to Dostum.

300
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:07,003
Your mission,

301
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:09,071
earn Dostum's trust,

302
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,873
embed with his militia,

303
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,911
you fight alongside him while he makes
his way to Taliban strongholds.

304
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:17,379
When you get there, you call in
for close air support strikes.

305
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:18,714
Dostum will do the rest.

306
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:21,184
One by one,
stronghold by stronghold,

307
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:24,220
until he takes Mazar,
and the Taliban falls.

308
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:26,388
You got six weeks.

309
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,291
I'd say three weeks, sir.

310
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:30,759
- God damn it.
- No, no.

311
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:33,061
All right, I'll bite.

312
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:34,797
Why three?

313
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,032
The Russians have been here before, right?
They've done this.

314
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,401
And they wrote about it.

315
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:39,969
They said the snow
was shutting down

316
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,772
all the mountain passes
by mid-November.

317
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:44,741
Every year, without fail.

318
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,542
Now, if the Russians are
talking about a bad winter,

319
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:48,677
it's usually worth
paying attention to, isn't it?

320
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,214
After three weeks,
we will not get into Mazar.

321
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:55,651
That snow will hit, the Taliban will
dig in, and my men won't come home.

322
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:58,421
Your air support comes
from B-52s at 35,000 feet.

323
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:00,757
How do you think you're gonna
get close enough to be accurate

324
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,191
without parking a bomb
in your lap?

325
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:03,693
I'll have to get
out of the way, sir.

is cushion for your fuck-ups.

328
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:09,365
There won't be any fuck-ups.
Three weeks is all we need.

329
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:12,536
Pretty confident for a guy
who's never done this before.

330
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:13,969
Never been to war.

331
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,739
I don't see that
as a disadvantage, sir.

332
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:18,708
Well, maybe you should
explain that.

333
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,812
We're teaming up with a warlord
that we know nothing about.

334
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:24,213
We're not gonna be able to tell
our enemies from our allies.

335
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:28,316
Every step we take is gonna be on a
minefield from a hundred different wars.

336
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,353
And no one's ever called in a
smart bomb airstrike from a B-52.

337
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,724
So anyone who tells you
they've done this before

338
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:35,792
or has experience in this
is lying, sir.

339
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:39,296
There's no playbook here. We're
gonna have to write it ourselves.

340
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,565
I briefed five potential
captains for this mission.

341
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:47,539
About a hundred years of military
experience between them.

342
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:53,042
But you're the only one
that sees it the way it is.

343

345
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:01,284
I would be remiss
if I did not say to you,

346
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:03,486
even in success

347
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:04,953
the odds of you coming home...

348

They're 100%, sir,
with all due respect.

349
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,593
See, I kind of made
a promise, too.

Hmm.

It's a hell of a thing
we do, isn't it?

and leave them to go to war?

take into combat is a reason why.

According to Spencer,

883
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,782
the horses aren't
just transportation.

884
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:44,985
Spencer says Dostum
relies on them for combat.

885

890
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,708
Those are the Taliban forces
outside of Bescham.

891
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,844
Right. Okay, General,
let me explain how this works.

892
00:50:09,846 --> 00:50:12,579
I need to be close enough to give the
exact coordinates and elevation.

893
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:13,914
It's too dangerous.

894
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,316
General, we're too far away.

895
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:16,717
I can't call in anything
from here.

896
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:19,052
500 of my men can die

897
00:50:19,054 --> 00:50:22,490
before one American gets
a scratch. You know why?

898
00:50:22,492 --> 00:50:23,758
No, why, sir?

899
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,659
Because if one American die,

900
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,429
your government leaves,
and then we lose the war.

901

the bombs, I do.

903
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,137

can't call in the exact location.

through Tiangi Gap.

1173
01:08:52,935 --> 01:08:55,001
Out here, there's nothing.

1174
01:08:55,003 --> 01:08:58,571
No passage, no water.
No shade.

1175
01:08:58,573 --> 01:09:01,273
So the only way
to Mazar-i-Sharif

1176
01:09:01,275 --> 01:09:03,375
is through Tiangi Gap.

1177
01:09:03,377 --> 01:09:04,878
That's a choke point.

1178
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,280
That's the only way.

1179
01:09:07,282 --> 01:09:08,682
So, for us to take Mazar,

1180
01:09:08,684 --> 01:09:10,250
- we'll have to beat him in this Gap.
- Yes.

1181
01:09:10,252 --> 01:09:13,553
To get access to their
stronghold in Tiangi,

1182
01:09:13,555 --> 01:09:15,891
we must first take Bescham.

1183
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:20,994
You know, you have the sky,

1184

but wars are won in the dirt.

1185
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:27,768
I knew
about their supply line.

1186
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:30,172
But I didn't expect
their weapons.

1187
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,277
Fakir was my godson.

1188
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:38,812
Every time you lose a man,

1189
01:09:38,814 --> 01:09:40,950
it's like a stab
in your heart.

1190
01:09:43,152 --> 01:09:46,986
And my heart is butchered,
my friend.

1191
01:09:46,988 --> 01:09:50,125
Don't think I send my men
out there to die.

is hold him off long enough
