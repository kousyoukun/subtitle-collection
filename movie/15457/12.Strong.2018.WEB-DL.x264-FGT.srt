<i>February 1993.</i>

2
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:03,733
<i>A massive explosion</i>

3
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:05,469
<i>ripping through
the lower basement sections</i>

4
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:08,305
<i>of the World Trade Center
under tower number two.</i>

5
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:11,607
<i>A terrorist bomb,
how horrific a crime this is.</i>

6
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,544
<i>August 1998.</i>

7
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:17,347
<i>Our embassies in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam were bombed.</i>

8
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:20,785
<i>The Bin Laden terrorist
network was responsible.</i>

9
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:22,619
<i>Suicide bombers
blew a hole in the ship.</i>

10
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:24,621
<i>My prayers are with the
families of those killed...</i>

11
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:28,192
<i>at the explosion involving
the U.S. naval vessel</i> Cole.

12
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:30,895
<i>Hidden in
the mountains of Afghanistan,</i>

13
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:32,630
<i>Bin Laden planned
these attacks.</i>

14
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:34,665
<i>September 9th, 2001.</i>

15
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,100
<i>Ahmad Shah Massoud,</i>

16
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:37,868
<i>the leader
of the Northern Alliance,</i>

17
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,770
<i>was assassinated by
two members of Al-Qaeda.</i>

18
00:01:39,772 --> 00:01:43,341
<i>Massoud's death
destabilized the Northern Alliance,</i>

19
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:44,874
<i>removing the only threat</i>

20
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:46,844
<i>to the Taliban's power
in Afghanistan.</i>

21
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,097
I can't believe
we have a fireplace.

22
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,567
Yeah. Sort of a fireplace.
It's propane.

23
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:11,971
It's a fireplace.

24
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:14,106
Maddy?

25
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:20,578
All right. Up you go.

26
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,949
Okay. Let's get your shoes on.

27
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,416
Hey, I like your drawings.

28
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:26,684
It's a ladybug.

29
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:28,918
A ladybug?
Wow, it's beautiful.

30
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,088
I don't wanna
unpack this room

31
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,655
until we get
the walls painted.

32
00:02:32,657 --> 00:02:34,691
And by "we," I mean you.

33
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,193
Sounds like a lot of work.

34
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:38,963
Yeah, what does that mean?

35
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:41,600
Paint the walls
and I'll show you.

36
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:44,201
I love this house.

37
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:46,270
You gotta learn
Spanish, Daddy.

38
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:48,305
Yeah, it's on the list,
sweetie.

39
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:50,375
You taking me to school again?

40
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:52,643
Uh-huh. And picking you up.

41
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:53,844
- Really?
- Yeah!

42
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:55,247
Turn that down, sweetie.

43
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:02,786
Daddy, look.

44
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:05,356
<i>Two planes have crashed
into the World Trade Center</i>

45
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:08,125
<i>in an apparent terrorist
attack on the country.</i>

46
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:10,427
<i>We have reported
that one of the planes</i>

47
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:14,266
<i>was an American Airlines 767
that had been hijacked...</i>

48
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,588
- Hey!
- Thank God! Finally.

49
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,888
Okay!

50
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:46,700
Really? Really?

51
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,967
- What the hell, man?
- Relax, bro.

52
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:52,036
- You know how nuts traffic is right now.
- Traffic?

53
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:53,738
We've been freezing our asses
out here all goddamn night!

54
00:03:53,763 --> 00:03:54,304
Relax, bro.

55
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:55,805
Why don't you jump your ass
in this river?

56
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:57,441
What, did you stop
at Starbucks?

57
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:59,143
- Where's my latte?
- Milo, it's 8:30.

58
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:01,211
- What happened?
- What, you guys don't know?

59
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:03,049
No, we were
in the river, man.

60
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,788
Goddamn, they're low.

61
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,158
Is that part of a drill?

62
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,395
Ain't no drill.

63
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,936
Get me Josh Bailey
at USASOC intel, please.

64
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,140
Bailey on line three, sir.

65
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:31,541
- Did you say line three?
- Yes, sir.

66
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:34,644
Sound off!

67
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:38,149
Josh, Jesus Christ, you guys
shit the bed on this one, huh?

68
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:39,817
Was it confirmed?

69
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:42,786
Well, it's not my job to know where.
That's your job.

70
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:44,255
All we are is ready.

71
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:46,856
Well, quit wasting time
talking to me then.

72
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,593
Why are you here?
Out of uniform

73
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:50,226
with that fur on your face.

74
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,195
Didn't you get back from
Kuwait, like, three weeks ago?

75
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:53,964
Yes, sir. Apologies.
Technically, I'm still on leave.

76
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:55,666
Well, if you're here today,
leave is over.

77
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:57,935
Take a look around, Captain.
We're a little busy.

78
00:04:57,937 --> 00:04:59,070
What do you want?

79
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:00,937
I want back on my team, sir.

80
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,173
You don't have a team. You've
been rotated to my staff.

81
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:04,574
At your request, by the way.

82
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:06,176
That was before. All right?

83
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:08,178
Before guys were flying
fucking planes into buildings.

84
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,815
Well, your warrant officer
turned in his retirement papers,

85
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:12,250
and you've been moved up.

86
00:05:12,252 --> 00:05:14,384
So your team doesn't exist,
all right?

87
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:17,921
You'll be filtered into new ODAs
when the opportunities arise.

88
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:19,356
If I were you,
I'd get back to your desk

89
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:21,192
and start studying intel
on Afghanistan.

90
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:23,627
Taliban sponsored
the attack, sir?

91
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:24,961
Al-Qaeda planned this attack.

92
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:26,397
They have refuge
in Afghanistan.

93
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,231
But Middle East is our
assigned region, sir.

94
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,233
Really? I didn't know that!

95
00:05:30,235 --> 00:05:31,969
Here's the thing, though.
You don't have a region,

96
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:33,570
'cause you don't have
a fucking team!

97
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:36,307
So get back to your goddamn
desk and let me do my job!

98
00:05:36,309 --> 00:05:37,507
Fuck.

99
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,442
Sergeant,
who's on line four?

100
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:42,312
<i>It was not long
before that tower collapsed.</i>

101
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:45,683
<i>The loss of life so far
is catastrophic,</i>

102
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:48,017
<i>estimated at 10,000.</i>

103
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,921
<i>But that number
could go much higher.</i>

104
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:52,824
<i>These images from just across</i>

105
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:54,892
<i>the Potomac River
of the Pentagon,</i>

106
00:05:54,894 --> 00:05:58,961
<i>still on fire, a fire
burning out of control</i>

107
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:01,098
<i>after a hijacked airliner,
another one,</i>

108
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,402
<i>we believe this one to have
been a United Airlines flight,</i>

109
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:07,605
<i>smashed into the Pentagon
around 9:45...</i>

110
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:08,872
Yo. What's up, Cap?

111
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:09,973
- What up, Milo?
- What are you doing here?

112
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:11,408
Trying to get my team back.

113
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,043
Ah, your little jalapeño
ain't gonna be too happy

114
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:14,411
- about that, huh?
- Yeah, maybe not.

115
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:15,978
What are you
talking about?

116
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,748
This team's done.
And thanks to you,

117
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,384
we're gonna be watching this whole
thing go down on fucking CNN.

118
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:22,118
What I did,
I did for my family.

119
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,887
I didn't know there was
a goddamn war coming.

120
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,856
Oh, buddy, you and your
family, you're gonna be fine.

121
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:27,457
From your cushy little office,
you're gonna be fucking fine!

122
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,959
You think I'm gonna be
sitting on the sidelines

123
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:31,262
with this shit happening,
Dill? Huh?

124
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:33,029
Did you talk
to Bowers?

125
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:35,502
Yeah, I did. I told him I
want back in and he said no.

126
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:38,334
He won't say no to me.

127
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:40,803
Tell me you didn't submit
that paperwork.

128
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:41,906
No, it's on my desk.

129
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:43,143
Good.

130
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,743
If anybody
in the Middle East did this,

131
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:49,346
the Fifth Group's up.

132
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:53,017
Fuck yeah, bro. Fuck yeah.
I mean, we would have been.

133
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,685
If we had a fucking captain.

134
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:58,358
We'll be in this fight, boys.
You mark my words.

135
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:07,533
He's in a meeting, sir.
It's a private meeting, sir.

136
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,992
Your retirement papers?

137
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:37,293
There's nothing
to submit, sir.

138
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:40,998
I'm still Chief Warrant
Officer of ODA 595,

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,033
and my team has
more combat experience

140
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:45,435
than the rest
of Fifth Group combined.

141
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:48,007
All that hell we went through
in Somalia, Desert Storm,

142
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,675
that means somethin'.

143
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:53,409
You break this team up,

144
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:55,314
you're cutting the head off
your most venomous snake, sir.

145
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:58,281
Yeah.

146
00:07:58,283 --> 00:07:59,515
Okay.

147
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:01,118
I'll pull you a captain
and get you in the game.

148
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,553
We have a captain, sir.

149
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:04,755
You have a captain
with no combat experience.

150
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:06,123
He's never been to war.

151
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,524
He's only led you in training.

152
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:09,192
He's already been
bumped up to staff.

153
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:10,594
This is a career wrecker.

154
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,062
You understand that, right?

155
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:14,264
Well, all due respect,
I've spent two years

156
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:16,832
with that fellow
leadin' our team.

157
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,536
If you think furthering
his career is why he joined,

158
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:22,474
you need to get to know
your captain, sir.

159
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:29,015
As you were.

160
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:35,352
- Sorry about the desk.
- No, no. It's a good kill.

161
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:37,924
Besides, you're not gonna
need it where you're going.

162
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:55,008
Special Forces
doesn't have thermals?

163
00:08:56,475 --> 00:08:58,441
Army wasn't expecting this.

164
00:08:58,443 --> 00:08:59,410
Yeah.

165
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,514
Well, that makes two of us.

166
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,023
You tell him. I'm not doing
your dirty work for you.

167
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:12,325
Marsha.

168
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:17,529
I'll love you
when you get back.

169
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,143
Hey, buddy.

170
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:32,344
Leaving?

171
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,345
Yeah, I gotta go.

172
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:37,015
How long?

173
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:39,953
Don't know.

174
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:44,957
Hey.

175
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,029
You know I love you, right?

176
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:10,247
Wow.

177
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:11,949
Made it all the way
to the oven, huh, babe?

178
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:14,551
Some wives cry, I clean.

179
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:17,621
Hey, uh,
I was thinking...

180
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,723
You're gonna have
all the time in the world

181
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:22,258
to clean that oven
once I'm gone.

182
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,994
And I'm kind of running
out of time. So...

183
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:28,632
Yeah, and I bet I know
just how you wanna spend it.

184
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:31,334
I mean, I have two hours.
I'll be really quick.

185
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:33,337
- Super quick.
- Uh-huh, yeah, not a chance.

186
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:34,637
Holding out is the only way

187
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,473
I can guarantee
you come back to me.

188
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:38,407
- Please?
- Mmm-mmm.

189
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,176
- Just the tip.
- Mmm-mmm.

190
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,347
- Okay, you know what?
- Mmm-hmm.

191
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:44,748
War's gonna be over so quick.

192
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,416
It's gonna be over
in like a week.

193
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,620
I promise.

194
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:52,155
Go wake up the kids.

195
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:54,424
Spend the time with them.

196
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:57,497
I know what I signed up for.
They don't.

197
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:28,060
Don't wish for what
you don't want.

198
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:35,699
You were on a flight
to New York two months ago.

199
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:39,069
You don't have
to justify it to me.

200
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:41,939
I'm a soldier's wife.

201
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,474
And I've been lucky.

202
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:47,509
All I've had
to worry about so far

203
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:50,546
is malaria
and chopper crashes.

204
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:53,251
Most dangerous part's
the ride in and out.

205
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,522
Not anymore.

206
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:04,026
I don't care
how long you're gone

207
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:06,466
as long as you come back.

208
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:09,967
You understand?

209
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,838
Yeah, I do.

210
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:18,775
Then say you're coming home.

211
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:21,614
I can't, baby.
It's bad luck.

212
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:29,254
I need to hear you say it.

213
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:34,360
I'm comin' home.

214
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:07,690
Hey, ODA 595.
Where do we bunk?

215
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:09,392
Uh, you see
those Quonset huts?

216
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:10,660
Those are for the teams.

217
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:12,697
ODA numbers
are on the door, sir.

218
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:15,598
Don't salute in country.

219
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,367
Are you trying to get
our captain killed, bro?

220
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,969
These are all friendlies.

221
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:20,337
Oh, yeah?

222
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,205
Who, that guy?
That's not my friend.

223
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:24,141
And that guy's
definitely not my friend.

224
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:25,574
Fucking Diller, bro.

225
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:27,176
I could be their friend.
He looks nice.

226
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:28,311
That guy?

227
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:29,615
Yeah.

228
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:32,416
Heads up. Heads up.

229
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:36,886
What's up, guys? Looks like
Christmas came early, huh?

230
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:39,522
Oh, yeah. Ho, ho, ho.
Where have you guys been?

231
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:41,358
Oh, we went to
a fucking Nickelback concert.

232
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,193
How was it?
Throw your panties on stage?

233
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:45,395
Nah, nah, nah, we got stuck
in a holding position

234
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:46,963
- till the weather broke.
- From what I hear,

235
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:48,598
the weather here
doesn't change until June.

236
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,199
Snowed last night.
So get used to it.

237
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,533
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

238
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:53,070
Hey, what's all this?

239
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:55,539
Someone gave the quartermaster
a Gold Card.

240
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,640
Now, the only unit

241
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:59,810
with any cold weather tac-gear is the
10th Mountain. They ain't sharing.

242
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:01,512
Make sure
everyone carries a GPS.

243
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,512
I couldn't find one topo map
of this place.

244
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:04,405
Copy that, Captain.

245
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,749
Hey, look what 515 left
outside their tents.

246
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:09,386
Hey, guys, quiet down.
Oh, it's Britney Spears!

247
00:14:09,388 --> 00:14:10,787
Five months in country,

248
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:12,589
this hair is what
you're getting, man.

249
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:13,991
Hey, man. Is that a wig?
Can I touch it? Just one time.

250
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:16,693
Ask Coffers' wife, man.
She loves it.

251
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:18,161
Oh!

252
00:14:18,163 --> 00:14:20,497
Cap said grow it out, guys.
What happened? What happened?

253
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:23,668
Whoa! Whoa! Be careful!
Vern knows Krav Maga!

254
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:26,603
Don't even think about...

255
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:35,378
All right, pencils down.

256
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,381
The other five teams
have been interviewed.

257
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:41,017
And, Cap, we're all countin'
on you, so, you know,

258
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,252
- no pressure.
- Thanks, buddy.

259
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:44,554
See you soon, boys.

260
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:47,526
Yep. Give 'em hell, Cap.

261
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,964
Bin Laden has been financing
the Taliban and Al-Qaeda,

262
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:59,502
setting up terrorist training
camps all over Afghanistan.

263
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,905
He's had one big win
on U.S. soil.

264
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:03,674
He wants another.

265
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:06,542
And if we don't stop him,
there will be more.

266
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:09,747
Bin Laden might be the brains,
but make no mistake about it,

267
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:13,182
in Afghanistan,
the Taliban is the muscle.

268
00:15:13,184 --> 00:15:15,685
If we remove them
from power,

269
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,954
he can't use them
to make his attacks.

270
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:19,823
Mazar-i-Sharif.

271
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:22,493
Whoever controls that city,
controls Afghanistan.

272
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,761
If we take Mazar
from the Taliban,

273
00:15:24,763 --> 00:15:27,397
then we cripple Bin Laden.

274
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,699
Well, that's half-right.

275
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:31,033
If you're gonna interrupt me,

276
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:33,237
you should probably
be entirely right.

277
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,738
No, we aren't taking anything.

278
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,208
The man who's gonna take Mazar
is named General Dostum.

279
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,777
He's an Afghan warlord
with the Northern Alliance.

280
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,513
He has the troops, he has the
intel, he knows the cliffs.

281
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:46,583
He knows every cave
and most importantly,

282
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:48,518
he does not care
for the Taliban.

283
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,322
So this is about airstrikes?

284
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:53,055
Sorry, sir.

285
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,556
No, you nailed that one.

286
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:57,127
Dostum cannot take out
the Taliban by himself.

287
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:58,561
Here's the plan.

288
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:00,729
We're gonna drop you into
Northern Afghanistan.

289
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:03,300
There, you will meet up
with a CIA operative

290
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:05,301
who will take you to Dostum.

291
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:07,003
Your mission,

292
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:09,071
earn Dostum's trust,

293
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,873
embed with his militia,

294
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,911
you fight alongside him while he makes
his way to Taliban strongholds.

295
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:17,379
When you get there, you call in
for close air support strikes.

296
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:18,714
Dostum will do the rest.

297
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:21,184
One by one,
stronghold by stronghold,

298
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:24,220
until he takes Mazar,
and the Taliban falls.

299
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:26,388
You got six weeks.

300
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,291
I'd say three weeks, sir.

301
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:30,759
- God damn it.
- No, no.

302
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:33,061
All right, I'll bite.

303
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:34,797
Why three?

304
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,032
The Russians have been here before, right?
They've done this.

305
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,401
And they wrote about it.

306
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:39,969
They said the snow
was shutting down

307
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,772
all the mountain passes
by mid-November.

308
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:44,741
Every year, without fail.

309
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,542
Now, if the Russians are
talking about a bad winter,

310
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:48,677
it's usually worth
paying attention to, isn't it?

311
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,214
After three weeks,
we will not get into Mazar.

312
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:55,651
That snow will hit, the Taliban will
dig in, and my men won't come home.

313
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:58,421
Your air support comes
from B-52s at 35,000 feet.

314
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:00,757
How do you think you're gonna
get close enough to be accurate

315
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,191
without parking a bomb
in your lap?

316
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:03,693
I'll have to get
out of the way, sir.

317
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:07,463
The extra three weeks
is cushion for your fuck-ups.

318
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:09,365
There won't be any fuck-ups.
Three weeks is all we need.

319
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:12,536
Pretty confident for a guy
who's never done this before.

320
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:13,969
Never been to war.

321
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,739
I don't see that
as a disadvantage, sir.

322
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:18,708
Well, maybe you should
explain that.

323
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,812
We're teaming up with a warlord
that we know nothing about.

324
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:24,213
We're not gonna be able to tell
our enemies from our allies.

325
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:28,316
Every step we take is gonna be on a
minefield from a hundred different wars.

326
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,353
And no one's ever called in a
smart bomb airstrike from a B-52.

327
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,724
So anyone who tells you
they've done this before

328
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:35,792
or has experience in this
is lying, sir.

329
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:39,296
There's no playbook here. We're
gonna have to write it ourselves.

330
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,565
I briefed five potential
captains for this mission.

331
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:47,539
About a hundred years of military
experience between them.

332
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:53,042
But you're the only one
that sees it the way it is.

333
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:57,080
I choose you.
You and 11 men.

334
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:58,815
Task Force Dagger.

335
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:01,284
I would be remiss
if I did not say to you,

336
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:03,486
even in success

337
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:04,953
the odds of you coming home...

338
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:08,225
They're 100%, sir,
with all due respect.

339
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,593
See, I kind of made
a promise, too.

340
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:11,961
You know better
than that, Nelson.

341
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:14,497
- What'd she get you to?
- Christmas.

342
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,032
Hmm.

343
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:18,401
It's a hell of a thing
we do, isn't it?

344
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:22,773
How do you love your family
and leave them to go to war?

345
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:26,543
You're wheels up at 2200.
Dismissed.

346
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:29,248
No, no. Knock that off. Go.

347
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,051
Captain.

348
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:38,923
The most important thing a man can
take into combat is a reason why.

349
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,258
This is from the towers.

350
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,161
You carry that with you.

351
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:49,232
Five weeks ago,
19 men attacked our country.

352
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:53,204
The 12 of you will be the
first ones to fight back.

353
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:56,372
Go win this thing.

354
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:58,143
Thank you, sir.

355
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:03,846
Yeah!

356
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:05,748
Son of a bitch.
We're the first ones in!

357
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,950
Yeah, it's kind of like
the Apollo program.

358
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:09,920
You know what they sent
into space first, right?

359
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:11,321
- What?
- A monkey.

360
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:12,455
Great.

361
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:14,824
But, listen, brother.

362
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:16,459
If it's six weeks,
it's six weeks, okay?

363
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:18,128
We can't rush this.

364
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,328
We're in harm's way
no matter what the weather.

365
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,266
If your only goal
is trying to keep us alive,

366
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:24,700
we're dead men for sure.

367
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:27,636
I ain't losing one man
on this team, Hal.

368
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:29,607
The only way home is winning.

369
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,375
Well, shit, I believe you.

370
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:36,645
Come on, let's tell the boys
we're up.

371
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:48,892
Oh, my God!

372
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:51,193
This woman
was stoned to death

373
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:53,063
for being pregnant
out of wedlock.

374
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:55,832
This is what the Taliban
does to women in Afghanistan.

375
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:58,634
Oh, God,
just shut that shit off.

376
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:00,170
It's what they gave us
for intel.

377
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:02,005
But that's not intel,
that's motivation.

378
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:03,606
And I got two towers
full of that.

379
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,275
Ah, you don't need
to study, Falls.

380
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:07,309
You just shoot the guy
shooting at you.

381
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:09,645
Oh, is that how that works? Thank
you very much, Mr. Wizard.

382
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:11,748
Hey, look, Michaels. It's you.

383
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,649
Jesus Christ,
you guys are jealous.

384
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:16,452
What do you call that? Is it
like a coif or something?

385
00:20:16,454 --> 00:20:18,654
- Guys. Guys, guys.
- I don't do bad hair.

386
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,657
Listen up!

387
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,094
All right, boys.

388
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,095
It's us, we're going in.

389
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:27,698
Yeah!

390
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,164
We beat out
the five other teams.

391
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,967
We're gonna drop in
behind enemy lines,

392
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:33,401
link up with a warlord
of the Northern Alliance,

393
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:35,036
General Abdul Dostum.

394
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:37,206
We'll assist him
in fighting the Taliban

395
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,910
and taking back the city
of Mazar-i-Sharif,

396
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:41,745
which happens to be
the stronghold and linchpin

397
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:43,947
for the entire
northern Taliban force.

398
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:46,149
Now if we don't take
that city,

399
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:47,784
the whole country
will turn into

400
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:49,451
a goddamn terrorist
training camp.

401
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:51,353
World Trade Center's
just the beginning.

402
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,189
They're not finished
with us yet.

403
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:56,058
The catch is,
we only have 21 days.

404
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,826
How many troops does he have?

405
00:20:57,828 --> 00:20:59,395
He's got about
200 paid soldiers

406
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:01,664
and an undetermined number
of part-time militia.

407
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,899
What about
the other side?

408
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:05,434
The other side
has about 50,000

409
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:07,003
Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters.

410
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:09,005
Missiles, armor, rockets,

411
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,806
mortars, machine guns.

412
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:12,374
We're outnumbered.

413
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:13,876
Just 5,000 to one.

414
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,411
It's what I call
a target-rich environment.

415
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:17,046
I kind of like those odds,
to be honest.

416
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:18,680
Now, gentlemen,

417
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:20,749
once we land, we're about
nine hours away from help.

418
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:24,088
Which effectively means it doesn't exist.
We're on our own.

419
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:27,391
We all need to understand

420
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:29,525
that capture is not
an option here.

421
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,827
We've all seen the intel
on what the Taliban does

422
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:33,830
to their prisoners, correct?

423
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:35,865
Those motherfuckers
will make you suffer.

424
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,792
Shit goes south, 
I'm dying with my boots on.

425
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:38,434
Amen.

426
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:40,170
- As am I.
- Hear, hear.

427
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:43,006
We go in tonight.
Single ship, no backup.

428
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:45,642
So police your gear,
get some rest.

429
00:21:45,644 --> 00:21:47,311
Had a successful test flight?

430
00:21:48,346 --> 00:21:50,348
We are the test flight.

431
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:38,995
If you die,

432
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:43,199
that's a letter you and your
wife are gonna wish you wrote.

433
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:47,136
I just made her
a promise I'm coming home.

434
00:22:47,138 --> 00:22:50,041
I ain't writing her a letter
that says I broke it.

435
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:11,827
We got one, two,

436
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,430
three, four,

437
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,599
five, six...

438
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:18,735
I guess that space suit
answers the question

439
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:20,670
about closing
the freaking doors.

440
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:22,205
What's your cruising altitude?

441
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:23,907
That's a good question.

442
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:25,941
Well, it must be
above 10,000 feet

443
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,611
if you're using O2.

444
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:29,546
Shit, the mountains we're
flying over are 10,000 feet.

445
00:23:29,548 --> 00:23:31,413
The sandstorms would
ruin the engines

446
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:33,582
and missiles have been fired
from the peaks.

447
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:35,418
Well, that puts us at 20.

448
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,953
You can't fly a Chinook
at 20,000 feet.

449
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:39,154
We're not gonna.

450
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:40,789
Flight altitude's 25.

451
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,091
Oh.

452
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:43,992
Well,
how's this thing take it?

453
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:45,460
We'll find out.

454
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:47,063
Is there O2 for my team?

455
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:48,597
We got masks in the
back, but they don't work.

456
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,100
Hell, ours didn't work
last flight.

457
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:51,433
This dipshit started
seeing bogeymen.

458
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,603
Almost crashed into
the damn mountain.

459
00:23:53,605 --> 00:23:56,405
Oh, shit.
We're gonna go hypoxic.

460
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:57,640
Not me.

461
00:23:57,642 --> 00:23:59,642
Keeping my eyes
on that fucker right there.

462
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:01,478
We're going to the clouds,
gentlemen.

463
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,680
No one's ever flown a chopper
this high this far.

464
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:06,248
Strap in tight!

465
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,985
- I've never been hypoxic before.
- Really?

466
00:24:08,987 --> 00:24:10,519
Oh, it's great.

467
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,287
All you do is faint.

468
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,789
Think of it as
a nine-hour nap.

469
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,191
It's not the going to sleep
that worries me.

470
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,694
It's the goddamn hangover
on the other side.

471
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:20,462
Yeah, baby!

472
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:22,515
Well, you know why the
Army uses Chinooks, right?

473
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,199
Why?

474
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:25,901
So we'll be good and mad
when we get into battle.

475
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,470
Yeah!

476
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:30,206
I know, man!
I'm a laugh factory!

477
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,278
Mission equipment
is set. EOS, flare, chaff.

478
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:37,281
595, we are clear for takeoff.

479
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,419
<i>Silver wings upon their chest</i>

480
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:44,586
<i>These are men</i>

481
00:24:44,588 --> 00:24:46,421
<i>America's best</i>

482
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:50,492
<i>One hundred men
we'll test today</i>

483
00:24:50,494 --> 00:24:54,663
<i>But only three win
the Green Beret</i>

484
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:25,094
<i>Hey, 595, this is 1213.</i>

485
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:27,231
<i>Visibility is deteriorating.</i>

486
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,576
<i>We're turning back,
blind alley.</i>

487
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:06,637
<i>Hang on! We're descending.</i>

488
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:10,340
On purpose?

489
00:26:10,342 --> 00:26:12,174
- <i>On purpose?</i>
- <i>Roger that.</i>

490
00:26:12,176 --> 00:26:14,209
- <i>Wheels down, two minutes.</i>
- Two minutes!

491
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:16,647
- Two minutes!
- Wake up!

492
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,523
Jock up, NODs on!

493
00:26:33,832 --> 00:26:36,097
<i>Right gunner has
landing area in sight.</i>

494
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,635
Going in hot.

495
00:26:38,804 --> 00:26:40,670
Here we go!

496
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:43,709
<i>Fifteen, ten, nine, eight.
Hold your forward.</i>

497
00:26:44,642 --> 00:26:46,077
<i>Bring it down.</i>

498
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:49,211
<i>Cleared on left,
cleared on right.</i>

499
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:51,145
<i>On five, four, three.
Ramps cleared down.</i>

500
00:26:51,147 --> 00:26:52,550
<i>Ramp, ramp, ramp.</i>

501
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:48,269
Hey. There.

502
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:49,671
See those two fellas?

503
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:51,673
Yeah.

504
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:53,742
- Is this our escort?
- No, I don't think so.

505
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,478
We're supposed to be
meeting a squad.

506
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,449
I don't think
these are our guys.

507
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:16,899
Shut them up.
We got company.

508
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:20,202
Shit!

509
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:22,206
Put your fucking
weapons down!

510
00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:24,474
Drop your weapons!

511
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:29,211
No! No! No! Friendlies!

512
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:30,481
Friendlies! Stand down!

513
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:32,716
All right, weapons down!

514
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:37,085
Let them up.
That's your fucking escort.

515
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:38,921
Let them up.

516
00:28:42,394 --> 00:28:44,559
We're sorry.

517
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,701
Right. Okay.

518
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,770
If you could just tell him
we apologize?

519
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:02,178
You team leader?

520
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,411
Yeah, I am. You guys are late.

521
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:05,346
Well, we're here now.

522
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:06,682
You don't speak Dari?

523
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:08,249
- Not at all.
- How's your Uzbek?

524
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:09,885
So-so.
My Russian's decent.

525
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:11,620
All right. Well, Russian
will get you through.

526
00:29:11,622 --> 00:29:13,122
We should move,
it's a long hike.

527
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:14,724
They dumped you in a bad spot.

528
00:29:14,726 --> 00:29:16,824
Let's go, grab your gear.
Let's move.

529
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:19,362
Hey!

530
00:29:19,364 --> 00:29:20,930
Back up! No! No!

531
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:22,230
Yo, yo, yo.

532
00:29:27,037 --> 00:29:28,673
Yeah, thank you.

533
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:05,941
This is it.

534
00:30:05,943 --> 00:30:07,977
They call it the Alamo.

535
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,510
Got you set up in here.

536
00:30:09,512 --> 00:30:11,279
Why don't you guys
take first watch.

537
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:13,516
Rotate every two hours.
Head on a swivel.

538
00:30:13,518 --> 00:30:15,386
- Roger that.
- On it.

539
00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:20,588
You know everyone died
in the Alamo, right?

540
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,927
I think you should
keep that to yourself.

541
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:30,165
Oh, this is great.

542
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:32,200
Yeah, this is gonna go over
real well in a Muslim country.

543
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:35,240
It ain't our job to choose
the gifts, man. It's yours.

544
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,239
Come on in.

545
00:30:38,241 --> 00:30:40,375
This is your new home.

546
00:30:40,377 --> 00:30:42,111
Hey, feel free to eat
any of that.

547
00:30:42,113 --> 00:30:44,380
The bread's good. I don't
know what this is,

548
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:46,114
but it's fucking great.

549
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:47,583
Give me the lay of the land.

550
00:30:47,585 --> 00:30:49,285
What kind of intel you got?

551
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:51,187
Well, here's what
I know, and it ain't much.

552
00:30:51,189 --> 00:30:52,621
What's left
of the Northern Alliance

553
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:54,990
is essentially
three separate militias.

554
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:57,092
All right? That are all
enemies with each other.

555
00:30:57,094 --> 00:31:00,062
General Dostum, General Atta,
and General Mohaqiq.

556
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:02,699
So you got a three-pronged
attack that doesn't communicate,

557
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:04,334
will not assist each other.

558
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:05,834
And if they meet
on the battlefield,

559
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:07,503
they'll probably stop fighting
the Taliban

560
00:31:07,505 --> 00:31:08,871
and start killing each other.

561
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:11,140
What about our contact,
General Dostum?

562
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:13,543
General Abdul Rashid Dostum.

563
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:15,812
Okay, he's Uzbek.

564
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:19,582
Started fighting the Russians
when he was 16. He's 55 now.

565
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:21,717
Yeah, we have his bio.
What's he like?

566
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:23,552
What's he like?

567
00:31:23,554 --> 00:31:26,088
Yeah, what's he like? His personality.
Angry, happy, sad?

568
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,422
He likes show tunes.

569
00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:28,958
He likes show tunes.
Great.

570
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,593
Look, I read people
for a living,

571
00:31:30,595 --> 00:31:32,327
and I can't get a bead
on this guy.

572
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:34,729
Okay? Only two things
I know for sure.

573
00:31:34,731 --> 00:31:38,033
He hates the Taliban and they
hate the shit out of him.

574
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:40,569
How worried should we be
about any of these guys

575
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:42,205
trying to sell us
to the Taliban?

576
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:45,141
Uh, I'd be pretty fucking
worried, if I was you.

577
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:46,507
Right.

578
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,443
- Does Dostum speak English?
- No.

579
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:50,446
He speaks Tajik.

580
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:51,947
He speaks Uzbek.

581
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:53,315
He speaks Dari.

582
00:31:53,317 --> 00:31:56,117
He speaks Pashtun, which is
what the Taliban speak.

583
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:59,188
And he speaks Russian.
So you got that going for ya.

584
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,655
Are you with us through this?

585
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:02,190
No, I'm leaving
right now.

586
00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:03,625
I got a 50 kilometer hike

587
00:32:03,627 --> 00:32:05,460
to give a bag of money
to another warlord.

588
00:32:05,462 --> 00:32:08,664
Who knows, maybe we'll see
each other on the battlefield.

589
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:09,931
If we do,

590
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:12,700
don't shoot the guy
in the backwards cap.

591
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:14,538
We'll keep that in mind.

592
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,308
God, that spook is cheery.

593
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,511
Yeah, runnin' around here
alone, setting this thing up?

594
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:25,646
Say one thing about him,

595
00:32:25,648 --> 00:32:27,718
he's got giant balls.

596
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:30,822
Hey.

597
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:34,155
- So where is he?
- Who?

598
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:36,691
- Dostum.
- No clue.

599
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,727
He knows
we're here though, right?

600
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:41,700
Whole fucking country knows
you're here.

601
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,801
Best of luck, Captain.

602
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:47,135
I mean it.

603
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:48,304
You too.

604
00:32:48,306 --> 00:32:49,973
Give 'em hell.

605
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:08,990
Come look at this.

606
00:33:08,992 --> 00:33:11,294
Graveyard of Empires,

607
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:14,263
and we're in it.

608
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:17,799
Shows you how unlucky it is
to write on that wall,

609
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:19,971
so no one better do it.

610
00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:30,312
Hey, Cap.

611
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:31,680
Get some rest, all right?

612
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:33,148
Something ain't right here.

613
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,183
Now, look.

614
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:38,019
This is about being smart,
not super human.

615
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:40,222
Yeah, I know, I know.

616
00:33:40,224 --> 00:33:42,593
I'm gonna take the next watch.

617
00:33:45,496 --> 00:33:47,363
Massoud.

618
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:50,634
When he died, the Northern
Alliance might have died with him.

619
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:15,059
Move! Move!

620
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:19,063
That Dostum?

621
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,392
General.

622
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:52,994
Peace be with you.

623
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,041
And what did he say?

624
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:08,179
He said it's good
to know the language of your enemies.

625
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:29,498
Am I doing this alone?

626
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,766
All right, let's go.

627
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:32,668
Looks like Spencer
got a promotion.

628
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,603
I guess he prefers brunettes.

629
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:36,974
Yeah, seems that way, huh?

630
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,761
All right, why don't we
give him the gift?

631
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:18,115
Mmm.

632
00:36:23,454 --> 00:36:24,987
What did he say?

633
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:26,822
I don't think
the horse feed's a big hit.

634
00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:29,992
- Well, that went over like a bag of shit.
- Mmm-hmm.

635
00:36:29,994 --> 00:36:31,963
You wanna try
the vodka, Captain?

636
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:40,038
General.

637
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:57,855
To our new American friends.

638
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:06,729
I hope they don't think
they win copying the Russians.

639
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:08,798
I was told
you didn't speak English.

640
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,903
I didn't speak to the man
who told you I don't.

641
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:15,403
Where are my bombs?

642
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:18,340
General, I have more bombs
than you could ever want.

643
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:21,077
- Could you show me the Taliban's location?
- Why the young one speak?

644
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,579
He's our captain, sir.

645
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:28,583
- Tell them to stand down.
- Hey, Diller.

646
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:39,128
General, I'm the captain.
This is my team.

647
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,164
You speak to me, all right?

648
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,166
- This is my country.
- I understand that.

649
00:37:44,168 --> 00:37:47,635
You own the land,
but we own the sky.

650
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,840
You want our bombs,
talk to me.

651
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:52,641
Okay.

652
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:54,608
We talk.

653
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,045
Why these men follow you?

654
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:00,081
I could ask you
the same question.

655
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,152
You don't want the answer.

656
00:38:03,353 --> 00:38:04,422
Look.

657
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:07,425
Look. Those eyes.

658
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:09,961
Killer eyes.

659
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:15,898
Those eyes.

660
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,367
Killer eyes.

661
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:20,603
Yes.

662
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:22,273
Killer eyes.

663
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,244
What did you kill?

664
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,211
You wanna see me kill?

665
00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:31,949
You take me to the Taliban,
I'll show you.

666
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:38,389
Okay. We go.

667
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,125
That was easy.

668
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:46,862
Buddy, you better check
that fucking swagger

669
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:48,764
before he sells us
to the highest bidder.

670
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:52,066
Listen, he needed to know how far
I can be pushed. Now he does.

671
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:54,204
Fucking killer's eyes.

672
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:01,111
General. General, how far
away is the Taliban?

673
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:06,148
Five hours.
I have horses for you.

674
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,436
There's only six. I need 12.
I got 12 men.

675
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:09,311
I have six.

676
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:12,655
Hey, Cap.

677
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:14,759
Looks like he's not done
pushing you.

678
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,392
I don't like
splitting up the team, Hal.

679
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:20,463
Well, it was bound to happen sooner
or later, might as well be now.

680
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:22,296
At least
he's willing to fight.

681
00:39:22,298 --> 00:39:25,103
I figured he'd just milk us
for supplies and money.

682
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:31,072
Can you show me on the map
exactly where we're going?

683
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:33,410
Cobaki. Over the mountains.

684
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,945
All right, Diller,
Coffers, Michaels,

685
00:39:37,947 --> 00:39:39,581
Bennett, Jackson,
you're with me.

686
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,086
Falls, Black, grab the
daypacks, extra ammo.

687
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,523
I took Dehi four days ago
from Taliban.

688
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:50,191
Mullah Razzan,
leader of the Taliban,

689
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:52,260
has a high price
on your heads.

690
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:56,164
100,000 US dollars
for your body.

691
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,833
50,000 for your
bloody uniforms.

692
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:00,170
That's it?

693
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:03,738
A little low.

694
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,240
Toss a little change out,
Taliban.

695
00:40:05,242 --> 00:40:07,175
Well,
look on the bright side.

696
00:40:07,177 --> 00:40:08,610
If his plan was to cash us in,

697
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:10,445
he'd find another
six horses for sure.

698
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:12,179
I guarantee it.

699
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:14,816
All right, who's ridden before?
Anyone?

700
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:16,351
Summer camp,
when I was nine.

701
00:40:16,353 --> 00:40:19,920
Cancun, spring break.
But I was pretty drunk.

702
00:40:19,922 --> 00:40:21,088
I can't ride for shit.

703
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,724
Okay,
so that's nobody.

704
00:40:22,726 --> 00:40:26,029
But, hey, this will be fun.
All right.

705
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:31,666
Okay, so a kick means "go."
This is the steering wheel.

706
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:33,233
Left to go left,

707
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:35,503
- right to go right. Pull back to stop.
- Okay.

708
00:40:35,505 --> 00:40:37,639
He's not waiting for us.
Saddle up.

709
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:39,608
I'll start
a supply chain, okay?

710
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,075
Schedule a drop.

711
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:42,510
Does it have a name?

712
00:40:42,512 --> 00:40:43,811
Request ammo
for Dostum's men.

713
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:45,213
I know,
but does it have a name?

714
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:46,414
And Michaels will be
on the radio.

715
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:47,949
We'll check in
every four hours.

716
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:49,083
He's gonna test you.

717
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:50,452
Yeah. I'm gonna test him, too.

718
00:40:50,454 --> 00:40:52,588
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

719
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,456
About to find out.

720
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:58,526
Oh, fuck. God damn it.

721
00:40:58,528 --> 00:40:59,894
Good luck, boys.

722
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:02,197
You guys look like
a bunch of naturals.

723
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,798
Don't break
the horse, Dill.

724
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,001
Shit.

725
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:30,173
I don't like how
they're looking at us, Cap.

726
00:44:31,742 --> 00:44:34,478
Cap, we got three AK's and
a spotter at three o'clock.

727
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,382
Yeah, I see it.

728
00:44:43,686 --> 00:44:45,186
What the fuck
are we stopping for?

729
00:44:45,188 --> 00:44:46,755
I don't know.

730
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:52,226
Supplies.

731
00:44:52,228 --> 00:44:54,028
Yeah, well,
we're sitting ducks here.

732
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,729
You gotta be
kidding me.

733
00:44:55,731 --> 00:44:58,432
Risking our asses
for 10 gallons of water.

734
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:00,469
No,
he's showing us off.

735
00:45:00,471 --> 00:45:02,204
He's saying,
"Look at the Americans.

736
00:45:02,206 --> 00:45:03,441
"They're here with me."

737
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:20,054
Hey, don't fucking look down!

738
00:45:20,056 --> 00:45:21,755
Where you look,
the horse goes.

739
00:45:21,757 --> 00:45:23,391
Move your head,
it shifts your weight

740
00:45:23,393 --> 00:45:25,793
and shifts the horse's weight.
Got it?

741
00:45:25,795 --> 00:45:27,597
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

742
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,385
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah.

743
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,086
He's got us on the north side
of this range.

744
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:54,454
I'm guessing that isn't good.

745
00:45:54,456 --> 00:45:56,258
No. Commo satellites orbit
to the south.

746
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,892
There's no way
I'm gonna get any signal

747
00:45:57,894 --> 00:45:59,293
through that mountain range.

748
00:45:59,295 --> 00:46:00,394
I'm gonna have to go up
on the plateau

749
00:46:00,396 --> 00:46:01,762
and try to get better contact.

750
00:46:01,764 --> 00:46:04,532
He's got us camping
in a dead spot.

751
00:46:04,534 --> 00:46:06,267
You think he knows
it's a dead spot?

752
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:10,070
I know every cell phone
dead zone in my hometown.

753
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:11,606
No GPS either, huh?

754
00:46:11,608 --> 00:46:13,911
No, it's pretty shitty.

755
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:22,416
Your men are too slow.

756
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:25,655
We will kill the Taliban
in the morning.

757
00:46:36,231 --> 00:46:38,032
I see you.

758
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:40,170
Yeah, I know it. I see that.

759
00:46:41,003 --> 00:46:42,869
That's a cool musket.

760
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:48,575
Najeeb? Cool, I'm gonna take
a piss now, so...

761
00:46:48,577 --> 00:46:51,916
No, no. No.
Like to do this alone, bro.

762
00:46:53,115 --> 00:46:55,318
Respect the culture.

763
00:46:56,619 --> 00:47:00,088
This fucking kid.

764
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,590
- Milo?
- What's up, bro?

765
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:04,892
Looks like you got a shadow.

766
00:47:04,894 --> 00:47:05,929
Yeah.

767
00:47:11,568 --> 00:47:13,868
You see Dostum's men 
ride up that mountain today?

768
00:47:13,893 --> 00:47:14,635
Yeah.

769
00:47:14,637 --> 00:47:18,206
Had his whole army ready
to travel in five minutes.

770
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:20,141
My guess is the Taliban
ain't much different.

771
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:21,476
It's not gonna be easy.

772
00:47:21,478 --> 00:47:23,612
Yeah,
these people are tough.

773
00:47:23,614 --> 00:47:24,981
How do you know
so much about horses?

774
00:47:26,548 --> 00:47:28,751
No, I grew up on a ranch.

775
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:31,420
Father taught me.

776
00:47:31,422 --> 00:47:33,255
About the only thing
he was ever good

777
00:47:33,257 --> 00:47:34,822
and gentle with were horses.

778
00:47:34,824 --> 00:47:36,590
So the old man
ruled with an iron fist?

779
00:47:36,592 --> 00:47:38,193
And a leather belt.

780
00:47:38,195 --> 00:47:40,061
- Anything he could get his hands on.
- Oh, yeah?

781
00:47:40,063 --> 00:47:41,929
Must have been best friends
with my old man.

782
00:47:41,931 --> 00:47:43,697
Oh, yeah?

783
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:46,834
I hope they let us see
this one through, you know?

784
00:47:46,836 --> 00:47:49,436
Afghanistan's been invaded
for the last 2,000 years

785
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:51,240
repeatedly by everyone.

786
00:47:51,242 --> 00:47:53,007
Genghis Khan,
Alexander the Great...

787
00:47:53,009 --> 00:47:54,742
You've been reading up
on the place?

788
00:47:54,744 --> 00:47:57,711
I was a history teacher.

789
00:47:57,713 --> 00:47:59,246
- Get the fuck out!
- No! I swear to God!

790
00:47:59,248 --> 00:48:00,447
- You serious?
- Yeah.

791
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:01,849
Shit, that's right.

792
00:48:01,851 --> 00:48:03,452
No, I remember
reading something about it.

793
00:48:03,454 --> 00:48:05,086
In your report.
It wasn't long though.

794
00:48:05,088 --> 00:48:07,322
What happened? I didn't...

795
00:48:07,324 --> 00:48:08,590
I got into a fight
with this guy

796
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:09,789
who was harassing
my girlfriend, you know.

797
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,691
And I kind of beat him up
pretty bad.

798
00:48:11,693 --> 00:48:13,594
And where I was headed,
I was headed to jail.

799
00:48:13,596 --> 00:48:16,367
So, I chose the military.

800
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:18,699
Shit, man.

801
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:21,269
And here you are years later
sitting in a cave.

802
00:48:21,271 --> 00:48:22,936
Yeah, I should have
chose jail.

803
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:27,275
Why do your men stand guard?

804
00:48:27,277 --> 00:48:30,077
You're my guests,
I protect you.

805
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,579
We're not just your guests,
General. We're your allies.

806
00:48:32,581 --> 00:48:34,315
My men aren't standing guard
against you.

807
00:48:34,317 --> 00:48:35,483
They're standing with you.

808
00:48:35,485 --> 00:48:37,151
This is my responsibility.

809
00:48:37,153 --> 00:48:40,755
This is how we're trained.
We have orders to follow.

810
00:48:40,757 --> 00:48:43,492
That's the difference
between you and me.

811
00:48:43,494 --> 00:48:46,126
You have many men over you.

812
00:48:46,128 --> 00:48:48,731
Over me, only God.

813
00:48:55,137 --> 00:48:58,773
God, that was, that was some
real bonding right there.

814
00:48:58,775 --> 00:49:00,009
Yeah.

815
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:07,280
Sir, sitrep from Spencer.

816
00:49:07,282 --> 00:49:10,217
He's requesting a supply drop
for Dostum's men.

817
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:13,021
Winter's coming, and they
need gear and provisions.

818
00:49:13,023 --> 00:49:14,854
Yeah, ship it out.
Where's Nelson?

819
00:49:14,856 --> 00:49:18,191
Not sure. Terrain's cutting
off radio reception.

820
00:49:18,193 --> 00:49:22,329
He thinks that Nelson's
en route to Dostum's HQ.

821
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:25,233
Our best guess is here.
Cobaki.

822
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:27,702
All right, hold on. Why aren't
Nelson and Spencer together?

823
00:49:27,704 --> 00:49:30,070
Nelson split the team.
He took six men

824
00:49:30,072 --> 00:49:33,074
and left Spencer and
the others at the recon point.

825
00:49:33,076 --> 00:49:34,608
Christ, why'd he do that?

826
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,311
Dostum only gave him
six horses.

827
00:49:36,313 --> 00:49:38,144
Apparently, that's the only
way to cross the mountains.

828
00:49:38,146 --> 00:49:39,548
According to Spencer,

829
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,782
the horses aren't
just transportation.

830
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:44,985
Spencer says Dostum
relies on them for combat.

831
00:49:44,987 --> 00:49:46,354
Horses?

832
00:49:46,356 --> 00:49:47,791
Yes, sir.

833
00:49:55,364 --> 00:49:58,000
There. Mullah Razzan's men.

834
00:49:58,835 --> 00:50:00,036
Wait, where?

835
00:50:01,338 --> 00:50:04,238
You see
the pickup trucks?

836
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,708
Those are the Taliban forces
outside of Bescham.

837
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,844
Right. Okay, General,
let me explain how this works.

838
00:50:09,846 --> 00:50:12,579
I need to be close enough to give the
exact coordinates and elevation.

839
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:13,914
It's too dangerous.

840
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,316
General, we're too far away.

841
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:16,717
I can't call in anything
from here.

842
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:19,052
500 of my men can die

843
00:50:19,054 --> 00:50:22,490
before one American gets
a scratch. You know why?

844
00:50:22,492 --> 00:50:23,758
No, why, sir?

845
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,659
Because if one American die,

846
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,429
your government leaves,
and then we lose the war.

847
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:31,900
Okay. I'm dropping these bombs
from 30,000 feet.

848
00:50:31,902 --> 00:50:34,168
The plane doesn't guide
the bombs, I do.

849
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,137
If I can't get close enough, I
can't call in the exact location.

850
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:37,405
Give me your little map.

851
00:50:37,407 --> 00:50:38,709
Give me your map.

852
00:50:41,878 --> 00:50:45,479
There. See?
Here. Taliban.

853
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:46,981
Here. Taliban.

854
00:50:46,983 --> 00:50:50,584
- Okay.
- And here, Taliban.

855
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:52,287
Now drop your bomb.

856
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:54,188
- He's not getting it.
- And we're still too far away.

857
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,624
- Drop bombs.
- How do I even know this is the Taliban?

858
00:50:56,626 --> 00:50:58,226
Who else would it be?

859
00:50:58,228 --> 00:50:59,894
There are a lot of armies
in these mountains, General,

860
00:50:59,896 --> 00:51:02,729
and the U.S. is only at war
with one of them.

861
00:51:02,731 --> 00:51:04,164
You call me a liar?

862
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:05,867
I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying

863
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:07,501
that we're so far away
I can't even tell

864
00:51:07,503 --> 00:51:08,204
what we're shooting at,
what we're hittin'.

865
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:16,713
Christ, he's calling
the fucking Taliban.

866
00:51:24,253 --> 00:51:26,656
<i>America, fuck you!</i>

867
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:30,860
See? Drop bombs.

868
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:39,501
<i>Badger 17, this is Alpha 595.</i>

869
00:51:39,503 --> 00:51:41,469
We need a drop
on enemy position.

870
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:46,706
8-4-7-2, 6-5-4-3.
How copy? Over.

871
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:48,543
<i>Alpha 595, I copy.</i>

872
00:51:48,545 --> 00:51:51,912
<i>8-4-7-2, 6-5-4-3, over.</i>

873
00:51:51,914 --> 00:51:53,682
Roger. Drop when ready.

874
00:51:53,684 --> 00:51:56,150
You hit the green on this one,
boss, you're a goddamn wizard.

875
00:51:56,152 --> 00:51:57,653
Yeah, no shit.

876
00:52:01,257 --> 00:52:02,259
Come on.

877
00:52:37,226 --> 00:52:38,892
Shit.

878
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:40,931
All right, someone explain
to these guys we missed.

879
00:52:57,614 --> 00:53:01,014
Goddamn. Shit.

880
00:53:01,016 --> 00:53:03,550
That was ridiculous. I didn't
come here to play around.

881
00:53:03,552 --> 00:53:05,653
Check fire, we're way off.

882
00:53:05,655 --> 00:53:07,924
Stay here,
I'll call back coordinates.

883
00:53:09,425 --> 00:53:11,191
No, no, Nelson.

884
00:53:11,193 --> 00:53:13,461
- Where's Cap going?
- I don't know. Coffers.

885
00:53:13,463 --> 00:53:15,563
I'm getting closer.

886
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:52,869
Wasn't gonna let you have
all the fun.

887
00:53:55,637 --> 00:53:57,472
You ready for new coordinates?

888
00:53:57,474 --> 00:54:00,742
Yeah, we got some
anxious people up here.

889
00:54:00,744 --> 00:54:03,811
8-3-9-6...

890
00:54:03,813 --> 00:54:05,345
Bad element maneuvered
in on 'em.

891
00:54:05,347 --> 00:54:07,782
Captain, there's an element
moving in on you.

892
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,892
All right, stay here.
Let's go!

893
00:54:54,097 --> 00:54:57,734
I'll say again. 8-3-9...

894
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:00,836
6-4-5-7.

895
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:05,841
Clear and hot.

896
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:10,146
Bombs inbound, boys.
Let's move!

897
00:55:13,148 --> 00:55:14,715
We're danger close, Cap!

898
00:55:14,717 --> 00:55:16,452
Move back! Move!

899
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:20,757
Move! Move!

900
00:55:52,255 --> 00:55:53,354
General.

901
00:55:53,356 --> 00:55:55,255
Their forward position's
obliterated.

902
00:55:55,257 --> 00:55:57,157
Why aren't we moving
on the village?

903
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:58,525
You will not
live long here

904
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:00,161
if you ignore
what I'm telling you.

905
00:56:00,163 --> 00:56:01,695
You told me to bomb,
that's what I did.

906
00:56:01,697 --> 00:56:02,829
Why aren't we attacking?

907
00:56:02,831 --> 00:56:04,532
That wasn't the plan today.

908
00:56:04,534 --> 00:56:06,103
You mind telling me the plan?

909
00:56:07,804 --> 00:56:09,306
We attack tomorrow.

910
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:14,041
Tomorrow. Great.
So that was, uh, what?

911
00:56:14,043 --> 00:56:15,508
Nice little dress rehearsal?

912
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,280
A rehearsal, yeah. Great.

913
00:56:38,534 --> 00:56:40,601
I'm not gonna negotiate.

914
00:56:40,603 --> 00:56:42,036
These are my boots.

915
00:56:42,038 --> 00:56:44,505
You know, the ones you stole
from our drop?

916
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:47,941
I don't know what that means.

917
00:56:47,943 --> 00:56:50,311
I bet you we haven't
even found half our shit.

918
00:56:50,313 --> 00:56:51,314
Yeah.

919
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,184
Oh, yeah. That roof
looks familiar, doesn't it?

920
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:58,488
Hey, how much, huh?

921
00:57:00,188 --> 00:57:02,722
What is that? $10? $9.50?

922
00:57:02,724 --> 00:57:04,825
Huh?

923
00:57:04,827 --> 00:57:08,229
They got 10% of our MREs,
a quarter of our blankets.

924
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:10,033
We're missing a lot.

925
00:57:12,902 --> 00:57:14,203
What?

926
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:20,840
Guess they like
our chem suits.

927
00:57:20,842 --> 00:57:22,278
<i>Très chic.</i>

928
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:52,909
I'd like to tell you
it gets easier, but...

929
00:58:00,717 --> 00:58:03,450
You know, every now and then,

930
00:58:03,452 --> 00:58:06,222
you meet a guy
who doesn't feel anything.

931
00:58:07,422 --> 00:58:11,325
He goes out there,
he kills people.

932
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,896
Falls asleep before his head
hits the pillow.

933
00:58:15,898 --> 00:58:20,135
You know, I used to think that
that'd be better, right?

934
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:23,405
That maybe
I was just too weak.

935
00:58:25,474 --> 00:58:26,509
Then I realized...

936
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:29,876
Nah.

937
00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:33,382
That's the thing that
reminds us that we're humans.

938
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:56,771
Hey, here we go.

939
00:58:56,773 --> 00:58:58,238
How'd you make out?

940
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,673
All kinds of goodies.

941
00:58:59,675 --> 00:59:01,374
Good. Get most of it back?

942
00:59:01,376 --> 00:59:02,976
It was like shopping
at Macy's.

943
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:04,211
- Hey, yo, Spence, bro.
- Yeah.

944
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:05,880
See that little kid
over there?

945
00:59:05,882 --> 00:59:06,981
Yeah.

946
00:59:06,983 --> 00:59:08,349
I can't even take a piss

947
00:59:08,351 --> 00:59:10,351
without the kid
up in my business.

948
00:59:10,353 --> 00:59:12,318
Well, it is
pretty fascinating.

949
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,920
No, not really. It's not.

950
00:59:13,922 --> 00:59:16,590
No. He follows me around
like a little stray dog, bro.

951
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:18,592
Why don't you stop
giving him treats?

952
00:59:18,594 --> 00:59:20,260
Bro, that's the thing. I don't
give him shit, all right?

953
00:59:20,262 --> 00:59:21,695
He just follows me
around smiling

954
00:59:21,697 --> 00:59:23,197
with his little 1910 gun, bro.

955
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:24,501
You don't get it, do you?

956
00:59:25,134 --> 00:59:27,267
What, Spence?

957
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:29,769
These guys guard us.

958
00:59:29,771 --> 00:59:31,505
Any one of us gets killed,

959
00:59:31,507 --> 00:59:33,941
Dostum might execute the man
he thinks is responsible

960
00:59:33,943 --> 00:59:36,342
and his whole family.

961
00:59:36,344 --> 00:59:39,415
And this poor boy got you.

962
00:59:41,784 --> 00:59:43,316
So be nice.

963
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:44,487
Be nice.

964
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:50,693
Hey, uh, Najeeb?

965
00:59:52,262 --> 00:59:55,162
Here, bro,
I got you a little...

966
00:59:55,164 --> 00:59:58,134
It's a little sucker.
Put it in your mouth.

967
01:00:03,438 --> 01:00:06,706
No, no!
You take the thing off it.

968
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:09,711
And then you put it
in your mouth. Yeah.

969
01:00:09,713 --> 01:00:11,445
Put it in your mouth. Yeah.

970
01:00:11,447 --> 01:00:14,548
Don't even fucking go there,
bro. Don't go there, bro.

971
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,115
- Give me my shoes.
- That's cute.

972
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:18,418
- Shut up.
- It's cute.

973
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,554
This is their
next objective, Bescham.

974
01:00:20,556 --> 01:00:24,191
There's only one way in,
and the Taliban know it.

975
01:00:24,193 --> 01:00:26,260
They're dug in hard
just outside of town

976
01:00:26,262 --> 01:00:28,128
right here, heavily fortified.

977
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,662
The whole fucking thing's
a buzzsaw, sir.

978
01:00:29,664 --> 01:00:32,432
Yeah, then why the hell is
Nelson walking into it?

979
01:00:32,434 --> 01:00:33,536
Shit.

980
01:00:34,402 --> 01:00:36,037
Did I pick the wrong guy?

981
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:39,639
Sir, this one's not on Nelson.
It's geography.

982
01:00:39,641 --> 01:00:42,608
Bescham is the only way
to Mazari.

983
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:45,345
Yeah, maybe so. But we can't
pin all our hopes on Nelson.

984
01:00:45,347 --> 01:00:47,347
Let's get a second team
in the works.

985
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:49,050
If Dostum doesn't make it
to Bescham

986
01:00:49,052 --> 01:00:51,452
by the time
the weather sets in,

987
01:00:51,454 --> 01:00:53,954
it's gonna be a real shitshow.

988
01:00:59,494 --> 01:01:02,632
General,
B-52s are in position.

989
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:07,668
You have any idea
what's going on?

990
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,537
Dostum need to find out if his
nephew still over there,

991
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:11,338
fighting along with Taliban.

992
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,905
Many switch sides.

993
01:01:12,907 --> 01:01:17,478
For necessity, loyalty change.
Some every other week.

994
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,146
Why the hell
would they do that?

995
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:21,113
A lot of these guys
are farmers.

996
01:01:21,115 --> 01:01:22,516
Taliban comes through,

997
01:01:22,518 --> 01:01:23,749
they torture, murder,
force them to fight.

998
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:25,154
What choice do they have?

999
01:01:26,822 --> 01:01:28,954
Is it just me
or does it feel like

1000
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:32,461
these assholes are counting their
money every time they look at us?

1001
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:38,865
General.

1002
01:01:41,603 --> 01:01:44,070
His nephew left this morning.
We can proceed.

1003
01:01:44,072 --> 01:01:47,574
Oh. Great.
War's back on, guys.

1004
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:49,677
General, we're minutes
from range.

1005
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:51,512
Is there anything you can tell me
so I can better prepare my men

1006
01:01:51,514 --> 01:01:52,914
- to assist you?
- Very good.

1007
01:01:57,385 --> 01:01:59,320
I don't know if horses
were the best idea today.

1008
01:01:59,322 --> 01:02:01,456
The bombs are gonna
scare them bad.

1009
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:04,224
The horses know
that these are American bombs.

1010
01:02:04,226 --> 01:02:05,791
They won't be afraid.

1011
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:10,563
Oh, they know that
they're American bombs. Okay.

1012
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:12,465
Makes sense.

1013
01:02:12,467 --> 01:02:14,303
Wookie-99, new grid.

1014
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,873
8-3-4-2, break, 6-6-4-9.

1015
01:02:39,494 --> 01:02:41,595
Eastern flank is clear,
General.

1016
01:02:42,731 --> 01:02:45,132
You Americans,
stay here!

1017
01:03:06,822 --> 01:03:09,255
They're surrendering. Razzan
is shooting his own men.

1018
01:03:09,257 --> 01:03:10,692
Jesus Christ.

1019
01:03:23,271 --> 01:03:25,938
Hey, where the hell
did those come from?

1020
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,510
How did Dostum not know
about a supply line?

1021
01:03:33,414 --> 01:03:35,416
Wookie-99,
we need a drop.

1022
01:03:35,418 --> 01:03:36,916
<i>Negative. I'm bingo.</i>

1023
01:03:36,918 --> 01:03:38,552
You're kidding me!
I'm staring at a company

1024
01:03:38,554 --> 01:03:40,153
of tanks. We need a drop!

1025
01:03:40,155 --> 01:03:41,924
<i>I'm sorry, I'm out
of fuel, sir. I'm out.</i>

1026
01:04:16,157 --> 01:04:18,657
Hey, they're getting slaughtered.
We gotta cover their retreat.

1027
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:21,263
Michaels, Coffers,
base element.

1028
01:04:52,594 --> 01:04:53,596
Go!

1029
01:05:10,378 --> 01:05:12,479
Dostum!

1030
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:14,817
We've lost air support!
Fall back!

1031
01:05:20,922 --> 01:05:21,822
Fall back!

1032
01:05:21,824 --> 01:05:23,893
Bennett! Bennett,
are you okay?

1033
01:05:33,534 --> 01:05:35,637
Now you have killer eyes!

1034
01:05:38,807 --> 01:05:40,510
Go!

1035
01:05:42,643 --> 01:05:43,909
Fucking hold him
still, man.

1036
01:05:43,911 --> 01:05:47,015
I'm fucking holding him.
Jesus Christ.

1037
01:05:49,952 --> 01:05:51,150
All right.

1038
01:05:58,728 --> 01:06:00,860
He's gone. He's gone.

1039
01:06:00,862 --> 01:06:03,765
Let's move him up. Up there.

1040
01:06:15,744 --> 01:06:19,746
General, you know
this area, right?

1041
01:06:19,748 --> 01:06:21,449
Right? Which means you knew

1042
01:06:21,451 --> 01:06:23,083
about the Taliban's
supply line,

1043
01:06:23,085 --> 01:06:24,385
and you didn't tell me.

1044
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:26,186
If I had known,
if you had told me,

1045
01:06:26,188 --> 01:06:28,088
I could have hit that column
before they ever made it to us.

1046
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:32,059
If you wanna kill
your own men, that's fine.

1047
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:33,427
But I ain't letting you put
my men

1048
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:34,929
in harm's way, you understand?

1049
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:36,630
Everywhere you go
is harm's way.

1050
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:39,099
No shit.

1051
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:43,003
We're fighting with horsemen
against tanks.

1052
01:06:43,005 --> 01:06:45,104
You have an obligation to
tell me everything you know.

1053
01:06:45,106 --> 01:06:47,240
You don't have a stomach
for everything I know.

1054
01:06:47,242 --> 01:06:48,675
Ah, fuck.

1055
01:06:48,677 --> 01:06:50,443
You will not win here

1056
01:06:50,445 --> 01:06:52,148
because you are not honest
with yourself.

1057
01:06:53,382 --> 01:06:56,282
You expect victory
without blood.

1058
01:06:56,284 --> 01:06:59,519
I expect you to share
strategic information with us.

1059
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:01,354
Otherwise what the fuck
are we doing here?

1060
01:07:01,356 --> 01:07:03,356
Your anger
comes from your fear

1061
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:04,891
because you live in a place

1062
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:07,394
where life looks better
than afterlife.

1063
01:07:07,396 --> 01:07:09,162
That's not this place.

1064
01:07:09,164 --> 01:07:12,001
Here, Taliban kills everything
you live for.

1065
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:16,705
Your mission will fail
because you fear death.

1066
01:07:18,407 --> 01:07:21,508
Mullah Razzan's men,
the Taliban,

1067
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,510
they welcome it.

1068
01:07:23,512 --> 01:07:27,680
Because they believe there is
riches waiting for them in Heaven.

1069
01:07:27,682 --> 01:07:30,083
Give me the goddamn
information I need,

1070
01:07:30,085 --> 01:07:32,485
and I'll reward
every last one of them.

1071
01:07:35,324 --> 01:07:36,956
General, I'm your link

1072
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:39,059
to the greatest weaponry in
the history of civilization.

1073
01:07:39,061 --> 01:07:42,996
You gotta stop guarding me
and start trusting me.

1074
01:07:42,998 --> 01:07:47,668
Greatest weapon
in history is this.

1075
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,769
I don't have soldiers
in my army,

1076
01:07:49,771 --> 01:07:51,940
not one. Only warriors.

1077
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:56,876
Stop being a soldier.

1078
01:07:56,878 --> 01:08:01,951
Start using this,
and you can be a warrior, too.

1079
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:23,605
Come with me.

1080
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:45,228
Sit.

1081
01:08:48,797 --> 01:08:52,001
They bring their weapons
through Tiangi Gap.

1082
01:08:52,935 --> 01:08:55,001
Out here, there's nothing.

1083
01:08:55,003 --> 01:08:58,571
No passage, no water.
No shade.

1084
01:08:58,573 --> 01:09:01,273
So the only way
to Mazar-i-Sharif

1085
01:09:01,275 --> 01:09:03,375
is through Tiangi Gap.

1086
01:09:03,377 --> 01:09:04,878
That's a choke point.

1087
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,280
That's the only way.

1088
01:09:07,282 --> 01:09:08,682
So, for us to take Mazar,

1089
01:09:08,684 --> 01:09:10,250
- we'll have to beat him in this Gap.
- Yes.

1090
01:09:10,252 --> 01:09:13,553
To get access to their
stronghold in Tiangi,

1091
01:09:13,555 --> 01:09:15,891
we must first take Bescham.

1092
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:20,994
You know, you have the sky,

1093
01:09:20,996 --> 01:09:23,966
but wars are won in the dirt.

1094
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:27,768
I knew
about their supply line.

1095
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:30,172
But I didn't expect
their weapons.

1096
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,277
Fakir was my godson.

1097
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:38,812
Every time you lose a man,

1098
01:09:38,814 --> 01:09:40,950
it's like a stab
in your heart.

1099
01:09:43,152 --> 01:09:46,986
And my heart is butchered,
my friend.

1100
01:09:46,988 --> 01:09:50,125
Don't think I send my men
out there to die.

1101
01:09:53,929 --> 01:09:56,599
I'm going to win you
this thing, I swear to God.

1102
01:10:01,537 --> 01:10:03,870
I believe you.

1103
01:10:03,872 --> 01:10:05,472
Now see,
the Taliban won't be

1104
01:10:05,474 --> 01:10:06,839
defending
their western flank

1105
01:10:06,841 --> 01:10:08,241
because they can't
imagine anything

1106
01:10:08,243 --> 01:10:09,777
coming from this desert.

1107
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:11,611
Now, it's a crazy idea, but...

1108
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:12,845
But what?

1109
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:14,248
Well,
the Taliban reinforcements

1110
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,715
come through here.
Through the Tiangi Gap.

1111
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:19,885
This is why Dostum's killing
himself trying to move forward.

1112
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:21,521
All the Taliban has to do

1113
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:24,590
is hold him off long enough
to bring in more artillery.

1114
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:28,027
There's nothing out there.
There's no water, no nothing.

1115
01:10:28,029 --> 01:10:31,164
When you come in behind their
line, you cut that chain.

1116
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:33,433
Ammo dumps, convoys, anything
you can hit, you hit it.

1117
01:10:33,435 --> 01:10:36,503
Can I walk it? I'm sick
of that fucking horse.

1118
01:10:36,505 --> 01:10:38,738
Diller, it's
120 klicks or something.

1119
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:42,843
A drop would give up your position.
You gotta pack everything in.

1120
01:10:42,845 --> 01:10:44,410
Can Dostum give us some mules?

1121
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:46,080
- Yeah, probably.
- Okay.

1122
01:10:46,082 --> 01:10:47,813
But listen, whoever does this
thing has got to understand,

1123
01:10:47,815 --> 01:10:49,849
this is different than what
we've been doing, all right?

1124
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:51,617
You're on your own.
No reinforcements,

1125
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:53,189
no extraction, nothing.

1126
01:10:55,224 --> 01:10:58,090
Shit, I can't order
anyone to do this.

1127
01:10:58,092 --> 01:10:59,929
Someone's got to volunteer.

1128
01:11:00,529 --> 01:11:01,928
Yes, you can.

1129
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,865
Just give us the order.

1130
01:11:08,237 --> 01:11:09,201
That's an order.

1131
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:11,303
Nothin' I'd rather do.

1132
01:11:11,305 --> 01:11:14,206
- Now pick two guys.
- Bennett.

1133
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:16,276
- I'm in.
- Coffers?

1134
01:11:16,278 --> 01:11:19,513
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
Thank you, sir.

1135
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:20,883
No, thank you.

1136
01:11:22,016 --> 01:11:23,217
Good luck, Bennett.

1137
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:24,851
Give 'em hell, buddy.

1138
01:11:24,853 --> 01:11:27,256
I guess the best-looking
fellas get the choice...

1139
01:11:36,364 --> 01:11:38,833
<i>595 Bravo, come in.</i>

1140
01:11:40,301 --> 01:11:41,668
Go for Bravo.

1141
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:42,869
Hey, did you guys get horses?

1142
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:44,004
<i>Yes.</i>

1143
01:11:44,006 --> 01:11:45,905
All right, good.
Ride up to us.

1144
01:11:45,907 --> 01:11:48,607
I split the team again,
sent Diller downrange.

1145
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:50,945
Roger that. On our way.

1146
01:12:05,293 --> 01:12:08,260
Welcome
to the Ritz, boys.

1147
01:12:08,262 --> 01:12:11,063
Valet will take your horses
in the back.

1148
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:13,031
Came all the way
up here for this?

1149
01:12:13,033 --> 01:12:14,366
Where's the pool?

1150
01:12:14,368 --> 01:12:15,835
Trying to work
on my suntan, bro.

1151
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:17,440
I think my massage
is at 4:00.

1152
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,040
Whoa, whoa.

1153
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:21,273
What the hell happened
to Spencer?

1154
01:12:21,275 --> 01:12:23,544
Well, he was right
behind us, Cap.

1155
01:12:23,546 --> 01:12:24,843
Oh.

1156
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:26,713
Shit.

1157
01:12:26,715 --> 01:12:28,348
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

1158
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:31,985
Yeah, I'm fine. I gotta get
off this goddamn horse.

1159
01:12:31,987 --> 01:12:34,419
It's his back.
He slipped a disc, I think.

1160
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:35,724
All right.

1161
01:12:36,524 --> 01:12:38,625
Give me your...

1162
01:12:38,627 --> 01:12:40,460
I got you. Okay.

1163
01:12:40,462 --> 01:12:42,227
- Oh. Oh!
- Easy.

1164
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:43,796
- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck!

1165
01:12:43,798 --> 01:12:45,768
Fucking heavy.

1166
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:47,232
Sorry.

1167
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:49,568
You're all right. You're good.

1168
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:52,071
Now, listen. Diller,
he missed his first check-in.

1169
01:12:52,073 --> 01:12:54,508
Well, it's the mountains.
No reception, right?

1170
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:55,708
Yeah, maybe.

1171
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,043
Where'd you send him?

1172
01:12:57,045 --> 01:12:58,579
He's flanking
their supply route.

1173
01:12:58,581 --> 01:12:59,679
Risky.

1174
01:12:59,681 --> 01:13:01,147
Little bit.

1175
01:13:01,149 --> 01:13:03,383
Well, the band's
back together.

1176
01:13:03,385 --> 01:13:06,986
Jesus, chief,
you look like my grandpa.

1177
01:13:06,988 --> 01:13:09,554
20 bucks if you can
stand up straight.

1178
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:11,959
You can keep that $20.

1179
01:13:11,961 --> 01:13:14,727
Well, the best thing about
calling in airstrikes,

1180
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:16,595
you can do it
laying down, right?

1181
01:13:16,597 --> 01:13:17,830
That's right.

1182
01:13:17,832 --> 01:13:20,035
Let's get this war started!

1183
01:13:48,063 --> 01:13:49,498
So far all clear, Cap.

1184
01:14:28,369 --> 01:14:29,537
Hmm.

1185
01:14:30,805 --> 01:14:32,540
What do you think?

1186
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:26,061
Jesus, we didn't get
all of them.

1187
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:05,130
Captain! What's the order?

1188
01:16:05,132 --> 01:16:07,670
Cover Dostum!
Follow him! Move!

1189
01:16:10,038 --> 01:16:11,506
Move!

1190
01:16:21,182 --> 01:16:23,418
Milo! Ready?

1191
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:29,457
Go!

1192
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,663
Milo!

1193
01:16:37,765 --> 01:16:39,000
Get the fuck over here!

1194
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:49,177
Shit.

1195
01:17:22,644 --> 01:17:23,942
Jones!

1196
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:25,044
Huh?

1197
01:17:25,046 --> 01:17:26,515
Moving!

1198
01:17:53,809 --> 01:17:55,244
Rocket!

1199
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,430
<i>595, we're all clear.</i>

1200
01:18:35,315 --> 01:18:36,915
Try it again, bro.

1201
01:18:36,917 --> 01:18:38,084
"Motherfucker."

1202
01:18:38,086 --> 01:18:41,287
Mudda fuggah.

1203
01:18:41,289 --> 01:18:43,158
Now we're getting somewhere.

1204
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:51,464
You know,
I was thinking, uh,

1205
01:18:51,466 --> 01:18:56,535
if I continue to follow you, I'm
probably not gonna live very long.

1206
01:18:56,537 --> 01:18:59,805
That's some ballsy shit
you did back there.

1207
01:18:59,807 --> 01:19:02,208
Sometimes you have
to lead your men

1208
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,645
back into the right direction.

1209
01:19:08,615 --> 01:19:10,849
What's the game
they're playing?

1210
01:19:10,851 --> 01:19:13,385
<i>Besh Tosh.</i> Uzbek game.

1211
01:19:13,387 --> 01:19:14,754
<i>Besh Tosh?</i>

1212
01:19:14,756 --> 01:19:17,826
<i>Besh,</i> five.
<i>Tosh,</i> rocks.

1213
01:19:19,862 --> 01:19:24,330
You know,
when I ruled over Bescham,

1214
01:19:24,332 --> 01:19:29,369
women wore no veils.
Girls went to school.

1215
01:19:29,371 --> 01:19:32,440
We had movies at the theater.

1216
01:19:37,078 --> 01:19:39,715
But here,
Razzan killed my family.

1217
01:19:42,015 --> 01:19:45,720
I dreamed about taking it
back, but now that I'm here,

1218
01:19:46,621 --> 01:19:48,690
I don't wanna walk in.

1219
01:19:51,393 --> 01:19:53,427
Too much pain.

1220
01:19:57,465 --> 01:19:59,801
I hope you never know it.

1221
01:20:01,703 --> 01:20:02,902
Uh, Cap?

1222
01:20:02,904 --> 01:20:04,570
Yeah?

1223
01:20:04,572 --> 01:20:07,240
You got a message through
secure interface with Bowers.

1224
01:20:07,242 --> 01:20:08,407
It's from SecDef.

1225
01:20:08,409 --> 01:20:10,041
Yeah, I'll read it later, man.

1226
01:20:10,043 --> 01:20:11,876
Sorry, Cap.

1227
01:20:11,878 --> 01:20:14,949
The Donald Rumsfeld just sent you
an email and it ain't a good one.

1228
01:20:22,457 --> 01:20:24,290
What's it say?

1229
01:20:24,292 --> 01:20:27,329
"When are you gonna get off
your ass and get to Mazar?"

1230
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:32,768
Jesus Christ.

1231
01:20:41,943 --> 01:20:45,077
You know what?
Write this back to him.

1232
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:48,250
"Sir, let me explain
the reality on the ground."

1233
01:20:49,984 --> 01:20:51,452
Write it.

1234
01:20:52,119 --> 01:20:53,986
Okay.

1235
01:20:53,988 --> 01:20:55,620

Good drop. Good drop.

We hit one of their outposts.

Yeah.
Hey, get Mitch over here.

1263
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:35,487
Hey, Captain!

1264
01:22:35,489 --> 01:22:37,893
- Yeah.
- Come over here, please!

1265
01:22:38,893 --> 01:22:41,096
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1266
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:45,798
It's like a javelin.

1267
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,503
- You all right, Hal?
- Oh, yeah.

1268
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:53,540
So you think you're making
any progress with Dostum?

1269
01:22:53,542 --> 01:22:55,607
Yeah. Yeah, we're doing good.

1270
01:22:55,609 --> 01:22:58,111
We're thinking of getting an apartment
together when this is all over.

1271
01:22:58,113 --> 01:23:02,915
Oh, shit.
No, don't make me laugh.

1272
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:06,152
Glad you got a sense of humor.
I got some bad news.

1273
01:23:06,154 --> 01:23:07,754
What?

1274
01:23:07,756 --> 01:23:11,956
Headquarters inserted ODA 555
with Atta's militia.

1275
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:14,559
Wait, General Atta,
Dostum's rival?

1276
01:23:14,561 --> 01:23:18,830
They think they have a better
shot of reaching Mazar-i-Sharif.

1277
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:21,267
They don't trust us
to get through the gauntlet.

1278
01:23:21,269 --> 01:23:22,634
This kills us, Hal.

1279
01:23:22,636 --> 01:23:24,637
The minute Dostum hears
about Atta,

1280
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,608
he's gonna forget
all about the Taliban.

1281
01:23:27,074 --> 01:23:28,874
Could be.

1282
01:23:28,876 --> 01:23:30,809
You might wanna
break up camp now,

1283
01:23:30,811 --> 01:23:32,812
in case you gotta
get out of here quick.

1284
01:23:32,814 --> 01:23:34,080
Yeah.

1285
01:23:34,082 --> 01:23:36,115
Hey, think of it this way.

1286
01:23:36,117 --> 01:23:38,785
You've just been handed
the most important

1287
01:23:38,787 --> 01:23:41,456
diplomatic job
in the free world.

1288
01:23:43,024 --> 01:23:45,527
Keeping the Northern Alliance
together.

1289
01:24:10,984 --> 01:24:13,919
Oh, finally.
I'm starving to death.

1290
01:24:18,059 --> 01:24:19,594
Habib.

1291
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:22,794
Tell him that I wanna buy
one of his sheep.

1292
01:24:28,168 --> 01:24:29,902
He says
they're not for sale.

1293
01:24:29,904 --> 01:24:31,603
Everything's for sale.

1294
01:24:31,605 --> 01:24:34,005
Okay, tell him that we'll give
him 50 American dollars.

1295
01:24:41,815 --> 01:24:43,616
He says he will take $500.

1296
01:24:43,618 --> 01:24:46,052
For that?

1297
01:24:46,054 --> 01:24:47,186
How much are they worth?

1298
01:24:47,188 --> 01:24:48,353
$100.

1299
01:24:48,355 --> 01:24:49,858
Okay.

1300
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:55,126
Huh?

1301
01:24:55,128 --> 01:24:57,495
300 American dollars.

1302
01:24:57,497 --> 01:24:58,933
Yes?

1303
01:24:59,434 --> 01:25:00,933
Good?

1304
01:25:00,935 --> 01:25:03,001
This guy should be
a fucking military contractor.

1305
01:25:03,003 --> 01:25:04,437
All right.

1306
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:06,106
Great. Lamb chops.

1307
01:25:17,685 --> 01:25:19,250
It's a great day,
my friend.

1308
01:25:19,252 --> 01:25:22,821
The Taliban pulled back
to protect the Gap.

1309
01:25:22,823 --> 01:25:25,858
We can move forward to here
in the morning.

1310
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:29,062
If we do tomorrow right, we can
run them all the way to Mazar.

1311
01:25:29,064 --> 01:25:31,500
This war is won
or lost tomorrow.

1312
01:25:33,902 --> 01:25:36,501
General, I wanna explain
one of the other missions

1313
01:25:36,503 --> 01:25:38,003
that are taking place
tomorrow.

1314
01:25:38,005 --> 01:25:40,004
There's another team
like mine,

1315
01:25:40,006 --> 01:25:42,442
and they've been placed
with General Atta Mohammed.

1316
01:25:42,444 --> 01:25:44,610
They're moving on Mazar
from the southeast.

1317
01:25:44,612 --> 01:25:46,544
They gave north to Atta.

1318
01:25:46,546 --> 01:25:48,546
From the U.S. point of view,
you're all the Northern Alliance.

1319
01:25:48,548 --> 01:25:51,183
Who is the U.S. to tell me
what Northern Alliance is?

1320
01:25:51,185 --> 01:25:53,485
If Atta moves
to Mazar-i-Sharif first...

1321
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:55,353
We're not dropping bombs so you can
go to war with Atta over the north.

1322
01:25:55,355 --> 01:25:57,156
The mission hasn't changed,
General.

1323
01:25:57,158 --> 01:25:58,991
We're gonna punch through
this Gap into the city.

1324
01:25:58,993 --> 01:26:01,093
Tiangi Gap is over
two kilometers long.

1325
01:26:01,095 --> 01:26:03,129
Razzan's best weapons
are right here.

1326
01:26:03,131 --> 01:26:06,199
Machine guns, mortars,
heavy armors.

1327
01:26:06,201 --> 01:26:10,736
And right here is 055 Brigade.
Foreign fighters. Al-Qaeda.

1328
01:26:10,738 --> 01:26:13,238
They won't give an inch.
They prefer death.

1329
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,840
I won't let my men die
so Atta can go to Mazar first.

1330
01:26:15,842 --> 01:26:18,477
This isn't just your war,
General.

1331
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:21,113
There are thousands of people
dead in your country and mine.

1332
01:26:21,115 --> 01:26:23,781
Now let me show you
how this is possible.

1333
01:26:23,783 --> 01:26:26,852
All right? We've already
lured them into this Gap.

1334
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:28,653
I'm gonna put a man
on each flank,

1335
01:26:28,655 --> 01:26:31,057
and we're gonna overwhelm
this canyon with air support.

1336
01:26:31,059 --> 01:26:32,925
I've already sent
Diller downrange.

1337
01:26:32,927 --> 01:26:35,762
He's gonna cut off any
resupply and hit any retreat.

1338
01:26:35,764 --> 01:26:37,796
Then, you and I are gonna
charge through this Gap

1339
01:26:37,798 --> 01:26:40,301
and hit that main body
with a full frontal assault.

1340
01:26:41,735 --> 01:26:44,605
But Atta cannot
get to Mazar first.

1341
01:26:46,474 --> 01:26:48,941
I'm taking my men through there,
General, with or without you.

1342
01:26:48,943 --> 01:26:51,777
Without me and my men,
you are just an army of 12.

1343
01:26:51,779 --> 01:26:53,946
You all will die.
Good luck.

1344
01:26:53,948 --> 01:26:56,585
God damn it!
You're unbelievable.

1345
01:26:57,917 --> 01:27:01,285
You showed me the town
where your family died.

1346
01:27:01,287 --> 01:27:02,988
Told me every hell Razzan

1347
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:05,124
and his army unleashed
on this place.

1348
01:27:05,126 --> 01:27:08,427
And now all you care about
is some turf war?

1349
01:27:08,429 --> 01:27:11,897
You lectured me
about the heart of a warrior.

1350
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:14,868
You're no warrior.
You're just another warlord.

1351
01:27:15,668 --> 01:27:17,370
Yeah, go ahead.

1352
01:27:17,372 --> 01:27:19,841
It ain't us that's quitting,
General, it's you.

1353
01:27:33,354 --> 01:27:35,888
That's not a happy face.

1354
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:38,860
I don't think
Dostum's on board.

1355
01:27:40,094 --> 01:27:42,460
What do you mean not on board?

1356
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:45,363
He says he's not gonna fight a battle that
opens a way for his rival to take the city.

1357
01:27:45,365 --> 01:27:46,965
That's not
very big-picture of him.

1358
01:27:46,967 --> 01:27:49,567
He's fighting more than
one war here.

1359
01:27:49,569 --> 01:27:52,170
Look, I don't like it, but these
are the cards we've been dealt.

1360
01:27:52,172 --> 01:27:54,373
Yeah, well, Captain,
you gotta talk to him.

1361
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:56,540
I did. He's gone.

1362
01:27:56,542 --> 01:27:59,678
He's taken most of his men, most
of the militia, and they left.

1363
01:28:02,216 --> 01:28:05,017
Listen, I ain't gonna lie
to you guys.

1364
01:28:05,019 --> 01:28:08,390
The chances are we are not
gonna make it out of this one.

1365
01:28:11,492 --> 01:28:14,259
Goddamn, we're this close.

1366
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:18,063
We're so close to wiping
Al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan.

1367
01:28:18,065 --> 01:28:21,400
We'll never get
another chance like this.

1368
01:28:21,402 --> 01:28:23,769
But if we quit now,

1369
01:28:23,771 --> 01:28:25,736
then what happened back home

1370
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:28,842
is gonna happen
again and again.

1371
01:28:30,978 --> 01:28:33,181
Each of you gotta
make this decision,

1372
01:28:33,846 --> 01:28:35,916
but I'm in.

1373
01:28:37,385 --> 01:28:39,585
We're ready for anything.

1374
01:28:39,587 --> 01:28:41,189
With or without him.

1375
01:28:42,355 --> 01:28:44,455
Fuck him.

1376
01:28:44,457 --> 01:28:46,726
I mean,
we're already here, right?

1377
01:28:46,728 --> 01:28:49,527
All right.
We go in the morning.

1378
01:28:49,529 --> 01:28:51,629
You take what's left
of the guards with you.

1379
01:28:51,631 --> 01:28:53,331
And get some rest tonight.

1380
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:58,670
<i>Tomorrow's gonna decide it
one way or another.</i>

1381
01:28:58,672 --> 01:29:03,010
<i>Spencer, Black. You call in
airstrikes from the eastern flank.</i>

1382
01:29:05,378 --> 01:29:07,446
<i>Milo, Jackson and
Essex have been pushed out</i>

1383
01:29:07,448 --> 01:29:10,982
against the enemy's
western flank right here.

1384
01:29:10,984 --> 01:29:12,384
<i>Diller, Coffers and Bennett</i>

1385
01:29:12,386 --> 01:29:14,085
<i>will cover the enemy's
northern flank</i>

1386
01:29:14,087 --> 01:29:17,455
in an attempt to block
reinforcements from Mazar.

1387
01:29:17,457 --> 01:29:19,558
<i>Falls and Michaels,
cover Jones and me</i>

1388
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,796
<i>from the sniper position
on the southern flank.</i>

1389
01:29:24,966 --> 01:29:28,002
Here we go
down the rabbit hole.

1390
01:29:33,173 --> 01:29:34,873
- All right, Vern.
- Yeah.

1391
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:36,776
Who wins in a fight?

1392
01:29:36,778 --> 01:29:39,311
Queen Elizabeth
or Margaret Thatcher?

1393
01:29:39,313 --> 01:29:41,446
Jesus, Falls. Where do you
come up with this shit?

1394
01:29:41,448 --> 01:29:43,917
From the depths
of my brilliant mind.

1395
01:29:46,787 --> 01:29:48,288
Seeing that, boss?

1396
01:29:52,827 --> 01:29:54,726
Falls, a scout just
picked us up.

1397
01:29:54,728 --> 01:29:55,960
My two o'clock. Over.

1398
01:29:55,962 --> 01:29:57,331
Target.

1399
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,935
Got him.

1400
01:30:01,868 --> 01:30:03,438
650 yards.

1401
01:30:04,404 --> 01:30:06,840
Hold to left.

1402
01:30:11,811 --> 01:30:13,046
Good hit.

1403
01:30:27,528 --> 01:30:29,063
Coffers,
get that radio up.

1404
01:30:29,863 --> 01:30:31,362
I need 10 minutes.

1405
01:30:31,364 --> 01:30:32,432
You got five.

1406
01:30:33,634 --> 01:30:36,037
Like I said, five minutes.

1407
01:30:53,453 --> 01:30:55,289
No Dostum, huh?

1408
01:30:59,158 --> 01:31:02,995
K2 base,
this is 595 Delta. Over.

1409
01:31:02,997 --> 01:31:05,565
Request medevac on standby.
Over.

1410
01:31:05,567 --> 01:31:06,967
Roger.

1411
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:09,768
Shit.

1412
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:11,003
How we looking, J?

1413
01:31:11,005 --> 01:31:13,871
Eh. We're in the right spot.

1414
01:31:13,873 --> 01:31:17,576
Fuck, there's gotta be
at least 15,000 down there.

1415
01:31:17,578 --> 01:31:19,611
<i>Spencer, this is Alpha.
We're in position.</i>

1416
01:31:19,613 --> 01:31:21,079
<i>Start lasing targets
of opportunity.</i>

1417
01:31:21,081 --> 01:31:23,115
Biggest guns first. Over.

1418
01:31:23,117 --> 01:31:24,983
I am your biggest gun, Cap.

1419
01:31:24,985 --> 01:31:27,320
Diller, welcome back, man.
How was your trip?

1420
01:31:27,322 --> 01:31:29,088
<i>Oh, I'm doing great.</i>

1421
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:31,557
<i>I'm looking at timeshares
over here for the summer.</i>

1422
01:31:31,559 --> 01:31:33,692
All right.
Let's do this, boys.

1423
01:31:33,694 --> 01:31:34,960
<i>Heads down, stay safe.</i>

1424
01:31:34,962 --> 01:31:36,364
All right, good to go.

1425
01:31:37,832 --> 01:31:39,200
All right, good.

1426
01:31:41,435 --> 01:31:43,134
- Hey, yo, J?
- Yeah.

1427
01:31:43,136 --> 01:31:46,140
055 brigade. Al-Qaeda.

1428
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,442
Gotta lead them
a bit more, bro.

1429
01:31:49,444 --> 01:31:51,210
All right. Gotcha.

1430
01:31:51,212 --> 01:31:54,847
Viper 47,
this is Bravo 595.

1431
01:31:54,849 --> 01:32:00,355
Laser target designator 38.65.

1432
01:32:01,788 --> 01:32:04,291
Target, tanks in the open.

1433
01:32:38,057 --> 01:32:39,858
Nice shot, chief.

1434
01:32:41,996 --> 01:32:44,530
How's that taste, huh?

1435
01:32:44,532 --> 01:32:46,732
Okay, Bravo, good drop.
Shift your targets

1436
01:32:46,734 --> 01:32:48,967
500 meters south. Over.

1437
01:32:48,969 --> 01:32:51,303
Viper 47, new target.

1438
01:32:51,305 --> 01:32:54,709
Multiple troops in the open.
Drop 500 meters east of...

1439
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:58,977
Chief? Chief, chief, chief.

1440
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:00,681
How'd they find us?

1441
01:33:01,847 --> 01:33:03,581
They surrendering?

1442
01:33:08,555 --> 01:33:11,322
Chief,
are they surrendering?

1443
01:33:11,324 --> 01:33:14,559
Maybe.
Might be a trick.

1444
01:33:14,561 --> 01:33:17,161
Keep your finger
on the trigger, okay?

1445
01:33:18,532 --> 01:33:20,165
What do you wanna do
with them?

1446
01:33:24,337 --> 01:33:27,138
Alpha 595, this is Bravo 595.

1447
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:29,708
We got a situation here.

1448
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:33,312
Multiple enemy combatants attempting
to surrender at our position.

1449
01:33:36,216 --> 01:33:37,749
<i>Roger, Bravo.</i>

1450
01:33:37,751 --> 01:33:40,121
Give me a sitrep
when they're contained. Over.

1451
01:33:46,993 --> 01:33:51,298
Flash 21, this is 595 Charlie.
Request immediate...

1452
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:06,613
We gotta get
that goddamn antenna!

1453
01:34:07,414 --> 01:34:08,582
Cover me!

1454
01:34:28,135 --> 01:34:29,503
Oh, shit!

1455
01:34:31,037 --> 01:34:33,437
They got a BM-21 and they're
going into the Gap!

1456
01:34:37,677 --> 01:34:39,613
Do you want to surrender?

1457
01:34:40,847 --> 01:34:43,147
Do you understand?

1458
01:34:43,149 --> 01:34:47,018
No, no. Just stay there.

1459
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,722
Stay there, okay?

1460
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:52,790
If you wish to surrender,
you stay right there.

1461
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:55,727
Stop. All right.

1462
01:35:04,971 --> 01:35:08,242
All right. We gotta
search each one of these guys.

1463
01:35:08,909 --> 01:35:11,143
One by one.

1464
01:35:11,145 --> 01:35:12,644
You hear me?

1465
01:35:12,646 --> 01:35:14,111
Okay. Yeah.

1466
01:35:14,113 --> 01:35:15,213
Stay sharp.

1467
01:35:58,725 --> 01:36:02,727
Hal? Hal? Shit.

1468
01:36:02,729 --> 01:36:05,599
Oh, shit! Hal? Hal?

1469
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:08,933
Hal? Oh, God.

1470
01:36:08,935 --> 01:36:11,204
Hal, come on, buddy. Hal. Hal!

1471
01:36:13,875 --> 01:36:15,176
Shit.

1472
01:36:16,842 --> 01:36:19,978
No, no, no. Hal.
Hal, come on, buddy. Come on.

1473
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,414
No, no, no.

1474
01:36:23,649 --> 01:36:25,853
Hal! Come on! Oh, shit!

1475
01:36:27,354 --> 01:36:29,955
Hey, buddy. Come on.

1476
01:36:29,957 --> 01:36:33,561
Any station, Bravo is down!
Bravo is down!

1477
01:36:34,728 --> 01:36:35,693
How bad?

1478
01:36:35,695 --> 01:36:38,265
Bad! I need immediate medevac!

1479
01:36:38,966 --> 01:36:40,768
I'm on it, sir.

1480
01:36:51,177 --> 01:36:52,880
Here, fix this!

1481
01:37:01,287 --> 01:37:03,455
Sir, better late
than never, huh?

1482
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:27,478
Let's go! Let's go!

1483
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:30,014
- How about now?
- Yeah, yeah. Good, good.

1484
01:37:30,016 --> 01:37:32,518
Alpha, this is Charlie.
Do you read me?

1485
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,218
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1486
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:36,220
<i>There's a BM-21 in the Gap,
loaded with rockets.</i>

1487
01:37:36,222 --> 01:37:37,490
Oh, shit.

1488
01:37:57,277 --> 01:37:59,247
What the fuck is that?

1489
01:38:35,349 --> 01:38:37,116
Black,
give me Spencer's status.

1490
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:39,918
It's a sucking chest wound.
He's on a real clock here.

1491
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:44,388
All right, ready? Three,
two, one. Up. Let's go. Easy.

1492
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:46,157
Hey. Movement.

1493
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,726
Let's roll, boys. Let's roll.

1494
01:38:47,728 --> 01:38:48,863
Get down. Get down.
Get down. Get down.

1495
01:39:16,622 --> 01:39:18,925
Essex,
can you target the BM-21?

1496
01:39:21,429 --> 01:39:22,896
Negative.

1497
01:39:24,997 --> 01:39:26,229
Pulling back?

1498
01:39:26,231 --> 01:39:27,534
Back to the horses. Move!

1499
01:39:30,737 --> 01:39:31,771
Go!

1500
01:39:41,113 --> 01:39:43,182
Taliban's gonna
swamp your position

1501
01:39:43,184 --> 01:39:44,816
before a medevac can get in.

1502
01:39:44,818 --> 01:39:46,686
Put the radio
to Spencer's ear.

1503
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:53,625
<i>All right, this is
double or nothing, Hal.</i>

1504
01:39:53,627 --> 01:39:55,526
<i>We're gonna evac you.</i>

1505
01:39:55,528 --> 01:39:57,595
Don't stop.

1506
01:39:57,597 --> 01:39:59,764
We're not. We're gonna airlift you
from the other side of the Gap

1507
01:39:59,766 --> 01:40:03,035
on the road to Mazar-i-Sharif.
It's the only way, Hal.

1508
01:40:03,037 --> 01:40:05,903
<i>Remember,
the only way home is winning.</i>

1509
01:40:05,905 --> 01:40:08,539
<i>You hang in there, my friend.</i>

1510
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:32,964
Call the drop now!

1511
01:40:32,966 --> 01:40:36,366
464, adjust your target
20 meters west.

1512
01:40:36,368 --> 01:40:37,468
How copy? Over.

1513
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:39,004
<i>Good copy, 595.</i>

1514
01:40:39,006 --> 01:40:41,542
<i>But we are not authorized
so close to you.</i>

1515
01:40:42,408 --> 01:40:44,709
Danger close, bro!

1516
01:40:44,711 --> 01:40:47,713
464, requesting
danger close ordnance!

1517
01:40:47,715 --> 01:40:49,949
<i>Copy that.
Danger close. Twenty seconds.</i>

1518
01:40:57,990 --> 01:40:59,958
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Let's go! Let's go! Run!

1519
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,429
Run!

1520
01:41:35,061 --> 01:41:36,063
Essex?

1521
01:41:38,631 --> 01:41:40,298
- Jackson?
- Yeah.

1522
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,601
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

1523
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:48,842
Najeeb?

1524
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,047
Najeeb.

1525
01:41:57,917 --> 01:41:58,952
Najeeb.

1526
01:42:03,622 --> 01:42:05,523
Come on, Najeeb. Come on.

1527
01:42:05,525 --> 01:42:06,894
Milo?

1528
01:42:07,994 --> 01:42:08,996
E!

1529
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:17,570
Come on, Najeeb. Come on, bro.
Come on. Come on.

1530
01:42:22,542 --> 01:42:23,875
- Are you okay?
- Go help Jackson.

1531
01:42:23,877 --> 01:42:25,009
- Okay?
- Go help Jackson!

1532
01:42:25,011 --> 01:42:26,813
- Look at me!
- Help Jackson!

1533
01:42:28,347 --> 01:42:29,582
Jackson?

1534
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:32,451
Get up!

1535
01:42:32,453 --> 01:42:35,019
- Get up!
- Come on.

1536
01:42:35,021 --> 01:42:37,522
We gotta go.
We gotta fucking go.

1537
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,761
E!

1538
01:42:42,595 --> 01:42:44,864
All right. All right?

1539
01:42:46,899 --> 01:42:48,268
Najeeb?

1540
01:42:49,403 --> 01:42:52,269
Come on. Let it out, man.
Come on.

1541
01:42:52,271 --> 01:42:54,237
Let it out.

1542
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,340
We gotta go. We gotta go.

1543
01:43:09,856 --> 01:43:11,022
<i>Cap, we lost</i>

1544
01:43:11,024 --> 01:43:13,223
<i>communication with Essex.</i>

1545
01:43:13,225 --> 01:43:15,927
<i>Keep trying them. Listen,
if we don't take out that BM-21,</i>

1546
01:43:15,929 --> 01:43:17,262
<i>this whole thing is over.</i>

1547
01:43:17,264 --> 01:43:19,531
It fires 40 rockets
in salvos. Got it?

1548
01:43:19,533 --> 01:43:22,567
Forty, and then two minutes
to reload. Say it back to me.

1549
01:43:22,569 --> 01:43:24,902
Two minutes.

1550
01:43:24,904 --> 01:43:26,804
That's how long we're gonna have to storm
their positions, but we gotta get closer.

1551
01:43:26,806 --> 01:43:29,706
<i>And hold there
until they stop to reload.</i>

1552
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:31,675
<i>K2 base,
this is Alpha.</i>

1553
01:43:31,677 --> 01:43:34,579
Lead elements
crossing phase line red.

1554
01:43:34,581 --> 01:43:36,115
Anticipate high casualties.

1555
01:46:17,243 --> 01:46:18,910
38, 39.

1556
01:46:18,912 --> 01:46:21,280
They're gonna have to
reload soon. We'll have two...

1557
01:47:09,328 --> 01:47:10,363
Oh, shit!

1558
01:47:31,451 --> 01:47:34,020
- Captain!
- Now's our window. Let's go!

1559
01:48:15,028 --> 01:48:16,396
Contact front!

1560
01:50:38,337 --> 01:50:39,970
Where's Diller?

1561
01:50:39,972 --> 01:50:41,940
<i>Moving to our position.</i>

1562
01:50:41,942 --> 01:50:44,011
<i>Bird incoming in two minutes.</i>

1563
01:50:45,244 --> 01:50:49,215
Copy. Rendezvous at evac sight
and pop smoke.

1564
01:51:43,136 --> 01:51:46,236
Get the horses out of here!
There's a chopper coming.

1565
01:51:46,238 --> 01:51:47,472
How's he doing?

1566
01:51:47,474 --> 01:51:49,440
Cap, I need that medevac
here right now!

1567
01:51:49,442 --> 01:51:51,075
All right, it's coming.
It's coming.

1568
01:51:51,077 --> 01:51:53,311
Chopper's inbound!
Jones, get that smoke out!

1569
01:51:53,313 --> 01:51:55,111
All right, here they come,
buddy. Here they come.

1570
01:51:55,113 --> 01:51:56,880
You hang in there, buddy.

1571
01:51:56,882 --> 01:51:58,449
Did we get them?

1572
01:51:58,451 --> 01:52:00,751
Yeah, man. We got them.
We got them good.

1573
01:52:02,855 --> 01:52:06,193
Hey. Hey, you hang in there.
Don't you quit on us.

1574
01:52:31,818 --> 01:52:34,221
Let's cover him up!
Cover up!

1575
01:52:54,073 --> 01:52:55,438
Okay, ready?

1576
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:58,811
Three, two, one! Up!

1577
01:53:23,368 --> 01:53:25,068
Has anyone seen Dostum?

1578
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:27,071
<i>Eye in the sky says
full retreat over here.</i>

1579
01:53:27,073 --> 01:53:28,572
The whole Gap is clear.

1580
01:53:28,574 --> 01:53:30,206
They're bugging out
all the way from Mazar.

1581
01:53:30,208 --> 01:53:33,544
Does air visual
have eyes on Atta's militia?

1582
01:53:33,546 --> 01:53:35,446
Yeah, they're approaching
from the east.

1583
01:53:35,448 --> 01:53:37,315
Dostum's going for Atta.

1584
01:53:37,317 --> 01:53:38,616
This whole thing falls apart

1585
01:53:38,618 --> 01:53:40,652
if the
Northern Alliance breaks.

1586
01:53:40,654 --> 01:53:44,357
<i>We have to get to Dostum first!
Head to Mazar!</i>

1587
01:53:44,957 --> 01:53:46,493
Let's go!

1588
01:54:39,011 --> 01:54:40,477
General, wait.

1589
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:41,748
General Atta.

1590
01:55:15,747 --> 01:55:18,514
I will let Atta
have the city today.

1591
01:55:18,516 --> 01:55:20,819
Tomorrow, we'll see.

1592
01:55:22,188 --> 01:55:25,022
Well, you made
the right choice.

1593
01:55:25,024 --> 01:55:29,492
Right choice? There are
no right choices here.

1594
01:55:29,494 --> 01:55:35,165
This is Afghanistan.
Graveyard of many empires.

1595
01:55:35,167 --> 01:55:39,937
Today you are our friend,
tomorrow you are our enemy.

1596
01:55:39,939 --> 01:55:43,139
It won't be
any different for you.

1597
01:55:43,141 --> 01:55:47,947
Soon America will become
just another tribe here.

1598
01:55:50,283 --> 01:55:54,084
You will be cowards
if you leave.

1599
01:55:54,086 --> 01:55:57,824
And you will be our enemies
if you stay.

1600
01:56:01,226 --> 01:56:02,893
Just know

1601
01:56:02,895 --> 01:56:05,731
that you will
always be my brother.

1602
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:11,634
When I get into that city,
I will raise your flag.

1603
01:56:11,636 --> 01:56:14,840
It's your city, General.
You raise your own flag.

1604
01:56:15,875 --> 01:56:16,975
Here.

1605
01:56:17,877 --> 01:56:20,309
It's been with me forever.

1606
01:56:20,311 --> 01:56:22,681
- Now it's yours.
- Thank you.

1607
01:56:35,994 --> 01:56:37,096
Yo.

1608
01:56:39,497 --> 01:56:41,701
Thank you
for looking out for me.

1609
01:56:46,773 --> 01:56:49,238
If you cry,
I'm telling everyone.

1610
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:51,441
Shut the fuck up, bro.

1611
01:56:52,878 --> 01:56:54,413
Welcome back!

1612
01:57:04,390 --> 01:57:06,857
Changed
the extraction site, huh?

1613
01:57:06,859 --> 01:57:09,126
Yeah, I didn't think you'd
walked far enough.

1614
01:57:09,128 --> 01:57:10,760
Yeah. I was thinking,
you know what,

1615
01:57:10,762 --> 01:57:12,830
my knees feel way too good.

1616
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:14,630
- Well, they look good.
- Thanks.

1617
01:57:14,632 --> 01:57:16,299
Did you see the medic?

1618
01:57:16,301 --> 01:57:17,603
Yeah.

1619
01:57:23,076 --> 01:57:25,241
Feels good, huh?

1620
01:57:25,243 --> 01:57:28,711
What, sitting down? Awesome.

1621
01:57:28,713 --> 01:57:30,783
No, I mean to finally
see one through.

1622
01:57:33,485 --> 01:57:34,787
Yeah.

1623
01:57:35,555 --> 01:57:37,120
Yeah.

1624
01:57:37,122 --> 01:57:41,357
We won the battle, you know.
Still gotta win the war.

1625
01:57:41,359 --> 01:57:44,661
Yeah. That ain't up to us.

1626
01:57:44,663 --> 01:57:47,063
Ain't our job anyway
though, right?

1627
01:57:47,065 --> 01:57:48,100
Yeah.

1628
01:57:49,536 --> 01:57:51,971
So, where are you going
to point us to next?

1629
01:57:52,872 --> 01:57:55,141
I'm pointing us home.

1630
01:57:56,207 --> 01:57:57,710
I'll follow you there.

1631
01:57:59,645 --> 01:58:01,915
I'll follow you anywhere.

1632
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:05,618
Thank God for that.

1633
01:59:17,288 --> 01:59:19,089
Spencer?

1634
01:59:19,091 --> 01:59:20,924
He's stable.
On his way to Germany.

1635
01:59:20,926 --> 01:59:22,195
You got him here in time.

1636
01:59:25,730 --> 01:59:27,598
Kept your promise.

1637
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:29,536
Yes, sir.

1638
01:59:46,618 --> 01:59:48,285
That's beautiful, Maddy.

1639
01:59:59,265 --> 02:00:02,101
Maddy! Come here!

1640
02:00:02,969 --> 02:00:05,335
Look, Christmas came early!

1641
02:00:05,337 --> 02:00:07,172
Daddy!

1642
02:00:07,196 --> 02:00:10,196
