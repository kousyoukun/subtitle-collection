1
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,145
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:17,272
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:20,025
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,443
Thank you.

5
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:39,670
Mr. Ullman?

6
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:41,130
I'm Jack Torrance.

7
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:43,298
Come on in, Jack.

8
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,927
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

9
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:48,679
This is my secretary, Susie.

10
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,557
-Susie, how do you do?
-Any trouble finding us?

11
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,601
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

12
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,728
That's very good time.

13
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,647
Sit down a minute, Jack.

14
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:00,649
Just make yourself at home.

15
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:02,109
Like some coffee?

16
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:04,820
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

17
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:06,029
-Susie.
-Sure.

18
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:07,948
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

19
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:09,616
Yes, I will.

20
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,587
Mom?

21
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,630
Yeah?

22
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:27,676
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

23
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,636
Sure I do.

24
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:31,805
It'll be lots of fun.

25
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,767
Yeah. I guess so.

26
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:40,147
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

27
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:44,568
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

28
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:48,322
Yeah, I guess so.

29
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:50,115
What about Tony?

30
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,743
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

31
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,662
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

32
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:58,499
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

33
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,876
I don't want to go there.

34
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,378
How come you don't want to go?

35
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,714
I just don't.

36
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:08,717
Let's just wait and see.

37
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,678
We're all going to have
a real good time.

38
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:15,516
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

39
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:17,184
How do you do, Bill?

40
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,353
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure to meet you.

41
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,480
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

42
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:25,818
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

43
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,029
I'd like you to take him around
soon as we're through.

44
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,155
Fine.

45
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,699
Jack is a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,910
Formerly a schoolteacher.

47
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,829
What line of work are you in now?

48
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,622
I'm a writer.

49
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,501
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

50
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,670
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

51
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:47,381
I'm looking for a change.

52
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:51,176
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

53
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,011
...I agree with them.

54
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:55,430
Let's see, where were we?

55
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,225
I was about to explain...

56
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:02,646
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

57
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:06,316
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

58
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:09,319
Do you mind if I ask
why you do that?

59
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:12,990
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

60
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:15,784
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

61
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:18,537
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

62
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:20,914
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

63
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:23,500
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

64
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:26,920
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

65
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,089
...to keep it clear.

66
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,633
When the place was built in 1907...

67
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:34,386
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

68
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:39,475
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

69
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,227
It's certainly got
plenty of that.

70
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,645
That's right.

71
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:47,191
Did they give you
any idea in Denver...

72
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,067
...about what the job entails?

73
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,361
Only in a very general way.

74
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:56,408
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.

75
00:06:56,617 --> 00:07:00,078
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

76
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,289
...and depreciation
which can occur.

77
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:04,958
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

78
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:09,087
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

79
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,007
...repairing damage as it occurs...

80
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:15,052
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

81
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,347
That sounds fine to me.

82
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:21,725
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

83
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:25,103
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

84
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,940
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

85
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:33,612
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

86
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:37,116
I'm outlining a new
writing project.

87
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:40,828
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

88
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:43,330
That's very good, Jack.

89
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:46,792
Because, for some people...

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,752
...solitude...

91
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:50,587
...and isolation...

92
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:53,715
...can, of itself, become a problem.

93
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,135
Not for me.

94
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,888
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

95
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,850
They'll love it.

96
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:04,268
Great.

97
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,399
Before I turn you over to Bill...

98
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:14,111
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

99
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,737
Not to sound melodramatic...

100
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,490
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

101
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,909
...second thoughts about the job.

102
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:23,287
I'm intrigued.

103
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:25,831
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

104
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,002
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

105
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:32,588
I don't believe they did.

106
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:36,884
My predecessor in this job...

107
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:40,846
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

108
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,558
He came up with his wife and
2 little girls of about 8 and 10.

109
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:47,769
He had a good employment record,
good references.

110
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:50,230
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

111
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:53,150
...like a completely
normal individual.

112
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,736
But at some point
during the winter...

113
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:59,531
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

114
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,117
He ran amuck...

115
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:07,706
...and killed his family
with an ax.

116
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:13,629
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

117
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:18,133
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

118
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,178
The police thought...

119
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:25,432
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

120
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:28,685
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

121
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:33,023
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

122
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,530
That is...

123
00:09:39,738 --> 00:09:41,240
...quite a story.

124
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:44,034
Yeah, it is.

125
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:48,455
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

126
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,457
But it did.

127
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:56,255
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

128
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,299
I certainly can.

129
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,386
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

130
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:04,847
...left it for you to tell me.

131
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,767
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

132
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:13,063
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

133
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:18,152
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

134
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,030
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

135
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:26,076
...I¡¦m sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

136
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:29,121
She's a confirmed ghost story...

137
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,748
...and horror film addict.

138
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:40,299
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?

139
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,886
He already did.

140
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:48,056
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

141
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,449
-Hi, babe.
-Hi, hon. How's it going?

142
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:09,244
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.

143
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:12,581
I don't think I can get home
before 9:00 or 10:00.

144
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,291
Sounds like you got the job.

145
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,211
Right. It's a beautiful place.

146
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,505
You and Danny are going to love it.

147
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:23,884
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

148
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,886
I don't know.

149
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,516
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

150
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,143
I don't want to.

151
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:35,103
Please.

152
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:37,481
No.

153
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:39,858
Now, Tony, tell me.

154
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,516
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

155
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:19,231
That's good. Now the other one.

156
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,109
Good boy.

157
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,784
Now, Danny...

158
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:33,287
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

159
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:36,498
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

160
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:41,462
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

161
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:45,466
No.

162
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,052
Do you remember when you were
brushing your teeth?

163
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,929
Yes.

164
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:55,684
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

165
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:02,524
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

166
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:08,989
Can you remember
what you were doing...

167
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:12,117
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

168
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,371
Talking to Tony.

169
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,416
Is Tony one of your animals?

170
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:23,212
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

171
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,923
Tony's his imaginary friend.

172
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:32,262
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

142
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:33,263
No

173
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,183
Why not?

174
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:39,269
Because he hides.

175
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,647
Where does he go?

176
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:44,566
To my stomach.

177
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,530
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

178
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:56,245
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

179
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,332
That's fine.

180
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,876
All right, Danny.

181
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,505
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

182
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:10,050
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

183
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,385
Do I have to?

184
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,887
Yes. I'd like you to.

185
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,849
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

186
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,184
I'll come back and check on you.

187
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:30,070
-Shall we go into the living room?
-Yes.

188
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:35,659
-Please.
-Thank you.

189
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:43,917
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

190
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:48,130
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

191
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:56,013
He seems absolutely fine now.

192
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:57,222
But you should've seen him.

193
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,891
I know.

194
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,809
Kids can scare you to death.

195
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:03,896
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

196
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:06,648
And they look much worse
than they are.

197
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,860
But what was the matter with him?

198
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:14,156
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

199
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:19,244
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

200
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:22,998
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

201
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:26,168
...a kind of self-induced trance.

202
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:28,378
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

203
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:32,341
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

203
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:33,342
No. Thank you.

204
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,221
I'm sure you're right.

205
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:41,558
Have you been in Boulder long?

206
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:43,644
Only about three months.

207
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:47,231
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

208
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:53,028
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

209
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:54,321
Tony.

210
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:58,450
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

211
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:02,913
Let's see....

212
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:06,166
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

213
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,086
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

214
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:11,797
Did he adjust well to school?

215
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,926
He didn't like it too much
at first.

216
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:19,429
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

217
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:24,726
I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

218
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:28,147
What sort of injury did he have?

219
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:30,983
He dislocated his shoulder.

220
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:33,694
How did he manage to do that?

221
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:40,200
It was just one of
those things, you know.

222
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:42,411
Purely an accident.

223
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,206
My husband had been drinking...

224
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:49,710
...and he came home
about three hours late.

225
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:54,590
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

226
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,095
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

227
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:04,600
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

228
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:07,853
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

229
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,105
...you know, in a park
or in the street.

230
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,859
But on this particular occasion...

231
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,695
...my husband just used
too much strength...

232
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:19,490
...and he injured Danny's arm.

233
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:27,039
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said...

234
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:29,875
..."Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

235
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,002
And if I do, you can leave me."

236
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,545
And he didn't.

237
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:38,217
He hasn't had any
alcohol in 5 months.

238
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,248
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

239
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,130
Dad?

240
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:20,634
I'm hungry.

241
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,222
You should've eaten your breakfast.

242
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:28,976
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

243
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:30,769
Okay, Mom.

244
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:36,358
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

245
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,613
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

246
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:45,492
What was the Donner party?

247
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:51,707
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

248
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:55,210
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

249
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:59,631
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

250
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:03,677
You mean they ate each other up?

251
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:06,972
They had to in order to survive.

252
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:08,390
Jack.

253
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,683
Don't worry, Mom.

254
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:14,229
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

255
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:17,065
See, it's okay.

256
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:19,693
He saw it all on the television.

257
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,226
-What time does the plane leave?
-8:30.

258
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:55,229
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

259
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,356
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Bye.

260
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,692
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

261
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:03,529
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

262
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:06,615
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

263
00:20:06,824 --> 00:20:08,534
Is your family
having a look around?

264
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:12,121
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

265
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:15,415
-Has your luggage been brought in?
-Right there.

266
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,960
In view of all we have
to cover today...

267
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:21,839
...l suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

268
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:24,800
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

269
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:27,719
I'd better collect my family first.

270
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:38,230
This is our Colorado Lounge.

271
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,858
It's beautiful.

272
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,110
My God!

273
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:45,904
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?

274
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,448
It sure is.

275
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,451
I've never seen anything
like this before.

276
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:54,037
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

277
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:55,664
I believe they're based...

278
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:59,084
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

279
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:01,253
They're really gorgeous.

280
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:02,463
As a matter of fact...

281
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:05,757
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

282
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,136
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

283
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:12,431
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

284
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,642
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

285
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,896
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

286
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:20,439
Lots of movie stars.

287
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,191
Royalty?

288
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:23,984
All the best people.

289
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,665
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.

290
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:23,961
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

291
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:27,089
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Goodbye, girls.

292
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:29,341
And here are your quarters.

293
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:32,344
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

294
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:35,013
And a small bedroom for your son.

295
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,686
Perfect for a child.

296
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:51,363
Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

297
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:53,115
Easy to keep.

298
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:56,952
Cozy.

299
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:59,413
Yes, very cozy for a family.

300
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:01,331
If you feel like spreading out...

301
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,209
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

302
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:08,338
Well, it's very...

303
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,174
...homey.

304
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:15,345
This is our famous hedge maze.

305
00:23:15,554 --> 00:23:19,850
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

306
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:22,352
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

307
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:25,189
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

308
00:23:25,397 --> 00:23:28,400
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

309
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:31,904
When was the Overlook built?

310
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:35,115
Construction started in 1907.

311
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:37,284
It was finished in 1909.

312
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:40,162
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

313
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,997
They actually had to repel...

314
00:23:42,206 --> 00:23:45,125
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

315
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,628
That's our Snowcat.

316
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:50,339
Can you both drive a car?

317
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:54,426
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

318
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:57,221
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

319
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,809
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

320
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:05,103
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

321
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:07,314
He sure did a beautiful job.

322
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:09,817
Pink and gold
are my favorite colors.

323
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:12,986
This is our Gold Ballroom.

324
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:15,823
I'll say!

325
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:19,827
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

326
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:23,205
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

327
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:27,209
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

328
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,462
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

329
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:33,757
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

330
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:34,925
We don't drink.

331
00:24:35,134 --> 00:24:36,552
Then you're in luck.

332
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,014
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

333
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:43,308
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

334
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:46,270
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

335
00:24:46,478 --> 00:24:47,646
Glad to meet you.

336
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:50,732
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

337
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:54,695
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

338
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:56,738
It's just wonderful.

339
00:24:56,947 --> 00:24:58,490
Hi, Danny!

340
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:02,077
I found him outside
looking for you.

341
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:06,165
Did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

342
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,042
Come on over here.

343
00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:10,419
Thank you, Susie.

344
00:25:10,627 --> 00:25:14,631
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

345
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,717
...while I continue on with Jack.

346
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:19,344
It would be a pleasure.
Right this way.

347
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:21,096
Great. See you later, hon.

348
00:25:21,305 --> 00:25:22,681
Bye, darling.

349
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:28,395
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

350
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:31,106
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

351
00:25:31,315 --> 00:25:32,566
I'm a Wendy.

352
00:25:32,775 --> 00:25:35,986
Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

353
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:37,821
This is the kitchen, huh?

354
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,615
This is it.

355
00:25:39,823 --> 00:25:42,743
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

356
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:45,788
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

357
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:48,373
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

358
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:52,127
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

359
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:54,922
Don't let it get you down.

360
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:57,591
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

361
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,010
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

362
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:02,429
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

363
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:05,766
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

364
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:10,646
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

365
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:13,941
Right here is
our walk-in freezer.

366
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:18,153
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

367
00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:20,364
You got 15 rib roasts...

368
00:26:20,572 --> 00:26:22,699
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

369
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:25,953
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

370
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:29,248
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

371
00:26:29,456 --> 00:26:32,459
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

372
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,046
You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?

373
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:38,132
French fries and ketchup.

374
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:40,843
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

375
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:42,803
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

376
00:26:49,518 --> 00:26:51,103
How'd you know we call him Doc?

377
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:55,315
-Beg your pardon?
-Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

378
00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:56,942
I did?

379
00:26:57,734 --> 00:27:00,863
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

380
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:02,322
But how did you know?

381
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:05,075
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

382
00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:07,536
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

383
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:09,955
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

384
00:27:10,164 --> 00:27:12,332
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

385
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,210
What's up, Doc?

386
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:19,256
Now, this is the storeroom.

387
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,843
In here is where we keep...

388
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,846
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

389
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:28,474
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

390
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:32,478
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

391
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:35,856
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

392
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,110
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

393
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,780
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

394
00:27:42,988 --> 00:27:46,158
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

395
00:27:53,832 --> 00:27:56,293
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

396
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,672
Sociables, finger rolls...

397
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,424
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

398
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:06,178
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

399
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:09,473
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

400
00:28:09,681 --> 00:28:13,977
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

401
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,524
-How're you getting on?
-Fine.

402
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:22,277
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

403
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:24,404
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

404
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:27,825
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

405
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,910
You like ice cream, Doc?

406
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:31,745
I thought you did.

407
00:28:31,912 --> 00:28:34,998
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

408
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:37,042
-Not at all.
-We don't mind.

409
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:39,419
-Good.
-Sound good to you, Doc?

410
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:41,713
Okay, you behave yourself.

411
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:46,593
What kind of ice cream
do you like?

412
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,678
Chocolate.

413
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:50,848
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

414
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:57,396
It's amazing, all this
activity today.

415
00:28:57,604 --> 00:29:00,441
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

416
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:02,067
...last day's always hectic.

417
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:05,320
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

418
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:09,575
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

419
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:11,827
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

420
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:20,461
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

421
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,470
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

422
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:39,938
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

423
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:42,858
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

424
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:46,904
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

425
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:50,282
She called it "shining."

426
00:29:51,784 --> 00:29:54,495
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

427
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:57,331
...that had "the shine" to us.

428
00:29:57,956 --> 00:30:00,959
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

429
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:03,504
But there are other folks...

430
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,424
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

431
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:14,515
How long have you
been able to do it?

432
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:22,147
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

433
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:29,446
I'm not supposed to.

434
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,534
Who says you ain't supposed to?

435
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:38,372
Tony.

436
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:42,000
Who's Tony?

437
00:30:44,503 --> 00:30:47,881
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

438
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:51,844
Is Tony the one
that...

439
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:53,637
...tells you things?

440
00:30:58,183 --> 00:31:00,561
How does he tell you things?

441
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:06,692
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

442
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,988
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

443
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:16,535
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

444
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,374
Do they know he tells you things?

445
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,211
Tony told me never to tell them.

446
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:31,717
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

447
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:34,470
About the Overlook Hotel?

448
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:39,308
I don't know.

449
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:43,020
Now think real hard, Doc.

450
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:44,229
Think.

451
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:50,068
Maybe he showed me something.

452
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:53,655
Try to think of what it was.

453
00:31:56,658 --> 00:31:59,953
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

454
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:05,292
Scared of nothing here.

455
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,252
It's just that...

456
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:10,839
...you know, some places
are like people.

457
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:13,383
Some shine...

458
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:14,968
...and some don't.

459
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,347
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

460
00:32:18,555 --> 00:32:21,850
...has something about it
that's like shining.

461
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:27,314
Is there something bad here?

462
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:41,328
You know, Doc,
when something happens...

463
00:32:41,537 --> 00:32:45,165
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

464
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,501
Say, like...

465
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:50,796
...if someone burns toast.

466
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:57,553
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

467
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,182
Not things that anyone
can notice.

468
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:07,187
But things that people
who shine can see.

469
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:11,567
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

470
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:17,990
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

471
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:22,411
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

472
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:26,331
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

473
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:29,251
And not all of them
was good.

474
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:35,174
What about room 237?

475
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:40,721
Room 237?

476
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:45,142
You're scared of room 237,
ain't you?

477
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:48,395
No, I ain't.

478
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:53,734
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

479
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:56,403
Nothing.

480
00:33:56,862 --> 00:34:00,073
There ain't nothing in room 237.

481
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:03,535
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

482
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:05,871
So stay out.

483
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,540
You understand? Stay out!

484
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:49,641
Good morning, hon.

485
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:53,437
Your breakfast is ready.

486
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:55,814
What time is it?

487
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:57,900
It's about 11:30.

488
00:35:59,818 --> 00:36:01,403
Jesus.

489
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:04,782
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

490
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:06,533
I know it.

491
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:10,704
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

492
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:12,539
Nice.

493
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:16,627
It's really pretty outside.

494
00:36:16,835 --> 00:36:20,047
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

495
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:25,010
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

496
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:28,096
Any ideas yet?

497
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:30,766
Lots of ideas.

498
00:36:30,974 --> 00:36:32,518
No good ones.

499
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:35,437
Something will come.

500
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:39,900
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

501
00:36:41,443 --> 00:36:43,153
That's all it is.

502
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,574
It's really nice up here,
isn't it?

503
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,409
I love it.

504
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,495
I really do.

505
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:55,415
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

506
00:36:55,624 --> 00:36:59,419
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

507
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:02,506
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

508
00:37:02,714 --> 00:37:04,758
...l thought it was kind of scary.

509
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:07,761
I fell in love with it right away.

510
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:11,265
When I came up here
for my interview...

511
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:15,436
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

512
00:37:15,644 --> 00:37:18,272
I mean, we all have moments
of deja vu...

513
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,691
...but this was ridiculous.

514
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:23,277
It was almost as though I knew...

515
00:37:23,485 --> 00:37:27,239
...what was going to be
around every corner.

516
00:38:00,355 --> 00:38:03,567
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

517
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,320
-All right.
-And you're going to lose.

518
00:38:06,528 --> 00:38:09,656
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

519
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:15,788
Look out!

520
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:17,873
I'm coming in close.

521
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:20,584
Loser has to keep America clean.

522
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:22,461
Keep America clean.

523
00:38:23,462 --> 00:38:24,922
Danny, you win.

524
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:27,591
Let's take the rest
of this walking.

525
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:31,512
Give me your hand.

526
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:35,974
Isn't it beautiful?

527
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,077
Dead end.

528
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:54,178
We made it.

529
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:55,888
Isn't it beautiful?

530
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:19,453
It's so pretty.

531
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:26,960
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

532
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:40,641
Rutherford was serving
a life sentence...

533
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:42,601
...for a 1968 shooting.

534
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:46,688
And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.

535
00:40:46,897 --> 00:40:50,275
24-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.

536
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:53,195
She disappeared on a hunting
trip with her husband.

537
00:40:53,403 --> 00:40:56,198
They may have to
call off the search...

538
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:58,951
...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.

539
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,994
It's so beautiful
in Denver today...

540
00:41:01,203 --> 00:41:03,330
...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.

541
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:05,791
I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...

542
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:10,129
...yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.

543
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:11,505
And it's moving...

544
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:14,883
...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.

545
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,950
Hi, hon.

546
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:49,955
How's it going?

547
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:53,667
Fine.

548
00:43:55,794 --> 00:43:57,337
Get a lot written today?

549
00:44:04,386 --> 00:44:06,972
The weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

550
00:44:12,186 --> 00:44:14,521
What do you want me
to do about it?

551
00:44:16,648 --> 00:44:18,817
Come on, hon.

552
00:44:19,151 --> 00:44:21,153
Don't be so grouchy.

553
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:22,905
I'm not...

554
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,490
...being grouchy.

555
00:44:24,698 --> 00:44:27,493
I just want to finish my work.

556
00:44:30,996 --> 00:44:33,373
Okay. I understand.

557
00:44:33,624 --> 00:44:36,210
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

558
00:44:36,418 --> 00:44:38,879
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

559
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:43,175
Wendy...

560
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:46,011
...let me explain something to you.

561
00:44:46,887 --> 00:44:50,766
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

562
00:44:50,974 --> 00:44:52,392
You're distracting me...

563
00:44:52,601 --> 00:44:56,063
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

564
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,689
Understand?

565
00:45:01,151 --> 00:45:02,319
Fine.

566
00:45:03,487 --> 00:45:05,197
We're going to make a new rule:

567
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:06,865
Whenever I'm in here...

568
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:09,326
...and you hear me typing...

569
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,081
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

570
00:45:14,248 --> 00:45:16,583
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

571
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,002
That means don't come in.

572
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:21,463
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

573
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:27,219
Fine.

574
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:31,598
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

575
00:46:07,509 --> 00:46:08,886
All right, you!

576
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:12,139
I know you've got more.

577
00:46:14,224 --> 00:46:15,267
Missed!

578
00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:21,690
Don't have!

579
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,650
No fear anymore.

580
00:47:31,343 --> 00:47:32,636
I knew it.

581
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:06,378
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

582
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:12,593
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

583
00:48:12,801 --> 00:48:15,929
This is KDK 1 .
We're receiving you. Over.

584
00:48:16,305 --> 00:48:19,433
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

585
00:48:20,017 --> 00:48:22,811
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

586
00:48:23,103 --> 00:48:24,438
We're just fine.

587
00:48:24,605 --> 00:48:27,107
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

588
00:48:27,274 --> 00:48:30,319
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

589
00:48:30,944 --> 00:48:34,782
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

590
00:48:35,073 --> 00:48:38,243
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

591
00:48:38,452 --> 00:48:39,620
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

592
00:48:39,828 --> 00:48:43,290
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

593
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:47,169
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

594
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:50,547
Yes. It's one of the worst we've
had for years.

595
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:54,301
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

596
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:56,929
I suppose not. Over.

597
00:48:57,554 --> 00:49:00,849
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

598
00:49:01,058 --> 00:49:02,351
And, Mrs. Torrance?

599
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,772
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

600
00:49:07,606 --> 00:49:09,108
Okay. We'll do that.

601
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:11,360
It was real nice talking to you.

602
00:49:11,568 --> 00:49:14,196
Bye. Over and out.

603
00:49:49,106 --> 00:49:51,316
Hello, Danny.

604
00:49:56,572 --> 00:49:59,032
Come and play with us.

605
00:50:03,871 --> 00:50:06,665
Come and play with us, Danny.

606
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,377
Forever...

607
00:50:12,129 --> 00:50:13,881
...and ever...

608
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,842
...and ever.

609
00:50:48,332 --> 00:50:49,958
Tony...

610
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:53,003
...I¡¦m scared.

611
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:02,054
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

612
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:07,559
It's just like
pictures in a book, Danny.

613
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:09,895
It isn't real.

614
00:51:21,573 --> 00:51:23,408
Please let me give you
some money.

615
00:51:23,617 --> 00:51:25,661
I wouldn't think of it.

616
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:27,162
Well, how can I repay you?

617
00:51:28,122 --> 00:51:30,040
It's okay. Really.

618
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,751
Well, I'm going to have
some coffee.

619
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,503
Would you like some?

620
00:51:36,213 --> 00:51:37,297
Sure.

621
00:51:37,506 --> 00:51:39,341
Great. Sit down.

622
00:51:49,268 --> 00:51:51,895
Marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

623
00:51:53,564 --> 00:51:55,983
Coffee will be ready
in a few minutes.

624
00:51:59,736 --> 00:52:03,073
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

625
00:52:04,533 --> 00:52:07,244
Not right now.
Daddy's asleep.

626
00:52:08,245 --> 00:52:10,372
I won't make any noise.

627
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,709
Now come on, Doc.

628
00:52:13,917 --> 00:52:15,586
He only went to bed
a few hours ago.

629
00:52:15,794 --> 00:52:17,588
Can't you wait till later?

630
00:52:17,796 --> 00:52:20,924
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

631
00:52:24,136 --> 00:52:25,429
All right.

632
00:52:25,637 --> 00:52:28,056
But really don't make a sound.

633
00:52:28,265 --> 00:52:29,725
I won't, Mom.

634
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,269
Make sure you
come right back...

635
00:52:32,478 --> 00:52:34,480
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

636
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:38,108
Okay, Mom.

637
00:53:27,366 --> 00:53:30,536
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

638
00:53:34,289 --> 00:53:36,500
Come here for a minute first.

639
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:15,289
How's it going, Doc?

640
00:54:19,877 --> 00:54:21,670
Having a good time?

641
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:25,215
Yes, Dad.

642
00:54:28,093 --> 00:54:29,344
Good.

643
00:54:31,555 --> 00:54:33,724
I want you to
have a good time.

644
00:54:34,433 --> 00:54:36,059
I am, Dad.

645
00:54:46,487 --> 00:54:48,280
Do you feel bad?

646
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:56,538
I'm just a little bit tired.

647
00:54:58,123 --> 00:55:00,667
Then why don't you
go to sleep?

648
00:55:04,254 --> 00:55:05,798
I can't.

649
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:09,593
I got too much to do.

650
00:55:18,894 --> 00:55:21,146
Do you like this hotel?

651
00:55:27,152 --> 00:55:28,570
I do.

652
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:30,864
I love it.

653
00:55:33,075 --> 00:55:34,409
Don't you?

654
00:55:36,787 --> 00:55:38,288
I guess so.

655
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:42,126
Good.

656
00:55:45,337 --> 00:55:47,673
I want you to like it here.

657
00:55:51,635 --> 00:55:55,013
I wish we could stay here
forever...

658
00:55:55,222 --> 00:55:57,015
...and ever...

659
00:55:57,683 --> 00:55:59,017
...and ever.

660
00:56:04,481 --> 00:56:05,482
What?

661
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:09,862
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

662
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:16,827
What do you mean?

663
00:56:21,957 --> 00:56:24,543
Did your mother ever
say that to you?

664
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:27,045
That I would hurt you?

665
00:56:27,796 --> 00:56:29,173
No, Dad.

666
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:32,885
You sure?

667
00:56:33,427 --> 00:56:35,012
Yes, Dad.

668
00:56:39,808 --> 00:56:41,852
I love you, Danny.

669
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:45,647
I love you
more than anything else...

670
00:56:45,856 --> 00:56:48,400
...in the whole world...

671
00:56:49,193 --> 00:56:52,237
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

672
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:53,781
...never.

673
00:56:54,656 --> 00:56:56,700
You know that, don't you?

674
00:56:57,201 --> 00:56:58,744
Yes, Dad.

675
00:56:59,703 --> 00:57:00,788
Good.

676
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:30,502
Mom, are you in there?

677
00:59:49,748 --> 00:59:50,791
What happened?

678
00:59:50,999 --> 00:59:52,251
Honey...

679
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:54,503
...what's wrong?

680
01:00:02,678 --> 01:00:04,096
I had the most...

681
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:06,890
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

682
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:11,770
-It was the most horrible dream.
-It's okay, it's okay now.

683
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,314
Really.

684
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,195
I dreamed that l...

685
01:00:20,404 --> 01:00:22,823
...that I killed
you and Danny.

686
01:00:25,576 --> 01:00:27,828
But I didn't just kill you.

687
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:31,874
I cut you up
into little pieces.

688
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:36,086
My God.

689
01:00:36,795 --> 01:00:39,339
I must be losing my mind.

690
01:00:41,633 --> 01:00:44,261
Everything's going to be
all right.

691
01:00:46,388 --> 01:00:49,057
Come on. Let's get up
off the floor.

692
01:00:56,899 --> 01:00:59,193
There. Now sit up.

693
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,153
It's okay.

694
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:03,697
It's okay.

695
01:01:07,743 --> 01:01:08,952
Danny!

696
01:01:09,244 --> 01:01:11,205
Everything's okay!

697
01:01:11,413 --> 01:01:14,541
Just go play in your room
for a while.

698
01:01:14,917 --> 01:01:16,960
Your dad's just got
a headache.

699
01:01:18,253 --> 01:01:21,298
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

700
01:01:23,258 --> 01:01:26,220
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

701
01:01:26,428 --> 01:01:27,930
I'll be right back.

702
01:01:29,848 --> 01:01:31,892
Why don't you mind me?

703
01:01:38,524 --> 01:01:40,359
Oh, my God.

704
01:01:41,568 --> 01:01:43,946
What happened to your neck?

705
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:48,033
What happened to your neck?

706
01:02:16,979 --> 01:02:18,981
You did this to him...

707
01:02:19,398 --> 01:02:20,816
...didn't you?!

708
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:24,736
You son of a bitch!

709
01:02:24,945 --> 01:02:26,822
You did this to him!

710
01:02:26,989 --> 01:02:28,449
Didn't you?!

711
01:02:29,783 --> 01:02:31,452
How could you?!

712
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,412
How could you?!

713
01:04:03,293 --> 01:04:06,380
God! I'd give anything
for a drink.

714
01:04:09,007 --> 01:04:11,927
I'd give my goddamn soul...

715
01:04:12,136 --> 01:04:14,596
...for just a glass of beer.

716
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:31,071
Hi, Lloyd.

717
01:04:34,658 --> 01:04:37,035
A little slow tonight,
isn't it?

718
01:04:41,915 --> 01:04:44,168
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

719
01:04:46,253 --> 01:04:47,713
What will it be?

720
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:52,342
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

721
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:55,888
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

722
01:04:56,096 --> 01:04:59,016
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

723
01:04:59,183 --> 01:05:02,478
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

724
01:05:03,187 --> 01:05:04,980
So here's what:

725
01:05:05,314 --> 01:05:07,608
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

726
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:10,611
...a little glass and some ice.

727
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:12,821
You can do that,
can't you, Lloyd?

728
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,657
You're not too busy, are you?

729
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,702
No, sir.
I'm not busy at all.

730
01:05:19,203 --> 01:05:20,788
Good man.

731
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:22,164
You set them up...

732
01:05:22,456 --> 01:05:25,334
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

733
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,379
White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

734
01:05:29,588 --> 01:05:31,757
White man's burden.

735
01:05:37,846 --> 01:05:38,972
Say, Lloyd...

736
01:05:39,181 --> 01:05:41,934
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

737
01:05:42,267 --> 01:05:44,728
How's my credit
in this joint, anyway?

738
01:05:44,978 --> 01:05:47,356
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

739
01:05:48,065 --> 01:05:49,691
That's well.

740
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,568
I like you, Lloyd.

741
01:05:51,777 --> 01:05:53,445
I always liked you.

742
01:05:53,654 --> 01:05:55,989
You were always the best of them.

743
01:05:56,198 --> 01:05:58,575
Best goddamned bartender...

744
01:05:58,742 --> 01:06:01,703
...from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine.

745
01:06:01,912 --> 01:06:04,123
Or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

746
01:06:04,414 --> 01:06:06,208
Thank you for saying so.

747
01:06:08,502 --> 01:06:13,048
Here's to 5 miserable months
on the wagon...

748
01:06:13,257 --> 01:06:17,302
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

749
01:06:35,529 --> 01:06:37,990
How are things going,
Mr. Torrance?

750
01:06:39,324 --> 01:06:41,910
Things could be better.

751
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:46,206
Things could be
a whole lot better.

752
01:06:47,082 --> 01:06:49,418
I hope it's nothing serious.

753
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:54,423
Nothing serious.

754
01:06:56,049 --> 01:06:58,594
Just a little problem with...

755
01:06:58,844 --> 01:07:01,972
...the old sperm bank
upstairs.

756
01:07:02,181 --> 01:07:04,516
Nothing I can't handle,
though.

757
01:07:04,725 --> 01:07:06,435
Thanks.

758
01:07:06,894 --> 01:07:07,895
Women.

759
01:07:08,103 --> 01:07:09,605
Can't live with them...

760
01:07:09,855 --> 01:07:11,648
...can't live without them.

761
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,445
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

762
01:07:16,653 --> 01:07:18,113
Words of...

763
01:07:18,322 --> 01:07:19,823
...wisdom.

764
01:07:31,376 --> 01:07:34,588
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

765
01:07:34,797 --> 01:07:36,423
I didn't.

766
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:43,055
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

767
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,809
I love the little
son of a bitch.

768
01:07:48,393 --> 01:07:51,230
I'd do anything for him.

769
01:07:51,438 --> 01:07:54,233
Any fucking thing for him.

770
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,864
But that bitch!

771
01:08:01,907 --> 01:08:03,575
As long as I live...

772
01:08:03,867 --> 01:08:07,246
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

773
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,716
I did hurt him once, okay?

774
01:08:20,092 --> 01:08:22,136
It was an accident.

775
01:08:22,428 --> 01:08:25,055
Completely unintentional.

776
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:28,559
It could have happened
to anybody.

777
01:08:30,269 --> 01:08:33,730
And it was three goddamn
years ago!

778
01:08:33,939 --> 01:08:36,775
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

779
01:08:36,984 --> 01:08:39,445
All I tried to do was pull him up.

780
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:46,910
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

781
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:48,454
I mean...

782
01:08:48,996 --> 01:08:52,541
...a few extra foot-pounds
of energy...

783
01:08:52,749 --> 01:08:55,586
...per second, per second.

784
01:09:11,685 --> 01:09:13,604
Thank God you're here.

785
01:09:16,815 --> 01:09:19,026
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

786
01:09:19,234 --> 01:09:21,779
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

787
01:09:21,987 --> 01:09:24,531
She tried to strangle Danny.

788
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:29,495
Are you out of your fucking mind?

789
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:33,457
It's the truth! Really.

790
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:35,626
I swear it.
Danny told me.

791
01:09:36,001 --> 01:09:37,836
He went up into
one of the bedrooms.

792
01:09:38,045 --> 01:09:41,507
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

793
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:44,051
She tried to strangle him!

794
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:49,515
Which room was it?

795
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:59,316
From Channel 10 in Miami...

796
01:09:59,525 --> 01:10:01,860
...this is Newswatch
with Glen Rinker...

797
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:06,281
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

798
01:10:06,615 --> 01:10:09,034
Good evening. I'm Glen Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.

799
01:10:09,243 --> 01:10:12,371
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...

800
01:10:12,579 --> 01:10:14,706
...bringing temperatures
to the 90s...

801
01:10:14,915 --> 01:10:18,043
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

802
01:10:18,252 --> 01:10:22,256
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell in just a few hours tonight.

803
01:10:22,464 --> 01:10:24,716
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

804
01:10:24,925 --> 01:10:27,886
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.

805
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,972
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

806
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,932
Railroad tracks are frozen.

807
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:34,184
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...

808
01:10:34,393 --> 01:10:37,938
...at least 3 have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.

809
01:10:38,147 --> 01:10:40,441
The governor of Colorado
is expected...

810
01:10:40,649 --> 01:10:42,401
...to declare
a weather emergency.

811
01:10:42,609 --> 01:10:44,403
The National Guard
might be called out...

812
01:10:44,611 --> 01:10:45,821
...to clear streets and roads.

813
01:10:46,029 --> 01:10:48,240
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...

814
01:10:48,449 --> 01:10:50,451
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

815
01:10:50,659 --> 01:10:53,287
...with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

816
01:10:53,495 --> 01:10:56,498
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

817
01:10:56,707 --> 01:10:58,917
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

818
01:10:59,126 --> 01:11:01,128
Local beaches
should be jammed.

819
01:11:01,295 --> 01:11:03,338
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

820
01:11:03,547 --> 01:11:06,800
...will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.

821
01:16:38,465 --> 01:16:43,095
We're sorry. Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

822
01:16:43,429 --> 01:16:46,557
If you need assistance,
please call the operator.

823
01:17:03,824 --> 01:17:05,659
Yes, it's me.

824
01:17:05,868 --> 01:17:07,286
Thank God.

825
01:17:11,957 --> 01:17:13,709
Did you find anything?

826
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:16,670
No. Nothing at all.

827
01:17:17,254 --> 01:17:20,424
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

828
01:17:23,177 --> 01:17:26,680
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

829
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:28,432
Yes, I did.

830
01:17:28,932 --> 01:17:30,726
And you didn't see anything at all?

831
01:17:30,934 --> 01:17:32,895
Absolutely nothing.

832
01:17:33,103 --> 01:17:34,396
How is he?

833
01:17:34,605 --> 01:17:36,398
He's still asleep.

834
01:17:36,774 --> 01:17:37,900
Good.

835
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:46,825
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

836
01:17:51,288 --> 01:17:53,791
Are you sure it was the right room?

837
01:17:53,999 --> 01:17:57,169
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

838
01:17:57,377 --> 01:17:59,755
He must have gone in that room.

839
01:17:59,963 --> 01:18:02,591
The door was open,
the lights were on.

840
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,596
I just don't understand it.

841
01:18:11,934 --> 01:18:14,937
What about those bruises
on his neck?

842
01:18:17,147 --> 01:18:19,483
Somebody did that to him.

843
01:18:27,741 --> 01:18:29,159
I think...

844
01:18:30,828 --> 01:18:33,413
...he did it to himself.

845
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,629
No.

846
01:18:41,338 --> 01:18:43,340
That's not possible.

847
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:52,307
Once you rule out his version
of what happened...

848
01:18:52,558 --> 01:18:55,144
...there is no other explanation.

849
01:18:55,644 --> 01:18:56,979
Is there?

850
01:18:59,356 --> 01:19:02,234
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode...

851
01:19:02,443 --> 01:19:05,821
...that he had before
we came up here.

852
01:19:06,029 --> 01:19:07,239
Would it?

853
01:19:15,164 --> 01:19:18,167
Whatever the explanation is...

854
01:19:21,587 --> 01:19:23,005
...l think we...

855
01:19:23,213 --> 01:19:25,924
...have to get Danny out of here.

856
01:19:30,721 --> 01:19:32,556
Get him out of here?

857
01:19:36,727 --> 01:19:38,437
You mean...

858
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,440
...just leave the hotel?

859
01:19:50,407 --> 01:19:51,909
It is so...

860
01:19:52,075 --> 01:19:54,536
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

861
01:19:54,745 --> 01:19:57,247
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

862
01:19:57,456 --> 01:20:00,042
When I'm really into my work!

863
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:04,213
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't l?

864
01:20:04,421 --> 01:20:08,133
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.

865
01:20:08,342 --> 01:20:10,427
Any of that appeal to you?

866
01:20:11,637 --> 01:20:14,348
I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

867
01:20:14,556 --> 01:20:18,185
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

868
01:21:36,096 --> 01:21:38,390
Good evening. Forest Service.

869
01:21:38,974 --> 01:21:40,392
My name is Dick Hallorann.

870
01:21:40,601 --> 01:21:43,061
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

871
01:21:43,228 --> 01:21:45,355
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

872
01:21:45,564 --> 01:21:49,151
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

873
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:52,654
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

874
01:21:52,863 --> 01:21:56,450
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

875
01:21:56,658 --> 01:21:59,328
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

876
01:21:59,536 --> 01:22:02,748
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

877
01:22:02,956 --> 01:22:04,625
And with this storm
and everything...

878
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,753
...I¡¦d appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

879
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,922
...just to see if
everything's okay.

880
01:22:10,422 --> 01:22:11,757
I'll be glad to do that.

881
01:22:11,924 --> 01:22:14,760
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

882
01:22:14,927 --> 01:22:16,970
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.

883
01:22:17,179 --> 01:22:18,597
All right, sir.

884
01:22:38,951 --> 01:22:40,911
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

885
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,579
Good evening.

886
01:23:07,146 --> 01:23:08,605
Hi, Lloyd.

887
01:23:08,814 --> 01:23:10,649
Been away, but now I'm back.

888
01:23:10,941 --> 01:23:12,651
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

889
01:23:13,318 --> 01:23:14,319
It's good to see you.

890
01:23:14,528 --> 01:23:17,197
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

891
01:23:17,823 --> 01:23:19,575
What'll it be, sir?

892
01:23:20,367 --> 01:23:22,661
Hair of the dog that bit me.

893
01:23:24,037 --> 01:23:25,706
Bourbon on the rocks.

894
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:27,958
That'll do her.

895
01:23:41,472 --> 01:23:43,724
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

896
01:23:45,184 --> 01:23:47,144
No charge?

897
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:49,772
Your money's no good here.

898
01:23:55,402 --> 01:23:57,154
Orders from the house.

899
01:24:00,365 --> 01:24:02,826
Orders from the house.

900
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:08,082
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

901
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:14,838
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

902
01:24:17,132 --> 01:24:20,094
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

903
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,221
At least, not at this point.

904
01:24:27,017 --> 01:24:29,436
Anything you say, Lloyd.

905
01:24:29,853 --> 01:24:31,855
Anything you say.

906
01:24:44,827 --> 01:24:47,287
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

907
01:24:48,413 --> 01:24:49,873
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

908
01:24:50,082 --> 01:24:52,626
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

909
01:24:53,877 --> 01:24:57,506
That's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

910
01:24:57,714 --> 01:25:00,509
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

911
01:25:00,717 --> 01:25:01,844
Advocaat, is it?

912
01:25:02,052 --> 01:25:04,221
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...

913
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,598
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

914
01:25:06,807 --> 01:25:09,351
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

915
01:25:10,185 --> 01:25:13,480
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...

916
01:25:13,689 --> 01:25:14,690
...Jeevesy old boy.

917
01:25:14,898 --> 01:25:18,068
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

918
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,779
Awfully nice of you to say.

919
01:25:21,196 --> 01:25:24,074
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

920
01:25:24,283 --> 01:25:26,535
...before the fish and
goose soiree.

921
01:25:26,743 --> 01:25:28,787
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

922
01:25:28,996 --> 01:25:30,330
Here. I'll just...

923
01:25:31,123 --> 01:25:33,375
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

924
01:25:33,584 --> 01:25:35,377
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

925
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:40,048
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

926
01:25:40,257 --> 01:25:41,508
All right. I'll just...

927
01:25:41,717 --> 01:25:45,929
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

928
01:25:46,513 --> 01:25:47,931
Won't keep you a moment.

929
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:49,516
Fine.

930
01:25:52,603 --> 01:25:54,271
What do they call you,
Jeevesy?

931
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,024
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

932
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:02,654
Grady?

933
01:26:02,863 --> 01:26:04,198
Yes, sir.

934
01:26:05,365 --> 01:26:06,700
Delbert Grady.

935
01:26:06,867 --> 01:26:08,410
That's right, sir.

936
01:26:17,127 --> 01:26:18,545
Mr. Grady...

937
01:26:19,338 --> 01:26:21,423
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

938
01:26:21,632 --> 01:26:24,343
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

939
01:26:31,391 --> 01:26:33,227
It's coming off now, sir.

940
01:26:38,148 --> 01:26:39,691
Mr. Grady...

941
01:26:41,235 --> 01:26:43,695
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

942
01:26:43,904 --> 01:26:46,698
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

943
01:26:49,743 --> 01:26:53,080
You a married man, are you,
Mr. Grady?

944
01:26:53,288 --> 01:26:54,081
Yes, sir.

945
01:26:54,289 --> 01:26:57,584
I have a wife and
two daughters, sir.

946
01:26:58,627 --> 01:27:00,129
And...

947
01:27:01,797 --> 01:27:03,090
...where are they now?

948
01:27:03,298 --> 01:27:07,344
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

949
01:27:18,021 --> 01:27:20,441
You were the caretaker here.

950
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,902
I recognize you.

951
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:28,323
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

952
01:27:28,782 --> 01:27:30,534
You...

953
01:27:30,993 --> 01:27:34,538
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

954
01:27:35,038 --> 01:27:36,457
And...

955
01:27:37,082 --> 01:27:39,001
...then you blew your brains out.

956
01:27:48,927 --> 01:27:50,679
That's strange, sir.

957
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,433
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

958
01:27:58,103 --> 01:27:59,980
Mr. Grady...

959
01:28:00,397 --> 01:28:03,734
...you were the caretaker here.

960
01:28:11,533 --> 01:28:14,328
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

961
01:28:16,205 --> 01:28:17,915
But you...

962
01:28:18,665 --> 01:28:20,501
...are the caretaker.

963
01:28:22,753 --> 01:28:25,672
You've always been the caretaker.

964
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:30,385
I should know, sir.

965
01:28:31,845 --> 01:28:34,431
I've always been here.

966
01:28:52,658 --> 01:28:54,868
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

967
01:28:55,077 --> 01:28:56,870
...that your son...

968
01:28:57,246 --> 01:28:59,957
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

969
01:29:00,165 --> 01:29:02,376
...into this situation?

970
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,630
Did you know that?

971
01:29:12,886 --> 01:29:14,972
He is, Mr. Torrance.

972
01:29:17,307 --> 01:29:18,475
Who?

973
01:29:20,727 --> 01:29:22,354
A nigger.

974
01:29:26,442 --> 01:29:27,818
A nigger?

975
01:29:30,571 --> 01:29:31,989
A nigger...

976
01:29:32,197 --> 01:29:33,282
...cook.

977
01:29:39,788 --> 01:29:41,081
How?

978
01:29:43,333 --> 01:29:45,127
Your son...

979
01:29:45,544 --> 01:29:48,338
...has a very great talent.

980
01:29:49,298 --> 01:29:52,801
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

981
01:29:53,552 --> 01:29:56,805
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

982
01:29:57,014 --> 01:29:58,974
...against your will.

983
01:30:07,483 --> 01:30:08,776
Well...

984
01:30:11,528 --> 01:30:14,615
...he is a very willful boy.

985
01:30:17,034 --> 01:30:19,411
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

986
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,498
A very willful boy.

987
01:30:22,706 --> 01:30:24,041
A rather...

988
01:30:24,249 --> 01:30:25,793
...naughty boy...

989
01:30:26,001 --> 01:30:29,171
...if I may be so bold, sir.

990
01:30:36,428 --> 01:30:38,180
It's his mother.

991
01:30:40,349 --> 01:30:41,809
She...

992
01:30:42,017 --> 01:30:44,019
...interferes.

993
01:30:47,106 --> 01:30:50,192
Perhaps they need a good...

994
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,027
...talking-to.

995
01:30:52,444 --> 01:30:53,278
If...

996
01:30:53,487 --> 01:30:56,240
...you don't mind my saying so.

997
01:30:57,074 --> 01:30:58,700
Perhaps...

998
01:30:59,243 --> 01:31:00,911
...a bit more.

999
01:31:04,123 --> 01:31:05,374
My girls, sir...

1000
01:31:05,582 --> 01:31:09,378
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

1001
01:31:10,045 --> 01:31:13,924
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

1002
01:31:14,133 --> 01:31:16,802
...and tried to burn it down.

1003
01:31:17,886 --> 01:31:19,555
But l...

1004
01:31:19,763 --> 01:31:21,723
...corrected them, sir.

1005
01:31:23,058 --> 01:31:27,187
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

1006
01:31:27,396 --> 01:31:28,647
...l...

1007
01:31:29,648 --> 01:31:31,733
...corrected her.

1008
01:31:45,998 --> 01:31:47,958
We have the Snowcat.

1009
01:31:51,336 --> 01:31:53,130
If the weather breaks...

1010
01:31:53,297 --> 01:31:55,090
...we might just be able...

1011
01:31:55,299 --> 01:31:57,134
...to get down the mountain.

1012
01:32:00,012 --> 01:32:02,973
I could call
the forest rangers first...

1013
01:32:03,182 --> 01:32:04,475
...and...

1014
01:32:04,808 --> 01:32:06,685
...tell them that we're coming...

1015
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:08,228
....so that...

1016
01:32:08,437 --> 01:32:12,524
...they could start searching
for us in case we didn't make it.

1017
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,447
And if Jack won't come with us...

1018
01:32:20,949 --> 01:32:24,661
...I¡¦ll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.

1019
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:26,830
That's all there is to it.

1020
01:32:28,207 --> 01:32:29,708
Redrum.

1021
01:32:30,667 --> 01:32:32,336
Redrum.

1022
01:32:43,597 --> 01:32:44,765
What's the matter, hon?

1023
01:32:44,973 --> 01:32:45,849
Redrum!

1024
01:32:46,058 --> 01:32:48,143
Are you having a bad dream?

1025
01:32:54,066 --> 01:32:55,317
Hon?

1026
01:33:01,115 --> 01:33:05,035
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.

1027
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:11,542
Come on, hon.

1028
01:33:12,543 --> 01:33:13,961
Wake up.

1029
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,172
You just had a bad dream.

1030
01:33:18,549 --> 01:33:20,717
Everything's okay.

1031
01:33:24,763 --> 01:33:28,642
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.

1032
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:39,903
Wake up!

1033
01:33:41,113 --> 01:33:42,406
Come on.

1034
01:33:42,614 --> 01:33:44,158
Right now.

1035
01:33:44,616 --> 01:33:45,993
Wake up!

1036
01:33:50,038 --> 01:33:54,042
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

1037
01:34:04,178 --> 01:34:07,055
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1038
01:34:07,264 --> 01:34:10,184
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1039
01:34:10,476 --> 01:34:12,269
Are you receiving me?

1040
01:34:15,481 --> 01:34:18,901
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1041
01:34:19,276 --> 01:34:22,070
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1042
01:34:22,279 --> 01:34:23,947
Do you read me?

1043
01:34:28,327 --> 01:34:31,330
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1044
01:34:31,538 --> 01:34:34,124
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1045
01:34:34,333 --> 01:34:36,085
Are you receiving me?

1046
01:35:12,538 --> 01:35:14,373
Good evening. Forest service.

1047
01:35:14,581 --> 01:35:16,834
This is Dick Hallorann again.

1048
01:35:17,042 --> 01:35:20,129
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

1049
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:25,175
We tried to contact them several
times but they didn't answer.

1050
01:35:25,384 --> 01:35:28,971
Maybe they got their radio
turned off or they can't hear it.

1051
01:35:29,179 --> 01:35:32,057
If you'd like, I'd be glad
to try again later on.

1052
01:35:32,558 --> 01:35:34,685
That's very nice of you.

1053
01:35:34,893 --> 01:35:36,687
I'll call you back later.

1054
01:35:36,895 --> 01:35:37,896
Bye.

1055
01:36:24,985 --> 01:36:28,030
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?

1056
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:30,407
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

1057
01:36:30,616 --> 01:36:32,201
Thank you very much.

1058
01:37:36,098 --> 01:37:37,057
Durkin's Garage.

1059
01:37:37,224 --> 01:37:38,350
Can I speak to Larry?

1060
01:37:38,559 --> 01:37:39,560
Speaking.

1061
01:37:39,852 --> 01:37:42,354
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.

1062
01:37:42,604 --> 01:37:44,273
Dick! How you doing?

1063
01:37:44,481 --> 01:37:45,858
How's the weather down there?

1064
01:37:46,066 --> 01:37:49,194
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

1065
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:51,196
What are you doing there?

1066
01:37:51,613 --> 01:37:55,075
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.

1067
01:37:55,242 --> 01:37:56,869
What's the weather like there?

1068
01:37:57,536 --> 01:38:00,414
The snowplows are keeping things
moving in town...

1069
01:38:00,581 --> 01:38:02,541
...but the mountain roads
are blocked.

1070
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:05,753
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat
to get up there.

1071
01:38:05,961 --> 01:38:07,796
Can you fix me up with one?

1072
01:38:08,005 --> 01:38:10,090
What's the big deal
about getting there today...

1073
01:38:10,299 --> 01:38:11,884
...especially in this weather?

1074
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:16,221
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem...

1075
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:18,640
...with the people taking care
of the place.

1076
01:38:18,849 --> 01:38:22,728
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.

1077
01:38:22,936 --> 01:38:24,730
Ullman phoned me last night.

1078
01:38:24,938 --> 01:38:28,275
And I'm supposed to find out
if they have to be replaced.

1079
01:38:29,777 --> 01:38:31,779
How long will it take you
to get here?

1080
01:38:32,112 --> 01:38:33,781
About five hours.

1081
01:38:33,989 --> 01:38:36,241
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.

1082
01:38:36,742 --> 01:38:38,452
Okay, I'll take care of it.

1083
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:41,497
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.

1084
01:38:41,705 --> 01:38:44,249
That's all right. Drive carefully.

1085
01:38:50,005 --> 01:38:53,300
You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.

1086
01:38:53,467 --> 01:38:56,053
And we have a bad day out there.

1087
01:38:56,261 --> 01:38:59,640
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.

1088
01:38:59,807 --> 01:39:01,308
Many mountain passes...

1089
01:39:01,517 --> 01:39:04,394
... Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...

1090
01:39:04,603 --> 01:39:07,898
...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.

1091
01:39:08,107 --> 01:39:09,775
We hear from the news department...

1092
01:39:09,983 --> 01:39:13,153
...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...

1093
01:39:13,362 --> 01:39:14,947
...and with storms like this...

1094
01:39:15,155 --> 01:39:19,326
...l guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.

1095
01:39:19,493 --> 01:39:22,329
The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...

1096
01:39:22,538 --> 01:39:24,998
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...

1097
01:39:25,207 --> 01:39:28,001
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.

1098
01:39:28,210 --> 01:39:29,586
Get the cows in the barn.

1099
01:39:51,066 --> 01:39:52,151
Hon?

1100
01:39:57,114 --> 01:39:59,533
Listen to me
for a minute, will you?

1101
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:07,040
I'm just going to go and
talk to Daddy for a few minutes...

1102
01:40:07,249 --> 01:40:09,293
...and I'll be right back.

1103
01:40:10,252 --> 01:40:12,796
I want you to just stay here...

1104
01:40:13,005 --> 01:40:15,507
...and watch your cartoons, okay?

1105
01:40:18,594 --> 01:40:20,095
Okay, hon?

1106
01:40:23,390 --> 01:40:26,226
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.

1107
01:40:35,027 --> 01:40:36,236
All right.

1108
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,200
I'll be back
in just about five minutes.

1109
01:40:41,992 --> 01:40:44,328
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.

1110
01:44:10,701 --> 01:44:12,369
How do you like it?

1111
01:44:19,001 --> 01:44:20,502
How do you like it?

1112
01:44:30,471 --> 01:44:33,140
What are you doing down here?

1113
01:44:37,519 --> 01:44:39,855
I just...

1114
01:44:40,314 --> 01:44:41,356
...wanted...

1115
01:44:41,774 --> 01:44:43,525
...to talk to you.

1116
01:44:45,903 --> 01:44:47,154
Okay.

1117
01:44:47,738 --> 01:44:49,239
Let's talk.

1118
01:44:59,041 --> 01:45:01,043
What do you want to talk about?

1119
01:45:08,926 --> 01:45:12,096
I can't really remember.

1120
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:15,057
You can't remember.

1121
01:45:15,849 --> 01:45:17,184
No...

1122
01:45:17,559 --> 01:45:18,936
...l can't.

1123
01:45:24,274 --> 01:45:27,528
Maybe it was about Danny?

1124
01:45:29,905 --> 01:45:32,574
Maybe it was about him.

1125
01:45:36,245 --> 01:45:39,540
I think we should discuss Danny.

1126
01:45:42,334 --> 01:45:44,128
I think...

1127
01:45:44,545 --> 01:45:48,298
...we should discuss
what should be done with him.

1128
01:45:53,011 --> 01:45:55,597
What should be done with him?

1129
01:46:00,602 --> 01:46:02,396
I don't know.

1130
01:46:02,896 --> 01:46:04,898
I don't think that's true.

1131
01:46:05,107 --> 01:46:07,693
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

1132
01:46:07,901 --> 01:46:09,611
...about what should be done
with Danny.

1133
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:12,406
And I'd like to know
what they are.

1134
01:46:14,324 --> 01:46:16,118
Well, l...

1135
01:46:16,410 --> 01:46:20,831
...l think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

1136
01:46:20,998 --> 01:46:24,334
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1137
01:46:26,545 --> 01:46:29,882
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1138
01:46:30,549 --> 01:46:31,884
As soon as possible?

1139
01:46:32,509 --> 01:46:34,845
"As soon as possible?"

1140
01:46:37,514 --> 01:46:38,932
Please.

1141
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:43,604
You believe his health
might be at stake.

1142
01:46:45,189 --> 01:46:46,690
Yes.

1143
01:46:48,066 --> 01:46:50,694
And you are concerned about him.

1144
01:46:53,238 --> 01:46:55,491
And are you concerned about me?

1145
01:46:56,325 --> 01:46:57,493
Of course I am.

1146
01:46:57,701 --> 01:46:59,912
Of course you are!

1147
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:03,248
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

1148
01:47:03,457 --> 01:47:04,958
What are you talking about?

1149
01:47:05,167 --> 01:47:08,003
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

1150
01:47:08,212 --> 01:47:10,255
...thought about
my responsibilities?

1151
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,716
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

1152
01:47:12,925 --> 01:47:15,719
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

1153
01:47:16,011 --> 01:47:17,846
Has it ever occurred to you...

1154
01:47:18,055 --> 01:47:21,517
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1st?

1155
01:47:21,767 --> 01:47:23,811
Does it matter to you at all...

1156
01:47:24,019 --> 01:47:27,106
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

1157
01:47:27,314 --> 01:47:30,442
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

1158
01:47:30,651 --> 01:47:33,237
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

1159
01:47:33,737 --> 01:47:35,739
Do you have the slightest idea...

1160
01:47:35,948 --> 01:47:39,201
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

1161
01:47:39,576 --> 01:47:42,663
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

1162
01:47:42,871 --> 01:47:45,290
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

1163
01:47:45,457 --> 01:47:47,751
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

1164
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:49,503
Stay away from me!

1165
01:47:50,379 --> 01:47:51,422
Why?

1166
01:47:51,755 --> 01:47:54,716
I just want to go back to my room.

1167
01:47:54,925 --> 01:47:56,176
Why?

1168
01:47:56,802 --> 01:47:57,678
Well...

1169
01:47:58,804 --> 01:48:00,848
...I¡¦m very confused.

1170
01:48:01,974 --> 01:48:05,644
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

1171
01:48:06,687 --> 01:48:10,649
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

1172
01:48:10,816 --> 01:48:13,610
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

1173
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:16,071
Stay away from me!

1174
01:48:16,405 --> 01:48:17,698
Please!

1175
01:48:18,490 --> 01:48:19,533
Don't hurt me.

1176
01:48:19,742 --> 01:48:21,076
I'm not going to hurt you.

1177
01:48:21,285 --> 01:48:22,453
Stay away from me!

1178
01:48:22,661 --> 01:48:23,537
Stay away!

1179
01:48:23,746 --> 01:48:24,747
Darling.

1180
01:48:24,955 --> 01:48:26,498
Light of my life.

1181
01:48:26,957 --> 01:48:28,292
I'm not going to hurt you.

1182
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,461
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

1183
01:48:30,669 --> 01:48:32,880
I said,
"I'm not going to hurt you."

1184
01:48:33,088 --> 01:48:35,841
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

1185
01:48:36,133 --> 01:48:39,094
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

1186
01:48:40,179 --> 01:48:41,722
Stay away from me!

1187
01:48:42,222 --> 01:48:43,265
Stay away from me!

1188
01:48:43,474 --> 01:48:45,851
I'm not going to hurt you.

1189
01:48:46,143 --> 01:48:47,644
Stay away from me!

1190
01:48:47,895 --> 01:48:48,979
Stay away!

1191
01:48:49,855 --> 01:48:51,064
Please!

1192
01:48:52,107 --> 01:48:53,859
Stop swinging the bat.

1193
01:48:54,067 --> 01:48:55,360
Stay away from me.

1194
01:48:56,111 --> 01:48:57,404
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1195
01:48:57,613 --> 01:48:59,114
Stop it!

1196
01:49:00,574 --> 01:49:01,700
Give me the bat.

1197
01:49:01,909 --> 01:49:03,035
Please!

1198
01:49:03,285 --> 01:49:05,496
-Stay away!
-Give me the bat.

1199
01:49:05,704 --> 01:49:06,747
Stop it!

1200
01:49:06,997 --> 01:49:08,415
Give me the bat.

1201
01:49:08,749 --> 01:49:10,375
-Stay away from me.
-Stop swinging the bat.

1202
01:49:10,584 --> 01:49:11,960
Please stop!

1203
01:49:12,169 --> 01:49:13,378
Give me the bat.

1204
01:49:13,545 --> 01:49:14,797
Stay away from me.

1205
01:49:15,047 --> 01:49:17,424
-Stop it!
-Give me the bat.

1206
01:49:18,842 --> 01:49:19,843
Goddamn--!

1207
01:50:35,169 --> 01:50:36,837
What are you doing?

1208
01:50:39,673 --> 01:50:41,133
Wait a minute.

1209
01:50:42,509 --> 01:50:44,511
What are you doing?

1210
01:50:47,347 --> 01:50:48,599
What are you doing?

1211
01:51:02,488 --> 01:51:03,989
Wait a minute!

1212
01:51:06,366 --> 01:51:07,951
What are you doing?

1213
01:51:08,202 --> 01:51:09,912
Open the door!

1214
01:51:11,205 --> 01:51:12,247
Goddamn it!

1215
01:51:12,456 --> 01:51:16,001
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

1216
01:51:19,713 --> 01:51:20,964
Wendy, listen.

1217
01:51:21,381 --> 01:51:24,343
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

1218
01:51:24,551 --> 01:51:27,012
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.

1219
01:51:41,693 --> 01:51:43,070
Baby.

1220
01:51:44,238 --> 01:51:47,574
I think you hurt my head
real bad.

1221
01:51:49,159 --> 01:51:50,828
I'm dizzy.

1222
01:51:51,829 --> 01:51:54,039
I need a doctor.

1223
01:52:00,921 --> 01:52:02,089
Honey.

1224
01:52:04,758 --> 01:52:07,094
Don't leave me in here.

1225
01:52:15,727 --> 01:52:17,604
I'm going to go now.

1226
01:52:20,691 --> 01:52:22,526
I'm going to try...

1227
01:52:22,734 --> 01:52:25,738
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

1228
01:52:26,447 --> 01:52:28,782
...in the Snowcat today.

1229
01:52:31,034 --> 01:52:32,870
I'll bring back a doctor.

1230
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:40,127
I'm going to go now.

1231
01:52:47,551 --> 01:52:51,346
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

1232
01:52:52,806 --> 01:52:55,434
You're not going anywhere.

1233
01:52:57,102 --> 01:53:01,231
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

1234
01:53:05,861 --> 01:53:07,529
Go check it out.

1235
01:53:09,698 --> 01:53:11,867
Go check it out!

1236
01:53:15,245 --> 01:53:17,164
Go check it out.

1237
01:55:05,022 --> 01:55:07,441
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

1238
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:10,152
Delbert Grady.

1239
01:55:11,695 --> 01:55:13,280
Grady?

1240
01:55:33,675 --> 01:55:35,511
Hello, Grady.

1241
01:55:40,182 --> 01:55:41,975
Mr. Torrance...

1242
01:55:43,894 --> 01:55:47,648
...l see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

1243
01:55:48,357 --> 01:55:50,859
...business we discussed.

1244
01:55:57,574 --> 01:56:00,536
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1245
01:56:01,370 --> 01:56:05,457
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

1246
01:56:06,333 --> 01:56:09,044
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

1247
01:56:09,545 --> 01:56:11,380
I wonder.

1248
01:56:12,548 --> 01:56:14,675
I have my doubts.

1249
01:56:15,884 --> 01:56:20,097
I, and others, have come
to believe...

1250
01:56:20,305 --> 01:56:23,308
...that your heart is not in this.

1251
01:56:23,934 --> 01:56:26,478
That you haven't the belly for it.

1252
01:56:32,651 --> 01:56:36,947
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

1253
01:56:37,781 --> 01:56:39,742
That's all I ask.

1254
01:56:41,285 --> 01:56:45,539
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

1255
01:56:45,748 --> 01:56:47,207
Somewhat more...

1256
01:56:47,416 --> 01:56:49,376
...resourceful.

1257
01:56:49,626 --> 01:56:52,421
She seems to have got
the better of you.

1258
01:56:55,632 --> 01:56:58,302
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

1259
01:56:59,052 --> 01:57:01,221
Only for the moment.

1260
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:07,269
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

1261
01:57:07,561 --> 01:57:11,231
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

1262
01:57:11,815 --> 01:57:13,358
I fear...

1263
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:16,195
...that is the only thing to do.

1264
01:57:19,656 --> 01:57:21,784
There's nothing
I look forward to...

1265
01:57:21,992 --> 01:57:25,871
...with greater pleasure,
Mr. Grady.

1266
01:57:27,289 --> 01:57:30,000
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

1267
01:57:31,502 --> 01:57:33,504
I give you my word.

1268
01:58:45,617 --> 01:58:48,203
Redrum.

1269
01:58:49,121 --> 01:58:51,707
Redrum.

1270
02:00:59,668 --> 02:01:01,211
Danny, stop it!

1271
02:01:58,018 --> 02:01:59,478
I'm home.

1272
02:02:36,849 --> 02:02:39,685
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1273
02:03:05,252 --> 02:03:07,129
I can't get out.

1274
02:03:07,921 --> 02:03:09,047
Run!

1275
02:03:09,923 --> 02:03:11,341
Run and hide!

1276
02:03:11,884 --> 02:03:13,010
Run!

1277
02:03:13,218 --> 02:03:14,428
Quick!

1278
02:03:16,138 --> 02:03:20,684
Little pigs, little pigs,
let me come in.

1279
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:29,818
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

1280
02:03:31,361 --> 02:03:33,405
Then I'll huff...

1281
02:03:33,614 --> 02:03:35,532
...and I'll puff...

1282
02:03:35,741 --> 02:03:37,785
...and I'll blow your house in!

1283
02:03:52,716 --> 02:03:54,093
Please!

1284
02:03:54,802 --> 02:03:56,595
Don't!

1285
02:03:57,262 --> 02:03:58,764
