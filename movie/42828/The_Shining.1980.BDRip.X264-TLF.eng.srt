1
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:14,147
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,285
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:19,011
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:20,450
Thank you.

5
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:38,671
Mr. Ullman?

6
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,137
I'm Jack Torrance.

7
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:42,311
Come on in, Jack.

8
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:45,938
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

9
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:47,673
This is my secretary, Susie.

10
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:50,575
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?

11
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:53,620
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

12
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:55,723
That's very good time.

13
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,651
Sit down a minute, Jack.

14
00:03:57,894 --> 00:03:59,657
Just make yourself at home.

15
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:01,125
Like some coffee?

16
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:03,822
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

17
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,023
- Susie.
- Sure.

18
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:06,964
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

19
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,603
Yes, I will.

20
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:20,608
Mom?

21
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:22,644
Yeah?

22
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:26,682
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

23
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,655
Sure I do.

24
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:30,792
It'll be lots of fun.

25
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:34,755
Yeah. I guess so.

26
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:39,129
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

27
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:43,428
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

28
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,339
Yeah, I guess so.

29
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:49,135
What about Tony?

30
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:51,610
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

31
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,648
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

32
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:57,349
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

33
00:04:57,887 --> 00:04:59,718
I don't want to go there.

34
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:02,291
How come you don't want to go?

35
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,525
I just don't.

36
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,592
Did they give you
any idea in Denver...

37
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:09,458
...about what the job entails?

38
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,759
Only in a very general way.

39
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:16,831
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.

40
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,498
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

41
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,701
...and depreciation
which can occur.

42
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:25,346
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

43
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:29,507
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

44
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:32,244
...repairing damage as it occurs...

45
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:35,447
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

46
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:38,687
That sounds fine to me.

47
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:42,131
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

48
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:45,495
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

49
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:48,159
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

50
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,001
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

51
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:57,472
I'm outlining a new
writing project.

52
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:01,080
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

53
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,580
That's very good, Jack.

54
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:07,050
Because, for some people...

55
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:09,020
...solitude...

56
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:10,852
...and isolation...

57
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,992
...can, of itself, become a problem.

58
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,390
Not for me.

59
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:20,164
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

60
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:23,131
They'll love it.

61
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:24,533
Great.

62
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:30,675
Before I turn you over to Bill...

63
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,372
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

64
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:36,017
Not to sound melodramatic...

65
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,779
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

66
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:41,183
...second thoughts about the job.

67
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,552
I'm intrigued.

68
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,092
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

69
00:06:46,296 --> 00:06:50,255
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

70
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:52,858
I don't believe they did.

71
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:57,133
My predecessor in this job...

72
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:01,105
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

73
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:04,838
He came up with his wife and
two little girls of about 8 and 10.

74
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:08,040
He had a good employment record,
good references.

75
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,515
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

76
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,416
...like a completely
normal individual.

77
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:15,989
But at some point
during the winter...

78
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:19,821
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

79
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:22,395
He ran amuck...

80
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,997
...and killed his family
with an ax.

81
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:33,902
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

82
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:38,408
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

83
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:41,446
The police thought...

84
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:45,712
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

85
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:48,948
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

86
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:53,289
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

87
00:07:58,368 --> 00:07:59,801
That is...

88
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:01,527
...quite a story.

89
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,306
Yeah, it is.

90
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:08,707
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

91
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:10,740
But it did.

92
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:16,542
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

93
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,577
I certainly can.

94
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:22,649
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

95
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:25,123
...left it for you to tell me.

96
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,025
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

97
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:33,328
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

98
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:38,439
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

99
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:42,304
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

100
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:46,346
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

101
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:49,382
She's a confirmed ghost story...

102
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:52,020
...and horror film addict.

103
00:08:56,859 --> 00:09:00,556
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?

104
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:04,160
He already did.

105
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:08,332
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

106
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:25,714
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, hon. How's it going?

107
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:29,517
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.

108
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:32,854
I don't think I can get home
before 9:00 or 10:00.

109
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:34,552
Sounds like you got the job.

110
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:37,460
Right. It's a beautiful place.

111
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,794
You and Danny are going to love it.

112
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:44,172
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

113
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,169
I don't know.

114
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:50,770
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

115
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:53,406
I don't want to.

116
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:55,379
Please.

117
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:57,745
No.

118
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:00,147
Now, Tony, tell me.

119
00:10:57,313 --> 00:11:01,477
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

120
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:08,351
Dad?

121
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,855
I'm hungry.

122
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:17,427
You should've eaten your breakfast.

123
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:21,168
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

124
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,998
Okay, Mom.

125
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,570
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

126
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:33,805
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

127
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:37,718
What was the Donner party?

128
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:43,921
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

129
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,425
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

130
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,828
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

131
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:55,870
You mean they ate each other up?

132
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:59,166
They had to in order to survive.

133
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,603
Jack.

134
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,902
Don't worry, Mom.

135
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:06,445
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

136
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:09,277
See, it's okay.

137
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:11,919
He saw it all on the television.

138
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:44,449
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.

139
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:47,418
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

140
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:49,557
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.

141
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,887
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

142
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:55,723
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

143
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:58,833
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

144
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:00,764
Is your family
having a look around?

145
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,337
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

146
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,634
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.

147
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:10,179
In view of all we have
to cover today...

148
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,042
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

149
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,014
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

150
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,916
I'd better collect my family first.

151
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:30,430
This is our Colorado Lounge.

152
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,067
It's beautiful.

153
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:35,334
My God!

154
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:38,098
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?

155
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:39,638
It sure is.

156
00:14:32,562 --> 00:14:35,122
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.

157
00:14:36,098 --> 00:14:39,431
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

158
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:42,570
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.

159
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:44,796
And here are your quarters.

160
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,801
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

161
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,501
And a small bedroom for your son.

162
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,141
Perfect for a child.

163
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:06,787
When was the Overlook built?

164
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:10,027
Construction started in 1907.

165
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:12,200
It was finished in 1909.

166
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:15,063
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

167
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:16,898
They actually had to repel...

168
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:20,007
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

169
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,510
That's our Snowcat.

170
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:25,237
Can you both drive a car?

171
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:29,342
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

172
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:31,281
You'll get the hang of it.

173
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:33,681
This is the kitchen, huh?

174
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,481
This is it.

175
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:38,626
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

176
00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:41,657
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

177
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:44,229
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

178
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:47,994
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

179
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:50,769
Don't let it get you down.

180
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:53,464
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

181
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,871
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

182
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,308
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

183
00:15:58,514 --> 00:16:01,642
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

184
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:06,515
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

185
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:09,816
Right here is
our walk-in freezer.

186
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,020
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

187
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,221
You got 15 rib roasts...

188
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:18,559
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

189
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:21,828
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

190
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:25,132
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

191
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:28,310
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

192
00:16:29,545 --> 00:16:31,911
You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?

193
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:33,979
French fries and ketchup.

194
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:36,708
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

195
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,648
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

196
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:46,952
How'd you know we call him Doc?

197
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:51,190
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

198
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,799
I did?

199
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:56,730
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

200
00:16:56,939 --> 00:16:58,201
But how did you know?

201
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:00,932
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

202
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:03,407
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

203
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:05,807
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

204
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:08,210
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

205
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:11,085
What's up, Doc?

206
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:15,117
Now, this is the storeroom.

207
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,690
In here is where we keep...

208
00:17:18,894 --> 00:17:21,692
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

209
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:24,331
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

210
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:28,333
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

211
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:31,734
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

212
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:35,968
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

213
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:38,646
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

214
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:42,045
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

215
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:52,160
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

216
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:56,554
Sociables, finger rolls...

217
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:58,290
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

218
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:02,028
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

219
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:05,332
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

220
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:09,841
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

221
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:14,375
- How're you getting on?
- Fine.

222
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:18,144
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

223
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:20,288
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

224
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:23,686
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

225
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,758
You like ice cream, Doc?

226
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:27,596
I thought you did.

227
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:30,857
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

228
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,897
- Not at all.
- We don't mind.

229
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:35,297
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?

230
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:37,563
Okay, you behave yourself.

231
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:42,441
What kind of ice cream
do you like?

232
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:43,543
Chocolate.

233
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:46,715
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

234
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:53,278
It's amazing, all this
activity today.

235
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:56,287
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

236
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:57,925
...last day's always hectic.

237
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:01,187
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

238
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:05,424
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

239
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:07,693
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

240
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,344
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

241
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:25,318
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

242
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:35,786
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

243
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:38,723
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

244
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:42,768
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

245
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:46,137
She called it "shining."

246
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:50,373
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

247
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:53,104
...that had "the shine" to us.

248
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:56,808
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

249
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:59,351
But there are other folks...

250
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:03,286
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

251
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:10,397
How long have you
been able to do it?

252
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:18,004
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

253
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:25,304
I'm not supposed to.

254
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:29,407
Who says you ain't supposed to?

255
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:34,254
Tony.

256
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:37,886
Who's Tony?

257
00:20:40,362 --> 00:20:43,763
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

258
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:47,726
Is Tony the one
that...

259
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:49,495
...tells you things?

260
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:56,409
How does he tell you things?

261
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:02,547
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

262
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:06,847
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

263
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:12,388
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

264
00:21:15,698 --> 00:21:18,258
Do they know he tells you things?

265
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:22,069
Tony told me never to tell them.

266
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:27,573
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

267
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:30,336
About the Overlook Hotel?

268
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:35,173
I don't know.

269
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:40,112
Now think real hard, Doc. Think.

270
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:47,794
Is there something bad here?

271
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:01,842
You know, Doc,
when something happens...

272
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:05,673
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

273
00:22:06,448 --> 00:22:08,006
Say, like...

274
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:11,277
...if someone burns toast.

275
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:18,053
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

276
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:22,664
Not things that anyone
can notice.

277
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:27,666
But things that people
who shine can see.

278
00:22:28,771 --> 00:22:32,070
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

279
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:38,507
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

280
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:42,916
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

281
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:46,815
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

282
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:49,756
And not all of them
was good.

283
00:22:53,062 --> 00:22:55,690
What about room 237?

284
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:01,229
Room 237?

285
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:05,632
You're scared of room 237,
ain't you?

286
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:08,876
No, I ain't.

287
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:14,213
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

288
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:16,916
Nothing.

289
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:20,583
There ain't nothing in room 237.

290
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:24,020
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

291
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:26,353
So stay out.

292
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:29,053
You understand? Stay out!

293
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:47,036
Good morning, hon.

294
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:50,807
Your breakfast is ready.

295
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,207
What time is it?

296
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:55,280
It's about 11:30.

297
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,778
Jesus.

298
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:02,155
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

299
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:03,890
I know it.

300
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:08,061
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

301
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:09,921
Nice.

302
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:13,998
It's really pretty outside.

303
00:25:14,203 --> 00:25:17,434
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

304
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,374
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

305
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:25,473
Any ideas yet?

306
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,142
Lots of ideas.

307
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,874
No good ones.

308
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:32,820
Something will come.

309
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:37,258
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

310
00:25:38,827 --> 00:25:40,522
That's all it is.

311
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:02,441
- All right.
- And you're going to lose.

312
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:05,779
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

313
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:11,918
Look out!

314
00:26:12,127 --> 00:26:13,992
I'm coming in close.

315
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:16,687
Loser has to keep America clean.

316
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:18,559
Keep America clean.

317
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:21,035
Danny, you win.

318
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,702
Let's take the rest
of this walking.

319
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:27,640
Give me your hand.

320
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,076
Isn't it beautiful?

321
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:51,196
Dead end.

322
00:27:48,657 --> 00:27:50,284
We made it.

323
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,020
Isn't it beautiful?

324
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:15,546
It's so pretty.

325
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:23,091
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

326
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:02,515
Hi, hon.

327
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:07,520
How's it going?

328
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:11,251
Fine.

329
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:14,919
Get a lot written today?

330
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,530
The weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

331
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:32,076
What do you want me
to do about it?

332
00:31:34,215 --> 00:31:36,376
Come on, hon.

333
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:38,743
Don't be so grouchy.

334
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:40,485
I'm not...

335
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,049
...being grouchy.

336
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:45,055
I just want to finish my work.

337
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:50,963
Okay. I understand.

338
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:53,793
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

339
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:56,470
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

340
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:00,766
Wendy...

341
00:32:00,976 --> 00:32:03,570
...let me explain something to you.

342
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:08,347
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

343
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,983
You're distracting me...

344
00:32:10,185 --> 00:32:13,621
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

345
00:32:13,822 --> 00:32:15,255
Understand?

346
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:19,887
Fine.

347
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:22,791
We're going to make a new rule:

348
00:32:22,998 --> 00:32:24,431
Whenever I'm in here...

349
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:26,897
...and you hear me typing...

350
00:32:28,703 --> 00:32:31,638
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

351
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,138
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

352
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:36,572
That means don't come in.

353
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:39,042
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

354
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:44,811
Fine.

355
00:32:45,854 --> 00:32:49,153
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

356
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:15,574
Missed!

357
00:33:21,156 --> 00:33:21,986
Don't have!

358
00:33:22,223 --> 00:33:23,952
No fair anymore.

359
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:32,689
I knew it.

360
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:06,449
This is IKDIK 12 calling IKDIK 1.

361
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:12,660
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

362
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:15,995
This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.

363
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:19,499
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

364
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,872
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

365
00:35:23,144 --> 00:35:24,475
We're just fine.

366
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,147
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

367
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:30,374
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

368
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:34,819
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

369
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:38,320
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

370
00:35:38,526 --> 00:35:39,686
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

371
00:35:39,894 --> 00:35:43,330
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

372
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:47,233
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

373
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:50,603
Yes. It's one of the worst we've
had for years.

374
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:54,369
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

375
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:57,004
I suppose not. Over.

376
00:35:57,612 --> 00:36:00,911
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

377
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:02,412
And, Mrs. Torrance?

378
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:06,815
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

379
00:36:07,655 --> 00:36:09,145
Okay. We'll do that.

380
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:11,416
It was real nice talking to you.

381
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:14,254
Bye. Over and out.

382
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:51,358
Hello, Danny.

383
00:36:56,638 --> 00:36:59,072
Come and play with us.

384
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:06,709
Come and play with us, Danny.

385
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:10,414
Forever...

386
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:13,949
...and ever...

387
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:16,914
...and ever.

388
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:50,016
Tony...

389
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:53,050
...I'm scared.

390
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:02,094
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

391
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:07,607
It's just like
pictures in a book, Danny.

392
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:09,970
It isn't real.

393
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,583
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

394
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:13,522
Come here for a minute first.

395
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:52,330
How's it going, Doc?

396
00:39:56,906 --> 00:39:58,703
Having a good time?

397
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:02,244
Yes, Dad.

398
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:06,376
Good.

399
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:10,745
I want you to
have a good time.

400
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:13,081
I am, Dad.

401
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:25,330
Do you feel bad?

402
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:33,572
I'm just a little bit tired.

403
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:37,704
Then why don't you
go to sleep?

404
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:42,842
I can't.

405
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,618
I got too much to do.

406
00:40:55,932 --> 00:40:58,196
Do you like this hotel?

407
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:05,606
I do.

408
00:41:06,576 --> 00:41:07,907
I love it.

409
00:41:10,112 --> 00:41:11,443
Don't you?

410
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:15,306
I guess so.

411
00:41:17,954 --> 00:41:19,148
Good.

412
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:24,690
I want you to like it here.

413
00:41:28,664 --> 00:41:32,065
I wish we could stay here
forever...

414
00:41:32,268 --> 00:41:34,065
...and ever...

415
00:41:34,737 --> 00:41:36,068
...and ever.

416
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,534
What?

417
00:41:43,813 --> 00:41:46,907
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

418
00:41:52,388 --> 00:41:53,878
What do you mean?

419
00:41:58,995 --> 00:42:01,589
Did your mother ever
say that to you?

420
00:42:02,265 --> 00:42:04,062
That I would hurt you?

421
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:06,199
No, Dad.

422
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:09,929
You sure?

423
00:42:10,473 --> 00:42:12,031
Yes, Dad.

424
00:42:16,846 --> 00:42:18,871
I love you, Danny.

425
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:22,676
I love you
more than anything else...

426
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:25,445
...in the whole world...

427
00:42:26,222 --> 00:42:29,282
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

428
00:42:29,592 --> 00:42:30,820
...never.

429
00:42:31,694 --> 00:42:33,753
You know that, don't you?

430
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,788
Yes, Dad.

431
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:37,824
Good.

432
00:44:05,755 --> 00:44:07,518
Mom, are you in there?

433
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:27,827
What happened?

434
00:45:28,037 --> 00:45:29,265
Honey...

435
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:31,538
...what's wrong?

436
00:45:39,715 --> 00:45:41,114
I had the most...

437
00:45:41,317 --> 00:45:43,911
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

438
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,790
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It's okay, it's okay now.

439
00:45:49,992 --> 00:45:51,357
Really.

440
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:57,223
I dreamed that I...

441
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:59,867
...that I killed
you and Danny.

442
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:04,835
But I didn't just kill you.

443
00:46:06,142 --> 00:46:08,906
I cut you up
into little pieces.

444
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,104
My God.

445
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:16,376
I must be losing my mind.

446
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:21,282
Everything's going to be
all right.

447
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:26,088
Come on. Let's get up
off the floor.

448
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:36,234
There. Now sit up.

449
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:38,169
It's okay.

450
00:46:39,275 --> 00:46:40,708
It's okay.

451
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,974
Danny!

452
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:48,216
Everything's okay!

453
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:51,580
Just go play in your room
for a while.

454
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:53,980
Your dad's just got
a headache.

455
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:58,317
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

456
00:47:00,296 --> 00:47:03,231
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

457
00:47:03,432 --> 00:47:04,956
I'll be right back.

458
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,928
Why don't you mind me?

459
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:17,375
Oh, my God.

460
00:47:18,581 --> 00:47:20,981
What happened to your neck?

461
00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:25,045
What happened to your neck?

462
00:47:54,016 --> 00:47:55,984
You did this to him...

463
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:57,851
...didn't you?!

464
00:47:59,688 --> 00:48:01,747
You son of a bitch!

465
00:48:01,957 --> 00:48:03,822
You did this to him!

466
00:48:04,026 --> 00:48:05,459
Didn't you?!

467
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:08,456
How could you?!

468
00:48:08,697 --> 00:48:10,426
How could you?!

469
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:43,383
God! I'd give anything
for a drink.

470
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:48,929
I'd give my goddamn soul...

471
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:51,622
...for just a glass of beer.

472
00:50:06,615 --> 00:50:08,105
Hi, Lloyd.

473
00:50:11,653 --> 00:50:14,053
A little slow tonight,
isn't it?

474
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:21,191
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

475
00:50:23,265 --> 00:50:24,732
What will it be?

476
00:50:26,402 --> 00:50:29,371
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

477
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:32,904
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

478
00:50:33,108 --> 00:50:36,009
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

479
00:50:36,211 --> 00:50:39,476
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

480
00:50:40,182 --> 00:50:42,013
So here's what:

481
00:50:42,317 --> 00:50:44,615
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

482
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,618
...a little glass and some ice.

483
00:50:47,823 --> 00:50:49,848
You can do that,
can't you, Lloyd?

484
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:52,658
You're not too busy, are you?

485
00:50:53,228 --> 00:50:55,719
No, sir.
I'm not busy at all.

486
00:50:56,231 --> 00:50:57,789
Good man.

487
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,192
You set them up...

488
00:50:59,468 --> 00:51:02,335
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

489
00:51:03,472 --> 00:51:06,407
White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

490
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:08,769
White man's burden.

491
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:15,976
Say, Lloyd...

492
00:51:16,185 --> 00:51:18,949
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

493
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:21,722
How's my credit
in this joint, anyway?

494
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:24,356
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

495
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,687
That's swell.

496
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:28,590
I like you, Lloyd.

497
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:30,458
I always liked you.

498
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,998
You were always the best of them.

499
00:51:33,202 --> 00:51:35,568
Best goddamned bartender...

500
00:51:35,771 --> 00:51:38,706
...from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine.

501
00:51:38,907 --> 00:51:41,137
Or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

502
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,207
Thank you for saying so.

503
00:51:55,691 --> 00:51:58,922
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

504
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:00,754
I didn't.

505
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:07,394
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

506
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:11,131
I love the little
son of a bitch.

507
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:15,574
I'd do anything for him.

508
00:52:15,777 --> 00:52:18,575
Any fucking thing for him.

509
00:52:22,651 --> 00:52:25,211
But that bitch!

510
00:52:26,221 --> 00:52:27,916
As long as I live...

511
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,591
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

512
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:44,036
I did hurt him once, okay?

513
00:52:44,406 --> 00:52:46,465
It was an accident.

514
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:49,369
Completely unintentional.

515
00:52:50,646 --> 00:52:52,876
It could have happened
to anybody.

516
00:52:54,616 --> 00:52:58,074
And it was three goddamn
years ago!

517
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:01,120
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

518
00:53:01,323 --> 00:53:03,791
All I tried to do was pull him up.

519
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:11,261
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

520
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:12,795
I mean...

521
00:53:13,335 --> 00:53:16,862
...a few extra foot-pounds
of energy...

522
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:19,905
...per second, per second.

523
00:53:36,024 --> 00:53:37,924
Thank God you're here.

524
00:53:41,163 --> 00:53:43,358
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

525
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:46,090
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

526
00:53:46,301 --> 00:53:48,861
She tried to strangle Danny.

527
00:53:52,306 --> 00:53:54,706
Are you out of your fucking mind?

528
00:53:56,644 --> 00:53:58,669
It's the truth! Really.

529
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,871
I swear it.
Danny told me.

530
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,080
He went up into
one of the bedrooms.

531
00:54:03,284 --> 00:54:06,742
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

532
00:54:06,954 --> 00:54:09,286
She tried to strangle him!

533
00:54:12,994 --> 00:54:14,757
Which room was it?

534
00:54:22,403 --> 00:54:24,530
From Channel 10 in Miami...

535
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:27,105
...this is Newswatch
with Glen Rinker...

536
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:31,506
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

537
00:54:31,846 --> 00:54:34,280
Good evening. I'm Glen Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.

538
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:37,610
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...

539
00:54:37,818 --> 00:54:39,945
...bringing temperatures
to the 90s...

540
00:54:40,154 --> 00:54:43,282
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

541
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:47,484
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell in just a few hours tonight.

542
00:54:47,695 --> 00:54:49,925
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

543
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:53,100
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.

544
00:54:53,301 --> 00:54:55,201
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

545
00:54:55,403 --> 00:54:57,166
Railroad tracks are frozen.

546
00:54:57,371 --> 00:54:59,396
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...

547
00:54:59,607 --> 00:55:03,168
...at least 3 have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.

548
00:55:03,377 --> 00:55:05,675
The governor of Colorado
is expected...

549
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,609
...to declare
a weather emergency.

550
00:55:07,815 --> 00:55:09,646
The National Guard
might be called out...

551
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,044
...to clear streets and roads.

552
00:55:11,252 --> 00:55:13,482
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...

553
00:55:13,688 --> 00:55:15,679
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

554
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:18,518
...with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

555
00:55:18,726 --> 00:55:21,718
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

556
00:55:21,929 --> 00:55:24,159
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

557
00:55:24,365 --> 00:55:26,333
Local beaches
should be jammed.

558
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:28,559
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

559
00:55:28,769 --> 00:55:32,034
...will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.

560
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:08,301
We're sorry. Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

561
01:01:08,642 --> 01:01:11,770
If you need assistance,
please call the operator.

562
01:01:29,029 --> 01:01:30,860
Yes, it's me.

563
01:01:31,065 --> 01:01:32,498
Thank God.

564
01:01:37,171 --> 01:01:38,934
Did you find anything?

565
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:41,869
No. Nothing at all.

566
01:01:42,476 --> 01:01:45,639
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

567
01:01:48,382 --> 01:01:51,874
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

568
01:01:52,086 --> 01:01:53,644
Yes, I did.

569
01:01:54,121 --> 01:01:55,918
And you didn't see anything at all?

570
01:01:56,123 --> 01:01:58,114
Absolutely nothing.

571
01:01:58,325 --> 01:01:59,587
How is he?

572
01:01:59,793 --> 01:02:01,590
He's still asleep.

573
01:02:01,996 --> 01:02:03,122
Good.

574
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:12,030
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

575
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:19,001
Are you sure it was the right room?

576
01:02:19,213 --> 01:02:22,376
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

577
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:24,949
He must have gone in that room.

578
01:02:25,152 --> 01:02:27,814
The door was open,
the lights were on.

579
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:32,789
I just don't understand it.

580
01:02:37,131 --> 01:02:40,157
What about those bruises
on his neck?

581
01:02:42,336 --> 01:02:44,668
Somebody did that to him.

582
01:02:52,946 --> 01:02:54,379
I think...

583
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:58,610
...he did it to himself.

584
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:05,853
No.

585
01:03:06,527 --> 01:03:08,552
That's not possible.

586
01:03:13,867 --> 01:03:17,530
Once you rule out his version
of what happened...

587
01:03:17,771 --> 01:03:20,365
...there is no other explanation.

588
01:03:20,841 --> 01:03:22,172
Is there?

589
01:03:28,749 --> 01:03:31,741
Whatever the explanation is...

590
01:03:35,189 --> 01:03:36,588
...I think we...

591
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,520
...have to get Danny out of here.

592
01:03:44,298 --> 01:03:46,129
Get him out of here?

593
01:03:50,304 --> 01:03:52,033
You mean...

594
01:03:53,073 --> 01:03:55,041
...just leave the hotel?

595
01:04:04,017 --> 01:04:05,484
It is so...

596
01:04:05,686 --> 01:04:08,120
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

597
01:04:08,322 --> 01:04:10,847
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

598
01:04:11,058 --> 01:04:13,618
When I'm really into my work!

599
01:04:13,827 --> 01:04:17,786
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?

600
01:04:17,998 --> 01:04:21,729
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.

601
01:04:21,935 --> 01:04:24,028
Any of that appeal to you?

602
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:27,935
I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

603
01:04:28,142 --> 01:04:31,771
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

604
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:45,715
Good evening. Forest Service.

605
01:05:46,286 --> 01:05:47,719
My name is Dick Hallorann.

606
01:05:47,921 --> 01:05:50,355
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

607
01:05:50,557 --> 01:05:52,684
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

608
01:05:52,893 --> 01:05:56,454
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

609
01:05:56,663 --> 01:05:59,962
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

610
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:03,762
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

611
01:06:03,971 --> 01:06:06,633
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

612
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:10,071
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

613
01:06:10,277 --> 01:06:11,938
And with this storm
and everything...

614
01:06:12,145 --> 01:06:15,046
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

615
01:06:15,249 --> 01:06:17,240
...just to see if
everything's okay.

616
01:06:17,751 --> 01:06:19,048
I'll be glad to do that.

617
01:06:19,253 --> 01:06:22,051
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

618
01:06:22,256 --> 01:06:24,281
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.

619
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:25,924
All right, sir.

620
01:06:46,246 --> 01:06:48,214
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

621
01:06:48,415 --> 01:06:49,882
Good evening.

622
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:15,908
Hi, Lloyd.

623
01:07:16,109 --> 01:07:17,974
Been away, but now I'm back.

624
01:07:18,245 --> 01:07:19,974
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

625
01:07:20,647 --> 01:07:21,636
It's good to see you.

626
01:07:21,848 --> 01:07:24,510
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

627
01:07:25,152 --> 01:07:26,881
What'll it be, sir?

628
01:07:27,688 --> 01:07:29,952
Hair of the dog that bit me.

629
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:33,019
Bourbon on the rocks.

630
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,259
That'll do her.

631
01:07:48,775 --> 01:07:51,039
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

632
01:07:52,479 --> 01:07:54,447
No charge?

633
01:07:55,082 --> 01:07:57,073
Your money's no good here.

634
01:08:02,723 --> 01:08:04,452
Orders from the house.

635
01:08:07,661 --> 01:08:10,152
Orders from the house.

636
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,391
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

637
01:08:17,604 --> 01:08:22,132
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

638
01:08:24,444 --> 01:08:27,379
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

639
01:08:27,581 --> 01:08:29,515
At least, not at this point.

640
01:08:34,321 --> 01:08:36,721
Anything you say, Lloyd.

641
01:08:37,157 --> 01:08:39,148
Anything you say.

642
01:08:52,139 --> 01:08:54,607
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

643
01:08:55,709 --> 01:08:57,176
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

644
01:08:57,377 --> 01:08:59,937
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

645
01:09:01,181 --> 01:09:04,810
That's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

646
01:09:05,018 --> 01:09:07,816
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

647
01:09:08,021 --> 01:09:09,147
Advocaat, is it?

648
01:09:09,356 --> 01:09:11,517
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...

649
01:09:11,725 --> 01:09:13,920
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

650
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:16,652
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

651
01:09:17,497 --> 01:09:20,796
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...

652
01:09:21,001 --> 01:09:21,990
...Jeevesy old boy.

653
01:09:22,202 --> 01:09:25,365
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

654
01:09:25,672 --> 01:09:28,072
Awfully nice of you to say.

655
01:09:28,508 --> 01:09:31,375
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

656
01:09:31,578 --> 01:09:33,842
...before the fish and
goose soiree.

657
01:09:34,047 --> 01:09:36,072
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

658
01:09:36,283 --> 01:09:37,580
Here. I'll just...

659
01:09:38,552 --> 01:09:40,816
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

660
01:09:41,021 --> 01:09:42,818
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

661
01:09:43,857 --> 01:09:47,486
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

662
01:09:47,694 --> 01:09:48,956
All right. I'll just...

663
01:09:49,162 --> 01:09:53,360
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

664
01:09:53,934 --> 01:09:55,367
Won't keep you a moment.

665
01:09:55,569 --> 01:09:56,968
Fine.

666
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,701
What do they call you,
Jeevesy?

667
01:10:01,908 --> 01:10:04,468
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

668
01:10:09,249 --> 01:10:10,079
Grady?

669
01:10:10,283 --> 01:10:11,614
Yes, sir.

670
01:10:12,786 --> 01:10:14,117
Delbert Grady.

671
01:10:14,321 --> 01:10:15,845
That's right, sir.

672
01:10:24,564 --> 01:10:25,997
Mr. Grady...

673
01:10:26,766 --> 01:10:28,859
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

674
01:10:29,069 --> 01:10:31,765
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

675
01:10:38,812 --> 01:10:40,643
It's coming off now, sir.

676
01:10:45,585 --> 01:10:47,143
Mr. Grady...

677
01:10:48,655 --> 01:10:51,123
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

678
01:10:51,324 --> 01:10:54,122
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

679
01:10:57,163 --> 01:11:00,496
You a married man, are you,
Mr. Grady?

680
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,530
Yes, sir.

681
01:11:01,735 --> 01:11:05,000
I have a wife and
two daughters, sir.

682
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:07,563
And...

683
01:11:09,242 --> 01:11:10,504
...where are they now?

684
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:14,771
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

685
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:27,858
You were the caretaker here.

686
01:11:29,329 --> 01:11:31,320
I recognize you.

687
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:35,759
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

688
01:11:36,202 --> 01:11:37,965
You...

689
01:11:38,438 --> 01:11:41,965
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

690
01:11:42,475 --> 01:11:43,874
And...

691
01:11:44,511 --> 01:11:46,445
...then you blew your brains out.

692
01:11:56,356 --> 01:11:58,119
That's strange, sir.

693
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:01,855
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

694
01:12:05,532 --> 01:12:07,397
Mr. Grady...

695
01:12:07,834 --> 01:12:11,167
...you were the caretaker here.

696
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:21,743
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

697
01:12:23,617 --> 01:12:25,346
But you...

698
01:12:26,086 --> 01:12:27,917
...are the caretaker.

699
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:33,091
You've always been the caretaker.

700
01:12:35,996 --> 01:12:37,827
I should know, sir.

701
01:12:39,265 --> 01:12:41,859
I've always been here.

702
01:13:00,086 --> 01:13:02,281
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

703
01:13:02,522 --> 01:13:04,285
...that your son...

704
01:13:04,691 --> 01:13:07,387
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

705
01:13:07,594 --> 01:13:09,789
...into this situation?

706
01:13:12,365 --> 01:13:14,060
Did you know that?

707
01:13:20,306 --> 01:13:22,399
He is, Mr. Torrance.

708
01:13:24,744 --> 01:13:25,904
Who?

709
01:13:28,148 --> 01:13:29,775
A nigger.

710
01:13:33,853 --> 01:13:35,252
A nigger?

711
01:13:37,991 --> 01:13:39,424
A nigger...

712
01:13:39,626 --> 01:13:40,718
...cook.

713
01:13:47,233 --> 01:13:48,495
How?

714
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,533
Your son...

715
01:13:52,972 --> 01:13:55,770
...has a very great talent.

716
01:13:56,743 --> 01:14:00,235
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

717
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:04,211
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

718
01:14:04,417 --> 01:14:06,385
...against your will.

719
01:14:14,928 --> 01:14:16,190
Well...

720
01:14:18,965 --> 01:14:22,025
...he is a very willful boy.

721
01:14:24,437 --> 01:14:26,837
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

722
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,941
A very willful boy.

723
01:14:30,143 --> 01:14:31,474
A rather...

724
01:14:31,678 --> 01:14:33,202
...naughty boy...

725
01:14:33,413 --> 01:14:36,610
...if I may be so bold, sir.

726
01:14:43,857 --> 01:14:45,620
It's his mother.

727
01:14:47,761 --> 01:14:49,228
She...

728
01:14:49,429 --> 01:14:51,420
...interferes.

729
01:14:54,534 --> 01:14:57,628
Perhaps they need a good...

730
01:14:57,837 --> 01:14:59,429
...talking-to.

731
01:14:59,873 --> 01:15:00,703
If...

732
01:15:00,907 --> 01:15:03,671
...you don't mind my saying so.

733
01:15:04,477 --> 01:15:06,104
Perhaps...

734
01:15:06,646 --> 01:15:08,341
...a bit more.

735
01:15:11,551 --> 01:15:12,779
My girls, sir...

736
01:15:12,986 --> 01:15:16,786
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

737
01:15:17,457 --> 01:15:21,359
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

738
01:15:21,561 --> 01:15:24,223
...and tried to burn it down.

739
01:15:25,298 --> 01:15:26,959
But I...

740
01:15:27,167 --> 01:15:29,135
...corrected them, sir.

741
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:34,600
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

742
01:15:34,808 --> 01:15:36,070
...I...

743
01:15:37,076 --> 01:15:39,169
...corrected her.

744
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:52,124
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

745
01:15:52,425 --> 01:15:54,188
Are you receiving me?

746
01:15:57,397 --> 01:16:00,855
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

747
01:16:01,201 --> 01:16:03,999
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

748
01:16:04,204 --> 01:16:05,865
Do you read me?

749
01:16:10,243 --> 01:16:13,269
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

750
01:16:13,479 --> 01:16:16,039
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

751
01:16:16,249 --> 01:16:18,012
Are you receiving me?

752
01:17:05,932 --> 01:17:09,197
You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.

753
01:17:09,402 --> 01:17:11,962
And we have a bad day out there.

754
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:15,538
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.

755
01:17:15,742 --> 01:17:17,232
Many mountain passes...

756
01:17:17,443 --> 01:17:20,310
...Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...

757
01:17:20,513 --> 01:17:23,812
...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.

758
01:17:24,017 --> 01:17:25,678
We hear from the news department...

759
01:17:25,885 --> 01:17:29,082
...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...

760
01:17:29,289 --> 01:17:30,881
...and with storms like this...

761
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:35,220
...I guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.

762
01:17:35,395 --> 01:17:38,262
The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...

763
01:17:38,464 --> 01:17:40,932
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...

764
01:17:41,134 --> 01:17:43,932
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.

765
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:37,003
How do you like it?

766
01:20:43,616 --> 01:20:45,140
How do you like it?

767
01:20:55,094 --> 01:20:57,756
What are you doing down here?

768
01:21:02,135 --> 01:21:04,467
I just...

769
01:21:04,937 --> 01:21:05,961
...wanted...

770
01:21:06,405 --> 01:21:08,134
...to talk to you.

771
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:11,772
Okay.

772
01:21:12,378 --> 01:21:13,845
Let's talk.

773
01:21:23,656 --> 01:21:25,647
What do you want to talk about?

774
01:21:33,566 --> 01:21:36,729
I can't really remember.

775
01:21:37,537 --> 01:21:39,664
You can't remember.

776
01:21:40,473 --> 01:21:41,804
No...

777
01:21:42,175 --> 01:21:43,574
...I can't.

778
01:21:48,881 --> 01:21:52,146
Maybe it was about Danny?

779
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,216
Maybe it was about him.

780
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:04,159
I think we should discuss Danny.

781
01:22:06,966 --> 01:22:08,763
I think...

782
01:22:09,168 --> 01:22:12,934
...we should discuss
what should be done with him.

783
01:22:17,643 --> 01:22:20,237
What should be done with him?

784
01:22:25,218 --> 01:22:27,015
I don't know.

785
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,511
I don't think that's true.

786
01:22:29,722 --> 01:22:32,316
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

787
01:22:32,525 --> 01:22:34,220
...about what should be done
with Danny.

788
01:22:34,427 --> 01:22:37,021
And I'd like to know
what they are.

789
01:22:38,931 --> 01:22:40,728
Well, I...

790
01:22:41,033 --> 01:22:45,436
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

791
01:22:45,638 --> 01:22:48,937
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

792
01:22:51,177 --> 01:22:54,510
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

793
01:22:55,147 --> 01:22:56,512
As soon as possible?

794
01:22:57,116 --> 01:22:59,448
"As soon as possible?"

795
01:23:02,121 --> 01:23:03,554
Please.

796
01:23:04,957 --> 01:23:08,222
You believe his health
might be at stake.

797
01:23:09,795 --> 01:23:11,319
Yes.

798
01:23:12,665 --> 01:23:15,293
And you are concerned about him.

799
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:20,100
And are you concerned about me?

800
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:22,100
Of course I am.

801
01:23:22,308 --> 01:23:24,538
Of course you are!

802
01:23:24,744 --> 01:23:27,872
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

803
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,570
What are you talking about?

804
01:23:29,782 --> 01:23:32,615
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

805
01:23:32,818 --> 01:23:34,877
...thought about
my responsibilities?

806
01:23:35,087 --> 01:23:37,351
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

807
01:23:37,556 --> 01:23:40,354
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

808
01:23:40,626 --> 01:23:42,457
Has is ever occurred to you...

809
01:23:42,662 --> 01:23:46,154
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1st?

810
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:48,424
Does it matter to you at all...

811
01:23:48,634 --> 01:23:51,728
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

812
01:23:51,937 --> 01:23:55,065
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

813
01:23:55,274 --> 01:23:57,868
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

814
01:23:58,344 --> 01:24:00,369
Do you have the slightest idea...

815
01:24:00,579 --> 01:24:03,810
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

816
01:24:04,183 --> 01:24:07,277
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

817
01:24:07,486 --> 01:24:09,886
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

818
01:24:10,089 --> 01:24:12,387
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

819
01:24:12,591 --> 01:24:14,115
Stay away from me!

820
01:24:14,994 --> 01:24:16,052
Why?

821
01:24:16,362 --> 01:24:19,331
I just want to go back to my room.

822
01:24:19,532 --> 01:24:20,794
Why?

823
01:24:21,434 --> 01:24:22,298
Well...

824
01:24:23,436 --> 01:24:25,461
...I'm very confused.

825
01:24:26,605 --> 01:24:30,268
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

826
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:35,246
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

827
01:24:35,448 --> 01:24:38,212
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

828
01:24:39,185 --> 01:24:40,675
Stay away from me!

829
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,317
Please!

830
01:24:43,089 --> 01:24:44,147
Don't hurt me.

831
01:24:44,357 --> 01:24:45,688
I'm not going to hurt you.

832
01:24:45,891 --> 01:24:47,085
Stay away from me!

833
01:24:47,293 --> 01:24:48,157
Stay away!

834
01:24:48,361 --> 01:24:49,350
Darling.

835
01:24:49,562 --> 01:24:51,120
Light of my life.

836
01:24:51,564 --> 01:24:52,895
I'm not going to hurt you.

837
01:24:53,099 --> 01:24:55,090
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

838
01:24:55,301 --> 01:24:57,496
I said,
"I'm not going to hurt you."

839
01:24:57,703 --> 01:25:00,467
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

840
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:03,709
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

841
01:25:04,777 --> 01:25:06,335
Stay away from me!

842
01:25:06,846 --> 01:25:07,870
Stay away from me!

843
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,480
I'm not going to hurt you.

844
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,274
Stay away from me!

845
01:25:12,518 --> 01:25:13,576
Stay away!

846
01:25:14,453 --> 01:25:15,681
Please!

847
01:25:16,722 --> 01:25:18,485
Stop swinging the bat.

848
01:25:18,691 --> 01:25:19,953
Stay away from me.

849
01:25:20,726 --> 01:25:22,023
Put that bat down, Wendy.

850
01:25:22,228 --> 01:25:23,718
Stop it!

851
01:25:25,197 --> 01:25:26,323
Give me the bat.

852
01:25:26,532 --> 01:25:27,658
Please!

853
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:30,095
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

854
01:25:30,302 --> 01:25:31,360
Stop it!

855
01:25:31,604 --> 01:25:33,037
Give me the bat.

856
01:25:33,372 --> 01:25:34,999
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.

857
01:25:35,207 --> 01:25:36,572
Please stop!

858
01:25:36,776 --> 01:25:37,970
Give me the bat.

859
01:25:38,177 --> 01:25:39,405
Stay away from me.

860
01:25:39,678 --> 01:25:42,044
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.

861
01:25:43,449 --> 01:25:44,473
Goddamn...!

862
01:26:59,758 --> 01:27:01,453
What are you doing?

863
01:27:04,263 --> 01:27:05,730
Wait a minute.

864
01:27:07,132 --> 01:27:09,123
What are you doing?

865
01:27:11,971 --> 01:27:13,199
What are you doing?

866
01:27:27,086 --> 01:27:28,576
Wait a minute!

867
01:27:30,956 --> 01:27:32,548
What are you doing?

868
01:27:32,791 --> 01:27:34,520
Open the door!

869
01:27:35,828 --> 01:27:36,852
Goddamn it!

870
01:27:37,062 --> 01:27:40,623
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

871
01:27:44,336 --> 01:27:45,564
Wendy, listen.

872
01:27:46,005 --> 01:27:48,940
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

873
01:27:49,141 --> 01:27:51,609
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.

874
01:28:06,292 --> 01:28:07,657
Baby.

875
01:28:08,861 --> 01:28:12,160
I think you hurt my head
real bad.

876
01:28:13,766 --> 01:28:15,427
I'm dizzy.

877
01:28:16,435 --> 01:28:18,630
I need a doctor.

878
01:28:25,511 --> 01:28:26,705
Honey.

879
01:28:29,381 --> 01:28:31,713
Don't leave me in here.

880
01:28:40,326 --> 01:28:42,226
I'm going to go now.

881
01:28:45,297 --> 01:28:47,128
I'm going to try...

882
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:50,325
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

883
01:28:51,036 --> 01:28:53,402
...in the Snowcat today.

884
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:57,472
I'll bring back a doctor.

885
01:29:02,848 --> 01:29:04,713
I'm going to go now.

886
01:29:12,157 --> 01:29:15,957
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

887
01:29:17,429 --> 01:29:20,023
You're not going anywhere.

888
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:25,830
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

889
01:29:30,442 --> 01:29:32,137
Go check it out.

890
01:29:34,279 --> 01:29:36,474
Go check it out!

891
01:29:39,852 --> 01:29:41,786
Go check it out.

892
01:31:29,628 --> 01:31:32,028
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

893
01:31:32,765 --> 01:31:34,733
Delbert Grady.

894
01:31:36,301 --> 01:31:37,893
Grady?

895
01:31:58,357 --> 01:32:00,188
Hello, Grady.

896
01:32:04,863 --> 01:32:06,660
Mr. Torrance...

897
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:12,331
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

898
01:32:13,071 --> 01:32:15,562
...business we discussed.

899
01:32:22,281 --> 01:32:25,216
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

900
01:32:26,084 --> 01:32:30,145
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

901
01:32:31,023 --> 01:32:33,753
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

902
01:32:34,259 --> 01:32:36,090
I wonder.

903
01:32:37,262 --> 01:32:39,355
I have my doubts.

904
01:32:40,566 --> 01:32:44,798
I, and others, have come
to believe...

905
01:32:45,003 --> 01:32:47,995
...that your heart is not in this.

906
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,165
That you haven't the belly for it.

907
01:32:57,349 --> 01:33:01,649
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

908
01:33:02,487 --> 01:33:04,421
That's all I ask.

909
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:10,224
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

910
01:33:10,429 --> 01:33:11,896
Somewhat more...

911
01:33:12,097 --> 01:33:14,065
...resourceful.

912
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:17,097
She seems to have got
the better of you.

913
01:33:20,339 --> 01:33:23,001
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

914
01:33:23,742 --> 01:33:25,903
Only for the moment.

915
01:33:27,813 --> 01:33:31,977
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

916
01:33:32,251 --> 01:33:35,914
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

917
01:33:36,488 --> 01:33:38,046
I fear...

918
01:33:38,323 --> 01:33:40,883
...that is the only thing to do.

919
01:33:44,363 --> 01:33:46,456
There's nothing
I look forward to...

920
01:33:46,665 --> 01:33:50,567
...with greater pleasure,
Mr. Grady.

921
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:54,700
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

922
01:33:56,174 --> 01:33:58,199
I give you my word.

923
01:35:10,315 --> 01:35:12,875
Redrum.

924
01:35:13,819 --> 01:35:16,379
Redrum.

925
01:37:24,349 --> 01:37:25,907
Danny, stop it!

926
01:38:22,707 --> 01:38:24,174
I'm home.

927
01:39:01,513 --> 01:39:04,380
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

928
01:39:29,941 --> 01:39:31,806
I can't get out.

929
01:39:32,611 --> 01:39:33,737
Run!

930
01:39:34,579 --> 01:39:36,012
Run and hide!

931
01:39:36,548 --> 01:39:37,674
Run!

932
01:39:37,882 --> 01:39:39,110
Quick!

933
01:39:40,819 --> 01:39:45,347
Little pigs, little pigs,
let me come in.

934
01:39:51,096 --> 01:39:54,497
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

935
01:39:56,034 --> 01:39:58,093
Then I'll huff...

936
01:39:58,303 --> 01:40:00,203
...and I'll puff...

937
01:40:00,405 --> 01:40:02,464
...and I'll blow your house in!

938
01:40:17,389 --> 01:40:18,754
Please!

939
01:40:19,491 --> 01:40:21,254
Don't!

940
01:40:21,926 --> 01:40:23,450
Don't!

941
01:40:42,047 --> 01:40:43,275
Stop it!

942
01:40:47,519 --> 01:40:49,077
Here's Johnny!

943
01:43:31,149 --> 01:43:32,377
Hello?

944
01:43:37,822 --> 01:43:39,585
Anybody here?

945
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:03,237
Hello?

946
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:17,391
Anybody here?

947
01:44:47,358 --> 01:44:49,292
Anybody here?

948
01:45:30,301 --> 01:45:31,996
Danny-boy!

949
01:48:12,830 --> 01:48:14,764
I'm coming!

950
01:48:17,268 --> 01:48:19,202
I'm coming, Dan!

951
01:49:19,997 --> 01:49:22,397
Great party, isn't it?

952
01:49:40,051 --> 01:49:42,281
I'm coming!!

953
01:49:44,856 --> 01:49:47,154
You can't get away!

954
01:49:51,028 --> 01:49:53,428
I'm right behind you!

955
01:53:18,469 --> 01:53:20,494
- Mommy!
- Danny, come here!

956
01:53:21,705 --> 01:53:23,434
Mommy.

957
01:53:31,782 --> 01:53:33,181
Where...?
