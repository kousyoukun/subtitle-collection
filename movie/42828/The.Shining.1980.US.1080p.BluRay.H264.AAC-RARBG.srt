What line of work are you in now?

I'm a writer.

50
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,122
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

This ought to be
quite a change for you.

52
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,048
Well, I'm looking for a change.

53
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,848
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

54
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:52,641
...I agree with them.

55
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,101
Let's see, where were we?

56
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,889
I was about to explain...

57
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,271
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

58
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,946
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

59
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,944
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?

60
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,619
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

61
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,447
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

62
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,207
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

63
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,577
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

64
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,129
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

65
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,584
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

66
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,713
...to keep it clear.

67
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,297
When the place was built in 1907...

68
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:34,057
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

69
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:39,139
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

70
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,894
It's certainly got plenty of that.

71
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,316
That's right.

72
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,819
Did they give you any idea in Denver...

73
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,692
...about what the job entails?

74
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,990
Only in a very general way.

75
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,238
Well...

76
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,074
...the winters can be fantastically cruel.

77
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,750
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

78
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,951
...and depreciation
which can occur.

79
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,584
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

80
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:08,757
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

81
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,677
...repairing damage as it occurs...

82
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,680
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

83
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,009
That sounds fine to me.

84
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,353
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

85
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:24,728
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

86
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,562
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

87
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:33,283
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

88
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,737
I'm outlining a new writing project.

89

...and isolation...

94
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,379
...can, of itself, become a problem.

95

100
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,733
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

102
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:18,161
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

103

...second thoughts about the job.

104

I'm intrigued.

said anything in Denver...

00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,263
My predecessor in this job...

110
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,471
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

111
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,225
He came up with his wife and
two little girls of about 8 and 10.

112
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,432
He had a good employment record,
good references.

113
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,897
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

114
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,774
...like a completely
normal individual.

115
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,357
But at some point during the winter...

116
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,195
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

117
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,780
He ran amuck...

118
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,376
...and killed his family
with an ax.

119
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,296
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

120
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,803
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

121
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,802
The police thought...

122
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,104
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

which can occur...

Now, Tony, tell me.

161
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,144
DOCTOR: <i>Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.</i>

162
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,860
That's good. Now the other one.

163
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,736
Good boy.

164
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,447
Now, Danny...

165
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,953
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

166
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:36,161
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

167
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:41,129
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

168
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,133
No.

169
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,673
DOCTOR: Do you remember
when you were brushing your teeth?

170
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,554
Yes.

171
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:55,351
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

172
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:03,692
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

173
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,619
Now, Danny, can you remember
what you were doing...

174
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,743
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

175
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,038
Talking to Tony.

176
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,044
Is Tony one of your animals?

177
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:22,881
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

178
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,543
Tony's his imaginary friend.

179
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,006
DOCTOR:
Oh.

180
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:31,884
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

181
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,097
No.

182
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,803
Why not?

183
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,898
Because he hides.

184
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,312
Where does he go?

185
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,236
To my stomach.

186
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:49,154
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

187
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,911
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

188
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,371
Okay.

189
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,956
That's fine.

190
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,543
All right, Danny.

191
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,130
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

192
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,714
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

193
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,047
Do I have to?

194
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,508
Yes. I'd like you to.

195
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,470
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

196
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:19,056
I'll come back and check on you.

197
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:21,099
-Okay.
-Bye.

198
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,736
-Shall we go into the living room?
-Yes.

199
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,288
-Please.
-Thank you.

200
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,538
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

201
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,797
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

202
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,961
Yeah?

203
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,966
Oh.

204
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,600
He seems absolutely fine now.

205
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,142
But you should've seen him.

206
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,557
I know.

207
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,480
Kids can scare you to death.

208
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,517
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

209
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:06,318
And they look much worse
than they are.

210
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,485
But what was the matter with him?

211
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,818
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

212
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:18,865
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

213
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,661
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

214
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,831
...a kind of self-induced trance.

215
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,999
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

216
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:32,004
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

217
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:33,928
No, thank you.

218
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,841
I'm sure you're right.

219
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,182
Have you been in Boulder long?

220
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,309
Only about three months.

221
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,860
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

222
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:52,698
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

223
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:53,942
Tony.

224
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:58,120
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

225
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:01,039
No, um....

226
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,541
Let's see....

227
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,836
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

228
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,710
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

229
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,422
Did he adjust well to school?

230
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,466
No.

231
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,549
He didn't like it too much at first.

232
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:19,053
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

233
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:24,389
Yeah, I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

234
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,768
What sort of injury did he have?

235
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,607
He dislocated his shoulder.

236
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:33,360
How did he manage to do that?

237
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,870
It was just one of
those things, you know.

238
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:42,072
Purely an accident.

239
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,831
My husband had been drinking...

240
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:49,380
...and he came home
about three hours late.

241
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:54,259
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

242
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:59,761
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

243
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:04,270
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

244
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,522
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

245
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:09,771
...you know, in a park or in the street.

246
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,480
But on this particular occasion...

247
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,316
...my husband just used
too much strength...

248
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,118
...and he injured Danny's arm.

249
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:26,705
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said:

250
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,500
"Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

251
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,625
And if I do, you can leave me."

252
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,173
And he didn't.

253
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,880
He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.

254
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:04,654
Boy.

255
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,998
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

256
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:11,670
Mm-hm.

257
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:15,840
Dad?

258
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,010
Yes?

259
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,342
I'm hungry.

260
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:24,925
You should've eaten your breakfast.

261
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,683
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

262
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,519
Okay, Mom.

263
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:36,063
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

264
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,159
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

265
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,615
Oh.

266
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,200
What was the Donner party?

267
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,412
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

268
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,914
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

269
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,344
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

270
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,385
You mean they ate each other up?

271
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,676
They had to in order to survive.

272
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,102
Jack.

273
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,394
Don't worry, Mom.

274
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,942
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

275
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,769
See, it's okay.

276
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,401
He saw it on the television.

277
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,938
-What time does the plane leave?
-8:30.

278
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:54,936
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

279
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,067
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Bye.

280
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:00,396
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

281
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:03,232
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

282
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,318
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

283
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,279
-Hi.
-Is your family having a look around?

284
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,825
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

285
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,160
-Has your luggage been brought in?
-Right there.

286
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:15,577
Oh, fine.

287
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,666
In view of all we have to cover today...

288
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,547
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

289
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:24,253
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

290
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,638
-Fine.
-I'd better collect my family first.

291
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,048
Oh, yes.

292
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,934
This is our Colorado Lounge.

293
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,566
It's beautiful.

294
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,822
My God!

295
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:45,615
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?

296
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,159
It sure is.

297
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:50,162
I've never seen anything
like this before.

298
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,749
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

299
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,372
I believe they're based...

300
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,797
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

301
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,964
They're really gorgeous.

302
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,166
As a matter of fact...

303
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:05,503
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

304
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,847
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

305
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:12,176
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

306
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,346
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

307
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:18,606
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

308
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,146
Lots of movie stars.

309
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,897
Royalty?

310
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,692
All the best people.

311
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,376
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

312
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:23,673
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

313
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,792
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Goodbye, girls.

314
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,045
ULLMAN:
And here are your quarters.

315
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,048
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

316
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,759
And a small bedroom for your son.

317
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,097
Perfect for a child.

318
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,982
-Yeah.
-Yes.

319
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:51,075
ULLMAN: Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

320
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,823
Easy to keep.

321
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,659
Cozy.

322
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,116
ULLMAN:
Yes, very cozy for a family.

323
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,038
If you feel like spreading out...

324
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,916
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

325
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,042
Well, it's very...

326
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,882
...homey.

327
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,253
Yeah.

328
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,048
This is our famous hedge maze.

329
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,557
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

330
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:22,059
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

331
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,893
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

332
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,104
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

333
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,606
WENDY:
When was the Overlook built?

334
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,826
Construction started in 1907.

335
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,996
It was finished in 1909.

336
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,868
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

337
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,701
They actually had to repel...

338
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,834
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

339
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,335
That's our Snowcat.

340
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,340
Can you both drive a car?

341
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,500
BOTH:
Yes.

342
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,172
ULLMAN: That's fine. Basically
the Snowcat operates very much like a car.

343
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,932
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

344
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:01,512
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

345
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,227
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

346
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,018
Oh. He sure did a beautiful job.

347
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,528
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

348
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,698
Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.

349
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,534
Oh, I'll say!

350
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:19,535
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

351
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,909
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

352
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:26,916
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

353
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,214
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

354
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,469
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

355
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,628
We don't drink.

356
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:36,259
Then you're in luck.

357
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:40,719
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

358
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:43,057
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

359
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,973
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

360
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:47,398
Glad to meet you.

361
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:50,435
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

362
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,398
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

363
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,442
It's just wonderful.

364
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,198
Hi, Danny!

365
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,781
I found him outside looking for you.

366
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:05,705
Dan, did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

367
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:07,085
Yeah.

368
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,416
Come on over here.

369
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:10,125
-Thanks.
-Thank you, Susie.

370
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,336
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

371
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,421
...while I continue on with Jack.

372
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:19,056
It would be a pleasure. Right this way.

373
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,804
Great. See you later, hon.

374
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,384
Bye, darling.

375
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:28,106
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

376
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,814
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

377
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,019
I'm a Wendy.

378
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,690
Oh, Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

379
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,525
This is the kitchen, huh?

380
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,326
This is it.

381
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,996
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

382
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,500
Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen.

383
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,085
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

384
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,835
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

385
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,625
Don't let it get you down.

386
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:57,295
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

387
00:25:57,513 --> 00:25:59,721
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

388
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:02,140
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

389
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,470
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

390
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:10,354
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

391
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,652
Right here is our walk-in freezer.

392
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,861
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

393
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,067
You got 15 rib roasts...

394
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,403
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

395

two dozen of pork roast...

Do you like lamb, Doc?

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,001
-No.
-You don't?

399
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,758
What's your favorite food, then?

400
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,835
French fries and ketchup.

401
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,546
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

Come along, now.

Mr. Hallorann...

00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,815
...how'd you know we call him Doc?

405
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:55,019
-Beg your pardon?
-Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

406
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,276
-I did?
-Yeah.

407
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,567
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

408
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,026
But how did you know?

409
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,782
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

410
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,239
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

411
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,665
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

412
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:12,039
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

I can remember when I was
a little boy...

453
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,565
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

454

...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

She called it "shining."

it was just the two of us...

I'm not supposed to.

one by one.

I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

971
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:52,484
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

972
01:21:52,698 --> 01:21:56,317
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

973
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:59,157
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

974
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:02,615
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

them a call on your radio...

01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:09,788
...just to see if everything's okay.

I'll be glad to do that.

Advocaat, is it?

Yes, sir. I think the best thing...

...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...
