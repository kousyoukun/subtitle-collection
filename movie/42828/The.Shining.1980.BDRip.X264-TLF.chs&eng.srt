00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:03,601
面试

5
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,966
嗨 我跟乌尔曼先生约好了的
Hi. I've got an appointment with Mr. Ullman.

6
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,104
我叫杰克.托兰斯
My name is Jack Torrance.

7
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:19,829
在左边第一个门进去就是他办公室
His office is the first door on the left.

8
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,268
谢谢
Thank you.

9
00:03:38,623 --> 00:03:39,487
乌尔曼先生?
Mr. Ullman?

10
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:40,953
我是杰克.托兰斯
I'm Jack Torrance.

11
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,127
快进来 杰克
Come on in, Jack.

12
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:46,753
-很高兴见到你      -我也是
-Very nice to meet you.     -Nice to meet you.

13
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:48,488
这是我的秘书 苏茜
This is my secretary, Susie.

14
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:51,390
-苏茜 你好么?
-这地方不难找吧?
-Susie, how do you do?
-Any trouble finding us?

15
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:54,435
很好找 我在路上花了三个半小时
No problem at all. I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

16
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:56,537
不过旅途非常愉快
That's very good time.

17
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:58,465
坐会吧 杰克
Sit down a minute, Jack.

18
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,471
随便点
Just make yourself at home.

19
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:01,939
要来点咖啡么?
Like some coffee?

20
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:04,635
如果有的话就来点 谢谢
If you're having some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

21
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:05,836
苏茜     好的
Susie.     Sure.

22
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:07,777
去叫比尔.沃森过来
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

23
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:09,416
好的 这就去
Yes, I will.

24
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,420
妈妈
Mom?

25
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,455
干吗
Yeah?

26
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,493
你真的想整个冬天都呆在那间酒店里么?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?

27
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,466
当然啦
Sure I do.

28
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,603
会很好玩的
It'll be lots of fun.

29
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:35,565
是的 我想也是
Yeah. I guess so.

30
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,939
不过 那里肯定没什么人跟我一起玩了
Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.

31
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:44,237
我知道 反正你也不怎么去交新朋友
I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends.

32
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,148
是的 我觉得也是
Yeah, I guess so.

33
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,944
托尼怎么样了
What about Tony?

34
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:52,418
我打赌他肯定很向往去酒店住
He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.

35
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,456
不 我不想呢 托兰斯夫人
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

36
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,157
好了 别这样 托尼 别傻了
Now, come on, Tony. Don't be silly.

37
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:00,526
我不想去
I don't want to go there.

38
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:03,098
你怎么会不想去呢?
How come you don't want to go?

39
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:05,332
我就是不想去
I just don't.

40
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:08,399
在丹佛 他们有告诉过你
Did they give you any idea in Denver...

41
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:10,264
具体的工作职责么?
...about what the job entails?

42
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:12,565
只是总体上讲了一下
Only in a very general way.

43
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,637
这儿的冬天会非常的可怕
The winters can be fantastically cruel.

44
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:21,303
基本上来说 你的工作就是要防止可能发生的
The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage...

45
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:23,506
重大损失和破坏
...and depreciation which can occur.

46
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:26,151
其中包括要开动汽锅
This consists mainly of running the boiler...

47
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:30,311
每天轮流给酒店的不同部分送热
...heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis...

48
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:33,048
并在出现损坏的时候进行维修工作
...repairing damage as it occurs...

49
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:36,251
并且做好维护工作 别让大自然把这儿毁了
...and doing repairs so the elements can't get a foothold.

50
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,490
我觉得应该没问题
That sounds fine to me.

51
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,934
就身体方面来说 这工作并不难
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.

52
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:46,298
唯一让人觉得难受的就是这儿的冬天
The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter...

53
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,961
会让你觉得孤独难耐
...is a tremendous sense of isolation.

54
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:54,803
这正是我想要的
That just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.

55
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,273
我正在构思一本新书
I'm outlining a new writing project.

56
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:01,881
五个月的平静正是我想要的
Five months of peace is just what I want.

57
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:04,381
那就太好了 杰克
That's very good, Jack.

58
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:07,850
因为 对有些人来说
Because, for some people...

59
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:09,820
孤独
solitude

60
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:11,652
和与世隔绝
and isolation

61
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:14,792
本身可能就是个大问题
...can, of itself, become a problem.

62
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:17,189
对我来说不是的
Not for me.

63
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:20,963
那你的妻子和儿子呢?
他们能受得了么?
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

64
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,930
他们也会很喜欢的
They'll love it.

65
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:25,332
太好了
Great.

66
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:31,473
在比尔带你去熟悉环境之前
Before I turn you over to Bill...

67
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:35,169
我想还有件事情我们得谈谈
there's one other thing I think we should talk about.

68
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:36,814
并不是想搞得很戏剧性
Not to sound melodramatic...

69
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:39,576
但是 知道这件事情会让某些人
...but it's been known to give a few people...

70
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:41,980
对这份工作有所迟疑的
...second thoughts about the job.

71
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:44,348
你勾起了我的好奇心
I'm intrigued.

72
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:46,888
我想他们在丹佛并没有跟你说过
I don't suppose they said anything in Denver...

73
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:51,051
在一九七零年这儿发生过桩悲剧
...about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970.

74
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:53,653
他们确实没有提起过
I don't believe they did.

75
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,928
以前干我这个职位的前辈
My predecessor in this job...

76
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,900
雇了一个叫查尔斯.格兰蒂的人做冬季看守
...hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.

77
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:05,632
他和他的妻子以及两个女儿 一个八岁 一个十岁
He came up with his wife and 2 little girls of about 8 and 10.

78
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,834
他的履历非常好 而且倍受推崇
He had a good employment record, good references.

79
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:11,309
就我所知 他好像
And from what I've been told, he seemed...

80
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,209
看起来是个绝对正常的人
...like a completely normal individual.

81
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,782
但是 就在那年冬天某个时候
But at some point during the winter...

82
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:20,614
他好像是彻底精神崩溃了
he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown.

83
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:23,187
就疯了
He ran amuck...

84
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:28,789
拿斧头砍死了自己的家人
...and killed his family with an ax.

85
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:34,693
然后把他们整洁得放在西翼的一间房里
Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing

86
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:39,199
之后 就吞枪自杀了
and then... he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.

87
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,236
警方认为
The police thought...

88
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:46,502
他就是患上了以前所说的幽居病
...that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin fever.

89
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:49,738
如果人们长时间被关在某一地方
A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...

90
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,078
就会产生这种幽居恐惧症
when people are shut in together over long periods of time.

91
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:00,589
这真是
That is...

92
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,315
够戏剧性的了
...quite a story.

93
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:05,094
是的 确实
Yeah, it is.

94
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:09,494
我还是很难相信这儿发生过这种事
It's still hard for me to believe it actually happened here.

95
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:11,527
不过确实发生过
But it did.

96
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:17,329
我想你能理解我告诉你这件事的原因
I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it.

97
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,363
当然
I certainly can.

98
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,435
而且我也明白为什么你在丹佛的同事
I also understand why your people in Denver...

99
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,909
会留给你来告诉我这件事
...left it for you to tell me.

100
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,810
很显然 有些人会因为这地方
Obviously, some people can be put off...

101
00:08:30,017 --> 00:08:34,113
发生过那种事而退缩的
from staying in a place where something like that happened.

102
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:39,223
您大可放心 这种事不会发生在我身上的
You can rest assured that's not going to happen with me.

103
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:43,088
至于我妻子的话
And as far as my wife is concerned...

104
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:47,129
我肯定她听到这事会无比兴奋的
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her.

105
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:50,165
她对鬼故事
She's a confirmed ghost story...

106
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,803
和恐怖电影非常着迷
...and horror film addict.

107
00:08:57,641 --> 00:09:01,338
托尼 你觉得爸爸会得到这份工作么?
Tony, do you think Dad'll get the job?

108
00:09:02,747 --> 00:09:04,942
他已经得到了
He already did.

109
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:09,113
过几分钟 他就会打电话来告诉温蒂了
He 's going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her.

110
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:26,493
嗨 宝贝    嗨 亲爱的怎么样了?
Hi, babe.  Hi, hon. How's it going?

111
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:30,296
太好了 我已经在酒店了还有很多事得做
Great. I'm at the hotel and I still have a lot to go through.

112
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:33,632
我想可能九点十点都回不来的了
I don't think I can get home before 9:00 or 10:00.

113
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,330
看来你好像是得到这份工作了
Sounds like you got the job.

114
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,238
是的 这儿很美
Right. It's a beautiful place.

115
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,572
你和丹尼肯定会喜欢这儿的
You and Danny are going to love it.

116
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,949
托尼 你为什么不想去酒店?
Tony, why don't you want to go to the hotel?

117
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,946
我不知道
I don't know.

118
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,547
你肯定知道 现在 快点告诉我吧
You do too know. Now come on, tell me.

119
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,182
我不想说
I don't want to.

120
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:56,155
求你了
Please.

121
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:58,521
不
No.

122
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,923
来吧 托尼 告诉我吧
Now, Tony, tell me.

123
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:02,246
我们肯定已经上到很高的地方了
空气都完全不同的呢
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

124
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:09,119
爸爸
Dad?

125
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:13,623
我饿了
I'm hungry.

126
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:18,194
你应该把早餐吃了的
You should've eaten your breakfast.

127
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,935
我们一到酒店就给你弄点东西吃 好么?
We'll get you something as soon as we get to the hotel.

128
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:23,765
好的 妈妈
Okay, Mom.

129
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:29,336
这不就是当纳聚会受风雪围困的地方么?
Wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?

130
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,571
我想应该还要再往西点 在深山里
I think that was farther west, in the Sierras.

131
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:38,483
什么是当纳聚会呀?
What was the Donner party?

132
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,686
是指还在使用马车的年代的一群拓荒者
They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times.

133
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:48,189
在某个冬天被风雪围困在了山里
They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.

134
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:52,592
他们不得不嗜食同类以生存下去
They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive.

135
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:56,633
你是说人吃人?
You mean they ate each other up?

136
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:59,929
为了生存 他们不得不这么做
They had to in order to survive.

137
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:01,366
杰克
Jack.

138
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:02,665
别担心 妈妈
Don't worry, Mom.

139
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:07,207
我知道人吃人的事 电视里都有播
I know all about cannibalism. I saw it on TV.

140
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:10,039
看吧 没事的
See, it's okay.

141
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,681
他都在电视上看过了
He saw it all on the television.

142
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:45,207
飞机几点起飞     八点半
What time does the plane leave?   8:30.

143
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:48,176
那我们就有足够的时间来收拾东西
That gives us plenty of time to go over everything.

144
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:50,315
再见 乌尔曼先生    再见
Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.     Bye.

145
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:53,644
早上好 我希望你们没有等得太久
Good morning. I hope you haven't been waiting too long.

146
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:56,480
没关系 我们有时间来吃点东西
No problem. We had time to grab a bite to eat.

147
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,590
很好 很高兴你在厨房关闭之前到达了
Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.

148
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,520
你的家人四处参观去了?
Is your family having a look around?

149
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:05,093
还没呢 我儿子发现了游戏室
No, my son's discovered the games room.

150
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:08,390
你们的行李拿进来了么?      都在那儿了
Has your luggage been brought in?   Right there.

151
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,934
由于我们得在今天搞定一切
In view of all we have to cover today...

152
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:14,797
我想我们还是快去看看你们的房间 开始工作
l suggest we have a quick look at your apartment and get started.

153
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:17,769
把托兰斯的行李送到他们的房间去
Have the Torrances' things brought to their apartment.

154
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:20,670
我得先把我的家人都找回来
I'd better collect my family first.

155
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:31,183
这是科罗拉多休闲室
This is our Colorado Lounge.

156
00:13:31,386 --> 00:13:33,820
真漂亮
It's beautiful.

157
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:36,087
天哪
My God!

158
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,850
这地方真棒 对吧 亲爱的
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?

159
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,390
当然
It sure is.

160
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,868
这是酒店的员工翼
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

161
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:40,177
冬季其它房间都不会供热
None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.

162
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:43,316
再见 乌尔曼先生     再见 姑娘们
Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.    Goodbye, girls.

163
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,541

客厅 卧室 洗手间
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

165
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,246
这间小卧室是你儿子的
And a small bedroom for your son.

166
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,885
给孩子住恰倒好处
Perfect for a child.

167
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,530
远望酒店是什么时候修建的?
When was the Overlook built?

168
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,770
一九零七年始建
Construction started in 1907.

169
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,942
一九零九年才完工
It was finished in 1909.

170
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:15,805
这地方本来是印第安坟场
The site's supposed to be on an Indian burial ground.

171
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:17,640
所以在修建期间
They actually had to repel...

172
00:15:17,848 --> 00:15:20,749
还击退了几次印第安人的袭击
...a few Indian attacks as they were building it.

173
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:23,251
那是雪地车
That's our Snowcat.

174
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:25,978
-你们俩都会开车吧  -是的
-Can you both drive a car?  -Yes.

175
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:30,083
很好 基本上雪地车的操作跟汽车差不多
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat operates very much like a car.

176
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:32,021
用不了多久你们就能熟练操作的了
It won't take you long to get the hang of it.

177
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:34,421
这就是厨房么 哈?
This is the kitchen, huh?

178
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:36,221
是的
This is it.

179
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:39,366
你喜欢么 丹尼? 对你来说够大了么?
How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you?

180
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:42,396
是我见过最大的厨房了
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

181
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:44,968
这地方就跟个迷宫似的
This whole place is such an enormous maze.

182
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:48,733
估计我每次进来都得撒面包屑做标记
I'll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in.

183
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:51,507
别让它把你吓坏了
Don't let it get you down.

184
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:54,202
这儿再大也不过就是个厨房而已
It's big, but it ain't nothing but a kitchen.

185
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:56,609
有很多东西你根本就不需要碰
A lot of this stuff you'll never have to touch.

186
00:15:56,816 --> 00:15:59,045
就算碰了 我也不知道该怎么弄
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.

187
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,379
有一件事情是肯定的 就是你不用为吃的担心
One thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food.

188
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:07,252
你们能在这儿吃上一年
而且还每天都能吃到不同的菜色
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

189
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,552
这是小型冷藏间
Right here is our walk-in freezer.

190
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:14,756
所有的肉都冷藏在这里面
This is where we keep all of our meat.

191

二十条羔羊腿 你喜欢羔羊肉么 医生?
-不.
...and 20 legs of lamb. Do you like lamb, Doc?
-No.

196
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,645
不喜欢? 那你最喜欢吃什么呢?
You don't? What's your favorite food, then?

197
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:34,713
炸薯条加番茄酱
French fries and ketchup.

198
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:37,441
我想我们也能弄出那玩意来吃的 医生
I think we can manage that too, Doc.

199
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:39,381
现在过这边来 小心脚下
Come along, now. Watch your step.

200
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:47,684
哈罗朗先生 你怎么知道我们叫他医生?
How'd you know we call him Doc?

201
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:51,922
-抱歉
-医生 你叫了丹尼两次医生
-Beg your pardon?
Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

202
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:53,531
我有么？
I did?

203
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:57,461
我们有时叫他医生 就像兔巴哥卡通里一样
We call him Doc sometimes, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

204
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,932
不过 你是怎么知道的呢
But how did you know?

205
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:01,663
我想我可能是听到你这么叫他了
I guess I probably heard you call him that.

206
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:04,138
有可能 不过 老实说 我确实不记得
It's possible. But I honestly don't remember...

207
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:06,537
在见到你之后 有那样叫过他
...calling him that since we've been with you.

208
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:08,940
不管怎样 他看起来就像是个医生 不是么?
Anyway, he looks like a Doc, doesn't he?

209
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:11,815
你好么 医生?
What's up, Doc?

210
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,846
这是间库房
Now, this is the storeroom.

211
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:19,419
所有的干货和罐装食物
In here is where we keep...

212
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,421

You know, you got to keep regular if you want to be happy.

225
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,098
怎么样了?     很好
How're you getting on?     Fine.

226
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:18,867
能把托兰斯夫人借我们用用不?
我们要去地下室看看
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

227
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,010
我保证不会很久的
I promise we won't keep her very long.

228
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:24,408
没问题 乌尔曼先生 我正要去拿冰淇淋呢
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just getting to the ice cream.

229
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:26,480
要来点冰淇淋么 医生?     好的
You like ice cream, Doc?     Yes.

230
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:28,318
我就知道你想吃
I thought you did.

231
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,578
在你们回来之前 不介意我带丹尼去吃点冰淇淋吧?
You folks mind if I give Danny some ice cream while we wait?

232
00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:33,618
当然不     我们不介意
Not at all.     We don't mind.

233
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:36,018
很好     你觉得怎么样 医生?
Good.     Sound good to you, Doc?

234
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:38,284
好的 要乖点哟
Okay, you behave yourself.

235
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,161
你喜欢吃哪种冰淇淋呢

今天真是太充实了
It's amazing, all this activity today.

239
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,006
住客和一些员工昨天就走了 不过
The guests and some staff left yesterday, but the...

240
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,643
最后一天总是让人很忙乱
...last day's always hectic.

241
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:01,905
人人都想尽早离开
Everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.

242
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:06,142
到今天下午五点 这儿就跟没人来过一样
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.

243
00:19:06,352 --> 00:19:08,410
就跟间鬼店一样 哈?
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

244
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:17,060
你知道我怎么知道你叫医生的么?
Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?

245
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:26,033
你知道我在说什么 对吧?
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?

246
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:36,500
我记得自己还是个孩子的时候
I can remember when I was a little boy...

247
00:19:36,912 --> 00:19:39,437
我和我奶奶可以
my grandmother and I could hold conversations

248
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:43,482
不张嘴就聊天
entirely without ever opening our mouths.

249
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:46,850
她把这叫做闪灵
She called it "shining."

250
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:51,086
很长一段时间 我都觉得只有我们俩会
And for a long time I thought it was just the two of us...

251
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:53,817
才拥有这种闪灵交流
...that had "the shine" to us.

252
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,520
正如你可能认为只有你一个人一样
Just like you probably thought you was the only one.

253
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,063
不过 还有的人也跟我们一样
But there are other folks...

254
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,997
尽管他们大多不知道 或者是不相信
though mostly they don't know it, or don't believe it.

255
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,108
你有这种能力多长时间了?
How long have you been able to do it?

256
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:18,714
你为什么不想说这个?
Why don't you want to talk about it?

257
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:26,013
我不能说的
I'm not supposed to.

258
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:30,116
谁说你不能说
Who says you ain't supposed to?

259
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:34,962
托尼
Tony.

260
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,594
谁是托尼?
Who's Tony?

261
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:44,470
托尼是住在我嘴里的小男孩
Tony's the little boy that lives in my mouth.

262
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:48,433
托尼就是那个
Is Tony the one that...

263
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:50,202
告诉你某些事情的人?     是的
...tells you things?     Yes.

264
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:57,115
他怎么告诉你这些事情的？
How does he tell you the thing?

265
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:03,252
就像是我睡觉的时候 他就给我看
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things.

266
00:21:03,456 --> 00:21:07,552
但是等我醒过来 并不记得所有的事情
But when I wake up, I can't remember everything.

267
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:13,092
你爸爸妈妈知道托尼的事么?
Does your mom and dad know about Tony?

268
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:18,961
他们知道他会告诉你些事情么?
Do they know he tells you things?

269
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:22,772
托尼叫我绝不能告诉他们
Tony told me never to tell them.

270
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,275
托尼有没有跟你提过这地方的事?
Has Tony ever told you anything about this place?

271
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:31,038
关于远望酒店么?
About the Overlook Hotel?

272
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:35,875
我不知道
I don't know.

273
00:21:36,787 --> 00:21:40,813
现在 好好想想 医生.  想想看.
Now think real hard, Doc. Think.

274
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:48,494
这儿有些坏东西么?
Is there something bad here?

275
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:02,541
你知道么 医生 如果有事发生的话
You know, Doc, when something happens...

276
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:06,371
都会遗留下可寻的线索
it can leave a trace of itself behind.

277
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:08,704
你看 就像
Say, like...

278
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:11,975
某人是不是烤糊了面包片
...if someone burns toast.

279
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:18,750
或许其他事情还会留下其他一些线索
Maybe things that happen leave other kind of traces behind.

280
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:23,361
而那些线索并不是任何人都能发现的
Not things that anyone can notice.

281
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:28,362
但却是拥有闪灵能力的人能看得见的
But things that people who shine can see.

282
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:32,766
就像他们能看到还未发生的事情
Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet...

283
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,202
有时又能看到很久之前发生过的事情
sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago.

284
00:22:40,744 --> 00:22:43,610
我想这些年 在这间酒店
I think a lot of things happened right here...

285
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:47,509
发生了很多事情
in this particular hotel over the years.

286
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,450
而且发生的并不都是好事
And not all of them was good.

287
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:56,383
二三七号房怎么回事呢?
What about room 237?

288
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:01,922
二三七号房?
Room 237?

289
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,324
你害怕二三七号房 是么?
You're scared of room 237, ain't you?

290
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:09,568
不 我不怕
No, I ain't.

291
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:14,904
哈罗朗先生 二三七号房里有什么吗?
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

292
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:17,607
没什么
Nothing.

293
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:21,273
二三七号房里什么都没有
There ain't nothing in room 237.

294
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:24,710
不过 你要没事可千万别去那儿
But you ain't got no business going in there anyway.

295
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,043
离那房间远点
So stay out.

296
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,743
明白么? 离那儿远点
You understand? Stay out!

297
00:24:45,988 --> 00:24:47,717
早上好 亲爱的
Good morning, hon.

298
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:51,488
早饭准备好了
Your breakfast is ready.

299
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:53,888
现在几点了?
What time is it?

300
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:55,960
大概十一点半了
It's about 11:30.

301
00:24:57,866 --> 00:24:59,458
十一点半了 天哪
11:30. Jesus.

302
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:02,835
我想昨天晚上是熬得太晚了
I guess we've been staying up too late.

303
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:04,569
我知道
I know it.

304
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:08,740
我都照你喜欢的口味做的 单面的煎蛋
I made them just the way you like them, sunny-side up.

305
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,600
很好
Nice.

306
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,676
外面真是够漂亮的
It's really pretty outside.

307
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:18,112
吃完早餐跟我一起去散散步怎么样?
How about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast?

308
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:23,051
我想我应该先写点东西
I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first.

309
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,150
有灵感了么?
Any ideas yet?

310
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,819
灵感倒是不少
Lots of ideas.

311
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,551
就是没一个好的
No good ones.

312
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,496
一切都会好的
Something will come.

313
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:37,934
只是得养成每天都进行写作的习惯
It's just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day.

314
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:41,198
就是这样
That's all it is.

315
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:03,114
好的     你输定了
All right.     And you're going to lose.

316
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:06,452
我会抓住你的 你最好跑快点
And I'm going to get you. You'd better run fast!

317
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:12,590
小心
Look out!

318
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,664
我来啦
I'm coming in close.

319
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:17,359
输了的要去做清洁哟
Loser has to keep America clean.

320
00:26:17,604 --> 00:26:19,231
做清洁哟
Keep America clean.

321
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:21,706
丹尼 你赢了
Danny, you win.

322
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,373
我们还是用走的吧
Let's take the rest of this walking.

323
00:26:26,912 --> 00:26:28,311
把手给我
Give me your hand.

324
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:32,746
漂亮吧?     是的
Isn't it beautiful?   Yes.

325
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:51,864
死路
Dead end.

326
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,946
我们走出来了
We made it.

327
00:27:51,454 --> 00:27:52,682
漂亮吧?
Isn't it beautiful?

328
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:16,205
确实很漂亮
It's so pretty.

329
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:23,749
我可没想到有这么大呢 你呢?   没呢
I didn't think it was going to be this big. Did you?   No.

330
00:31:01,723 --> 00:31:03,156
嗨 亲爱的
Hi, hon.

331
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:08,161
怎么样了?
How's it going?

332
00:31:10,732 --> 00:31:11,891
很好
Fine.

333
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,559
今天写了很多东西吧    是的
Get a lot written today?      Yes.

334
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:25,169
很好 天气预报说今天会下雪呢
Good. The weather forecast said it's going to snow tonight.

335
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:32,714
你想让我怎么对付暴风雪呢?
What do you want me to do about it?

336
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:37,014
别这样 亲爱的
Come on, hon.

337
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:39,380
别板着脸不高兴的样子
Don't be so grouchy.

338
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,122
我没有
I'm not...

339
00:31:41,492 --> 00:31:42,686
不高兴
...being grouchy.

340
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:45,692
我只是想快把书写完
I just want to finish my work.

341
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,599
好的 我明白
Okay. I understand.

342
00:31:51,835 --> 00:31:54,429
我等会再拿些三明治过来
I'll come back later with a couple of sandwiches.

343
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:57,106
说不定 到时你还能让我看看你写的东西
Maybe you'll let me read something then.

344
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:01,401
温蒂
Wendy...

345
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:04,205
我跟你解释一下吧
...let me explain something to you.

346
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:08,981
你只要进来打岔 就会让我分心
When you come in and interrupt, you're breaking my concentration.

347
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:10,617
你在转移我的注意力
You're distracting me...

348
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:14,255
我又得花不少时间才能弄清楚刚才到哪儿了
...and it will then take me time to get back to where I was.

349
00:32:14,456 --> 00:32:15,889
明白么?     是的
Understand?     Yes.

350
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,520
很好
Fine.

351
00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:23,424
我们现在定几条规矩吧
We're going to make a new rule:

352
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:25,064
只要我在这儿
Whenever I'm in here...

353
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:27,529
你又听到打字的声音
...and you hear me typing...

354
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:32,270
或者不管你他妈听到我在这儿干吗
...or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here...

355
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:34,770
反正 我在这儿 就说明我在工作
...when I'm in here, that means I am working.

356
00:32:34,974 --> 00:32:37,203
也就是说 你不能进来
That means don't come in.

357
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:39,673
那么 你想你能做到么?     是的
Now, do you think you can handle that?

358
00:32:44,316 --> 00:32:45,441
好吧
Fine.

359
00:32:46,484 --> 00:32:49,783
那你他妈怎么还不给我滚出去?
Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here?

360
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:16,201
没打中
Missed!

361
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:22,612
你手里没雪球咯
Don't have!

362
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:24,578
现在可轮到我动手了
No fair anymore.

363
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:33,308
早就知道了
I knew it.

364
00:35:03,573 --> 00:35:07,064
KDK 12呼叫KDK 1
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1 .

365
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:13,275
KDK 12呼叫KDK 1
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

366
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:16,609
我是KDK 1 收到你的呼叫 完毕
This is KDK 1. We're receiving you. Over.

367
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:20,113
嗨 我是温蒂.托兰斯 现在远望酒店
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.

368
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:23,486
嗨 你们在上边过得怎么样呀? 完毕
Hi, how are you folks getting on up there? Over.

369
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:25,088
过得还不错
We're just fine.

370
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,760
不过电话老是出问题
But our telephones aren't doing too well.

371
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,987
会不会是电话线桩倒了? 完毕
Are the lines down, by any chance? Over.

372
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:35,431
是的 有好几个都给暴风雪打断了 完毕
Yes, quite a few of them are down due to the storm. Over.

373
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:38,932
有没有可能很快就修好呢? 完毕
Any chance of them being repaired soon? Over.

374
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,298
恩 估计不行
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

375
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:43,941
一般冬天他们都不会去那儿 得到春天来了 完毕
Most winters they stay that way until spring. Over.

376
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:47,844
帅哥 这场暴风雪确实很可怕 对吧? 完毕
Boy, this storm is really something, isn't it? Over.

377
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,214
是的 是我们这些年遇到过的最可怕的
Yes. It's one of the worst we've had for years.

378
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:54,979
还有什么能为您做的么 托兰斯夫人?
Is there anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

379
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,614
我想没有了 完毕
I suppose not. Over.

380
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:01,521
如果你们在上边遇到什么问题 就马上来电
If you folks have any problems up there, just give us a call.

381
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:03,021
还有 托兰斯夫人?
And, Mrs. Torrance?

382
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:07,424
如果你们能一直把无线电开着就好了
It might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time.

383
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:09,754
好的 我们会照做的
Okay. We'll do that.

384
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:12,024
能跟您聊会真是太好了
It was real nice talking to you.

385
00:36:12,234 --> 00:36:14,862
再见 完毕 挂机
Bye. Over and out.

386
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:51,962
哈罗 丹尼
Hello, Danny.

387
00:36:57,242 --> 00:36:59,675
过来跟我们一起玩吧
Come and play with us.

388
00:37:04,548 --> 00:37:07,312
过来跟我们一起玩吧 丹尼
Come and play with us, Danny.

389
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:11,016
永远
Forever...

390
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:14,551
永远
...and ever...

391
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:17,516
永远
...and ever.

392
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:50,614
托尼
Tony...

393
00:37:51,623 --> 00:37:53,648
我害怕
...I'm scared.

394
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,691
还记得哈罗朗先生说得话么?
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

395
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:08,203
这就跟书里的图片一样丹尼
It's just like pictures in a book, Danny.

396
00:38:08,405 --> 00:38:10,566
都不是真的
It isn't real.

397
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,173
我能上我房间去把消防车拿过来么?
Can I go up to my room and get my fire engine?

398
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,111
先过来一下
Come here for a minute first.

399
00:39:51,118 --> 00:39:52,915
你怎么样呀 医生?
How's it going, Doc?

400
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,287
过得还开心么?
Having a good time?

401
00:40:01,361 --> 00:40:02,828
开心 爸爸
Yes, Dad.

402
00:40:05,732 --> 00:40:06,959
很好
Good.

403
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,328
我就想让你过得开心
I want you to have a good time.

404
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:13,664
我很开心 爸爸
I am, Dad.

405
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:25,911
你是不是不舒服呀?
Do you feel bad?

406
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:34,153
我只是有点累了
I'm just a little bit tired.

那你为什么不去睡觉呢?
Then why don't you go to sleep?

408
00:40:41,864 --> 00:40:43,422
我不能去睡觉呢
I can't.

409
00:40:44,899 --> 00:40:47,197
还有很多事等着我做呢

永远
...and ever.

420
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,107
爸爸?    怎么了?

What do you mean?

423
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:02,160
是你妈妈跟你说的么?
Did your mother ever say that to you?

424
00:42:02,836 --> 00:42:04,633
说我会伤害你?
That I would hurt you?

425

不是呢 爸爸
No, Dad.

00:45:28,586 --> 00:45:29,814
亲爱的
Honey...

439

440
00:45:40,263 --> 00:45:41,662
我做了个噩梦
I had the most...

441
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:44,459
从来没做过这么可怕的梦

真的超可怕的
It was the most horrible dream.

443

Really.

444
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:57,769
我梦到我
I dreamed that l...

445
00:45:57,979 --> 00:46:00,413
我杀掉了你和丹尼
...that I killed you and Danny.

446
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:05,380
不过 我不只是杀掉了你
But I didn't just kill you.

447
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:09,451
我还把你切成了一小块一小块的
I cut you up into little pieces.

448
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:13,648
天哪
My God.

449
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,920
我肯定是快疯了
I must be losing my mind.

450
00:46:19,198 --> 00:46:21,826
一切都会好的
Everything's going to be all right.

451
00:46:23,935 --> 00:46:26,631
来吧 我们别坐在地板上了
Come on. Let's get up off the floor.

丹尼
Danny!

456
00:46:46,823 --> 00:46:48,757
没事啦
Everything's okay!

457
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:52,120
去你房间里玩吧
Just go play in your room for a while.

458
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:54,520
你爸爸只是头疼而已
Your dad's just got a headache.

459
00:46:55,831 --> 00:46:58,857
丹尼 照我说的做 到你自己房里去玩
Danny, mind what I say. Go play in your room.

460
00:47:00,835 --> 00:47:03,770
亲爱的 我先去把他带出去
Honey, let me just go get him out of here.

461
00:47:03,971 --> 00:47:05,495
马上就回来
I'll be right back.

462
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,467
你为什么不听话呢?
Why don't you mind me?

463
00:47:16,082 --> 00:47:17,913
噢 天哪
Oh, my God.

464
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,518
丹尼 你的脖子是怎么回事?
Danny, what happened to your neck?

465
00:47:23,455 --> 00:47:25,582
丹尼 你的脖子是怎么回事?
Danny, what happened to your neck?

466

是你干的
You did this to him...

467
00:47:56,952 --> 00:47:58,384
是不是?!
...didn't you?!

468
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:02,280
你这个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

是你干的
You did this to him!

470
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:05,992
是不是?!
Didn't you?!

471
00:48:07,327 --> 00:48:08,988
你怎么下得了手?!
How could you?!

472
00:48:09,229 --> 00:48:10,958
你怎么下得了手?!
How could you?!

473
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,905
上帝呀 我为了喝一杯什么都做得出来
God! I'd give anything for a drink.

474
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,451
我愿意就为了杯啤酒
I'd give my goddamn soul...

475
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,143
而他妈的出卖自己的灵魂
...for just a glass of beer.

476

你问我这个真是让我太高兴了 劳埃德
I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd...

481
00:50:30,088 --> 00:50:33,421
因为我钱包里

482
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:36,526
正好有两张二十的 两张十块的

I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.

488
00:50:50,807 --> 00:50:53,173
你还不算太忙 对吧?
You're not too busy, are you?

489

Good man.

491
00:50:58,614 --> 00:50:59,706
你把酒一瓶瓶摆上去
You set them up...

492
00:50:59,982 --> 00:51:02,849

I never laid a hand on him, goddamn it.

508
00:51:59,635 --> 00:52:01,262
我没有呀
I didn't.

509
00:52:03,305 --> 00:52:07,901
我连他头上的一根头发都不会碰的 该死的

只要我还活着
As long as I live...

515

她就永远不会让我忘记发生过的一切

516

我确实伤害过他一次 好吧?

517
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:46,968
但那是个意外

518
00:52:47,278 --> 00:52:49,871
绝对不是有意的

任何人都可能发生的

那他妈都是三年前的事了

The little fucker had thrown all my papers all over the floor.

522

我只是想阻止他

523

一下子就失手了
A momentary loss of muscular coordination.

524
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,295

I mean...

525
00:53:13,835 --> 00:53:17,361
每秒多使了几尺磅的力气
...a few extra foot-pounds of energy...

526
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:20,404
每秒 每秒

Are you out of your fucking mind?

532
00:53:57,139 --> 00:53:59,164
是真的 真的
It's the truth! Really.

533
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:01,366
我发誓 丹尼告诉我的

534

他去了间客房
He went up into one of the bedrooms.

535

The door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bathtub.

00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,690
高速公路已为雪堆所堵塞
Highways are blocked by snowdrifts.

549
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:57,655
铁轨已经结冰
Railroad tracks are frozen.

550
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,885
科罗拉多州官方向悠视网络电视透露

551
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:03,656
至少有三人已由于暴露于暴风雪中致死

552
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:06,163
科罗拉多州长可能
The governor of Colorado is expected...

553
00:55:06,368 --> 00:55:08,097
会发出天气预警
...to declare a weather emergency.

554
00:55:08,303 --> 00:55:10,133
后备役军人
The National Guard might be called out...

555
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:11,531
也将上街道清理路面积雪

556
00:55:11,739 --> 00:55:13,969
气象站预报今晚到明天

557
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:16,166

558
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:19,004
气温将降到零度以下
... with temperatures dropping well below zero.

559
00:55:19,212 --> 00:55:22,204
回到佛罗里达 这里的问题恰好相反
Back here in Florida, we've got the opposite problem.

560
00:55:22,415 --> 00:55:24,645
温度及湿度都将继续上升
The heat and humidity are supposed to climb.

561
00:55:24,851 --> 00:55:26,819
当地的海滩肯定会人满为患
Local beaches should be jammed.

562
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,044
气象专家 沃尔特.克龙
Our weather expert, Walter Cronice...

563
00:55:29,254 --> 00:55:32,519
等会将会在悠视为大家预测本地天气

If you need assistance, please call the operator.

566
01:01:29,476 --> 01:01:31,307
是的 是我
Yes, it's me.

567
01:01:31,512 --> 01:01:32,945
谢天谢地
Thank God.

568
01:01:37,617 --> 01:01:39,380
有什么发现么?
Did you find anything?

569
01:01:39,585 --> 01:01:42,315
不 什么都没有
No. Nothing at all.

570
01:01:42,922 --> 01:01:46,084
我他妈鬼影子都没见到一个
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

571
01:01:48,827 --> 01:01:52,319
你去了丹尼说的那个房间? 二三七号?
You went into the room Danny said? To 237?

572
01:01:52,531 --> 01:01:54,088
是的 去过了
Yes, I did.

573
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:56,362
你什么都没见到?
And you didn't see anything at all?

574
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:58,558
绝对什么都没有
Absolutely nothing.

575
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:00,031
他怎么样了?
How is he?

576
01:02:00,237 --> 01:02:02,034
还在睡觉
He's still asleep.

577
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,565
很好
Good.

578
01:02:09,379 --> 01:02:12,473
等他早上睡醒了就会恢复正常的
I'm sure he'll be himself again in the morning.

579
01:02:16,952 --> 01:02:19,443
你确定你去对了房间?
Are you sure it was the right room?

580
01:02:19,655 --> 01:02:22,817
我是说 或许是丹尼搞错了
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

581
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:25,390
他肯定进了那个房间
He must have gone in that room.

582
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:28,255
门是开着的 灯也亮着
The door was open, the lights were on.

583
01:02:30,898 --> 01:02:33,229
那我就不明白了
I just don't understand it.

584
01:02:37,571 --> 01:02:40,597
那他身上那些瘀伤是怎么回事呢?
What about those bruises on his neck?

585
01:02:42,775 --> 01:02:45,107
肯定有人伤害了他的
Somebody did that to him.

586
01:02:53,384 --> 01:02:54,817
我想
I think...

587
01:02:56,488 --> 01:02:59,048
是他自己干的
...he did it to himself.

588
01:03:05,062 --> 01:03:06,290
不
No.

589
01:03:06,964 --> 01:03:08,989
不可能
That's not possible.

590
01:03:14,303 --> 01:03:17,966
如果他说的话不是真的
Once you rule out his version of what happened...

591
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:20,800
那就没别的解释了
...there is no other explanation.

592
01:03:21,276 --> 01:03:22,607
是么?
Is there?

593
01:03:29,183 --> 01:03:32,175
不管是怎么回事
Whatever the explanation is...

594
01:03:35,623 --> 01:03:37,022
我想 我们
...l think we...

595
01:03:37,224 --> 01:03:39,953
都得带丹尼离开这儿
...have to get Danny out of here.

596
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:46,562
带他离开这儿?
Get him out of here?

597
01:03:50,736 --> 01:03:52,465
你是说
You mean...

598
01:03:53,505 --> 01:03:55,473
离开酒店?
...just leave the hotel?

599
01:04:04,448 --> 01:04:05,914
你们俩真是
It is so...

600
01:04:06,116 --> 01:04:08,550
会在我终于有机会做成点事的时候
...typical of you to create a problem like this...

601
01:04:08,752 --> 01:04:11,277
搞出麻烦来
...when I finally have a chance to accomplish something!

602
01:04:11,488 --> 01:04:14,048
我现在正真正在干事业
When I'm really into my work!

603
01:04:14,257 --> 01:04:18,215
如果我想现在就回去的话 就回得去么?
I could really write my own ticket if I went back now, couldn't l?

604
01:04:18,427 --> 01:04:22,158
开着铲雪当洗车
Shoveling out driveways, work in a car wash.

605
01:04:22,364 --> 01:04:24,456
你觉得怎么样呀?
Any of that appeal to you?

606
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:28,363
我一直让你把我的生活搞得一团糟
I have let you fuck up my life so far...

607
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:32,199
不过 这次我不会让你毁了我的
...but I am not going to let you fuck this up.

608
01:05:43,837 --> 01:05:46,135
晚上好 林务局
Good evening. Forest Service.

609
01:05:46,706 --> 01:05:48,139
我叫狄克.哈罗朗
My name is Dick Hallorann.

610
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:50,774
我是远望酒店的厨师长
I'm the head chef at the Overlook Hotel.

611
01:05:50,976 --> 01:05:53,103
晚上好 有什么能帮到你的么?
Good evening. What can I do for you?

612
01:05:53,312 --> 01:05:56,873
我想打个紧急电话到酒店上去
I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there...

613
01:05:57,082 --> 01:06:00,380
不过接线员说电话线装已经吹倒了
but the operator said that the phone lines are down.

614
01:06:00,585 --> 01:06:04,180
那附近很多电话线桩都由于暴风雪倒塌了
A lot of lines around here are down due to the storm.

615
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:07,051
我不想给您造成任何麻烦的
I hate to put you through any trouble...

616
01:06:07,258 --> 01:06:10,488
不过有家人还待在酒店里 而且还有个小孩子
...but there's a family up there all by themselves with a young kid.

617
01:06:10,694 --> 01:06:12,355
就现在这种暴风雪袭击的情况下
And with this storm and everything...

618
01:06:12,562 --> 01:06:15,463
如果你们能用无线电跟他们联系下 我将非常感谢
I'd appreciate it if you'd give them a call on your radio...

619
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:17,656
就看看他们是不是还好
...just to see if everything's okay.

620
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:19,464
我很高兴为您致电他们
I'll be glad to do that.

621
01:06:19,669 --> 01:06:22,467
您二十分钟之后再打来好么?
Why don't you call me back in about 20 minutes?

622
01:06:22,672 --> 01:06:24,697
非常感谢 我会的
Thank you very much. I'll do that.

623
01:06:24,907 --> 01:06:26,340
好的 先生
All right, sir.

624
01:06:46,659 --> 01:06:48,627
晚上好 托兰斯先生

Good evening.

626
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:16,318
嗨 劳埃德
Hi, Lloyd.

627
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:18,384
我刚才走开了 不过现在又回来了
Been away, but now I'm back.

628
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,384
晚上好 托兰斯先生
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

629
01:07:21,057 --> 01:07:22,046
很高兴见到您
It's good to see you.

630
01:07:22,258 --> 01:07:24,919
回来感觉真好 劳埃德
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

631
01:07:25,561 --> 01:07:27,290
想喝点什么酒 先生?
What'll it be, sir?

632
01:07:28,097 --> 01:07:30,361
给杯能让我一醉方休的
Hair of the dog that bit me.

633
01:07:31,767 --> 01:07:33,427
那就来杯波本威士忌加冰块
Bourbon on the rocks.

634
01:07:34,268 --> 01:07:35,667
就是它了
That'll do her.

635
01:07:49,182 --> 01:07:51,445
免费享用 托兰斯先生
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

636
01:07:52,885 --> 01:07:54,853
免费享用?
No charge?

637
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,479
你的钱在这儿派不上用处了
Your money's no good here.

638
01:08:03,128 --> 01:08:04,857
有人帮您付过了
Orders from the house.

639
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:10,556
有人付过了
Orders from the house.

640
01:08:13,804 --> 01:08:15,795
喝吧 托兰斯先生
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

641
01:08:18,008 --> 01:08:22,535
我想知道是谁帮我付的帐 劳埃德
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

642
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:27,782
你就不用管这个了 托兰斯先生
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance.

643
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:29,917
至少 现在不必要知道
At least, not at this point.

644
01:08:34,723 --> 01:08:37,123
你说了算 劳埃德
Anything you say, Lloyd.

645
01:08:37,559 --> 01:08:39,549
你说了算
Anything you say.

646
01:08:52,539 --> 01:08:55,007
噢 天哪 抱歉 先生
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

647
01:08:56,109 --> 01:08:57,575
噢 天哪 天哪
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

648
01:08:57,776 --> 01:09:00,336
看我把你的夹克搞得一团糟 先生
I've made an awful mess of your jacket, sir.

649
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:05,209
没关系的 我有很多夹克
That's all right. I've got plenty of jackets.

650
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:08,214
这是荷兰蛋酒 恐怕会留下印迹了
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir. It tends to stain.

651
01:09:08,419 --> 01:09:09,545
荷兰蛋酒 是么?
Advocaat, is it?

652
01:09:09,754 --> 01:09:11,915
是的 先生 我想最好是
Yes, sir. I think the best thing...

653
01:09:12,123 --> 01:09:14,318
我陪您到男洗手间去
...is to come along to the gentlemen's room...

654
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:17,049
弄点水洗干净吧 先生
...and we'll get some water to it, sir.

655
01:09:17,894 --> 01:09:21,193
好象你自己身上也弄到了
Looks like you might have got a spot of it on yourself...

656
01:09:21,398 --> 01:09:22,387
侍应老伙计
...Jeevesy old boy.

657
01:09:22,599 --> 01:09:25,761
没关系 先生 您最要紧
That doesn't matter, sir. You're the important one.

658
01:09:26,068 --> 01:09:28,468
你真是个大好人
Awfully nice of you to say.

659
01:09:28,904 --> 01:09:31,771
其实 今晚来参加宴会之前
Of course, I intended to change my jacket this evening...

660
01:09:31,974 --> 01:09:34,238
我就想换到这身衣服的
...before the fish and goose soiree.

661
01:09:34,443 --> 01:09:36,467
非常明智 先生 非常明智
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

662
01:09:36,678 --> 01:09:37,975
好了 我来帮你
Here. I'll just...

663
01:09:38,947 --> 01:09:41,211
把门打开 侍应
...hold this for you there, Jeevesy.

664
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:43,213
谢谢您 先生 谢谢您
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

665
01:09:44,251 --> 01:09:47,880
看看弄点水是不是能洗得掉
Let's see if we can improve this with a little water, sir.

666
01:09:48,088 --> 01:09:49,350
好吧 我把
All right. I'll just...

667
01:09:49,556 --> 01:09:53,753
波本威士忌和蛋酒都放在这儿
...set my bourbon and advocaat down right there.

668
01:09:54,327 --> 01:09:55,760
一会就好了
Won't keep you a moment.

669
01:09:55,962 --> 01:09:57,361
好的
Fine.

670
01:10:00,433 --> 01:10:02,094
他们都怎么叫你的 侍应
What do they call you, Jeevesy?

671
01:10:02,301 --> 01:10:04,860
格兰蒂 先生 戴伯特.格兰蒂
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

672
01:10:09,641 --> 01:10:10,471
格兰蒂?
Grady?

673
01:10:10,675 --> 01:10:12,006
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

674
01:10:13,177 --> 01:10:14,508
戴伯特.格兰蒂
Delbert Grady.

675
01:10:14,712 --> 01:10:16,236
是的 先生
That's right, sir.

676
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:26,387
格兰蒂先生
Mr. Grady...

677
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,249
我以前在哪儿见过你么?
...haven't I seen you somewhere before?

678
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:32,154
怎么呢 不 先生 我觉得没见过
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

679
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:41,031
快弄掉了呢 先生
It's coming off now, sir.

680
01:10:45,973 --> 01:10:47,531
格兰蒂先生
Mr. Grady...

681
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:51,510
你以前是不是做过这儿的看守?
...weren't you once the caretaker here?

682
01:10:51,711 --> 01:10:54,509
怎么 没有呢 先生 没有
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

683
01:10:57,550 --> 01:11:00,882
你结婚了 对么 格兰蒂先生
You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?

684
01:11:01,086 --> 01:11:01,916
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

685
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:05,386
我有老婆 还有两个女儿
I have a wife and two daughters, sir.

686
01:11:06,425 --> 01:11:07,949
那么
And...

687
01:11:09,627 --> 01:11:10,889
他们现在在哪儿
...where are they now?

688
01:11:11,095 --> 01:11:15,156
就在这附近吧 我现在也不太清楚
They're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment.

689
01:11:25,842 --> 01:11:28,241
你就说在这儿做过看守
You were the caretaker here.

690
01:11:29,712 --> 01:11:31,703
我认得出你来
I recognize you.

691
01:11:33,082 --> 01:11:36,142
我在报纸上见过你的照片
I saw your picture in the newspapers.

692
01:11:36,585 --> 01:11:38,347
你
You...

693
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:42,347
把你妻子和女儿都剁成了一块块的
...chopped your wife and daughter up into little bits.

694
01:11:42,857 --> 01:11:44,256
而且
And...

695
01:11:44,893 --> 01:11:46,826
之后你还打爆了自己的脑袋
...then you blew your brains out.

696
01:11:56,736 --> 01:11:58,499
真奇怪 先生
That's strange, sir.

697
01:11:59,505 --> 01:12:02,235
我完全想不起来有这种事
I don't have any recollection of that at all.

698
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:07,776
格兰蒂先生
Mr. Grady...

699
01:12:08,213 --> 01:12:11,546
你以前确实是这儿的看守
...you were the caretaker here.

700
01:12:19,357 --> 01:12:22,121
很抱歉 不能附和您 先生
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

701
01:12:23,994 --> 01:12:25,723
不过 您
But you...

702
01:12:26,463 --> 01:12:28,294
才是看守呀
...are the caretaker.

703
01:12:30,567 --> 01:12:33,467
您一直都是看守
You've always been the caretaker.

704
01:12:36,372 --> 01:12:38,203
我早该知道的 先生
I should know, sir.

705
01:12:39,641 --> 01:12:42,235
我一直都在这儿
I've always been here.

706
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,654
你知道么 托兰斯先生
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

707
01:13:02,895 --> 01:13:04,658
您的儿子
...that your son...

708
01:13:05,064 --> 01:13:07,760
正准备跟外面的人取得联络
...is attempting to bring an outside party...

709
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,162
对付现在的状况
...into this situation?

710
01:13:12,737 --> 01:13:14,432
你知道么?
Did you know that?

711
01:13:20,677 --> 01:13:22,770
是真的 托兰斯先生
He is, Mr. Torrance.

712
01:13:25,115 --> 01:13:26,275
跟谁?
Who?

713
01:13:28,519 --> 01:13:30,145
跟个黑人
A nigger.

714
01:13:34,223 --> 01:13:35,622
黑人?
A nigger?

715
01:13:38,361 --> 01:13:39,793
黑人
A nigger...

716
01:13:39,995 --> 01:13:41,087
厨子
...cook.

717
01:13:47,602 --> 01:13:48,863
怎样?
How?

718
01:13:51,138 --> 01:13:52,901
你儿子
Your son...

719
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:56,138
有特殊的天赋
...has a very great talent.

720
01:13:57,111 --> 01:14:00,602
相信你并没有意识到那有多厉害
I don't think you are aware how great it is.

721
01:14:01,347 --> 01:14:04,578
不过他正准备运用这一天赋
But he is attempting to use that very talent...

722
01:14:04,784 --> 01:14:06,752
来对抗你的意志
...against your will.

723
01:14:15,294 --> 01:14:16,556
那么
Well...

724
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:22,390
他是个非常任性的孩子
...he is a very willful boy.

725
01:14:24,802 --> 01:14:27,201
他确实是 托兰斯先生
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

726
01:14:27,404 --> 01:14:30,305
非常任性的孩子
A very willful boy.

727
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:31,838
真是个一个非常
A rather...

728
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:33,566
淘气的孩子
...naughty boy...

729
01:14:33,777 --> 01:14:36,973
要是我有那么大胆子就好了 先生
...if I may be so bold, sir.

730
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,982
都是他妈妈惯的
It's his mother.

731
01:14:48,123 --> 01:14:49,590
她
She...

732
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:51,782
老是碍手碍脚
...interferes.

733
01:14:54,895 --> 01:14:57,989
或许他们需要
Perhaps they need a good...

734
01:14:58,198 --> 01:14:59,790
被好好教育教育了
...talking-to.

735
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:01,064
如果
If...

736
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:04,031
您不介意我这么说的话
...you don't mind my saying so.

737
01:15:04,837 --> 01:15:06,464
或许
Perhaps...

738
01:15:07,006 --> 01:15:08,701
应该再严厉些
...a bit more.

739
01:15:11,911 --> 01:15:13,138
我的女儿们 先生
My girls, sir...

740
01:15:13,345 --> 01:15:17,145
她们最开始也不在乎远望酒店
...they didn't care for the Overlook at first.

741
01:15:17,816 --> 01:15:21,718
其中一个还偷了一盒火柴
One of them actually stole a pack of matches...

742
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,581
想把这儿给烧掉
...and tried to burn it down.

743
01:15:25,656 --> 01:15:27,317
但是我
But l...

及时纠正了她们的错误 先生
...corrected them, sir.

745
01:15:30,828 --> 01:15:34,957
而且 在我妻子试图阻止我履行职责的时候
And when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty...

746
01:15:35,165 --> 01:15:36,427
我
...l...

747
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:39,526
也及时纠正了她

764
01:17:29,634 --> 01:17:31,226
在如此暴风雪的肆虐下

765
01:17:31,435 --> 01:17:35,564
我想在几个小时后整个机场都会关闭

我只是
I just...

773
01:21:05,259 --> 01:21:06,283
想
...wanted...

774
01:21:06,727 --> 01:21:08,456
跟你谈谈

记不起来了
...l can't.

782
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:52,463
或许是想跟我谈谈丹尼?
Maybe it was about Danny?

783
01:21:54,837 --> 01:21:57,532
或许是想跟我谈谈丹尼
Maybe it was about him.

784
01:22:01,176 --> 01:22:04,475
我想我们应该谈谈丹尼
I think we should discuss Danny.

785
01:22:07,281 --> 01:22:09,078
我想
I think...

01:22:09,483 --> 01:22:13,249
我们应该讨论下要怎么处理他
... we should discuss what should be done with him.

应该怎么处理他呢?

我不知道
I don't know.

789
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:29,824
我觉得你没说实话
I don't think that's true.

790
01:22:30,035 --> 01:22:32,629
我觉得你很清楚
I think you have some very definite ideas...

791
01:22:32,838 --> 01:22:34,533
要拿丹尼怎么办
...about what should be done with Danny.

792
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:37,333
我想知道你是怎么想的
And I'd like to know what they are.

793
01:22:39,243 --> 01:22:41,040
那么 我
Well, l...

794
01:22:41,345 --> 01:22:45,747
我想他应该去看医生
...l think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.

795
01:22:45,949 --> 01:22:49,248
你觉得或许他该去看医生
You think "maybe" he should be taken to a doctor?

796
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:54,820
你觉得或许他该什么时候去看医生呢?
When do you think "maybe" he should be taken to a doctor?

797
01:22:55,457 --> 01:22:56,822
尽快吧?
As soon as possible?

798
01:22:57,426 --> 01:22:59,758
尽快吧?
"As soon as possible?"

799
01:23:02,431 --> 01:23:03,863
求你了
Please.

800
01:23:05,266 --> 01:23:08,531
你觉得他现在身体状况很不好
You believe his health might be at stake.

801
01:23:10,104 --> 01:23:11,628
是的

802
01:23:12,973 --> 01:23:15,601
而且你很关心他
And you are concerned about him.

我当然关心你
Of course I am.

805
01:23:22,615 --> 01:23:24,845
你当然关心我
Of course you are!

806
01:23:25,051 --> 01:23:28,179
那你有没有考虑过我的职责?
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?

807
01:23:28,387 --> 01:23:29,877
你在说什么呀?
What are you talking about?

808
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:32,921
你有没有任何时候
Have you ever had a single moment's...

809
01:23:33,124 --> 01:23:35,183
考虑过我的职责?

810
01:23:35,393 --> 01:23:37,657
你有没有任何时候考虑过
Have you ever thought for a single moment...

811

我对我老板应当承担的职责?
...about my responsibilities to my employers?!

812
01:23:40,931 --> 01:23:42,762
你到底有没有想过
Has is ever occurred to you...

813
01:23:42,967 --> 01:23:46,459
我承诺要在五月一日之前都看守这间酒店?
...that I have agreed to look after the hotel until May 1st?

814
01:23:46,704 --> 01:23:48,729
你到底在不在乎
Does it matter to you at all...

815
01:23:48,939 --> 01:23:52,032
老板对我寄予了所有的信任
...that the owners have placed their complete confidence in me...

816
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:55,369
你到底在不在乎我是签了合同的
...and that I have signed a letter of agreement...

817
01:23:55,578 --> 01:23:58,172
是接受了我所需要承担的职责的?
...in which I've accepted that responsibility?

818
01:23:58,648 --> 01:24:00,672
你有没有稍微考虑过
Do you have the slightest idea...

819
01:24:00,882 --> 01:24:04,113
道德和伦理界限? 有没有?!
...what a moral and ethical principal is? Do you?!

820
01:24:04,486 --> 01:24:07,580
你有没有考虑过一下 如果我不履行职责
Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future...

821
01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:10,188
会对我的将来造成什么样的影响?
...if I fail to live up to my responsibilities?

822
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:12,689
你到底有没有想过? 有没有?!
Has it ever occurred to you? Has it?!

823
01:24:12,893 --> 01:24:14,417
离我远点
Stay away from me!

824
01:24:15,296 --> 01:24:16,354
为什么?
Why?

825
01:24:16,664 --> 01:24:19,632
我只是想回自己房间去了
I just want to go back to my room.

826
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:21,095
为什么?
Why?

827
01:24:21,735 --> 01:24:22,599
那么
Well...

828
01:24:23,737 --> 01:24:25,762
我很困惑
...I'm very confused.

829
01:24:26,906 --> 01:24:30,568
我只是想有个机会把所有事都想清楚
And I just need a chance to think things over.

830
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:35,546
你他妈这一辈子都在考虑考虑
You've had your whole fucking life to think things over!

831
01:24:35,748 --> 01:24:38,511
现在花多几分钟去考虑又会怎样?
What good's a few minutes more going to do you now?

832
01:24:39,484 --> 01:24:40,974
离我远点
Stay away from me!

833
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:42,616
求你了
Please!

834
01:24:43,388 --> 01:24:44,446
别伤害我
Don't hurt me.

835
01:24:44,656 --> 01:24:45,987
我不会伤害你的
I'm not going to hurt you.

836
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:47,383
离我远点
Stay away from me!

837
01:24:47,591 --> 01:24:48,455

838
01:24:48,659 --> 01:24:49,648
亲爱的
Darling.

839
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:51,418
我的生命之光

840
01:24:51,862 --> 01:24:53,193
我不会伤害你的
I'm not going to hurt you.

841
01:24:53,397 --> 01:24:55,388
你还没让我说完呢
You didn't let me finish my sentence.

842
01:24:55,599 --> 01:24:57,793
我说了 我不会伤害你的
I said, "I'm not going to hurt you."

843
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,764
我就是想打烂你的脑袋
I'm just going to bash your brains in.

844
01:25:01,037 --> 01:25:04,006
就想在这儿把你的脑袋给打烂
I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.

845
01:25:05,074 --> 01:25:06,631
走开
Stay away from me!

846
01:25:07,142 --> 01:25:08,166
走开
Stay away from me!

847
01:25:08,376 --> 01:25:10,776
我不会伤害你的
I'm not going to hurt you.

848
01:25:11,046 --> 01:25:12,570
离我远点
Stay away from me!

849
01:25:12,814 --> 01:25:13,872
走开
Stay away!

850
01:25:14,749 --> 01:25:15,976

853
01:25:21,021 --> 01:25:22,318
把那球棒放下 温蒂
Put that bat down, Wendy.

854
01:25:22,523 --> 01:25:24,013
Stop it!

855
01:25:25,491 --> 01:25:26,617
住手
Give me the bat.

856
01:25:26,826 --> 01:25:27,952
求你了
Please!

857

把棒子给我

01:25:33,665 --> 01:25:35,292
走开点     别再挥球棒了
Stay away from me.     Stop swinging the bat.

861

住手     快给我
Stop it!     Give me the bat.

865
01:25:43,741 --> 01:25:44,765
该死的
Goddamn--!

866
01:27:00,042 --> 01:27:01,737
你在干吗?
What are you doing?

867
01:27:04,547 --> 01:27:06,014
等等
Wait a minute.

868
01:27:07,416 --> 01:27:09,406

你在干吗?
What are you doing?

870
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:28,857

让我出去 你他妈把门给我打开
Let me out of here! Open the goddamn door!

875

876
01:27:46,284 --> 01:27:49,219

Let me out and I'll forget the whole goddamn thing.

877
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:51,888
就当什么都没发生过
It'll be just like nothing ever happened.

878

885

我准备今天开雪地车
I'm going to try...

886
01:28:47,606 --> 01:28:50,598
把丹尼
...to get Danny down the Sidewinder...

887
01:28:51,308 --> 01:28:53,674
带下赛得万能达去
...in the Snowcat today.

888
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:57,744
我要带他去看医生
I'll bring back a doctor.

889

你哪儿都去不了
You're not going anywhere.

892
01:29:21,969 --> 01:29:26,099
去检查下雪地车和无线电  你就知道我说的是什么惊喜了

897

戴伯特.格兰蒂
Delbert Grady.

898
01:31:36,556 --> 01:31:38,148
格兰蒂?
Grady?

899
01:31:58,610 --> 01:32:00,440
哈罗 格兰蒂
Hello, Grady.

900
01:32:05,115 --> 01:32:06,912
托兰斯先生
Mr. Torrance...

901
01:32:08,851 --> 01:32:12,582
我看你很难处理得了
...l see you can hardly have taken care of the...

902
01:32:13,322 --> 01:32:15,813
我们所谈过的问题呀
...business we discussed.

903
01:32:22,531 --> 01:32:25,466
没必要一直戳我的痛处吧 格兰蒂先生
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

904
01:32:26,334 --> 01:32:30,394
只要我一出去 就能搞得定
I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.

905
01:32:31,272 --> 01:32:34,002
真的能么 托兰斯先生?
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

906
01:32:34,508 --> 01:32:36,339
我很怀疑
I wonder.

907
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,603
我真的很怀疑
I have my doubts.

908
01:32:40,814 --> 01:32:45,046
我 还有其他人开始觉得
I, and others, have come to believe...

909
01:32:45,251 --> 01:32:48,242
你的心根本就不属于这儿
...that your heart is not in this.

910
01:32:48,887 --> 01:32:51,412
你对这儿根本就没兴趣
That you haven't the belly for it.

911
01:32:57,595 --> 01:33:01,895
再给我次机会证明自己吧 格兰蒂先生
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.

912
01:33:02,733 --> 01:33:04,667
我就这么点要求
That's all I ask.

913
01:33:06,203 --> 01:33:10,469
你妻子看来比我们想象的要坚强得多 托兰斯先生
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

914
01:33:10,674 --> 01:33:12,141
而且比想象的更
Somewhat more...

915
01:33:12,342 --> 01:33:14,309
足智多谋
...resourceful.

916
01:33:14,577 --> 01:33:17,341
她好象比你要强得多
She seems to have got the better of you.

917
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:23,245
暂时的 格兰蒂先生
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

918
01:33:23,985 --> 01:33:26,146
只是暂时的
Only for the moment.

919
01:33:28,056 --> 01:33:32,220
恐怕你不得不拿出最强硬的手段
I fear you will have to deal with this matter...

920
01:33:32,494 --> 01:33:36,156
来处理现在这种状况了 托兰斯先生
...in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.

921
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:38,288
恐怕
I fear...

922
01:33:38,565 --> 01:33:41,125
这也是你唯一能做的了
...that is the only thing to do.

923
01:33:44,604 --> 01:33:46,697
我可没期望过
There's nothing I look forward to...

924
01:33:46,906 --> 01:33:50,808
心平气和的解决这个问题 格兰蒂先生
...with greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.

925
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:54,940
你确定 是么 托兰斯先生?
You give your word on that, do you, Mr. Torrance?

926
01:33:56,414 --> 01:33:58,439
我保证
I give you my word.
