What line of work are you in now?

I'm a writer.

50
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:42,135
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

This ought to be
quite a change for you.

52
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:47,056
Well, I'm looking for a change.

53
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:50,852
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

54
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,645
...I agree with them.

55
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,106
Let's see, where were we?

56
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,900
I was about to explain...

57
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:02,280
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

58
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,950
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

59
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:08,953
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?

60
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:12,623
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

61
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,460
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

62
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,212
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

63
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,590
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

64
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,134
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

65
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,596
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

66
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,723
...to keep it clear.

67
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,309
When the place was built in 1907...

68
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:34,062
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

69
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,150
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

70
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,903
It's certainly got plenty of that.

71
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,321
That's right.

72
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,824
Did they give you any idea in Denver...

73
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,701
...about what the job entails?

74
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,995
Only in a very general way.

75
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,247
Well...

76
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,084
...the winters can be fantastically cruel.

77
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:59,754
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

78
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,964
...and depreciation
which can occur.

79
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:04,592
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

80
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:08,763
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

81
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,682
...repairing damage as it occurs...

82
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,685
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

83
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,022
That sounds fine to me.

84
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,359
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

85
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,737
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

86
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,573
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

87
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,287
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

88
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,749
I'm outlining a new writing project.

89

93
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,221
...and isolation...

94
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:53,391
...can, of itself, become a problem.

95
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,768

Well, before I turn you over to Bill...

100
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,744
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

101

Not to sound melodramatic...

102
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,166
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

103

...second thoughts about the job.

104

I'm intrigued.

105

said anything in Denver...

00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:37,268
My predecessor in this job...

110
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:40,479
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

111
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:44,233
He came up with his wife and
two little girls of about 8 and 10.

112
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,445
He had a good employment record,
good references.

113
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,906
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

114
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,783
...like a completely
normal individual.

115
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,369
But at some point during the winter...

116
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:59,207
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

117
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,792
He ran amuck...

118
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,381
...and killed his family
with an ax.

119
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:13,304
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

120
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,808
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

121
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:20,811
The police thought...

122
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,107
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

which can occur...

Now, Tony, tell me.

161
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,149
DOCTOR: <i>Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.</i>

162
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,864
That's good. Now the other one.

163
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,742
Good boy.

164
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,459
Now, Danny...

165
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,962
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

166
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,173
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

167
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,137
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

168
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:45,141
No.

169
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,686
DOCTOR: Do you remember
when you were brushing your teeth?

170
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,563
Yes.

171
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:55,359
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

172
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,701
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

173
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,622
Now, Danny, can you remember
what you were doing...

174
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,750
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

175
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,046
Talking to Tony.

176
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:19,049
Is Tony one of your animals?

177
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,887
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

178
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,556
Tony's his imaginary friend.

179
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,016
DOCTOR:
Oh.

180
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,896
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

181
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,106
No.

182
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,816
Why not?

183
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,903
Because he hides.

184
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,322
Where does he go?

185
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,241
To my stomach.

186
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,163
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

187
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,920
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

188
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,380
Okay.

189
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,965
That's fine.

190
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,551
All right, Danny.

191
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:06,138
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

192
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:09,725
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

193
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,060
Do I have to?

194
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,521
Yes. I'd like you to.

195
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,482
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

196
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,068
I'll come back and check on you.

197
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:21,111
- Okay.
- Bye.

198
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,745
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.

199
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,292
- Please.
- Thank you.

200
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:43,551
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

201
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,805
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

202
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:49,974
Yeah?

203
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,976
Oh.

204
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:55,604
He seems absolutely fine now.

205
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,147
But you should've seen him.

206
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,566
I know.

207
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,484
Kids can scare you to death.

208
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,529
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

209
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,323
And they look much worse
than they are.

210
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,493
But what was the matter with him?

211
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:13,831
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

212
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:18,877
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

213
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,673
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

214
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,843
...a kind of self-induced trance.

215
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,012
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

216
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,016
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

217
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,934
No, thank you.

218
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,854
I'm sure you're right.

219
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,191
Have you been in Boulder long?

220
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,319
Only about three months.

221
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,864
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

222
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:52,703
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

223
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:53,954
Tony.

224
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:58,125
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

225
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:01,045
No, um....

226
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,546
Let's see....

227
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,841
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

228
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,719
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

229
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,430
Did he adjust well to school?

230
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,474
No.

231
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,559
He didn't like it too much at first.

232
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:19,063
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

233
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:24,401
Yeah, I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

234
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,780
What sort of injury did he have?

235
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,616
He dislocated his shoulder.

236
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,369
How did he manage to do that?

237
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:39,875
It was just one of
those things, you know.

238
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,086
Purely an accident.

239
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,839
My husband had been drinking...

240
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:49,385
...and he came home
about three hours late.

241
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:54,264
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

242
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,770
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

243
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:04,274
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

244
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,528
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

245
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,780
...you know, in a park or in the street.

246
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,492
But on this particular occasion...

247
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,328
...my husband just used
too much strength...

248
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,123
...and he injured Danny's arm.

249
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:26,714
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said:

250
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,508
"Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

251
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,635
And if I do, you can leave me."

252
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,178
And he didn't.

253
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:37,891
He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.

254
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,668
Boy.

255
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:09,006
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

256
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,675
Mm-hm.

257
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,846
Dad?

258
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,015
Yes?

259
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,350
I'm hungry.

260
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,938
You should've eaten your breakfast.

261
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:28,692
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

262
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,527
Okay, Mom.

263
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:36,074
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

264
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,163
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

265
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,623
Oh.

266
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,209
What was the Donner party?

267
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,423
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

268
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,927
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

269
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:59,348
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

270
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,393
You mean they ate each other up?

271
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,688
They had to in order to survive.

272
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,106
Jack.

273
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,399
Don't worry, Mom.

274
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:13,946
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

275
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,782
See, it's okay.

276
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,409
He saw it on the television.

277
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,942
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.

278
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,945
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

279
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,072
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.

280
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,409
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

281
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,245
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

282
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,331
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

283
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,292
- Hi.
- Is your family having a look around?

284
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,837
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

285
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,172
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.

286
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,591
Oh, fine.

287
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,676
In view of all we have to cover today...

288
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,555
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

289
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,266
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

290
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,643
- Fine.
- I'd better collect my family first.

291
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,061
Oh, yes.

292
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,946
This is our Colorado Lounge.

293
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,574
It's beautiful.

294
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,826
My God!

295
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,621
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?

296
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,164
It sure is.

297
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:50,167
I've never seen anything
like this before.

298
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,754
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

299
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,380
I believe they're based...

300
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,800
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

301
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,969
They're really gorgeous.

302
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,179
As a matter of fact...

303
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,515
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

304
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,852
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

305
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:12,189
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

306
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,359
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

307
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,612
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

308
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,155
Lots of movie stars.

309
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,907
Royalty?

310
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,700
All the best people.

311
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:19,381
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

312
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,677
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

313
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,805
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.

314
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,057
ULLMAN:
And here are your quarters.

315
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,060
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

316
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,771
And a small bedroom for your son.

317
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,110
Perfect for a child.

318
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,987
- Yeah.
- Yes.

319
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:51,079
ULLMAN: Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

320
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,831
Easy to keep.

321
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,668
Cozy.

322
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,129
ULLMAN:
Yes, very cozy for a family.

323
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,048
If you feel like spreading out...

324
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,925
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

325
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,055
Well, it's very...

326
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:09,890
...homey.

327
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,266
Yeah.

328
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,062
This is our famous hedge maze.

329
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,566
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

330
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:22,069
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

331
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,905
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

332
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,116
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

333
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:31,620
WENDY:
When was the Overlook built?

334
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,831
Construction started in 1907.

335
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,000
It was finished in 1909.

336
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,878
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

337
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,713
They actually had to repel...

338
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,841
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

339
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,344
That's our Snowcat.

340
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,346
Can you both drive a car?

341
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:50,514
BOTH:
Yes.

342
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,184
ULLMAN: That's fine. Basically
the Snowcat operates very much like a car.

343
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,937
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

344
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:01,525
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

345
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,236
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

346
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,030
Oh. He sure did a beautiful job.

347
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,533
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

348
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,702
Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.

349
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,539
Oh, I'll say!

350
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:19,543
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

351
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,921
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

352
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,925
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

353
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:30,220
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

354
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,473
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

355
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,641
We don't drink.

356
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,268
Then you're in luck.

357
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:40,730
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

358
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,066
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

359
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,986
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

360
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,404
Glad to meet you.

361
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,448
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

362
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:54,411
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

363
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,454
It's just wonderful.

364
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,206
Hi, Danny!

365
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,793
I found him outside looking for you.

366
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:05,714
Dan, did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

367
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:07,090
Yeah.

368
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,425
Come on over here.

369
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,135
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Susie.

370
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:14,347
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

371
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,433
...while I continue on with Jack.

372
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,060
It would be a pleasure. Right this way.

373
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,812
Great. See you later, hon.

374
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,397
Bye, darling.

375
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:28,111
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

376
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,822
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

377
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,032
I'm a Wendy.

378
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:35,702
Oh, Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

379
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,537
This is the kitchen, huh?

380
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,331
This is it.

381
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,000
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

382
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,503
Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen.

383
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,089
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

384
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,843
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

385
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,638
Don't let it get you down.

386
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,307
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

387
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,726
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

388
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,145
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

389
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:05,482
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

390
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,362
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

391
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,657
Right here is our walk-in freezer.

392
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:17,869
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

393
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,080
You got 15 rib roasts...

394
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,415
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

395

about 40 chickens...

two dozen of pork roast...

...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

398
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,010
- No.
- You don't?

399
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,762
What's your favorite food, then?

400
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,847
French fries and ketchup.

401
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,558
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

Come along, now.

Mr. Hallorann...

00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,819
...how'd you know we call him Doc?

405
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:55,031
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

406
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,284
- I did?
- Yeah.

407
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,578
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

408
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,038
But how did you know?

409
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,791
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

410
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,252
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

411
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,671
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

412
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,048
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

I can remember when I was
a little boy...

453
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,574
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

454
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:46,619
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

455

She called it "shining."

it was just the two of us...

...that had "the shine" to us.

00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:29,162
I'm not supposed to.

...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

I hate to put you through
any trouble...

them a call on your radio...

I'll be glad to do that.
