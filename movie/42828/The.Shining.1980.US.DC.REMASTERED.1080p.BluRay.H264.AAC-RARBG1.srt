1
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,779
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:16,948
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:19,659
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,119
Thank you.

5
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:39,512
- Mr. Ullman?
- Yes.

6
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:42,974
- I'm Jack Torrance.
- Oh, come on in, Jack.

7
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,603
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

8
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,813
- This is my secretary, Susie.
- Hello.

9
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,232
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?

10
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:54,277
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

11
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:56,362
That's very good time.

12
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:58,323
Sit down a minute, Jack.

13
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,325
Just make yourself at home.

14
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,784
Like some coffee?

15
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:04,495
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

16
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:05,663
- Susie.
- Sure.

17
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:07,624
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

18
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,250
Yes, I will.

19
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,262
Mom?

20
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:23,306
Yeah?

21
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,352
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

22
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:29,312
Sure I do.

23
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,439
It'll be lots of fun.

24
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,401
Yeah. I guess so.

25
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,781
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

26
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:44,202
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

27
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,997
Yeah, I guess so.

28
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:49,791
What about Tony?

29
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,377
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

30
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,296
<i>No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.</i>

31
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,132
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

32
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,551
<i>I don't want to go there.</i>

33
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,054
How come you don't want to go?

34
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,306
<i>I just don't.</i>

35
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,393
Let's just wait and see.

36
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:11,354
We're all going to have
a real good time.

37
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,191
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

38
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,818
How do you do, Bill?

39
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,987
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

40
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,114
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

41
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:25,451
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

42
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:28,621
I'd like you to take him around
soon as we're through.

43
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:29,789
Fine.

44
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:31,958
Jack is a schoolteacher.

45
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,585
Uh, formerly a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,462
What line of work are you in now?

47
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,256
I'm a writer.

48
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:42,135
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

49
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,303
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

50
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:47,056
Well, I'm looking for a change.

51
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:50,852
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

52
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,645
...I agree with them.

53
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,106
Let's see, where were we?

54
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,900
I was about to explain...

55
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:02,280
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

56
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,950
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

57
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:08,953
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?

58
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:12,623
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

59
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,460
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

60
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,212
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

61
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,590
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

62
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,134
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

63
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,596
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

64
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,723
...to keep it clear.

65
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,309
When the place was built in 1907...

66
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:34,062
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

67
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,150
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

68
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,903
It's certainly got plenty of that.

69
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,321
That's right.

70
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,824
Did they give you any idea in Denver...

71
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,701
...about what the job entails?

72
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,995
Only in a very general way.

73
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,247
Well...

74
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,084
...the winters can be fantastically cruel.

75
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:59,754
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

76
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,964
...and depreciation
which can occur.

77
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:04,592
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

78
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:08,763
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

79
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,682
...repairing damage as it occurs...

80
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,685
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

81
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,022
That sounds fine to me.

82
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,359
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

83
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,737
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

84
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,573
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

85
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,287
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

86
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,749
I'm outlining a new writing project.

87
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,461
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

88
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,964
That's very good, Jack.

89
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:46,425
Because, for some people...

90
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,386
...solitude...

91
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,221
...and isolation...

92
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:53,391
...can, of itself, become a problem.

93
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,768
Not for me.

94
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,564
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

95
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:02,525
They'll love it.

96
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:03,901
Great.

97
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:10,074
Well, before I turn you over to Bill...

98
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,744
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

99
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:15,413
Not to sound melodramatic...

100
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,166
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

101
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,585
...second thoughts about the job.

102
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm intrigued.

103
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,464
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

104
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:29,635
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

105
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,263
I don't believe they did.

106
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:34,765
Well....

107
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:37,268
My predecessor in this job...

108
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:40,479
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

109
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:44,233
He came up with his wife and
two little girls of about 8 and 10.

110
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,445
He had a good employment record,
good references.

111
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,906
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

112
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,783
...like a completely
normal individual.

113
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,369
But at some point during the winter...

114
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:59,207
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

115
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,792
He ran amuck...

116
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,381
...and killed his family
with an ax.

117
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:13,304
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

118
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,808
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

119
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:20,811
The police thought...

120
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,107
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

121
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:28,319
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

122
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:32,657
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

123
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,327
Wow.

124
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,163
That is...

125
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:40,915
...quite a story.

126
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,668
Yeah, it is.

127
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:48,089
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

128
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,132
But it did.

129
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:51,717
And, uh...

130
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:55,930
...I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

131
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,975
I certainly can.

132
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:02,019
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

133
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,522
...left it for you to tell me.

134
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,401
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

135
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:12,697
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

136
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:17,827
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

137
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,706
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

138
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:25,710
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

139
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:28,754
She's a confirmed ghost story...

140
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,382
...and horror film addict.

141
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,932
Tony, do you think Dad'll get the job?

142
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,561
<i>He already did.</i>

143
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:47,732
<i>He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.</i>

144
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:02,204
Hello.

145
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:05,082
- Hi, babe.
<i>- Hi, hon. How's it going?</i>

146
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,919
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.

147
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:12,256
I don't think I can get home
before 9:00 or 10:00.

148
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,924
Sounds like you got the job.

149
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,844
Right. It's a beautiful place.

150
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:19,180
You and Danny are going to love it.

151
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,559
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

152
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,561
<i>I don't know.</i>

153
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:30,149
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

154
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,777
<i>I don't want to.</i>

155
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:34,779
Please.

156
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,114
<i>No.</i>

157
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,533
Now, Tony, tell me.

158
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,149
<i>Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.</i>

159
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,864
That's good. Now the other one.

160
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,742
Good boy.

161
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,459
Now, Danny...

162
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,962
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

163
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,173
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

164
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,137
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

165
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:45,141
No.

166
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,686
Do you remember when you
were brushing your teeth?

167
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,563
Yes.

168
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:55,359
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

169
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,701
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

170
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,622
Now, Danny, can you remember
what you were doing...

171
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,750
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

172
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,046
Talking to Tony.

173
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:19,049
Is Tony one of your animals?

174
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,887
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

175
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,556
Tony's his imaginary friend.

176
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,016
Oh.

177
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,896
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

178
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,106
No.

179
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,816
Why not?

180
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,903
Because he hides.

181
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,322
Where does he go?

182
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,241
To my stomach.

183
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,163
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

184
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,920
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

185
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,380
Okay.

186
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,965
That's fine.

187
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,551
All right, Danny.

188
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:06,138
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

189
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:09,725
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

190
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,060
Do I have to?

191
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,521
Yes. I'd like you to.

192
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,482
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

193
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,068
I'll come back and check on you.

194
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:21,111
- Okay.
- Bye.

195
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,745
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.

196
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,292
- Please.
- Thank you.

197
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:43,551
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

198
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,805
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

199
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:49,974
Yeah?

200
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,976
Oh.

201
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:55,604
He seems absolutely fine now.

202
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,147
But you should've seen him.

203
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,566
I know.

204
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,484
Kids can scare you to death.

205
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,529
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

206
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,323
And they look much worse
than they are.

207
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,493
But what was the matter with him?

208
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:13,831
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

209
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:18,877
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

210
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,673
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

211
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,843
...a kind of self-induced trance.

212
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,012
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

213
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,016
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

214
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,934
No, thank you.

215
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,854
I'm sure you're right.

216
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,191
Have you been in Boulder long?

217
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,319
Only about three months.

218
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,864
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

219
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:52,703
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

220
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:53,954
Tony.

221
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:58,125
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

222
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:01,045
No, um....

223
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,546
Let's see....

224
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,841
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

225
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,719
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

226
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,430
Did he adjust well to school?

227
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,474
No.

228
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,559
He didn't like it too much at first.

229
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:19,063
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

230
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:24,401
Yeah, I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

231
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,780
What sort of injury did he have?

232
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,616
He dislocated his shoulder.

233
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,369
How did he manage to do that?

234
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:39,875
It was just one of
those things, you know.

235
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,086
Purely an accident.

236
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,839
My husband had been drinking...

237
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:49,385
...and he came home
about three hours late.

238
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:54,264
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

239
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,770
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

240
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:04,274
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

241
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,528
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

242
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,780
...you know, in a park or in the street.

243
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,492
But on this particular occasion...

244
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,328
...my husband just used
too much strength...

245
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,123
...and he injured Danny's arm.

246
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:26,714
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said:

247
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,508
"Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

248
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,635
And if I do, you can leave me."

249
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,178
And he didn't.

250
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:37,891
He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.

251
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,668
Boy.

252
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:09,006
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

253
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,675
Mm-hm.

254
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,846
Dad?

255
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,015
Yes?

256
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,350
I'm hungry.

257
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,938
You should've eaten your breakfast.

258
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:28,692
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

259
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,527
Okay, Mom.

260
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:36,074
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

261
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,163
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

262
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,623
Oh.

263
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,209
What was the Donner party?

264
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,423
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

265
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,927
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

266
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:59,348
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

267
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,393
You mean they ate each other up?

268
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,688
They had to in order to survive.

269
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,106
Jack.

270
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,399
Don't worry, Mom.

271
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:13,946
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

272
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,782
See, it's okay.

273
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,409
He saw it on the television.

274
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,942
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.

275
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,945
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

276
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,072
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.

277
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,409
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

278
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,245
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

279
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,331
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

280
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,292
- Hi.
- Is your family having a look around?

281
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,837
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

282
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,172
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.

283
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,591
Oh, fine.

284
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,676
In view of all we have to cover today...

285
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,555
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

286
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,266
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

287
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,643
- Fine.
- I'd better collect my family first.

288
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,061
Oh, yes.

289
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,946
This is our Colorado Lounge.

290
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,574
It's beautiful.

291
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,826
My God!

292
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,621
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?

293
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,164
It sure is.

294
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:50,167
I've never seen anything
like this before.

295
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,754
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

296
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,380
I believe they're based...

297
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,800
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

298
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,969
They're really gorgeous.

299
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,179
As a matter of fact...

300
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,515
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

301
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,852
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

302
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:12,189
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

303
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,359
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

304
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,612
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

305
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,155
Lots of movie stars.

306
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,907
Royalty?

307
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,700
All the best people.

308
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:19,381
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

309
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,677
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

310
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,805
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.

311
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,057
And here are your quarters.

312
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,060
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

313
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,771
And a small bedroom for your son.

314
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,110
Perfect for a child.

315
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,987
- Yeah.
- Yes.

316
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:51,079
Well, then.
Place is very nicely self-contained.

317
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,831
Easy to keep.

318
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,668
Cozy.

319
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,129
Yes, very cozy for a family.

320
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,048
If you feel like spreading out...

321
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,925
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

322
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,055
Well, it's very...

323
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:09,890
...homey.

324
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,266
Yeah.

325
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,062
This is our famous hedge maze.

326
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,566
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

327
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:22,069
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

328
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,905
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

329
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,116
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

330
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:31,620
When was the Overlook built?

331
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,831
Construction started in 1907.

332
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,000
It was finished in 1909.

333
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,878
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

334
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,713
They actually had to repel...

335
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,841
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

336
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,344
That's our Snowcat.

337
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,346
Can you both drive a car?

338
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:50,514
Yes.

339
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,184
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

340
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,937
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

341
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:01,525
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

342
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,236
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

343
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,030
Oh. He sure did a beautiful job.

344
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,533
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

345
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,702
Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.

346
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,539
Oh, I'll say!

347
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:19,543
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

348
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,921
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

349
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,925
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

350
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:30,220
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

351
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,473
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

352
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,641
We don't drink.

353
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,268
Then you're in luck.

354
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:40,730
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

355
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,066
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

356
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,986
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

357
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,404
Glad to meet you.

358
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,448
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

359
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:54,411
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

360
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,454
It's just wonderful.

361
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,206
Hi, Danny!

362
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,793
I found him outside looking for you.

363
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:05,714
Dan, did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

364
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:07,090
Yeah.

365
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,425
Come on over here.

366
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,135
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Susie.

367
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:14,347
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

368
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,433
...while I continue on with Jack.

369
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,060
It would be a pleasure. Right this way.

370
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,812
Great. See you later, hon.

371
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,397
Bye, darling.

372
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:28,111
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

373
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,822
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

374
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,032
I'm a Wendy.

375
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:35,702
Oh, Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

376
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,537
This is the kitchen, huh?

377
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,331
This is it.

378
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,000
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

379
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,503
Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen.

380
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,089
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

381
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,843
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

382
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,638
Don't let it get you down.

383
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,307
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

384
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,726
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

385
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,145
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

386
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:05,482
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

387
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,362
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

388
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,657
Right here is our walk-in freezer.

389
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:17,869
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

390
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,080
You got 15 rib roasts...

391
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,415
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

392
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,669
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

393
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:29,005
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

394
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:32,175
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

395
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,010
- No.
- You don't?

396
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,762
What's your favorite food, then?

397
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,847
French fries and ketchup.

398
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,558
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

399
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,519
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

400
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:48,275
Mr. Hallorann...

401
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,819
...how'd you know we call him Doc?

402
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:55,031
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

403
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,284
- I did?
- Yeah.

404
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,578
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

405
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,038
But how did you know?

406
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,791
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

407
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,252
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

408
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,671
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

409
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,048
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

410
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,926
Eh, what's up, Doc?

411
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:18,972
Now, this is the storeroom.

412
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,559
In here is where we keep...

413
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,562
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

414
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:28,189
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

415
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,193
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

416
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,572
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

417
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,826
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

418
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,495
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

419
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,915
We got 60 boxes of dried milk....

420
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:56,009
<i>How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?</i>

421
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,430
Sociables, finger rolls...

422
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,140
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

423
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:05,894
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

424
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:09,189
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

425
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:13,693
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

426
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,446
- Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,239
- How're you getting on?
- Fine.

428
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:21,993
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

429
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,120
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

430
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,540
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

431
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,293
- You like ice cream, Doc?
- Yeah.

432
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,461
I thought you did.

433
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:34,714
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

434
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:36,758
- Not at all.
- We don't mind.

435
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,635
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?

436
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,429
- Yeah.
- Okay, you behave yourself.

437
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,309
What kind of ice cream do you like?

438
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,519
Chocolate.

439
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,563
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

440
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,153
It's amazing, all this activity today.

441
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,156
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

442
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:01,783
...last day's always hectic.

443
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:05,036
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

444
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:09,290
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

445
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,543
- Just like a ghost ship, huh?
- Yes.

446
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:20,176
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

447
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,185
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

448
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:39,654
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

449
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,574
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

450
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:46,619
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

451
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,998
She called it "shining."

452
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:54,210
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

453
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,046
...that had "the shine" to us.

454
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:00,675
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

455
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,219
But there are other folks...

456
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:07,140
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

457
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,230
How long have you
been able to do it?

458
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:21,863
Why don't you want to talk about it?

459
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:29,162
I'm not supposed to.

460
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:33,249
Who says you ain't supposed to?

461
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,087
Tony.

462
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,758
Who's Tony?

463
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:47,597
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

464
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,601
Is Tony the one that...

465
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,353
...tells you things?

466
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,481
Yes.

467
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,276
How does he tell you things?

468
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:06,407
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

469
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:10,703
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

470
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,251
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

471
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:18,753
Yes.

472
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:22,131
Do they know he tells you things?

473
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:25,927
Tony told me never to tell them.

474
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:31,432
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

475
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,185
About the Overlook Hotel?

476
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,023
I don't know.

477
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:42,235
Now think real hard, Doc.

478
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,987
Think.

479
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,826
Maybe he showed me something.

480
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:53,371
Try to think of what it was.

481
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:59,669
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

482
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,630
No.

483
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:05,008
Scared of nothing here.

484
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,010
It's just that...

485
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:10,555
...you know, some places
are like people.

486
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:13,099
Some shine...

487
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:14,684
...and some don't.

488
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,062
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

489
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:21,566
...has something about it
that's like shining.

490
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,030
Is there something bad here?

491
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,706
Well...

492
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,044
...you know, Doc,
when something happens...

493
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:44,881
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

494
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,216
Say, like...

495
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:50,511
...if someone burns toast.

496
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,430
Well....

497
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:57,268
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

498
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:01,898
Not things that anyone can notice.

499
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:06,903
But things that people
who shine can see.

500
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:11,282
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

501
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,117
...well...

502
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:17,747
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

503
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,126
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

504
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:26,047
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

505
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:28,966
And not all of them was good.

506
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:34,931
What about room 237?

507
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,436
Room 237?

508
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:44,857
You're scared of room 237, ain't you?

509
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,111
No, I ain't.

510
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:53,449
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

511
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,119
Nothing.

512
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:59,789
There ain't nothing in room 237.

513
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:03,251
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

514
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,586
So stay out.

515
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:08,297
You understand? Stay out!

516
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,565
Good morning, hon.

517
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,319
Your breakfast is ready.

518
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,738
What time is it?

519
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,782
It's about 11:30.

520
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:01,285
Eleven-thirty, Jesus.

521
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:04,664
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

522
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:06,415
I know it.

523
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,586
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

524
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,421
Nice.

525
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,509
It's really pretty outside.

526
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:19,929
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

527
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:24,892
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

528
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,979
Any ideas yet?

529
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,648
Lots of ideas.

530
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,400
No good ones.

531
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:35,319
Something will come.

532
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,782
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

533
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:43,035
Yep. That's all it is.

534
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,456
It's really nice up here, isn't it?

535
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:49,292
I love it.

536
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,377
I really do.

537
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:55,298
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

538
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:59,302
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

539
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,388
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

540
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:04,640
...I thought it was kind of scary.

541
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,643
I fell in love with it right away.

542
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:11,147
When I came up here
for my interview...

543
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,318
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

544
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:18,154
I mean, we all have moments
of déjà vu...

545
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:20,573
...but this was ridiculous.

546
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:23,159
It was almost as though I knew...

547
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:26,829
...what was going to be
around every corner.

548
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,665
Ooh-woo-ooh.

549
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:03,449
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

550
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:06,202
- All right.
- And you're going to lose.

551
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,538
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

552
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:15,711
Look out!

553
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,755
I'm coming in close.

554
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:20,216
Loser has to keep America clean.

555
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:22,343
- Oh, no!
- Keep America clean.

556
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,804
Okay. Danny, you win.

557
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,473
Let's take the rest of this walking.

558
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,684
- Okay.
- Whew.

559
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,394
Give me your hand.

560
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:35,856
Isn't it beautiful?

561
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:37,066
Yeah.

562
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:54,959
Dead end.

563
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:54,060
Woo, we made it.

564
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,854
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

565
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,335
It's so pretty.

566
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,087
Yeah.

567
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:26,634
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

568
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,052
Nope.

569
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,523
<i>Rutherford was serving a life sentence...</i>

570
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,525
<i>...for a 1968 shooting.</i>

571
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:46,570
<i>And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.</i>

572
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:50,157
<i>Twenty-four-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.</i>

573
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:53,077
<i>She disappeared on a hunting trip
with her husband.</i>

574
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,080
<i>They may have to
call off the search...</i>

575
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,833
<i>...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.</i>

576
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:00,876
<i>It's so beautiful
in Denver today...</i>

577
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:03,212
<i>...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.</i>

578
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,673
<i>I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...</i>

579
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:10,010
<i>...yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.</i>

580
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:11,387
<i>And it's moving...</i>

581
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:14,765
<i>...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.</i>

582
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:44,832
Hi, hon.

583
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:49,837
How's it going?

584
00:43:52,381 --> 00:43:53,549
Fine.

585
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:57,219
Get a lot written today?

586
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:01,140
Yes.

587
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,854
Hey, the weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

588
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,403
What do you want me to do about it?

589
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:18,741
Come on, hon.

590
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,076
Don't be so grouchy.

591
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:22,828
I'm not...

592
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:24,413
...being grouchy.

593
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,416
I just want to finish my work.

594
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:33,297
Okay. I understand.

595
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:36,133
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

596
00:44:36,342 --> 00:44:38,802
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

597
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:43,098
Wendy...

598
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:45,934
...let me explain something to you.

599
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:50,689
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

600
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:52,316
You're distracting me...

601
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:55,944
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

602
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:57,613
Understand?

603
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:00,616
Yeah.

604
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:02,242
Fine.

605
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,120
We're going to make a new rule:

606
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:06,789
Whenever I'm in here...

607
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,540
...and you hear me typing...

608
00:45:11,043 --> 00:45:13,962
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

609
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:16,465
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

610
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:18,926
That means don't come in.

611
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:21,387
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

612
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:25,474
Yeah.

613
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:27,142
Fine.

614
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:31,480
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

615
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:36,652
Okay.

616
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:08,809
All right, you!

617
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,020
I know you've got more.

618
00:46:14,148 --> 00:46:15,190
Missed!

619
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:21,780
Don't have!

620
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:23,574
No fair anymore.

621
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:22,299
Oh, no.

622
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,559
I knew it.

623
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:06,301
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

624
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:12,516
<i>KDK 12 to KDK 1.</i>

625
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:15,852
This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.

626
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:19,356
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

627
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,734
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

628
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:24,319
We're just fine.

629
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:26,989
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

630
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:30,242
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

631
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:34,663
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

632
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:38,083
<i>Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.</i>

633
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,751
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

634
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:43,171
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

635
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:47,092
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

636
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:50,470
Yes. It's one of the worst
we've had for years.

637
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:54,224
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

638
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,852
I suppose not. Over.

639
00:48:57,477 --> 00:49:00,772
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

640
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:02,274
And, Mrs. Torrance?

641
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:06,695
<i>It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.</i>

642
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,031
Okay. We'll do that.

643
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:11,283
It was real nice talking to you.

644
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:14,119
Bye. Over and out.

645
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:51,239
Hello, Danny.

646
00:49:56,495 --> 00:49:58,914
Come and play with us.

647
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:06,588
Come and play with us, Danny.

648
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,258
Forever...

649
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:13,804
...and ever...

650
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:16,765
...and ever.

651
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:49,881
Tony...

652
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,926
...I'm scared.

653
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:01,977
<i>Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.</i>

654
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:07,482
<i>It's just like pictures in a book, Danny.</i>

655
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:09,818
<i>It isn't real.</i>

656
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:23,123
<i>Please let me give you some money.</i>

657
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,333
<i>I wouldn't think of it.</i>

658
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:26,835
<i>Well, how can I repay you?</i>

659
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:29,713
<i>It's okay. Really.</i>

660
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:32,466
<i>Well, I'm going to have some coffee.</i>

661
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:34,176
<i>Would you like some?</i>

662
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,012
<i>Sure.</i>

663
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:39,055
<i>Great. Sit down.</i>

664
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:51,610
<i>Ooh, marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.</i>

665
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:55,697
<i>- Coffee will be ready--</i>
- Mom.

666
00:51:57,532 --> 00:51:58,950
Yeah.

667
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:02,788
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

668
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:06,958
Not right now. Daddy's asleep.

669
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:10,086
I won't make any noise.

670
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:13,381
Now come on, Doc.

671
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,300
He only went to bed a few hours ago.

672
00:52:15,509 --> 00:52:17,302
Can't you wait till later?

673
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:20,639
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

674
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:25,143
Well, all right.

675
00:52:25,352 --> 00:52:27,729
But really don't make a sound.

676
00:52:27,938 --> 00:52:29,439
I won't, Mom.

677
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:31,983
Make sure you come right back...

678
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:34,194
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

679
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,823
- Okay?
- Okay, Mom.

680
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,250
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

681
00:53:33,962 --> 00:53:36,172
Come here for a minute first.

682
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:15,003
How's it going, Doc?

683
00:54:16,338 --> 00:54:17,339
Okay.

684
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:21,343
Having a good time?

685
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:24,888
Yes, Dad.

686
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:29,017
Good.

687
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:33,396
I want you to have a good time.

688
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:35,732
I am, Dad.

689
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:43,782
Dad?

690
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:45,659
Yes?

691
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:47,994
Do you feel bad?

692
00:54:50,664 --> 00:54:52,165
No.

693
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:56,211
I'm just a little bit tired.

694
00:54:57,796 --> 00:55:00,382
Then why don't you go to sleep?

695
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:05,512
I can't.

696
00:55:06,972 --> 00:55:09,265
I got too much to do.

697
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,062
Dad?

698
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,315
Yes?

699
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,860
Do you like this hotel?

700
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:25,573
Yes.

701
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:28,243
I do.

702
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:30,578
I love it.

703
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,082
Don't you?

704
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:37,961
I guess so.

705
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:41,798
Good.

706
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,345
I want you to like it here.

707
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:54,728
I wish we could stay here forever...

708
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:56,730
...and ever...

709
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:58,732
...and ever.

710
00:56:01,151 --> 00:56:02,444
Dad?

711
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:05,196
What?

712
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:09,576
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

713
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,541
What do you mean?

714
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:24,257
Did your mother ever say that to you?

715
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,718
That I would hurt you?

716
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:28,845
No, Dad.

717
00:56:31,014 --> 00:56:32,599
You sure?

718
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:34,684
Yes, Dad.

719
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:41,524
I love you, Danny.

720
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:45,320
I love you more than anything else...

721
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:48,114
...in the whole world...

722
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:51,951
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

723
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:53,495
...never.

724
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:56,414
You know that, don't you?

725
00:56:56,581 --> 00:56:58,458
- Hm?
- Yes, Dad.

726
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,502
Good.

727
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,378
Mom?

728
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:02,856
Mom?

729
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:30,175
Mom, are you in there?

730
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:35,657
Jack!

731
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:40,745
Jack? Jack!

732
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:45,667
Jack!

733
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,505
What happened?

734
00:59:50,672 --> 00:59:51,923
Honey...

735
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,175
...what's wrong?

736
00:59:55,051 --> 00:59:57,011
Jack?

737
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:03,768
I had the most...

738
01:00:03,977 --> 01:00:06,562
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

739
01:00:08,523 --> 01:00:11,442
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It's okay, it's okay now.

740
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:14,028
Really.

741
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:19,867
I dreamed that I...

742
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:22,537
...that I killed you and Danny.

743
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,542
But I didn't just kill you.

744
01:00:28,835 --> 01:00:31,587
I cut you up into little pieces.

745
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:35,800
My God.

746
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:39,053
I must be losing my mind.

747
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:43,975
Everything's going to be all right.

748
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,771
Come on. Let's get up off the floor.

749
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:58,906
It's okay. There. Now sit up.

750
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:00,867
It's okay.

751
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:03,411
It's okay.

752
01:01:07,457 --> 01:01:08,666
Danny!

753
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:10,918
Everything's okay!

754
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:14,255
Just go play in your room for a while.

755
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,674
Your dad's just got a headache.

756
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:21,012
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

757
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:25,933
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

758
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,643
I'll be right back.

759
01:01:28,061 --> 01:01:29,395
Danny.

760
01:01:29,562 --> 01:01:31,606
Why don't you mind me?

761
01:01:33,191 --> 01:01:35,943
Oh, Danny.

762
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:40,073
Oh, my God.

763
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:43,659
What happened to your neck?

764
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:47,747
Danny, what happened to your neck?

765
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:49,624
Huh?

766
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:18,653
You did this to him...

767
01:02:19,112 --> 01:02:20,530
...didn't you?!

768
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:24,450
You son of a bitch!

769
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:26,494
You did this to him!

770
01:02:26,702 --> 01:02:28,162
Didn't you?!

771
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:31,165
How could you?!

772
01:02:31,374 --> 01:02:33,126
How could you?!

773
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:42,385
Oh.

774
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:06,093
God! I'd give anything for a drink.

775
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:11,599
I'd give my goddamn soul...

776
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:14,310
...for just a glass of beer.

777
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:30,785
Hi, Lloyd.

778
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,749
A little slow tonight, isn't it?

779
01:04:41,629 --> 01:04:43,881
Yes, it is, Mr. Torrance.

780
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:47,426
What will it be?

781
01:04:49,095 --> 01:04:52,056
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

782
01:04:52,265 --> 01:04:55,601
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

783
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:58,688
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

784
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:02,149
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

785
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,694
So here's what:

786
01:05:04,986 --> 01:05:07,321
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

787
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:10,324
...a little glass and some ice.

788
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:12,535
You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?

789
01:05:12,994 --> 01:05:15,329
You're not too busy, are you?

790
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:18,416
No, sir. I'm not busy at all.

791
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:20,501
Good man.

792
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:21,877
You set them up...

793
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:25,006
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

794
01:05:26,173 --> 01:05:29,093
White man's burden, Lloyd, my man.

795
01:05:29,302 --> 01:05:31,470
White man's burden.

796
01:05:37,518 --> 01:05:38,686
Say, Lloyd...

797
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:41,647
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

798
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:44,400
How's my credit in this joint, anyway?

799
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:47,028
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

800
01:05:47,737 --> 01:05:49,363
That's swell.

801
01:05:49,572 --> 01:05:51,282
I like you, Lloyd.

802
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:53,159
I always liked you.

803
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:55,703
You were always the best of them.

804
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:58,247
Best goddamned bartender...

805
01:05:58,456 --> 01:06:01,375
...from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.

806
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:03,836
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.

807
01:06:04,086 --> 01:06:05,880
Thank you for saying so.

808
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:12,845
Here's to five miserable months
on the wagon...

809
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:17,099
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

810
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:37,787
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?

811
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:41,749
Things could be better.

812
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,003
Things could be
a whole lot better.

813
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:49,215
I hope it's nothing serious.

814
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:50,925
No.

815
01:06:52,218 --> 01:06:54,220
Nothing serious.

816
01:06:55,846 --> 01:06:58,432
Just a little problem with...

817
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:01,769
...the old sperm bank upstairs.

818
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:04,313
Nothing I can't handle, though.

819
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:06,232
Thanks.

820
01:07:06,691 --> 01:07:07,692
Women.

821
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,443
Can't live with them...

822
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:11,445
...can't live without them.

823
01:07:14,657 --> 01:07:16,242
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

824
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,910
Words of...

825
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:19,620
...wisdom.

826
01:07:31,132 --> 01:07:34,385
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

827
01:07:34,593 --> 01:07:36,220
I didn't.

828
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:42,852
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

829
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:46,605
I love the little son of a bitch.

830
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,026
I'd do anything for him.

831
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:54,029
Any fucking thing for him.

832
01:07:58,117 --> 01:08:00,661
But that bitch!

833
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:03,372
As long as I live...

834
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:07,042
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

835
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:19,513
I did hurt him once, okay?

836
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:21,932
It was an accident.

837
01:08:22,224 --> 01:08:24,852
Completely unintentional.

838
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:28,355
It could have happened to anybody.

839
01:08:30,065 --> 01:08:33,527
And it was three goddamn years ago!

840
01:08:33,736 --> 01:08:36,572
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

841
01:08:36,781 --> 01:08:39,241
All I tried to do was pull him up.

842
01:08:42,036 --> 01:08:46,707
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

843
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:48,250
I mean...

844
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:52,338
...a few extra foot-pounds of energy...

845
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:55,382
...per second, per second.

846
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:00,930
Jack!

847
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,315
Oh, Jack.

848
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:13,400
Thank God you're here.

849
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:16,445
Jack.

850
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:18,823
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

851
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:21,575
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

852
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:24,328
She tried to strangle Danny.

853
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:29,250
Are you out of your fucking mind?

854
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:31,043
No.

855
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,753
It's the truth! Really.

856
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,422
I swear it. Danny told me.

857
01:09:35,756 --> 01:09:37,633
He went up into one of the bedrooms.

858
01:09:37,842 --> 01:09:41,303
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

859
01:09:41,512 --> 01:09:43,848
She tried to strangle him!

860
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,311
Which room was it?

861
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:59,113
<i>From Channel 10 in Miami...</i>

862

<i>In Colorado, 10 inches of snow

869

<i>Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.</i>

871
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,768
<i>Highways are blocked

875
01:10:37,943 --> 01:10:40,237
<i>The governor of Colorado is expected...</i>

876
01:10:40,446 --> 01:10:42,156
<i>...to declare a weather emergency.</i>

877
01:10:42,364 --> 01:10:44,199
<i>The National Guard

878

889
01:17:02,077 --> 01:17:03,412
Jack?

890
01:17:03,745 --> 01:17:05,580
Yes, it's me.

891
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:07,207
Thank God.

892
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:13,672
Did you find anything?

893
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,591
No. Nothing at all.

894
01:17:17,217 --> 01:17:20,387
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

895
01:17:23,098 --> 01:17:26,601
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

896
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,395
Yes, I did.

897
01:17:28,854 --> 01:17:30,647
And you didn't see anything at all?

898
01:17:30,856 --> 01:17:32,858
Absolutely nothing.

899
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,318
How is he?

900
01:17:34,526 --> 01:17:36,320
He's still asleep.

901
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:37,863
Good.

902
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:46,747
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

903
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:53,754
Are you sure it was the right room?

904
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,090
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

905
01:17:57,299 --> 01:17:59,676
He must have gone in that room.

906
01:17:59,885 --> 01:18:02,554
The door was open,
the lights were on.

907
01:18:05,182 --> 01:18:07,517
I just don't understand it.

908
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:14,900
What about those bruises on his neck?

909
01:18:17,069 --> 01:18:19,404
Somebody did that to him.

910
01:18:27,662 --> 01:18:29,122
I think...

911
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:33,335
...he did it to himself.

912
01:18:39,341 --> 01:18:40,592
No.

913
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:43,303
That's not possible.

914
01:18:45,806 --> 01:18:47,349
Wendy...

915
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,270
...once you rule out his version
of what happened...

916
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:55,107
...there is no other explanation.

917
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:56,900
Is there?

918
01:18:59,277 --> 01:19:02,155
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode...

919
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:05,742
...that he had before
we came up here.

920
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:07,160
Would it?

921
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:14,418
<i>Oh, Jack.</i>

922
01:19:15,085 --> 01:19:18,088
<i>Whatever the explanation is...</i>

923
01:19:21,508 --> 01:19:22,926
<i>...I think we...</i>

924
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:25,846
<i>...have to get Danny out of here.</i>

925
01:19:30,642 --> 01:19:32,477
Get him out of here?

926
01:19:34,062 --> 01:19:35,355
Yes.

927
01:19:36,648 --> 01:19:38,358
You mean...

928
01:19:39,401 --> 01:19:41,361
...just leave the hotel?

929
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,780
Yes.

930
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:51,788
<i>It is so...</i>

931
01:19:51,955 --> 01:19:54,374
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

932
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:57,127
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

933
01:19:57,335 --> 01:19:59,880
When I'm really into my work!

934
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:04,050
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?

935
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:08,013
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.

936
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:10,307
- Any of that appeal to you?
- Jack...

937
01:20:10,474 --> 01:20:14,227
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

938
01:20:14,394 --> 01:20:18,064
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

939
01:21:35,976 --> 01:21:37,894
<i>Good evening. Forest Service.</i>

940
01:21:37,978 --> 01:21:40,272
Hello, my name is Dick Hallorann.

941
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,899
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

942
01:21:43,108 --> 01:21:45,235
<i>Good evening.
What can I do for you?</i>

943
01:21:45,443 --> 01:21:48,989
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

944
01:21:49,197 --> 01:21:52,492
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

945
01:21:52,701 --> 01:21:56,329
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

946
01:21:56,496 --> 01:21:59,165
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

947
01:21:59,374 --> 01:22:02,627
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

948
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:04,504
And with this storm
and everything...

949
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:07,591
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

950
01:22:07,799 --> 01:22:09,801
...just to see if everything's okay.

951
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:11,595
I'll be glad to do that.

952
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:14,598
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

953
01:22:14,806 --> 01:22:16,850
<i>Thank you very much.
I'll do that.</i>

954
01:22:17,017 --> 01:22:18,476
All right, sir.

955
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:40,749
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

956
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:42,417
Good evening.

957
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:08,443
Hi, Lloyd.

958
01:23:08,652 --> 01:23:10,528
Been away, but now I'm back.

959
01:23:10,779 --> 01:23:12,530
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

960
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:14,199
It's good to see you.

961
01:23:14,407 --> 01:23:17,077
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

962
01:23:17,702 --> 01:23:19,412
What'll it be, sir?

963
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:22,499
Hair of the dog that bit me.

964
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:25,585
Bourbon on the rocks.

965
01:23:26,419 --> 01:23:27,796
That'll do her.

966
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:43,603
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

967
01:23:45,021 --> 01:23:46,981
No charge?

968
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:49,609
Your money's no good here.

969
01:23:55,281 --> 01:23:56,991
Orders from the house.

970
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:02,706
Orders from the house.

971
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:07,961
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

972
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:14,676
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

973
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:19,931
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

974
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:22,058
At least, not at this point.

975
01:24:26,855 --> 01:24:29,274
Anything you say, Lloyd.

976
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:31,693
Anything you say.

977
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:44,497
Oh!

978
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:47,167
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

979
01:24:47,417 --> 01:24:49,711
- Oh.
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

980
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:52,297
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

981
01:24:52,464 --> 01:24:57,343
Oh, that's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

982
01:24:57,552 --> 01:25:00,346
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

983
01:25:00,555 --> 01:25:01,681
Advocaat, is it?

984
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:04,058
Yes, sir. I think the best thing...

985
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:06,478
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

986
01:25:06,686 --> 01:25:09,189
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

987
01:25:10,023 --> 01:25:13,359
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...

988
01:25:13,526 --> 01:25:14,527
...Jeevesy old boy.

989
01:25:14,736 --> 01:25:17,906
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

990
01:25:18,198 --> 01:25:20,617
Awfully nice of you to say.

991
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:23,912
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

992
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,372
...before the fish and goose soiree.

993
01:25:26,581 --> 01:25:28,625
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

994
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:30,084
Here. I'll just...

995
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:33,379
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

996
01:25:33,588 --> 01:25:35,381
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

997
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:40,053
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

998
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:41,554
All right. I'll just...

999
01:25:41,721 --> 01:25:45,934
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

1000
01:25:46,518 --> 01:25:47,936
Won't keep you a moment.

1001
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:49,562
Fine.

1002
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:54,275
What do they call you, Jeevesy?

1003
01:25:54,484 --> 01:25:57,070
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

1004
01:26:01,825 --> 01:26:02,826
Grady?

1005
01:26:02,992 --> 01:26:04,202
Yes, sir.

1006
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:06,704
Delbert Grady.

1007
01:26:06,913 --> 01:26:08,414
That's right, sir.

1008
01:26:14,379 --> 01:26:16,381
Uh....

1009
01:26:17,131 --> 01:26:18,591
Mr. Grady...

1010
01:26:19,342 --> 01:26:21,427
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

1011
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:24,347
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

1012
01:26:31,396 --> 01:26:33,231
It's coming off now, sir.

1013
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:35,650
Uh...

1014
01:26:38,152 --> 01:26:39,737
...Mr. Grady...

1015
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:43,700
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

1016
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:46,703
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

1017
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:53,084
You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?

1018
01:26:53,293 --> 01:26:54,335
Yes, sir.

1019
01:26:54,502 --> 01:26:57,589
I have a wife and two daughters, sir.

1020
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:00,133
And...

1021
01:27:01,801 --> 01:27:03,094
...where are they now?

1022
01:27:03,303 --> 01:27:07,348
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

1023
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:16,941
Mr. Grady.

1024
01:27:18,026 --> 01:27:20,445
You were the caretaker here.

1025
01:27:21,905 --> 01:27:23,907
I recognize you.

1026
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:28,328
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

1027
01:27:28,786 --> 01:27:30,538
You...

1028
01:27:30,997 --> 01:27:34,542
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

1029
01:27:35,043 --> 01:27:36,461
And...

1030
01:27:37,086 --> 01:27:39,005
...then you blew your brains out.

1031
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:50,683
That's strange, sir.

1032
01:27:51,684 --> 01:27:54,437
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

1033
01:27:58,107 --> 01:27:59,984
Mr. Grady...

1034
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:03,738
...you were the caretaker here.

1035
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:14,332
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

1036
01:28:16,209 --> 01:28:17,919
But you...

1037
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:20,505
...are the caretaker.

1038
01:28:22,757 --> 01:28:25,677
You've always been the caretaker.

1039
01:28:28,554 --> 01:28:30,390
I should know, sir.

1040
01:28:31,849 --> 01:28:34,435
I've always been here.

1041
01:28:52,662 --> 01:28:54,872
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

1042
01:28:55,081 --> 01:28:56,874
...that your son...

1043
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:59,961
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

1044
01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:02,380
...into this situation?

1045
01:29:04,924 --> 01:29:06,634
Did you know that?

1046
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:11,431
No.

1047
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,976
He is, Mr. Torrance.

1048
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:18,479
Who?

1049
01:29:20,732 --> 01:29:22,358
A nigger.

1050
01:29:26,446 --> 01:29:27,822
A nigger?

1051
01:29:30,575 --> 01:29:31,993
A nigger...

1052
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:33,286
...cook.

1053
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:41,085
How?

1054
01:29:43,337 --> 01:29:45,131
Your son...

1055
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:48,342
...has a very great talent.

1056
01:29:49,302 --> 01:29:52,805
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

1057
01:29:53,556 --> 01:29:56,809
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

1058
01:29:56,976 --> 01:29:58,978
...against your will.

1059
01:30:07,487 --> 01:30:08,780
Well...

1060
01:30:11,532 --> 01:30:14,619
...he is a very willful boy.

1061
01:30:16,996 --> 01:30:19,415
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

1062
01:30:19,624 --> 01:30:22,502
A very willful boy.

1063
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:24,045
A rather...

1064
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:25,797
...naughty boy...

1065
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:29,175
...if I may be so bold, sir.

1066
01:30:36,432 --> 01:30:38,184
It's his mother.

1067
01:30:40,353 --> 01:30:41,813
She...

1068
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:44,023
...interferes.

1069
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:50,196
Perhaps they need a good...

1070
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:52,031
...talking-to.

1071
01:30:52,448 --> 01:30:53,491
If...

1072
01:30:53,658 --> 01:30:56,244
...you don't mind my saying so.

1073
01:30:57,036 --> 01:30:58,704
Perhaps...

1074
01:30:59,205 --> 01:31:00,915
...a bit more.

1075
01:31:04,127 --> 01:31:05,378
My girls, sir...

1076
01:31:05,545 --> 01:31:09,382
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

1077
01:31:10,049 --> 01:31:13,928
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

1078
01:31:14,137 --> 01:31:16,806
...and tried to burn it down.

1079
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:19,559
But I...

1080
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:21,727
...corrected them, sir.

1081
01:31:23,062 --> 01:31:27,191
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

1082
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:28,651
...I...

1083
01:31:29,652 --> 01:31:31,737
...corrected her.

1084
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,920
We have the Snowcat.

1085
01:31:51,299 --> 01:31:53,092
If the weather breaks...

1086
01:31:53,259 --> 01:31:55,052
...we might just be able...

1087
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:57,096
...to get down the mountain.

1088
01:31:59,974 --> 01:32:02,935
I could call
the forest rangers first...

1089
01:32:03,144 --> 01:32:04,437
...and...

1090
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:06,647
...tell them that we're coming...

1091
01:32:07,023 --> 01:32:08,191
...so that...

1092
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:12,486
...they could start searching
for us in case we didn't make it.

1093
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:18,451
And if Jack won't come with us...

1094
01:32:20,912 --> 01:32:24,624
...I'll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.

1095
01:32:24,832 --> 01:32:26,792
That's all there is to it.

1096
01:32:28,169 --> 01:32:29,670

01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:32,298

Danny?

1105
01:32:54,028 --> 01:32:55,279
Hon?

<i>Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.</i>

1107
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:11,504
Come on, hon.

1108
01:33:12,505 --> 01:33:13,923
Wake up.

1109
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,134
You just had a bad dream.

1110
01:33:18,511 --> 01:33:20,680

<i>Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.</i>

1112
01:33:35,611 --> 01:33:36,612
Danny.

1113
01:33:38,072 --> 01:33:39,865
Wake up!

1114
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:42,368
Come on.

1115
01:33:42,576 --> 01:33:44,120
Right now.

1116
01:33:44,578 --> 01:33:45,955
Wake up!

1117
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:54,046
<i>Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.</i>

1118

01:34:45,097 --> 01:34:46,849
<i>Do you read me?</i>

1131
01:34:51,145 --> 01:34:54,106
<i>This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12.</i>

1132
01:34:54,273 --> 01:34:57,777
<i>KDK 1 calling KDK 12.
Are you receiv--</i>

1133
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:14,335
<i>Good evening. Forest service.</i>

1134
01:35:14,543 --> 01:35:16,796
This is Dick Hallorann again.

1135
01:35:16,962 --> 01:35:20,091
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

1136
01:35:20,257 --> 01:35:21,258
Oh, yeah.

1137
01:35:21,425 --> 01:35:25,137
We tried to contact them several
times but they didn't answer.

1138
01:35:25,304 --> 01:35:28,933
Maybe they got their radio
turned off or they can't hear it.

1139
01:35:29,141 --> 01:35:32,019
If you'd like, I'd be glad
to try again later on.

1140
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,647
That's very nice of you.

1141
01:35:34,855 --> 01:35:36,649
I'll call you back later.

1142
01:35:36,816 --> 01:35:37,858
Bye.

1143
01:36:24,947 --> 01:36:27,992
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?

1144
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,369
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

1145
01:36:30,536 --> 01:36:32,163
Thank you very much.

1146
01:37:35,976 --> 01:37:36,977
Durkin's Garage.

1147
01:37:37,186 --> 01:37:38,312
<i>Can I speak to Larry?</i>

1148
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:39,480
Speaking.

1149
01:37:39,772 --> 01:37:42,274
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.

1150
01:37:42,566 --> 01:37:44,235
Dick! How you doing?

1151
01:37:44,443 --> 01:37:45,778
How's the weather down there?

1152
01:37:45,986 --> 01:37:49,156
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

1153
01:37:49,532 --> 01:37:51,116
What are you doing there?

1154
01:37:51,575 --> 01:37:54,995
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.

1155
01:37:55,204 --> 01:37:56,830
What's the weather like there?

1156
01:37:57,456 --> 01:38:00,334
The snowplows are keeping things
moving in town...

1157
01:38:00,543 --> 01:38:02,461
...but the mountain roads
are blocked.

1158
01:38:03,003 --> 01:38:05,714
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat
to get up there.

1159
01:38:05,923 --> 01:38:07,758
Can you fix me up with one?

1160
01:38:07,967 --> 01:38:10,052
What's the big deal
about getting there today...

1161
01:38:10,261 --> 01:38:11,804
...especially in this weather?

1162
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:16,141
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem...

1163
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:18,602
...with the people taking care
of the place.

1164
01:38:18,811 --> 01:38:22,648
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.

1165
01:38:22,856 --> 01:38:24,650
Ullman phoned me last night.

1166
01:38:24,858 --> 01:38:28,237
And I'm supposed to find out
if they have to be replaced.

1167
01:38:29,697 --> 01:38:31,740
How long will it take you
to get here?

1168
01:38:32,074 --> 01:38:33,742
About five hours.

1169
01:38:33,951 --> 01:38:36,161
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.

1170
01:38:36,662 --> 01:38:38,414
Okay, I'll take care of it.

1171
01:38:38,622 --> 01:38:41,458
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.

1172
01:38:41,667 --> 01:38:44,211
That's all right. Drive carefully.

1173
01:38:49,967 --> 01:38:53,220
<i>You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.</i>

1174
01:38:53,429 --> 01:38:56,015
<i>And we have a bad day out there.</i>

1175
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:59,560
<i>Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.</i>

1176
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:01,270
<i>Many mountain passes...</i>

1177
01:39:01,478 --> 01:39:04,356
<i>... Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...</i>

1178
01:39:04,523 --> 01:39:07,860
<i>...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.</i>

1179
01:39:08,027 --> 01:39:09,695
<i>We hear from the news department...</i>

1180
01:39:09,903 --> 01:39:13,115
<i>...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...</i>

1181
01:39:13,324 --> 01:39:14,908
<i>...and with storms like this...</i>

1182
01:39:15,117 --> 01:39:18,495
<i>...I guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.</i>

1183
01:39:18,662 --> 01:39:22,291
<i>The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...</i>

1184
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:24,960
<i>...has declared a stockman's

<i>Get the cows in the barn.</i>

1187
01:39:51,028 --> 01:39:52,071
Hon?

1188
01:39:57,076 --> 01:39:59,495
Listen to me for a minute, will you?

1189
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:07,002
I'm just going to go and
talk to Daddy for a few minutes...

1190
01:40:07,211 --> 01:40:09,254
...and I'll be right back.

1191
01:40:10,214 --> 01:40:12,758
I want you to just stay here...

1192
01:40:12,925 --> 01:40:15,427
...and watch your cartoons, okay?

1193
01:40:18,555 --> 01:40:20,015
Okay, hon?

1194
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:26,188
<i>Yes, Mrs. Torrance.</i>

1195
01:40:34,947 --> 01:40:36,156
All right.

1196
01:40:37,032 --> 01:40:41,120
I'll-- I'll be back
in just about five minutes.

1197
01:40:41,954 --> 01:40:44,289
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.

1198
01:41:33,213 --> 01:41:34,798
Jack?

1199
01:41:55,611 --> 01:41:57,070
Jack?

1200
01:44:10,621 --> 01:44:11,663
How do you like it?

1201
01:44:14,374 --> 01:44:15,834
Jack.

1202
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:20,464
How do you like it?

1203
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:33,060
What are you doing down here?

1204
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:39,775
I just...

1205
01:44:40,233 --> 01:44:41,276
...wanted...

1206
01:44:41,693 --> 01:44:43,445
...to talk to you.

1207
01:44:45,822 --> 01:44:47,074
Okay.

1208
01:44:47,699 --> 01:44:49,159
Let's talk.

1209
01:44:58,961 --> 01:45:00,963
What do you want to talk about?

1210
01:45:06,969 --> 01:45:08,220
I....

1211
01:45:08,887 --> 01:45:12,057
I can't really remember.

1212
01:45:12,849 --> 01:45:14,977
You can't remember.

1213
01:45:15,769 --> 01:45:17,104
No...

1214
01:45:17,479 --> 01:45:18,897
...I can't.

1215
01:45:24,194 --> 01:45:27,447
<i>Maybe it was about Danny?</i>

1216
01:45:29,825 --> 01:45:32,536
<i>Maybe it was about him.</i>

1217
01:45:36,164 --> 01:45:39,459
<i>I think we should discuss Danny.</i>

1218
01:45:42,254 --> 01:45:44,089
<i>I think...</i>

1219
01:45:44,464 --> 01:45:48,260
<i>...we should discuss
what should be done with him.</i>

1220
01:45:52,931 --> 01:45:55,559
What should be done with him?

1221
01:46:00,522 --> 01:46:02,315
I don't know.

1222
01:46:02,816 --> 01:46:04,818
I don't think that's true.

1223
01:46:05,027 --> 01:46:07,612
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

1224
01:46:07,821 --> 01:46:09,531
...about what should be done
with Danny.

1225
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:12,325
And I'd like to know
what they are.

1226
01:46:14,244 --> 01:46:16,038
Well, I...

1227
01:46:16,329 --> 01:46:20,751
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

1228
01:46:20,959 --> 01:46:24,254
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1229
01:46:24,463 --> 01:46:25,839
Yes.

1230
01:46:26,465 --> 01:46:29,801
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1231
01:46:30,469 --> 01:46:31,803
As soon as possible?

1232
01:46:32,429 --> 01:46:34,765
"As soon as possible?"

1233
01:46:37,434 --> 01:46:38,852
Please.

1234
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:43,523
You believe his health
might be at stake.

1235
01:46:45,108 --> 01:46:46,651
Yes.

1236
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:50,614
And you are concerned about him.

1237
01:46:50,822 --> 01:46:52,365
Yes.

1238
01:46:53,158 --> 01:46:55,410
And are you concerned about me?

1239
01:46:56,244 --> 01:46:57,412
Of course I am.

1240
01:46:57,621 --> 01:46:59,831
Of course you are!

1241
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:03,168
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

1242
01:47:03,376 --> 01:47:04,878
What are you talking about?

1243
01:47:05,087 --> 01:47:07,923
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

1244
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:10,175
...thought about
my responsibilities?

1245
01:47:10,383 --> 01:47:12,677
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

1246
01:47:12,844 --> 01:47:15,680
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

1247
01:47:15,931 --> 01:47:17,766
Has it ever occurred to you...

1248
01:47:17,974 --> 01:47:21,478
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1st?

1249
01:47:21,686 --> 01:47:23,730
Does it matter to you at all...

1250
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:27,025
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

1251
01:47:27,234 --> 01:47:30,362
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

1252
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:33,198
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

1253
01:47:33,657 --> 01:47:35,700
Do you have the slightest idea...

1254
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:39,121
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

1255
01:47:39,496 --> 01:47:42,582
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

1256
01:47:42,791 --> 01:47:45,210
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

1257
01:47:45,377 --> 01:47:47,712
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

1258
01:47:47,879 --> 01:47:49,422
Stay away from me!

1259
01:47:50,298 --> 01:47:51,383
Why?

1260
01:47:51,675 --> 01:47:54,636
I just want to go back to my room.

1261
01:47:54,845 --> 01:47:56,096
Why?

1262
01:47:56,596 --> 01:47:57,597
Well...

1263
01:47:58,723 --> 01:48:00,767
...I'm very confused.

1264
01:48:01,893 --> 01:48:05,564
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

1265
01:48:06,606 --> 01:48:10,569
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

1266
01:48:10,735 --> 01:48:13,530
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

1267
01:48:14,489 --> 01:48:15,991
Stay away from me!

1268
01:48:16,324 --> 01:48:17,617
Please!

1269
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:19,452
Don't hurt me.

1270
01:48:19,661 --> 01:48:20,996
I'm not going to hurt you.

1271
01:48:21,204 --> 01:48:22,205
Stay away from me!

1272
01:48:22,372 --> 01:48:23,456
- Wendy.
- Stay away!

1273
01:48:23,665 --> 01:48:24,666
Darling.

1274
01:48:24,875 --> 01:48:26,418
Light of my life.

1275
01:48:26,877 --> 01:48:28,211
I'm not going to hurt you.

1276
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:30,422
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

1277
01:48:30,589 --> 01:48:32,799
I said, "I'm not going to hurt you."

1278
01:48:33,008 --> 01:48:35,760
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

1279
01:48:36,052 --> 01:48:39,014
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

1280
01:48:40,098 --> 01:48:41,641
Stay away from me!

1281
01:48:42,142 --> 01:48:43,185
Don't hurt me!

1282
01:48:43,393 --> 01:48:45,770
I'm not going to hurt you.

1283
01:48:46,062 --> 01:48:47,606
Stay away from me!

1284
01:48:47,814 --> 01:48:48,899
Stay away!

1285
01:48:49,774 --> 01:48:50,984
Please!

1286
01:48:52,027 --> 01:48:53,778
Stop swinging the bat.

1287
01:48:53,987 --> 01:48:55,280
Stay away from me.

1288
01:48:56,031 --> 01:48:57,324
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1289
01:48:57,532 --> 01:48:59,034
Stop it!

1290
01:48:59,201 --> 01:49:00,327
Wendy.

1291
01:49:00,493 --> 01:49:01,620
Give me the bat.

1292
01:49:01,828 --> 01:49:02,954
Please!

1293
01:49:03,205 --> 01:49:05,415
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

1294
01:49:05,624 --> 01:49:06,666
Stop it!

1295
01:49:06,917 --> 01:49:08,335
- Give me the bat.
- Jack.

1296
01:49:08,668 --> 01:49:10,462
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.

1297
01:49:10,545 --> 01:49:11,880
Please stop!

1298
01:49:12,088 --> 01:49:13,298
Give me the bat.

1299
01:49:13,465 --> 01:49:14,716
- Stay away from me.
- Wendy.

1300
01:49:14,966 --> 01:49:16,468
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.

1301
01:49:16,635 --> 01:49:18,053
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

1302
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:19,804
Ah! Goddamn--!

1303
01:50:35,046 --> 01:50:36,756
What are you doing?

1304
01:50:37,549 --> 01:50:38,550
Hey.

1305
01:50:39,551 --> 01:50:41,052
Wait a minute.

1306
01:50:42,429 --> 01:50:44,431
What are you doing?

1307
01:50:47,267 --> 01:50:48,518
What are you doing?

1308
01:50:54,232 --> 01:50:55,483
Oh! Oh!

1309
01:51:02,407 --> 01:51:03,908
Wait a minute!

1310
01:51:06,244 --> 01:51:07,871
What are you doing?

1311
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:09,831
Open the door!

1312
01:51:11,124 --> 01:51:12,167
Goddamn it!

1313
01:51:12,375 --> 01:51:15,920
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

1314
01:51:19,632 --> 01:51:20,884
Wendy, listen.

1315
01:51:21,301 --> 01:51:24,262
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

1316
01:51:24,429 --> 01:51:26,931
It'll be just like nothing ever happened.

1317
01:51:40,236 --> 01:51:42,947
Wendy, baby.

1318
01:51:44,157 --> 01:51:47,452
I think you hurt my head real bad.

1319
01:51:49,079 --> 01:51:50,747
I'm dizzy.

1320
01:51:51,748 --> 01:51:53,958
I need a doctor.

1321
01:52:00,799 --> 01:52:02,008
Honey.

1322
01:52:04,677 --> 01:52:07,013
Don't leave me in here.

1323
01:52:15,647 --> 01:52:17,524
I'm going to go now.

1324
01:52:20,610 --> 01:52:22,445
I'm going to try...

1325
01:52:22,654 --> 01:52:25,657
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

1326
01:52:26,324 --> 01:52:28,701
...in the Snowcat today.

1327
01:52:30,954 --> 01:52:32,789
I'll bring back a doctor.

1328
01:52:34,582 --> 01:52:36,000
Wendy.

1329
01:52:38,169 --> 01:52:40,004
I'm going to go now.

1330
01:52:41,005 --> 01:52:42,757
Wendy.

1331
01:52:44,926 --> 01:52:46,678
Yes.

1332
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:51,266
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

1333
01:52:52,725 --> 01:52:55,353
You're not going anywhere.

1334
01:52:57,021 --> 01:53:01,151
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

1335
01:53:05,738 --> 01:53:07,449
Go check it out.

1336
01:53:09,576 --> 01:53:11,786
Go check it out!

1337
01:53:15,165 --> 01:53:17,083
Go check it out.

1338
01:55:02,063 --> 01:55:03,648
Wendy?

1339
01:55:05,108 --> 01:55:07,485
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

1340
01:55:08,236 --> 01:55:10,196
Delbert Grady.

1341
01:55:11,781 --> 01:55:13,366
Grady?

1342
01:55:18,162 --> 01:55:20,164
Oh, Grady.

1343
01:55:24,419 --> 01:55:26,588
Grady, uh....

1344
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:35,555
Hello, Grady.

1345
01:55:40,226 --> 01:55:42,020
Mr. Torrance...

1346
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:47,692
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

1347
01:55:48,443 --> 01:55:50,945
...business we discussed.

1348
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:00,580
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1349
01:56:01,456 --> 01:56:05,543
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

1350
01:56:06,377 --> 01:56:09,130
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

1351
01:56:09,631 --> 01:56:11,466
I wonder.

1352
01:56:12,634 --> 01:56:14,719
I have my doubts.

1353
01:56:15,928 --> 01:56:20,183
I, and others, have come to believe...

1354
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:23,394
...that your heart is not in this.

1355
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:26,564
That you haven't the belly for it.

1356
01:56:32,737 --> 01:56:37,033
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

1357
01:56:37,867 --> 01:56:39,786
That's all I ask.

1358
01:56:41,329 --> 01:56:45,583
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

1359
01:56:45,792 --> 01:56:47,251
Somewhat more...

1360
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:49,420
...resourceful.

1361
01:56:49,712 --> 01:56:52,465
She seems to have got
the better of you.

1362
01:56:55,718 --> 01:56:58,388
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

1363
01:56:59,097 --> 01:57:01,265
Only for the moment.

1364
01:57:03,184 --> 01:57:07,355
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

1365
01:57:07,605 --> 01:57:11,275
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

1366
01:57:11,859 --> 01:57:13,444
I fear...

1367
01:57:13,695 --> 01:57:16,280
...that is the only thing to do.

1368
01:57:19,742 --> 01:57:21,828
There's nothing I look forward to...

1369
01:57:22,036 --> 01:57:25,957
...with greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.

1370
01:57:27,333 --> 01:57:30,086
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

1371
01:57:31,546 --> 01:57:33,589
I give you my word.

Run!

1415
02:03:09,967 --> 02:03:11,385
Run and hide!

Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in.

Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

1420
02:03:31,405 --> 02:03:33,491
Then I'll huff...

02:03:33,657 --> 02:03:35,576
...and I'll puff...

1422

I'm coming!

02:13:20,243 --> 02:13:22,579
You can't get away!

1456
02:13:26,416 --> 02:13:28,919
I'm right behind you!

1457
02:14:23,181 --> 02:14:25,475
Danny!

1458
02:15:44,387 --> 02:15:47,390
Danny!

1459
02:17:24,988 --> 02:17:26,323
Danny!

1460
02:17:27,282 --> 02:17:29,326
- Mommy!
- Danny, come here!

1461
02:17:30,493 --> 02:17:32,245
Mommy.

1462
02:17:37,834 --> 02:17:39,544
Danny!

1463
02:17:40,587 --> 02:17:42,005
Where...?
