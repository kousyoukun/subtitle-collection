1
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,231
I am Death,  Denny Colt.

2
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:28,374
You are the only man who has
ever escaped my cold embrace.

3
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:31,743
But I am never far away.

4
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,342
Yes.

5
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,178
I'm always with you.

6
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:20,089
- Yeah.
- Something big is breaking down...

7
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:21,659
...by the mudflats,  Spirit.

8
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:23,489
By the wreck of an old cargo ship.

9
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:26,197
Word on the street
is The Octopus might be in on it.

10
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,389
I'd call it in...

11
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:31,203
...but who knows
how far his tentacles spread?

12
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:32,838
Who we can trust?

13
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,303
l'm on my way.

14
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:51,513
My city. She's always there for me.

15
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:57,422
Every lonely night,  she's there for me.

16
00:03:57,758 --> 00:04:02,195
She's not some tarted- up fraud
all dressed up like a piece of jailbait.

17
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:04,423
No. She's an old city...

18
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:08,362
...old and proud of her every pock
and crack and wrinkle.

19
00:04:08,902 --> 00:04:12,497
She's my sweetheart,  my plaything.

20
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:16,742
She doesn't hide what she is,
what she's made of:

21
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:20,675
Sweat,  muscle
and blood of generations.

22
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:30,114
She sleeps.

23
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:33,782
After midnight and until dawn,
only shadows move in the silence.

24
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:35,791
There she is!

25
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:38,063
- Get her.
- Damn,  I've got no time for this.

26
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:41,830
My city screams. She needs me.

27
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:48,504
She is my love. She is my life.

28
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,609
And I am her Spirit.

29
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,661
Don't worry,  you're safe now.
Try to catch your breath.

30
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:22,341
- Here,  let's get you to your feet.
- Police!

31
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,839
Over here,  MacReady.

32
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:26,706
This is a good man,  you can trust him.
Tell him everything.

33
00:05:26,913 --> 00:05:29,347
- l will.
- Call your shrink if you got one.

34
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,625
What are you?

35
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,247
That's The Spirit.

36
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,109
God bless him.

37
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:10,746
She provides for me,  my city does.

38
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:16,761
She gives me everything I need.

39
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:23,193
Move it over,  Liebowitz. l'm driving.

40
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:18,518
Sussman called.

41
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,750
Something's going down here.
Could be big.

42
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,929
- How big?
- Octopus big.

43
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,428
- Jesus! We better call for backup.
- Not just yet.

44
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:28,362
Sussman wants this one
kept under the radar for now.

45
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:31,469
Yes. Come closer. Come home to me.

46
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,571
You hear that,  boss?

47
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:35,341
Every goddamn night.

48
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:40,778
Lorelei. The angel of death.
She's never far away. Not from me.

49
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:43,882
They say only sailors and cops
can hear her.

50
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:46,844
Well,  l'm not a sailor.

51
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:50,318
And l'm not a cop.

52
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,726
- Officer down.
- Roger that,  I copy.

53
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,367
Get an ambulance. Call Dolan.

54
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,469
- Commissioner- -
- Not Commissioner Dolan.

55
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:06,104
- Dr. Dolan.
- Still breathing.

56
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:09,139
- Spirit says he's still breathing.
- Keep me advised.

57
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:10,775
Hurts like a son of a bitch.

58
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:12,601
Take it easy. We'll get you home.

59
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:15,841
That broad.

60
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:18,745
- You should have seen her.
- Broad?

61
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:20,783
A beautiful broad.

62
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,249
She was beautiful.

63
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:24,754
Keep him talking. Keep him awake.

64
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,222
You look for more footprints,
Liebowitz.

65
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:30,453
Yeah. She was beautiful.

66
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,029
lf this is the wrong box,
l'll kill you myself.

67
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:19,535
Just get us out of here.
lt's The Octopus.

68
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:21,434
You know what he can do.

69
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:24,041
Shut up and bleed.

70
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:34,043
You look for more footprints,
Liebowitz.

71
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,350
She was beautiful.

72
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:41,322
And she wasn't looking
for a fight,  either.

73
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:43,851
Easy,  now.

74
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,032
Just breathe through your nose
if you can.

75
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:49,795
Getting dizzy.

76
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:52,699
Steady. Steady.

77
00:10:57,077 --> 00:10:58,135
Heads up!

78
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:07,244
Take it home,  boys.

79
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:11,857
When me and The Spirit get together,
we like to party all night.

80
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:31,771
There is nothing l like better
than kicking your ass all night long.

81
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:35,305
Except maybe eggs.

82
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:40,141
Where's the truck?

83
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:42,014
Silken Floss is the most
beautiful woman.

84
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:44,019
How do we find our way home
without her?

85
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:46,283
Silken Floss is the most beautiful
woman ever.

86
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:47,755
She was supposed to be here.

87
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:49,758
How do we find our way home
without her?

88
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:51,590
Where's the truck?

89
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:53,231
l found the truck!

90
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:57,062
Silken Floss
is the most beautiful woman ever.

91
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,838
Load up the box and pile in,
specimens.

92
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:06,638
You've done your
petri dishes proud.

93
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:12,342
No need to wait for the boss
if that's The Spirit back there.

94
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:16,686
The Octopus always finds his nemesis
so distracting.

95
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,723
lt is The Spirit. He had his hat on.
We was watching.

96
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:22,127
Well,  then,  they'll be at it all night.

97
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:25,388
- Yeah,  boss said so.
- Boss said so. We was watching.

98
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:29,034
Oh,  God. Yeah. l heard.

99
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:34,731
Silken Floss is the most beautiful- -

100
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:59,662
You're giving me a headache,
Octopus.

101
00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:04,426
lt's gonna get worse
before it gets better,  pretty boy.

102
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:06,104
You're right about that.

103
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:29,318
Come on!

104
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:31,624
Toilets are always funny.

105
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:53,939
l was watching.

106
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:08,060
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.

107
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:11,396
Pretty boy.

108
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:14,559
Tough boy.

109
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:18,097
l'll be seeing you again...

110
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:19,328
...real soon.

111
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:21,899
l'm gonna be the death of you,
Octopus.

112
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:24,401
Death?

113
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:27,136
Not for me,  brother. Death,  he says.

114
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:29,508
l'm gonna kill you all kinds of dead.

115
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:32,549
l had you beat like eggs.

116
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:34,549
Heck you did.

117
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:37,848
Anybody watching could've seen
l had you right where l wanted you.

118
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:39,991
ln your dreams.

119
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:42,151
You're an accident.

120
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:44,023
You never should've happened.

121
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,755
Your mind ain't right,  Octopus.

122
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:50,993
You're talking crazy.
You're talking crazy talk.

123
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:54,002
We're the only two like us,  pretty boy.

124
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,402
- l'm nothing like you.
- Nothing like me?

125
00:15:58,411 --> 00:16:02,279
Well,  you sure can take
a lot of punishment,  sweetheart.

126
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:03,744
Just like me.

127
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:06,575
You ever wonder why?

128
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:12,183
Never even crossed my mind.

129
00:16:12,392 --> 00:16:14,553
Well,  l'll be learning you!

130
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:18,629
l'll be learning you real soon.

131
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,594
l'll be learning you.

132
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:28,640
Oh,  well,  look who's here.

133
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:31,309
Boss,  we better get out of here.

134
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:47,752
Such pain.

135
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:50,424
Such suffering.

136
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:53,559
Sleep.

137
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:59,368
Come on,  come on,  come on.

138
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,130
Wake up.

139
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:03,935
Wake up.

140
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:07,506
Wake up.

141
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:09,079
Hey,  baby.

142
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,113
- Ellen.
- You're a mess.

143
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:13,312
Three bullets across the deltoid.

144
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,885
They went straight through me.
Hardly took any meat.

145
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,182
Major contusions on any visible skin.

146
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:20,222
Oh,  come on,  Ellen.
They never last long.

147
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:23,418
Evidence of a profusely bleeding
cranial wound.

148
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:25,722
No,  that's nothing. That's just a bump.

149
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:27,763
Yeah,  you're a mess,  all right.

150
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,333
- Really,  l'm okay.
- No,  this is serious.

151
00:17:30,536 --> 00:17:32,936
For God's sake,
you can't keep taking these chances.

152
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:36,131
- l'll be fine.
- You're bleeding out of your head.

153
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:44,074
- lt's gone all sticky. lt'll stop.
- You need to be admitted.

154
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:47,377
No. You know how much l hate that.
lt takes forever.

155
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:50,954
- Don't fight me this time.
- l'll be all right. lt's just- -

156
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,853
l'm missing something.
lt's really important.

157
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:57,090
- Do you know where you are?
- Sure.

158
00:17:57,296 --> 00:17:59,856
- What city?
- Central City,  U.S.A.

159
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,431
What year is it?

160
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:03,226
This year.

161
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:05,495
- Do you know who you are?
- The Spirit.

162
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:08,173
- l beat up bad guys.
- And sometimes they beat you up.

163
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:11,343
And it really hurts when that happens,
but l always get better.

164
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:14,877
l don't know why. You don't know why.
But The Octopus knows something.

165
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:16,070
Why do you say that?

166
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:18,079
Because he told me
he knows something.

167
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:21,350
- You're delirious. Come on.
- No.

168
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:24,219
Oh,  golly,  will you look at that.

169
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:26,082
That was close,  buddy.

170
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,590
l was looking all over for you.

171
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,557
There. That's better.

172
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:34,995
Yup. That's better.

173
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:37,400
That tears it.

174
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:38,729
You're delusional.

175
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:40,405
- Tuska,  over here!
- Ellen!

176
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:45,239
Dr. Ellen Dolan! Over here,  right now!

177
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:51,082
l can hear fluid in his chest.

178
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:52,945
lt's faint,  but l swear it's there.

179
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:01,619
l got it. He's got blood
in both his lungs.

180
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:03,386
Stabilize him,  get him on Pegasus.

181
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:05,791
- Go back to the helicopter.
- l'll flip him over.

182
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:08,694
No,  leave him flat. Get me new gloves.
Gauze.

183
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:17,375
Hurry it up. lf you can't move any faster,
l'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

184
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:19,977
- You find anything?
- No,  sir.

185
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,545
l'm just feeling dizzy
from all the action,  l guess.

186
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:25,046
- Yeah,  we're all damn impressed.
- Thanks.

187
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,719
You're doing this town no good
with your hot-dogging.

188
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,081
- l don't follow you.
- We're flat on our asses...

189
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,553
...happy to clean up
after your dog- and- pony show.

190
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:34,453
Not this again. You know the score.

191
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,594
l thought l did.
Go ahead and enlighten me.

192
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:37,990
Bring me up to speed.

193
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:40,722
Sussman wanted things kept quiet.
Leave it at that.

194
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,525
He thinks l don't run a tight ship?

195
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:46,136
Suspected a leak in your department.
Didn't want The Octopus getting away.

196
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:49,399
So you're lnternal Affairs now,  huh?
l must have missed that memo.

197
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,169
Come on,  it was a judgment call.
l gave it my best shot.

198
00:19:52,378 --> 00:19:55,575
l got one officer an inch from dying,
another,  his head yanked off...

199
00:19:55,781 --> 00:19:58,249
...because you went off half- cocked
after The Octopus.

200
00:19:58,451 --> 00:20:00,942
You're damn right
l'm going after The Octopus!

201
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:03,418
And you're going through my men
like toilet paper.

202
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:05,215
You been to Dropsie Avenue and C?

203
00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:06,914
- Have you seen those girls?
- Yeah.

204
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:10,755
Some just learning how to ride a bike,
there they are,  selling their souls...

205
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:13,090
...slaves to The Octopus
and his poison.

206
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:17,963
Maybe you and your force
could use a little obsession,  Dolan.

207
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:21,698
Maybe you and your force
could work a little harder.

208
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:25,435
Ellen's right. You're off your rocker,
talking about cops like that.

209
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:28,045
Maybe if you and your force
could find The Octopus...

210
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:31,011
- ...l wouldn't have to play it solo.
- Solo,  huh?

211
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:32,241
Solo?

212
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,351
That wasn't our deal,  hotshot.

213
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:37,387
Well,  then maybe we don't have a deal
anymore,  commissioner.

214
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:39,213
Why,  you....

215
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:48,326
You're living at the edge of a cliff,  son.

216
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:52,527
And all you got is a tired old man
trying to hold you back.

217
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,399
Look,  we're both tired.

218
00:20:58,477 --> 00:20:59,944
Yeah.

219
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:03,313
- Yeah.
- Just give me 1 0 minutes.

220
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,547
Hell,  l don't know why l even bother
to try and talk to you anymore.

221
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:10,119
Just give me 1 0 minutes.

222
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:11,847
Just to clear my head.

223
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:14,253
Right. Sure.

224
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:19,327
What's 1 0 minutes
in a man's life anyway?

225
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:20,990
Spirit?

226
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,724
Sir.

227
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:26,672
That cliff l was talking about?

228
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:28,904
There's no bottom.

229
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,071
Don't jump.

230
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:41,448
''What are you?''
That's what the woman asked me.

231
00:21:41,654 --> 00:21:43,588
It's a good question.

232
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:46,223
I wish I had an answer for her.

233
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:48,689
Am I a crazy man?

234
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:51,519
Or am I a man at all?

235
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:54,359
Some nights,  like this one...

236
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:57,764
...when the wind bites deep,
bone deep...

237
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,134
...and even my city
seems to leave me behind,  I wonder:

238
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:04,172
Am I some sort of ghost?

239
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:06,971
Some sort of Flying Dutchman?

240
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:09,647
If the wind picked up
hard enough...

241
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:12,042
...would I just blow away?

242
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:14,209
I'm not a cop.

243
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,285
Not anymore.

244
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:19,155
Not even a dead man.

245
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:22,456
Not even a spirit.

246
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:28,231
We made it,  boss.
Just like you said we would.

247
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:32,930
You still here?

248
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:37,532
Of course l'm still here. l'm your trigger.
l blowed holes right through The Spirit.

249
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:40,109
You're a trigger,  Pathos.

250
00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:41,439
Just look at you.

251
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:44,449
Quick Draw McGraw himself.

252
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,948
l'll be great.
l don't have any bones sticking out.

253
00:22:47,153 --> 00:22:49,314
A couple of splints,  l'll be good to go.

254
00:22:49,522 --> 00:22:53,185
Yeah,  just hop right over to St. Alice's,
get fixed up all nice and new.

255
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:56,156
l'll have to explain why
a criminal mastermind like myself...

256
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:58,887
...doesn't provide his employees
with medical insurance.

257
00:22:59,098 --> 00:23:01,532
That'd be egg on my face,  Pathos.

258
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:06,194
You know l don't like
egg on my face.

259
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:08,032
- Hadn't thought of that.
- No.

260
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,539
Using your brain?
That,  you weren't built for.

261
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:13,609
Just tell me
where the emergency room is.

262
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:17,271
l'll tell them l'm one of the homelesses.
They don't make them pay.

263
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:19,610
Homelesses always get hurt.
Because it's free.

264
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:21,514
- That'll work!
- So will this.

265
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:29,752
No egg on my face!

266
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:31,628
Not a glob!

267
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:36,967
Not a glob.

268
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:47,646
Any other case,  little buddy.

269
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:49,906
Any other job.

270
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:52,809
lf it were anyone but her.

271
00:23:55,955 --> 00:23:57,582
Sand.

272
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:01,224
Sand Saref.

273
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:11,564
Where's your bike?

274
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:14,069
You scrape your knee,
or are you scared for a race?

275
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:16,241
No,  l got sick of that stupid bike.

276
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:19,309
You got sick of losing races to me
is more like it.

277
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:20,868
Where'd you put it?

278
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,607
l pawned it over at Fellman's.

279
00:24:23,816 --> 00:24:26,649
- l got a few bucks for it.
- Pawned it?

280
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:31,947
Look there.

281
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,391
l bet those are real diamonds.

282
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:38,088
You see how they catch the light,
Denny?

283
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:41,292
Only real ones do that.

284
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:49,438
What's with you?

285
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:51,808
Nothing much.

286
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:55,071
- He's not drinking again,  is he?
- No,  no,  he's not drinking.

287
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:56,908
What's got you needing money,  then?

288
00:24:57,883 --> 00:25:01,785
Just something that l saw
over at the window at Kurtzman's.

289
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:03,420
ls it a badge,  like my dad's?

290
00:25:03,622 --> 00:25:05,055
No,  no. lt wasn't a badge.

291
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:07,054
Good,  you ain't hardly
earned a badge.

292
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:10,717
Well,  it was something
that l thought that,  you know...

293
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:16,158
...you might like seeing
as how you like shiny things and all.

294
00:25:22,174 --> 00:25:26,634
lt opens up too.
You can take it and look at the picture.

295
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,379
lf you don't like it,  old man Kurtzman
said he'd take it back.

296
00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:37,447
Do you like it?

297
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:46,654
So you want me to be your girl?

298
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:51,259
Yeah,  sure. l mean,  if- -

299
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,199
You know,  if it's all the same to you.

300
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:56,203
Well,  l suppose l can wear it
now and then.

301
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:02,574
- But that doesn't make me your girl.
- Yeah. Doesn't make....

302
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:18,663
Yeah,  we had us a time,  all right.

303
00:26:18,864 --> 00:26:20,491
The way only city kids could.

304
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,192
l love it!

305
00:26:36,115 --> 00:26:38,879
lt says here Heracles himself
fought with the Argonauts.

306
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:42,419
lmagine Jason and Heracles
back- to- back.

307
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:45,647
- Yeah.
- Jason gleaming in his Golden Fleece.

308
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:48,053
Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:27:05,411 --> 00:27:08,869
Then everything went right
straight to hell.

310
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:13,051
My Uncle Pete was
a has- been fighter.

311
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:17,052
Sand's dad,  a beat cop who was
always looking out for dumb old Pete.

312
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:20,748
Hey,  Pete! What's all this?
What's all- - ?

313
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:34,101
My Uncle Pete did the only thing
his punch- battered brain...

314
00:27:34,306 --> 00:27:36,274
...could tell him to do.

315
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:43,912
Sand got there
a few minutes before me.

316
00:27:46,785 --> 00:27:47,774
Come on.

317
00:27:47,987 --> 00:27:50,615
I tried to be strong for both of us.

318
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:52,790
Come on.

319
00:27:54,026 --> 00:27:57,928
I said some stuff.
I can't remember what.

320
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:01,793
And then that jerk reporter
latched onto us.

321
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,059
Sol,  l can't miss this.

322
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:05,361
So,  kids,  just how does this
make you feel?

323
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:06,663
Are you scared?

324
00:28:06,872 --> 00:28:09,966
- We ain't talking,  so leave us alone.
- You gotta give me something.

325
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:12,137
I'll give you something.

326
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:14,312
I'll give you three words.

327
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,675
I hate cops.

328
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:18,315
Just leave us alone,  will you?

329
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:24,649
l know you're heartbroke,  Sand.

330
00:28:25,224 --> 00:28:27,158
So am l,
but you didn't mean what you said.

331
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,758
Leave me alone,  stay away.

332
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:30,690
- Give it a while.
- Give it a while?

333
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:33,956
- What? What,  us?
- Well,  yeah,  that's what l mean.

334
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:37,033
So,  sure,  we grow up
and we have kids in this sinkhole?

335
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:38,863
You're just not talking straight.

336
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:42,097
And you become a cop
just like you always wanted to.

337
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:45,205
Yeah. Yeah,  maybe l do.

338
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:49,279
Yeah,  and then some punched- out
drunk of an old boxer shoots you dead?

339
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:51,676
- Do you think l want that?
- lt wasn't Pete!

340
00:28:51,884 --> 00:28:54,978
- lt was that guido,  and you know that.
- Who cares?

341
00:28:55,187 --> 00:28:57,348
You know what?
l don't want your world.

342
00:28:57,556 --> 00:29:00,684
l want diamonds,
and l want sports cars...

343
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:04,294
...and l want long dresses
and l want money. And l want lots of it.

344
00:29:04,496 --> 00:29:07,329
And where are you going to find
all that,  Sand?

345
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:10,525
l'm not gonna find it here.
Not in this toilet of a town.

346
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:14,304
So you're too good for me?
You're too good for all of us? ls that it?

347
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:19,878
l am too good for you,
and l am too good for this dump.

348
00:29:20,546 --> 00:29:22,912
- l'm going away,  l'm going far away.
- All right.

349
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:25,208
l'm gonna go
all over the world,  become rich...

350
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:28,443
...and no one is ever gonna know
that l came from this hole!

351
00:29:28,654 --> 00:29:30,246
No one.
And l am never coming back.

352
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:32,123
Then do whatever you want,  Sand!

353
00:29:33,592 --> 00:29:36,584
l don't care about you neither.
l never even wanna see you again!

354
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:38,888
l hate you,  Sand.

355
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,197
I never saw her again.

356
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,808
Word is she took off for Europe.

357
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,745
l never knew if she was alive or dead.

358
00:29:56,648 --> 00:29:58,639
Until now.

359
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:03,822
There's only one way this locket
ended up in poor Sussman's hand.

360
00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:06,991
She was there. She was wearing it.
She is implicated.

361
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:09,126
lf she's doing business
with The Octopus...

362
00:30:09,328 --> 00:30:11,023
...then my feelings
don't mean a damn.

363
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,664
l must find Sand Saref...

364
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:15,766
...and bring her in.

365
00:30:24,777 --> 00:30:27,007
My beautiful Sand Saref.

366
00:30:27,212 --> 00:30:29,476
Are you missing something,  my love?

367
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:32,508
Nothing important.

368
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,751
Just something l lost a long time ago.

369
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:49,766
Mark this moment,  all of you.

370
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:52,300
A new age begins.

371
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:54,563
An age of great deeds.

372
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:58,732
An age of great power.

373
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:01,037
Yes.

374
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,871
All mine.

375
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:08,012
The blood of Heracles is mine.

376
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:36,713
l am sorely disappointed.

377
00:31:38,684 --> 00:31:40,208
Which one of you brought me this?

378
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:42,080
l guess that'd be me.

379
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:45,251
- On your knees,  then.
- Sure thing.

380
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,692
What happened?
What went wrong?

381
00:31:48,894 --> 00:31:50,691
Nothing went wrong,
thanks for asking.

382
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:53,660
Where's my vase? l'm supposed
to have a vase full of blood.

383
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:57,063
- lt's supposed to be in that box.
- Must've been in the other box.

384
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:58,395
What other box?

385
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:00,731
Must've been in the other box.

386
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:02,804
What other box,  you fart?

387
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:06,004
The one the pretty lady run off with.
We was watching.

388
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:07,508
Sand Saref.

389
00:32:07,846 --> 00:32:11,179
l thought l scared her off
with time to spare.

390
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,877
What's she doing in Central City,
anyway?

391
00:32:14,086 --> 00:32:19,547
lt didn't occur to you doorstops to
mention that there was a second box?

392
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:22,989
Nope,  but it looked just like this one.
We was watching.

393
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,122
Seppuku across the stomach,
left to right.

394
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:32,363
That tickles.

395
00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:35,402
With the sword,  toe cheese.

396
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:42,012
So Sand Saref has the blood.

397
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:45,706
You know,  you could've offed her
and brought back both boxes.

398
00:32:45,918 --> 00:32:48,113
That would've simplified things
considerably.

399
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,584
Oh,  l'm supposed
to do everything around here?

400
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:52,716
Now,  that'll wake you up.

401
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:54,916
You have to do something
about Sand Saref.

402
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:57,527
Don't worry about Sand Saref.

403
00:32:57,729 --> 00:33:00,926
That lady's got a thing for the bling.

404
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:04,963
She was after that other box
and whatever it is that's inside of it.

405
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,730
lt's kind of creepy
the way it glows like that.

406
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,932
So the situation's hardly a debacle.

407
00:33:11,143 --> 00:33:14,442
Sand Saref has
the blood of Heracles,  yes.

408
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:17,638
But we have what she wants.

409
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:20,841
- All right,  you fatheads listening to me?
- We sure are,  boss.

410
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:24,716
Find Sand Saref,  find her now.
Tell her l have no problem with her.

411
00:33:24,923 --> 00:33:28,051
She can have her creepy,
blingy thingy.

412
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,158
Get me that blood.

413
00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:32,455
And keep it safe!

414
00:33:32,664 --> 00:33:35,394
Spill one drop
and l'll turn you all into hamburger.

415
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,058
Don't forget about The Spirit.
He's someone to contend with.

416
00:33:39,271 --> 00:33:44,004
He's like a piece of gum stuck to the
bottom of your shoe that won't let go.

417
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:45,608
You know what l mean?

418
00:33:45,811 --> 00:33:48,974
The kind you step on in the summer
that just won't let go.

419
00:33:49,181 --> 00:33:51,012
Am l doing this right?

420
00:33:51,216 --> 00:33:52,649
Yeah,  looks good.

421
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:54,944
l was just wondering,
because it really smarts.

422
00:33:55,153 --> 00:33:57,087
l hate stepping on gum,
even in winter.

423
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:59,280
Makes you step funny.

424
00:33:59,758 --> 00:34:03,455
We're gonna kill The Spirit,
and we're gonna kill him now.

425
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:04,924
Or sometime soon.

426
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,757
He doesn't publish his address.

427
00:34:06,965 --> 00:34:09,365
We're not going to look for him.

428
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:11,798
He's gonna come to us. Real soon.

429
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:14,337
You have a plan.

430
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:18,703
l left the man a clue
that will lead him right to us.

431
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,470
Right soon,  l promise.

432
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,841
What's the hurries,  anyway?

433
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:26,574
lf The Spirit drinks the blood...

434
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:30,152
...if he so much as realizes
what it could do to him...

435
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:32,789
...what it could turn him into,
then we're finished.

436
00:34:33,191 --> 00:34:34,852
And because l said so.

437
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,290
l am a man of my word,  Ms. Saref.

438
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:40,960
Are you?

439
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:44,431
Take the promises you made
to your lovely new wife.

440
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:46,604
''Forsaking all others, '' and all that.

441
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:48,898
Let's not get personal,  shall we?

442
00:34:49,107 --> 00:34:51,769
Oh,  we shall.

443
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:55,469
l commissioned you to find a certain
treasure for me,  Mr. Donenfeld.

444
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,706
lt was to mark the climax of my career.

445
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:01,612
lts crown jewel.

446
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,415
The lost treasure of the Argonauts.

447
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:09,390
And it was even worth me
coming back to this horrid city...

448
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:11,825
...just to touch it.

449
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,327
To hold it.

450
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:15,591
To have it be mine.

451
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:19,703
The shiny thing
to end all shiny things.

452
00:35:20,072 --> 00:35:23,735
And l paid you a fortune for it.

453
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:28,072
And it would've been worth
every nickel,  but you screwed me.

454
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,044
So now we're gonna take
every last one of those nickels...

455
00:35:31,249 --> 00:35:33,649
...and transfer them
into another bunch of accounts.

456
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:35,911
What on earth are you talking about?

457
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:38,021
You're gonna be
quite the philanthropist.

458
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:42,753
Oh,  type the numbers in for him,
darling. He seems a tad dyspeptic.

459
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:45,953
l'm going to need your password,
sweetheart.

460
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:56,029
All right.

461
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:57,708
All right.

462
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,071
lt's robin.

463
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:02,212
R- O- B- l- N. Like the bird.

464
00:36:02,414 --> 00:36:03,938
Or like the kid sidekick.

465
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:08,381
You know,  the one with the cute
little tights and the tight little derriere.

466
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:11,154
lt's going through.

467
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:13,751
Transfer complete.

468
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,594
Why the devil are you
doing this to me?

469
00:36:17,796 --> 00:36:19,559
You sold me out.

470
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:22,289
- l didn't have any choice.
- lmagine my surprise...

471
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:25,561
...when l show up at the drop point
and ran smack into The Octopus.

472
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:28,230
l mean,  what are the odds of that?

473
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:33,468
Unless you sold
the Argo's treasure twice...

474
00:36:33,678 --> 00:36:37,011
...making a perfect ass of yourself.

475
00:36:39,017 --> 00:36:41,315
A perfect ass.

476
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:43,951
Well,  he didn't give me any choice.

477
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:46,914
- He's The Octopus,  he threatened my- -
- Your family.

478
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:50,424
Take a good look at those pictures.

479
00:36:50,629 --> 00:36:54,895
They'll reach your family and every
news service on the planet...

480
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,728
...unless you render them irrelevant.

481
00:37:01,072 --> 00:37:03,540
At least die bravely...

482
00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:05,804
...rodent.

483
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:23,852
Hold all calls.

484
00:37:25,297 --> 00:37:27,288
Excuse me,  got any change?

485
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:34,128
What can l say?

486
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:37,706
Last night you were 20 minutes
from the morgue,  and now look at you.

487
00:37:38,877 --> 00:37:40,435
Just look at you.

488
00:37:42,314 --> 00:37:46,148
l'd recommend three days' bed rest,
but why waste my breath?

489
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:48,478
Look who's talking.
You take the night off.

490
00:37:48,687 --> 00:37:51,349
Yeah,  l'm sure Mrs. Mahoney's
heart transplant can wait.

491
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:55,993
And we might as well just hold off and
see if old Spankowitz's liver explodes.

492
00:37:56,194 --> 00:37:59,425
You need to have some fun.
Put your feet up,  relax.

493
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,223
Maybe go see a show.

494
00:38:03,268 --> 00:38:05,361
What about you,  big man?

495
00:38:06,705 --> 00:38:09,299
- What's on your agenda tonight?
- Oh,  l don't know.

496
00:38:09,507 --> 00:38:11,998
Things stay quiet,
l'd be up for anything.

497
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:14,344
- Anything?
- Sure,  anything.

498
00:38:14,546 --> 00:38:15,535
Dinner,  movie.

499
00:38:16,114 --> 00:38:17,741
Anything.

500
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,416
- So long as things stay quiet?
- Yeah.

501
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,214
- So long as things stay quiet.
- Sure.

502
00:38:24,422 --> 00:38:27,482
Like every crook in Central City
goes on sabbatical?

503
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:30,919
Or maybe if l break the rules.

504
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:34,929
l feel like breaking all kinds of rules.

505
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:36,930
- Lower the blinds.
- They're all down.

506
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:38,830
Oh,  fast hands.

507
00:38:39,037 --> 00:38:40,231
And quiet.

508
00:38:40,438 --> 00:38:42,770
- And sneaky.
- We'll keep things quiet,  all right.

509
00:38:43,141 --> 00:38:44,768
Very,  very quiet.

510
00:38:46,611 --> 00:38:50,274
Keep the mask on. Something tells me
it might be better that way.

511
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:01,823
Oh,  Ellen,  l lo- -

512
00:39:02,027 --> 00:39:05,588
You're in love with every woman
you meet,  Mr. Spirit.

513
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:09,062
You say lovely things to all of us...

514
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:13,333
...and you mean every word you say.
Every time.

515
00:39:13,538 --> 00:39:15,972
Ellen,  it's only you.

516
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:19,540
But we don't even know
your real name.

517
00:39:20,945 --> 00:39:22,845
l'll tell you my name.

518
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:28,517
Someday l'd love to do
your autopsy.

519
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,153
Oh,  thanks for the thought.

520
00:39:30,355 --> 00:39:31,822
l'd make a fortune.

521
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:34,150
Spirit! Front and center!

522
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:38,596
- He's all yours. Fresh as a daisy.
- You should get some sleep.

523
00:39:38,797 --> 00:39:40,958
- You look like hell.
- Love you too,  Daddy.

524
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:44,260
lt's an honor to meet you,  Mr. Spirit.
l'm Morgenstern.

525
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,994
Rookie,  fresh from Baltimore.

526
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,135
Good to have you aboard,
Morgenstern.

527
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:54,472
Come on,
we haven't got the whole day.

528
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:04,319
- Dr. Dolan,  l can't thank you enough.
- Just doing my job,  sir.

529
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:09,752
Bastard.

530
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:17,433
- Marry me.
- Just doing my job,  sir.

531
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:19,034
And what a job it is.

532
00:40:19,237 --> 00:40:21,467
Central City's own masked manhunter.

533
00:40:21,673 --> 00:40:23,334
You're worshipped by the kids.

534
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:25,532
Anything you'd care
to share with them?

535
00:40:25,744 --> 00:40:28,713
Play it straight,  youngsters.
Don't be too tough on your parents.

536
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:31,040
They work hard. And remember...

537
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:32,773
...brush your teeth.

538
00:40:32,984 --> 00:40:34,315
Every word a pearl of wisdom.

539
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,851
Don't forget to remind them
to take their vitamins.

540
00:40:37,055 --> 00:40:38,317
And for the ladies?

541
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:40,514
You know,
we hang on your every word.

542
00:40:40,892 --> 00:40:43,656
Well,  I don't think I could say anything
other than thanks...

543
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:47,630
...for being such amazing,
lovely creatures.

544
00:40:47,832 --> 00:40:48,992
No two alike.

545
00:40:52,437 --> 00:40:54,166
Jesus!

546
00:40:55,707 --> 00:40:58,540
- Ever meet a skirt you didn't chase?
- Just trying to be nice.

547
00:40:58,743 --> 00:41:00,176
You've been nice to my daughter.

548
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:02,539
When will you break her heart,
lounge lizard?

549
00:41:02,747 --> 00:41:05,910
- Lounge lizard? Where do you get off?
- l'll call you anything l want.

550
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:08,108
l don't know
why l bother talking with you.

551
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,220
Because we fight crime,
and right now we got our hands full.

552
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:15,189
You noticed,  have you? Thought with
all the tail you chase,  you'd forgotten.

553
00:41:15,393 --> 00:41:16,621
lt's The Octopus.

554
00:41:16,828 --> 00:41:19,296
Again with The Octopus.

555
00:41:20,131 --> 00:41:22,656
He's up to something big
and it's got to do with me.

556
00:41:22,867 --> 00:41:24,801
He said some weird stuff
about him and me.

557
00:41:25,003 --> 00:41:27,597
l gotta find out what he's talking about.
lt's important.

558
00:41:27,806 --> 00:41:29,137
Hold it.

559
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:33,836
Can we forget about The Octopus
for one minute?

560
00:41:34,045 --> 00:41:35,876
Just one minute?

561
00:41:36,147 --> 00:41:39,310
Now,  we got us a hot case
and a murder suspect...

562
00:41:39,517 --> 00:41:41,781
...who's hauling her butt
to the airport.

563
00:41:41,986 --> 00:41:43,613
- Her?
- Name is Sand Saref.

564
00:41:43,822 --> 00:41:45,653
- Sand Saref?
- Sand Saref.

565
00:41:45,857 --> 00:41:47,518
- Local girl.
- Only picture of her.

566
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:48,919
lt's over 1 5 years old.

567
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:51,095
Father was a cop.
Took one in the face.

568
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:53,230
Disappeared following
her father's murder- -

569
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:55,592
Told some snoop reporter
that she hated cops.

570
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,564
- Right on TV,  she said she hated cops.
- She hated cops.

571
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,499
- That's what l said.
- Moved to Europe.

572
00:42:00,705 --> 00:42:03,902
Eight marriages later,  runs every
jewelry heist this side of Bulgari.

573
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:05,370
Except for in Central City.

574
00:42:05,577 --> 00:42:07,636
- She never came back.
- You never heard of her.

575
00:42:07,846 --> 00:42:11,304
- You never heard of her,  right?
- She never came home.

576
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:14,047
You on drugs or something?

577
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,478
Come on.

578
00:42:18,523 --> 00:42:19,717
Behind the lines,  folks.

579
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:21,687
Behind the lines.

580
00:42:23,495 --> 00:42:25,622
- Commissioner.
- Sand Saref.

581
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,060
She's overseen
hundreds of jewelry robberies...

582
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:31,633
...and in not one case was
a police officer so much as wounded.

583
00:42:31,836 --> 00:42:33,861
Now,  what are the odds
of that,  huh?

584
00:42:34,072 --> 00:42:35,664
Sounds like an Electra complex.

585
00:42:35,874 --> 00:42:38,365
- What's that?
- Electra complex. Plain as your face.

586
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:40,134
Honey,  l'm just an alter cocker.

587
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:41,778
Give me something to work with.

588
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:43,771
Old fart.

589
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:46,576
Jews today. Can't take time
to learn their own language.

590
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:48,775
Electra complex.

591
00:42:48,987 --> 00:42:52,252
lt's like an Oedipal complex
except it's for girls.

592
00:42:52,457 --> 00:42:54,084
She doesn't hate cops.

593
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:56,351
She's just angry she lost her daddy.

594
00:42:56,561 --> 00:42:59,359
Electra complex,  plain and simple.

595
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:02,832
Damn. This girl's gonna
make detective in no time.

596
00:43:03,034 --> 00:43:04,433
Thank you,  sir.

597
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,234
- You like her new jacket?
- Excuse me?

598
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:11,169
You can't take your
eyes off the ladies.

599
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:15,107
There's no chance in hell you haven't
noticed Morgenstern's new flak jacket.

600
00:43:15,313 --> 00:43:18,942
- Even if you are on drugs.
- l'm not on drugs.

601
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:23,480
State of the art,  these jackets.

602
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,485
We had us a shipment
of these babies...

603
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,022
...but we couldn't pay for them
until today...

604
00:43:28,226 --> 00:43:31,389
...when we got a very generous
private donation to the force.

605
00:43:31,596 --> 00:43:33,826
One hundred million dollars
generous.

606
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:35,021
A lot of money.

607
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:38,634
You're damn straight it is.
lt was like a bolt out of the blue.

608
00:43:38,836 --> 00:43:41,532
An online donation. Anonymous.

609
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:43,229
Yeah,  sure,  anonymous.

610
00:43:43,441 --> 00:43:46,740
Took our brain boys all of an hour
to track it right back here.

611
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:50,210
To the offices of an expert
in ancient artifacts.

612
00:43:50,415 --> 00:43:53,475
Yeah,  who turned said artifacts
into a fortune.

613
00:43:53,685 --> 00:43:56,085
You might say he was a purveyor
of stolen property...

614
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,415
...or,  as we put it in the vernacular,
a fence.

615
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:03,560
A world- class fence
by the name of Donenfeld.

616
00:44:03,761 --> 00:44:04,750
Yeah.

617
00:44:04,963 --> 00:44:10,629
But quelle surprise,  old Donenfeld,
he ain't looking so good.

618
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:13,566
And my good buddy Seth here...

619
00:44:14,205 --> 00:44:16,002
...he says the old man had a visitor...

620
00:44:16,207 --> 00:44:18,573
...just about the same time
he got the hard goodbye.

621
00:44:18,776 --> 00:44:21,006
What did you say her name was
again there?

622
00:44:21,212 --> 00:44:23,442
Sand. Sand Saref.

623
00:44:23,648 --> 00:44:25,206
She didn't have an appointment.

624
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:29,011
Sand Saref. Some moniker,  huh?

625
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,051
Yeah,  it's a strange name.

626
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:33,746
- lt's one of a kind.
- Yeah.

627
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:36,654
And my good buddy Seth here...

628
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:40,319
...he couldn't be bothered
to even call it in.

629
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:42,590
My hands were tied,  officer.

630
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,132
Mr. Donenfeld had a standing order.

631
00:44:45,336 --> 00:44:48,203
l was never to come into his office
unless he called me in.

632
00:44:48,406 --> 00:44:49,964
Never.

633
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:52,233
Never,  ever,  ever.

634
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:54,434
Yeah. Sure,  kid.

635
00:44:54,646 --> 00:44:57,945
Morgenstern,  get his number.

636
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:02,615
No. Not murder,  not her.

637
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,447
lt's not possible.

638
00:45:08,893 --> 00:45:11,361
- So you do know her.
- No.

639
00:45:11,562 --> 00:45:13,860
- lf you're holding back on me....
- l'm not.

640
00:45:14,065 --> 00:45:16,431
Your whole theory,
it doesn't make any sense.

641
00:45:16,634 --> 00:45:20,297
Hey,  it fits together like goddamn
macrame once you factor in her....

642
00:45:20,505 --> 00:45:22,234
What'd you call it again there?

643
00:45:22,573 --> 00:45:25,167
- Electra complex.
- Yeah,  that.

644
00:45:25,376 --> 00:45:26,638
lt's psychobabble.

645
00:45:27,011 --> 00:45:28,979
Trying to hang a murder rap
on that woman...

646
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,772
...over some piece
of psychobabble?

647
00:45:30,982 --> 00:45:34,850
Her name is Sand Saref and you
know her and you're covering for her.

648
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:38,079
- l never heard of any Sand Saref.
- You're lying!

649
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:40,951
- Get your hand off my arm,  Dolan.
- You're lying to me.

650
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:44,390
Let go of my arm
before l break yours.

651
00:45:49,434 --> 00:45:50,662
Orders,  sir?

652
00:45:52,003 --> 00:45:52,992
Tail him.

653
00:45:54,772 --> 00:45:56,603
He's lying.

654
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,473
You did a neat little job
up there,  Sand.

655
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,705
You shouldn't have signed it.

656
00:46:20,565 --> 00:46:25,229
Officer Morgenstern,  you wanna help,
find me a lead to The Octopus.

657
00:46:31,776 --> 00:46:33,437
l will see it.

658
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,211
- There.
- l'm in.

659
00:46:42,887 --> 00:46:46,186
And the aces have it.

660
00:46:58,836 --> 00:47:00,929
This l keep as a souvenir.

661
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:04,700
The rest goes to the man who can
get a message to The Octopus.

662
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:19,613
I thought I was closing in,
putting it all together.

663
00:47:19,824 --> 00:47:22,657
That three years on,
here in my second life...

664
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,351
...I had a pretty good idea
of what I had to do.

665
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:28,123
It all got down to me
and The Octopus.

666
00:47:28,332 --> 00:47:30,163
We were headed for a showdown.

667
00:47:30,368 --> 00:47:32,666
I was finally gonna scrub
the city clean of him...

668
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:33,859
...once and for all.

669
00:47:34,071 --> 00:47:35,936
It wasn't pretty
but it was simple enough.

670
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,506
Then you come along like
a sack of rocks to my face.

671
00:47:38,709 --> 00:47:41,507
What's the story,  Sand?
What the heck is going on?

672
00:47:41,712 --> 00:47:44,010
All night,  I've been rolling it around
in my skull.

673
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:47,184
You and The Octopus?
You and murder?

674
00:47:47,385 --> 00:47:48,716
Dolan's gotta be wrong.

675
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,980
There's gotta be more to this,
some explanation.

676
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,158
Not murder,  not you.

677
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:56,724
Can't believe that about you.

678
00:47:56,928 --> 00:47:58,691
You were tough,  Sand,
on the outside...

679
00:47:58,896 --> 00:48:00,557
...but inside,  you were warm.

680
00:48:00,765 --> 00:48:02,858
And soft.

681
00:48:03,067 --> 00:48:05,433
All woman.

682
00:48:06,037 --> 00:48:08,096
One thing I'd bet
my bottom dollar on:

683
00:48:08,306 --> 00:48:10,797
You wouldn't be caught dead
hiding out in a fleabag...

684
00:48:11,008 --> 00:48:13,533
...like any ordinary
criminal would. No.

685
00:48:13,744 --> 00:48:16,406
No,  your taste was
always first- class.

686
00:48:17,348 --> 00:48:19,213
All the way.

687
00:48:22,687 --> 00:48:23,779
Weird.

688
00:48:25,756 --> 00:48:27,951
That's just plain damn weird.

689
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,390
Sir,  you promised the new
hyper- addictive synapse accelerant...

690
00:48:31,596 --> 00:48:33,723
...would be ready by last week.

691
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:36,900
Don't you think
that's plain damn weird?

692
00:48:42,206 --> 00:48:45,642
Yes,  sir. Just plain damn weird.

693
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:48,277
Also,  our profits
are down 20 percent.

694
00:48:48,479 --> 00:48:51,880
Good. l was beginning to think
it was just me.

695
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,550
That's plain damn weird.

696
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:55,042
Yes,  sir.

697
00:48:55,253 --> 00:48:57,687
l was trying to make us a smart one...

698
00:48:57,889 --> 00:49:00,187
...and this thing
just sort of popped out.

699
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:03,121
Twenty percent across the board.

700
00:49:04,462 --> 00:49:07,727
Reduce the price on the old stuff,
we'll make it up in units.

701
00:49:07,932 --> 00:49:10,526
Word has hit the streets
about the side effects.

702
00:49:10,735 --> 00:49:13,795
No one likes having their teeth
turned into graham crackers.

703
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:18,138
How can l get anything done
with all this time on my hands?

704
00:49:18,342 --> 00:49:21,072
Besides,  when my buddies here
find Sand Saref...

705
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:23,338
...l won't need profits,
l'll have the blood.

706
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:25,742
Then if l want something,
l'll just take it.

707
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,850
That's what gods do.

708
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:35,853
He is really damn little.

709
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:37,955
l mean...

710
00:49:38,162 --> 00:49:39,789
...it's really little.

711
00:49:39,997 --> 00:49:42,761
- They can't find her.
- Yeah,  we can't find her.

712
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:45,299
- We looked everywhere.
- Except where she was.

713
00:49:45,503 --> 00:49:47,437
- We should've looked there.
- We did look.

714
00:49:47,638 --> 00:49:49,538
- Where's that?
- Kill them all,  please.

715
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,002
Just kill them all.

716
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,368
We can't spare them.

717
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:53,702
- We're running low.
- Yeah.

718
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:55,845
- You're running low on us.
- Floss said so.

719
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:57,912
We was listening.

720
00:49:58,115 --> 00:50:00,140
l'm depressed.

721
00:50:01,252 --> 00:50:04,449
l wish The Spirit would come so
l could get me some real killing done.

722
00:50:04,655 --> 00:50:09,354
l told you already,
that's going to be complex.

723
00:50:18,035 --> 00:50:21,266
Spirit thinks he can't stay hurt.

724
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:25,932
That stuff l put in him and me
is unstable.

725
00:50:26,344 --> 00:50:28,642
Might not last.

726
00:50:28,846 --> 00:50:31,474
The blood will take care of that.

727
00:50:32,016 --> 00:50:36,953
Meanwhile,  l'm getting
El Espirito dead while l still can.

728
00:50:37,288 --> 00:50:39,119
To that end...

729
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:41,814
...l got us another opinion.

730
00:50:42,259 --> 00:50:43,487
Brought in a specialist.

731
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:48,424
Someone to seal the deal.

732
00:51:07,518 --> 00:51:08,985
You speak to my soul,  monsieur.

733
00:51:10,855 --> 00:51:13,756
The black- eyed Venus
is in Suite 1 51 0.

734
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:19,891
Long time no see,  Sand.

735
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:29,200
You gonna arrest me? Or do you have
something else in mind?

736
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,965
l'm bringing you in.

737
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:32,699
Hands behind your head.

738
00:51:34,512 --> 00:51:35,501
You sure about that?

739
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,347
Don't make me repeat myself.

740
00:51:37,548 --> 00:51:39,345
Hands behind your head.

741
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,916
Your wish is my command.

742
00:51:45,956 --> 00:51:47,048
Okay.

743
00:51:47,258 --> 00:51:49,886
Put a robe on or something
but no tricks.

744
00:51:50,094 --> 00:51:52,722
Yes,  sir,  Mr. Spirit,  sir.

745
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,730
Oh,  watch out for my husband,
you'll trip.

746
00:52:00,971 --> 00:52:02,962
Why this?

747
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:06,935
lt's not like l killed him.
He did it to himself about an hour ago.

748
00:52:07,144 --> 00:52:09,510
lt's all the fault
of this goddamned vase.

749
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:12,045
He tasted the stuff
and,  well,  see for yourself.

750
00:52:12,249 --> 00:52:14,843
- lt's stolen.
- Oh,  yeah.

751
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:17,486
You are a common criminal.

752
00:52:17,688 --> 00:52:19,417
There's nothing common about me.

753
00:52:19,623 --> 00:52:23,787
You're a criminal. l'm bringing you in
for the murder of a fence,  Donenfeld.

754
00:52:23,994 --> 00:52:25,621
lf you're gonna lock me up...

755
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,856
...do it over something
l am actually guilty of,  stupid.

756
00:52:29,066 --> 00:52:30,328
Oh,  you're guilty of a lot.

757
00:52:31,035 --> 00:52:34,664
l could burn a priest's ears
confessing the half of it.

758
00:52:34,872 --> 00:52:37,272
But this time,  my hands are clean,
crime fighter.

759
00:52:37,475 --> 00:52:40,035
So run on home,
wait for the forensics report.

760
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,610
l haven't shot anybody in days.

761
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:45,907
There probably isn't a law
on the books that you wouldn't break.

762
00:52:46,117 --> 00:52:48,278
Do l look like a good girl?

763
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:50,610
You don't care who you've hurt?

764
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:53,780
What's that got to do with anything?

765
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:58,291
Sand,  The Octopus,  that fence
and you?

766
00:52:59,797 --> 00:53:02,231
Now,  after all of these....

767
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:07,530
Nothing fits together.

768
00:53:07,738 --> 00:53:10,263
There's that crazy talk
from The Octopus about him and- -

769
00:53:10,474 --> 00:53:12,305
Listen,  mister...

770
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,499
...l don't care.

771
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:16,646
l don't even care about people
that l like and l don't know you.

772
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:20,578
No,  of course you don't.
But things,  now,  those you care about.

773
00:53:22,653 --> 00:53:25,087
l don't see what use
l could possibly be to you.

774
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:27,951
l have nothing to offer
this rotten little town of yours.

775
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:31,026
As a matter of fact,  l despise it.

776
00:53:31,228 --> 00:53:34,823
There's one thing between that river
and that ocean that l came here for.

777
00:53:35,032 --> 00:53:37,091
What? That stupid vase?

778
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:39,292
lt wasn't supposed to be a vase.

779
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:42,870
lt was supposed to be worth
something more than jewels.

780
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:46,374
Something a little girl's dreams
are made of.

781
00:53:46,777 --> 00:53:49,610
l knew a little girl like that once.

782
00:53:50,948 --> 00:53:52,848
You don't know anything. Get out.

783
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:55,917
She was a very sweet girl
but the world broke her heart.

784
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,815
She wasn't after any vase.

785
00:53:58,022 --> 00:54:00,786
She was looking for a hero.
Weren't you,  little girl?

786
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:03,016
You were looking for a hero
and his armor.

787
00:54:03,227 --> 00:54:05,525
The only man who would know that
is dead.

788
00:54:05,729 --> 00:54:08,289
The Fleece. The Golden Fleece.

789
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:09,761
Jason's Golden Fleece.

790
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:13,095
He's dead.
You're dead. You're dead.

791
00:54:30,154 --> 00:54:32,213
- Will you look at that?
- Don't that beat all?

792
00:54:32,656 --> 00:54:33,680
Hey,  it's The Spirit.

793
00:54:34,091 --> 00:54:36,559
- He's street pizza.
- He looks stupid.

794
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,786
- Wanker.
- You'll believe a man can't fly.

795
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:41,362
Jump already.

796
00:54:41,565 --> 00:54:43,226
Jump,  jump,  jump

797
00:54:43,434 --> 00:54:45,231
Jump,  jump,  jump

798
00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:56,042
Get me the hell out of here.

799
00:55:06,924 --> 00:55:08,516
Not right now. l'm kind of busy.

800
00:55:08,726 --> 00:55:10,921
lt's Morgenstern.
l might have a lead for you.

801
00:55:11,128 --> 00:55:13,062
Nobody noticed all of that salt.

802
00:55:13,264 --> 00:55:14,595
lt was right under our noses.

803
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:17,892
- Could you pick up the pace?
- Salt. lndustrial salt.

804
00:55:18,102 --> 00:55:20,969
One of The Octopus' henchmen,
we found him dead near the flats.

805
00:55:21,171 --> 00:55:22,604
Remember where Sussman got shot?

806
00:55:22,806 --> 00:55:26,071
lndustrial salt,
it was caked all over his shoes.

807
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:28,575
Dolan was right.
you'll make detective in no time.

808
00:55:28,779 --> 00:55:30,110
Thank you,  sir.

809
00:55:30,514 --> 00:55:32,243
l gotta go.

810
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:08,512
l'll buy you a drink.

811
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:11,279
All right,  folks,  show's over.
Time to move on.

812
00:56:11,488 --> 00:56:14,753
Yeah,  well,  Sand,
that went great,  didn't it?

813
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,553
Reunions between old sweethearts
will have to wait.

814
00:56:18,762 --> 00:56:21,856
l got bigger fish to fry.
l'm coming after you,  Octopus...

815
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:25,433
...but before l kill you,  you're gonna
answer me some questions.

816
00:56:34,111 --> 00:56:38,548
Morgenstern said there was salt on
his shoes. There's plenty of it here.

817
00:56:40,384 --> 00:56:43,148
Plenty of bad guys too.

818
00:56:43,354 --> 00:56:45,515
All the enemy has
is guns and knives.

819
00:56:46,824 --> 00:56:49,884
I have an entire city as my weapon.

820
00:56:55,132 --> 00:56:56,429
My arsenal:

821
00:56:56,633 --> 00:56:59,124
Iron- jawed fire escapes.

822
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,194
Man- made lightning.

823
00:57:02,973 --> 00:57:04,372
Unforgiving pavement.

824
00:57:24,895 --> 00:57:26,954
She provides for me.

825
00:57:28,265 --> 00:57:29,698
She protects me.

826
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:35,300
She is my mother,  my city is.

827
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:38,705
She's a good mother.

828
00:57:41,445 --> 00:57:43,504
She always shows me the way.

829
00:57:51,955 --> 00:57:54,515
What a fine detective.

830
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:58,217
You followed the breadcrumbs
right to us.

831
00:58:07,104 --> 00:58:09,766
You're not doing anybody good
by falling asleep on the job.

832
00:58:09,973 --> 00:58:12,999
So why don't you go home,
get yourself some proper rest?

833
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,371
You look like something
that the cat dragged in.

834
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:17,547
So sweet of you to come by,  Daddy.

835
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:21,411
l was just checking in on Sussman.
They wouldn't let me see him. Twits.

836
00:58:21,618 --> 00:58:24,917
Sussman's still in critical,
they're trying to save his spine.

837
00:58:25,122 --> 00:58:28,387
Yeah? What's the odds
of him walking again?

838
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,059
Hard to tell.

839
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,693
Miracles do happen.

840
00:58:33,797 --> 00:58:35,526
Damn Spirit.

841
00:58:35,732 --> 00:58:37,757
- He's over the edge.
- Don't go there,  Daddy.

842
00:58:37,968 --> 00:58:40,698
- He's a goddamn menace.
- He's something the world needs.

843
00:58:40,904 --> 00:58:42,098
He's a hero.

844
00:58:42,306 --> 00:58:45,070
He's a goddamn menace and my
own daughter's in love with him.

845
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:47,402
He's why you're killing yourself,
waiting up.

846
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:50,409
Yes. He's why l'm still here tonight.

847
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:53,105
Yeah. Just in case
they wheel him in here...

848
00:58:53,317 --> 00:58:55,478
- ...one more goddamn time.
- Just in case.

849
00:58:55,686 --> 00:58:58,280
So you can lose your youth
stapling his parts back?

850
00:58:58,689 --> 00:59:02,125
l'm not a child.
And l rarely use staples on anybody.

851
00:59:02,726 --> 00:59:06,127
- Can't you see what you're doing?
- l know exactly what l'm doing.

852
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,230
l'm giving him exactly what he needs.

853
00:59:08,432 --> 00:59:10,696
- He's using you.
- He needs me.

854
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:13,995
l'm the only one who knows his body.

855
00:59:14,204 --> 00:59:15,865
How to treat him.

856
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:21,199
Plenty of dames who know all about
his body,  from what l hear.

857
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:22,503
That's not what l meant.

858
00:59:22,713 --> 00:59:25,739
Plenty of broads he's stretched across
a gurney or what have you...

859
00:59:25,949 --> 00:59:27,211
...knowing just what to say.

860
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:29,476
So this is why you came here tonight.

861
00:59:29,686 --> 00:59:31,745
Melting them like butter
with his fingers- -

862
00:59:31,955 --> 00:59:33,217
That's enough.

863
00:59:33,857 --> 00:59:36,223
Don't make me ask you to leave.

864
00:59:38,161 --> 00:59:41,153
Honey,  l don't know
how to talk about this stuff.

865
00:59:42,232 --> 00:59:44,393
You surely don't.

866
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:49,204
Why do you think l spend my nights
knocking around that house all alone?

867
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,104
Guess she had her reasons.

868
00:59:56,647 --> 00:59:59,047
You're married to your job.

869
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:00,438
So am l.

870
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:03,213
So is he.

871
01:00:06,256 --> 01:00:09,692
You were so much happier
in the old days with Denny.

872
01:00:11,395 --> 01:00:12,828
Denny's dead.

873
01:00:14,431 --> 01:00:15,455
Yeah.

874
01:00:17,067 --> 01:00:18,694
Yeah,  Denny Colt is dead.

875
01:00:18,902 --> 01:00:21,769
- Sweet kid.
- Yes,  he was.

876
01:00:22,072 --> 01:00:25,007
And l'll never forget him
but we keep going.

877
01:00:27,311 --> 01:00:29,506
l lost my Boy Scout.

878
01:00:31,982 --> 01:00:34,815
Yeah. Yeah...

879
01:00:35,452 --> 01:00:37,750
...and l lost my little prom queen,  huh?

880
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:42,218
- Good night,  sweetheart.
- Good night,  Daddy.

881
01:00:42,426 --> 01:00:45,020
l just hope that son of a bitch
knows how lucky he is.

882
01:00:46,096 --> 01:00:47,723
He doesn't.

883
01:00:57,374 --> 01:00:59,535
I can feel you.

884
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,802
You're so weary.

885
01:01:02,012 --> 01:01:06,506
Let me hold you.

886
01:01:09,886 --> 01:01:11,581
What smells dental?

887
01:01:16,126 --> 01:01:18,458
Dental and Nazi.

888
01:01:18,662 --> 01:01:19,890
Great.

889
01:01:21,698 --> 01:01:23,393
Oh,  no.

890
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:29,731
Oh,  brother.

891
01:01:35,946 --> 01:01:40,110
l've known some pretty strange women
in my time,  some darn strange women.

892
01:01:40,317 --> 01:01:41,682
But this one...

893
01:01:41,885 --> 01:01:45,616
...if she is who l think she is,
she's got the final word on strange.

894
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:03,169
l am Plaster. Plaster of Paris.

895
01:02:20,123 --> 01:02:21,954
l will stick to my man.

896
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:28,889
Till death do us part.

897
01:02:35,038 --> 01:02:36,630
Death.

898
01:02:38,608 --> 01:02:41,168
Death. Death,  death.

899
01:02:42,879 --> 01:02:45,871
lt's just about all we think about,
isn't it?

900
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:47,750
We eat...

901
01:02:47,951 --> 01:02:49,179
...so we won't die.

902
01:02:49,386 --> 01:02:52,913
We mate so that
our seed will live on.

903
01:02:53,123 --> 01:02:55,591
Create art and build skyscrapers...

904
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:59,489
...so that our names
will be remembered for centuries.

905
01:03:08,004 --> 01:03:11,701
Mr. Long,  my good friend,
how are you?

906
01:03:11,908 --> 01:03:13,899
What can l do for you?

907
01:03:14,111 --> 01:03:15,203
A message?

908
01:03:15,412 --> 01:03:17,778
And from whom would that be?

909
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:22,215
Sand Saref. Oh,  yes,  l know her.

910
01:03:22,486 --> 01:03:25,455
Well,  you should've known better
than to play cards with her.

911
01:03:25,655 --> 01:03:27,748
And what would her message be?

912
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,922
The projects?

913
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:32,057
Out off that old main drag,  oh.

914
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:34,696
Hell,  yeah,  l know it.

915
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:35,956
Tomorrow night,  then.

916
01:03:36,466 --> 01:03:38,127
Let's say...

917
01:03:38,335 --> 01:03:40,200
...after dinner.

918
01:03:40,971 --> 01:03:43,303
Zai jian,  my honored friend.

919
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:48,211
- Where was l?
- Death.

920
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:49,503
Death,  yes.

921
01:03:51,448 --> 01:03:53,575
We live our short...

922
01:03:53,784 --> 01:03:56,912
...frantic,  fearful lives,
twisting this way and that.

923
01:03:58,121 --> 01:03:59,884
Music and ambition.

924
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:04,083
Making up gods,  afterlives,
all to keep our eyes off...

925
01:04:04,294 --> 01:04:07,957
...that immovable,  impassable,
diamond- hard retaining wall...

926
01:04:08,165 --> 01:04:13,000
...that is death,
realizing it will splatter our brains...

927
01:04:13,336 --> 01:04:14,564
...like eggs.

928
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:16,932
Pardon me,
but is there a point to all this?

929
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,836
Because l'm getting old
just listening to you.

930
01:04:20,544 --> 01:04:23,104
Man,  you are really thick.

931
01:04:23,413 --> 01:04:26,849
You just don't get it.

932
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,951
We're two of a kind,  you and me.

933
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,181
Ain't neither one of us getting old.

934
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:35,187
Well,  l sure as heck can get bored.

935
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:40,288
You keep teasing about
how we're two of a kind.

936
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:42,488
So how's that?

937
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:44,797
What are we,  Octopus?

938
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:46,764
l'm getting to that.

939
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,198
Well,  move it along.

940
01:04:48,405 --> 01:04:50,930
Do you remember your death,
pretty boy?

941
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:53,041
Not the sort of thing a guy forgets.

942
01:05:00,784 --> 01:05:02,081
Yeah,  l remember.

943
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:12,692
When they wheeled you in,
you were stone- cold dead.

944
01:05:12,896 --> 01:05:15,421
Not a breath of life in you.

945
01:05:16,633 --> 01:05:18,601
You were perfect.

946
01:05:19,436 --> 01:05:22,462
Dead as Star Trek.

947
01:05:22,672 --> 01:05:26,108
And I was your coroner.

948
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:31,178
But I was,  oh,  so much,  much
more than that.

949
01:05:31,381 --> 01:05:33,110
l'd built up a righteous drug trade.

950
01:05:33,316 --> 01:05:35,784
lt's amazing how much a hospital
doesn't miss.

951
01:05:35,986 --> 01:05:39,581
All you have to do is water it down,
spruce it up and achtung.

952
01:05:39,789 --> 01:05:40,778
Swiss bank accounts.

953
01:05:41,191 --> 01:05:43,751
But mere money was never
what The Octopus was after.

954
01:05:44,561 --> 01:05:47,758
All right,  so l give up.
What were you after?

955
01:05:48,765 --> 01:05:51,427
lmmortality.

956
01:05:51,635 --> 01:05:54,468
All five sweet syllables of it.

957
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:57,071
There had to be a better way
to keep someone alive...

958
01:05:57,274 --> 01:06:00,141
...other than cutting them open
like some free- range chicken.

959
01:06:00,343 --> 01:06:03,403
Free- range chickens with their big,
brown,  ugly- ass eggs.

960
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:04,602
They piss me off.

961
01:06:04,814 --> 01:06:09,012
Every time l think about those big,
brown eggs,  they piss me off.

962
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:11,744
Or pills.
They're just another way to stall death.

963
01:06:11,955 --> 01:06:13,980
Cling on for a heartbeat.
Hardly the answer.

964
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:16,158
- l got down to basics.
- The essence of life.

965
01:06:16,359 --> 01:06:17,519
- l cracked code.
- Genetics.

966
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:21,163
- That's how smart l am.
- Yeah,  you're a real smart fella.

967
01:06:21,364 --> 01:06:23,559
Thank you. But it wasn't that easy.

968
01:06:23,767 --> 01:06:26,361
And l've got a freezer
full of stray beagles to prove it.

969
01:06:26,569 --> 01:06:30,266
Oh,  what that serum did
to those poor dogs...

970
01:06:30,473 --> 01:06:32,202
...was just plain wrong.

971
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:35,837
But when l got it right,
well,  l had to try it out.

972
01:06:36,046 --> 01:06:39,345
l wasn't about to try it on myself.
l might've come out looking funny.

973
01:06:39,549 --> 01:06:41,244
l needed a human.

974
01:06:41,451 --> 01:06:43,009
And there l was.

975
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:44,982
And there you was.

976
01:06:45,188 --> 01:06:48,248
l gave you a modest injection
and l waited.

977
01:07:02,205 --> 01:07:05,003
Your second life
began that very night.

978
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:06,539
Do you remember?

979
01:07:11,581 --> 01:07:13,344
Oh,  yeah,  l remember.

980
01:07:16,186 --> 01:07:18,245
Somewhere in the midst
of all that praying...

981
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:20,013
...and whimpering and sniveling...

982
01:07:20,223 --> 01:07:23,090
...you must have found
something sharp.

983
01:07:38,008 --> 01:07:40,169
You know,  l always wanted to ask:

984
01:07:40,377 --> 01:07:42,368
Where did you go when you got out?

985
01:07:43,747 --> 01:07:46,079
l took a walk.

986
01:07:49,853 --> 01:07:52,754
I had myself a think.

987
01:07:55,191 --> 01:07:56,954
I visited an old friend.

988
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:01,153
l don't know what happened,
but l still move,  l still breathe.

989
01:08:01,364 --> 01:08:03,798
lt's impossible,  but l'm still alive.

990
01:08:04,601 --> 01:08:06,762
All my life,  all l wanted to be
was a good cop.

991
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:08,801
That's all changed.
Everything's changed.

992
01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:11,599
They're winning,  sir.
The bad guys are winning.

993
01:08:11,808 --> 01:08:14,800
l think l've got something more
to fight back with now.

994
01:08:15,211 --> 01:08:17,873
l'm something else now.

995
01:08:18,081 --> 01:08:20,675
l can go places,  l can do things
they won't let cops do.

996
01:08:20,884 --> 01:08:24,445
But l can't have any weaknesses.
No name. No friends.

997
01:08:24,654 --> 01:08:26,645
l have to stay dead
in everybody's eyes.

998
01:08:27,323 --> 01:08:29,018
Even Ellen's.

999
01:08:29,559 --> 01:08:31,117
But l could be your spy.

1000
01:08:31,628 --> 01:08:33,789
l could work with your men.

1001
01:08:33,997 --> 01:08:36,864
Behind them,  in the shadows.

1002
01:08:37,067 --> 01:08:41,003
l could be
the city's protector,  its- -  lts- -

1003
01:08:41,938 --> 01:08:43,462
lts spirit.
yexunadoushi
1004
01:08:44,707 --> 01:08:47,505
Exit hero cop,  enter The Spirit.

1005
01:08:47,944 --> 01:08:50,811
Pain in the ass. Tough as nails.

1006
01:08:51,014 --> 01:08:54,040
Eureka!

1007
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:58,815
So l shot myself up,  and we became
brothers under the skin.

1008
01:08:59,022 --> 01:09:02,219
So,  what the hell are we,  Octopus?

1009
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:04,624
You're works in progress.

1010
01:09:04,961 --> 01:09:07,521
And once he has the vase
and its contents...

1011
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,995
...its mystic contents,
lost over millennia...

1012
01:09:11,201 --> 01:09:13,567
...he'll drink of it
and he'll become immortal.

1013
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,670
Don't tease.

1014
01:09:15,872 --> 01:09:18,705
Seeing as how l'm gonna die anyway,
clue me in.

1015
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:20,569
What's in the vase?

1016
01:09:20,777 --> 01:09:23,143
- Thor's hammer?
- No.

1017
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:24,877
Better.

1018
01:09:25,081 --> 01:09:27,208
The DNA...

1019
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:30,443
- ...of a god.
- Not a god. Not exactly.

1020
01:09:30,653 --> 01:09:34,555
Yeah,  because,  you know,  humans
and gods,  well,  they don't mix very well.

1021
01:09:34,757 --> 01:09:38,989
The only route to take is to find the
connection between man and god...

1022
01:09:39,195 --> 01:09:41,322
...the child of an immortal
and a human.

1023
01:09:41,531 --> 01:09:45,467
See,  Zeus couldn't keep it in his pants,
so he made bags and bags of heroes.

1024
01:09:45,668 --> 01:09:48,000
Now,  the greatest of them all
was Heracles.

1025
01:09:48,204 --> 01:09:50,331
And we found his ass.

1026
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:53,065
Well,  his blood anyway.
He left some blood around.

1027
01:09:53,276 --> 01:09:54,573
And we know where it is.

1028
01:09:54,777 --> 01:09:59,407
So that's the missing link
between science and magic.

1029
01:09:59,616 --> 01:10:03,916
Now,  once Heracles' blood mixes
with Octopus' formula....

1030
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,214
- l become a god.
- Or the next best thing.

1031
01:10:07,423 --> 01:10:09,254
l become a god.

1032
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:12,451
And you'll be just one more
sad little byproduct.

1033
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:14,896
One of his many,  many,  many failures.

1034
01:10:15,265 --> 01:10:17,733
Come on,  now.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

1035
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:22,097
Besides,  look at all the lovely buddies
l've made along the way.

1036
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:23,294
We was easy to make.

1037
01:10:23,506 --> 01:10:25,337
Yeah,  the boss says
we was easy to make.

1038
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:27,601
But your failures were several.

1039
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:30,108
And unpleasant.

1040
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:33,616
Yeah,  you know,
you get so much as one little drop...

1041
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:36,284
...the wrong temperature,
and everything just- -

1042
01:10:36,853 --> 01:10:38,445
Let me show you.

1043
01:10:38,922 --> 01:10:40,651
lt's kind of sad...

1044
01:10:40,857 --> 01:10:43,257
...but it's really kind of cool too.

1045
01:10:43,459 --> 01:10:44,721
This is Muffin.

1046
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:47,826
She's my favorite.

1047
01:11:16,526 --> 01:11:18,255
We have to have people over
more often.

1048
01:11:18,461 --> 01:11:19,985
l like this.

1049
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,225
The cat.

1050
01:11:28,838 --> 01:11:31,739
She is all the reason l need.

1051
01:11:32,075 --> 01:11:33,372
l will kill you.

1052
01:11:34,644 --> 01:11:38,011
- Oh,  no,  you have to die,  Spirit.
- Yeah,  because you got the juice,  man.

1053
01:11:38,214 --> 01:11:41,650
Your system's been prepared.
You're the only one the blood won't kill.

1054
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:44,217
One sip and you could be rendered
as immortal as he.

1055
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,012
The Octopus can be the only one.

1056
01:11:46,222 --> 01:11:48,588
There can be no competition
once he's world ruler.

1057
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:51,021
Yes,  then everyone
will have to do what l say.

1058
01:11:51,227 --> 01:11:56,665
They will all have to do what l say
because l will be the ruler of the world.

1059
01:11:56,866 --> 01:11:59,130
Then everything
will start to make sense.

1060
01:11:59,335 --> 01:12:01,303
Yes,  everything will make sense.

1061
01:12:01,504 --> 01:12:03,972
Everything will start to make sense.

1062
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:06,736
Let's get back to business.

1063
01:12:06,943 --> 01:12:08,308
Yes,  back to business.

1064
01:12:09,445 --> 01:12:11,003
Back to killing your ass.

1065
01:12:12,081 --> 01:12:14,879
Now,  here's where things
become a little tricky.

1066
01:12:15,084 --> 01:12:16,847
lt's all about integration.

1067
01:12:17,053 --> 01:12:19,681
Now,  in your current state,
you heal very quickly.

1068
01:12:19,889 --> 01:12:21,880
Your wounds mend in moments.

1069
01:12:22,091 --> 01:12:26,357
The only solution,  it turns out,  is to
affect your systemic disintegration.

1070
01:12:26,562 --> 01:12:28,462
ln short...

1071
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:33,827
...to render you into
so many different parts spread so far...

1072
01:12:34,037 --> 01:12:36,699
...that reintegration
would be impossible.

1073
01:12:38,341 --> 01:12:40,400
And being the man that l am...

1074
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:44,876
...l like to start from the bottom
and work my way up.

1075
01:12:45,081 --> 01:12:48,016
Floss,  bring me those bags.

1076
01:12:53,056 --> 01:12:56,116
l'm going to mail your ass
all over the country.

1077
01:12:57,327 --> 01:12:58,885
Plaster...

1078
01:12:59,095 --> 01:13:00,255
...bring me his toes.

1079
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:05,566
Plaster.

1080
01:13:19,682 --> 01:13:21,081
Enough of this frog talk.

1081
01:13:21,284 --> 01:13:22,444
l don't understand it.

1082
01:13:23,753 --> 01:13:25,118
Paris...

1083
01:13:25,321 --> 01:13:27,380
...give me his toes.

1084
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:30,081
That's an order.

1085
01:13:34,364 --> 01:13:35,558
l hate you.

1086
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:44,803
This is for Sand.

1087
01:13:46,309 --> 01:13:47,469
This is for me.

1088
01:13:47,677 --> 01:13:50,271
And this one's for Muffin.

1089
01:13:58,287 --> 01:14:00,084
That all you got?

1090
01:14:07,296 --> 01:14:08,854
Who is this Sand?

1091
01:14:10,233 --> 01:14:12,599
Not now. Let's go.

1092
01:14:35,024 --> 01:14:36,753
The Spirit.

1093
01:14:37,226 --> 01:14:38,887
Plaster.

1094
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,908
And this is for Sand.

1095
01:14:58,881 --> 01:15:02,248
l am Plaster of Paris.

1096
01:15:02,852 --> 01:15:05,787
The toast of Montmartre.

1097
01:15:06,856 --> 01:15:08,915
l will stick to my man.

1098
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:11,389
Till death do us part.

1099
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:19,032
You're close now.

1100
01:15:19,435 --> 01:15:22,529
Very,  very close.

1101
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,914
You can't fight me.

1102
01:15:33,115 --> 01:15:35,743
You. You are mine. Mine. Mine.

1103
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:56,301
Hey,  man,  l know the feeling.

1104
01:15:56,506 --> 01:15:58,940
You should meet my wife.

1105
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:04,405
Just put one foot in front of the other.

1106
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,175
Here we go again.

1107
01:16:40,049 --> 01:16:42,449
I'm dead again.

1108
01:16:45,087 --> 01:16:47,681
The fight's gone out of me.

1109
01:16:50,893 --> 01:16:52,758
I'm ready for you,  Lorelei.

1110
01:16:52,962 --> 01:16:54,486
Come.

1111
01:16:54,697 --> 01:16:57,291
Come. Come. Come.

1112
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,899
Come.

1113
01:16:59,101 --> 01:17:01,262
It is time.

1114
01:17:01,537 --> 01:17:03,596
Come. Come.

1115
01:17:04,273 --> 01:17:06,639
No more pain.

1116
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:09,443
No more suffering.

1117
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,742
Give up the last of it,  Denny.

1118
01:17:16,085 --> 01:17:18,485
Give up the ghost.

1119
01:17:19,622 --> 01:17:21,283
Give up the spirit.

1120
01:17:21,657 --> 01:17:23,716
Yes,  my darling. Yes.

1121
01:17:44,447 --> 01:17:45,880
No.

1122
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,149
It is done.

1123
01:17:49,352 --> 01:17:51,946
It is done. It is done.

1124
01:17:52,154 --> 01:17:54,122
What's it they say about
when you die...

1125
01:17:54,323 --> 01:17:56,723
...about your whole life
flashing before your eyes?

1126
01:17:56,926 --> 01:17:58,188
Forget all that.

1127
01:17:58,394 --> 01:17:59,884
All I see are women.

1128
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:04,931
My sweet Ellen,  always there to put
my ragged pieces back together.

1129
01:18:05,134 --> 01:18:07,102
And Sand.

1130
01:18:07,737 --> 01:18:09,500
That poor lost soul.

1131
01:18:11,674 --> 01:18:15,075
Beautiful,  beautiful Sand.

1132
01:18:24,086 --> 01:18:27,954
It's so funny my last thought
would be of Sand.

1133
01:18:36,599 --> 01:18:38,362
No.

1134
01:18:38,567 --> 01:18:40,831
Lorelei,  you're not for me just yet.

1135
01:18:41,037 --> 01:18:43,301
No,  not again.

1136
01:18:43,506 --> 01:18:45,838
They need me. I gotta go back.

1137
01:18:46,042 --> 01:18:48,840
I will always be with you,  Denny Colt.

1138
01:18:49,045 --> 01:18:52,037
You won't escape me forever.

1139
01:18:52,515 --> 01:18:54,710
They need me.

1140
01:19:25,281 --> 01:19:27,112
Sand...

1141
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:28,974
...at the projects.

1142
01:19:30,686 --> 01:19:32,950
Octopus.

1143
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:36,385
Pieces.

1144
01:19:37,693 --> 01:19:40,025
Pieces of Sand.

1145
01:19:43,165 --> 01:19:44,632
Pieces.

1146
01:19:44,834 --> 01:19:46,597
Pieces of Octopus.

1147
01:19:46,802 --> 01:19:48,633
You son of a bitch,  Octopus.
You're mine.

1148
01:19:48,838 --> 01:19:50,032
Always with The Octopus.

1149
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,673
- Excuse me,  but wasn't he,  like- - ?
- Not right now.

1150
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,776
But three hours with no vitals.
Shouldn't he ought to be dead?

1151
01:19:55,978 --> 01:19:57,172
lt's a long story.

1152
01:19:57,379 --> 01:20:00,075
Somebody get me a tie.
And it sure as hell better be red.

1153
01:20:00,282 --> 01:20:02,682
- This time,  you better know your place.
- Hold on.

1154
01:20:02,885 --> 01:20:05,183
You're supposed to be my spy,
not some vigilante.

1155
01:20:05,387 --> 01:20:08,652
lf you go all cowboy on me again,
l am gonna blast you in half myself.

1156
01:20:08,858 --> 01:20:10,849
- You got that?
- l got an idea.

1157
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:14,094
- l'm atwitter.
- No,  it's good.

1158
01:20:14,296 --> 01:20:15,524
l promise.

1159
01:20:21,303 --> 01:20:25,069
Hey,  you keep that thing pointed
at The Octopus.

1160
01:20:25,274 --> 01:20:27,469
When l give you the word,
you blow his head off.

1161
01:20:27,676 --> 01:20:30,372
Then it's on with our wedding night,
huh,  baby?

1162
01:20:30,579 --> 01:20:33,309
Yeah,  baby. Our wedding night.

1163
01:21:26,402 --> 01:21:28,131
Who the hell are you?

1164
01:21:28,337 --> 01:21:31,568
- You The Octopus' girlfriend?
- Oh,  no,  it's not like that.

1165
01:21:32,608 --> 01:21:34,371
- l mean,  this is fun for me.
- Fun?

1166
01:21:34,577 --> 01:21:37,102
We show up here,
we look fabulous doing it...

1167
01:21:37,313 --> 01:21:38,940
...we swap things,  then we leave.

1168
01:21:39,148 --> 01:21:42,345
- You're looking to get yourself killed.
- Would you lighten up?

1169
01:21:42,551 --> 01:21:44,280
- Should we start shooting?
- Don't know.

1170
01:21:44,486 --> 01:21:46,454
- No shooting.
- No shooting,  you polyp.

1171
01:21:46,856 --> 01:21:49,017
No sign of The Octopus.

1172
01:21:49,225 --> 01:21:51,887
Hell of a waste of time
if he didn't show up.

1173
01:21:52,094 --> 01:21:56,588
Whenever he does,  sir,
we are locked and loaded.

1174
01:21:56,799 --> 01:21:58,767
That cannon could take out the moon,
rookie.

1175
01:21:59,068 --> 01:22:00,365
Sir,  l'm an excellent shot.

1176
01:22:00,569 --> 01:22:02,833
ls every goddamn woman
in this goddamn hellhole...

1177
01:22:03,038 --> 01:22:06,735
- ...out of her goddamn mind?
- No,  sir,  we're just equipped.

1178
01:22:06,942 --> 01:22:08,807
Sweetie,  he's just using you.

1179
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:13,311
Sure he is. l run a very lucrative
operation and l'm great eye candy.

1180
01:22:13,515 --> 01:22:15,949
l walk away,
l have my Ph.D. all paid for.

1181
01:22:16,151 --> 01:22:18,517
Fine. Tell lug nuts over there
to give me the box.

1182
01:22:18,721 --> 01:22:21,189
And you,  you start that walking.

1183
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:24,018
As far away from that animal
as you possibly can.

1184
01:22:24,226 --> 01:22:27,593
He will kill you. He kills everything.

1185
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:32,524
All right,  fine. l just think you're taking
this way too seriously,  that's all.

1186
01:23:12,107 --> 01:23:14,041
Give them the vase.

1187
01:23:22,351 --> 01:23:24,216
Boss said l start shooting now.

1188
01:23:28,924 --> 01:23:30,585
Get in the truck.

1189
01:23:34,296 --> 01:23:35,888
Nobody goes anywhere.

1190
01:23:37,299 --> 01:23:38,596
Floss...

1191
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:40,462
...fetch me that vase,  please.

1192
01:23:40,669 --> 01:23:41,693
Get in the truck.

1193
01:23:42,137 --> 01:23:45,766
Give me the blood of Heracles,  now.

1194
01:23:45,975 --> 01:23:47,237
Walk.

1195
01:23:47,443 --> 01:23:48,501
Heracles?

1196
01:23:50,913 --> 01:23:53,245
l always thought it was ''Hercules.''

1197
01:23:54,516 --> 01:23:56,143
You.

1198
01:24:16,572 --> 01:24:19,700
Sand,  you found your armor.

1199
01:24:19,908 --> 01:24:21,205
Use it.

1200
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:22,775
What is it with you and women?

1201
01:24:26,648 --> 01:24:28,479
Octopus...

1202
01:24:28,684 --> 01:24:30,447
...you were right.

1203
01:24:30,652 --> 01:24:32,244
We're mistakes.

1204
01:24:32,454 --> 01:24:34,046
We never should have happened.

1205
01:24:46,368 --> 01:24:48,336
- Sir,  this is crazy.
- Hold your horses.

1206
01:24:48,537 --> 01:24:50,835
He doesn't want any cops
getting killed.

1207
01:24:55,077 --> 01:24:57,671
You're not making this easy.

1208
01:25:05,054 --> 01:25:06,180
Come on,  kid.

1209
01:25:16,231 --> 01:25:17,960
lt ends tonight.

1210
01:25:19,535 --> 01:25:20,797
You got that right.

1211
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:22,931
l'm The Octopus.

1212
01:25:23,138 --> 01:25:24,503
l got eight of everything.

1213
01:25:47,196 --> 01:25:49,289
There's shot to hell.

1214
01:25:49,498 --> 01:25:51,125
And shot to hell.

1215
01:25:51,867 --> 01:25:54,665
And there's just plain ridiculous.

1216
01:25:55,137 --> 01:25:56,934
Now.

1217
01:26:17,126 --> 01:26:18,684
You idiot,  Octopus.

1218
01:26:18,894 --> 01:26:22,386
All we needed was to flush you
and your gunsels out.

1219
01:26:26,435 --> 01:26:28,096
Move,  move.

1220
01:26:33,642 --> 01:26:35,041
Give it to him,  boys.

1221
01:27:36,171 --> 01:27:38,002
Commissioner Dolan,
your daughter's here.

1222
01:27:39,675 --> 01:27:40,937
We need more men over there.

1223
01:27:41,143 --> 01:27:43,907
- Baby,  you don't wanna be here.
- You're joking,  right,  Daddy?

1224
01:27:44,112 --> 01:27:46,842
Have you forgotten what l do
for a living? He might need me.

1225
01:27:47,049 --> 01:27:49,279
You'll be in his way,
he doesn't want you here.

1226
01:27:49,484 --> 01:27:50,644
You don't know that.

1227
01:27:50,852 --> 01:27:54,151
You don't know him.
You don't know a damn thing.

1228
01:27:54,356 --> 01:27:56,119
Stop her. Pull her back.

1229
01:27:56,491 --> 01:27:57,583
Yes,  sir.

1230
01:28:03,332 --> 01:28:05,163
Runny eggs.

1231
01:28:17,412 --> 01:28:19,903
Finally. Yes.

1232
01:28:20,115 --> 01:28:21,139
Yes.

1233
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:25,081
Yeah!

1234
01:28:34,429 --> 01:28:35,794
Wha- - ?

1235
01:28:41,503 --> 01:28:43,528
Nice investment,  Sand.

1236
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:45,331
Passes its first field test.

1237
01:28:52,914 --> 01:28:54,142
Let's die.

1238
01:29:04,526 --> 01:29:06,653
Oh,  God. Oh,  God,  no.

1239
01:29:07,529 --> 01:29:09,019
No. Oh,  God.

1240
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:12,530
Mother.

1241
01:29:39,928 --> 01:29:42,419
l guess it's time
to finally drop your armor,  Sand.

1242
01:29:46,868 --> 01:29:48,961
You lost something.

1243
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:55,141
Old man Kurtzman said
he'd take it back.

1244
01:30:00,615 --> 01:30:02,048
Well...

1245
01:30:03,051 --> 01:30:05,076
...maybe l'll wear it now and then.

1246
01:30:05,287 --> 01:30:07,551
But it doesn't mean l'm your girl.

1247
01:30:46,228 --> 01:30:48,992
Ellen. Ellen,  are you all right?

1248
01:31:19,227 --> 01:31:20,455
Goodbye,  Sand.

1249
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:23,693
Goodbye,  Denny.

1250
01:31:47,823 --> 01:31:49,620
Goodbye,  Spirit.

1251
01:31:53,195 --> 01:31:55,095
- ls that Saref?
- Give me this one,  Dolan.

1252
01:31:55,297 --> 01:31:56,525
Just let her go.

1253
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:59,427
She saved me.
She saved the world.

1254
01:31:59,634 --> 01:32:02,797
Yeah,  well,
you had something to do with it.

1255
01:32:03,004 --> 01:32:05,472
All right. All right.
Just stay out of my face.

1256
01:32:11,313 --> 01:32:13,907
So who the hell was that back there?
Who is she?

1257
01:32:14,115 --> 01:32:15,377
Just an old flame.

1258
01:32:15,584 --> 01:32:17,552
Yeah,  she looks old.

1259
01:32:17,752 --> 01:32:20,516
- lt's you l love,  baby. With all my heart.
- Yeah.

1260
01:32:20,722 --> 01:32:22,986
Me and every other woman
you meet.

1261
01:32:24,292 --> 01:32:26,760
You are amazing.

1262
01:32:26,962 --> 01:32:28,554
Neat work yourself,  rookie.

1263
01:32:30,999 --> 01:32:32,899
Bastard.

1264
01:32:57,759 --> 01:33:00,125
We start from scratch.

1265
01:33:09,404 --> 01:33:11,634
Who knows what l'll do?

1266
01:33:19,381 --> 01:33:22,578
She wakes. Grouchy as always.

1267
01:33:23,818 --> 01:33:25,786
Endlessly noisy.

1268
01:33:26,788 --> 01:33:29,154
Endlessly alive.

1269
01:33:30,125 --> 01:33:32,559
She's all I really have.

1270
01:33:33,194 --> 01:33:35,458
My only hope.

1271
01:33:36,264 --> 01:33:38,459
My only constant.

1272
01:33:40,201 --> 01:33:42,601
The secrets of The Octopus
died with him.

1273
01:33:45,307 --> 01:33:47,434
I don't know what I am
or how long I got.

1274
01:33:47,642 --> 01:33:49,837
Heck,  maybe I'll live forever.

1275
01:33:50,045 --> 01:33:51,569
I hope not.

1276
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:53,645
That's nothing any man
ought to have.

1277
01:33:53,848 --> 01:33:56,282
That's nothing any man
ought to want.

1278
01:33:56,651 --> 01:33:59,449
Denny Colt is dead.
I'm something else now...

1279
01:33:59,654 --> 01:34:02,589
...and I can never give my heart
to anyone but her.

1280
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:06,454
She will always be mine
and I will always be hers.

1281
01:34:06,661 --> 01:34:09,357
She owns me,  body and soul.

1282
01:34:09,564 --> 01:34:12,158
She is the love of my life.

1283
01:34:12,767 --> 01:34:15,031
She is my city.

1284
01:34:17,038 --> 01:34:18,835
And I...

1285
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:21,370
...am her Spirit.
