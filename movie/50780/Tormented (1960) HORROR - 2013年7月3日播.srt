00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,369
moonlight on the sea when the night wind

10
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,369



11
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,789

668
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,790

00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,690



675
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:44,660
simply a dream what a bride goes through

676
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,660



677
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:47,370

678
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,370



679
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,500
it took three fittings to get the bodice

680
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,500



681
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,410
right and three layers of mint to make

682
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,410



683
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,600
the skirt full enough well hardly seems

684
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,600



685
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:58,020
worth it after all I'm only marrying her

686
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,020

00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,430

see if there's a window open

690
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,200



691
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,200
there's a cold draft all of a sudden

692
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:17,019



693
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:25,879
that's what spell must be the fresh

694
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,879



695
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:29,490
roses my roses never smelled like that

696
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:29,490



697
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:32,220
it's a woman's perfume something they

698
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,220



699
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:34,230

704
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:37,950



705
00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:40,500
of them when we were married maybe

706
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,500



707
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,700
that's a reason for his attitude when he

708
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,700



709
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,079

00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,289

716
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:47,490

758
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,190

768
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:26,569



769
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:29,119

00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:30,619
and is playing tricks to get even now

772
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:30,619



773
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,320
where do you suppose a woman could hide

774
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:34,320



775
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:39,090
on this island who is hiding

00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:39,090

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:42,050
nevermind sandy things will work out

778
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,050

00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,050
you'll see

780
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:13,900



781
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:18,500
while people always say never mind

782
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,500



783
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,329
because there are some things that

784
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,329



785
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,819
grown-ups don't want children to know

786
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:22,819



787
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:24,640

788
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:24,640

00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:36,319



797
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:41,059
lighthouse is a very dangerous place

798
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:41,059



799
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:43,160

1262
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,470



1263
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:51,920
reflection of the moonlight on a loose

1264
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,920

00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:07,780

00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,610



1277
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:14,200
way you could correct it was for me to

1278
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:14,200

00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:16,720

00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:22,960
