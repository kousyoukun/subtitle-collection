00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,520
SEPTEMBER
九月

2
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:52,577
Thanks for the ride.
谢谢你载我

3
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:55,083
Get going. You don't have time for breakfast.
 走吧。     你没时间吃早饭了。

4
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:56,744
Are you working or what?
你的工作是什么？

5
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,119
Yeah, I'll be at the station all day,
so hitch a ride home.
是的，我在那站了一整天
所以搭车回家

6
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,648
- You got practice today?
- After that, man, we're on double time.
你今天有实践？
之后，男人，我们是在双重时间

7
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,924
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You'd think they'd take it down.
你该为自己感到羞耻.
你不会想他们把它记下来。

8
00:03:06,997 --> 00:03:10,558
Come on, bud.
You lost a football game once yourself.
来吧，巴德。
你失去了一个足球游戏曾经的自己

9
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:12,625
What? I don't remember.
干嘛？我不记得了。

10
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:14,693
I do.
我愿意。

11
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:16,705
I think you're lying.
我认为你在撒谎。

12
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:19,708
- I don't know when to believe your mouth.
- Likewise.
我不知道什么时候能相信你的话。
同样地。

13
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:26,881
- Later, bud. - See you, Jed.
-回头见，巴德 -回头见，杰德

14
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,078
- Did you do your history?
- Yeah. Some of it.

15
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:32,781
The Great Hunt would always begin...

16
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:35,984
with the armies spread out
in a semicircle...

17
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:39,119
I would say about
the size of Rhode Island.

18
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:41,494
Then they would ride forward...

19
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:44,659
driving everything before them:

20
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:48,864
beasts, men... even bugs.

21
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:55,141
Now the ends would kind of close
in to form a shrinking circle.

22
00:03:55,212 --> 00:03:58,773
And everything within that circle
panicked to get out.

23
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,716
When the Mongols could see each other...

24
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:05,551
they had worked themselves up
into a pretty good frenzy.

25
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:10,222
Now when this killing started...

26
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:14,059
it'd last for days, weeks...

27
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,927
even months.

28
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,162
And it went on...

29
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:23,229
until the young son of the Khan...

30
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:27,174
asked his father
that the last creature alive...

31
00:04:32,048 --> 00:04:34,881
be allowed to...

32
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:36,919
go free.

33
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:40,448
well now, my friend.

34
00:04:41,524 --> 00:04:43,958
- well, now.
- They're all over!

35
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:46,689
- Check it out.
- all right!

36
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:51,694
They look pretty cool, though.

37
00:04:51,768 --> 00:04:54,703
I would say they were
way off course.

38
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,571
This is very unusual.

39
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,475
Better do something, Mr. Teasdale.

40
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:23,999
What's going on, my friend?

41
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:50,717
Come on!
Let's go!

42
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,287
Get in!

43
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:27,193
Get down! Get down!

44
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:31,527
- Get in!
- Wait!

45
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:41,973
Run! Get in!

46
00:07:55,552 --> 00:07:57,349
Dad!

47
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,445
What's happening?
What's happening?

48
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:02,719
- They're shooting at everybody!
- Shooting?

49
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:09,296
- We're going to the mountains.
- Can you tell who they are?

50
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,856
I heard some of them
speaking Spanish, Mr. Morris.

51
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:14,233
Did you see any of them?

52
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,307
Oh, my God.

53
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:23,040
Boys...

54
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:26,549
get in there and get
sleeping bags and food right now.

55
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:28,948
Come on.
Hurry up, boys.

56
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:31,145
Come on, son.

57
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:34,987
- Take the dry stuff.
- Get the dehydrated stuff.

58
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:37,425
Get plenty of Kleenex.

59
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:39,826
- Get some lanterns.
- .38 Specials.

60
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:42,729
Grab some toilet paper.
I ain't gonna use no leaves.

61
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,858
Bring a lot of that.

62
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,696
Be sure to take
a lot of batteries.

63
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:54,603
Get a shotgun.

64
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:56,611
Get those down jackets.

65
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,107
Matt, look!

66
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:02,083
Get down! Get down!

67
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,482
Lay down.

68
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:12,627
Is it ours?

69
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,532
Son, I love you.

70
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,831
I love you, Dad.
Tell Mom I love her.

71
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:24,863
- I'll take care of him.
- Boys, just get out of here.

72
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,375
And don't come back here.

73
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,877
No matter what you see or hear,
don't come back.

74
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,380
I'll come and get you soon enough.

75
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:41,322
Open the glove compartment.

76
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,253
- Is it there?
- Yeah.

77
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,024
Load it.

78
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:54,730
- It's already loaded.
- Give it here.

79
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:59,565
- Want these also, Jed?
- Put them in my pocket.

80
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:08,316
Jesus Christ.

81
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:10,215
Oh, Jesus, Jesus.

82
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:12,916
I'm gonna turn off.

83
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,970
It's a helicopter!

84
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:47,685
It's ours!

85
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:51,787
Get in! Get in!

86
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,637
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

87
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,237
Only thing is, we got one problem.
We don't have any water.

88
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,282
How about pissing in it?

89
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:21,717
- That's a good idea.
- How do you know it'll work?

90
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,157
- How old are you, kid?
- Fifteen.

91
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:26,661
And the name's Danny, not " kid."

92
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:30,756
well, when you grow up,
you'll know these things, Danny.

93
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,597
Now get up here
and piss in the radiator.

94
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,693
We've got Yankee Tanks
coming in from the plains.

95
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,896
We've lost most of our night vision...

96
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:45,429
and have only a few
antitank missiles left.

97
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:49,501
Put your best men into hunter groups
armed with RPG's.

98
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:53,515
Have your men dig holes
100 meters apart.

99
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,984
Wait until the Yankees
approach to strike...

100
00:12:57,053 --> 00:13:02,958
then attack them in force.

101
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,458
Yes, Colonel Bella.

102
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:07,920
I want some antitank here.

103
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,329
We're working on it, sir.

104
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,301
This...this is a madhouse!

105
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:15,098
Do you want to see me?

106
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:19,574
Yes...yes.
Go to the sporting goods store.

107
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:24,011
From the files, obtain form 4473.

108
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,607
These will contain
descriptions of weapons...

109
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,151
and lists of private ownership.

110
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:40,885
But our families, huh?
What about them, huh?

111
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:44,994
We gotta stay up here
and hide awhile.

112
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:48,866
I just want to go home.

113
00:13:48,938 --> 00:13:52,203
I don't want to hide.
If I hide, they'll never find me.

114
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,239
Check it out.

115
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:03,217
Stopped a bullet
that would have hit somebody.

116
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,517
I got these.

117
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:10,423
Those will do us a lot of good.
We've got no radio.

118
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:13,326
How long do you think we can survive
on olives and Rice Krispies?

119
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:16,598
What else are we gonna do?

120
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:23,803
As Calumet Student Body President...

121
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:26,569
I forward the motion
that we give ourselves up.

122
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:28,667
I second the motion.

123
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,939
We can't stay here.
We need stuff and--

124
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:32,241
Sit down, Danny.

125
00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:38,384
It's too dangerous
to go into town.

126
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:41,321
- I say we vote on it.
- No.

127
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,190
It isn't the big game, Mr. Quarterback.
He can go wherever he wants.

128
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:48,488
You're such a goddamn jock.

129
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:53,301
Come on, guys!
Knock it off!

130
00:14:56,305 --> 00:14:59,365
If you want to go so bad,
take your shit!

131
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:02,501
That goes for the rest of you.

132
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:05,580
Get walking.

133
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:09,211
It's World War III down there.

134
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:12,152
People are being killed.

135
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:16,424
Those could be Russians.

136
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,157
Jed, what about your family?

137
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:30,999
I don't know.

138
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:33,371
But I'm alive.

139
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:38,141
And I'm staying here.
My family would want me to stay alive.

140
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:40,774
Your family would
want you to stay alive.

141
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:46,886
You think you're so smart, man,
but you're just a bunch of scared kids.

142
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:52,751
What do you think you are?

143
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:57,027
Alone, I guess.

144
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:00,696
No, you're not.

145
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:04,972
Hey, bud.

146
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,841
What do you say?

147
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:24,959
I'm with you.

148
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:32,158
Now the rest of you get going.

149
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:41,409
all right, but if you stay...

150
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:44,446
you're gonna do
exactly what I say, okay?

151
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,349
So come on over here
and get warm.

152
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:54,517
Daryl.

153
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,401
I'm sorry.

154
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,836
Me too, man.

155
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:23,074
Matt and I have been coming up to these
mountains with our dad our whole lives.

156
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:27,486
We can hunt, we can fish.
We can stay up here a long, long time.

157
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,392
How long, Jed?

158
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:37,795
Until we don't hear that no more.

159
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:40,930
OCTOBER

160
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,873
I got him!

161
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:57,214
You got him.

162
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:06,421
He's still breathing!

163
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:09,760
Never shoot twice.
If you shoot twice, they can find you.

164
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,833
- He's dead anyway.
- How do you know?

165
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:22,638
I used to read a lot about
Jedediah Smith and Jim Bridger.

166
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:27,778
The Blackfeet, if you shot twice,
would know right where you were.

167
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:30,881
My dad named me after Jed Smith.

168
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,424
This is your first time, isn't it?

169
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:39,427
Yeah. Why?

170
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:42,430
You gotta drink if it's your first.
We did.

171
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:45,466
What's it taste like?

172
00:18:45,534 --> 00:18:47,559
It's not too bad.

173
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:51,037
It's kind of salty, like a steak
or when you get a nosebleed.

174
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:53,974
You gotta do it, Robert.
It's the spirit of the deer.

175
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:01,712
When you drink it,
you'll be a real hunter.

176
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:07,884
Bottoms up.

177
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:12,454
Go. Go ahead.

178
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:19,293
Go for it, buddy.

179
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,562
All right! All right!

180
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:26,040
You did it.

181
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,637
His blood is yours.
My dad said that once you do that...

182
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:34,649
there's gonna be something
different about you... always.

183
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:38,820
It wasn't so bad.

184
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,160
It wasn't that bad.

185
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:51,196
It wasn't so bad.

186
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,734
That's the last of it,
except for the olives.

187
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:04,370
We still got
plenty of meat left.

188
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:05,913
Just stuff you shot.

189
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:08,950
So tell me, dork, where do you suppose
hamburgers come from?

190
00:20:09,018 --> 00:20:10,508
Nobody shoots them.

191
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,247
We need food.

192
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:15,556
We need to know.

193
00:20:18,928 --> 00:20:20,190
We do.

194
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,702
We'll go into town.

195
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:59,463
There's no one here, either.

196
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:04,329
Looks like it's been here
for a thousand years.

197
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:12,505
Come on.

198
00:21:25,094 --> 00:21:27,119
The stores are open.

199
00:21:27,196 --> 00:21:29,460
There's people everywhere!
Maybe it's over!

200
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,600
- Don't go anywhere.
- Those aren't our troops.

201
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,160
You can't tell from here, Jed.

202
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:41,609
What is that? I've never seen
a tank like that before.

203
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:44,669
Yeah, but they're packed.
That means something.

204
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:48,877
Let's stash our stuff.
Leave it all here.

205
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:56,181
That's the Mayor's car.

206
00:21:56,258 --> 00:22:00,388
- They got Daryl's dad's car.
- Look at the size of that tank.

207
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:09,363
Lewis. Lewis, how you doing?

208
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:15,603
Was he scared of us?

209
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:36,356
Hey, let's ask Alicia.
She'll know.

210
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:49,867
Six toothbrushes, please.

211
00:22:51,947 --> 00:22:54,381
- Jed!
- How's your sister?

212
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,351
- Where did you come from?
- We've been hiding in the mountains.

213
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,944
Are you crazy?
You gotta get out of here.

214
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:03,822
We will, but first we gotta
find out what's going--

215
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:11,564
They know who all of you are.
They're looking for you.

216
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:13,692
- Who?
- The KGB.

217
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,169
- The Russians?
- And the Cubans.

218
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:21,139
Look, have you seen my father?

219
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,145
I called, there was no answer.
The station was empty.

220
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,242
Okay, listen.

221
00:23:28,317 --> 00:23:31,946
I'm gonna tell you something
nobody's supposed to talk about, but--

222
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:33,010
But what?

223
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:38,057
But they took a lot of people away,
people they thought would make trouble.

224
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:41,119
people who had guns or things
they wanted, they just took them away.

225
00:23:41,196 --> 00:23:42,094
Where?

226
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:45,759
Reeducation camps.
That's what they call it.

227
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:49,133
The drive-in.
I heard they took a lot of people to--

228
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:52,707
I pray for you.

229
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:56,341
America is a whorehouse...

230
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:59,347
where the revolutionary ideals
of your forefathers...

231
00:23:59,415 --> 00:24:04,011
are corrupted and sold in alleys
by vendors of capitalism.

232
00:24:33,282 --> 00:24:35,978
Could you find my dad, Tom Eckert?
I'm Jed.

233
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:38,315
Jed? Matt?

234
00:24:38,387 --> 00:24:39,820
Mr. Barnes?

235
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:43,817
I'll go find your dad.
I know right where he is.

236
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:48,528
You know Morris' Market
out on the highway?

237
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:50,690
Can you see if Mr. Morris
is in there too?

238
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:53,200
I'll look around for him too, son.

239
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:13,448
Daddy?

240
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:19,427
I can stand up.

241
00:25:19,495 --> 00:25:20,757
Boys.

242
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:34,740
Don't talk. Don't say anything.
Let me look at you.

243
00:25:36,211 --> 00:25:40,614
well, I knew I was right.
I knew it.

244
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:42,616
You're alive.

245
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,653
I was tough on both of you.

246
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:50,584
And I did things that made you--

247
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:52,593
that made you hate me sometimes.

248
00:25:53,996 --> 00:25:56,055
But you understand now,
don't you?

249
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:01,331
What happened, Dad?
Why are you here? What did they do?

250
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:04,572
It doesn't matter.

251
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,375
One way or another...

252
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,136
for one reason or another,
we're all gone.

253
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:14,944
It's all gone.

254
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,152
Remember...

255
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:23,958
remember when you used to go
in the park and play...

256
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:28,324
and I used to
put you on the swings...

257
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:30,729
and both of you were...

258
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,360
so damn little?

259
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:42,308
I remember.
I remember all of it.

260
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:45,278
I ain't gonna be around
to pick you up when you fall now.

261
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:47,679
Both of you got to
take care of each other now.

262
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:52,280
We'll never see you again, Dad.

263
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:54,879
Yes, you will.
I don't want to hear that, Mattie.

264
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:58,988
What happened to Mom, Dad?
Where is she?

265
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:10,905
We can't afford
to be crying anymore.

266
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:16,243
I don't want either one of you
to ever cry for me again.

267
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:21,715
Don't ever do it
not as long as you live.

268
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:24,485
Where's my dad, Mr. Eckert?

269
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:28,985
I don't know, son.

270
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:31,491
I don't know.

271
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:36,359
You all get going now.

272
00:27:37,432 --> 00:27:39,059
Get out before they find you.

273
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:48,766
I love you.

274
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,680
I know you do, son.
I love you too.

275
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:12,365
Boys!

276
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:16,501
Avenge me!

277
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:42,759
I'll be damned.
Get in here.

278
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:45,766
Mr. Mason, how are you doing?
Good to see you.

279
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,369
We got us some outlaws here.

280
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,773
Wow, a house.

281
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:58,642
Go on and find a chair.

282
00:28:58,714 --> 00:29:01,649
Last time we were in a house
was five weeks.

283
00:29:01,717 --> 00:29:03,150
You look it.

284
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,549
Who you got out there with you?

285
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,957
We got Danny, we got Daryl.

286
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:18,094
We all figured you boys
had headed for F.A. by now.

287
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,360
What's F.A.?

288
00:29:19,434 --> 00:29:21,664
Free America.
That's the safe zone.

289
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:22,795
Where are we?

290
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:27,035
Hell, you boys is in
occupied territory.

291
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:29,373
You're 40 miles
behind the enemy lines.

292
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:32,607
Right smack dab
in the middle of World War III.

293
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:39,614
What are you boys doing
fooling around town anyway?

294
00:29:39,688 --> 00:29:42,156
We've been looking for news,
Mr. Mason.

295
00:29:42,224 --> 00:29:45,785
We haven't even seen or talked
to anybody since it all started.

296
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:48,729
Wait here just a minute.

297
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,200
I wish there was more.

298
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:57,363
I'm sorry.

299
00:29:57,439 --> 00:30:00,033
Thank you, Mrs. Mason.
We really appreciate it.

300
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:08,849
This'll keep you boys warm.

301
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:12,245
Use this to see
where you're standing.

302
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:17,248
A radio?
We can't take this.

303
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,788
That's all right.
I got another one.

304
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,524
You boys listen to me.

305
00:30:23,598 --> 00:30:27,432
- Don't go to Calumet no more.
- How come?

306
00:30:27,502 --> 00:30:30,938
Because there's been
some attacks up there.

307
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:34,567
people waking up
with their throats cut.

308
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:37,903
Word has it, it's you.

309
00:30:46,288 --> 00:30:48,722
What happened to my dad and mom?

310
00:30:50,325 --> 00:30:52,122
Your daddy's dead, Robert.

311
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:55,262
They shot him.

312
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:59,099
Russians found some guns missing...

313
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,102
so they shot him
for aiding guerrillas.

314
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:07,201
What do you mean, aiding guerrillas?
He never aided anybody.

315
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:10,403
- We took the stuff!
- We killed him!

316
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:12,447
They killed him, son.

317
00:31:12,514 --> 00:31:15,312
Made him an example.

318
00:31:15,383 --> 00:31:18,910
Now you boys listen to me
and let that burn in real good.

319
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:23,223
I don't know where
your mother is, Robert.

320
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,758
I got nobody now.

321
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:28,785
If you boys need food, a bed,
anything, you come here.

322
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:38,328
I got a couple of heirlooms
I want to hide with you.

323
00:31:38,406 --> 00:31:39,839
Jack, no.

324
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:49,744
My granddaughters.

325
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:52,946
They spent two days
sneaking here.

326
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:56,615
Those sons-of-bitches
tried having their way with them.

327
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:02,427
Toni...

328
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:04,260
Erica.

329
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:07,460
This is Matt and Jed Eckert.
They're gonna take care of you.

330
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:12,265
And I don't wanna know
where they're going.

331
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:15,100
Bye, Grandpa.

332
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,950
Good luck, son.

333
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:37,556
Here. Here's a box of ammo
for your granddaddy's pistol.

334
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,793
- Thanks.
- Good luck to you.

335
00:32:39,868 --> 00:32:42,393
I'll take care of them.
Don't worry.

336
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:57,980
It's 11:59 at Radio Free America.

337
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:00,749
This is Uncle Sam with
music and the truth until dawn.

338
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:03,484
We've got a few words for some
of our brothers and sisters...

339
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:05,549
in the occupied zone.

340
00:33:05,627 --> 00:33:09,028
The chair is against the wall.
The chair is against the wall.

341
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:13,124
John has a long mustache.
John has a long mustache.

342
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,726
It's 12:00,
another day closer to victory.

343
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:18,898
For all of you out there
on or behind the lines...

344
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:21,204
this is your song.

345
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,159
Things are different now.

346
00:34:08,223 --> 00:34:10,157
They're coming up.

347
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,028
Let's go tell the others.

348
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:31,678
Oh, how beautiful.

349
00:34:43,758 --> 00:34:45,919
What is written here?

350
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:50,022
You studied English. Translate.

351
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:53,834
American history...
I know this well.

352
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,672
Arapaho National Battlefield.

353
00:35:00,742 --> 00:35:03,939
Here was a great peasant uprising...

354
00:35:04,012 --> 00:35:08,472
in 1908 of wild Indians.

355
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:12,418
They were crushed by
President Theodore Roosevelt...

356
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:17,550
leading imperialist armies
and cowboys.

357
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:22,460
The battle lasted all winter.
More than 35,000 were killed.

358
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,967
It was the greatest battle
of the American West.

359
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:28,969
Bravo!

360
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:32,200
Yuri, stay here.
I'll take a photo of you.

361
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,169
African baboon.

362
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:41,981
Now you.

363
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:46,086
Come here, my friend.

364
00:35:49,924 --> 00:35:51,983
Hurry up, you fool.

365
00:36:04,005 --> 00:36:05,939
Look at me, Yuri.

366
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:15,475
Look. Look what I've found.
An arrow.

367
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,313
An Indian arrow.

368
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:20,013
What a philosopher you are.

369
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:22,556
I did not know
the Indians used steel.

370
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:26,287
Sure, you fool. They used the melted
sabers of Federalist Cossacks.

371
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:30,354
Did these Indians
work in plastic, too?

372
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:34,231
You idiot. This is bone,
polished to a high sheen.

373
00:36:34,302 --> 00:36:36,395
There must be more.

374
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:41,267
Look.

375
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:48,712
Watch out! She has a weapon.

376
00:36:50,118 --> 00:36:52,052
Stop, damn it!

377
00:36:57,058 --> 00:36:58,650
Quickly, catch him!

378
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:08,234
Take cover!

379
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:11,904
Stop!

380
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:21,382
Help me, comrades.

381
00:37:23,051 --> 00:37:24,951
Grab him!

382
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:26,850
I got him!

383
00:37:27,856 --> 00:37:28,845
I'm dying.

384
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:31,575
God help me!

385
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:33,314
God help me!

386
00:39:15,697 --> 00:39:17,130
They were people.

387
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:19,496
Yeah, well, so was my dad.

388
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:23,203
What was it like?

389
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,269
It was good.

390
00:39:31,846 --> 00:39:34,212
One thing is for sure now.

391
00:39:35,283 --> 00:39:37,581
No one can ever
go home again.

392
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:39,551
Never.

393
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:45,955
Why don't you
make yourself useful?

394
00:39:46,027 --> 00:39:48,018
You wash it!

395
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:52,396
We ain't never doing your washing again.
Me and her is as good as any of you.

396
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:53,900
So what's up your ass?

397
00:39:53,968 --> 00:39:55,697
Shut up!

398
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:59,638
Don't you ever say that again!

399
00:39:59,707 --> 00:40:02,335
Hear me?
You say that again, I'll kill you.

400
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,173
Hear me?

401
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:05,837
I'll kill you.

402
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:11,717
So what did I do?

403
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:14,186
What you said was wrong.

404
00:40:58,032 --> 00:41:00,660
From now on...

405
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:06,067
all troops
are forbidden to travel...

406
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,439
outside secured areas...

407
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,139
in any group
smaller than squad size.

408
00:41:14,582 --> 00:41:16,675
Then call Bratchenko.

409
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:22,849
Tell him Sector Eight is now active.

410
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:24,551
Right away, Colonel Bella.

411
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:27,788
And I want some interrogations made...

412
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:30,092
starting with the Mayor.

413
00:41:31,232 --> 00:41:34,963
I'm sick of his...pleasantries.

414
00:41:35,036 --> 00:41:37,027
Consider it done.

415
00:41:39,107 --> 00:41:41,940
Daryl, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

416
00:41:42,009 --> 00:41:44,102
I know my son, Colonel.

417
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:46,408
He's not the guerrilla type.

418
00:41:46,481 --> 00:41:48,472
According to records, Mayor...

419
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:52,542
your son is a prominent
student leader.

420
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:57,057
Ahh, yes, well, he's a leader,
but not in a violent or physical way.

421
00:41:57,125 --> 00:42:01,687
No, you see, Daryl, he's more of
a politician, like his father.

422
00:42:03,764 --> 00:42:07,325
A member of an elite
paramilitary organization:

423
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,834
Eagle Scout.

424
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:11,804
Yes, but that's not military.

425
00:42:11,873 --> 00:42:14,535
If he's alive,
he's scared, he's hungry...

426
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:17,237
and he's just as anxious
to avoid conflicts as you and me.

427
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:18,744
He's not a troublemaker.

428
00:42:18,813 --> 00:42:20,110
Then who is?

429
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:26,953
Well, let's just say
it runs in some of the families.

430
00:42:29,357 --> 00:42:32,884
This community is indeed fortunate
to have a shepherd like him.

431
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:41,764
well, I just want to see
this thing through, Colonel.

432
00:42:41,836 --> 00:42:44,634
If you have any more problems,
you call me--

433
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:45,603
Thank you.

434
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:49,705
We're finished...

435
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:52,378
for now.

436
00:44:31,646 --> 00:44:34,581
Oh, beautiful

437
00:44:34,649 --> 00:44:37,140
For spacious skies

438
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:41,314
For amber waves of grain

439
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:46,725
For purple mountains majesty

440
00:44:46,794 --> 00:44:51,026
Above the fruited plain

441
00:44:51,098 --> 00:44:53,362
America--

442
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:33,073
Don't cry!

443
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,074
Hold it back!

444
00:45:38,112 --> 00:45:40,376
Let it turn to something else.

445
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:45,852
Just let it turn to
something else, okay?

446
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,294
Listen to me. Listen.

447
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:59,297
Don't you ever cry again
as long as you live.

448
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:01,665
As long as you live,
never do it.

449
00:46:01,736 --> 00:46:03,328
Do you hear me?

450
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:15,672
They're gonna kill us!

451
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,513
All of us!

452
00:46:17,585 --> 00:46:20,179
So why should we be different?

453
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,656
Let it turn to
something else, Mattie.

454
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:31,254
Let it turn.
Let it turn.

455
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:02,252
Take gasoline.

456
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:11,796
Hey, girl,
what are you doing here?

457
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:14,466
Hey, beautiful,
where are you going?

458
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:18,544
Forget the broad,
just get her stuff.

459
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,911
Where are you going?

460
00:47:24,985 --> 00:47:28,443
You're so beautiful.
Wait, what's wrong with you?

461
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:40,099
Let's get her!

462
00:48:03,491 --> 00:48:05,288
Run! This way!

463
00:48:43,163 --> 00:48:44,926
Wolverines!

464
00:48:48,602 --> 00:48:50,695
It's cut...it's cut!

465
00:49:50,898 --> 00:49:50,965
I've seen this before.

466
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,399
I've seen this before.

467
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:56,895
Nicaragua, San Salvador...

468
00:49:56,971 --> 00:50:01,135
Cambodia, Angola, and Mexico.

469
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:04,707
But these are my men!

470
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:21,083
Miss, maybe you speak at me
for a minute.

471
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:24,858
- I'll be right back, okay?
- You bring girlfriend?

472
00:50:24,932 --> 00:50:27,628
Okay, I be right here. Bye.

473
00:50:29,436 --> 00:50:31,597
What is a " Wolverine" ?

474
00:50:31,672 --> 00:50:37,110
A small animal...like a badger,
but terribly ferocious.

475
00:50:37,177 --> 00:50:41,944
It is also the name of the local
school sports collective.

476
00:50:42,016 --> 00:50:43,745
They're beasts, Ernesto.

477
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:47,844
You must kill
every one of them eventually.

478
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:51,516
It's the same as Afghanistan.

479
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:53,992
They'll never stop.

480
00:50:54,061 --> 00:50:59,089
Look...I was always
on the side of the insurgents.

481
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:01,828
I have no experience
in these matters.

482
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:06,737
But it would seem necessary
to win the support of the people.

483
00:51:06,807 --> 00:51:10,743
As our opponents
used to say in Vietnam:

484
00:51:10,811 --> 00:51:13,837
"Win their hearts and minds."

485
00:51:13,914 --> 00:51:16,280
And they lost, Ernesto.

486
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,113
Of course, General.

487
00:51:18,185 --> 00:51:22,315
Things are paralyzed
at the front, Ernesto.

488
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:25,620
Morale is crucial right now.

489
00:51:25,693 --> 00:51:28,560
Keep the men in the secured areas.

490
00:51:28,629 --> 00:51:32,531
You'll see how they forget
about these "Wolverines."

491
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:37,564
Are you all right?

492
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:43,404
- You were saying, comrade?
- Shut up!

493
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,157
What's going on here?!

494
00:52:04,598 --> 00:52:07,294
NOVEMBER

495
00:53:18,672 --> 00:53:20,435
You American?

496
00:53:22,743 --> 00:53:24,370
Red-blooded.

497
00:53:24,444 --> 00:53:27,379
Yeah, well,
what's the capital of Texas?

498
00:53:28,182 --> 00:53:29,171
Austin.

499
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:31,615
Wrong, commie!
It's Houston!

500
00:53:31,685 --> 00:53:34,882
Please, darling.
I'm cold.

501
00:53:36,924 --> 00:53:39,188
You've seen too many movies.

502
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,961
Well, are you hungry?

503
00:53:50,537 --> 00:53:51,970
I could eat, yeah.

504
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:54,303
What kind of plane you fly?

505
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:58,073
well, I did fly an F-15.

506
00:54:04,418 --> 00:54:06,352
I'm an Eagle driver.

507
00:54:12,426 --> 00:54:14,621
Here, take this.

508
00:54:14,695 --> 00:54:17,755
I got this off
a dead Russian major.

509
00:54:18,498 --> 00:54:20,432
Major, huh?

510
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:23,899
Well, I guess
it oughta fit on a colonel.

511
00:54:31,678 --> 00:54:34,112
You the honcho, sport?

512
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:36,206
Who are you?

513
00:54:36,283 --> 00:54:39,013
Andrew Tanner,
Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Air Force.

514
00:54:39,086 --> 00:54:41,350
How'd you get yourself
shot down, Colonel?

515
00:54:41,421 --> 00:54:43,946
It was five to one.
I got four.

516
00:54:48,695 --> 00:54:51,926
- I'm Jed.
- How you doing, Jed?

517
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:53,933
Good as can be.

518
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:10,240
West coast... east coast.

519
00:55:10,317 --> 00:55:12,251
Down here is Mexico.

520
00:55:13,387 --> 00:55:15,378
The first wave of the attack...

521
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:19,755
came in disguised as commercial charter
flights, like Afghanistan in '80.

522
00:55:19,826 --> 00:55:22,556
only they were
crack airborne outfits.

523
00:55:22,629 --> 00:55:25,530
They took these passes
in the Rockies.

524
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,362
So that's what hit Calumet.

525
00:55:27,434 --> 00:55:29,299
I guess so.

526
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:33,032
They coordinated with nuke strikes,
using surprisingly accurate missiles.

527
00:55:33,106 --> 00:55:36,872
They took out the silos in the Dakotas
and key points of communication.

528
00:55:36,944 --> 00:55:38,605
Like what?

529
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:42,342
Oh, like Omaha, Washington,
Kansas City.

530
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:43,348
Gone?

531
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:45,351
Yeah, that's right.

532
00:55:45,419 --> 00:55:49,150
Infiltrators came up illegal
from Mexico.

533
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:50,814
Cubans, mostly.

534
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:52,654
They managed to infiltrate...

535
00:55:52,726 --> 00:55:55,524
SAC bases in the midwest,
several down in Texas...

536
00:55:55,595 --> 00:55:58,155
and wreaked a hell of a lot of havoc,
I'm here to tell you.

537
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:01,496
They opened up the door down here...

538
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:03,934
and the whole Cuban
and Nicaraguan armies...

539
00:56:04,004 --> 00:56:06,302
come walking right through...

540
00:56:06,373 --> 00:56:08,739
rolled right up here
through the Great Plains.

541
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:10,572
How far did they get?

542
00:56:10,644 --> 00:56:12,669
Cheyenne...

543
00:56:12,746 --> 00:56:15,146
across to Kansas.

544
00:56:15,215 --> 00:56:18,673
We held them at the Rockies
and at the Mississippi.

545
00:56:18,752 --> 00:56:23,018
Anyway, the Russians reinforced
with 60 divisions.

546
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:26,719
Sent three whole army groups
across the Bering Strait into Alaska...

547
00:56:26,793 --> 00:56:29,091
cut the pipeline,
came across Canada...

548
00:56:29,162 --> 00:56:32,598
to link up here in the middle,
but we stopped their butt cold.

549
00:56:36,903 --> 00:56:40,532
The lines have
pretty much stabilized now.

550
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:43,308
What about Europe?

551
00:56:43,377 --> 00:56:45,470
I guess they figured...

552
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,314
twice in one century was enough.

553
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,047
They're sitting this one out.
all except England.

554
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:01,484
And they won't last very long.

555
00:57:01,561 --> 00:57:05,463
The Russians need to take us in one
piece, and that's why they're here now.

556
00:57:05,532 --> 00:57:08,558
That's why they won't use nukes anymore
and we won't either.

557
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:11,604
The whole damn thing's
pretty conventional now.

558
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:16,766
Who knows?
Maybe next week will be swords.

559
00:57:16,843 --> 00:57:18,504
What started it?

560
00:57:18,578 --> 00:57:22,844
I don't know.
Two toughest kids on the block, I guess.

561
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:24,850
Sooner or later,
they're gonna fight.

562
00:57:24,918 --> 00:57:26,909
That simple?

563
00:57:29,256 --> 00:57:31,690
Maybe somebody just
forgot what it was like.

564
00:57:33,226 --> 00:57:35,160
Well, who is on our side?

565
00:57:36,763 --> 00:57:39,163
Six hundred million
screaming Chinamen.

566
00:57:39,232 --> 00:57:42,360
Last I heard, there were
a billion screaming Chinamen.

567
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:44,832
There were.

568
00:57:50,911 --> 00:57:52,344
You got a family?

569
00:57:57,084 --> 00:57:58,711
I don't know.

570
00:58:01,555 --> 00:58:05,082
They got caught
behind the lines down in Texas.

571
00:58:07,461 --> 00:58:10,430
I'd like to think
they're alive, but...

572
00:58:10,497 --> 00:58:13,432
I hear stories about
what they're doing to civilians.

573
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:21,197
Colonel, get up.

574
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:24,510
We're gonna go shoot up
an armored column.

575
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,344
Let's go.
The early bird gets the worm.

576
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:44,864
Early bird gets the worm.

577
00:59:13,326 --> 00:59:15,453
Watch those claymores in the trees.

578
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:27,300
Matt, RPG!

579
00:59:39,819 --> 00:59:42,845
What do you think?
Not bad for a bunch of kids, huh?

580
00:59:44,524 --> 00:59:46,651
Your mom would be real proud.

581
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:57,102
You think you're tough
for eating beans every day?

582
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:01,129
The scarecrows in Denver would give
anything for a taste of what you got.

583
01:00:03,043 --> 01:00:05,978
They've been under siege
for about three months.

584
01:00:07,314 --> 01:00:10,806
They live off rats
and sawdust bread and sometimes...

585
01:00:10,884 --> 01:00:12,852
on each other.

586
01:00:16,523 --> 01:00:19,185
At night, the...

587
01:00:19,259 --> 01:00:21,557
pyres for the dead
light up the sky.

588
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:26,165
It's medieval.

589
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,154
All that hate's
gonna burn you up.

590
01:00:50,657 --> 01:00:52,591
It keeps me warm.

591
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:06,939
Are we doing right?

592
01:01:55,989 --> 01:01:58,014
You made a new friend.

593
01:02:02,729 --> 01:02:04,663
She doesn't say much, does she?

594
01:02:08,134 --> 01:02:10,068
Something happened to her.

595
01:02:17,744 --> 01:02:20,406
DECEMBER

596
01:02:30,123 --> 01:02:32,853
All right.
Plane, plane, plane, plane.

597
01:02:32,926 --> 01:02:37,363
Cuban bunker, Russian bunker,
munitions dump, troop tents.

598
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,593
Machine gun bunkers
here, here, here and here.

599
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:44,330
Back here by the drive-in screen
are your political prisoners.

600
01:02:44,404 --> 01:02:46,429
We'll cause a diversion over here...

601
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:50,602
cut holes in the wire here,
fire on all these machine gun positions.

602
01:02:50,677 --> 01:02:54,511
The B Group comes across this area
in a flanking maneuver...

603
01:02:54,581 --> 01:02:58,847
and when you reach this bunker, you
lay down grazing fire in this defilade.

604
01:02:59,753 --> 01:03:02,313
I think that's pretty simple.

605
01:03:02,389 --> 01:03:04,084
Anybody got any questions so far?

606
01:03:04,157 --> 01:03:05,988
What's a flank?

607
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:08,050
A duffle-A?

608
01:03:09,129 --> 01:03:12,394
- What's grazing fire?
- I need a drink.

609
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:15,361
Step into the line--

610
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:35,014
Help...the "Wolverines" are attacking.

611
01:03:35,088 --> 01:03:36,521
Follow me...quickly.

612
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:41,226
Wolverines!

613
01:04:08,087 --> 01:04:10,055
Come on! Here's your chance!

614
01:04:10,123 --> 01:04:13,058
We're all gonna die!
Die standing up!

615
01:04:25,138 --> 01:04:26,400
Grenade!

616
01:05:05,011 --> 01:05:07,673
Children did this.

617
01:05:07,747 --> 01:05:09,271
It's rebels.

618
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:12,409
What rebels? They're bandits.

619
01:05:15,788 --> 01:05:18,916
Every time they shoot,
the revolution grows.

620
01:05:18,992 --> 01:05:21,688
I know. I was a partisan.

621
01:05:22,462 --> 01:05:25,556
And what are you now?

622
01:05:27,267 --> 01:05:29,201
Now I'm like you...

623
01:05:30,436 --> 01:05:32,199
a policeman.

624
01:05:38,278 --> 01:05:39,802
All right, Colonel!

625
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:48,246
And he's down.
Great play by Matt Eckert.

626
01:05:51,658 --> 01:05:53,922
Huddle up, folks.

627
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:57,588
- That was a pretty big hit.
- You cover Matt this play.

628
01:05:57,664 --> 01:05:59,359
Are you okay?

629
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:05,130
A little harder
down on the ground, isn't it?

630
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:08,500
Come on, old man.

631
01:06:08,575 --> 01:06:10,509
Well, you come down here.

632
01:06:15,515 --> 01:06:17,813
How old's your wife?

633
01:06:17,884 --> 01:06:20,148
How old's your wife?

634
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:21,777
Eighty.

635
01:06:22,555 --> 01:06:24,113
What's she like?

636
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,488
Old, like me.

637
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,151
What's she really like?

638
01:06:29,762 --> 01:06:32,458
Feisty, like you.

639
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:38,728
Where'd you meet her?

640
01:06:38,805 --> 01:06:41,239
You really want to know this stuff?

641
01:06:43,409 --> 01:06:45,934
I met her in a closet at a party.

642
01:06:46,012 --> 01:06:48,480
I couldn't stand her at first.

643
01:06:48,548 --> 01:06:50,482
But once it took...

644
01:06:51,584 --> 01:06:53,848
I loved her so bad it hurt.

645
01:06:55,455 --> 01:06:57,719
You still love her like that?

646
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,323
Are you quitters playing or what?

647
01:07:04,564 --> 01:07:05,826
Fine.

648
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:08,633
Good catch, Robert.

649
01:07:08,701 --> 01:07:10,635
Matt, let's go!

650
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:14,368
They brought their kids.

651
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,932
Said they didn't have food enough
to feed them through the winter.

652
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:20,912
They want to give them to you, Jed.

653
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:23,574
This is enough, Mr. Mason.
I don't want any more.

654
01:07:24,784 --> 01:07:29,084
You're a leader now.
They've heard of you on the other side.

655
01:07:29,155 --> 01:07:31,589
Maybe all the way to California.

656
01:07:32,692 --> 01:07:34,626
And there's some that say...

657
01:07:34,694 --> 01:07:37,822
they're gonna drop in some Special
Forces in the spring to help you out.

658
01:07:40,233 --> 01:07:41,564
Green Berets.

659
01:07:47,306 --> 01:07:49,740
Spring's a long time away.

660
01:07:51,344 --> 01:07:53,608
It's a lot of talk until then.

661
01:07:55,048 --> 01:07:57,573
JANUARY

662
01:08:20,673 --> 01:08:23,198
It's ours! It's ours!

663
01:08:23,276 --> 01:08:24,641
How can you tell?

664
01:08:25,545 --> 01:08:26,603
It's ours.

665
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,382
Fry 'em.

666
01:09:12,091 --> 01:09:13,524
Jesus.

667
01:09:16,662 --> 01:09:18,596
You gotta cross that?

668
01:09:20,066 --> 01:09:21,499
Just part of it.

669
01:09:22,535 --> 01:09:24,799
I hope our guys are still there.

670
01:09:28,407 --> 01:09:30,341
So this is the battlefield?

671
01:09:31,778 --> 01:09:35,942
It's a real war, kid.
It's here every day.

672
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:39,709
Come with me, Jed.

673
01:09:42,188 --> 01:09:44,122
You can quit now.

674
01:09:45,825 --> 01:09:47,952
Could you?

675
01:09:48,027 --> 01:09:50,086
Don't give me that crap.

676
01:09:51,264 --> 01:09:53,698
Wake up in the morning...

677
01:09:53,766 --> 01:09:55,427
grow old.

678
01:10:00,573 --> 01:10:02,734
Move it!
Come on! Let's go!

679
01:10:11,851 --> 01:10:14,411
Get down!
Down! Down! Down!

680
01:10:24,597 --> 01:10:26,531
Stay down! He can't see us!

681
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:50,851
He's looking for us!

682
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:54,558
He sure is.

683
01:11:00,132 --> 01:11:03,260
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!

684
01:11:04,237 --> 01:11:06,068
Get down!

685
01:11:06,138 --> 01:11:08,072
Shut up!

686
01:11:22,588 --> 01:11:24,920
Run! Everybody get outta here!

687
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:27,619
What are you doing?
Goddammit!

688
01:11:31,797 --> 01:11:33,492
I'm going up there!

689
01:11:43,509 --> 01:11:44,942
I got it!

690
01:11:46,212 --> 01:11:49,113
Get outta here, kid!
There's a world of hurt coming down!

691
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:51,115
I'm staying with you, Colonel!

692
01:11:56,555 --> 01:11:58,489
Take him out with your RPG!

693
01:11:58,557 --> 01:12:01,924
- It won't launch!
- Get another rocket!

694
01:12:04,563 --> 01:12:06,531
Give me another rocket!

695
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:18,502
Aardvark!

696
01:12:27,687 --> 01:12:29,279
Eat me!

697
01:12:54,613 --> 01:12:57,138
Come on, buddies!
Come and get 'em!

698
01:12:59,085 --> 01:13:02,452
Shoot straight, for once...

699
01:13:02,521 --> 01:13:05,922
you Army...pukes.

700
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:13,665
It's useless! He's dead!
Let's go!

701
01:13:56,308 --> 01:13:58,674
I'll never love anybody.

702
01:13:58,744 --> 01:14:01,941
I'll never love anybody again.

703
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:06,942
If you didn't love anybody,
you'd never even be here.

704
01:14:13,092 --> 01:14:15,117
Where we gonna bury him?

705
01:14:16,195 --> 01:14:18,390
There's not much left to bury.

706
01:14:24,537 --> 01:14:27,028
These were good friends.

707
01:14:27,106 --> 01:14:30,234
Take them away from here...

708
01:14:30,309 --> 01:14:32,903
someplace safe...

709
01:14:32,978 --> 01:14:35,572
where this world's never happened.

710
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:39,617
And as we remember...

711
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,279
please let them forget, O Lord...

712
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,960
so they can be little again.

713
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:08,277
What are you whispering for?

714
01:15:08,347 --> 01:15:10,747
It feels quiet.

715
01:15:10,816 --> 01:15:13,808
You should get some sleep.
It's getting late.

716
01:15:13,886 --> 01:15:15,251
I'm okay.

717
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:23,995
It's kind of strange, isn't it?

718
01:15:24,063 --> 01:15:26,793
How the mountains
pay us no attention at all.

719
01:15:27,867 --> 01:15:29,835
You laugh or you cry...

720
01:15:29,902 --> 01:15:32,462
the wind just keeps on blowing.

721
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:40,437
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

722
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,344
You're getting pretty lean
on feelings, aren't you?

723
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:46,509
I can't afford them.

724
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:48,917
Even if that had been me?

725
01:15:52,925 --> 01:15:55,291
I was talking to the group, Jed.

726
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:57,795
It doesn't look good.
They're all talking about quitting.

727
01:15:57,863 --> 01:16:01,924
It seems like they lost stomach for it,
except for Robert.

728
01:16:03,936 --> 01:16:05,597
And you?

729
01:16:05,671 --> 01:16:09,072
I'm your brother.
Just make it count.

730
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:15,941
FEBRUARY

731
01:17:13,772 --> 01:17:15,467
Attention!

732
01:17:26,785 --> 01:17:29,117
Be seated, comrades.

733
01:17:35,794 --> 01:17:38,422
What I despise most about warfare...

734
01:17:38,497 --> 01:17:41,091
is the hypocrisy it often breeds.

735
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:44,829
I've heard euphemisms
that we are containing the enemy...

736
01:17:44,903 --> 01:17:48,839
that our sector
of pacification is growing.

737
01:17:49,642 --> 01:17:51,769
These are the tactics of the lie.

738
01:17:51,844 --> 01:17:55,439
Lies have the stench
of death and defeat.

739
01:17:58,417 --> 01:18:01,215
You can only win a war...

740
01:18:01,287 --> 01:18:04,518
by exterminating the enemy.

741
01:18:06,225 --> 01:18:08,819
Do you know who we are fighting?

742
01:18:11,163 --> 01:18:14,257
We are fighting Wolverines...

743
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:18,436
small, ferocious animals.

744
01:18:19,471 --> 01:18:22,531
For them, you need a hunter.

745
01:18:22,608 --> 01:18:24,974
And you know...

746
01:18:25,044 --> 01:18:26,807
I am a hunter.

747
01:18:32,284 --> 01:18:34,582
From this moment on...

748
01:18:34,653 --> 01:18:39,420
there will be no further reprisals
against civilians.

749
01:18:39,491 --> 01:18:41,516
This was stupid.

750
01:18:44,229 --> 01:18:46,254
Impotence.

751
01:18:49,802 --> 01:18:51,633
Comrades...

752
01:18:51,704 --> 01:18:55,731
if a fox stole your chickens...

753
01:18:55,808 --> 01:19:00,336
would you slaughter your pig
because he saw the fox? No.

754
01:19:02,147 --> 01:19:04,411
You would hunt the fox...

755
01:19:04,483 --> 01:19:09,250
find where it lives and destroy it!

756
01:19:12,925 --> 01:19:15,894
And how do we do this?

757
01:19:18,197 --> 01:19:20,427
Become a fox.

758
01:21:41,473 --> 01:21:44,135
Danny, your bolt's open.
It's jammed.

759
01:21:55,087 --> 01:21:57,021
So what if he does?
You don't.

760
01:21:57,089 --> 01:21:59,023
We'd better get out of here.

761
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:01,387
Shoot him!

762
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:04,452
- What is this thing?
- What is it?

763
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:07,226
Who's coming after us?
Where are they?

764
01:22:09,835 --> 01:22:12,201
Rub a butt on him.

765
01:22:13,672 --> 01:22:15,936
Suck at you!
Goddamn for your mother!

766
01:22:16,008 --> 01:22:20,274
I hear a chopper,
and I'm going to blow your brains out.

767
01:22:20,345 --> 01:22:23,041
Go die, Yankee. Die.

768
01:22:24,182 --> 01:22:26,742
Gorsky, Stepan Yevgenyvitch.

769
01:22:26,818 --> 01:22:29,309
No one gives a damn who you are!

770
01:22:29,388 --> 01:22:31,288
- They're gonna hurt him!
- Good!

771
01:22:31,356 --> 01:22:33,221
Hey! Look!

772
01:22:34,192 --> 01:22:37,855
This thing's got an arrow.
It's pointing.

773
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:39,363
Where?

774
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,725
Right here.

775
01:23:02,287 --> 01:23:03,982
Where is it?

776
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:06,819
Where is it?

777
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:09,752
Goddammit, where's the bug?

778
01:23:09,828 --> 01:23:13,195
- They made me swallow it.
- Daryl, what have you done?

779
01:23:13,265 --> 01:23:15,529
I went into town.

780
01:23:15,601 --> 01:23:19,833
And got caught?
And went and got caught?

781
01:23:19,905 --> 01:23:21,395
Why?

782
01:23:21,473 --> 01:23:23,805
Because you said we couldn't.

783
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:27,003
You told them where we were,
didn't you?

784
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:28,842
You told them!

785
01:23:29,982 --> 01:23:31,916
My father turned me in.

786
01:23:34,019 --> 01:23:36,453
Oh, God, they did things
you can't imagine.

787
01:23:43,228 --> 01:23:44,855
You son of a bitch!

788
01:23:46,865 --> 01:23:48,799
You want blindfolds?

789
01:23:48,867 --> 01:23:52,633
- This violates the Geneva Convention.
- I never heard of it!

790
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:55,366
Dog face!
I show you how Soviet dies!

791
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,499
I've seen it before, pal.

792
01:23:57,576 --> 01:23:59,407
This isn't happening!

793
01:23:59,478 --> 01:24:00,843
Jed, let him go!

794
01:24:00,912 --> 01:24:02,971
- Shut up, Danny!
- He was one of us!

795
01:24:03,048 --> 01:24:04,413
Shut up!

796
01:24:04,483 --> 01:24:06,383
He told them where we were!

797
01:24:07,586 --> 01:24:10,555
He did.
Now get your rifles.

798
01:24:12,991 --> 01:24:16,222
- What did you say?
- I said no! We're not doing it!

799
01:24:16,294 --> 01:24:20,492
Boy, say at me you are friend,
so I will not die alone.

800
01:24:20,565 --> 01:24:22,658
What's the difference, Jed?

801
01:24:22,734 --> 01:24:25,032
- I'll do it.
- Shut up, Robert!

802
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:27,731
Tell me what's the difference
between us and them!

803
01:24:33,645 --> 01:24:36,341
Because we live here.

804
01:24:41,887 --> 01:24:43,878
Don't shoot me.
Don't shoot.

805
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:46,719
Don't shoot, Jed.
Don't shoot, Jed.

806
01:28:18,837 --> 01:28:21,772
How many of those you got left?

807
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,932
Four.

808
01:28:26,578 --> 01:28:27,943
Ready...

809
01:28:31,917 --> 01:28:33,782
No, wait. Stop.

810
01:28:43,395 --> 01:28:46,023
What do you say?
You hungry?

811
01:29:00,278 --> 01:29:01,711
Go, Toni.

812
01:30:18,156 --> 01:30:20,590
Let's get it fast
and get back to the rock.

813
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,450
Come on.

814
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:50,253
It's been so long.

815
01:31:19,217 --> 01:31:20,878
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

816
01:31:41,106 --> 01:31:42,539
Oh, my God!

817
01:31:44,242 --> 01:31:45,834
Holy shit!

818
01:31:49,247 --> 01:31:50,680
Stay down!

819
01:31:57,755 --> 01:32:00,622
Get on your horses!
Let's get out of here!

820
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:08,665
Erica, come on! Get on!

821
01:32:10,902 --> 01:32:13,336
Let's go! Let's go!

822
01:32:47,772 --> 01:32:50,104
Go on! Go on!

823
01:34:42,253 --> 01:34:43,880
Wolverines!

824
01:35:39,043 --> 01:35:40,738
I'm killed, Jed.

825
01:35:45,616 --> 01:35:49,108
Don't let them get me,
because they'll make me talk.

826
01:35:59,764 --> 01:36:01,629
Where's a gun?

827
01:36:04,268 --> 01:36:06,133
I want you to do it.

828
01:36:24,188 --> 01:36:25,621
I can't.

829
01:36:26,858 --> 01:36:29,588
I can't, Toni.
I can't.

830
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:31,252
It's okay.

831
01:36:36,567 --> 01:36:38,057
Give me a grenade.

832
01:36:41,672 --> 01:36:44,140
I don't wanna be too cold.

833
01:36:53,851 --> 01:36:55,785
Pull the pin for me.

834
01:37:06,264 --> 01:37:07,856
Go.

835
01:37:07,932 --> 01:37:11,459
I'm just gonna stay here...

836
01:37:11,536 --> 01:37:14,130
and listen to the wind awhile, okay?

837
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:19,308
Now go.

838
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:43,293
Comrade Colonel.

839
01:38:47,064 --> 01:38:51,160
I would estimate
the enemy body count at 12.

840
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:54,203
Twelve.

841
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:57,266
wouldn't you agree?

842
01:38:58,476 --> 01:38:59,909
Twelve?

843
01:39:01,178 --> 01:39:02,668
Twelve?

844
01:39:06,484 --> 01:39:09,476
I saw only one.

845
01:39:12,557 --> 01:39:15,025
But they carry off their dead.

846
01:39:15,092 --> 01:39:17,424
Of course. Why not?

847
01:39:21,265 --> 01:39:23,233
What do you think?

848
01:40:06,043 --> 01:40:08,307
All right, now listen to me.

849
01:40:08,379 --> 01:40:11,348
You two are gonna wait up here
until the troops pull back into town.

850
01:40:11,415 --> 01:40:15,112
You'll know when that happens.
When they do, head out for the plains.

851
01:40:15,186 --> 01:40:16,448
What about you?

852
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,886
I gotta stick around...

853
01:40:18,956 --> 01:40:21,220
and stir things up a little
bit so you can make it out.

854
01:40:21,292 --> 01:40:22,884
We're going with you, Mattie.

855
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,894
Will you listen to me?

856
01:40:26,197 --> 01:40:28,131
We're all that's left.

857
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:31,168
Somebody's gotta live.
Somebody's gotta make it.

858
01:40:37,208 --> 01:40:39,142
Me and Jed, we're all used up.

859
01:40:51,522 --> 01:40:53,456
I'm never gonna forget...

860
01:40:54,492 --> 01:40:56,687
as long as I live.

861
01:41:02,667 --> 01:41:04,100
Don't.

862
01:41:11,609 --> 01:41:13,543
You're never gonna know who won.

863
01:41:16,013 --> 01:41:17,742
Who will?

864
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:24,281
We could make it, Jed.
We've done a lot tougher than this.

865
01:41:24,355 --> 01:41:28,416
We could cause a diversion,
get out, head back to the mountains.

866
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:33,963
I love you, Mattie.

867
01:41:36,701 --> 01:41:38,396
I know.

868
01:41:38,469 --> 01:41:40,733
I love you too, Jed.

869
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,294
It's hard being brothers,
isn't it?

870
01:42:22,213 --> 01:42:23,305
Let's go.

871
01:42:29,386 --> 01:42:33,015
I can't remember
what it was to be warm.

872
01:42:34,859 --> 01:42:40,058
It seems a thousand years
since I was a small boy in the sun.

873
01:42:41,766 --> 01:42:45,293
How did I come to this high,
desolate place...

874
01:42:46,403 --> 01:42:48,803
where there is
nothing but loneliness?

875
01:42:51,809 --> 01:42:53,470
So much is lost.

876
01:42:55,112 --> 01:42:59,276
I want to look into
your eyes and forget.

877
01:43:01,318 --> 01:43:04,583
It all seems so far away...

878
01:43:04,655 --> 01:43:09,319
a warm house
where my shadow never falls...

879
01:43:10,661 --> 01:43:14,961
your long, black hair in my hands.

880
01:43:17,635 --> 01:43:20,536
There is no more revolution...

881
01:43:20,604 --> 01:43:23,164
only you to come back to.

882
01:43:24,441 --> 01:43:26,705
I will post my resignation.

883
01:44:45,923 --> 01:44:48,118
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

884
01:45:27,331 --> 01:45:29,697
They're attacking the station.

885
01:45:32,436 --> 01:45:34,700
Everybody to the station.

886
01:46:01,899 --> 01:46:04,060
Hurry! Hurry!

887
01:47:08,999 --> 01:47:09,931
You lose.

888
01:48:00,179 --> 01:48:02,130
Go with god.

889
01:48:17,034 --> 01:48:19,002
You can rest now.

890
01:48:22,706 --> 01:48:24,640
Just hang on, Mattie.

891
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:32,680
Oh, Mattie.
It's okay, Mattie. It's okay.

892
01:48:32,749 --> 01:48:36,845
Just hang on, Mattie.
Daddy'll be here soon, Mattie.

893
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:38,854
Hang on, Mattie.

894
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:44,450
Come on, Mattie.
Daddy'll be here soon.

895
01:48:55,139 --> 01:48:57,073
Come on, Mattie.

896
01:49:04,548 --> 01:49:08,951
I'll hold you as long as I can, Mattie.
I'll hold you as long as I can.

897
01:49:09,019 --> 01:49:10,816
You can lean on me.

898
01:49:14,725 --> 01:49:16,659
I'm so tired.

899
01:49:20,230 --> 01:49:22,061
I'm so tired.

900
01:50:02,739 --> 01:50:04,172
We're free now.

901
01:50:05,676 --> 01:50:07,109
Free.

902
01:50:21,225 --> 01:50:23,523
I never saw the brothers again.

903
01:50:23,594 --> 01:50:27,860
In time, this war,
like every other war, ended.

904
01:50:27,931 --> 01:50:29,626
But I never forgot.

905
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:33,727
And I come to this place often,
when no one else does.

906
01:50:35,806 --> 01:50:38,536
"In the early days of World War III...

907
01:50:38,609 --> 01:50:41,806
guerrillas, mostly children...

908
01:50:41,878 --> 01:50:45,177
placed the names of their lost
upon this rock.

909
01:50:45,249 --> 01:50:49,345
They fought here alone
and gave up their lives...

910
01:50:49,419 --> 01:50:53,048
so that this nation
shall not perish from the earth."
