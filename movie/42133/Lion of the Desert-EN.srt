I sent 5 governors to Libia in 5 years

What we are fighting in reality is just tribesmen, ghosts

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,240
I want their leader brought here and the revolution crushed

37
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,640
What's his name?
Omar Muktar

38
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,280
Omar?
Omar Muktar?

Omar Muktar

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,640
You know general

41
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,960
those Columnists that we sent over pacific from the south

42
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,080
they cost us leader for leader almost as if we put them up in grand hotel

43
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,800
Now something must be wrong

44
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:23,720
No... I will have a handful of Beduins stop the progress of a forty million battallions

45
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,080
I'll give you Libia then

46
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,600
least have a name that will frighten them

47
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,280
May I shed duty when i crush their belly

48
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,960
I do so with a clear conscience

49
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,240
What did Muktar do before the rebellion?

50
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,040
He was a Teacher

51
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,840
A Teacher?
Yes

52
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,000
I was a Teacher

53
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,000
Be careful you don't end up as the five who went before you,

54
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,040
taught by him

55
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,120
Well, I'm the man who likes action...
Go to Libia

56
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,960
General

57
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,720
Bring me back Muktar

58
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,480
driven or bring his neck

59
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,960
In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful

60
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,440
It is the God of Mercy who has meant in the Quran,

61
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
he created man and told him speech

62
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,240
He set the sun and the moon in their courses

63
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,160
He raised the sky up and sat the balance of whole things

64
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,760
Stop right there

65
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,880
Why do we think we begin every chapter of the Quran with

66
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,200
God, the merciful?

67
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,400
Because, one of the names of God is mercy

68
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
mercy.. thats right

69
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,120
And how.. how does God show his mercy?

70
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,680
He taught.. taught people how to speak

71
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,600
How to speak.. thats right.. yes

72
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,440
And then there was something helse in what we wear

73
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,560
could anybody... anybody... can you tell me what that was?

74
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
it was... it was...
let me give you a hint

75
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,000
it was the what?
it was the balance
that's right.. that's right

76
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,280
then why.. why did God set that balance?

77
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,920
Boys... Boys... why did God set the balance?

78
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,840
because.. because.. without the balance everything would fall

79
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,040
here.. let me see that much you read...

80
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,880
everything get fall apart

81
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,480
take it to your father

82
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,280
Where's the Omar?

83
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,520
Yes Matari, what is the news?

84
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,840
A new governor.. again?

85
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,600
They come like lions and go back home like worn-out goods

86
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,040
well, who is it this time?
Grechiani

87
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,480
the butcher of the Zion

88
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,280
Grechiani... It was only a question of time before they let him loose on us

89
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,000
It will mean you offensive

90
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,600
My father used to say: "Bellows don't break your back"

91
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,360
"Strengthen it"

92
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,560
It was so Grechiani, some spine

93
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,760
It tells me that Grechiani loves blood

94
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,440
I don't like to believe those stories

95
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,800
bring the attack to

96
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,280
When is he expected?
They decorate in Bengasi for him

97
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,280
Senmorite, Senmorine, his excellency, General Grechiani, governor of Sirinika

98
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,120
his royal highness, prince of Adol, duke of Pausta

99
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,800
Gentlemen, thank you.
But the ladies are present

100
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,360
we should be at ease.
Let the dancing continue

Colonel Deodechi Sir

00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,680
Ah yes...

105
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,480
Deodechi, I read reports on you.
They say that you could make friends with Beduins with a hand-shake

106
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,120
I'm not so sure that I like that it implies that the rest of them are strangled to make peace

107
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,280
Sir, there are 5000 displeased Beduines outside my force

108
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,360
I have no food for them. I've difficulty controlling them  and they need

109
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,720
...what you need Colonel
What you need

110
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,240
is to be a little bold for that

111
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,480
Who is that man?

112
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,000
Sheriff Agiani

113
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,960
He's quite used to us, old friend of Omar Muktar

114
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,280
peaceful, you say?

115
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,400
Bring him here

116
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,480
I think you will find that you can rely on him

117
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,280
General Grechiani
may I present his excellency, Sheriff Agiani

118
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,720
I understand that you did your man Omar Muktar..
I did

119
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,200
What would it take to get him to surrender?

120
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,120
I don't know
Even as a boy, he was terribly stubborn

121
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,920
But the price could be of help in any way, I should be very willing to agree

122
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,040
You'll find that we could be terribly generous

123
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,240
Tenant Engineeri, urgent message sir

124
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,040
Can't it wait? you see you are disturbing my guests

125
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,240
Excuse me gentlemen.
They say, the flagman has lost his manor while sleeping on his despatch

126
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,280
What is this?
Another waster of minova?

127
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,880
How many dead at this time?
20 dead 50 wounded sir

128
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,920
And they let him go again
yes, sir
But, this time, he was seen

129
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,720
He was seen? How do they knew he was seen when nobody know him, how do they knew he was seen?

130
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,400
It was only for a moment sir.
But they are sure. It was Muktar

131
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,480
I suppose I should decorate them just for being brave to have seen Muktar

132
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,440
There could be.. There could be.. Could be anywhere..

133
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,720
Tumani, I want you to use it, fast, how hard a hitting force is and you could

134
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,840
take whatever Omar Muktar was like

135
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,520
I'm disgusted that we have never seen him

136
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,640
go for his blood
go for his circulation
go for the revolution that is inside every Beduin

137
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,080
Muktar's been fighting chance
3 months ran with him

138
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,320
and next 3 months peaceful times

139
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,640
Tumani, no peace

140
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,400
Hameed, take your brother

141
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,880
be at
be at
be at

142
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,840
those 3 at the end there

143
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,800
...and ...and ...and

144
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,280
you two

145
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,200
...and ...and ...and

146
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,200
yea...

147
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,280
let young go...

148
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,040
Some of you have conflicts,

149
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,280
instead of good 3 months
...with Muktar

150
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,120
you go to your useful labor

151
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,320
while you be out of chawla

152
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,120
give the half of the gift to Muktar

153
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,240
burn half of everything

154
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,200
Its a bullet would sir

155
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,680
You were shot running with Muktar, weren't you?

156
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
what have you to say?

157
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,920
what have you to say?

158
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,400
Beduin?

159
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,480
Well, you wrote it on yourself
Execute him

160
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,560
Not, not out there. Here
Let them see it

161
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,280
In the name of God,
give him time to pray

162
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,200
you are old, be careful

163
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,200
Aisha

164
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Aisha

165
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,400
ma, I must do something

166
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,560
Oh God

167
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,560
I must do something

168
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,880
my family, they burnt its tree

169
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,920
I saw what happen, my brother and Aisha

170
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,360
then look at my father.
I'm going to see Omar

171
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Its not your turn yet

172
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,080
I became old enough today mother

173
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,720
Hameed

174
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,040
I need you

175
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,720
They must pass through here

176
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
start this ground

177
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,480
out there
that is it

178
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,360
How, you can't hide a lizard out there.

179
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
Ustad Omar

180
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,200
Ejid

181
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,480
Check the other side

182
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,320
Sir, at last we got them, where we want them

183
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,240
Let's crack it of them, move it

184
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,960
Lets go

185
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,680
He's there.

186
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
Mount

187
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,400
They'r running. Put your foot down

188
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,080
They'r on a trap
we must warn Tumani

189
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,240
You hear that?

190
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Its Leutinant Adri sir

191
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
what the hell he is doing?

192
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,000
may be warning shots sir

193
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,720
all stop

194
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,200
all stop

195
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,680
Geytuari, do you see anything?

196
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,600
no, nothing sir

197
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,400
nothing

198
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,520
They are getting away. we have them in our hands

199
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,240
full persuit

200
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,360
Look at those machines

201
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,400
We do not kill prisoners
do them not

202
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,720
They are not our teachers

203
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,920
He's a boy

204
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,560
Here

205
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,560
Tell your general it does not belong here

206
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,560
My husband...

207
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,720
I have... I have brought his book home

208
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,880
never turned his back on...

209
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,880
come here

210
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,640
what is your name?
Ali

211
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,200
Oh, yes Ali

212
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,560
This is yours

213
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,760
This is your book now

214
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,440
you tell your mother to keep it for you

215
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,920
Do not let him see you crying too much

216
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,760
for they will carry on the fight

217
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,520
He truly should remember him strong, with confidence

218
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,440
never broken

219
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,040
go inside

220
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,480
Let us go and see the camp Ali

221
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,200
This is my friend, Ali

222
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,960
He is Umatari
He is a little boy just like you

223
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,360
He is in Kufr, far away, in the desert

224
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,120
he misses me. We have some work to do

225
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,800
careful...

226
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,920
Oh... Is that supposed to be me? How do I look?

227
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,920
Go to bed back.
Otherwise, I cannot win

228
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,920
you go... you go to the tent over there

229
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,440
wiped out.. one Leutinant...

230
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,120
and one scout out...

231
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,160
that is all its left of the fighting force

232
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,880
I did not come to Libia to be stunned by Bandits

233
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,880
Senorite Tumani is going to be left in his conffins

234
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,040
This young boy saved our honor by coming back with the flag

235
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,440
sir...
yes yes yes, you will be decorated with the medal of honor

236
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:19,080
I've never in my career lost a fight

237
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,280
Gentlemen, I will repeat once in perfect to you

238
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,560
We will not be in fight with Muktar or 200 of his men here or 50 of his men there

239
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,200
we are fighting a population

240
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,240
I am therefore taking the first 3 final steps

241
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,720
straight to eliminate rebellion in this economy

242
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,320
Its really quite simple and really should have been thought out before

243
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,280
I propose to concentrate on the Beduins

244
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,200
concentrate them?

245
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:56,160
Yes, put them in a high walled camps and keep them there until we find prudent and safe to release them

246
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,360
No need of any pity for them
They have brought this upon themselves

247
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,080
We will fill their wells, we will burn their fuels,

248
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,200
we will destroy their trees
we will turn their land brown

249
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,800
Now, if they cannot live with it, they'll leave it

250
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,440
And.. if we meet the resistance?
you answer it prompty with your own punishment for rebellion

251
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,760
Thats the message

252
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,560
Turn around

253
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,320
As mutinists and rebels,
you will be decimated

254
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,160
One... Two... Three...

255
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,880
Nine... Ten...

256
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,960
They've taken everybody

257
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,000
Who can fight such a war?

258
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,680
Not against army but against innocent people

259
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,960
people will be dieing in those camps and compounds

260
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:38,480
people will be dieing without food, without any choice

261
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,920
or was it my fault?
indirect choice?

262
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,040
look what they did

263
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:39,560
[ raised the sky up and set the balance of all things ]

264
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,680
Its the Omar

265
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,280
No

266
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,600
We will be massacred

267
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,040
you have a chance to get away
Take it

268
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,640
Go with this mare
Don't think of it

269
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,160
Go... Go...

270
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,440
Ali

271
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,560
Ali

272
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,680
Up behing me
Up behind me

273
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,320
Go back.. Go back for that boy

274
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,360
The horse won't take too
His mare knows that

275
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Hurry up Ustad Omar

276
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,200
So, you are the brave young man

277
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,880
The brave young man who saved Muktar from me

278
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:56,280
why did you do it?
you are young

279
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,920
you had your whole life behind it

280
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,800
Tell me
Would you want to live?

281
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,560
come on

282
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,840
I want him to live more

283
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,560
You will make a fine soldier

284
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,720
Would you think of joining us?
You earn more with us lion prince

285
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,680
you will corrupt him

286
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,440
Get him out of here
Give him Riyals, fruit, honey.. whatever

287
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:35,760
Don't harm him
Hang him..
in the morning

288
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,720
Desert is their home, General
I'd be careful.. next

289
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:54,160
You may be next to him, even if its a small paragraph in a newspaper in Rome

290
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:01,920
You touch my strength Prince

291
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,000
A gain in the mind of Rome

292
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,560
is more important to me than the generation of men of Libia

293
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,320
And what happens if you are... you are forgotten in Rome and

294
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,280
you are remembered in Libia?

295
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,560
Why do you worry so much about that?
you see, we will write the history
Libia is our crown of thorns

296
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,120
Libia is our career

297
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,320
locate it

298
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,120
locate it

299
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,320
Its always the same
We can never persue them in the desert

300
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,800
I must conquer the desert as much on a crusade

301
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,560
from here to here
Simple.. isn't it?

302
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,320
No, its not

303
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,040
But, its only empty desert

304
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:12,120
There's nothing there, just wind and sand,

305
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,520
not even much opposition

306
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,360
what can you get from it?
worry for Rome

307
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:25,800
an extension of the Emperor and finding the revolution to the mountain

308
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,680
my name, a new page in military history

309
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,160
seize it as quiteful as offense

310
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,920
I will surprise you

311
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,040
come in

312
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,200
Diatich, now is your time. Please sit down

313
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,080
The man who can make peace with a hand-shake

314
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,560
Do it now....

315
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,000
Hands across the desert

316
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,720
I wish to instigate peace talks with his excelleny

317
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,680
Omar Muktar

318
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,440
That will not be so easy now.
Now, you will do it, won't you?

319
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,440
And what are the pre-conditions for talks with Omar Muktar?

320
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,360
No pre-conditions. The whole of Libia is open to discussion. Look at it

321
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:39,840
Look at it

322
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:46,040
We go to the conference table with no pre-mind or not

323
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,000
He fought us for 20 years.
We are anamoly, he knows

324
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,960
He'll sack all our promises

325
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,880
20 years is too long. I mean can you imagine escaping hanging for 20 years and you can't win just hoping to keep on

326
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,280
Its a war. It's a hope man would be mad

327
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,880
to get on his high horse to back false promises.

328
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,800
When may I... your excellency's man sit down with him?

329
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,960
When you talk to Omar Muktar, it must be with the speed of the tesh

330
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,760
Regress whether you are talk or not. Interest in your tie-in

331
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,360
Yes, I will try

332
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,360
Thank you very much

333
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:44,160
Thank you for coming at very short notice
It was very kind of you

334
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,040
Thank you

335
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,200
Well, let us settle this.
Duditch is not the right man.

336
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,720
He will offer. But Muktar can't take

337
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,960
and Muktar will ask what he can't give

338
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:11,440
which makes me think, you want things go long

339
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,880
No

340
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:22,280
I want some fair chance, I want some peace course

341
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,040
I want to win that peace

342
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:28,920
But sometimes Prince when you are strong, it means natural conquest is not enough

343
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,440
He won't give me peace
But he will give me time

344
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,840
what I need is time

345
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,640
So, thats what he looks like

346
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,040
After all these years, we are the first to see him

347
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,560
The Old Lion!

348
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,800
Colonel Duditchi?
yes sir

349
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,400
Please

350
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,440
This side

351
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,680
Curnel Barilo, military Governor of Merch!

352
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:12,680
This is Commissionor Roberto, has come directly from Rome for advice and assistance

353
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,760
You invited us here to talk

354
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,560
We are here

355
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:29,280
You Excellency,
it is my one wish

356
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,760
to see the Italian and the Arab together in the Solopian desert

357
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:41,640
I could see a future of common cause, give and take of character skill,

358
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:47,080
our civilization and your culture

359
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,280
in marriage of virtues

360
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,360
I want observators to come from Tunisia or Egypt

361
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,560
to witness any agreements between us

362
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,960
... as for as I am concerned

363
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:01,720
Out of the question Duditch

364
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,040
He is seeking International Recognition, as if the Beduins were an independent nation which they are not

365
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,400
They are subjects within our province

366
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,560
Our arguments are not within nations, but between Italians

367
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,880
We cannot permit outside interference in our internal affairs

368
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,520
They why must you represent this. We are not Italians, and do not tell us who we are

369
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,920
We were born where we were born only by the will of God

370
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,880
and only by our own mothers. We are not you

371
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,680
And who will come as Foreign Observators later uh?

372
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,280
As yet, nothing written, nothing witnessed

373
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,560
But, we have written

374
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,160
You must have muslime schools..
Oh, yes

375
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,600
no question. Freedom of education, no question

376
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,680
The schools will be re-opened

377
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
We must have some form of national protection

378
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,960
We must have our National Parliament..
Your Parliament is a matter for Rome

379
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,440
This tent is not the place

380
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:27,640
Why not?
You pitched it, no conditions you said, no limits, no conclusions,

381
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,320
everything open on this table in this tent

382
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,440
Let us say that, at present we will note your demand for the parliament

383
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,720
Mark it well

384
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:52,080
The confiscated lands must be given back

385
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,960
well...

386
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,040
I wouldn't say confiscated lands

387
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,840
I would say lands reserved for settlement and cultivation, lands to be developed

388
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:09,320
To be developed by Italians?

389
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,520
I tell you there is no space 20 years.
For years, the land would be packed with people

390
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:22,000
Why do you think we fight you?
But, the new settlements will provide employment

391
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,920
as long as you take our lands, as long as where I was born, we must fight you

392
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,680
must?
yes, we must

393
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:37,360
But, I have it on religious authority that your Quran does not allow you to fight a war you cannot win

394
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:41,440
Now, you are going to interpret our religion first...

395
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:47,080
The Book leaves no doubt.
It is our duty to God to defend ourselves

396
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,520
against those who have driven us out of our homes

397
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:58,040
I think this might be a good time to adjourn
We are in no hurry

398
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,040
why are you delaying?

399
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,320
Your excellency, we are obliged to refer your demands to Rome

400
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:15,480
On 3rd, the next meeting, we will give you their answer and make our proposal

401
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:23,360
Atleast.. Atleast we know that we all want the blood-shed between us to end

402
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,280
An Italian Invasion...

403
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,120
The first use of aircraft in combat,

404
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,600
the first Portekts of the desert

405
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,000
history will mark that gentlemen

406
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,760
What we need was time.
Now, we have achieved that time

407
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:06,760
with talk peace
with a lot of weapons

408
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,080
1. Omar Muktar's men will come under the command of Italian Officer

409
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,960
Go on...

410
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,880
2. The Italian Government will pay monthly salary to these men

411
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,760
Go on

412
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,560
Go on...

413
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:31,160
The Government reserves the right to punish any persons who committed a crime before this agreement

414
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,360
Omar Muktar will have no right to protect such persons

415
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:40,440
4.
These terms mean dis-honour
Absolute surrender

416
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,760
That even subjects for discussion

417
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:50,160
The Italian Government undertakes to pay Omar Muktar a pension of 50,000 Lirahs a month

418
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,240
and to provide him with a comfortable house

419
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,640
Do I deserve so much?

420
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:02,200
I've been so successful to offer me 50,000 Lirahs a month?

421
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,400
You know, by offering me bribes, you are insulting me

422
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:13,840
Your excellency,
I made that proposal

423
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,800
Believe me..

424
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:20,120
It was not an attempt to bribe you

425
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,720
only to make your retirement
comfortable

426
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,320
How can I be comfortable when my people are in concentration camps?

427
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,600
and where is this General who bombs and burns and hangs?

428
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,800
Why has be never come here?

429
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,440
Once he sees this agreement between us

430
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,480
General Gotchiani will be happy to see you

431
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:44,240
I do not want to see him.
I want to see the last of him

432
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:50,360
And why is he landing troups?
Where is he going? to the last Oasis?

433
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,040
6000 drums of water

434
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,640
He is going to Kufra

435
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:10,600
He never wanted peace.
All you wanted was time

436
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,880
We will be with Gotchiani

437
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:19,320
If you will not come to these terms, I'll promise you immediately terrible war

438
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,360
Oh I know the power of your Government, the power you threatens with...

439
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,960
we've stood against you for 20 years
... and with the help of God

440
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:34,320
we will stay with you till your end

441
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I knew this conclusion would....

442
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,080
poor folks
They think they can ride against the Golden Army

443
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,160
Its Kufra, no question

444
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,200
those soldiers and machines, all going to Kufra

445
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,600
Gotchiani is doing what no one has ever done
he's putting tanks in a desert

446
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,400
The tanks... that is insane

447
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:33,800
Gotchiani is marching south to Kufra
We, attack North.
We throw him back

448
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:37,000
We must fight him for Kufra

449
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,480
Sometimes, it is braver not to die. If it is lost, country is not lost

450
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,720
We know your family is there

451
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:49,080
But, to defend Kufra is to die there

452
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,160
I must go

453
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,720
Yes, yes you must

454
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,760
Are you ready to platter them?
Yes sir

455
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,040
Good... We've been given help

456
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,400
Colonel Andriani, open fire

457
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,440
Go now

458
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,200
Fire everything on them

459
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:51,480
Borm it on their front

460
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,440
Murderers

461
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:32,680
What are you doing?
Consolute Gotchiani's orders

462
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,920
No retreat, we fight and die here

463
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,280
Gentlemen
This is Kufra

464
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:31,040
The seizure of Kufra has hurt us deeply

465
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,960
it has closed the south

466
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:40,600
The only road for military supplies is across the Egyptian Border

467
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:48,520
We are in desperate need of supplies, food...

468
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:51,040
Hilgariani's coming up the Merch Road

469
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,840
How many?
Three
They are flying white flags

470
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,480
Let them in

471
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,880
We will finish later

472
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,600
Sheriff Hilgariani

473
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,600
To come through, we have to use the Italian cars

474
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,800
you sound and comfortable?
We want to talk to you alone

475
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,880
What we have to say cannot be said in public

476
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,200
Then, it is not to be said to me

477
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:53,880
Omar, why do you not surrender?
We've obtained the best terms you can from the Italians

478
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,880
Mohamed will re-direct a safe conduct out of the country

479
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,640
safe conduct?
Where to?
Egypt

480
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,840
To Egypt... To hide with his brother

481
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:11,320
You are the only sonusi left in this country

482
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,520
I look at it

483
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,240
Just... just look at him

484
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:22,840
But, my people have fought
to defend your own privileges

485
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,000
Where are you now?

486
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:29,520
Omar Muktar... The Italians are shrewdness.
You better get back to them

487
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,800
My friend.. they are the Government of this country

488
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,600
No, they take this land by day,

489
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,040
but by God we take it back by night

490
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,720
Omar Muktar, you are alone

491
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:44,360
cut off from the rest of this country,
isolated from the rest of the world

492
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:49,320
In the legal nations, it will not speak

493
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,680
and if they should not listen, noone would care

494
01:28:54,520 --> 01:29:01,160
This battle is not being fought in the league of nations, this battle is being fought here on this land

495
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,960
Omar, you cannot win this war

496
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,720
Your blood against their metal?

497
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:11,400
Every man has to die his own day... and he truly lives

498
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:15,400
your children are starving, dieing in the concentration camps

499
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,320
dieing... because you persist in fighting

500
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,440
yes... yes they are... as in this war

501
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,800
but not one of them betrays me

502
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:30,280
not one has asked me to surrender
because they know and I know that if I surrender, I betray them

503
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,440
Omar, you and I grew up together.
Don't you remember 70 years ago, we were boys together

504
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
yes, yes I remember

505
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,080
Look how far apart we have grown

506
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:48,640
This may the last chance you have for seeking an honourable peace

507
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:53,760
They steal our land, they destroy our homes,  they kill innocent people

508
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,040
and you call it peace?

509
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:01,440
I will not be corrupted by that man's peace

510
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:08,440
Perhaps we should go.
Yes, I think you should

511
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,400
yes you should

512
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,600
Matluka?
yes

513
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,080
a lot...

514
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,080
Yes, we seek with the Omar

515
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,600
I've prepared it for you

516
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:09,080
Once after he showed him in the battle, he gave it to me

517
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:02,640
The bright boy?

518
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:10,480
Will you be back?

519
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,120
yes

520
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,800
but not for some time

521
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,440
go

522
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,720
go now

523
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:32,760
Up you get
come on
out

524
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,640
her child is sick sir
I don't care

525
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,760
you are accused of giving aid, confort and sustainance to the rebels in the mountain

526
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:11,400
Do you admit these capited crimes?

527
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,760
So, you are admitting your guilt

528
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:24,960
you will all hang by your necks

529
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,600
until you are dead

530
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:34,760
As the holder of 'Medal of Honour' Leutinant, you will have the privilege
of giving the order for the execution

531
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,400
No

532
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:43,160
What did you say?
You will do your duty Leutinant

533
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,360
I did not join the army to hang women, sir

534
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:56,000
Very well... Leutinant Chandrini, you will consider yourself under arrest

535
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:30,800
Cend your God for the lives of the given

536
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,680
What am I to do?
You refuse duty

537
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:01,560
In-subordination is a very serious offence

538
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,960
When your officer starts crype options, you were to learn, do you?

539
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:09,760
I'm prepared to answer to the Court Marshall sir

540
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,840
Indeed... and I am not prepared to loose one of my Colunists for news here

541
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:26,600
Here are all I created
I will not give you the pleasure nor the publicity of a Court Marshall Cendrini

542
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,480
As an officer, you were taught to obey orders without questions

543
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:36,320
...Yes sir, but
You can't dispute with me

544
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:43,400
The State has needs that out-way the conscious of an individual,

545
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:47,120
the demand that goes beyond individual intelligence, isn't it be?

546
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,840
yes sir

547
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,120
You will report to Assasi for duty in the mountains

548
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,600
I will give you the honour of dieing for the service

549
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:42,560
Get this stuff loaded

550
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,200
ÓÇáã¡ Êæáì ÃãÑ ÇáÈÑÇãíá

551
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:00,000
Zailab, take care of the tanks

552
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:23,200
I will drop the Benzene

553
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:27,920
Gentlemen, this time he won't get away

554
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:31,520
First, we take the bridge
get our men behind him
artilery in front of him

555
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:35,600
then we pound him into submission
The bridge sir, I'm surprised that Muktar hasn't tried to cut it

556
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:39,600
That's because he's an artful fighter, not an educated one,

557
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:43,040
he didn't go to military academy like you gentlemen

558
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:48,680
Now is the time, we tank him at date

559
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:57,800
Take the bridge

560
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,520
Sargeant, take the bridge

561
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,920
All clear

562
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:26,120
Right, check the next bridge
I will hold this one here

563
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,200
He is careful

564
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:39,960
He is showing his naive

565
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:07,120
That is bait
We should have blown up the bridge

566
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,560
No

567
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:11,960
He has come close, we must stop him

568
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,680
Give the signal

569
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,600
Did you see?

570
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:00,560
The mice

571
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:04,360
they could never resist the cheese, could they?

572
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,440
Prepare the artilery to open fire

573
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:57,200
Bust them

574
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:55,240
Now, send in the army

575
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:03,760
Now, he has made his move

576
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:32,560
Look, over there

577
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:34,440
Ambush

578
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:35,640
Now

579
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,240
He is good

580
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:11,720
He is good

581
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:16,400
This old man is good

582
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:25,360
My dear General

583
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:29,280
My dear dear General
I hoped you are the man who share some of your credit that

584
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:30,720
after all I chose you

585
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:35,400
I hope to say that I can...
you can only hope you won
you are the most fortunate man in this room

586
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,160
I have physically moved the war from the desert into the mountains

587
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,720
The last man into the enemy now run into whole three, find ourselves into a position whereby we are

588
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:47,400
forced to pull them out by their necks one by one

589
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:49,680
Dutchia, I didn't know

590
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:51,960
I know

591
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:56,200
You are having difficulties

592
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:02,800
you don't have problems with them being in the mountains

593
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,840
I didn't seem to have an enemy to fight, yet they attack and assasinate

594
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:08,400
I mean, they have no form and they have form that I could beat them with form

595
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:15,320
but they have no continuity of movement
no fixed point position

596
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,400
I haven't have to come to Dutchia

597
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:21,440
I have a radical solution

598
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:23,120
A New Hadrian's Wall

599
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:25,400
except

600
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:30,720
Adrian used his walls to shut the Barbarians Out

601
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:33,240
I mean to shut them in

602
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:37,560
I propose Dutchia to fence in Libia

603
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:44,800
To run a war, impossible war across the desert,
from the Mediterranean to the shores of this sea of moving sand

604
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:50,800
It will cut the enemies off from his supplies out of Egypt and cut him off from his retreat into Egypt

605
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:53,320
Dutchi, Dutchi! Hundreds of miles of barbed wire

606
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:04,640
But, is it possible to know the cost?
Why do you question Adrian's Wall?

607
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:10,760
Remember, it was Adrian's Wall that kept the Romans in Britain 100 years longer

608
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,640
How many bullets have you?
12

609
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:11,080
At this rate, we will be soon down to fighting them with stones

610
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:15,040
How long can we last?

611
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:17,920
a months time

612
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:20,400
Nothing has got through for months

613
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:22,320
We are fighting barbed wire

614
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:29,560
Wire will win
While it takes high spirit

615
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:32,800
Only then

616
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:38,560
yes yes the wire is menace

617
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:40,200
It is... It is around our neck

618
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:45,200
but it is God, not Gotchiani that decides what becomes of us

619
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,200
What is the will of wire compared to the will of God?

620
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:55,400
They have 3 million guns, we have one

621
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:34,080
They are going up to Becoz sir
They were trying to get through wire cutters and 5000 arms of ammunition

622
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:52,800
well

623
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:58,560
This is that
Now, they have to trickle from the concentration camps

624
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:02,800
We will tie it up gentlemen

625
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:05,760
We will tie it up

626
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:04,000
Go.. Go... We will hold them off

627
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:55,600
Its suicide sir
They tied their legs so that they cannot run

628
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,200
No

629
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:05,120
No

630
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:09,960
You are taken in arms

631
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:11,960
you.. shoot him

632
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:27,200
There are more in there. Follow them up

633
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:32,600
Go on

634
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:41,880
You took him. Shoot him

635
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:50,200
You idiot
I said... shoot him

636
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:10,280
Where is he?

637
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:21,440
well?

638
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:25,000
yes

639
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:27,600
I confirm with the identification

640
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:30,120
He is Omar Muktar

641
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:36,560
I don't trust I am seeing him like this

642
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,840
How can you say that?

643
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:42,560
He lead the rebellion against us for 20 years

644
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:48,760
As a battle ememy, Omar Muktar should be treated by us

645
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,720
with dignity and with respect

646
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:56,680
with respect?
He should have been whipped all the way here

647
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:01,800
You forget yourself sir

648
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,200
Sir

649
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:20,040
Is there anything I can do for you?

650
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:26,720
If you will allow me a little water, I can make myself ready for prayers

651
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,040
of course

652
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:33,080
and the chains while I pray
out of the question

653
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:37,200
He only wants to pray
I am too old to try more sir

654
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:39,280
to fight bare-handed

655
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:44,840
Remove his chains for an hour
On your own responsibility sir?

656
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:47,320
Yes

657
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,600
Bring the water

658
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:00,800
Thank You

659
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:05,480
No

660
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:07,080
No need

661
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:33,280
I have come a long way to meet you

662
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:38,080
Now, you must wait

663
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:17,360
I want to ask you one question

664
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,400
You did you keep going at this alone?

665
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,640
I assure you that you cannot try it out because of the religion?

666
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:28,240
we fought you

667
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:31,680
that was enough

668
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:34,360
But you care nothing about the nation or your country

669
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:37,800
you are the ruining nation of my country

670
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,040
What would you do if someone occupied your land?

671
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:45,120
Did you ever think your attacks will seem to us as ambush?

672
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:50,080
Lead it by night
Destruction by day

673
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:54,320
threats against farmers
farming in our land

674
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:59,880
Libia is not your country
You have no right in it, not to a pasture of one cow, not one minute of right

675
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:04,640
Italy has as much right as anybody else

676
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:08,840
England has right to Egypt
France to Tunicia and Algeria

677
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,720
Spain to Moracus

678
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:15,320
The Pentagon have opted to agree

679
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:17,840
We have hundreds of years of right here

680
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:24,000
So, you will take everything from us
and you want me to justify your tax?

681
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:28,160
No nation has the right to occupy another

682
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:42,360
We are back here, thats all - Imm
No one can deny us

683
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:57,520
Meet the date in this coin

684
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,480
Its a coin of the Cesars, dated, minted in Libia

685
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,040
You will also find Greek, Turkish, Tunician coins

686
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:11,120
all over Libia you will find them,

687
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:12,960
buried in our sand

688
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:14,440
Yes, I had forgotten

689
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:20,400
You are short sighted, aren't you?

690
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:25,160
Your spectacles I believe

691
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:29,120
the day they brought them to me
I knew you wouldn't be too far behind

692
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:34,320
My spectacles
have bought you prisoners

693
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:40,080
That will not be real
Take them back
Here...

694
02:17:56,800 --> 02:18:01,840
Yes, it does have an interesting past
you don't try to buy too much with it today

695
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:08,960
I learnt it... like the glory is not permanent

696
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:14,400
But I respect your past
and you must respect ours

697
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:20,240
It too have a history and science, mathematics and medicine

698
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:24,960
In your dark ages,
we lead the world to learn

699
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:32,200
How many days will it take you to arrange the surrender of your men?

700
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:36,200
we will never surrender

701
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:40,800
we win or we die

702
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:43,640
and don't think that it stops there

703
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:48,160
We will have the next generation to fight,
and after that the next,
and next

704
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:54,960
As for me, I will live longer than my hang-man

705
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:59,160
What makes you think I am to hang you? Um?

706
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:05,800
I made suit my papers better to pension you

707
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:09,640
If I hang you, I won't want the risk of having the open trial

708
02:19:09,640 --> 02:19:11,640
But, on the other hand, you are the prime example

709
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:17,440
You can only do to me what God decides for me

710
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:21,400
These chains are uncomfortable?

711
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:26,040
Yes, uncomfortable effects

712
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:28,840
Sit Down

713
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:32,400
Thank You

714
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:44,080
...Do you know... I had always hoped

715
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:50,160
but you and I ...
in-packable enemies

716
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:52,600
and sit down on the day of your capture and discuss like Cesar ...

717
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:59,880
General
Omar Muktar cannot give you the conquest of Cesar
I never wanted you to do this alone

718
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:07,120
I mean knowing each other will do
an idea
come to us and we'll release you

719
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:15,720
and today's the day I work for you?

720
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:18,160
Why don't you ask me with your life,

721
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:21,280
I am guilty!

722
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:23,960
and then...

723
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:29,320
What do I give you?

724
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:30,920
my coloboration?

725
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:34,640
No

726
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:37,840
No

727
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:45,520
You are too late for bargains Muktar

728
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:46,680
You are far too later

729
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:49,440
I have not asked you for my life

730
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:55,640
Do not tell the world, in the privacy of this room I asked you for my life

731
02:20:59,360 --> 02:21:00,960
No, I will not do that

732
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:03,360
I will not lie about you

733
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:08,600
You are a man of king

734
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:15,800
Let us see if you can keep that courage tomorrow

735
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:26,760
Rope of your justice is always hanging in front of me General

736
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:41,000
Have him fed now
I wish my enemies to be regluded

737
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:48,760
Instruct the President of the Court that he must be hanged in front of his people

738
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:52,560
They must be there

739
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:16,840
Omar Muktar, you are accused

740
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:21,520
of open rebelliong against the lawful Government

741
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:23,920
of your country

742
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:37,320
What age are you?

743
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:41,800
73

744
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:46,600
Are you the head of the forces in Libia fighting against Italy?

745
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:51,160
Yes, I am

746
02:22:54,680 --> 02:22:58,080
Have you taken part in attacks on Italian Soldiers?

747
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:01,520
Yes, I have

748
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:06,520
For how long, have you taken part in attacks on Italian Soldiers?

749
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:10,800
20 years

750
02:23:11,440 --> 02:23:13,680
How many attacks?

751
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:20,320
No... I... I couldn't remember the number

752
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:25,280
Ordering the torturing and murdering of Italian Prisoners?

753
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:27,200
I did not

754
02:23:27,560 --> 02:23:29,040
Never

755
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:31,720
You were captured with arms in your hands

756
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:34,760
Yes, I was

757
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:58,840
The enemy was insulted

758
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:02,680
In the field, I would reason it

759
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:08,640
... but here

760
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:09,640
I am obliged to

761
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:11,840
I am appointed to defend him

762
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:17,320
You are an old man

763
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:22,680
older, than all of us here

764
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:26,840
and I will not abuse you with too many questions

765
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:31,880
Did you ever submit to the Italian Authority?

766
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:34,600
I did not

767
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:39,680
Did you ever receive money or other subsidy from the Italian Government?

768
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:44,720
as a condition of good behaviour?

769
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:48,920
I did not

770
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:51,160
Never

771
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:53,080
I declare

772
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:58,400
that Omar Muktar never submitted to us

773
02:24:58,760 --> 02:25:01,400
never took subsity from us

774
02:25:01,560 --> 02:25:06,200
never recognize our right to rule in this colony

775
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:12,960
He cannot therefore,
illogic or justice betrayed by us as a rebel

776
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:19,960
When we captured Omar Muktar,
after 20 years of battles

777
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:26,880
we are morally obliged to do with him
as a prisoner of war

778
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:40,200
