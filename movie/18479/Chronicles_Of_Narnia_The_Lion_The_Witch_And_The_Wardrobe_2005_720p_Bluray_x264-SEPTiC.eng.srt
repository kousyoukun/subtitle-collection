1
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,490
Edmund! Get away from there!

2
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:44,058
Peter! What do you think you're doing?

3
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,002
Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now!

4
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,369
- Come on!
- Wait...

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,101
Come on, leave it!

6
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,507
Mommy!

7
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,972
Lucy, come on!

8
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,078
- Come on, quickly!
- Run!

9
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,587
Run!

10
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,856
- Hurry!
- Mum!

11
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,792
- Wait! Dad!
- Ed!

12
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:11,455
- Edmund, no!
- I'll get him!

13
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,898
- Peter, come back!
- Ed! Come here!

14
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,832
Edmund! Get down!

15
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,504
Come on, you idiot, run!

16
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,774
Get out!

17
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,844
Come on!

18
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,648
Hurry!

19
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,814
Why can't you think of anyone
but yourself? You're so selfish!

20
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,916
- You could've got us killed!
- Stop it!

21
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,017
It's OK.

22
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,794
Why can't you just do as you're told?

23
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:04,046
Alms for the poor. Alms for the poor.

24
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:05,447
God bless you, sir.

25
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,713
Children and evacuation staff...

26
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,655
You need to keep this on, darling.
All right?

27
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,158
You warm enough? Good girl.

28
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:18,687
Say hello to Auntie Laura.
Goodbye, darling, we love you.

29
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,298
- Dad wouldn't make us go.
- If Dad were here,

30
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,529
it'd mean the war was over.
We wouldn't have to.

31
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,232
You will listen to your brother,
won't you, Edmund?

32
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,922
Promise me you'll look after the others.

33
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,549
I will, Mum.

34
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:54,298
- Good man.
- All aboard! All aboard!

35
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,631
- Bye, darling!
- Bye!

36
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:59,330
Susan.

37
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,331
Be a big girl.

38
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,776
Hold on to your brother's hand.
Don't let it go.

39
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,342
All right. Off you go.

40
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,410
- All aboard!
- Bye-bye. Love you.

41
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:23,490
Hey, get off. I know
how to get on a train by myself.

42
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,428
Get off me!

43
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,862
May I have your tickets, please?
Tickets, please.

44
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,925
Peter.

45
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:35,838
- That's right. On you go.
- Yes. Thank you.

46
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,772
Come along.
Come along this way, please.

47
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:44,514
Come on, Lucy.
We have to stick together now.

48
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,747
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be fine.

49
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,387
Bye, Mommy! I love you!

50
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,374
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon.

51
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,002
- I love you, Mum! Bye!
- See you soon!

52
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,013
- Write to us, Mum!
- Love you!

53
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,638
Goosey Station. Goosey Station.

54
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,948
Give me your hand. Let's get going.

55
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,479
The professor knew we were coming.

56
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:35,145
Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled.

57
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,217
Come on, hup!

58
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:46,389
And whoa. Whoa.

59
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,470
- Mrs. Macready?
- I'm afraid so.

60
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,836
Is this it, then?
Haven't you brought anything else?

61
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,880
No, ma'am.

62
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,073
It's just us.

63
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,184
Small favors.

64
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:13,783
Come on. Good girl. Come on. Come on.

65
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:32,242
Professor Kirke is not accustomed
to havin' children in this house.

66
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:36,407
And, as such, there are a few rules
we need to follow.

67
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,507
There will no shoutin'.

68
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,918
Or runnin'.
No improper use of the dumbwaiter.

69
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,980
No touchin' of the historical artifacts!

70
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,726
And above all,

71
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:56,063
there shall be no disturbin'
of the professor.

72
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,574
German aircraft carried out a number
of attacks on Great Britain last night.

73
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,980
The raids, which lasted
for several hours...

74
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,481
The sheets feel scratchy.

75
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:25,630
Wars don't last forever, Lucy.
We'll be home soon.

76
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,395
- Yeah, if home's still there.
- Isn't it time you were in bed?

77
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,834
- Yes, Mum.
- Ed!

78
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:38,040
You saw outside. This place is huge.

79
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,135
We can do whatever we want here.

80
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,703
Tomorrow's going to be great.

81
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,015
Really.

82
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,522
"Gastrovascular."

83
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:58,262
Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular.

84
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,595
- Is it Latin?
- Yes.

85
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,433
Is it Latin for
"worst game ever invented"?

86
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,074
We could play hide and seek.

87
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:14,403
But we're already having so much fun.

88
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,341
Come on, Peter, please.

89
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,885
Pretty please?

90
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:25,847
- One, two, three, four,
- What?

91
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:30,828
Five, six, seven, eight,

92
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,662
nine, ten, 11...

93
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:49,345
...24, 25, 26...

94
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,392
I was here first!

95
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:13,956
...75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80,

96
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:19,027
81, 82, 83, 84,

97
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:23,165
85, 86, 85, 86, 87, 88,

98
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,542
89, 90, 91, 92,

99
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,276
93, 94, 95...

100
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,189
Were you hiding from me?

101
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,052
No.

102
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,098
Well...

103
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,992
I just... I...

104
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,902
No. No. I just...

105
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,873
I was just...
I didn't want to scare you.

106
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,945
If you don't mind my asking...
what are you?

107
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,451
Well, I'm a...
Well, I'm a faun.

108
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:54,917
And what about you?

109
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,218
You must be some kind of
beardless dwarf?

110
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,282
I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl!

111
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:07,532
And, actually, I'm tallest in my class.

112
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,265
You mean to say that
you're a Daughter of Eve?

113
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,569
Well, my mum's name is Helen.

114
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,443
Yes, but you are in fact human.

115
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,414
Yes, of course.

116
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,712
What are you doing here?

117
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,415
Well, I was hiding in the wardrobe
in the spare room, and...

118
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,617
Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia?

119
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,160
Narnia? What's that?

120
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,789
Well, dear girl, you're in it.

121
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,265
Everything from the lamppost

122
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,792
all the way to Castle Cair Paravel
on the Eastern Ocean,

123
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,567
every stick and stone you see,

124
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,269
every icicle is Narnia.

125
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,271
This is an awfully big wardrobe.

126
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,147
War Drobe? I'm sorry.

127
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:04,154
Please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Tumnus.

128
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:08,181
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus.
I'm Lucy Pevensie.

129
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:16,263
- Oh, you shake it.
- Why?

130
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:20,163
I... I don't know.

131
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:22,502
People do it when they meet each other.

132
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:36,218
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie
from the shining city of War Drobe

133
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,223
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,

134
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:44,092
how would it be if you came
and had tea with me?

135
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:46,926
Well, thank you very much, but I...

136
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,632
I probably should be getting back.

137
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:55,332
It's only just around the corner.
And there'll be a glorious fire

138
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,899
with toast and tea and cakes.

139
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,469
And, perhaps, we'll even
break into the sardines.

140
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,749
- I don't know.
- Come on.

141
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:09,981
It's not every day
that I get to make a new friend.

142
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:15,493
Well, I suppose I could come
for a little while.

143
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,959
If you have sardines.

144
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,759
By the bucketload.

145
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,171
You all right?

146
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,910
Well, here we are.

147
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:45,212
Come along.

148
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,526
- After you.
- May I help you with that?

149
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:55,964
Thank you very much.

150
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,848
Now, that... that is my father.

151
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,249
He has a nice face.

152
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:21,481
He looks a lot like you.

153
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,657
No.

154
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:27,664
No, I'm not very much
like him at all, really.

155
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,132
My father's fighting in the war.

156
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,864
My father went away to war too.

157
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,037
But that was a long, long time ago.

158
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:44,280
- Before this dreadful winter.
- Winter's not all bad.

159
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,877
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

160
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,847
- And Christmas!
- Not here.

161
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:57,884
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas
in a hundred years.

162
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,729
What? No presents for a hundred years?

163
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,268
Always winter, never Christmas.

164
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,237
It's been a long winter.

165
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:11,431
But you would have loved Narnia
in summer.

166
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,806
We fauns danced
with the dryads all night,

167
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,679
and, you know, we never got tired.

168
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:24,878
And music. Oh, such music!

169
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,360
Would... would you
like to hear some now?

170
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:32,987
Yes, please.

171
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,269
Now, are you familiar

172
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:44,240
- with any Narnian lullabies?
- Sorry, no.

173
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,470
Well, that's good.

174
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:51,671
Because this... probably
won't sound anything like one.

175
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,262
- Oh, I should go.
- It's too late for that now.

176
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:23,373
I'm such a terrible faun.

177
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,077
Oh, no.

178
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,911
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.

179
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:35,578
Then I'm afraid you've had
a very poor sampling.

180
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:40,182
No. You can't have done
anything that bad.

181
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:46,393
It's not something I have done,
Lucy Pevensie.

182
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,092
It's something I am doing.

183
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,896
What are you doing?

184
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,570
I'm kidnapping you.

185
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,102
It was the White Witch.

186
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:01,339
She's the one who makes it always
winter, always cold. She gave orders.

187
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,746
If any of us ever find a human
wandering in the woods,

188
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,182
we're supposed to turn it over to her.

189
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:10,853
But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't.

190
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,922
I thought you were my friend.

191
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:26,328
Now. She may already know you're here.

192
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,100
The woods are full of her spies.

193
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,645
Even some of the trees are on her side.

194
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:41,278
Can you find your way back from here?

195
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:43,946
- I think so.
- All right.

196
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,454
Will you be all right?

197
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,528
Hey, hey, hey.

198
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,229
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

199
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,797
Here.

200
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:09,070
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

201
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:17,552
No matter what happens, Lucy Pevensie,
I am glad to have met you.

202
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,716
You've made me feel warmer
than I've felt in a hundred years.

203
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,951
Now go.

204
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:25,586
Go!

205
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,476
...99, 100.

206
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,908
Ready or not, here I come!

207
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,243
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!

208
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,714
Shut up! He's coming!

209
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,890
You know, I'm not sure you two
have quite got the idea of this game.

210
00:24:52,957 --> 00:24:55,482
Weren't you wondering where I was?

211
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,757
That's the point.
That was why he was seeking you.

212
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,195
Does this mean I win?

213
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,426
I don't think Lucy
wants to play anymore.

214
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,991
I've been gone for hours.

215
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,376
Lucy, the only wood in here
is the back of the wardrobe.

216
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:26,651
One game at a time, Lu.
We don't all have your imagination.

217
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,690
But I wasn't imagining!

218
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,494
That's enough, Lucy.

219
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,001
I wouldn't lie about this!

220
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,798
Well, I believe you.

221
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:43,129
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

222
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,768
Didn't I tell you about
the field in the cupboards?

223
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,005
Will you just stop?

224
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,707
You just have to make
everything worse, don't you?

225
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,717
- It was just a joke!
- When are you gonna learn to grow up?

226
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:57,084
Shut up! You think you're Dad,
but you're not!

227
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,150
Well, that was nicely handled.

228
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:09,329
But... it really was there.

229
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,460
Susan's right, Lucy.

230
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,471
That's enough.

231
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:52,099
Lucy.

232
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,997
Where are you?

233
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,741
Lucy.

234
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,021
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.

235
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,690
Lucy?

236
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,168
Lucy?

237
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,231
Lucy!

238
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,591
Lucy.

239
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:53,496
Where are you?

240
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,862
Lucy.

241
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,403
I think I believe you now.

242
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,891
Lucy.

243
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,010
Lucy?

244
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,074
- Leave me alone!
- What is it now, Ginarrbrik?

245
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,413
Make him let me go!
I didn't do anything wrong!

246
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,885
How dare you address
the Queen of Narnia?

247
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,819
I didn't know!

248
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,949
- You will know her better hereafter!
- Wait!

249
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,597
What is your name, Son of Adam?

250
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,939
Edmund.

251
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:48,104
And how, Edmund,
did you come to enter my dominion?

252
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:52,172
I'm not sure.
I was just following my sister.

253
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,913
- Your sister? How many are you?
- Four.

254
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,751
Lucy's the only one
that's been here before.

255
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,759
She said she met some faun
called Tumnus.

256
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,887
Peter and Susan didn't believe her.
I didn't either.

257
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:10,662
Edmund, you look so cold.
Will you come and sit with me?

258
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,519
Now, how about something hot to drink?

259
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,418
Yes, please, Your Majesty.

260
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,207
Your drink, sire.

261
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:56,405
How did you do that?

262
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,414
I can make anything you like.

263
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:01,383
Can you make me taller?

264
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,112
Anything you'd like to eat.

265
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:07,751
Turkish delight?

266
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,048
Edmund?

267
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,385
I would very much like to meet
the rest of your family.

268
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,425
Why?

269
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,359
They're nothing special.

270
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:50,424
Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly
as delightful as you are.

271
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:56,030
But you see, Edmund,
I have no children of my own.

272
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,075
And you are exactly the sort of boy

273
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:03,478
who I could see, one day,
becoming Prince of Narnia.

274
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:06,112
Maybe even King.

275
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,186
Really?

276
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,445
Of course, you'd have
to bring your family.

277
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,349
Do you mean,
Peter would be king too?

278
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,022
No! No, no.

279
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,790
But a king needs servants.

280
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,537
I guess I could bring 'em.

281
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:35,004
Beyond these woods,
you see those two hills?

282
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,242
My house is right between them.

283
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,284
You'd love it there, Edmund.

284
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,685
It has whole rooms
simply stuffed with Turkish delight.

285
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:48,020
- Couldn't I have some more now?
- No!

286
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,960
Don't want to ruin your appetite.

287
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,693
Besides, you and I are going to be
seeing each other again very soon.

288
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:59,930
I hope so, Your Majesty.

289
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:05,208
Until then, dear one.
I'm gonna miss you.

290
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,584
Edmund?

291
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:23,589
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!

292
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,323
Isn't it wonderful?

293
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:30,629
- Where have you been?
- With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine.

294
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:34,569
The White Witch hasn't found out
anything about him meeting me.

295
00:34:34,638 --> 00:34:36,037
The White Witch?

296
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:40,777
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia,
but she really isn't.

297
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,543
Are you all right? You look awful.

298
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:49,552
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, it's freezing.

299
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,283
- How do we get out of here?
- Come on.

300
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,984
This way.

301
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,652
Peter, Peter, wake up!
Peter, wake up!

302
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,630
It's there! It's really there!

303
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,566
- Lucy, what are you talking about?
- Narnia!

304
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,001
It's all in the wardrobe
like I told you!

305
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:10,165
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.
- But I haven't!

306
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:14,234
I saw Mr. Tumnus again!
And this time Edmund went too.

307
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,714
You... You saw the faun?

308
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:27,520
Well, he didn't actually
go there with me.

309
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:30,486
He...

310
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,590
What were you doing, Edmund?

311
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,229
I was just playing along.

312
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,929
I'm sorry, Peter.

313
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,441
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

314
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:48,444
but you know what little children
are like these days.

315
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:52,141
They just don't know
when to stop pretending.

316
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:13,630
You children are one shenanigan
shy of sleepin' in the stable!

317
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:20,666
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them
you were not to be disturbed.

318
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:24,077
It's all right, Mrs. Macready.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

319
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:28,640
But first of all, I think this one
is in need of a little hot chocolate.

320
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,550
Come along, dear.

321
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:43,792
You seem to have upset the delicate
internal balance of my housekeeper.

322
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,701
We're very sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

323
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,170
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

324
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,334
- The weeping girl.
- Yes, sir.

325
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:55,378
- She's upset.
- Hence the weeping.

326
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,879
It's nothing.

327
00:36:56,947 --> 00:36:59,848
- We can handle it.
- Oh, I can see that.

328
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,449
She thinks she's found a magical land.

329
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,080
In the upstairs wardrobe.

330
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,089
What did you say?

331
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:15,457
The wardrobe, upstairs.

332
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,001
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

333
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:20,263
She won't stop going on about it.

334
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:24,732
- What was it like?
- Like talking to a lunatic.

335
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:27,299
No, no, no, not her. The forest.

336
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,836
- You're not saying you believe her?
- You don't?

337
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,382
But of course not.

338
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:34,542
I mean, logically, it's impossible.

339
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,919
What do they teach
in schools these days?

340
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:39,922
Edmund said they were only pretending.

341
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,049
He's usually the more
truthful one, is he?

342
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:46,028
No. This would be the first time.

343
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:48,189
Well, if she's not mad
and she's not lying,

344
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:52,793
then logically we must
assume she's telling the truth.

345
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,434
You're saying that we
should just believe her?

346
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:02,071
She's your sister, isn't she?
You're her family.

347
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:07,047
You might just try acting like one.

348
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:11,612
Peter winds up,
poised to take yet another wicket!

349
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:17,252
Wake up, Dolly Daydream.

350
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,256
Why can't we play hide and seek again?

351
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,959
I thought you said it was a kid's game.

352
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:27,436
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.

353
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:30,234
It's not like there isn't air inside.

354
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,637
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

355
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:53,595
- Well done, Ed.
- You bowled it!

356
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,599
- What on earth is goin' on?
- The Macready!

357
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,294
Come on!

358
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:07,777
No, no, back, back, back!

359
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:38,072
- Come on!
- You've got to be joking.

360
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,480
Get back!

361
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,524
- My toe!
- I'm not on your toe!

362
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:57,424
- Move back.
- Will you stop shoving?

363
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:12,373
Lmpossible.

364
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,012
Don't worry.

365
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,572
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

366
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,813
I don't suppose saying we're sorry

367
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:26,185
- would quite cover it.
- No. It wouldn't.

368
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,392
But that might!

369
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:43,036
Stop it!

370
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:46,105
You little liar.

371
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:50,408
- You didn't believe her, either.
- Apologize to Lucy.

372
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:55,480
- Say you're sorry.
- All right! I'm sorry.

373
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,520
That's all right.

374
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,580
Some children just don't know
when to stop pretending.

375
00:41:00,657 --> 00:41:02,124
Oh, very funny.

376
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,057
Maybe we should go back.

377
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,620
But shouldn't we at least
take a look around?

378
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,427
I think Lucy should decide.

379
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:14,198
I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus!

380
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,466
Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is.

381
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,908
But we can't go hiking
in the snow dressed like this.

382
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:21,967
No.

383
00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:27,544
But I'm sure the professor
wouldn't mind us using these.

384
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:31,952
Anyway, if you think about it logically,

385
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,422
we're not even taking them
out of the wardrobe.

386
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:37,654
- But that's a girl's coat!
- I know.

387
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,969
...lots and lots of lovely food,
and we'll have lots and lots of...

388
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,479
Lu?

389
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,815
Lucy!

390
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:54,498
Who would do something like this?

391
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:15,146
"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged

392
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:19,321
with High Treason
against Her lmperial Majesty,

393
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,365
Jadis, Queen of Narnia,

394
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:25,731
for comforting her enemies
and fraternizing with humans.

395
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:29,260
Signed Maugrim,
Captain of the Secret Police.

396
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,466
Long Live the Queen."

397
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,974
All right.
Now we really should go back.

398
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,707
But what about Mr. Tumnus?

399
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,648
If he was arrested just
for being with a human,

400
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:44,619
- I don't think there's much we can do.
- You don't understand, do you?

401
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:47,949
I'm the human.

402
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,459
She must have found out he helped me.

403
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:54,088
- Maybe we could call the police.
- These are the police.

404
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,394
Don't worry, Lu.
We'll think of something.

405
00:43:56,466 --> 00:43:58,331
Why?

406
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,596
I mean, he's a criminal.

407
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:08,907
Did that bird just "psst" us?

408
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,651
Lt... It's a beaver.

409
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,589
Here, boy.

410
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,657
Here, boy.

411
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,872
I ain't gonna smell it,
if that's what you want.

412
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,708
Sorry.

413
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,740
Lucy Pevensie?

414
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:23,877
Yes?

415
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,164
That's the hankie I gave to Mr. Tum...

416
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,633
Tumnus. He got it to me
just before they took him.

417
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,101
Is he all right?

418
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:42,905
Further in.

419
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:47,709
- What are you doing?
- She's right.

420
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,746
How do we know we can trust him?

421
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,176
He said he knows the faun.

422
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:56,242
He's a beaver.
He shouldn't be saying anything!

423
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,048
Everything all right?

424
00:45:58,121 --> 00:46:00,419
Yes. We were just talking.

425
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,550
That's better left for safer quarters.

426
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,755
He means the trees.

427
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:25,643
Come on. We don't want to be
caught out here after nightfall.

428
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:42,359
Blimey! Looks like the old girl
has got the kettle on.

429
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,127
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.

430
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,533
- It's lovely.
- It's merely a trifle.

431
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:49,071
Still plenty to do.
Ain't quite finished it yet.

432
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,232
It'll look the business
when it is, though.

433
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:56,209
Beaver, is that you?
I've been worried sick!

434
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:59,009
If I find you've been
out with Badger again, I...

435
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,516
Well, those aren't badgers.

436
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:08,251
Oh, I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

437
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:12,562
Look at my fur. You couldn't
give me ten minutes warning?

438
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,189
I'd have given a week
if I thought it would've helped.

439
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,533
Oh, come inside, and we'll see
if we can't get you some food,

440
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:23,164
and some civilized company.

441
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,405
Now, careful. Watch your step.

442
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,068
Excuse the mess.

443
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:31,205
Can't get Mr. Beaver
to get out of his chair.

444
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:38,012
Enjoyin' the scenery, are we?

445
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:44,521
Isn't there anything
we can do to help Tumnus?

446
00:47:44,594 --> 00:47:47,688
They'll have taken him to the Witch's.
You know what they say.

447
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:51,632
There's few that go through
them gates that come out again.

448
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:54,192
Fish 'n' chips?

449
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:58,433
But there is hope, dear. Lots of hope.

450
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:01,909
Oh, yeah,
there's a right bit more than hope!

451
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,747
Aslan is on the move.

452
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:14,018
Who's Aslan?

453
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,990
Who's Aslan?

454
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,052
You cheeky little blighter.

455
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,062
What?

456
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:29,060
- You don't know, do you?
- We haven't exactly been here long.

457
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,539
Well, he's only the king
of the whole wood.

458
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:35,169
The top geezer.
The real King of Narnia.

459
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:39,181
- He's been away for a long while.
- But he's just got back!

460
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,047
And he's waitin' for you
near the Stone Table!

461
00:48:42,118 --> 00:48:45,178
- He's waiting for us?
- You're bloomin' joking!

462
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,849
They don't even know about the prophecy!

463
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:51,758
- Well, then...
- Look.

464
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:54,023
Aslan's return,

465
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,396
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

466
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,594
it's all happening because of you!

467
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:03,070
- You're blaming us?
- No! Not blaming.

468
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:07,007
- Thanking you.
- There's a prophecy.

469
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,978
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

470
00:49:10,046 --> 00:49:13,106
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

471
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,845
the evil time will be over and done."

472
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,251
- That doesn't really rhyme.
- I know it don't.

473
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:20,619
You're kinda missin' the point!

474
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:23,124
It has long been foretold

475
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,923
that two Sons of Adam
and two Daughters of Eve

476
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:31,263
will defeat the White Witch
and restore peace to Narnia.

477
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,161
And you think we're the ones?

478
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:38,264
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's
already fitted out your army.

479
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:40,309
- Our army?
- Mum sent us away

480
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:43,244
so we wouldn't get caught up in a war.

481
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,812
I think you've made a mistake.

482
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:49,784
- We're not heroes.
- We're from Finchley.

483
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:55,116
Thank you for your hospitality.

484
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:59,721
- But we really have to go.
- No, you can't just leave!

485
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:03,459
He's right. We have to help Mr. Tumnus.

486
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,058
It's out of our hands.

487
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,569
I'm sorry,

488
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,868
but it's time the four of us
were getting home. Ed?

489
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,105
Ed?

490
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,514
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You may not have to.

491
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:23,609
Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before?

492
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,677
Hurry!

493
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,696
- Edmund!
- They'll hear you!

494
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:17,032
No!

495
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,541
- Get off!
- You're playing into her hands.

496
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:22,043
- We can't just let him go!
- He's our brother!

497
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:25,172
He's the bait!
The Witch wants all four of you!

498
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:29,150
- Why?
- To stop the prophecy from coming true.

499
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,618
To kill you!

500
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,862
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

501
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:46,993
None of this would have happened
if you had listened to me!

502
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,300
- You knew this would happen.
- I didn't know.

503
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:52,000
Which is why we should
have left while we could!

504
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,099
Stop it!

505
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:58,010
- This isn't going to help Edmund.
- She's right.

506
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:01,244
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

507
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,546
Then take us to him.

508
00:53:14,657 --> 00:53:17,683
Be still, stranger,
or you'll never move again.

509
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,889
- Who are you?
- I'm Edmund!

510
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,592
I met the Queen in the woods!
She told me to come back here!

511
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:25,133
I'm a Son of Adam!

512
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:30,233
My apologies,
fortunate favorite of the queen.

513
00:53:30,306 --> 00:53:33,639
Or else, not so fortunate.

514
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,745
Right this way.

515
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,667
Wait here.

516
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,105
Like it?

517
00:54:44,747 --> 00:54:48,114
Yes, Your Majesty.

518
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,680
I thought you might.

519
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:56,453
Tell me, Edmund...

520
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,254
Are your sisters deaf?

521
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,026
No.

522
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,966
And your brother, is he...

523
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,771
...unintelligent?

524
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,273
Well, I think so. But Mum says...

525
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:16,472
Then how dare you come alone?!

526
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,276
- I tried!
- Edmund, I asked so little of you.

527
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,250
- They just don't listen to me!
- You couldn't even do that.

528
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:23,808
I did bring them halfway.

529
00:55:23,886 --> 00:55:26,582
They're at the little house at the dam
with the Beavers.

530
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,697
Well.

531
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:39,701
I suppose you're not
a total loss then, are you?

532
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:44,372
Well, I was wondering,

533
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:50,404
could I maybe have some more
Turkish delight now?

534
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:58,011
Our guest is hungry.

535
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:08,153
This way for your num-nums.

536
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,631
Maugrim?

537
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:17,298
You know what to do.

538
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:43,533
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

539
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,024
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

540
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:49,071
- Oh, right then.
- What's she doing?

541
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:51,501
Oh, you'll be thanking me later.

542
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,975
It's a long journey and Beaver
gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

543
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,568
I'm cranky now!

544
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:00,078
Take them.

545
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:07,078
- Do you think we'll need jam?
- Only if the Witch serves toast.

546
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:23,329
Hurry.

547
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:42,121
Badger and me dug this.
Comes out right near his place.

548
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:44,455
You told me it led to your mum's!

549
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:46,526
Lucy!

550
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,620
They're in the tunnel.

551
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,826
- Quick! This way.
- Hurry!

552
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:56,131
- Run!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

553
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:06,415
You should have brought a map!

554
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:09,212
There wasn't room next to the jam.

555
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:17,787
Come on, Lucy!

556
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,213
I'm so sorry, dear.

557
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,548
He was my best mate.

558
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,057
What happened here?

559
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,963
This is what becomes
of those who cross the Witch.

560
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,799
You take one more step, traitor,
and I'll chew you to splinters!

561
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,737
Relax. I'm one of the good guys.

562
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:07,867
Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot
like one of the bad ones.

563
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:10,276
An unfortunate family resemblance.

564
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,577
But we can argue breeding later.
Right now we've got to move.

565
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,484
What did you have in mind?

566
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,288
Greetings, gents.

567
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,430
- Lost something, have we?
- Don't patronize me!

568
00:59:30,499 --> 00:59:33,195
I know where your allegiance lies.

569
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,134
We're looking for some humans.

570
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,871
Humans? Here in Narnia?

571
00:59:38,941 --> 00:59:41,739
That's a valuable bit of information,
don't you think?

572
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,978
Your reward is your life.

573
00:59:46,048 --> 00:59:48,516
It's not much,

574
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:50,752
but still.

575
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,446
Where are the fugitives?

576
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:03,388
North. They ran north.

577
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,291
Smell them out.

578
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:20,504
They were helping Tumnus.
The Witch got here before I did.

579
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:24,718
Are you all right?

580
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,950
Well, I wish I could say their bark
was worse than their bite.

581
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:32,461
Stop squirming!
You're worse than Beaver on bath day.

582
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,018
Worst day of the year.

583
01:00:34,096 --> 01:00:36,621
Thank you for your kindness,

584
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,826
but that's all the cure I have time for.

585
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:39,890
You're leaving?

586
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:43,564
It has been a pleasure, My Queen,
and an honor, but time is short

587
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:46,802
and Aslan himself has asked me
to gather more troops.

588
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:49,902
- You've seen Aslan?
- What's he like?

589
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,874
Like everything we've ever heard.

590
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:57,476
You'll be glad to have him by your side
in the battle against the Witch.

591
01:00:57,553 --> 01:01:00,351
But we're not planning
on fighting any witch.

592
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,221
But surely, King Peter, the prophecy!

593
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,453
We can't go to war without you.

594
01:01:10,966 --> 01:01:13,264
We just want our brother back.

595
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,721
Lf...

596
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,994
If you're not going to eat that...

597
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,971
I'd get up, but...

598
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,006
...but my legs.

599
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,355
Mr. Tumnus.

600
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,859
What's left of him.

601
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:21,201
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.
- I'm Edmund.

602
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,603
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.

603
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,842
Is your sister all right?

604
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:35,974
Is she safe?

605
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:41,914
I don't know.

606
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,592
My police tore that dam apart.

607
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:57,064
Your little family
are nowhere to be found.

608
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,011
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!

609
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:07,375
Then you're of no further use to me.

610
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:11,818
Wait! The beaver
said something about Aslan!

611
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,715
Aslan?

612
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,085
Where?

613
01:03:22,731 --> 01:03:25,495
- I...
- He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

614
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,536
He can't be expected to know anything.

615
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:33,339
I said... where is Aslan?

616
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,874
I... I don't know.

617
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,349
I left before they said anything.

618
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,186
I wanted to see you!

619
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:51,288
Guard!

620
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:53,691
Your Majesty.

621
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:57,365
Release the faun.

622
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,305
Do you know why you're here, faun?

623
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:19,877
Because I believe in a free Narnia.

624
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,188
You're here...

625
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,751
...because he turned you in.

626
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,020
For sweeties.

627
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:39,738
Take him upstairs.

628
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:47,074
And ready my sleigh.

629
01:04:48,183 --> 01:04:50,845
Edmund misses his family.

630
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:16,767
Now, Aslan's camp
is near the Stone Table

631
01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:20,406
- just across the frozen river.
- River?

632
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:23,110
The river's been frozen solid
for a hundred years.

633
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:31,025
- It's so far.
- It's the world, dear.

634
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,958
Did you expect it to be small?

635
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:36,160
Smaller.

636
01:05:52,948 --> 01:05:55,974
When you're ready, Son of Adam.

637
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:35,053
Come on, humans!
While we're still young.

638
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:38,556
If he tells us to hurry one more time,

639
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:42,427
I'm gonna turn him
into a big, fluffy hat.

640
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,830
Hurry up! Come on!

641
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,631
- He is getting a little bossy.
- No! Behind you! It's her!

642
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:50,604
- Run! Run!
- Run!

643
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:17,095
Hurry!

644
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:21,563
Inside!

645
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,502
Dive! Dive!

646
01:07:25,974 --> 01:07:28,135
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

647
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,873
Maybe she's gone.

648
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,266
- I suppose I'll go look.
- No!

649
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,938
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.

650
01:08:05,013 --> 01:08:07,004
Well, neither are you, Beaver.

651
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:09,277
Thanks, sweetheart.

652
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:19,559
What's that? What's?

653
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,029
Come out! Come out!

654
01:08:26,101 --> 01:08:29,298
I hope you've all been good
'cause there's someone here to see you!

655
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:53,026
Merry Christmas, sir.

656
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:57,122
It certainly is, Lucy,
since you have arrived.

657
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:01,260
Look, I've put up with a lot
since I got here, but this...

658
01:09:01,336 --> 01:09:04,794
- We thought you were the Witch.
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,

659
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:10,368
but in my defense, I have been driving
one of these longer than the Witch.

660
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:13,573
I thought there was
no Christmas in Narnia.

661
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,209
No. Not for a long time.

662
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:20,619
But the hope that you have brought,
Your Majesties,

663
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:24,557
is finally starting
to weaken the Witch's power.

664
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:28,858
Still, I dare say
you could do with these.

665
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,700
Presents!

666
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,541
The juice of the fire-flower.

667
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:45,478
One drop will cure any injury.

668
01:09:48,283 --> 01:09:50,877
And though I hope
you never have to use it...

669
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:55,856
Thank you, sir,

670
01:09:55,924 --> 01:09:59,360
but I think I could be brave enough.

671
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:02,124
I'm sure you could.

672
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:04,631
But battles are ugly affairs.

673
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,071
Susan.

674
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:21,346
Trust in this bow
and it will not easily miss.

675
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:25,078
What happened
to "battles are ugly affairs"?

676
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:30,553
Though you don't seem to have
a problem making yourself heard,

677
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,652
blow on this and wherever you are,

678
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,793
help will come.

679
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:39,697
Thanks.

680
01:10:40,535 --> 01:10:42,366
Peter.

681
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:46,700
The time to use these
may be near at hand.

682
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,311
Thank you, sir.

683
01:10:57,085 --> 01:11:00,919
These are tools, not toys.

684
01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:03,219
Bear them well and wisely.

685
01:11:04,926 --> 01:11:07,622
Now, I must be off.

686
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:10,256
Winter is almost over,

687
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:14,769
and things do pile up
when you've been gone a hundred years.

688
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,301
Long live Aslan!

689
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,736
And Merry Christmas!

690
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:29,776
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

691
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:33,184
- See you next year!
- Goodbye!

692
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:35,314
Told you he was real.

693
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:40,492
He said winter was almost over.

694
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,621
You know what that means.

695
01:11:44,232 --> 01:11:46,702
No more ice.

696
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:00,011
- We need to cross, now!
- Don't beavers make dams?

697
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,312
- I'm not that fast, dear.
- Come on!

698
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:04,648
Wait! Will you think
about this for a minute?

699
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,518
- We don't have a minute.
- I'm just trying to be realistic.

700
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:11,116
No, you're trying to be smart.
As usual.

701
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:48,085
Wait. Maybe I should go first.

702
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:49,925
Maybe you should.

703
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:59,835
You've been sneaking
second helpings, haven't you?

704
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:02,468
Well, you never know
which meal's gonna be your last.

705
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,444
Especially with your cooking.

706
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:26,334
If Mum knew what we were doing...

707
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:27,800
Mum's not here.

708
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,966
Oh, no!

709
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,439
Run!

710
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:38,335
Hurry!

711
01:13:49,524 --> 01:13:51,321
- No!
- Peter!

712
01:13:51,993 --> 01:13:53,858
Put that down, boy.

713
01:13:54,529 --> 01:13:57,794
- Someone could get hurt.
- Don't worry about me!

714
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,231
Run him through!

715
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:02,998
Leave now while you can,
and your brother leaves with you.

716
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:06,040
Stop, Peter!
Maybe we should listen to him!

717
01:14:06,107 --> 01:14:07,768
Smart girl.

718
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:11,108
Don't listen to him!
Kill him! Kill him now!

719
01:14:11,179 --> 01:14:14,478
Oh, come on. This isn't your war.

720
01:14:14,549 --> 01:14:18,041
All my Queen wants is for you
to take your family and go.

721
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:20,917
Look, just because some man
in a red coat hands you a sword,

722
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:24,550
it doesn't make you a hero!
Just drop it!

723
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,220
No, Peter! Narnia needs you!

724
01:14:27,295 --> 01:14:29,593
Gut him while you still have a chance!

725
01:14:29,664 --> 01:14:33,760
What's it gonna be, Son of Adam?
I won't wait forever.

726
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:35,564
And neither will the river.

727
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:38,700
Peter!

728
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:47,846
Hold onto me!

729
01:15:49,277 --> 01:15:50,266
Lovely.

730
01:15:58,653 --> 01:16:00,712
What have you done?

731
01:16:03,124 --> 01:16:05,183
Lucy!

732
01:16:06,661 --> 01:16:08,458
Lucy!

733
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:14,928
Has anyone seen my coat?

734
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:23,477
Don't you worry, dear.

735
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:26,810
Your brother's got you
well looked after.

736
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:30,612
And I don't think you'll be
needing those coats anymore.

737
01:17:05,553 --> 01:17:09,114
It's so warm out.

738
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:15,094
I'll go and check the sleigh.

739
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:18,525
Your Majesty.

740
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,730
We found the traitor. He was rallying
your enemies near the Shuddering Woods.

741
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:26,173
Nice of you to drop in.

742
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:28,709
You were so helpful
to my wolves last night.

743
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:31,669
Perhaps you can help me now.

744
01:17:31,746 --> 01:17:35,614
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- Oh, don't waste time with flattery.

745
01:17:35,683 --> 01:17:40,211
Not to seem rude,
but I wasn't actually talking to you.

746
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:51,288
Where are the humans headed?

747
01:17:55,236 --> 01:17:59,696
Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said
something about the Stone Table,

748
01:17:59,774 --> 01:18:01,605
and that Aslan had an army there.

749
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:04,638
An army?

750
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:12,845
Thank you, Edmund.

751
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:16,413
I'm glad this creature
got to see some honesty...

752
01:18:17,725 --> 01:18:20,751
...before he dies.
- No!

753
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:34,437
Think about whose side you're on,
Edmund.

754
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:36,670
Mine...

755
01:18:38,646 --> 01:18:40,511
...or theirs.

756
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:49,423
Go on ahead. Gather the faithful.

757
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:52,783
If it's a war Aslan wants...

758
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:56,760
...it's a war he shall get.

759
01:19:57,992 --> 01:20:00,654
Why are they all staring at us?

760
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:03,162
Maybe they think you look funny.

761
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:11,933
Stop your fussing. You look lovely.

762
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:32,485
We have come to see Aslan.

763
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:19,595
Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam.

764
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:23,576
Welcome, Susan and Lucy,
Daughters of Eve.

765
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:27,240
And welcome to you, Beavers.
You have my thanks.

766
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:29,340
But where is the fourth?

767
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:33,921
That's why we're here, sir.

768
01:21:33,988 --> 01:21:35,455
We need your help.

769
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:38,651
We had a little trouble along the way.

770
01:21:38,726 --> 01:21:41,058
Our brother's been captured
by the White Witch.

771
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,996
Captured? How could this happen?

772
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:49,492
He betrayed them, Your Majesty.

773
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:53,838
- Then he has betrayed us all!
- Peace, Oreius.

774
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:55,876
I'm sure there's an explanation.

775
01:21:58,846 --> 01:22:01,110
It's my fault, really.

776
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:05,112
I was too hard on him.

777
01:22:08,589 --> 01:22:09,988
We all were.

778
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:12,756
Sir, he's our brother.

779
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:14,818
I know, dear one.

780
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:17,364
But that only makes
the betrayal all the worse.

781
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,827
This may be harder than you think.

782
01:22:28,676 --> 01:22:33,636
That is Cair Paravel,
the castle of the four thrones.

783
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:38,918
In one of which you will sit, Peter,
as High King.

784
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,954
You doubt the prophecy?

785
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:45,459
No. That's just it.

786
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:49,897
Aslan, I'm not what you all think I am.

787
01:22:49,964 --> 01:22:52,330
Peter Pevensie, formerly of Finchley.

788
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:57,504
Beaver also mentioned that you
planned on turning him into a hat.

789
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:04,636
Peter, there is a Deep Magic,

790
01:23:04,712 --> 01:23:06,373
more powerful than any of us,

791
01:23:06,447 --> 01:23:08,677
that rules over all of Narnia.

792
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:11,310
It defines right from wrong,

793
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:13,377
and governs all our destinies.

794
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:17,215
Yours... and mine.

795
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:19,753
But I couldn't even
protect my own family.

796
01:23:19,827 --> 01:23:22,022
You've brought them safely this far.

797
01:23:22,663 --> 01:23:24,528
Not all of them.

798
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:28,933
Peter, I will do what I can
to help your brother,

799
01:23:29,003 --> 01:23:32,097
but I need you to consider
what I ask of you.

800
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:36,566
I, too, want my family safe.

801
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:43,708
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

802
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:47,186
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

803
01:23:49,023 --> 01:23:53,585
Special treatment for the special boy!

804
01:23:54,762 --> 01:23:57,230
Isn't that what you wanted?

805
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:01,796
You look like Mum.

806
01:24:01,869 --> 01:24:04,804
Mum hasn't had a dress like this
since before the war.

807
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:10,109
We should bring her one back.
A whole trunk full!

808
01:24:11,345 --> 01:24:13,108
If we ever get back.

809
01:24:17,251 --> 01:24:18,775
I'm sorry I'm like that.

810
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:24,413
We used to have fun together, didn't we?

811
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:28,826
Yes. Before you got boring.

812
01:24:28,896 --> 01:24:30,329
Oh, really?

813
01:24:43,911 --> 01:24:45,344
Please don't try to run.

814
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:49,281
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

815
01:24:54,188 --> 01:24:55,587
Susan!

816
01:25:05,132 --> 01:25:06,497
Get back!

817
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,402
Peter!

818
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:12,571
Come on.

819
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:16,510
We've already been through this before.

820
01:25:16,577 --> 01:25:19,137
We both know you haven't got it in you.

821
01:25:19,213 --> 01:25:20,976
Peter! Watch out!

822
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:34,723
No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

823
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:38,357
You may think you're a king,

824
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:40,730
but you're going to die...

825
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:43,031
...like a dog!
- Look out!

826
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:45,398
Peter!

827
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,089
After him.

828
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:07,258
He'll lead you to Edmund.

829
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:13,290
Peter.

830
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:15,593
Clean your sword.

831
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:24,905
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

832
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:27,777
Knight of Narnia.

833
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:55,832
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

834
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:58,811
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send dwarfs in first.

835
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:09,686
The prisoner!

836
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,546
You're not going to kill me?

837
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:45,626
Not yet.

838
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:51,191
We have work to do.

839
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,097
Edmund!

840
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:58,294
What's done is done.

841
01:28:58,365 --> 01:29:02,461
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

842
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:12,973
Hello.

843
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:30,089
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

844
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:32,462
Get some sleep.

845
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:42,534
And Edmund...

846
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,339
...try not to wander off.

847
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:02,127
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

848
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:07,265
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

849
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:08,699
We're going home?

850
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:10,865
You are.

851
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:14,964
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

852
01:30:15,843 --> 01:30:18,334
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

853
01:30:18,412 --> 01:30:19,845
But they need us.

854
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:24,179
All four of us.

855
01:30:24,251 --> 01:30:26,151
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

856
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:28,780
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

857
01:30:29,523 --> 01:30:32,390
Which is why we have to stay.

858
01:30:34,094 --> 01:30:38,861
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

859
01:30:40,267 --> 01:30:44,067
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

860
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:52,735
I suppose that's it then.

861
01:30:55,115 --> 01:30:56,673
Where are you going?

862
01:30:58,485 --> 01:31:00,919
To get in some practice.

863
01:31:23,944 --> 01:31:27,004
Come on, Ed! Sword point up,
like Oreius showed us.

864
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:29,447
- En garde!
- Now block.

865
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:34,212
- Hey!
- Peter! Edmund!

866
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:37,084
Whoa, horsie!

867
01:31:37,558 --> 01:31:39,685
My name is Philip.

868
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,557
Sorry.

869
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:44,223
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

870
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:46,897
She's on her way here.

871
01:31:47,968 --> 01:31:50,104
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

872
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:51,696
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

873
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:56,038
- Go away, Witch!
- Empress of the Lone Islands!

874
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:59,736
You don't belong here! Go away!

875
01:32:23,537 --> 01:32:26,131
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

876
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:32,411
His offense was not against you.

877
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:36,212
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

878
01:32:36,283 --> 01:32:39,775
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

879
01:32:39,853 --> 01:32:41,980
I was there when it was written.

880
01:32:43,757 --> 01:32:47,784
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

881
01:32:49,396 --> 01:32:52,297
His blood is my property.

882
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:53,594
Try and take him then.

883
01:32:57,404 --> 01:33:02,103
Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right...

884
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,506
...little King?

885
01:33:07,047 --> 01:33:10,949
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

886
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:14,317
all of Narnia will be overturned

887
01:33:14,388 --> 01:33:17,516
and perish in fire and water.

888
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:20,685
That boy will die

889
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:22,752
on the Stone Table...

890
01:33:26,266 --> 01:33:28,427
...as is tradition.

891
01:33:30,804 --> 01:33:33,295
You dare not refuse me.

892
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:35,173
Enough.

893
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:40,475
I shall talk with you alone.

894
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:36,667
She has renounced her claim
on the Son of Adam's blood.

895
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:41,572
How do I know your promise will be kept?

896
01:35:34,561 --> 01:35:36,153
Susan!

897
01:36:27,147 --> 01:36:29,980
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

898
01:36:32,486 --> 01:36:34,818
We couldn't sleep.

899
01:36:35,889 --> 01:36:38,187
Please, Aslan.

900
01:36:38,725 --> 01:36:40,420
Couldn't we come with you?

901
01:36:40,494 --> 01:36:43,622
I would be glad of the company
for a while.

902
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:47,130
Thank you.

903
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:12,820
It is time.

904
01:37:12,893 --> 01:37:16,329
From here, I must go on alone.

905
01:37:16,396 --> 01:37:17,829
But Aslan...

906
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:21,425
You have to trust me.
For this must be done.

907
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:23,765
Thank you, Susan.

908
01:37:23,837 --> 01:37:26,271
Thank you, Lucy.

909
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,399
And farewell.

910
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:37,671
Behold. The great lion.

911
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:05,331
Do you want some milk?

912
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:08,532
Why doesn't he fight back?

913
01:39:10,243 --> 01:39:11,335
Bind him!

914
01:39:12,979 --> 01:39:15,971
Tie him up! Get him!

915
01:39:21,688 --> 01:39:23,315
Wait!

916
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:26,416
Let him first be shaved.

917
01:39:48,382 --> 01:39:49,940
Bring him to me.

918
01:40:51,044 --> 01:40:53,774
You know, Aslan,

919
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:56,111
I'm a little disappointed in you.

920
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:02,114
Did you honestly think by all this
that you could save the human traitor?

921
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:08,092
You are giving me your life

922
01:41:08,161 --> 01:41:10,129
and saving no one.

923
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:14,967
So much for love.

924
01:41:23,844 --> 01:41:26,039
Tonight...

925
01:41:26,713 --> 01:41:31,309
...the Deep Magic will be appeased!

926
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:37,551
But tomorrow,

927
01:41:38,959 --> 01:41:42,986
we will take Narnia

928
01:41:43,063 --> 01:41:45,395
forever!

929
01:41:52,272 --> 01:41:54,433
In that knowledge,

930
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:57,409
despair...

931
01:42:06,253 --> 01:42:09,017
...and die!

932
01:42:27,574 --> 01:42:29,508
The Great Cat...

933
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:31,737
...is dead!

934
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:38,008
General.

935
01:42:38,084 --> 01:42:39,745
Prepare your troops for battle.

936
01:42:44,124 --> 01:42:46,558
However short it may be.

937
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:36,869
It's too late.

938
01:43:36,943 --> 01:43:39,275
He's gone.

939
01:43:59,132 --> 01:44:01,862
He must have known what he was doing.

940
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:38,596
Get away! Get away, all of you!

941
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:41,732
No. Look.

942
01:45:02,562 --> 01:45:05,224
We have to tell the others.

943
01:45:05,732 --> 01:45:09,395
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

944
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:11,733
They need to know.

945
01:45:17,977 --> 01:45:20,036
The trees.

946
01:46:04,224 --> 01:46:06,215
Be still, my Princes.

947
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:11,293
I bring grave news from your sisters.

948
01:46:26,312 --> 01:46:28,143
She's right.

949
01:46:31,317 --> 01:46:33,182
He's gone.

950
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:40,786
Then you'll have to lead us.

951
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:48,198
Peter, there's an army out there
and it's ready to follow you.

952
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:51,795
- I can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

953
01:46:54,774 --> 01:46:56,742
And so do I.

954
01:47:04,417 --> 01:47:08,376
The Witch's army is nearing, sire.
What are your orders?

955
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:57,596
They come, Your Highness, in numbers
and weapons far greater than our own.

956
01:47:57,670 --> 01:47:59,831
Numbers do not win a battle.

957
01:47:59,906 --> 01:48:03,740
No. But I bet they help.

958
01:49:33,766 --> 01:49:36,291
I have no interest in prisoners.

959
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:38,200
Kill them all.

960
01:50:27,754 --> 01:50:29,221
Go on!

961
01:50:35,428 --> 01:50:38,158
Look to the sky!

962
01:51:05,057 --> 01:51:06,991
Are you with me?

963
01:51:08,194 --> 01:51:09,559
To the death.

964
01:51:12,698 --> 01:51:17,328
For Narnia and for Aslan!

965
01:51:21,407 --> 01:51:23,068
Go!

966
01:51:23,743 --> 01:51:26,473
Go! For Aslan!

967
01:52:58,638 --> 01:52:59,627
We should go.

968
01:53:06,145 --> 01:53:07,976
I'm so cold.

969
01:53:34,206 --> 01:53:36,037
Susan!

970
01:53:52,191 --> 01:53:54,250
Where's Aslan?

971
01:53:55,695 --> 01:53:57,595
What have they done?

972
01:54:07,707 --> 01:54:09,265
Aslan!

973
01:54:17,483 --> 01:54:19,883
But we saw the knife. The Witch.

974
01:54:19,952 --> 01:54:23,479
If the Witch knew
the true meaning of sacrifice,

975
01:54:23,556 --> 01:54:26,889
she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic differently.

976
01:54:26,959 --> 01:54:29,587
That when a willing victim
who has committed no treachery

977
01:54:29,662 --> 01:54:31,892
is killed in a traitor's stead,

978
01:54:31,964 --> 01:54:35,229
the Stone Table will crack

979
01:54:35,301 --> 01:54:38,964
and even death itself will turn
backwards.

980
01:54:39,038 --> 01:54:41,563
We sent the news that you were dead.

981
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:43,835
Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.

982
01:54:43,909 --> 01:54:45,308
We have to help them.

983
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:49,178
We will, dear one, but not alone.

984
01:54:49,582 --> 01:54:51,277
Climb on my back.

985
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:54,080
We have far to go
and little time to get there.

986
01:54:54,153 --> 01:54:56,883
And you may want to cover your ears.

987
01:55:17,777 --> 01:55:19,768
Fire!

988
01:55:39,432 --> 01:55:41,263
Yes!

989
01:55:53,512 --> 01:55:56,447
Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

990
01:55:58,117 --> 01:56:00,347
That's the signal. Come on!

991
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:09,593
Where are we going?

992
01:56:19,839 --> 01:56:21,431
Hang on!

993
01:56:22,675 --> 01:56:24,233
Fall back!

994
01:56:26,078 --> 01:56:27,545
Go on, fall back!

995
01:57:04,216 --> 01:57:05,547
Stop!

996
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:19,915
Susan, this is...

997
01:59:19,985 --> 01:59:21,543
Mr. Tumnus!

998
01:59:23,088 --> 01:59:26,353
Come, we must hurry
and search the castle.

999
01:59:26,425 --> 01:59:29,189
Peter will need everyone we can find.

1000
01:59:55,821 --> 01:59:58,415
Edmund! There's too many!

1001
01:59:58,490 --> 02:00:00,048
Get out of here!

1002
02:00:00,125 --> 02:00:03,060
Get the girls and get them home!

1003
02:00:05,531 --> 02:00:08,056
You heard him! Let's go!

1004
02:00:27,619 --> 02:00:29,246
Peter said get out of here!

1005
02:00:29,321 --> 02:00:31,152
Peter's not king yet.

1006
02:02:08,187 --> 02:02:09,745
Impossible!

1007
02:03:24,263 --> 02:03:25,594
It is finished.

1008
02:03:27,099 --> 02:03:29,465
- Peter!
- Peter!

1009
02:03:35,073 --> 02:03:37,200
Where's Edmund?

1010
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:50,585
Edmund!

1011
02:04:43,208 --> 02:04:45,676
When are you gonna learn
to do as you're told?

1012
02:06:21,073 --> 02:06:24,042
To the glistening Eastern Sea,

1013
02:06:24,109 --> 02:06:28,603
I give you Queen Lucy, the Valiant.

1014
02:06:53,371 --> 02:06:55,805
To the great Western Wood,

1015
02:06:55,874 --> 02:07:00,208
King Edmund, the Just.

1016
02:07:01,313 --> 02:07:04,544
To the radiant Southern Sun,

1017
02:07:05,617 --> 02:07:09,348
Queen Susan, the Gentle.

1018
02:07:10,155 --> 02:07:13,352
And to the clear Northern Sky,

1019
02:07:13,425 --> 02:07:17,122
I give you King Peter,

1020
02:07:17,195 --> 02:07:19,527
the Magnificent.

1021
02:07:22,968 --> 02:07:25,937
Once a King or Queen of Narnia,

1022
02:07:26,004 --> 02:07:29,235
always a King or Queen.

1023
02:07:29,307 --> 02:07:31,070
May your wisdom grace us

1024
02:07:31,143 --> 02:07:34,271
until the stars rain down
from the heavens.

1025
02:07:34,346 --> 02:07:36,712
Long live King Peter!

1026
02:07:36,782 --> 02:07:39,444
Long live King Edmund!

1027
02:07:39,518 --> 02:07:42,078
Long live Queen Susan!

1028
02:07:42,154 --> 02:07:45,521
Long live Queen Lucy!

1029
02:08:09,748 --> 02:08:11,409
Don't worry.

1030
02:08:13,385 --> 02:08:15,353
We'll see him again.

1031
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:19,015
- When?
- In time.

1032
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:23,891
One day he'll be here
and the next he won't.

1033
02:08:25,697 --> 02:08:27,631
But you mustn't press him.

1034
02:08:28,466 --> 02:08:31,492
After all, he's not a tame lion.

1035
02:08:32,137 --> 02:08:34,401
No.

1036
02:08:34,472 --> 02:08:36,406
But he is good.

1037
02:08:37,142 --> 02:08:38,769
Here.

1038
02:08:40,378 --> 02:08:42,642
You need it more than I do.

1039
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:40,531
Are you all right, Philip?

1040
02:09:40,605 --> 02:09:42,903
I'm not as young as I once was.

1041
02:09:45,410 --> 02:09:47,241
Come on, Ed.

1042
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:50,671
- Catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

1043
02:09:50,749 --> 02:09:53,115
- What did he say, Susan?
- "Wait in the castle.

1044
02:09:53,184 --> 02:09:55,345
I'll get the stag myself."

1045
02:10:00,725 --> 02:10:02,556
What's this?

1046
02:10:08,066 --> 02:10:10,466
It seems familiar.

1047
02:10:12,904 --> 02:10:14,838
As if from a dream.

1048
02:10:14,906 --> 02:10:16,965
Or a dream of a dream.

1049
02:10:20,245 --> 02:10:22,543
Spare Oom.

1050
02:10:25,383 --> 02:10:27,943
- Lucy!
- Not again.

1051
02:10:29,654 --> 02:10:32,145
- Lu?
- Come on!

1052
02:10:43,134 --> 02:10:44,692
These aren't branches.

1053
02:10:47,272 --> 02:10:50,332
- They're coats.
- Susan, you're on my foot!

1054
02:10:50,408 --> 02:10:52,603
Peter, move off!

1055
02:10:52,677 --> 02:10:54,838
- Stop shoving.
- Stop it!

1056
02:10:54,913 --> 02:10:56,744
I'm not on your toe!

1057
02:11:14,566 --> 02:11:16,158
There you are.

1058
02:11:18,737 --> 02:11:21,501
What were you all doing in the wardrobe?

1059
02:11:23,408 --> 02:11:26,206
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

1060
02:11:31,983 --> 02:11:34,052
Try me.

1061
02:12:36,347 --> 02:12:39,111
I don't think
you'll get back in that way.

1062
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:46,884
You see... I've already tried.

1063
02:12:48,926 --> 02:12:50,917
Will we ever go back?

1064
02:12:50,995 --> 02:12:52,690
Oh, I expect so.

1065
02:12:53,831 --> 02:12:56,800
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

1066
02:12:59,337 --> 02:13:00,964
All the same...

1067
02:13:01,038 --> 02:13:03,563
...best to keep your eyes open.
