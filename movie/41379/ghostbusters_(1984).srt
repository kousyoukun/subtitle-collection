1
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:49,960
I'm gonna turn over the next card.
I want you to concentrate.

2
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,963
I want you to tell me
what you think it is.

3
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,845
Square.

4
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,222
Good guess. But wrong.

5
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,525
Clear your head.

6
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,906
All right. Tell me what you think it is.

7
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,867
Is it a star?

8
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:26,705
It is a star. Very good. That's great.

9
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,625
Okay. All right.

10
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,795
Think hard. What is it?

11
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,465
Circle.

12
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,552
Close. But definitely wrong.

13
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,348
Okay.

14
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,268
-All right. Ready?
-Yeah.

15
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,811
All right.

16
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,148
What is it?

17
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,860
Come on.

18
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,988
Figure eight.

19
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,245
Incredible. That's 5 for 5.
You can't see these, can you?

20
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,374
-You're not cheating me, are you?
-No, I swear they're just coming to me.

21
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,668
Okay.

22
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,298
-Nervous?
-Yes. I don't like this.

23
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:23,720
You only have 75 more to go, okay?
What's this one?

24
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,226
It's a couple of wavy lines.

25
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,188
-Sorry. This isn't your lucky day.
-l know.

26
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,776
Wait--

27
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm getting a little tired of this!

28
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,909
You volunteered, didn't you?
We're paying, aren't we?

29
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,329
Yeah, but l didn't know you were
gonna give me electric shocks!

30
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,540
What are you trying
to prove here, anyway?

31
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,669
I'm studying the effect of negative
reinforcement on ESP ability.

32
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,298
The effect? l'll tell you what
the effect is. It's pissing me off!

33
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,300
Well, then maybe my theory is correct!

34
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,262
-You can keep the 5 bucks. l've had it.
-l will, mister!

35
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,935
You may as well get used to that.

36
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,857
It's the kind of resentment that your
ability will provoke in some people.

37
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,277
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?

38
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,072
You're no fluke, Jennifer.

39
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,700
This is it. This is definitely it!

40
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,244
Did those UV lenses come in
for the video camera?

41
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,956
And that blank tape, I need it,
the one you erased yesterday.

42
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,251
-Will you excuse me for a second?
-Sure.

43
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,922
I'm right in the middle
of something, Ray.

44
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,758
I need more time with this subject.

45
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,427
Could you come back in an hour,
hour and a half?

46
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,596
Peter, at 1 :40 p.m...

47
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,183
...at the main branch of The New York
Public Library on Fifth Avenue...

48
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:56,063
...1 0 people witnessed a free-floating,
full-torso, vaporous apparition.

49
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,398
It blew books off shelves
from 20 feet away...

50
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,942
...and scared the socks
off some poor librarian.

51
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,320
I'm very excited. l'm very pleased.

52
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,407
I want you to get right down there,
check it out, and get back to me.

53
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,410
You're coming with us on this one.
Spengler went down there.

54
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,622
He took PKE valences,
went right off the top of the scale.

55
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,126
Buried the needle.
We're close on this one. l can feel it.

56
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,716
I can feel it. We're very, very close.

57
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,930
I have to go now, Jennifer, but l'd
like to work with you some more.

58
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,265
Perhaps you could come back
this evening at--?

59
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,809
Eight o'clock?

60
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:38,855
I was just going to say, "8:00?"
You are a legitimate phenomenon.

61
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,235
As a friend, I must say...

62
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,363
...you've finally gone around the bend
on this ghost business.

63
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,533
You guys have been meeting
every schizo in the five boroughs...

64
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,702
...who says he has a paranormal
experience. What have you seen?

65
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:58,208
You forget, l was there at an undersea,
unexplained mass sponge migration.

66
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:03,255
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated
about a foot and a half.

67
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,179
-You're here.
-Yeah, what have you got?

68
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,558
This is big, this is very big.
There's definitely something here.

69
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,478
Egon, this reminds me of the time you
tried to drill a hole through your head.

70
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,689
-Remember that?
-That would've worked if--

71
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,775
I'm Roger Delacorte.
Are you the men from the university?

72
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,529
Yes. l'm Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Stantz. Egon.

73
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,700
Thank you for coming. l hope we
can clear this up quickly and quietly.

74
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:36,204
Let's not rush things. We don't
even know what you have yet.

75
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,707
I don't remember seeing any legs...

76
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,043
...but it definitely had arms,
because it reached out for me.

77
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,337
Arms? l can't wait
to get a look at this.

78
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,299
Alice, l'll ask you a couple
of standard questions, okay?

79
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,801
Have you or any member
of your family...

80
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:54,055
...ever been diagnosed schizophrenic,
mentally incompetent?

81
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,976
My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

82
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,938
I'd call that a big yes.

83
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,401
Are you habitually using drugs,
stimulants, alcohol?

84
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,863
-No.
-No, no. Just asking.

85
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,533
Are you, Alice,
menstruating right now?

86
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:18,872
-What has that got to do with it?
-Back off, man. l'm a scientist.

87
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,167
Ray, it's moving. Come on.

88
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,652
Look!

89
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:58,119
-This is hot, Ray.
-Symmetrical book-stacking.

90
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,207
Just like the Philadelphia
mass turbulence of 1 947.

91
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,628
You're right. No human being
would stack books like this.

92
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,715
Listen! Do you smell something?

93
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,310
Talk about telekinetic activity.
Look at this mess.

94
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,522
Raymond, look at this.

95
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,233
Ectoplasmic residue.

96
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,487
-Venkman, get a sample of this.
-lt's the real thing.

97
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,990
Somebody blows their nose,
and you wanna keep it?

98
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,825
I'd like to analyse it.

99
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,954
-There's more over here.
-l'm getting stronger readings here.

100
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,795
This way.

101
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,299
Come on.

102
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,519
Egon, your mucus.

103
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,862
This happen to you before?

104
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,365
First time?

105
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,476
It's here.

106
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:49,606
A full torso apparition. And it's real.

107
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,279
So, what do we do?

108
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,204
Could you come over here
and talk to me for a second, please?

109
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,539
Could you just come here
for a second, please?

110
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:10,168
Right over here.
Come here, Francine. Come here.

111
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,838
-What do we do?
-l don't know. What do you think?

112
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,799
Stop that!

113
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,260
We've gotta make contact.
One of us should try to speak to it.

114
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,887
Good idea.

115
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,106
Hello.

116
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,316
I'm Peter.

117
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,445
Where are you from? Originally.

118
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,328
All right. Okay.
The usual stuff isn't working.

119
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,833
Okay, l have a plan.
I know exactly what to do.

120
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,920
Now, stay close.

121
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,297
Stay close.

122
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,467
I know. Do exactly as l say.

123
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,886
Get ready. Ready?

124
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,555
Get her!

125
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,150
-Did you see it? What was it?
-We'll get back to you.

126
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,651
Wait!

127
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,039
"Get her." That was your whole plan.
Get her.

128
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,003
-lt was scientific.
-l just got overexcited.

129
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,174
But wasn't it incredible, Pete?
We actually touched the etheric plane.

130
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,426
You know what this could mean
to the school?

131
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,928
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger
than the microchip.

132
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,805
The experience wasn't wasted.

133
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,808
According to these readings,
we have an excellent chance...

134
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,643
...of catching and holding a ghost.

135
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:54,814
This is great. lf the ionisation rate is
constant for all ectoplasmic entities...

136
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,193
...we could really bust some heads.
In a spiritual sense, of course.

137
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,362
Spengs, you serious
about this catching a ghost?

138
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,448
I'm always serious.

139
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,660
Egon, l'm gonna take back some
of the things l've said about you.

140
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,290
You've earned it.

141
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:18,505
The possibilities are limitless.
Hey, Dean Yeager.

142
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,636
I trust you're moving us
to better quarters on campus.

143
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,888
No, you're being moved off campus.

144
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,724
The Board of Regents has decided
to terminate your grant.

145
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,727
You are to vacate
these premises immediately.

146
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,897
This is preposterous.
I demand an explanation.

147
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,067
Fine. This university
will no longer continue...

148
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,570
...any funding of any kind
for your group's activities.

149
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,405
But the kids love us.

150
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:50,703
Dr. Venkman, we believe the purpose
of science is to serve mankind.

151
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:55,416
You, however, seem to regard science
as some kind of dodge or hustle.

152
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,002
Your theories are the worst kind
of popular tripe.

153
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,506
Your methods are sloppy, and your
conclusions are highly questionable.

154
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,134
You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman.

155
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,762
I see.

156
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,767
And you have no place in this
department or in this university.

157
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,187
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MlT or Stanford now.

158
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,773
They wouldn't touch us
with a 1 0-meter cattle prod.

159
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,276
You're always so concerned
about your reputation.

160
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,279
Einstein did his best stuff
when he was a patent clerk.

161
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,281
You know how much
a patent clerk earns?

162
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:30,118
The university gave us money.
We didn't have to produce anything.

163
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,371
You've never been out of college.
You don't know what it's like.

164
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,958
I've worked in the private sector.
They expect results.

165
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,960
For whatever reasons, Ray...

166
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:44,215
...call it fate, call it luck,
call it karma...

167
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,218
...l believe that everything
happens for a reason.

168
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,472
I believe that we were destined
to get thrown out of this dump.

169
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:56,644
-For what purpose?
-To go into business for ourselves.

170
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,443
This ecto-containment system
Spengler and I have in mind...

171
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,155
...will require a load of capital.
Where will we get the money?

172
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:12,493
I don't know. l don't know.

173
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,748
You're never gonna regret this, Ray.

174
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,500
My parents left me that house.
I was born there.

175
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,921
You won't lose the house. Everybody
has three mortgages nowadays.

176
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,757
But at 1 9 percent?
You didn't even bargain with the guy.

177
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,426
Ray, for your information,
the interest rate alone...

178
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,346
...for the first five years
comes to 95,000 dollars.

179
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,515
Will you guys relax? We are
on the threshold of establishing...

180
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,769
...the indispensable defence science
of the next decade:

181
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,522
Professional paranormal
investigations and eliminations.

182
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:46,361
The franchise rights alone will make
us rich beyond our wildest dreams.

183
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,697
There's office space,
sleeping quarters and showers...

184
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,449
...and there's a full kitchen.

185
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:56,537
It just seems a little pricey for a unique
fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.

186
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,539
What do you think, Egon?

187
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,959
I think this building
should be condemned.

188
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,670
There's metal fatigue
in all the load-bearing members.

189
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,465
The wiring is substandard.
It's inadequate for our power needs.

190
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,551
And the neighbourhood
is like a demilitarised zone.

191
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,638
Hey, does this pole still work?

192
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:20,728
Wow, this place is great.
When can we move in?

193
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:24,899
You gotta try this pole.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

194
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:33,282
Hey, we should stay here tonight,
sleep here. You know, to try it out.

195
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,253
-l think we'll take it.
-Good.

196
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,372
Hi.

197
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,380
-Dana, it's you.
-Hi. Yes, Louis, it's me.

198
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,924
-l thought it was the drugstore.
-Are you sick?

199
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,801
No, l'm fine. I feel great.

200
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,138
Just ordered some more vitamins
and stuff. I was just exercising.

201
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,974
I taped 20-Minute Workout
and played it at high speed...

202
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,310
...so it took 1 0 minutes.
Got a great workout.

203
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,228
Want to come in for a mineral water?

204
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,648
I'd really like to, Louis,
but I have a rehearsal. Excuse me.

205
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,984
No sweat.
I'll take a rain cheque on that.

206
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,613
I have plenty of low-sodium mineral
water and other nutritious foods.

207
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,656
-But you already know that.
-l know that.

208
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,910
That reminds me, l'm having
a big party for all my clients.

209
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,912
My fourth anniversary
as an accountant.

210
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,997
Even though you do
your own tax return...

211
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,957
...stop by, since you're
my neighbour.

212
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,251
Thank you, Louis.
I'll really try to stop by.

213
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,588
You shouldn't leave your TV
on so loud when you go out.

214
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,757
The creep down the hall
phoned the manager.

215
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,093
That's strange.
I didn't realise l left it on.

216
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,096
I climbed on the ledge
and tried to disconnect the cable...

217
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,682
...but l couldn't get in,
so l turned up my TV real loud too...

218
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,186
...so everyone would think both our
TVs had something wrong with them.

219
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,940
Okay, so l'll see you later, huh?
I'll give you a call.

220
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,193
I gotta have a shower.

221
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,367
Are you troubled by strange noises
in the middle of the night?

222
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,703
Do you experience feelings of dread
in your basement or attic?

223
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,124
Have you or any of your family ever
seen a spook, spectre or ghost?

224
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,877
If the answer is yes, pick up your
phone and call the professionals.

225
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,546
Ghostbusters.

226
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,048
Our courteous staff is on call
24 hours a day...

227
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,509
...to serve
your supernatural-elimination needs.

228
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,846
We're ready to believe you.

229
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,127
Zuul.

230
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,133
You don't think it's too subtle?

231
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,929
You don't think people are gonna
drive down and not see the sign?

232
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,397
You can't park that here!

233
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,654
Everybody can relax, I found the car.

234
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,281
Needs some suspension work
and shocks...

235
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:46,494
...and brakes, brake pads, linings,
steering box, transmission, rear end.

236
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,162
-How much?
-Only 4800.

237
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,998
Maybe new rings, also mufflers,
a little wiring.

238
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,672
-Janine, any calls?
-No.

239
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,341
-Any messages?
-No.

240
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,679
-Any customers?
-No, Dr. Venkman.

241
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,099
It's a good job, isn't it?

242
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,686
Type something, will you?
We're paying for this stuff.

243
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,189
Don't stare at me.
You've got the bug eyes.

244
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,525
Janine?

245
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,820
Sorry about the "bug eyes" thing.
I'll be in my office.

246
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,826
You're very handy. l can tell.

247
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,707
-l bet you like to read a lot too.
-Print is dead.

248
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,711
Oh, that's very fascinating to me.
I read a lot myself.

249
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:41,549
Some people think l'm too intellectual,
but it's a fabulous way to spend time.

250
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,845
I also play racquetball.
Do you have any hobbies?

251
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,932
I collect spores, moulds and fungus.

252
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,230
Hello?

253
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,460
Excuse me. Is this--?
This is the Ghostbusters' office.

254
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,588
Yes, it is. Can l help you?

255
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,675
I don't have an appointment.
I'd like to talk to someone, please.

256
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,972
I'm Peter Venkman. May l help you?

257
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:35,478
Well, l don't know. What l have
to say may sound a little unusual.

258
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,481
That's all we get, day in, day out,
around this place.

259
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,151
-Come into my office, Miss....
-Barrett. Dana Barrett.

260
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,614
And this voice said, "Zuul," and then l
slammed the refrigerator door and left.

261
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,825
That was two days ago, and l haven't
been back to my apartment.

262
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,162
Generally, you don't see that
behaviour in a major appliance.

263
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,663
What do you think it was?

264
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,291
Well, if I knew what it was,
I wouldn't be here.

265
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,001
Egon, what do you think?

266
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,296
She's telling the truth.
At least she thinks she is.

267
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,967
Well, of course l'm telling the truth.
Who would make up a story like that?

268
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,011
Some are people
who just want attention.

269
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,305
Others are nutballs
who come off the street.

270
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:15,851
You know what it could be? Past life
experience intruding on present time.

271
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,646
Could be a memory stored
in the collective unconscious.

272
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,857
I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance
or telepathic contact either.

273
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,610
I'm sorry, l don't believe
in any of those things.

274
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,989
Well, that's all right. I don't either.
But there are some things we do...

275
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,701
...standard procedures in a case
like this, which often bring us results.

276
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,955
I could check out the structural details
in the building.

277
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,707
Maybe the building has a history
of psychic turbulence.

278
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,209
Right. Good idea.

279
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,545
I could search "Zuul"
in the usual literature.

280
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,214
-Süates Catalogue.
-Tobin's Süirit Guide.

281
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,343
I'll take Miss Barrett back
to her apartment and check her out.

282
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,514
I'll go check out
Miss Barrett's apartment. Okay?

283
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,891
Okay.

284
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,520
-Thank you.
-lt's okay.

285
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,696
Please, let me.

286
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:13,075
If something's gonna happen here,
I want it to happen to me first.

287
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,415
That's the closet.

288
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,215
They hate this.

289
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,718
I like to torture them.

290
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,722
That's right, boys. lt's Dr. Venkman!

291
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,396
It's a lot of space.

292
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,442
-Just you?
-Yes.

293
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,402
Good.

294
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,950
What is that thing you're doing?

295
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,913
It's technical.
It's one of our little toys.

296
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,623
I see.

297
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,754
That's the bedroom.
But nothing ever happened in there.

298
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,842
What a crime.

299
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,764
You know, you don't act
like a scientist.

300
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:21,769
-They're usually pretty stiff.
-You're more like a game-show host.

301
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,361
That's the kitchen, huh?

302
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,750
-Dana, are these the eggs?
-Yes.

303
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,087
I was over there, and these eggs
jumped out of their shells...

304
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,839
-...and started to cook on the counter.
-That is weird.

305
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:55,135
That's when I started to hear that awful
noise coming from the refrigerator.

306
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,641
You've come all this way. Would you
like to check the refrigerator?

307
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,479
Better check the fridge. Good call.

308
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,903
Oh, my God.

309
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,948
Look at all the junk food.

310
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,993
-No. Goddamn it! This wasn't--
-You actually eat this stuff?

311
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,036
This wasn't here.
There was nothing here.

312
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,832
There was a space and a building
with flames coming out of it.

313
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,711
There were creatures writhing around,
and they were growling and snarling.

314
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,672
And there were flames,
and l heard a voice say, "Zuul."

315
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,173
It was right here.

316
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,175
I'm sorry, l'm not getting any reading.

317
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,387
Well, are you sure
you're using that thing correctly?

318
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,558
I think so. But l'm sure
there are no animals in there.

319
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,059
Well, that's great.

320
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,813
Either l have a monster in my kitchen,
or l'm completely crazy.

321
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,316
I don't think you're crazy.

322
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:56,030
Oh, good. That makes me
feel so much better.

323
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,865
Let me tell you something about me.

324
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,160
I come home from work to my place,
and all l have is my work.

325
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,870
There's nothing else in my life.

326
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,333
I meet you and say, "There's someone
with the same problem I have."

327
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,336
Yes, we both have
the same problem. You.

328
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,216
I'm gonna go for broke.

329
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,764
-l am madly in love with you.
-l don't believe this.

330
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,516
Will you please leave?

331
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,062
And then she threw me out of her life.
She thought I was a creep.

332
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,231
She thought I was a geek,
and she probably wasn't the first.

333
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,692
You are so odd.

334
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,074
-No.
-l've got it!

335
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,035
-No.
-l'll prove myself to you.

336
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,953
That's not necessary.

337
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,915
-Yeah, I'll solve your little problem.
-Okay.

338
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,752
And then you'll say, "Pete Venkman's
a guy who can get things done.

339
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,921
-l wonder what makes him tick."
-l wonder.

340
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,091
"I wonder if he'd be interested
in knowing what makes me tick."

341
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,052
I'll bet you're gonna be thinking
about me after I'm gone.

342
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,637
I bet l am.

343
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,807
No kiss?

344
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,777
To our first customer.

345
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,072
To our first and only customer.

346
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,991
I'll need to draw some petty cash.

347
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,994
I should take her out to dinner.
We don't want to lose her.

348
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:31,291
This magnificent feast here
represents the last of the petty cash.

349
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,629
Hey, slow down. Chew your food.

350
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,216
Hello, Ghostbusters.

351
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,678
Yes, of course they're serious.

352
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,181
You do?

353
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,726
You have?

354
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,644
No kidding.

355
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,690
Well, just give me the address.

356
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:59,611
Yes, of course.
Oh, they'll be totally discreet.

357
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,406
Thank you.

358
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,825
We got one!

359
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,415
It's a call!

360
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,549
Come on!

361
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,461
Hey, anybody see a ghost?

362
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,760
-Thank you for coming so quickly.
-Jesus!

363
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,971
The guests are asking questions,
and l'm running out of excuses.

364
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,473
Has it happened before?

365
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,226
Most of the original staff
knows about the 1 2th floor.

366
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,894
-The disturbances, l mean.
-Yeah.

367
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,980
But it's been quiet for years
up until two weeks ago.

368
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,941
It was never, ever this bad, though.

369
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:23,153
-Did you ever report it to anyone?
-No. Heavens, no.

370
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,948
The owners don't like us
to even talk about it.

371
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,116
I hope we could take care
of this quietly.

372
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,618
-lt's done.
-Tonight.

373
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,328
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

374
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,081
We handle this kind of thing
all the time.

375
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,592
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of a cosmonaut?

376
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,638
No, we're exterminators. Somebody
saw a cockroach up on 1 2th.

377
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:54,226
-That's gotta be some cockroach.
-Bite your head off, man.

378
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:01,525
-Going up?
-l'll take the next one.

379
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,990
It just occurred to me we haven't had
a successful test of this equipment.

380
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,367
-l blame myself.
-So do I.

381
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,537
-Well, no sense worrying about it now.
-Why worry?

382
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:18,292
Each of us is wearing an unlicensed
nuclear accelerator on his back.

383
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:22,880
Yep. Well, let's get ready.
Switch me on.

384
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,585
What the hell are you doing?

385
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,255
-Sorry.
-l'm sorry.

386
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,507
We thought you were someone else.

387
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,803
Successful test.

388
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,931
I guess so.

389
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,558
-l think we'd better split up.
-Good idea.

390
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,685
Yeah, we can do
more damage that way.

391
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,466
Venkman? Venkman!

392
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,559
Disgusting blob.

393
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,646
I'm gonna have to hold him myself.

394
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,981
Come in, Ray.

395
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,527
Venkman! l saw it! I saw it!

396
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,696
It's right here, Ray.

397
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,448
It's looking at me.

398
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,533
He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?

399
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,201
I think he can hear you, Ray.

400
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,287
Don't move. lt won't hurt you.

401
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,838
Venkman!

402
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,301
Venkman! Pete!

403
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,972
Venkman, what happened?
Are you okay?

404
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,557
He slimed me.

405
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,144
That's great! Actual physical contact!

406
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,480
-Can you move?
-Ray. Ray! Come in, please!

407
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,981
I feel so funky.

408
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,650
Spengler! l'm with Venkman.

409
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,319
He got slimed!

410
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,404
That's great, Ray. Save some for me.

411
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,240
Get down here, right away!
It just went into a ballroom.

412
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,742
Okay, we'll be right there.

413
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,331
If you and your staff
could please wait out here...

414
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,833
...we'll take care of everything.

415
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,771
There it is. On the ceiling.

416
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,526
That's the one that got me.

417
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,451
All right, boys.

418
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,370
Ready?

419
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,871
Throw it!

420
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,882
I did that. l did that.

421
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,718
-That's my fault.
-lt's okay. The table broke the fall.

422
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,721
There's something very important
I forgot to tell you.

423
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,224
-What?
-Don't cross the streams.

424
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,018
-Why?
-lt would be bad.

425
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,772
I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing.
What do you mean, "bad"?

426
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,734
Imagine all life as you know it stopping
instantaneously and every molecule...

427
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,154
...in your body exploding
at the speed of light.

428
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,573
Total protonic reversal.

429
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,660
Right, that's bad. Okay,
important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.

430
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:08,248
All right, Ray, take the left.
Egon, take the right.

431
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,424
Okay, Ray, just give me
one high and outside.

432
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,342
Ray!

433
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,471
Egon!

434
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,273
Okay, all right.
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

435
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,320
Nice shooting, Tex!

436
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,780
I assure you, there is no problem
with the room.

437
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,283
It'll be ready as soon as your guests
are here.

438
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,535
It took something out of him,
but he'll move.

439
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,622
I need some room to put the trap
down. Give me some room.

440
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,708
You'll excuse me, please.

441
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,176
-Gotta get this in the clear.
-Wait, wait, wait!

442
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,970
I've always wanted to do this.

443
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,680
And....

444
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,725
-The flowers are still standing!
-Okay, on my go-signal.

445
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,145
Spengler, l want a confinement stream
from you, okay? Go!

446
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,065
Okay, hold him up there.
He's gonna move. Hold him up!

447
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,650
Go!

448
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,320
-lt's working.
-Start bringing him down.

449
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,239
You got him. Don't cross the stream.

450
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:26,576
Maybe now you'll never slime a guy
with a positron collider, huh?

451
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,121
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.

452
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,333
I'm opening the trap now.
Don't look directly into the trap.

453
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,086
I looked at the trap, Ray.

454
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,674
Turn your streams off when I close
the trap. Get ready. l'm closing it.

455
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,759
Now!

456
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,654
It's in there.

457
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,159
Well, that wasn't such a chore,
now, was it?

458
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,206
Mr. Smith, quickly.
I want that door open now!

459
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,166
Donald, stand over there.

460
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,545
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

461
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,130
Did you see it? What is it?

462
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,631
We got it.

463
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,800
What is it?
Will there be any more of them?

464
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,886
What you had there
was what we refer to as a focused...

465
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,807
...non-terminal repeating phantasm,
or a class-five full-roaming vapour.

466
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,684
Real nasty one too.

467
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,686
And now...

468
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,187
...let's talk seriously.

469
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:40,734
For the entrapment, we're gonna have
to ask you for four big ones, $4000.

470
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,070
But we are having a special this week
on proton charging...

471
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,572
...and storage of the beast.

472
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,241
That's only gonna come to
1 000 dollars, fortunately.

473
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,995
Five thousand dollars? l had no idea
it'd be so much. l won't pay it.

474
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,331
That's all right.
We can just put it back.

475
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,374
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

476
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,086
No! All right! Anything.

477
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,588
Thanks so much.

478
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,548
Thank you. Hope
we can help you again.

479
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,551
Coming through! One class-five
free-roaming vapour.

480
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,846
Morning, l'm Roger Grimsby.
Today, the entire Eastern seaboard...

481
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,058
...is alive with talk of incidents
of üaranormal activity.

482
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,144
Alleged ghost-sightings
and suüernatural occurrences...

483
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,938
...have been reported
across the entirr tri-state area.

484
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,649
Everybody has heard ghost stories
around the campfire.

485
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,986
My grandma used to spin yarns
about a spectral locomotive...

486
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,655
...that would rocket past the farm
where she grew up.

487
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,908
But now, as if
some unforeseen authority....

488
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,638
Stand aside, please!

489
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,058
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in
topic, ghosts and ghostbusting.

490
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,769
The controversy builds,
more sightings are reported.

491
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,437
Some maintain that these...

492
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,316
...professional paranormal eliminators
in New York are the cause of it all.

493
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,115
I got it! I got it!

494
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,118
Pete! Ray!

495
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,337
Still making headlines
all across the country...

496
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:28,133
...the Ghostbusters are at it again,
this time at the dance club...

497
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:32,095
...The Rose. The boys in grey slugged
it out with a pesky poltergeist...

498
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:36,141
...then stayed to dance with the ladies
who witnessed the disturbance.

499
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,352
This is Casey Kasem.
Now on with the countdown.

500
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,646
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

501
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,524
No job is too big. No fee is too big.

502
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,486
Is it just a mist,
or does it have arms and legs?

503
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,281
As they say in TV, I'm sure
there's one big question...

504
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,659
...on everybody's mind and I imagine
you are the man to answer that.

505
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,996
How is Elvis,
and have you seen him lately?

506
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,542
Do you believe in UFOs,
astral projections...

507
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,170
...mental telepathy, ESP,
clairvoyance...

508
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,381
...spirit photography,
telekinetic movement...

509
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:55,428
...full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of Atlantis?

510
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,724
If there's a steady paycheck in it,
I'll believe anything you say.

511
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,895
I gotta get some sleep. I'm dying.

512
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,480
You don't look good.

513
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,565
-l don't?
-Well, you've looked better.

514
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,400
You didn't used to look like this.

515
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,486
Can you hold, please?

516
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,239
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn.
She paid with Visa.

517
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,533
Here's tonight's worksheet.

518
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,368
Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.

519
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,538
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.

520
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,582
Beautiful. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

521
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,044
-Congratulations.
-Can you help me, please?

522
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,966
Welcome aboard.

523
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,594
I don't know where they get
these guest conductors.

524
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,514
It's not gonna do him much good
to scream at us in German.

525
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,059
Well, l don't think that the man
is competent to conduct...

526
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,686
...a major symphony orchestra.

527
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:51,025
-Could you wait here a minute?
-Sure.

528
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,575
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.

529
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,077
-That was a wonderful rehearsal.
-You heard that?

530
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,162
Yes. You're the best one in your row.

531
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,789
Oh, thank you.

532
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,501
You're good. Most people can't hear
me with the whole orchestra playing.

533
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,295
I don't have to take this abuse.

534
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,755
I got hundreds of people
dying to abuse me.

535
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,966
I know. You're a big celebrity now.

536
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,344
Do you have some information
for me on my case?

537
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,350
Who's the stiff?

538
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,062
The stiff happens to be one of
the finest musicians in the world.

539
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,064
Do you have information
for me, please?

540
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,775
Well, sure, but l prefer
to give it to you in private.

541
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,279
-Why don't you tell me now?
-Okay. l found the name Zuul for you.

542
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:41,951
The name Zuul refers to a demigod
worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the....

543
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,329
What's that word?

544
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,080
-"Hittites."
-Hittites...

545
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:49,334
...the Mesopotamians
and the Sumerians.

546
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,712
"Zuul was the minion of Gozer."

547
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,089
What's Gozer?

548
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:59,469
-Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
-Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

549
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,639
I'm working on that. lf we could
get together Thursday night...

550
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:06,142
...l'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we could exchange information.

551
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,604
I can't see you Thursday. I'm busy.

552
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,191
Miss Barrett, you think there is
something wrong up here that says:

553
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,528
"He enjoys taking his evenings off
and spending it with his clients."

554
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,615
No. l'm making a special exception
in your case...

555
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,367
...because...

556
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,035
...l respect you.

557
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,329
It's corny, but l respect you
as an artist.

558
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,375
As a dresser too. This is a magnificent
coordination you have going today.

559
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,044
-See you Thursday.
-l'll bring the Roylance Guide...

560
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,421
...and we'll eat and read.

561
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,305
-So who the hell is that?
-He's just a friend.

562
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,890
-A friend?
-An old friend.

563
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,725
Bye! Well, I'll see you Thursday!

564
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:51,604
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

565
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,649
You're still very pale, though.
A little sun.

566
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,485
-Well, what does he do?
-He's a scientist.

567
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:13,000
This is where we store all the vapours
and entities and slimers that we trap.

568
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:18,548
Very simple, really. A loaded trap
here. Open, unlock the system.

569
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,049
Insert the trap.

570
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,886
Release.

571
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:28,433
Close, lock the system.
Set your entry grid.

572
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,059
Neutronise your field.

573
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,186
And...

574
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,981
...when the light is green,
the trap is clean.

575
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,109
The ghost is incarcerated here
in our custom storage facility.

576
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,863
There's a man from the EPA here
to see you. He's waiting in your office.

577
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,657
-EPA? What's he want?
-l don't know.

578
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,827
All I do know is l've been working
two weeks without a break...

579
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,705
...and you promised me
you'd hire more help.

580
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,207
Janine, someone
with your qualifications...

581
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:57,253
...would have no trouble finding
a topflight job in either...

582
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,256
...the food service or
housekeeping industries.

583
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,094
-Are you gonna answer that?
-l've quit better jobs than this.

584
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,722
Ghostbusters! What do you want?

585
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,475
-Can l help you?
-l'm Walter Peck.

586
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,312
I represent the Environmental
Protection Agency, the third district.

587
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,981
Great. How's it going down there?

588
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,194
Are you Peter Venkman?

589
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,780
Yes, l'm...

590
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,281
...Dr. Venkman.

591
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,242
Exactly what are you a doctor of,
Mr. Venkman?

592
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,829
Well, l have Ph.D.'s in parapsychology
and psychology.

593
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,415
I see.

594
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,460
And now you catch ghosts.

595
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,629
Yeah. You could say that.

596
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,632
And how many ghosts have you
caught, Mr. Venkman?

597
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,468
-l'm not at liberty to say.
-And where do you put...

598
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,513
...these ghosts
once you catch them?

599
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,140
Into a storage facility.

600
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,644
And would this storage facility
be located on these premises?

601
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:59,482
-Yes.
-And may l see this storage facility?

602
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,027
-No.
-And why not, Mr. Venkman?

603
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,824
Because you did not use
the magic word.

604
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:13,746
What is the magic word,
Mr. Venkman?

605
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,415
"Please."

606
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,546
May l please see the storage facility,
Mr. Venkman?

607
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,214
Why do you want to see it?

608
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,675
Well, because I'm curious.

609
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,261
I want to know more about
what you do here.

610
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,264
There've been a lot of wild
stories in the media...

611
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,350
...and we want to assess
any possible environmental impact...

612
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,852
...from your operation.

613
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,062
For instance, the presence
of noxious...

614
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,524
...possibly hazardous waste chemicals
in your basement.

615
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,903
Now, you show me what is down there,
or l come back with a court order.

616
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:50,992
You go get a court order, and I'll sue
your ass for wrongful prosecution!

617
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,537
You can have it your way,
Mr. Venkman.

618
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,623
I'm worried. lt's crowded in there,
and my data...

619
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,585
...points to something big
on the horizon.

620
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,712
What do you mean, "big"?

621
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:07,717
Well, let's say this Twinkie
represents the normal amount...

622
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,428
...of psychokinetic energy
in the New York area.

623
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:14,348
According to this morning's sample,
it would be a Twinkie...

624
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:18,060
...35 feet long, weighing
approximately 600 pounds.

625
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,147
That's a big Twinkie.

626
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,733
We could be on the verge
of a fourfold cross-rip...

627
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,236
...a PKE surge of incredible,
even dangerous, proportions.

628
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:31,282
We just had a visit from the
Environmental Protection Agency.

629
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,618
-How's the grid holding up?
-Not good.

630
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,661
Tell him about the Twinkie.

631
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,164
What about the Twinkie?

632
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,680
-Oh, Dana, it's you.
-Hello, Louis.

633
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,683
You gotta come in here.
You're missing a classic party.

634
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:43,020
Yes, well, l would, Louis,
but I have a date coming over.

635
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,858
You made a date...

636
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:54,281
-...tonight?
-Well, l'm sorry, Louis. l forgot.

637
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:59,078
Oh, that's okay.
You can bring him along.

638
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,707
All right. Maybe we'll stop by, okay?

639
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,667
That's great. I'll tell everybody.

640
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,795
We're gonna play Twister,
we're gonna do some breakdancing....

641
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,755
Hey--

642
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,385
Hey, let me in! lt's Louis!
Somebody, let me in!

643
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,037
Hello?

644
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,289
Hi, Mom.

645
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,124
I've been busy.

646
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,793
Well.... No, everything is fine.

647
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,172
Yeah. No, just that one time.

648
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,424
Oh, l am.

649
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,052
I will.

650
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:01,974
I won't. Mom, l have to go.
I have a date.

651
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,353
Yes. No, no one you know. It's....

652
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,107
Well, he's a Ghostbuster.

653
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,860
Those guys on TV.

654
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,613
Yes, well, l'll have to let you know.

655
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,240
Okay. Love to Dad.

656
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,994
Right. Bye. Bye.

657
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,433
Oh, shit.

658
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,176
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength Tylenol?

659
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:22,555
Gee, l think all l got is
acetylsalicylic acid. Generic.

660
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:26,559
I can get 600 tablets of that for the
same price as 300 of the name brand.

661
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,978
Makes good financial sense.
Good advice.

662
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,814
This is real smoked salmon
from Nova Scotia, Canada...

663
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,315
...24.95 a pound.

664
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,568
It only cost me 14.1 2
after tax, though.

665
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,653
I'm giving this as
a promotional expense.

666
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,740
That's why I invited clients instead
of friends. Having a good time, Marv?

667
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,577
How you doing? Have some Brie.
It's at room temperature.

668
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,412
You think it's too warm for Brie?

669
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,747
Louis, l'm going home.

670
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,584
Don't leave yet. Listen,
maybe if we start dancing...

671
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,752
...other people will join in.

672
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,754
Okay.

673
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,427
Oh, don't move.
I just gotta get the door.

674
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,555
-Ted! Annette!
-Hi.

675
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,099
I'm glad you could come.
Give me your coats.

676
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,727
Everybody, this is Ted
and Annette Fleming.

677
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,228
How are you?

678
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,231
Ted has a small carpet-cleaning
business in receivership.

679
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:17,651
Annette's drawing a salary from
a deferred bonus from two years ago.

680
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:21,864
They got 1 5,000 left
on the house at 8 percent.

681
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,408
So they're okay!

682
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,827
Does anybody want
to play Parcheesi?

683
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,749
Okay, who brought the dog?

684
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:58,692
Help! There's a bear loose
in my apartment! Help! Help!

685
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,446
Help!

686
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,658
-What?
-A bear in his apartment.

687
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,373
I'm gonna bring this up
at the tenants' meeting.

688
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,751
There's not supposed to be
any pets in the building.

689
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:35,521
Let me in. There's gotta be a way
in here. l gotta get--

690
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,610
Somebody, let me in!

691
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,243
Nice doggy.

692
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,370
Cute little pooch.

693
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,415
Maybe I got a Milk-Bone.

694
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,811
-What happened?
-Some moron brought...

695
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,064
...a cougar to a party,
and it went berserk.

696
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,278
Hi, l'm going up to Dana Barrett's.
Okay.

697
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,507
Hello?

698
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,554
That's a different look for you,
isn't it?

699
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,765
Are you the Keymaster?

700
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,643
Not that l know of.

701
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,616
Are you the Keymaster?

702
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,117
Yes.

703
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,454
I'm a friend of his.
He told me to meet him here.

704
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,665
-l didn't get your name.
-l am Zuul.

705
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,001
I am the Gatekeeper.

706
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,637
-What are we doing today, Zuul?
-Prepare for the coming of Gozer.

707
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,972
Gozer, huh?

708
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,809
The Destructor.

709
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,360
Are we still going out?

710
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:53,075
You know, you could pick up the place
if you're expecting someone.

711
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,662
Do you want this body?

712
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,789
Is this a trick question?

713
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,670
I guess the roses worked, huh?

714
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,880
Take me now...

715
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,674
...sub-creature.

716
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,676
We never talk anymore.

717
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:16,807
Easy. I make it a rule never to get
involved with possessed people.

718
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,853
It's more of a guideline than a rule.

719
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,438
You know, I can--

720
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,023
I want you inside me.

721
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,943
Go ahead. No, I can't.

722
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,821
Sounds like you got at least
two people in there already.

723
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,823
Might be a little crowded.

724
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,242
Come on, why don't you
just quit trying...

725
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,537
...to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman
and just relax.

726
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:42,249
Lie down there. Relax.
Put your hands on your chest.

727
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,252
What l'd really like to do
is talk to Dana.

728
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,296
I want to talk to Dana.

729
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,881
Dana, it's Peter.

730
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:52,759
There is no Dana.
There is only Zuul.

731
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,887
Oh, Zuulie, you nut. Come on.

732
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,806
Come on, l want to talk
to Dana. Dana.

733
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,350
Just relax. Come on. Dana.

734
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,394
Dana. Can l talk to Dana?

735
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:06,315
There is no Dana, only Zuul.

736
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,067
What a lovely singing voice
you must have.

737
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:11,236
Now, l'm gonna count
to three, Zuulie.

738
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,988
And if l don't talk to Dana...

739
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,867
...there's gonna be some real trouble
in this apartment, I think.

740
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,452
One.

741
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,498
Two.

742
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,751
Two and a half.

743
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,171
Please come down.

744
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:18,637
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor is coming.

745
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,890
The Traveller. The Destroyer.

746
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,439
Gatekeeper.

747
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,488
I am Vinz.

748
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,074
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

749
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,828
Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the
Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?

750
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,956
He pulls the waggon, l make
the deals. You want a ride?

751
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:58,844
Wait for the sign.
Then all prisoners will be released.

752
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:02,598
You will perish in flame,
you and all your kind! Gatekeeper!

753
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,308
What an asshole.

754
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,525
-Dropping off or picking up?
-Dropping off.

755
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,694
Just a moment.

756
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,907
-You a Ghostbuster?
-Yes.

757
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,368
We picked up this guy.
We don't know what to do.

758
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:26,038
Bellevue doesn't want him.
I'm afraid to lock him up.

759
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:29,124
I know you guys are into this stuff,
so l figured we'd check.

760
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,876
All right.

761
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:36,048
Are you the Gatekeeper?

762
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,386
You better bring him inside.

763
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,015
You are so kind to take
care of that man.

764
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,059
You know, you are
a real humanitarian.

765
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,686
I don't think he's human.

766
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,196
What did you say your name was?

767
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,407
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

768
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,743
According to this,
his name's Louis Tully.

769
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,329
Lives on Central Park West.

770
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,500
Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully?

771
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,710
-Do l?
-Yes, have some.

772
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,213
Yes, have some.

773
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,592
Vinz, you said before you
were waiting for a sign.

774
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,512
-What sign are you waiting for?
-Gozer the Traveller.

775
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,931
He will come in one
of the pre-chosen forms.

776
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:30,352
During rectification of the Vuldronaii,
the Traveller came as a large Torb.

777
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:34,272
Then, during the third reconciliation
of the Meketrex supplicants...

778
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,776
...they chose a new form for him,
that of a giant Sloar!

779
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,445
Many Shubs and Zuuls knew
what it was to be roasted...

780
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,281
...in the depths of the Sloar that day,
I can tell you.

781
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:46,785
-Egon.
-Excuse me.

782
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,957
There's something very strange
about that man.

783
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,920
I'm usually very psychic,
and l have a terrible feeling...

784
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:00,173
...that something awful
is gonna happen to you.

785
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,677
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

786
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,264
I'll get it.

787
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,227
-Hello?
-Egon, it's Peter.

788
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,647
-Thanks, I've got it.
-l have news from the world of Gozer.

789
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,984
-What is it, Peter?
-l'm here with Dana Barrett.

790
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,778
It seems the Goz has been
putting some moves...

791
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,990
-...on my would-be girlfriend.
-How is she?

792
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,660
I think we can get her
a guest shot on Wild Kingdom.

793
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,788
I just whacked her up
with about 300 cc's of Thorazine.

794
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:36,084
She's gonna take a little nap now,
but she says she's the Gatekeeper.

795
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,670
-Does that make any sense to you?
-Some.

796
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,423
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.

797
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,342
Oh, wonderful. We have
to get these two together.

798
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,264
I think that would be
extraordinarily dangerous.

799
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:52,768
Okay, well, hold onto him.
I'll be there in a little while.

800
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,145
Good.

801
01:02:55,313 --> 01:03:00,233
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find Ray.
I need him here immediately.

802
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:08,200
Bad news, honey, l gotta go to work.

803
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:11,244
Hey, will you stay here in bed
until I get back?

804
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:25,217
-Hey, Ray, do you believe in God?
-Never met him.

805
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:29,888
Yeah, well, l do. And l love
Jesus' style, you know?

806
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:34,017
This roof cap is made of
a magnesium-tungsten alloy.

807
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,520
What are you so involved
with there?

808
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:40,023
These are blueprints for the ironwork
in Dana Barrett's apartment...

809
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,984
...and they're very, very strange.

810
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,696
Hey, Ray, do you remember
something in the Bible about...

811
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:50,867
...the last days, when the dead
would rise from the grave?

812
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:54,079
I remember Revelations 7:1 2.

813
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,706
And l looked as he opened
the sixth seal.

814
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,834
And behold, there was
a great earthquake.

815
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,419
And the sun became
as black as sackcloth.

816
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,338
And the moon became as blood.

817
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,424
And the seas boiled.
And the skies fell.

818
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:11,096
-Judgement day.
-Judgement day.

819
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:14,266
Every ancient religion has its myth
about the end of the world.

820
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:18,103
Myth? Ray, has it ever
occurred to you...

821
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,438
...maybe the reason
we've been so busy...

822
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,733
...is because the dead have
been rising from the grave?

823
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:33,326
-How about a little music?
-Yeah.

824
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,783
This way.

825
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:26,796
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Just where do you think you're going?

826
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:30,133
Step aside, or you'll be arrested
for interfering with the police.

827
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,844
No. Hold on. I've seen TV.
You can't come in here...

828
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,512
...without a warrant or a writ.

829
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,807
Cease and Desist All Commerce
order. Seizure of Premises.

830
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:40,769
Ban of Public Utilities
for Non-Licensed Waste Handlers...

831
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,688
...and a federal
Entry and lnspection order.

832
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,942
Vinz, there's one more test
I'd like to perform.

833
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:51,363
Egon. l tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.

834
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:55,200
-Excuse me, this is private property.
-Shut this off. Shut these all off.

835
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,119
I'm warning you. Turning off these
machines is hazardous.

836
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,789
I'll tell you hazardous.
You're facing prosecution...

837
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,166
...for a half-a-dozen
environmental violations.

838
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,877
You shut off these beams,
or we shut them off for you.

839
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,468
Understand, this is a high-voltage
laser containment system.

840
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,388
Turning it off would be
like dropping a bomb in the city.

841
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,891
Don't patronize me. I'm not stupid,
like the people you bilk.

842
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:23,478
At ease, officer. I'm Peter Venkman.
There's been a misunderstanding...

843
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,730
...and l want to cooperate
in any way I can.

844
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,316
Forget it. You had your chance
to cooperate...

845
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:32,237
...but you thought it'd be more fun to
insult me. Now it is my turn, wise-ass.

846
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,406
He wants to shut down
the protection grid.

847
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:37,242
You shut that thing down,
we won't be held responsible--

848
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,162
-You'll be responsible. Shut it off.
-No, we won't be held responsible.

849
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,332
Don't shut it off. l'm warning you.

850
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:48,086
I've never seen anything like this.
I don't know--

851
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:51,756
Yeah, l'm not interested in
your opinion. Just shut it off.

852
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,093
My friend, don't be a jerk.

853
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,887
-Step aside.
-lf he does that again, you shoot him.

854
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,223
You do your job.
Don't tell me how to do mine.

855
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:03,101
-Thank you, officer.
-Shut it off!

856
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,250
Oh, shit.

857
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,976
Clear the building!

858
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:17,008
This is it. This is the sign.

859
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:21,096
Yeah, it's a sign, all right.
We're going out of business.

860
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:33,108
Hey, aim up there.

861
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:35,485
-What happened?
-Storage facility blew.

862
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,196
-He shut off the protection grid.
-Oh, great.

863
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,156
-That's bad, isn't it?
-Yeah.

864
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:42,867
-Where's the Keymaster?
-Shit.

865
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,370
-Who's the Keymaster?
-Oh, come on.

866
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:48,498
Hold it. l want this man arrested.

867
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:52,127
These men are in criminal violation
of the Environmental Protection Act.

868
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,879
-This explosion is a direct result of it.
-Your mother!

869
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,382
Come on, hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

870
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:47,765
Columbia Building, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry, so let's not dawdle.

871
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:44,155
Hey, guard!

872
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,658
Look, l want to make a phone call.

873
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,327
I just work with these guys.
I wasn't even there.

874
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:52,664
The structure of this roof cap
is like the telemetry tracker...

875
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:56,834
...that NASA uses to identify
dead pulsars in deep space.

876
01:10:57,002 --> 01:11:03,007
Cold-riveted girders
with cores of pure selenium.

877
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,343
Everybody getting this so far?

878
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,805
So what? l guess they just don't
make them like they used to.

879
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,307
No. Nobody ever made
them like this.

880
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:16,187
The architect was either a certified
genius or an authentic wacko.

881
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:19,440
Ray, for a moment...

882
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,694
...pretend that l don't know
anything about metallurgy...

883
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:28,157
...engineering or physics and just
tell me what the hell is going on.

884
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,368
You never studied.

885
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:34,789
The whole building is a huge
superconductive antenna...

886
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,375
...that was designed and
built for the purpose...

887
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:40,712
...of pulling in and concentrating
spiritual turbulence.

888
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:46,551
Your girlfriend lives in the
corner penthouse of spook central.

889
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:50,555
She's not my girlfriend.

890
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:54,225
I find her interesting because she's
a client and sleeps above her covers.

891
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:58,396
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drools. She claws.

892
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:01,024
It's not the girl, Peter,
it's the building.

893
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:05,236
Something terrible is about to enter
our world. This building is the door.

894
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,363
The architect's name
was lvo Shandor.

895
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:11,159
I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide.
He was also a doctor.

896
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,828
He performed a lot
of unnecessary surgery.

897
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,873
And then, in 1 920,
he started a secret society.

898
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:20,835
-Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
-Right.

899
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,212
No studying.

900
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:28,926
After World War l, Shandor decided
that society was too sick to survive.

901
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:35,600
He wasn't alone. He had close
to a thousand followers when he died.

902
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,727
They conducted rituals
up on the roof...

903
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:41,439
...bizarre rituals intended to bring
about the end of the world.

904
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,609
And now it looks like
it may actually happen.

905
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,118
We have to get out of here
and find a judge or something.

906
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:57,789
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey. Hold it.

907
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:00,124
Are we going to go
before a judge to say...

908
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:03,544
...that a Babylonian god is
gonna drop in on Central Park West...

909
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,798
-...and start tearing up the city?
-Sumerian, not Babylonian.

910
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:09,634
-Yeah, big difference.
-No offence...

911
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,469
...but l gotta get my own lawyer.

912
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:14,263
Okay, Ghostbusters.
The mayor wants to see you guys.

913
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,349
The whole island's going crazy.
Let's go.

914
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,644
I gotta split. The mayor wants to
rap with me about some things.

915
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:47,338
-l am the Keymaster.
-l am the Gatekeeper.

916
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:34,218
-Back. Back. Stay back.
-Stay back. Stay back.

917
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,729
I've got a city blowing up,
and you aren't giving me answers.

918
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:47,899
We're blocking the bridges,
the roads--

919
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:49,567
The Ghostbusters are here.

920
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:52,487
The Ghostbusters.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.

921
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,238
Hey, and where's this Peck?

922
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:58,493
Peck. I am Walter Peck, sir, and
I am prepared to make a full report.

923
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,037
These men are consummate
snowball artists.

924
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,998
They use sense and nerve gases
to induce hallucinations.

925
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,502
People think they're seeing ghosts,
and they call these bozos...

926
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,087
...who show up to deal
with the problem...

927
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,089
...with a fake electronic light show.

928
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:15,092
Everything was fine with our system
until the power grid...

929
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:18,888
-...was shut off by dickless here.
-They caused an explosion.

930
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:24,185
-ls this true?
-Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

931
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:29,732
Hey, come on. Knock it off.
Hey, break it up!

932
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,734
-All right.
-Well, that's what l heard.

933
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,361
This is City Hall.

934
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,572
Now, what am l gonna do here, John?
What is this?

935
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:39,450
All I know is that was no light show
we saw this morning.

936
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:43,538
I've seen every form
of combustion known to man...

937
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,581
...but this beats the hell out of me.

938
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:48,209
The walls in the 53rd Precinct
were bleeding.

939
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,878
-How do you explain that?
-Good afternoon, gentlemen.

940
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,630
Oh, Your Eminence.

941
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:01,222
-How are you, Lenny?
-You're looking good, Mike.

942
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:04,976
We're in a real fix here.
What do you think l should do?

943
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:08,062
Officially, the church
will not take any position...

944
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,607
...on the religious implications
of these phenomena.

945
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,276
Personally, Lenny...

946
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:17,655
...l think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.

947
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:19,490
That's a smart move, Mike.

948
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,325
I won't call a press conference...

949
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:24,328
...and tell everyone to start praying.

950
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:29,125
I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honour.

951
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:31,669
I've only been with the company
for a couple weeks.

952
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,505
But l gotta tell you,
these things are real.

953
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,676
Since I joined these men,
I have seen shit that'll turn you white.

954
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,178
Well, you can believe Mr. Pecker.

955
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,848
-My name is Peck.
-Or you could accept the fact...

956
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:47,435
...that this city is headed for
a disaster of biblical proportions.

957
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:51,314
-Well, what do you mean, "biblical"?
-What he means is Old Testament.

958
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:53,608
-Real wrath-of-God-type stuff.
-Exactly.

959
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:57,194
Fire and brimstone down from
the skies. Rivers and seas boiling.

960
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:59,822
Forty years of darkness.
Earthquakes. Volcanoes.

961
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,158
-Dead rising from the grave.
-Human sacrifice.

962
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,536
Dogs and cats living together.
Mass hysteria.

963
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,872
Enough! I get the point.

964
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,042
But what if you're wrong?

965
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:14,545
If l'm wrong, nothing happens.
We go to jail, peacefully, quietly.

966
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:18,215
We'll enjoy it. But if I'm right...

967
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:21,552
...and we can stop this thing....

968
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:27,141
Lenny, you will have
saved the lives...

969
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:31,562
...of millions of registered voters.

970
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:40,905
I don't believe you're seriously
considering listening to these men.

971
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:50,748
Get him out of here.

972
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,542
-Bye.
-l'll fix you. l'm gonna fix you.

973
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,545
I'll get you a nice fruit basket.
I'm going to miss him.

974
01:17:56,713 --> 01:17:58,130
All right. All right.

975
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:02,051
We got work to do. Now,
what do you need from me?

976
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,942
Come on, let's run some red lights!

977
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,757
Hello, New York.

978
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,682
Hello, everybody!

979
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,186
Dr. Ray Stantz, would you please?
The heart of the Ghostbusters.

980
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:38,522
Thank you. They love you.
They love you here.

981
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:43,652
-l like that shirt, friend.
-Ghostbusters! All right!

982
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:49,450
Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost.

983
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,369
Okay, whatever happens,
let's be professional.

984
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:27,071
We might have to put a little
overtime in on this one.

985
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:25,129
There they are. There they are.

986
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,597
I was in no way prepared for that.

987
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:38,475
It's all right. Don't worry.
We're fine. We can handle it.

988
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:40,978
We can take it.
They want to play rough.

989
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:45,649
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters!

990
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,944
-Wanna play rough?
-Yeah.

991
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:50,863
Let's do it.

992
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:17,932
Where are we?

993
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:22,186
It looks like we're
in the teens somewhere.

994
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:26,649
Well, when we get to 20, tell me.
I'm gonna throw up.

995
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:02,851
-Twenty-two. ls this it?
-Yep.

996
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:14,405
Art deco. Very nice.

997
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:17,449
-Where is it?
-lt's at the end of the hall.

998
01:23:57,907 --> 01:24:00,534
Hey, where do these stairs go?

999
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:04,747
They go up.

1000
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,046
Okay, go ahead. Come on.
Go ahead.

1001
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,132
Watch it. Go ahead.

1002
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:55,798
Dana.

1003
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:14,149
Okay, so she's a dog.

1004
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:55,315
It's a girl.

1005
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:03,073
-lt's Gozer.
-l thought Gozer was a man.

1006
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:07,077
-lt's whatever it wants to be.
-Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.

1007
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:08,745
Right.

1008
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:11,415
Go get her, Ray!

1009
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:25,929
Gozer the Gozerian?

1010
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:33,353
Good evening. As a duly designated
representative of the city...

1011
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:35,230
...county and state of New York...

1012
01:26:35,398 --> 01:26:37,900
...l order you to cease
all supernatural activity...

1013
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:39,943
...and return to your place of origin...

1014
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,946
...or to the nearest convenient
parallel dimension.

1015
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:45,782
That ought to do it.
Thanks very much, Ray.

1016
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:48,535
Are you a god?

1017
01:26:55,043 --> 01:27:00,464
-No.
-Then die!

1018
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:30,452
Ray, when someone asks you
if you're a god, you say, "Yes."

1019
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,832
All right. This chick is toast.

1020
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:50,639
-Got your stick?
-Holding it.

1021
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,142
Heat them up!

1022
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:56,019
Smoking!

1023
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:59,523
-Make them hard.
-Ready!

1024
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,943
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

1025
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,989
Throw it!

1026
01:28:15,873 --> 01:28:19,710
-Nimble little minx, isn't she?
-We better go full stream.

1027
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:22,170
Aim for the flattop.

1028
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,724
Wasn't so hard.

1029
01:28:40,064 --> 01:28:41,565
We neutronised it.

1030
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:44,359
You know what that means?
A complete particle reversal.

1031
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:47,362
And we had the tools.
We had the talent.

1032
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:49,823
It's Miller time.

1033
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:54,661
-Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad.
-Oh, no.

1034
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,330
What?

1035
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,591
Look out!

1036
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:36,286
Sub-creatures. Gozer the Gozerian,
Gozer the Destructor...

1037
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:41,083
...Volguus Zildrohar
the Traveller has come.

1038
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:44,127
Choose and perish.

1039
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:47,798
What do you mean, "choose"?
We don't understand.

1040
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:53,637
Choose. Choose the form
of the Destructor.

1041
01:29:53,846 --> 01:29:58,433
Oh, l get it. l get it. Oh, very cute.

1042
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:01,812
Whatever we think of.
If we think of J. Edgar Hoover...

1043
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:05,273
...J. Edgar Hoover will appear and
destroy us, so empty your heads.

1044
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:08,318
Don't think of anything.
We've only got one shot at this.

1045
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:12,322
The choice is made.

1046
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,741
The Traveller has come.

1047
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,993
Nobody choosed anything.

1048
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:18,620
-Did you choose anything?
-No.

1049
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:20,122
-Did you?
-My mind is blank.

1050
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:22,666
I didn't choose anything!

1051
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:34,177
I couldn't help it.

1052
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,347
It just popped in there.

1053
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:41,601
What? What just popped in there?

1054
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,646
-l tried to think--
-Look!

1055
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:48,150
-No! It can't be.
-What is it?

1056
01:30:48,317 --> 01:30:50,026
-lt can't be.
-What did you do, Ray?

1057
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:52,320
Oh, shit.

1058
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:05,292
It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1059
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,909
There's something
you don't see every day.

1060
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:40,911
I tried to think of a harmless thing.

1061
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:43,079
Something l loved
from my childhood.

1062
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:48,084
Something that could never, ever
possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

1063
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:50,253
Nice thinking, Ray.

1064
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:53,256
We used to roast
Stay Puft marshmallows...

1065
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:55,258
...by the fire at Camp Waconda.

1066
01:31:57,053 --> 01:32:01,264
Ray, has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got left?

1067
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:06,770
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rational thought.

1068
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:19,783
-Oh, no.
-Mother pus bucket.

1069
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:27,082
Nobody steps on a church
in my town.

1070
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,210
One, two, three, roast him.

1071
01:32:50,022 --> 01:32:51,648
Funny, us going out like this.

1072
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:54,150
Killed by a 1 00-foot
marshmallow man.

1073
01:32:54,318 --> 01:32:57,487
We've been going about this wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is a sailor.

1074
01:32:57,655 --> 01:33:01,491
He's in New York. We get this
guy laid, we won't have any trouble.

1075
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:08,456
I have a radical idea.
The door swings both ways.

1076
01:33:08,624 --> 01:33:11,126
We could reverse the particle flow
through the gate.

1077
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:13,128
How?

1078
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:15,505
-We'll cross the streams.
-Excuse me, Egon.

1079
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,465
You said crossing the streams
was bad.

1080
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:20,760
-Cross the streams.
-You're gonna endanger us.

1081
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:22,679
You're gonna endanger our client...

1082
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,849
...the nice lady who paid us in
advance before she became a dog.

1083
01:33:26,058 --> 01:33:30,145
Not necessarily. There's definitely
a very slim chance we'll survive.

1084
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,613
I love this plan. l'm excited
to be a part of it. Let's do it.

1085
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:43,491
This job is definitely not
worth 1 1 ,500 a year.

1086
01:33:47,121 --> 01:33:48,622
Hurry.

1087
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:52,959
See you on the other side, Ray.

1088
01:33:55,212 --> 01:33:57,881
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.

1089
01:34:06,223 --> 01:34:07,891
Let's turn them on, Spengler!

1090
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:13,396
Now, Spengler!

1091
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:20,570
Get out of here!

1092
01:35:13,749 --> 01:35:15,250
Winston.

1093
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:17,961
Are you all right?

1094
01:35:23,175 --> 01:35:24,634
Venkman?

1095
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:26,136
Spengler!

1096
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,638
Venkman!

1097
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:33,476
Spengler.

1098
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:37,731
Oh, Spengler. Oh, are you okay?

1099
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:39,983
I feel like the floor of a taxicab.

1100
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:42,318
-Venky!
-Yeah, where are you?

1101
01:35:42,486 --> 01:35:44,821
Oh, thank God.

1102
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:47,657
-You okay?
-l'm all right.

1103
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,284
-You all right?
-l'm all right.

1104
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:51,745
-You all right?
-Yeah. You okay?

1105
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:53,413
Fine.

1106
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:04,674
It smells like barbecued dog hair.

1107
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,135
Oh, Venkman.

1108
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:09,512
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1109
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:13,141
I'm sorry. l just-- l just forgot.

1110
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:29,115
Look!

1111
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:59,062
Somebody turn on the lights!

1112
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,357
-Help! Somebody!
-Go check on that little guy.

1113
01:37:07,863 --> 01:37:09,781
What happened?

1114
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:20,750
Where am l?

1115
01:37:22,586 --> 01:37:25,713
Oh, hi.

1116
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,924
You'll be all right.

1117
01:37:28,425 --> 01:37:31,928
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

1118
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:35,348
Are you okay?

1119
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:37,892
Who are you guys?

1120
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,103
We're the Ghostbusters.

1121
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,357
Who does your taxes?

1122
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:48,236
You know, Mr. Tully,
you are a most fortunate individual.

1123
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:50,697
-l know.
-You have been a participant in...

1124
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:54,450
...the biggest interdimensional cross
rip since the Tunguska blast of 1 909.

1125
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:56,786
-Felt great.
-We'd like to get a sample...

1126
01:37:56,954 --> 01:37:59,831
-...of your brain tissue.
-Okay.

1127
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:05,587
I love this town!

1128
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:51,424
Egon!

1129
01:38:58,390 --> 01:39:00,308
What's going on?

1130
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:03,686
Does anybody want to interview me?

1131
01:39:03,896 --> 01:39:07,273
I'm an eyewitness. I was up there.

1132
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:09,984
I want to go with them in the car.
