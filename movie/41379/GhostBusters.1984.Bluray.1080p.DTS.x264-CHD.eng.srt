1
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:49,904
I'm gonna turn over the next card.
Concentrate.

2
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,788
What do you think it is?

3
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:02,167
- A square.
- Good guess, but wrong.

4
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:15,354
Clear your head.

5
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:21,813
- What do you think it is?
- Is it a star?.

6
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:26,650
It is a star. Very good.

7
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:34,454
Think hard. What is it?

8
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:38,875
- A circle.
- Close, but definitely wrong.

9
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:50,218
All right. Ready?.

10
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:54,852
What is it?

11
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:02,362
Figure eight.

12
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:06,231
Incredible. Can you see these?

13
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:09,825
- Are you cheating?
- No, they're just coming to me.

14
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:18,832
- Nervous?
- Yes. I don't like this.

15
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:22,955
You only have 75 more to go.
What's this one?

16
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:31,468
- A couple of wavy lines.
- This isn't your lucky day.

17
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:45,692
- I'm getting tired of this!
- You volunteered.

18
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:51,405
I didn't know about the chocks.
What are you trying to prove?

19
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,529
I'm studying the effect
of negative reinforcement on ESP.

20
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:59,244
The effect
is that it's pissing me off!

21
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:03,999
- Then maybe my theory is correct!
- Kéep the five bucks!

22
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:12,136
Get used to that.

23
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:17,184
That's the kind of resentment
your ability will provoke in people.

24
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:22,776
- Do you think I have it?
- You're no fluke, Jennifer.

25
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:26,895
This is it!

26
00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:32,448
I need the UV lenses
and the tape for the video camera.

27
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:36,989
Will you excuse me?

28
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:41,749
I'm in the middle of something, Ray.

29
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:45,456
Could you come back in an hour?.

30
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:51,008
Peter, at 1 :40 PM,
at the New York Public Library, -

31
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:56,092
- ten people saw a free-floating,
vaporous apparition.

32
00:05:56,269 --> 00:06:00,812
It blew books off shelves
from 20 feet away!

33
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:03,355
I'm very excited.

34
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:07,898
Check it out and get back to me.

35
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:14,954
You're coming with us. Spengler took
PKE valences that buried the needle.

36
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:19,534
We're close on this one.
I can feel it.

37
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:25,587
I can feel it.
We're very, very close.

38
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:32,298
I have to go now.
Could you come back, say at ...

39
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:38,676
- Eight o'clock?.
- That's what I was going to say.

40
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:46,063
You've finally gone around the bend.

41
00:06:46,236 --> 00:06:52,606
You've been meeting every schizo
who's had a paranormal experience.

42
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:58,241
I was present at an unexplained
mass sponge migration.

43
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:03,159
The sponges migrated
a foot and a half.

44
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:14,758
You're here!
This is very big, Peter.

45
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:21,266
Remember the time you tried to
drill a hole through your head?

46
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:27,642
- I'm Roger Delacorte.
- I'm Dr. Venkman, Dr. Stanz, Egon.

47
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,687
Thank you for coming.
I hope we can clear this up quietly.

48
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:36,942
Let's not rush things.
We don't know what we have.

49
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,250
- It had arms. It reached for me.
- Arms! I can't wait to see it!

50
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,171
Let me ask
you a couple of standard questions.

51
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:53,294
Have you or anyone in your family
ever been diagnosed schizophrenic?

52
00:07:54,846 --> 00:08:00,635
- My uncle thought he was a saint.
- I'd call that a big "yes".

53
00:08:02,854 --> 00:08:07,433
- Do you use drugs or alcohol?
- No!

54
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:13,482
Just asking.
Are you menstruating right now?.

55
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:18,823
- What has that got to do with it?
- Back off. I'm a scientist.

56
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:22,329
Ray! It's moving!

57
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,474
Look.

58
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:56,445
This is hot.

59
00:08:56,616 --> 00:09:02,156
Symmetrical book stacking,
just like in Philadelphia, 1947.

60
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,992
You're right. No human being
would stack books like this.

61
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:11,665
Listen!
Do you smell something?

62
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:22,218
Talk about telekinetic activity.
Look at this mess!

63
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:28,221
- Look at this.
- Ectoplasmic residue.

64
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,058
- Get a sample of this.
- It's the real thing.

65
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:36,944
Someone blows their nose
and you want to keep it?

66
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:41,113
- There's more over here.
- I'm getting stronger readings.

67
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:49,414
This way!

68
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:04,424
Egon, your mucous.

69
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:14,771
Has this happened to you before?

70
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:18,444
First time?

71
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:45,297
It's here.

72
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:48,975
A full-torso apparition,
and it's real.

73
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:57,686
So what do we do?

74
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:07,736
Could you come over and talk to me
for a second? Right over here.

75
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,959
- What do we do?
- What do you think?.

76
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:16,287
Stop that!

77
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:21,625
- One of us should speak to it.
- Good idea.

78
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,266
Hello, I'm Peter.

79
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:36,431
Where are you from ... originally?.

80
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:49,288
- The usual stuff isn't working.
- I know exactly what to do.

81
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,042
Stay close.

82
00:11:56,671 --> 00:12:01,168
Do exactly as I say.
Get ready.

83
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:04,297
Ready?. Get her!

84
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:17,056
- Did you see it? What was it?
- We'll get back to you.

85
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:31,073
"Get her!"
That was your whole plan.

86
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:35,121
- It was scientific.
- I just got over-excited.

87
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:40,798
But we touched the etheric plane.
Do you know what this means?

88
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,801
I'm very excited.

89
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:49,888
We have an excellent chance
of catching a ghost and holding it.

90
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:54,803
This is great! lf the
ionisation rate is constant, -

91
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,349
- we could really bust some heads!

92
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:03,946
- Are you serious about this?
- I'm always serious.

93
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:08,734
I'm going to take back
what I said about you.

94
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:13,279
You've earned it.

95
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,119
The possibilities are limitless.
Hey, Dean Yeager!

96
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:26,834
- Are you giving us better quarters?
- You're being moved offcampus.

97
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:32,717
Your grant has been terminated
and you are to leave immediately.

98
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:36,807
This is preposterous.
I demand an explanation.

99
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,484
The university will no longer
fund your activities.

100
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:46,650
- But the kids love us.
- Dr. Venkman ...

101
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:50,732
The purpose of science
is to serve mankind, -

102
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:55,454
- but you regard it
as a kind of dodge or hustle.

103
00:13:55,624 --> 00:14:01,329
Your theories are popular tripe and
your conclusions are questionable.

104
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:07,009
- You are a poor scientist.
- I see.

105
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:13,049
You have no place
in this university.

106
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:18,646
What a disgrace. MIT or Stanford
wouldn't touch us now.

107
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:26,228
- Einstein worked as a patent clerk.
- Do you know how much they earn?

108
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:30,449
The university gave us money.
We didn't have to produce anything.

109
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:36,821
You've never been out of college.
The private sector expects results.

110
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:41,245
For whatever reasons, Ray ...
Call it fate ...

111
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:44,255
... call it luck, call it karma ...

112
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:47,708
... I believe everything happens
for a reason.

113
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:52,463
- We were destined to be thrown out.
- Why?.

114
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,886
To go into business for ourselves.

115
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:04,857
This containment system
will cost a load of bread.

116
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:08,775
Where will we get the money?.

117
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:12,398
I don't know.

118
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:19,572
- You won't regret this, Ray.
- I was born in that house.

119
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:25,794
- Everyone has three mortgages.
- At 19%? You didn't even bargain.

120
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:31,421
The interest rate alone for the
first five years comes to $95,000.

121
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:37,757
We are establishing the defence
science of the next decade.

122
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:41,760
"Professional paranormal
investigations and Eliminations."

123
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:46,232
The franchise rights alone
will make us rich.

124
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:51,443
There's office space, sleeping
quarters and a full kitchen.

125
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:56,532
It seems a little pricey
for a fixer-upper.

126
00:15:56,703 --> 00:16:01,199
- What do you think, Egon?
- This building should be condemned.

127
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:07,210
There's metal fatigue, the wiring
is inadequate for our power needs, -

128
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,666
- and the neighbourhood
is like a demilitarised zone.

129
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:14,674
Hey!
Does this pole still work?.

130
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:22,974
This place is great! When can we
move in? You have to try this pole.

131
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:26,432
I'll get my stuff.

132
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:33,185
We should stay here tonight.
Sleep here. To try it out.

133
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:45,197
- We'll take it.
- Good.

134
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:22,154
Hi.

135
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:31,082
Dana, it's you.
I thought it was the drugstore.

136
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:35,633
- Are you sick?.
- No. I just ordered more vitamins.

137
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:42,421
I played "20-Minute Workout" at high
speed and got a 10-minute workout.

138
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:48,520
- Would you like a mineral water?.
- I have to go to rehearsal now.

139
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:55,737
I'll take a rain check. I always
have mineral water in the house.

140
00:17:55,906 --> 00:18:01,066
I'm having a big party. My fourth
anniversary as an accountant.

141
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:07,199
- I'd like you to stop by.
- I'll try to stop by, Louis.

142
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:12,618
You left your TV on. The creep
down the hall phoned the manager.

143
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:15,419
I didn't know I left it on.

144
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:19,845
I tried to disconnect the cable,
but I couldn't get in, -

145
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:24,390
- so I turned up my TV, too,
so everyone would think ...

146
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:28,845
I'll see you later!

147
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:33,765
I'm gonna have a shower!

148
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:42,655
- Do you hearnoises atnight?
- Do you dreadyour attic?

149
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:47,988
- Have you everseen a ghost?
- Ifso, don't walt anotherminute.

150
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,001
Call Ghostbusters.

151
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:56,330
Our staffis on call 24 hours a day
to serve your needs.

152
00:18:56,508 --> 00:19:00,375
We're ready to believe you.

153
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:22,671
Is it too subtle? Do you think
people may not see the sign?

154
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:33,724
You can't park that here!

155
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,983
I found a car.
It needs some suspension work, -

156
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:46,445
- shocks, brakes, brake pads,
lining, steering box ...

157
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:50,912
- How much?
- Only 4,800. Rings, mufflers ...

158
00:20:55,544 --> 00:21:00,882
- Janine, any calls or messages?
- No.

159
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:04,714
- Any customers?
- No, Dr. Venkman.

160
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:10,634
Good job, isn't it?
Type something, we're paying you.

161
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,095
Don't stare.
You've got those bug eyes.

162
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:21,437
Janine! Sorry about the "bug eyes"
thing. I'll be in my office.

163
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:27,489
You're very handy. I can tell.

164
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:33,077
- I bet you like to read, too.
- Print is dead.

165
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:38,373
I read a lot myself. Some people
think I'm too intellectual, -

166
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:43,373
- but it's a great way to spend your
spare time. I also play racquetball.

167
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:49,553
- Do you have any hobbies?
- I collect spores and fungus.

168
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:57,302
Hello.

169
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:20,541
- Is this the Ghostbusters office?
- Yes. Can I help you?

170
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:25,457
I don't have an appointment.
I'd like to talk to someone, please.

171
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:32,298
- I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?
- I don't know ...

172
00:22:32,474 --> 00:22:37,895
- It may sound unusual.
- That's all we get around here.

173
00:22:38,063 --> 00:22:42,061
- Come into my office, Miss ...
- Barrett. Dana Barrett.

174
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:49,695
And the voice said "Zuul". I slammed
the refrigerator door and left.

175
00:22:49,908 --> 00:22:54,451
Odd behaviour for a major appliance.
What do you think it was?

176
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:57,326
If I knew, I wouldn't be here.

177
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:02,624
- Egon, what do you think?.
- She's telling the truth.

178
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:07,292
Of course I am.
Who would make up a story like that?

179
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:11,132
Nutballs who come in off the street.

180
00:23:11,304 --> 00:23:15,349
It could be past life experience
intruding on present time.

181
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:21,555
I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance
or telepathic contact, either.

182
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:27,152
- I don't believe in any of it.
- That's all right. I don't either.

183
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,611
But there are some procedures
which often bring us results.

184
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:40,080
I'll check the building's records
for a history of psychic turbulence.

185
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:45,167
I'll look for the name "Zuul"
in Tobin's Spirit Guide.

186
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:49,253
I'll take Miss Barrett home
and check herout.

187
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:54,544
I'll go check out her apartment.
Okay?.

188
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:12,651
If something is going to happen,
I want it to happen to me first.

189
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:20,616
That's the closet.

190
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:30,716
They hate this.
I like to torture them.

191
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:35,462
That's right, boys.
It's Dr. Venkman!

192
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:43,804
A lot of space.

193
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,934
- Just you?
- Yes.

194
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:49,730
Good.

195
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:56,659
- What are you doing?
- It's technical.

196
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:59,703
One of our little toys.

197
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:07,210
That's the bedroom.
But nothing ever happened in there.

198
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:12,668
What a crime ...

199
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,837
- You don't act like a scientist.
- They're usually pretty stiff.

200
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:22,965
You're more like a game-show host.

201
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:30,350
That's the kitchen?

202
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:45,826
- Are these the eggs?
- Yes.

203
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:50,544
Theyjumped out of their shells
and cooked on the counter.

204
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:56,212
And that's when I heard that noise
coming from the refrigerator.

205
00:25:56,386 --> 00:26:00,799
Would you like
to check the refrigerator?.

206
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:05,677
Let me check the fridge. Good call.

207
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:16,195
Oh, my God.
Look at all the junk food!

208
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:21,869
This wasn't here. There was
nothing here. There was a space, -

209
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:26,615
- and a building with flames coming
out of it. And there were creatures.

210
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:31,584
They were growling and snarling,
and I heard a voice say "Zuul".

211
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:38,173
- I'm not getting any reading.
- Are you using that correctly?.

212
00:26:38,345 --> 00:26:42,757
I think so.
There are no animals in there.

213
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:46,930
Either I have a monster
in my kitchen or I'm crazy.

214
00:26:47,103 --> 00:26:52,774
- I don't think you're crazy.
- That makes me feel so much better.

215
00:26:56,363 --> 00:27:02,781
All I have is my work.
There's nothing else in my life.

216
00:27:02,953 --> 00:27:07,200
I meet you, and I say, "There's
someone with the same problem."

217
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:11,122
We both have the same problem:
You.

218
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:18,460
I'm gonna go for broke.

219
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:24,715
- I am madly in love with you.
- Will you please leave?

220
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:30,977
Then she threw me out of her life.
She thought I was a creep.

221
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:34,563
You are so odd.

222
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:41,113
- No ...
- I've got it!

223
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:45,280
- I'll prove myself to you.
- That's not necessary.

224
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:48,869
I'll solve your problem.
Then you'll say:

225
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,792
"Venkman gets things done."

226
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,918
"l wonder what makes him tick. Would
he like to know what makes me tick?. "

227
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:01,882
- You'll think of me after I'm gone.
- I bet I will.

228
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:05,510
No kiss?

229
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:19,691
- To our first customer.
- To our first and only customer.

230
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,151
I need some cash.
I should take her out to dinner.

231
00:28:26,328 --> 00:28:31,618
This feast represents
the last of the petty cash.

232
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,535
Slow down.

233
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:43,042
Hello, Ghostbusters.
Of course they're serious.

234
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,547
You do? You have?

235
00:28:48,725 --> 00:28:50,801
No kidding?

236
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:55,224
Just give me the address.

237
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:59,147
Of course,
they'll be totally discreet.

238
00:29:00,445 --> 00:29:04,739
Thank you.
We got one!

239
00:29:09,996 --> 00:29:12,748
It's a call!

240
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,578
Hey, has anybody seen a ghost?

241
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:08,012
Thank you for coming so quickly.
They're starting to ask questions.

242
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,427
- Has it happened before?
- We all know about the 12th floor.

243
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:18,888
It's been quiet for years, until two
weeks ago. It was never this bad.

244
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:23,312
- Did you ever report it?
- Heavens, no.

245
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:29,441
The owners don't like us to talk
about it. Can we handle it quietly?.

246
00:30:29,618 --> 00:30:33,318
Don't worry. We handle
this kind of thing all the time.

247
00:30:42,297 --> 00:30:45,631
Are you supposed to be a cosmonaut?

248
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:49,798
We're exterminators.
Someone saw a cockroach on twelve.

249
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:55,013
- That's got to be some cockroach.
- It'll bite your head off.

250
00:30:58,188 --> 00:31:01,853
- Going up?
- I'll take the next one.

251
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:08,197
We really haven't had
a successful test of this equipment.

252
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:12,356
- I blame myself.
- No sense worrying now.

253
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:17,951
Why worry?. Each of us is wearing
an unlicensed nuclear accelerator.

254
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:22,668
Let's get ready. Switch me on.

255
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:03,043
What the hell are you doing?

256
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:06,461
- Sorry.
- We thought you were someone else.

257
00:32:09,926 --> 00:32:14,469
- Successful test.
- I guess so.

258
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:18,637
- We better split up.
- We can do more damage that way.

259
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:49,461
Venkman!

260
00:32:57,557 --> 00:33:03,144
Disgusting blob ...
I'll have to hold him myself.

261
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:50,433
- Come in, Ray.
- Venkman! I saw it! I saw it!

262
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:56,446
- It's right here, looking at me.
- He's an ugly little spud.

263
00:33:56,616 --> 00:34:01,444
- I think he can hear you.
- Don't move. It won't hurt you.

264
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,506
- What happened?
- He slimed me.

265
00:34:20,682 --> 00:34:25,344
Great! Actual physical contact.
Can you move?

266
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,515
- Ray! Come in, please.
- Spengler, I'm with Venkman!

267
00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:34,939
- He got slimed!
- Great. Save some forme.

268
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:38,648
Get down here.
It wentinto a ballroom.

269
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:47,498
If you and your staff could wait
here, we'll take care of everything.

270
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,603
There it is! On the ceiling!

271
00:35:10,148 --> 00:35:13,102
That's the one that got me.

272
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,113
Ready?. Throw it!

273
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:38,551
- I did that. It's my fault.
- The table broke the fall.

274
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:44,139
I forgot to tell you
not to cross the streams.

275
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:46,845
- Why?.
- It would be bad.

276
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:51,063
What do you mean, bad?

277
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:57,150
Imagine all life stopping and every
molecule in your body exploding.

278
00:35:58,029 --> 00:36:04,317
- Total protonic reversal.
- That's bad. Important safety tip.

279
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:09,286
Ray, take the left.
Egon, take the right.

280
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:18,338
Ray, give me one high and outside.

281
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:38,183
All right. Hold it!
Nice shooting, Tex!

282
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:43,195
The room will be ready
as soon as your guests are with us.

283
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:48,527
He's gonna move! I need some room
to put the trap down!

284
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:52,707
Excuse me, please.

285
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:03,380
- We have to get this in the clear.
- Wait! I always wanted to do this.

286
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:12,051
- The flowers are still standing.
- I want a confinement stream. Go!

287
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,725
Hold him up there!
He's gonna move! Go!

288
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:22,145
- It's working, Ray.
- Start bringing him down.

289
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:26,486
Maybe now you won't slime a guy
with one of these.

290
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,076
Shorten your stream!

291
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:35,870
- Don't look directly in the trap.
- I looked in the trap, Ray.

292
00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:41,251
Bring your streams off
when I close the trap. Now!

293
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:04,445
It's in there.

294
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:10,160
That wasn't such a chore.

295
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:15,913
- I want that door open now.
- Stand over there.

296
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:21,458
- We came, saw and kicked its ass!
- Did you see it?

297
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:28,381
- What is it? Will there be more?
- A focused, non-terminal phantasm.

298
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:33,133
A class-5, full-roaming vapour.
A nasty one, too.

299
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:36,056
Let's talk seriously.

300
00:38:36,229 --> 00:38:41,022
The entrapment
will cost $4,000, -

301
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:48,440
- but we have a special on storage
of the beast for $1 ,000.

302
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:52,199
$5,000? I won't pay it.

303
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:56,154
That's all right,
we can just put it back.

304
00:38:56,374 --> 00:39:00,503
No, no!
All right. Anything.

305
00:39:00,712 --> 00:39:05,089
Thank you.
Hope we can help you again.

306
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:13,218
Today, the entire Eastern Seaboard
is talking ofparanormal activity.

307
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:20,521
Alleged ghostsightings have been
reported across the tri-state area.

308
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,068
My Grandma would spin yarns
about a spectral locomotive -

309
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:29,448
- that would rocket past
her farm, but now ...

310
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:37,742
Ghost Fever Grips New York

311
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:45,249
Ghost Cops Bust Chinatown Spook

312
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:57,925
The phone-in topic is ghostbusting.
More sightings are reported.

313
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:03,228
Some maintain that the paranormal
eliminators are the cause of it all.

314
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:29,085
The Ghostbusters are atlt again.
This time, at a fashionable club.

315
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:33,755
They fought the pesky poltergeist,
then danced the night away-

316
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:39,311
- wlth some ofthe ladies
who wltnessed the disturbance.

317
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:44,554
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
No job's too big. No fee's too big.

318
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:48,439
Does it have arms and legs?

319
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:54,615
There's one big question
on everybody's mind:

320
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:57,613
"How is Elvis?"

321
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:47,076
Do you believe in UFOs, astral
projections, telepathy, ESP, -

322
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:55,297
- full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of Atlantis?

323
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:59,717
If there's a steady paycheque,
I'll believe anything.

324
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:05,685
- I have to get some sleep.
- You don't look good.

325
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:10,061
- I don't?
- You didn't use to look like this.

326
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:18,701
- Here's the paper on Brooklyn.
- Here's tonight's worksheet.

327
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:24,823
- Mr. Zeddmore came about the job.
- You're hired. Ray Stanz, Venkman.

328
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,001
Can you help me, please?

329
00:42:30,797 --> 00:42:32,837
Welcome aboard.

330
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:39,717
These guest conductors
shouldn't scream at us in German.

331
00:42:39,931 --> 00:42:44,724
The man isn't competent
to conduct a symphony orchestra.

332
00:42:44,936 --> 00:42:48,555
Could you wait here a minute?

333
00:42:56,531 --> 00:43:01,240
- This is a surprise.
- That was a wonderful rehearsal.

334
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:08,202
- You're the best one in your row.
- Most people can't single me out.

335
00:43:08,376 --> 00:43:13,252
I don't have to take this abuse from
you. Everyone wants to abuse me.

336
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:18,762
You're a big celebrity now.
Do you have some information for me?

337
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:28,306
- Who's the stiff?
- One of the world's best musicians.

338
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,103
- Do you have information for me?
- I'd rather tell you in private.

339
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,273
I found the name "Zuul".

340
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:43,402
It refers to a demigod worshipped
around 6000 BC by the ...

341
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:49,365
- Hittites.
- The Mesopotamians and Sumerians.

342
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:55,045
Zuul was the minion of Gozer.
What's Gozer?.

343
00:43:55,215 --> 00:44:00,091
- Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
- What's he doing in my icebox?.

344
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:06,466
Could we meet Thursday night
and exchange information?

345
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:09,561
I can't. I'm busy.

346
00:44:09,729 --> 00:44:13,063
You seem to think
there is something wrong up here.

347
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:18,607
That I enjoy spending my evenings
with my clients. No ...

348
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,315
I'm making an exception
in your case because ...

349
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:27,071
... I respect you.
As an artist, and as a dresser, too.

350
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,830
This is magnificent.

351
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:35,746
- I'll see you Thursday.
- I'll bring the Roylance Guide.

352
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,844
- Who the hell is that?
- Just an old friend.

353
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,848
See you Thursday!
Sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.

354
00:44:50,061 --> 00:44:54,937
I'm glad you feeling better.
You're still pale, though.

355
00:44:55,108 --> 00:44:59,058
- What does he do?
- He's a scientist.

356
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:14,329
This is where we store
all the vapours and slimers we trap.

357
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:20,007
A loaded trap here. Open.
Unlock the system. Insert the trap.

358
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,549
Release.

359
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:28,713
Close. Lock the system.
Set your entry grid.

360
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:34,895
Neutronise the field. When the light
is green, the trap is clean.

361
00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:38,107
The ghost is incarcerated.

362
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:43,567
- There's a man from the EPA here.
- What does he want?

363
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:51,030
I don't know. I'm working too hard.
You promised to hire more help.

364
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:56,413
Someone with your qualifications
could easily find a good job -

365
00:45:56,586 --> 00:46:01,082
- in either food service
or housekeeping.

366
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:05,884
- Are you gonna answer that?
- I've quit betterjobs than this.

367
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:09,340
- Ghostbusters! What do you want?
- Can I help you?

368
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:14,427
I'm Walter Peck. I represent
the Environmental Protection Agency.

369
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:18,229
Great. How's it going down there?

370
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:25,273
- Are you Peter Venkman?
- Yes, I'm Dr. Venkman.

371
00:46:25,448 --> 00:46:31,783
- Exactly what are you a doctor of?
- Parapsychology and psychology.

372
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:37,157
I see. And now you catch ghosts.

373
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:40,123
You could say that.

374
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:44,793
- How many have you caught?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

375
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,669
Where do you put these ghosts
once you catch them?

376
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,634
Into a storage facility.

377
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:55,936
- Is the facility on these premises?
- Yes.

378
00:46:56,104 --> 00:47:00,647
- May I see the storage facility?.
- No.

379
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:07,740
- Why not?
- You did not use the magic word.

380
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:16,412
- What is the magic word?
- "Please".

381
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:23,795
- May I please see the facility?.
- Why do you want to see it?

382
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:31,712
I want to know what you do here.
There are wild stories in the media.

383
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,101
We want to assess any environmental
impact from your operation, -

384
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:41,430
- Iike the presence of noxious,
hazardous chemicals.

385
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:45,902
You show me,
or I'll get a court order.

386
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:50,856
I'll sue your ass
for wrongful prosecution.

387
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,866
You can have it your way.

388
00:47:55,038 --> 00:48:00,412
It's crowded in there,
and my data points to something big.

389
00:48:00,585 --> 00:48:03,041
What do you mean, big?

390
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:10,669
Say this Twinkie depicts the normal
amount of psychokinetic energy ...

391
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:17,892
According to this morning's sample,
it would be a Twinkie 35 feet long.

392
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:21,519
That's a big Twinkie.

393
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,352
We could be on the verge of a PKE
surge of dangerous proportions.

394
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:33,782
We just had a visit from
the Environmental Protection Agency.

395
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:38,163
- Tell him about the Twinkie.
- What about the Twinkie?

396
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:38,964
Dana, it's you! Come in.
You're missing a classic party.

397
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:43,934
I have a date.

398
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,146
You made a date? Tonight?

399
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:53,151
I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.

400
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:59,282
That's okay,
you can bring him along.

401
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:03,155
Maybe we'll stop by, okay?.

402
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:09,917
I'll tell everybody you're coming.
We're gonna play Twister and ...

403
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:14,384
Let me in! It's Louis!

404
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:45,616
Hello ... Hi, Mom.
I've been busy.

405
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:51,498
Everything is fine.
No, just that one time.

406
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:56,050
Oh, I am ... I will.

407
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:01,930
I won't.
Mom, I have to go. I have a date.

408
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,307
No one you know.

409
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,054
He's a Ghostbuster.

410
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,895
Those guys on TV.

411
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:20,868
I'll have to let you know.
Love to Dad. Bye.

412
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,303
Oh, shit.

413
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:22,835
- Do you have any Exedrin?
- I have acetylsalicylic acid.

414
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:29,135
600 tablets costs the same
as 300 of a name brand. Good advice.

415
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:33,138
Smoked salmon from Nova Scotia,
$24.95 a pound.

416
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,896
It only cost $14.12 after taxes.

417
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:41,942
This is a promotional expense,
so I invited clients, not friends.

418
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:46,613
Have some of the Brie.
Is it too warm in here for the Brie?

419
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,825
- Louis, I'm going home.
- Don't leave yet.

420
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:53,991
Maybe if we start dancing,
others will join in.

421
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,543
Okay.

422
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,845
I've got to get the door.

423
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:07,176
Ted! Annette! I'm glad you came!

424
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:11,010
This is Ted and Annette Flemming!

425
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:14,349
Ted has a business in receivership.

426
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,858
Annette's drawing a salary
from a deferred bonus.

427
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:23,028
They have 15,000
left on the house. So they're okay!

428
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,860
Who wants to play Parcheesi?

429
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,874
Who brought the dog?

430
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:57,899
Help! There's a bear loose
in my apartment!

431
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,397
A bear in his apartment ...

432
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:15,448
There are not supposed to be
pets in the building.

433
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:35,104
Let me in.
There's got to be a way in here.

434
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,566
Let me in!

435
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:54,239
Nice doggie.
Maybe I have a Milkbone.

436
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:19,647
- What happened?
- Someone brought a cougar in here.

437
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:24,062
I'm going to Dana Barrett's.

438
00:55:43,756 --> 00:55:46,247
Hello.

439
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:54,304
- That's a different look for you.
- Are you the Kéymaster?.

440
00:55:54,475 --> 00:55:57,429
Not that I know of.

441
00:56:08,822 --> 00:56:15,536
- Are you the Kéymaster.
- Yes. I'm a friend of his.

442
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:23,127
- I didn't get your name.
- I am Zuul, the Gatekeeper.

443
00:56:27,091 --> 00:56:33,343
- What are we doing today?.
- Preparing for the coming of Gozer.

444
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:39,269
The Destructor.

445
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:48,395
Are we still going out?

446
00:56:49,613 --> 00:56:53,113
You could have picked up the place.

447
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:58,738
- Do you want this body?.
- Is this a trick question?

448
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:08,587
- I guess the roses worked.
- Take me now, sub-creature.

449
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,670
We never talk anymore.

450
00:57:11,844 --> 00:57:17,265
I make it a rule not to get involved
with possessed people.

451
00:57:19,226 --> 00:57:25,311
- It's really more of a guideline.
- I want you inside me.

452
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,311
I can't. You have at least
two people in there already.

453
00:57:31,488 --> 00:57:38,369
It might be a little crowded. Stop
disturbing Dr. Venkman and relax.

454
00:57:38,537 --> 00:57:42,238
Put your hands on your chest.

455
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:47,244
What I'd really like to do
is talk to Dana.

456
00:57:47,421 --> 00:57:52,795
- Dana, it's Peter.
- There is no Dana, only Zuul.

457
00:57:52,968 --> 00:57:57,879
Zuulie, you nut. Come on.
I want to talk to Dana.

458
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:02,849
Relax. Dana.
Can I talk to Dana?

459
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:09,390
- There is no Dana, only Zuul.
- You must have some singing voice.

460
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:17,113
I'll count to three. If I can't
talk to Dana, there'll be trouble.

461
00:58:17,284 --> 00:58:20,202
One ...

462
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:23,870
Two ...

463
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:27,955
Two and a half ...

464
00:59:09,753 --> 00:59:12,957
Please come down.

465
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:18,423
I am the Kéymaster.
The Destructor will come.

466
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,767
Gatekeeper.

467
00:59:35,487 --> 00:59:42,985
I am Vinz Clortho, Kéymaster of
Gozer. Are you the Gatekeeper?.

468
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,949
Hey, do you want a ride?

469
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:59,040
Wait for the sign.
Our prisoners will be released.

470
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:04,344
- You'll perish in flames!
- What an asshole.

471
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:15,607
- Dropping off or picking up?
- Dropping off.

472
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:25,700
We picked up this guy.
I'm afraid to lock him up.

473
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:30,699
I know you guys are into this stuff,
so I figured we'd check with you.

474
01:00:34,004 --> 01:00:40,541
- Are you the Gatekeeper?.
- You'd better bring him inside.

475
01:00:42,721 --> 01:00:49,638
- How kind. You're a humanitarian.
- I don't think he's human.

476
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:02,820
- What's your name?
- Vinz Clortho, Kéymaster of Gozer.

477
01:01:03,033 --> 01:01:07,861
His name is Louis Tully.
He lives on Central Park West.

478
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:12,415
- Do you want coffee, Mr. Tully?.
- Do I ..?

479
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:17,330
- Yes, have some.
- Yes, have some.

480
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:22,210
Vinz, what sign are you waiting for?.

481
01:01:22,386 --> 01:01:26,300
Gozer the Traveller will come
in a pre-chosen form.

482
01:01:26,473 --> 01:01:30,222
During the rectification of
the Vuldronaii, he came as a Torb.

483
01:01:30,394 --> 01:01:38,105
During the reconciliation of the
Meketrex, he came as a giant Sloar!

484
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:43,153
Many Shubs and Zuuls were roasted
in the Sloar that day!

485
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:47,487
- Egon.
- Excuse me.

486
01:01:48,704 --> 01:01:51,907
There's something strange
about that man.

487
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:58,544
I have a terrible feeling that
something awful will happen to you.

488
01:02:01,258 --> 01:02:04,923
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

489
01:02:05,095 --> 01:02:08,013
I'll get it.

490
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:13,391
- Hello?
- Egon, It's Peter.

491
01:02:13,562 --> 01:02:16,765
I have news from Gozer.

492
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,396
I'm with Dana Barrett.

493
01:02:19,568 --> 01:02:25,073
The Goze has been putting some
moves on my would-be girlfriend.

494
01:02:25,282 --> 01:02:28,900
I think we can get her
on "Wild Kingdom".

495
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,698
I gave her 300 cc's of Thorazine.
She's gonna take a nap now.

496
01:02:33,874 --> 01:02:38,583
She says she's the Gatekeeper.
Does that make sense to you?

497
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:44,217
- The Kéymaster is here with me.
- We have to get them together.

498
01:02:46,136 --> 01:02:52,673
- That would be very dangerous.
- Hold on to him. I'm on my way.

499
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,140
Good.

500
01:02:55,312 --> 01:03:00,307
Thank you, Vinz.
I need Ray here immediately.

501
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:11,364
I have to go to work.
Stay here in bed until I get back.

502
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:25,300
- Ray, do you believe in God?
- Never met him.

503
01:03:25,467 --> 01:03:30,129
I do. I love Jesus' style.

504
01:03:30,347 --> 01:03:36,516
- The roofcap is made of magnesium.
- What are you so involved with?

505
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:43,057
These blueprints for Dana Barrett's
apartment building are very strange.

506
01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:50,732
Do you remember in the Bible
about when the dead would rise?

507
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:54,528
I remember Revelations 7:12.

508
01:03:54,705 --> 01:04:01,289
"l looked as he opened the 6th seal.
The sun became black as sackcloth."

509
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:06,420
- "The moon became as blood."
- "The seas boiled. The skies fell."

510
01:04:08,093 --> 01:04:11,213
- Judgement day.
- Judgement day.

511
01:04:11,388 --> 01:04:16,216
Every religion has its myth
about the end of the world.

512
01:04:16,393 --> 01:04:23,606
Maybe we've been so busy lately
because the dead have been rising.

513
01:04:28,822 --> 01:04:32,405
How about a little music?

514
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:15,532
This way.

515
01:05:22,626 --> 01:05:24,583
Excuse me!

516
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:29,955
- Where do think you're going?
- Step aside or you'll be arrested.

517
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:34,677
You can't come in here
without a warrant or something.

518
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:42,677
Cease all commerce order, seizure
of premises and an inspection order.

519
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:51,486
- I'd like to do one more test.
- Egon, he says they have a warrant.

520
01:05:51,655 --> 01:05:55,404
- This is private property.
- Shut these all off.

521
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:58,779
That would be hazardous.

522
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:05,793
You're facing federal prosecution.
Shut off the beams, or we'll do it.

523
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:16,297
Turning the high-voltage containment
system off would cause an explosion.

524
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:20,090
Don't patronise me! I'm not stupid!

525
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:25,558
At ease, Officer. I want to
co-operate in any way I can.

526
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:32,066
You had your chance, but you
insulted me. Now it's my turn.

527
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:38,607
- He wants to shut down the grid.
- We won't be held responsible.

528
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:44,242
- Shut it off!
- Don't do it! I'm warning you.

529
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:47,916
I've never seen
anything like this before.

530
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,171
Just shut it off.

531
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:57,795
- Don't be a jerk.
- If he does that again, shoot him.

532
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:02,219
- Don't tell me how to do myjob.
- Shut it off!

533
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:28,585
Oh, shit.

534
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:46,258
Clear the building!

535
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:20,758
- This is the sign!
- Yeah. We're going out of business.

536
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:37,438
- What happened?
- The storage facility blew.

537
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:42,191
- That's bad, isn't it?
- Where's the Kéymaster?.

538
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,737
- Shit!
- Who's the Kéymaster?.

539
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:52,117
Arrest these men! They are violating
the Environmental Protection Act.

540
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:56,707
- This explosion is a result of it!
- Your mother ..!

541
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:46,761
Columbia Building, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry.

542
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:46,441
Guard! I want to make a phone call!

543
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:49,452
I wasn't even there!

544
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:56,951
The roofcap structure is like what
NASA uses to identify dead pulsars.

545
01:10:57,127 --> 01:11:02,039
Cold-riveted girders
with cores of pure selenium.

546
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,509
Does everybody get it?

547
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:11,839
- They're not made that way anymore?
- Nobody ever made them like this!

548
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:16,395
The architect was either a genius
or a wacko!

549
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:21,439
Ray, for a moment,
pretend I don't know anything -

550
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:24,938
- about metallurgy or physics.

551
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:30,618
- Just tell me what's going on.
- You never studied.

552
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:35,039
The whole building
is a super-conductive antenna -

553
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:40,877
- that was designed expressly
for pulling in spiritual turbulence.

554
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:46,385
Your girlfriend lives in the corner
penthouse of Spook Central.

555
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:52,508
She's not my girlfriend.
She's interesting as a client -

556
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:56,134
- because she sleeps four feet
above her covers.

557
01:11:56,353 --> 01:12:00,433
- She barks, drools, claws.
- It's the building.

558
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:05,234
This building
is the door to something terrible.

559
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:09,651
The architect was lvo Shandor.

560
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:14,321
He was a doctor who performed
a lot of unnecessary surgery.

561
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:19,953
- He started a secret society.
- Let me guess. Gozer worshippers.

562
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:23,461
- Right.
- "No studying" ...

563
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:30,879
After WW l, Shandor decided
society was too sick to survive.

564
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:37,847
He had nearly a thousand followers.
They conducted rituals on the roof.

565
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:44,521
They intended to bring about the end
of the world. Now it may happen.

566
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:52,068
So be good, forgoodness'sake!
somebody's coming

567
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:57,533
- We have to find a judge.
- Hey! Hold it!

568
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,079
Are we gonna tell a federal judge -

569
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:05,376
- that some mouldy Babylonian god
is gonna tear up the city?.

570
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:11,384
- Sumerian, not Babylonian.
- I've got to get my own lawyer.

571
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:16,216
Ghostbusters, the mayor wants you.
The whole island's going crazy.

572
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,642
I've got to split,
the mayor wants me.

573
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:47,245
- I am the Kéymaster.
- I am the Gatekeeper.

574
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:34,507
Stay back!

575
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:47,888
- You're not giving me any answers!
- We're blocking bridges, roads ...

576
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:52,361
- The Ghostbusters are here.
- Okay, the Ghostbusters.

577
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:58,532
- Where's this Peck?.
- I'm Peck. I want to make a report.

578
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:03,910
These men use nerve gasses
to induce hallucinations.

579
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:08,661
People think they're seeing ghosts
and they call these bozos, -

580
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:12,046
- who show up
with a fake light show.

581
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:18,005
- Dickless here shut off our grid.
- They caused an explosion!

582
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:24,016
- Is this true?
- Yes. This man has no dick.

583
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:33,233
- All right.
- That's what I heard.

584
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:39,359
- What is this?
- It was no light show this morning.

585
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:45,449
I've seen every form of combustion,
but this beats the hell out of me.

586
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:49,207
The walls in the 53rd Precinct
were bleeding.

587
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:54,710
- Good afternoon.
- Your Eminence.

588
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:01,299
- How are you?
- You're looking good.

589
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:05,222
We're in a real fix.
What should I do?

590
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:11,515
The church won't take any position
on the religious implications.

591
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:15,606
Personally,
I think it's a sign from God.

592
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:19,563
- But don't quote me on that.
- That's a smart move.

593
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:26,285
I won't call a press conference
and tell everyone to start praying.

594
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:32,744
I've only been with the company two
weeks, but I have to tell you, -

595
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:39,754
- these things are real. I have seen
shit that'll turn you white.

596
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:42,883
You can believe Mr. Pecker, -

597
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:47,351
- or accept the onset of a disaster
of Biblical proportion.

598
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:53,605
- What do you mean?
- Old Testament, wrath-of-God stuff.

599
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:59,772
- Fire and brimstone coming down.
- Earthquakes, volcanoes ...

600
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:05,364
- The dead rising from the grave!
- Human sacrifice, mass hysteria!

601
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:10,959
Enough, I get the point!
But what if you're wrong?

602
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:16,085
Nothing happens! We go to jail,
quietly. We'll enjoy it.

603
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:22,377
But if I'm right, and we can stop
this thing ...

604
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:31,512
... you will have saved the lives
of millions of registered voters.

605
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:42,021
I don't believe you're seriously
considering listening to these men.

606
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:51,823
- Get him out of here.
- Bye.

607
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:56,503
- I'll fix you, Venkman.
- I'm gonna miss him!

608
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:01,833
What do you need from me?

609
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:19,483
Let's run some red lights!

610
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:23,919
Hello, New York!

611
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:37,061
Dr. Ray Stanz.
The heart of the Ghostbusters!

612
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:42,937
They love you ...
I like that shirt, friend.

613
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:51,822
Got to run. Got a date with a ghost.
Whatever happens, be professional.

614
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:26,946
This might require overtime!

615
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:25,080
There they are!

616
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:37,299
It's all right. We're fine!

617
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:40,892
We can handle it!
They want to play rough.

618
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:46,065
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

619
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:51,823
Do you want to play rough?
Let's do it!

620
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:22,349
- Where are we?
- In the teens, somewhere ...

621
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:27,230
When we get to twenty, tell me.
I'm gonna throw up.

622
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:02,808
- Twenty-two. Is this it?
- Yeah.

623
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:17,775
- Art Deco. Very nice.
- It's at the end of the hall.

624
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:00,862
Where do these stairs go?

625
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:05,452
They go up.

626
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,374
Go ahead. Come on.

627
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,878
Dana!

628
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:14,107
Okay, she's a dog.

629
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:56,525
It's a girl.

630
01:26:00,698 --> 01:26:04,695
- It's Gozer.
- I thought Gozer was a man.

631
01:26:04,869 --> 01:26:08,569
Whatever it is, it has to get by us.

632
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:11,417
Go get her, Ray!

633
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:27,546
Gozer the Gozarian!

634
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:35,056
Good evening. As a representative
of the city of New York, -

635
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:38,233
- I order you to cease
all supernatural activity -

636
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:43,029
- and return
to your place of origin.

637
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:48,448
- That ought to do it. Thanks, Ray.
- Are you a god?

638
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,547
- No.
- Then ... die!

639
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:31,120
When someone asks you
if you're a god, say "yes"!

640
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:36,199
All right, this chick is toast!

641
01:27:48,264 --> 01:27:52,427
- Grab your stick.
- Holding!

642
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:56,344
- Heat them up!
- Smoking!

643
01:27:56,522 --> 01:27:59,476
- Make them hard!
- Ready!

644
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:04,893
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

645
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:06,981
Throw it!

646
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:19,789
- Nimble little minx.
- Go full stream.

647
01:28:20,004 --> 01:28:23,503
Aim for the flat-top!

648
01:28:32,016 --> 01:28:34,933
That wasn't so hard.

649
01:28:40,024 --> 01:28:44,520
We neutronised it.
A complete particle reversal.

650
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:50,069
- We had the tools and the talent!
- It's Miller time.

651
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:54,572
Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad.

652
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,499
Look out!

653
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:38,362
Sub-creatures! Gozer the Gozerian,
the Destructor, Zildrohar...

654
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:44,288
The Travellerhas come.
Choose andperish.

655
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:47,879
What do you mean?

656
01:29:48,092 --> 01:29:53,632
Choose.
Choose the form ofthe Destructor.

657
01:29:53,806 --> 01:29:58,883
I get it! Very cute.

658
01:29:59,103 --> 01:30:05,936
Whatever we think of will appear
and destroy us. Empty your heads!

659
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:12,230
- Don't think of anything.
- The choice is made.

660
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:16,904
- The Travellerhas come.
- Nobody chose anything!

661
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:22,370
Did you choose anything? Did you?
I didn't choose anything!

662
01:30:32,303 --> 01:30:37,593
I couldn't help it.
It just popped in there.

663
01:30:37,808 --> 01:30:43,893
- What just popped in there?
- I tried to think.

664
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:47,683
- Look!
- No! It can't be.

665
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:51,560
- What did you do?
- Oh, shit!

666
01:31:03,334 --> 01:31:07,166
It's the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.

667
01:31:36,617 --> 01:31:43,154
- You don't see thatevery day.
- It was something I loved as a kid.

668
01:31:43,374 --> 01:31:48,332
Something that could never
destroy us. Mr. Stay-Puft.

669
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:50,911
Nice thinking.

670
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:55,253
We used to roast Stay-Puft
marshmallows by the fire.

671
01:31:57,054 --> 01:32:01,218
Ray has gone bye-bye.
What have you got left?

672
01:32:01,392 --> 01:32:07,015
I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rational thought.

673
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:19,735
- Oh, no.
- Mother puss bucket!

674
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:30,127
- Nobody steps on a church here!
- One, two, three, roast him!

675
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:54,443
It's funny, us getting killed
by a 100-foot marshmallow man.

676
01:32:54,612 --> 01:33:00,816
Stay-Puft is okay. He's a sailor
in New York. We'll get him laid.

677
01:33:05,206 --> 01:33:11,042
We could reverse
the particle flow through the gate.

678
01:33:11,212 --> 01:33:14,581
- How?.
- We'll cross the streams.

679
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:19,834
- You said that was bad.
- Cross the streams ...

680
01:33:20,012 --> 01:33:26,097
You're endangering the nice lady
who paid us before she became a dog.

681
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:30,011
There's a slim chance we'll survive.

682
01:33:35,986 --> 01:33:42,950
- I love this plan! Let's do it!
- This job isn't worth the money.

683
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:49,033
Hurry!

684
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:53,829
See you on the other side.

685
01:33:55,339 --> 01:33:58,257
Nice working with you.

686
01:34:06,517 --> 01:34:09,720
Turn them on, Spengler!

687
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:19,997
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

688
01:35:23,135 --> 01:35:28,509
Venkman ... Spengler!
Venkman!

689
01:35:32,102 --> 01:35:37,808
Spengler!
Spengler, are you okay?.

690
01:35:37,983 --> 01:35:42,978
- I feel like the floor of a taxi.
- Venky!

691
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:45,942
Thank God.

692
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:49,984
- Are you okay?.
- I'm all right.

693
01:35:50,162 --> 01:35:54,160
- Are you okay?.
- Fine.

694
01:36:01,799 --> 01:36:05,084
It smells like barbecued dog hair.

695
01:36:05,261 --> 01:36:09,389
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

696
01:36:09,557 --> 01:36:13,056
I'm sorry. I just forgot.

697
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:29,316
Look!

698
01:36:56,395 --> 01:37:00,096
Turn on the lights!

699
01:37:00,274 --> 01:37:03,643
Go check on that little guy.

700
01:37:07,865 --> 01:37:10,320
What happened?

701
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:22,666
Where am l?

702
01:37:22,838 --> 01:37:25,709
Oh, hi.

703
01:37:28,511 --> 01:37:33,054
The superintendent will be pissed.

704
01:37:33,224 --> 01:37:38,051
- Are you okay?.
- Who are you guys?

705
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:41,811
We're the Ghostbusters.

706
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:48,274
- Who does your taxes?
- You are a fortunate individual.

707
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:56,028
You have participated in the biggest
inter-dimensional rip since 1909.

708
01:37:56,205 --> 01:37:59,538
We'd like a sample of your brain.

709
01:38:02,878 --> 01:38:05,879
I love this town!

710
01:38:58,517 --> 01:39:06,263
What's going on? Does anyone want
an interview?. I'm an eyewitness!
