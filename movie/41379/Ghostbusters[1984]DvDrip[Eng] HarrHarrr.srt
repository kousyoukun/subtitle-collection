1
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:43,983
I'm gonna turn over the next card.
I want you to concentrate.

2
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:49,988
I want you to tell me
what you think it is.

3
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:52,990
Square.

4
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,990
Good guess. But wrong.

5
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,990
Clear your head.

6
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,990
All right. Tell me what you think it is.

7
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,994
ls it a star?

8
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,993
It is a star. Very good. That's great.

9
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:21,996
Okay. All right.

10
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:25,995
Think hard. What is it?

11
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:28,998
Circle.

12
00:03:28,998 --> 00:03:32,998
Close. But definitely wrong.

13
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:37,994
Okay.

14
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:38,992
-All right. Ready?
-Yeah.

15
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:41,994
All right.

16
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:45,994
What is it?

17
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,996
Come on.

18
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:52,996
Figure eight.

19
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:56,996
lncredible. That's 5 for 5.
You can't see these, can you?

20
00:03:56,996 --> 00:04:01,993
-You're not cheating me, are you?
-No, I swear they're just coming to me.

21
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:03,998
Okay.

22
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:07,998
-Nervous?
-Yes. I don't like this.

23
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:14,002
You only have 75 more to go, okay?
What's this one?

24
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,000
It's a coupe of wavy lines.

25
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,005
-Sorry. This isn't your lucky day.
-I know.

26
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:29,004
Wait--

27
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,007
I'm getting a little tired of this!

28
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:34,998
You volunteered, didn't you?
We're paying, aren't we?

29
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:38,001
Yeah, but I didn't know you were
gonna give me electric shocks!

30
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:41,003
What are you trying
to prove here, anyway?

31
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:45,003
I'm studying the effect of negative
reinforcement on ESP ability.

32
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:48,005
The effect? I'll tell you what
the effect is. It's pissing me off!

33
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:49,003
Well, then maybe my theory is correct!

34
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:55,007
-You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it.
-I will, mister!

35
00:04:57,002 --> 00:05:00,005
You may as well get used to that.

36
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:05,012
It's the kind of resentment that your
ability will provoke in some people.

37
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:10,009
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?

38
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,004
You're no fluke, Jennifer.

39
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:14,009
This is it. This is definitely it!

40
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,014
Did those UV lenses come in
for the video camera?

41
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:20,014
And that blank tape, I need it,
the one you erased yesterday.

42
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:25,011
-Will you excuse me for a second?
-Sure.

43
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:28,012
I'm right in the middle
of something, Ray.

44
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:30,008
I need more time with this subject.

45
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:33,010
Could you come back in an hour,
hour and a half?

46
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,015
Peter, at 1:40 p.m...

47
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:37,010
...at the main branch of The New York
Public Library on Fifth Avenue...

48
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,017
...1 0 people witnessed a free-floating,
full-torso, vaporous apparition.

49
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:45,010
It blew books off shelves
from 20 feet away...

50
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,014
...and scared the socks
off some poor librarian.

51
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,008
I'm very excited. I'm very pleased.

52
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:54,015
I want you to get right down there,
check it out, and get back to me.

53
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:57,018
You're coming with us on this one.
Spengler went down there.

54
00:05:57,018 --> 00:06:00,010
He took PKE valences,
went right off the top of the scale.

55
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:06,015
Buried the needle.
We're close on this one. I can feel it.

56
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:12,020
I can feel it. We're very, very close.

57
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,022
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd
like to work with you some more.

58
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:17,017
Perhaps you could come back
this evening, say at--?

59
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:19,022
Eight o'clock?

60
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:25,017
I was just going to say, 'Eight o'clock?'
You are a legitimate phenomenon.

61
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:27,022
As a friend, I must say...

62
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:30,024
...you've finally gone around the bend
on this ghost business.

63
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:34,024
You guys have been meeting
every schizo in the five boroughs...

64
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:37,016
...who says he has a paranormal
experience. What have you seen?

65
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:42,023
You forget, I was there at an undersea,
unexplained mass sponge migration.

66
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:48,018
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated
about a foot and a half.

67
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:54,023
-You're here.
-Yeah, what have you got?

68
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:58,023
This is big, this is very big.
There's definitely something here.

69
00:06:58,023 --> 00:07:02,023
Egon, this reminds me of the time you
tried to drill a hole through your head.

70
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:04,028
-Remember that?
-That would've worked if--

71
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:07,029
I'm Roger Delacorte.
Are you the men from the university?

72
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:11,029
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Stantz. Egon.

73
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,021
Thank you for coming. I hope we
can clear this up quickly and quietly.

74
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:19,027
Let's not rush things. We don't
even know what you have yet.

75
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:21,023
I don't remember seeing any legs...

76
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,025
...but it definitely had arms,
because it reached out for me.

77
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:26,030
Arms? I can't wait
to get a look at this thing.

78
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,029
Allce, I'll ask you a couple
of standard questions, okay?

79
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,025
Have you or any member
of your family...

80
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:36,024
...ever been diagnosed schizophrenic,
mentally incompetent?

81
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:40,034
My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

82
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:44,034
I'd call that a big yes.

83
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:48,034
Are you habitually using drugs,
stimulants, alcohol?

84
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,036
-No.
-No, no. Just asking.

85
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:55,036
Are you, Alice,
menstruating right now?

86
00:07:55,036 --> 00:07:59,036
-What has that got to do with it?
-Back off, man. I'm a scientist.

87
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:03,036
Ray, it's moving. Come on.

88
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:30,036
Look!

89
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,038
-This is hot, Ray.
-Symmetrical book-stacking.

90
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:42,036
Just like the Philadelphia
mass turbulence of 1947.

91
00:08:42,036 --> 00:08:45,038
You're right. No human being
would stack books like this.

92
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:51,043
Listen! Do you smell something?

93
00:08:57,038 --> 00:09:01,038
Talk about telekinetic activity.
Look at this mess.

94
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:04,040
Raymond, look at this.

95
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,045
Ectoplasmic residue.

96
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:10,043
-Venkman, get a sample of this.
-It's the real thing.

97
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:12,039
Somebody blows their nose,
and you wanna keep it?

98
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,043
I'd like to analyze it.

99
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:20,048
-There's more over here.
-I'm getting stronger readings here.

100
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:28,048
This way.

101
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:32,047
Come on.

102
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:42,051
Egon, your mucus.

103
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:52,046
This happen to you before?

104
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:56,046
First time?

105
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,055
It's here.

106
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:26,059
A full torso apparition. And it's real.

107
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:32,054
So, what do we do?

108
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:38,059
Could you come over here
and talk to me for a second, please?

109
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:41,061
Could you just come here
for a second, please?

110
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:44,054
Right over here.
Come here, Francine. Come here.

111
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:47,056
-What do we do?
-I don't know. What do you think?

112
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:49,061
Stop that!

113
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:52,063
We've gotta make contact.
One of us should try to speak to it.

114
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:56,062
Good idea.

115
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,058
Hello.

116
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:07,063
I'm Peter.

117
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:13,058
Where are you from? Originally.

118
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:18,065
All right. Okay.
The usual stuff isn't working.

119
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:24,060
Okay, I have a plan.
I know exactly what to do.

120
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,065
Now, stay close.

121
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:29,067
Stay close.

122
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,062
I know. Do exactly as I say.

123
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:33,067
Get ready. Ready?

124
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,067
Get her!

125
00:11:43,062 --> 00:11:46,064
-Did you see it? What was it?
-We'll get back to you.

126
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:50,064
Wait!

127
00:11:56,069 --> 00:12:01,066
''Get her.'' That was your whole plan.
Get her.

128
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:05,066
-It was scientific.
-I just got overexcited.

129
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:09,065
But wasn't it incredible, Pete?
We actually touched the etheric plane.

130
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:11,069
You know what this could mean
to the school?

131
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:14,072
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger
than the microchip.

132
00:12:14,072 --> 00:12:16,067
The experience wasn't
completely wasted.

133
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:18,072
According to these readings,
we have an excellent chance...

134
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,067
...of catching and holding a ghost.

135
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:24,067
This is great. lf the ionization rate is
constant for all ectoplasmic entities...

136
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,069
...we could really bust some heads.
ln a spiritual sense, of course.

137
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:30,071
Spengs, you serious
about this catching a ghost?

138
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:33,074
I'm always serious.

139
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:39,078
Egon, I'm gonna take back some
of the things I've said about you.

140
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:42,071
You've earned it.

141
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:48,075
The possibilities are limitless.
Hey, Dean Yeager.

142
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,072
I trust you're moving us
to better quarters on campus.

143
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,077
No, you're being moved off campus.

144
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:58,079
The Board of Regents has decided
to terminate your grant.

145
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,081
You are to vacate
these premises immediately.

146
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,074
This is preposterous.
I demand an explanation.

147
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,079
Fine. This university
will no longer continue...

148
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,079
...any funding of any kind
for your group's activities.

149
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,074
But the kids love us.

150
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:18,078
Dr. Venkman, we believe the purpose
of science is to serve mankind.

151
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,076
You, however, seem to regard science
as some kind of dodge or hustle.

152
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:25,079
Your theories are the worst kind
of popular tripe.

153
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,082
Your methods are sloppy, and your
conclusions are highly questionable.

154
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:32,082
You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman.

155
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:34,077
I see.

156
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:39,084
And you have no place in this
department or in this university.

157
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,086
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MlT or Stanford now.

158
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:45,079
They wouldn't touch us
with a 10-meter cattle prod.

159
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:47,084
You're always so concerned
about your reputation.

160
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:50,086
Einstein did his best stuff when
he was working as a patent clerk.

161
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:52,081
You know how much
a patent clerk earns?

162
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,083
The university gave us money.
We didn't have to produce anything.

163
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:59,083
You've never been out of college.
You don't know what it's like.

164
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,085
I've worked in the private sector.
They expect results.

165
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:04,090
For whatever reasons, Ray...

166
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:09,088
...call it fate, call it luck,
call it karma...

167
00:14:09,088 --> 00:14:12,090
...I believe that everything
happens for a reason.

168
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,090
I believe that we were destined
to get thrown out of this dump.

169
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:22,085
-For what purpose?
-To go into business for ourselves.

170
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:27,092
This ecto-containment system
Spengler and I have in mind...

171
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:33,087
...will require a load of capital.
Where will we get the money?

172
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:37,096
I don't know. I don't know.

173
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:40,088
You're never gonna regret this, Ray.

174
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,089
My parents left me that house.
I was born there.

175
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,092
You won't lose the house. Everybody
has three mortgages nowadays.

176
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:49,094
But at 19 percent?
You didn't even bargain with the guy.

177
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:51,089
Ray, for your information,
the interest rate alone...

178
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:54,091
...for the first five years
comes to 95,000 dollars.

179
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:58,091
Wlll you guys relax? We are
on the threshold of establishing...

180
00:14:58,091 --> 00:15:01,094
...the indispensable defense science
of the next decade:

181
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:04,096
Professional paranormal
investigations and eliminations.

182
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:08,096
The franchise rights alone will make
us rich beyond our wildest dreams.

183
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:12,096
There's office space,
sleeping quarters and showers...

184
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:14,100
...and there's a full kitchen.

185
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,098
It just seems a little pricey for a unique
fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.

186
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:21,093
What do you think, Egon?

187
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:23,098
I think this building
should be condemned.

188
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:26,100
There's metal fatigue
in all the load-bearing members.

189
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,102
The wiring is substandard.
It's inadequate for our power needs.

190
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:32,095
And the neighborhood
is like a demilitarized zone.

191
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:37,102
Hey, does this pole still work?

192
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:42,099
Wow, this place is great.
When can we move in?

193
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:48,104
You gotta try this pole.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

194
00:15:49,102 --> 00:15:55,106
Hey, we should stay here tonight,
sleep here. You know, to try it out.

195
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:07,105
-I think we'll take it.
-Good.

196
00:16:38,105 --> 00:16:42,105
Hi.

197
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:48,110
-Dana, it's you.
-Hi. Yes, Louis, it's me.

198
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,114
-I thought it was the drugstore.
-Are you sick?

199
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:52,110
No, I'm fine. I feel great.

200
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,112
Just ordered some more vitamins
and stuff. I was just exercising.

201
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:58,114
I taped 20-minute workout
and played it at high speed...

202
00:16:58,114 --> 00:17:01,116
...so it only took 1 0 minutes.
I got a great workout.

203
00:17:01,116 --> 00:17:01,116
Want to come in for a mineral water?

204
00:17:01,116 --> 00:17:05,116
I'd really like to, Louis,
but I have a rehearsal. Excuse me.

205
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:07,111
No sweat.
I'll take a rain check on that.

206
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:11,111
I have plenty of low-sodium mineral
water and other nutritious foods.

207
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:13,115
-But you already know that.
-I know that.

208
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,117
Listen, that reminds me, I'm having
a big party for all my clients.

209
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:18,112
My fourth anniversary
as an accountant.

210
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:20,117
Even though you do
your own tax return...

211
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:22,112
...stop by,
since you're my neighbor and all.

212
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:24,117
Thank you, Louis.
I'll really try to stop by.

213
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:27,119
You shouldn't leave your TV
on so loud when you go out.

214
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,114
The creep down the hall
phoned the manager.

215
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,119
That's strange.
I didn't realize I left it on.

216
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,112
I climbed on the ledge
and tried to disconnect the cable...

217
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:38,121
...but I couldn't get in,
so I turned up my TV real loud too...

218
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:41,114
...so everyone would think both our
TVs had something wrong with them.

219
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:46,121
Okay, so I'll see you later, huh?
I'll give you a call.

220
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:50,121
I gotta have a shower.

221
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,118
Are you troubled by strange noises
in the middle of the night?

222
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:58,121
Do you experience feelings of dread
in your basement or attic?

223
00:17:58,121 --> 00:18:01,123
Have you or any of your family ever
seen a spook, specter or ghost?

224
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:05,123
lf the answer is yes, pick up your
phone and call the professionals.

225
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:07,118
Ghostbusters.

226
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:09,123
Our courteous staff is on call
2 4 hours a day...

227
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:12,125
...to serve all your
supernatural-elimination needs.

228
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:16,125
We're ready to believe you.

229
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:27,133
Zuul.

230
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,135
You don't think it's too subtle?

231
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:36,140
You don't think people are gonna
drive down and not see the sign?

232
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:46,133
You can't park that here!

233
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:50,133
Everybody can relax, I found the car.

234
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,138
Needs some suspension work
and shocks...

235
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:57,135
...and brakes, brake pads, linings,
steering box, transmission, rear end.

236
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:58,133
-How much?
-Only 4800.

237
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:04,138
Maybe new rings, also mufflers,
a little wiring.

238
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:08,137
-Janine, any calls?
-No.

239
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:10,142
-Any messages?
-No.

240
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:15,139
-Any customers?
-No, Dr. Venkman.

241
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:18,141
It's a good job, isn't it?

242
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:21,143
Type something, will you?
We're paying for this stuff.

243
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:25,143
Don't stare at me.
You've got the bug eyes.

244
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:27,138
Janine?

245
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:33,143
Sorry about the ''bug eyes'' thing.
I'll be in my office.

246
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:36,145
You're very handy. I can tell.

247
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:41,143
-I bet you like to read a lot too.
-Print is dead.

248
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:45,142
Oh, that's very fascinating to me.
I read a lot myself.

249
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:50,150
Some people think I'm too intellectual,
but it's a fabulous way to spend time.

250
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,147
I also play racquetball.
Do you have any hobbies?

251
00:20:55,147 --> 00:21:01,151
I collect spores, molds and fungus.

252
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:06,148
Hello?

253
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,152
Excuse me. Is this--?
This is the Ghostbusters' office.

254
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:27,155
Yes, it is. Can I help you?

255
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:32,152
I don't have an appointment.
I'd like to talk to someone, please.

256
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:36,152
I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?

257
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:42,156
Well, I don't know. What I have
to say may sound a little unusual.

258
00:21:42,156 --> 00:21:45,149
That's all we get, day in, day out,
around this place.

259
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:47,154
-Come into my office, Miss....
-Barrett. Dana Barrett.

260
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:52,151
And this voice said, ''Zuul,'' and then I
slammed the refrigerator door and left.

261
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:55,154
That was two days ago, and I haven't
been back to my apartment.

262
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:58,156
Generally, you don't see that kind
of behavior in a major appliance.

263
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:00,161
What do you think it was?

264
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:02,156
Well, if I knew what it was,
I wouldn't be here.

265
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:04,159
Egon, what do you think?

266
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,159
She's telling the truth.
At least she thinks she is.

267
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,162
Well, of course I'm telling the truth.
Who would make up a story like that?

268
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:13,157
Some are people
who just want attention.

269
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,162
Others are nutballs
who come off the street.

270
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:20,158
You know what it could be? Past life
experience intruding on present time.

271
00:22:20,158 --> 00:22:23,160
Could be a memory stored
in the collective unconscious.

272
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,163
I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance
or telepathic contact either.

273
00:22:26,163 --> 00:22:29,155
I'm sorry, I don't believe
in any of those things.

274
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:32,158
Well, that's all right. I don't either.
But there are some things we do...

275
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:36,157
...standard procedures in a case
like this, which often bring us results.

276
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:39,160
I could go to Hall of Records
for the building's structural details.

277
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,162
Maybe the building has a history
of psychic turbulence.

278
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:43,160
Right. Good idea.

279
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,162
I could search ''Zuul''
in the usual literature.

280
00:22:46,162 --> 00:22:48,167
-Spates Catalog.
-Tobin's Spirit Guide.

281
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:52,167
I'll take Miss Barrett back
to her apartment and check her out.

282
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:56,166
I'll go check out
Miss Barrett's apartment. Okay?

283
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,169
Okay.

284
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,169
Thank you.

285
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:11,168
Please, let me.

286
00:23:11,168 --> 00:23:17,163
lf something's gonna happen here,
I want it to happen to me first.

287
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:23,168
That's the closet.

288
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:30,170
They hate this.

289
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,165
I like to torture them.

290
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:38,169
That's right, boys. It's Dr. Venkman!

291
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,173
It's a lot of space.

292
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,176
-Just you?
-Yes.

293
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:51,176
Good.

294
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:56,172
What is that thing you're doing?

295
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:59,174
It's technical.
It's one of our little toys.

296
00:23:59,174 --> 00:24:03,174
I see.

297
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:09,169
That's the bedroom.
But nothing ever happened in there.

298
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:13,179
What a crime.

299
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:16,171
You know, you don't act
like a scientist.

300
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:22,176
-They're usually pretty stiff.
-You're more like a game-show host.

301
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:31,173
That's the kitchen, huh?

302
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:43,182
-Dana, are these the eggs?
-Yes.

303
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:46,185
I was over there, and these eggs
just jumped right out of their shells...

304
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:49,177
-...and started to cook on the counter.
-That is weird.

305
00:24:49,177 --> 00:24:54,184
That's when I started to hear that awful
noise coming from the refrigerator.

306
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:59,181
You've come all this way. Would you
like to check the refrigerator?

307
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:05,186
Better check the fridge. Good call.

308
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:10,183
Oh, my God.

309
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:13,185
Look at all the junk food.

310
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:16,188
-No. Goddamn it! This wasn't--
-You actually eat this stuff?

311
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:17,185
This wasn't here.
There was nothing here.

312
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:21,185
There was a space and a building
with flames coming out of it.

313
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:25,185
There were creatures writhing around,
and they were growling and snarling.

314
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:28,187
And there were flames,
and I heard a voice say, ''Zuul.''

315
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:29,185
It was right here.

316
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,182
I'm sorry, I'm not getting any reading.

317
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:34,192
Well, are you sure
you're using that thing correctly?

318
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:38,192
I think so. But I'm sure
there are no animals in there.

319
00:25:38,192 --> 00:25:39,189
Well, that's great.

320
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:42,192
Either I have a monster in my kitchen,
or I'm completely crazy.

321
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:45,194
I don't think you're crazy.

322
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:50,190
Oh, good. That makes me
feel so much better.

323
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,185
Let me tell you something about me.

324
00:25:52,185 --> 00:25:55,188
I come home from work to my place,
and all I have is my work.

325
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:57,192
There's nothing else in my life.

326
00:25:57,192 --> 00:26:01,192
I meet you and say, ''There's someone
with the same problem I have.''

327
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:07,186
Yes, we both have
the same problem. You.

328
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:11,196
I'm gonna go for broke.

329
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:15,196
-I am madly in love with you.
-I don't believe this.

330
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:18,188
Wlll you please leave?

331
00:26:18,188 --> 00:26:21,191
And then she threw me out of her life.
She thought I was a creep.

332
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:24,193
She thought I was a geek,
and she probably wasn't the first.

333
00:26:24,193 --> 00:26:28,193
You are so odd.

334
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:32,193
-No.
-I've got it!

335
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:35,195
-No.
-I'll prove myself to you.

336
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,200
That's not necessary.

337
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,192
-Yeah, I'll solve your little problem.
-Okay.

338
00:26:40,192 --> 00:26:44,192
And then you'll say, ''Pete Venkman's
a guy who can get things done.

339
00:26:44,192 --> 00:26:46,197
-I wonder what makes him tick.''
-I wonder.

340
00:26:46,197 --> 00:26:49,199
''I wonder if he'd be interested
in knowing what makes me tick.''

341
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,195
I'll bet you're gonna be thinking
about me after I'm gone.

342
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:54,197
I bet I am.

343
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:58,197
No kiss?

344
00:27:06,196 --> 00:27:08,201
To our first customer.

345
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:12,201
To our first and only customer.

346
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:14,206
I'll need to draw some petty cash.

347
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:16,201
I should take her out to dinner.
We don't want to lose her.

348
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:22,204
This magnificent feast here
represents the last of the petty cash.

349
00:27:23,202 --> 00:27:27,202
Hey, slow down. Chew your food.

350
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:30,204
Hello, Ghostbusters.

351
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:35,202
Yes, of course they're serious.

352
00:27:35,202 --> 00:27:37,205
You do?

353
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:38,203
You have?

354
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:40,208
No kidding.

355
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:44,208
Well, just give me the address.

356
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:49,205
Yes, of course.
Oh, they'll be totally discreet.

357
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:52,207
Thank you.

358
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:56,207
We got one!

359
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:03,209
It's a call!

360
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:11,209
Come on!

361
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:46,219
Hey, anybody see a ghost?

362
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:51,216
-Thank you for coming so quickly.
-Jesus!

363
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:54,219
The guests are asking questions,
and I'm running out of excuses.

364
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,216
Has it happened before?

365
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:58,219
Well, most of the original staff
knows about the 12th floor.

366
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,214
-The disturbances, I mean.
-Yeah.

367
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:03,216
But it's been quiet for years
up until two weeks ago.

368
00:29:03,216 --> 00:29:05,221
It was never, ever this bad, though.

369
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:09,221
-Did you ever report it to anyone?
-No. Heavens, no.

370
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:12,223
The owners don't like us
to even talk about it.

371
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:13,220
I hope we could take care
of this quietly.

372
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,216
-It's done.
-Tonight.

373
00:29:15,216 --> 00:29:16,223
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

374
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:22,218
We handle this kind of thing
all the time.

375
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:31,224
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of a cosmonaut?

376
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:35,224
No, we're exterminators. Somebody
saw a cockroach up on 12th.

377
00:29:35,224 --> 00:29:41,219
-That's gotta be some cockroach.
-Bite your head off, man.

378
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:48,221
-Going up?
-I'll take the next one.

379
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:52,221
It just occurred to me we haven't had
a successful test of this equipment.

380
00:29:52,221 --> 00:29:54,224
-I blame myself.
-So do I.

381
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:58,224
-Well, no sense worrying about it now.
-Why worry?

382
00:29:58,224 --> 00:30:01,226
Each of us is wearing an unlicensed
nuclear accelerator on his back.

383
00:30:01,226 --> 00:30:07,222
Yep. Well, let's get ready.
Switch me on.

384
00:30:41,235 --> 00:30:45,235
What the hell are you doing?

385
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:47,230
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

386
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,230
We thought you were someone else.

387
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,234
Successful test.

388
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:55,230
I guess so.

389
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,232
-I think we'd better split up.
-Good idea.

390
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:04,236
Yeah, we can do
more damage that way.

391
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:31,236
Venkman? Venkman!

392
00:31:36,243 --> 00:31:39,236
Disgusting blob.

393
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:45,240
I'm gonna have to hold him myself.

394
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:25,248
Come in, Ray.

395
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:28,250
Venkman! I saw it! I saw it!

396
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,245
It's right here, Ray.

397
00:32:30,245 --> 00:32:31,252
It's looking at me.

398
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:34,245
He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?

399
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:35,252
I think he can hear you, Ray.

400
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:39,252
Don't move. It won't hurt you.

401
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:48,249
Venkman!

402
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:52,249
Venkman! Pete!

403
00:32:53,247 --> 00:32:55,251
Venkman, what happened?
Are you okay?

404
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:57,256
He slimed me.

405
00:32:57,256 --> 00:33:00,249
That's great! Actual physical contact!

406
00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:03,251
-Can you move?
-Ray. Ray! Come in, please!

407
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:04,249
I feel so funky.

408
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,251
Spengler! I'm with Venkman.

409
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,258
He got slimed!

410
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:10,252
That's great, Ray. Save some for me.

411
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:12,257
Get down here, right away!
It just went into a ballroom.

412
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:16,257
Okay, we'll be right there.

413
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:19,259
Sir, if you and your staff
could please wait out here...

414
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:25,254
...we'll take care of everything.

415
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:43,257
There it is. On the ceiling.

416
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:48,255
That's the one that got me.

417
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:56,264
All right, boys.

418
00:33:56,264 --> 00:33:56,264
Ready?

419
00:33:56,264 --> 00:34:00,264
Throw it!

420
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:09,261
I did that. I did that.

421
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:12,264
-That's my fault.
-It's okay. The table broke the fall.

422
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:15,266
There's something very important
I forgot to tell you.

423
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:18,259
-What?
-Don't cross the streams.

424
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:19,266
-Why?
-It would be bad.

425
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:23,266
I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing.
What do you mean, ''bad''?

426
00:34:23,266 --> 00:34:27,266
lmagine all life as you know it stopping
instantaneously and every molecule...

427
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:30,268
...in your body exploding
at the speed of light.

428
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,263
Total protonic reversal.

429
00:34:32,263 --> 00:34:36,263
Right, that's bad. Okay,
important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.

430
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:42,268
All right, Ray, take the left.
Egon, take the right.

431
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:49,270
Okay, Ray, just give me
one high and outside.

432
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,270
Ray!

433
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,268
Egon!

434
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:07,272
Okay, all right.
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

435
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,269
Nice shooting, Tex!

436
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:11,272
I assure you, there is no problem
with the room.

437
00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:13,267
It'll be ready as soon as your guests
are with us.

438
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:16,269
It took something out of him,
but he'll move.

439
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:19,271
I need some room to put the trap
down. Give me some room.

440
00:35:19,271 --> 00:35:23,271
You'll excuse me, please.

441
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:30,274
-Gotta get this in the clear.
-Wait, wait, wait!

442
00:35:30,274 --> 00:35:33,276
I've always wanted to do this.

443
00:35:33,276 --> 00:35:35,271
And....

444
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:38,273
-The flowers are still standing!
-Okay, on my go-signal.

445
00:35:38,273 --> 00:35:41,276
Spengler, I want a confinement stream
from you, okay? Go!

446
00:35:41,276 --> 00:35:44,278
Okay, hold him up there.
He's gonna move. Hold him up!

447
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:47,280
Go!

448
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,273
-It's working, Ray.
-Start bringing him down.

449
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,280
You got him. Don't cross the stream.

450
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Maybe now you'll never slime a guy
with a positron collider, huh?

451
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,282
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.

452
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:02,282
I'm opening the trap now.
Don't look directly into the trap.

453
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:04,277
I looked at the trap, Ray.

454
00:36:04,277 --> 00:36:09,284
Turn your streams off when I close
the trap. Get ready. I'm closing it.

455
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:13,283
Now!

456
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:32,285
It's in there.

457
00:36:33,282 --> 00:36:38,280
Well, that wasn't such a chore,
now, was it?

458
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,285
Mr. Smith, quickly.
I want that door open now!

459
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,289
Donald, stand over there.

460
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:45,282
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

461
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:46,289
Did you see it? What is it?

462
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,284
We got it.

463
00:36:48,284 --> 00:36:50,289
What is it?
Will there be any more of them?

464
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:53,281
What you had there
was what we refer to as a focused...

465
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:57,290
...non-terminal repeating phantasm,
or a class-five full-roaming vapor.

466
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,285
Real nasty one too.

467
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:01,290
And now...

468
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,288
...let's talk seriously.

469
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:06,288
For the entrapment, we're gonna have
to ask you for four big ones, $4000.

470
00:37:06,288 --> 00:37:09,290
But we are having a special this week
on proton charging...

471
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,285
...and storage of the beast.

472
00:37:11,285 --> 00:37:13,290
That's only gonna come to
1000 dollars, fortunately.

473
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,290
Five thousand dollars? I had no idea
it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

474
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,294
Well, that's all right.
We can just put it back.

475
00:37:19,294 --> 00:37:21,290
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

476
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:25,289
No! All right! Anything.

477
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:27,294
Thanks so much.

478
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:28,292
Thank you. Hope
we can help you again.

479
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:31,293
Coming through! One class-five
free-roaming vapor.

480
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:34,295
Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby.
Today, the entire Eastern seaboard...

481
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:37,288
...is alive with talk of incidents
of paranormal activity.

482
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:40,290
Alleged ghost-sightings
and supernatural occurrences...

483
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,293
...have been reported
across the entire tri-state area.

484
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:46,295
Everybody has heard ghost stories
around the campfire.

485
00:37:46,295 --> 00:37:49,297
My grandma used to spin yarns
about a spectral locomotive...

486
00:37:49,297 --> 00:37:52,290
...that would rocket past the farm
where she grew up.

487
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:58,294
But now, as if
some unforeseen authority....

488
00:38:13,296 --> 00:38:15,301
Stand aside, please!

489
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:17,296
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in
topic, ghosts and ghostbusting.

490
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:20,299
The controversy builds,
more sightings are reported.

491
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,296
Some maintain that these...

492
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:27,301
...professional paranormal eliminators
in New York are the cause of it all.

493
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:34,303
I got it! I got it!

494
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:38,303
Pete! Ray!

495
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:45,303
Still making headlines
all across the country...

496
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:49,303
...the Ghostbusters are at it again,
this time at the dance club...

497
00:38:49,303 --> 00:38:53,303
... The Rose. The boys in gray slugged
it out with a pesky poltergeist...

498
00:38:53,303 --> 00:38:57,303
...then stayed to dance with the ladies
who witnessed the disturbance.

499
00:38:57,303 --> 00:39:00,305
This is Casey Kasem.
Now on with the countdown.

500
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:03,307
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

501
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:06,309
No job is too big. No fee is too big.

502
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:09,302
Is it just a mist,
or does it have arms and legs?

503
00:39:09,302 --> 00:39:11,307
As they say in TV, I'm sure
there's one big question...

504
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:15,307
...on everybody's mind, and I imagine
you are the man to answer that.

505
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:21,311
How is Elvis,
and have you seen him lately?

506
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:03,314
Do you believe in UFOs,
astral projections...

507
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:05,319
...mental telepathy, ESP,
clairvoyance...

508
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,311
...spirit photography,
telekinetic movement...

509
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:13,318
...full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of Atlantis?

510
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:18,316
If there's a steady paycheck in it,
I'll believe anything you say.

511
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:21,318
I gotta get some sleep. I'm dying.

512
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,313
You don't look good.

513
00:40:23,313 --> 00:40:25,318
-I don't?
-Well, you've looked better.

514
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:26,315
You didn't used to look like this.

515
00:40:26,315 --> 00:40:29,318
Can you hold, please?

516
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:31,322
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn.
She paid with Visa.

517
00:40:31,322 --> 00:40:34,314
Here's tonight's worksheet.

518
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:35,321
Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.

519
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:38,314
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.

520
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:41,316
Beautiful. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

521
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:47,321
-Congratulations.
-Can you help me, please?

522
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:50,323
Welcome aboard.

523
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,326
I don't know where they get
these guest conductors.

524
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,318
It's not gonna do him much good
to scream at us in German.

525
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:59,321
Well, I don't think that the man
is competent to conduct...

526
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:01,325
...a major symphony orchestra.

527
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:07,320
-Could you wait here a minute?
-Sure.

528
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,322
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.

529
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:16,327
-That was a wonderful rehearsal.
-You heard that?

530
00:41:16,327 --> 00:41:18,321
Yes. You're the best one in your row.

531
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:20,326
Oh, thank you.

532
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:24,326
You're good. Most people can't hear
me with the whole orchestra playing.

533
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:25,324
I don't have to take this abuse.

534
00:41:25,324 --> 00:41:27,328
I got hundreds of people
dying to abuse me.

535
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:29,323
I know. You're a big celebrity now.

536
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:35,328
Do you have some information
for me on my case?

537
00:41:37,323 --> 00:41:39,328
Who's the stiff?

538
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,330
The ''stiff'' happens to be one of
the finest musicians in the world.

539
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,325
Do you have information
for me, please?

540
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:47,328
Well, sure, but I prefer
to give it to you in private.

541
00:41:47,328 --> 00:41:49,332
-Why don't you tell me now.
-Okay. I found the name Zuul for you.

542
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:55,327
The name Zuul refers to a demigod
worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the....

543
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,332
What's that word?

544
00:41:57,332 --> 00:41:59,327
-''Hittites.''
-Hittites...

545
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:03,327
...the Mesopotamians
and the Sumerians.

546
00:42:03,327 --> 00:42:06,329
""Zuul was the minion of Gozer.''

547
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:08,334
What's Gozer?

548
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:12,334
-Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
-Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

549
00:42:12,334 --> 00:42:15,336
I'm working on that. If we could
get together Thursday night...

550
00:42:15,336 --> 00:42:18,339
...I'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we could exchange information.

551
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:22,338
I can't see you Thursday. I'm busy.

552
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:25,330
Miss Barrett, you seem to think there
is something wrong up here that says:

553
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:30,337
''He enjoys taking his evenings off
and spending it with his clients.''

554
00:42:30,337 --> 00:42:33,338
No. I'm making a special exception
in your case...

555
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:35,334
...because...

556
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:36,331
...I respect you.

557
00:42:36,331 --> 00:42:37,338
It's corny, but I respect you
as an artist.

558
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:42,336
As a dresser too. This is a magnificent
coordination you have going today.

559
00:42:42,336 --> 00:42:44,341
-See you Thursday.
-I'll bring the Roylance Guide...

560
00:42:44,341 --> 00:42:48,340
...and we'll eat and read.

561
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,343
-So who the hell is that?
-He's just a friend.

562
00:42:55,343 --> 00:42:57,338
-A friend?
-An old friend.

563
00:42:57,338 --> 00:42:59,342
Bye! Well, I'll see you Thursday!

564
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:02,335
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

565
00:43:02,335 --> 00:43:05,337
You're still very pale, though.
A little sun.

566
00:43:05,337 --> 00:43:11,342
-Well, what does he do?
-He's a scientist.

567
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:23,342
This is where we store all the vapors
and entities and slimers that we trap.

568
00:43:23,342 --> 00:43:28,349
Very simple, really. A loaded trap
here. Open, unlock the system.

569
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:31,341
lnsert the trap.

570
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:34,344
Release.

571
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:37,346
Close, lock the system.
Set your entry grid.

572
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:39,341
Neutronize your field.

573
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:41,346
And...

574
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:44,348
...when the light is green,
the trap is clean.

575
00:43:44,348 --> 00:43:46,343
The ghost is incarcerated here
in our custom storage facility.

576
00:43:46,343 --> 00:43:50,342
There's a man from the EPA here
to see you. He's waiting in your office.

577
00:43:50,342 --> 00:43:53,344
-EPA? What's he want?
-I don't know.

578
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:56,347
All I do know is I've been working
two weeks without a break...

579
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:59,349
...and you promised me
you'd hire more help.

580
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:01,344
Janine, someone
with your qualifications...

581
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:05,354
...would have no trouble finding
a topflight job in either...

582
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:09,354
...the food service or
housekeeping industries.

583
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:13,353
-Are you gonna answer that?
-I've quit better jobs than this.

584
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:15,348
Ghostbusters! What do you want?

585
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:15,348
-Can I help you?
-I'm Walter Peck.

586
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:18,350
-Can I help you?
-I'm Walter Peck.

587
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:21,352
I represent the Environmental
Protection Agency, the third district.

588
00:44:21,352 --> 00:44:26,350
Great. How's it going down there?

589
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,352
Are you Peter Venkman?

590
00:44:29,352 --> 00:44:31,357
Yes, I'm...

591
00:44:31,357 --> 00:44:32,354
...Dr. Venkman.

592
00:44:32,354 --> 00:44:34,349
Exactly what are you a doctor of,
Mr. Venkman?

593
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:38,349
Well, I have Ph.D.'s in parapsychology
and psychology.

594
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:40,354
I see.

595
00:44:40,354 --> 00:44:43,356
And now you catch ghosts.

596
00:44:43,356 --> 00:44:46,359
Yeah. You could say that.

597
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:49,351
And how many ghosts have you
caught, Mr. Venkman?

598
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:52,354
-I'm not at liberty to say.
-And where do you put...

599
00:44:52,354 --> 00:44:55,356
...these ghosts
once you catch them?

600
00:44:55,356 --> 00:44:57,361
lnto a storage facility.

601
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,353
And would this storage facility
be located on these premises?

602
00:45:00,353 --> 00:45:05,359
-Yes.
-And may I see this storage facility?

603
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,359
-No.
-And why not, Mr. Venkman?

604
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,364
Because you did not use
the magic word.

605
00:45:15,364 --> 00:45:20,361
What is the magic word,
Mr. Venkman?

606
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:22,356
''Please.''

607
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:26,356
May I please see the storage facility,
Mr. Venkman?

608
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,363
Why do you want to see it?

609
00:45:27,363 --> 00:45:30,366
Well, because I'm curious.

610
00:45:30,366 --> 00:45:33,358
I want to know more about
what you do here.

611
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:35,363
There've been a lot of wild
stories in the media...

612
00:45:35,363 --> 00:45:38,365
...and we want to assess
any possible environmental impact...

613
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:40,361
...from your operation.

614
00:45:40,361 --> 00:45:42,365
For instance, the presence
of noxious...

615
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,368
...possibly hazardous waste chemicals
in your basement.

616
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:50,365
Now, you show me what is down there,
or I come back with a court order.

617
00:45:50,365 --> 00:45:55,362
You go get a court order, and I'll sue
your ass for wrongful prosecution!

618
00:45:55,362 --> 00:45:58,365
You can have it your way,
Mr. Venkman.

619
00:45:58,365 --> 00:46:01,367
I'm worried. It's crowded in there,
and my data...

620
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:04,369
...points to something big
on the horizon.

621
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:06,364
What do you mean ''big''?

622
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:10,363
Well, let's say this Twinkie
represents the normal amount...

623
00:46:10,363 --> 00:46:12,368
...of psychokinetic energy
in the New York area.

624
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:16,368
According to this morning's sample,
it would be a Twinkie...

625
00:46:16,368 --> 00:46:21,364
...35 feet long, weighing
approximately 600 pounds.

626
00:46:21,364 --> 00:46:23,369
That's a big Twinkie.

627
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:26,371
We could be on the verge
of a fourfold cross-rip...

628
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:30,371
...a PKE surge of incredible,
even dangerous, proportions.

629
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,366
We just had a visit from the
Environmental Protection Agency.

630
00:46:32,366 --> 00:46:35,369
-How's the grid holding up?
-Not good.

631
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:37,374
Tell him about the Twinkie.

632
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:41,373
What about the Twinkie?

633
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:35,376
-Oh, Dana, it's you.
-Hello, Louis.

634
00:47:35,376 --> 00:47:38,378
You gotta come in here.
You're missing a classic party.

635
00:47:38,378 --> 00:47:44,382
Yes, well, I would, Louis,
but I have a date coming over.

636
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:46,377
You made a date...

637
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:52,382
-...tonight?
-Well, I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.

638
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,379
Oh, that's okay.
You can bring him along.

639
00:47:57,379 --> 00:48:01,378
All right. Maybe we'll stop by, okay?

640
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,383
That's great. I'll tell everybody.

641
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:06,385
We're gonna play Twister,
we're gonna do some breakdancing....

642
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:07,383
Hey--

643
00:48:07,383 --> 00:48:13,388
Hey, let me in! It's Louis!
Somebody, let me in!

644
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:37,387
Hello?

645
00:48:37,387 --> 00:48:39,392
Hi, Mom.

646
00:48:39,392 --> 00:48:41,387
I've been busy.

647
00:48:41,387 --> 00:48:44,389
Well.... No, everything is fine.

648
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:47,391
Yeah. No, just that one time.

649
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,394
Oh, I am.

650
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,395
I will.

651
00:48:53,395 --> 00:48:57,395
I won't. Mom, I have to go.
I have a date.

652
00:48:57,395 --> 00:49:02,392
Yes. No, no one you know. It's....

653
00:49:02,392 --> 00:49:06,392
Well, he's a Ghostbuster.

654
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:09,394
Those guys on TV.

655
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:11,389
Yes, well, I'll have to let you know.

656
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:13,394
Okay. Love to Dad.

657
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:17,394
Right. Bye. Bye.

658
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:40,396
Oh, shit.

659
00:50:08,402 --> 00:50:08,402
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength Tylenol?

660
00:50:08,402 --> 00:50:11,405
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength Tylenol?

661
00:50:11,405 --> 00:50:15,405
Gee, I think all I got is
acetylsalicylic acid. Generic.

662
00:50:15,405 --> 00:50:19,404
I can get 600 tablets of that for the
same price as 300 of the name brand.

663
00:50:19,404 --> 00:50:21,400
Makes good financial sense.
Good advice.

664
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,402
Hey, this is real smoked salmon
from Nova Scotia, Canada...

665
00:50:24,402 --> 00:50:25,399
...24.95 a pound.

666
00:50:25,399 --> 00:50:28,402
It only cost me 1 4.1 2
after tax, though.

667
00:50:28,402 --> 00:50:29,409
I'm giving this as
a promotional expense.

668
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:33,409
That's why I invited clients instead
of friends. Having a good time, Marv?

669
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:35,404
How you doing? Have some Brie.
It's at room temperature.

670
00:50:35,404 --> 00:50:37,409
You think it's too warm for Brie?

671
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:40,411
Louis, I'm going home.

672
00:50:40,411 --> 00:50:43,404
Don't leave yet. Listen,
maybe if we start dancing...

673
00:50:43,404 --> 00:50:45,408
...other people will join in.

674
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:49,408
Okay.

675
00:50:49,408 --> 00:50:53,408
Oh, don't move.
I just gotta get the door.

676
00:50:53,408 --> 00:50:55,413
-Ted! Annette!
-Hi.

677
00:50:55,413 --> 00:50:57,408
I'm glad you could come.
Give me your coats.

678
00:50:57,408 --> 00:51:00,410
Everybody, this is Ted
and Annette Fleming.

679
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,408
How are you?

680
00:51:01,408 --> 00:51:04,410
Ted has a small carpet-cleaning
business in receivership.

681
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:08,410
Annette's drawing a salary from
a deferred bonus from two years ago.

682
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:12,410
They got 1 5,000 left
on the house at 8 percent.

683
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,415
So they're okay!

684
00:51:14,415 --> 00:51:19,412
Does anybody want
to play Parcheesi?

685
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:23,412
Okay, who brought the dog?

686
00:51:41,414 --> 00:51:47,419
Help! There's a bear loose
in my apartment! Help! Help!

687
00:51:49,414 --> 00:51:50,421
Help!

688
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:56,416
-What?
-A bear in his apartment.

689
00:51:58,421 --> 00:52:00,416
I'm gonna bring this up
at the tenants' meeting.

690
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:06,421
There's not supposed to be
any pets in the building.

691
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:24,425
Let me in. There's gotta be a way
in here. I gotta get--

692
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,420
Somebody, let me in!

693
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,427
Nice doggy.

694
00:52:35,427 --> 00:52:37,422
Cute little pooch.

695
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:41,421
Maybe I got a Milk-Bone.

696
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:01,430
-What happened?
-Some moron brought...

697
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:06,427
...a cougar to a party,
and it went berserk.

698
00:53:06,427 --> 00:53:12,432
Hi, I'm going up to Dana Barrett's.

699
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:31,433
Hello?

700
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,432
That's a different look for you,
isn't it?

701
00:53:35,432 --> 00:53:37,437
Are you the Keymaster?

702
00:53:37,437 --> 00:53:41,437
Not that I know of.

703
00:53:51,432 --> 00:53:54,434
Are you the Keymaster?

704
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:55,432
Yes.

705
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:59,431
I'm a friend of his.
He told me to meet him here.

706
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:01,435
-I didn't get your name.
-I am Zuul.

707
00:54:01,435 --> 00:54:05,435
I am the Gatekeeper.

708
00:54:09,435 --> 00:54:14,442
-What are we doing today, Zuul?
-Prepare for the coming of Gozer.

709
00:54:14,442 --> 00:54:17,435
Gozer, huh?

710
00:54:17,435 --> 00:54:21,435
The Destructor.

711
00:54:26,442 --> 00:54:30,442
Are we still going out?

712
00:54:30,442 --> 00:54:35,439
You know, you could pick up the place
if you're expecting someone.

713
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,441
Do you want this body?

714
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:42,441
ls this a trick question?

715
00:54:43,439 --> 00:54:46,441
I guess the roses worked, huh?

716
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:48,446
Take me now...

717
00:54:48,446 --> 00:54:49,443
...sub-creature.

718
00:54:49,443 --> 00:54:51,448
We never talk anymore.

719
00:54:51,448 --> 00:54:57,443
Easy. I make it a rule never to get
involved with possessed people.

720
00:54:59,448 --> 00:55:01,443
It's more of a guideline than a rule.

721
00:55:01,443 --> 00:55:02,450
You know, I can--

722
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:06,450
I want you inside me.

723
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,445
Go ahead. No, I can't.

724
00:55:08,445 --> 00:55:11,448
Sounds like you got at least
two people in there already.

725
00:55:11,448 --> 00:55:12,444
Might be a little crowded.

726
00:55:12,444 --> 00:55:14,449
Come on, why don't you
just quit trying...

727
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:18,449
...to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman
and just relax.

728
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:21,450
Lie down there. Relax.
Put your hands on your chest.

729
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:24,452
What I'd really like to do
is talk to Dana.

730
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:26,447
I want to talk to Dana.

731
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:28,452
Dana, it's Peter.

732
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:32,452
There is no Dana.
There is only Zuul.

733
00:55:32,452 --> 00:55:34,447
Oh, Zuulie, you nut. Come on.

734
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:36,452
Come on, I want to talk
to Dana. Dana.

735
00:55:36,452 --> 00:55:38,447
Just relax. Come on. Dana.

736
00:55:38,447 --> 00:55:40,452
Dana. Can I talk to Dana?

737
00:55:40,452 --> 00:55:44,452
There is no Dana, only Zuul.

738
00:55:44,452 --> 00:55:47,454
What a lovely singing voice
you must have.

739
00:55:47,454 --> 00:55:49,449
Now, I'm gonna count
to three, Zuulie.

740
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:52,451
And if I don't talk to Dana...

741
00:55:52,451 --> 00:55:55,454
...there's gonna be some real trouble
in this apartment, I think.

742
00:55:55,454 --> 00:55:59,454
One.

743
00:55:59,454 --> 00:56:01,458
Two.

744
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:05,458
Two and a half.

745
00:56:45,456 --> 00:56:48,458
Please come down.

746
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:48,458
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor is coming.

747
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:54,463
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor is coming.

748
00:56:54,463 --> 00:56:58,463
The Traveler. The Destroyer.

749
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,460
Gatekeeper.

750
00:57:09,465 --> 00:57:11,460
I am Vinz.

751
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,464
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

752
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:17,463
Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the
Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?

753
00:57:17,463 --> 00:57:23,468
He pulls the wagon, I make
the deals. You want a ride?

754
00:57:29,463 --> 00:57:33,463
Wait for the sign.
Then all prisoners will be released.

755
00:57:33,463 --> 00:57:36,465
You will perish in flame,
you and all your kind! Gatekeeper!

756
00:57:36,465 --> 00:57:40,465
What an asshole.

757
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:47,466
-Dropping off or picking up?
-Dropping off.

758
00:57:47,466 --> 00:57:51,466
Just a moment.

759
00:57:52,473 --> 00:57:54,468
-You a Ghostbuster?
-Yes.

760
00:57:54,468 --> 00:57:56,473
We picked up this guy.
We don't know what to do.

761
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,468
Bellevue doesn't want him.
I'm afraid to lock him up.

762
00:57:58,468 --> 00:58:01,471
I know you guys are into this
stuff, so I figured we'd check.

763
00:58:01,471 --> 00:58:05,470
All right.

764
00:58:06,468 --> 00:58:10,468
Are you the Gatekeeper?

765
00:58:11,475 --> 00:58:14,477
You better bring him inside.

766
00:58:14,477 --> 00:58:17,470
You are so kind to take
care of that man.

767
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:19,475
You know, you are
a real humanitarian.

768
00:58:19,475 --> 00:58:23,475
I don't think he's human.

769
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:31,474
What did you say your name was?

770
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:33,479
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

771
00:58:33,479 --> 00:58:36,481
According to this,
his name's Louis Tully.

772
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:40,481
Lives on Central Park West.

773
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:43,474
Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully?

774
00:58:43,474 --> 00:58:44,481
-Do I?
-Yes, have some.

775
00:58:44,481 --> 00:58:47,483
Yes, have some.

776
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:51,483
Vinz, you said before you
were waiting for a sign.

777
00:58:51,483 --> 00:58:53,478
-What sign are you waiting for?
-Gozer the Traveler.

778
00:58:53,478 --> 00:58:56,481
He will come in one
of the pre-chosen forms.

779
00:58:56,481 --> 00:59:01,477
During rectification of the Vuldronall,
the Traveler came as a large Torb.

780
00:59:01,477 --> 00:59:04,478
Then, during the third reconciliation
of the Meketrex supplicants...

781
00:59:04,478 --> 00:59:08,478
...they chose a new form for him,
that of a giant Sloar!

782
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:09,476
Many Shubs and Zuuls knew
what it was to be roasted...

783
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:12,478
...in the depths of the Sloar that day,
I can tell you.

784
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:16,478
-Egon.
-Excuse me.

785
00:59:18,483 --> 00:59:23,480
There's something very strange
about that man.

786
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,483
I'm usually very psychic,
and I have a terrible feeling...

787
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:30,482
...that something awful
is gonna happen to you.

788
00:59:30,482 --> 00:59:33,485
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

789
00:59:33,485 --> 00:59:37,485
I'll get it.

790
00:59:38,482 --> 00:59:40,487
-Hello?
-Egon, it's Peter.

791
00:59:40,487 --> 00:59:44,487
-Thanks, I've got it.
-I have news from the world of Gozer.

792
00:59:44,487 --> 00:59:47,489
-What is it, Peter?
-I'm here with Dana Barrett.

793
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:50,491
It seems the Goz has been
putting some moves...

794
00:59:50,491 --> 00:59:53,484
-...on my would-be girlfriend.
-How is she?

795
00:59:53,484 --> 00:59:56,486
I think we can get her
a guest shot on Wild Kingdom.

796
00:59:56,486 --> 00:59:59,489
I just whacked her up
with about 300 cc's of Thorazine.

797
00:59:59,489 --> 01:00:03,489
She's gonna take a little nap now,
but she says she's the Gatekeeper.

798
01:00:03,489 --> 01:00:06,491
-Does that make any sense to you?
-Some.

799
01:00:06,491 --> 01:00:08,486
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.

800
01:00:08,486 --> 01:00:14,491
Oh, wonderful. We have
to get these two together.

801
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:16,494
I think that would be
extraordinarily dangerous.

802
01:00:16,494 --> 01:00:19,487
Okay, well, hold onto him.
I'll be there in a little while.

803
01:00:19,487 --> 01:00:21,492
Good.

804
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:27,496
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find Ray.
I need him here immediately.

805
01:00:31,496 --> 01:00:34,489
Bad news, honey, I gotta go to work.

806
01:00:34,489 --> 01:00:40,494
Hey, will you stay here in bed
until I get back?

807
01:00:46,498 --> 01:00:50,498
-Hey, Ray, do you believe in God?
-Never met him.

808
01:00:50,498 --> 01:00:55,494
Yeah, well, I do. And I love
Jesus' style, you know?

809
01:00:55,494 --> 01:00:59,494
This roof cap is made of
a magnesium-tungsten alloy.

810
01:00:59,494 --> 01:01:01,499
What are you so involved
with there?

811
01:01:01,499 --> 01:01:05,499
These are blueprints for the ironwork
in Dana Barrett's apartment...

812
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:07,494
...and they're very, very strange.

813
01:01:07,494 --> 01:01:11,504
Hey, Ray, do you remember
something in the Bible about...

814
01:01:11,504 --> 01:01:15,503
...the last days, when the dead
would rise from the grave?

815
01:01:15,503 --> 01:01:18,496
I remember Revelations 7:1 2.

816
01:01:18,496 --> 01:01:21,498
And I looked as he opened
the sixth seal.

817
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:23,503
And behold, there was
a great earthquake.

818
01:01:23,503 --> 01:01:26,505
And the sun became
as black as sackcloth.

819
01:01:26,505 --> 01:01:27,503
And the moon became as blood.

820
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:31,503
And the seas boiled.
And the skies fell.

821
01:01:31,503 --> 01:01:34,504
-Judgment day.
-Judgment day.

822
01:01:34,504 --> 01:01:37,506
Every ancient religion has its myth
about the end of the world.

823
01:01:37,506 --> 01:01:41,506
Myth? Ray, has it ever
occurred to you...

824
01:01:41,506 --> 01:01:43,501
...maybe the reason
we've been so busy...

825
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:49,506
...is because the dead have
been rising from the grave?

826
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:58,503
-How about a little music?
-Yeah.

827
01:02:33,514 --> 01:02:37,514
This way.

828
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:47,518
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Just where do you think you're going?

829
01:02:47,518 --> 01:02:50,509
Step aside, or you'll be arrested
for interfering with the police.

830
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:53,512
Oh, no. Hold on. I've seen TV.
You can't come in here...

831
01:02:53,512 --> 01:02:55,516
...without a warrant or a writ.

832
01:02:55,516 --> 01:02:58,519
Cease and Desist All Commerce
order. Seizure of Premises.

833
01:02:58,519 --> 01:03:01,511
Ban of Public Utilities
for Non-Licensed Waste Handlers...

834
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,514
...and a federal
Entry and inspection order.

835
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,518
Vinz, there's one more test
I'd like to perform.

836
01:03:06,518 --> 01:03:10,518
Egon. I tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.

837
01:03:10,518 --> 01:03:14,518
-Excuse me, this is private property.
-Shut this off. Shut these all off.

838
01:03:14,518 --> 01:03:17,520
I'm warning you. Turning off these
machines is hazardous.

839
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,513
I'll tell you hazardous.
You're facing prosecution...

840
01:03:20,513 --> 01:03:22,518
...for a half-a-dozen
environmental violations.

841
01:03:22,518 --> 01:03:28,522
You shut off these beams,
or we shut them off for you.

842
01:03:28,522 --> 01:03:31,515
Understand, this is a high-voltage
laser containment system.

843
01:03:31,515 --> 01:03:34,517
Simply turning it off would be
like dropping a bomb in the city.

844
01:03:34,517 --> 01:03:38,517
Don't patronize me. I'm not stupid,
like the people you bilk.

845
01:03:38,517 --> 01:03:41,520
At ease, officer. I'm Peter Venkman.
There's been a misunderstanding...

846
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,522
...and I want to cooperate
in any way I can.

847
01:03:44,522 --> 01:03:46,527
Forget it. You had your chance
to cooperate...

848
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:50,527
...but you thought it'd be more fun to
insult me. Now it is my turn, wise-ass.

849
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,524
He wants to shut down
the protection grid.

850
01:03:51,524 --> 01:03:54,526
You shut that thing down,
we won't be held responsible--

851
01:03:54,526 --> 01:03:58,526
-You'll be responsible. Shut it off.
-No, we won't be held responsible.

852
01:03:58,526 --> 01:04:02,526
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.

853
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:05,527
I've never seen anything like this.
I don't know--

854
01:04:05,527 --> 01:04:10,525
Yeah, I'm not interested in
your opinion. Just shut it off.

855
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:12,530
My friend, don't be a jerk.

856
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:15,522
-Step aside.
-lf he does that again, you shoot him.

857
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:16,529
You do your job.
Don't tell me how to do mine.

858
01:04:16,529 --> 01:04:22,524
-Thank you, officer.
-Shut it off!

859
01:04:41,525 --> 01:04:45,525
Oh, shit.

860
01:04:57,534 --> 01:05:01,534
Clear the building!

861
01:05:27,537 --> 01:05:30,539
This is it. This is the sign.

862
01:05:30,539 --> 01:05:36,534
Yeah, it's a sign, all right.
We're going out of business.

863
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:46,539
Hey, aim up there.

864
01:05:46,539 --> 01:05:48,544
-What happened?
-Storage facility blew.

865
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,539
-He shut off the protection grid.
-Oh, great.

866
01:05:50,539 --> 01:05:52,544
-That's bad, isn't it?
-Yeah.

867
01:05:52,544 --> 01:05:55,536
-Where's the Keymaster?
-Shit.

868
01:05:55,536 --> 01:05:58,539
-Who's the Keymaster?
-Oh, come on.

869
01:05:58,539 --> 01:06:00,543
Hold it. I want this man arrested.

870
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:04,543
These men are in criminal violation
of the Environmental Protection Act.

871
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:07,545
-This explosion is a direct result of it.
-Your mother!

872
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:13,540
Come on, hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

873
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:58,554
Columbia Building, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry, so let's not dawdle.

874
01:07:49,555 --> 01:07:51,559
Hey, guard!

875
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:54,561
Look, I want to make a phone call.

876
01:07:54,561 --> 01:07:56,556
I just work with these guys.
I wasn't even there.

877
01:07:56,556 --> 01:08:00,556
The structure of this roof cap
is like the telemetry tracker...

878
01:08:00,556 --> 01:08:04,555
...that NASA uses to identify
dead pulsars in deep space.

879
01:08:04,555 --> 01:08:10,560
Cold-riveted girders
with cores of pure selenium.

880
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,558
Everybody getting this so far?

881
01:08:11,558 --> 01:08:15,557
So what? I guess they just don't
make them like they used to.

882
01:08:15,557 --> 01:08:17,561
No. Nobody ever made
them like this.

883
01:08:17,561 --> 01:08:22,559
The architect was either a certified
genius or an authentic wacko.

884
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:25,561
Ray, for a moment...

885
01:08:25,561 --> 01:08:29,561
...pretend that I don't know
anything about metallurgy...

886
01:08:29,561 --> 01:08:34,568
...engineering or physics and just
tell me what the hell is going on.

887
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:36,563
You never studied.

888
01:08:36,563 --> 01:08:40,563
The whole building is a huge
superconductive antenna...

889
01:08:40,563 --> 01:08:42,568
...that was designed and
built for the purpose...

890
01:08:42,568 --> 01:08:46,567
...of pulling in and concentrating
spiritual turbulence.

891
01:08:46,567 --> 01:08:52,562
Your girlfriend lives in the
corner penthouse of spook central.

892
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:56,572
She's not my girlfriend.

893
01:08:56,572 --> 01:08:58,567
I find her interesting because she's
a client and sleeps above her covers.

894
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:02,567
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drools. She claws.

895
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:05,569
It's not the girl, Peter,
it's the building.

896
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:09,568
Something terrible is about to enter
our world. This building is the door.

897
01:09:09,568 --> 01:09:11,573
The architect's name
was Ivo Shandor.

898
01:09:11,573 --> 01:09:15,573
I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide.
He was also a doctor.

899
01:09:15,573 --> 01:09:18,565
He performed a lot
of unnecessary surgery.

900
01:09:18,565 --> 01:09:21,568
And then, in 1920,
he started a secret society.

901
01:09:21,568 --> 01:09:25,568
-Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
-Right.

902
01:09:25,568 --> 01:09:26,575
No studying.

903
01:09:26,575 --> 01:09:32,570
After World War I, Shandor decided
that society was too sick to survive.

904
01:09:35,572 --> 01:09:39,572
He wasn't alone. He had close
to a thousand followers when he died.

905
01:09:39,572 --> 01:09:44,579
They conducted rituals
up on the roof...01:12:38:...bizarre rituals intended to bring
about the end of the world.

906
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:50,574
And now it looks like
it may actually happen.

907
01:09:53,576 --> 01:09:56,579
We have to get out of here
and find a judge or something.

908
01:09:56,579 --> 01:10:00,578
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey. Hold it.

909
01:10:00,578 --> 01:10:02,574
Are we going to go
before a judge to say...

910
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:06,573
...that a Babylonian god is
gonna drop in on Central Park West...

911
01:10:06,573 --> 01:10:09,575
-...and start tearing up the city?
-Sumerian, not Babylonian.

912
01:10:09,575 --> 01:10:11,579
-Yeah, big difference.
-No offense...

913
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:12,577
...but I gotta get my own lawyer.

914
01:10:12,577 --> 01:10:15,579
Okay, Ghostbusters.
The mayor wants to see you guys.

915
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,574
The whole island's going crazy.
Let's go.

916
01:10:17,574 --> 01:10:23,579
I gotta split. The mayor wants to
rap with me about some things.

917
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:49,582
-I am the Keymaster.
-I am the Gatekeeper.

918
01:11:26,588 --> 01:11:32,593
-Back. Back. Stay back.
-Stay back. Stay back.

919
01:11:38,588 --> 01:11:39,595
I've got a city blowing up,
and you aren't giving me answers.

920
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:42,586
I've got a city blowing up,
and you aren't giving me answers.

921
01:11:42,586 --> 01:11:44,591
We're blocking the bridges,
the roads--

922
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:46,596
The Ghostbusters are here.

923
01:11:46,596 --> 01:11:48,591
The Ghostbusters.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.

924
01:11:48,591 --> 01:11:50,596
Hey, and where's this Peck?

925
01:11:50,596 --> 01:11:54,596
Peck. I am Walter Peck, sir, and
I am prepared to make a full report.

926
01:11:54,596 --> 01:11:57,598
These men are consummate
snowball artists.

927
01:11:57,598 --> 01:12:00,590
They use sense and nerve gases
to induce hallucinations.

928
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:03,592
People think they're seeing ghosts,
and they call these bozos...

929
01:12:03,592 --> 01:12:06,594
...who show up to deal
with the problem...

930
01:12:06,594 --> 01:12:07,592
...with a fake electronic light show.

931
01:12:07,592 --> 01:12:10,594
Everything was fine with our system
until the power grid...

932
01:12:10,594 --> 01:12:14,594
-...was shut off by dickless here.
-They caused an explosion.

933
01:12:14,594 --> 01:12:20,599
-ls this true?
-Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

934
01:12:21,596 --> 01:12:25,596
Hey, come on. Knock it off.
Hey, break it up!

935
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:27,601
-All right.
-Well, that's what I heard.

936
01:12:27,601 --> 01:12:28,598
This is City Hall.

937
01:12:28,598 --> 01:12:31,601
Now, what am I gonna do here, John?
What is this?

938
01:12:31,601 --> 01:12:33,596
All I know is that was no light show
we saw this morning.

939
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:38,603
I've seen every form
of combustion known to man...

940
01:12:38,603 --> 01:12:40,598
...but this beats the hell out of me.

941
01:12:40,598 --> 01:12:42,603
The walls in the 53rd Precinct
were bleeding.

942
01:12:42,603 --> 01:12:45,605
-How do you explain that?
-Good afternoon, gentlemen.

943
01:12:45,605 --> 01:12:49,605
Oh, Your Eminence.

944
01:12:52,598 --> 01:12:54,602
-How are you, Lenny?
-You're looking good, Mike.

945
01:12:54,602 --> 01:12:58,601
We're in a real fix here.
What do you think I should do?

946
01:12:58,601 --> 01:13:01,604
Officially, the church
will not take any position...

947
01:13:01,604 --> 01:13:05,603
...on the religious implications
of these phenomena.

948
01:13:05,603 --> 01:13:07,608
Personally, Lenny...

949
01:13:07,608 --> 01:13:11,608
...I think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.

950
01:13:11,608 --> 01:13:12,606
That's a smart move, Mike.

951
01:13:12,606 --> 01:13:14,601
I won't call a press conference...

952
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:18,601
...and tell everyone to start praying.

953
01:13:18,601 --> 01:13:21,603
I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor.

954
01:13:21,603 --> 01:13:24,605
I've only been with the company
for a couple weeks.

955
01:13:24,605 --> 01:13:27,607
But I gotta tell you,
these things are real.

956
01:13:27,607 --> 01:13:31,607
Since I joined these men,
I have seen shit that'll turn you white.

957
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,612
Well, you can believe Mr. Pecker.

958
01:13:33,612 --> 01:13:36,605
-My name is Peck.
-Or you could accept the fact...

959
01:13:36,605 --> 01:13:39,607
...that this city is headed for
a disaster of biblical proportions.

960
01:13:39,607 --> 01:13:42,609
-Well, what do you mean, ''biblical''?
-What he means is Old Testament.

961
01:13:42,609 --> 01:13:45,612
-Real wrath-of-God-type stuff.
-Exactly.

962
01:13:45,612 --> 01:13:48,614
Fire and brimstone down from
the skies. Rivers and seas boiling.

963
01:13:48,614 --> 01:13:51,606
Forty years of darkness.
Earthquakes. Volcanoes.

964
01:13:51,606 --> 01:13:52,613
The dead rising from the grave.

965
01:13:52,613 --> 01:13:56,613
Human sacrifice. Dogs and cats
living together. Mass hysteria.

966
01:13:56,613 --> 01:14:00,613
Enough! I get the point.

967
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:02,608
But what if you're wrong?

968
01:14:02,608 --> 01:14:05,610
lf I'm wrong, nothing happens.
We go to jail, peacefully, quietly.

969
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:08,612
We'll enjoy it. But if I'm right...

970
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:12,611
...and we can stop this thing....

971
01:14:12,611 --> 01:14:17,609
Lenny, you will have
saved the lives...

972
01:14:17,609 --> 01:14:23,613
...of millions of registered voters.

973
01:14:27,613 --> 01:14:33,618
I don't believe you're seriously
considering listening to these men.

974
01:14:37,618 --> 01:14:40,620
Get him out of here.

975
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:43,622
-Bye.
-I'll fix you. I'm gonna fix you.

976
01:14:43,622 --> 01:14:46,615
I'll get you a nice fruit basket.
I'm going to miss him.

977
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:47,622
All right. All right.

978
01:14:47,622 --> 01:14:53,617
We got work to do. Now,
what do you need from me?

979
01:15:04,619 --> 01:15:10,624
Come on, let's run some red lights!

980
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:10,629
Hello, New York.

981
01:16:14,629 --> 01:16:17,631
Hello, everybody!

982
01:16:17,631 --> 01:16:20,634
Dr. Ray Stantz, would you please?
The heart of the Ghostbusters.

983
01:16:20,634 --> 01:16:24,634
Thank you. They love you.
They love you here.

984
01:16:24,634 --> 01:16:30,638
-I like that shirt, friend.
-Ghostbusters! All right!

985
01:16:30,638 --> 01:16:33,631
Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost.

986
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:39,636
Okay, whatever happens,
let's be professional.

987
01:17:07,643 --> 01:17:13,638
We might have to put a little
overtime in on this one.

988
01:18:02,642 --> 01:18:08,646
There they are. There they are.

989
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:15,649
I was in no way prepared for that.

990
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,651
It's all right. Don't worry.
We're fine. We can handle it.

991
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:21,653
We can take it.
They want to play rough.

992
01:18:21,653 --> 01:18:26,651
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters!

993
01:18:26,651 --> 01:18:28,646
-Wanna play rough?
-Yeah.

994
01:18:28,646 --> 01:18:32,655
Let's do it.

995
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:56,654
Where are we?

996
01:18:56,654 --> 01:19:00,654
It looks like we're
in the teens somewhere.

997
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:06,659
Well, when we get to 20, tell me.
I'm gonna throw up.

998
01:19:35,663 --> 01:19:39,663
-Twenty-two. Is this it?
-Yep.

999
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,665
Art deco. Very nice.

1000
01:19:50,665 --> 01:19:56,660
-Where is it?
-It's at the end of the hall.

1001
01:20:32,668 --> 01:20:36,667
Hey, where do these stairs go?

1002
01:20:37,665 --> 01:20:41,674
They go up.

1003
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:46,672
Okay, go ahead. Come on.
Go ahead.

1004
01:20:46,672 --> 01:20:50,672
Watch it. Go ahead.

1005
01:21:26,679 --> 01:21:30,679
Dana.

1006
01:21:41,681 --> 01:21:45,681
Okay, so she's a dog.

1007
01:22:22,686 --> 01:22:26,686
It's a girl.

1008
01:22:29,688 --> 01:22:32,690
-It's Gozer.
-I thought Gozer was a man.

1009
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:36,690
-It's whatever it wants to be.
-Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.

1010
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:38,685
Right.

1011
01:22:38,685 --> 01:22:42,685
Go get her, Ray!

1012
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:56,690
Gozer the Gozerian?

1013
01:22:56,690 --> 01:23:02,694
Good evening. As a duly designated
representative of the city...

1014
01:23:02,694 --> 01:23:03,692
...county and state of New York...

1015
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:06,692
...I order you to cease
all supernatural activity...

1016
01:23:06,692 --> 01:23:07,690
...and return to your place of origin...

1017
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:10,692
...or to the nearest convenient
parallel dimension.

1018
01:23:10,692 --> 01:23:13,694
That ought to do it.
Thanks very much, Ray.

1019
01:23:13,694 --> 01:23:17,694
Are you a god?

1020
01:23:22,692 --> 01:23:26,691
-No.
-Then die!

1021
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:56,695
Ray, when someone asks you
if you're a god, you say, ""Yes.''

1022
01:23:56,695 --> 01:24:02,700
All right. This chick is toast.

1023
01:24:13,702 --> 01:24:17,702
-Got your stick?
-Holding it.

1024
01:24:17,702 --> 01:24:18,699
Heat them up!

1025
01:24:18,699 --> 01:24:20,703
Smoking!

1026
01:24:20,703 --> 01:24:23,705
-Make them hard.
-Ready!

1027
01:24:23,705 --> 01:24:29,700
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

1028
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:33,700
Throw it!

1029
01:24:40,702 --> 01:24:43,705
-Nimble little minx, isn't she?
-We better go full stream.

1030
01:24:43,705 --> 01:24:47,705
Aim for the flattop.

1031
01:24:55,703 --> 01:24:59,703
Wasn't so hard.

1032
01:25:03,703 --> 01:25:05,708
We neutronized it.

1033
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:06,705
You know what that means?
A complete particle reversal.

1034
01:25:06,705 --> 01:25:09,708
And we had the tools.
We had the talent.

1035
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:12,710
It's Miller time.

1036
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:17,707
-Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad.
-Oh, no.

1037
01:25:17,707 --> 01:25:21,707
What?

1038
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:32,709
Look out!

1039
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:56,717
Sub-creatures. Gozer the Gozerian,
Gozer the Destructor...

1040
01:25:56,717 --> 01:26:01,715
...Volguus Zildrohar
the Traveler has come.

1041
01:26:01,715 --> 01:26:04,717
Choose and perish.

1042
01:26:04,717 --> 01:26:08,717
What do you mean, 'choose'?
We don't understand.

1043
01:26:08,717 --> 01:26:14,721
Choose. Choose the form
of the Destructor.

1044
01:26:14,721 --> 01:26:18,721
Oh, I get it. I get it. Oh, very cute.

1045
01:26:18,721 --> 01:26:21,724
Whatever we think of.
If we think of J. Edgar Hoover...

1046
01:26:21,724 --> 01:26:24,716
...J. Edgar Hoover will appear and
destroy us, so empty your heads.

1047
01:26:24,716 --> 01:26:27,719
Don't think of anything.
We've only got one shot at this.

1048
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:31,718
The choice is made.

1049
01:26:31,718 --> 01:26:34,721
The Traveler has come.

1050
01:26:34,721 --> 01:26:36,725
Nobody choosed anything.

1051
01:26:36,725 --> 01:26:38,721
-Did you choose anything?
-No.

1052
01:26:38,721 --> 01:26:39,728
-Did you?
-My mind is blank.

1053
01:26:39,728 --> 01:26:43,728
I didn't choose anything!

1054
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,720
I couldn't help it.

1055
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,723
It just popped in there.

1056
01:26:56,723 --> 01:27:00,723
What? What just popped in there?

1057
01:27:00,723 --> 01:27:05,730
-I tried to think--
-Look!01:30:45:-No! It can't be.
-What is it?

1058
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:07,725
-It can't be.
-What did you do, Ray?

1059
01:27:07,725 --> 01:27:11,725
Oh, shit.

1060
01:27:20,732 --> 01:27:26,727
It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1061
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:54,735
There's something
you don't see every day.

1062
01:27:54,735 --> 01:27:56,730
I tried to think of a harmless thing.

1063
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,735
Something I loved
from my childhood.

1064
01:27:58,735 --> 01:28:03,733
Something that could never, ever
possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

1065
01:28:03,733 --> 01:28:06,735
Nice thinking, Ray.

1066
01:28:06,735 --> 01:28:08,739
We used to roast
Stay Puft marshmallows...

1067
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:12,739
...by the fire at Camp Wauconda.

1068
01:28:12,739 --> 01:28:15,741
Ray, has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got left?

1069
01:28:15,741 --> 01:28:21,736
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rational thought.

1070
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:35,740
-Oh, no.
-Mother pus bucket.

1071
01:28:38,741 --> 01:28:40,737
Nobody steps on a church
in my town.

1072
01:28:40,737 --> 01:28:44,736
One, two, three, roast him.

1073
01:29:02,741 --> 01:29:04,745
Funny, us going out like this.

1074
01:29:04,745 --> 01:29:06,741
Kllled by a 1 00-foot
marshmallow man.

1075
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:10,740
We've been going about this wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is a sailor.

1076
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:16,745
He's in New York. We get this
guy laid, we won't have any trouble.

1077
01:29:17,743 --> 01:29:20,745
I have a radical idea.
The door swings both ways.

1078
01:29:20,745 --> 01:29:23,747
We could reverse the particle flow
through the gate.

1079
01:29:23,747 --> 01:29:25,741
How?

1080
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:27,746
-We'll cross the streams.
-Excuse me, Egon.

1081
01:29:27,746 --> 01:29:28,744
You said crossing the streams
was bad.

1082
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:32,743
-Cross the streams.
-You're gonna endanger us.

1083
01:29:32,743 --> 01:29:34,748
You're gonna endanger our client...

1084
01:29:34,748 --> 01:29:37,751
...the nice lady who paid us in
advance before she became a dog.

1085
01:29:37,751 --> 01:29:43,746
Not necessarily. There's definitely
a very slim chance we'll survive.

1086
01:29:47,745 --> 01:29:50,748
I love this plan. I'm excited
to be a part of it. Let's do it.

1087
01:29:50,748 --> 01:29:56,752
This job is definitely not
worth 11,500 a year.

1088
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,752
Hurry.

1089
01:30:00,752 --> 01:30:05,750
See you on the other side, Ray.

1090
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:11,754
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.

1091
01:30:15,754 --> 01:30:19,754
Let's turn them on, Spengler!

1092
01:30:20,752 --> 01:30:24,751
Now, Spengler!

1093
01:30:27,754 --> 01:30:31,753
Get out of here!

1094
01:31:21,764 --> 01:31:23,759
Winston.

1095
01:31:23,759 --> 01:31:27,769
Are you all right?

1096
01:31:29,764 --> 01:31:31,769
Venkman?

1097
01:31:31,769 --> 01:31:33,764
Spengler!

1098
01:31:33,764 --> 01:31:37,764
Venkman!

1099
01:31:38,771 --> 01:31:41,764
Spengler.

1100
01:31:41,764 --> 01:31:44,766
Oh, Spengler. Oh, are you okay?

1101
01:31:44,766 --> 01:31:46,771
I feel like the floor of a taxicab.

1102
01:31:46,771 --> 01:31:47,768
-Venky!
-Yeah, where are you?

1103
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:51,768
Oh, thank God.

1104
01:31:51,768 --> 01:31:53,773
-You okay?
-I'm all right.

1105
01:31:53,773 --> 01:31:54,770
-You all right?
-I'm all right.

1106
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:57,772
-You all right?
-Yeah. You okay?

1107
01:31:57,772 --> 01:32:01,772
Fine.

1108
01:32:07,767 --> 01:32:10,769
It smells like barbecued dog hair.

1109
01:32:10,769 --> 01:32:11,766
Oh, Venkman.

1110
01:32:11,766 --> 01:32:14,769
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1111
01:32:14,769 --> 01:32:20,772
I'm sorry. I just-- I just forgot.

1112
01:32:31,774 --> 01:32:35,774
Look!

1113
01:32:58,776 --> 01:33:01,778
Somebody turn on the lights!

1114
01:33:01,778 --> 01:33:07,783
-Help! Somebody!
-Go check on that little guy.

1115
01:33:10,776 --> 01:33:14,784
What happened?

1116
01:33:21,777 --> 01:33:23,781
Where am I?

1117
01:33:23,781 --> 01:33:27,781
Oh, hi.

1118
01:33:27,781 --> 01:33:29,786
You'll be all right.

1119
01:33:29,786 --> 01:33:34,783
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

1120
01:33:34,783 --> 01:33:37,786
Are you okay?

1121
01:33:37,786 --> 01:33:39,781
Who are you guys?

1122
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:43,781
We're the Ghostbusters.

1123
01:33:44,788 --> 01:33:45,785
Who does your taxes?

1124
01:33:45,785 --> 01:33:48,788
You know, Mr. Tully,
you are a most fortunate individual.

1125
01:33:48,788 --> 01:33:51,790
-I know.
-You have been a participant in...

1126
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:55,790
...the biggest interdimensional cross
rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909.

1127
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:57,785
-Felt great.
-We'd like to get a sample...

1128
01:33:57,785 --> 01:34:03,790
-...of your brain tissue.
-Okay.

1129
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:07,789
I love this town!

1130
01:34:47,796 --> 01:34:51,796
Egon!

1131
01:34:56,793 --> 01:34:58,798
What's going on?

1132
01:34:58,798 --> 01:35:01,800
Does anybody want to interview me?

1133
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,800
I'm an eyewitness. I was up there.

1134
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,793
I want to go with them in the car.
