5
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:45,173
All right. I'm gonna turn
over the next card.

6
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,832
I want you to concentrate.

7
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:50,687
I want you to tell me
what you think it is.

8
00:02:55,864 --> 00:02:57,281
Square.

9
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,568
Good guess. But wrong.

10
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:10,400
Clear your head.

11
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:15,565
All right. Tell me
what you think it is.

12
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,407
Is it a star?

13
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:23,041
It is a star. Very good.
That's great.

14
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:25,840
Okay. All right.

15
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:29,845
Think hard. What is it?

16
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:32,400
Circle.

17
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:36,324
Close. But definitely wrong.

18
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,968
Okay.

19
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,724
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

20
00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:45,201
All right.

21
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:48,404
What is it?

22
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:51,968
Come on.

23
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:54,968
Figure eight.

24
00:03:57,225 --> 00:04:00,965
Incredible. That's 5 for 5.
You can't see these, can you?

25
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:04,929
- You're not cheating me, are you?
- No, I swear they're just coming to me.

26
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:07,128
Okay.

27
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:12,521
- Nervous?
- Yes. I don't like this.

28
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:17,722
You only have 75 more to
go, okay? What's this one?

29
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a couple of wavy lines.

30
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:26,804
- Sorry. This isn't your lucky day.
- I know.

31
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,207
Wait... Um...

32
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,447
I'm getting a little tired of this!

33
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:39,000
You volunteered, didn't you?
We're paying you, aren't we?

34
00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:42,280
Yeah, but I didn't know you were
gonna be giving me electric shocks!

35
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:44,405
What are you trying to
prove here, anyway?

36
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:48,368
I'm studying the effect of negative
reinforcement on ESP ability.

37
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:51,848
The effect? I'll tell you what the
effect is. It's pissing me off!

38
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:53,768
Well, then maybe my
theory is correct!

39
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:57,565
- You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it.
- I will, mister!

40
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,968
You may as well get used to that.

41
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:08,685
It's the kind of resentment that your
ability is going to provoke in some people.

42
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:11,968
Do you think I have it,
Dr. Venkman?

43
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:15,608
You're no fluke, Jennifer.

44
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:18,128
This is it. This is definitely it!

45
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,560
Did those UV lenses come
in for the video camera?

46
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:24,124
And that blank tape, I need it,
the one you erased yesterday.

47
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:27,280
- Will you excuse me for a second?
- Sure.

48
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:31,768
I'm right in the middle
of something, Ray.

49
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,570
I need a little more
time with this subject.

50
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,081
Could you come back in an
hour, hour and a half?

51
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:38,160
Peter, at 1:40 p.m.

52
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:41,605
at the main branch of The New York
Public Library on Fifth Avenue,

53
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:46,289
ten people witnessed a free-floating,
full-torso, vaporous apparition.

54
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:48,524
It blew books off shelves
from 20 feet away

55
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:50,961
and scared the socks off
some poor librarian.

56
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:53,248
I'm very excited. I'm very pleased.

57
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:57,164
I want you to get right down there,
check it out, and get back to me.

58
00:05:57,225 --> 00:06:00,048
No, Peter, you're coming with us on
this one. Spengler went down there.

59
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:03,125
He took PKE valences, went right
off the top of the scale.

60
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:07,448
Buried the needle. We're close
on this one. I can feel it.

61
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:13,769
I can feel it. We're
very, very close.

62
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:18,761
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd
like to work with you some more.

63
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:21,004
Perhaps you could come back
this evening, say at...?

64
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:22,481
Eight o'clock?

65
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:27,321
I was just going to say, "8:00"?
You are a legitimate phenomenon.

66
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:31,528
As a friend, I have to tell you,

67
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:34,295
you've finally gone around the
bend on this ghost business.

68
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:35,838
You guys have been
running your ass off,

69
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,911
meeting and greeting every
schizo in the five boroughs

70
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:40,985
who says he has a paranormal
experience. What have you seen?

71
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:42,216
Of course, you forget, Peter,

72
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:45,624
I was present at an undersea,
unexplained mass sponge migration.

73
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:50,721
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated
about a foot and a half.

74
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:58,320
- Oh, you're here.
- Yeah, what have you got?

75
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,569
This is big, Peter, this is very big.
There's definitely something here.

76
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:05,321
Egon, this reminds me of the time you
tried to drill a hole through your head.

77
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:07,445
- Remember that?
- That would've worked if...

78
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:10,404
I'm Roger Delacorte. Are you
the men from the university?

79
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:14,008
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Stantz. Egon.

80
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:18,001
Thank you for coming. I hope we can
clear this up quickly and quietly.

81
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:22,328
Let's not rush things. We don't
even know what you have yet.

82
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:24,725
I don't remember seeing any legs,

83
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:27,924
but it definitely had arms,
because it reached out for me.

84
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:30,121
Arms? I can't wait to get
a look at this thing.

85
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:32,965
Alice, I'm gonna ask you a couple
of standard questions, okay?

86
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:35,360
Have you or any
member of your family

87
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:39,449
ever been diagnosed schizophrenic,
mentally incompetent?

88
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:43,208
My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

89
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:47,004
I'd call that a big yes.

90
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:51,285
Uh, are you habitually using
drugs, stimulants, alcohol?

91
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:54,604
- No.
- No, no. Just asking.

92
00:07:54,864 --> 00:07:58,125
Are you, Alice,
menstruating right now?

93
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:03,245
- What has that got to do with it?
- Back off, man. I'm a scientist.

94
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:06,404
Ray, it's moving. Come on.

95
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,804
Look!

96
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:40,889
- This is hot, Ray.
- Symmetrical book-stacking.

97
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:44,804
Just like the Philadelphia
mass turbulence of 1947.

98
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:49,041
You're right. No human being
would stack books like this.

99
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:52,968
Listen! Do you smell something?

100
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:04,084
Talk about telekinetic
activity. Look at this mess.

101
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:07,164
Raymond, look at this.

102
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:09,768
Ectoplasmic residue.

103
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:13,848
- Venkman, get a sample of this.
- It's the real thing.

104
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:16,248
Somebody blows their nose,
and you wanna keep it?

105
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:18,005
I'd like to analyze it.

106
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:21,968
- There's more over here.
- I'm getting stronger readings here.

107
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:29,484
This way.

108
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,840
Come on.

109
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:44,568
Egon, your mucus.

110
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,525
This happen to you before?

111
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:56,880
Oh. First time?

112
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:22,880
It's here.

113
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,808
A full-torso apparition
and it's real.

114
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,204
So, what do we do?

115
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,801
Could you come over here and
talk to me for a second, please?

116
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:44,044
Could you just come over
here for a second, please?

117
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:47,528
Right over here. Come here,
Francine. Come here.

118
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:51,048
- What do we do?
- I don't know. What do you think?

119
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:52,925
Stop that!

120
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:56,244
We've gotta make contact. One of us
should actually try to speak to it.

121
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:57,808
Good idea.

122
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:07,601
Hello.

123
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,724
I'm Peter.

124
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:13,685
Where are you from? Originally.

125
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:21,248
All right. Okay. The usual
stuff isn't working.

126
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:25,568
Okay, I have a plan.
I know exactly what to do.

127
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:29,480
Now, stay close.

128
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:31,764
Stay close.

129
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:34,804
I know. Do exactly as I say.

130
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:37,121
Get ready. Ready?

131
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:38,721
Get her!

132
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:49,849
- Did you see it? What was it?
- We'll get back to you.

133
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:51,288
Wait!

134
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:04,128
Get her. That was your
whole plan. Get her.

135
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,885
- It was scientific.
- I just got overexcited.

136
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:12,881
But wasn't it incredible, Pete? I mean,
we actually touched the etheric plane.

137
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:15,048
You know what this could
mean to the university?

138
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:17,448
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger than the
microchip. Ray, I'm very excited.

139
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,248
I wouldn't say the experience
was completely wasted.

140
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,128
According to these new readings,
I think we have an excellent chance

141
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:23,885
of actually catching a ghost
and holding it indefinitely.

142
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,881
Well, this is great. If the ionization rate
is constant for all ectoplasmic entities,

143
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:31,129
we could really bust some heads.
In a spiritual sense, of course.

144
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,161
Spengs, you serious about
this catching a ghost?

145
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:36,164
I'm always serious.

146
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:40,205
Egon, I'm gonna take back some of
the things I've said about you.

147
00:12:41,824 --> 00:12:44,647
You... You've earned it.

148
00:12:46,544 --> 00:12:50,601
The possibilities are limitless.
Hey, Dean Yeager.

149
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:56,488
I trust you're moving us to
better quarters on campus.

150
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:58,648
No, you're being moved off campus.

151
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:01,364
The Board of Regents has decided
to terminate your grant.

152
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:04,247
You are to vacate these
premises immediately.

153
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:07,281
This is preposterous.
I demand an explanation.

154
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:10,321
Fine. This university
will no longer continue

155
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:13,688
any funding of any kind for
your group's activities.

156
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:15,445
But the kids love us.

157
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:21,482
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose
of science is to serve mankind.

158
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:26,005
You, however, seem to regard science
as some kind of dodge or hustle.

159
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:28,480
Your theories are the worst
kind of popular tripe.

160
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:31,848
Your methods are sloppy, and your
conclusions are highly questionable.

161
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:35,328
You are a poor scientist,
Dr. Venkman.

162
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:37,843
I see.

163
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:42,648
And you have no place in this
department or in this university.

164
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,924
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MIT or Stanford now.

165
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:48,404
They wouldn't touch us with
a 10-meter cattle prod.

166
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:50,808
You're always so concerned
about your reputation.

167
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,688
Einstein did his best stuff when
he was working as a patent clerk.

168
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,608
- You know how much a patent clerk earns?
- No

169
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:58,016
Personally, I like the university.
They gave us money and facilities.

170
00:13:58,017 --> 00:13:59,309
We didn't have to produce anything.

171
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:02,271
You've never been out of college. You
don't know what it's like out there.

172
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:05,653
I've worked in the private
sector. They expect results.

173
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:07,767
For whatever reasons, Ray,

174
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:12,805
call it fate, call it luck,
call it karma,

175
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,688
I believe that everything
happens for a reason.

176
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:19,769
I believe that we were destined
to get thrown out of this dump.

177
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:24,728
- For what purpose?
- To go into business for ourselves.

178
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:30,875
This ecto-containment system that
Spengler and I have in mind is gonna

179
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:34,829
require a load of bread to capitalize.
Where are we gonna get the money?

180
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:39,925
I don't know. I don't know.

181
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:44,001
You're never gonna
regret this, Ray.

182
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:46,648
My parents left me that
house. I was born there.

183
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:49,921
You're not gonna lose the house.
Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.

184
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:52,645
But at 19 percent? You didn't
even bargain with the guy.

185
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:55,200
Ray, for your information,
the interest rate alone

186
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:58,000
for the first five years
comes to 95,000 dollars.

187
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,041
Will you guys relax? We are on
the threshold of establishing

188
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:04,164
the indispensable defense
science of the next decade:

189
00:15:04,224 --> 00:15:07,768
Professional paranormal
investigations and eliminations.

190
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:12,401
The franchise rights alone will make
us rich beyond our wildest dreams.

191
00:15:12,464 --> 00:15:15,604
There's office space, sleeping
quarters and showers on the next floor

192
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,343
and there's a full kitchen
on the top level.

193
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:22,165
It just seems a little pricey for a unique
fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.

194
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:24,084
What do you think, Egon?

195
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:26,408
I think this building
should be condemned.

196
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:29,005
There's serious metal fatigue in
all the load-bearing members.

197
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:32,641
The wiring is substandard. It's completely
inadequate for our power needs.

198
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:35,604
And the neighborhood is
like a demilitarized zone.

199
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:38,564
Hey, does this pole still work?

200
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:45,368
Wow, this place is great.
When can we move in?

201
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:49,361
You gotta try this pole.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

202
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:57,401
Hey, we should stay here tonight,
sleep here. You know, to try it out.

203
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,888
- I think we'll take it.
- Good.

204
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:43,528
Hi.

205
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:51,204
- Oh, Dana, it's you.
- Oh, hi. Yes, Louis, it's me.

206
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:53,641
- I thought it was the drugstore.
- Oh, are you sick?

207
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:55,448
No, no, I'm fine. I feel great.

208
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:58,644
Just ordered some more vitamins
and stuff. I was just exercising.

209
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:01,364
I taped <i>20-Minute Workout</i> on my
machine and played it back at high speed

210
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:03,604
so it only took 10 minutes.
I got a great workout.

211
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:05,487
- Good.
- Want to come in for a mineral water?

212
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:08,721
Oh, I'd really like to, Louis, but I have
to go to rehearsal now. Excuse me.

213
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:10,960
No sweat. I'll take a
rain check on that.

214
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:13,285
I always have plenty of low-sodium
mineral water and other

215
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:15,293
nutritious foods in the house.
But you already know that.

216
00:17:15,294 --> 00:17:17,560
- Yeah, I know that.
- Listen, that reminds me...

217
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:19,548
I'm having a big party
for all my clients.

218
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:21,448
It's my fourth anniversary
as an accountant, you know.

219
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:23,444
And even though you do your own tax
return, which you shouldn't do,

220
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:25,383
I'd like you to stop by, being
that you're my neighbor and all.

221
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:27,521
Well, thank you, Louis.
I'll really try to stop by.

222
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:30,783
Listen, that reminds me, you shouldn't
leave your TV on so loud when you go out.

223
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,800
The creep down the hall
phoned the manager.

224
00:17:32,864 --> 00:17:35,044
That's strange. I didn't
realize I left it on.

225
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,928
Oh, yeah, you know what I did? I climbed on
the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable

226
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:41,365
but I couldn't get in, so you know what
I did? I turned up my TV real loud too

227
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:44,724
so everyone would think that both our
TVs had something wrong with them.

228
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:48,325
Okay, so I'll see you later,
huh? I'll give you a call.

229
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:51,443
I gotta have a shower.

230
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:58,324
<i>Are you troubled by strange
noises in the middle of the night?</i>

231
00:17:58,384 --> 00:18:01,524
<i>Do you experience feelings of
dread in your basement or attic?</i>

232
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:04,801
<i>Have you or any of your family ever
seen a spook, specter or ghost?</i>

233
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:06,759
<i>If the answer is yes, then
don't wait another minute.</i>

234
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:10,001
<i>Pick up your phone and call the
professionals. Ghostbusters.</i>

235
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:12,408
<i>Our courteous and efficient
staff is on call 24 hours a day</i>

236
00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:14,763
<i>to serve all your
supernatural-elimination needs.</i>

237
00:18:14,824 --> 00:18:17,964
<i>We're ready to believe you.</i>

238
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,240
Zuul.

239
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,367
You don't think it's too subtle?

240
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:37,645
You don't think people are gonna
drive down and not see the sign?

241
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:47,688
You can't park that here!

242
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,684
Everybody can relax,
I found the car.

243
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:56,208
Needs some suspension
work and shocks

244
00:19:56,265 --> 00:20:00,245
and brakes, brake pads, linings,
steering box, transmission, rear end.

245
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:01,840
- How much?
- Only 4800.

246
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:04,564
Maybe new rings, also
mufflers, a little wiring.

247
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:10,969
- Janine, any calls?
- No.

248
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:13,521
- Any messages?
- No.

249
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:17,688
- Any customers?
- No, Dr. Venkman.

250
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,968
It's a good job, isn't it?

251
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:24,401
Type something, will you?
We're paying for this stuff.

252
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:27,768
Don't stare at me.
You've got the bug eyes.

253
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:30,005
Janine?

254
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:33,161
Sorry about the "bug eyes"
thing. I'll be in my office.

255
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,927
You're very handy. I can tell.

256
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:44,565
- I bet you like to read a lot too.
- Print is dead.

257
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:48,408
Oh, that's very fascinating
to me. I read a lot myself.

258
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,333
Some people think I'm
too intellectual,

259
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:53,069
but I think it's a fabulous
way to spend your spare time.

260
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:57,161
I also play racquetball.
Do you have any hobbies?

261
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:01,080
I collect spores, molds and fungus.

262
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,128
Hello?

263
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:27,489
Oh, excuse me. Is this...?
This is the Ghostbusters' office.

264
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:30,485
Yes, it is. Can I help you?

265
00:21:30,544 --> 00:21:34,404
I don't have an appointment. I'd
like to talk to someone, please.

266
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:38,548
I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?

267
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:44,769
Um, well, I don't know. What I have
to say may sound a little unusual.

268
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:47,645
That's all we get, day in,
day out, around this place.

269
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:51,168
- Come into my office, Miss...
- Barrett. Dana Barrett.

270
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:55,445
And this voice said, "Zuul", and then I
slammed the refrigerator door and I left.

271
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:58,524
That was two days ago, and I
haven't been back to my apartment.

272
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,724
Generally, you don't see that kind
of behavior in a major appliance.

273
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:03,168
What do you think it was?

274
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:05,688
Well, if I knew what it was,
I wouldn't be here.

275
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:07,323
Egon, what do you think?

276
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:10,488
She's telling the truth.
At least she thinks she is.

277
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:14,968
Well, of course I'm telling the truth.
Who would make up a story like that?

278
00:22:15,024 --> 00:22:16,920
Some are people who
just want attention.

279
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:19,128
Others are just nutballs who
come in off the street.

280
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:23,480
You know what it could be? Past-life
experience intruding on present time.

281
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,161
Could be erased memory stored
in the collective unconscious.

282
00:22:26,224 --> 00:22:29,244
I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance
or telepathic contact either.

283
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:31,888
I'm sorry, I don't believe
in any of those things.

284
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:36,088
Well, that's all right. I don't either.
But there are some things we do,

285
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:39,645
standard procedures in a case like
this, which often bring us results.

286
00:22:39,704 --> 00:22:43,248
Well, I could go to Hall of Records and check
out the structural details in the building.

287
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:45,409
Maybe the building itself has a
history of psychic turbulence.

288
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,848
Right. Good idea.

289
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:49,084
I could look for the name
"Zuul" in the usual literature.

290
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:51,648
<i>- Spates Catalog.</i> Yeah.
<i>- Tobin's Spirit Guide.</i>

291
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,608
Tell you what, I'll take Miss Barrett
back to her apartment and check her out.

292
00:22:55,664 --> 00:22:59,601
I'll go check out Miss
Barrett's apartment. Okay?

293
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:01,888
Okay.

294
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:05,160
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

295
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:14,164
Please, let me.

296
00:23:14,224 --> 00:23:18,368
If something's gonna happen here,
I want it to happen to me first.

297
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,445
That's the closet.

298
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:32,880
They hate this.

299
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:35,287
I like to torture them.

300
00:23:35,344 --> 00:23:39,128
That's right, boys.
It's Dr. Venkman!

301
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,484
It's a lot of space.

302
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,361
- Just you?
- Yes.

303
00:23:50,824 --> 00:23:52,240
Good.

304
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,520
What is that thing you're doing?

305
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:02,329
It's technical. It's one
of our little toys.

306
00:24:02,384 --> 00:24:03,964
I see.

307
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:09,845
That's the bedroom. But nothing
ever happened in there.

308
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,721
What a crime.

309
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:19,441
You know, you don't
act like a scientist.

310
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:24,248
- They're usually pretty stiff.
- You're more like a game-show host.

311
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,480
That's the kitchen, huh?

312
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:46,288
- Dana, are these the eggs?
- Yes.

313
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:49,484
See I was over there, and these eggs
just jumped right out of their shells

314
00:24:49,544 --> 00:24:52,128
- and started to cook on the counter.
- That is weird.

315
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:56,241
And that's when I started to hear that
awful noise coming from the refrigerator.

316
00:24:57,144 --> 00:25:01,528
Dr. Venkman, you've come all this way.
Would you like to check the refrigerator?

317
00:25:02,824 --> 00:25:06,160
Better check the fridge. Good call.

318
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:13,280
Oh, my God.

319
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:16,204
Look at all the junk food.

320
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:19,121
- No. Goddamn it! This wasn't...
- You actually eat this stuff?

321
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,080
Look, this wasn't here.
There was nothing here.

322
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,722
There was a space and there was a building
or something with flames coming out of it.

323
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:28,449
And there were creatures writhing around,
and they were growling and snarling.

324
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:31,281
And there were flames, and I
heard a voice say, "Zuul".

325
00:25:31,344 --> 00:25:32,728
It was right here.

326
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:34,648
I'm sorry, I'm just not
getting any reading.

327
00:25:34,704 --> 00:25:37,724
Well, are you sure you're
using that thing correctly?

328
00:25:37,784 --> 00:25:41,721
I think so. But I'm sure there
are no animals in there.

329
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:43,168
Well, that's great.

330
00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:46,768
Either I have a monster in my
kitchen, or I'm completely crazy.

331
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:49,168
I don't think you're crazy.

332
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:54,649
Oh, good. That makes
me feel so much better.

333
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:56,405
Let me tell you
something about myself.

334
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:59,561
I come home from work to my
place, and all I have is my work.

335
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,204
- There's nothing else in my life.
- Dr. Venkman.

336
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:05,485
I meet you, and I say, "My God, there's
someone with the same problem I have".

337
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:08,368
Yes, we both have the
same problem. You.

338
00:26:11,824 --> 00:26:14,004
I'm gonna go for broke.

339
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:19,321
- I am madly in love with you.
- I don't believe this.

340
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,965
Will you please leave?

341
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:25,365
And then she threw me out of her
life. She thought I was a creep.

342
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:28,401
She thought I was a geek, and
she probably wasn't the first.

343
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:30,764
You are so odd.

344
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:36,888
- No.
- I've got it!

345
00:26:36,944 --> 00:26:39,724
- No, no, no, no
- I'll prove myself to you.

346
00:26:39,784 --> 00:26:41,560
That's not necessary.

347
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:44,405
- Yeah, I'll solve your little problem.
- Okay.

348
00:26:44,464 --> 00:26:48,084
And then you'll say, Pete Venkman's
a guy who can get things done.

349
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:50,160
- I wonder what makes him tick.
- I wonder.

350
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:53,201
I wonder if he'd be interested
in knowing what makes me tick.

351
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:56,044
I'll bet you're gonna be thinking
about me after I'm gone.

352
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:57,564
I bet I am.

353
00:26:58,904 --> 00:27:00,605
No kiss?

354
00:27:10,104 --> 00:27:12,087
To our first customer.

355
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:15,241
To our first and only customer.

356
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,045
I'm gonna need to
draw some petty cash.

357
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,928
I should take her out to dinner.
We don't want to lose her.

358
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:26,009
This magnificent feast here represents
the last of the petty cash.

359
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:30,160
Hey, slow down. Chew your food.

360
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:33,608
Hello, Ghostbusters.

361
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:36,921
Yes, of course they're serious.

362
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:40,284
You do?

363
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,724
You have?

364
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:44,485
No kidding.

365
00:27:44,544 --> 00:27:48,448
Uh-huh. Well, just
give me the address.

366
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:53,165
Yes, of course. Oh, they'll
be totally discreet.

367
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:55,844
Thank you.

368
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:58,160
We got one!

369
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:04,487
It's a call!

370
00:28:11,504 --> 00:28:13,247
Come on!

371
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:48,641
Hey, anybody see a ghost?

372
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,641
- Thank you for coming so quickly.
- Jesus!

373
00:28:55,704 --> 00:28:58,724
The guests are starting to ask questions,
and I'm running out of excuses.

374
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,164
Has it happened before?

375
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:02,805
Well, most of the original staff
knows about the 12th floor.

376
00:29:02,864 --> 00:29:04,401
- The disturbances, I mean.
- Yeah.

377
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:07,364
But it's been quiet for years
up until two weeks ago.

378
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:09,240
It was never, ever
this bad, though.

379
00:29:09,304 --> 00:29:13,284
- Did you ever report it to anyone?
- No. Heavens, no.

380
00:29:13,345 --> 00:29:15,961
The owners don't like us
to even talk about it.

381
00:29:16,024 --> 00:29:18,040
I hope we could take
care of this quietly.

382
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:19,488
- It's done.
- Tonight.

383
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:21,123
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

384
00:29:21,184 --> 00:29:23,767
We handle this kind
of thing all the time.

385
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:34,808
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of a cosmonaut?

386
00:29:34,864 --> 00:29:38,681
No, we're exterminators. Somebody
saw a cockroach up on 12th.

387
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:43,084
- That's gotta be some cockroach.
- Bite your head off, man.

388
00:29:46,544 --> 00:29:50,087
- Going up?
- I'll take the next one.

389
00:29:52,464 --> 00:29:53,508
You know, it's just occurred to me

390
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:56,305
we really haven't had a completely
successful test of this equipment.

391
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:58,568
- I blame myself.
- So do I.

392
00:29:58,624 --> 00:30:01,601
- Well, no sense worrying about it now.
- Why worry?

393
00:30:01,704 --> 00:30:06,165
Each of us is wearing an unlicensed
nuclear accelerator on his back.

394
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:10,565
Yep. Well, let's get ready.
Switch me on.

395
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:47,684
What the hell are you doing?

396
00:30:48,984 --> 00:30:51,208
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,369
We thought you were someone else.

398
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:57,488
Successful test.

399
00:30:57,784 --> 00:30:59,528
I guess so.

400
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:02,041
- I think we'd better split up.
- Good idea.

401
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:04,087
Yeah, we can do more
damage that way.

402
00:31:31,104 --> 00:31:33,600
Venkman? Venkman!

403
00:31:40,944 --> 00:31:43,288
Disgusting blob.

404
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,244
I'm gonna have to hold him myself.

405
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:27,805
Come in, Ray.

406
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:32,161
Venkman! I saw it,
I saw it, I saw it!

407
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:34,244
It's right here, Ray.

408
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:35,924
It's looking at me.

409
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:37,924
<i>He's an ugly little
spud, isn't he?</i>

410
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:39,520
I think he can hear you, Ray.

411
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,520
Don't move. It won't hurt you.

412
00:32:48,824 --> 00:32:50,687
Venkman!

413
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:54,961
Venkman! Pete!

414
00:32:57,384 --> 00:32:59,444
Venkman, what happened?
Are you okay?

415
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:00,963
He slimed me.

416
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:04,404
That's great!
Actual physical contact!

417
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:06,644
- Can you move?
<i>- Ray. Ray! Come in, please.</i>

418
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:08,088
I feel so funky.

419
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:10,640
Spengler! I'm with Venkman.

420
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:12,247
He got slimed!

421
00:33:12,304 --> 00:33:14,244
<i>That's great, Ray.
Save some for me.</i>

422
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:16,965
<i>Get down here, right away!
It just went into a ballroom.</i>

423
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:18,404
Okay, we'll be right there.

424
00:33:21,384 --> 00:33:23,761
Okay, sir, if you and your staff
could please wait out here,

425
00:33:23,824 --> 00:33:26,168
we'll take care of everything.

426
00:33:43,744 --> 00:33:46,241
There it is. On the ceiling.

427
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:50,804
That's the one that got me.

428
00:33:57,984 --> 00:33:59,368
All right, boys.

429
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:01,201
Ready?

430
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:02,648
Throw it!

431
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:13,200
I did that. I did that.

432
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,925
- That's my fault.
- It's okay. The table broke the fall.

433
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,800
There's something very important
I forgot to tell you.

434
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:21,208
- What?
- Don't cross the streams.

435
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:23,884
- Why?
- It would be bad.

436
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:27,488
I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing.
What do you mean, "bad"?

437
00:34:27,544 --> 00:34:30,741
Try to imagine all life as you
know it stopping instantaneously

438
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:34,009
and every molecule in your body
exploding at the speed of light.

439
00:34:34,224 --> 00:34:35,925
Total protonic reversal.

440
00:34:35,984 --> 00:34:39,844
Right, that's bad. Okay,
important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.

441
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:44,244
All right, Ray, take the left.
Egon, take the right.

442
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:53,041
Okay, Ray, just give me
one high and outside.

443
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:54,880
Ray!

444
00:34:57,384 --> 00:34:58,844
Egon!

445
00:35:06,224 --> 00:35:08,240
Okay, all right.
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

446
00:35:11,504 --> 00:35:13,084
Nice shooting, Tex!

447
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,444
I assure you, Mrs. Van Houten,
there is no problem with the room.

448
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:17,848
It'll be ready promptly on time as
soon as your guests are with us.

449
00:35:17,904 --> 00:35:20,008
The last throw took something out
of him, but he's gonna move.

450
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:22,965
I need some room to put the
trap down. Give me some room.

451
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,920
You'll excuse me, please.

452
00:35:32,024 --> 00:35:35,001
- Gotta get this in the clear.
- Wait, wait, wait!

453
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:37,680
I've always wanted to do this.

454
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:39,324
And...

455
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:42,241
- The flowers are still standing!
- Okay, on my go-signal.

456
00:35:42,304 --> 00:35:45,520
Spengler, I want a confinement
stream from you, okay? Go!

457
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:48,320
Okay, hold him up there. He's
gonna move. Hold him up!

458
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:49,844
Go!

459
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:53,367
- It's working, Ray.
- Start bringing him down.

460
00:35:53,424 --> 00:35:55,200
You got him. Don't
cross the stream.

461
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:59,365
Maybe now you'll never slime a guy
with a positron collider, huh?

462
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:02,761
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.

463
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:05,841
All right, I'm opening the trap now.
Don't look directly into the trap.

464
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,485
I looked at the trap, Ray.

465
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:12,885
Turn your streams off as soon as I close
the trap. Get ready. I'm closing it.

466
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:14,884
Now!

467
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:33,928
It's in there.

468
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,641
Hey.

469
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:39,241
Well, that wasn't such
a chore, now, was it?

470
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,084
Mr. Smith, quickly.
I want that door open now!

471
00:36:44,144 --> 00:36:45,964
Donald, stand over there.

472
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:49,201
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

473
00:36:49,264 --> 00:36:50,724
Did you see it? What is it?

474
00:36:50,784 --> 00:36:52,168
We got it.

475
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:54,240
What is it? Will there
be any more of them?

476
00:36:54,304 --> 00:36:57,204
Sir, what you had there was
what we refer to as a focused,

477
00:36:57,264 --> 00:37:00,961
non-terminal repeating phantasm,
or a class-five full-roaming vapor.

478
00:37:01,024 --> 00:37:02,767
Real nasty one too.

479
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:04,687
And now,

480
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:07,356
let's talk seriously. Now,
for the entrapment...

481
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:10,505
we're gonna have to ask you for
four big ones, $4000 for that.

482
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:15,128
But we are having a special this week on
proton charging and storage of the beast.

483
00:37:15,184 --> 00:37:17,680
That's only gonna come to
1000 dollars, fortunately.

484
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:21,287
Five thousand dollars? I had no idea
it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

485
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:23,583
That's all right. We can just
put it right back in there.

486
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,480
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

487
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:29,045
No! All right! Anything.

488
00:37:29,104 --> 00:37:30,488
Thanks so much.

489
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:32,364
Thank you. Hope we
can help you again.

490
00:37:32,464 --> 00:37:35,244
Coming through! One class-five
free-roaming vapor.

491
00:37:35,344 --> 00:37:38,408
<i>Good Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby.
Today the entire Eastern seaboard</i>

492
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,484
<i>is alive with talk of incidents
of paranormal activity.</i>

493
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:44,441
<i>Alleged ghost-sightings and
related supernatural occurrences</i>

494
00:37:44,504 --> 00:37:47,120
<i>have been reported across
the entire tri-state area.</i>

495
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:49,725
Everybody has heard ghost
stories around the campfire.

496
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:52,924
Heck, my grandma used to spin
yarns about a spectral locomotive

497
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:55,480
that would rocket past the
farm where she grew up.

498
00:37:55,544 --> 00:37:57,648
But now, as if some
unforeseen authority...

499
00:38:17,104 --> 00:38:18,488
Stand aside, please!

500
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:21,761
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in
topic today, ghosts and ghostbusting.

501
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:24,364
The controversy builds,
more sightings are reported.

502
00:38:24,424 --> 00:38:25,960
Some maintain that these

503
00:38:26,025 --> 00:38:29,689
professional paranormal eliminators
in New York are the cause of it all.

504
00:38:34,864 --> 00:38:36,204
I got it! I got it!

505
00:38:37,744 --> 00:38:39,084
Pete! Ray!

506
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:49,865
<i>Still making headlines
all across the country,</i>

507
00:38:49,904 --> 00:38:53,481
<i>the Ghostbusters are at it again, this
time at the fashionable dance club,</i>

508
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:57,282
<i>The Rose. The boys in gray slugged
it out with a pretty pesky poltergeist,</i>

509
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:58,848
<i>then stayed on to
dance the night away</i>

510
00:38:58,873 --> 00:39:01,238
<i>with some of the lovely ladies
who witnessed the disturbance.</i>

511
00:39:01,264 --> 00:39:04,241
<i>This is Casey Kasem.
Now on with the countdown.</i>

512
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:06,440
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

513
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,204
No job is too big.
No fee is too big.

514
00:39:10,504 --> 00:39:13,000
Is it just a mist, or does
it have arms and legs?

515
00:39:13,065 --> 00:39:15,681
<i>As they say in TV, I'm sure
there's one big question</i>

516
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:18,928
<i>on everybody's mind and I imagine
you are the man to answer that.</i>

517
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:22,121
<i>How is Elvis, and have
you seen him lately?</i>

518
00:40:04,544 --> 00:40:06,768
Do you believe in UFOs,
astral projections,

519
00:40:06,825 --> 00:40:09,288
mental telepathy,
ESP, clairvoyance,

520
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:12,364
spirit photography,
telekinetic movement,

521
00:40:12,424 --> 00:40:17,201
full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of Atlantis?

522
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:21,320
Uh, if there's a steady paycheck in
it, I'll believe anything you say.

523
00:40:22,384 --> 00:40:25,328
I gotta get some sleep. I'm dying.

524
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:26,844
You don't look good.

525
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:28,844
- I don't?
- Well, you've looked better.

526
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:30,605
You didn't used to look like this.

527
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:32,605
Can you hold, please?

528
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:35,248
Here's the paper on the
Brooklyn. She paid with Visa.

529
00:40:35,344 --> 00:40:37,449
Here's tonight's worksheet.

530
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:39,205
Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.

531
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:42,241
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.

532
00:40:42,304 --> 00:40:45,161
Beautiful. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

533
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:48,485
- Congratulations.
- Can you help me, please?

534
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:53,201
Welcome aboard.

535
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:57,139
I don't know where they get these
guest conductors. I mean...

536
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,696
someone should tell him it's not gonna
do much good to scream at us in German.

537
00:40:59,736 --> 00:41:02,880
Well, I don't think that the
man is competent to conduct

538
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:04,448
a major symphony orchestra.

539
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:10,521
- Um, could you wait here a minute?
- Huh? Uh, sure.

540
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:17,764
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.

541
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,168
- That was a wonderful rehearsal.
- You heard that?

542
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:22,164
Yes. You're the best
one in your row.

543
00:41:22,224 --> 00:41:23,728
Oh, thank you.

544
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:27,280
You're good. Most people can't hear
me with the whole orchestra playing.

545
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:29,104
Ah, I don't have to take
this abuse from you.

546
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:31,361
I got hundreds of people
dying to abuse me.

547
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:33,484
I know. You're a big celebrity now.

548
00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:36,728
Do you have some information
for me on my case?

549
00:41:40,824 --> 00:41:42,480
Who's the stiff?

550
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:46,048
The stiff happens to be one of the
finest musicians in the world.

551
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,968
Do you have some information
for me, please?

552
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:50,565
Well, sure, but I prefer to
give it to you in private.

553
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:53,928
- Why don't you tell me now?
- Okay. I found the name Zuul for you.

554
00:41:53,984 --> 00:41:59,361
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demigod
worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the...

555
00:41:59,624 --> 00:42:01,640
What's that word?

556
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:03,324
- Hittites.
- Hittites,

557
00:42:03,384 --> 00:42:06,449
the Mesopotamians
and the Sumerians.

558
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,688
Zuul was the minion of Gozer.

559
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:11,968
What's Gozer?

560
00:42:12,024 --> 00:42:16,168
- Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
- Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

561
00:42:16,224 --> 00:42:19,201
I'm working on that. If we could
get together Thursday night,

562
00:42:19,264 --> 00:42:22,568
I'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we could exchange information.

563
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:26,788
- I can't see you Thursday. I'm busy.
- Miss Barrett...

564
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:30,189
you seem to think there is something
wrong up here that says, in your mind:

565
00:42:30,224 --> 00:42:33,485
"He enjoys taking his evenings off
and spending it with his clients."

566
00:42:33,544 --> 00:42:38,125
No. I'm making a special exception
in your case because...

567
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:39,728
I respect you.

568
00:42:39,784 --> 00:42:42,938
It's corny, but I respect you as
an artist. And as a dresser too.

569
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:45,825
This is a magnificent coordination
you have going here today.

570
00:42:45,904 --> 00:42:47,192
I'll see you Thursday.

571
00:42:47,217 --> 00:42:50,384
I'll bring the <i>Roylance Guide</i>
and we'll eat and read.

572
00:42:56,944 --> 00:42:59,168
- So who the hell is that?
- He's just a friend.

573
00:42:59,224 --> 00:43:00,683
- A friend?
- An old friend.

574
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:02,440
Bye! Well, I'll see you Thursday!

575
00:43:02,505 --> 00:43:06,169
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

576
00:43:06,224 --> 00:43:09,081
You're still very pale,
though. A little sun.

577
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:11,804
- Well, what does he do?
- He's a scientist.

578
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:26,685
This is where we store all the vapors
and entities and slimers that we trap.

579
00:43:26,744 --> 00:43:32,002
Very simple, really. A loaded trap
here. Open, unlock the system.

580
00:43:32,064 --> 00:43:33,448
Insert the trap.

581
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,128
Release.

582
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:41,485
Close, lock the system.
Set your entry grid.

583
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:43,044
Neutronize your field.

584
00:43:43,264 --> 00:43:45,084
And...

585
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:47,761
when the light is green,
the trap is clean.

586
00:43:47,824 --> 00:43:50,768
The ghost is incarcerated here in
our custom-made storage facility.

587
00:43:50,824 --> 00:43:54,368
There's a man from the EPA here to
see you. He's waiting in your office.

588
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:57,040
- EPA? What's he want?
- I don't know.

589
00:43:57,104 --> 00:44:00,081
All I do know is I've been working
two weeks without a break,

590
00:44:00,144 --> 00:44:02,847
and you promised me
you'd hire more help.

591
00:44:02,904 --> 00:44:05,248
Janine, someone with
your qualifications

592
00:44:05,304 --> 00:44:09,121
would have no trouble finding
a topflight job in either

593
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:12,007
the food service or
housekeeping industries.

594
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:16,648
- Are you gonna answer that?
- I've quit better jobs than this.

595
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:19,165
Ghostbusters! What do you want?

596
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:21,808
- Can I help you?
- I'm Walter Peck.

597
00:44:21,904 --> 00:44:25,482
I represent the Environmental
Protection Agency, the third district.

598
00:44:25,544 --> 00:44:28,040
Great. How's it going down there?

599
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:32,088
Are you Peter Venkman?

600
00:44:32,944 --> 00:44:34,568
Yes, I'm...

601
00:44:34,624 --> 00:44:36,008
Dr. Venkman.

602
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:38,844
Exactly what are you a
doctor of, Mr. Venkman?

603
00:44:38,904 --> 00:44:42,285
Well, I have Ph.D.'s in
parapsychology and psychology.

604
00:44:42,904 --> 00:44:44,767
I see.

605
00:44:44,824 --> 00:44:47,681
And now you catch ghosts.

606
00:44:47,744 --> 00:44:49,760
Yeah. You could say that.

607
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,645
And how many ghosts have
you caught, Mr. Venkman?

608
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:55,364
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- And where do you put

609
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:58,281
these ghosts once you catch them?

610
00:44:58,384 --> 00:45:00,804
Into a storage facility.

611
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:04,161
And would this storage facility
be located on these premises?

612
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:08,804
- Yes.
- And may I see this storage facility?

613
00:45:08,864 --> 00:45:12,200
No. And why not, Mr. Venkman?

614
00:45:13,584 --> 00:45:16,801
Because you did not
use the magic word.

615
00:45:18,864 --> 00:45:22,484
What is the magic
word, Mr. Venkman?

616
00:45:23,664 --> 00:45:25,048
Please.

617
00:45:26,264 --> 00:45:29,961
May I please see the storage
facility, Mr. Venkman?

618
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:31,760
Why do you want to see
the storage facility?

619
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:33,924
Well, because I'm curious.

620
00:45:34,104 --> 00:45:36,404
I want to know more
about what you do here.

621
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:39,284
Frankly, there've been a lot
of wild stories in the media

622
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:43,688
and we want to assess any possible
environmental impact from your operation.

623
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:45,804
For instance, the
presence of noxious,

624
00:45:45,904 --> 00:45:49,121
possibly hazardous waste
chemicals in your basement.

625
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:53,328
Now, you either show me what is down
there, or I come back with a court order.

626
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:58,209
You go get a court order, and I'll sue
your ass for wrongful prosecution!

627
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:01,601
You can have it your
way, Mr. Venkman.

628
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:03,921
I'm worried, Ray. It's
getting crowded in there,

629
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:07,237
and all my recent data points to
something big on the horizon.

630
00:46:07,504 --> 00:46:09,445
What do you mean "big"?

631
00:46:09,904 --> 00:46:14,245
Well, let's say this Twinkie
represents the normal amount

632
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,845
of psychokinetic energy
in the New York area.

633
00:46:16,904 --> 00:46:20,601
According to this morning's
sample, it would be a Twinkie

634
00:46:20,664 --> 00:46:24,165
35 feet long, weighing
approximately 600 pounds.

635
00:46:25,424 --> 00:46:27,125
That's a big Twinkie.

636
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:29,604
We could be on the verge
of a fourfold cross-rip,

637
00:46:29,664 --> 00:46:32,968
a PKE surge of incredible,
even dangerous, proportions.

638
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:36,848
We just had a visit from the
Environmental Protection Agency.

639
00:46:36,904 --> 00:46:39,084
- How's the grid holding up?
- Not good.

640
00:46:39,184 --> 00:46:41,048
Tell him about the Twinkie.

641
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:43,444
What about the Twinkie?

642
00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:38,601
- Oh, Dana, it's you.
- Hello, Louis.

643
00:47:38,704 --> 00:47:41,485
You gotta come in here. You're
missing a classic party.

644
00:47:41,584 --> 00:47:45,641
Yes, well, I would, Louis,
but I have a date coming.

645
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:50,280
You made a date

646
00:47:50,344 --> 00:47:56,442
- tonight?
- Well, I... I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.

647
00:47:57,424 --> 00:48:01,044
Oh, that's okay. You
can bring him along.

648
00:48:01,384 --> 00:48:04,524
All right. Maybe
we'll stop by, okay?

649
00:48:04,624 --> 00:48:06,463
That's great. I'll tell
everybody you're coming.

650
00:48:06,464 --> 00:48:09,408
We're gonna play Twister, we're
gonna do some breakdancing...

651
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:11,284
Hey...

652
00:48:11,984 --> 00:48:15,724
Hey, let me in! It's Louis!
Somebody, let me in!

653
00:48:39,704 --> 00:48:41,284
Hello?

654
00:48:41,344 --> 00:48:43,448
Oh, hi, Mom.

655
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,204
I've been busy.

656
00:48:45,264 --> 00:48:47,760
Well... No, everything is fine.

657
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:51,009
Yeah. No, just that one time.

658
00:48:51,064 --> 00:48:53,168
Oh, I am.

659
00:48:53,904 --> 00:48:55,680
I will.

660
00:48:56,784 --> 00:49:01,364
I won't. Mom, um,
I have to go. I have a date.

661
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:05,561
Yes. No, no one you know. It's...

662
00:49:06,384 --> 00:49:09,164
Well, he's a Ghostbuster.

663
00:49:09,624 --> 00:49:11,804
Those guys on TV.

664
00:49:12,584 --> 00:49:14,447
Yes, well, I'll have
to let you know.

665
00:49:14,504 --> 00:49:16,968
Okay. Love to Dad.

666
00:49:17,024 --> 00:49:20,568
Right. Bye. Bye.

667
00:49:40,024 --> 00:49:42,084
Oh, Shit.

668
00:50:12,184 --> 00:50:15,400
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength Tylenol?

669
00:50:15,465 --> 00:50:18,649
Gee, I think all I got is
acetylsalicylic acid. Generic.

670
00:50:18,704 --> 00:50:22,489
See, I can get 600 tablets of that for
the same price as 300 of the name brand.

671
00:50:22,544 --> 00:50:24,801
That makes good financial
sense. Good advice.

672
00:50:24,864 --> 00:50:27,524
Hey, this is real smoked salmon
from Nova Scotia, Canada,

673
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:28,968
24.95 a pound.

674
00:50:29,024 --> 00:50:31,129
It only cost me 14.12
after tax, though.

675
00:50:31,184 --> 00:50:33,183
I'm giving this whole thing
as a promotional expense.

676
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:37,044
That's why I invited clients instead of
friends. You having a good time, Marv?

677
00:50:37,104 --> 00:50:39,765
How you doing? Why don't you have some
of the Brie. It's at room temperature.

678
00:50:39,824 --> 00:50:41,583
You think it's too warm
in here for the Brie?

679
00:50:41,584 --> 00:50:43,764
Louis, I'm going home.

680
00:50:43,824 --> 00:50:46,485
Don't leave yet. Listen,
maybe if we start dancing,

681
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,560
other people will join in.

682
00:50:48,624 --> 00:50:50,488
Okay.

683
00:50:53,064 --> 00:50:55,921
Oh, don't move. I just
gotta get the door.

684
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:58,927
- Ted! Annette!
- Hi.

685
00:50:58,984 --> 00:51:01,360
I'm glad you could come. How
you doing? Give me your coats.

686
00:51:01,424 --> 00:51:03,887
Everybody, this is Ted
and Annette Fleming.

687
00:51:03,944 --> 00:51:05,328
How are you?

688
00:51:05,385 --> 00:51:08,208
Ted has a small carpet-cleaning
business in receivership.

689
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:11,481
Annette's drawing a salary from a
deferred bonus from two years ago.

690
00:51:11,544 --> 00:51:15,524
They got 15,000 left on
the house at 8 percent.

691
00:51:15,584 --> 00:51:17,960
So they're okay!

692
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:20,280
Does anybody want
to play Parcheesi?

693
00:51:23,184 --> 00:51:25,005
Okay, who brought the dog?

694
00:51:45,904 --> 00:51:50,845
Help! There's a bear loose
in my apartment! Help! Help!

695
00:51:53,024 --> 00:51:54,440
Help!

696
00:51:54,504 --> 00:51:57,524
- What?
- A bear in his apartment.

697
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:03,964
I'm gonna bring this up at
the next tenants' meeting.

698
00:52:04,024 --> 00:52:07,208
There's not supposed to be
any pets in the building.

699
00:52:21,544 --> 00:52:26,168
Let me in. There's gotta be
a way in here. I gotta get...

700
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:32,001
Somebody, let me in!

701
00:52:37,944 --> 00:52:39,328
Nice doggy.

702
00:52:39,384 --> 00:52:41,367
Cute little pooch.

703
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:44,281
Maybe I got a Milk-Bone.

704
00:53:02,864 --> 00:53:04,804
- Hey, what happened?
- Some moron brought

705
00:53:04,864 --> 00:53:07,928
a cougar to a party,
and it went berserk.

706
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:13,369
Hi, I'm going up to
Dana Barrett's. Okay.

707
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:33,284
Hello?

708
00:53:35,584 --> 00:53:38,124
That's a different look
for you, isn't it?

709
00:53:38,184 --> 00:53:40,244
Are you the Keymaster?

710
00:53:41,865 --> 00:53:43,969
Not that I know of.

711
00:53:55,344 --> 00:53:57,360
Are you the Keymaster?

712
00:53:57,424 --> 00:53:58,808
Yes.

713
00:53:59,064 --> 00:54:02,008
I'm a friend of his. He
told me to meet him here.

714
00:54:02,544 --> 00:54:05,085
- I didn't get your name.
- I am Zuul.

715
00:54:05,144 --> 00:54:07,324
I am the Gatekeeper.

716
00:54:12,784 --> 00:54:17,528
- What are we doing today, Zuul?
- Must prepare for the coming of Gozer.

717
00:54:18,184 --> 00:54:19,764
Gozer, huh?

718
00:54:20,704 --> 00:54:22,480
The Destructor.

719
00:54:30,264 --> 00:54:31,648
Are we still going out?

720
00:54:34,544 --> 00:54:38,087
You know, you could pick up the
place if you're expecting someone.

721
00:54:38,624 --> 00:54:41,525
Do you want this body?

722
00:54:42,064 --> 00:54:43,568
Is this a trick question?

723
00:54:46,864 --> 00:54:49,208
I guess the roses worked, huh?

724
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:51,324
Take me now,

725
00:54:51,384 --> 00:54:53,041
sub-creature.

726
00:54:53,104 --> 00:54:54,967
We never talk anymore.

727
00:54:55,584 --> 00:55:00,842
Easy. I make it a rule never to get
involved with possessed people.

728
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:04,728
Actually, it's more of a
guideline than a rule.

729
00:55:04,784 --> 00:55:06,244
You know, I can...

730
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:08,724
I want you inside me.

731
00:55:09,864 --> 00:55:11,520
Go ahead. No, I can't.

732
00:55:11,584 --> 00:55:14,287
Sounds like you got at least
two people in there already.

733
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,207
Might be a little crowded.

734
00:55:16,264 --> 00:55:18,521
Come on, why don't
you just quit trying

735
00:55:18,584 --> 00:55:21,681
to upset and disturb
Dr. Venkman and just relax.

736
00:55:21,744 --> 00:55:25,244
Lie down there. Relax.
Put your hands on your chest.

737
00:55:25,304 --> 00:55:28,127
What I'd really like
to do is talk to Dana.

738
00:55:28,184 --> 00:55:30,080
I want to talk to Dana.

739
00:55:30,144 --> 00:55:31,604
Dana, it's Peter.

740
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:35,329
There is no Dana.
There is only Zuul.

741
00:55:35,425 --> 00:55:37,365
Oh, Zuulie, you nut. Now, come on.

742
00:55:37,824 --> 00:55:40,168
Come on, I want to
talk to Dana. Dana.

743
00:55:40,225 --> 00:55:42,601
Just relax. Come on. Dana.

744
00:55:42,664 --> 00:55:44,560
Dana. Can I talk to Dana?

745
00:55:44,624 --> 00:55:48,321
There is no Dana, only Zuul.

746
00:55:48,384 --> 00:55:50,968
What a lovely singing
voice you must have.

747
00:55:51,024 --> 00:55:53,040
Now, I'm gonna count
to three, Zuulie.

748
00:55:53,104 --> 00:55:54,728
And if I don't talk to Dana...

749
00:55:55,344 --> 00:55:58,441
there's gonna be some real trouble
in this apartment, I think.

750
00:55:58,504 --> 00:55:59,964
One.

751
00:56:02,144 --> 00:56:03,845
Two.

752
00:56:05,264 --> 00:56:06,965
Two and a half.

753
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:50,528
Please come down.

754
00:56:52,344 --> 00:56:57,405
I am the Keymaster. The
Destructor is coming.

755
00:56:57,744 --> 00:57:00,447
The Traveler. The Destroyer.

756
00:57:06,304 --> 00:57:08,048
Gatekeeper.

757
00:57:13,424 --> 00:57:14,808
I am Vinz.

758
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:17,283
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

759
00:57:17,344 --> 00:57:20,887
Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the
Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?

760
00:57:20,944 --> 00:57:23,888
Hey, he pulls the wagon, I make
the deals. You want a ride?

761
00:57:32,624 --> 00:57:36,245
Wait for the sign. Then all
prisoners will be released.

762
00:57:36,304 --> 00:57:39,848
You will perish in flame, you
and all your kind! Gatekeeper!

763
00:57:40,104 --> 00:57:41,488
What an asshole.

764
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:50,324
- Dropping off or picking up?
- Dropping off.

765
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,400
Just a moment.

766
00:57:55,664 --> 00:57:57,408
- You a Ghostbuster?
- Yes.

767
00:57:57,464 --> 00:57:59,824
We picked up this guy. Now we
don't know what to do with him.

768
00:57:59,824 --> 00:58:02,321
Bellevue doesn't want him, and I'm
afraid to put him in the lock up.

769
00:58:02,384 --> 00:58:05,284
I know you guys are into this stuff,
so I figured we'd check with you.

770
00:58:05,344 --> 00:58:06,967
All right.

771
00:58:09,784 --> 00:58:11,921
Are you the Gatekeeper?

772
00:58:14,704 --> 00:58:17,048
You better bring him inside.

773
00:58:18,024 --> 00:58:20,521
You are so kind to
take care of that man.

774
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:22,480
You know, you are a
real humanitarian.

775
00:58:22,544 --> 00:58:25,008
I don't think he's human.

776
00:58:32,544 --> 00:58:34,124
What did you say your name was?

777
00:58:35,024 --> 00:58:37,204
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

778
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:39,444
According to this, his
name's Louis Tully.

779
00:58:39,504 --> 00:58:41,924
Lives on Central Park West.

780
00:58:43,464 --> 00:58:45,928
Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully?

781
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,047
- Do I?
- Yes, have some.

782
00:58:48,144 --> 00:58:50,444
Yes, have some.

783
00:58:51,624 --> 00:58:54,644
Vinz, you said before you
were waiting for a sign.

784
00:58:54,704 --> 00:58:57,440
- What sign are you waiting for?
- Gozer the Traveler.

785
00:58:57,504 --> 00:58:59,761
He will come in one of
the pre-chosen forms.

786
00:58:59,824 --> 00:59:04,001
During the rectification of the Vuldronaii,
the Traveler came as a large Torb.

787
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:07,768
Then, during the third reconciliation of
the last of the Meketrex supplicants,

788
00:59:07,824 --> 00:59:11,128
they chose a new form for
him, that of a giant Sloar!

789
00:59:11,184 --> 00:59:13,680
Many Shubs and Zuuls knew
what it was to be roasted

790
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:16,400
in the depths of the Sloar
that day, I can tell you.

791
00:59:16,464 --> 00:59:19,768
- Egon.
- Excuse me.

792
00:59:21,584 --> 00:59:24,724
There's something very
strange about that man.

793
00:59:26,744 --> 00:59:29,480
Listen, I'm usually very psychic,
and I have a terrible feeling

794
00:59:29,544 --> 00:59:32,608
that something awful is
gonna happen to you.

795
00:59:33,344 --> 00:59:35,961
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

796
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:39,401
I'll get it.

797
00:59:41,904 --> 00:59:44,160
- Hello?
<i>- Egon, it's Peter.</i>

798
00:59:44,224 --> 00:59:47,440
- Thanks, I've got it.
- I have news from the world of Gozer.

799
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:50,644
<i>- What is it, Peter?</i>
- I'm here with Dana Barrett.

800
00:59:50,704 --> 00:59:53,320
It seems the Goz has
been putting some moves

801
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:56,405
- on my would-be girlfriend.
<i>- How is she?</i>

802
00:59:56,464 --> 00:59:59,920
I think we can get her a
guest shot on <i>Wild Kingdom.</i>

803
00:59:59,984 --> 01:00:02,928
I just whacked her up with
about 300 cc's of Thorazine.

804
01:00:02,985 --> 01:00:07,041
She's gonna take a little nap now,
but she says she's the Gatekeeper.

805
01:00:07,105 --> 01:00:09,524
- Does that make any sense to you?
<i>- Some.</i>

806
01:00:09,584 --> 01:00:12,167
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.

807
01:00:12,224 --> 01:00:14,960
Oh, wonderful. We have to
get these two together.

808
01:00:17,264 --> 01:00:19,683
I think that would be
extraordinarily dangerous.

809
01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:23,048
Okay, well, hold onto him.
I'll be there in a little while.

810
01:00:23,104 --> 01:00:25,328
Good.

811
01:00:25,384 --> 01:00:30,205
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find
Ray. I need him here immediately.

812
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,845
Bad news, honey,
I gotta go to work.

813
01:00:37,904 --> 01:00:40,761
Hey, will you stay here
in bed until I get back?

814
01:00:50,344 --> 01:00:53,047
Hey, Ray, do you believe in God?

815
01:00:53,104 --> 01:00:54,160
Never met him.

816
01:00:54,224 --> 01:00:58,642
Yeah, well, I do. And I love
Jesus' style, you know?

817
01:00:58,704 --> 01:01:02,608
This roof cap is made of a
magnesium-tungsten alloy.

818
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:05,008
What are you so
involved with there?

819
01:01:05,064 --> 01:01:07,231
These are the blueprints for
the structural ironwork

820
01:01:07,256 --> 01:01:11,036
in Dana Barrett's apartment building,
and they're very, very strange.

821
01:01:11,264 --> 01:01:14,765
Hey, Ray, do you remember
something in the Bible about

822
01:01:14,824 --> 01:01:18,761
the last days, when the dead
would rise from the grave?

823
01:01:19,064 --> 01:01:21,845
I remember Revelations 7:12.

824
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:24,361
And I looked as he
opened the sixth seal.

825
01:01:24,424 --> 01:01:26,408
And behold, there was
a great earthquake.

826
01:01:26,464 --> 01:01:28,884
And the sun became as
black as sackcloth.

827
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:30,723
And the moon became as blood.

828
01:01:30,784 --> 01:01:33,684
And the seas boiled.
And the skies fell.

829
01:01:35,304 --> 01:01:38,161
- Judgment day.
- Judgment day.

830
01:01:38,224 --> 01:01:41,201
Every ancient religion has its own
myth about the end of the world.

831
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:44,885
Myth? Ray, has it
ever occurred to you

832
01:01:44,984 --> 01:01:47,121
that maybe the reason
we've been so busy lately

833
01:01:47,184 --> 01:01:50,281
is because the dead have
been rising from the grave?

834
01:01:55,064 --> 01:01:59,481
- How about a little music?
- Yeah.

835
01:02:36,704 --> 01:02:38,284
This way.

836
01:02:46,384 --> 01:02:47,644
Excuse me.

837
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,792
Excuse me. Just where do
you think you're going?

838
01:02:50,824 --> 01:02:53,964
Step aside, miss, or I'll have you arrested
for interfering with the police...

839
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:56,564
Oh, no. Hold on. I've seen TV.
I know you can't come in here

840
01:02:56,624 --> 01:02:58,223
without a warrant or
a writ or something.

841
01:02:58,224 --> 01:03:01,321
Cease and Desist All Commerce order.
Seizure of Premises and Chattels.

842
01:03:01,384 --> 01:03:04,165
Ban on the use of Public Utilities
for Non-Licensed Waste Handlers

843
01:03:04,224 --> 01:03:06,960
and a federal Entry
and Inspection order.

844
01:03:07,744 --> 01:03:10,088
Vinz, there's one more
test I'd like to perform.

845
01:03:10,144 --> 01:03:14,321
Egon. I tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.

846
01:03:14,384 --> 01:03:18,005
- Excuse me, this is private property.
- Shut this off. Shut these all off.

847
01:03:18,104 --> 01:03:20,808
I'm warning you. Turning off these
machines would be extremely hazardous.

848
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:23,415
I'll tell you what's hazardous.
You're facing federal prosecution

849
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:25,648
for at least a half a dozen
environmental violations.

850
01:03:25,704 --> 01:03:28,293
Now, either you shut off these
beams, or we shut them off for you.

851
01:03:32,704 --> 01:03:35,527
Try to understand, this is a
high-voltage laser containment system.

852
01:03:35,584 --> 01:03:38,320
Simply turning it off would be
like dropping a bomb in the city.

853
01:03:38,384 --> 01:03:41,688
Don't patronize me. I'm not grotesquely
stupid, like the people you bilk.

854
01:03:41,744 --> 01:03:43,349
At ease, officer.
I'm Peter Venkman.

855
01:03:43,374 --> 01:03:45,183
I think there's just been a
slight misunderstanding,

856
01:03:45,184 --> 01:03:47,288
and I want to cooperate
in any way that I can.

857
01:03:47,344 --> 01:03:49,764
Forget it, Venkman. You had
your chance to cooperate,

858
01:03:49,825 --> 01:03:53,522
but you thought it'd be more fun to
insult me. Now it is my turn, wiseass.

859
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:55,600
He wants to shut down the
protection grid, Peter.

860
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:58,370
You shut that thing down, and we are
not gonna be held responsible...

861
01:03:58,384 --> 01:04:02,081
- You'll be responsible. Shut it off.
- No, we won't be held responsible.

862
01:04:02,144 --> 01:04:05,121
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.

863
01:04:06,104 --> 01:04:08,721
I've never seen anything like
this before. I don't know...

864
01:04:08,784 --> 01:04:12,240
Yeah, I'm not interested in
your opinion. Just shut it off.

865
01:04:13,424 --> 01:04:16,488
- My friend, don't be a jerk.
- Step aside.

866
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:18,128
If he does that again,
you can shoot him.

867
01:04:18,184 --> 01:04:20,423
You do your job, pencil-neck.
Don't tell me how to do mine.

868
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:23,127
- Thank you, officer.
- Shut it off!

869
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:46,288
Oh, shit.

870
01:05:00,624 --> 01:05:03,284
Clear the building!

871
01:05:31,264 --> 01:05:34,000
This is it. This is the sign.

872
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:37,924
Yeah, it's a sign, all right.
We're going out of business.

873
01:05:47,384 --> 01:05:49,444
Hey, aim up there.

874
01:05:49,784 --> 01:05:51,724
- What happened?
- Storage facility blew.

875
01:05:51,784 --> 01:05:54,324
- He shut off the protection grid.
- Oh, great.

876
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:56,204
- That's bad, isn't it?
- Yeah.

877
01:05:56,265 --> 01:05:58,805
- Where's the Keymaster?
- Shit.

878
01:05:58,904 --> 01:06:01,204
- Who's the Keymaster?
- Oh, come on.

879
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:04,204
Hold it. I want this man arrested.

880
01:06:04,264 --> 01:06:07,688
These men are in criminal violation
of the Environmental Protection Act.

881
01:06:07,744 --> 01:06:10,328
- This explosion is a direct result of it.
- Your mother!

882
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:12,724
Come on, hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

883
01:06:55,184 --> 01:07:01,041
Columbia Building, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry, so let's not dawdle.

884
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:55,124
Hey, guard!

885
01:07:55,184 --> 01:07:57,528
Look, I want to make a phone call.

886
01:07:57,584 --> 01:08:00,081
I just work with these guys.
I mean, I wasn't even there.

887
01:08:00,144 --> 01:08:03,284
The structure of this roof cap is exactly
like the kind of telemetry tracker

888
01:08:03,344 --> 01:08:07,281
that NASA uses to identify
dead pulsars in deep space.

889
01:08:07,344 --> 01:08:13,201
Cold-riveted girders with
cores of pure selenium.

890
01:08:13,304 --> 01:08:15,441
Everybody getting this so far?

891
01:08:15,504 --> 01:08:18,765
So what? I guess they just don't
make them like they used to, huh?

892
01:08:18,824 --> 01:08:21,168
No. Nobody ever
made them like this.

893
01:08:21,225 --> 01:08:25,849
I mean, the architect was either a
certified genius or an authentic wacko.

894
01:08:25,904 --> 01:08:28,968
Ray, for a moment,

895
01:08:29,024 --> 01:08:32,089
pretend that I don't know
anything about metallurgy,

896
01:08:32,144 --> 01:08:37,325
engineering or physics and just
tell me what the hell is going on.

897
01:08:37,504 --> 01:08:39,444
You never studied.

898
01:08:39,904 --> 01:08:43,688
The whole building is a huge
superconductive antenna

899
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,163
that was designed and built
expressly for the purpose

900
01:08:46,224 --> 01:08:49,364
of pulling in and concentrating
spiritual turbulence.

901
01:08:49,424 --> 01:08:54,966
Your girlfriend lives in the
corner penthouse of spook central.

902
01:08:56,304 --> 01:09:00,056
She's not my girlfriend.
I find her interesting because

903
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:02,344
she's a client and because
she sleeps above her covers.

904
01:09:02,384 --> 01:09:06,321
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drools. She claws.

905
01:09:06,384 --> 01:09:08,848
It's not the girl, Peter,
it's the building.

906
01:09:08,904 --> 01:09:10,859
Something terrible is
about to enter our world,

907
01:09:10,884 --> 01:09:14,927
and this building is obviously the door.
The architect's name was Ivo Shandor.

908
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:18,562
I found it in <i>Tobin's Spirit Guide.</i>
He was also a doctor.

909
01:09:18,624 --> 01:09:21,120
He performed a lot of
unnecessary surgery.

910
01:09:21,184 --> 01:09:24,041
And then, in 1920, he
started a secret society.

911
01:09:24,104 --> 01:09:27,844
- Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
- Right.

912
01:09:28,584 --> 01:09:30,120
No studying.

913
01:09:30,184 --> 01:09:35,605
After the first World War, Shandor decided
that society was too sick to survive.

914
01:09:38,864 --> 01:09:42,004
And he wasn't alone. He had close to
a thousand followers when he died.

915
01:09:42,104 --> 01:09:44,044
They conducted rituals
up on the roof,

916
01:09:44,104 --> 01:09:47,604
bizarre rituals intended to bring
about the end of the world.

917
01:09:47,664 --> 01:09:50,641
And now it looks like
it may actually happen.

918
01:09:52,184 --> 01:09:55,084
<i>So be good
For goodness' sake</i>

919
01:09:55,144 --> 01:09:57,040
<i>Whoa, somebody's coming</i>

920
01:09:57,104 --> 01:09:59,764
We have to get out of here. We've
gotta find a judge or something.

921
01:09:59,864 --> 01:10:03,288
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey. Hold it.

922
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:05,520
Are we actually going to go
before a federal judge and say

923
01:10:05,584 --> 01:10:08,801
that some moldy Babylonian god is
gonna drop in on Central Park West

924
01:10:08,864 --> 01:10:11,929
- and start tearing up the city?
- Sumerian, not Babylonian.

925
01:10:11,984 --> 01:10:14,645
- Yeah, big difference.
- No offense,

926
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:16,401
but I gotta get my own lawyer.

927
01:10:16,464 --> 01:10:19,080
Okay, Ghostbusters. The mayor
wants to see you guys.

928
01:10:19,144 --> 01:10:21,085
The whole island's
going crazy. Let's go.

929
01:10:21,264 --> 01:10:24,241
I gotta split. The mayor wants to
rap with me about some things.

930
01:10:47,184 --> 01:10:50,804
- I am the Keymaster.
- I am the Gatekeeper.

931
01:11:31,305 --> 01:11:35,765
- Back. Back. Stay back.
- Stay back. Stay back.

932
01:11:42,784 --> 01:11:45,848
I've got a city blowing up, and you
guys are not giving me any answers.

933
01:11:45,944 --> 01:11:48,889
We're blocking the
bridges, the roads...

934
01:11:48,944 --> 01:11:50,481
The Ghostbusters are
here, Mr. Mayor.

935
01:11:50,544 --> 01:11:53,280
The Ghostbusters.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.

936
01:11:53,344 --> 01:11:54,968
Hey, and where's this Peck?

937
01:11:55,024 --> 01:11:59,049
Peck. I am Walter Peck, sir, and
I'm prepared to make a full report.

938
01:11:59,104 --> 01:12:01,481
These men are consummate
snowball artists.

939
01:12:01,544 --> 01:12:04,324
They use sense and nerve gases
to induce hallucinations.

940
01:12:04,384 --> 01:12:07,688
People think they're seeing ghosts,
and they call these bozos,

941
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:10,164
who conveniently show up
to deal with the problem

942
01:12:10,224 --> 01:12:12,088
with a fake electronic light show.

943
01:12:12,144 --> 01:12:14,968
Everything was fine with our
system until the power grid

944
01:12:15,024 --> 01:12:18,602
- was shut off by dickless here.
- They caused an explosion.

945
01:12:18,664 --> 01:12:23,681
- Is this true?
- Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

946
01:12:25,104 --> 01:12:29,008
Hey, come on. Knock it off.
Hey, break it up!

947
01:12:29,064 --> 01:12:30,927
- All right.
- Well, that's what I heard.

948
01:12:30,984 --> 01:12:32,488
This is City Hall.

949
01:12:32,544 --> 01:12:35,564
Now, what am I gonna do
here, John? What is this?

950
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:38,328
All I know is that was no light
show we saw this morning.

951
01:12:38,384 --> 01:12:42,244
I've seen every form of
combustion known to man,

952
01:12:42,304 --> 01:12:44,200
but this beats the hell out of me.

953
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:46,728
The walls in the 53rd
Precinct were bleeding.

954
01:12:46,784 --> 01:12:49,280
- How do you explain that?
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

955
01:12:49,345 --> 01:12:50,968
Oh, Your Eminence.

956
01:12:56,584 --> 01:12:59,201
- How are you, Lenny?
- You're looking good, Mike.

957
01:12:59,264 --> 01:13:02,808
We're in a real fix here. What
do you think I should do?

958
01:13:02,864 --> 01:13:05,764
Lenny, officially, the church
will not take any position

959
01:13:05,824 --> 01:13:09,160
on the religious implications
of these phenomena.

960
01:13:09,225 --> 01:13:10,761
Personally, Lenny...

961
01:13:11,104 --> 01:13:14,964
I think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.

962
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,783
I think that's a smart move, Mike.

963
01:13:16,784 --> 01:13:18,484
I'm not gonna call
a press conference

964
01:13:18,584 --> 01:13:21,364
and tell everyone to start praying.

965
01:13:23,184 --> 01:13:25,965
I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor.

966
01:13:26,024 --> 01:13:28,401
Look, I've only been with the
company for a couple weeks.

967
01:13:28,464 --> 01:13:31,124
But I gotta tell you,
these things are real.

968
01:13:31,344 --> 01:13:35,128
Since I joined these men, I have
seen shit that'll turn you white.

969
01:13:35,864 --> 01:13:37,520
Well, you can believe Mr. Pecker.

970
01:13:37,584 --> 01:13:40,081
- My name is Peck.
- Or you could accept the fact

971
01:13:40,184 --> 01:13:43,521
that this city is headed for a
disaster of biblical proportions.

972
01:13:43,584 --> 01:13:47,249
- Well, what do you mean, "biblical"?
- What he means is Old Testament.

973
01:13:47,304 --> 01:13:49,441
- Real wrath-of-God-type stuff.
- Exactly.

974
01:13:49,504 --> 01:13:52,885
Fire and brimstone coming down from
the skies. Rivers and seas boiling.

975
01:13:52,944 --> 01:13:55,408
Forty years of darkness.
Earthquakes. Volcanoes.

976
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:56,863
Dead rising from the grave.

977
01:13:56,864 --> 01:13:58,007
Human sacrifice.

978
01:13:58,064 --> 01:14:00,887
Dogs and cats living together.
Mass hysteria.

979
01:14:00,944 --> 01:14:03,124
Enough! I get the point.

980
01:14:04,784 --> 01:14:06,168
But what if you're wrong?

981
01:14:06,224 --> 01:14:09,528
If I'm wrong, nothing happens.
We go to jail, peacefully, quietly.

982
01:14:09,584 --> 01:14:13,040
We'll enjoy it. But if I'm right,

983
01:14:13,104 --> 01:14:16,244
and we can stop this thing...

984
01:14:16,304 --> 01:14:21,604
Lenny, you will have
saved the lives

985
01:14:21,664 --> 01:14:25,840
of millions of registered voters.

986
01:14:30,984 --> 01:14:34,801
I don't believe you're seriously
considering listening to these men.

987
01:14:41,744 --> 01:14:44,241
Get him out of here.

988
01:14:44,304 --> 01:14:46,920
- Bye.
- I'll fix you. I'm gonna fix you.

989
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:49,808
I'm gonna get you a nice fruit
basket. I'm going to miss him.

990
01:14:49,864 --> 01:14:51,324
All right. All right.

991
01:14:51,744 --> 01:14:55,081
We got work to do. Now,
what do you need from me?

992
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:10,320
Come on, let's run some red lights!

993
01:16:10,544 --> 01:16:12,484
Hello, New York.

994
01:16:18,304 --> 01:16:21,040
Hello, everybody!

995
01:16:21,104 --> 01:16:24,408
Dr. Ray Stantz, would you please?
The heart of the Ghostbusters.

996
01:16:24,464 --> 01:16:27,604
Thank you. They love you.
They love you here.

997
01:16:28,064 --> 01:16:32,525
- I like that shirt, friend.
- Ghostbusters! All right!

998
01:16:34,984 --> 01:16:38,081
Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost.

999
01:16:38,144 --> 01:16:40,880
Okay, whatever happens,
let's be professional.

1000
01:17:11,184 --> 01:17:14,161
We might have to put a little
overtime in on this one.

1001
01:18:06,784 --> 01:18:09,848
There they are. There they are.

1002
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:18,928
I was in no way prepared for that.

1003
01:18:19,664 --> 01:18:22,641
It's all right. Don't worry.
We're fine. We can handle it.

1004
01:18:22,704 --> 01:18:25,048
We can take it. They
want to play rough.

1005
01:18:25,104 --> 01:18:29,521
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1006
01:18:31,064 --> 01:18:32,688
- Wanna play rough?
- Yeah.

1007
01:18:32,745 --> 01:18:34,521
Let's do it.

1008
01:18:58,424 --> 01:19:00,484
Where are we?

1009
01:19:00,544 --> 01:19:04,568
It looks like we're in
the teens somewhere.

1010
01:19:04,664 --> 01:19:08,841
Well, when we get to 20,
tell me. I'm gonna throw up.

1011
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:43,561
- Twenty-two. Is this it?
- Yep.

1012
01:19:51,984 --> 01:19:54,645
Art deco. Very nice.

1013
01:19:54,704 --> 01:19:57,561
- Where is it?
- It's at the end of the hall.

1014
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:38,880
Hey, where do these stairs go?

1015
01:20:41,224 --> 01:20:42,925
They go up.

1016
01:20:47,344 --> 01:20:49,928
Okay, go ahead. Come on. Go ahead.

1017
01:20:50,864 --> 01:20:52,880
Watch it. Go ahead.

1018
01:21:30,464 --> 01:21:31,881
Dana.

1019
01:21:45,544 --> 01:21:49,481
Okay, so she's a dog.

1020
01:22:27,224 --> 01:22:28,968
It's a girl.

1021
01:22:34,024 --> 01:22:36,400
- It's Gozer.
- I thought Gozer was a man.

1022
01:22:36,464 --> 01:22:40,248
- It's whatever it wants to be.
- Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.

1023
01:22:40,304 --> 01:22:41,840
Right.

1024
01:22:42,384 --> 01:22:44,400
Go get her, Ray!

1025
01:22:56,144 --> 01:22:58,324
Gozer the Gozerian?

1026
01:23:00,464 --> 01:23:05,448
Good evening. As a duly designated
representative of the city,

1027
01:23:05,504 --> 01:23:07,248
county and state of New York,

1028
01:23:07,305 --> 01:23:09,801
I order you to cease any and
all supernatural activity

1029
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:11,760
and return forthwith to
your place of origin

1030
01:23:11,864 --> 01:23:14,644
or to the nearest convenient
parallel dimension.

1031
01:23:14,744 --> 01:23:17,360
That ought to do it.
Thanks very much, Ray.

1032
01:23:17,424 --> 01:23:20,008
Are you a god?

1033
01:23:26,144 --> 01:23:31,445
- No.
- Then die!

1034
01:23:54,224 --> 01:24:00,201
Ray, when someone asks you if
you're a god, you say, "yes".

1035
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:05,369
All right. This chick is toast.

1036
01:24:17,064 --> 01:24:19,561
- Got your stick?
- Holding it.

1037
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:22,928
Heat them up!

1038
01:24:23,264 --> 01:24:24,724
Smoking!

1039
01:24:25,264 --> 01:24:28,087
- Make them hard.
- Ready!

1040
01:24:28,144 --> 01:24:31,361
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

1041
01:24:33,744 --> 01:24:35,248
Throw it!

1042
01:24:43,664 --> 01:24:47,449
- Nimble little minx, isn't she?
- We better go full stream.

1043
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:49,804
Aim for the flattop.

1044
01:24:59,104 --> 01:25:00,880
Wasn't so hard.

1045
01:25:06,864 --> 01:25:08,401
We neutronized it.

1046
01:25:08,464 --> 01:25:11,080
You know what that means?
A complete particle reversal.

1047
01:25:11,145 --> 01:25:13,968
And we had the tools.
We had the talent.

1048
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:16,324
It's Miller time.

1049
01:25:16,384 --> 01:25:20,964
- Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad.
- Oh, no.

1050
01:25:21,025 --> 01:25:22,561
What?

1051
01:25:31,624 --> 01:25:33,367
Look out!

1052
01:25:55,064 --> 01:26:00,888
Sub-creatures. Gozer the
Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor,

1053
01:26:00,944 --> 01:26:05,481
Volguus Zildrohar the
Traveler has come.

1054
01:26:05,544 --> 01:26:08,401
Choose and perish.

1055
01:26:08,504 --> 01:26:11,928
What do you mean, "choose"?
We don't understand.

1056
01:26:11,984 --> 01:26:17,526
Choose. Choose the form
of the Destructor.

1057
01:26:17,624 --> 01:26:22,129
Oh, I get it. I get it.
Oh, very cute.

1058
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:25,368
Whatever we think of. If we
think of J. Edgar Hoover,

1059
01:26:25,424 --> 01:26:28,685
J. Edgar Hoover will appear and
destroy us, so empty your heads.

1060
01:26:28,744 --> 01:26:31,601
Don't think of anything. We've
only got one shot at this.

1061
01:26:31,664 --> 01:26:35,448
- The choice is made.
- Whoa!

1062
01:26:35,504 --> 01:26:37,760
The Traveler has come.

1063
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:39,929
Nobody choosed anything.

1064
01:26:39,984 --> 01:26:41,488
- Did you choose anything?
- No.

1065
01:26:41,544 --> 01:26:42,983
- Did you?
- My mind is totally blank.

1066
01:26:42,984 --> 01:26:45,361
I didn't choose anything!

1067
01:26:54,504 --> 01:26:56,400
I couldn't help it.

1068
01:26:57,264 --> 01:26:59,444
It just popped in there.

1069
01:26:59,984 --> 01:27:03,528
What? What just popped in there?

1070
01:27:03,584 --> 01:27:06,441
- I tried to think...
- Look!

1071
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,805
- No! It can't be.
- What is it?

1072
01:27:09,864 --> 01:27:11,608
- It can't be.
- What did you do, Ray?

1073
01:27:11,664 --> 01:27:13,801
Oh, shit.

1074
01:27:24,144 --> 01:27:26,248
It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1075
01:27:56,464 --> 01:27:58,480
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1076
01:27:58,544 --> 01:28:00,408
I tried to think of the
most harmless thing.

1077
01:28:00,464 --> 01:28:02,480
Something I loved
from my childhood.

1078
01:28:02,544 --> 01:28:07,289
Something that could never, ever
possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

1079
01:28:07,344 --> 01:28:09,360
Nice thinking, Ray.

1080
01:28:10,224 --> 01:28:12,240
We used to roast Stay
Puft marshmallows

1081
01:28:12,304 --> 01:28:14,168
by the fire at Camp Waconda.

1082
01:28:15,784 --> 01:28:19,928
Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got left?

1083
01:28:20,144 --> 01:28:25,205
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rational thought.

1084
01:28:34,704 --> 01:28:37,681
- Oh, no.
- Mother pus bucket.

1085
01:28:42,144 --> 01:28:44,685
Nobody steps on a
church in my town.

1086
01:28:44,744 --> 01:28:47,688
One, two, three, roast him.

1087
01:29:06,584 --> 01:29:08,241
Funny, us going out like this.

1088
01:29:08,304 --> 01:29:10,648
Killed by a 100-foot
marshmallow man.

1089
01:29:10,704 --> 01:29:13,870
We've been going about this all wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is okay. He's a sailor.

1090
01:29:13,904 --> 01:29:17,688
He's in New York. We get this guy
laid, we won't have any trouble.

1091
01:29:21,344 --> 01:29:24,364
I have a radical idea. The
door swings both ways.

1092
01:29:24,424 --> 01:29:26,921
We could reverse the particle
flow through the gate.

1093
01:29:26,984 --> 01:29:28,847
How?

1094
01:29:28,904 --> 01:29:31,128
- We'll cross the streams.
- Excuse me, Egon.

1095
01:29:31,184 --> 01:29:33,004
You said crossing the
streams was bad.

1096
01:29:33,064 --> 01:29:36,161
- Cross the streams.
- You're gonna endanger us.

1097
01:29:36,224 --> 01:29:38,001
You're gonna endanger our client,

1098
01:29:38,064 --> 01:29:41,041
the nice lady who paid us in
advance before she became a dog.

1099
01:29:41,144 --> 01:29:45,168
Not necessarily. There's definitely
a very slim chance we'll survive.

1100
01:29:50,544 --> 01:29:54,241
I love this plan. I'm excited to
be a part of it. Let's do it.

1101
01:29:54,304 --> 01:29:57,969
This job is definitely not
worth 11,500 a year.

1102
01:30:01,345 --> 01:30:02,881
Hurry.

1103
01:30:04,664 --> 01:30:07,040
See you on the other side, Ray.

1104
01:30:09,104 --> 01:30:11,765
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.

1105
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,365
Let's turn them on, Spengler!

1106
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:26,641
Now, Spengler!

1107
01:30:31,624 --> 01:30:33,520
Get out of here!

1108
01:31:24,424 --> 01:31:26,724
- Winston.
- Yeah.

1109
01:31:26,785 --> 01:31:28,561
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1110
01:31:33,464 --> 01:31:34,968
Venkman?

1111
01:31:35,024 --> 01:31:36,408
Spengler!

1112
01:31:37,264 --> 01:31:38,800
Venkman!

1113
01:31:41,904 --> 01:31:43,440
Spengler.

1114
01:31:44,704 --> 01:31:47,528
Oh, Spengler. Oh, are you okay?

1115
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,688
I feel like the floor of a taxicab.

1116
01:31:49,784 --> 01:31:51,921
- Venky!
- Yeah, where are you?

1117
01:31:51,984 --> 01:31:54,328
Oh, thank God.

1118
01:31:55,305 --> 01:31:57,048
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

1119
01:31:57,104 --> 01:31:58,607
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

1120
01:31:58,664 --> 01:32:00,964
- You all right?
- Yeah. You okay?

1121
01:32:01,024 --> 01:32:02,561
Fine.

1122
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:13,368
Oh, it smells like
barbecued dog hair.

1123
01:32:13,744 --> 01:32:15,727
Oh, Venkman.

1124
01:32:15,784 --> 01:32:18,008
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1125
01:32:18,584 --> 01:32:21,484
I'm sorry. I just... I just forgot.

1126
01:32:35,184 --> 01:32:36,808
Look!

1127
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:05,525
Somebody turn on the lights!

1128
01:33:05,584 --> 01:33:08,681
- Help! Somebody!
- Go check on that little guy.

1129
01:33:13,864 --> 01:33:15,805
What happened?

1130
01:33:22,064 --> 01:33:26,328
Oh. Oh. Where am I?

1131
01:33:27,984 --> 01:33:31,081
Oh, hi.

1132
01:33:31,344 --> 01:33:33,207
You'll be all right.

1133
01:33:33,584 --> 01:33:37,041
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

1134
01:33:38,384 --> 01:33:40,324
Are you okay?

1135
01:33:40,864 --> 01:33:42,760
Who are you guys?

1136
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:44,885
We're the Ghostbusters.

1137
01:33:47,504 --> 01:33:48,963
Who does your taxes?

1138
01:33:49,584 --> 01:33:52,681
You know, Mr. Tully, you are
a most fortunate individual.

1139
01:33:52,744 --> 01:33:55,044
- I know.
- You have been a participant in

1140
01:33:55,104 --> 01:33:58,648
the biggest interdimensional cross rip
since the Tunguska blast of 1909.

1141
01:33:58,704 --> 01:34:00,884
- Felt great.
- We'd like to get a sample

1142
01:34:00,944 --> 01:34:03,801
- of your brain tissue.
- Okay.

1143
01:34:06,624 --> 01:34:09,328
I love this town!
