Hey, Karuppa, no!

1242
01:47:25,420 --> 01:47:28,295
Hi Charlie, welcome to my home!

1243
01:47:42,086 --> 01:47:45,670
These are Karuppa's medals
from various dog shows.

- Dharma right?
- Yes.

1245
01:47:48,586 --> 01:47:51,295
Do you want to eat now?
Or do you want to freshen up first?

1246
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:53,795
I think I'll freshen up.

1247
01:47:58,670 --> 01:48:03,086
So you've set off to see the snow...

1248

it hurts. Isn't it Karuppa?

I haven't told you about it yet!

Her name is Rani.
Our's is first sight at love!

1253
01:48:28,711 --> 01:48:29,871
But our parents didn't agree.

1254
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:33,628
So we eloped and settled down here.

1255
01:48:34,003 --> 01:48:39,711
She worked at a bank near by.
We were so happy!

1256
01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:44,628
We led a wonderful life.
But we couldn't have kids.

1257
01:48:44,878 --> 01:48:46,503
We consulted many doctors.

1258
01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:49,545
They told us we could never have kids.

1259
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:52,670
The problem was with me.

1260
01:48:56,503 --> 01:49:00,670
After that, I went into depression.

1261
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:08,003
Then one day,
my wife gave me a wonderful gift!

1262

My life transformed after he came.

1265
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:29,170
Then Rani gave me another big surprise.

1266
01:49:30,045 --> 01:49:32,545
There was a letter on the table.
But I didn't open it.

1267
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:37,062

Aye, it's ok.

tolerated two fools like us!

She left

1274
01:49:59,795 --> 01:50:06,211
Karuppu, I hope you never leave me.
Should you even think about it, I'll kill you!
