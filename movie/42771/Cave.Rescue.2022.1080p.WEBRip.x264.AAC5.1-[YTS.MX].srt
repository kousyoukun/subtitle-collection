3
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,082
Go, go.

4
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,168
Alright, let's go, guys.

5
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:31,957
Hey, hey.

6
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,292
Can you check again?

7
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,711
Yeah, sure.

8
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,379
I'll go check for you.

9
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,206
Oh, no.

10
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,346
Hey, Chief!

11
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,932
We're in trouble!

12
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,433
Chief!

13
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,445
Adul.

14
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,864
Take his hand, will you?

15
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,167
I want to go home.

16
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,504
We have to find higher ground
to escape the water.

17
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,820
This way, sir.

18
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,036
Nothing we can do tonight.

19
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,080
They have to stay in the cave...

20
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,164
for now.

21
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,251
I'm sure the coach
will take care of the boys

22
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,239
I can't hold my breath long enough.

23
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,657
It's too far.

24
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,039
There's no way we're getting out.
I'm scared.

25
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,418
Don't worry, okay?
Someone is going to find us.

26
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,754
No one is going to...

27
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,300
Don't lose hope just yet, guys.

28
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,761
Of course, someone will find us.

29
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,154
Good morning. One iced coffee, please.

30
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,448
Did you hear about the boys?

31
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,699
What boys?

32
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,618
The 12 boys that got stuck in the cave.

33
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,704
The Wild Boars Football Academy.
They haven't come out yet.

34
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,791
- How did you know about that?
- Everyone is talking about it.

35
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,048
Today, I'm calling upon all of you.

36
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,926
If you can help,
wait outside of your house.

37
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,137
We will go help the rescuers
at Tham Luang cave.

38
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,154
Stay home, Granny has to go now, okay?

39
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:41,290
Please, goddess Nang Non,
help the kids come out of the cave.

40
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,013
Don't worry.

41
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,640
- He should be able to help.
- Yes.

42
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,231
Here, sir.

43
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,027
Where is he?

44
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,363
Over there, sir.

45
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,902
- Welcome.
- Good morning.

46
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,658
This way, please.

47
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:29,972
Hello. Yes, I'm back.

48
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,223
I know.

49
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:35,853
They haven't come out yet?

50
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,287
Excuse me.

51
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:57,457
This is Mr. Tan Xiaolong from Peaceland
Foundation, sir.

52
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,376
Hello.

53
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:05,883
Do you have a map of the cave complex?

54
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,259
I'm sorry, we don't have that.

55
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,427
It's confidential.

56
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:13,223
If he's a foreigner, I think you should go
to that tent over there.

57
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:37,080
And I also teach how to use rebreathers

58
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,213
I'm sure everyone in the country...

59
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,714
is closely following this story...

60
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,592
about the disappearance
of the Wild Boars football team.

61
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,387
{\an8}- There're so many obstacles...
- Yes, it's raining constantly.

62
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,973
So the water level became very high...

63
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,271
{\an8}Down a bit more.

64
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,031
Yes it's Pooyai Tun, Baan Laem.

65
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,618
Oh, Professor Adisorn?

66
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,329
The boys stuck in Tham Luang cave.

67
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,705
Yes, I saw the news.

68
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,250
It's really sad.

69
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,919
Yes, our PVC Turbojet pumps?

70
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,128
But I already sold them all.

71
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,423
Let me think. I don't know...

72
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,676
if I have any left,
or can borrow from anyone.

73
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,052
I'll go check now.

74
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,308
Coach, why is the water coming up so high?

75
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,520
You said it would go down.

76
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,401
The water has to rise up first
before it goes down.

77
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,280
We should turn the torch off.
Save the batteries.

78
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,872
Oh, right on time. Come, come.

79
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,833
Let's put the pump on the truck.

80
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,253
Can we get two on each side?

81
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,005
Alright, hurry.

82
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,507
Fantastic.

83
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,134
That's it.

84
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,892
Mai, help them lift it into the truck.

85
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,727
The boys have been in there
for too long already.

86
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,645
Yes, that's it.

87
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,147
Yes, Pooyai Tun.

88
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,193
Councilor, the pumps that you
ordered from me...

89
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,736
for the 9,000 rai flooded rice fields.

90
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,113
Do they still work well?

91
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,740
Yes, they still work well.

92
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:08,871
This is a Thai Navy SEALS operation.

93
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,123
We can't let the foreign divers in.

94
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,174
Please excuse me.

95
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,135
The water has risen too much.

96
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,763
I cannot take responsibility
for your safety.

97
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:40,235
Princess Nang Non and the stable boy
were in love with each other.

98
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,404
But her father, the king, was very angry.

99
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,740
So he ordered his soldiers to kill him.

100
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:49,411
How sad for Nang Non.

101
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:53,207
Did she really stab herself
with her hairpin?

102
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,126
This water is her blood.

103
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:00,422
Right when she stabbed herself...

104
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,966
the blood wouldn't stop.

105
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,093
Then became the water in here.

106
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,304
Guys.

107
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,805
Before we entered...

108
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,266
Did anyone remember to pay respect to her?

109
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,357
It's just a legend. Don't think too much.

110
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,362
{\an8}I'm sorry.

111
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,572
Please let me go home.

112
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,058
Good morning.

113
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,017
Where are you from?

114
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:56,311
Professor Adisorn contacted me

115
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:59,857
to bring my PVC Turbojet pumps
to help the kids.

116
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,149
Okay, okay.

117
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,318
I can't let in vehicles without a permit.

118
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:04,778
You have to park outside.

119
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:07,281
- Could you help me to get in, please?
- Alright, back up, sir.

120
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,665
I brought water pumps. Who do I talk to?

121
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,255
- ...they can't be used.
- But they came with the truck.

122
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:26,049
- The lines are just not long enough...
- Good morning, sir.

123
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,177
Hold on. Can I help you?

124
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,262
I came all the way
from Baan Laem, Petchaburi.

125
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,514
We manufacture Turbojet pumps
and sell them all over the world.

126
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,600
- You mean water pumps?
- Yes, Turbojet.

127
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:35,976
I really want to help the boys.

128
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,394
Do you have a permit?

129
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:39,479
No, not yet.
I don't know who to contact.

130
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,606
Okay, listen.

131
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,274
First, you have to get a permit

132
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,402
at the Department of Disaster Prevention
or the Provincial Administration Office

133
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:49,031
so you can be involved
in this mission, sir.

134
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:49,990
Could someone take me there?

135
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,367
Sorry, I have to take this call.

136
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:53,452
Hello, sir?

137
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,998
Lottery tickets, anyone?

138
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,459
Pooyai Tun? Are you Pooyai Tun?

139
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,711
- Yes, that's me.
- Hello, I'm Professor Adisorn, sir.

140
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:03,837
So good to finally meet you.

141
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:06,965
I've spoken to everyone.
They won't let us in.

142
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,592
There are a lot of procedures.

143
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,177
I talked to them about the water pumps.

144
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,428
Can you wait for a bit?

145
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,555
No one will give us a badge.
Do you have one?

146
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,098
Here. Take mine first.

147
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,601
- Thank you so much.
- Yes. I will see you up there.

148
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,103
- I'm coordinating with the higher-ups.
- Okay, that's great.

149
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,063
Do you have any number 13s?

150
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,148
No, they're all gone. I only have 9s.

151
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:24,983
Ok, I'll take one.

152
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:05,566
Here, some water.

153
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:08,694
I have a badge.

154
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,377
Hey, Mai.

155
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,671
{\an8}With these small size pumps the cave
will never be dry.

156
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,132
{\an8}Yes, Pooyai. If it comes out like this,
it will never be dry.

157
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:34,761
We can put our pump right there.

158
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:37,890
Professor, you need to understand me.

159
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:41,560
If the documents are incomplete
someone has to be responsible.

160
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:42,978
Please listen to me, sir.

161
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:46,481
The pumps you're using right now
are not sufficient, sir.

162
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:50,861
I've brought the best person
in the country to you.

163
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,739
If you give Pooyai's water pumps a try

164
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:56,617
and if they don't work,
I'll take them all back, sir.

165
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,536
Then why don't you take your smartass
back to your hometown.

166
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:09,379
We manufacture PVC Turbojet water pumps
that are lightweight but very powerful.

167
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:10,797
I really want to help the kids
in the cave...

168
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:13,425
Have you tried contacting the governor?

169
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,844
No, not yet. I don't know where to go.

170
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,471
At the Provincial City Hall, sir.

171
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:19,223
How do I get there?
I have no idea where to go.

172
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,064
So you've been in the cave
and you are one million percent confident?

173
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,357
{\an8}- Yes, a million percent.
- How so?

174
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:30,776
{\an8}We have to set up the Turbojet pumps.

175
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,903
{\an8}To drain the water as fast as we can.

176
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,822
{\an8}So we can reach the inner chambers.

177
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,325
{\an8}So what's your take on the current set up?

178
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,160
{\an8}To be honest it's like a child peeing...

179
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:54,967
Is it true that you're the reincarnation
of the stable boy?

180
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,803
Fifty-fifty.

181
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:01,723
Do you think you'll be able
to help all the kids?

182
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,559
Let me take a look first.

183
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,022
Professor Adisorn

184
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,191
Professor Adisorn is calling again.

185
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,525
You're not going to answer it?

186
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,954
Lek, I cannot contact Pooyai at all.

187
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,873
He doesn't answer his phone.

188
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:16,507
Who is it?

189
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,967
Pooyai, can you come back, please?

190
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,136
Please come back to help my nephew.

191
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:22,346
I'm begging you.

192
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,057
How do we know
if they are going to let us in?

193
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:27,726
I'm going to find a way to talk to them.

194
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:32,272
I do not want my nephew to die.

195
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:33,941
Okay...

196
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:36,944
Well, we'll see.

197
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,070
Please.

198
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:44,868
We did it, Lek.

199
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:46,745
We did it.

200
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:07,850
Dear goddess Nang Non,
please help me save the kids.

201
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,427
I'm hungry.

202
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:44,970
Very hungry.

203
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:48,348
Coach, what can I eat?

204
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:53,687
Hey.

205
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,314
Did you hear a chicken?

206
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:00,611
There are no chickens in caves, silly.

207
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,821
What are you going to eat, when we're out?

208
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,364
My mom's pork larb.

209
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:05,699
Auntie Lek's papaya salad.

210
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,409
KFC.

211
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:10,078
Of course, chicken as always.

212
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:11,830
Breast or drumstick?

213
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:13,707
- Drumstick.
- Breast.

214
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,791
Drumstick.

215
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:16,460
Coach.

216
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,587
Can you take us to KFC again?

217
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,891
So, I've talked to every department.

218
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:32,643
They haven't given approval.

219
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,646
There's no way those small pumps
can drain the cave.

220
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:38,273
I've tried everything, Pooyai.

221
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:42,236
I'll gather all the relatives
to petition the governor!

222
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,947
So Pooyai Tun can bring his pumps
to help the kids.

223
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,031
Lek, calm down.

224
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:47,115
We have to wait.

225
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,784
We don't have a solution.

226
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,118
What can I do?

227
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:51,662
We'll have to wait.

228
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,082
Hello, Councilor Neng?

229
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,377
We've got 10 of your pumps
ready to deliver.

230
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,964
But they have not approved us, councilor.

231
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:04,091
A friend of mine
works for the Royal Foundation.

232
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,759
He is going to let us borrow their truck.

233
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:07,928
That's brilliant.

234
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:27,906
Pooyai!

235
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,618
You're amazing.

236
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:32,578
I'm so happy.

237
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,915
Hey, be careful, guys.

238
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,417
Bring it inside.

239
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:39,459
Be careful.

240
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,503
Steady, be careful.

241
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:46,925
Slowly.

242
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:55,517
This way, this way.

243
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,561
Electrician, please turn on the switch!

244
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,440
Mai, are the pumps
in chamber three set up yet?

245
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:27,900
Yes, they are.

246
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,070
We are running two at the same time.

247
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,446
We can see the tunnel entrance now.

248
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,532
The British divers are suiting up.

249
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,701
Great. Can you take me to the tent?

250
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,952
I can't walk properly.

251
00:34:58,765 --> 00:34:59,766
Coach.

252
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:01,268
Coach.

253
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:07,566
What is it?

254
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,067
I'm thirsty.

255
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,737
Come. I'll take you.

256
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,572
Careful.

257
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,077
Slowly, be careful.

258
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:35,844
Walk slowly, don't rush.

259
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:44,478
Hey, what's that sound?

260
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,063
What sound?

261
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:47,272
I don't hear anything.

262
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:49,024
You really didn't hear it?

263
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,859
Hey, quiet!

264
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:56,300
The 12 boys
of the Wild Boars football team

265
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:59,344
and their coach have now been found alive.

266
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,346
Nom Sao Slope,
where the kids were found...

267
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,016
is three km away from the cave entrance.

268
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:05,267
Nong.

269
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,393
Nong.

270
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:09,021
They've found the boys.

271
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:11,773
This good news is like a miracle.

272
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:27,247
Option two, they can pump the water
out of the cave as much as they can.

273
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:31,710
But this method could take four months
until the monsoon season is over.

274
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,648
{\an8}- Good afternoon, Chief.
- Good afternoon.

275
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:55,192
Mae Bua, please sign here.

276
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:57,152
Fill in your account number.

277
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:03,242
Your total is 13,169 baht.

278
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:05,827
You will receive it within two months.

279
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,288
I won't take it, Chief.

280
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,040
Please take it, Mae Bua.

281
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,166
You've sacrificed so much.

282
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,876
It's really not a big deal.

283
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,461
Isn't that right, everyone?

284
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,632
Our rice crops might be ruined

285
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,926
but we can always replant them, Chief.

286
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:22,803
But the trapped boys...

287
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:25,055
I just want them to get out alive.

288
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:28,350
This is the government's money
for helping the boys.

289
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,019
There's no way I would take it, right?

290
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,604
I won't take it, sir.

291
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:33,772
Me neither.

292
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,107
Me too.

293
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:09,683
Smile, handsome.

294
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:11,518
Show me two fingers.

295
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,187
Excellent.

296
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:36,668
{\an8}This is not something that ordinary
recreational divers can comprehend,

297
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:42,424
{\an8}It is extremely complex and requires
specialized equipment

298
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:45,677
{\an8}and very specialized training

299
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:48,430
I'm not very optimistic...

300
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:58,190
{\an8}...here to support the divers
in the rescue mission.

301
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:01,735
May good luck be with us.

302
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:04,029
Let's bring those boys home.

303
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:56,707
Excuse me, sir.

304
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:58,041
I'm ready.

305
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:00,127
Have you got a buddy yet?

306
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:01,086
Not yet.

307
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,380
Let me speak to the chief.

308
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:04,840
Go wait over there.

309
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,720
Sir.

310
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:10,804
What's up?

311
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,848
Saman is free and wants to come with us.

312
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:16,518
Sure.

313
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:20,230
You and Sam can take oxygen tanks
to chamber four.

314
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:21,190
Alright.

315
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:22,149
Good luck.

316
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:25,944
He approved.

317
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,779
We are the second ones to dive.

318
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:42,794
Hand them down.

319
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:50,802
Sergeant Sam, Sergeant Dum.

320
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:51,970
Good luck.

321
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:56,285
Sam.

322
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,829
Give me the tanks. I'll do it.

323
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:05,460
You can start heading back.

324
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:08,255
Do you have enough air left?

325
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:11,425
Yes, I do.

326
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:12,384
Okay?

327
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,886
Yes, sir.

328
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:48,063
Sergeant Dum, that's enough...

329
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:49,398
Sergeant Sam has already done his best.

330
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:52,150
Sergeant Dum, calm down.

331
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:53,485
Bring the stretcher.

332
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:03,036
Calm down.

333
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:07,958
Give me a hand.

334
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:12,838
One, two, up...

335
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:56,507
{\an8}Going in was fine but on the way back...

336
00:45:56,882 --> 00:45:59,301
As for the deceased...

337
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:02,638
his name was Sergeant Saman Kunan

338
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:07,142
We are trained to work

339
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:09,937
in risky conditions at all times.

340
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:13,190
Even if we lose a team member

341
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:17,819
it's something that we
have to face all the time.

342
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:22,199
We will not lose courage.

343
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,701
Our team will stay strong.

344
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,496
For our brothers and sisters

345
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:30,082
who sacrifice their lives for us

346
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,876
we will not let their deaths be in vain.

347
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:19,131
The governor is coming.

348
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:29,224
By all accounts, civilian cave divers

349
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,727
are the ones with the experience

350
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:34,271
needed for this type of circumstance.

351
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:37,649
It seems that the Thai military are

352
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:40,527
working with the Americans
and British divers

353
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:43,447
to rescue the 12 boys and their coach.

354
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:45,407
From the third chamber
to the cave's entrance

355
00:47:45,574 --> 00:47:46,909
our people will be in charge.

356
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:49,995
Beyond the third chamber
to where the kids are

357
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:52,080
the foreign teams will be in charge.

358
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:56,210
Right now, we have four Thai Navy SEALs
and a doctor with the kids.

359
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:09,014
The U.S. diver came to say goodbye
and told me he'd been transferred.

360
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:11,600
Will you still have the chance to go in?

361
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:14,770
I don't have a dive buddy right now.

362
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:16,980
I'm not sure what's going to happen.

363
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:01,525
Coach.

364
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,985
Who would you suggest to leave first?

365
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:05,112
Nick,

366
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:06,446
Note,

367
00:49:07,155 --> 00:49:08,156
Tle,

368
00:49:08,824 --> 00:49:10,117
and Mark, sir.

369
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:12,786
They all live the farthest.

370
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:15,956
They have to ride their bikes very far.

371
00:52:32,277 --> 00:52:34,029
At 10:00 AM this morning,

372
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:38,116
rescuers, cave divers
and cave specialists...

373
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:39,826
13 people in total...

374
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:41,578
{\an8}have entered the cave...

375
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:43,914
to carry out the extraction of the kids.

376
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:40,906
These two British divers
are going inside today.

377
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:12,604
First one...

378
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:15,858
Jim Warny,

379
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:19,319
10:00 AM.

380
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:22,322
Connor.

381
00:59:09,466 --> 00:59:10,467
Mae Bua!

382
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:12,386
The Wild Boars are coming out!

383
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:19,476
They're coming out.

384
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:28,277
We have successfully rescued two
of the boys from the cave.

385
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,153
The rescue mission is in full swing.

386
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:31,238
Here we are.

387
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:34,283
What we see here are the ambulances
carrying the boys out.

388
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:36,827
The rescue started
at 10:00 AM this morning.

389
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,341
...but I can guarantee that we have
rescued four Wild Boars already.

390
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:41,183
I must apologize for not answering
all the questions...

391
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:02,431
Today, we're offering oblation
to the goddess Nang Non.

392
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:07,519
We pray for the 13 kids
trapped in the cave to come out safely.

393
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:14,423
We have just received confirmation that

394
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:18,302
a fifth boy
has been rescued from the cave.

395
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:23,337
Coach. We're out safe already.

396
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:34,588
Lift him in.

397
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,681
Wait a moment, not yet.

398
01:27:49,102 --> 01:27:50,145
Take it easy.

399
01:27:50,938 --> 01:27:51,855
Keep your hands down, okay?

400
01:27:51,939 --> 01:27:53,106
Stay still, please.

401
01:27:53,357 --> 01:27:55,400
I'm going to take the blindfold off.

402
01:27:55,526 --> 01:27:56,944
Then you can slowly open your eyes.

403
01:27:57,569 --> 01:27:58,862
Slowly now.

404
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:01,323
Very slowly.

405
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:05,160
Slowly.

406
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:06,578
Open them slowly.

407
01:28:13,544 --> 01:28:14,628
Give me the pillow.

408
01:28:25,722 --> 01:28:27,307
Stay lying down.

409
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:28,725
No need to worry.

410
01:28:28,934 --> 01:28:30,143
You're safe now.

411
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:39,528
Do you remember your friends' names?

412
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:41,488
You remember anything?

413
01:28:42,656 --> 01:28:44,032
Remember anyone?

414
01:28:45,868 --> 01:28:47,452
Ti... Ti...

415
01:28:47,578 --> 01:28:48,787
- Titan.
- Titan, right?

416
01:28:48,912 --> 01:28:49,913
Everyone is safe now.

417
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:51,540
No need to worry, alright?

418
01:28:58,839 --> 01:29:00,674
Stay still, please.

419
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:02,050
Everyone is safe.

420
01:29:02,301 --> 01:29:03,719
Everyone is safe now.

421
01:29:04,052 --> 01:29:05,304
Don't worry.

422
01:29:05,888 --> 01:29:07,806
We're helping everyone out.

423
01:29:08,807 --> 01:29:09,892
Relax.

424
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:12,060
You'll see them all soon.

425
01:29:13,729 --> 01:29:14,771
Everybody is safe.

426
01:29:15,564 --> 01:29:16,899
Prepare 10ml of oxygen...

427
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:19,985
Relax.

428
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:21,069
Breathe slowly.

429
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:22,654
Breathe slowly.

430
01:29:22,946 --> 01:29:24,406
Breathe in deeply.

431
01:33:02,416 --> 01:33:04,501
Thank you very much.

432
01:33:05,752 --> 01:33:06,920
Thank you so much.

433
01:33:33,113 --> 01:33:34,865
We've accomplished something

434
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:37,826
that no one expected we could do

435
01:33:38,035 --> 01:33:39,828
for the first time in the world...

436
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,247
we succeeded.

437
01:33:43,832 --> 01:33:44,708
So happy.

438
01:35:40,824 --> 01:35:42,659
{\an8}One of the relatives from Petchaburi...

439
01:35:43,452 --> 01:35:45,370
{\an8}she was crying.

440
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:47,748
{\an8}She was crying...

441
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:52,336
{\an8}So...

442
01:35:52,794 --> 01:35:54,671
{\an8}She was crying. Wanted you to go back?

443
01:35:54,796 --> 01:35:55,923
{\an8}To go and help...

444
01:35:56,423 --> 01:35:58,842
{\an8}She believed in me...
