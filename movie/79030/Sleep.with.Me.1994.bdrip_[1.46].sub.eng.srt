1
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:39,959
Frank, why don't you admit
that you're lying about this?

2
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:42,485
- Why would I lie about this?
- So then you would lie.

3
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,656
I didn't say I would lie.

4
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:45,666
You just said,
"Why would I lie about this?"

5
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,032
From which it can be inferred
that there are things...

6
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,163
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

7
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:53,503
Let's assume that somewhere,
some time in my life...

8
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,441
I have told a lie, OK?

9
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:58,070
Does that mean I'm lying now?

10
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,945
All right, so let me
just get this straight.

11
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:02,347
By all means. Just...

12
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:05,875
You're telling me
that your mother...

13
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,320
had sexual intercourse
with Frank Sinatra,

14
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:09,755
and that's why
you're named Frank?

15
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,984
That's right.

16
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:17,697
- Uh-huh.
- What?

17
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:19,029
And your father?

18
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:20,966
He never slept with Sinatra.
It was just my mother.

19
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:23,493
Does your father
know about this?

20
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:26,233
He's the one who told me.
I think he knows.

21
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:30,403
I can always tell
when you're bullshitting.

22
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:32,878
No, you can't. That's why
I always beat you in poker.

23
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:34,073
You never beat me in poker.

24
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:35,412
- He always does.
- He doesn't.

25
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,612
He always beats you and
you come home all pissed off.

26
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:40,051
Does he?

27
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:42,419
Don't be jumping into this.
He doesn't need your help.

28
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,789
- He comes home crying to mommy.
- You do, sweetie!

29
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,156
Why does this happen to me?

30
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:50,891
You're always teaming up
with him.

31
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:52,694
You're supposed to be
on my side.

32
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:56,533
But then I would always
be wrong, too.

33
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,731
You don't even know
what we're talking about here.

34
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:01,003
Frank was named after
Frank Sinatra.

35
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,669
- That's right.
- Yeah.

36
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,405
You mean, you didn't know that?

37
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:10,081
Did I ever tell you
what my middle name was, Joe?

38
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:12,483
Let me guess: Sammy, right?

39
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,647
Your mom did the wild thing
with the Candy Man, too?

40
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:17,486
That's amazing.
It's Franklin Samuel.

41
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,358
You guys are really funny.

42
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,623
Hey.

43
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,723
You all right?

44
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:58,823
Yeah. I'm hung over.

45
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,128
I can't believe
I have to face...

46
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,261
a class full of
eight-year-olds tomorrow.

47
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:05,272
So take the day off.

48
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:07,297
Frank, I just took the week off.

49
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:10,276
What's one more day
going to hurt?

50
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:13,439
Someday you'll have a job,
and then you'll understand.

51
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:15,346
I've had a job before.

52
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,431
I don't even know if I do.

53
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:36,502
- What's that?
- A little present.

54
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,198
What, for me?

55
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:41,003
After all these years, you're
still spoiling me like this?

56
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,770
If you don't want it,
I can give it to Frank.

57
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,007
- I'll take it.
- No, it's mine.

58
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:48,947
Unless it's a jawbreaker.
Then you can have it.

59
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,280
Thank you.

60
00:06:50,317 --> 00:06:54,481
It's a ring. That's so sweet.

61
00:06:54,522 --> 00:06:56,080
Yeah.

62
00:06:56,123 --> 00:07:00,082
- It's about time, pumpkinhead.
- It really is about time.

63
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,527
When are we going to set
the wedding?

64
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:07,594
- How about May?
- May. That's nice.

65
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,830
May wedding.
What do you think, Frank?

66
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,737
May works for me.
I'm off the whole month.

67
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:14,263
It'd give me
a little time to shop.

68
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:19,644
I guess all that's left
is for you to ask me officially.

69
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,942
OK.

70
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:31,754
Sarah, if this ring will do
until I can afford a real one...

71
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:35,323
It's not funny anymore.

72
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:37,523
It's not meant to be.

73
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,428
Will you marry me?

74
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:52,969
Well, say yes.

75
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:06,285
OK. OK, yes. Yes.

76
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:12,224
About goddamn time!

77
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:18,197
Is there anyone present
who knows a reason...

78
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:23,006
why these two should not be
joined in holy matrimony?

79
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:27,104
Speak now
or forever hold your peace.

80
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,875
Come on. Isn't anybody
going to help me out here?

81
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:33,443
You better not do that tomorrow.

82
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:35,478
You're just going to have
to wait and see.

83
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:36,750
I'll kill you.

84
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:43,222
And now, according
to the power vested in me,

85
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:48,258
I declare this rehearsal over,
and amen.

86
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:49,929
Hi, Sarah. Hi, Joseph.

87
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,269
You know, I just want
to say congratulations,

88
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:55,775
and I know
I've teased you both...

89
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:58,642
about the pitfalls of marriage
throughout the years,

90
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,204
but I just wanted to say...

91
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,773
why didn't you listen?

92
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:07,218
It's not too late. You've been
shacking up for years.

93
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:09,745
It worked out perfectly.
I got a tankful of gas.

94
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,953
We can head to
the Mexican border right now.

95
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:16,258
Duane and I
would just like to wish you...

96
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:20,529
all of the happiness and joy
in the world.

97
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:23,695
Yes. Marriage -
it's a beautiful thing.

98
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:27,639
Sarah, it's a big day tomorrow.

99
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:34,670
I know you and Joseph
will be very happy together.

100
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:38,046
You're a great catch.

101
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:42,454
I don't know you that well,
but I've known you long enough.

102
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:44,980
We've never really gotten
into any deep conversations,

103
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:49,052
but I consider you a friend.

104
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:53,089
And Joseph's an old friend.
And I just want you to know...

105
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:56,967
that I think you two are going
to be very happy together...

106
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:59,802
and make a wonderful couple.

107
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,035
Do you have something
to say to Joseph...

108
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:05,512
on the eve of the most
important day of his adult life?

109
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:09,482
I think it's great
they're in love and everything.

110
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:13,612
Congratulations, I guess,
are in order.

111
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,748
Make sure you have me
over for dinner a lot.

112
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,314
The thing about marriage,
though, man...

113
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:22,420
it's not like poker where
you're sitting at a table...

114
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:25,398
and you've got
a bad streak going -

115
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:27,366
you can just walk away,
get out of there.

116
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:30,768
But, you know, marriage is...
You got to stay there.

117
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:33,500
And you keep getting bad hands
and losing money...

118
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,235
and you lose
and you lose and you lose...

119
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:38,733
and it can break you,
and you can leave with nothing.

120
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:43,239
Here's the portrait
of a successful marriage.

121
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:47,310
Amy, could you tell
Joseph and Sarah...

122
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:53,315
what has been the key
to your successful bond?

123
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,157
Forgiveness.

124
00:10:56,463 --> 00:11:00,900
You have to learn
to forgive and forget.

125
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:04,961
Are there any specifics
you'd like to go into...

126
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:08,839
in terms of
exercising forgiveness?

127
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,235
There's a little
forgiveness muscle...

128
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,372
and very few people
know about it.

129
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:16,383
If you don't have it,
you're in trouble.

130
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:19,284
That's right. And we've got
a little machine at home...

131
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:23,187
that exercises
that forgiveness muscle.

132
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:26,056
- Really?
- I'll show you ours.

133
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:27,958
If you'll show me yours.

134
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:30,990
OK.

135
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:42,301
How have you avoided
getting hooked?

136
00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:44,333
How?

137
00:11:44,378 --> 00:11:47,836
I don't know.
I never met a woman like Sarah.

138
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,817
What about that cover
girl/actress you were seeing?

139
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:53,149
What the hell was her name?

140
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:54,313
Marianne.

141
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:56,447
Marianne. Whoo, boy!

142
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,890
You should've married her, man.
She was fucking gorgeous.

143
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,325
She was beautiful.

144
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,453
Only problem was, once I ran
out of ways to tell her that,

145
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:04,896
the relationship
sort of fizzled.

146
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,093
But she was beautiful.

147
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:09,796
Well, to the ones that got away.

148
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:12,772
How about to the one...

149
00:12:12,806 --> 00:12:14,330
- Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:15,841
...who didn't?

151
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,036
Hear, hear.

152
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,105
Strong enough?

153
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,482
We're running a little short
on the bloody marriage mix.

154
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,420
Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary.

155
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:31,913
- Right.
- Right.

156
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,893
You guys do have
a certain glow about you.

157
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:36,157
Doesn't she? She's a saint, too.

158
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:38,027
Please.

159
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,860
I'm marrying the most
beautiful woman in the world!

160
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:45,030
- Please, stop.
- No, not even just the world...

161
00:12:45,072 --> 00:12:46,801
the entire universe!

162
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,602
I can hardly wait
till we're married.

163
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,803
Why?

164
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:53,369
Because I never have to have
sex with you again.

165
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:58,148
A toast!

166
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:01,583
To the bachelor's life!

167
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,825
No. I'm kidding.
All right, to marriage.

168
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:07,793
Yeah. To marriage.

169
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,422
- To our marriage.
- To our marriage.

170
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:14,394
- And to our friends.
- Yeah!

171
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:17,335
To the bride and groom.

172
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:20,431
May they treat each other
as well as they've treated me.

173
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:21,634
Hear, hear.

174
00:13:24,444 --> 00:13:26,469
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

175
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:28,913
Go! Go! Go!

176
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,383
That's mature, Joseph.

177
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,181
Excuse me.

178
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,088
Hi.

179
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:46,732
Jesus.
You'll be all right, Joey.

180
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,565
It's not so bad.
It's only the rehearsal.

181
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:51,264
Remember our wedding, honey?

182
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:53,830
We got so stoned
I fell down her mother's stairs.

183
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,638
Yeah, that was great, Duane.

184
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:58,201
- I'm all right.
- Let's get out of here.

185
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:00,805
- You OK?
- Yeah.

186
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:03,577
God, Joseph,
don't you ever chew your food?

187
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,244
Shut up, Nigel.

188
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,225
Haven't seen much of you lately.

189
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,196
Got a girl?

190
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,755
- A couple.
- Oh, a couple.

191
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,928
- Do they know that?
- I'm pretty obvious.

192
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:26,730
I've been thinking about
moving back east.

193
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:27,967
Why?

194
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:31,171
I don't know.
Things have just...

195
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:33,941
I don't know.
I get headaches out here.

196
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:36,506
Everybody gets headaches.
It's the smog.

197
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,744
Yeah.

198
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:58,531
You know that first time
that Joe and I broke up?

199
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:02,169
Which first time?

200
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:05,906
The first, first time.

201
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,777
Why are you laughing?
The first, first time.

202
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:09,441
- Oh, the first, first time!
- Yeah.

203
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:11,212
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:16,245
Anyway, that first, first time
Joe and I broke up,

205
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:19,315
I almost went after you.

206
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:24,296
- Get out of here.
- I did. I did.

207
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:29,701
You mean, after me, after me?

208
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:31,931
After you.

209
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,668
I guess it's lucky I was shy.

210
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,007
It would be pretty
uncomfortable now, wouldn't it?

211
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:39,706
We would have gotten over it.

212
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,617
Joey would have thought
it was all about him...

213
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:46,448
and once we got back together...

214
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:49,478
he would have used it
to get off the hook...

215
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:52,492
for whoever
he'd been screwing with.

216
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:54,050
But what about me?

217
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:57,586
He would've tried
to punch you, but...

218
00:15:57,631 --> 00:16:00,998
then you both would've gone off
together and gotten drunk.

219
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:06,936
You're probably right.

220
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:10,067
Yeah, I know my men.

221
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:13,508
What about you and me?

222
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:17,540
Us? We would've been fine.

223
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:20,180
You sure?

224
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,053
Frank... come here.

225
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:37,568
See? We're still friends.

226
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,971
Poker, poker, poker!

227
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,616
He can still look.
A man can still look.

228
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:55,746
That was no look.
That was an unadulterated ogle.

229
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,257
- OK, I ogled.
- At your own wedding, Joe?

230
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,020
That's to you, Ror.

231
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,756
- To be or not to be...
- She was worthy of the ogle.

232
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,525
Come on, Joe,
at your own wedding.

233
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:05,826
You were ogling Sarah.

234
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,060
- I was not.
- You were.

235
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,398
I was, shamelessly.

236
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:12,030
We all were. Why do you think
they wear white?

237
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,912
So you can imagine them
as virginal and pure...

238
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,498
and then fantasize
about defiling them.

239
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:18,375
- You want to defile my wife?
- For old times' sake.

240
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:19,605
We're playing poker here,
fellas.

241
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:22,581
I didn't fantasize about
Deborah at your wedding.

242
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:25,084
- Neither did I. Anyone?
- No.

243
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:28,349
I really love these stimulating
intellectual discussions,

244
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:30,822
but can we please
get through a fucking hand?

245
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:32,882
- Rory!
- Just a second.

246
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,826
It's a fucking quarter.

247
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:37,421
- No. That's not the point.
- Here's a quarter.

248
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:39,830
- Rory's in.
- No. No!

249
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:42,164
- What have you got there?
- Four aces.

250
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:44,170
- Bet or don't bet.
- Just a second.

251
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:45,432
OK, Rory's out.

252
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:48,168
No, wait a minute!
I'm in! Jesus!

253
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:52,401
You live on the edge.
I call. Show your cards.

254
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:54,037
- Three tens.
- I'm slaughtered.

255
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,877
Straight.

256
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,144
I'm out.

257
00:17:57,184 --> 00:18:00,017
Straight, queen high.
What do you got, Rory?

258
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,715
- Nothing.
- You got to show.

259
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:04,053
I don't beat a straight.

260
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,819
I called you.
You've got to show your cards.

261
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,384
- What's it to you?
- It's the rules.

262
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:11,022
It's a game.

263
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:13,259
Ante up.

264
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,962
A pair of queens? You stayed in
with a pair of fucking queens?

265
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:17,731
Alas, poor Yorick.

266
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:19,261
What do you get
so damn serious about?

267
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,898
Because it drives me
fucking crazy.

268
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,239
- In Vegas...
- The Vegas speech!

269
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:24,766
In Las Vegas, Nevada,

270
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:26,711
they understand
the rhythm of the deal...

271
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:28,543
and the sanctity of the game.

272
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:33,485
Deal, Duane.
One game - seven-card stud. Pure.

273
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,920
They play it over and over.
You feel it,

274
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:38,117
like the lap of the ocean
against the shore.

275
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,252
You sit in silence,
study strategies.

276
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:43,728
None of this banter...
Whose dick is bigger than whose?

277
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:45,321
When's the fucking pizza coming?

278
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:47,925
When is
the fucking pizza coming?

279
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:52,731
Quarter.

280
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:55,798
See it, raise it.

281
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:58,541
See that, raise that.

282
00:18:58,578 --> 00:19:00,239
See that, raise that.

283
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,407
I'll see that quarter
and raise you another.

284
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:03,643
And another.

285
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,446
What the hell
have you got there?

286
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,612
Not much, apparently.

287
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,588
Joseph here
gets two aces early on...

288
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:11,181
with nothing underneath
to back it up.

289
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:12,691
Table talk.

290
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:14,193
Thinks he's going to chase
everybody out,

291
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:15,888
which he does,
but I do not balk.

292
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:19,626
- Table talk.
- So, now he's got two pair...

293
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,691
and nothing else.

294
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:24,397
And me, I started out
with a pair here,

295
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:26,905
which I have now turned
into three of a kind...

296
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,305
with this card here. Voila.

297
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:31,469
- Oh!
- You can't do that!

298
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:33,877
Sure I can, Joe.
It's to your advantage.

299
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:35,939
It is to your advantage.

300
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:38,644
So, now Joe's looking
for a long shot full house...

301
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:42,348
and I'm looking for
a full house or a fourth nine...

302
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,550
of which I noticed
none showed up in the deal.

303
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:46,923
Am I confident? Yes.

304
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,087
Big man. Real mature.

305
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,154
See you, raise you.

306
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:54,758
Well, I'll just see you.

307
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:57,964
I perceive
a homoerotic subtext here.

308
00:19:58,004 --> 00:19:59,403
Deal, Duane.

309
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:02,131
Down and dirty.

310
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:12,247
Bet's to you, Joe,
and whatever you bet...

311
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:13,775
I'm going to bet forty bucks.

312
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,617
You can't do that.

313
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:18,021
- Sure I can.
- No limit.

314
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:19,923
- But it's my bet.
- Then bet.

315
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,325
Then you're just going to raise.

316
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,988
Then you know what
I'm going to do.

317
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,462
I don't think
he's got his full house.

318
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:25,691
Think what you want to think,

319
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:28,064
but there is such a thing
as poker etiquette!

320
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,966
No table talk,
no betting out of order.

321
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,698
I've been saying this
for months.

322
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:33,205
You'd be shot in Vegas, right?

323
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,763
Yes, Frank
would be shot in Vegas.

324
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:37,003
- It's not Vegas, Joe.
- But am I right?

325
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:39,011
Yes, and God will punish him.
You're in or out.

326
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:40,774
You're out of line.

327
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:42,782
- You know the line?
- You know the line.

328
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:45,717
Guys, can you finish
the fucking hand?

329
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:48,016
Fifty cents.

330
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:51,819
- Forty dollars.
- Fuck this. Cash me out.

331
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:53,621
- Come on, Joe.
- Joseph.

332
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,389
Fuck you guys. No, no.

333
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,988
Frank's Mr. Big Stud,
flipping cards, betting high.

334
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:00,522
He called the hand. He won.
You happy, Frank?

335
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,297
There are our lovely hosts now.
How are you doing?

336
00:21:09,342 --> 00:21:11,310
Does Frank want a wienie?

337
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:13,505
Frank's been a wienie
for a long time.

338
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:15,571
- Is that mine?
- No, it's mine.

339
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:18,812
- Don't break it, mate.
- I won't. See you later.

340
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:20,615
Bye.

341
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:23,016
Now, what's this?

342
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:24,648
I asked you to watch her.

343
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:26,659
Fuck you. What am I, your slave?

344
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:29,321
Family feud.
Are you guys fighting?

345
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:32,559
Hi, Frank.
Look, honey. Your friend...

346
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,726
She was over by the pool
all by herself.

347
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:36,633
You said you'd watch her.

348
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:39,467
You guys might want to think
about counseling.

349
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,974
- Frank.
- Bye, Frank.

350
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:45,171
OK. Sorry about that.

351
00:21:45,211 --> 00:21:46,769
Hello.

352
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:49,907
Hi, guys.

353
00:21:49,949 --> 00:21:53,214
Hey, hey, hey.

354
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:56,450
Lauren, we're being harassed
by some guy with a camera.

355
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,548
I'm not harassing anybody.

356
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:01,059
He's not harassing anyone,
he says.

357
00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:02,823
What are you doing here?

358
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:04,796
I'm taking your picture.

359
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:06,822
He's over here trying
to get pictures...

360
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:09,426
of half-naked girls
without any make-up on.

361
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:11,369
Come on. Be nice.

362
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:13,065
What's this for?

363
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:16,906
- It's for...
- Personal use?

364
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:18,604
Is it about something?

365
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:19,873
It's for personal use.

366
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:22,473
Are you doing it
so you can stare at us later?

367
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:23,743
It's about the party.

368
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:25,717
Really? That sounds boring.

369
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:28,846
- It's also about me.
- That would be interesting.

370
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:30,583
- You think so?
- Yeah.

371
00:22:30,623 --> 00:22:33,524
I think it would be interesting.

372
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,892
Give me the camera.
I want to do you.

373
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,489
- Why?
- Because I like you.

374
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:40,522
I don't think
I want to give it to you.

375
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,365
Oh, no, no, no!

376
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,394
Don't film me.

377
00:22:45,438 --> 00:22:47,804
Now... is it on?

378
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:49,900
Is this thing on?

379
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:52,605
- Do you see me?
- Yeah.

380
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:54,135
Then it's on.

381
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,479
OK. Right, right.

382
00:22:57,517 --> 00:23:00,247
Tell us about your life.

383
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:02,117
This actually wasn't about me.

384
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:04,453
It's actually about
the party out there.

385
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:06,186
Tell us about your life anyway.

386
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:08,126
Why don't you film...

387
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:10,987
All right, I admit it.

388
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,861
I don't have a life.

389
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:14,389
You're breaking my heart.

390
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,528
Are you one of
those cynical people?

391
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,836
No. More like bitter.

392
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,469
Really? Why is that?

393
00:23:24,511 --> 00:23:26,570
I don't know. I'm just...

394
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,207
It must be a girl.
It's always a girl.

395
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:33,208
- Lauren, you're a goddess!
- Female prophet.

396
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:36,086
You're a woman's woman.
You know, girl.

397
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:37,487
- Is it?
- What?

398
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:39,992
- A girl.
- No.

399
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:41,687
I think it is a girl.

400
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:43,662
We have a girl problem here.

401
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:45,323
Why is it that girls
always think...

402
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:50,462
Did you love her
and then she left you?

403
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:52,630
I told you there is no problem.

404
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,640
Oh, yeah. I don't believe you.

405
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:58,132
Hi, sweetie.
You making new friends?

406
00:23:58,178 --> 00:24:00,976
Hi. Are you making a movie?

407
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:04,108
No, we're not. He is.
We're just helping out.

408
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,141
Do you have a statement to make?

409
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:08,279
No, I don't think so.

410
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,653
I think you better
keep on filming him.

411
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,715
Make your peace
with your public.

412
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,056
Sorry. Bye.

413
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:15,583
Walk that runway, girl.

414
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:17,994
Work that vest. There you go.

415
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:19,589
- Is that her?
- Who?

416
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:21,463
The girl who left you?

417
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,901
There's no girl.
Give me the camera.

418
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:27,202
I think that's somebody who
hasn't been returning my calls.

419
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,502
Because I'm mad at you.

420
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,099
- Why?
- You piss me off.

421
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:32,771
What do you mean,
I piss you off?

422
00:24:32,812 --> 00:24:35,940
You got to watch out
for that unresolved resentment.

423
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:38,951
It can cause diseases.
I'm sure you've heard that.

424
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:40,577
Have you thought of therapy?

425
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,247
I'm in therapy twice a week.

426
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:43,619
- You're kidding me.
- No.

427
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:44,953
What do you talk about?

428
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:47,357
All we talk about is you -
it's weird -

429
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:50,294
and what a dick you are
but how much I like you anyway.

430
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,854
That makes me feel a lot better.

431
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:53,889
- Whose camera is that?
- It's mine.

432
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:55,332
That's not your camera.

433
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,802
You can't afford that
because you're such a loser.

434
00:24:57,837 --> 00:24:59,828
Why don't you eat me, Joe?

435
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:01,430
OK.

436
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:03,999
- Oh, no. Go away.
- What do you want?

437
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:06,568
- I hate this.
- Take that thing off my face.

438
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,877
I just want
to have a conversation.

439
00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:10,644
You want me to say
something quotable?

440
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:14,312
Yeah, why don't you say
something quotable?

441
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:17,812
I'll give you more later.
Over and out.

442
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:21,452
Nigel, come on. See you, Nigel.

443
00:25:21,494 --> 00:25:22,859
Good-bye, Frank.

444
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:24,021
Hello.

445
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:26,429
Oh, no. No, please, don't.

446
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:27,660
What's the matter?

447
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,930
I don't like the way I look.

448
00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:31,869
I sound like a man
on those things.

449
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,371
You don't sound like a man.

450
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,703
I do, I do.

451
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,709
Wait till you listen to it.

452
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,303
"She sounds just like me".

453
00:25:39,345 --> 00:25:40,972
- Nice.
- Yeah.

454
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:44,882
Before, you sounded like
your normal, velvet-voiced self.

455
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:50,983
Is this why you came here?

456
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:53,219
No, I came to see you.

457
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:56,160
Then take that thing away
from your face.

458
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:01,164
Yes, Frank,
what can I do for you?

459
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,168
Why don't you...

460
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:05,830
tell me all about me?

461
00:26:05,872 --> 00:26:08,966
Really?
The stuff you want to hear...

462
00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:10,976
or the stuff
you don't want to hear?

463
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,534
Just tell me everything.

464
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:13,875
I don't know everything.

465
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:17,940
Then tell me what you know.

466
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,282
Starting from when?

467
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,582
From the beginning.

468
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,521
I don't know you
from the beginning, honey.

469
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:25,990
I only know you from the middle.

470
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:28,357
Then how about from there?

471
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,761
You're being so weird.

472
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,927
Why don't you just say
whatever pops into your mind?

473
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,631
The first thing. Whatever.

474
00:26:39,672 --> 00:26:42,732
This is...
Do I really have to do this?

475
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:45,369
I don't think so. Why?

476
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:47,902
Because I asked you
as a favor to me.

477
00:26:47,947 --> 00:26:50,040
See, that's it.

478
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,983
You want me to tell you
all about you.

479
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:54,350
I don't see you
since the wedding,

480
00:26:54,387 --> 00:26:56,981
then you show up
out of no place and expect me...

481
00:26:57,023 --> 00:27:00,015
to tell you all about you
as a favor to you.

482
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,084
I think that just about
wraps it up.

483
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:04,892
- You think so?
- I do. Give me that.

484
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,831
Tell me something about you.

485
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,236
Tell me something
about something.

486
00:27:13,272 --> 00:27:14,500
OK.

487
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,168
OK? God, just a minute.

488
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,804
How about...

489
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,905
How about the first time
I saw you?

490
00:27:21,948 --> 00:27:23,677
I already know that.

491
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:27,482
No, you don't.
I mean before we met.

492
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,420
The first, first time.

493
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:34,151
There was a first, first time?

494
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:39,390
OK, tell me about that.

495
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:40,626
OK.

496
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:46,167
When...

497
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:48,173
- What?
- OK.

498
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:50,334
I was...

499
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:53,345
I was about to take
my last test...

500
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:56,007
my sophomore year...

501
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:57,481
and...

502
00:27:59,352 --> 00:28:02,515
It was in
English Medieval Renaissance.

503
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,282
I was just about to go
into the building...

504
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:09,089
and I saw you.

505
00:28:11,697 --> 00:28:13,688
It was raining out that day...

506
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,860
and the sky was dark...

507
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,268
and you were standing there...

508
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,035
in this long gray raincoat.

509
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:25,305
You had this green umbrella.

510
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:28,370
And, I don't know,
it was just strange.

511
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:30,382
Everything was dark,
and there you were...

512
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:32,077
with this green umbrella.

513
00:28:32,118 --> 00:28:33,949
And...

514
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:38,253
And then the sky
was starting to break,

515
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:42,921
and just as the light
burst out of the sky...

516
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:44,725
you did the neatest thing...

517
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,823
You twirled your umbrella
a little bit...

518
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:48,356
and caught the light.

519
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:50,232
You were
the most beautiful thing...

520
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,601
I'd ever seen in my life.

521
00:28:58,244 --> 00:29:01,680
And then...

522
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:03,705
then Joseph came
out of the building...

523
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:06,741
and he...

524
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:11,553
He went clomping up to you
like Gene Kelly in...

525
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:13,081
"Singin' in the Rain".

526
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,593
He was clomping
through the puddles...

527
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,654
and that's when...

528
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:23,892
I don't remember that.

529
00:29:28,107 --> 00:29:30,769
That's because
we didn't know each other then.

530
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:34,846
It was really funny.

531
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:37,543
The next semester
when I came back...

532
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,677
and Joseph was my roommate...

533
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,483
and you were his girlfriend.

534
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,332
- Frank?
- Frank-o!

535
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,865
I'm in the kitchen!

536
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,612
I brought
some strawberries, Frank.

537
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:11,116
Good.

538
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,243
Where's the booze?

539
00:30:13,286 --> 00:30:15,311
- Hi, Duane.
- Where's the booze?

540
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:16,514
You know where the booze is.

541
00:30:16,556 --> 00:30:19,389
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. How are you?

542
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:21,950
- You look like shit, Frank.
- Thank you, Deborah.

543
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:24,554
You're welcome.
Where's your date?

544
00:30:24,597 --> 00:30:25,962
She's not here yet.

545
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,523
Told you he wouldn't
have a date.

546
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:30,468
Who is she?

547
00:30:30,503 --> 00:30:32,334
Ran into Marianne.

548
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:34,168
Cover girl? She's coming here?

549
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:35,366
Yeah.

550
00:30:35,408 --> 00:30:39,071
Like us to leave you alone
for a few minutes, Duane?

551
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:41,238
I haven't seen her
in a long time, that's all.

552
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,214
Look at his face.

553
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,783
Is she your girlfriend again,
Frank?

554
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:54,850
No, she's not my girlfriend.
She's a date.

555
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:33,555
I don't know.

556
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,626
I've had sex before -
more than once -

557
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,831
and I think
I've figured out why I do it.

558
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:41,362
Go ahead, Joe.

559
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:44,069
I remember going
through the birth canal.

560
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,805
- Oh, God.
- No, I'm...

561
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:48,370
My skin was really
sensitive back then...

562
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:49,779
Want some wine?

563
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:52,113
It was like
I was one big, giant penis.

564
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:53,743
Nothing's changed, Joseph.

565
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,016
No, no. Pay attention, please.

566
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:58,615
There I was
in the birth canal...

567
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:02,992
and my adrenaline
was really pumping...

568
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:06,021
and these dark, wet,
powerful muscles...

569
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:07,259
were shunting me...

570
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:10,268
and elongating my head
into a banana shape...

571
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:12,429
which is a very odd sensation.

572
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:15,269
And imagine the kind of
consciousness you have...

573
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:18,435
when you're getting oxygen,
but you're not breathing.

574
00:32:18,477 --> 00:32:20,468
You're just alive.

575
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:24,807
So now that I'm a big boy...

576
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,378
I find myself going back
to that place again and again...

577
00:32:29,422 --> 00:32:33,586
because it's only really
just before I blow my wad...

578
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:34,854
Dear God.

579
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:39,160
...that I ever experience
what it was like being born.

580
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:42,531
- That is so amazing.
- Isn't it?

581
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:44,695
It's incredible
you remember being born.

582
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:47,797
One of my boyfriends
is a licensed rebirther.

583
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,068
Really?

584
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:51,599
He's trying to regress me
back to the womb,

585
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:54,078
but it's been
really difficult for me.

586
00:32:54,113 --> 00:32:56,172
Why?

587
00:32:57,717 --> 00:33:01,346
I think it's because infants
are so helpless...

588
00:33:01,387 --> 00:33:04,823
and I need to be in control.

589
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,424
So, Marianne,

590
00:33:10,463 --> 00:33:12,829
how many boyfriends
do you have, anyway?

591
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,025
Honey, please, that's...

592
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:15,727
How many men do I have sex with?

593
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:18,168
Yeah, I'm just curious.

594
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,764
More than one.

595
00:33:20,806 --> 00:33:23,707
- Congratulations, Frank.
- Thanks, Sarah.

596
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:26,143
Girl fight.

597
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:30,706
Is that two or a few...

598
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,084
or the Los Angeles Raiders?

599
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:37,988
Honey, what are you doing?

600
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:40,321
What are you doing?

601
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:44,796
Could I have
a cigarette, please?

602
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,492
I'm sorry if
I threaten you in some way.

603
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,797
I happen to like men.

604
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:55,705
And what is it about them,
exactly, that you like?

605
00:33:56,976 --> 00:33:59,376
Different things
about different men.

606
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:02,278
I bet.

607
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:07,617
Well, I think
that's very commendable...

608
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:09,382
and rare, in my experience.

609
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:11,616
Shut up, Duane.
If it's so commendable,

610
00:34:11,657 --> 00:34:13,352
then how come
you don't like women?

611
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:14,723
Good point.

612
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,558
I like women...
Hairless, obsequious women.

613
00:34:17,596 --> 00:34:19,689
You're so deep. It's true.

614
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:22,667
He used to make all his
girlfriends shave their twats.

615
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:25,397
You're a sick man, Duane.

616
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:27,905
I don't like hair.
I like hairless girls.

617
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,708
Girls? Like a little diaper rash
in their creases, Duane?

618
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:36,306
I think you would like men
a lot less...

619
00:34:36,348 --> 00:34:38,077
if you were married to one.

620
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,381
I don't know. What about Frank?

621
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:41,818
He's not bad.

622
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:47,019
I like Frank.
I'm just not the marrying type.

623
00:34:50,095 --> 00:34:54,862
Poor Frank.
Are you disappointed?

624
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:59,164
Yeah, I'm devastated.

625
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:03,539
You're so sweet.
Why aren't you married?

626
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:08,340
I guess I haven't met
the right woman yet.

627
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,871
What kind would that be?

628
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,321
Like... you.

629
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:18,880
One like you.

630
00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:21,154
You're so cute.

631
00:35:21,193 --> 00:35:22,626
He is so cute.

632
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:25,186
Honey, I'm about to cloud up...

633
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:28,132
and rain all over you.

634
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:33,935
If you like me so much,
why don't you...

635
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:36,066
bring me flowers?

636
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:40,204
Roses? Would you like roses?

637
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:43,704
Which grow profusely in the...

638
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:45,410
ordure of romance.

639
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:48,113
What the hell's going on here?

640
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:55,083
I'm trying to tell your wife
that I'm in love with her.

641
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:00,160
Frank's trying to seduce me.

642
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:04,397
You're trying to seduce me,
aren't you, Frank?

643
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:08,596
I love you, Sarah.

644
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:10,905
What the fuck are you doing?

645
00:36:10,943 --> 00:36:12,604
What the fuck is going on here?

646
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:14,203
Are you nuts? That's my wife!

647
00:36:14,246 --> 00:36:15,907
What's your fucking problem?

648
00:36:15,948 --> 00:36:17,939
Go, Frank.

649
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:19,951
Go!

650
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,543
Thanks so much for dinner.

651
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:24,181
It was so nice seeing you all.

652
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,054
Take it easy, Marianne.

653
00:36:48,314 --> 00:36:50,145
Want a cigarette?

654
00:36:53,352 --> 00:36:54,910
Thanks.

655
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:13,937
Is it me?

656
00:37:15,774 --> 00:37:18,208
No. Sometimes being married...

657
00:37:18,243 --> 00:37:20,211
is like having
dog shit on your shoe...

658
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:23,237
and nothing
to scrape it off with.

659
00:37:27,486 --> 00:37:29,545
Want to play some ball tomorrow?

660
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,081
You want more humiliation?

661
00:37:35,027 --> 00:37:38,588
I'll pick you up tomorrow
at 6:00, all right?

662
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,121
How's your marriage
counseling going?

663
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:45,028
It's good. It's all right.

664
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,231
You like your counselor?

665
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:49,706
Yeah, she's all right.

666
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,610
You know what she said to me
the other day?

667
00:37:56,648 --> 00:38:00,049
She said
I was full of inner rage.

668
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:01,848
You believe that shit?

669
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:05,914
I should have popped her
right then. Bitch.

670
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,482
Duane!

671
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:12,026
You begin to hate
the sound of your own name.

672
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:15,431
- Honey, come on.
- OK.

673
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:18,999
You'll be all right, man.

674
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:21,336
- See you later.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

675
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:48,059
I want to drive.

676
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,261
Why?

677
00:38:50,302 --> 00:38:54,500
I just think
it'll be a good idea.

678
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,873
I'm sorry, honey. I didn't...

679
00:38:59,011 --> 00:39:00,774
You piss me off.

680
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:21,562
And, Daddy,
she didn't deserve it

681
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,297
All the pain and the hurt

682
00:39:25,337 --> 00:39:29,103
And I could
never hate you for it

683
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:32,872
'Cause I learned about love
when she said

684
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:36,745
She said, "Honey,
your daddy is dead to me"

685
00:39:36,782 --> 00:39:40,513
"But to you,
your daddy he'll always be"

686
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:44,545
"And although he made me
cry my last tear"

687
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,957
"To you,
he should always be dear"

688
00:39:47,993 --> 00:39:49,255
And Mother

689
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:52,593
You're the kindest woman
I've ever seen

690
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:55,566
A love like yours is rarely seen

691
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,592
And although you were hurt

692
00:39:57,636 --> 00:39:59,729
You held your head high

693
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:01,739
And thanks to you

694
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:06,767
My daddy's alive

695
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:13,116
- All right.
- Thank you.

696
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:15,120
Thank you, thank you.

697
00:40:15,154 --> 00:40:17,622
- I wrote that myself.
- I could tell.

698
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:19,385
Did you like it?

699
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:22,950
- It was very human.
- Thank you.

700
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:25,862
- Let's play poker.
- All right.

701
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:28,628
- Got any eights?
- Nope. Go fish.

702
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:32,000
- Come on.
- We're just being cute.

703
00:40:32,037 --> 00:40:34,972
We'll be serious.

704
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:38,670
You've got the old maid,
don't you?

705
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,941
Why am I always the last one
to hear about these things?

706
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,277
I thought we were friends.

707
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,839
We are friends.
That's why we didn't tell you.

708
00:40:44,883 --> 00:40:48,011
We didn't want to shatter
your fragile fantasy world.

709
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:49,987
Did they hurt each other?

710
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:51,353
You are so dear.

711
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,757
They didn't hurt each other,
because I was Mr. Peacemaker.

712
00:40:54,793 --> 00:40:57,557
I wanted to pop
the son of a bitch myself.

713
00:40:57,596 --> 00:41:00,156
See, that really upsets me.

714
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,827
You can't look at her cards.
You're still in the hand.

715
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:04,802
Sorry. Hold on to that ace.

716
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:06,565
Great. Ruin my bluff.

717
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:08,539
What's a bluff?

718
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:10,906
When you lie about your hand
and chase everyone else out.

719
00:41:10,943 --> 00:41:12,137
Gotcha.

720
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:14,168
How do you know I wasn't
bluffing about her ace?

721
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:16,477
Because you can't bluff
someone else's hand.

722
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,278
Why not, Neil?

723
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:19,875
Because you can't.

724
00:41:19,918 --> 00:41:21,613
Does it confuse you?

725
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,814
No, it doesn't confuse me.

726
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:25,584
And my name's Leo, not Neil.

727
00:41:25,624 --> 00:41:28,024
Why are you angry?

728
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,584
I'm not angry.

729
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:32,188
Bet big, girl.
He's angry and confused.

730
00:41:32,231 --> 00:41:33,960
I bet all my chips.

731
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:36,365
You can't bet out of turn.

732
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:40,098
When it's my turn,
the chips will be there.

733
00:41:40,138 --> 00:41:43,574
I'm sorry, but this Frank thing
is really upsetting me.

734
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:46,237
- You're so sensitive.
- Come sit between us.

735
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:48,906
A little drama's
good for a marriage.

736
00:41:48,947 --> 00:41:50,608
But they're best friends.

737
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:52,446
Frank is her friend.

738
00:41:52,484 --> 00:41:55,248
We're friends.
Where does that leave me?

739
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:56,447
Who's Frank?

740
00:41:56,488 --> 00:41:59,048
That guy shooting down our tops
at the barbecue.

741
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:00,718
He was kind of cute.

742
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:02,727
It's your bet, sweetheart.

743
00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:06,822
OK, big cock. Here's my bet.

744
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:10,333
I think that Frank guy
needs to get laid.

745
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:12,564
Precisely. He's chosen
his best friend's wife...

746
00:42:12,604 --> 00:42:14,629
as the object
of his clumsy affections.

747
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:16,140
That's wonderful, Nigel.

748
00:42:16,174 --> 00:42:17,402
What?

749
00:42:17,442 --> 00:42:19,137
These girls don't need
to hear about that, man.

750
00:42:19,177 --> 00:42:22,476
These girls
are my trusted employees.

751
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:25,312
They won't breathe a word.
They can keep a secret.

752
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,476
Promise.

753
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:28,486
Cross my heart, hope to die.

754
00:42:31,823 --> 00:42:33,814
Anyway, it sounds like
amateur dinner theater...

755
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:35,019
Frank being Frank.

756
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,687
Now, that confuses me.

757
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:39,822
Am I supposed
to be angry at Frank?

758
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:42,493
He's a slime hound
with warts on his dick.

759
00:42:42,534 --> 00:42:45,367
- So you guys are friends.
- Exactly.

760
00:42:45,404 --> 00:42:47,736
You should do
that guy Frank, Lauren.

761
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,206
I don't know.

762
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:51,471
I checked him out.
He looked kind of small.

763
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,308
I need a big stiff one,
and I don't mean a cocktail!

764
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:56,871
Oh, my God!
I think I just grew a penis!

765
00:42:56,915 --> 00:42:59,645
Poker will do it to you
every time!

766
00:42:59,685 --> 00:43:01,915
It's raining sperm in here!
Oh, my face!

767
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:05,582
- Cross your legs!
- Oh, yes!

768
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,390
So you're really angry at him.

769
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:12,795
I don't want
to waste my time on it.

770
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:14,031
I don't want to talk about it.

771
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:15,761
A man who gleefully admits...

772
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,666
having had sex
with his sister...

773
00:43:17,703 --> 00:43:19,796
is now making moral judgments.

774
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:22,830
- What?
- You had sex with your sister?

775
00:43:22,874 --> 00:43:26,366
She was five. I was four.
It was consensual.

776
00:43:26,411 --> 00:43:29,938
That's what allows me to make
these higher moral judgments.

777
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:32,848
- I'm evolved.
- I see.

778
00:43:32,884 --> 00:43:34,749
I think I'm mad at him.

779
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:38,278
Congratulations, Rory.
You've picked an emotion.

780
00:43:38,323 --> 00:43:42,225
I have this weird, crazy idea.
Let's play poker.

781
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,027
No, no, no. What do you think?

782
00:43:47,065 --> 00:43:49,863
I think that you are
chronically indecisive,

783
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:51,300
Duane's overreacting,

784
00:43:51,336 --> 00:43:53,463
Frank is lonely and sad,

785
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,564
and I am getting impatient.

786
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:58,041
You have
a lot of hostility in you.

787
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:01,534
I've also got two pairs
towards a full house.

788
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,549
The thing is -
and I'll leave it at this -

789
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:07,882
is that you guys can't know,
because you're not married.

790
00:44:07,919 --> 00:44:09,443
I'm married, Duane.

791
00:44:09,488 --> 00:44:11,888
That's stretching
the definition a bit, isn't it?

792
00:44:11,923 --> 00:44:14,391
I believe I should be insulted.

793
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:16,257
Shall I be angry with you now?

794
00:44:16,294 --> 00:44:19,092
Dog fight.

795
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:20,860
I'm secure in my marriage.

796
00:44:20,899 --> 00:44:22,992
Whatever, Nigel.

797
00:44:23,034 --> 00:44:24,467
Nobody wake him up.

798
00:44:24,503 --> 00:44:27,165
What foreign creature
crawled up your rectum?

799
00:44:27,205 --> 00:44:29,503
A kiss is just a kiss.

800
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,509
To demonstrate...

801
00:44:33,812 --> 00:44:35,473
See? No harm done.

802
00:44:37,048 --> 00:44:40,745
Don't you ever, ever
do that again, Nigel,

803
00:44:40,786 --> 00:44:42,754
unless I ask for it,
or I'm hard up.

804
00:44:42,788 --> 00:44:44,688
That hurt.

805
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:48,352
Good. I'm glad. Good.

806
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:49,883
My point is...

807
00:44:49,928 --> 00:44:51,725
What if I told Amy about this?

808
00:44:51,763 --> 00:44:54,425
Exactly.
Tell her, and we'll endure.

809
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:58,698
They'll endure
if we all love one another.

810
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,331
Nigel, you're so full
of insight and charm.

811
00:45:01,373 --> 00:45:04,604
You really are. No, I'm serious.

812
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:15,379
This game is boring.
Nothing happens.

813
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,251
Do you want
to hear another song?

814
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:18,984
I got eight more that I wrote.

815
00:45:19,024 --> 00:45:21,219
Let her play. It's nice.

816
00:45:24,229 --> 00:45:25,890
Once again

817
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:29,594
I'm without my man

818
00:45:29,634 --> 00:45:34,469
My lover and my friend

819
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,571
Mine are hardly
the sort of novels...

820
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:47,278
today's filmmakers
are racing to adapt.

821
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:50,755
They're not seething
with raw sensuality...

822
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,416
nor do they contain...

823
00:45:52,457 --> 00:45:57,360
periodic spasms
of orgiastic bloodshed.

824
00:45:57,395 --> 00:45:59,329
Also, one rarely sees...

825
00:45:59,364 --> 00:46:03,130
characters as old as mine
in American films,

826
00:46:03,168 --> 00:46:05,159
and when they do pop up...

827
00:46:05,203 --> 00:46:07,865
it's only for a scene or two.

828
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:11,239
They're not allowed to be
the whole story...

829
00:46:11,276 --> 00:46:13,210
as they are in my books.

830
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:15,770
Though, now that I think of it,

831
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:19,181
I was approached
perhaps 20 years ago...

832
00:46:19,217 --> 00:46:23,085
by some people who wanted
to film my third book,

833
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:27,922
which was called
"A Vulgar Superfluity".

834
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:32,896
Although they suggested
I try to think of another title.

835
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:34,262
They wanted to cast...

836
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:37,063
some American actress
whom I'd never heard of,

837
00:46:37,102 --> 00:46:41,198
though she was apparently
quite popular at the time.

838
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:43,366
They showed me
one of her films...

839
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:45,740
and I thought, "Oh, dear."

840
00:46:45,777 --> 00:46:49,645
"She's quite
immensely unsuitable".

841
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,013
Her name escapes me now.

842
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,679
Amy, dear, what was the name
of that actress...

843
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,382
they were so keen
to have play Daphne?

844
00:46:58,423 --> 00:47:00,152
Raquel Welch.

845
00:47:00,191 --> 00:47:02,921
Yes, that's it!

846
00:47:02,961 --> 00:47:05,054
Oh, dear, yes.

847
00:47:05,096 --> 00:47:06,791
That is one boring lady
in there.

848
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:08,458
She's like
some kind of hypnotist.

849
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,025
You think she's bad,
try reading one of her books.

850
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:12,509
Though don't mix them
with alcohol...

851
00:47:12,537 --> 00:47:14,437
as people have been known
to slip into comas.

852
00:47:14,472 --> 00:47:16,406
What's Amy's dad like?
Is he as bad?

853
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:19,774
Her dad's great.
He ran for his life years ago.

854
00:47:19,811 --> 00:47:21,779
She married
this aging closet case...

855
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:23,371
who's probably
in London right now,

856
00:47:23,415 --> 00:47:25,178
working his way through
the male ensemble...

857
00:47:25,216 --> 00:47:26,342
of "Starlight Express".

858
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:29,376
- Fucking Nigel.
- He's fine.

859
00:47:29,421 --> 00:47:31,412
He has to sit there,
sneering at her...

860
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:35,187
like she's in any danger
of forgetting he hates her guts.

861
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:36,853
He's just jealous.

862
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,262
Deeply.
Not that he'd ever admit it.

863
00:47:40,298 --> 00:47:42,129
And there's the money thing.

864
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,727
Her bailing us out last year.

865
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:47,704
I think it's really going fine.

866
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,934
Sounds like you and Mom
don't get along too well.

867
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:53,706
No. She thinks of me
as some disgusting habit...

868
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,009
Amy will outgrow someday,
like thumb-sucking.

869
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:57,981
Her expectations of me
have gotten so low...

870
00:47:58,016 --> 00:47:59,643
that it's actually
something of a challenge...

871
00:47:59,684 --> 00:48:02,847
to disappoint her,
but I do my best.

872
00:48:02,887 --> 00:48:04,184
This is really strong.

873
00:48:04,222 --> 00:48:05,689
I've been saving it
for her visit.

874
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:07,692
How much longer
is she sticking around for?

875
00:48:07,726 --> 00:48:10,923
Ten days.
I have a strange premonition...

876
00:48:10,962 --> 00:48:12,930
she'll decide
to shorten her visit.

877
00:48:12,964 --> 00:48:14,329
Really?

878
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:16,391
Nigel, are you in there?

879
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:18,902
No, don't come in!

880
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,370
Your guest just showed up.

881
00:48:20,405 --> 00:48:21,872
I suppose
you think you're funny?

882
00:48:21,906 --> 00:48:25,205
I'm stoned.
I think everything's funny.

883
00:48:25,243 --> 00:48:28,076
- Thank you for that.
- Who's here?

884
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:31,674
You should enjoy this.
He invited Frank.

885
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:34,184
- Frank is here?
- What'd you do that for?

886
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:35,379
He's my friend, too.

887
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,320
You can't expect me
to shun him for your sake.

888
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:38,549
I hate you.

889
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,353
I think you two
should kiss and make up.

890
00:48:40,392 --> 00:48:41,791
Or beat the crap
out of each other.

891
00:48:41,826 --> 00:48:43,293
That would be interesting, too.

892
00:48:43,328 --> 00:48:46,092
You're so clever, Nigel.
You really are.

893
00:48:46,164 --> 00:48:48,724
It's very nice
to meet you, Frank.

894
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:50,200
Nice to meet you as well.

895
00:48:50,235 --> 00:48:52,760
I really enjoy your books.

896
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,773
How kind of you to say so.

897
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,707
This is Pamela.

898
00:48:57,742 --> 00:48:59,505
Hi. Nice meeting you.

899
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:02,604
How do you do?
Are you a friend of Amy's?

900
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:03,841
Who's Amy?

901
00:49:03,882 --> 00:49:05,782
No. Actually,
I'm a friend of Nigel's.

902
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,114
We play poker together.

903
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:10,417
Oh, I see.

904
00:49:10,455 --> 00:49:13,549
Help yourself to some tea...

905
00:49:13,591 --> 00:49:15,957
or there's champagne,
if you'd prefer.

906
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,359
Thank you.

907
00:49:17,395 --> 00:49:18,862
Thank you.

908
00:49:18,897 --> 00:49:20,296
Hi, I'm Pamela.

909
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:21,559
Deborah.

910
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,567
Hi. Nice meeting you.

911
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:26,468
- Hi, Pamela. I'm Duane.
- Hello, Duane.

912
00:49:26,504 --> 00:49:28,131
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

913
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,300
What nice little sandwiches.

914
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:33,105
Champagne crisis.

915
00:49:33,144 --> 00:49:35,544
- I'll get it.
- No, allow me.

916
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,774
Really!

917
00:49:36,815 --> 00:49:41,013
- Hi, I'm Athena.
- Lauren. Great scarf.

918
00:49:41,052 --> 00:49:42,280
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

919
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,982
This is Josh.

920
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:47,617
Hi.

921
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:52,653
So, are you
working on a new book?

922
00:49:52,697 --> 00:49:56,064
Yes. I'm perhaps
halfway through.

923
00:49:56,101 --> 00:49:57,568
- Great.
- What's it about?

924
00:49:57,602 --> 00:49:59,968
It's a minor
superstition of mine...

925
00:50:00,004 --> 00:50:03,997
never to discuss my books
until I finish writing them,

926
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,442
not even with my husband.

927
00:50:06,478 --> 00:50:10,642
It has at times been a source
of some friction between us.

928
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:12,013
I wouldn't have thought...

929
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,883
there was any friction at all
between you and Sydney.

930
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:17,911
Perhaps you don't know us
as well as you suppose.

931
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:19,355
Frank, can I talk to you
in the kitchen?

932
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,590
There's nothing to talk about.

933
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,058
No, there's a lot to talk about.

934
00:50:22,093 --> 00:50:23,651
What the hell's going on here?

935
00:50:23,695 --> 00:50:26,493
- I want to talk to you.
- Were you two an item?

936
00:50:26,531 --> 00:50:28,158
I would like to...

937
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:30,030
I want you to control yourself.

938
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,933
I'm not the one
who can't control himself!

939
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,198
Keep your voice down.

940
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,569
Did you know
he was going be here?

941
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:36,039
Is that why we had to come
to this thing?

942
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,564
If I wanted to see him,

943
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:39,509
this is how I would arrange it?

944
00:50:39,544 --> 00:50:42,274
Excuse me. Would you mind
going somewhere else?

945
00:50:42,313 --> 00:50:43,541
I was here first.

946
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:45,549
He's following you around
with a big fucking hard-on,

947
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:46,845
and I'm not supposed
to say anything?

948
00:50:46,885 --> 00:50:50,150
So, Pamela,
what sort of work do you do?

949
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:51,780
You think
he came here for the tea?

950
00:50:51,823 --> 00:50:52,983
No. He's here
because you're here.

951
00:50:53,024 --> 00:50:55,185
That's the only reason,
and everyone knows it...

952
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:57,126
and you know it,
and it's embarrassing.

953
00:50:57,162 --> 00:50:59,096
I don't like it.
You think I'm enjoying...

954
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,654
I do think you enjoy this!

955
00:51:00,698 --> 00:51:03,166
You're the center of attention.
Everyone's looking at you.

956
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:06,364
Fuck you, Joe!
I did not ask for this.

957
00:51:06,404 --> 00:51:08,395
Neither did I,
which is why we're leaving.

958
00:51:08,439 --> 00:51:10,373
No, fuck you!
You don't tell me what to do!

959
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:11,841
If you want to go, you go!

960
00:51:11,876 --> 00:51:13,173
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

961
00:51:13,211 --> 00:51:14,576
At the moment, I would love it.

962
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:16,170
I would fucking love it.

963
00:51:26,057 --> 00:51:28,025
I am sorry about that.

964
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:29,458
I'm really sorry.

965
00:51:29,494 --> 00:51:31,325
It's hardly your fault, dear.

966
00:51:31,362 --> 00:51:35,594
It's just Nigel showing us all
how Nigel he can be.

967
00:51:35,633 --> 00:51:39,364
And what exactly
do you mean by that?

968
00:51:39,404 --> 00:51:43,067
I do not enjoy speaking to you
when you are drunk.

969
00:51:43,107 --> 00:51:46,304
Thank you.
That's very useful information.

970
00:51:46,344 --> 00:51:48,835
Shut up, Nigel.

971
00:51:51,816 --> 00:51:52,976
He's going?

972
00:51:53,017 --> 00:51:56,919
Son of a bi...
He left with my date!

973
00:51:56,955 --> 00:51:58,422
What?

974
00:51:59,924 --> 00:52:02,119
You people are fucking sick!

975
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,856
Oh, dear.

976
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:06,454
Thanks for having us.

977
00:52:06,497 --> 00:52:08,021
Thank you for coming.

978
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:12,298
- Hey! Fuck!
- Josh!

979
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,100
Are these people
really your friends?

980
00:52:14,138 --> 00:52:15,298
Because they're not normal.

981
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,705
You shouldn't be so sensitive.

982
00:52:16,741 --> 00:52:18,572
I'm so sorry.

983
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,272
Darling,
if you would like my advice...

984
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:23,109
No, we would not
like your advice.

985
00:52:23,147 --> 00:52:25,081
Not with that farce
you call a marriage.

986
00:52:25,116 --> 00:52:26,515
Stop it! Nigel!

987
00:52:26,551 --> 00:52:29,679
I will not stay in this house
one minute longer!

988
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:32,189
I'm timing you.

989
00:52:32,223 --> 00:52:34,851
59... 58...

990
00:52:34,893 --> 00:52:36,520
Shut up!

991
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:38,495
You are a nasty boy!

992
00:52:38,529 --> 00:52:42,488
55... 54... 53...

993
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:45,359
Sally, pick up the phone.

994
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:46,961
Sally.

995
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:49,030
Stop it, Nigel!

996
00:52:49,073 --> 00:52:51,667
Caroline, I'm a very nasty boy.

997
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:53,233
I want a divorce!

998
00:52:53,278 --> 00:52:55,007
Frank?

999
00:52:56,681 --> 00:52:58,740
You know things
are getting pretty bad...

1000
00:52:58,783 --> 00:53:00,944
when we have
the best marriage in the room.

1001
00:53:17,468 --> 00:53:21,302
I hope you don't think
you're going to sleep with me.

1002
00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:22,966
What?

1003
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:26,875
I hope you don't think
you're going to sleep with me.

1004
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,880
Actually,
it hadn't crossed my mind.

1005
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:32,075
Oh, really?

1006
00:53:32,116 --> 00:53:34,346
- I'm happily married.
- I know.

1007
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:37,183
That son of a bitch.
He's such a fucking...

1008
00:53:37,221 --> 00:53:39,086
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be talking like this.

1009
00:53:39,123 --> 00:53:41,387
We're all sorry.
You're sorry, right, Frank?

1010
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,451
I'm going to
take you home first, OK?

1011
00:53:43,494 --> 00:53:45,291
OK, thank you.

1012
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,558
Sarah...

1013
00:53:46,597 --> 00:53:48,588
No, Frank, please don't start.

1014
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:50,760
- I just...
- Forget it. Please?

1015
00:53:54,138 --> 00:53:56,606
So, what kind of work do you do?

1016
00:53:56,641 --> 00:54:00,133
Me? I'm a body double
for Demi Moore.

1017
00:54:00,178 --> 00:54:01,440
Really? That's really...

1018
00:54:01,479 --> 00:54:04,312
She believes me. Oh, my God.

1019
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:06,078
You didn't have to come with us.

1020
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,948
There's no reason
for this attitude.

1021
00:54:07,986 --> 00:54:09,715
Look, honey, I came with him.

1022
00:54:09,754 --> 00:54:12,746
Everybody else was sloshed,
stoned, or psychotic...

1023
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:14,758
and a cab in this town
is 50 bucks.

1024
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:17,488
Yada, yada, yada.
God, she goes on.

1025
00:54:17,528 --> 00:54:19,962
All right.
He'll take me home. Great.

1026
00:54:19,998 --> 00:54:21,329
Sarah, can I just...

1027
00:54:21,366 --> 00:54:24,563
Frank, no!
I'm OK. I'm really OK.

1028
00:54:24,602 --> 00:54:26,832
I do have control over my life.

1029
00:54:26,871 --> 00:54:28,668
It might not seem that way,
but I do.

1030
00:54:28,706 --> 00:54:30,003
I am not stupid.

1031
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:32,566
I know Joseph's an asshole,
but I married him.

1032
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:33,941
He's my asshole.

1033
00:54:35,913 --> 00:54:37,710
See that house?

1034
00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:39,580
I designed the landscaping.

1035
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:41,414
It's nice.

1036
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:43,420
It's better than nice.

1037
00:54:43,454 --> 00:54:45,547
The dopes that live there
don't deserve it.

1038
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:46,955
That's the rub,

1039
00:54:46,991 --> 00:54:49,687
that only rich people
can really afford...

1040
00:54:49,727 --> 00:54:51,354
property
that's worth landscaping...

1041
00:54:51,396 --> 00:54:53,023
but then they don't
even care about it.

1042
00:54:53,064 --> 00:54:55,692
It's like upkeep to them,
maintenance,

1043
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:59,100
like I'm changing
shingles on their roof.

1044
00:54:59,137 --> 00:55:01,765
So you're an artist, then.

1045
00:55:01,806 --> 00:55:03,774
Sometimes.

1046
00:55:03,808 --> 00:55:05,776
And the rest of the time?

1047
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,405
You mean,
what do I do for money?

1048
00:55:09,447 --> 00:55:12,439
I design landscaping.

1049
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:22,585
I like that green mushroom tree.

1050
00:55:22,627 --> 00:55:26,028
- It's an umbrella.
- You're kidding.

1051
00:55:26,064 --> 00:55:28,589
I did it for my wife.

1052
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:30,225
Does she know?

1053
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:32,998
I drove her by it once.

1054
00:55:33,037 --> 00:55:35,267
Like an inside joke, huh?

1055
00:55:35,306 --> 00:55:36,637
Sort of.

1056
00:55:39,977 --> 00:55:42,878
Did you ever think
that maybe you made a mistake?

1057
00:55:42,914 --> 00:55:44,541
What are you talking about?

1058
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:46,743
Marrying him.

1059
00:55:46,784 --> 00:55:48,752
How can you say that?
I loved him.

1060
00:55:48,786 --> 00:55:50,583
"Loved".
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1061
00:55:50,621 --> 00:55:52,020
That's past tense, you see?

1062
00:55:52,056 --> 00:55:53,523
Frank, stop.

1063
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,820
What...

1064
00:55:54,859 --> 00:55:58,989
- Sarah, I love you now.
- Hello!

1065
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,931
Frank, you got to understand.

1066
00:56:01,966 --> 00:56:04,059
We're just friends.
That's all we are.

1067
00:56:04,102 --> 00:56:06,764
Come on. We've always been
more than friends.

1068
00:56:06,804 --> 00:56:08,499
You know that as well as I do.

1069
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,905
And I want you now, OK?

1070
00:56:10,942 --> 00:56:13,502
You want me now
because now I'm taken.

1071
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:15,512
You only ever want what's taken.

1072
00:56:15,546 --> 00:56:16,979
That is such bullshit!

1073
00:56:17,014 --> 00:56:19,073
No, it isn't.
That's a pattern with you.

1074
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:21,051
You waited until after
we were married...

1075
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:22,848
I waited till you let me!

1076
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:24,149
- I let you?
- Yes!

1077
00:56:24,188 --> 00:56:25,587
How?

1078
00:56:28,126 --> 00:56:32,028
The day before the wedding,
when you kissed me.

1079
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:33,826
You kissed?

1080
00:56:33,865 --> 00:56:36,698
Does the bimbo
with your husband know...

1081
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:38,031
- Shut up!
- OK.

1082
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:40,401
Frank, that was just a kiss.

1083
00:56:46,644 --> 00:56:48,509
I'm only here...

1084
00:56:48,546 --> 00:56:51,379
because my best friend
is trying to fuck my wife.

1085
00:56:51,415 --> 00:56:53,713
Maybe he's in love with her.

1086
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:55,981
He doesn't really even know her.

1087
00:56:57,788 --> 00:56:59,255
Why not? You're best friends.

1088
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,281
They must see each other a lot.

1089
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:02,758
Yeah.

1090
00:57:04,061 --> 00:57:06,791
Then he does know her.

1091
00:57:06,831 --> 00:57:08,321
No.

1092
00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:13,798
She married me.

1093
00:57:21,379 --> 00:57:22,607
Oh, God.

1094
00:57:31,956 --> 00:57:34,117
She's probably with him
right now.

1095
00:57:34,158 --> 00:57:37,719
No. She's just not with me.

1096
00:57:37,762 --> 00:57:40,629
That's right. I'm with you.

1097
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,809
You really want me to pull over
and drop you off?

1098
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:54,333
Is that what you want?

1099
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,249
You people are unbelievable.

1100
00:58:00,284 --> 00:58:02,616
You just do this
to entertain yourselves?

1101
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:06,111
Don't answer that.
It's a rhetorical question.

1102
00:58:34,051 --> 00:58:36,019
Let's go to my bedroom.

1103
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:44,487
Let's go to my bedroom.

1104
00:58:44,528 --> 00:58:45,995
You know what?

1105
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,464
You're sweet, but this is...

1106
00:58:48,499 --> 00:58:50,228
You're fucked up.

1107
00:58:50,268 --> 00:58:54,364
No, I'm not. I'm 24,
and I don't give a shit.

1108
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,397
None of you mean anything to me.

1109
00:58:57,441 --> 00:58:59,170
That's sad.

1110
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,201
You would know.

1111
00:59:03,514 --> 00:59:06,005
I got to go. I'm sorry.

1112
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,129
Your husband
is a really hot property.

1113
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:36,037
Have you always known
that the big guy here...

1114
01:00:36,073 --> 01:00:37,404
was going to make it so big?

1115
01:00:37,441 --> 01:00:38,703
Of course.

1116
01:00:38,743 --> 01:00:40,938
It was just a matter of time
before Hollywood realized...

1117
01:00:40,978 --> 01:00:43,606
that adolescent wish fulfillment
was the way to go.

1118
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,875
Thanks, sweetie.

1119
01:00:44,915 --> 01:00:46,439
I'm in
the agent training program.

1120
01:00:46,484 --> 01:00:48,349
I heard he got half a mil.

1121
01:00:48,386 --> 01:00:52,288
- For a first spec script?
- Not bad.

1122
01:00:52,323 --> 01:00:54,188
Is it Duane or Wayne?

1123
01:00:54,225 --> 01:00:57,285
Who the fuck are these people?

1124
01:00:57,328 --> 01:00:58,920
I think she's on TV.

1125
01:00:58,963 --> 01:01:00,430
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:01:00,464 --> 01:01:02,489
I never slept with a girl
that's been on TV.

1127
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:06,560
That girl on "Jeopardy!"
What was her name?

1128
01:01:06,604 --> 01:01:09,164
That was after we broke up.

1129
01:01:09,206 --> 01:01:11,265
- I'm Sid.
- Amy.

1130
01:01:11,308 --> 01:01:13,105
Hi, Amy. How you doing?

1131
01:01:13,144 --> 01:01:15,772
I just...

1132
01:01:15,813 --> 01:01:18,179
You know how
when you're at a party...

1133
01:01:18,215 --> 01:01:20,809
you go from pocket
to pocket of people?

1134
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:23,183
You don't know these people.

1135
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,619
So I'm just hanging around,

1136
01:01:24,655 --> 01:01:26,282
waiting for a hole
in the conversation.

1137
01:01:26,323 --> 01:01:28,553
And you had to listen to how
I met my husband.

1138
01:01:28,592 --> 01:01:31,789
No. I'm glad to hear about
how you met your ex-husband.

1139
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,940
We should get the guys
together and go to Vegas.

1140
01:01:44,975 --> 01:01:47,500
- I'm serious.
- You'd want Duane to pay.

1141
01:01:47,545 --> 01:01:48,807
He would spring for it.

1142
01:01:48,846 --> 01:01:50,370
You just use your friends.

1143
01:01:50,414 --> 01:01:52,473
Don't you feel bad about
using your friends like that?

1144
01:01:52,516 --> 01:01:54,711
We would all be able to go.
We'd have a great time.

1145
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,310
Duane's made out of money now.

1146
01:01:56,353 --> 01:01:59,516
Let's just sap him
for everything he's worth?

1147
01:01:59,557 --> 01:02:01,616
The girl's a great part.

1148
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:03,559
Yeah, I actually wrote it...

1149
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:07,189
as sort of a cross between
my wife and Betty Rubble.

1150
01:02:07,231 --> 01:02:09,324
- Really?
- No, it's true.

1151
01:02:09,366 --> 01:02:12,767
I want to ask you something
about what you were saying.

1152
01:02:12,803 --> 01:02:14,998
Is that like...
Is that ancient history...

1153
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,939
or is that recent history?

1154
01:02:16,974 --> 01:02:19,135
- Do you need help?
- No, no.

1155
01:02:19,176 --> 01:02:21,974
I'm actually... Ancient enough.

1156
01:02:22,012 --> 01:02:25,243
Do I have to mingle,
or are you coming back?

1157
01:02:28,853 --> 01:02:31,720
You're really tan.

1158
01:02:31,755 --> 01:02:33,586
You go to the beach a lot?

1159
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,421
Yeah, I do.

1160
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:39,725
Out of curiosity,
do you shave or wax your legs?

1161
01:02:39,763 --> 01:02:41,128
I wax.

1162
01:02:41,165 --> 01:02:43,759
- Really?
- Yes.

1163
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,463
Bikini line?

1164
01:02:46,504 --> 01:02:49,496
I wax my bikini line, yes.

1165
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:52,134
Did you ever think,
what the fuck...

1166
01:02:52,176 --> 01:02:55,839
and just wax it all off?

1167
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,541
Actually, you know what?

1168
01:02:57,581 --> 01:03:00,880
That would be painful.

1169
01:03:00,918 --> 01:03:04,911
But I do shave the actual area
to get that kind of...

1170
01:03:04,955 --> 01:03:08,322
smooth effect.
You know what I mean?

1171
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:11,226
Does that make you
uncomfortable?

1172
01:03:11,262 --> 01:03:13,355
No.

1173
01:03:13,397 --> 01:03:16,628
It's kind of
an odd question, really.

1174
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,191
What makes the script so good...

1175
01:03:18,235 --> 01:03:21,068
is that it's the woman's movie,
yet it's still manly.

1176
01:03:21,105 --> 01:03:22,970
I'm a little new at
this script analysis stuff,

1177
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,565
but I think your husband
has something that...

1178
01:03:24,608 --> 01:03:25,939
Could you excuse me
for a minute?

1179
01:03:25,976 --> 01:03:27,773
Sure. I'll talk to you later.

1180
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:29,938
Haven't they locked you up yet?

1181
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,676
It's good to see you, too,
Deborah.

1182
01:03:32,716 --> 01:03:35,651
Frank, I realize
that crashing parties...

1183
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,018
is the only thing you have
for a social life,

1184
01:03:38,055 --> 01:03:39,249
but not tonight.

1185
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,588
I came to congratulate
my friend...

1186
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:45,117
and to give him this.
Is that OK with you?

1187
01:03:45,162 --> 01:03:47,722
It's a nice bottle.
Thanks, Frank.

1188
01:03:47,765 --> 01:03:50,666
I'm sure
Duane will appreciate it.

1189
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,998
Drive safely now, OK?

1190
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,697
Did I do something to you?

1191
01:03:53,737 --> 01:03:57,468
Get some help, Frank.
She's married.

1192
01:03:57,508 --> 01:03:59,738
Have a nice party, Deborah.

1193
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,872
Bye, Frank.

1194
01:04:08,552 --> 01:04:10,247
What's the film about?
What's it really about?

1195
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:11,686
What genre
does it take place in?

1196
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:14,589
What, the spine?
Like one sentence?

1197
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:17,287
"Boy meets girl".
I don't give a shit about that.

1198
01:04:17,328 --> 01:04:18,989
Fuck "Boy meets girl"
Fuck "Motorcycle movie".

1199
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:21,259
No. What is really being said?

1200
01:04:21,298 --> 01:04:22,731
That's what
you were talking about.

1201
01:04:22,766 --> 01:04:25,098
The whole idea, man,
is subversion -

1202
01:04:25,135 --> 01:04:27,365
you want subversion
on a massive level.

1203
01:04:27,404 --> 01:04:29,269
You know what one of
the greatest fucking scripts...

1204
01:04:29,306 --> 01:04:31,365
ever written in the history
of Hollywood is?

1205
01:04:31,408 --> 01:04:33,103
- What?
- "Top Gun".

1206
01:04:33,143 --> 01:04:35,805
- Come on.
- "Top Gun" is fucking great.

1207
01:04:35,846 --> 01:04:39,111
What is "Top Gun"? A story about
a bunch of fighter pilots?

1208
01:04:39,149 --> 01:04:42,175
It's about a bunch of guys
waving their dicks around.

1209
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:44,585
It is a story
about a man's struggle...

1210
01:04:44,622 --> 01:04:46,817
with his own homosexuality.

1211
01:04:46,857 --> 01:04:49,291
I'm serious.
That is what "Top Gun" is about.

1212
01:04:49,326 --> 01:04:51,226
You've got Maverick, all right?

1213
01:04:51,261 --> 01:04:52,421
He's on the edge, man.

1214
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:54,328
He's right on the fucking line.

1215
01:04:54,365 --> 01:04:56,856
And you got
Iceman and all his crew.

1216
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:00,165
They're gay.
They represent the gay man.

1217
01:05:00,204 --> 01:05:02,502
And they're saying,
"Go the gay way".

1218
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:04,063
He could go both ways.

1219
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,009
- What about Kelly McGillis?
- She's heterosexuality.

1220
01:05:07,044 --> 01:05:09,342
She's saying, "No, no, no.
Go the normal way."

1221
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,075
"Play by the rules.
Go the normal way".

1222
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,742
And they're saying,
"No. Go the gay way.

1223
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,478
"Be the gay way.
Go for the gay way".

1224
01:05:14,518 --> 01:05:16,884
That is what's going on
throughout that whole movie.

1225
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,218
What is this party?
Who are these people?

1226
01:05:19,256 --> 01:05:21,690
They make me sick. What is that?

1227
01:05:21,725 --> 01:05:25,821
Who are you? What is he wearing?

1228
01:05:25,863 --> 01:05:31,130
It's some dance jumpsuit,
freakish little gaucho...

1229
01:05:31,168 --> 01:05:35,264
"Let's go to Spain and dance
with our arms over our heads".

1230
01:05:35,305 --> 01:05:36,738
He goes to her house, right?

1231
01:05:36,774 --> 01:05:38,241
It looks like
they're going to have sex.

1232
01:05:38,275 --> 01:05:40,243
They're sitting back.
He's taking a shower.

1233
01:05:40,277 --> 01:05:41,403
They don't have sex.

1234
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:42,776
He gets on the motorcycle,
drives away.

1235
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:44,781
She's like, "What the fuck
is going on here?"

1236
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:48,581
Next scene you see her,
she's in the elevator.

1237
01:05:48,619 --> 01:05:49,881
She is dressed like a guy!

1238
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,855
She's got the cap on,
the aviator glasses,

1239
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:55,654
she's wearing the same jacket
that the Iceman wears.

1240
01:05:55,693 --> 01:05:57,593
She says, "This is
how I'm going to get this guy."

1241
01:05:57,628 --> 01:05:59,027
"This guy's going towards
the gay way.

1242
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:01,327
"So I gotta bring him back
from the gay way.

1243
01:06:01,365 --> 01:06:03,060
"So I'll do that
through subterfuge.

1244
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,590
"I'll dress like a man".

1245
01:06:04,635 --> 01:06:08,594
That is how she approaches it.

1246
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:12,575
Let me ask you - if I may digress
for two seconds here...

1247
01:06:12,609 --> 01:06:14,577
I met this girl Amy here.

1248
01:06:14,611 --> 01:06:16,408
She's floating around here
and everything.

1249
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,415
She just got divorced, right?

1250
01:06:18,449 --> 01:06:21,577
I saw you on... What was it?

1251
01:06:21,618 --> 01:06:22,983
I was asking my friend.

1252
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,612
I can't remember.

1253
01:06:24,655 --> 01:06:26,316
You know...

1254
01:06:26,356 --> 01:06:28,722
There's just a little...

1255
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,521
I'm... I'm lucky.

1256
01:06:35,566 --> 01:06:37,124
We're going to drink
a pot of coffee...

1257
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:39,135
and then drive to Vegas.
You want to go?

1258
01:06:39,169 --> 01:06:41,831
- What's her problem?
- She doesn't want to go.

1259
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,999
She doesn't like to gamble.

1260
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,921
- Hang on.
- Sorry.

1261
01:07:18,842 --> 01:07:20,810
We need to have a little talk.

1262
01:07:20,844 --> 01:07:23,870
I know, but this
really isn't the best time.

1263
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,814
Is this inconvenient for you?

1264
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:27,180
I could leave if you'd like.

1265
01:07:27,217 --> 01:07:31,119
- I'll call you.
- Should I come back? OK.

1266
01:07:31,155 --> 01:07:32,417
What are you doing?

1267
01:07:32,456 --> 01:07:34,981
You answer me one thing.
Right now.

1268
01:07:35,025 --> 01:07:37,323
Maybe it was my imagination,
or maybe I dreamt it,

1269
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:38,919
but was it not
exactly six days ago...

1270
01:07:38,962 --> 01:07:40,361
that we made
the most incredible love...

1271
01:07:40,397 --> 01:07:41,887
and you told me
that you loved me?

1272
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,422
Was it or not?

1273
01:07:44,701 --> 01:07:45,998
Sarah, how's it going?

1274
01:07:46,036 --> 01:07:47,196
- Hi.
- You having a good time?

1275
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:48,898
Oh, yeah.

1276
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:51,271
Can I double-check
something with you?

1277
01:07:51,308 --> 01:07:54,243
Do you see anything in my teeth?

1278
01:07:55,712 --> 01:07:57,612
No.

1279
01:07:57,648 --> 01:08:00,708
I didn't, either.
Nice schmooze-fest, huh?

1280
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:03,850
Is everything OK?

1281
01:08:03,887 --> 01:08:07,118
Great. I'm just hanging.

1282
01:08:07,157 --> 01:08:10,217
Oh, OK.

1283
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,887
- All right.
- Yeah.

1284
01:08:11,929 --> 01:08:15,262
- See you later.
- OK. Bye, Rory.

1285
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,358
Bye.

1286
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:21,162
You have to go now.

1287
01:08:21,205 --> 01:08:24,436
Did it happen or not?

1288
01:08:24,474 --> 01:08:26,135
It happened.

1289
01:08:26,176 --> 01:08:27,438
Well, thank God,

1290
01:08:27,477 --> 01:08:30,412
because I was starting
to think I went insane.

1291
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:33,473
I told you I need some time.

1292
01:08:34,885 --> 01:08:38,321
Sarah, it doesn't take six days
to pack your bags.

1293
01:08:38,355 --> 01:08:40,050
It does if
you keep unpacking them.

1294
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,421
It's right through there.

1295
01:08:43,694 --> 01:08:44,888
You waiting?

1296
01:08:44,928 --> 01:08:47,089
Waiting? Yeah!

1297
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:50,463
And after that,
I'm going back into the party...

1298
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,936
and I'm not going
to talk to you again tonight.

1299
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:56,940
OK.

1300
01:08:56,974 --> 01:08:58,464
Do I know you?

1301
01:09:00,143 --> 01:09:01,633
No.

1302
01:09:03,247 --> 01:09:04,578
OK.

1303
01:09:09,853 --> 01:09:11,616
Yeah.

1304
01:09:11,655 --> 01:09:13,748
Yeah, I'm still here.

1305
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:17,783
Jesus Christ! God!

1306
01:09:19,663 --> 01:09:22,632
There's a man with a beard
coming through the window!

1307
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:27,330
Jesus! Jesus Christ! No, I'm...

1308
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:29,805
Sarah,
I'm not leaving without you.

1309
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,933
Dennis Hopper just climbed
through the window.

1310
01:09:31,975 --> 01:09:35,240
- You can't keep doing this!
- Doing what?

1311
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,679
Hiding the fact that your
marriage is a piece of paper...

1312
01:09:37,714 --> 01:09:39,545
and you and I
are flesh and blood!

1313
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:41,050
This is something
out of "Fatal Attraction".

1314
01:09:41,084 --> 01:09:43,177
No. There's this weird woman
in the bathroom.

1315
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,188
Excuse me, but could you
take that outside?

1316
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,281
I'm waiting
to go to the bathroom.

1317
01:09:47,324 --> 01:09:50,657
- Could you please get out?
- Out! Come here.

1318
01:09:50,694 --> 01:09:52,787
Thank you very, very much!

1319
01:09:52,829 --> 01:09:55,024
Look, come here.

1320
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:57,033
What the hell's the matter
with you?

1321
01:09:57,067 --> 01:10:00,366
Yeah, OK, so we slept together.

1322
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:03,567
It was great,
but that doesn't mean...

1323
01:10:03,607 --> 01:10:06,371
it wasn't a huge mistake,
you know?

1324
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,934
That's what you call it?
A mistake?

1325
01:10:07,978 --> 01:10:10,412
Look at us right now.
We're in Duane's bathroom,

1326
01:10:10,447 --> 01:10:12,347
at a party
you weren't invited to.

1327
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:14,282
I think this qualifies
as a mistake.

1328
01:10:14,318 --> 01:10:15,444
Then why did you sleep with me?

1329
01:10:15,485 --> 01:10:17,953
Why did you tell me
about the green umbrella?

1330
01:10:17,988 --> 01:10:19,148
You asked me about it.

1331
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:21,521
No, you forced me to.
And you want to know what?

1332
01:10:21,558 --> 01:10:23,685
We aren't talking about
your umbrella or Joe's umbrella.

1333
01:10:23,727 --> 01:10:25,388
We're talking about
my fucking umbrella.

1334
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:29,092
And it wasn't even my umbrella.
It belonged to my friend.

1335
01:10:29,132 --> 01:10:30,895
I don't give a shit
about the umbrella!

1336
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:33,994
I'm in love with you.
Don't you understand that?

1337
01:10:34,037 --> 01:10:35,231
That doesn't give you
the license...

1338
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:36,967
to do any stupid thing
that comes into your head.

1339
01:10:37,007 --> 01:10:38,838
This is not stupid.

1340
01:10:41,478 --> 01:10:45,642
I just... I'm sorry.

1341
01:10:45,682 --> 01:10:48,913
I want to kiss you
without feeling guilty.

1342
01:10:48,952 --> 01:10:50,476
You know?

1343
01:10:52,089 --> 01:10:54,717
All right. Fair enough.

1344
01:10:54,758 --> 01:10:58,091
How much time do you need?

1345
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:00,926
Would you go away?

1346
01:11:00,964 --> 01:11:02,591
Honey?

1347
01:11:04,968 --> 01:11:07,402
I'm sorry. I thought
you were the phone guy.

1348
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:11,339
I'll be right out.

1349
01:11:12,576 --> 01:11:14,737
Honey, I want to get out
of here pretty soon.

1350
01:11:14,778 --> 01:11:18,441
I'll meet you at the front door
in a few minutes.

1351
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:21,577
Are you all right?

1352
01:11:21,618 --> 01:11:25,349
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

1353
01:11:25,389 --> 01:11:28,290
I'm fine. I just...
I have a little...

1354
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:30,316
Could you have Deborah
come here?

1355
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,328
Honey, what's going on?

1356
01:11:32,362 --> 01:11:35,889
It's a woman thing, honey.
You don't want to know.

1357
01:11:37,234 --> 01:11:38,531
OK.

1358
01:11:38,568 --> 01:11:39,933
OK.

1359
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,378
You've got to get out.

1360
01:11:51,415 --> 01:11:52,780
Where am I going to go?

1361
01:11:54,951 --> 01:11:58,114
Get in. Get back in there!

1362
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,332
- Hello?
- Hi.

1363
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:11,493
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1364
01:12:14,738 --> 01:12:16,933
- Frank?
- Yeah.

1365
01:12:20,243 --> 01:12:22,108
Frank, come out here.

1366
01:12:23,447 --> 01:12:24,937
Frank!

1367
01:12:32,589 --> 01:12:35,387
Frank,
go out the way you came in.

1368
01:12:35,425 --> 01:12:37,723
I'll call you.

1369
01:12:39,362 --> 01:12:40,624
Thanks for having me.

1370
01:12:40,664 --> 01:12:42,894
Thanks for stopping by.

1371
01:12:42,933 --> 01:12:45,527
Are you OK?

1372
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,696
Yeah.

1373
01:12:47,737 --> 01:12:49,728
Fuck, I don't know what I am.

1374
01:12:49,773 --> 01:12:51,434
Hi.

1375
01:12:54,811 --> 01:12:56,369
What's happening?

1376
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:59,849
My life is fucked.

1377
01:12:59,883 --> 01:13:01,077
But the real ending
of the movie...

1378
01:13:01,118 --> 01:13:03,018
is when they fight the MIGs
at the end.

1379
01:13:03,053 --> 01:13:05,180
Because he has passed over
into the gay way.

1380
01:13:05,222 --> 01:13:07,986
They are this gay
fighting fucking force,

1381
01:13:08,024 --> 01:13:10,857
and they're
beating the Russians.

1382
01:13:10,894 --> 01:13:13,124
And it's over,
and they fucking land,

1383
01:13:13,163 --> 01:13:15,859
and Iceman's been trying
to get Maverick the entire time.

1384
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:17,491
Finally, he's got him,
all right?

1385
01:13:17,534 --> 01:13:19,866
What is the last fucking line
that they have together?

1386
01:13:19,903 --> 01:13:22,030
They're all hugging
and kissing and happy,

1387
01:13:22,072 --> 01:13:24,165
and Ice comes up to Maverick,
and he says...

1388
01:13:24,207 --> 01:13:28,007
"Man, you can
ride my tail anytime"!

1389
01:13:28,044 --> 01:13:29,534
And what does Maverick say?

1390
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:31,672
"You can ride mine"!

1391
01:13:31,715 --> 01:13:36,118
Sword fight! Sword fight!

1392
01:13:36,153 --> 01:13:39,418
- Fucking "A," man!
- Yeah!

1393
01:13:58,542 --> 01:14:02,000
Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me.

1394
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:04,536
I thought this was your car.

1395
01:14:04,581 --> 01:14:07,607
I didn't see you at the party.

1396
01:14:09,886 --> 01:14:13,185
Deborah wouldn't let me in.

1397
01:14:13,223 --> 01:14:15,418
Really?

1398
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,255
Yeah.

1399
01:14:17,294 --> 01:14:18,852
I love Deborah.

1400
01:14:20,163 --> 01:14:24,657
She's a little abrasive
sometimes, don't you think?

1401
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:26,100
Yeah.

1402
01:14:28,772 --> 01:14:30,797
I wonder how
Duane puts up with her.

1403
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,468
Yeah, or how
she puts up with him, huh?

1404
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:38,004
Yeah. They're married.

1405
01:14:39,282 --> 01:14:46,017
That's part of
what marriage is - putting up.

1406
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:52,219
No, thanks. I got my own.

1407
01:14:55,732 --> 01:14:58,462
To old friends.

1408
01:15:12,282 --> 01:15:14,842
Your car needs some work, man.

1409
01:15:14,884 --> 01:15:17,682
Yeah, it could definitely use
a new interior.

1410
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:21,054
You never knew how
to take care of your stuff, man.

1411
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:26,820
Well, I...

1412
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,924
What about that...

1413
01:15:31,968 --> 01:15:34,198
that motorcycle you had...

1414
01:15:34,237 --> 01:15:39,504
with the little speakers on it
and the fuzzy seats?

1415
01:15:41,544 --> 01:15:43,842
That thing was trashed.

1416
01:15:46,116 --> 01:15:47,310
Yeah.

1417
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:50,410
- What was it like?
- What?

1418
01:15:52,155 --> 01:15:54,180
Sleeping with my wife.

1419
01:15:56,326 --> 01:15:58,556
Huh?

1420
01:16:01,398 --> 01:16:03,025
Huh?

1421
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:06,660
What was it like?

1422
01:16:08,538 --> 01:16:10,369
It's OK, man. She told me.

1423
01:16:10,407 --> 01:16:13,001
I just want
to know what it was like.

1424
01:16:16,212 --> 01:16:17,406
I'm in love with her, Joseph.

1425
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:19,972
I know that.

1426
01:16:20,016 --> 01:16:23,110
You've made that
abundantly clear.

1427
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:28,617
I should have told you...

1428
01:16:28,658 --> 01:16:31,183
No, you should not have
fucked her!

1429
01:16:31,227 --> 01:16:32,592
That's what
you shouldn't have done!

1430
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:34,995
I didn't fuck her.
I made love to her.

1431
01:16:35,031 --> 01:16:36,521
- Really?
- Yes.

1432
01:16:36,566 --> 01:16:38,295
So sweet. Why don't you
shut up for a minute?

1433
01:16:38,335 --> 01:16:40,667
Why don't you shut up?

1434
01:16:40,704 --> 01:16:43,070
I'm not the only one involved.
It was her choice!

1435
01:16:43,106 --> 01:16:45,074
Really? Is that so?

1436
01:16:45,108 --> 01:16:46,973
I seem to remember
her choosing me,

1437
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:48,210
but maybe I got it wrong here.

1438
01:16:48,244 --> 01:16:50,439
Maybe I should
go ask her right now.

1439
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,573
Why do you want
to make a big show of this?

1440
01:16:52,615 --> 01:16:54,549
Maybe I should go ask her.
We're all here.

1441
01:16:54,584 --> 01:16:58,577
We can fucking get this out
right now, all right?

1442
01:16:58,621 --> 01:17:00,248
Joseph!

1443
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:02,724
Joseph, Joseph.

1444
01:17:02,759 --> 01:17:04,056
What are you doing?

1445
01:17:04,094 --> 01:17:06,528
Were you able
to stop yourself, Frank?

1446
01:17:09,299 --> 01:17:11,494
- Sarah?
- This isn't going to help.

1447
01:17:11,534 --> 01:17:13,399
- Joe.
- Sarah?

1448
01:17:13,436 --> 01:17:15,700
It's your
lawful-wedded husband here!

1449
01:17:15,739 --> 01:17:17,104
I think it's time
we had a little talk!

1450
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,368
Get the fuck off!

1451
01:17:18,408 --> 01:17:21,036
Sarah,
get your little ass out here!

1452
01:17:21,077 --> 01:17:22,635
Kick his ass!

1453
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:25,204
Stop it! What are you doing?

1454
01:17:25,248 --> 01:17:28,843
Stop it. What's your problem?
Do you have something...

1455
01:17:28,885 --> 01:17:31,376
Frank over here informed me
that you chose him,

1456
01:17:31,421 --> 01:17:32,854
which I find
a little confusing...

1457
01:17:32,889 --> 01:17:34,117
because I seem to remember
you marrying me,

1458
01:17:34,157 --> 01:17:36,250
but apparently he was
the last one to fuck you,

1459
01:17:36,292 --> 01:17:38,760
so maybe I'm wrong!

1460
01:17:39,929 --> 01:17:41,920
Take it home, guy.

1461
01:17:41,965 --> 01:17:46,664
In case anybody didn't get that,
my husband over here...

1462
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:48,728
wants to know why
I fucked Frank over here.

1463
01:17:48,772 --> 01:17:51,366
He seems to think
that if he humiliates me,

1464
01:17:51,408 --> 01:17:54,206
it will put me in
my fucking little place.

1465
01:17:54,244 --> 01:17:55,802
But what
you don't understand, buddy,

1466
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:58,780
is I don't give a fuck,
because as far as I'm concerned,

1467
01:17:58,815 --> 01:18:00,510
this marriage is over!

1468
01:18:03,753 --> 01:18:05,311
Happy now?

1469
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:10,018
What about you?
Isn't this what you wanted?

1470
01:18:10,059 --> 01:18:11,924
What do you think?

1471
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:14,293
Then who the hell's happy here?

1472
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:15,627
What, is it you?

1473
01:18:15,665 --> 01:18:17,633
Frank, are you
the happy guy here?

1474
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:20,067
Right. I'm sorry.
You happened to fall in love.

1475
01:18:20,103 --> 01:18:21,627
I don't want
to stand in the way...

1476
01:18:21,671 --> 01:18:23,434
of my two best friends
falling in love,

1477
01:18:23,473 --> 01:18:25,566
so you guys go off
and live happily ever after.

1478
01:18:25,608 --> 01:18:28,941
Joseph, fuck you. I married you.

1479
01:18:28,978 --> 01:18:31,173
Then why did you fuck him?

1480
01:18:31,214 --> 01:18:35,014
What about that fucking slut
you left that party with?

1481
01:18:35,051 --> 01:18:37,383
Listen to me.
I did not fuck her.

1482
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:40,014
I could have, but I didn't.

1483
01:18:43,293 --> 01:18:45,090
Give me the keys.

1484
01:18:46,629 --> 01:18:48,153
What?

1485
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:49,563
It's my car. Give me the keys.

1486
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,863
We're starting
the distribution of property?

1487
01:18:51,901 --> 01:18:54,836
Give me the fucking keys!

1488
01:18:54,871 --> 01:18:56,099
Honey, where are you going?

1489
01:18:56,139 --> 01:18:57,800
Wherever the fuck I want!

1490
01:18:57,841 --> 01:19:02,039
- Sarah!
- Frank, I'm sorry.

1491
01:19:02,078 --> 01:19:05,514
This isn't me, you know.
You did this!

1492
01:19:16,125 --> 01:19:17,615
I'm sorry, Joe.

1493
01:19:19,128 --> 01:19:22,097
That's really special, Frank.
You fuck my wife,

1494
01:19:22,131 --> 01:19:23,530
ruin my marriage, she dumps you,

1495
01:19:23,566 --> 01:19:26,126
but the important thing
is that you feel bad.

1496
01:19:31,574 --> 01:19:33,474
She stopped at the light.

1497
01:19:50,493 --> 01:19:52,484
You son of a bitch.

1498
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:11,013
Sarah!

1499
01:20:13,449 --> 01:20:15,110
Oh, God.

1500
01:20:22,926 --> 01:20:24,257
Get in.

1501
01:20:43,379 --> 01:20:47,179
Do you ever think that we have
too much time on our hands?

1502
01:20:47,216 --> 01:20:48,649
With all the advances
we've made...

1503
01:20:48,685 --> 01:20:50,585
in extending
the human life span...

1504
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:53,851
that perhaps
nature's cruelest irony...

1505
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:58,088
is that we get progressively
stupider and stupider...

1506
01:20:58,127 --> 01:21:00,652
with each passing generation?

1507
01:21:00,697 --> 01:21:05,430
Someday,
we'll live for 300 years...

1508
01:21:05,468 --> 01:21:10,235
but we won't be able
to sit still for five seconds.

1509
01:21:13,176 --> 01:21:14,973
Just a thought.

1510
01:25:59,474 --> 01:26:07,474
