1
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:41,613
Hey.

2
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:43,683
You're home early.

3
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,219
Yes.

4
00:00:46,887 --> 00:00:48,789
I thought you were showing
a house today.

5
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:50,690
I canceled it.

6
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:54,327
Um. Is everything okay?

7
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:57,430
It will be.

8
00:00:58,833 --> 00:00:59,833
I hope.

9
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:03,770
Did something happen to Anna?

10
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:05,906
No, she's fine.

11
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:09,810
So...

12
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:12,545
What's going on?

13
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,049
I know about you and Vivienne.

14
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:18,117
Who?

15
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,473
- I can explain.
- I don't want to hear your explanation.

16
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:42,675
I want you to listen to me.

17
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:46,045
Sit down.

18
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,761
You know, this is
not what it looks like.

19
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,397
Sure it is.

20
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:06,901
You've been fucking
a woman named Vivienne.

21
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:11,404
She's one of your
creative writing students.

22
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:15,943
Does she know you're married?

23
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:19,313
I'm so fucking sorry.

24
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:21,714
I'm gonna make this easy on you.

25
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:24,184
I'm not divorcing you.

26
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:32,359
I love our family and I love
the life that we've built

27
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:34,560
and I'm not throwing it away.

28
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:36,696
We can get therapy.

29
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:37,931
First,

30
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,934
you will never
see Vivienne again.

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,635
Other than to tell her
that it's over.

32
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:45,139
- Of course.
- Second...

33
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:48,474
Neither of us
will mention this to Anna.

34
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:54,181
Well, I agree with that.

35
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:57,483
Third, we're going
on a vacation.

36
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:01,822
- A what?
- A family vacation.

37
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:04,757
You, me and Anna.

38
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:10,530
- Okay.
- Our life, our... family,

39
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:13,067
it means more to me
than anything in the world.

40
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,569
Me too.

41
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:18,338
Now...

42
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:23,143
Go pick up Anna
from soccer practice, please.

43
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:30,086
I still don't understand why
I have to come with you guys.

44
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,279
'Cause you're too young
to leave at home.

45
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:36,016
Are we almost there?

46
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,384
It's a surprise.

47
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,928
You know how I can tell
you picked this place

48
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,354
- and not dad?
- Hmm?

49
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:42,523
Because it's hot,
it's in the middle of nowhere

50
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:43,622
and it's boring.

51
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:46,493
You know what they say, honey.
"There are no boring places.

52
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,594
- Only boring people."
- "Boring people."

53
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:50,129
That's right.

54
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:53,167
You know, if I were her age,
I wouldn't really wanna spend

55
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,334
a week out here either.

56
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:56,569
Well, thanks
for humoring me then.

57
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,604
No, I didn't mean it like that.
I just...

58
00:04:58,671 --> 00:04:59,772
I'm sure you did.

59
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:05,044
Hey.

60
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:07,881
I... I'm trying.

61
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,217
Try harder.

62
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:18,691
Whoa.

63
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,730
Wait until you see the pool.

64
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Holy shit.

65
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,856
Language.

66
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:52,860
No, but I mean, get real, dad.
This place is huge.

67
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,561
This is really
where we're staying?

68
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,797
I've been talking
about coming here for months.

69
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:59,366
I even showed it to you online
and said I wanted to visit.

70
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,870
- You don't remember, do you?
- Uh. Um.

71
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,538
Yeah, well,

72
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:06,344
the owner's selling it
and hired my agency

73
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,441
to handle the details.

74
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:08,785
It goes on the market
in a month.

75
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:10,878
In the meantime,
they're letting us stay.

76
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:12,579
They've been using it
as a rental.

77
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,915
I told you that too,
but you don't remember.

78
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:19,586
Who'd own a house
like this way out here?

79
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,290
Someone very rich
and very tired of other people.

80
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:24,357
Get the bags.

81
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:54,421
It's beautiful.

82
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,057
Not so boring now, is it?

83
00:06:58,225 --> 00:06:59,560
Is the person selling this house

84
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:00,726
really old or something?

85
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:04,131
To be honest, I don't know
who owns this house.

86
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,033
It's part of a trust.

87
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,634
Two hundred acres of land.

88
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:09,846
Everything was done
through an intermediary.

89
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,105
They specifically asked me
to handle the listing.

90
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,077
Come on, tub tub.

91
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:18,612
Hi, baby.

92
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,614
Don't let tub tub loose outside.

93
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:22,316
There are coyotes here.

94
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:24,583
Oh, can I pick my own bedroom?

95
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:26,320
Sure. They're upstairs.

96
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,288
What now?

97
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:35,862
I need to set up the camera
for the virtual tour.

98
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:38,165
Sorry about the floor.

99
00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:00,254
Jesus Christ.

100
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:05,058
I could use a drink.

101
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:13,233
There's a store
about 20 miles up the road.

102
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,334
I saw a sign.

103
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:21,108
We can get groceries and wine.

104
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,811
I was thinking of cooking
veal cutlets tonight.

105
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:28,081
Or I could grill burgers.

106
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,018
Anna and I hate veal.

107
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:39,926
Great.

108
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,296
Veal cutlets it is.

109
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:49,569
You know,
just 'cause I messed up,

110
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:50,637
don't be spiteful.

111
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:51,838
Oh.

112
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,074
I'm being spiteful?

113
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,350
I really don't know
what the rules are anymore.

114
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:12,059
Well, it was your idea
to come here.

115
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:13,593
And you're lucky

116
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,937
because the other
option's divorce

117
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:17,130
and I don't think that'd
work out too well for you.

118
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:19,633
Yeah, you would take Anna
and the money.

119
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:22,969
- I've heard the threats before.
- Then they must be true.

120
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:27,174
I hate this.

121
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:30,576
Same.

122
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,416
You know what?
I need a drink too.

123
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:38,952
Go get food and wine.

124
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:46,993
Anna, come on.
Mom wants us to run an errand.

125
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:50,397
- Oh, come on, I'm having fun.
- Yeah, I know.

126
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:53,867
Yeah, here.

127
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:05,512
Need a little help.

128
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,122
Wow.

129
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:55,729
Looks like we're
the city slickers around here.

130
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,731
We're city slickers
everywhere, dad.

131
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,807
- What? You're not gonna help me shop?
- Sorry, dad.

132
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,979
Vintage fashion magazines
are more interesting.

133
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,661
- Oh.
- What do you want me to do?

134
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:11,311
Okay.

135
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:48,315
Hey.

136
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,583
What you reading?

137
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:52,685
Nothing.

138
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,588
Where you from?

139
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:57,991
Houston.

140
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,127
Wow. That far?

141
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:06,566
My name's Isaac.

142
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:10,636
I'm Anna.

143
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:13,240
You know what, Anna?

144
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,342
You look a lot
like my ex-girlfriend.

145
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:18,411
- I do?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,313
Way cuter, though.

147
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,119
Where are you
and your dad staying?

148
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:27,454
I saw you come in with him.

149
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:29,256
My mom's here with us too.

150
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:32,125
They're not getting along.

151
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,460
They mean to you?

152
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:36,196
No. They're fine.

153
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:41,501
Um. We're staying at this big,
old house on the water

154
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,103
in the middle of nowhere.

155
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:46,807
I think I know it.
Uh. About 20 miles east?

156
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:51,244
Yeah, I think so. My dad drove.

157
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,146
So...

158
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,648
How old are you?

159
00:12:56,616 --> 00:12:57,617
I'm almost 15.

160
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:01,488
Really? You look a lot older.

161
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:11,097
We should get
some ice cream sometime.

162
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:14,367
I'm 18. I'll drive.

163
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,751
- Who were you talking to?
- Hmm?

164
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,320
You making friends over there?

165
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:34,855
Shut up.

166
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,260
- Register's broken.
- Uh-huh.

167
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:44,764
Hey.

168
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:46,877
You wanna help me
bag these things up?

169
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:47,901
Yeah.

170
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:52,172
You know, your mom said
you'd like it here.

171
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:54,574
Didn't she also say to get veal?

172
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,576
Well, they didn't have any.

173
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,316
Oh, look at this.

174
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,417
Pop rocks.

175
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,719
Those are nasty.

176
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:08,799
What are you talking about?
You used to love these things.

177
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:10,523
Yeah, when I was like ten.

178
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,898
- Come on, dad.
- Hey, you know what?

179
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:14,693
Add those.

180
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:16,629
All right.

181
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:19,834
Comes to 58 dollars
and six cents.

182
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:22,602
That is 60.

183
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:24,603
Keep the change.

184
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:29,475
Thank you.

185
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,578
Oh, here, you got it.

186
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:42,389
Dad, you okay?

187
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:48,161
Um.

188
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,298
Did that old guy
seem odd to you?

189
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,802
No, I don't think so. Why?

190
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:58,338
Maybe there's somewhere
closer to the house we can shop.

191
00:14:58,505 --> 00:15:00,373
Oh, I don't mind
if we have to come back here.

192
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:23,563
- Dad.
- Yeah?

193
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,199
- I got a weird question.
- Shoot.

194
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:30,370
Is everything okay
with you and mom?

195
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,373
Okay in what way?

196
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:34,842
Don't do that.

197
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,309
- Don't...
- Don't deflect.

198
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:39,412
That's what mom does.
Can you just be honest?

199
00:15:41,182 --> 00:15:42,582
Marriage is really hard work.

200
00:15:42,716 --> 00:15:45,820
And sometimes, it doesn't go
in the direction you hoped.

201
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:49,622
- Are you guys getting a divorce?
- No.

202
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:51,591
- No. No, no, no.
- Don't have to freak out.

203
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,693
- It's fine. I don't care.
- Who's freaking out?

204
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,197
It's just, like, all my friends'
parents are divorced.

205
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:57,306
- Listen.
- It's not a big deal.

206
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,432
- I...
- Let's not think like that, okay?

207
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,500
Well...

208
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,403
I love you both.

209
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:06,173
- I just want you to know.
- Good.

210
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:08,742
You know,
sometimes I think to myself,

211
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:11,212
"how did I get
such a wise daughter?"

212
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:13,613
And then I think,

213
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:16,549
"wow, she probably has
a really wise dad."

214
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,585
Oh, I don't know about that.

215
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,253
Get out.

216
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,163
Maybe Toby needs a friend.

217
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:30,630
That'd be awesome.

218
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:36,003
- Mom?
- Jess?

219
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,105
Mom?

220
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,674
Jess?

221
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:46,746
Mom?

222
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,183
This... this fucking thing
won't open.

223
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:50,350
Language.

224
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,585
- Door won't open?
- No, a manhole cover

225
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:54,621
in lower Manhattan.
Yes, the door.

226
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,793
I have to get inside
for the virtual tour.

227
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:00,127
But don't you have a key?

228
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,729
Yeah, to the house,
the... the pool shed,

229
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:04,531
the mailbox,
but not for this door.

230
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:05,866
Jess, let... let me help.

231
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:06,933
Let me give it a shot.

232
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:13,841
Okay.

233
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,085
Yeah, that thing's not opening.

234
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:27,320
- Yeah.
- Do you want me to kick it down?

235
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,323
Hmm. Not yet.

236
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,125
Did you get the veal?

237
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,128
They didn't have any.

238
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,896
So, what did you get instead?

239
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:39,432
Burger meat for grilling.

240
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:41,768
Let me see something.

241
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,544
No sunlight gets in.

242
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,413
That's weird.

243
00:17:58,052 --> 00:18:00,386
This room
wasn't on the blueprint.

244
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:04,390
I... I think it's,
like, a storage room

245
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:07,660
or maybe a... a panic room.

246
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,764
Freaky.

247
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:17,370
I'll get it.

248
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:31,284
Can I help you?

249
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,652
Yeah. So you're Anna's mom.

250
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:34,787
Who's asking?

251
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,689
Oh, I'm Isaac.
I'm... I'm a friend.

252
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:38,292
A friend of Anna's?

253
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:41,061
I met her at my grandpappy's
grocery store today.

254
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:42,528
Uh-huh. And?

255
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,764
Well, I was just stopping
to invite you

256
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,834
and your family to dinner.

257
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:49,203
We're your nearest neighbors,
just a few miles that way.

258
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:51,471
That's very sweet of you, Isaac.

259
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:52,672
Um.

260
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:54,507
I'm sorry, we have other plans.

261
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:57,577
We're on a family vacation.
I'm sure you understand.

262
00:18:57,644 --> 00:19:00,413
I do. I do.
But if you change your mind,

263
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:01,791
we're having
veal cutlets tonight.

264
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:03,183
We got a lot in at the store.

265
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,921
Veal cutlets, at your store?

266
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:07,720
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:09,555
W... we got a huge
shipment in yesterday.

268
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:11,825
They're on display.
No one could miss 'em.

269
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:16,363
Give me your address, Isaac.

270
00:19:16,763 --> 00:19:19,565
On second thought,
we would love to join you.

271
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:49,897
<i>I'm telling you,</i>

272
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,332
I didn't see it.

273
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:55,102
Or maybe he's lying
about the stupid cutlets.

274
00:19:55,468 --> 00:19:57,237
He's not lying. You are.

275
00:19:57,805 --> 00:20:00,174
Why would you trust
some stranger over me?

276
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:04,078
I didn't wanna say anything...

277
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:07,915
But the old man at the store...

278
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:11,684
- He wrote this on my receipt.
- Hmm.

279
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,855
"You're being watched
by the devil."

280
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:19,592
- He's probably making a joke or...
- I don't wanna have dinner

281
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:22,262
with some creepy locals
just so you can prove a point.

282
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,696
Well... neither do I.

283
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,833
Okay, then.
Would you knock this stuff off?

284
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:28,902
- Come on. You are beautiful.
- What is wrong with you?

285
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:31,717
Why couldn't you buy
the veal like I asked?

286
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:34,574
- I am telling you, I didn't see it.
- Sure you did.

287
00:20:34,674 --> 00:20:37,011
But you hate veal,
so you didn't buy it.

288
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:39,013
Because you do
exactly what you want

289
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,646
and damn the consequences.

290
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:43,851
You're not just
talking about veal.

291
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,053
Wow, what a genius you are.

292
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:53,559
You know, Anna hates veal too.

293
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,330
But you never think about her.

294
00:20:56,696 --> 00:20:59,400
She's all I think about.

295
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,467
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

296
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:03,170
I think she would be
very surprised to hear that.

297
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,571
So, now, I'm a bad parent?
Not you?

298
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:08,175
N... not the cheater.
Never you. No, no, no.

299
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:12,046
You're the nice one
and I'm the asshole.

300
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:13,480
Isn't that right?

301
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:15,949
Isn't that how
you try to manipulate Anna

302
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:17,284
into seeing us?

303
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:20,354
I'm not gonna stay here
and get emotionally abused.

304
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:21,754
Then go to your whore.

305
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:23,924
You know, at least
she made me feel good

306
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,991
about myself.

307
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:27,660
You make me feel
like slitting my wrists.

308
00:21:31,564 --> 00:21:33,333
Then fucking do it.

309
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:38,704
You... broke my heart.

310
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:41,141
Oh, my god.

311
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:55,655
I loved you. I love you.

312
00:21:56,557 --> 00:21:59,059
- I'm your wife.
- I know.

313
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:01,761
How could you
treat me like this?

314
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:04,131
How can you do this to us?

315
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:05,665
You're right. I am sorry.

316
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:07,401
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

317
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:11,671
Did you end things
with that woman?

318
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:14,274
Yes. It's over
between me and Vivienne.

319
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:16,877
Do you swear it?

320
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:19,645
On Anna's life.

321
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:22,850
Because this is why...

322
00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:26,019
- I brought us here.
- I...

323
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:28,956
I didn't want you
to sneak off to go see her.

324
00:22:29,022 --> 00:22:33,961
I... I wanted you to give us
a chance to rebuild.

325
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,262
I'm gonna get help.

326
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:40,400
I just... oh, my god.

327
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:43,036
It's hard to trust you.

328
00:22:43,636 --> 00:22:47,508
You just keep hurting me...
Over and over.

329
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:49,143
I'm so sorry.

330
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:52,279
I want things to be
like they used to.

331
00:22:52,346 --> 00:22:53,380
Mm-hmm.

332
00:22:54,647 --> 00:22:56,083
We're gonna be okay.

333
00:22:57,384 --> 00:22:58,385
We're gonna be okay.

334
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:23,210
Mom! Dad!

335
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,580
Wow.

336
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:27,948
- Are you okay, hon?
- Yeah.

337
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:29,950
I think it's finally stopping.

338
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:33,420
You know, it happens
when she gets stressed.

339
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:36,722
How do I look?

340
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:40,627
Like a supermodel who
got punched in the nose.

341
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:43,530
At least we have a reason
to stay home tonight.

342
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:47,143
- Yeah, well, that boy didn't give me a number to call and cancel.
- His name is Isaac.

343
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:49,570
- Who cares if we don't call and cancel?
- His name's Isaac.

344
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,638
We can't just stand him...

345
00:23:51,704 --> 00:23:52,744
And his grandfather up,

346
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,246
especially if they're
cooking a meal.

347
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:57,778
- Okay, well...
- Like, what if they mess with the house when we leave?

348
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:00,981
I'll go to the store
in the morning and apologize.

349
00:24:02,783 --> 00:24:04,861
I don't want Isaac to see me
with a bloody nose, mom.

350
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:07,187
- I know, honey.
- What if it happens again?

351
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:11,458
- Okay.
- We can have a nice dinner.

352
00:24:12,725 --> 00:24:14,061
Just the three of us.

353
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:20,867
Oh. One minute!

354
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:40,354
Hi there, Anna's mom and dad.

355
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,789
- What are you doing here?
- I'm real sorry.

356
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,601
I... I know you were supposed
to come to our place,

357
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,193
but the strangest
thing happened.

358
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:48,061
- What's that?
- Our oven died.

359
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:50,831
- Seriously?
- Yeah. So,

360
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:52,332
we did the next best thing.

361
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,599
We just brought the food
over here to cook for you.

362
00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:57,271
It's... it's in the truck
with my grandpappy.

363
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,371
Hmm.

364
00:24:58,472 --> 00:25:02,476
Uh. Veal cutlets,
onions, carrots, grits.

365
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,511
Grandpappy sure can cook.

366
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,913
Uh. We even brought
a bottle of wine.

367
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:10,417
It... it's just how
we do things on the bayou.

368
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,720
- Hmm.
- So, can we come in?

369
00:25:13,987 --> 00:25:15,956
Uh. We'll even do dishes.

370
00:25:17,858 --> 00:25:20,527
Ye... yes,
uh, of course you can.

371
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:23,697
Hey, grandpappy,
they said it's okay to come in!

372
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,402
Great.

373
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:30,536
Come on in.

374
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,426
Thanks for cooking.

375
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:55,028
It's no big deal.

376
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:58,197
My name's John.

377
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:03,670
You know,
about that note you wrote me,

378
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,138
the one on the receipt.

379
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:06,672
I remember.

380
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,209
What did you mean by that?

381
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:13,914
Get me a measuring cup.

382
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:21,154
The little one.

383
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,460
Sometimes...

384
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:31,898
When a man does bad things,
it opens up a door.

385
00:26:32,532 --> 00:26:33,600
I don't understand.

386
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,368
Are you sure?

387
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:41,475
The devil is watching us
all the time.

388
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:44,411
Some of us invite him in.

389
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,312
Some don't.

390
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:49,483
I felt you needed
to hear those words, but...

391
00:26:51,284 --> 00:26:53,387
Didn't want to say 'em
in front of your daughter.

392
00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:57,391
Well, no offense, but I don't
believe in the devil.

393
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:02,896
The devil believes in you.

394
00:27:04,598 --> 00:27:07,033
Thanks. I appreciate that.

395
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:22,048
His name's Toby.

396
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:24,651
We call him tub tub.
He likes you.

397
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:27,287
Cats can sense things
people can't.

398
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,361
Come on, tub tub.
Yeah, there you go.

399
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:39,065
Is that thing on?

400
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
No.

401
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,806
So, you were saying
it's just you

402
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,406
and your grandfather out here?

403
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,676
Yes, ma'am.
My parents died some time ago.

404
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:51,211
He raised me as his own.

405
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:54,147
- How'd your parents die?
- Anna.

406
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:55,682
Don't. It's rude.

407
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,652
It's fine.
I would be curious too.

408
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,554
Uh. They died of bone cancer.

409
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,423
- Both of them?
- Yes, ma'am.

410
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,760
Grandpappy says bone cancer's
the most painful way to die.

411
00:28:07,427 --> 00:28:10,163
But he says
a lot of crazy things.

412
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,565
He's a wild one.

413
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:15,635
What are the schools
like around here?

414
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:18,205
Why? Are you wanting
to move here with Anna?

415
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,738
No.

416
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:22,209
I wouldn't
know much about schools.

417
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:24,779
Grandpappy taught me
everything I know.

418
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:26,781
But I'm gonna run
the store one day.

419
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:28,281
That's so cool.

420
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:29,983
You really think so?

421
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:31,984
Yeah.

422
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:34,488
I... I like your shirt.
It matches your eyes.

423
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:35,989
How old are you, Isaac?

424
00:28:36,523 --> 00:28:39,192
Eighteen. I'm trying
to grow a beard.

425
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,527
Hmm.

426
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:44,164
Who owns this house?
Do you know?

427
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:48,368
I don't know much about 'em.
They're never really here.

428
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:49,735
Really?

429
00:28:51,204 --> 00:28:53,473
But being your closest neighbor,
I'd think you'd know.

430
00:28:54,508 --> 00:28:57,077
Hey, everybody,
dinner is almost ready

431
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:58,678
and it looks delicious.

432
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:08,587
This is great.

433
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,725
You are one hell of a cook.

434
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:16,062
There's nothing
my grandpappy can't do.

435
00:29:17,397 --> 00:29:19,165
I bet your mom's
a hell of a cook too.

436
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,302
Um.

437
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,874
- She's, uh...
- No. That's okay, sweetie.

438
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:30,011
Uh. Cooking isn't my forte.

439
00:29:30,076 --> 00:29:32,479
It's just,
I never got interested in it.

440
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,215
Out here,
cooking isn't an interest.

441
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:37,717
It's a necessity.

442
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,155
We don't have
restaurants for miles.

443
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:44,524
You don't cook, you don't eat.

444
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,361
I know how to cook, Isaac.
It's just, uh,

445
00:29:48,728 --> 00:29:50,163
not a passion of mine.

446
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:52,565
Hmm.

447
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,534
Everyone's got their passion.

448
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,242
Would you mind
if I light some candles?

449
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:04,544
No, uh...

450
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:07,747
That would be nice.

451
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,069
- Isaac.
- Yes, ma'am.

452
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:30,403
How did you know
where the candles are?

453
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:34,140
Lucky guess.

454
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:35,708
I'll be.

455
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,219
I guess cats
aren't the only ones

456
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:38,378
who can sense things.

457
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:52,325
Pretty funny thing to say, huh, grandpappy?

458
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,266
Gosh, you know...

459
00:31:01,936 --> 00:31:04,137
Uh, I don't have any matches.

460
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:06,172
Oh, um...

461
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,174
I'll find some in the kitchen.

462
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:10,610
John, come help me look.

463
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,527
I want these people
out of the house.

464
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:23,356
Look. Listen, they're weird,

465
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,258
but they haven't done
anything wrong exactly.

466
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:27,627
That creepy boy is looking
at Anna in a way I don't like.

467
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:29,572
- Right.
- And how did he know where the candles are?

468
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,197
Okay, listen,
we will finish dinner

469
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,100
and then we will tell them
we're going to bed.

470
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:34,326
Can't we get them out faster?

471
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,841
Hey, you're the one that said
we shouldn't piss them off.

472
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,472
Fine.

473
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:42,709
I... I want them gone
the minute we finish eating.

474
00:31:43,243 --> 00:31:44,879
I don't want Anna
alone with them.

475
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,782
Oh, shit, uh,
we forgot the matches.

476
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:49,882
Here, come on. I'll tell
them we couldn't find 'em.

477
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,320
Mom, dad, Isaac just did
something really cool.

478
00:31:54,855 --> 00:31:57,757
- What, he found matches?
- No, he touched the candles with his finger

479
00:31:57,825 --> 00:32:00,360
and they just lit up.
Can you do that trick again?

480
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,963
Oh, I'll show you
a lot more tricks, Anna.

481
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:09,202
Isaac, um,
John and I were talking

482
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:12,706
and we're grateful for the meal,

483
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:15,241
but we're really tired
after the drive

484
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,445
and we're going to bed early,
right after dinner.

485
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:21,247
And I... I just wanted you
and your grandpa to know.

486
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:24,350
Wow, grandpappy. You hear that?

487
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:26,053
They're inviting us
to stay the night.

488
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,155
- No, I... I... I...
- We're touched, ma'am.

489
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:31,758
No one's ever invited us to stay
in a house like this before.

490
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,832
I... I'm not inviting you
to stay the night. I'm...

491
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:41,701
I'm saying that
you have to leave after dinner,

492
00:32:42,602 --> 00:32:43,703
if not sooner.

493
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,439
But we brought
ice cream for dessert.

494
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:48,708
Well, we'll eat it
when you're gone.

495
00:32:52,113 --> 00:32:53,113
Oh, come on.

496
00:32:53,747 --> 00:32:54,747
What did we do?

497
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,818
I know there's enough room
in this house for all of us.

498
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:00,121
Six bedrooms,
if I'm not mistaken.

499
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,388
That's not counting
the game room

500
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:04,290
or the bonus room...

501
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:07,761
Or even that locked room
you can't get into.

502
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:10,296
How do you know
about the locked room?

503
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,099
How do you think?

504
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:13,901
You've been
in this house before.

505
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:16,503
Oh, girl, you got a gusher.

506
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:20,540
Mom, I don't feel good.

507
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,044
- Oh!
- Oh, my god.

508
00:33:24,344 --> 00:33:27,514
- Whoa. Come on. Anna, Anna.
- Oh. Get her.

509
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:29,850
Oh, for Christ sakes.

510
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:31,618
I gotta use your pisser.

511
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:35,022
- Anna.
- Hey, baby?

512
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,992
- Let's get her in the living room, okay?
- Okay.

513
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:42,797
Anna.

514
00:33:43,363 --> 00:33:46,699
- Wake up. Wake up.
- Wake up. Wake up. Hey.

515
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:48,168
Hey.

516
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:51,771
Hey, are you okay? Are you okay?

517
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,741
Hey, sweetie.

518
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,012
- Can you hear my voice?
- Can you hear me?

519
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,747
- Your mom's here. I'm here.
- You're okay.

520
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:02,882
Mom.

521
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:06,386
What happ... what happened?

522
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,389
You fainted.
You had another nosebleed.

523
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:15,528
I have to wash my face.

524
00:34:15,796 --> 00:34:17,932
Oh, it's fine.
I've seen blood before.

525
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:20,234
- Much more than that.
- You need to leave.

526
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,920
I'm not sure
you want that, ma'am.

527
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:25,005
She's very sure.
Our daughter isn't feeling well.

528
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:26,140
Dad, I'm fine.

529
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,550
- No, hey. Isaac...
- No, you're not.

530
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:29,442
Enough is enough. Come on.

531
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:33,280
It can take
grandpappy a little bit.

532
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:34,949
Sometimes he gets the squirts.

533
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:37,151
- Then go wait in the truck.
- Mom.

534
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,651
- It's okay.
- Wow.

535
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:42,455
I feel like your cat's
the only one that likes me here.

536
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,558
You cook veal cutlets
for strangers

537
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,061
and this is the thanks you get?

538
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,497
You like me though,
don't you, Anna?

539
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:53,466
I can tell.

540
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:57,137
- The way a woman likes a man.
- Stop it!

541
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,173
You're done here,
Isaac. Get out.

542
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,876
I knew you'd have problems
getting into that locked room.

543
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,911
It's the only key.

544
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,953
I think my grandpappy's
tangling with your cat.

545
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,420
Toby?

546
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:17,224
Wait. Wait.

547
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,792
Toby.

548
00:35:21,461 --> 00:35:23,421
- Toby! Toby!
- What the hell is going on in here?

549
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:24,649
- Did you hurt our cat?
- No!

550
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:26,231
- Open the door.
- I was just looking for the bathroom.

551
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,353
- That door was open.
- Toby!

552
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,370
- The cat ran inside.
- Toby.

553
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:32,940
Now, I may have
closed it by accident.

554
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:35,408
You're lying. This door
has been locked the entire time.

555
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:37,644
Grandpappy never lies.

556
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:41,148
- Toby. Toby.
- Wait, you have a key to the room too?

557
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:44,351
Toby, Toby, Toby!

558
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:45,752
Give me the key.

559
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,020
Give it to me.

560
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,980
- Toby! Toby!
- Give me the fucking key!

561
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:50,157
- This key?
- Yeah!

562
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:51,551
- Just give it to me.
- Jesus.

563
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,929
Grandpappy, he's hurting me.

564
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,500
See, John?

565
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:02,502
- Told you I'd show you some tricks.
- Huh?

566
00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:05,005
What's going on?

567
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:09,843
Good thing we have candles.

568
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,216
Anna, honey, are you okay?

569
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,451
Take your grandson
and get out of here.

570
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,354
- He's not my grandson.
- What?

571
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:22,423
What do you mean, he's not your grandson?

572
00:36:22,488 --> 00:36:24,590
I mean, he's not my grandson.

573
00:36:24,657 --> 00:36:25,893
All right.

574
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,636
All right, you know what?
Just give me the key.

575
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,820
We're gonna take our cat
and I'm gonna call the police.

576
00:36:31,198 --> 00:36:32,574
- Something's hurting Toby, dad!
- Okay, calm down.

577
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:33,709
- Something's hurting him!
- Calm down.

578
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,935
Do something, dad.

579
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:37,304
Can't just open it up.

580
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:39,273
Toby.

581
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:41,275
Oh, my god.

582
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:51,986
Is Toby dead?

583
00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:54,754
Listen, give me the key!

584
00:36:55,655 --> 00:36:56,957
Check your back pocket.

585
00:36:58,993 --> 00:37:00,194
Jesus Christ.

586
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,098
I'll be.

587
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,278
- I'm opening it.
- No, no, no. Stop, stop!

588
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:08,900
- John, John, John, please. You have to stop.
- I'm opening the door.

589
00:37:08,902 --> 00:37:10,046
- Please stop. We heard...
- I'm opening the door.

590
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,671
- There's something in there.
- Mom,

591
00:37:11,738 --> 00:37:13,515
- Toby's in there!
- There is something... I know,

592
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:14,979
but there
is something else in there.

593
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:16,719
- We all heard it. Please don't...
- Could be a coyote went in there,

594
00:37:16,743 --> 00:37:18,278
you know, when the door opened.

595
00:37:18,578 --> 00:37:19,813
Oh, coyote.

596
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:21,782
Now, that is bad news
for tub tub.

597
00:37:21,882 --> 00:37:23,450
No, no. Enough's enough!

598
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:25,585
- I'm opening the damn door!
- No, please don't!

599
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:26,930
- Don't open the door.
- Back off!

600
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:28,798
Are you out of your mind?
Please, John, let's...

601
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:30,057
- Come on!
- Let us go.

602
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,002
- Let's go.
- Open the door. Dad, open the door.

603
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:33,994
Damn, I must have brought
the wrong key.

604
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:37,798
Can we go, please?

605
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,802
- Can we go? Oh, my god.
- Mom, we can't go! We can't just leave Toby, mom!

606
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:43,569
Listen to me. It's a cat.

607
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,938
We will buy another cat.

608
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:46,306
We will.

609
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,142
Grandpappy,
did you find that bathroom?

610
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:50,453
- We have to get out of here.
- Yeah. Through there.

611
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,112
Of course. I remember now.

612
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,948
Uh. Sorry about your cat.

613
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:56,884
Fuck you.

614
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:02,189
Listen,
you need to come with me.

615
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:04,657
We need to talk
before Isaac gets back.

616
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:06,827
Follow me.

617
00:38:06,894 --> 00:38:07,961
Come here. Come here.

618
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:09,629
We have to go. We have to go.

619
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:14,201
<i>So, are you robbing us?
Is that what's going on?</i>

620
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,670
You ain't got nothing
we need or want.

621
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:19,206
Then why are you here?

622
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:21,607
Like I told him...

623
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:26,712
When a man does bad things,
it opens up a door.

624
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:29,083
You are nuts and so is that kid.

625
00:38:29,783 --> 00:38:31,151
Bad things?

626
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:32,352
Bad things like what?

627
00:38:33,454 --> 00:38:34,587
Like lying.

628
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:36,355
Cheating.

629
00:38:37,491 --> 00:38:38,491
Murder.

630
00:38:38,826 --> 00:38:40,994
- Ain't you read your <i>Bible?</i>
- Oh, god.

631
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:44,398
In the store,
Isaac was so nice to me.

632
00:38:45,432 --> 00:38:47,868
He said I looked like his ex-girlfriend.

633
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:50,337
Now, he's being so mean.

634
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,940
Yeah, well...

635
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:55,042
That's Isaac in a nutshell.

636
00:38:55,976 --> 00:38:58,178
If Isaac isn't your grandson,

637
00:38:58,345 --> 00:38:59,379
then who is he?

638
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:04,785
He just
sort of appeared one summer.

639
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:07,154
Walked right out of the bayou.

640
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:12,625
Said his parents had died,
left him a bunch of money.

641
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:18,631
Never even told me
his last name.

642
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:23,203
But he didn't have
no place to live.

643
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:26,240
Didn't have no possessions.

644
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:30,811
So I kinda, sorta, took him in.

645
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:33,113
- You took him in?
- Stop!

646
00:39:34,848 --> 00:39:36,416
I'm not done talking.

647
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,358
He ain't got no education...

648
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:47,961
But he's got
a good Christian spirit.

649
00:39:51,198 --> 00:39:55,435
I... I guess
I'm his helpmate, so to speak.

650
00:39:55,536 --> 00:39:56,837
Oh, god.

651
00:39:57,571 --> 00:39:58,906
How long has he lived with you?

652
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:01,875
It's hard telling.
You lose track of time

653
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:03,443
out on the bayou.

654
00:40:04,244 --> 00:40:07,347
Few years, maybe.

655
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:09,650
Maybe decades.

656
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:11,218
There's no way.

657
00:40:13,686 --> 00:40:14,788
Thing is...

658
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:18,258
He don't never seem
to get any older.

659
00:40:19,893 --> 00:40:22,262
He's good with those damn
magic tricks, though, isn't he?

660
00:40:23,597 --> 00:40:25,399
But he always looks
the same to me.

661
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:26,867
Maybe 18 or so.

662
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,701
- This is bullshit.
- Just let him talk.

663
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:30,404
- No, it's bullshit!
- Let him talk!

664
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:35,042
I'd like to put some music on.

665
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:37,878
Make sure Isaac can't hear.

666
00:40:39,513 --> 00:40:41,014
I got something else
to tell you.

667
00:41:05,872 --> 00:41:06,992
<i>So, what are you telling me?</i>

668
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,284
<i>You telling me that
she found out about us?</i>

669
00:41:08,308 --> 00:41:09,308
<i>I wasn't careful enough.</i>

670
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:12,512
<i>I was so stupid about it.
Yes, she followed me, okay?</i>

671
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:13,647
<i>I just found out about it.</i>

672
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:16,326
- <i>She could be watching us right now.</i>
- Well, that ain't the song

673
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,094
- I was looking for.
- <i>I can't believe she knows.</i>

674
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:20,187
<i>She's dragging me
on a trip with Anna. I...</i>

675
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:23,223
- What is this? Wh... what is this?
- <i>God, I fucked this up.</i>

676
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,926
<i>- It's gonna be okay.
- I'm telling you,</i>

677
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,427
she is vicious.

678
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,498
You have no idea.

679
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:33,267
I have to be
more careful from now on.

680
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,870
Everything will be different
when I get back, Vivienne.

681
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,972
I will file the divorce papers,

682
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,874
and we can start
our new life together.

683
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:44,144
- No, no, no, no!
- Yes, yes.

684
00:41:44,411 --> 00:41:45,412
- No.
- Yes.

685
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:47,047
- Come on.
- It's okay.

686
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:50,817
Jessica, please.

687
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,954
- I don't know what's going on right now.
- <i>I love you so much.</i>

688
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,123
<i>I love you more.</i>

689
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:10,237
How did you get that?

690
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,739
- I think it's one of Isaac's magic tricks.
- Listen.

691
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:14,241
Fuck your magic.

692
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,043
Was that real?

693
00:42:16,143 --> 00:42:17,878
That was real. That was real.

694
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:20,147
So, you've been seeing Vivienne.

695
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:23,183
Yeah? Yeah?

696
00:42:23,884 --> 00:42:26,420
And you... you...
You're going to... to...

697
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:29,022
You're going to divorce me?

698
00:42:30,557 --> 00:42:31,591
I... no.

699
00:42:31,992 --> 00:42:34,127
I said that to her,
but I didn't mean it.

700
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:36,897
My god.

701
00:42:36,963 --> 00:42:39,132
You've been playing
both of us this entire time

702
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,634
and you've been lying to me.

703
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:42,402
I can't believe this.

704
00:42:42,636 --> 00:42:44,671
No, hey, listen,
don't get emotional.

705
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:46,373
I can get however I want.

706
00:42:46,506 --> 00:42:50,277
- Not in front of Anna.
- Not in front of Anna? You're a piece of shit.

707
00:42:51,912 --> 00:42:53,547
Dad, are you leaving me and mom?

708
00:43:01,888 --> 00:43:03,924
I'm gonna kill you.

709
00:43:05,058 --> 00:43:06,058
Look.

710
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:09,162
<i>Greatest hits</i>
<i>of gene Allison.</i> See?

711
00:43:10,197 --> 00:43:13,900
No. You're a liar
and so is that boy.

712
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:16,670
You're doing this
to mess with me.

713
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,510
Anna and I are gonna
leave right now.

714
00:43:18,572 --> 00:43:19,949
- Please don't.
- You... you're disgusting.

715
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,541
- Please don't.
- You see this?

716
00:43:22,442 --> 00:43:23,442
Go to hell.

717
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:25,479
Yeah, I'm divorcing you now.

718
00:43:25,545 --> 00:43:26,313
We're done.

719
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,514
- Listen to me...
- I'm out.

720
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:28,581
Jessica!

721
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,027
- Come on. I want you to get up. Get up.
- No, you can't leave dad.

722
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:33,120
- Jessica!
- I'm out.

723
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:37,324
Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

724
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:39,259
Toby?

725
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,633
Oh, my god.

726
00:43:47,802 --> 00:43:50,404
Wait. I figured it out.

727
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:01,014
Other than Anna...

728
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:04,317
You're all in on this,
aren't you?

729
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:09,723
- In on what?
- In on this.

730
00:44:10,557 --> 00:44:12,692
You're all working together,
aren't you?

731
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:15,761
You and the old man,

732
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:18,365
both have keys
to the locked room.

733
00:44:18,932 --> 00:44:19,932
And you,

734
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:23,103
you already know these people
and you paid them.

735
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,139
You set me up
and taped me somehow

736
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,175
and now, you're getting
your sick revenge.

737
00:44:28,241 --> 00:44:30,343
You don't want
to rebuild our marriage.

738
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,478
You want revenge.

739
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:34,247
- You're crazy.
- You know, I knew you were vicious

740
00:44:34,314 --> 00:44:35,348
I knew it,

741
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:37,684
but I didn't know
you were a psychopath.

742
00:44:38,585 --> 00:44:40,320
How could you do this to Anna?

743
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,589
I've never met
these people before in my life.

744
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,490
I'm calling the police on you.

745
00:44:44,591 --> 00:44:45,968
- Call them. Call them right now.
- Wait, wait.

746
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:47,093
Who took my phone?

747
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,096
- Where is my phone?
- Stop, dad! Stop!

748
00:44:50,163 --> 00:44:51,163
Maybe it was Vivienne.

749
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:52,375
Maybe... maybe she's the one
that set you up.

750
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:53,700
Did you ever think about that?

751
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:57,771
And you're a lying,
cheating asshole

752
00:44:57,905 --> 00:45:00,574
and she's probably
exactly like you.

753
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:04,644
You're the one who followed me,
who stalked me.

754
00:45:04,946 --> 00:45:06,881
Exactly. What if she's doing
the same thing?

755
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,416
Please stop!

756
00:45:12,787 --> 00:45:14,254
Before you played that...

757
00:45:15,455 --> 00:45:16,455
Record...

758
00:45:18,325 --> 00:45:19,626
What were you going to say?

759
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:22,295
I was gonna tell you
that there's something

760
00:45:22,362 --> 00:45:24,531
you need to see
in that locked room.

761
00:45:33,073 --> 00:45:35,542
- Holy shit!
- What?

762
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,010
Someone's out there.

763
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:39,144
Where?

764
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:41,448
I saw something by the water.

765
00:45:41,816 --> 00:45:43,016
Could be a coyote.

766
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,553
Yeah, could be. Or maybe a wolf.

767
00:45:47,187 --> 00:45:48,455
Even a wild dog.

768
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,795
There!

769
00:45:54,862 --> 00:45:56,773
- I don't see it. Where are you looking?
- No, I saw it.

770
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:58,365
I saw it too.

771
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:03,336
Probably just a coyote.
Or a wolf.

772
00:46:04,237 --> 00:46:05,672
Better to be safe though.

773
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:15,248
Good thing
this gun's still here.

774
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:17,349
Whoa.

775
00:46:19,085 --> 00:46:20,220
Don't worry.

776
00:46:21,254 --> 00:46:23,123
If you're righteous,
you'll survive.

777
00:46:24,257 --> 00:46:27,360
- Just be careful, please.
- Wait.

778
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:28,829
How's this camera work?

779
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:35,068
<i>Look, grandpappy.</i>

780
00:46:36,136 --> 00:46:37,337
<i>I'm a movie star.</i>

781
00:46:39,272 --> 00:46:41,141
Don't put me on that.

782
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,810
Isaac.

783
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,746
Isaac, what is it that you want?

784
00:46:49,149 --> 00:46:51,351
I want you to take
real good care of this camera.

785
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,855
<i>I'm gonna be famous one day.</i>

786
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:57,357
<i>Just like Charles manson.</i>

787
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:10,136
You know,
you hear about god's son.

788
00:47:11,738 --> 00:47:13,206
Does Satan have a son?

789
00:47:13,941 --> 00:47:16,409
Food for thought.

790
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:22,783
Please put that gun down.

791
00:47:24,018 --> 00:47:25,886
- Let's go outside, John.
- No.

792
00:47:28,421 --> 00:47:31,157
- Why not?
- Because you're gonna shoot me.

793
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:32,625
Shoot you?

794
00:47:33,193 --> 00:47:36,897

- I thought we were gonna go hunt coyotes.

795
00:47:37,764 --> 00:47:40,600
We can talk about this.
Can we talk about this, please?

796
00:47:41,102 --> 00:47:42,837
Will you please
put that gun down?

797
00:47:43,203 --> 00:47:45,305
- Please?
- Jessica.

798
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:47,773
Fine.

799
00:47:48,475 --> 00:47:50,377
I'll leave the gun
with grandpappy.

800
00:47:51,277 --> 00:47:52,579
You can stay here with your wife

801

This wasn't the deal we made.

819
00:49:22,602 --> 00:49:25,139
No, listen,
all you have to do is Rob us

820
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:27,007
and shoot Jessica.

821
00:49:27,108 --> 00:49:28,742
What the fuck
are you doing in there?

822
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:30,577
What the fuck are you
pushing me for?

823
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:34,915
How did you get that recording
of me and Vivienne?

824
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:36,683
- Oh, magic.
- Yeah?

825
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,485
- Yeah.
- I have to look squeaky-clean

826
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:41,155
and you have to be believable
for Anna's sake.

827
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:42,355
Oh, I'm not believable?

828
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:46,026
They don't know I'm 21,
that... that I was in the army.

829
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,561
But you keep fucking up my plan.

830
00:49:48,929 --> 00:49:50,064
I'm fucking up?

831
00:49:50,597 --> 00:49:52,732
I'm not the one
trying to murder my wife.

832
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:53,834
Don't say that.

833
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,803
- Murder? Murder.
- Don't say that.

834
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,379
- Don't say that.
- You don't like that word.

835
00:49:57,403 --> 00:49:59,739
- Murder. Murder.
- Don't say that. Don't say that.

836
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,810
Don't say that.
Don't say that, Isaac.

837
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:05,311
Get off of me.

838
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:10,283
This was the perfect plan.

839
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:11,843
I knew that
she would drag me here.

840
00:50:11,886 --> 00:50:14,487
She babbled
about this stupid house nonstop.

841
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:17,757
I spent so long strategizing
and finding you.

842
00:50:17,825 --> 00:50:18,825
Yeah.

843
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:21,996
It's not easy finding a killer for hire.

844
00:50:22,295 --> 00:50:24,131
You gotta visit
some pretty dark places.

845
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:27,567
I'm not gonna pay you
if this thing goes sideways.

846
00:50:27,802 --> 00:50:28,803
Oh.

847
00:50:29,203 --> 00:50:31,337
Yeah, 'cause you'll be in jail.

848
00:50:31,872 --> 00:50:32,705
Well, so will you.

849
00:50:32,873 --> 00:50:34,517
Along with that crazy, old man
you work with.

850
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:36,177
He's never
gonna see daylight again.

851
00:50:36,543 --> 00:50:38,678
You're gonna see
the electric chair, bub.

852
00:50:40,114 --> 00:50:41,748
You're the mastermind here.

853
00:50:42,817 --> 00:50:43,951
We're just country folk.

854
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:47,453
What happened to our cat
in that locked room?

855
00:50:48,655 --> 00:50:51,324
Maybe a coyote killed him
and I brought him back to life.

856
00:50:51,391 --> 00:50:52,568
This is what I'm talking about.

857
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:54,694
You quit scaring people
with this voodoo shit

858
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:55,996
and do your job.

859
00:50:57,198 --> 00:50:58,765
This is my job.

860
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,099
Okay.

861
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,536
Keep the train on the tracks
and you'll get your 100 grand.

862
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:06,273
Then you can take the car
to Mexico, like we planned.

863
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,608
I feel like
you're trying to control me.

864
00:51:10,845 --> 00:51:12,146
You want your wife gone,

865
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,514
you want a good story
for your kid,

866
00:51:15,015 --> 00:51:18,018
for the cops
and your shiny, new girlfriend.

867
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,520
That takes work.

868
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:23,023
That takes trust.

869
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:28,661
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

870
00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:31,966
We can call
this whole thing off right now.

871
00:51:32,365 --> 00:51:33,466
No, we are doing it,

872
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:35,702
but from now on,
play by the rules.

873
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:37,637
- Okay.
- Okay.

874
00:51:38,404 --> 00:51:39,907
So go in there,

875
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:41,909
Rob us,
and when we're walking back

876
00:51:41,976 --> 00:51:45,378
to the locked room,
you shoot Jessica in the head

877
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,114
and then you get the fuck out.

878
00:51:49,582 --> 00:51:50,582
Okay.

879
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:09,003
They've been gone so long now.

880
00:52:11,272 --> 00:52:14,641
I could put some music on again.

881
00:52:14,774 --> 00:52:15,774
No.

882
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:17,710
No, it's okay.

883
00:52:18,045 --> 00:52:19,179
What...

884
00:52:21,348 --> 00:52:22,783
What's... what's your real name?

885
00:52:25,451 --> 00:52:26,921
Grandpappy's fine.

886
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:30,090
Grandpappy. Grandpappy.

887
00:52:35,461 --> 00:52:36,964
I wanna ask you something.

888
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:38,798
Yeah?

889
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:44,771
I think there's something
wrong with Isaac.

890
00:52:45,672 --> 00:52:48,242
I think that he is... evil,

891
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:50,443
and he wants to hurt people.

892
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:54,114
Yeah, some days,
I think that too.

893
00:52:58,018 --> 00:52:59,954
- But you're not like him.
- Hmm.

894
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:01,789
Not from what I can tell.

895
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:06,225
So...

896
00:53:09,662 --> 00:53:11,131
I'd like to make a proposition.

897
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:13,934
- A proposition?
- Yes.

898
00:53:17,204 --> 00:53:18,671
Let me and my daughter go.

899
00:53:19,306 --> 00:53:20,941
We'll sneak out.
Isaac won't see us.

900
00:53:21,008 --> 00:53:23,777
We'll get in our car
and drive away.

901
00:53:24,345 --> 00:53:25,578
What about dad?

902
00:53:25,813 --> 00:53:26,813
Quiet.

903
00:53:31,484 --> 00:53:32,853
You'll go to the police.

904
00:53:32,953 --> 00:53:34,989
I'll tell them
that you're innocent.

905
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:37,925
I'll say that you're a hostage
just like us.

906
00:53:39,659 --> 00:53:43,163
But I have a gun.

907
00:53:45,565 --> 00:53:47,767
Well, I think Isaac
is making you do this.

908
00:53:48,501 --> 00:53:49,736
I know he is.

909
00:53:51,071 --> 00:53:54,875
I can't turn my back on him.

910
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,811
If you let us go, I will...

911
00:53:57,978 --> 00:54:00,114
I will give you
everything I have.

912
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:03,183
Mom, what about dad?

913
00:54:04,251 --> 00:54:05,919
We can't just
leave him here to die.

914
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,520
Hush.

915
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:09,756
They're almost back.

916
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:12,592
Oh, shit.

917
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:16,696
I can't believe
you wanted to leave dad.

918
00:54:18,698 --> 00:54:20,067
Don't tell him I said that.

919
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:32,712
We didn't see any coyotes.

920
00:54:33,113 --> 00:54:34,214
But we did some talking.

921
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:38,018
Ma'am, your husband's right.

922
00:54:38,452 --> 00:54:39,452
We're robbing you.

923
00:54:40,087 --> 00:54:42,256
Me and grandpappy
are gonna lock you in that room.

924
00:54:42,823 --> 00:54:44,234
See, we've been sneaking
in this house

925
00:54:44,258 --> 00:54:45,392
for a few weeks now.

926
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:47,127
Thought you were the new owners.

927
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,996
Just bad luck, really.

928
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:50,596
Like bone cancer.

929
00:54:51,764 --> 00:54:53,200
You're gonna lock us
in the room?

930
00:54:53,534 --> 00:54:54,534
Yes, ma'am.

931
00:54:54,968 --> 00:54:56,769
After we take
your money and your SUV.

932
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:01,741
- That was their plan all along.
- But we'll die if you lock us up. How... how will we get out?

933
00:55:02,176 --> 00:55:05,245
We'll call the police,
leave an anonymous tip.

934
00:55:05,979 --> 00:55:08,115
I'll leave some food and
water in there for you.

935
00:55:08,182 --> 00:55:10,317
Thank you. I trust them.

936
00:55:10,384 --> 00:55:12,019
You're a fucking idiot.

937
00:55:12,086 --> 00:55:14,154
They are not
gonna call the police.

938
00:55:16,423 --> 00:55:19,759
My daughter is 14 years old.

939
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:24,098
Please, I'm... I'm asking you,
please don't do this.

940
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:27,434
- Ma'am, you have my word.
- Your word?

941
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:30,037
- Your word doesn't mean anything.
- Calm down, okay?

942
00:55:30,104 --> 00:55:33,207
Your word means even less.
Why the fuck would I calm down?

943
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,708
Jess.

944
00:55:36,276 --> 00:55:37,511
It's the room or a bullet.

945
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:46,887
It's okay.

946
00:56:02,503 --> 00:56:03,636
Time's wasting.

947
00:56:04,637 --> 00:56:06,140
What is this place?

948
00:56:06,607 --> 00:56:07,773
Why are you doing this?

949
00:56:08,342 --> 00:56:11,512
- Why are you doing this?
- I think we just have to put our differences aside...

950
00:56:11,578 --> 00:56:12,813
And do what they...

951
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,148
Don't talk to me!

952
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:21,155
You first, John.

953
00:56:22,655 --> 00:56:24,391
Me?

954
00:56:25,926 --> 00:56:27,794
- It's okay.
- Dad.

955
00:56:28,595 --> 00:56:29,796
- Go on.
- No.

956
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:35,903
- No. No.
- All right.

957
00:56:44,211 --> 00:56:45,211
Dad.

958
00:56:47,614 --> 00:56:49,216
Come on.

959
00:57:00,961 --> 00:57:02,095
Isaac?

960
00:57:03,664 --> 00:57:05,299
Isaac, what are you doing?

961
00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:07,634
I'm putting you
where you belong, John.

962
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:12,139
Isaac, let me out.

963
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:13,739
John...

964
00:57:15,075 --> 00:57:16,075
Isaac.

965
00:57:16,944 --> 00:57:19,079
- Let me out.
- Hey, John?

966
00:57:20,247 --> 00:57:21,315
Murder.

967
00:57:24,717 --> 00:57:26,887
Let me out, Isaac.

968
00:57:29,156 --> 00:57:30,324
Isaac...

969
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:32,159
Isaac...

970
00:57:33,026 --> 00:57:34,061
Isaac...

971
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:36,597
I'm gonna kill you!

972
00:57:37,064 --> 00:57:39,700
Isaac, open the door!

973
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:40,901
Open the door!

974
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:43,303
I'm gonna fucking
tear you apart.

975
00:57:47,174 --> 00:57:48,174
See, ma'am,

976
00:57:48,308 --> 00:57:50,711
I'm guessing he's cheated on you
many a times before

977
00:57:50,811 --> 00:57:52,079
with many different women.

978
00:57:52,145 --> 00:57:53,981
But you always take
him back, don't you?

979
00:57:54,047 --> 00:57:56,025
- What is he talking about?
- I... I... I don't... I don't know.

980
00:57:56,049 --> 00:57:57,084
Anna...

981
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,053
Hey, baby.
Don't listen to Isaac.

982
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,754
Don't listen to him.

983
00:58:02,089 --> 00:58:05,559
Isaac! What do you
think you're doing?

984
00:58:05,726 --> 00:58:07,361
You've been in denial
about your husband

985
00:58:07,427 --> 00:58:08,595
for a long time now.

986
00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:11,229
- Anna! Let me out!
- It's time you face the truth.

987
00:58:13,934 --> 00:58:15,068
Better go get that.

988
00:58:15,768 --> 00:58:17,137
- Don't worry.
- Isaac...

989
00:58:17,204 --> 00:58:19,339
Me and grandpappy will stay
right here with Anna.

990
00:58:19,473 --> 00:58:20,941
No. No.

991
00:58:21,174 --> 00:58:24,645
No, mom, you can't leave me.
No, you can't leave, mom.

992
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:27,281
- Mom.
- You dirty motherfucker!

993
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:29,315
Isaac!

994
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:32,653
Open the door.

995
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:34,321
Open the door!

996
00:58:34,655 --> 00:58:38,458
Open this fucking door!

997
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:40,427
Anna? Anna.

998
00:58:40,661 --> 00:58:44,431
Baby, don't listen to what he says, baby.

999
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:46,233
Listen, he's a liar.

1000
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:51,238
If he says anything about me,
you know he's lying, okay?

1001
00:58:51,638 --> 00:58:54,741
Okay? Same with your mother!

1002
00:58:55,008 --> 00:58:57,811
Same with your fucking mother!

1003
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,918
You.

1004
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:06,319
Oh, my god.

1005
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:08,088
You're his wife.

1006
00:59:08,288 --> 00:59:10,724
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry. I... I got a text.

1007
00:59:10,891 --> 00:59:12,826
From my husband?

1008
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,260
Yes.

1009
00:59:14,895 --> 00:59:16,463
You knew he was married?

1010
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,598
You're as bad as he is.

1011
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,367
I'm really, really sorry.

1012
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:23,303
I am. He... he told me that
he was here all alone here,

1013
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:25,072
that he needed me
to come right away.

1014
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:27,941
See? I drove as fast as I could.

1015
00:59:28,975 --> 00:59:31,478
- My husband didn't text you that.
- What?

1016
00:59:31,712 --> 00:59:32,792
This house is being robbed.

1017
00:59:33,046 --> 00:59:35,046
The men are still inside.
They have John locked up.

1018
00:59:35,817 --> 00:59:37,951
- Are you serious?
- Yes. My daughter's inside too.

1019
00:59:38,218 --> 00:59:40,687
They took John's phone
and texted you to lure you here.

1020
00:59:40,754 --> 00:59:42,289
- Why?
- To hurt you. They're crazy.

1021
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:45,034
- They have a gun.
- Okay, well... well, I'll help however you need, okay?

1022
00:59:45,058 --> 00:59:47,904
- I'll... I'll call the police.
- No, phones don't work. Do you have anything

1023
00:59:47,928 --> 00:59:49,831
I can use as a weapon?
I don't know, a knife?

1024
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:51,474
- Mace. Mace.
- Give it to me. Give it to me.

1025
00:59:51,498 --> 00:59:53,018
- Okay.
- You need to go to the police.

1026
00:59:53,066 --> 00:59:54,826
Tell them that we are
being held at gunpoint.

1027
00:59:54,868 --> 00:59:56,570
There's an old man
and a teenage boy.

1028
00:59:56,636 --> 00:59:58,638
Is John okay? Anna?

1029
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:01,575
Do not use my daughter's name.

1030
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,111
You disgust me.

1031
01:00:04,745 --> 01:00:07,425
- I actually came here to break up with John.
- I don't give a shit.

1032
01:00:07,514 --> 01:00:09,325
- You can have him.
- He told me all of this...

1033
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:10,349
Shut up.

1034
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:14,454
From now on,
my family is me and my daughter.

1035
01:00:15,689 --> 01:00:19,259
If you don't come back here
with the police and I survive...

1036
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:23,497
I swear, I will find you
and I will kill you.

1037
01:00:24,731 --> 01:00:26,032
I'll get help. I swear.

1038
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:28,268
- Go.
- Okay.

1039
01:00:55,662 --> 01:00:57,297
No, don't do this.

1040
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:01,334
They're taking too long.

1041
01:01:01,968 --> 01:01:03,603
Take Anna out
and get the gasoline.

1042
01:01:04,237 --> 01:01:05,238
Anna!

1043
01:01:05,338 --> 01:01:06,506
Dad! Dad!

1044
01:01:06,606 --> 01:01:07,374
Anna!

1045
01:01:07,574 --> 01:01:09,743
Isaac, you betrayed me.

1046
01:01:10,177 --> 01:01:12,780
- You betrayed me!
- You betrayed your own family.

1047
01:01:12,847 --> 01:01:14,448
I'm gonna Bury
every cent of that money.

1048
01:01:14,514 --> 01:01:18,652
You're not gonna see anything.
You're not gonna see anything!

1049
01:01:18,952 --> 01:01:20,922
You really think
I was in this for the money?

1050
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:27,594
Put the key in, Isaac.
Put the key in!

1051
01:01:27,929 --> 01:01:30,430
Put the key in, Isaac!

1052
01:01:30,564 --> 01:01:32,098
Let me out!

1053
01:01:32,165 --> 01:01:34,067
Open the fucking door!

1054
01:01:34,134 --> 01:01:36,269
Isaac. Isaac!

1055
01:01:36,436 --> 01:01:39,005
- Open the door!
- Check the closet, John.

1056
01:01:39,773 --> 01:01:41,174
It's your only way out.

1057
01:02:17,143 --> 01:02:19,145
Open that closet fast, John.

1058
01:02:27,822 --> 01:02:28,822
Come on.

1059
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:34,728
Shit.

1060
01:02:36,496 --> 01:02:37,697
- Oh, my god.
- Try it again.

1061
01:02:37,764 --> 01:02:39,284
- I'm trying.
- Try it again, Vivienne.

1062
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,802
Okay.

1063
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:43,103
- Oh, my god.
- Vivienne.

1064
01:02:43,303 --> 01:02:45,038
The doors won't open.

1065
01:02:45,238 --> 01:02:47,207
- What is happening?
- I'm trapped!

1066
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:49,010
Jessica.

1067
01:02:49,075 --> 01:02:50,644
- Look out.
- Mom.

1068
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:53,580
Grandpappy's making me do this.

1069
01:03:00,021 --> 01:03:02,389
Stop.

1070
01:03:02,455 --> 01:03:04,724
Right there.

1071
01:03:09,696 --> 01:03:12,599
It's a fine night for a bonfire,
don't you think?

1072
01:03:14,035 --> 01:03:15,201
That's what Isaac says.

1073
01:03:15,335 --> 01:03:16,938
We called the police on you.

1074
01:03:17,571 --> 01:03:20,407
- They're on their way.
- Now, you know that's not true.

1075
01:03:21,909 --> 01:03:23,476
Isaac's controlling this,
isn't he?

1076
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:24,911
But why?

1077
01:03:25,078 --> 01:03:27,380
Maybe he didn't have
nothing better to do.

1078
01:03:28,548 --> 01:03:31,251
It's so heavy, mom.
I can't hold it anymore.

1079
01:03:32,085 --> 01:03:34,487
You start pouring
that gasoline on the car.

1080
01:03:36,623 --> 01:03:39,326
- There's a woman inside.
- That woman is no good.

1081
01:03:40,093 --> 01:03:42,162
- You know what? Her and your dad...
- Hey.

1082
01:03:42,495 --> 01:03:43,495
Don't say it.

1083
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:44,730
Why?

1084
01:03:44,999 --> 01:03:46,766
You trying to protect
his good name?

1085
01:03:46,834 --> 01:03:48,301
I'm protecting my daughter.

1086
01:03:49,669 --> 01:03:50,669
Anna...

1087
01:03:52,873 --> 01:03:55,675
Start pouring that gas
or I'm gonna shoot your mama.

1088
01:03:57,344 --> 01:04:00,380
You do it yourself.
You don't make my child do it.

1089
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,083
That's not how this works.

1090
01:04:02,315 --> 01:04:03,450
Don't.

1091
01:04:03,918 --> 01:04:04,919
Don't! Don't!

1092
01:04:05,285 --> 01:04:07,153
- Don't. Stop it, please!
- No. Hey.

1093
01:04:07,855 --> 01:04:08,855
Go back.

1094
01:04:09,656 --> 01:04:10,656
I'll do it.

1095
01:04:10,757 --> 01:04:11,757
- No!
- Good.

1096
01:04:12,927 --> 01:04:13,927
No.

1097
01:04:14,929 --> 01:04:16,496
- Don't!
- Anna, shut your eyes.

1098
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:17,330
Mom.

1099
01:04:17,631 --> 01:04:19,766
No, Jessica!

1100
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:22,069
No!

1101
01:04:22,469 --> 01:04:25,538
- Make sure you get some under the hood.
- I'm sorry!

1102
01:04:25,739 --> 01:04:28,976
No, Jessica! Oh, my god!

1103
01:04:29,376 --> 01:04:31,112
No, Jessica, please!

1104
01:04:31,444 --> 01:04:33,713
- Jessica, no!
- I'm so fucking sorry.

1105
01:04:33,781 --> 01:04:36,182
No!

1106
01:04:37,484 --> 01:04:39,285
No!

1107
01:04:44,591 --> 01:04:48,495
Jessica! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Jessica!

1108
01:04:48,728 --> 01:04:51,164
Please! Stop!

1109
01:04:52,033 --> 01:04:54,768
Jessica! Please!

1110
01:04:55,036 --> 01:04:56,070
Stop!

1111
01:04:56,137 --> 01:04:58,139
No!

1112
01:04:58,538 --> 01:05:00,875
- Don't do it! No!
- Ashes to ashes.

1113
01:05:02,109 --> 01:05:03,044
Dust to dust.

1114
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:04,879
No, Jessica!

1115
01:05:05,545 --> 01:05:06,545
Oh, my god!

1116
01:05:11,217 --> 01:05:13,120
Just like cooking veal.

1117
01:05:13,253 --> 01:05:14,587
Oh, my god.

1118
01:05:16,023 --> 01:05:18,725
Please, Jessica, no!

1119
01:05:22,762 --> 01:05:24,799
Help me!

1120
01:05:25,132 --> 01:05:26,633
No!

1121
01:05:28,401 --> 01:05:29,536
No!

1122
01:05:30,403 --> 01:05:33,640
- Anna, run!
- Jessica! No!

1123
01:05:36,676 --> 01:05:39,446
Motherfucker!

1124
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:44,651
- Anna!
- Mom!

1125
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:47,654
Oh, god. Vivienne. Vivienne.

1126
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:49,990
Oh, god, Vivienne.

1127
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:52,893
Oh, my god!

1128
01:05:53,393 --> 01:05:57,330
Shit. Vivienne! Fuck!

1129
01:06:03,037 --> 01:06:04,939
Honey, no, it's okay.

1130
01:06:05,238 --> 01:06:07,007
Come here, Anna.
Anna, look at me.

1131
01:06:07,174 --> 01:06:10,010
Look at me. Are you okay?
Are you okay? Okay.

1132
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:13,080
All right. Honey. Oh, god.

1133
01:06:13,379 --> 01:06:16,083
- No keys. Shit, shit, shit.
- Isaac has all the keys.

1134
01:06:16,183 --> 01:06:20,187
Oh, dad has the other key.
Honey, honey, you have to stay.

1135
01:06:20,487 --> 01:06:21,989
- Okay, listen to me.
- What?

1136
01:06:22,056 --> 01:06:23,256
If you see Isaac,

1137
01:06:23,423 --> 01:06:24,691
- you're gonna scream...
- No.

1138
01:06:24,825 --> 01:06:26,268
- And then you shoot him.
- No, no, no.

1139
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:27,670
- Mom, I can't do this.
- You can do this.

1140
01:06:27,694 --> 01:06:29,997
- You can't... I can't do this.
- You're gonna do this.

1141
01:06:30,064 --> 01:06:31,731
Listen to me. You're gonna aim

1142
01:06:31,866 --> 01:06:33,626
and you're gonna shoot
and I'll come running.

1143
01:06:33,666 --> 01:06:36,369
You're gonna aim at his eyes, okay?

1144
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:38,404
- Listen to me.
- I can't do this, mom!

1145
01:06:38,471 --> 01:06:39,472
Listen to me.

1146
01:06:40,074 --> 01:06:42,943
If I don't try to save your dad,
you will never forgive me.

1147
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:45,745
Okay. Okay.

1148
01:06:46,579 --> 01:06:48,048
Mom, what are you gonna do?

1149
01:06:48,215 --> 01:06:49,917
Take this. It's mace.

1150
01:06:50,383 --> 01:06:52,719
I'm gonna find Isaac.

1151
01:07:17,744 --> 01:07:18,779
Isaac?

1152
01:07:23,284 --> 01:07:25,718
Isaac.

1153
01:07:34,494 --> 01:07:36,462
Grandpappy needs you.

1154
01:07:37,932 --> 01:07:39,699
He's hurt real bad.

1155
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:55,448
John?

1156
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:14,134
Hello?

1157
01:08:22,977 --> 01:08:26,180
John?

1158
01:08:51,738 --> 01:08:54,208
John?

1159
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:55,876
John.

1160
01:09:04,218 --> 01:09:05,218
Jess...

1161
01:09:12,226 --> 01:09:15,396
Is Anna okay?

1162
01:09:15,863 --> 01:09:18,665
She's fine.

1163
01:09:18,731 --> 01:09:21,335
Isaac said
that Vivienne is here...

1164
01:09:24,872 --> 01:09:27,174
And they killed her.

1165
01:09:27,241 --> 01:09:28,241
No.

1166
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:30,743
Vivienne's...

1167
01:09:30,811 --> 01:09:34,048
Vivienne's alive.

1168
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:38,551
She's... she's waiting for you.

1169
01:09:48,594 --> 01:09:50,530
John, do you have the car keys?

1170
01:09:53,934 --> 01:09:55,235
Isaac took them.

1171
01:09:59,472 --> 01:10:00,773
Jessica...

1172
01:10:02,642 --> 01:10:07,815
Tell Vivienne I love her.

1173
01:10:08,614 --> 01:10:12,585
I will.

1174
01:10:47,955 --> 01:10:48,955
Hey.

1175
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:50,623
Mom!

1176
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:53,360
Don't come any closer.

1177
01:10:53,659 --> 01:10:55,963
- Or what?
- Or I'll shoot you.

1178
01:10:57,031 --> 01:10:59,166
Mom, it's Isaac! Mom!

1179
01:11:00,834 --> 01:11:02,602
You ever even shot a gun before?

1180
01:11:04,405 --> 01:11:06,907
Did you hurt my dad?

1181
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:09,343
You're so pretty when you cry.

1182
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:11,945
You're such a good girl, Anna.

1183
01:11:12,578 --> 01:11:14,314
So sweet and pure
in your nature.

1184
01:11:14,515 --> 01:11:18,118
Stop it. Stop talking.

1185
01:11:19,019 --> 01:11:20,354
I know
what you're going through.

1186
01:11:20,921 --> 01:11:22,588
I've been there too.

1187
01:11:24,124 --> 01:11:25,859
You deserve better
than your parents.

1188
01:11:26,493 --> 01:11:27,660
You deserve love.

1189
01:11:28,362 --> 01:11:29,863
My parents love me.

1190
01:11:31,932 --> 01:11:33,300
Treat you like an afterbirth.

1191
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,335
That's not true.

1192
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:37,805
That's not true!

1193
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:39,840
You want to go
for a ride with me?

1194
01:11:40,908 --> 01:11:41,908
No.

1195
01:11:42,209 --> 01:11:43,877
But you don't even know
where I'm headed.

1196
01:11:46,547 --> 01:11:48,681
I can show you things
you can't even dream of.

1197
01:11:51,717 --> 01:11:53,353
Got a little boat
tied up out back.

1198
01:11:53,686 --> 01:11:55,222
Grandpappy didn't even
know about it.

1199
01:11:56,423 --> 01:11:59,893
We can disappear into the bayou.
No one will ever see us again.

1200
01:12:01,428 --> 01:12:03,197
I don't make this
offer to many girls.

1201
01:12:04,364 --> 01:12:06,033
It's a rare gem of an offer.

1202
01:12:07,234 --> 01:12:08,234
Just like you.

1203
01:12:10,003 --> 01:12:11,003
A rare gem.

1204
01:12:14,508 --> 01:12:15,675
Anna!

1205
01:12:29,123 --> 01:12:30,124
Mom!

1206
01:12:31,225 --> 01:12:33,160
Let her go!

1207
01:12:33,327 --> 01:12:36,296
Whoa, whoa. Whoa,
whoa. Can't do that, ma'am.

1208
01:12:37,097 --> 01:12:39,566
See, I'm thinking about taking
your daughter here as my wife.

1209
01:12:39,665 --> 01:12:40,934
Hardly seen a prettier girl.

1210
01:12:41,068 --> 01:12:42,588
You'll go to hell
for what you've done.

1211
01:12:42,635 --> 01:12:43,636
Been there already.

1212
01:12:44,037 --> 01:12:45,806
Not much to see
compared to earth.

1213
01:12:46,807 --> 01:12:49,243
Anna, stay strong.

1214
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:52,346
You know
why this happened, don't you?

1215
01:12:53,013 --> 01:12:56,316
See, your husband hired me
and grandpappy to kill you.

1216
01:13:00,087 --> 01:13:01,188
That's not true.

1217
01:13:01,622 --> 01:13:02,655
Oh, sure it is.

1218
01:13:03,123 --> 01:13:05,893
See, he thought
we were just country folk.

1219
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,862
Didn't understand
the nature of the beast.

1220
01:13:10,663 --> 01:13:14,334
Truth is John's the one
who needed to be killed.

1221
01:13:15,102 --> 01:13:16,102
Not you.

1222
01:13:19,907 --> 01:13:21,308
Or your lovely, little Anna.

1223
01:13:23,676 --> 01:13:24,845
Oh, fuck!

1224
01:13:24,912 --> 01:13:26,246
Oh, fuck!

1225
01:13:26,746 --> 01:13:28,282
No!

1226
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:30,784
Don't hurt my mom.

1227
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,655
Hey, hey.

1228
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,224
Hey.

1229
01:13:39,793 --> 01:13:42,262
Hold on. Let's talk about this.

1230
01:13:43,197 --> 01:13:46,600
If you're righteous,
you'll survive.

1231
01:14:05,986 --> 01:14:09,923
I was just joshing
about marrying your daughter.

1232
01:14:11,692 --> 01:14:13,759
From where I sit,

1233
01:14:14,528 --> 01:14:16,230
marriage is just
a pit of spikes.

1234
01:14:16,563 --> 01:14:18,098
Who the hell are you?

1235
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:22,703
I see myself as a moral compass.

1236
01:14:23,136 --> 01:14:26,907
People spin
in the wrong direction,

1237
01:14:27,341 --> 01:14:28,442
I set 'em straight.

1238
01:14:33,213 --> 01:14:35,849
Me and the old man
built this house

1239
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:38,385
for people just like your husband.

1240
01:14:39,752 --> 01:14:42,456
Murderers, liars, cheaters

1241
01:14:43,357 --> 01:14:45,025
and sinners are all alike.

1242
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:47,760
They're drawn to it
like a magnet.

1243
01:14:48,929 --> 01:14:50,330
It's my task to kill 'em.

1244
01:14:50,864 --> 01:14:52,032
You're insane.

1245
01:14:52,366 --> 01:14:55,068
I've been alive for centuries.

1246
01:14:57,671 --> 01:14:58,972
Maybe I'm a demon.

1247
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,309
Or maybe I'm an angel.

1248
01:15:03,577 --> 01:15:05,345
Or just a really confused kid.

1249
01:15:22,562 --> 01:15:23,864
Here.

1250
01:15:23,997 --> 01:15:26,066
Take 'em.

1251
01:15:33,674 --> 01:15:35,876
Anna.

1252
01:15:40,047 --> 01:15:41,248
Honey, Isaac's dying.

1253
01:15:41,315 --> 01:15:43,116
- I'm fucking scared, mom.
- We have to go.

1254
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:44,918
Go. Go! We have to go.

1255
01:15:44,985 --> 01:15:47,454
Everything's
gonna be okay. Run. Run! Run.

1256
01:15:47,521 --> 01:15:49,990
Run. Run.

1257
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:09,376
Thank god.

1258
01:16:20,654 --> 01:16:21,654
Check your phone.

1259
01:16:21,922 --> 01:16:23,457
Check your phone
right now, please.

1260
01:16:23,557 --> 01:16:26,193
Do you have a signal?

1261
01:16:26,259 --> 01:16:28,662
I don't have any.
Why isn't it working, mom?

1262
01:16:28,729 --> 01:16:30,230
It's not working.

1263
01:16:30,464 --> 01:16:31,531
Did Isaac hurt you?

1264
01:16:31,865 --> 01:16:33,433
Did he... did he touch you?

1265
01:16:33,801 --> 01:16:35,736
- No.
- No?

1266
01:16:36,069 --> 01:16:38,438
We left dad there, mom.

1267
01:16:38,538 --> 01:16:41,375
We have to go back.
What about dad, mom?

1268
01:16:41,475 --> 01:16:43,510
- What about... what about dad?
- What about dad?

1269
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:46,012
Listen to me. We're safe.

1270
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,784
That's what matters.
That we're safe right now.

1271
01:16:49,851 --> 01:16:50,951
We're safe.

1272
01:17:08,402 --> 01:17:10,704
And I keep telling you,
there are no houses out there.

1273
01:17:11,004 --> 01:17:12,272
Not like the one you described.

1274
01:17:12,539 --> 01:17:15,810
Yeah, something went wrong
with my phone and my computer

1275
01:17:15,909 --> 01:17:18,211
and the pictures
aren't there anymore.

1276
01:17:18,745 --> 01:17:20,113
It's not like
I don't believe you.

1277
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:23,483
We were inside that house.
I was the real estate agent.

1278
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,719
The house is real
and we need to find it

1279
01:17:25,787 --> 01:17:26,787
and my husband.

1280
01:17:27,053 --> 01:17:29,423
And we need to find Isaac
and... and the old man.

1281
01:17:32,392 --> 01:17:36,163
- It's easy to get confused on the bayou.
- We're not confused.

1282
01:17:36,696 --> 01:17:38,398
Isaac tried to kill us.

1283
01:17:39,499 --> 01:17:41,368
And my dad is dead.

1284
01:17:42,002 --> 01:17:44,171
Like I said,
deputies will be dispatched.

1285
01:17:45,472 --> 01:17:46,983
Listen, I don't know
what really went on

1286
01:17:47,007 --> 01:17:48,167
between you and your husband,

1287
01:17:48,475 --> 01:17:50,143
but if he's out there, we'll find him.

1288
01:17:50,343 --> 01:17:52,412
He's probably just disoriented.

1289
01:17:52,979 --> 01:17:54,014
He may still be alive.

1290
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,784
You haven't heard a word I said.

1291
01:17:56,918 --> 01:17:59,052
I heard you,
but you're not making any sense.

1292
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:00,454
Take me to this address.

1293
01:18:01,021 --> 01:18:04,591
I wanna to see it myself.

1294
01:18:05,058 --> 01:18:07,494
There are no homes around here.
It's just swamp.

1295
01:18:08,562 --> 01:18:09,562
I'm ready when you are.

1296
01:18:09,629 --> 01:18:11,765
And my daughter's
gonna stay here in the station.

1297
01:18:11,998 --> 01:18:13,099
Mom...

1298
01:18:13,835 --> 01:18:16,069
It's safer if I leave you here.

1299
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:19,039
Like you left dad?

1300
01:18:19,907 --> 01:18:21,141
Is he safe?

1301
01:18:26,948 --> 01:18:30,383
I promise, I will be back
in a couple hours.

1302
01:19:38,819 --> 01:19:41,421
I swear, there was a house.

1303
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:46,192
It was... it was a big house.

1304
01:19:50,096 --> 01:19:53,166
Uh. And there was a fire
in... in the driveway.

1305
01:19:56,003 --> 01:19:57,137
Where?

1306
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:58,471
It was there.

1307
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:04,578
It was... it was...
It was right here.

1308
01:20:05,278 --> 01:20:07,581
Like I said,
it's easy to get confused.

1309
01:20:08,049 --> 01:20:10,051
I... I'm not confused. I'm not.

1310
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:12,920
Then you tell me,
are we at the wrong place?

1311
01:20:13,219 --> 01:20:17,223
No. I don't know.

1312
01:20:19,426 --> 01:20:22,362
Look, I'm happy to take you
somewhere else, within reason.

1313
01:20:31,671 --> 01:20:33,373
It happened here.

1314
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:28,795
You're right.

1315
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:37,270
There's nothing here.

1316
01:21:41,075 --> 01:21:42,342
There's no house.

1317
01:21:46,981 --> 01:21:48,281
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1318
01:21:52,987 --> 01:21:54,521
Take me back to the station.

1319
01:22:09,202 --> 01:22:11,014
You know, to be honest,
you're not the first person

1320
01:22:11,038 --> 01:22:12,318
to come to me with a crazy story

1321
01:22:12,372 --> 01:22:13,606
about a house.

1322
01:22:17,144 --> 01:22:18,645
Can you drive faster, please?

1323
01:22:19,113 --> 01:22:20,547
First, I need you
to do me a favor.

1324
01:22:20,747 --> 01:22:22,983
- What?
- Open the glove compartment.

1325
01:22:31,092 --> 01:22:32,392
Oh, my god.

1326
01:22:33,794 --> 01:22:35,963
But this was in the house.
How did you get it?

1327
01:22:36,997 --> 01:22:38,899
That means
we have Isaac on tape.

1328
01:22:39,466 --> 01:22:40,567
Turn it on.

1329
01:22:43,871 --> 01:22:45,538
<i>We're right behind you, ma'am.</i>

1330
01:22:50,276 --> 01:22:51,511
Oh, my god.

1331
01:22:52,046 --> 01:22:54,481
Turn this off.

1332
01:22:54,681 --> 01:22:56,516
It's on all the stations.

1333
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:58,919
That's not...
This can't be happening.

1334
01:23:00,487 --> 01:23:05,391
<i>♪ Tell me the truth ♪</i>

1335
01:23:06,526 --> 01:23:12,032
<i>♪ please stop me from guessing ♪</i>

1336
01:23:14,634 --> 01:23:19,606
<i>♪ darling, it will be
a blessing ♪</i>

1337
01:23:22,642 --> 01:23:26,080
<i>♪ if you will only
tell me the truth ♪</i>

1338
01:23:29,049 --> 01:23:31,584
It was... them.

1339
01:23:34,687 --> 01:23:35,687
Take a breath.

1340
01:23:37,992 --> 01:23:38,992
It's not real.

1341
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,594
No, it can't be.

1342
01:23:47,101 --> 01:23:49,502
Isaac and grandpappy
help us keep order.

1343
01:23:51,205 --> 01:23:53,373
I don't know what they are.
They're not human.

1344
01:23:54,374 --> 01:23:55,542
You're crazy.

1345
01:23:57,011 --> 01:23:58,311
We protect Isaac,

1346
01:23:58,678 --> 01:24:00,647
and he takes care
of the evildoers.

1347
01:24:01,982 --> 01:24:04,018
Like a spider catching flies.

1348
01:24:04,484 --> 01:24:06,020
He sends them straight to hell.

1349
01:24:10,057 --> 01:24:11,091
It's an illusion.

1350
01:24:11,258 --> 01:24:12,392
Tell yourself that.

1351
01:24:12,759 --> 01:24:15,029
The bayou plays a lot of tricks.

1352
01:24:18,364 --> 01:24:20,100
I'm gonna tell everyone
what happened.

1353
01:24:20,733 --> 01:24:22,335
Who would believe you?

1354
01:24:23,703 --> 01:24:26,573
Isaac doesn't hurt
the righteous, only the wicked.

1355
01:24:29,442 --> 01:24:30,743
But I'm not wicked.

1356
01:24:32,412 --> 01:24:33,848
It's a matter of degrees.

1357
01:24:37,852 --> 01:24:39,686
Heaven and hell
are a choice away.

1358
01:24:40,788 --> 01:24:43,991
Isaac gave you
a second chance. Embrace it.

1359
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:46,492
Be kind.

1360
01:24:48,062 --> 01:24:50,763
And never come back
to the house on the bayou.

1361
01:25:15,923 --> 01:25:17,091
- Anna?
- Mom.

1362
01:25:17,258 --> 01:25:18,258
Anna.

1363
01:25:19,126 --> 01:25:20,828
Oh, thank god.

1364
01:25:21,328 --> 01:25:24,631
It's okay.

1365
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:28,401
I love you.

1366
01:25:28,468 --> 01:25:29,636
Oh, honey.

1367
01:25:30,637 --> 01:25:32,438
I'm never leaving you again.
