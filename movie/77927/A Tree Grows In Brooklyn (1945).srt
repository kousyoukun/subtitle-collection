2
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:38,057
This will be the last of them now,
Francie.

3
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:40,599
ls Dad home, Mom? can we go now?

4
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:43,603
Not so loud, Keeley, do you want to
wake your Papa up?

5
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,309
Gosh, Francie, ain't you through
with them old dishes yet?

6
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,477
She'll only be a minute.

7
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,189
My, l wish he was as anxious to get

8
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,515
going on school mornings as he is on
Saturdays.

9
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:52,805
Papa was late last night.

10
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:54,726
Yeah l was dead asleep when he come
in, l guess.

11
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:57,770
He said if people didn't like to
make speeches so much at dinners,

12
00:01:58,028 --> 00:01:59,568
waiters could spend more time with
their families.

13
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,269
Oh, it wasn't much of a job, l guess.
Them club dinners don't tip much.

14
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:06,981
ls that all, Mama?

15
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,065
Yes, yes. Go on, l'll dry 'em.

16
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:11,196
Don't look like you got much there
this week.

17
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,073
One of these days Mrs. Gabish

18
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:15,530
is going to throw away that
old wash boiler of hers.

19
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:18,108
Carney will pay us plenty for the
copper bottom off of that.

20
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:19,862
He won't pay you any more than he
have to.

21
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,613
You watch him on that weighing now.

22
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,451
Yes'm.

23
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:24,446
Oh, parents ought to have a day
thaùs like

24
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:26,412
Saturday is for kids. Go on.

25
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:29,497
Maybe if l start in the lower hall
and scrub my way up today

26
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:30,862
iùll make something
special out of it for me.

27
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:32,617
Keep an eye on him, Francie.

28
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:34,416
Come on!
- Yes, Mama!

29
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,209
They done good today. Come on.

30
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:01,459
Man throws cigarette
package in gutter,

31
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,382
Francie blocks boy
from diving for it.

32
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:11,845
Neeley!

33
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,093
All right, pickers!

34
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:20,015
Come on!

35
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:26,436
Now look, stand on the same
side as him when he weighs

36
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:28,311
it so's he can reach it.

37
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:30,969
And don't forget to stand there
after he pays you.

38
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:34,017
You forgot that last time.
And a penny's a penny ain't it?

39
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:37,024
Well, l guess l know what it is.
Well all right then.

40
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:42,185
Three cents!

41
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:43,771
Look, that stuff's worth more than
that!

42
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:45,569
Shut up! l say what things are worth
around here!

43
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:47,900
Who's next?

44
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:51,895
Oh, hello little girl! Come on.

45
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:54,448
Shut up! Shut up!

46
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:16,489
You done fine.
Nine cents. Three, five, nine...

47
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:23,492
There you are. An extra penny
because you're a nice little girl.

48
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:27,202
Thaùs better. Gosh! l wish Carney
liked to pinch boys.

49
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:28,741
Nine and my pinching penny.

50
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:30,663
Thirty nine.

51
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:33,328
lùs a pen setter!
- Ah! No! lt ain't so!

52
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:43,299
Let me! ...Twenty six!...
A pen wiper.

53
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:26,850
Something you want, little girl?

54
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:30,442
l'm merely looking, thank you.
l have a right. l have money.

55
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:38,688
Step on a crack...
break your mother's back...

56
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,740
Here she comes, Jesus!

57
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:56,196
Neeley! Neeley, we gotta go home!

58
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:57,369
Beat it!

59
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,204
Mama said.
- Mama said.

60
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:03,621
l'll beat you!

61
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:04,954
Oh, no you won't!

62
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,336
Heaven's sake! ls it that late
already?

63
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:13,451
Well, l guess l 'll just let these
stairs go'til later.

64
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:14,494
Four cents, Mom!

65
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,663
Well, thaùs pretty good. Dump the
bucket, Keeley.

66
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:17,373
Mama, can l...

67
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:19,173
No. Dump the bucket and bring it...

68
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:23,005
Today's the day for the insurance
collector and l sure don't want him

69
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,499
to catch me looking like this.

70
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,459
Hot, ain't it?

71
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,124
Yeah. But Christmas will be here
before you know it.

72
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,093
Got enough troubles without worrying
about that.

73
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,004
How's your sister today, Henry?

74
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:33,962
Poorly, thank you.

75
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,593
Well, hello, Flossie dear.

76
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,971
Hello, Mrs. Nolan, don't you notice
something?

77
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:48,182
well, you look like you was feeling
better, much better,

78
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:49,348
don't she Francie?

79
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:51,760
No, l don't! l don't!

80
00:06:56,272 --> 00:06:57,930
Heat up the coffee while
l fix supper.

81
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:02,891
Right there.

82
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:17,318
Mom!

83
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:18,651
Yes, Neeley?

84
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,396
Mom, if there was a rule about
something,

85
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:24,610
that doesn't mean you couldn't do
something else once in a while...

86
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,865
Neeley, you cannot have any of those
pennies to buy an ice cream cone.

87
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:31,070
They go in the bank the same as
usual. Bring them in here, Neeley.

88
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,537
Half of everything we get goes into
that bank.

89
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,902
Thaùs the way it is and thaùs the
way iùs going to be.

90
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:38,538
Now put them in there.

91
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:41,623
Gosh, l bet we got about a hundred
dollars in that old bank by now.

92
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:43,699
Nine's more like it.

93
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,616
Mama! Mama! They're cutting the tree.

94
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,578
Oh, thaùs too bad.

95
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,998
That was kind of pretty there with
the bird sitting in it sometimes.

96
00:07:58,255 --> 00:07:59,997
Papa loved that tree.

97
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:03,089
Aw, quit mooning over it. lt got in
the way of the washing.

98
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,332
Tree ain't gonna put no pennies in
the bank.

99
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:12,507
Mr. Barker. Get out the good cup
and saucer and give it a wipe.

100
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,424
And Francie,

101
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:16,132
you can stay in the room if you want
to while Mr. Barker is here.

102
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:19,881
How do you do, Mr. Barker?

103
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:20,968
How do you do, Francie?

104
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:23,594
Mommy is temporarily detained but
will join you directly.

105
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,342
Hello, Neeley.
- Hello.

106
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,306
l might fancy you get manners right
out of the book.

107
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:30,760
And company or no company,
Mrs. Nolan always looks the lady.

108
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:33,056
You should see some of my people.

109
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,267
Even ladies with husbands that work
steady.

110
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,389
Won't you go. into the parlor and
have a cup of coffee?

111
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:41,136
That l will. And your hospitality is
very kind, Mrs. Nolan.

112
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,304
Well, old man Gentry is off to jail
again.

113
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,845
Oh, thaùs too bad.

114
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:47,850
But she's keeping up his insurance,
just the same.

115
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:51,522
And here's ours. Ten cents for me,
ten cents for Mr. Nolan,

116
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:53,235
a nickel for each of the
children.

117
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:54,648
And you'll never regret it, Mrs.
Nolan.

118
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:57,652
A fine funeral for every member of
the family, heaven forbid.

119
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,191
And now your weekly receipts,
Mrs. Nolan.

120
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:03,481
Now, there's one party, not very far
from here, l wouldn't like to say who

121
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,281
that didn't get any receipts
this week.

122
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:08,908
And naming no names, l will say that
iùs a family that the angel of

123
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,861
death has marked on his invitation
list, heaven forbid.

124
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,109
Henny says his sister's got one foot
in the grave.

125
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:15,945
Neeley!

126
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:18,906
lùll mean problems for you, most
likely. And thank you, Francie.

127
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:20,241
Well, thaùs what people get,

128
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:23,662
wasting good money to give her
dresses instead of insurance.

129
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:25,741
Dresses thaùll last longer than she
will.

130
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,286
All depends on what folks thinks is
important.

131
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,579
But Papa says that...
- Thaùs right, Mr. Barker,

132
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,872
it all depends on what folks
thinks is important.

133
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,244
Oh, and how is Mr. Nolan? ls he
working or not working?

134
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:40,456
Some tell me one thing, some another.
Of course, l don't listen.

135
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,537
Mr. Nolan being a singing waiter,
Mr. Barker,

136
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:45,919
and what you might call an
artist, his work don't come steady

137
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:47,086
like other people.

138
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,332
But l'm sure you'll remember when
you talk to folks

139
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:52,163
that the Nolans have always paid
their insurance on the dot.

140
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,299
Oh, you surely don't think l go
around spreading gossip

141
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,962
about my clients, Mrs. Nolan

142
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,922
Oh, sure not. And how's my mother,
Mr. Barker?

143
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:01,668
ln the prime, Mrs. Nolan,
as fine as can be.

144
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,506
And she says to tell you she'll be
over...

145
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:06,597
oh, over tonight same as usual.

146
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:11,296
And, l trust you're pleased with the
news about your sister?

147
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:14,261
Well, just what news do you mean, Mr.
Barker?

148
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:17,268
Oh, well she must be saving it to
surprise with tonight

149
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,977
when the family's all here together.

150
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:21,718
l'd take it kindly if you told me
what you mean.

151
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,926
Well, l trot around, same as usual,
to collect her weekly dime

152
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:27,303
and what do you think happens?

153
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:29,935
Sell, sir, she gives me two dimes.

154
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:31,981
Yes, sir, she's done it again.

155
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,640
She's got herself a brand new
husband.

156
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,015
Oh, no.

157
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:38,352
Well, now, l suppose you mean about
her still being married.

158
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:41,100
l don't mind saying, l had the same
thought myself.

159
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:42,820
But, l'm sure it must be all right.

160
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,944
She must have made some arrangement.

161
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:47,947
l'm quite sure she did, Mr. Barker.
l'm sure that anything...

162
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:49,312
Does she call this one Bill too?

163
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:52,277
You children run along now and do
the marketing.

164
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:53,648
Go on, take some money
from the cup...

165
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:55,071
Oh, but Mom, l want to hear about...

166
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:56,949
Take the money from the cup and get
a five cent soup bone off of Haslin.

167
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:59,027
Don't get the chopped meat off him,
though.

168
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,775
He grinds it behind closed doors,
and heaven only knows.

169
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,116
Go to Werner's for the meat.

170
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,742
Ask for round steak, chopped,
ten cents worth.

171
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,823
And don't let him give it to you off
the plate.

172
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:09,196
And ask him to chop it in.

173
00:11:09,457 --> 00:11:13,783
And then just at the last ask for a
piece of suet to fry it with.

174
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,500
But he won't always do that, Mama.

175
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,873
Tell him your Mama said.
And then go for the bread.

176
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:19,324
lùs Saturday, Mama, and...

177
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:21,873
All right, ask for a nice pie,
not too crushed. Now, go on.

178
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:24,286
But, Mama, we know Aunt
Sissy's been married before!

179
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:26,454
Thaùs not...
- Sure. l can remember two Uncle Bills.

180
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:27,993
Thaùs nothing for you to talk about.

181
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:29,879
Now run along now and get things
done.

182
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:37,044
You got no right, Mr. Barker,

183
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:38,878
to be carrying tales about
my sister as though.

184
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:40,463
there were something wrong.

185
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:45,095
She may be funny some ways, but she
wouldn't do nothing wrong.

186
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,587
So, l'd like it if you didn't talk
to people like it was.

187
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:51,179
Strike nee dead if l'd ever think of
mentioning it to anyone but you...

188
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:52,712
Yeah, sure, l know.

189
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:57,300
Well, you might as well go on now
and tell me what you do know.

190
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,345
No point in my being the only one
that don't hear it.

191
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:02,430
Well...

192
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,096
Ten cents worth of round steak, do
you want it ground?

193
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:05,895
No, thank you.
- You sure?

194
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:08,718
lt wasn't twenty minutes ago l
ground that whole plate full fresh.

195
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,143
No, thank you.

196
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:20,682
Oh, l forgot, now. My Mama wants it
ground.

197
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:23,564
You don't tell me.

198
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:26,480
And she said to chop that in with it.

199
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:28,859
She did?

200
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,607
And a piece of suet to fry it with
Mama said.

201
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,820
Sweet jumping chrystophers.

202
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:54,081
You know? Mama thinks we don't know
anything.

203
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,489
Yeah, she acts like we were kids or
something.

204
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,990
l bet she has a fight with Aunt
Sissy tonight.

205
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:02,203
lùs got something to do with men
liking Aunt Sissy too much.

206
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,748
Well, Papa says we oughta make
everybody like us.

207
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:06,580
l guess maybe ladies shouldn't.

208
00:13:06,837 --> 00:13:09,671
Maybe Aunt Sissy wouldn't have
changed husbands too much if any of

209
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,589
her babies would have lived.
She's crazy about babies.

210
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,755
Look who's talking about babies.
A lot you know.

211
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:17,169
l know as much as you do.

212
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:18,669
You don't know nothing.

213
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:20,882
You think you're so smart.
Boys make me sick.

214
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,842
Well what do you think girls make
people?

215
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:23,628
Here she comes!

216
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,263
Six loaves!

217
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:42,176
And a pie, not too crushed.

218
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:45,803
BreaÔs fine.

219
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:47,934
l wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't
more than three days old.

220
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:49,728
ls that all, Mom? Can we go now?

221
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,643
Yes, you're free.

222
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,185
Where's the fire?

223
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,982
There's a scout for the Brooklyns
tomorrow.

224
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,264
They're looking for a catcher.

225
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:01,723
Where are you going?

226
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:02,933
Oh, no place much.

227
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:04,900
Well, don't go dream-walking,
crossing the street.

228
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:26,740
T... U... Burton:
"Anatomy of Melancholy".

229
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,540
Burton: "Anatomy of Melancholy"

230
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:56,123
Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy"?
Are you sure you want this?

231
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:57,210
Yes, ma'am.

232
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:59,290
Don't you think iùs a trifle over
your head?

233
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,129
Yes, ma'am.

234
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:01,545
Then why did you select it?

235
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,796
Well, l've read all the authors
beginning with "A",

236
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:08,886
and all the "Bs" down to Burton.
lùs next.

237
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:11,969
You mean you're trying to read your
way straight through the library?

238
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,418
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,303
But, a book like this, you'll only
be confused.

240
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:17,381
Please, l want to read clear through
the alphabet.

241
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,596
l want to know everything in the
world.

242
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:27,594
Well, all right. Only, do something
for me, won't you?

243
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:29,132
Take another book too. Here:

244
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:34,267
"When Knighthood Was in
Flower". Just for fun. lùs Saturday.

245
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:36,976
l'll have a headache thinking about
you wrestling with

246
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:38,974
"The Anatomy of Melancholy"
all weekend.

247
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:40,772
Will you?

248
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,896
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:56,236
A little more to the left,
Mr. Crackenbach.

250
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,653
You think l want to see me clothes
hanging with your wash up there!

251
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:03,356
Don't you forget to fix mine,
Mr. Crackenbach!

252
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:06,284
Maybe you'd like to come up here and
fix it yourselves.

253
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:08,775
And thaùs just what you'll be doing
if you don't shut up!

254
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,110
Mr. Crackenbachl...

255
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,085
...a wheelbarrow, through streets
broad and narrow, crying cockles

256
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:42,042
and mussels alive alive oh.

257
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:42,795
l won! l won!

258
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:45,124
Well, now, l wouldn't be too sure
about that if l was you.

259
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:47,422
But l did. l got it open before you
finished and thaùs the rule.

260
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:49,751
But l came up one flight two steps
at a time before l remembered.

261
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,923
Don't that make a difference?

262
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:51,841
No, sir. The rules say that

263
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,422
And in a manner of speaking, you
never did stop me at all,

264
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,337
because my heart kept right
on singing.

265
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:57,095
Papa, you're joking.

266
00:16:57,346 --> 00:16:59,551
Well, l guess l'll let you get away
with it this time, Prima Donna.

267
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:01,263
And where's your beautiful Mama?

268
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:01,799
Finishing the hall.

269
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:03,929
She must be on the top floor or
she'd have heard you.

270
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:06,174
Well, in that case, why aren't you
getting busy?

271
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,010
Why aren't you laying out my
clothes?

272
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:11,764
Oh, Papa, you always make fun. You
know you haven't any more clothes.

273
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:13,761
Haven't any more clothes, huh?
Whaùs this?

274
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:15,182
A tie.
- And this?

275
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:16,468
A dickie.
- And this?

276
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:18,009
An apron.
- Well, them's clothes, ain't they?

277
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,895
And you'd better be getting that
apron ironed too.

278
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:21,771
Oh, Papa, you've got a job for
tonight?

279
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:22,888
You see the palm of that hand?

280
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:24,392
Thaùs right where l got the world
tonight.

281
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:25,395
Where's the job, Papa?

282
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:26,644
Klompers. A big wedding party.

283
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,650
And you know something, Prima Donna?
There'll be plenty of tips.

284
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:31,229
singing or waiting?
- Both.

285
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:34,319
Oh, maybe tonighùll be it. Maybe
tonight he'll be there.

286
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,518
The impresario.

287
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:38,150
And he'll hear you sing, and he'll
put you on the stage!

288
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,684
And why not? Ain't l the Brooklyn
Thrush?

289
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:41,226
Oh, Papa!

290
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:44,441
And now you'd better be getting my
apron ironed.

291
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:46,406
Have it in a jiffy, Papa. The
coffee's on.

292
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:51,946
Thaùs my Prima Donna. Early one
morning, l heard a maiden singing.

293
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:54,442
Ear... Pst! Pst!

294
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:57,904
Oh, Papa, l can't sing.

295
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,070
Come on, now, you're holding up the
singing!

296
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,028
"Oh, don't deceive me, oh, don't you
leave me."

297
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,661
And better singing l never did hear.

298
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,741
l love to iron for you, Papa.

299
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,615
You know, something?

300
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,199
A day like this is just like
somebody gave you a present.

301
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,917
Everything just right.

302
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,287
l wonder what people did before they
invented coffee.

303
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:21,078
Oh, this sure could be a fine world,
if...

304
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:25,001
Hey, you know something, Prima
Donna?

305
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:27,295
You're going to make somebody a
mighty fine wife, some day.

306
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:28,711
Oh, Papa.

307
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:32,796
And mighty pretty, too. That is, if
your nose doesn't grow crooked.

308
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:35,837
Could it really? Honest?

309
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:39,212
Oh, no! lùs the prettiest nose in
all Brooklyn.

310
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,426
Oh, Papa, it isn't.
- who says it isn't?

311
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,636
You just tell me who said it and
l'll take care of 'em.

312
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,347
Papa, you're crazy!

313
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:46,760
And you know something else?

314
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:48,425
You're not going to be ironing like
this when that impresario

315
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:49,263
comes along.

316
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:51,259
Things are going to be different
around here, you wait and see!

317
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:52,217
Yes, Papa.

318
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:55,047
Hey, whaùs the wish you wish the
most when our ship comes sailing in?

319
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,385
Well, it already came true.

320
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:59,435
What is it? Come on and tell me.

321
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:04,927
Well, l wished that when you came
home today, you wouldn't be sick.

322
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,981
Oh, who told you to call it "sick"
baby?

323
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,565
Ah, you shouldn't waste your wishes
on things like that!

324
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:19,731
You should be saving 'em, for a silk
dress or something.

325
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:21,730
Haven't you got a better wish than
that?

326
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:23,528
Well...
- Come on!

327
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:26,437
Well, l hope Mama won't be too mad
with Aunt Sissy.

328
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,405
What about Aunt Sissy?

329
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:32,818
She's gone and got herself another
husband. Again!

330
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:38,446
No! Oh, oh, no! Gee, if there isn't
a woman for you!

331
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:40,694
Hey, what did -what did your Manna
say?

332
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:43,657
Well, she didn't like it.
- l can imagine that.

333
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:48,661
Couldn't you say something to her?
Not to be too mad to Aunt Sissy?

334
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,366
That l could, Prima Donna, and that
l will.

335
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,822
Oh, thank you, Papa.

336
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:58,075
Now, haven't you got just one little
wish for yourself? Just one wish?

337
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,995
Just for you.

338
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:04,292
Well... Did you see it, Papa?
- What?

339
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:06,704
Out the window. Our tree. They've
killed it!

340
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,965
Well, would you look at that now?

341
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:16,292
They didn't have any right to kill
it, did they, Papa?

342
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:21,212
Oh now, wait a minute. They didn't
kill it.

343
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,928
Why they couldn't kill that tree.

344
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:24,008
Honest?

345
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:25,127
Oh, why sure, baby.

346
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,877
Don't tell me that tree's gonna lay
down and die that easy.

347
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:31,553
Look at that tree, see where iùs
coming from?

348
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:34,214
Right up out of the cement.
Didn't nobody plant it.

349
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:37,047
lt didn't ask the cement could it
grow.

350
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,340
lt just couldn't help growing so
much it

351
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:40,011
pushed that old cement right
out of the way.

352
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:42,185
Why, when you're busting with
something like that,

353
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:43,550
can't anybody help it.

354
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:48,222
Like... Like that little old bird
right up there. Listen to him.

355
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:54,516
He didn't ask anybody could he sing,

356
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,517
and he certainly didn't take
any lessons.

357
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:59,977
He's so full of singing, iùs just
got to bust out someplace.

358
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:02,476
Why they could cut that old tree
right down to the ground

359
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:05,061
and a root would push up
someplace else in the cement.

360
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:07,112
You wait till Spring, Prima Donna
and you'll see.

361
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:11,902
Well, this ain't winning the family
bread, huh?

362
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:19,034
Come on, ain't you got one nice
little wish just for yourself?

363
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:24,944
No, Papa. l just...
- Just what?

364
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:28,119
l just love you so much, Papa.

365
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:33,659
Well, what do you know.

366
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:40,199
Listen, if l make a lot of tips
tonight, you know what l'm gonna do?

367
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,834
What Papa?

368
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:45,702
l'm gonna put two bucks on the nose
of a horse l know is running Monday.

369
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:48,878
And l'll win ten. Then l'll put it
on another horse.

370
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,828
And if l use my head, and l'm lucky,
l'll run it up to five hundred bucks.

371
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:55,791
Then you know what l'm gonna do?
- What Papa?

372
00:21:56,674 --> 00:22:02,211
l'm gonna take you on a trip. Just
you and me, on a regular train.

373
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:05,137
Maybe we'll go down south and see
the cotton.

374
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:08,255
You know, down where then cotton
blossoms blow?

375
00:22:08,512 --> 00:22:12,839
"Way down upon the Swannee River...

376
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:18,801
Far, far away..." You're a nice girl,
baby.

377
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:21,631
come on, we'll go up and tell your
Mama the news about my job.

378
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:30,602
Anybody seen Johnny Nolan's wife?

379
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:33,559
Johnny? You all right?

380
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:34,846
And why not?

381
00:22:35,107 --> 00:22:37,560
Ain't l married to the most
beautiful lady in all Williamsburg

382
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:38,597
Brooklyn?

383
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,608
Well, you're shouting so that
they'll hear you over to Manhattan.

384
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,566
Now, don't you get fresh with me
tonight, Mrs. Nolan.

385
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:45,561
lt happens l'm working. Klomper's.
Big wedding party.

386
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:47,277
Well, l thought you looked kinda
extra dressy.

387
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:49,437
l guess you won't get home until the
sun comes up.

388
00:22:49,696 --> 00:22:50,230
The later the better.

389
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:53,107
The more tips, the more fine silk
stockings for my wife's pretty legs.

390
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:55,355
Oh, silk stocking's is just what l
need.

391
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:57,073
Now, just wait a minute, Mrs. Nolan.

392
00:22:57,324 --> 00:22:58,782
Ain't you gonna give me a kiss for
luck?

393
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:00,195
oh, the whole house is looking.

394
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,564
Sure, l know they's looking, but who
cares.

395
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:03,734
This is the finest job l've had in
months.

396
00:23:03,994 --> 00:23:05,368
Maybe l'll get more from tonight.

397
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,491
Well, you'd better get on with it.
Good jobs don't wait.

398
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:10,115
But the job's no good without your
kissing me.

399
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:18,821
Well, you still got away with you,
Johnny Nolan.

400
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,917
Now go on, get out of here.
Before you know it,

401
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,289
the folks at that wedding
will be an old married couple.

402
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:25,705
Before you know it, l won't go at
all.

403
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,502
There's ain't the only wedding that
counts.

404
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:30,503
Take your hat arid get out of here
before someone else cops that job.

405
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:37,796
Our, ah, Francie tells me that
Sissy's gone and done it again.

406
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,916
Well, maybe he's a nice fella.
Don't be too hard on her, huh?

407
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:47,045
They was all nice fellas. Beat it?
now, Johnny.

408
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,091
Well, thaùs just a sample, madam.

409
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,751
lf you like my stock, drop me a card
and l'll be back again.

410
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:54,127
Good evening!

411
00:23:58,182 --> 00:24:02,806
Well, would you look at our
beautiful princess tonight

412
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,465
in a brand-new gown.

413
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:06,924
lùs made out of silk.

414
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:10,268
Silk? Oh, don't you tell me that.

415
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,140
This dress is made out of flower
petals and birÔs wings

416
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:15,933
and a little old piece of cloud.

417
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:23,890
Anybody can tell that. Oh, good
evening, Mr. Spencer.

418
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,896
Working tonight, Johnny?

419
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:28,767
Yeah, big wedding party. Oh, good
evening Miss Lizzie, Miss Maggie.

420
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:31,600
You're looking fine today,
indeed you are.

421
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:35,810
Thank you, ladies. Here comes the
Bride. HereGood evening, ladies.

422
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:36,439
Good evening!

423
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:43,740
Allow me, Princess.
Hi, Mr. Ching.

424
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:44,940
Hello.

425
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:46,742
Was did Mom say about Aunt Sissy?

426
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:49,364
Now don't worry about it,
everything's going to be all right.

427
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,741
Your Aunt Sissy's a fine woman,
Francie. Look at them things!...

428
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,444
There's no use talking. Some day l'm
gonna buy you them skates.

429
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,663
Mama says not to be too late, Papa.

430
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:05,453
Look, God invented time and when he
invents something,

431
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:06,739
there's always plenty of it.

432
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:08,494
There's your car, Papa.

433
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:10,126
Boy, look at them knives!

434
00:25:10,377 --> 00:25:12,001
Mama says time is money.

435
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:14,790
Well, l guess he wasn't worrying
much about money right then.

436
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,374
There's your car, Papa.

437
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,124
Well, l might as well catch it.

438
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:37,918
Supper's ready.

439
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,424
Y Hey, am l hungry!

440
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:41,139
And when weren't you hungry?
- Mama?

441
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,180
Yes, Francie.
- what does white mean?

442
00:25:43,432 --> 00:25:46,681
Oh, just white, l guess. What do you
mean, what does it mean?

443
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:48,344
Neeley, sit down at your place.

444
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,308
Well, why do girls always wear it
when they're married,

445
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:52,136
and when they're confirmed
and when they graduate?

446
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:54,184
Why does it always have to be white?

447
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:57,638
Just one of those things somebody
started. Lots of things like that.

448
00:25:57,896 --> 00:25:59,769
Will l have a white dress when l
graduate?

449
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:02,477
We'll see. Neeley will probably have
to have shoes by that time.

450
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:03,562
But, Mama!

451
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:04,231
Well, talk to him about it.

452
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:07,018
lf you can get him to quit coming
through the soles of his shoes...

453
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,519
Just because he's a boy.

454
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:12,024
All right, Mama, l will gladly do
without so my little brother can be

455
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:13,521
happy with new shoes.

456
00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:15,651
Little brother my eye...

457
00:26:15,904 --> 00:26:18,275
That will do. Francie, you read too
much.

458
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:21,402
Hey, Aunt Sissy!
- What did you bring us?

459
00:26:21,656 --> 00:26:23,564
l brought myself chickapeas, isn't
that enough?

460
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:25,317
Oh, and a couple of magazines from
the dentist.

461
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:27,482
Whaùs he need 'em for, or me
either?

462
00:26:27,742 --> 00:26:30,231
l can't read like my educated little
niece here.

463
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:31,358
Hello, Katie, my darling.

464
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:35,033
Good evening, sissy.

465
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:43,161
Well, you look fine, Katie.

466
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:46,165
Yeah, l look fine.

467
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:50,328
Who spilled the beans. Oh, l forgot,
it was old Barker's day here.

468
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:53,583
Where's Johnny? l was kinda counting
on him to be in my corner.

469
00:26:53,835 --> 00:26:55,115
Oh, sure. You and Johnny.

470
00:26:55,378 --> 00:26:55,662
Oh, look, Katie.

471
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,662
l didn't tell you because l wanted
to bring Bill around.

472
00:26:57,921 --> 00:27:01,086
But, l couldn't. He's home sleeping.
He's a milk man, you see.

473
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:05,714
Ah, listen. You're gonna wish me
happiness, ain't you?

474
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:09,628
Naturally, l'm going to wish you
happiness this time too.

475
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:12,171
Oh, golly, why can't you skip to the
part where you forgive me?

476
00:27:12,426 --> 00:27:13,624
You're going to before you're
through.

477
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:15,213
You know l'll get around you in the
end.

478
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,924
Why can't you just be human now and
get it over with? Huh?

479
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,301
Oh, there ain't no one like you to
get around

480
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,549
a person in the whole world.

481
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:24,839
Unless iùs Johnny. You're in time
for pie. Go on now and sit down.

482
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:28,181
Well, thaùs more like it. Thaùs my
kid sister talking.

483
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,713
Just coffee for me.

484
00:27:29,975 --> 00:27:31,766
l gotta get home soon and fix
breakfast for Bill.

485
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,093
Breakfast? At night?
- Yeah. Ain't it a riot?

486
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,177
We sleep all day long with the
shades pulled down

487
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:36,969
to keep out the sun.

488
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:39,598
And the window shut to keep out the
noise. lùs fun.

489
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:41,098
You don't live like nobody else.

490
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:42,385
No, you sure don't.

491
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:45,183
Easy on the whip kid. Now, wait til
you meet my Bill.

492
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,937
You and him will be...

493
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,478
Wouldn't you marry nobody if they
wasn't named Bill, Aunt Sis?

494
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,523
She might not remember them if they
wasn't.

495
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,686
Oh, Bill's got some other names.
Steve, l think it is.

496
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:55,974
But l always like Bill.

497
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:58,642
A good man's name with no stuck up
about it.

498
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:01,109
Oh, you'll be crazy about him, Katie.

499
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,899
Yeah? But the question is, how will
him and you get along?

500
00:28:04,156 --> 00:28:07,604
Oh, iùs wrong, Sissy, l mean, the
others...

501
00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:08,564
The others was wrong.

502
00:28:08,824 --> 00:28:11,230
Whaùs right about keeping on with a
guy you don't love each other any more?

503
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:12,654
But it ain't as easy as that!

504
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:15,529
l think Aunt Sissy's right about
when love is dead.

505
00:28:17,286 --> 00:28:18,365
Now look what you started.

506
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,327
lt ain't nothing to talk about in
front of them.

507
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:24,076
Every time you come here you fill
their heads with...

508
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,612
Go on downstairs for a while kids.

509
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,415
Your Mama's got a spanking up her
sleeve and

510
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:31,946
she ain't gonna feel
right until somebody gets it.

511
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:33,287
Might as well get it over with...

512
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:38,542
oh, you don't want to frown like
that, snuggle puff.

513
00:28:38,794 --> 00:28:40,833
The fellas don't go for that at all.

514
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,088
All right, kid, leùs have it. The
works.

515
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:52,336
l'm a disgrace.

516
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:53,421
You don't know what to do with me.

517
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:55,465
You can hardly face the neighbors
with what they must be saying.

518
00:28:55,718 --> 00:28:57,128
l'm old enough to know better.

519
00:28:57,385 --> 00:29:00,088
Go on, get it all off your chest, then
we can make up and forget about it.

520
00:29:00,345 --> 00:29:02,965
Thaùs right. Talk your way out of
it. You probably will, too.

521
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:04,134
Whaùd Mama have to say?

522
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:05,550
Well, you know Mama,
she don't say much.

523
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:07,132
Oh, sure, l know Mama.

524
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:09,713
Says that you're bad, only where the
men are concerned but

525
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:12,759
she's good in her heart.
oh, but that ain't it, Sissy.

526
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:14,889
People got a right to talk, and the
kids are bound to hear,

527
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:17,099
and it ain't right for them.
And you can get in trouble.

528
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:18,845
You ain't real sure what happened.

529
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:20,513
And there's laws about things like
that...

530
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:21,848
Katie, so help me, this time iùs
for keeps.

531
00:29:22,103 --> 00:29:23,810
l ain't even gonna look at another
guy.

532
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,469
And as for the last one, he can't be
alive,

533
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,137
or l would have heard from him.
l've been pretty good.

534
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:32,682
Seven years is a long time to wait
around not being married.

535
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:36,936
They said all you had to wait was
seven years. And l waited.

536
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,231
Well, for the life of me, l don't
know what you're trying to talk

537
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:41,393
yourself into, but l got a feeling
it ain't right.

538
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:44,321
All l know, is it can't be wrong or
l wouldn't feel like l do about it.

539
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:48,898
l'm dumb, sure, but l know this much:
lf l feel bad about something,

540
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:50,187
iùs wrong.

541
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:55,605
lf l feel good, iùs right. You
wouldn't get it, Katie.

542
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:57,408
You've got all the breaks
l've never had.

543
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:01,489
You got the kids, you've got a kid
you're clear overboard about.

544
00:30:01,745 --> 00:30:02,574
You're lucky.

545
00:30:02,828 --> 00:30:05,283
Yeah, and where does crazy over
somebody get you?

546
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,825
lt don't put no pennies in the bank.

547
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,321
lt don't buy no clothes for the kids
to go to school in.

548
00:30:11,707 --> 00:30:13,994
Maybe you got it better not sticking
to one guy.

549
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:18,993
l wish sometimes
l wasn't so crazy over him.

550
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:19,702
Hey, Katie.

551
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,785
l won't have the kids taking after
him either.

552
00:30:22,044 --> 00:30:25,292
Him and those dreamy ways of his l
used to think were so fine.

553
00:30:25,545 --> 00:30:27,667
Not if l got to cut it right out of
their hearts!

554
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:29,498
lùs what are you saying?

555
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:33,669
l don't know.

556
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:36,465
Yes you do, you're saying plenty.

557
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,924
Whaùs happened between you and
Johnny?

558
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:43,092
l don't know what l'm saying. l E
don't know whaùs come over me.

559
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:45,301
Well, look, hon, iùs time we found
out.

560
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,095
Sure, we got something to talk about
now.

561
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:47,631
l don't want to talk...

562
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,796
Ah-ah! You're the kid sister, you
listen now.

563
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,723
You was awful crazy about Johnny.

564
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:54,881
Don't tell me, l seen ya.

565
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:56,931
lt was like every woman wants to be
with a guy.

566
00:30:57,183 --> 00:31:01,309
All right. Maybe Johnny didn't turn
out just like you figured.

567
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,643
Sure, he drinks and all, and you're
the one who's had to make most of

568
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:07,514
the living but, but, everybody's got
something.

569
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,556
And you wasn't crazy about Johnny
because he was going be a banker,

570
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:12,141
it was on account of...

571
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:17,690
Well, on account of how he laughed
and how you felt walking down

572
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:18,771
the street holding on to him and
having other women look at you.

573
00:31:19,026 --> 00:31:24,396
Aced the way he could, the way he
could talk about things.

574
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:28,066
And the way he has of saying hello
to everybody, like...

575
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:30,526
like he was giving
away something.

576
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,861
Thaùs what you was crazy about,
and that ain't changed!

577
00:31:35,031 --> 00:31:36,441
l don't know.

578
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:41,026
Them things couldn't change in
Johnny, even if he tried.

579
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:45,900
He's just different kinda, he always
was.

580
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:49,071
But he ain't changed.

581
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:54,905
lf there's been any changing hon,
maybe iùs you.

582
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,245
You still got all he was crazy over,
ain't you?

583
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,996
Yeah.

584
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:02,661
Then thank your lucky stars for what
you got, Katie Nlolan,

585
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:04,542
and take the rest along with it.

586
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:06,203
And you got a lot, you can take it
from me.

587
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:07,374
And don't think you haven't.

588
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:14,170
Well, l mighta known, starting out
to take you apart,

589
00:32:14,423 --> 00:32:17,173
l'd wind up with
you making me over.

590
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:23,207
Nice going.
Don't stir yourself, pal. Thank you.

591
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:25,213
Gotta go inside, Alfred.

592
00:32:25,469 --> 00:32:26,464
How'd you come out, Aunt Sis?

593
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:29,635
No decision, it was a draw. Your
mom's bark is worse than her bite.

594
00:32:30,471 --> 00:32:32,178
Look, tell me something.

595
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,341
When Papa's home, l bet, l bet him
and Mama laugh a plenty, don't they?

596
00:32:36,598 --> 00:32:38,506
You know, like they always did?

597
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:41,220
Sure. Pop can snake anybody laugh
when he wants to.

598
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:43,052
Except when he's drunk.

599
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,135
Sick, Neeley! Mama said to call it.

600
00:32:45,394 --> 00:32:46,424
Okay, sick then.

601
00:32:46,686 --> 00:32:48,808
Look, hon, l'll tell you what you
can do for me.

602
00:32:49,062 --> 00:32:53,436
Do all the laughing you can.
You know, keeps everybody healthy.

603
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:54,185
Okay.

604
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:56,311
Laughter is the singing of the
angels.

605
00:32:56,564 --> 00:33:01,687
You're a funny kid. Head full of all
them things. Kinda like your pop.

606
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:03,519
She tells lies like Pop too.

607
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:04,640
He does not tell lies!

608
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,643
Well, l don't know what you call
them.

609
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,810
Time out! Had enough battling to
last me for today.

610
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:09,934
Where'd you get the skates?

611
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:12,482
Oh, they aren't ours. Papa said he'd
get us some though.

612
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:15,062
Oh, he didn't mean it, he just said
that.

613
00:33:15,322 --> 00:33:17,029
He did too mean it, Neeley, Nolan,
and

614
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:20,861
Easy now! Kinda like your pop,
don't you hon?

615
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:23,783
He does mean it, doesn't he, Aunt
Sissy:?

616
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:26,358
Sure he means it. He means it,
every word.

617
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:31,201
But, well you know,
sometimes things happen.

618
00:33:31,454 --> 00:33:35,531
But it kinda ain't his fault.
l tell you what.

619
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:38,159
Leùs make up like Johnny gave you
them skates like he said.

620
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:40,323
And they're yours.
Ain't gonna hurt nobody.

621
00:33:40,582 --> 00:33:41,281
Oh, Aunt Sissy

622
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,781
No sense in those things standing
around, nobody using them. Come on...

623
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:50,376
Here we go. Easy now.
ls that fun?

624
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:52,666
Can l put them on next, Aunt Sissy?

625
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,417
Sure you can.

626
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,627
Mom! Mom! Mom! You come back here!

627
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,286
You bring back my daughter's skates!

628
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:00,623
You was the one that put them kids
up to it!

629
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:02,589
Easy now, nobody's hurt, we only
borrowed them.

630
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,250
She's not going off with them, Effie.

631
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:06,298
Don't you dare take up with that
woman, like that you...

632
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:08,542
You poor little guy, do you have to
put up with that all the time?

633
00:34:08,802 --> 00:34:12,584
Hey, Officer! Come on over here,
now this woman here she tried to...

634
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:14,173
Easy, easy... Take it easy.

635
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,424
Oh, l'm sure glad you came along,
handsome,

636
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,257
you look like you could
whip a bunch of women into line.

637
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,919
Well, thaùs fine, but now suppose
somebody tells me

638
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:21,556
what all the excitemenùs about.

639
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:23,928
Look, she tried to steal my little
girl's skates.

640
00:34:24,183 --> 00:34:25,012
She tried to grab her...

641
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:26,808
We only borrowed them for just a
minute, honest.

642
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:27,426
Thaùs right.

643
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:29,557
There wasn't nobody using them and a
little fun and frolic

644
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,387
on a Saturday never hurt nobody.

645
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:33,470
Bet you know all about that don't
you?

646
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:36,478
lf you think you're gonna get out of
it, making eyes at the law...

647
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:38,187
l don't know what the worlÔs coming
to!

648
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:43,606
Get back a little bit, buddy, huh?

649
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:44,972
This lady is my sister, she didn't
mean any harm.

650
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,643
l'm quite sure she didn't.

651
00:34:50,401 --> 00:34:53,187
Ah, well... As far as l can see
there's been no harm done.

652
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:55,187
Now, just break it up, run along, go
to your homes.

653
00:34:55,445 --> 00:35:00,188
Go on, you too. Go on, buddy, run
along.

654
00:35:02,824 --> 00:35:05,443
Ah, now suppose l see you women to
your home.

655
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:07,074
Thanks, handsome.

656
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:17,862
My sister's always trying to be
funny, officer.

657
00:35:18,122 --> 00:35:19,662
She don't mean nothing by it.

658
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,402
l'd like you to know, this is the
first time that of my of my family

659
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:25,242
ever got in trouble in the street.

660
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,116
...And l'll see to it that it don't
happen again.

661
00:35:32,419 --> 00:35:34,623
l guess l know a lady when
l see one ma'am.

662
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:36,703
l'm glad l've been of service to you,
ma'am.

663
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:39,913
He sure take a shine to you, Katie.

664
00:35:41,047 --> 00:35:43,418
Go on, who'd look at me.

665
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:44,918
He would.

666
00:35:45,174 --> 00:35:47,877
Funny, sometimes you kinda forget
you are a woman.

667
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:49,883
He wasn't going to arrest us, Mama.

668
00:35:50,134 --> 00:35:52,421
Aunt Sissy talked him out of it, and
we got to skate on them anyway,

669
00:35:52,677 --> 00:35:53,839
didn't we, Aunt Sissy?

670
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:58,385
You go inside and tell Sheila and
her Mama you're sorry.

671
00:35:58,638 --> 00:35:59,882
Do l have to, Mama?

672
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:07,095
l don't like to say to you what l'm
going to, Sissy.

673
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:09,257
Oh, golly, are we going to start
that again?

674
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:11,555
You're the only sister l got.

675
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:15,761
l don't care what people say about
you for myself.

676
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,177
But l got the kids to think about,
and if l don't think about them,

677
00:36:18,438 --> 00:36:20,724
nobody will. You're...

678
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:24,308
Well, you're bad for them,
Sissy.

679
00:36:25,398 --> 00:36:26,856
What are you trying to say, kid?

680
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:30,731
l don't want you to come around here
no more.

681
00:36:30,984 --> 00:36:32,098
My minÔs made up so don't try to
change

682
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,232
it with any of that
soft talk of yours.

683
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,815
Well, l won't Kate,
not if you mean it.

684
00:36:40,404 --> 00:36:45,988
But leùs keep on talking about you.
Sofùs one thing, but harÔs another.

685
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,734
All right, it ain't nice to be hard.

686
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,823
But my kids is gonna be somebody if

687
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,113
l gotta turn into granite
rock to make 'em.

688
00:36:55,785 --> 00:37:02,283
Oh, l wish you hadn't said that, kid.
...Bye, Katie.

689
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:13,366
and Nahal lived nine and twenty
years and begat Terra, and Nahal

690
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:17,289
lived after he begat Terra a hundred
and nineteen years"

691
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:19,037
Boy, thaùs older than Grandma,
ain't it?

692
00:37:19,294 --> 00:37:22,377
"and begat sons and daughters."
Okay, thaùs the end of the page.

693
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,378
Troylis: And dreaming night will
hide our dreams no longer.

694
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:29,381
l would not from thee.
Cressida; Night hath been too brief.

695
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:32,798
Troylis: be shrew the witch with
venomous..."

696
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,543
Oh, that ain't even English!

697
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,923
lt is too. Shakespeare wrote the
best English of anybody.

698
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:39,417
All right, you tell me what it means,
you're so smart.

699
00:37:39,678 --> 00:37:42,346
l didn't say l know what it means. l
said l liked it.

700
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:43,426
Thaùll do.

701
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,837
okay, but l bet you don't know what
it means either.

702
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,089
Maybe not, but l do know iùs good
for you.

703
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:50,304
"...be shrew the witch with venomous
white..."

704
00:37:50,557 --> 00:37:51,932
She don't know what it means, Mom
don't know what it means,

705
00:37:52,183 --> 00:37:55,467
Grandma can't even read, and gosh
knows, l don't know what it...

706
00:37:55,726 --> 00:37:56,805
Mama, l can't read if he...

707
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,435
Just wasting time every night
reading stuff

708
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:00,476
nobody knows what iùs all about.

709
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:01,973
Now listen.

710
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:05,761
Your Aunt Sissy brought that bible
all the way from Sheepshead Bay.

711
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:09,140
And your Papa blew in all his tips
one time on that Shakespeare,

712
00:38:09,398 --> 00:38:12,184
cause Grandma said they was the
greatest books and you should read

713
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:15,227
from them every night. So,
you ain't gonna waste 'em.

714
00:38:15,484 --> 00:38:18,851
l don't know, sometimes it does seem
kind of foolish.

715
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:21,396
But it might get you somewhere.

716
00:38:21,653 --> 00:38:23,940
Might even get you a job someday.
Who can tell?

717
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:27,645
This reading will not stop.
l say this thing.

718
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:33,855
To this new land, your grandfather
and l came, very long ago now.

719
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:38,064
Because we heard that here is
something very good.

720
00:38:38,326 --> 00:38:42,950
Hard we worked. Very hard.
But we could not find this thing.

721
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:48,362
For a long time, l do not understand.
And then l know.

722
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:51,989
When l am old, l know.

723
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:57,536
ln that old country, a child can
rise no higher

724
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,583
than his father's state.

725
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:04,459
But here, in this place, each one is
free to go

726
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:08,293
as far as he's good to
make of himself.

727
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:13,420
This way, the child can be better
than their parent

728
00:39:13,674 --> 00:39:17,670
and this is the true way
that things grow better.

729
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:22,217
And this has to do something with
the learning,

730
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:29,464
which is here free to all people.
l who am old, missed these things.

731
00:39:29,722 --> 00:39:31,679
My children missed these things.

732
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:36,131
But my children's children shall not
miss it.

733
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:38,596
This reading shall not stop.

734
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:50,677
And you, Katie, it is not only for
the job that this is good,

735
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:55,017
but for the true things
inside of us.

736
00:39:55,274 --> 00:39:58,143
You don't think well about this.

737
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:01,021
Nor about what you do with your
sister.

738
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:06,735
You have forgotten to think with
your heart.

739
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:12,191
There is a coldness growing in you,
Katie.

740
00:40:24,411 --> 00:40:27,114
"Be shrew the witch with
venomous white she stays,

741
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,785
as tediously as hell, but flies the
grasps of love..."

742
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,117
"ln Dublin's fair city, where girls
are so pretty,

743
00:40:34,956 --> 00:40:39,248
l first set my eyes
on Miss Molly Malone.

744
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:44,535
And she'll wheel a wheel barrow,
through streets broad and narrow,

745
00:40:44,794 --> 00:40:49,915
crying cockles and mussels alive
alive oh.

746
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:59,123
Alive alive oh, alive, alive oh,
crying cockles and mussels...

747
00:40:59,383 --> 00:41:00,925
lùs all right, Mama, l don't think
he's sick.

748
00:41:01,176 --> 00:41:04,874
Alive alive oh, alive alive oh...

749
00:41:05,135 --> 00:41:05,799
Papa!

750
00:41:06,052 --> 00:41:07,925
well, what do you know, if it ain't
my beauty.

751
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:13,425
Hey, what are you doing up this
time of night?

752
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:16,680
Oh, l just made up my mind to wait
up for you.

753
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,178
l guess l ain't used to the hours
anymore.

754
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:21,390
No, leave it, iùs nice.

755
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:26,215
Go on. Francie, coffee.

756
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:27,675
ls it something to eat, Papa?

757
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:29,845
And what else would be coming from a
grand banquet?

758
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:32,311
l got some fresh rolls,

759
00:41:33,313 --> 00:41:35,885
a whole half a broiled
lobster from the shores of Maryland,

760
00:41:37,732 --> 00:41:41,430
fried oysters, caviar from far off
sunny Russia,

761
00:41:41,692 --> 00:41:44,893
and cheese from the mountain
passages of la belle France.

762
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:50,775
What do you know about the mountain
passages of France?

763
00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:52,570
ls it better coming from there,
Papa?

764
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:53,900
Oh, iùs supposed to be mighty good.

765
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:56,905
but coming home like this,
l know thaùs good.

766
00:41:57,156 --> 00:42:00,606
Well, leùs eat it. No reason we
shouldn't have a party of our own.

767
00:42:05,493 --> 00:42:06,986
l'm hungry.

768
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:09,235
ls that all you got to say to your
Papa?

769
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,317
Hello, Pop.

770
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,405
His stomach's like the lrish Sea. No
bottom to it.

771
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:15,370
Mama, your wedding comb.

772
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,155
Well, ain't this a kind of wedding
party?

773
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:25,331
You bet it is. l wish l coulda
swiped some champagne.

774
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,952
Oh, no l don't. Coffee's better.

775
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:31,833
But, look who's telling me l don't
know about those mountain

776
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:32,868
passages of France.

777
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:33,662
Oh, that.

778
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:35,580
Yeah, that. lmagine you forgetting.

779
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:39,668
Well, l didn't forget, not exactly.
Only it was a long time ago.

780
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:40,457
What do you think of a Mama that
forgets

781
00:42:40,716 --> 00:42:42,174
where she went on her honeymoon?

782
00:42:42,425 --> 00:42:43,587
Did you really go there, Mama?

783
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:45,122
of course not, your Papa's joking.

784
00:42:45,384 --> 00:42:48,051
Sure we did. Or just the same as. We
spent our honeymoon in a school.

785
00:42:48,301 --> 00:42:49,629
lt was as big as a palace.

786
00:42:49,886 --> 00:42:52,043
We just worked there nights, the two
of us, cleaning.

787
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,461
lt was right here in Brooklyn before
you was born.

788
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:55,716
That ain't what you told you then.

789
00:42:55,972 --> 00:42:58,212
You mean to say that when we was
having our supper there alone,

790
00:42:58,473 --> 00:43:01,720
and l used to pull down them maps
and take the teacher's pointer

791
00:43:01,974 --> 00:43:03,799
and pick out the places we'd pretend
we was that night.

792
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:05,220
You mean to say we really wasn't
there?

793
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:08,842
You mean you forgot that sunny
France was where we liked the best?

794
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:13,095
And all the laughing we used to do
there?

795
00:43:13,354 --> 00:43:16,057
You're going to sit right down and
tell me we really wasn't there?

796
00:43:16,314 --> 00:43:18,637
Well, l guess we was kind of at that.

797
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:19,810
And you're going to tell me l don't
know about them

798
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,723
mountain passages of France.

799
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:23,440
Katie Nolan, l'm ashamed of you.

800
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:25,398
Wasn't there nobody in the school
but you, Papa?

801
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,476
No, sir, we had the whole place to
ourselves...

802
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:30,434
or he'll have you believing
you was in France, too.

803
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:32,270
No, Papa, talk some more.

804
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,021
Whaùs this here stuff?

805
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,649
Caviar. That comes all the way from
Russia. Them's fish eggs.

806
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:37,402
Fish eggs!

807
00:43:37,655 --> 00:43:38,817
Yeah.

808
00:43:39,072 --> 00:43:40,731
l never could get it why they like
it myself,

809
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,613
except that iùs hard to get
and costs a lot.

810
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:43,896
And that makes it good, Papa?

811
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:46,315
What about the Russians? lt ain't
hard for them to get.

812
00:43:46,575 --> 00:43:47,488
Do they like it?

813
00:43:47,742 --> 00:43:51,441
Well, can you tie that? Now, ain't
we got the smartest kids?

814
00:43:51,702 --> 00:43:53,445
Papa, talk some more.

815
00:43:53,703 --> 00:43:56,109
Tell us all about the party, and
don't leave out anything.

816
00:43:57,788 --> 00:44:03,620
Oh, that can wait. Here... how's
that?

817
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:05,948
Three dollars. Thera's good wages.

818
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:07,073
And good tips, too.

819
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:10,167
Papa, start. Was there music, and
did they dance?

820
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,285
Aw, your mother's got no time for
all that.

821
00:44:14,462 --> 00:44:19,085
You could tell me. You used to.

822
00:44:19,338 --> 00:44:24,709
Well, it was kind of nice. Klompers,
their best room.

823
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:27,041
And all fixed up with white flowers.

824
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,920
There was flowers on the table,
flowers on the chandelier,

825
00:44:30,176 --> 00:44:31,254
and even on the floor.

826
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:33,086
And here was a great big horseshoe
table,

827
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:34,671
with lots of people all around.

828
00:44:34,928 --> 00:44:36,754
And right in front, a great big
wedding cake,

829
00:44:37,012 --> 00:44:38,754
it must have been three feet tall.

830
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:40,755
Why didn't you bring home some of
that?

831
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:41,843
Was the bride pretty?

832
00:44:42,098 --> 00:44:44,338
Well, she was maybe not so young,
but the...

833
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:50,220
Oh, sure, she was beautiful, in a
blue dress and all and she had

834
00:44:50,476 --> 00:44:54,258
diamonds on her fingers and in her
ears, and she glittered sort of.

835
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:58,052
And when she walked, her dress
swished, kind of.

836
00:44:58,313 --> 00:45:00,637
And the champagne just flowed like
water.

837
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:03,433
The smell of it got all mixed up
with the flowers.

838
00:45:03,689 --> 00:45:05,147
And the powder the ladies wore.

839
00:45:05,398 --> 00:45:07,437
And it made a wonderful new perfume
that oh,

840
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:09,729
made you feel good just
to smell it.

841
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:10,765
Did you sing for 'em Papa?

842
00:45:11,026 --> 00:45:11,974
Oh, l was coming to that.

843
00:45:12,235 --> 00:45:16,728
l got three encores for my "Wild
lrish Rose" and everybody clapped

844
00:45:16,986 --> 00:45:20,104
And then l sang "lrish Eyes are
Smiling" four times.

845
00:45:20,363 --> 00:45:21,642
Oh, it musùve been awful nice.

846
00:45:21,905 --> 00:45:24,608
lt was all right, and when it come
time for them to cut the cake, the

847
00:45:24,865 --> 00:45:27,568
band played "Kiss me Again", she put
her arms around him and boy

848
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:29,282
did he look scared.

849
00:45:29,534 --> 00:45:31,156
What was he scared of, Papa?

850
00:45:31,408 --> 00:45:32,072
Huh?

851
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,690
You kids ask too many questions.

852
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:37,031
You heard the story, now go on and
go to bed.

853
00:45:37,286 --> 00:45:38,484
lt must be three o'clock.

854
00:45:38,745 --> 00:45:40,653
l got a belly ache.

855
00:45:40,913 --> 00:45:41,778
Well, lay on your right side.

856
00:45:42,038 --> 00:45:43,580
Good night, Mom.

857
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:46,035
Good night, Neeley.
Good night, Francie.

858
00:45:47,248 --> 00:45:50,117
Francie's kind of mad at me,
because, well,

859
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,951
Sissy made a scene
on the street today,

860
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:54,533
and l asked her to stay a...
way.

861
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,669
Papa, wasthere an impresario there?

862
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,495
No, not tonight, Prima Donna. But you
got no call to be mad at your mama.

863
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:06,920
She's always got a good reason for
what she does.

864
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,837
Good night, Mama.

865
00:46:19,136 --> 00:46:21,009
Oh, good night, Francie.

866
00:46:40,854 --> 00:46:43,888
Johnny, tell me what else happened
at the party?

867
00:46:44,147 --> 00:46:51,058
Well, it was nice, just like l told
you. Awful nice.

868
00:46:51,316 --> 00:46:58,727
Johnny, do you think, l mean,
have l changed a lot?

869
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:04,946
Changed? Why she couldn't hold a
candle to you. She ain't so hot.

870
00:47:05,196 --> 00:47:07,105
l just said that for the kids. No
sir.

871
00:47:07,364 --> 00:47:11,525
No, thaùs not what r mean. What l
mean is, am l getting hard, you know.

872
00:47:11,783 --> 00:47:16,406
Oh, now where did you grab onto an
idea like that? Hard?

873
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:17,323
l don't know!

874
00:47:17,576 --> 00:47:20,362
l don't want to be, but well,
there's the kids and all,

875
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:23,370
and l want to do whaùs right for
them and may be some times l am

876
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:24,534
Now, will you stop talking like that.

877
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:26,412
Now, you're prettier than you ever
was.

878
00:47:26,664 --> 00:47:29,035
l almost told that to the whole
bunch down at the party tonight.

879
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,115
l almost said, you ought to see my
bride

880
00:47:31,373 --> 00:47:32,701
thaùs waiting home
for me at tonight.

881
00:47:32,957 --> 00:47:37,747
And you was waiting, Katie.
That was nice, awful nice.

882
00:47:38,793 --> 00:47:40,619
lt was just like it used to be.

883
00:47:43,671 --> 00:47:46,420
You told about the party awful nice
tonight, Johnny.

884
00:47:48,255 --> 00:47:50,626
l should have. Waited up more
often, l guess.

885
00:47:52,174 --> 00:47:56,300
Aw, it ain't your fault, working
hard like you do.

886
00:47:57,885 --> 00:47:58,999
You know something?

887
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,469
l wish l coulÔve got you the rest
of that set when when we was married.

888
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,388
The guy said it came all the way
from Spain.

889
00:48:06,638 --> 00:48:08,012
What else was in that set, Johnny?

890
00:48:08,264 --> 00:48:10,136
You ain't told me in an awful long
time.

891
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,966
Two little side combs and a locket
on a chain.

892
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,474
And a bracelet you said?

893
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,637
Oh, there's no use talking.

894
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:18,428
Some day l'm going to look that guy
up and get you the rest of that set.

895
00:48:18,684 --> 00:48:20,059
Oh, thaùs nice Johnny, but l don't
need...

896
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:21,424
No, there's no buts about it,
l mean it.

897
00:48:22,394 --> 00:48:24,101
Things are gonna be different around
here.

898
00:48:24,812 --> 00:48:27,480
You ain't gonna be working hard like
you -like you are now.

899
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:28,761
l don't mind the work, Johnny.

900
00:48:29,022 --> 00:48:31,772
No, air. l ain't gonna stand for it.
Look at then pretty hands.

901
00:48:32,023 --> 00:48:34,347
They ain't got no business being in
the water all the time.

902
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:36,729
l'm gonna change a lot of things
around here.

903
00:48:36,983 --> 00:48:38,607
l'm gonna cut out the drinking too.

904
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:41,064
And just to prove it to you,
here's my tip money.

905
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:43,773
No, keep your tips, Johnny. Take all
a man's money, it ain't right.

906
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:45,734
And l'm gonna keep on 'em down at
the union headquarters

907
00:48:45,987 --> 00:48:46,899
and make 'em get me some jobs.

908
00:48:47,154 --> 00:48:49,608
Yes, six, tonighùs the beginning of
something new.

909
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:52,151
Oh, you believe me, don't you,
Katie?

910
00:48:52,406 --> 00:48:54,481
Yeah, Johnny, yeah, sure l do.

911
00:48:54,741 --> 00:48:57,574
And l'll be singing all over
Brooklyn, and maybe Manhattan too.

912
00:48:57,825 --> 00:48:59,946
Have you heard Johnny Nolan sing,
they'll say.

913
00:49:00,201 --> 00:49:02,275
And then maybe some day, maybe...

914
00:49:02,535 --> 00:49:05,285
Oh, Johnny, stop it! Stop it! Stop
talking!...

915
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:20,623
You ain't got a chance.
Who are we trying to kid.

916
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,995
Yeah, sure, you're right.
Who am l trying to kid.

917
00:49:32,255 --> 00:49:33,453
l didn't want to hurt you, Johnny.

918
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:35,622
But, iùs the truth and l can't
change it.

919
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:40,924
Yeah. And l could tell you something
else.

920
00:49:42,802 --> 00:49:45,207
All that baloney about them encores
tonight.

921
00:49:46,428 --> 00:49:48,917
lùs just because they was a little
drunk and feeling good.

922
00:49:49,179 --> 00:49:50,720
l wasn't so much.

923
00:49:53,097 --> 00:49:55,136
Thaùs right, l'll never be able to
change it.

924
00:49:56,516 --> 00:50:01,221
Sure you're right,
who am l trying to kid?

925
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,724
Neeley Nolan, you stop that!

926
00:50:23,985 --> 00:50:25,775
Oh, l don't want to wear no old tie!

927
00:50:26,027 --> 00:50:26,774
Mama said.

928
00:50:37,073 --> 00:50:39,610
All right, now, break it up! Break
it up! Run along!

929
00:50:40,908 --> 00:50:42,817
Papa! Leùs hurry, Papa.

930
00:50:43,493 --> 00:50:44,867
All right now, lad, where do you
live?

931
00:50:45,118 --> 00:50:47,026
l'll take him home, he's my father.

932
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:48,862
Hey, wait, wait a minute, honey.

933
00:50:49,661 --> 00:50:52,151
l expect you'd better be running
along to school, hadn't you?

934
00:50:52,413 --> 00:50:53,657
l'll look after him for you.

935
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:57,237
Now, don't you worry. He ain't in
any trouble.

936
00:50:57,498 --> 00:51:01,078
l'll take good care of him. Here, is
this the house?

937
00:51:05,084 --> 00:51:09,162
No, next one. Second floor back.

938
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:14,044
And if you talk to him, he's always
all right.

939
00:51:14,296 --> 00:51:16,833
Sure, sure, l know, now don't you
fret. You just run along. Huh?

940
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:20,716
All right, lad, come on.
We'll make it.

941
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:35,136
Alive alive oh, alive alive oh...

942
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:52,176
Oh, l didn't expect to find you here,
ma'am. ls there anything l can do?

943
00:51:52,437 --> 00:51:54,310
He's my husband,
l can take care of him.

944
00:51:55,188 --> 00:51:57,938
lùs all right, Johnny, l'll get you
a nice cup of coffee.

945
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:02,480
A nice cup of coffee... a nice cup of
coffee.

946
00:52:04,066 --> 00:52:05,809
Oh, l just wanted to say,

947
00:52:06,067 --> 00:52:07,858
ma'am that the gentleman
wasn't making no trouble.

948
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,520
He just needed a little help.

949
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:10,891
Here, drink it Johnny.

950
00:52:11,153 --> 00:52:12,895
lsn't there anything that l can do?

951
00:52:14,278 --> 00:52:16,400
lf you wasn't you on the beat,
Mr. McShane,

952
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:18,611
you'd know that Johnny
never makes any trouble.

953
00:52:18,864 --> 00:52:22,148
And you'd know that the whole Nolan
family doesn't need anybody's help.

954
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:26,023
l'd thank you, Mr. McShane,
if you'd mind your own business.

955
00:52:26,284 --> 00:52:28,276
Oh, sure, Mrs. Nolan.

956
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:38,329
Beauty is truth through beauty that
is all ye know on earth and all

957
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,038
ye need to know.

958
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,118
Now, class,

959
00:52:42,374 --> 00:52:47,281
Beauty is truth through beauty that
is all

960
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:52,083
ye know on Earth and all
ye need to know.

961
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,879
Now who knows the name of the meter?
...Frances Nolan?

962
00:52:56,129 --> 00:52:57,623
Yes, but...

963
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,084
You can't know but...

964
00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:04,797
l only meant to say, l was thinking
about the words, what they mean,

965
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:06,128
and l wondered...

966
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,169
You don't have to know the words,
Frances, just the meter.

967
00:53:09,426 --> 00:53:13,588
But if beauty is truth and thaùs
all ye need, l mean, all you need to

968
00:53:13,844 --> 00:53:16,168
know, then that means that iùs the
most important thing.

969
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:23,756
And if a man, i mean if somebody,
spent all his time trying to be that.

970
00:53:25,224 --> 00:53:28,756
well iùs hard to put...
but no matter what else he did, then.

971
00:53:30,017 --> 00:53:31,973
Then what, Frances?

972
00:53:32,227 --> 00:53:35,475
Then it would be all right.
Wouldn't it?

973
00:53:35,728 --> 00:53:39,510
l'm afraid l don't understand, a
thing you're saying, Frances.

974
00:53:39,772 --> 00:53:41,514
And we're late now with our
arithmetic.

975
00:53:41,773 --> 00:53:43,396
Class will get their arithmetic...

976
00:53:46,024 --> 00:53:49,308
Pop, why don't the Katz and Jamma
kids talk plain English?

977
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:52,602
lùs supposed to make it funny.
l guess.

978
00:53:53,319 --> 00:53:55,441
Francie, you've been staring out
that window over half an hour,

979
00:53:55,695 --> 00:53:57,521
can't you make up your mind
to do something?

980
00:53:57,779 --> 00:53:58,976
What shall l do?

981
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:01,110
Well, you used to like to do your
homework Sundays.

982
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:05,231
Oh, l don't know. l don't like
school as much as l used to.

983
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,865
Now you're getting some sense.

984
00:54:07,116 --> 00:54:09,191
School is the same this year as it
was last.

985
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:14,199
Mama, you know that big market on
Clancy Street, down the hill?

986
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:15,910
You can't play there, if thaùs what
you mean,

987
00:54:16,161 --> 00:54:17,619
that neighborhooÔs expensive.

988
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:21,866
Well, l meant, l mean, well the
other day l passed that

989
00:54:22,122 --> 00:54:23,070
way on my way home.

990
00:54:23,331 --> 00:54:25,536
And well, Mom, you know whaùs just
a couple blocks

991
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:26,821
away from that market?

992
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:28,245
Another market, l guess,

993
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:30,574
and am l supposed to guess whaùs
two blocks away from there?

994
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,327
Francie why don't you say what you
mean.

995
00:54:33,626 --> 00:54:35,203
l didn't mean anything l guess.

996
00:54:37,045 --> 00:54:40,625
Neeley, sometimes l think you make
these holes on purpose.

997
00:54:41,672 --> 00:54:42,585
Papa?

998
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:43,786
Yes, baby?

999
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,418
You know what l read in a magazine
once?

1000
00:54:46,673 --> 00:54:48,380
What was it, Francie.

1001
00:54:48,632 --> 00:54:51,169
Well, it said that walking was a
good thing.

1002
00:54:51,425 --> 00:54:54,425
lt said people would look and feel a
lot better if they did more of it.

1003
00:54:54,677 --> 00:54:57,593
Walking put rose petals in your
cheeks, it said.

1004
00:54:57,845 --> 00:55:00,001
Then l ought to be a raving beauty
with all them stairs.

1005
00:55:00,262 --> 00:55:04,506
That isn't what it meant. lt meant,
well, like on a Sunday.

1006
00:55:04,764 --> 00:55:07,882
People would feel a lot better if
they got out and took a walk or

1007
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,717
something, instead of just sitting
around.

1008
00:55:09,975 --> 00:55:12,643
Francie, l want you to stop talking
around about things like that.

1009
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:16,010
lf you got something to say, just
say it right out. Plain.

1010
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:23,969
l wasn't going to say anything.
l was just talking about walking.

1011
00:55:26,273 --> 00:55:29,805
Well, there's been so much talking
about walking, l think l'll take one.

1012
00:55:32,108 --> 00:55:34,064
You want to go along, Prima Donna?

1013
00:55:34,317 --> 00:55:37,482
Oh, yes, Papa. Sure, Papa.

1014
00:55:41,696 --> 00:55:44,445
Must be pretty special this place
you walk to thaùs two blocks away

1015
00:55:44,696 --> 00:55:46,071
from the market.

1016
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:47,602
This way, Papa.

1017
00:55:52,992 --> 00:55:53,857
ls this it?

1018
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,362
Yes, Papa.

1019
00:55:57,494 --> 00:56:01,784
The school? l don't understand.

1020
00:56:02,037 --> 00:56:05,451
lt must be just as nice inside,
don't you think?

1021
00:56:05,705 --> 00:56:06,985
The teachers and all and...

1022
00:56:07,247 --> 00:56:08,575
Well, what are you driving at, baby?

1023
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:15,833
Bend down, Papa. l wish l could go
tot that school, Papa.

1024
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:25,705
Oh, well, l don't know, baby. lùd
be awful nice, but they got rules.

1025
00:56:25,964 --> 00:56:27,623
You gotta go to the school where you
live.

1026
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:32,458
Oh, l know, l didn't really.

1027
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:38,420
Oh, now, wait a minute. Maybe
there's a way.

1028
00:56:38,677 --> 00:56:40,051
lùs a free country, ain't it?

1029
00:56:44,303 --> 00:56:50,090
School days, school days Hey, maybe
we could move near here.

1030
00:56:50,348 --> 00:56:52,007
Well, now, whoa now, whoa.

1031
00:56:52,266 --> 00:56:55,633
Sometime soon, as soon as our ship
comes in, Prima Donna, you'll see.

1032
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:59,140
Oh, only by that time l'll

1033
00:57:00,727 --> 00:57:03,098
Oh, you want to go there awful bad
don't you baby?

1034
00:57:04,645 --> 00:57:05,392
Then we're going to find a way!

1035
00:57:05,646 --> 00:57:06,475
Honest?

1036
00:57:08,189 --> 00:57:11,472
Well, now, l gotta turn this over a
little.

1037
00:57:12,441 --> 00:57:14,929
Leùs do some more walking, maybe
iùs good for thinking too.

1038
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:21,901
school days, school days... Hey,
that ain't a bad little house.

1039
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:24,903
How'd you like to live there?
lùs got a nice little porch.

1040
00:57:25,154 --> 00:57:26,980
l don't like yellow houses.

1041
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:28,814
Well, with another coat of paint.

1042
00:57:32,406 --> 00:57:34,445
0h, Papa. Thaùs it.

1043
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,774
Yes, sir. Thaùs it.

1044
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:39,029
lf we only could.

1045
00:57:39,743 --> 00:57:40,987
Well, why can't we?

1046
00:57:41,244 --> 00:57:43,033
Our luck's bound to change, and the
first thing we'll do is buy this

1047
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:44,945
little house when...

1048
00:57:45,203 --> 00:57:47,111
Some day.

1049
00:57:49,205 --> 00:57:55,370
Look, as long as we're gonna buy
that house some day, ah,

1050
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:58,576
why don't we maybe borrow it for now,
like ah...

1051
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:01,702
We'll make out iùs ours, then your
address would be...

1052
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,541
98 Hibbert Avenue. Starting right
now.

1053
00:58:05,795 --> 00:58:08,036
Then you see? They gotta transfer
you from your old school.

1054
00:58:08,296 --> 00:58:09,291
How do you mean, Papa?

1055
00:58:09,547 --> 00:58:10,211
Yes, sir, thaùs it.

1056
00:58:10,464 --> 00:58:13,664
We can say you came here to live
with your aunt, your rich old aunt.

1057
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:16,756
She's lonesome and she's gonna leave
you all her money.

1058
00:58:17,008 --> 00:58:18,418
Oh, Papa, could we really?

1059
00:58:18,675 --> 00:58:20,133
Sure we could. lùs nobody's
business.

1060
00:58:20,384 --> 00:58:24,083
Mmm... Sometimes l forget to water
the geraniums, and, ahhhh...

1061
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:25,589
you ought to hear Auntie scold me.

1062
00:58:25,845 --> 00:58:27,752
Ah, but you gotta put up with all
her crochets,

1063
00:58:28,012 --> 00:58:29,090
after all, you're her heir.

1064
00:58:29,346 --> 00:58:31,835
That little room up there, that
could be mine, couldn't it?

1065
00:58:37,725 --> 00:58:42,217
Or, ah, look Prima Donna, after all,
you know,

1066
00:58:42,476 --> 00:58:45,594
this ain't exactly according
to the rules.

1067
00:58:45,852 --> 00:58:47,014
You mean, iùs wrong?

1068
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,308
No, sir, not by a jug full it ain't
wrong.

1069
00:58:49,562 --> 00:58:51,969
Look, the house is here, we're here
and the school's here.

1070
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,021
Now, we wasn't all thrown together
for no reason but,

1071
00:58:56,524 --> 00:58:58,016
we gotta keep it kind of a secret.

1072
00:58:58,274 --> 00:59:01,890
You know, you can't tell nobody, and
you gotta be extra good to make up

1073
00:59:02,151 --> 00:59:03,099
for it.

1074
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,521
Oh, l will. Look, there goes Auntie
now, l think.

1075
00:59:10,029 --> 00:59:11,820
Looks like you got an uncle too.

1076
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,315
Now, l'm gonna show you a way to
your new school through a beautiful

1077
00:59:17,574 --> 00:59:19,150
little park, and l know right where
it is.

1078
00:59:19,408 --> 00:59:21,695
And you can see the seasons change
when you go.

1079
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:29,278
Bend down, Papa. My cup runneth over.

1080
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:38,123
lùs dishonest, thaùs what it is.

1081
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,449
You're setting the child an awful
bad example.

1082
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,249
Papa said if it doesn't hurt anybody,

1083
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,744
and if iùs not dishonest
in your heart...

1084
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:45,245
You two and your fancy words.

1085
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:47,327
How do you spell transfer, Francie?

1086
00:59:47,586 --> 00:59:53,372
T-R-A-N-S-F-E-R.

1087
00:59:54,172 --> 00:59:56,744
l'd rather be shot than do this
arithmetic.

1088
00:59:57,006 --> 00:59:57,752
lùll come to you, Sonny.

1089
00:59:58,006 --> 01:00:00,045
And another thing, we kept Francie
out of here so she and Neeley could

1090
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:02,586
be in the same class and you could
look after him.

1091
01:00:02,842 --> 01:00:04,798
And here, just the year when they're
getting ready to graduate,

1092
01:00:05,051 --> 01:00:05,964
you go and...

1093
01:00:06,218 --> 01:00:08,174
l tell you, iùs against the law and
you're making her live a lie and

1094
01:00:08,428 --> 01:00:09,672
l won't have you doing it.

1095
01:00:11,638 --> 01:00:13,260
l'm going to do this for her, Katie.

1096
01:00:13,512 --> 01:00:16,761
Maybe iùs my fault, or not, but
there ain't much l can give her.

1097
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,722
Well, iùll make an awful long walk
for your mornings.

1098
01:00:27,977 --> 01:00:29,387
l don't mind getting up early.

1099
01:00:29,644 --> 01:00:31,600
And iùll be much harder on your
shoes and you won't have dresses '

1100
01:00:31,853 --> 01:00:33,133
like the other children.

1101
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,518
l promise to wash down my dress
every single night.

1102
01:00:35,772 --> 01:00:37,396
How do you spell "appreciate".
Francie?

1103
01:00:37,648 --> 01:00:38,762
A-P-P...

1104
01:00:39,023 --> 01:00:39,723
Wait a minute.

1105
01:00:41,732 --> 01:00:46,190
R-E-C-l-A-T-E.

1106
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,397
Well, if the principal swallows that
story, and l don't think he will,

1107
01:00:49,652 --> 01:00:52,735
l'll see what l can do about making
over that checked dress

1108
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:53,900
of mine for you.

1109
01:01:05,659 --> 01:01:08,279
Why not, my school's over-crowded as
it is.

1110
01:01:11,078 --> 01:01:12,820
This is Frances Nolan, class.

1111
01:01:13,078 --> 01:01:15,615
l'm sure you'll all make her
welcome to our school.

1112
01:01:15,871 --> 01:01:17,909
Now, that will be your desk, Frances.

1113
01:01:38,506 --> 01:01:40,960
Run along, Sonny. l ain't gonna
spill a penny.

1114
01:01:57,429 --> 01:01:58,709
Well, l guess we got everything.

1115
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:05,890
Neeley, our new fire escape leads
clear up onto the roof.

1116
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:08,845
Whoever lives on the top floor has
got dibs on the roof.

1117
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:11,507
ain't doing so well, eh, Mrs. Nolan?

1118
01:02:11,768 --> 01:02:15,550
Just moving near the sun. As soon as
we heard Mrs. Waters was vacating,

1119
01:02:15,812 --> 01:02:17,270
we made up our minds.

1120
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:19,347
l've been waiting to see you, Mrs.
Nolan.

1121
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:21,846
There's something l've got to ask
you, a favor l...

1122
01:02:22,773 --> 01:02:24,018
l'd better show you.

1123
01:02:24,983 --> 01:02:26,261
Hey, look at this thing.

1124
01:02:26,524 --> 01:02:29,559
Oh boy, we're sure to get out with a
lot less running up and down that.

1125
01:02:29,817 --> 01:02:32,058
We won't let anybody but us up there.

1126
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:43,190
lùs in here. The late Mr. Waters
gave it to me as a wedding present.

1127
01:02:43,448 --> 01:02:47,146
lt won't go down the stairs, and
they want fifteen dollars to move it,

1128
01:02:47,408 --> 01:02:48,356
lowering it out the window.

1129
01:02:48,617 --> 01:02:50,692
Do you mind my leaving it, Mrs.
Nolan?

1130
01:02:50,951 --> 01:02:55,658
lt don't take up much room and some
day when l get the fifteen dollars,

1131
01:02:55,912 --> 01:02:57,108
l'll send back for it.

1132
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:58,744
Why, sure l don't mind, Mrs. Waters.

1133
01:02:58,996 --> 01:03:00,572
Can you play it?

1134
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:03,829
No. Neither one of us could.

1135
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:07,994
lf it ain't too much trouble, you
could dust it off once in a while,

1136
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:11,533
and keep the kitchen door open a
little so it won't get cold or damp.

1137
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:12,823
l sure will.
- Thank you.

1138
01:03:13,084 --> 01:03:15,870
And l hope it won't be long before
you can send back for it.

1139
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,124
Have you got the curtains?

1140
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,707
Yes, they're coming.

1141
01:03:26,882 --> 01:03:30,047
ls it a... ls that a...

1142
01:03:32,634 --> 01:03:35,302
Yeah, we kept a baby in it about 40
years ago.

1143
01:03:36,261 --> 01:03:39,628
Well, l was just wondering, if, if,
if you don't need it, iùd make a

1144
01:03:39,888 --> 01:03:42,886
nice handy little wash basket and
l'd be happy to give you a quarter

1145
01:03:43,138 --> 01:03:43,884
for it.

1146
01:03:44,139 --> 01:03:47,138
Why sure. My Edgar's kids is even
too old.

1147
01:03:55,852 --> 01:03:57,973
Excuse me for asking, Mrs. Nolan,

1148
01:03:58,228 --> 01:04:02,140
but it won't really make a
handy wash basket.

1149
01:04:04,397 --> 01:04:07,562
Please don't say nothing, l ain't
told nobody yet.

1150
01:04:08,441 --> 01:04:13,229
lt ain't always easy when you're
poor. But iùll be a blessing to you.

1151
01:04:14,526 --> 01:04:17,098
Yeah, sure. Sure it will.

1152
01:04:17,361 --> 01:04:18,640
But there must be.

1153
01:04:18,903 --> 01:04:20,100
l tell you there ain't.

1154
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,605
Good bye, Mrs. Nolan. Good bye.

1155
01:04:24,864 --> 01:04:26,902
Good bye, and thank you very much.

1156
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:31,151
Don't forget, we're supposed to give
him a beer, or the price of one.

1157
01:04:31,408 --> 01:04:32,486
Well, l'm done.

1158
01:04:32,742 --> 01:04:34,022
l can't thank you enough, Charlie.

1159
01:04:35,076 --> 01:04:37,780
Always glad to do my customers a
favor, of course.

1160
01:04:38,036 --> 01:04:39,067
Well, we are real grateful.

1161
01:04:40,037 --> 01:04:42,822
lt ain't exactly as if l was in the
regular moving business.

1162
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,829
We'll be taking ice from you, same
as usual, once a week.

1163
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:49,243
Well, good bye.

1164
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:50,957
Good bye, Charlie. And thanks.

1165
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:53,081
He worked awful hard, Mama.

1166
01:04:53,334 --> 01:04:55,455
We moved up to this flat 'to save
money,

1167
01:04:55,709 --> 01:04:57,700
and we're not gonna start by
throwing dimes away.

1168
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,876
No sir, there ain't a bathtub
anywhere. l looked all over.

1169
01:05:04,129 --> 01:05:05,753
There's the tub, young man.

1170
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:07,997
Every Wednesday and Saturday, same
as always.

1171
01:05:08,256 --> 01:05:09,454
lùs Mr. Barker.

1172
01:05:12,507 --> 01:05:17,926
Well, seems like the Nolans have...
have come up in the world.

1173
01:05:18,177 --> 01:05:20,713
Yes, we're so very, very fond of the
sunshine.

1174
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:24,088
"ln Dublin's fair city, where girls
are so pretty,

1175
01:05:24,346 --> 01:05:25,673
Run and catch him before he goes to
the old place.

1176
01:05:25,929 --> 01:05:29,297
Mr. Nolan happened to be working
when we found we could make the move.

1177
01:05:29,556 --> 01:05:33,421
Yeah. Smaller than your old flat,
ain't it?

1178
01:05:33,683 --> 01:05:35,721
l'm sorry l can't ask you to sit,
Mr. Barker,

1179
01:05:35,976 --> 01:05:37,469
l ain't even got the coffee
on yet.

1180
01:05:37,727 --> 01:05:38,971
But l got my insurance money handy.

1181
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:44,893
Suppose you're too busy to listen to
a bit of news, about your sister.

1182
01:05:48,856 --> 01:05:50,018
She, ah, she's gonna have a baby.

1183
01:05:55,441 --> 01:05:58,275
Please tell my sister she shouldn't
make herself such a stranger here.

1184
01:05:58,526 --> 01:06:01,691
l shall be very happy to render your
message. Your receipts, Mrs. Nolan.

1185
01:06:01,944 --> 01:06:03,272
Be sure to, now, Mr. Barker.

1186
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:11,026
Good day to you, Mr. Nolan. Well,
l'm not one to spoil a family party.

1187
01:06:11,281 --> 01:06:12,609
l'll be on my way.

1188
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:19,398
Surprise, Papa. Welcome to your new
home.

1189
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:23,945
Yeah, it is kind of a surprise, all
right.

1190
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:28,110
Did you move up here because it was
cheaper, or because l

1191
01:06:28,371 --> 01:06:30,327
We have to save where we can,
somebody's got to.

1192
01:06:31,498 --> 01:06:32,825
l don't mind the extra stairs.

1193
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:46,830
We can still see the tree.

1194
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:49,659
Pop, top floor tenant, the roof is
theirs.

1195
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:52,921
And l ain't gonna let anybody up
there except Kenny Gaddis, because,

1196
01:06:54,049 --> 01:06:55,292
Hey, does Pop know?

1197
01:06:55,549 --> 01:06:57,457
Flossie Gaddis died last night.

1198
01:06:57,716 --> 01:07:01,048
Oh, the poor baby.

1199
01:07:01,301 --> 01:07:03,969
lt was nice that her Mama got her
all those pretty dresses.

1200
01:07:04,219 --> 01:07:07,053
Only now the poor thing will have to
lie in Potter's Field.

1201
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:09,845
But, she did have the dresses.

1202
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:14,716
You better show your Papa the piano.

1203
01:07:16,557 --> 01:07:19,391
Yeah, you better show me the piano,
Prima Donna.

1204
01:07:21,643 --> 01:07:23,185
The lady that was here left it.

1205
01:07:32,272 --> 01:07:36,848
lùs got a nice tone.
lùs all right.

1206
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:47,143
Hey, now that we got it, maybe you
can take some lessons. Naa...

1207
01:07:54,656 --> 01:08:03,773
Maxwelton Braes are bonny
where early forms the dew.

1208
01:08:05,536 --> 01:08:16,075
And was there that Annie Lorrie gave
me a promise true.

1209
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:29,501
Gave me a promise true, which ne'er
forget will be,

1210
01:08:31,296 --> 01:08:56,087
and for Bonny Annie Lorrie,
l would lay me down and dee.

1211
01:08:56,681 --> 01:09:01,673
l ain't never heard you sing that
before. lùs pretty.

1212
01:09:01,933 --> 01:09:07,933
Maxwelton Braes are bonny, where
early forms the dew.

1213
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:17,896
And was there that Annie Lorrie gave
me a promise true.

1214
01:09:19,857 --> 01:09:32,235
Gave me a promise true,
which ne'er forget will be,

1215
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:57,072
and for Bonny Annie Lorrie,
l would lay me down and dee.

1216
01:10:01,832 --> 01:10:05,116
Well, this is the beginning of a
vacation we've all looked forward to.

1217
01:10:05,376 --> 01:10:08,494
And l'm sure we'll enjoy our
holidays more, knowing we've helped

1218
01:10:08,752 --> 01:10:10,707
some unfortunate family who would
have had no Christmas dinner without

1219
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,794
this basket.
And so a Merry...

1220
01:10:14,045 --> 01:10:18,456
Oh, one last thing, this extra pie,
Miss Schilling brought in.

1221
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:22,875
lùs little, and a bit crushed, but,
anybody want it?

1222
01:10:23,133 --> 01:10:28,882
My, what well fed boys and girls.
All right, class.

1223
01:10:29,135 --> 01:10:30,083
Miss McDonald?

1224
01:10:30,344 --> 01:10:30,959
Yes, Frances?

1225
01:10:31,219 --> 01:10:34,551
l just remembered. l know a very
unfortunate family.

1226
01:10:34,804 --> 01:10:38,467
They live in a, in a hovel. They
have two children.

1227
01:10:38,722 --> 01:10:41,389
Little golden-haired twins. And
they're all starving.

1228
01:10:41,639 --> 01:10:43,845
The pie will probably save their
lives.

1229
01:10:44,099 --> 01:10:47,513
Well, then you should take the pie
by all means.

1230
01:10:47,767 --> 01:10:50,055
You can come and get it when class
is dismissed.

1231
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:52,800
Which is right now.
And Merry Christmas to you all.

1232
01:11:02,857 --> 01:11:05,892
That was a very fine Christmas
spirit, Frances.

1233
01:11:06,692 --> 01:11:09,774
But it seems like such a tiny pie to
save so many lives.

1234
01:11:10,026 --> 01:11:12,064
Oh, it won't seem small to them,
Miss McDonald.

1235
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:15,152
Even a little pie can look awful big
if you haven't had much to eat

1236
01:11:15,403 --> 01:11:16,565
for days and days.

1237
01:11:16,821 --> 01:11:19,773
l'll have to tell them to eat slowly,
because they eat very fast on an

1238
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:23,398
empty stomach they'll, they'll...

1239
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:29,322
lt isn't true, iùs all a lie.
l wanted it for myself.

1240
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:34,484
l'll stay after school, l'll do
anything, but don't send a note home.

1241
01:11:34,745 --> 01:11:37,495
l'm not going to punish you child,
for being hungry

1242
01:11:37,746 --> 01:11:39,488
or having an imagination.

1243
01:11:40,538 --> 01:11:42,577
You know, thaùs something very few
people have.

1244
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,159
lùs very precious.

1245
01:11:45,124 --> 01:11:48,407
But it can also be dangerous unless
we learn how to use it.

1246
01:11:50,043 --> 01:11:56,491
Our everyday lives are real and true,
but all the stories in the world,

1247
01:11:56,753 --> 01:12:00,369
all the music, came out of
someone's imagination.

1248
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:04,957
So, if we tell the truth, and write
the lies,

1249
01:12:05,215 --> 01:12:07,539
then they aren't lies
anymore, they become stories.

1250
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,166
Like some of the very nice
compositions you've written, Frances.

1251
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:13,133
Like the one about
my father taking me

1252
01:12:13,385 --> 01:12:14,878
to see the cotton fields
down south?

1253
01:12:15,136 --> 01:12:16,712
We didn't really go.

1254
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,961
l rather imagined you didn't.

1255
01:12:19,221 --> 01:12:21,841
But don't you think it would be
still better

1256
01:12:22,097 --> 01:12:26,222
if you would write about the things
you really know about

1257
01:12:26,473 --> 01:12:28,714
and then add to them with
your imagination.

1258
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:34,508
Even stories shouldn't be
just, well, pipe dreams.

1259
01:12:34,769 --> 01:12:39,262
Pipe dreamers can be very lovable
people but they don't help anybody.

1260
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,887
But they don't help anybody. Now,
think about it a little.

1261
01:12:43,605 --> 01:12:49,972
And have a Merry Christmas.
And enjoy your pie.

1262
01:12:50,984 --> 01:12:54,432
Yes, Miss McDonald.
Thank you, Miss McDonald.

1263
01:13:02,613 --> 01:13:05,233
For GoÔs sakes. Where've you been?
You were supposed to meet me...

1264
01:13:06,323 --> 01:13:08,812
Neeley, l'm going to be a writer.

1265
01:13:09,074 --> 01:13:11,148
All right, but leùs eat the pie.

1266
01:13:12,867 --> 01:13:15,024
Come on, we gotta see about our
Christmas tree.

1267
01:13:15,285 --> 01:13:17,953
Oh, golly, liùs still there,
isn't it?

1268
01:13:23,371 --> 01:13:25,161
Yeah, iùs still here.

1269
01:13:25,413 --> 01:13:26,824
He ain't got much time
left to sell it.

1270
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:29,653
Go on, beat it. You know l ain't
gonna throw 'em til midnight.

1271
01:13:29,916 --> 01:13:31,290
What do you want to do, block the
sidewalk?

1272
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:32,786
Keep customers out?

1273
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,583
Ah, you don't own the sidewalk!

1274
01:13:36,377 --> 01:13:37,491
How about this one, madam?

1275
01:13:39,544 --> 01:13:42,247
No, that one's too big.
l want a small one.

1276
01:13:43,504 --> 01:13:45,412
l got just what you want,
come over here, lady.

1277
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:47,545
Well, now, thaùs more like it.
Thaùs the size.

1278
01:13:48,965 --> 01:13:50,873
lùs awful big to get thrown at you.

1279
01:13:51,675 --> 01:13:53,630
Why does he have to throw 'em at us,
anyway?

1280
01:13:53,883 --> 01:13:56,373
Why can't he can't just give 'em to
us, if he can't sell 'em?

1281
01:13:56,634 --> 01:13:58,709
lf he just gave 'em away,
everybody'd wait.

1282
01:13:58,969 --> 01:14:05,134
They'd never sell any of 'em.
lt smells good.

1283
01:14:10,348 --> 01:14:10,964
There she goes!

1284
01:14:12,808 --> 01:14:14,266
Hey, l'll do it again!
l stumbled!

1285
01:14:14,517 --> 01:14:15,430
Go on! Beat it! Who's next?

1286
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:16,798
Come on, give me a chance, l'm next.

1287
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,802
All right. Here she goes.

1288
01:14:20,645 --> 01:14:21,391
Got it, didn't l?

1289
01:14:21,645 --> 01:14:26,055
All right, take it. Go home. Now,
who wants to try this one?

1290
01:14:26,313 --> 01:14:27,972
Who's man enough for this big one
right here?

1291
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:30,269
l can take anything you got,
mister. Let her fly...

1292
01:14:30,523 --> 01:14:32,065
l'm next! Thaùs my tree!

1293
01:14:32,316 --> 01:14:33,478
Go on, you're too small! Go home!

1294
01:14:33,733 --> 01:14:35,310
Me and my brother, we ain't too
small together.

1295
01:14:36,151 --> 01:14:37,230
Spunky huh?

1296
01:14:37,485 --> 01:14:40,602
All right, but if one of you drop,
you're not gonna get the tree.

1297
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:43,609
There she goes!

1298
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:50,944
Okay, you got it coming. Go ahead.

1299
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:57,367
Oh, quit worrying about 'em, Katie,
they'll be home pretty quick!

1300
01:14:57,617 --> 01:14:59,159
They ain't old enough to be out this
late.

1301
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:02,030
Johnny should made 'em tell what
they was up to.

1302
01:15:02,828 --> 01:15:04,985
No telling whaùs likely to happen
if Francie gets a notion in her head.

1303
01:15:05,246 --> 01:15:06,075
They'll be all right!

1304
01:15:19,835 --> 01:15:23,533
Well, l guess we'd better get on
home. We'll see them tomorrow.

1305
01:15:23,794 --> 01:15:24,873
No, don't go!

1306
01:15:29,047 --> 01:15:31,453
Hey, Pop! Hey, Mom! Hey, Mom!

1307
01:15:35,091 --> 01:15:35,873
Look!

1308
01:15:37,217 --> 01:15:39,884
Holy smoke! Will you look at what
they went and done!

1309
01:15:42,635 --> 01:15:45,837
They're trying to make it Christmas.
Help 'em, kid.

1310
01:15:51,139 --> 01:15:52,052
We got it first!

1311
01:15:52,306 --> 01:15:54,630
Well, sure, l was only wondering if
you couldn't use a little help, huh?

1312
01:15:55,974 --> 01:15:57,005
Come on, come on, come on.

1313
01:15:57,266 --> 01:15:59,139
Well, how would you rustle them
together...

1314
01:15:59,392 --> 01:15:59,926
Look at my face!

1315
01:16:00,184 --> 01:16:02,472
Nobody around here ever saw a tree
like that!

1316
01:16:02,727 --> 01:16:04,137
Well, look at my face, if you don't
believe me.

1317
01:16:04,395 --> 01:16:06,102
Oh, and l see you got the law on
your side.

1318
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:08,677
Merry Christmas, Mr. Nolan, and it
looks like you're going to have one.

1319
01:16:08,937 --> 01:16:10,431
Well, the same to you, Mr. McShane,
and thanks.

1320
01:16:10,688 --> 01:16:11,933
Merry Christmas, Mr. Nolan.

1321
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:13,220
Merry Christmas, Miss Maggie.

1322
01:16:13,481 --> 01:16:14,560
lsn't this a wonderful Christmas,
papa?

1323
01:16:14,815 --> 01:16:17,565
Oh, it is now, Prima Donna. lmagine,
us, having a tree like that.

1324
01:16:17,817 --> 01:16:20,389
And the nicest kids in the world.

1325
01:16:23,902 --> 01:16:25,360
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1326
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:27,270
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Neeley!...

1327
01:16:27,528 --> 01:16:36,278
Silent night, holy night, all is
calm, all is bright...

1328
01:16:36,533 --> 01:16:37,065
He ain't any older than they are.

1329
01:16:37,324 --> 01:16:47,568
Round yon virgin, mother and child,
Holy lnfant so tender and mild,

1330
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:56,282
Sleep in Heavenly peace, Sleep in
heavenly peace.

1331
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:01,330
Silent night, holy night...

1332
01:17:10,295 --> 01:17:11,670
Here... Put it up higher, Bill!

1333
01:17:11,921 --> 01:17:13,331
Steve's the name.

1334
01:17:13,589 --> 01:17:14,454
Thaùs better, Bill.

1335
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,871
Oh, leùs see, you know it!

1336
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,586
Look at all the fun you can have
scratching.

1337
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:23,129
Thank you, Mama.

1338
01:17:23,384 --> 01:17:24,925
You know you hate 'era!

1339
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,504
They're just fine, Mama!

1340
01:17:32,888 --> 01:17:34,631
l got something for you too, Mama.

1341
01:17:35,264 --> 01:17:39,259
Johnny, it was real nice of your
friend Mr. McGarrity

1342
01:17:39,515 --> 01:17:41,472
to send over those candy
canes for the kids.

1343
01:17:41,725 --> 01:17:42,969
Yeah.

1344
01:17:43,976 --> 01:17:48,267
Here, l made these candle for today.
You got to light it now, iùs time.

1345
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:52,600
Merry Christmas, Mama,
from me and Neeley.

1346
01:17:56,147 --> 01:17:59,016
Oh! Oh, iùs pretty. What is it?

1347
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,894
Rose water and glycerine. You rub it
on your hands.

1348
01:18:03,776 --> 01:18:06,348
This is for you, Papa, from me and
Neeley.

1349
01:18:09,736 --> 01:18:15,024
My! l'll quite the thing, won't l?

1350
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,896
l think iùs silly, but Francie said
Papa's always talking about

1351
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:20,319
what nice hands you got.

1352
01:18:20,574 --> 01:18:24,190
lt cost a dime but we had a seltzer
bottle top in the junk.

1353
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,196
Are... ah...

1354
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:31,364
lùs a watch fob. lùs made out of
shoe laces.

1355
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,659
l wove it on a spool with nails.

1356
01:18:35,038 --> 01:18:39,496
Well, if that ain't about the nicest
thing l ever did see.

1357
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:42,451
Maybe iùs kind of silly, you not
having a watch and all...

1358
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:45,114
Well, now madam, we're all out of
mushrooms under glass,

1359
01:18:45,376 --> 01:18:46,869
but l can tell you the time.

1360
01:18:47,126 --> 01:18:50,375
Thaùs the nicest present l ever did
get, Prima Donna.

1361
01:18:50,628 --> 01:18:53,081
And, ah, thank you too, son.

1362
01:18:53,337 --> 01:18:55,873
You're welcome. l guess the shoe
laces was mine.

1363
01:18:57,672 --> 01:18:58,667
lt was silly.

1364
01:18:58,923 --> 01:19:00,202
There ain't nothing silly on
Christmas.

1365
01:19:00,465 --> 01:19:03,168
l, ah... l got a little present here.

1366
01:19:06,884 --> 01:19:08,543
Like l was saying, l got...

1367
01:19:08,801 --> 01:19:09,915
Merry Christmas, Miss Francie.

1368
01:19:10,177 --> 01:19:12,501
Come on, we're in here.
lùs Mr. McShane.

1369
01:19:12,761 --> 01:19:13,757
l hope l'm not intruding.

1370
01:19:14,012 --> 01:19:15,292
Merry Christmas, Mr. McShane.

1371
01:19:15,554 --> 01:19:16,052
Merry Christmas!

1372
01:19:16,305 --> 01:19:18,095
Merry Christmas. l was just ah

1373
01:19:18,347 --> 01:19:19,011
Hello, handsome.

1374
01:19:19,264 --> 01:19:20,888
Oh, Mrs. Edwards.

1375
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:24,304
l was just passing and l happened to
see the light still burning.

1376
01:19:24,558 --> 01:19:26,715
And l was thinking l'd like
to have a hand in

1377
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,682
decorating that fine
Christmas tree.

1378
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:30,511
...l see someone's already provided.

1379
01:19:30,769 --> 01:19:33,519
Well, we can always use more of 'em,
Mr. McShane. Thank you kindly.

1380
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:36,887
Won't you come in and have a cup of
coffee with us?

1381
01:19:37,146 --> 01:19:40,679
Oh, thanks, no. Ah, this evening's
for families.

1382
01:19:40,939 --> 01:19:44,556
And, l got to be getting home now,
so, l'll say goodbye and...

1383
01:19:44,816 --> 01:19:46,607
and Merry Christmas to everybody.

1384
01:19:46,859 --> 01:19:48,186
Thank you, Mr. McShane, good night.

1385
01:19:48,443 --> 01:19:50,233
That was mighty nice of him.

1386
01:19:51,111 --> 01:19:52,520
Mr. McShane's a fine man.

1387
01:19:52,777 --> 01:19:55,101
He's l think sometimes a lonely man.

1388
01:19:55,362 --> 01:19:58,610
Well, like l was saying, l... l got
something here.

1389
01:19:59,239 --> 01:20:02,902
l mean, l got a present for somebody
that ain't exactly here.

1390
01:20:03,157 --> 01:20:06,986
Grandma helped me pick it out. lùs
for... you know who.

1391
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:10,861
Oh, Bill, iùs beautiful.
Look everybody.

1392
01:20:13,786 --> 01:20:16,110
Oh, Bill, darling, l've never been
so happy.

1393
01:20:16,787 --> 01:20:18,162
l'm going to get some coffee.

1394
01:20:31,585 --> 01:20:32,415
Katie?

1395
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,748
Yeah.

1396
01:20:39,296 --> 01:20:40,540
l'm glad for you.

1397
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:45,757
l don't know. l'm scared, l guess.

1398
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,497
You got no call to be. Look how
swell them two are.

1399
01:20:52,009 --> 01:20:57,297
Told Johnny yet? Well, maybe
you oughta, it might help him.

1400
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:06,597
Yeah. You better take the coffee in.

1401
01:21:07,807 --> 01:21:10,095
You're a fine girl, Katie. l never
said any different.

1402
01:21:32,234 --> 01:21:35,187
Thaùs for nothing, Johnny. Except
for being a nice guy.

1403
01:21:37,611 --> 01:21:38,606
Coffee everybody!

1404
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:54,950
Well, l guess thaùs about all.

1405
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:58,029
Johnny, l gotta tell you something.

1406
01:21:59,287 --> 01:22:01,113
Maybe it ain't the right time, and
maybe it is.

1407
01:22:01,371 --> 01:22:07,322
The reason l moved us up here, we're
gonna have a baby, Johnny,

1408
01:22:07,581 --> 01:22:10,071
thaùs why l've been scrimping
so much and trying so hard to say.

1409
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:16,539
well, thaùs...! . Well, l'm awful
glad, Katie, if you are.

1410
01:22:16,794 --> 01:22:18,287
There's a lot we've got to think
about, Johnny.

1411
01:22:18,545 --> 01:22:21,080
Oh, l know, but we'll make out.
Maybe things will be different.

1412
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:24,289
And we'll have one to grow up with
all over again.

1413
01:22:24,547 --> 01:22:25,495
l got things all figured out.

1414
01:22:25,755 --> 01:22:29,253
l ought to be able to work until,
well anyway, April.

1415
01:22:29,507 --> 01:22:31,166
And then Francie'll have to leave
school

1416
01:22:31,425 --> 01:22:32,455
and take out her working papers.

1417
01:22:32,717 --> 01:22:35,384
She's young, but with what she can
make, we ought to be able to make out

1418
01:22:35,634 --> 01:22:37,009
Oh, but we can't do that, Katie

1419
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,718
l don't like it any better than you
do, Johnny, but l thought

1420
01:22:38,969 --> 01:22:40,877
and l thought, and there
ain't no other way.

1421
01:22:41,137 --> 01:22:43,591
And Johnny, you got to help with
something. She listens to you.

1422
01:22:44,388 --> 01:22:47,590
You gotta quit getting her so all
excited about her school.

1423
01:22:47,848 --> 01:22:51,131
Why can't it be Neeley? He's the boy,
and he don't care like she does.

1424
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:52,967
Well, maybe thaùs why.

1425
01:22:53,225 --> 01:22:56,177
Maybe iùll do her good to get out
in the world and learn something,

1426
01:22:56,434 --> 01:22:56,801
learn how to take care of herself,

1427
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:58,933
learn something practical
while she's young.

1428
01:22:59,186 --> 01:23:00,216
She's gotta learn some day.

1429
01:23:00,478 --> 01:23:05,895
Well, well, there must be another
way. Oh, l don't know.

1430
01:23:06,146 --> 01:23:07,805
l'll try and swing anything. l'll do
anything.

1431
01:23:08,064 --> 01:23:09,605
We can't count on that, Johnny...

1432
01:23:13,108 --> 01:23:15,728
Don't look at me like that, Johnny,
it ain't my fault!

1433
01:23:19,819 --> 01:23:21,727
Oh, it ain't your fault either,
l guess. l don't know.

1434
01:23:24,529 --> 01:23:27,730
Anyway, one member of the Nolan
family will get to graduate,

1435
01:23:27,989 --> 01:23:30,027
and she come close.
Thaùs something.

1436
01:23:34,284 --> 01:23:37,448
You'd better put out the light and
leùs get some rest.

1437
01:24:04,087 --> 01:24:06,623
Oh, l thought you'd be asleep, Prima
Donna.

1438
01:24:09,047 --> 01:24:13,671
Ah-ah. l've been thinking. l might
be going to be a writer.

1439
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:15,960
l've just about decided.

1440
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:20,173
l knew you when you was going to be
a lady fireman.

1441
01:24:21,135 --> 01:24:24,051
Don't joke, Papa. l'm serious.

1442
01:24:24,303 --> 01:24:25,844
All right, l baby.

1443
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:31,383
All l meant was, maybe iùs better
not to get your heart set...

1444
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,006
on just one thing, in case
something happens.

1445
01:24:35,974 --> 01:24:41,214
She said, Miss McDonald, l mean, she
said maybe l could be.

1446
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:45,140
She said l have imagination.

1447
01:24:45,395 --> 01:24:47,552
Do you think l have, Papa?

1448
01:24:47,813 --> 01:24:49,720
Oh, sure you have, baby.

1449
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:52,386
Those compositions of yours are sure
fine, but...

1450
01:24:52,648 --> 01:24:54,307
She said l'd have to work hard.

1451
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,182
She said imagination
wasn't any good if

1452
01:24:57,441 --> 01:25:00,014
you were just a pipe
dreamer about it.

1453
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:05,515
You didn't help anybody that way.
Not even yourself, she said.

1454
01:25:05,778 --> 01:25:10,022
Yeah, l see. A pipe dreamer.

1455
01:25:11,822 --> 01:25:16,529
l'm not putting it good like she did.
l wish you could have heard her.

1456
01:25:16,783 --> 01:25:18,027
She was wonderful.

1457
01:25:19,367 --> 01:25:22,531
For ever and ever l'll be glad you
helped me go to that school, Papa.

1458
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,990
You kind of like that school, don't
you, baby?

1459
01:25:25,244 --> 01:25:32,986
Yes, oh yes. And she said lots more.
l've been trying to remember.

1460
01:25:35,581 --> 01:25:37,739
She said, even if you have
imagination;

1461
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:40,121
iùs better to write about
the things you know about

1462
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:46,410
so they'll be true, and...
and the way things are only.

1463
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:48,875
Only what, baby?

1464
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:52,504
Papa, the people in the hall when we
brought up the tree,

1465
01:25:52,755 --> 01:25:55,375
the look on their faces
all friendly and nice.

1466
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:59,212
Why can't people be like that all
the time? Not just on Christmas?

1467
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:09,135
Well, l guess iùs because...
Well, l don't know.

1468
01:26:10,471 --> 01:26:12,711
Maybe iùs because Christmas is like
people really

1469
01:26:12,972 --> 01:26:14,346
are and the other part ain't true.

1470
01:26:15,473 --> 01:26:18,093
And with that imagination of yours,
if you think about it hard enough,

1471
01:26:18,349 --> 01:26:20,755
you know, like it ought to be.

1472
01:26:21,016 --> 01:26:22,047
But when you get to thinking.

1473
01:26:22,309 --> 01:26:25,676
Papa, the people in stories, they
don't just live happily ever after,

1474
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:27,215
do they?

1475
01:26:27,478 --> 01:26:28,391
No, baby, but...

1476
01:26:28,645 --> 01:26:29,593
But the trouble is...

1477
01:26:29,854 --> 01:26:33,600
it doesn't feel good when
you think about things like that.

1478
01:26:35,647 --> 01:26:38,184
l mean, like they really are.

1479
01:26:40,108 --> 01:26:42,265
You better stick out your tongue,
Prima Donna.

1480
01:26:45,985 --> 01:26:50,229
Oh, iùs just like l thought. You've
got a bad case.

1481
01:26:50,486 --> 01:26:51,896
A very bad case.

1482
01:26:52,154 --> 01:26:53,647
Case of what, Papa?

1483
01:26:53,905 --> 01:26:58,813
A very bad case of growing up.
Thaùs all it is.

1484
01:27:01,742 --> 01:27:06,530
Oh it ain't fun some times, but,
don't you be afraid.

1485
01:27:06,785 --> 01:27:09,488
l don't want you should ever be
afraid.

1486
01:27:12,913 --> 01:27:14,785
You're so nice, Papa.

1487
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:18,038
l guess iùs better if you don't
just stay young all your life.

1488
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:20,992
lùll be much nicer growing up.

1489
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:31,201
Yeah. And you get to see things
like they really are.

1490
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:04,050
Good night, baby.

1491
01:28:04,308 --> 01:28:09,761
Good night, Papa. l'm sleepy now.

1492
01:28:10,019 --> 01:28:14,559
Thaùs fine, baby. Just fine.

1493
01:28:41,281 --> 01:28:42,656
Ain't you coming to bed, Johnny?

1494
01:28:42,907 --> 01:28:45,112
No, l'm going to take a little walk.

1495
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:48,236
Don't start drinking,
not tonight, Johnny.

1496
01:28:48,493 --> 01:28:50,365
l won't, Katie, l won't.

1497
01:29:17,004 --> 01:29:18,580
Well, did he go out on a job,
do you know?

1498
01:29:18,838 --> 01:29:21,244
lf he did, he didn't get it through
us.

1499
01:29:24,382 --> 01:29:25,163
Thank you.

1500
01:29:34,886 --> 01:29:37,210
Oh, how are you, Mrs. Nolan,
and a Happy New Year to you.

1501
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:42,544
Same to you, Mr. McGarrity.
l just came to.

1502
01:29:45,224 --> 01:29:48,306
well, l happened to be passing by
and l thought l'd run in and thank

1503
01:29:48,558 --> 01:29:50,845
you for the candy canes you sent us.
lt was nice of you.

1504
01:29:51,101 --> 01:29:52,808
Oh, thaùs all right. lt wasn't much.

1505
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:59,889
Well, it was nice of you. Good night,
Mr. McGarrity.

1506
01:30:00,147 --> 01:30:04,971
Good night, Mrs. Nolan. Mrs. Nolan,
Johnny ain't here.

1507
01:30:05,231 --> 01:30:06,310
He ain't been here since before
Christmas.

1508
01:30:27,866 --> 01:30:30,106
Oh, l'm afraid iùs bad news l'm
bringing you, Mrs. Nolan.

1509
01:30:30,367 --> 01:30:33,567
Our station just got a report that
Mr. Nolan was found

1510
01:30:33,826 --> 01:30:36,612
over in Manhattan, very sick.
He's been taken to a hospital.

1511
01:30:38,328 --> 01:30:40,284
See that Neeley gets to school on
time in the morning.

1512
01:30:40,537 --> 01:30:41,616
There's an apple for your lunches.

1513
01:30:41,871 --> 01:30:44,622
The report says that he just
collapsed,

1514
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:46,746
right in the doorway of
an employment agency.

1515
01:30:46,999 --> 01:30:50,744
And he'd just been going out on a
job, as sand hog in a tunnel, they said.

1516
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,493
And he hadn't been drinking, ma'am.

1517
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:55,750
He'd been waiting there a long time
for the job.

1518
01:30:56,002 --> 01:30:58,243
He was just sick.

1519
01:31:05,005 --> 01:31:06,547
We did everything we could.

1520
01:31:06,798 --> 01:31:08,256
Yeah, sure, l know.

1521
01:31:09,966 --> 01:31:11,874
What are you writing down that he
died from, Doctor?

1522
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:14,208
Acute alcoholism and pneumonia.
One led to the other.

1523
01:31:16,386 --> 01:31:18,376
l don't want you to write down that
he died like that.

1524
01:31:20,637 --> 01:31:21,799
Put just the pneumonia.

1525
01:31:22,054 --> 01:31:22,551
l can't do that.

1526
01:31:22,804 --> 01:31:25,673
Pneumonia was the direct cause of
death, but the alcoholism was...

1527
01:31:25,931 --> 01:31:26,630
Look, he's dead.

1528
01:31:26,889 --> 01:31:29,426
l've got two nice kids that are going
to grow up to amount to something.

1529
01:31:29,682 --> 01:31:32,468
Why do you have to make it hard by
saying that their father

1530
01:31:32,726 --> 01:31:36,008
died from the drink when thaùs
only a little piece of the truth?

1531
01:31:36,268 --> 01:31:39,303
He wasn't drinking, they said so.
He was out looking for work.

1532
01:31:42,729 --> 01:31:44,306
Why can't you put that down?

1533
01:31:47,315 --> 01:31:50,930
Cause of death: pneumonia.

1534
01:31:55,901 --> 01:31:57,229
Everlasting rest and happiness,

1535
01:31:57,485 --> 01:31:59,773
through the infinite merits
of Jesus Christ.

1536
01:32:01,028 --> 01:32:01,728
Oh, God,

1537
01:32:01,987 --> 01:32:04,902
great and omnipotent judge of the
living and the dead,

1538
01:32:05,154 --> 01:32:08,522
if all whom we are to appear
after this short life,

1539
01:32:08,781 --> 01:32:10,488
to render an account of our worth,

1540
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:14,688
let our hearts we pray to be deeply
wounded at the sight of this death,

1541
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:18,032
and while we consign the body of the
deceased to the earth,

1542
01:32:18,285 --> 01:32:22,197
let us be mindful of our own frailties
and mortality,

1543
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:26,365
that walking always in thy fear and
in the ways of thy commandments,

1544
01:32:26,622 --> 01:32:30,238
we may after our departure from this world,
experience

1545
01:32:30,499 --> 01:32:34,742
a merciful judgement and rejoice
in everlasting happiness.

1546
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,872
Through Christ our lord.

1547
01:32:37,126 --> 01:32:40,707
All them people, and the flowers.

1548
01:32:42,253 --> 01:32:44,541
Some of them from people l never
heard of even.

1549
01:32:44,796 --> 01:32:49,501
Who'd have thought, that many folks.

1550
01:32:50,923 --> 01:32:56,259
l mean they was carrying on like
they was his family, or...

1551
01:32:56,509 --> 01:32:59,876
or... l don't know.

1552
01:33:03,553 --> 01:33:05,793
Yeah, he took the time to make a lot
of people love him all right.

1553
01:33:06,804 --> 01:33:09,508
lùs hard to figure out so many of
them showing up.

1554
01:33:09,764 --> 01:33:14,470
And they was feeling something.

1555
01:33:16,642 --> 01:33:18,965
l mean, there was no reason for them
to put on.

1556
01:33:19,226 --> 01:33:22,889
He was nobody big, he was just a...

1557
01:33:23,144 --> 01:33:24,851
Katie, don't talk about it no more,
kid.

1558
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:36,063
Francis!

1559
01:33:36,316 --> 01:33:38,984
Leùs leave her be, Katie. She
maybe wants to be by herself.

1560
01:33:39,234 --> 01:33:41,391
She's taking on kind of funny, she
ain't even cried.

1561
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:02,567
l'd like my father's shaving cup.
That one, "Nolan".

1562
01:34:07,829 --> 01:34:11,741
Oh, you're the little girl. Yes,
l'll clean it up for you.

1563
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,873
He was a fine man.

1564
01:34:18,124 --> 01:34:21,289
Tell your Mama that l,
his barber, said this.

1565
01:35:02,392 --> 01:35:03,387
Francis...

1566
01:35:04,601 --> 01:35:05,431
What?

1567
01:35:05,685 --> 01:35:09,551
Francis, do you know where you're
going?

1568
01:35:09,812 --> 01:35:12,384
No place.

1569
01:35:14,856 --> 01:35:16,101
Francis?

1570
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:19,220
Yes, Mama?

1571
01:35:20,149 --> 01:35:22,355
lt was nice of the neighbors to send
over all that food,

1572
01:35:22,609 --> 01:35:23,639
don't you want something?

1573
01:35:25,318 --> 01:35:26,397
No, Mama.

1574
01:35:29,362 --> 01:35:31,235
l wanted to talk to you, Francie.

1575
01:35:33,988 --> 01:35:39,608
l want things to go on,
reading and all. l want to do...

1576
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:44,903
Well, l gotta be Mama and Papa both
to you now, Francie.

1577
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:56,954
Yes, Mama. ls that all, Mama?

1578
01:35:59,749 --> 01:36:06,412
Well, you gotta go right now,
Francie.

1579
01:36:06,668 --> 01:36:09,418
l'll be back. Honest l will.

1580
01:36:19,465 --> 01:36:24,622
Mom, l guess l'm a little hungry.

1581
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:34,919
Look, he can't be dead. He can't.
They don't understand.

1582
01:36:38,681 --> 01:36:43,803
Maybe you could let me have a baby
some day, and it could be a boy,

1583
01:36:44,059 --> 01:36:46,974
so it could be just like him.

1584
01:36:49,477 --> 01:36:54,765
lùd have to be me.
Nobody else loved him like l do.

1585
01:36:57,564 --> 01:37:07,724
Maybe you could do that for me. And
if you could, he wouldn't even die.

1586
01:37:17,405 --> 01:37:20,072
l hope you don't think l'm forward
coming in like this, Mrs. Nolan.

1587
01:37:20,323 --> 01:37:22,444
How are you, Francie?

1588
01:37:22,699 --> 01:37:23,612
l'm well, thank you.

1589
01:37:23,866 --> 01:37:27,201
Have a chair. Francie, see if Mr.
McGarrity won't have some coffee.

1590
01:37:27,201 --> 01:37:30,449
Not for me, thank you.
l figured l'd ought to come.

1591
01:37:30,702 --> 01:37:33,736
l suppose you know how Johnny
and l done business.

1592
01:37:33,953 --> 01:37:37,783
He used to give me money to keep
and then draw against it.

1593
01:37:38,038 --> 01:37:42,994
l got to looking around.

1594
01:37:43,249 --> 01:37:44,956
And... what do you think?

1595
01:37:45,208 --> 01:37:48,409
l had pretty near 5 bucks
in his box.

1596
01:37:48,709 --> 01:37:53,582
Ando so l figured
it belongs to you.

1597
01:37:56,129 --> 01:37:59,792
lùd more likely be
that he owed you.

1598
01:38:00,089 --> 01:38:03,502
But thank you very much.

1599
01:38:03,757 --> 01:38:07,799
l just thought...
- We'll make out.

1600
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:10,457
There's something else, then.

1601
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:13,717
Maybe you wouldn't mind if...

1602
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:17,051
if Francie and Neeley
come down and work for me,

1603
01:38:17,304 --> 01:38:20,089
afternoons like. l mean,
after school and Saturdays.

1604
01:38:20,347 --> 01:38:23,761
Maybe it isn't just the place
you'd favour them working,

1605
01:38:23,973 --> 01:38:26,545
but l'd keep an eye on them.

1606
01:38:26,808 --> 01:38:29,973
And l could pay them
2 dollars a week a piece.

1607
01:38:30,226 --> 01:38:34,173
l'd take it
as a real favour, Madame.

1608
01:38:36,603 --> 01:38:38,604
You're an awful bad liar.

1609
01:38:38,604 --> 01:38:44,225
But you're a very good man.
l'm ashamed l didn't know before.

1610
01:38:44,482 --> 01:38:46,638
No, it isn't that, Madame.
Johnny was...

1611
01:38:46,899 --> 01:38:50,183
Well, l don't know. Johnny...

1612
01:38:50,442 --> 01:38:52,979
Johnny always talked
about his family like...

1613
01:38:53,152 --> 01:38:55,606
like folks ought to,
only they don't.

1614
01:38:55,861 --> 01:38:59,478
And whenever he talked about it

1615
01:38:59,738 --> 01:39:01,112
he always made you

1616
01:39:01,363 --> 01:39:05,109
feel better,
or you wanted to laugh.

1617
01:39:05,823 --> 01:39:07,482
laugh. Like that sea shell l had
there.

1618
01:39:07,741 --> 01:39:10,989
He was always... he was always
listening to it and...

1619
01:39:11,243 --> 01:39:12,985
and telling you what it was saying.

1620
01:39:14,494 --> 01:39:16,283
He was always giving things like
that to people.

1621
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,991
He was a fine man, Mrs. Nolan.

1622
01:39:27,332 --> 01:39:30,332
l'd a glad to let the children work
for you, Mr. McCarrity.

1623
01:39:30,583 --> 01:39:35,408
And the four dollars a week will
keep us until the baby comes.

1624
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:37,707
And Francie won't have to quit
school, she can keep on,

1625
01:39:37,961 --> 01:39:38,743
and they can both...

1626
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:46,630
Well, iùs a deal, then.

1627
01:39:46,881 --> 01:39:49,999
And you tell them to come through
the family entrance tomorrow after

1628
01:39:50,258 --> 01:39:53,839
school and ah...
ls that all right with you, Francie?

1629
01:39:54,093 --> 01:39:55,255
Yes.

1630
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:03,803
Well, ah, well iùs settled then,
and good day to you, Mrs. Nolan.

1631
01:40:04,055 --> 01:40:08,382
And thank you again, Mr. McGarrity.
Francie?

1632
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:09,838
Yes, Mama?

1633
01:40:12,434 --> 01:40:14,509
l'm glad you can keep on with your
school.

1634
01:40:14,768 --> 01:40:18,679
l was hoping something like this
would happen but l didn't want to

1635
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:20,762
say anything until the time come.

1636
01:40:22,688 --> 01:40:27,098
But your Papa and l talked it all
over and there were reasons

1637
01:40:27,356 --> 01:40:30,972
and there just wasn't any other way.

1638
01:40:32,650 --> 01:40:35,981
lt doesn't matter. Papa saved one
from it.

1639
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:53,648
Hi-ya, kid.

1640
01:40:53,909 --> 01:40:56,398
Well, they're sure taking chances l
wouldn't, leaving you handling meat.

1641
01:40:57,369 --> 01:40:58,234
Where's France.

1642
01:40:58,494 --> 01:41:04,362
Hello, kid. How are you lamb? Look,
you gotta do something for me.

1643
01:41:04,621 --> 01:41:06,529
This was in the paper and l cut it
out.

1644
01:41:06,789 --> 01:41:10,369
You got to read it to me.
Whaùs the matter, hon?

1645
01:41:10,624 --> 01:41:12,283
Nothing, l'm all right, Aunt Sissy.

1646
01:41:12,541 --> 01:41:14,083
No, you ain't. You ain't been since...

1647
01:41:14,334 --> 01:41:17,166
Look, don't you think you better
spill it to your Aunt Sissy?

1648
01:41:17,418 --> 01:41:19,125
What is it you want me to read to
you, Aunt Sissy?

1649
01:41:19,377 --> 01:41:22,412
Well, we'll get that out of the way
first. Look, here it is.

1650
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:24,745
Likely you don't remember him, but
iùs my last husband, Bill.

1651
01:41:25,004 --> 01:41:26,546
The one l thought was dead,
but he ain't.

1652
01:41:26,797 --> 01:41:28,835
He's got his picture in there and l
want to know what it says.

1653
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:31,164
Maybe it says where he lives so's l
can write to him about getting a

1654
01:41:31,423 --> 01:41:32,205
divorce or something.

1655
01:41:32,465 --> 01:41:34,291
l got the best husband in all the
world now,

1656
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:36,292
and l don't want this here one
bobbing up and making no trouble.

1657
01:41:36,551 --> 01:41:39,301
He's a fireman someplace. l can tell
that from his clothes.

1658
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:41,176
He was just starting out in the
fireman business...

1659
01:41:41,428 --> 01:41:43,051
lt says he's a hero. He saved some
people in a fire.

1660
01:41:43,304 --> 01:41:44,133
Does it say where?

1661
01:41:44,388 --> 01:41:46,674
The ninth precinct. Manhattan.

1662
01:41:46,929 --> 01:41:50,012
Manhattan, huh? Couldn't make the
grade in Brooklyn, l guess.

1663
01:41:50,264 --> 01:41:52,884
l want you to write to him, Francie.
Write this: "Dear Bill...

1664
01:41:53,141 --> 01:41:55,465
This says his name is Roland Polasky.

1665
01:41:55,725 --> 01:41:59,424
Thaùs right. l remember. Make it
"Dear Mr. Polasky.

1666
01:42:00,685 --> 01:42:03,353
Being's as now l'm married to
somebody else, l want you to see

1667
01:42:03,603 --> 01:42:05,262
about getting a real legal divorce.

1668
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,678
Because l thought you was dead but
you ain't.

1669
01:42:07,938 --> 01:42:10,262
And because you got the money now on
account of the reward.

1670
01:42:10,523 --> 01:42:12,396
Yours very truly, Sissy." Something
like that.

1671
01:42:12,649 --> 01:42:14,687
But Aunt Sissy, he must have already
done that.

1672
01:42:14,941 --> 01:42:16,683
Because it says here he's married
again.

1673
01:42:16,941 --> 01:42:18,020
lt does?

1674
01:42:18,275 --> 01:42:20,101
"On the human interest side of the
story,

1675
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:23,561
Mrs. Polasky had returned home only
the day before from the hospital,

1676
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:25,977
after presenting Mr. Polasky with
a brand new son,

1677
01:42:26,237 --> 01:42:27,814
the fourth child of the marriage.

1678
01:42:28,072 --> 01:42:30,940
So, if he got a divorce that long
ago, you don't have to.

1679
01:42:31,197 --> 01:42:33,734
Then my being married to Bill, this
one l mean, is all legal?

1680
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:36,740
Well, now, if that ain't a load off
my chest.

1681
01:42:36,991 --> 01:42:40,939
You know something, l think l'll
give Bill Polasky a wedding present.

1682
01:42:41,202 --> 01:42:43,573
But Aunt Sissy, you can't. He's been
married for years.

1683
01:42:44,619 --> 01:42:48,567
Four kids, huh? Must be a sickly
woman, this Mrs. Polasky,

1684
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,572
going to the hospital just
to have a baby.

1685
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:53,865
Oh, no, lots of people go there now
to have babies. lùs better.

1686
01:42:54,124 --> 01:42:57,372
Sure enough? You know something?

1687
01:42:57,625 --> 01:43:01,240
l'm gonna cash in my funeral policy
and have my baby at a hospital.

1688
01:43:01,501 --> 01:43:03,991
And when my baby is born, and lives,

1689
01:43:05,211 --> 01:43:07,167
l want you to write that R. Polasky
and announce it.

1690
01:43:08,254 --> 01:43:09,368
Boy do l feel better.

1691
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:11,207
And now, chickapea, we'll talk about
you.

1692
01:43:11,464 --> 01:43:13,171
Can't your Aunt Sissy help you any?

1693
01:43:13,423 --> 01:43:14,123
l'm all right.

1694
01:43:14,382 --> 01:43:15,127
No, you aren't honey.

1695
01:43:15,381 --> 01:43:16,839
Not all shut up like that, l know
how you feel,

1696
01:43:17,091 --> 01:43:18,205
but you can't keep hanging on to it.

1697
01:43:18,466 --> 01:43:23,291
l'm ail right. l don't want to talk
about it.

1698
01:43:23,552 --> 01:43:23,919
All right, baby. All right. But l'll
tell you what.

1699
01:43:24,177 --> 01:43:25,884
You can do something for me.

1700
01:43:26,137 --> 01:43:31,423
Look, your Mama feels awful bad too.
She needs you.

1701
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,303
Why don't you talk to her about it.

1702
01:43:33,597 --> 01:43:35,055
She doesn't need me.
No she doesn't.

1703
01:43:35,306 --> 01:43:36,053
She's got Neeley!

1704
01:43:36,307 --> 01:43:37,884
Why wasn't it Neeley she was going
to make quit school.

1705
01:43:38,141 --> 01:43:39,006
He never cared about it.

1706
01:43:39,267 --> 01:43:40,677
She doesn't love me like Papa did.

1707
01:43:40,934 --> 01:43:42,593
And she didn't love him, either. Not
really.

1708
01:43:42,852 --> 01:43:45,803
She hurt him, l saw her. And he
never hurt anybody.

1709
01:43:46,102 --> 01:43:48,509
l'm gonna finish this grade because
he gave it to me

1710
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:49,968
and then l'll work for her.

1711
01:43:50,229 --> 01:43:52,434
But she can't be Papa to me, she
can't ever!

1712
01:43:52,689 --> 01:43:53,684
Don't feel like that, baby, don't.

1713
01:43:53,939 --> 01:43:58,599
Leave me alone. l'm all right.
Please go away and leave me alone.

1714
01:44:01,442 --> 01:44:04,110
All right, chickapea, all right.

1715
01:44:12,197 --> 01:44:13,571
Ah, Mr. Sterns...
Yes, sir.

1716
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:20,230
Francie...

1717
01:44:21,658 --> 01:44:22,488
Yes, Mama?

1718
01:44:25,619 --> 01:44:26,898
l want to talk to you, Francie.

1719
01:44:32,037 --> 01:44:33,068
Yes, Mama?

1720
01:44:33,913 --> 01:44:38,205
lt isn't going to be long now, for
me, l mean, for my baby.

1721
01:44:38,457 --> 01:44:40,745
We can't come to a hospital.

1722
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,580
There isn't even going to be enough
money for a woman to come and help.

1723
01:44:46,835 --> 01:44:52,039
l'm going to need you, Francie.
Don't ever be far away.

1724
01:44:52,296 --> 01:44:55,829
Neeley's, well, a boy ain't much
good at a time like this.

1725
01:44:56,089 --> 01:45:00,878
l'm counting on you, Francie.
You won't forget that, will you?

1726
01:45:02,841 --> 01:45:06,125
All right, Mama. l'll remember.

1727
01:45:06,385 --> 01:45:08,341
Which one of you is Mr. Steven
Edwards?

1728
01:45:08,594 --> 01:45:09,673
Thaùs me.

1729
01:45:10,512 --> 01:45:12,254
Well, there are three in your family
now.

1730
01:45:12,513 --> 01:45:13,970
You are the father of a pretty fine
boy.

1731
01:45:14,221 --> 01:45:15,299
ls he alive?
- Very much so.

1732
01:45:15,555 --> 01:45:18,223
He was a little reluctant about it
at first, l had to rouse him with a

1733
01:45:18,473 --> 01:45:20,595
little oxygen, now he's mad at me,
you ought to hear him.

1734
01:45:20,849 --> 01:45:22,011
l've got to see him.

1735
01:45:22,266 --> 01:45:24,092
Well, neither one of them are quite
up to a visit just now,

1736
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:25,548
in a little while.

1737
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:29,886
The learning. The learning that
saved that baby.

1738
01:45:30,144 --> 01:45:31,602
Thaùs fine, Bill.

1739
01:45:32,645 --> 01:45:34,055
Where are you going, Uncle Bill?

1740
01:45:34,313 --> 01:45:36,020
l'm going out and get some
strawberry ice cream

1741
01:45:36,272 --> 01:45:39,307
and a rattle for my son.
And whaùs more, my name ain't Bill.

1742
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:42,227
lùs Steve, do you hear that? l'm a
Papa and my name's Steve.

1743
01:45:42,483 --> 01:45:47,604
And iùs Uncle Steve, too. Steve,
Steve...

1744
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:51,267
So, we have a man in the family.

1745
01:45:58,697 --> 01:45:59,941
Quick as we see she's all right,

1746
01:46:00,198 --> 01:46:02,236
you go on up to McGarrity's and
see if you can do my work, too.

1747
01:46:02,490 --> 01:46:04,281
l'm going to finish the scrubbing
for her.

1748
01:46:04,533 --> 01:46:05,647
She oughtn't do any more.

1749
01:46:05,909 --> 01:46:11,908
She wasn't feeling good this morning.
Mama!

1750
01:46:19,914 --> 01:46:20,696
Mama!

1751
01:46:21,998 --> 01:46:23,373
ln here, Frances.

1752
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:31,955
You all right, Mama?

1753
01:46:37,797 --> 01:46:40,962
Give Neeley a nickel to go after
Grandma and Sissy.

1754
01:46:42,007 --> 01:46:43,713
He can walk home after.

1755
01:46:44,549 --> 01:46:46,505
Get me a nightgown in that bottom
drawer.

1756
01:46:53,928 --> 01:46:56,050
Hurry, don't stand there staring.

1757
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:05,470
ls she going to die?

1758
01:47:05,724 --> 01:47:08,558
Of course not, iùs the baby. You
heard what Mama said, and hurry.

1759
01:47:08,809 --> 01:47:11,133
And don't forget stopping at
McGarrity's on the way back.

1760
01:47:11,394 --> 01:47:23,226
We can't lose the work. She only
wants me now. Mama!

1761
01:47:24,524 --> 01:47:28,187
What is it?
Oh, l'll be there in a minute.

1762
01:47:54,786 --> 01:47:57,323
You're taking real good care of me,
Francie.

1763
01:47:58,745 --> 01:48:00,120
Am l, Mama?

1764
01:48:14,043 --> 01:48:15,418
Umm. Tastes good.

1765
01:48:25,006 --> 01:48:26,832
Can l get you a glass of water,
Mama?

1766
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:29,583
When l want something,
l'll ask for it.

1767
01:48:29,841 --> 01:48:31,216
Yes, Mama.

1768
01:48:33,218 --> 01:48:36,300
Don't just stand there and throw
questions at me, l'm too tired.

1769
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:39,718
You'd better have some coffee too.

1770
01:48:39,971 --> 01:48:42,840
Mama, even if Neeley is a boy,
wouldn't you rather have him here?

1771
01:48:43,096 --> 01:48:44,471
He's always such a comfort to you.

1772
01:48:44,722 --> 01:48:46,429
No, iùs you thaùs a comfort now.
What time is it?

1773
01:48:46,681 --> 01:48:47,676
l don't know, Mama.

1774
01:48:47,932 --> 01:48:48,880
Get the clock.

1775
01:48:58,769 --> 01:49:00,144
one minute to Mama.

1776
01:49:00,395 --> 01:49:02,517
Are you sure it isn't slow?

1777
01:49:02,771 --> 01:49:04,051
No, Mama.

1778
01:49:04,313 --> 01:49:06,637
Maybe iùs fast, then.

1779
01:49:06,898 --> 01:49:10,230
l'll look at the jeweler's clock out
the parlor window.

1780
01:49:16,193 --> 01:49:25,227
That candle's pretty, like Christmas.
That was the night l told him.

1781
01:49:33,492 --> 01:49:35,614
lùs nice having a visit from my
daughter.

1782
01:49:39,078 --> 01:49:41,650
l didn't want for you to have to
grow up so soon.

1783
01:49:42,579 --> 01:49:44,866
l didn't want for you to have to
quit school.

1784
01:49:45,121 --> 01:49:46,663
l tried to tell him that.

1785
01:49:46,914 --> 01:49:49,036
He didn't mind about the baby, but
he never forgived me

1786
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:50,867
for wanting you to quit school.

1787
01:49:51,124 --> 01:49:58,083
l told him and he just went out. You
never forgived me, either.

1788
01:49:58,335 --> 01:49:59,497
Please don't, Mama.

1789
01:49:59,752 --> 01:50:01,329
He would have bought you dolls
instead of milk.

1790
01:50:01,586 --> 01:50:04,420
l don't know, maybe you would have
been happier. l don't know.

1791
01:50:04,671 --> 01:50:07,624
l never woulÔve thought of giving
you that school, like he did.

1792
01:50:07,881 --> 01:50:12,835
And all them fine compositions of
yours. l never read one of 'em.

1793
01:50:13,091 --> 01:50:17,631
l shoulda had time. Johnny did.
But l couldn't do no different.

1794
01:50:17,885 --> 01:50:19,841
l don't know how l could do any
different.

1795
01:50:27,722 --> 01:50:28,919
What time is it?

1796
01:50:30,014 --> 01:50:31,721
One minute after four, Mama.

1797
01:50:33,683 --> 01:50:36,172
Rinse a cloth out in cold water,
wipe my face.

1798
01:50:48,772 --> 01:50:50,645
Don't let her die, please!

1799
01:51:06,821 --> 01:51:10,651
Mama, what if the baby comes before
Grandma and Aunt Sissy get here?

1800
01:51:11,323 --> 01:51:13,646
You can see l couldn't do no
different, can't you?

1801
01:51:15,116 --> 01:51:16,574
Neeley, he don't like school.

1802
01:51:16,825 --> 01:51:18,615
lf he'd quit, he'd never go back
again.

1803
01:51:19,368 --> 01:51:21,692
But you, no matter what happens,
you'd find a way to go back,

1804
01:51:21,952 --> 01:51:25,035
you'd fight to go back.
You can see that, can't you?

1805
01:51:26,496 --> 01:51:30,573
l... Yes, Mama.

1806
01:51:32,081 --> 01:51:34,653
Read me something, Francie.
- Yes, Mama.

1807
01:51:35,833 --> 01:51:37,243
Read me one of your compositions.

1808
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,326
l ain't never read any of your
compositions.

1809
01:51:39,585 --> 01:51:41,244
lùs on my conscience.

1810
01:51:46,378 --> 01:51:48,500
l tore all those up.

1811
01:51:48,754 --> 01:51:52,122
No, you didn't. Not all of'em.

1812
01:51:54,507 --> 01:51:57,210
Can't l read you Shakespeare? lùs
much better.

1813
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:01,173
Read "Twas on a Night Like This".

1814
01:52:01,426 --> 01:52:05,801
l'd like to have something pretty on
my mind. Sit by the candle.

1815
01:52:15,432 --> 01:52:18,301
"The moon shines bright,
in such a night as this,

1816
01:52:18,558 --> 01:52:21,261
when the sweet wind did
gently kiss the trees..."

1817
01:52:21,518 --> 01:52:24,683
Say, did you ever find out who
Troylis was and Cressida?

1818
01:52:24,936 --> 01:52:26,346
Yes, Mama, Troylis was...

1819
01:52:26,604 --> 01:52:30,301
Some other day when l got time. Read
me one of your compositions now.

1820
01:52:30,563 --> 01:52:32,305
You won't like them, Mama.

1821
01:52:32,564 --> 01:52:33,843
You thought about them, and you
worked on them,

1822
01:52:34,106 --> 01:52:37,224
and you got good marks on them.
Get 'em, l said.

1823
01:53:11,621 --> 01:53:17,987
Sit here. Go on.

1824
01:53:21,417 --> 01:53:29,241
lùs called, "The Man People Loved".
Please don't make me do this, Mama.

1825
01:53:29,503 --> 01:53:30,285
Read it.

1826
01:53:34,047 --> 01:53:38,790
"Perhaps many people might have said
of him that he was a failure.

1827
01:53:39,049 --> 01:53:42,462
lt is true that he had no gift for
making money,

1828
01:53:42,716 --> 01:53:46,926
but he had a gift for laughter,
and for making people love him.

1829
01:53:47,761 --> 01:53:51,377
He had the gift of making you feel
proud to walk down the street with him

1830
01:53:51,637 --> 01:53:54,127
He had nothing to give but himself.

1831
01:53:54,389 --> 01:53:57,422
But of this he gave generously, like
a king.

1832
01:53:57,681 --> 01:54:02,056
Like a king. Thaùs like it was.

1833
01:54:02,308 --> 01:54:05,473
Walking down the street with him,
you always felt like that.

1834
01:54:06,477 --> 01:54:08,184
Did you, Mama.

1835
01:54:08,894 --> 01:54:11,727
You were real smart to write it down
like that, Francie.

1836
01:54:11,978 --> 01:54:21,641
Thaùs like it was. Francie, l miss
him so much!

1837
01:54:21,899 --> 01:54:28,776
lf the baby's a boy, we'll call him
Johnny. Where's Sissy?

1838
01:54:29,027 --> 01:54:36,438
Neeley's been gone a long time. Wipe
my face.

1839
01:54:36,697 --> 01:54:38,238
No, don't let go of my hand.

1840
01:54:40,324 --> 01:54:44,567
lf iùs a girl, we'll call her Annie
Lorrie.

1841
01:54:44,825 --> 01:54:48,821
Remember that tune he played? You
ought to have piano lessons.

1842
01:54:49,077 --> 01:54:50,654
l'll see if l can manage.

1843
01:54:50,911 --> 01:54:53,910
You won't forget to dust the piano,
will you Francie?

1844
01:54:54,163 --> 01:54:56,651
Who'll cry for me like that if l
died?

1845
01:54:56,913 --> 01:55:00,327
l never did a wrong thing in my life,
but it ain't enough.

1846
01:55:00,581 --> 01:55:04,992
Oh! Sissy, l didn't mean to be hard,
like you said!

1847
01:55:06,126 --> 01:55:10,038
lf Johnny were here, he could go to
your graduation, and l'd go to

1848
01:55:10,294 --> 01:55:14,040
Neeley's, but l, l can't tear myself
into two pieces.

1849
01:55:14,295 --> 01:55:21,539
How am l going to do both? Oh!
Where are you, Francie!

1850
01:55:21,799 --> 01:55:22,829
l'm here, Mama!

1851
01:55:23,091 --> 01:55:34,425
Oh, you're such a comfort to me.
l'm so tired. Leave me sleep now.

1852
01:55:50,393 --> 01:55:51,306
You'd better start some water
boiling,

1853
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:52,141
she's going to be needing it.

1854
01:55:52,394 --> 01:55:53,176
We'll call you if there's anything
we need.

1855
01:55:53,436 --> 01:55:54,978
l thought you were never coming,
Sissy.

1856
01:55:55,229 --> 01:55:57,682
Come on, you quit worrying, now.

1857
01:56:23,657 --> 01:56:29,157
The baby is here and the Mama is
doing good. She's asleep.

1858
01:56:29,409 --> 01:56:31,981
A small baby sister it is.

1859
01:56:38,621 --> 01:56:43,363
Annie Lorrie. Papa would have liked
that.

1860
01:56:50,209 --> 01:56:51,537
Where's Grandma?

1861
01:56:56,211 --> 01:56:58,617
l've got her in a front seat so she
won't miss a thing.

1862
01:56:59,587 --> 01:57:01,579
lsn't your classroom around here
somewhere?

1863
01:57:01,838 --> 01:57:02,834
Yes, but...

1864
01:57:03,089 --> 01:57:04,120
How about giving me a peek?

1865
01:57:04,381 --> 01:57:06,586
Wouldn't hurt me none seeing a
little more places like that.

1866
01:57:11,133 --> 01:57:12,924
Hey, Francie, you forgot your
flowers.

1867
01:57:13,176 --> 01:57:15,582
They aren't mine, l'm not carrying
flowers today.

1868
01:57:16,386 --> 01:57:18,377
Some of the girls, their family
sends them flowers.

1869
01:57:18,637 --> 01:57:20,924
They're on your desk, lamb. Better
go see.

1870
01:57:24,348 --> 01:57:26,634
Oh well, l have to get my things,
anyway.

1871
01:57:42,271 --> 01:57:47,061
"To Francie on graduation day, love
from Papa."

1872
01:58:01,946 --> 01:58:03,487
He gave me the money to buy them way
before Christmas.

1873
01:58:03,738 --> 01:58:08,564
To make sure he had it, he said.
Then he wrote out the card.

1874
01:58:20,328 --> 01:58:21,443
Come on, Kid.

1875
01:58:25,081 --> 01:58:27,320
Let it go, baby, there ain't a soul
around here. Let it go.

1876
01:58:37,544 --> 01:58:38,872
Frances Nolan.

1877
01:58:50,882 --> 01:58:53,454
Well, sir, l don't think Grandma
said one word the whole time.

1878
01:58:53,717 --> 01:58:55,459
And from the looks of her when l put
her on the street car, she'll

1879
01:58:55,717 --> 01:58:58,919
probably ride clear out to Coney
lsland and never know the difference.

1880
01:59:00,011 --> 01:59:00,792
Heaven knows what she would have
been like

1881
01:59:01,053 --> 01:59:02,677
if she'd got to both graduations.

1882
01:59:02,929 --> 01:59:06,794
Looks to me like it was a pretty
fine day. How's your soda, Francie?

1883
01:59:07,056 --> 01:59:08,514
Pineapple's not as good as chocolate.

1884
01:59:08,765 --> 01:59:09,879
Then whaùd you order it for?

1885
01:59:10,139 --> 01:59:12,261
Because l'm up to the "Ps". Next
time l'll try raspberry next.

1886
01:59:12,516 --> 01:59:14,721
There's something to that idea. Try
everything once.

1887
01:59:14,975 --> 01:59:15,757
Sissy!

1888
01:59:16,017 --> 01:59:19,633
And a dime for you, my boy. This is
a special occasion. Thank you.

1889
01:59:19,894 --> 01:59:21,222
He don't know how special it is.

1890
01:59:21,478 --> 01:59:23,766
Two diplomas in the Nolan family all
in one day.

1891
01:59:24,021 --> 01:59:27,850
Mama, l've got a nickel if you want
to leave it. People do.

1892
01:59:28,105 --> 01:59:30,013
lùs going to be all right, Francie.

1893
01:59:30,273 --> 01:59:34,138
And you know something, these ain't
gonna be the last diplomas, either.

1894
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,181
l don't know how we're gonna work it,

1895
01:59:35,442 --> 01:59:37,149
but we're gonna find
some way for you and...

1896
01:59:37,401 --> 01:59:39,274
Hi, Neeley, how ya doing?

1897
01:59:39,527 --> 01:59:42,063
Okay, l got out of jail.

1898
01:59:42,319 --> 01:59:46,267
Say, wasn't that you l saw working
behind that bat the other day?

1899
01:59:46,529 --> 01:59:47,608
Well, yeah, but...

1900
01:59:47,863 --> 01:59:49,736
Hey, you were pretty good.
You know what?

1901
01:59:50,031 --> 01:59:51,822
l can come out and give you some
pointers some time.

1902
01:59:52,074 --> 01:59:52,939
Honest?

1903
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:55,486
Sure l will. That is, if your mom
don't mind.

1904
01:59:55,741 --> 01:59:57,365
Naw, she don't mind. You mean it?

1905
01:59:57,617 --> 02:00:02,193
Sure. Well, l'll see you on the lot.

1906
02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:06,326
Maybe you better ask your ma, you
know,

1907
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:08,287
l don't want to do anything
she wouldn't want me to.

1908
02:00:08,539 --> 02:00:09,782
Naw, she won't care.

1909
02:00:10,038 --> 02:00:11,698
Maybe you'd better ask her yourself,
just to make sure.

1910
02:00:11,956 --> 02:00:16,781
l'm Neeley's aunt, this is his ma,
but thaùs his sister.

1911
02:00:17,042 --> 02:00:18,998
Whaùs-your name, big boy?

1912
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:20,990
Hershel Knudsen.

1913
02:00:21,252 --> 02:00:24,950
Mr. Knudsen, l'd like for you to
meet my niece, Miss Francie Nolan.

1914
02:00:27,004 --> 02:00:28,201
Pleased to meet you.

1915
02:00:28,463 --> 02:00:29,707
Hello.

1916
02:00:32,298 --> 02:00:34,752
Nice night if it don't rain. Sit
down, Hershel.

1917
02:00:40,718 --> 02:00:43,337
Ah, doing anything tomorrow
afternoon, Miss Nolan?

1918
02:00:43,594 --> 02:00:44,589
lùs Saturday.

1919
02:00:44,844 --> 02:00:47,132
l don't know. Why?

1920
02:00:47,387 --> 02:00:51,300
Well, there's a swell picture. "Pill
Hard". Maybe you'd like to go.

1921
02:00:51,556 --> 02:00:52,551
Who with?

1922
02:00:52,807 --> 02:00:53,636
Me.

1923
02:01:03,019 --> 02:01:07,559
Oh. Well, l might be busy. l'll let
you know.

1924
02:01:07,813 --> 02:01:09,720
Well, l'll come around and see.

1925
02:01:09,979 --> 02:01:12,386
Hey, l thought we was going to play
ball tomorrow.

1926
02:01:12,647 --> 02:01:15,730
Well, we can do that anytime. Sure,
there's lots of time.

1927
02:01:15,982 --> 02:01:17,262
Ah, come on, Hersh.

1928
02:01:17,524 --> 02:01:19,397
Well, l'll be seeing you, Miss Nolan.

1929
02:01:23,694 --> 02:01:25,068
Hey, mushy!

1930
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:27,808
l'm proud of you, chickapea. You
handled him just fine.

1931
02:01:28,070 --> 02:01:29,184
lt was the hair that done it.

1932
02:01:29,446 --> 02:01:32,729
Well, l hate to bust this party up,
but them babies gotta be fed.

1933
02:01:32,989 --> 02:01:34,862
Steve'll be needing a little
something too.

1934
02:01:35,115 --> 02:01:36,739
Three hours with the both of them.

1935
02:01:36,991 --> 02:01:38,698
Thirty out of fifty.

1936
02:01:38,950 --> 02:01:39,862
Keep the change.

1937
02:01:40,116 --> 02:01:40,816
Thank you.

1938
02:01:41,075 --> 02:01:42,818
Why, Katie Nolan.

1939
02:01:43,076 --> 02:01:44,071
l don't care.

1940
02:01:44,327 --> 02:01:48,192
There's times when feeling good and
things like that is important.

1941
02:01:48,454 --> 02:01:50,113
l don't care.

1942
02:01:56,623 --> 02:01:58,615
will you carry my flowers for me,
Mama?

1943
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:14,290
Ah, ya missed it, Steve.

1944
02:02:14,547 --> 02:02:15,709
Ah, hello, handsome.

1945
02:02:17,382 --> 02:02:20,381
Ah, l'm begging your pardon, Mrs.
Nolan. l just happened to drop in.

1946
02:02:20,633 --> 02:02:23,467
And your brother in law here seemed
to be needing a little help.

1947
02:02:23,718 --> 02:02:27,298
And the baby didn't seem to mind, so
l hope l'm not intruding.

1948
02:02:29,511 --> 02:02:31,384
Well, not at all, Mr. McShane.

1949
02:02:35,139 --> 02:02:39,679
You sit right down. We're going home.
Come along, Steve.

1950
02:02:43,184 --> 02:02:44,381
l'll take her, Mr. McShane.

1951
02:02:44,643 --> 02:02:45,673
Oh, l'd like it if you'd leave her.

1952
02:02:45,935 --> 02:02:48,389
Her and me has got to be good
friends.

1953
02:02:52,146 --> 02:02:54,018
Well, l wish you didn't have to
hurry.

1954
02:02:54,271 --> 02:02:55,599
Gotta get this family of mine home.

1955
02:02:55,855 --> 02:02:57,681
Steve's got to deliver milk to a lot
of those babies

1956
02:02:57,939 --> 02:02:59,481
that like that bottled kind.

1957
02:03:01,233 --> 02:03:03,058
...Hmm. You don't want frown like
that, Kate.

1958
02:03:03,317 --> 02:03:07,941
The fellas don't like that at all.
Good bye, kids. So long, Mac.

1959
02:03:08,194 --> 02:03:10,268
Oh, so long, Mrs. Edwards.

1960
02:03:10,528 --> 02:03:11,690
Thank you, Aunt Sissy.

1961
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:16,855
Bye, Mac.

1962
02:03:17,114 --> 02:03:18,311
Mr. Edwards, good bye.

1963
02:03:22,533 --> 02:03:27,690
Well... Well, l will take the
baby from you, Mr. McShane.

1964
02:03:36,289 --> 02:03:44,160
Mrs. Nolan, likely you've been
wondering why l came here tonight.

1965
02:03:45,667 --> 02:03:47,077
Well, let your wondering be over
because

1966
02:03:47,335 --> 02:03:49,326
l came here on a personal matter.

1967
02:03:49,586 --> 02:03:50,249
Mama, should l go...

1968
02:03:50,503 --> 02:03:52,541
No, no. Don't be leaving, children.

1969
02:03:52,795 --> 02:03:57,086
My conversation will be concerning
you as well as your mother.

1970
02:04:02,549 --> 02:04:04,208
Mrs. Nolan, l feel

1971
02:04:04,467 --> 02:04:08,047
that there's no disrespect in
my speaking my mind at this time.

1972
02:04:08,302 --> 02:04:14,799
And l feel that a decent time has
elapsed since the passing of

1973
02:04:15,054 --> 02:04:17,378
Mrs. McShane, God rest her soul.

1974
02:04:19,514 --> 02:04:22,597
Oh, l didn't know, Mr. McShane,
l'm sorry.

1975
02:04:22,849 --> 02:04:24,591
Well, l said nothing, Mrs. Nolan,

1976
02:04:24,849 --> 02:04:27,303
because it was near the time
of your own bereavement.

1977
02:04:27,559 --> 02:04:28,637
And l didn't wish to...

1978
02:04:29,643 --> 02:04:34,801
Well, l know that iùs barely six
months since your own husband too,

1979
02:04:35,062 --> 02:04:37,730
left this world, rest his soul.

1980
02:04:39,397 --> 02:04:43,606
But, when you feel, a decent
interval has elapsed,

1981
02:04:43,857 --> 02:04:47,520
l'm asking to keep company with you,
Catherine Nolan,

1982
02:04:47,776 --> 02:04:52,850
with the object of a wedding,
when a decent time has elapsed.

1983
02:04:56,237 --> 02:05:01,857
And for my part, l'll be glad to
keep company with you, Mr. McShane,

1984
02:05:02,115 --> 02:05:04,948
not for the help you can give us,
because

1985
02:05:05,199 --> 02:05:09,988
we know we can manage some way,
but,

1986
02:05:10,242 --> 02:05:13,195
because you're a good man,
Mr. McShane.

1987
02:05:19,622 --> 02:05:27,032
Ah, and there's ah, there's one more
thing. Their father was a fine man.

1988
02:05:28,208 --> 02:05:30,745
And l'd have no wish to be trying
take his place.

1989
02:05:32,085 --> 02:05:37,705
lt would be more my intention to be
like a real good friend.

1990
02:05:40,546 --> 02:05:42,917
As the eldest, would you be
approving?

1991
02:05:46,799 --> 02:05:48,458
Yes, Mr. McShane.

1992
02:05:53,051 --> 02:05:57,343
l was thinking, it wouldn't be right
for me to ask the two eldest to

1993
02:05:57,595 --> 02:05:58,757
take my name.

1994
02:05:59,012 --> 02:06:04,004
But the little one, the one who has
never looked on her father.

1995
02:06:04,265 --> 02:06:07,881
Could you be thinking of letting me
legally adopt her?

1996
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:15,096
lf that time comes. The child shall
have your name.

1997
02:06:19,604 --> 02:06:22,603
And now l'm wondering if
l could smoke my pipe.

1998
02:06:22,855 --> 02:06:26,304
You could have smoked any time,
Mr. McShane.

1999
02:06:26,565 --> 02:06:31,722
l didn't want to take any privileges
before l was entitled to them.

2000
02:06:36,611 --> 02:06:37,890
Help me put her to bed, Neeley.
- Why?

2001
02:06:38,153 --> 02:06:40,477
Fix the blankets.

2002
02:06:50,116 --> 02:06:51,907
l'll be heating up the coffee now.

2003
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:58,196
will you join me in a cup,
Mr. McShane?

2004
02:06:59,870 --> 02:07:01,612
Oh, thank you, Catherine, l will.

2005
02:07:04,747 --> 02:07:06,573
Annie Lorrie McShane.

2006
02:07:07,789 --> 02:07:08,654
Yeah.

2007
02:07:08,915 --> 02:07:11,037
She'll never have the hard times we
had, will she?

2008
02:07:11,291 --> 02:07:13,579
She'll never have the fun, either.

2009
02:07:13,834 --> 02:07:17,082
We did have fun, when we were young,
didn't we?

2010
02:07:17,336 --> 02:07:18,248
Yeah.

2011
02:07:18,503 --> 02:07:21,455
Remember the olden days when we
collected junk?

2012
02:07:21,713 --> 02:07:23,170
Poor Lorrie.

2013
02:07:23,421 --> 02:07:30,582
Neeley, look at the tree, iùs
growing again, just like Papa said.

2014
02:07:30,841 --> 02:07:36,508
l feel kind of sad, like we're
saying good bye to something.

2015
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:38,134
Yeah.

2016
02:07:41,261 --> 02:07:45,885
Neeley, am l good looking?

2017
02:07:46,139 --> 02:07:47,798
oh, whaùs eating you?

2018
02:07:48,056 --> 02:07:49,882
No, honest, Neeley. l want to know.

2019
02:07:55,517 --> 02:07:56,430
You'll pass.

2020
02:07:56,684 --> 02:07:59,637
You're sweet, Neeley.

2021
02:07:59,894 --> 02:08:02,135
Oh, cut the mush.
