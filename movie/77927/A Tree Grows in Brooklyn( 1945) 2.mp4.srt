1
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:51,608
This will be the last of them now,
Francie.

2
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:54,008
ls Dad home, Mom? can we go now?

3
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,008
Not so loud, Keeley, do you want to
wake your Papa up?

4
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:59,608
Gosh, Francie, ain't you through
with them old dishes yet?

5
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:00,608
She'll only be a minute.

6
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:02,208
My, l wish he was as anxious to get

7
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:04,608
going on school mornings as he is on
Saturdays.

8
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:05,808
Papa was late last night.

9
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:07,608
Yeah l was dead asleep when he come
in, l guess.

10
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:10,608
He said if people didn't like to
make speeches so much at dinners,

11
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:12,208
waiters could spend more time with
their families.

12
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:15,808
Oh, it wasn't much of a job, l guess.
Them club dinners don't tip much.

13
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:19,208
ls that all, Mama?

14
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:21,408
Yes, yes. Go on, l'll dry 'em.

15
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,408
Don't look like you got much there
this week.

16
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:25,208
One of these days Mrs. Gabish

17
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,608
is going to throw away that
old wash boiler of hers.

18
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:30,008
Carney will pay us plenty for the
copper bottom off of that.

19
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,608
He won't pay you any more than he
have to.

20
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:33,408
You watch him on that weighing now.

21
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:34,208
Yes'm.

22
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:36,208
Oh, parents ought to have a day
thas like

23
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:38,008
Saturday is for kids. Go on.

24
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,008
Maybe if l start in the lower hall
and scrub my way up today

25
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,208
ill make something
special out of it for me.

26
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:44,008
Keep an eye on him, Francie.

27
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:45,608
Come on!
- Yes, Mama!

28
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:08,608
They done good today. Come on.

29
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:11,608
Man throws cigarette
package in gutter,

30
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:15,408
Francie blocks boy
from diving for it.

31
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:21,608
Neeley!

32
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,608
All right, pickers!

33
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:29,408
Come on!

34
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:35,608
Now look, stand on the same
side as him when he weighs

35
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,408
it so's he can reach it.

36
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:40,008
And don't forget to stand there
after he pays you.

37
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,008
You forgot that last time.
And a penny's a penny ain't it?

38
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:45,808
Well, l guess l know what it is.
Well all right then.

39
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:50,608
Three cents!

40
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:52,208
Look, that stuff's worth more than
that!

41
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:54,008
Shut up! l say what things are worth
around here!

42
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,208
Who's next?

43
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:00,008
Oh, hello little girl! Come on.

44
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,408
Shut up! Shut up!

45
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:23,808
You done fine.
Nine cents. Three, five, nine...

46
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:30,408
There you are. An extra penny
because you're a nice little girl.

47
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:34,008
Thas better. Gosh! l wish Carney
liked to pinch boys.

48
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:35,408
Nine and my pinching penny.

49
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,208
Thirty nine.

50
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:39,808
ls a pen setter!
- Ah! No! lt ain't so!

51
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:49,608
Let me! ...Twenty six!...
A pen wiper.

52
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:31,208
Something you want, little girl?

53
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:34,608
l'm merely looking, thank you.
l have a right. l have money.

54
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:42,608
Step on a crack...
break your mother's back...

55
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:45,408
Here she comes, Jesus!

56
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:59,208
Neeley! Neeley, we gotta go home!

57
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:00,408
Beat it!

58
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:04,208
Mama said.
- Mama said.

59
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:06,408
l'll beat you!

60
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:07,608
Oh, no you won't!

61
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:12,008
Heaven's sake! ls it that late
already?

62
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:16,008
Well, l guess l 'll just let these
stairs go'til later.

63
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:16,808
Four cents, Mom!

64
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:19,008
Well, thas pretty good. Dump the
bucket, Keeley.

65
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:19,608
Mama, can l...

66
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,408
No. Dump the bucket and bring it...

67
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:25,208
Today's the day for the insurance
collector and l sure don't want him

68
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,408
to catch me looking like this.

69
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:28,208
Hot, ain't it?

70
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:31,008
Yeah. But Christmas will be here
before you know it.

71
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:32,808
Got enough troubles without worrying
about that.

72
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:34,608
How's your sister today, Henry?

73
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:35,408
Poorly, thank you.

74
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:43,808
Well, hello, Flossie dear.

75
00:06:44,808 --> 00:06:47,008
Hello, Mrs. Nolan, don't you notice
something?

76
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,208
well, you look like you was feeling
better, much better,

77
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,208
don't she Francie?

78
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:52,608
No, l don't! l don't!

79
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,608
Heat up the coffee while
l fix supper.

80
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,208
Right there.

81
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:17,208
Mom!

82
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,408
Yes, Neeley?

83
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:21,008
Mom, if there was a rule about
something,

84
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,208
that doesn't mean you couldn't do
something else once in a while...

85
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,208
Neeley, you cannot have any of those
pennies to buy an ice cream cone.

86
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:30,408
They go in the bank the same as
usual. Bring them in here, Neeley.

87
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:34,808
Half of everything we get goes into
that bank.

88
00:07:34,808 --> 00:07:36,008
Thas the way it is and thas the
way is going to be.

89
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,408
Now put them in there.

90
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:40,608
Gosh, l bet we got about a hundred
dollars in that old bank by now.

91
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:42,408
Nine's more like it.

92
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:46,208
Mama! Mama! They're cutting the tree.

93
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,808
Oh, thas too bad.

94
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:56,208
That was kind of pretty there with
the bird sitting in it sometimes.

95
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:58,008
Papa loved that tree.

96
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,008
Aw, quit mooning over it. lt got in
the way of the washing.

97
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,208
Tree ain't gonna put no pennies in
the bank.

98
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:10,208
Mr. Barker. Get out the good cup
and saucer and give it a wipe.

99
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,008
And Francie,

100
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,608
you can stay in the room if you want
to while Mr. Barker is here.

101
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:17,208
How do you do, Mr. Barker?

102
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:18,208
How do you do, Francie?

103
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,808
Mommy is temporarily detained but
will join you directly.

104
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,408
Hello, Neeley.
- Hello.

105
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:24,408
l might fancy you get manners right
out of the book.

106
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:27,608
And company or no company,
Mrs. Nolan always looks the lady.

107
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,808
You should see some of my people.

108
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,008
Even ladies with husbands that work
steady.

109
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,008
Won't you go. into the parlor and
have a cup of coffee?

110
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,608
That l will. And your hospitality is
very kind, Mrs. Nolan.

111
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,608
Well, old man Gentry is off to jail
again.

112
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,008
Oh, thas too bad.

113
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,008
But she's keeping up his insurance,
just the same.

114
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,608
And here's ours. Ten cents for me,
ten cents for Mr. Nolan,

115
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,208
a nickel for each of the
children.

116
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:50,608
And you'll never regret it, Mrs.
Nolan.

117
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:53,408
A fine funeral for every member of
the family, heaven forbid.

118
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:55,808
And now your weekly receipts,
Mrs. Nolan.

119
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:59,008
Now, there's one party, not very far
from here, l wouldn't like to say who

120
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,608
that didn't get any receipts
this week.

121
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,208
And naming no names, l will say that
is a family that the angel of

122
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:07,008
death has marked on his invitation
list, heaven forbid.

123
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,208
Henny says his sister's got one foot
in the grave.

124
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:11,008
Neeley!

125
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,808
lll mean problems for you, most
likely. And thank you, Francie.

126
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:15,008
Well, thas what people get,

127
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,408
wasting good money to give her
dresses instead of insurance.

128
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:20,408
Dresses thall last longer than she
will.

129
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:22,808
All depends on what folks thinks is
important.

130
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:25,008
But Papa says that...
- Thas right, Mr. Barker,

131
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,208
it all depends on what folks
thinks is important.

132
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,408
Oh, and how is Mr. Nolan? ls he
working or not working?

133
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:34,608
Some tell me one thing, some another.
Of course, l don't listen.

134
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,408
Mr. Nolan being a singing waiter,
Mr. Barker,

135
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:39,808
and what you might call an
artist, his work don't come steady

136
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:40,808
like other people.

137
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:43,008
But l'm sure you'll remember when
you talk to folks

138
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,808
that the Nolans have always paid
their insurance on the dot.

139
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:47,808
Oh, you surely don't think l go
around spreading gossip

140
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:49,408
about my clients, Mrs. Nolan

141
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:52,208
Oh, sure not. And how's my mother,
Mr. Barker?

142
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:54,808
ln the prime, Mrs. Nolan,
as fine as can be.

143
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:56,608
And she says to tell you she'll be
over...

144
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:59,608
oh, over tonight same as usual.

145
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:04,208
And, l trust you're pleased with the
news about your sister?

146
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,008
Well, just what news do you mean, Mr.
Barker?

147
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,808
Oh, well she must be saving it to
surprise with tonight

148
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,408
when the family's all here together.

149
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:14,208
l'd take it kindly if you told me
what you mean.

150
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:18,208
Well, l trot around, same as usual,
to collect her weekly dime

151
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,408
and what do you think happens?

152
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:22,008
Sell, sir, she gives me two dimes.

153
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:23,808
Yes, sir, she's done it again.

154
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,608
She's got herself a brand new
husband.

155
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:27,808
Oh, no.

156
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:30,008
Well, now, l suppose you mean about
her still being married.

157
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,808
l don't mind saying, l had the same
thought myself.

158
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:34,408
But, l'm sure it must be all right.

159
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:36,408
She must have made some arrangement.

160
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:39,208
l'm quite sure she did, Mr. Barker.
l'm sure that anything...

161
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:40,608
Does she call this one Bill too?

162
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,408
You children run along now and do
the marketing.

163
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:44,608
Go on, take some money
from the cup...

164
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:46,008
Oh, but Mom, l want to hear about...

165
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,808
Take the money from the cup and get
a five cent soup bone off of Haslin.

166
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:49,808
Don't get the chopped meat off him,
though.

167
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:52,608
He grinds it behind closed doors,
and heaven only knows.

168
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:53,808
Go to Werner's for the meat.

169
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:56,408
Ask for round steak, chopped,
ten cents worth.

170
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:58,408
And don't let him give it to you off
the plate.

171
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,608
And ask him to chop it in.

172
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:04,008
And then just at the last ask for a
piece of suet to fry it with.

173
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,808
But he won't always do that, Mama.

174
00:11:05,808 --> 00:11:08,008
Tell him your Mama said.
And then go for the bread.

175
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,408
ls Saturday, Mama, and...

176
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:11,808
All right, ask for a nice pie,
not too crushed. Now, go on.

177
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:14,008
But, Mama, we know Aunt
Sissy's been married before!

178
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,208
Thas not...
- Sure. l can remember two Uncle Bills.

179
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:17,608
Thas nothing for you to talk about.

180
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:19,408
Now run along now and get things
done.

181
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,408
You got no right, Mr. Barker,

182
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:28,008
to be carrying tales about
my sister as though.

183
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,608
there were something wrong.

184
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:34,208
She may be funny some ways, but she
wouldn't do nothing wrong.

185
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,408
So, l'd like it if you didn't talk
to people like it was.

186
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:40,008
Strike nee dead if l'd ever think of
mentioning it to anyone but you...

187
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,408
Yeah, sure, l know.

188
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:45,808
Well, you might as well go on now
and tell me what you do know.

189
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:48,808
No point in my being the only one
that don't hear it.

190
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,808
Well...

191
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,208
Ten cents worth of round steak, do
you want it ground?

192
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:54,008
No, thank you.
- You sure?

193
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,808
lt wasn't twenty minutes ago l
ground that whole plate full fresh.

194
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:58,008
No, thank you.

195
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,208
Oh, l forgot, now. My Mama wants it
ground.

196
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,008
You don't tell me.

197
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,808
And she said to chop that in with it.

198
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:16,008
She did?

199
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,408
And a piece of suet to fry it with
Mama said.

200
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:28,608
Sweet jumping chrystophers.

201
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:40,208
You know? Mama thinks we don't know
anything.

202
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:42,608
Yeah, she acts like we were kids or
something.

203
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:45,008
l bet she has a fight with Aunt
Sissy tonight.

204
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,208
ls got something to do with men
liking Aunt Sissy too much.

205
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,608
Well, Papa says we oughta make
everybody like us.

206
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:52,208
l guess maybe ladies shouldn't.

207
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:55,208
Maybe Aunt Sissy wouldn't have
changed husbands too much if any of

208
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,008
her babies would have lived.
She's crazy about babies.

209
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,208
Look who's talking about babies.
A lot you know.

210
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,408
l know as much as you do.

211
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:03,808
You don't know nothing.

212
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:06,008
You think you're so smart.
Boys make me sick.

213
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,808
Well what do you think girls make
people?

214
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:08,608
Here she comes!

215
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:24,608
Six loaves!

216
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:26,408
And a pie, not too crushed.

217
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:29,808
Breaïs fine.

218
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,008
l wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't
more than three days old.

219
00:13:32,008 --> 00:13:33,608
ls that all, Mom? Can we go now?

220
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:34,608
Yes, you're free.

221
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:40,808
Where's the fire?

222
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:42,608
There's a scout for the Brooklyns
tomorrow.

223
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:43,808
They're looking for a catcher.

224
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:45,208
Where are you going?

225
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,408
Oh, no place much.

226
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,208
Well, don't go dream-walking,
crossing the street.

227
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:09,408
T... U... Burton:
"Anatomy of Melancholy".

228
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:24,408
Burton: "Anatomy of Melancholy"

229
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:37,408
Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy"?
Are you sure you want this?

230
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:38,408
Yes, ma'am.

231
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,408
Don't you think is a trifle over
your head?

232
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:41,208
Yes, ma'am.

233
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:42,608
Then why did you select it?

234
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:46,608
Well, l've read all the authors
beginning with "A",

235
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:49,608
and all the "Bs" down to Burton.
ls next.

236
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:52,608
You mean you're trying to read your
way straight through the library?

237
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,008
Yes, ma'am.

238
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,808
But, a book like this, you'll only
be confused.

239
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,808
Please, l want to read clear through
the alphabet.

240
00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,808
l want to know everything in the
world.

241
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:07,808
Well, all right. Only, do something
for me, won't you?

242
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:09,008
Take another book too. Here:

243
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:14,008
"When Knighthood Was in
Flower". Just for fun. ls Saturday.

244
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,608
l'll have a headache thinking about
you wrestling with

245
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:18,408
"The Anatomy of Melancholy"
all weekend.

246
00:15:18,608 --> 00:15:20,208
Will you?

247
00:15:20,408 --> 00:15:22,208
Yes, ma'am.

248
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:35,008
A little more to the left,
Mr. Crackenbach.

249
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,408
You think l want to see me clothes
hanging with your wash up there!

250
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:42,008
Don't you forget to fix mine,
Mr. Crackenbach!

251
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,608
Maybe you'd like to come up here and
fix it yourselves.

252
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:47,008
And thas just what you'll be doing
if you don't shut up!

253
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,408
Mr. Crackenbachl...

254
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:16,408
...a wheelbarrow, through streets
broad and narrow, crying cockles

255
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,008
and mussels alive alive oh.

256
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:19,608
l won! l won!

257
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,008
Well, now, l wouldn't be too sure
about that if l was you.

258
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,208
But l did. l got it open before you
finished and thas the rule.

259
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:26,408
But l came up one flight two steps
at a time before l remembered.

260
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:27,608
Don't that make a difference?

261
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:28,408
No, sir. The rules say that

262
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,008
And in a manner of speaking, you
never did stop me at all,

263
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:31,808
because my heart kept right
on singing.

264
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,408
Papa, you're joking.

265
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,808
Well, l guess l'll let you get away
with it this time, Prima Donna.

266
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:37,408
And where's your beautiful Mama?

267
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:37,808
Finishing the hall.

268
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,008
She must be on the top floor or
she'd have heard you.

269
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,208
Well, in that case, why aren't you
getting busy?

270
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:44,008
Why aren't you laying out my
clothes?

271
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:47,608
Oh, Papa, you always make fun. You
know you haven't any more clothes.

272
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,408
Haven't any more clothes, huh?
Whas this?

273
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,808
A tie.
- And this?

274
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:52,008
A dickie.
- And this?

275
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,608
An apron.
- Well, them's clothes, ain't they?

276
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:55,208
And you'd better be getting that
apron ironed too.

277
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:57,208
Oh, Papa, you've got a job for
tonight?

278
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:58,208
You see the palm of that hand?

279
00:16:58,408 --> 00:16:59,608
Thas right where l got the world
tonight.

280
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:00,608
Where's the job, Papa?

281
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:01,808
Klompers. A big wedding party.

282
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:04,808
And you know something, Prima Donna?
There'll be plenty of tips.

283
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:06,208
singing or waiting?
- Both.

284
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:09,208
Oh, maybe tonighll be it. Maybe
tonight he'll be there.

285
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:10,408
The impresario.

286
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:12,808
And he'll hear you sing, and he'll
put you on the stage!

287
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:14,208
And why not? Ain't l the Brooklyn
Thrush?

288
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:15,808
Oh, Papa!

289
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:19,008
And now you'd better be getting my
apron ironed.

290
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:20,808
Have it in a jiffy, Papa. The
coffee's on.

291
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:26,208
Thas my Prima Donna. Early one
morning, l heard a maiden singing.

292
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:28,608
Ear... Pst! Pst!

293
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:32,008
Oh, Papa, l can't sing.

294
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,808
Come on, now, you're holding up the
singing!

295
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:37,808
"Oh, don't deceive me, oh, don't you
leave me."

296
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,208
And better singing l never did hear.

297
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,208
l love to iron for you, Papa.

298
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:43,008
You know, something?

299
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,408
A day like this is just like
somebody gave you a present.

300
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:47,208
Everything just right.

301
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:50,408
l wonder what people did before they
invented coffee.

302
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:54,008
Oh, this sure could be a fine world,
if...

303
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:58,008
Hey, you know something, Prima
Donna?

304
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:00,008
You're going to make somebody a
mighty fine wife, some day.

305
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,408
Oh, Papa.

306
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:05,408
And mighty pretty, too. That is, if
your nose doesn't grow crooked.

307
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:08,208
Could it really? Honest?

308
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:11,608
Oh, no! ls the prettiest nose in
all Brooklyn.

309
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:13,608
Oh, Papa, it isn't.
- who says it isn't?

310
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:15,808
You just tell me who said it and
l'll take care of 'em.

311
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:17,408
Papa, you're crazy!

312
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:18,608
And you know something else?

313
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:20,208
You're not going to be ironing like
this when that impresario

314
00:18:20,408 --> 00:18:21,008
comes along.

315
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,008
Things are going to be different
around here, you wait and see!

316
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,008
Yes, Papa.

317
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:26,608
Hey, whas the wish you wish the
most when our ship comes sailing in?

318
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:28,808
Well, it already came true.

319
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,808
What is it? Come on and tell me.

320
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:36,208
Well, l wished that when you came
home today, you wouldn't be sick.

321
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:42,808
Oh, who told you to call it "sick"
baby?

322
00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:46,408
Ah, you shouldn't waste your wishes
on things like that!

323
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:50,408
You should be saving 'em, for a silk
dress or something.

324
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:52,208
Haven't you got a better wish than
that?

325
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:54,008
Well...
- Come on!

326
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:56,808
Well, l hope Mama won't be too mad
with Aunt Sissy.

327
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:58,608
What about Aunt Sissy?

328
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:03,008
She's gone and got herself another
husband. Again!

329
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:08,408
No! Oh, oh, no! Gee, if there isn't
a woman for you!

330
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:10,408
Hey, what did -what did your Manna
say?

331
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,408
Well, she didn't like it.
- l can imagine that.

332
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:18,208
Couldn't you say something to her?
Not to be too mad to Aunt Sissy?

333
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:20,608
That l could, Prima Donna, and that
l will.

334
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:22,008
Oh, thank you, Papa.

335
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:27,208
Now, haven't you got just one little
wish for yourself? Just one wish?

336
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:29,008
Just for you.

337
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:33,208
Well... Did you see it, Papa?
- What?

338
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,408
Out the window. Our tree. They've
killed it!

339
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:42,408
Well, would you look at that now?

340
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,608
They didn't have any right to kill
it, did they, Papa?

341
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:49,408
Oh now, wait a minute. They didn't
kill it.

342
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:51,008
Why they couldn't kill that tree.

343
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,008
Honest?

344
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,008
Oh, why sure, baby.

345
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,808
Don't tell me that tree's gonna lay
down and die that easy.

346
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:59,208
Look at that tree, see where is
coming from?

347
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,808
Right up out of the cement.
Didn't nobody plant it.

348
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:04,608
lt didn't ask the cement could it
grow.

349
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:05,808
lt just couldn't help growing so
much it

350
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:07,408
pushed that old cement right
out of the way.

351
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:09,408
Why, when you're busting with
something like that,

352
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,808
can't anybody help it.

353
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:15,408
Like... Like that little old bird
right up there. Listen to him.

354
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,208
He didn't ask anybody could he sing,

355
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:23,208
and he certainly didn't take
any lessons.

356
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:26,608
He's so full of singing, is just
got to bust out someplace.

357
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,808
Why they could cut that old tree
right down to the ground

358
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:31,408
and a root would push up
someplace else in the cement.

359
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,408
You wait till Spring, Prima Donna
and you'll see.

360
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:38,008
Well, this ain't winning the family
bread, huh?

361
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:45,008
Come on, ain't you got one nice
little wish just for yourself?

362
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:50,608
No, Papa. l just...
- Just what?

363
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:53,608
l just love you so much, Papa.

364
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:59,008
Well, what do you know.

365
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:05,208
Listen, if l make a lot of tips
tonight, you know what l'm gonna do?

366
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,608
What Papa?

367
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:10,608
l'm gonna put two bucks on the nose
of a horse l know is running Monday.

368
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:13,408
And l'll win ten. Then l'll put it
on another horse.

369
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:17,408
And if l use my head, and l'm lucky,
l'll run it up to five hundred bucks.

370
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:20,008
Then you know what l'm gonna do?
- What Papa?

371
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:26,408
l'm gonna take you on a trip. Just
you and me, on a regular train.

372
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:29,008
Maybe we'll go down south and see
the cotton.

373
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,008
You know, down where then cotton
blossoms blow?

374
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:36,608
"Way down upon the Swannee River...

375
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:42,408
Far, far away..." You're a nice girl,
baby.

376
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:45,008
come on, we'll go up and tell your
Mama the news about my job.

377
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:53,608
Anybody seen Johnny Nolan's wife?

378
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:56,408
Johnny? You all right?

379
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,608
And why not?

380
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:00,208
Ain't l married to the most
beautiful lady in all Williamsburg

381
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:01,008
Brooklyn?

382
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:04,208
Well, you're shouting so that
they'll hear you over to Manhattan.

383
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,808
Now, don't you get fresh with me
tonight, Mrs. Nolan.

384
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,808
lt happens l'm working. Klomper's.
Big wedding party.

385
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:09,408
Well, l thought you looked kinda
extra dressy.

386
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:11,608
l guess you won't get home until the
sun comes up.

387
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:12,208
The later the better.

388
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:15,208
The more tips, the more fine silk
stockings for my wife's pretty legs.

389
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,208
Oh, silk stocking's is just what l
need.

390
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:18,808
Now, just wait a minute, Mrs. Nolan.

391
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:20,408
Ain't you gonna give me a kiss for
luck?

392
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:21,808
oh, the whole house is looking.

393
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,208
Sure, l know they's looking, but who
cares.

394
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,208
This is the finest job l've had in
months.

395
00:22:25,408 --> 00:22:26,808
Maybe l'll get more from tonight.

396
00:22:27,008 --> 00:22:28,808
Well, you'd better get on with it.
Good jobs don't wait.

397
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:31,408
But the job's no good without your
kissing me.

398
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,808
Well, you still got away with you,
Johnny Nolan.

399
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:42,808
Now go on, get out of here.
Before you know it,

400
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:45,008
the folks at that wedding
will be an old married couple.

401
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,408
Before you know it, l won't go at
all.

402
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:48,208
There's ain't the only wedding that
counts.

403
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:51,008
Take your hat arid get out of here
before someone else cops that job.

404
00:22:52,408 --> 00:22:58,008
Our, ah, Francie tells me that
Sissy's gone and done it again.

405
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:04,008
Well, maybe he's a nice fella.
Don't be too hard on her, huh?

406
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,808
They was all nice fellas. Beat it?
now, Johnny.

407
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:09,808
Well, thas just a sample, madam.

408
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:12,408
lf you like my stock, drop me a card
and l'll be back again.

409
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:13,608
Good evening!

410
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:22,208
Well, would you look at our
beautiful princess tonight

411
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,608
in a brand-new gown.

412
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:25,808
ls made out of silk.

413
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:29,208
Silk? Oh, don't you tell me that.

414
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,008
This dress is made out of flower
petals and birïs wings

415
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:34,608
and a little old piece of cloud.

416
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:42,408
Anybody can tell that. Oh, good
evening, Mr. Spencer.

417
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:43,008
Working tonight, Johnny?

418
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:47,008
Yeah, big wedding party. Oh, good
evening Miss Lizzie, Miss Maggie.

419
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,608
You're looking fine today,
indeed you are.

420
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:53,808
Thank you, ladies. Here comes the
Bride. HereGood evening, ladies.

421
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:54,208
Good evening!

422
00:23:54,408 --> 00:24:01,408
Allow me, Princess.
Hi, Mr. Ching.

423
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:02,408
Hello.

424
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,008
Was did Mom say about Aunt Sissy?

425
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,608
Now don't worry about it,
everything's going to be all right.

426
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:12,008
Your Aunt Sissy's a fine woman,
Francie. Look at them things!...

427
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:17,208
There's no use talking. Some day l'm
gonna buy you them skates.

428
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,408
Mama says not to be too late, Papa.

429
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:22,008
Look, God invented time and when he
invents something,

430
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,208
there's always plenty of it.

431
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:25,008
There's your car, Papa.

432
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,608
Boy, look at them knives!

433
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,408
Mama says time is money.

434
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:31,008
Well, l guess he wasn't worrying
much about money right then.

435
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,408
There's your car, Papa.

436
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:34,208
Well, l might as well catch it.

437
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,208
Supper's ready.

438
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,608
Y Hey, am l hungry!

439
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,208
And when weren't you hungry?
- Mama?

440
00:24:56,408 --> 00:24:58,208
Yes, Francie.
- what does white mean?

441
00:24:58,408 --> 00:25:01,608
Oh, just white, l guess. What do you
mean, what does it mean?

442
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:03,208
Neeley, sit down at your place.

443
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:05,208
Well, why do girls always wear it
when they're married,

444
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,808
and when they're confirmed
and when they graduate?

445
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:08,808
Why does it always have to be white?

446
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,208
Just one of those things somebody
started. Lots of things like that.

447
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,208
Will l have a white dress when l
graduate?

448
00:25:14,408 --> 00:25:16,808
We'll see. Neeley will probably have
to have shoes by that time.

449
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:17,808
But, Mama!

450
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:18,408
Well, talk to him about it.

451
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:21,208
lf you can get him to quit coming
through the soles of his shoes...

452
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:22,608
Just because he's a boy.

453
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:26,008
All right, Mama, l will gladly do
without so my little brother can be

454
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,408
happy with new shoes.

455
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,408
Little brother my eye...

456
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:32,008
That will do. Francie, you read too
much.

457
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:35,008
Hey, Aunt Sissy!
- What did you bring us?

458
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:37,008
l brought myself chickapeas, isn't
that enough?

459
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,808
Oh, and a couple of magazines from
the dentist.

460
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:40,808
Whas he need 'em for, or me
either?

461
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:43,408
l can't read like my educated little
niece here.

462
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,408
Hello, Katie, my darling.

463
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:48,008
Good evening, sissy.

464
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:55,808
Well, you look fine, Katie.

465
00:25:56,008 --> 00:25:58,808
Yeah, l look fine.

466
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:02,808
Who spilled the beans. Oh, l forgot,
it was old Barker's day here.

467
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:05,808
Where's Johnny? l was kinda counting
on him to be in my corner.

468
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:07,208
Oh, sure. You and Johnny.

469
00:26:07,408 --> 00:26:07,808
Oh, look, Katie.

470
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:09,808
l didn't tell you because l wanted
to bring Bill around.

471
00:26:10,008 --> 00:26:13,008
But, l couldn't. He's home sleeping.
He's a milk man, you see.

472
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:17,608
Ah, listen. You're gonna wish me
happiness, ain't you?

473
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:21,408
Naturally, l'm going to wish you
happiness this time too.

474
00:26:21,408 --> 00:26:23,608
Oh, golly, why can't you skip to the
part where you forgive me?

475
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:25,008
You're going to before you're
through.

476
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,608
You know l'll get around you in the
end.

477
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:29,208
Why can't you just be human now and
get it over with? Huh?

478
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:31,608
Oh, there ain't no one like you to
get around

479
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:32,608
a person in the whole world.

480
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:35,808
Unless is Johnny. You're in time
for pie. Go on now and sit down.

481
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:39,008
Well, thas more like it. Thas my
kid sister talking.

482
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:40,408
Just coffee for me.

483
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:42,408
l gotta get home soon and fix
breakfast for Bill.

484
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:44,608
Breakfast? At night?
- Yeah. Ain't it a riot?

485
00:26:44,808 --> 00:26:46,608
We sleep all day long with the
shades pulled down

486
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:47,408
to keep out the sun.

487
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:50,008
And the window shut to keep out the
noise. ls fun.

488
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,408
You don't live like nobody else.

489
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:52,608
No, you sure don't.

490
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:55,408
Easy on the whip kid. Now, wait til
you meet my Bill.

491
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:56,008
You and him will be...

492
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:58,408
Wouldn't you marry nobody if they
wasn't named Bill, Aunt Sis?

493
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:00,408
She might not remember them if they
wasn't.

494
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:04,408
Oh, Bill's got some other names.
Steve, l think it is.

495
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:05,608
But l always like Bill.

496
00:27:05,808 --> 00:27:08,208
A good man's name with no stuck up
about it.

497
00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:10,608
Oh, you'll be crazy about him, Katie.

498
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:13,208
Yeah? But the question is, how will
him and you get along?

499
00:27:13,408 --> 00:27:17,008
Oh, is wrong, Sissy, l mean, the
others...

500
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:17,808
The others was wrong.

501
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:20,408
Whas right about keeping on with a
guy you don't love each other any more?

502
00:27:20,408 --> 00:27:21,608
But it ain't as easy as that!

503
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,408
l think Aunt Sissy's right about
when love is dead.

504
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:27,208
Now look what you started.

505
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:29,008
lt ain't nothing to talk about in
front of them.

506
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:32,608
Every time you come here you fill
their heads with...

507
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:37,008
Go on downstairs for a while kids.

508
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,808
Your Mama's got a spanking up her
sleeve and

509
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:40,208
she ain't gonna feel
right until somebody gets it.

510
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,408
Might as well get it over with...

511
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:46,608
oh, you don't want to frown like
that, snuggle puff.

512
00:27:46,608 --> 00:27:48,808
The fellas don't go for that at all.

513
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,608
All right, kid, les have it. The
works.

514
00:27:58,808 --> 00:27:59,808
l'm a disgrace.

515
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:00,808
You don't know what to do with me.

516
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:02,808
You can hardly face the neighbors
with what they must be saying.

517
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:04,408
l'm old enough to know better.

518
00:28:04,408 --> 00:28:07,208
Go on, get it all off your chest, then
we can make up and forget about it.

519
00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:10,008
Thas right. Talk your way out of
it. You probably will, too.

520
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,008
Whad Mama have to say?

521
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,408
Well, you know Mama,
she don't say much.

522
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,008
Oh, sure, l know Mama.

523
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:16,408
Says that you're bad, only where the
men are concerned but

524
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:19,408
she's good in her heart.
oh, but that ain't it, Sissy.

525
00:28:19,608 --> 00:28:21,408
People got a right to talk, and the
kids are bound to hear,

526
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:23,408
and it ain't right for them.
And you can get in trouble.

527
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:25,208
You ain't real sure what happened.

528
00:28:25,408 --> 00:28:26,808
And there's laws about things like
that...

529
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,008
Katie, so help me, this time is
for keeps.

530
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,008
l ain't even gonna look at another
guy.

531
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,608
And as for the last one, he can't be
alive,

532
00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:35,208
or l would have heard from him.
l've been pretty good.

533
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:38,608
Seven years is a long time to wait
around not being married.

534
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:42,608
They said all you had to wait was
seven years. And l waited.

535
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:44,808
Well, for the life of me, l don't
know what you're trying to talk

536
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,808
yourself into, but l got a feeling
it ain't right.

537
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:49,808
All l know, is it can't be wrong or
l wouldn't feel like l do about it.

538
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:54,008
l'm dumb, sure, but l know this much:
lf l feel bad about something,

539
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,208
is wrong.

540
00:28:55,408 --> 00:29:00,608
lf l feel good, is right. You
wouldn't get it, Katie.

541
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:02,208
You've got all the breaks
l've never had.

542
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:06,208
You got the kids, you've got a kid
you're clear overboard about.

543
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:07,008
You're lucky.

544
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:09,808
Yeah, and where does crazy over
somebody get you?

545
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:12,208
lt don't put no pennies in the bank.

546
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:14,608
lt don't buy no clothes for the kids
to go to school in.

547
00:29:15,808 --> 00:29:18,008
Maybe you got it better not sticking
to one guy.

548
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:23,008
l wish sometimes
l wasn't so crazy over him.

549
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:23,608
Hey, Katie.

550
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:25,608
l won't have the kids taking after
him either.

551
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:29,008
Him and those dreamy ways of his l
used to think were so fine.

552
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,208
Not if l got to cut it right out of
their hearts!

553
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:33,008
ls what are you saying?

554
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,008
l don't know.

555
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,608
Yes you do, you're saying plenty.

556
00:29:41,408 --> 00:29:43,008
Whas happened between you and
Johnny?

557
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:46,008
l don't know what l'm saying. l E
don't know whas come over me.

558
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,208
Well, look, hon, is time we found
out.

559
00:29:48,408 --> 00:29:49,808
Sure, we got something to talk about
now.

560
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:50,408
l don't want to talk...

561
00:29:50,608 --> 00:29:52,408
Ah-ah! You're the kid sister, you
listen now.

562
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:55,408
You was awful crazy about Johnny.

563
00:29:55,408 --> 00:29:57,408
Don't tell me, l seen ya.

564
00:29:57,608 --> 00:29:59,408
lt was like every woman wants to be
with a guy.

565
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:03,608
All right. Maybe Johnny didn't turn
out just like you figured.

566
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:06,808
Sure, he drinks and all, and you're
the one who's had to make most of

567
00:30:06,808 --> 00:30:09,608
the living but, but, everybody's got
something.

568
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,408
And you wasn't crazy about Johnny
because he was going be a banker,

569
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:13,808
it was on account of...

570
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:19,408
Well, on account of how he laughed
and how you felt walking down

571
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:20,208
the street holding on to him and
having other women look at you.

572
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:25,808
Aced the way he could, the way he
could talk about things.

573
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:29,208
And the way he has of saying hello
to everybody, like...

574
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:31,608
like he was giving
away something.

575
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:34,808
Thas what you was crazy about,
and that ain't changed!

576
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:37,208
l don't know.

577
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:41,808
Them things couldn't change in
Johnny, even if he tried.

578
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:46,408
He's just different kinda, he always
was.

579
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:49,408
But he ain't changed.

580
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:55,208
lf there's been any changing hon,
maybe is you.

581
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:58,208
You still got all he was crazy over,
ain't you?

582
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:00,808
Yeah.

583
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:02,408
Then thank your lucky stars for what
you got, Katie Nlolan,

584
00:31:02,608 --> 00:31:04,208
and take the rest along with it.

585
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:05,808
And you got a lot, you can take it
from me.

586
00:31:06,008 --> 00:31:06,808
And don't think you haven't.

587
00:31:10,608 --> 00:31:13,408
Well, l mighta known, starting out
to take you apart,

588
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:16,408
l'd wind up with
you making me over.

589
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:22,208
Nice going.
Don't stir yourself, pal. Thank you.

590
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:24,008
Gotta go inside, Alfred.

591
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:25,208
How'd you come out, Aunt Sis?

592
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:28,408
No decision, it was a draw. Your
mom's bark is worse than her bite.

593
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:30,608
Look, tell me something.

594
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:34,808
When Papa's home, l bet, l bet him
and Mama laugh a plenty, don't they?

595
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:36,808
You know, like they always did?

596
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:39,408
Sure. Pop can snake anybody laugh
when he wants to.

597
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:41,208
Except when he's drunk.

598
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,208
Sick, Neeley! Mama said to call it.

599
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,408
Okay, sick then.

600
00:31:44,608 --> 00:31:46,808
Look, hon, l'll tell you what you
can do for me.

601
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:51,208
Do all the laughing you can.
You know, keeps everybody healthy.

602
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:51,808
Okay.

603
00:31:52,008 --> 00:31:54,008
Laughter is the singing of the
angels.

604
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:59,208
You're a funny kid. Head full of all
them things. Kinda like your pop.

605
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,808
She tells lies like Pop too.

606
00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:01,808
He does not tell lies!

607
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:03,808
Well, l don't know what you call
them.

608
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:06,008
Time out! Had enough battling to
last me for today.

609
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,008
Where'd you get the skates?

610
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,408
Oh, they aren't ours. Papa said he'd
get us some though.

611
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:11,808
Oh, he didn't mean it, he just said
that.

612
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:13,808
He did too mean it, Neeley, Nolan,
and

613
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:17,408
Easy now! Kinda like your pop,
don't you hon?

614
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:20,208
He does mean it, doesn't he, Aunt
Sissy:?

615
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:22,808
Sure he means it. He means it,
every word.

616
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:27,408
But, well you know,
sometimes things happen.

617
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:31,608
But it kinda ain't his fault.
l tell you what.

618
00:32:31,608 --> 00:32:34,008
Les make up like Johnny gave you
them skates like he said.

619
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,208
And they're yours.
Ain't gonna hurt nobody.

620
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,008
Oh, Aunt Sissy

621
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,408
No sense in those things standing
around, nobody using them. Come on...

622
00:32:41,808 --> 00:32:45,808
Here we go. Easy now.
ls that fun?

623
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:48,008
Can l put them on next, Aunt Sissy?

624
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:48,608
Sure you can.

625
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:50,808
Mom! Mom! Mom! You come back here!

626
00:32:51,008 --> 00:32:53,408
You bring back my daughter's skates!

627
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:55,608
You was the one that put them kids
up to it!

628
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,408
Easy now, nobody's hurt, we only
borrowed them.

629
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,008
She's not going off with them, Effie.

630
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,008
Don't you dare take up with that
woman, like that you...

631
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,208
You poor little guy, do you have to
put up with that all the time?

632
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:07,008
Hey, Officer! Come on over here,
now this woman here she tried to...

633
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,608
Easy, easy... Take it easy.

634
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:09,808
Oh, l'm sure glad you came along,
handsome,

635
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:11,608
you look like you could
whip a bunch of women into line.

636
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:14,208
Well, thas fine, but now suppose
somebody tells me

637
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,608
what all the excitemens about.

638
00:33:15,808 --> 00:33:18,008
Look, she tried to steal my little
girl's skates.

639
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:19,008
She tried to grab her...

640
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,808
We only borrowed them for just a
minute, honest.

641
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:21,208
Thas right.

642
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,408
There wasn't nobody using them and a
little fun and frolic

643
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:25,008
on a Saturday never hurt nobody.

644
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,008
Bet you know all about that don't
you?

645
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,008
lf you think you're gonna get out of
it, making eyes at the law...

646
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,608
l don't know what the worlïs coming
to!

647
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,808
Get back a little bit, buddy, huh?

648
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:38,008
This lady is my sister, she didn't
mean any harm.

649
00:33:38,408 --> 00:33:39,808
l'm quite sure she didn't.

650
00:33:43,408 --> 00:33:46,008
Ah, well... As far as l can see
there's been no harm done.

651
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,808
Now, just break it up, run along, go
to your homes.

652
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:52,808
Go on, you too. Go on, buddy, run
along.

653
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,808
Ah, now suppose l see you women to
your home.

654
00:33:57,808 --> 00:33:59,208
Thanks, handsome.

655
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:09,608
My sister's always trying to be
funny, officer.

656
00:34:09,808 --> 00:34:11,408
She don't mean nothing by it.

657
00:34:12,408 --> 00:34:15,008
l'd like you to know, this is the
first time that of my of my family

658
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:16,808
ever got in trouble in the street.

659
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,408
...And l'll see to it that it don't
happen again.

660
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:25,808
l guess l know a lady when
l see one ma'am.

661
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:27,808
l'm glad l've been of service to you,
ma'am.

662
00:34:29,008 --> 00:34:30,808
He sure take a shine to you, Katie.

663
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,208
Go on, who'd look at me.

664
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,608
He would.

665
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,608
Funny, sometimes you kinda forget
you are a woman.

666
00:34:39,008 --> 00:34:40,408
He wasn't going to arrest us, Mama.

667
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:42,808
Aunt Sissy talked him out of it, and
we got to skate on them anyway,

668
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:44,208
didn't we, Aunt Sissy?

669
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:48,608
You go inside and tell Sheila and
her Mama you're sorry.

670
00:34:48,808 --> 00:34:50,008
Do l have to, Mama?

671
00:34:54,808 --> 00:34:56,808
l don't like to say to you what l'm
going to, Sissy.

672
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,008
Oh, golly, are we going to start
that again?

673
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,208
You're the only sister l got.

674
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:05,208
l don't care what people say about
you for myself.

675
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:07,608
But l got the kids to think about,
and if l don't think about them,

676
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:10,008
nobody will. You're...

677
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,608
Well, you're bad for them,
Sissy.

678
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:15,808
What are you trying to say, kid?

679
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:19,608
l don't want you to come around here
no more.

680
00:35:19,808 --> 00:35:20,808
My minïs made up so don't try to
change

681
00:35:21,008 --> 00:35:23,008
it with any of that
soft talk of yours.

682
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,408
Well, l won't Kate,
not if you mean it.

683
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:34,408
But les keep on talking about you.
Sofs one thing, but harïs another.

684
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:36,008
All right, it ain't nice to be hard.

685
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,008
But my kids is gonna be somebody if

686
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:41,208
l gotta turn into granite
rock to make 'em.

687
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:50,008
Oh, l wish you hadn't said that, kid.
...Bye, Katie.

688
00:35:57,008 --> 00:36:00,608
and Nahal lived nine and twenty
years and begat Terra, and Nahal

689
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:04,408
lived after he begat Terra a hundred
and nineteen years"

690
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:06,008
Boy, thas older than Grandma,
ain't it?

691
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:09,208
"and begat sons and daughters."
Okay, thas the end of the page.

692
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:13,008
Troylis: And dreaming night will
hide our dreams no longer.

693
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:15,808
l would not from thee.
Cressida; Night hath been too brief.

694
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,208
Troylis: be shrew the witch with
venomous..."

695
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:20,808
Oh, that ain't even English!

696
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:23,208
lt is too. Shakespeare wrote the
best English of anybody.

697
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:25,608
All right, you tell me what it means,
you're so smart.

698
00:36:25,608 --> 00:36:28,408
l didn't say l know what it means. l
said l liked it.

699
00:36:28,408 --> 00:36:29,408
Thall do.

700
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:31,808
okay, but l bet you don't know what
it means either.

701
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:33,808
Maybe not, but l do know is good
for you.

702
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:36,008
"...be shrew the witch with venomous
white..."

703
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:37,608
She don't know what it means, Mom
don't know what it means,

704
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:41,008
Grandma can't even read, and gosh
knows, l don't know what it...

705
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,208
Mama, l can't read if he...

706
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,808
Just wasting time every night
reading stuff

707
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:45,808
nobody knows what is all about.

708
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:47,208
Now listen.

709
00:36:47,408 --> 00:36:50,808
Your Aunt Sissy brought that bible
all the way from Sheepshead Bay.

710
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:54,208
And your Papa blew in all his tips
one time on that Shakespeare,

711
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:57,008
cause Grandma said they was the
greatest books and you should read

712
00:36:57,208 --> 00:37:00,008
from them every night. So,
you ain't gonna waste 'em.

713
00:37:00,008 --> 00:37:03,408
l don't know, sometimes it does seem
kind of foolish.

714
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,808
But it might get you somewhere.

715
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:08,208
Might even get you a job someday.
Who can tell?

716
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:11,808
This reading will not stop.
l say this thing.

717
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:17,808
To this new land, your grandfather
and l came, very long ago now.

718
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:21,808
Because we heard that here is
something very good.

719
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:26,608
Hard we worked. Very hard.
But we could not find this thing.

720
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:31,808
For a long time, l do not understand.
And then l know.

721
00:37:31,808 --> 00:37:35,208
When l am old, l know.

722
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:40,608
ln that old country, a child can
rise no higher

723
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:42,408
than his father's state.

724
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:47,208
But here, in this place, each one is
free to go

725
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:50,808
as far as he's good to
make of himself.

726
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:55,808
This way, the child can be better
than their parent

727
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:59,808
and this is the true way
that things grow better.

728
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:04,208
And this has to do something with
the learning,

729
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:11,408
which is here free to all people.
l who am old, missed these things.

730
00:38:11,408 --> 00:38:13,208
My children missed these things.

731
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:17,608
But my children's children shall not
miss it.

732
00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:19,808
This reading shall not stop.

733
00:38:22,608 --> 00:38:31,808
And you, Katie, it is not only for
the job that this is good,

734
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:35,808
but for the true things
inside of us.

735
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:38,608
You don't think well about this.

736
00:38:38,808 --> 00:38:41,408
Nor about what you do with your
sister.

737
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:47,008
You have forgotten to think with
your heart.

738
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:52,208
There is a coldness growing in you,
Katie.

739
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,608
"Be shrew the witch with
venomous white she stays,

740
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:10,008
as tediously as hell, but flies the
grasps of love..."

741
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,208
"ln Dublin's fair city, where girls
are so pretty,

742
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:18,208
l first set my eyes
on Miss Molly Malone.

743
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:23,208
And she'll wheel a wheel barrow,
through streets broad and narrow,

744
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:28,408
crying cockles and mussels alive
alive oh.

745
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:37,408
Alive alive oh, alive, alive oh,
crying cockles and mussels...

746
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,808
ls all right, Mama, l don't think
he's sick.

747
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,808
Alive alive oh, alive alive oh...

748
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:43,408
Papa!

749
00:39:43,808 --> 00:39:45,608
well, what do you know, if it ain't
my beauty.

750
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:51,008
Hey, what are you doing up this
time of night?

751
00:39:51,008 --> 00:39:54,008
Oh, l just made up my mind to wait
up for you.

752
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:56,408
l guess l ain't used to the hours
anymore.

753
00:39:56,808 --> 00:39:58,408
No, leave it, is nice.

754
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:03,208
Go on. Francie, coffee.

755
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,408
ls it something to eat, Papa?

756
00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:06,608
And what else would be coming from a
grand banquet?

757
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:09,008
l got some fresh rolls,

758
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,408
a whole half a broiled
lobster from the shores of Maryland,

759
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:17,808
fried oysters, caviar from far off
sunny Russia,

760
00:40:17,808 --> 00:40:21,008
and cheese from the mountain
passages of la belle France.

761
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:26,808
What do you know about the mountain
passages of France?

762
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:28,408
ls it better coming from there,
Papa?

763
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:29,808
Oh, is supposed to be mighty good.

764
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:32,608
but coming home like this,
l know thas good.

765
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:36,208
Well, les eat it. No reason we
shouldn't have a party of our own.

766
00:40:40,808 --> 00:40:42,208
l'm hungry.

767
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,408
ls that all you got to say to your
Papa?

768
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,408
Hello, Pop.

769
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:48,408
His stomach's like the lrish Sea. No
bottom to it.

770
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:50,208
Mama, your wedding comb.

771
00:40:51,808 --> 00:40:54,008
Well, ain't this a kind of wedding
party?

772
00:40:56,608 --> 00:41:00,008
You bet it is. l wish l coulda
swiped some champagne.

773
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:02,408
Oh, no l don't. Coffee's better.

774
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:06,208
But, look who's telling me l don't
know about those mountain

775
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,008
passages of France.

776
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:07,808
Oh, that.

777
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,608
Yeah, that. lmagine you forgetting.

778
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:13,608
Well, l didn't forget, not exactly.
Only it was a long time ago.

779
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:14,408
What do you think of a Mama that
forgets

780
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:16,008
where she went on her honeymoon?

781
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:17,408
Did you really go there, Mama?

782
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,808
of course not, your Papa's joking.

783
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:21,808
Sure we did. Or just the same as. We
spent our honeymoon in a school.

784
00:41:21,808 --> 00:41:23,208
lt was as big as a palace.

785
00:41:23,408 --> 00:41:25,608
We just worked there nights, the two
of us, cleaning.

786
00:41:25,808 --> 00:41:27,808
lt was right here in Brooklyn before
you was born.

787
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:29,008
That ain't what you told you then.

788
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:31,408
You mean to say that when we was
having our supper there alone,

789
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:34,808
and l used to pull down them maps
and take the teacher's pointer

790
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:36,808
and pick out the places we'd pretend
we was that night.

791
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:38,208
You mean to say we really wasn't
there?

792
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:41,608
You mean you forgot that sunny
France was where we liked the best?

793
00:41:44,008 --> 00:41:45,608
And all the laughing we used to do
there?

794
00:41:45,808 --> 00:41:48,608
You're going to sit right down and
tell me we really wasn't there?

795
00:41:48,808 --> 00:41:51,008
Well, l guess we was kind of at that.

796
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,208
And you're going to tell me l don't
know about them

797
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,008
mountain passages of France.

798
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,608
Katie Nolan, l'm ashamed of you.

799
00:41:55,808 --> 00:41:57,408
Wasn't there nobody in the school
but you, Papa?

800
00:41:57,608 --> 00:41:59,408
No, sir, we had the whole place to
ourselves...

801
00:42:00,008 --> 00:42:02,408
or he'll have you believing
you was in France, too.

802
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:04,008
No, Papa, talk some more.

803
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:05,808
Whas this here stuff?

804
00:42:06,008 --> 00:42:08,408
Caviar. That comes all the way from
Russia. Them's fish eggs.

805
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:09,008
Fish eggs!

806
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:10,408
Yeah.

807
00:42:10,608 --> 00:42:12,208
l never could get it why they like
it myself,

808
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:14,008
except that is hard to get
and costs a lot.

809
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:15,208
And that makes it good, Papa?

810
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,608
What about the Russians? lt ain't
hard for them to get.

811
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:18,608
Do they like it?

812
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:22,608
Well, can you tie that? Now, ain't
we got the smartest kids?

813
00:42:22,808 --> 00:42:24,408
Papa, talk some more.

814
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,008
Tell us all about the party, and
don't leave out anything.

815
00:42:28,408 --> 00:42:34,408
Oh, that can wait. Here... how's
that?

816
00:42:34,408 --> 00:42:36,408
Three dollars. Thera's good wages.

817
00:42:36,608 --> 00:42:37,408
And good tips, too.

818
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:40,408
Papa, start. Was there music, and
did they dance?

819
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:43,408
Aw, your mother's got no time for
all that.

820
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:49,008
You could tell me. You used to.

821
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:54,608
Well, it was kind of nice. Klompers,
their best room.

822
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:56,608
And all fixed up with white flowers.

823
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:59,408
There was flowers on the table,
flowers on the chandelier,

824
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:00,608
and even on the floor.

825
00:43:01,008 --> 00:43:02,408
And here was a great big horseshoe
table,

826
00:43:02,608 --> 00:43:04,008
with lots of people all around.

827
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,008
And right in front, a great big
wedding cake,

828
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,808
it must have been three feet tall.

829
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:09,808
Why didn't you bring home some of
that?

830
00:43:10,008 --> 00:43:10,808
Was the bride pretty?

831
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:13,208
Well, she was maybe not so young,
but the...

832
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:19,008
Oh, sure, she was beautiful, in a
blue dress and all and she had

833
00:43:19,008 --> 00:43:22,808
diamonds on her fingers and in her
ears, and she glittered sort of.

834
00:43:23,008 --> 00:43:26,408
And when she walked, her dress
swished, kind of.

835
00:43:26,608 --> 00:43:29,008
And the champagne just flowed like
water.

836
00:43:29,008 --> 00:43:31,608
The smell of it got all mixed up
with the flowers.

837
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:33,208
And the powder the ladies wore.

838
00:43:33,408 --> 00:43:35,408
And it made a wonderful new perfume
that oh,

839
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:37,608
made you feel good just
to smell it.

840
00:43:37,808 --> 00:43:38,608
Did you sing for 'em Papa?

841
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:39,808
Oh, l was coming to that.

842
00:43:40,008 --> 00:43:44,408
l got three encores for my "Wild
lrish Rose" and everybody clapped

843
00:43:44,408 --> 00:43:47,608
And then l sang "lrish Eyes are
Smiling" four times.

844
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:49,008
Oh, it musve been awful nice.

845
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:52,008
lt was all right, and when it come
time for them to cut the cake, the

846
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:54,808
band played "Kiss me Again", she put
her arms around him and boy

847
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,408
did he look scared.

848
00:43:56,608 --> 00:43:58,208
What was he scared of, Papa?

849
00:43:58,408 --> 00:43:59,008
Huh?

850
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,408
You kids ask too many questions.

851
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:03,808
You heard the story, now go on and
go to bed.

852
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,208
lt must be three o'clock.

853
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:07,208
l got a belly ache.

854
00:44:07,408 --> 00:44:08,208
Well, lay on your right side.

855
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:10,008
Good night, Mom.

856
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,408
Good night, Neeley.
Good night, Francie.

857
00:44:13,608 --> 00:44:16,408
Francie's kind of mad at me,
because, well,

858
00:44:16,608 --> 00:44:18,208
Sissy made a scene
on the street today,

859
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:20,608
and l asked her to stay a...
way.

860
00:44:21,808 --> 00:44:24,608
Papa, wasthere an impresario there?

861
00:44:24,808 --> 00:44:29,208
No, not tonight, Prima Donna. But you
got no call to be mad at your mama.

862
00:44:29,408 --> 00:44:32,608
She's always got a good reason for
what she does.

863
00:44:41,408 --> 00:44:43,008
Good night, Mama.

864
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:46,008
Oh, good night, Francie.

865
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:08,008
Johnny, tell me what else happened
at the party?

866
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:15,008
Well, it was nice, just like l told
you. Awful nice.

867
00:45:15,008 --> 00:45:22,408
Johnny, do you think, l mean,
have l changed a lot?

868
00:45:23,008 --> 00:45:28,408
Changed? Why she couldn't hold a
candle to you. She ain't so hot.

869
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:30,208
l just said that for the kids. No
sir.

870
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:34,608
No, thas not what r mean. What l
mean is, am l getting hard, you know.

871
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:39,408
Oh, now where did you grab onto an
idea like that? Hard?

872
00:45:39,408 --> 00:45:40,008
l don't know!

873
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:43,008
l don't want to be, but well,
there's the kids and all,

874
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,808
and l want to do whas right for
them and may be some times l am

875
00:45:46,008 --> 00:45:47,008
Now, will you stop talking like that.

876
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:48,808
Now, you're prettier than you ever
was.

877
00:45:49,008 --> 00:45:51,408
l almost told that to the whole
bunch down at the party tonight.

878
00:45:51,408 --> 00:45:53,408
l almost said, you ought to see my
bride

879
00:45:53,408 --> 00:45:54,808
thas waiting home
for me at tonight.

880
00:45:55,008 --> 00:45:59,808
And you was waiting, Katie.
That was nice, awful nice.

881
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:02,408
lt was just like it used to be.

882
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:08,008
You told about the party awful nice
tonight, Johnny.

883
00:46:09,608 --> 00:46:12,008
l should have. Waited up more
often, l guess.

884
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:17,608
Aw, it ain't your fault, working
hard like you do.

885
00:46:18,808 --> 00:46:20,008
You know something?

886
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:24,408
l wish l coulïve got you the rest
of that set when when we was married.

887
00:46:24,608 --> 00:46:27,208
The guy said it came all the way
from Spain.

888
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:28,808
What else was in that set, Johnny?

889
00:46:28,808 --> 00:46:30,808
You ain't told me in an awful long
time.

890
00:46:30,808 --> 00:46:32,408
Two little side combs and a locket
on a chain.

891
00:46:33,408 --> 00:46:34,808
And a bracelet you said?

892
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:36,008
Oh, there's no use talking.

893
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:38,808
Some day l'm going to look that guy
up and get you the rest of that set.

894
00:46:38,808 --> 00:46:40,208
Oh, thas nice Johnny, but l don't
need...

895
00:46:40,408 --> 00:46:41,608
No, there's no buts about it,
l mean it.

896
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:44,208
Things are gonna be different around
here.

897
00:46:44,808 --> 00:46:47,408
You ain't gonna be working hard like
you -like you are now.

898
00:46:47,608 --> 00:46:48,608
l don't mind the work, Johnny.

899
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:51,408
No, air. l ain't gonna stand for it.
Look at then pretty hands.

900
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,008
They ain't got no business being in
the water all the time.

901
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:56,208
l'm gonna change a lot of things
around here.

902
00:46:56,408 --> 00:46:58,008
l'm gonna cut out the drinking too.

903
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:00,408
And just to prove it to you,
here's my tip money.

904
00:47:00,608 --> 00:47:03,008
No, keep your tips, Johnny. Take all
a man's money, it ain't right.

905
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,808
And l'm gonna keep on 'em down at
the union headquarters

906
00:47:05,008 --> 00:47:06,008
and make 'em get me some jobs.

907
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,608
Yes, six, tonighs the beginning of
something new.

908
00:47:08,808 --> 00:47:11,008
Oh, you believe me, don't you,
Katie?

909
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,208
Yeah, Johnny, yeah, sure l do.

910
00:47:13,408 --> 00:47:16,208
And l'll be singing all over
Brooklyn, and maybe Manhattan too.

911
00:47:16,408 --> 00:47:18,608
Have you heard Johnny Nolan sing,
they'll say.

912
00:47:18,808 --> 00:47:20,808
And then maybe some day, maybe...

913
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:23,608
Oh, Johnny, stop it! Stop it! Stop
talking!...

914
00:47:33,808 --> 00:47:38,608
You ain't got a chance.
Who are we trying to kid.

915
00:47:43,808 --> 00:47:48,408
Yeah, sure, you're right.
Who am l trying to kid.

916
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,608
l didn't want to hurt you, Johnny.

917
00:47:50,808 --> 00:47:52,808
But, is the truth and l can't
change it.

918
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,808
Yeah. And l could tell you something
else.

919
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:02,008
All that baloney about them encores
tonight.

920
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:05,608
ls just because they was a little
drunk and feeling good.

921
00:48:05,608 --> 00:48:07,208
l wasn't so much.

922
00:48:09,408 --> 00:48:11,608
Thas right, l'll never be able to
change it.

923
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:17,408
Sure you're right,
who am l trying to kid?

924
00:48:36,808 --> 00:48:39,008
Neeley Nolan, you stop that!

925
00:48:39,008 --> 00:48:40,808
Oh, l don't want to wear no old tie!

926
00:48:41,008 --> 00:48:41,808
Mama said.

927
00:48:51,608 --> 00:48:54,208
All right, now, break it up! Break
it up! Run along!

928
00:48:55,408 --> 00:48:57,208
Papa! Les hurry, Papa.

929
00:48:57,808 --> 00:48:59,208
All right now, lad, where do you
live?

930
00:48:59,408 --> 00:49:01,208
l'll take him home, he's my father.

931
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:03,008
Hey, wait, wait a minute, honey.

932
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:06,208
l expect you'd better be running
along to school, hadn't you?

933
00:49:06,408 --> 00:49:07,608
l'll look after him for you.

934
00:49:08,808 --> 00:49:11,208
Now, don't you worry. He ain't in
any trouble.

935
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:14,808
l'll take good care of him. Here, is
this the house?

936
00:49:18,408 --> 00:49:22,608
No, next one. Second floor back.

937
00:49:22,808 --> 00:49:27,408
And if you talk to him, he's always
all right.

938
00:49:27,408 --> 00:49:30,008
Sure, sure, l know, now don't you
fret. You just run along. Huh?

939
00:49:31,008 --> 00:49:33,608
All right, lad, come on.
We'll make it.

940
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:47,608
Alive alive oh, alive alive oh...

941
00:50:00,408 --> 00:50:03,808
Oh, l didn't expect to find you here,
ma'am. ls there anything l can do?

942
00:50:04,008 --> 00:50:05,808
He's my husband,
l can take care of him.

943
00:50:06,608 --> 00:50:09,408
ls all right, Johnny, l'll get you
a nice cup of coffee.

944
00:50:09,408 --> 00:50:13,808
A nice cup of coffee... a nice cup of
coffee.

945
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:17,008
Oh, l just wanted to say,

946
00:50:17,008 --> 00:50:18,808
ma'am that the gentleman
wasn't making no trouble.

947
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:20,408
He just needed a little help.

948
00:50:20,608 --> 00:50:21,608
Here, drink it Johnny.

949
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:23,608
lsn't there anything that l can do?

950
00:50:24,808 --> 00:50:27,008
lf you wasn't you on the beat,
Mr. McShane,

951
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,208
you'd know that Johnny
never makes any trouble.

952
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:32,608
And you'd know that the whole Nolan
family doesn't need anybody's help.

953
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:36,408
l'd thank you, Mr. McShane,
if you'd mind your own business.

954
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,408
Oh, sure, Mrs. Nolan.

955
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:48,408
Beauty is truth through beauty that
is all ye know on earth and all

956
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,808
ye need to know.

957
00:50:50,408 --> 00:50:51,808
Now, class,

958
00:50:51,808 --> 00:50:56,808
Beauty is truth through beauty that
is all

959
00:50:56,808 --> 00:51:01,408
ye know on Earth and all
ye need to know.

960
00:51:02,408 --> 00:51:05,008
Now who knows the name of the meter?
...Frances Nolan?

961
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:06,608
Yes, but...

962
00:51:06,808 --> 00:51:09,008
You can't know but...

963
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:13,608
l only meant to say, l was thinking
about the words, what they mean,

964
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:14,808
and l wondered...

965
00:51:14,808 --> 00:51:17,608
You don't have to know the words,
Frances, just the meter.

966
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:22,008
But if beauty is truth and thas
all ye need, l mean, all you need to

967
00:51:22,008 --> 00:51:24,408
know, then that means that is the
most important thing.

968
00:51:24,608 --> 00:51:31,808
And if a man, i mean if somebody,
spent all his time trying to be that.

969
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:36,608
well is hard to put...
but no matter what else he did, then.

970
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:39,608
Then what, Frances?

971
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:43,008
Then it would be all right.
Wouldn't it?

972
00:51:43,008 --> 00:51:46,808
l'm afraid l don't understand, a
thing you're saying, Frances.

973
00:51:47,008 --> 00:51:48,808
And we're late now with our
arithmetic.

974
00:51:48,808 --> 00:51:50,408
Class will get their arithmetic...

975
00:51:53,008 --> 00:51:56,208
Pop, why don't the Katz and Jamma
kids talk plain English?

976
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:59,408
ls supposed to make it funny.
l guess.

977
00:52:00,008 --> 00:52:02,008
Francie, you've been staring out
that window over half an hour,

978
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:04,008
can't you make up your mind
to do something?

979
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,408
What shall l do?

980
00:52:05,608 --> 00:52:07,608
Well, you used to like to do your
homework Sundays.

981
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,608
Oh, l don't know. l don't like
school as much as l used to.

982
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:13,008
Now you're getting some sense.

983
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:15,208
School is the same this year as it
was last.

984
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:20,208
Mama, you know that big market on
Clancy Street, down the hill?

985
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:21,808
You can't play there, if thas what
you mean,

986
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:23,408
that neighborhooïs expensive.

987
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:27,408
Well, l meant, l mean, well the
other day l passed that

988
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:28,608
way on my way home.

989
00:52:28,808 --> 00:52:31,008
And well, Mom, you know whas just
a couple blocks

990
00:52:31,008 --> 00:52:32,208
away from that market?

991
00:52:32,408 --> 00:52:33,608
Another market, l guess,

992
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,808
and am l supposed to guess whas
two blocks away from there?

993
00:52:36,008 --> 00:52:37,408
Francie why don't you say what you
mean.

994
00:52:38,608 --> 00:52:40,208
l didn't mean anything l guess.

995
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:45,608
Neeley, sometimes l think you make
these holes on purpose.

996
00:52:46,408 --> 00:52:47,208
Papa?

997
00:52:47,408 --> 00:52:48,408
Yes, baby?

998
00:52:48,608 --> 00:52:51,008
You know what l read in a magazine
once?

999
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:52,808
What was it, Francie.

1000
00:52:53,008 --> 00:52:55,608
Well, it said that walking was a
good thing.

1001
00:52:55,808 --> 00:52:58,808
lt said people would look and feel a
lot better if they did more of it.

1002
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:01,608
Walking put rose petals in your
cheeks, it said.

1003
00:53:01,808 --> 00:53:04,008
Then l ought to be a raving beauty
with all them stairs.

1004
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:08,408
That isn't what it meant. lt meant,
well, like on a Sunday.

1005
00:53:08,408 --> 00:53:11,608
People would feel a lot better if
they got out and took a walk or

1006
00:53:11,808 --> 00:53:13,408
something, instead of just sitting
around.

1007
00:53:13,408 --> 00:53:16,208
Francie, l want you to stop talking
around about things like that.

1008
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:19,408
lf you got something to say, just
say it right out. Plain.

1009
00:53:22,008 --> 00:53:27,208
l wasn't going to say anything.
l was just talking about walking.

1010
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:32,808
Well, there's been so much talking
about walking, l think l'll take one.

1011
00:53:34,808 --> 00:53:36,608
You want to go along, Prima Donna?

1012
00:53:36,808 --> 00:53:40,008
Oh, yes, Papa. Sure, Papa.

1013
00:53:43,808 --> 00:53:46,608
Must be pretty special this place
you walk to thas two blocks away

1014
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:48,208
from the market.

1015
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:49,808
This way, Papa.

1016
00:53:54,808 --> 00:53:55,608
ls this it?

1017
00:53:55,808 --> 00:53:57,008
Yes, Papa.

1018
00:53:59,008 --> 00:54:03,408
The school? l don't understand.

1019
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:06,808
lt must be just as nice inside,
don't you think?

1020
00:54:07,008 --> 00:54:08,208
The teachers and all and...

1021
00:54:08,408 --> 00:54:09,808
Well, what are you driving at, baby?

1022
00:54:11,608 --> 00:54:17,008
Bend down, Papa. l wish l could go
tot that school, Papa.

1023
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:26,408
Oh, well, l don't know, baby. ld
be awful nice, but they got rules.

1024
00:54:26,408 --> 00:54:28,208
You gotta go to the school where you
live.

1025
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:32,808
Oh, l know, l didn't really.

1026
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:38,608
Oh, now, wait a minute. Maybe
there's a way.

1027
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,008
ls a free country, ain't it?

1028
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:49,808
School days, school days Hey, maybe
we could move near here.

1029
00:54:49,808 --> 00:54:51,608
Well, now, whoa now, whoa.

1030
00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:55,008
Sometime soon, as soon as our ship
comes in, Prima Donna, you'll see.

1031
00:54:55,008 --> 00:54:58,408
Oh, only by that time l'll

1032
00:54:59,808 --> 00:55:02,008
Oh, you want to go there awful bad
don't you baby?

1033
00:55:03,608 --> 00:55:04,208
Then we're going to find a way!

1034
00:55:04,408 --> 00:55:05,208
Honest?

1035
00:55:06,808 --> 00:55:10,208
Well, now, l gotta turn this over a
little.

1036
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:13,608
Les do some more walking, maybe
is good for thinking too.

1037
00:55:13,608 --> 00:55:20,408
school days, school days... Hey,
that ain't a bad little house.

1038
00:55:20,408 --> 00:55:23,208
How'd you like to live there?
ls got a nice little porch.

1039
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,008
l don't like yellow houses.

1040
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,808
Well, with another coat of paint.

1041
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:32,208
0h, Papa. Thas it.

1042

Yes, sir. Thas it.

1043
00:55:35,608 --> 00:55:36,608
lf we only could.

1044
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,408
Well, why can't we?

1045
00:55:38,608 --> 00:55:40,408
Our luck's bound to change, and the
first thing we'll do is buy this

1046
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:42,208
little house when...

1047
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:44,408
Some day.

1048
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:52,408
Look, as long as we're gonna buy
that house some day, ah,

1049
00:55:52,408 --> 00:55:55,408
why don't we maybe borrow it for now,
like ah...

1050
00:55:55,608 --> 00:55:58,408
We'll make out is ours, then your
address would be...

1051
00:55:58,608 --> 00:56:02,208
98 Hibbert Avenue. Starting right
now.

1052
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:04,408
Then you see? They gotta transfer
you from your old school.

1053
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:05,608
How do you mean, Papa?

1054
00:56:05,808 --> 00:56:06,608
Yes, sir, thas it.

1055
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:09,808
We can say you came here to live
with your aunt, your rich old aunt.

1056
00:56:10,008 --> 00:56:12,808
She's lonesome and she's gonna leave
you all her money.

1057
00:56:13,008 --> 00:56:14,408
Oh, Papa, could we really?

1058
00:56:14,608 --> 00:56:16,008
Sure we could. ls nobody's
business.

1059
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:19,808
Mmm... Sometimes l forget to water
the geraniums, and, ahhhh...

1060
00:56:20,008 --> 00:56:21,208
you ought to hear Auntie scold me.

1061
00:56:21,408 --> 00:56:23,408
Ah, but you gotta put up with all
her crochets,

1062
00:56:23,608 --> 00:56:24,608
after all, you're her heir.

1063
00:56:24,808 --> 00:56:27,408
That little room up there, that
could be mine, couldn't it?

1064
00:56:32,808 --> 00:56:37,408
Or, ah, look Prima Donna, after all,
you know,

1065
00:56:37,408 --> 00:56:40,408
this ain't exactly according
to the rules.

1066
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:41,808
You mean, is wrong?

1067
00:56:42,008 --> 00:56:44,008
No, sir, not by a jug full it ain't
wrong.

1068
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,608
Look, the house is here, we're here
and the school's here.

1069
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:48,608
Now, we wasn't all thrown together
for no reason but,

1070
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,408
we gotta keep it kind of a secret.

1071
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:56,208
You know, you can't tell nobody, and
you gotta be extra good to make up

1072
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,208
for it.

1073
00:56:57,408 --> 00:57:01,608
Oh, l will. Look, there goes Auntie
now, l think.

1074
00:57:03,808 --> 00:57:05,608
Looks like you got an uncle too.

1075
00:57:07,808 --> 00:57:11,008
Now, l'm gonna show you a way to
your new school through a beautiful

1076
00:57:11,008 --> 00:57:12,608
little park, and l know right where
it is.

1077
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:15,008
And you can see the seasons change
when you go.

1078
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:22,608
Bend down, Papa. My cup runneth over.

1079
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:30,808
ls dishonest, thas what it is.

1080
00:57:31,008 --> 00:57:33,208
You're setting the child an awful
bad example.

1081
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,808
Papa said if it doesn't hurt anybody,

1082
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:36,208
and if is not dishonest
in your heart...

1083
00:57:36,408 --> 00:57:37,608
You two and your fancy words.

1084
00:57:38,008 --> 00:57:39,808
How do you spell transfer, Francie?

1085
00:57:39,808 --> 00:57:45,608
T-R-A-N-S-F-E-R.

1086
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,808
l'd rather be shot than do this
arithmetic.

1087
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:49,608
lll come to you, Sonny.

1088
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,008
And another thing, we kept Francie
out of here so she and Neeley could

1089
00:57:52,008 --> 00:57:54,408
be in the same class and you could
look after him.

1090
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:56,408
And here, just the year when they're
getting ready to graduate,

1091
00:57:56,608 --> 00:57:57,608
you go and...

1092
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,608
l tell you, is against the law and
you're making her live a lie and

1093
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:01,208
l won't have you doing it.

1094
00:58:03,008 --> 00:58:04,608
l'm going to do this for her, Katie.

1095
00:58:04,808 --> 00:58:08,008
Maybe is my fault, or not, but
there ain't much l can give her.

1096
00:58:16,408 --> 00:58:18,608
Well, ill make an awful long walk
for your mornings.

1097
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:20,008
l don't mind getting up early.

1098
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,208
And ill be much harder on your
shoes and you won't have dresses '

1099
00:58:22,408 --> 00:58:23,608
like the other children.

1100
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:26,008
l promise to wash down my dress
every single night.

1101
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:27,808
How do you spell "appreciate".
Francie?

1102
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,008
A-P-P...

1103
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:30,008
Wait a minute.

1104
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:36,208
R-E-C-l-A-T-E.

1105
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:39,208
Well, if the principal swallows that
story, and l don't think he will,

1106
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:42,608
l'll see what l can do about making
over that checked dress

1107
00:58:42,608 --> 00:58:43,608
of mine for you.

1108
00:58:54,808 --> 00:58:57,408
Why not, my school's over-crowded as
it is.

1109
00:59:00,008 --> 00:59:01,808
This is Frances Nolan, class.

1110
00:59:01,808 --> 00:59:04,408
l'm sure you'll all make her
welcome to our school.

1111
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:06,608
Now, that will be your desk, Frances.

1112
00:59:26,408 --> 00:59:28,808
Run along, Sonny. l ain't gonna
spill a penny.

1113
00:59:44,408 --> 00:59:45,808
Well, l guess we got everything.

1114
00:59:50,008 --> 00:59:52,608
Neeley, our new fire escape leads
clear up onto the roof.

1115
00:59:52,808 --> 00:59:55,608
Whoever lives on the top floor has
got dibs on the roof.

1116
00:59:55,808 --> 00:59:58,208
ain't doing so well, eh, Mrs. Nolan?

1117
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:02,008
Just moving near the sun. As soon as
we heard Mrs. Waters was vacating,

1118
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,608
we made up our minds.

1119
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,608
l've been waiting to see you, Mrs.
Nolan.

1120
01:00:05,808 --> 01:00:08,008
There's something l've got to ask
you, a favor l...

1121
01:00:08,808 --> 01:00:10,008
l'd better show you.

1122
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:12,208
Hey, look at this thing.

1123
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:15,408
Oh boy, we're sure to get out with a
lot less running up and down that.

1124
01:00:15,608 --> 01:00:17,808
We won't let anybody but us up there.

1125
01:00:18,008 --> 01:00:28,808
ls in here. The late Mr. Waters
gave it to me as a wedding present.

1126
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:32,408
lt won't go down the stairs, and
they want fifteen dollars to move it,

1127
01:00:32,408 --> 01:00:33,408
lowering it out the window.

1128
01:00:33,608 --> 01:00:35,608
Do you mind my leaving it, Mrs.
Nolan?

1129
01:00:35,808 --> 01:00:40,608
lt don't take up much room and some
day when l get the fifteen dollars,

1130
01:00:40,608 --> 01:00:41,808
l'll send back for it.

1131
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:43,408
Why, sure l don't mind, Mrs. Waters.

1132
01:00:43,608 --> 01:00:45,208
Can you play it?

1133
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:48,408
No. Neither one of us could.

1134
01:00:48,408 --> 01:00:52,408
lf it ain't too much trouble, you
could dust it off once in a while,

1135
01:00:52,408 --> 01:00:55,808
and keep the kitchen door open a
little so it won't get cold or damp.

1136
01:00:55,808 --> 01:00:56,808
l sure will.
- Thank you.

1137
01:00:57,008 --> 01:00:59,808
And l hope it won't be long before
you can send back for it.

1138
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:03,808
Have you got the curtains?

1139
01:01:04,008 --> 01:01:05,408
Yes, they're coming.

1140
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:13,408
ls it a... ls that a...

1141
01:01:15,808 --> 01:01:18,608
Yeah, we kept a baby in it about 40
years ago.

1142
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:22,608
Well, l was just wondering, if, if,
if you don't need it, id make a

1143
01:01:22,808 --> 01:01:25,808
nice handy little wash basket and
l'd be happy to give you a quarter

1144
01:01:26,008 --> 01:01:26,608
for it.

1145
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,808
Why sure. My Edgar's kids is even
too old.

1146
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:40,208
Excuse me for asking, Mrs. Nolan,

1147
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:44,408
but it won't really make a
handy wash basket.

1148
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:49,408
Please don't say nothing, l ain't
told nobody yet.

1149
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:55,008
lt ain't always easy when you're
poor. But ill be a blessing to you.

1150
01:01:56,008 --> 01:01:58,608
Yeah, sure. Sure it will.

1151
01:01:58,808 --> 01:02:00,008
But there must be.

1152
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:01,408
l tell you there ain't.

1153
01:02:03,808 --> 01:02:05,808
Good bye, Mrs. Nolan. Good bye.

1154
01:02:06,008 --> 01:02:08,008
Good bye, and thank you very much.

1155
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:12,208
Don't forget, we're supposed to give
him a beer, or the price of one.

1156
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:13,208
Well, l'm done.

1157
01:02:13,608 --> 01:02:14,808
l can't thank you enough, Charlie.

1158
01:02:15,808 --> 01:02:18,408
Always glad to do my customers a
favor, of course.

1159
01:02:18,608 --> 01:02:19,608
Well, we are real grateful.

1160
01:02:20,608 --> 01:02:23,408
lt ain't exactly as if l was in the
regular moving business.

1161
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:26,208
We'll be taking ice from you, same
as usual, once a week.

1162
01:02:27,008 --> 01:02:29,408
Well, good bye.

1163
01:02:29,608 --> 01:02:31,008
Good bye, Charlie. And thanks.

1164
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:33,008
He worked awful hard, Mama.

1165
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,408
We moved up to this flat 'to save
money,

1166
01:02:35,608 --> 01:02:37,608
and we're not gonna start by
throwing dimes away.

1167
01:02:37,608 --> 01:02:40,608
No sir, there ain't a bathtub
anywhere. l looked all over.

1168
01:02:43,608 --> 01:02:45,208
There's the tub, young man.

1169
01:02:45,408 --> 01:02:47,408
Every Wednesday and Saturday, same
as always.

1170
01:02:47,608 --> 01:02:48,808
ls Mr. Barker.

1171
01:02:51,808 --> 01:02:57,208
Well, seems like the Nolans have...
have come up in the world.

1172
01:02:57,008 --> 01:02:59,608
Yes, we're so very, very fond of the
sunshine.

1173
01:02:59,808 --> 01:03:02,808
"ln Dublin's fair city, where girls
are so pretty,

1174
01:03:03,008 --> 01:03:04,408
Run and catch him before he goes to
the old place.

1175
01:03:04,608 --> 01:03:07,808
Mr. Nolan happened to be working
when we found we could make the move.

1176
01:03:08,008 --> 01:03:12,008
Yeah. Smaller than your old flat,
ain't it?

1177
01:03:12,008 --> 01:03:14,008
l'm sorry l can't ask you to sit,
Mr. Barker,

1178
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,608
l ain't even got the coffee
on yet.

1179
01:03:15,808 --> 01:03:17,008
But l got my insurance money handy.

1180
01:03:17,408 --> 01:03:23,008
Suppose you're too busy to listen to
a bit of news, about your sister.

1181
01:03:26,608 --> 01:03:27,808
She, ah, she's gonna have a baby.

1182
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:35,608
Please tell my sister she shouldn't
make herself such a stranger here.

1183
01:03:35,808 --> 01:03:39,008
l shall be very happy to render your
message. Your receipts, Mrs. Nolan.

1184
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:40,408
Be sure to, now, Mr. Barker.

1185
01:03:44,008 --> 01:03:48,008
Good day to you, Mr. Nolan. Well,
l'm not one to spoil a family party.

1186
01:03:48,008 --> 01:03:49,408
l'll be on my way.

1187
01:03:53,408 --> 01:03:55,808
Surprise, Papa. Welcome to your new
home.

1188
01:03:57,408 --> 01:04:00,408
Yeah, it is kind of a surprise, all
right.

1189
01:04:01,808 --> 01:04:04,408
Did you move up here because it was
cheaper, or because l

1190
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:06,408
We have to save where we can,
somebody's got to.

1191
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:08,808
l don't mind the extra stairs.

1192
01:04:20,808 --> 01:04:22,208
We can still see the tree.

1193
01:04:22,408 --> 01:04:25,008
Pop, top floor tenant, the roof is
theirs.

1194
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:28,208
And l ain't gonna let anybody up
there except Kenny Gaddis, because,

1195
01:04:29,008 --> 01:04:30,208
Hey, does Pop know?

1196
01:04:30,608 --> 01:04:32,408
Flossie Gaddis died last night.

1197
01:04:32,608 --> 01:04:36,008
Oh, the poor baby.

1198
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,808
lt was nice that her Mama got her
all those pretty dresses.

1199
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,608
Only now the poor thing will have to
lie in Potter's Field.

1200
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:44,408
But, she did have the dresses.

1201
01:04:47,408 --> 01:04:49,008
You better show your Papa the piano.

1202
01:04:50,608 --> 01:04:53,408
Yeah, you better show me the piano,
Prima Donna.

1203
01:04:55,608 --> 01:04:57,008
The lady that was here left it.

1204
01:05:05,808 --> 01:05:10,408
ls got a nice tone.
ls all right.

1205
01:05:15,408 --> 01:05:20,208
Hey, now that we got it, maybe you
can take some lessons. Naa...

1206
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:36,408
Maxwelton Braes are bonny
where early forms the dew.

1207
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:48,208
And was there that Annie Lorrie gave
me a promise true.

1208
01:05:49,008 --> 01:06:01,208
Gave me a promise true, which ne'er
forget will be,

1209
01:06:02,408 --> 01:06:27,208
and for Bonny Annie Lorrie,
l would lay me down and dee.

1210
01:06:26,808 --> 01:06:31,808
l ain't never heard you sing that
before. ls pretty.

1211
01:06:31,808 --> 01:06:37,808
Maxwelton Braes are bonny, where
early forms the dew.

1212
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:47,408
And was there that Annie Lorrie gave
me a promise true.

1213
01:06:49,008 --> 01:07:01,408
Gave me a promise true,
which ne'er forget will be,

1214
01:07:02,608 --> 01:07:25,608
and for Bonny Annie Lorrie,
l would lay me down and dee.

1215
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:32,608
Well, this is the beginning of a
vacation we've all looked forward to.

1216
01:07:32,608 --> 01:07:35,808
And l'm sure we'll enjoy our
holidays more, knowing we've helped

1217
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:38,008
some unfortunate family who would
have had no Christmas dinner without

1218
01:07:38,008 --> 01:07:40,808
this basket.
And so a Merry...

1219
01:07:41,008 --> 01:07:45,408
Oh, one last thing, this extra pie,
Miss Schilling brought in.

1220
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:49,608
ls little, and a bit crushed, but,
anybody want it?

1221
01:07:49,808 --> 01:07:55,408
My, what well fed boys and girls.
All right, class.

1222
01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:56,408
Miss McDonald?

1223
01:07:56,608 --> 01:07:57,208
Yes, Frances?

1224
01:07:57,608 --> 01:08:00,808
l just remembered. l know a very
unfortunate family.

1225
01:08:01,008 --> 01:08:04,608
They live in a, in a hovel. They
have two children.

1226
01:08:04,808 --> 01:08:07,408
Little golden-haired twins. And
they're all starving.

1227
01:08:07,408 --> 01:08:09,608
The pie will probably save their
lives.

1228
01:08:09,808 --> 01:08:13,208
Well, then you should take the pie
by all means.

1229
01:08:13,408 --> 01:08:15,608
You can come and get it when class
is dismissed.

1230
01:08:15,808 --> 01:08:18,408
Which is right now.
And Merry Christmas to you all.

1231
01:08:27,808 --> 01:08:30,808
That was a very fine Christmas
spirit, Frances.

1232
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:34,608
But it seems like such a tiny pie to
save so many lives.

1233
01:08:34,808 --> 01:08:36,808
Oh, it won't seem small to them,
Miss McDonald.

1234
01:08:37,008 --> 01:08:39,808
Even a little pie can look awful big
if you haven't had much to eat

1235
01:08:40,008 --> 01:08:41,008
for days and days.

1236
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:44,208
l'll have to tell them to eat slowly,
because they eat very fast on an

1237
01:08:44,408 --> 01:08:47,608
empty stomach they'll, they'll...

1238
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:53,408
lt isn't true, is all a lie.
l wanted it for myself.

1239
01:08:53,408 --> 01:08:58,408
l'll stay after school, l'll do
anything, but don't send a note home.

1240
01:08:58,408 --> 01:09:01,208
l'm not going to punish you child,
for being hungry

1241
01:09:01,408 --> 01:09:03,008
or having an imagination.

1242
01:09:04,008 --> 01:09:06,008
You know, thas something very few
people have.

1243
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,608
ls very precious.

1244
01:09:08,408 --> 01:09:11,808
But it can also be dangerous unless
we learn how to use it.

1245
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:19,608
Our everyday lives are real and true,
but all the stories in the world,

1246
01:09:19,608 --> 01:09:23,208
all the music, came out of
someone's imagination.

1247
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:27,608
So, if we tell the truth, and write
the lies,

1248
01:09:27,808 --> 01:09:30,008
then they aren't lies
anymore, they become stories.

1249
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:33,608
Like some of the very nice
compositions you've written, Frances.

1250
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:35,408
Like the one about
my father taking me

1251
01:09:35,408 --> 01:09:37,008
to see the cotton fields
down south?

1252
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:38,808
We didn't really go.

1253
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,008
l rather imagined you didn't.

1254
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:43,808
But don't you think it would be
still better

1255
01:09:43,808 --> 01:09:48,008
if you would write about the things
you really know about

1256
01:09:48,008 --> 01:09:50,408
and then add to them with
your imagination.

1257
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:56,008
Even stories shouldn't be
just, well, pipe dreams.

1258
01:09:56,008 --> 01:10:00,608
Pipe dreamers can be very lovable
people but they don't help anybody.

1259
01:10:00,608 --> 01:10:04,008
But they don't help anybody. Now,
think about it a little.

1260
01:10:04,608 --> 01:10:10,808
And have a Merry Christmas.
And enjoy your pie.

1261
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:15,008
Yes, Miss McDonald.
Thank you, Miss McDonald.

1262
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:25,408
For Goïs sakes. Where've you been?
You were supposed to meet me...

1263
01:10:26,408 --> 01:10:28,808
Neeley, l'm going to be a writer.

1264
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:31,008
All right, but les eat the pie.

1265
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:34,808
Come on, we gotta see about our
Christmas tree.

1266
01:10:34,808 --> 01:10:37,608
Oh, golly, lis still there,
isn't it?

1267
01:10:42,608 --> 01:10:44,408
Yeah, is still here.

1268
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:46,008
He ain't got much time
left to sell it.

1269
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,808
Go on, beat it. You know l ain't
gonna throw 'em til midnight.

1270
01:10:49,008 --> 01:10:50,208
What do you want to do, block the
sidewalk?

1271
01:10:50,608 --> 01:10:51,808
Keep customers out?

1272
01:10:52,008 --> 01:10:53,408
Ah, you don't own the sidewalk!

1273
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:56,208
How about this one, madam?

1274
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:00,808
No, that one's too big.
l want a small one.

1275
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,008
l got just what you want,
come over here, lady.

1276
01:11:04,008 --> 01:11:06,008
Well, now, thas more like it.
Thas the size.

1277
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:09,208
ls awful big to get thrown at you.

1278
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:11,808
Why does he have to throw 'em at us,
anyway?

1279
01:11:12,008 --> 01:11:14,408
Why can't he can't just give 'em to
us, if he can't sell 'em?

1280
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:16,808
lf he just gave 'em away,
everybody'd wait.

1281
01:11:16,808 --> 01:11:23,008
They'd never sell any of 'em.
lt smells good.

1282
01:11:27,808 --> 01:11:28,408
There she goes!

1283
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,608
Hey, l'll do it again!
l stumbled!

1284
01:11:31,808 --> 01:11:32,608
Go on! Beat it! Who's next?

1285
01:11:32,808 --> 01:11:34,008
Come on, give me a chance, l'm next.

1286
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:36,008
All right. Here she goes.

1287
01:11:37,608 --> 01:11:38,408
Got it, didn't l?

1288
01:11:38,608 --> 01:11:43,008
All right, take it. Go home. Now,
who wants to try this one?

1289
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:44,608
Who's man enough for this big one
right here?

1290
01:11:45,008 --> 01:11:47,008
l can take anything you got,
mister. Let her fly...

1291
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:48,608
l'm next! Thas my tree!

1292
01:11:48,808 --> 01:11:50,008
Go on, you're too small! Go home!

1293
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:51,808
Me and my brother, we ain't too
small together.

1294
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:53,608
Spunky huh?

1295
01:11:53,808 --> 01:11:57,008
All right, but if one of you drop,
you're not gonna get the tree.

1296
01:11:59,008 --> 01:11:59,808
There she goes!

1297
01:12:04,808 --> 01:12:06,808
Okay, you got it coming. Go ahead.

1298
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:13,008
Oh, quit worrying about 'em, Katie,
they'll be home pretty quick!

1299
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,608
They ain't old enough to be out this
late.

1300
01:12:14,808 --> 01:12:17,408
Johnny should made 'em tell what
they was up to.

1301
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,208
No telling whas likely to happen
if Francie gets a notion in her head.

1302
01:12:20,408 --> 01:12:21,208
They'll be all right!

1303
01:12:34,408 --> 01:12:38,208
Well, l guess we'd better get on
home. We'll see them tomorrow.

1304
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:39,208
No, don't go!

1305
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:45,608
Hey, Pop! Hey, Mom! Hey, Mom!

1306
01:12:49,008 --> 01:12:49,808
Look!

1307
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:53,808
Holy smoke! Will you look at what
they went and done!

1308
01:12:56,408 --> 01:12:59,608
They're trying to make it Christmas.
Help 'em, kid.

1309
01:13:04,408 --> 01:13:05,408
We got it first!

1310
01:13:05,608 --> 01:13:08,008
Well, sure, l was only wondering if
you couldn't use a little help, huh?

1311
01:13:09,008 --> 01:13:10,208
Come on, come on, come on.

1312
01:13:10,408 --> 01:13:12,208
Well, how would you rustle them
together...

1313
01:13:12,408 --> 01:13:13,008
Look at my face!

1314
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:15,408
Nobody around here ever saw a tree
like that!

1315
01:13:15,608 --> 01:13:17,008
Well, look at my face, if you don't
believe me.

1316
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:19,008
Oh, and l see you got the law on
your side.

1317
01:13:19,008 --> 01:13:21,408
Merry Christmas, Mr. Nolan, and it
looks like you're going to have one.

1318
01:13:21,608 --> 01:13:23,008
Well, the same to you, Mr. McShane,
and thanks.

1319
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:24,408
Merry Christmas, Mr. Nolan.

1320
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:25,808
Merry Christmas, Miss Maggie.

1321
01:13:25,808 --> 01:13:27,008
lsn't this a wonderful Christmas,
papa?

1322
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:30,008
Oh, it is now, Prima Donna. lmagine,
us, having a tree like that.

1323
01:13:30,008 --> 01:13:32,608
And the nicest kids in the world.

1324
01:13:36,008 --> 01:13:37,408
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1325
01:13:37,608 --> 01:13:39,208
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Neeley!...

1326
01:13:39,408 --> 01:13:48,008
Silent night, holy night, all is
calm, all is bright...

1327
01:13:48,008 --> 01:13:48,608
He ain't any older than they are.

1328
01:13:48,808 --> 01:13:59,008
Round yon virgin, mother and child,
Holy lnfant so tender and mild,

1329
01:13:58,808 --> 01:14:07,208
Sleep in Heavenly peace, Sleep in
heavenly peace.

1330
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:12,008
Silent night, holy night...

1331
01:14:20,408 --> 01:14:21,808
Here... Put it up higher, Bill!

1332
01:14:22,008 --> 01:14:23,408
Steve's the name.

1333
01:14:23,608 --> 01:14:24,408
Thas better, Bill.

1334
01:14:24,608 --> 01:14:26,808
Oh, les see, you know it!

1335
01:14:27,008 --> 01:14:29,408
Look at all the fun you can have
scratching.

1336
01:14:31,608 --> 01:14:32,808
Thank you, Mama.

1337
01:14:33,008 --> 01:14:34,608
You know you hate 'era!

1338
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:36,008
They're just fine, Mama!

1339
01:14:42,008 --> 01:14:43,808
l got something for you too, Mama.

1340
01:14:44,408 --> 01:14:48,408
Johnny, it was real nice of your
friend Mr. McGarrity

1341
01:14:48,408 --> 01:14:50,408
to send over those candy
canes for the kids.

1342
01:14:50,608 --> 01:14:51,808
Yeah.

1343
01:14:52,808 --> 01:14:57,008
Here, l made these candle for today.
You got to light it now, is time.

1344
01:14:59,008 --> 01:15:01,208
Merry Christmas, Mama,
from me and Neeley.

1345
01:15:04,408 --> 01:15:07,408
Oh! Oh, is pretty. What is it?

1346
01:15:07,408 --> 01:15:10,008
Rose water and glycerine. You rub it
on your hands.

1347
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:14,408
This is for you, Papa, from me and
Neeley.

1348
01:15:17,408 --> 01:15:22,808
My! l'll quite the thing, won't l?

1349
01:15:22,808 --> 01:15:26,408
l think is silly, but Francie said
Papa's always talking about

1350
01:15:26,408 --> 01:15:27,608
what nice hands you got.

1351
01:15:27,808 --> 01:15:31,408
lt cost a dime but we had a seltzer
bottle top in the junk.

1352
01:15:31,608 --> 01:15:32,208
Are... ah...

1353
01:15:35,608 --> 01:15:38,208
ls a watch fob. ls made out of
shoe laces.

1354
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,408
l wove it on a spool with nails.

1355
01:15:41,808 --> 01:15:46,208
Well, if that ain't about the nicest
thing l ever did see.

1356
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,008
Maybe is kind of silly, you not
having a watch and all...

1357
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:51,608
Well, now madam, we're all out of
mushrooms under glass,

1358
01:15:51,608 --> 01:15:53,208
but l can tell you the time.

1359
01:15:53,408 --> 01:15:56,608
Thas the nicest present l ever did
get, Prima Donna.

1360
01:15:56,808 --> 01:15:59,208
And, ah, thank you too, son.

1361
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:01,808
You're welcome. l guess the shoe
laces was mine.

1362
01:16:03,408 --> 01:16:04,408
lt was silly.

1363
01:16:04,608 --> 01:16:06,008
There ain't nothing silly on
Christmas.

1364
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,808
l, ah... l got a little present here.

1365
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:14,008
Like l was saying, l got...

1366
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:15,208
Merry Christmas, Miss Francie.

1367
01:16:15,408 --> 01:16:17,808
Come on, we're in here.
ls Mr. McShane.

1368
01:16:18,008 --> 01:16:19,008
l hope l'm not intruding.

1369
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,408
Merry Christmas, Mr. McShane.

1370
01:16:20,608 --> 01:16:21,008
Merry Christmas!

1371
01:16:21,408 --> 01:16:23,008
Merry Christmas. l was just ah

1372
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:24,008
Hello, handsome.

1373
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:25,808
Oh, Mrs. Edwards.

1374
01:16:26,008 --> 01:16:29,208
l was just passing and l happened to
see the light still burning.

1375
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:31,408
And l was thinking l'd like
to have a hand in

1376
01:16:31,608 --> 01:16:33,208
decorating that fine
Christmas tree.

1377
01:16:33,408 --> 01:16:35,008
...l see someone's already provided.

1378
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:38,008
Well, we can always use more of 'em,
Mr. McShane. Thank you kindly.

1379
01:16:39,408 --> 01:16:41,208
Won't you come in and have a cup of
coffee with us?

1380
01:16:41,408 --> 01:16:44,808
Oh, thanks, no. Ah, this evening's
for families.

1381
01:16:45,008 --> 01:16:48,608
And, l got to be getting home now,
so, l'll say goodbye and...

1382
01:16:48,808 --> 01:16:50,608
and Merry Christmas to everybody.

1383
01:16:50,608 --> 01:16:52,008
Thank you, Mr. McShane, good night.

1384
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:54,008
That was mighty nice of him.

1385
01:16:54,808 --> 01:16:56,208
Mr. McShane's a fine man.

1386
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,608
He's l think sometimes a lonely man.

1387
01:16:58,808 --> 01:17:02,008
Well, like l was saying, l... l got
something here.

1388
01:17:02,608 --> 01:17:06,208
l mean, l got a present for somebody
that ain't exactly here.

1389
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:10,008
Grandma helped me pick it out. ls
for... you know who.

1390
01:17:10,808 --> 01:17:13,808
Oh, Bill, is beautiful.
Look everybody.

1391
01:17:16,408 --> 01:17:18,808
Oh, Bill, darling, l've never been
so happy.

1392
01:17:19,408 --> 01:17:20,808
l'm going to get some coffee.

1393
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:34,408
Katie?

1394
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:40,408
Yeah.

1395
01:17:41,008 --> 01:17:42,208
l'm glad for you.

1396
01:17:44,608 --> 01:17:47,208
l don't know. l'm scared, l guess.

1397
01:17:47,408 --> 01:17:49,808
You got no call to be. Look how
swell them two are.

1398
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:58,408
Told Johnny yet? Well, maybe
you oughta, it might help him.

1399
01:18:05,808 --> 01:18:07,208
Yeah. You better take the coffee in.

1400
01:18:08,408 --> 01:18:10,608
You're a fine girl, Katie. l never
said any different.

1401
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:34,608
Thas for nothing, Johnny. Except
for being a nice guy.

1402
01:18:37,008 --> 01:18:38,008
Coffee everybody!

1403
01:18:52,208 --> 01:18:53,608
Well, l guess thas about all.

1404
01:18:55,008 --> 01:18:56,608
Johnny, l gotta tell you something.

1405
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:59,608
Maybe it ain't the right time, and
maybe it is.

1406
01:18:59,608 --> 01:19:05,608
The reason l moved us up here, we're
gonna have a baby, Johnny,

1407
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:08,208
thas why l've been scrimping
so much and trying so hard to say.

1408
01:19:10,808 --> 01:19:14,408
well, thas...! . Well, l'm awful
glad, Katie, if you are.

1409
01:19:14,408 --> 01:19:16,008
There's a lot we've got to think
about, Johnny.

1410
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:18,608
Oh, l know, but we'll make out.
Maybe things will be different.

1411
01:19:18,808 --> 01:19:21,808
And we'll have one to grow up with
all over again.

1412
01:19:22,008 --> 01:19:22,808
l got things all figured out.

1413
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:26,608
l ought to be able to work until,
well anyway, April.

1414
01:19:26,808 --> 01:19:28,408
And then Francie'll have to leave
school

1415
01:19:28,608 --> 01:19:29,608
and take out her working papers.

1416
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:32,408
She's young, but with what she can
make, we ought to be able to make out

1417
01:19:32,608 --> 01:19:34,008
Oh, but we can't do that, Katie

1418
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:35,608
l don't like it any better than you
do, Johnny, but l thought

1419
01:19:35,808 --> 01:19:37,608
and l thought, and there
ain't no other way.

1420
01:19:37,808 --> 01:19:40,208
And Johnny, you got to help with
something. She listens to you.

1421
01:19:41,008 --> 01:19:44,208
You gotta quit getting her so all
excited about her school.

1422
01:19:44,408 --> 01:19:47,608
Why can't it be Neeley? He's the boy,
and he don't care like she does.

1423
01:19:47,608 --> 01:19:49,208
Well, maybe thas why.

1424
01:19:49,408 --> 01:19:52,408
Maybe ill do her good to get out
in the world and learn something,

1425
01:19:52,608 --> 01:19:53,008
learn how to take care of herself,

1426
01:19:53,208 --> 01:19:55,008
learn something practical
while she's young.

1427
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:56,208
She's gotta learn some day.

1428
01:19:56,408 --> 01:20:01,808
Well, well, there must be another
way. Oh, l don't know.

1429
01:20:01,808 --> 01:20:03,608
l'll try and swing anything. l'll do
anything.

1430
01:20:03,608 --> 01:20:05,208
We can't count on that, Johnny...

1431
01:20:08,608 --> 01:20:11,208
Don't look at me like that, Johnny,
it ain't my fault!

1432
01:20:15,008 --> 01:20:17,008
Oh, it ain't your fault either,
l guess. l don't know.

1433
01:20:19,608 --> 01:20:22,808
Anyway, one member of the Nolan
family will get to graduate,

1434
01:20:22,808 --> 01:20:24,808
and she come close.
Thas something.

1435
01:20:28,808 --> 01:20:32,008
You'd better put out the light and
les get some rest.

1436
01:20:57,408 --> 01:21:00,008
Oh, l thought you'd be asleep, Prima
Donna.

1437
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:06,808
Ah-ah. l've been thinking. l might
be going to be a writer.

1438
01:21:07,608 --> 01:21:08,808
l've just about decided.

1439
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:13,008
l knew you when you was going to be
a lady fireman.

1440
01:21:13,808 --> 01:21:16,808
Don't joke, Papa. l'm serious.

1441
01:21:17,008 --> 01:21:18,408
All right, l baby.

1442
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:23,808
All l meant was, maybe is better
not to get your heart set...

1443
01:21:24,008 --> 01:21:27,408
on just one thing, in case
something happens.

1444
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:33,408
She said, Miss McDonald, l mean, she
said maybe l could be.

1445
01:21:33,408 --> 01:21:37,008
She said l have imagination.

1446
01:21:37,008 --> 01:21:39,208
Do you think l have, Papa?

1447
01:21:39,408 --> 01:21:41,408
Oh, sure you have, baby.

1448
01:21:41,408 --> 01:21:43,808
Those compositions of yours are sure
fine, but...

1449
01:21:44,008 --> 01:21:45,808
She said l'd have to work hard.

1450
01:21:46,408 --> 01:21:48,408
She said imagination
wasn't any good if

1451
01:21:48,608 --> 01:21:51,208
you were just a pipe
dreamer about it.

1452
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:56,608
You didn't help anybody that way.
Not even yourself, she said.

1453
01:21:56,608 --> 01:22:01,008
Yeah, l see. A pipe dreamer.

1454
01:22:02,408 --> 01:22:07,208
l'm not putting it good like she did.
l wish you could have heard her.

1455
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:08,408
She was wonderful.

1456
01:22:09,608 --> 01:22:12,808
For ever and ever l'll be glad you
helped me go to that school, Papa.

1457
01:22:13,008 --> 01:22:15,208
You kind of like that school, don't
you, baby?

1458
01:22:15,408 --> 01:22:23,008
Yes, oh yes. And she said lots more.
l've been trying to remember.

1459
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:27,408
She said, even if you have
imagination;

1460
01:22:27,608 --> 01:22:29,808
is better to write about
the things you know about

1461
01:22:29,808 --> 01:22:36,008
so they'll be true, and...
and the way things are only.

1462
01:22:35,808 --> 01:22:38,008
Only what, baby?

1463
01:22:38,808 --> 01:22:41,608
Papa, the people in the hall when we
brought up the tree,

1464
01:22:41,808 --> 01:22:44,408
the look on their faces
all friendly and nice.

1465
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:48,208
Why can't people be like that all
the time? Not just on Christmas?

1466
01:22:49,608 --> 01:22:57,808
Well, l guess is because...
Well, l don't know.

1467
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:01,008
Maybe is because Christmas is like
people really

1468
01:23:01,208 --> 01:23:02,608
are and the other part ain't true.

1469
01:23:03,608 --> 01:23:06,208
And with that imagination of yours,
if you think about it hard enough,

1470
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:08,608
you know, like it ought to be.

1471
01:23:08,808 --> 01:23:09,808
But when you get to thinking.

1472
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:13,408
Papa, the people in stories, they
don't just live happily ever after,

1473
01:23:13,608 --> 01:23:14,808
do they?

1474
01:23:15,008 --> 01:23:16,008
No, baby, but...

1475
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:17,008
But the trouble is...

1476
01:23:17,408 --> 01:23:21,208
it doesn't feel good when
you think about things like that.

1477
01:23:22,808 --> 01:23:25,408
l mean, like they really are.

1478
01:23:27,208 --> 01:23:29,408
You better stick out your tongue,
Prima Donna.

1479
01:23:32,808 --> 01:23:37,008
Oh, is just like l thought. You've
got a bad case.

1480
01:23:37,008 --> 01:23:38,408
A very bad case.

1481
01:23:38,808 --> 01:23:40,208
Case of what, Papa?

1482
01:23:40,408 --> 01:23:45,408
A very bad case of growing up.
Thas all it is.

1483
01:23:48,008 --> 01:23:52,808
Oh it ain't fun some times, but,
don't you be afraid.

1484
01:23:52,808 --> 01:23:55,408
l don't want you should ever be
afraid.

1485
01:23:58,608 --> 01:24:00,408
You're so nice, Papa.

1486
01:24:00,808 --> 01:24:03,808
l guess is better if you don't
just stay young all your life.

1487
01:24:03,808 --> 01:24:06,408
lll be much nicer growing up.

1488
01:24:14,008 --> 01:24:16,408
Yeah. And you get to see things
like they really are.

1489
01:24:46,408 --> 01:24:47,808
Good night, baby.

1490
01:24:48,008 --> 01:24:53,408
Good night, Papa. l'm sleepy now.

1491
01:24:53,408 --> 01:24:58,008
Thas fine, baby. Just fine.

1492
01:25:23,408 --> 01:25:24,808
Ain't you coming to bed, Johnny?

1493
01:25:25,008 --> 01:25:27,208
No, l'm going to take a little walk.

1494
01:25:27,408 --> 01:25:30,208
Don't start drinking,
not tonight, Johnny.

1495
01:25:30,408 --> 01:25:32,208
l won't, Katie, l won't.

1496
01:25:57,808 --> 01:25:59,208
Well, did he go out on a job,
do you know?

1497
01:25:59,408 --> 01:26:01,808
lf he did, he didn't get it through
us.

1498
01:26:04,808 --> 01:26:05,608
Thank you.

1499
01:26:14,808 --> 01:26:17,208
Oh, how are you, Mrs. Nolan,
and a Happy New Year to you.

1500
01:26:17,408 --> 01:26:22,408
Same to you, Mr. McGarrity.
l just came to.

1501
01:26:24,808 --> 01:26:28,008
well, l happened to be passing by
and l thought l'd run in and thank

1502
01:26:28,008 --> 01:26:30,208
you for the candy canes you sent us.
lt was nice of you.

1503
01:26:30,408 --> 01:26:32,208
Oh, thas all right. lt wasn't much.

1504
01:26:32,408 --> 01:26:39,208
Well, it was nice of you. Good night,
Mr. McGarrity.

1505
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:44,008
Good night, Mrs. Nolan. Mrs. Nolan,
Johnny ain't here.

1506
01:26:44,008 --> 01:26:45,208
He ain't been here since before
Christmas.

1507
01:27:05,808 --> 01:27:08,008
Oh, l'm afraid is bad news l'm
bringing you, Mrs. Nolan.

1508
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:11,408
Our station just got a report that
Mr. Nolan was found

1509
01:27:11,408 --> 01:27:14,208
over in Manhattan, very sick.
He's been taken to a hospital.

1510
01:27:15,808 --> 01:27:17,608
See that Neeley gets to school on
time in the morning.

1511
01:27:17,808 --> 01:27:19,008
There's an apple for your lunches.

1512
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:22,008
The report says that he just
collapsed,

1513
01:27:22,008 --> 01:27:24,008
right in the doorway of
an employment agency.

1514
01:27:24,008 --> 01:27:27,808
And he'd just been going out on a
job, as sand hog in a tunnel, they said.

1515
01:27:28,008 --> 01:27:29,408
And he hadn't been drinking, ma'am.

1516
01:27:29,608 --> 01:27:32,608
He'd been waiting there a long time
for the job.

1517
01:27:32,808 --> 01:27:35,008
He was just sick.

1518
01:27:41,408 --> 01:27:42,808
We did everything we could.

1519
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,608
Yeah, sure, l know.

1520
01:27:46,008 --> 01:27:48,008
What are you writing down that he
died from, Doctor?

1521
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:50,408
Acute alcoholism and pneumonia.
One led to the other.

1522
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:54,208
l don't want you to write down that
he died like that.

1523
01:27:56,408 --> 01:27:57,408
Put just the pneumonia.

1524
01:27:57,808 --> 01:27:58,208
l can't do that.

1525
01:27:58,408 --> 01:28:01,208
Pneumonia was the direct cause of
death, but the alcoholism was...

1526
01:28:01,408 --> 01:28:02,208
Look, he's dead.

1527
01:28:02,408 --> 01:28:05,008
l've got two nice kids that are going
to grow up to amount to something.

1528
01:28:05,008 --> 01:28:07,808
Why do you have to make it hard by
saying that their father

1529
01:28:08,008 --> 01:28:11,208
died from the drink when thas
only a little piece of the truth?

1530
01:28:11,408 --> 01:28:14,408
He wasn't drinking, they said so.
He was out looking for work.

1531
01:28:17,608 --> 01:28:19,208
Why can't you put that down?

1532
01:28:22,008 --> 01:28:25,608
Cause of death: pneumonia.

1533
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,608
Everlasting rest and happiness,

1534
01:28:31,608 --> 01:28:34,008
through the infinite merits
of Jesus Christ.

1535
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:35,808
Oh, God,

1536
01:28:36,008 --> 01:28:39,008
great and omnipotent judge of the
living and the dead,

1537
01:28:39,008 --> 01:28:42,408
if all whom we are to appear
after this short life,

1538
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:44,208
to render an account of our worth,

1539
01:28:44,408 --> 01:28:48,408
let our hearts we pray to be deeply
wounded at the sight of this death,

1540
01:28:48,408 --> 01:28:51,608
and while we consign the body of the
deceased to the earth,

1541
01:28:51,608 --> 01:28:55,608
let us be mindful of our own frailties
and mortality,

1542
01:28:55,608 --> 01:28:59,608
that walking always in thy fear and
in the ways of thy commandments,

1543
01:28:59,608 --> 01:29:03,208
we may after our departure from this world,
experience

1544
01:29:03,408 --> 01:29:07,608
a merciful judgement and rejoice
in everlasting happiness.

1545
01:29:07,808 --> 01:29:09,608
Through Christ our lord.

1546
01:29:09,808 --> 01:29:13,408
All them people, and the flowers.

1547
01:29:14,608 --> 01:29:17,008
Some of them from people l never
heard of even.

1548
01:29:17,008 --> 01:29:21,808
Who'd have thought, that many folks.

1549
01:29:23,008 --> 01:29:28,408
l mean they was carrying on like
they was his family, or...

1550
01:29:28,408 --> 01:29:31,608
or... l don't know.

1551
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:37,408
Yeah, he took the time to make a lot
of people love him all right.

1552
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:41,008
ls hard to figure out so many of
them showing up.

1553
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:45,808
And they was feeling something.

1554
01:29:47,608 --> 01:29:50,008
l mean, there was no reason for them
to put on.

1555
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:53,808
He was nobody big, he was just a...

1556
01:29:54,008 --> 01:29:55,608
Katie, don't talk about it no more,
kid.

1557
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:06,408
Francis!

1558
01:30:06,608 --> 01:30:09,208
Les leave her be, Katie. She
maybe wants to be by herself.

1559
01:30:09,408 --> 01:30:11,408
She's taking on kind of funny, she
ain't even cried.

1560
01:30:28,608 --> 01:30:31,808
l'd like my father's shaving cup.
That one, "Nolan".

1561
01:30:36,808 --> 01:30:40,808
Oh, you're the little girl. Yes,
l'll clean it up for you.

1562
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:46,408
He was a fine man.

1563
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:49,808
Tell your Mama that l,
his barber, said this.

1564
01:31:29,008 --> 01:31:30,008
Francis...

1565
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:32,208
What?

1566
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:36,208
Francis, do you know where you're
going?

1567
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:38,808
No place.

1568
01:31:41,008 --> 01:31:42,408
Francis?

1569
01:31:44,008 --> 01:31:45,408
Yes, Mama?

1570
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:48,408
lt was nice of the neighbors to send
over all that food,

1571
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,608
don't you want something?

1572
01:31:51,208 --> 01:31:52,208
No, Mama.

1573
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,008
l wanted to talk to you, Francie.

1574
01:31:59,408 --> 01:32:05,208
l want things to go on,
reading and all. l want to do...

1575
01:32:07,008 --> 01:32:10,008
Well, l gotta be Mama and Papa both
to you now, Francie.

1576
01:32:20,008 --> 01:32:21,608
Yes, Mama. ls that all, Mama?

1577
01:32:24,208 --> 01:32:30,808
Well, you gotta go right now,
Francie.

1578
01:32:30,808 --> 01:32:33,608
l'll be back. Honest l will.

1579
01:32:43,008 --> 01:32:48,208
Mom, l guess l'm a little hungry.

1580
01:32:52,008 --> 01:32:58,208
Look, he can't be dead. He can't.
They don't understand.

1581
01:33:01,608 --> 01:33:06,808
Maybe you could let me have a baby
some day, and it could be a boy,

1582
01:33:06,608 --> 01:33:09,608
so it could be just like him.

1583
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:17,208
ld have to be me.
Nobody else loved him like l do.

1584
01:33:19,608 --> 01:33:29,808
Maybe you could do that for me. And
if you could, he wouldn't even die.

1585
01:33:38,808 --> 01:33:41,408
l hope you don't think l'm forward
coming in like this, Mrs. Nolan.

1586
01:33:41,608 --> 01:33:43,608
How are you, Francie?

1587
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,808
l'm well, thank you.

1588
01:33:44,808 --> 01:33:48,208
Have a chair. Francie, see if Mr.
McGarrity won't have some coffee.

1589
01:33:48,208 --> 01:33:51,408
Not for me, thank you.
l figured l'd ought to come.

1590
01:33:51,408 --> 01:33:54,408
l suppose you know how Johnny
and l done business.

1591
01:33:54,608 --> 01:33:58,408
He used to give me money to keep
and then draw against it.

1592
01:33:58,408 --> 01:34:03,408
l got to looking around.

1593
01:34:03,408 --> 01:34:05,208
And... what do you think?

1594
01:34:05,408 --> 01:34:08,608
l had pretty near 5 bucks
in his box.

1595
01:34:08,808 --> 01:34:13,608
Ando so l figured
it belongs to you.

1596
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:19,408
ld more likely be
that he owed you.

1597
01:34:19,608 --> 01:34:23,208
But thank you very much.

1598
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:27,208
l just thought...
- We'll make out.

1599
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:29,608
There's something else, then.

1600
01:34:29,808 --> 01:34:32,808
Maybe you wouldn't mind if...

1601
01:34:33,008 --> 01:34:36,008
if Francie and Neeley
come down and work for me,

1602
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:39,008
afternoons like. l mean,
after school and Saturdays.

1603
01:34:39,008 --> 01:34:42,408
Maybe it isn't just the place
you'd favour them working,

1604
01:34:42,608 --> 01:34:45,208
but l'd keep an eye on them.

1605
01:34:45,408 --> 01:34:48,408
And l could pay them
2 dollars a week a piece.

1606
01:34:48,608 --> 01:34:52,408
l'd take it
as a real favour, Madame.

1607
01:34:54,808 --> 01:34:56,808
You're an awful bad liar.

1608
01:34:56,608 --> 01:35:02,208
But you're a very good man.
l'm ashamed l didn't know before.

1609
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:04,408
No, it isn't that, Madame.
Johnny was...

1610
01:35:04,608 --> 01:35:07,808
Well, l don't know. Johnny...

1611
01:35:08,008 --> 01:35:10,408
Johnny always talked
about his family like...

1612
01:35:10,608 --> 01:35:13,008
like folks ought to,
only they don't.

1613
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:16,808
And whenever he talked about it

1614
01:35:16,808 --> 01:35:18,208
he always made you

1615
01:35:18,408 --> 01:35:22,208
feel better,
or you wanted to laugh.

1616
01:35:22,808 --> 01:35:24,408
laugh. Like that sea shell l had
there.

1617
01:35:24,608 --> 01:35:27,808
He was always... he was always
listening to it and...

1618
01:35:28,008 --> 01:35:29,608
and telling you what it was saying.

1619
01:35:31,008 --> 01:35:32,808
He was always giving things like
that to people.

1620
01:35:36,008 --> 01:35:38,208
He was a fine man, Mrs. Nolan.

1621
01:35:43,408 --> 01:35:46,408
l'd a glad to let the children work
for you, Mr. McCarrity.

1622
01:35:46,408 --> 01:35:51,408
And the four dollars a week will
keep us until the baby comes.

1623
01:35:51,408 --> 01:35:53,408
And Francie won't have to quit
school, she can keep on,

1624
01:35:53,608 --> 01:35:54,408
and they can both...

1625
01:36:00,408 --> 01:36:02,008
Well, is a deal, then.

1626
01:36:02,008 --> 01:36:05,208
And you tell them to come through
the family entrance tomorrow after

1627
01:36:05,408 --> 01:36:09,008
school and ah...
ls that all right with you, Francie?

1628
01:36:09,008 --> 01:36:10,208
Yes.

1629
01:36:13,008 --> 01:36:18,608
Well, ah, well is settled then,
and good day to you, Mrs. Nolan.

1630
01:36:18,608 --> 01:36:22,808
And thank you again, Mr. McGarrity.
Francie?

1631
01:36:23,008 --> 01:36:24,208
Yes, Mama?

1632
01:36:26,608 --> 01:36:28,808
l'm glad you can keep on with your
school.

1633
01:36:28,808 --> 01:36:32,808
l was hoping something like this
would happen but l didn't want to

1634
01:36:32,808 --> 01:36:34,608
say anything until the time come.

1635
01:36:36,408 --> 01:36:40,808
But your Papa and l talked it all
over and there were reasons

1636
01:36:41,008 --> 01:36:44,608
and there just wasn't any other way.

1637
01:36:46,008 --> 01:36:49,408
lt doesn't matter. Papa saved one
from it.

1638
01:37:05,408 --> 01:37:06,208
Hi-ya, kid.

1639
01:37:06,408 --> 01:37:08,808
Well, they're sure taking chances l
wouldn't, leaving you handling meat.

1640
01:37:09,808 --> 01:37:10,608
Where's France.

1641
01:37:10,808 --> 01:37:16,608
Hello, kid. How are you lamb? Look,
you gotta do something for me.

1642
01:37:16,808 --> 01:37:18,608
This was in the paper and l cut it
out.

1643
01:37:18,808 --> 01:37:22,408
You got to read it to me.
Whas the matter, hon?

1644
01:37:22,408 --> 01:37:24,008
Nothing, l'm all right, Aunt Sissy.

1645
01:37:24,408 --> 01:37:25,808
No, you ain't. You ain't been since...

1646
01:37:26,008 --> 01:37:28,808
Look, don't you think you better
spill it to your Aunt Sissy?

1647
01:37:29,008 --> 01:37:30,808
What is it you want me to read to
you, Aunt Sissy?

1648
01:37:30,808 --> 01:37:34,008
Well, we'll get that out of the way
first. Look, here it is.

1649
01:37:34,008 --> 01:37:36,208
Likely you don't remember him, but
is my last husband, Bill.

1650
01:37:36,408 --> 01:37:37,808
The one l thought was dead,
but he ain't.

1651
01:37:38,008 --> 01:37:40,008
He's got his picture in there and l
want to know what it says.

1652
01:37:40,208 --> 01:37:42,208
Maybe it says where he lives so's l
can write to him about getting a

1653
01:37:42,408 --> 01:37:43,208
divorce or something.

1654
01:37:43,408 --> 01:37:45,208
l got the best husband in all the
world now,

1655
01:37:45,408 --> 01:37:47,208
and l don't want this here one
bobbing up and making no trouble.

1656
01:37:47,408 --> 01:37:50,208
He's a fireman someplace. l can tell
that from his clothes.

1657
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:51,808
He was just starting out in the
fireman business...

1658
01:37:52,008 --> 01:37:53,608
lt says he's a hero. He saved some
people in a fire.

1659
01:37:53,808 --> 01:37:54,608
Does it say where?

1660
01:37:54,808 --> 01:37:57,208
The ninth precinct. Manhattan.

1661
01:37:57,408 --> 01:38:00,408
Manhattan, huh? Couldn't make the
grade in Brooklyn, l guess.

1662
01:38:00,408 --> 01:38:03,008
l want you to write to him, Francie.
Write this: "Dear Bill...

1663
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:05,608
This says his name is Roland Polasky.

1664
01:38:05,808 --> 01:38:09,408
Thas right. l remember. Make it
"Dear Mr. Polasky.

1665
01:38:10,408 --> 01:38:13,208
Being's as now l'm married to
somebody else, l want you to see

1666
01:38:13,408 --> 01:38:15,008
about getting a real legal divorce.

1667
01:38:15,208 --> 01:38:17,208
Because l thought you was dead but
you ain't.

1668
01:38:17,408 --> 01:38:19,808
And because you got the money now on
account of the reward.

1669
01:38:20,008 --> 01:38:21,808
Yours very truly, Sissy." Something
like that.

1670
01:38:22,008 --> 01:38:24,008
But Aunt Sissy, he must have already
done that.

1671
01:38:24,208 --> 01:38:25,808
Because it says here he's married
again.

1672
01:38:26,208 --> 01:38:27,208
lt does?

1673
01:38:27,408 --> 01:38:29,208
"On the human interest side of the
story,

1674
01:38:29,408 --> 01:38:32,608
Mrs. Polasky had returned home only
the day before from the hospital,

1675
01:38:32,808 --> 01:38:34,808
after presenting Mr. Polasky with
a brand new son,

1676
01:38:35,008 --> 01:38:36,608
the fourth child of the marriage.

1677
01:38:36,808 --> 01:38:39,608
So, if he got a divorce that long
ago, you don't have to.

1678
01:38:39,808 --> 01:38:42,408
Then my being married to Bill, this
one l mean, is all legal?

1679
01:38:42,408 --> 01:38:45,208
Well, now, if that ain't a load off
my chest.

1680
01:38:45,408 --> 01:38:49,408
You know something, l think l'll
give Bill Polasky a wedding present.

1681
01:38:49,408 --> 01:38:51,808
But Aunt Sissy, you can't. He's been
married for years.

1682
01:38:52,608 --> 01:38:56,608
Four kids, huh? Must be a sickly
woman, this Mrs. Polasky,

1683
01:38:56,808 --> 01:38:58,408
going to the hospital just
to have a baby.

1684
01:38:58,608 --> 01:39:01,608
Oh, no, lots of people go there now
to have babies. ls better.

1685
01:39:01,808 --> 01:39:05,008
Sure enough? You know something?

1686
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:08,808
l'm gonna cash in my funeral policy
and have my baby at a hospital.

1687
01:39:09,008 --> 01:39:11,408
And when my baby is born, and lives,

1688
01:39:12,408 --> 01:39:14,408
l want you to write that R. Polasky
and announce it.

1689
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:16,408
Boy do l feel better.

1690
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,208
And now, chickapea, we'll talk about
you.

1691
01:39:18,408 --> 01:39:20,208
Can't your Aunt Sissy help you any?

1692
01:39:20,408 --> 01:39:21,008
l'm all right.

1693
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:22,008
No, you aren't honey.

1694
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:23,608
Not all shut up like that, l know
how you feel,

1695
01:39:23,808 --> 01:39:25,008
but you can't keep hanging on to it.

1696
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:30,008
l'm ail right. l don't want to talk
about it.

1697
01:39:30,008 --> 01:39:30,408
All right, baby. All right. But l'll
tell you what.

1698
01:39:30,608 --> 01:39:32,208
You can do something for me.

1699
01:39:32,608 --> 01:39:37,808
Look, your Mama feels awful bad too.
She needs you.

1700
01:39:37,808 --> 01:39:39,408
Why don't you talk to her about it.

1701
01:39:39,608 --> 01:39:41,208
She doesn't need me.
No she doesn't.

1702
01:39:41,408 --> 01:39:42,008
She's got Neeley!

1703
01:39:42,408 --> 01:39:43,808
Why wasn't it Neeley she was going
to make quit school.

1704
01:39:44,008 --> 01:39:45,008
He never cared about it.

1705
01:39:45,008 --> 01:39:46,408
She doesn't love me like Papa did.

1706
01:39:46,808 --> 01:39:48,408
And she didn't love him, either. Not
really.

1707
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,608
She hurt him, l saw her. And he
never hurt anybody.

1708
01:39:51,808 --> 01:39:54,208
l'm gonna finish this grade because
he gave it to me

1709
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:55,408
and then l'll work for her.

1710
01:39:55,608 --> 01:39:57,808
But she can't be Papa to me, she
can't ever!

1711
01:39:58,008 --> 01:39:59,008
Don't feel like that, baby, don't.

1712
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:03,808
Leave me alone. l'm all right.
Please go away and leave me alone.

1713
01:40:06,408 --> 01:40:09,008
All right, chickapea, all right.

1714
01:40:16,608 --> 01:40:18,008
Ah, Mr. Sterns...
Yes, sir.

1715
01:40:23,408 --> 01:40:24,408
Francie...

1716
01:40:25,808 --> 01:40:26,608
Yes, Mama?

1717
01:40:29,608 --> 01:40:30,808
l want to talk to you, Francie.

1718
01:40:35,808 --> 01:40:36,808
Yes, Mama?

1719
01:40:37,608 --> 01:40:41,808
lt isn't going to be long now, for
me, l mean, for my baby.

1720
01:40:41,808 --> 01:40:44,208
We can't come to a hospital.

1721
01:40:44,408 --> 01:40:47,808
There isn't even going to be enough
money for a woman to come and help.

1722
01:40:50,008 --> 01:40:55,208
l'm going to need you, Francie.
Don't ever be far away.

1723
01:40:55,208 --> 01:40:58,808
Neeley's, well, a boy ain't much
good at a time like this.

1724
01:40:58,808 --> 01:41:03,608
l'm counting on you, Francie.
You won't forget that, will you?

1725
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:08,608
All right, Mama. l'll remember.

1726
01:41:08,608 --> 01:41:10,608
Which one of you is Mr. Steven
Edwards?

1727
01:41:10,808 --> 01:41:11,808
Thas me.

1728
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:14,408
Well, there are three in your family
now.

1729
01:41:14,608 --> 01:41:16,008
You are the father of a pretty fine
boy.

1730
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:17,208
ls he alive?
- Very much so.

1731
01:41:17,408 --> 01:41:20,208
He was a little reluctant about it
at first, l had to rouse him with a

1732
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:22,408
little oxygen, now he's mad at me,
you ought to hear him.

1733
01:41:22,608 --> 01:41:23,808
l've got to see him.

1734
01:41:24,008 --> 01:41:25,808
Well, neither one of them are quite
up to a visit just now,

1735
01:41:26,008 --> 01:41:27,208
in a little while.

1736
01:41:27,408 --> 01:41:31,408
The learning. The learning that
saved that baby.

1737
01:41:31,608 --> 01:41:33,008
Thas fine, Bill.

1738
01:41:33,808 --> 01:41:35,208
Where are you going, Uncle Bill?

1739
01:41:35,608 --> 01:41:37,208
l'm going out and get some
strawberry ice cream

1740
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:40,408
and a rattle for my son.
And whas more, my name ain't Bill.

1741
01:41:40,608 --> 01:41:43,208
ls Steve, do you hear that? l'm a
Papa and my name's Steve.

1742
01:41:43,408 --> 01:41:48,608
And is Uncle Steve, too. Steve,
Steve...

1743
01:41:49,808 --> 01:41:51,808
So, we have a man in the family.

1744
01:41:58,808 --> 01:42:00,208
Quick as we see she's all right,

1745
01:42:00,208 --> 01:42:02,408
you go on up to McGarrity's and
see if you can do my work, too.

1746
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,208
l'm going to finish the scrubbing
for her.

1747
01:42:04,608 --> 01:42:05,608
She oughtn't do any more.

1748
01:42:05,808 --> 01:42:11,808
She wasn't feeling good this morning.
Mama!

1749
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:20,008
Mama!

1750
01:42:21,208 --> 01:42:22,608
ln here, Frances.

1751
01:42:25,208 --> 01:42:26,408
You wait here.

1752
01:42:29,808 --> 01:42:30,808
You all right, Mama?

1753
01:42:36,408 --> 01:42:39,608
Give Neeley a nickel to go after
Grandma and Sissy.

1754
01:42:40,408 --> 01:42:42,208
He can walk home after.

1755
01:42:42,808 --> 01:42:44,808
Get me a nightgown in that bottom
drawer.

1756
01:42:52,008 --> 01:42:54,008
Hurry, don't stand there staring.

1757
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:03,008
ls she going to die?

1758
01:43:03,208 --> 01:43:06,008
Of course not, is the baby. You
heard what Mama said, and hurry.

1759
01:43:06,208 --> 01:43:08,608
And don't forget stopping at
McGarrity's on the way back.

1760
01:43:08,608 --> 01:43:20,608
We can't lose the work. She only
wants me now. Mama!

1761
01:43:21,208 --> 01:43:24,808
What is it?
Oh, l'll be there in a minute.

1762
01:43:50,208 --> 01:43:52,808
You're taking real good care of me,
Francie.

1763
01:43:54,008 --> 01:43:55,408
Am l, Mama?

1764
01:44:08,808 --> 01:44:10,208
Umm. Tastes good.

1765
01:44:19,408 --> 01:44:21,208
Can l get you a glass of water,
Mama?

1766
01:44:22,008 --> 01:44:23,808
When l want something,
l'll ask for it.

1767
01:44:24,008 --> 01:44:25,408
Yes, Mama.

1768
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:30,208
Don't just stand there and throw
questions at me, l'm too tired.

1769
01:44:30,408 --> 01:44:33,608
You'd better have some coffee too.

1770
01:44:33,608 --> 01:44:36,608
Mama, even if Neeley is a boy,
wouldn't you rather have him here?

1771
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,008
He's always such a comfort to you.

1772
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:40,008
No, is you thas a comfort now.
What time is it?

1773
01:44:40,008 --> 01:44:41,008
l don't know, Mama.

1774
01:44:41,208 --> 01:44:42,208
Get the clock.

1775
01:44:51,608 --> 01:44:53,008
one minute to 4, Mama.

1776
01:44:53,208 --> 01:44:55,408
Are you sure it isn't slow?

1777
01:44:55,608 --> 01:44:56,808
No, Mama.

1778
01:44:57,008 --> 01:44:59,408
Maybe is fast, then.

1779
01:44:59,408 --> 01:45:02,808
l'll look at the jeweler's clock out
the parlor window.

1780
01:45:08,408 --> 01:45:17,408
That candle's pretty, like Christmas.
That was the night l told him.

1781
01:45:25,008 --> 01:45:27,208
ls nice having a visit from my
daughter.

1782
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:33,008
l didn't want for you to have to
grow up so soon.

1783
01:45:33,608 --> 01:45:36,008
l didn't want for you to have to
quit school.

1784
01:45:36,208 --> 01:45:37,608
l tried to tell him that.

1785
01:45:38,008 --> 01:45:40,008
He didn't mind about the baby, but
he never forgived me

1786
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:41,808
for wanting you to quit school.

1787
01:45:42,008 --> 01:45:48,808
l told him and he just went out. You
never forgived me, either.

1788
01:45:48,808 --> 01:45:50,008
Please don't, Mama.

1789
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:51,808
He would have bought you dolls
instead of milk.

1790
01:45:52,008 --> 01:45:54,808
l don't know, maybe you would have
been happier. l don't know.

1791
01:45:54,808 --> 01:45:57,808
l never woulïve thought of giving
you that school, like he did.

1792
01:45:58,008 --> 01:46:03,008
And all them fine compositions of
yours. l never read one of 'em.

1793
01:46:03,008 --> 01:46:07,608
l shoulda had time. Johnny did.
But l couldn't do no different.

1794
01:46:07,608 --> 01:46:09,608
l don't know how l could do any
different.

1795
01:46:17,008 --> 01:46:18,208
What time is it?

1796
01:46:19,208 --> 01:46:21,008
One minute after four, Mama.

1797
01:46:22,808 --> 01:46:25,208
Rinse a cloth out in cold water,
wipe my face.

1798
01:46:37,208 --> 01:46:39,208
Don't let her die, please!

1799
01:46:54,608 --> 01:46:58,408
Mama, what if the baby comes before
Grandma and Aunt Sissy get here?

1800
01:46:58,808 --> 01:47:01,208
You can see l couldn't do no
different, can't you?

1801
01:47:02,608 --> 01:47:04,008
Neeley, he don't like school.

1802
01:47:04,208 --> 01:47:06,008
lf he'd quit, he'd never go back
again.

1803
01:47:06,608 --> 01:47:08,808
But you, no matter what happens,
you'd find a way to go back,

1804
01:47:09,008 --> 01:47:12,208
you'd fight to go back.
You can see that, can't you?

1805
01:47:13,408 --> 01:47:17,408
l... Yes, Mama.

1806
01:47:18,808 --> 01:47:21,408
Read me something, Francie.
- Yes, Mama.

1807
01:47:22,408 --> 01:47:23,808
Read me one of your compositions.

1808
01:47:24,008 --> 01:47:25,808
l ain't never read any of your
compositions.

1809
01:47:26,008 --> 01:47:27,608
ls on my conscience.

1810
01:47:32,408 --> 01:47:34,608
l tore all those up.

1811
01:47:34,808 --> 01:47:38,208
No, you didn't. Not all of'em.

1812
01:47:40,408 --> 01:47:43,008
Can't l read you Shakespeare? ls
much better.

1813
01:47:45,008 --> 01:47:46,808
Read "Twas on a Night Like This".

1814
01:47:47,008 --> 01:47:51,408
l'd like to have something pretty on
my mind. Sit by the candle.

1815
01:48:00,408 --> 01:48:03,408
"The moon shines bright,
in such a night as this,

1816
01:48:03,408 --> 01:48:06,008
when the sweet wind did
gently kiss the trees..."

1817
01:48:06,208 --> 01:48:09,408
Say, did you ever find out who
Troylis was and Cressida?

1818
01:48:09,608 --> 01:48:11,008
Yes, Mama, Troylis was...

1819
01:48:11,208 --> 01:48:14,808
Some other day when l got time. Read
me one of your compositions now.

1820
01:48:14,808 --> 01:48:16,608
You won't like them, Mama.

1821
01:48:16,808 --> 01:48:18,208
You thought about them, and you
worked on them,

1822
01:48:18,408 --> 01:48:21,408
and you got good marks on them.
Get 'em, l said.

1823
01:48:54,408 --> 01:49:00,608
Sit here. Go on.

1824
01:49:03,808 --> 01:49:11,608
ls called, "The Man People Loved".
Please don't make me do this, Mama.

1825
01:49:11,608 --> 01:49:12,208
Read it.

1826
01:49:15,808 --> 01:49:20,608
"Perhaps many people might have said
of him that he was a failure.

1827
01:49:20,608 --> 01:49:24,008
lt is true that he had no gift for
making money,

1828
01:49:24,208 --> 01:49:28,408
but he had a gift for laughter,
and for making people love him.

1829
01:49:29,008 --> 01:49:32,608
He had the gift of making you feel
proud to walk down the street with him

1830
01:49:32,808 --> 01:49:35,208
He had nothing to give but himself.

1831
01:49:35,408 --> 01:49:38,408
But of this he gave generously, like
a king.

1832
01:49:38,408 --> 01:49:42,808
Like a king. Thas like it was.

1833
01:49:43,008 --> 01:49:46,008
Walking down the street with him,
you always felt like that.

1834
01:49:47,008 --> 01:49:48,608
Did you, Mama.

1835
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:52,208
You were real smart to write it down
like that, Francie.

1836
01:49:52,208 --> 01:50:01,808
Thas like it was. Francie, l miss
him so much!

1837
01:50:01,608 --> 01:50:08,608
lf the baby's a boy, we'll call him
Johnny. Where's Sissy?

1838
01:50:08,608 --> 01:50:16,008
Neeley's been gone a long time. Wipe
my face.

1839
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:17,408
No, don't let go of my hand.

1840
01:50:19,408 --> 01:50:23,608
lf is a girl, we'll call her Annie
Lorrie.

1841
01:50:23,808 --> 01:50:27,808
Remember that tune he played? You
ought to have piano lessons.

1842
01:50:27,808 --> 01:50:29,408
l'll see if l can manage.

1843
01:50:29,608 --> 01:50:32,608
You won't forget to dust the piano,
will you Francie?

1844
01:50:32,608 --> 01:50:35,208
Who'll cry for me like that if l
died?

1845
01:50:35,408 --> 01:50:38,808
l never did a wrong thing in my life,
but it ain't enough.

1846
01:50:38,808 --> 01:50:43,208
Oh! Sissy, l didn't mean to be hard,
like you said!

1847
01:50:44,208 --> 01:50:48,008
lf Johnny were here, he could go to
your graduation, and l'd go to

1848
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:52,008
Neeley's, but l, l can't tear myself
into two pieces.

1849
01:50:52,008 --> 01:50:59,208
How am l going to do both? Oh!
Where are you, Francie!

1850
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:00,208
l'm here, Mama!

1851
01:51:00,408 --> 01:51:11,808
Oh, you're such a comfort to me.
l'm so tired. Leave me sleep now.

1852
01:51:26,608 --> 01:51:27,608
You'd better start some water
boiling,

1853
01:51:27,808 --> 01:51:28,408
she's going to be needing it.

1854
01:51:28,608 --> 01:51:29,408
We'll call you if there's anything
we need.

1855
01:51:29,608 --> 01:51:31,008
l thought you were never coming,
Sissy.

1856
01:51:31,408 --> 01:51:33,808
Come on, you quit worrying, now.

1857
01:51:58,608 --> 01:52:04,008
The baby is here and the Mama is
doing good. She's asleep.

1858
01:52:04,208 --> 01:52:06,608
A small baby sister it is.

1859
01:52:13,008 --> 01:52:17,608
Annie Lorrie. Papa would have liked
that.

1860
01:52:24,008 --> 01:52:25,408
Where's Grandma?

1861
01:52:29,808 --> 01:52:32,208
l've got her in a front seat so she
won't miss a thing.

1862
01:52:33,008 --> 01:52:35,008
lsn't your classroom around here
somewhere?

1863
01:52:35,208 --> 01:52:36,208
Yes, but...

1864
01:52:36,408 --> 01:52:37,408
How about giving me a peek?

1865
01:52:37,608 --> 01:52:39,808
Wouldn't hurt me none seeing a
little more places like that.

1866
01:52:44,208 --> 01:52:46,008
Hey, Francie, you forgot your
flowers.

1867
01:52:46,008 --> 01:52:48,408
They aren't mine, l'm not carrying
flowers today.

1868
01:52:49,208 --> 01:52:51,208
Some of the girls, their family
sends them flowers.

1869
01:52:51,408 --> 01:52:53,608
They're on your desk, lamb. Better
go see.

1870
01:52:56,808 --> 01:52:59,208
Oh well, l have to get my things,
anyway.

1871
01:53:14,008 --> 01:53:18,808
"To Francie on graduation day, love
from Papa."

1872
01:53:32,808 --> 01:53:34,408
He gave me the money to buy them way
before Christmas.

1873
01:53:34,608 --> 01:53:39,408
To make sure he had it, he said.
Then he wrote out the card.

1874
01:53:50,608 --> 01:53:51,608
Come on, Kid.

1875
01:53:55,008 --> 01:53:57,408
Let it go, baby, there ain't a soul
around here. Let it go.

1876
01:54:07,008 --> 01:54:08,408
Frances Nolan.

1877
01:54:19,808 --> 01:54:22,408
Well, sir, l don't think Grandma
said one word the whole time.

1878
01:54:22,608 --> 01:54:24,208
And from the looks of her when l put
her on the street car, she'll

1879
01:54:24,608 --> 01:54:27,808
probably ride clear out to Coney
lsland and never know the difference.

1880
01:54:28,608 --> 01:54:29,408
Heaven knows what she would have
been like

1881
01:54:29,608 --> 01:54:31,208
if she'd got to both graduations.

1882
01:54:31,408 --> 01:54:35,208
Looks to me like it was a pretty
fine day. How's your soda, Francie?

1883
01:54:35,408 --> 01:54:36,808
Pineapple's not as good as chocolate.

1884
01:54:37,008 --> 01:54:38,008
Then whad you order it for?

1885
01:54:38,408 --> 01:54:40,408
Because l'm up to the "Ps". Next
time l'll try raspberry next.

1886
01:54:40,608 --> 01:54:42,808
There's something to that idea. Try
everything once.

1887
01:54:43,008 --> 01:54:43,808
Sissy!

1888
01:54:44,008 --> 01:54:47,608
And a dime for you, my boy. This is
a special occasion. Thank you.

1889
01:54:47,608 --> 01:54:49,008
He don't know how special it is.

1890
01:54:49,208 --> 01:54:51,408
Two diplomas in the Nolan family all
in one day.

1891
01:54:51,608 --> 01:54:55,408
Mama, l've got a nickel if you want
to leave it. People do.

1892
01:54:55,608 --> 01:54:57,608
ls going to be all right, Francie.

1893
01:54:57,608 --> 01:55:01,608
And you know something, these ain't
gonna be the last diplomas, either.

1894
01:55:01,608 --> 01:55:02,408
l don't know how we're gonna work it,

1895
01:55:02,608 --> 01:55:04,408
but we're gonna find
some way for you and...

1896
01:55:04,608 --> 01:55:06,408
Hi, Neeley, how ya doing?

1897
01:55:06,608 --> 01:55:09,008
Okay, l got out of jail.

1898
01:55:09,208 --> 01:55:13,208
Say, wasn't that you l saw working
behind that bat the other day?

1899
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:14,408
Well, yeah, but...

1900
01:55:14,608 --> 01:55:16,408
Hey, you were pretty good.
You know what?

1901
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:18,408
l can come out and give you some
pointers some time.

1902
01:55:18,608 --> 01:55:19,408
Honest?

1903
01:55:19,608 --> 01:55:21,808
Sure l will. That is, if your mom
don't mind.

1904
01:55:22,008 --> 01:55:23,608
Naw, she don't mind. You mean it?

1905
01:55:24,008 --> 01:55:28,408
Sure. Well, l'll see you on the lot.

1906
01:55:30,408 --> 01:55:32,408
Maybe you better ask your ma, you
know,

1907
01:55:32,408 --> 01:55:34,208
l don't want to do anything
she wouldn't want me to.

1908
01:55:34,408 --> 01:55:35,608
Naw, she won't care.

1909
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,408
Maybe you'd better ask her yourself,
just to make sure.

1910
01:55:37,608 --> 01:55:42,408
l'm Neeley's aunt, this is his ma,
but thas his sister.

1911
01:55:42,608 --> 01:55:44,408
Whas-your name, big boy?

1912
01:55:45,408 --> 01:55:46,408
Hershel Knudsen.

1913
01:55:46,608 --> 01:55:50,208
Mr. Knudsen, l'd like for you to
meet my niece, Miss Francie Nolan.

1914
01:55:52,208 --> 01:55:53,408
Pleased to meet you.

1915
01:55:53,408 --> 01:55:54,808
Hello.

1916
01:55:57,208 --> 01:55:59,608
Nice night if it don't rain. Sit
down, Hershel.

1917
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:07,808
Ah, doing anything tomorrow
afternoon, Miss Nolan?

1918
01:56:08,008 --> 01:56:09,008
ls Saturday.

1919
01:56:09,208 --> 01:56:11,408
l don't know. Why?

1920
01:56:11,608 --> 01:56:15,608
Well, there's a swell picture. "Pill
Hard". Maybe you'd like to go.

1921
01:56:15,608 --> 01:56:16,608
Who with?

1922
01:56:16,808 --> 01:56:17,608
Me.

1923
01:56:26,608 --> 01:56:31,208
Oh. Well, l might be busy. l'll let
you know.

1924
01:56:31,208 --> 01:56:33,208
Well, l'll come around and see.

1925
01:56:33,208 --> 01:56:35,608
Hey, l thought we was going to play
ball tomorrow.

1926
01:56:35,808 --> 01:56:39,008
Well, we can do that anytime. Sure,
there's lots of time.

1927
01:56:39,008 --> 01:56:40,408
Ah, come on, Hersh.

1928
01:56:40,608 --> 01:56:42,408
Well, l'll be seeing you, Miss Nolan.

1929
01:56:46,408 --> 01:56:47,808
Hey, mushy!

1930
01:56:48,008 --> 01:56:50,608
l'm proud of you, chickapea. You
handled him just fine.

1931
01:56:50,608 --> 01:56:51,808
lt was the hair that done it.

1932
01:56:52,008 --> 01:56:55,208
Well, l hate to bust this party up,
but them babies gotta be fed.

1933
01:56:55,408 --> 01:56:57,208
Steve'll be needing a little
something too.

1934
01:56:57,408 --> 01:56:59,008
Three hours with the both of them.

1935
01:56:59,208 --> 01:57:00,808
Thirty out of fifty.

1936
01:57:01,208 --> 01:57:02,008
Keep the change.

1937
01:57:02,208 --> 01:57:03,008
Thank you.

1938
01:57:03,208 --> 01:57:05,008
Why, Katie Nolan.

1939
01:57:05,008 --> 01:57:06,008
l don't care.

1940
01:57:06,208 --> 01:57:10,008
There's times when feeling good and
things like that is important.

1941
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:12,008
l don't care.

1942
01:57:18,008 --> 01:57:20,008
will you carry my flowers for me,
Mama?

1943
01:57:33,608 --> 01:57:35,008
Ah, ya missed it, Steve.

1944
01:57:35,208 --> 01:57:36,408
Ah, hello, handsome.

1945
01:57:38,008 --> 01:57:41,008
Ah, l'm begging your pardon, Mrs.
Nolan. l just happened to drop in.

1946
01:57:41,208 --> 01:57:44,008
And your brother in law here seemed
to be needing a little help.

1947
01:57:44,008 --> 01:57:47,608
And the baby didn't seem to mind, so
l hope l'm not intruding.

1948
01:57:49,608 --> 01:57:51,408
Well, not at all, Mr. McShane.

1949
01:57:55,008 --> 01:57:59,608
You sit right down. We're going home.
Come along, Steve.

1950
01:58:02,808 --> 01:58:04,008
l'll take her, Mr. McShane.

1951
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:05,208
Oh, l'd like it if you'd leave her.

1952
01:58:05,408 --> 01:58:07,808
Her and me has got to be good
friends.

1953
01:58:11,408 --> 01:58:13,208
Well, l wish you didn't have to
hurry.

1954
01:58:13,408 --> 01:58:14,608
Gotta get this family of mine home.

1955
01:58:14,808 --> 01:58:16,608
Steve's got to deliver milk to a lot
of those babies

1956
01:58:17,008 --> 01:58:18,408
that like that bottled kind.

1957
01:58:20,008 --> 01:58:21,808
...Hmm. You don't want frown like
that, Kate.

1958
01:58:22,008 --> 01:58:26,608
The fellas don't like that at all.
Good bye, kids. So long, Mac.

1959
01:58:26,808 --> 01:58:28,808
Oh, so long, Mrs. Edwards.

1960
01:58:29,008 --> 01:58:30,208
Thank you, Aunt Sissy.

1961
01:58:34,408 --> 01:58:35,008
Bye, Mac.

1962
01:58:35,408 --> 01:58:36,608
Mr. Edwards, good bye.

1963
01:58:40,608 --> 01:58:45,608
Well... Well, l will take the
baby from you, Mr. McShane.

1964
01:58:53,608 --> 01:59:01,608
Mrs. Nolan, likely you've been
wondering why l came here tonight.

1965
01:59:02,608 --> 01:59:04,008
Well, let your wondering be over
because

1966
01:59:04,408 --> 01:59:06,408
l came here on a personal matter.

1967
01:59:06,408 --> 01:59:07,208
Mama, should l go...

1968
01:59:07,408 --> 01:59:09,408
No, no. Don't be leaving, children.

1969
01:59:09,408 --> 01:59:13,808
My conversation will be concerning
you as well as your mother.

1970
01:59:18,808 --> 01:59:20,608
Mrs. Nolan, l feel

1971
01:59:20,808 --> 01:59:24,408
that there's no disrespect in
my speaking my mind at this time.

1972
01:59:24,408 --> 01:59:30,808
And l feel that a decent time has
elapsed since the passing of

1973
01:59:30,808 --> 01:59:33,208
Mrs. McShane, God rest her soul.

1974
01:59:35,208 --> 01:59:38,208
Oh, l didn't know, Mr. McShane,
l'm sorry.

1975
01:59:38,408 --> 01:59:40,008
Well, l said nothing, Mrs. Nolan,

1976
01:59:40,208 --> 01:59:42,808
because it was near the time
of your own bereavement.

1977
01:59:42,808 --> 01:59:44,008
And l didn't wish to...

1978
01:59:45,008 --> 01:59:50,208
Well, l know that is barely six
months since your own husband too,

1979
01:59:50,008 --> 01:59:52,808
left this world, rest his soul.

1980
01:59:54,208 --> 01:59:58,608
But, when you feel, a decent
interval has elapsed,

1981
01:59:58,608 --> 02:00:02,208
l'm asking to keep company with you,
Catherine Nolan,

1982
02:00:02,208 --> 02:00:07,408
with the object of a wedding,
when a decent time has elapsed.

1983
02:00:10,408 --> 02:00:16,008
And for my part, l'll be glad to
keep company with you, Mr. McShane,

1984
02:00:16,008 --> 02:00:18,808
not for the help you can give us,
because

1985
02:00:19,008 --> 02:00:23,808
we know we can manage some way,
but,

1986
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:26,808
because you're a good man,
Mr. McShane.

1987
02:00:32,808 --> 02:00:40,208
Ah, and there's ah, there's one more
thing. Their father was a fine man.

1988
02:00:41,208 --> 02:00:43,608
And l'd have no wish to be trying
take his place.

1989
02:00:44,808 --> 02:00:50,408
lt would be more my intention to be
like a real good friend.

1990
02:00:53,008 --> 02:00:55,408
As the eldest, would you be
approving?

1991
02:00:58,808 --> 02:01:00,608
Yes, Mr. McShane.

1992
02:01:05,008 --> 02:01:09,208
l was thinking, it wouldn't be right
for me to ask the two eldest to

1993
02:01:09,208 --> 02:01:10,408
take my name.

1994
02:01:10,608 --> 02:01:15,608
But the little one, the one who has
never looked on her father.

1995
02:01:15,608 --> 02:01:19,208
Could you be thinking of letting me
legally adopt her?

1996
02:01:22,208 --> 02:01:26,208
lf that time comes. The child shall
have your name.

1997
02:01:30,408 --> 02:01:33,408
And now l'm wondering if
l could smoke my pipe.

1998
02:01:33,608 --> 02:01:37,008
You could have smoked any time,
Mr. McShane.

1999
02:01:37,008 --> 02:01:42,208
l didn't want to take any privileges
before l was entitled to them.

2000
02:01:46,808 --> 02:01:48,008
Help me put her to bed, Neeley.
- Why?

2001
02:01:48,208 --> 02:01:50,608
Fix the blankets.

2002
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:01,608
l'll be heating up the coffee now.

2003
02:02:05,008 --> 02:02:07,408
will you join me in a cup,
Mr. McShane?

2004
02:02:09,008 --> 02:02:10,808
Oh, thank you, Catherine, l will.

2005
02:02:13,808 --> 02:02:15,608
Annie Lorrie McShane.

2006
02:02:16,608 --> 02:02:17,608
Yeah.

2007
02:02:17,808 --> 02:02:19,808
She'll never have the hard times we
had, will she?

2008
02:02:20,008 --> 02:02:22,208
She'll never have the fun, either.

2009
02:02:22,408 --> 02:02:25,608
We did have fun, when we were young,
didn't we?

2010
02:02:25,808 --> 02:02:26,808
Yeah.

2011
02:02:27,008 --> 02:02:29,808
Remember the olden days when we
collected junk?

2012
02:02:30,008 --> 02:02:31,408
Poor Lorrie.

2013
02:02:31,608 --> 02:02:38,808
Neeley, look at the tree, is
growing again, just like Papa said.

2014
02:02:38,808 --> 02:02:44,408
l feel kind of sad, like we're
saying good bye to something.

2015
02:02:44,408 --> 02:02:45,808
Yeah.

2016
02:02:48,808 --> 02:02:53,408
Neeley, am l good looking?

2017
02:02:53,408 --> 02:02:55,008
oh, whas eating you?

2018
02:02:55,208 --> 02:02:57,008
No, honest, Neeley. l want to know.

2019
02:03:02,408 --> 02:03:03,408
You'll pass.

2020
02:03:03,608 --> 02:03:06,608
You're sweet, Neeley.

2021
02:03:06,608 --> 02:03:09,008
Oh, cut the mush.
