1
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:27,253
Blackberries!
I got blackberries!

2
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,354
This'll be the last
of them now, Francie.

3
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,107
Is that all, Mom?
Can we go now?

4
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,401
Not so loud, Neeley.
Do you wanna wake
your papa up?

5
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:53,196
Gosh, Francie,
ain't you through
with them dishes yet?

6
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,740
She'll only be a minute.
My, I wish
you was as anxious

7
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,451
to get going on
school mornings
as you is on Saturday.

8
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,744
Papa was late
last night.

9
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,829
Yeah, I was dead asleep
when he come in, I guess.

10
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,707
He says if people
didn't like to make speeches
so much at dinners,

11
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,626
waiters could
spend more time
with their families.

12
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,544
It wasn't much
of a job, I guess.

13
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,421
Them club dinners
don't tip much.

14
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,675
Is that all, Mama?

15
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,552
Yes, yes. Go on.
I'll dry 'em.

16
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,346
You don't look like
you got much there
this week.

17
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,597
One of these days,

18
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,600
Mrs. Gaddis is gonna
throw away that old
wash boiler of hers.

19
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,019
Carney will pay us plenty
for the copper bottom
off of that.

20
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,979
He won't pay you any
more than he has to.

21
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,315
You watch him on
that weighing, now.
Yes'm.

22
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,486
Parents ought to have a day
that's like Saturday
is for kids. Go on.

23
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,238
Maybe if I start
the lower hall

24
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,447
and scrub
my way up today,

25
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,491
it'll make
something special
out of it for me.

26
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,368
Keep an eye
on him, Francie.
Come on!

27
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,495
Yes, Mama!

28
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,583
Rags! Old iron!
Rags! Old iron!

29
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,212
Rags! Old iron!

30
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,226
They done
good today.
Come on.

31
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,863
Boarding!
89th Street!

32
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,948
Neeley!

33
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:24,036
Boarding!
89th Street!

34
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,580
Ragpickers!

35
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,623
Come on.

36
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,671
Now, look. Stand on
the same side as him
when he weighs it

37
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,047
so as he can reach it.

38
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,092
And don't forget
to stand there
after he pays you.

39
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,220
You forgot that last time,
and a penny's a penny,
ain't it?

40
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,555
Well, I guess
I know it is.

41
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,806
Well, all right, then.

42
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,062
Three cents.
That stuff's worth
more than that.

43
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,607
Shut up!
I say what things
are worth around here.

44
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,359
Who's next?

45
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,113
Hello, little girl.
Come on.

46
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,699
Shut up!
Shut up!

47
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,590
You done fine.
Nine cents.

48
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,554
Three, five, nine.

49
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,935
There you are,
an extra penny

50
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,770
because you're a nice,
little girl.

51
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,690
That's better.
I sure wish Carney
liked to pinch boys.

52
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,525
Nine and my
pinching penny.

53
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,945
Thirty-nine!
It's a pencil!

54
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,073
Give me one.

55
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,331
Twenty-six.
A pen wiper.

56
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,874
Something you want,
little girl?

57
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,669
I'm merely looking,
thank you.
I have a right.

58
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,254
I have money.

59
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,594
Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

60
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,597
Here she comes!
Cheese it!

61
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,571
Neeley. Neeley,
we gotta go home!

62
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,655
Beat it!

63
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,698
Mama said.

64
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,908
Mama said!
Mama said!

65
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,453
I'll beat you!

66
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,620
No, you won't!

67
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,625
For heaven's sake.
Is it that late already?

68
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,546
Well, I guess
I'll just let these
stairs go till later.

69
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,506
Four cents, Mom.
That's pretty good.

70
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,632
Dump the bucket, Neeley.

71
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,717
Mama, can I...

72
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,552
No. Dump the bucket
and bring it.

73
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,139
Today's the day for
the insurance collector

74
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,600
and I certainly don't
want him to catch me
looking like this.

75
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,726
Hot, ain't it?

76
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,895
Yeah, but Christmas
will be here
before you know it.

77
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,481
I got enough troubles
without worrying about that.

78
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,815
How's your sister
today, Henny?

79
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,192
Poorly, thank you.

80
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,825
Well, hello,
Flossie, dear.

81
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,412
Hello, Mrs. Nolan.
Don't you notice
something?

82
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,914
You look like you
was feeling better,

83
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,582
much better.
Don't you, Francie?

84
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,834
No, I don't!
I don't!

85
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,091
Heat up the coffee
while I fix up.

86
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,762
Right there.
That's better.

87
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,361
Mom?
Yes, Neeley?

88
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,906
Mom, if there was a rule
about something,

89
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,367
that doesn't mean
you couldn't do something
else once in a while.

90
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,121
Neeley, you cannot have
any of those pennies
to buy an ice cream cone.

91
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,332
They go in the bank,
the same as usual.
Bring them in here, Neeley.

92
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,378
Half of everything we get
goes into that bank.

93
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,505
That's the way it is
and that's the way
it's gotta be, now.

94
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,756
Put 'em in there.

95
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,385
Gosh, I bet we got
about $100 in that
old bank by now.

96
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:50,970
Nine's more like it.

97
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,224
Mama! Mama,
they're cutting
the tree!

98
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,730
Oh, that's too bad.

99
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,651
It was kind of pretty there
with birds sitting
in it sometimes.

100
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,236
Papa loved that tree.

101
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,322
Quit mooning over it.
It got in the way
of the washing.

102
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,658
A tree ain't gonna put
no pennies in the bank.

103
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,952
It's Mr. Barker.

104
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,748
Get out the good
cup and saucer
and give it a wipe.

105
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,667
And, Francie,
you can stay
in the room,

106
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,586
if you want,
while Mr. Barker's here.

107
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,964
How do you do,
Mr. Barker?

108
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,132
How do you do,
Francie?

109
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,843
Mama is temporarily detained,
but will join you directly.

110
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,344
Hello, Neeley.
Hello.

111
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,014
Why, Francie,
you got manners
right out of a book.

112
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,307
And company
or no company,

113
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,100
Mrs. Nolan always
looks the lady.

114
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,477
You should see
some of my people,

115
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,479
even ladies with husbands
that work steady.

116
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,482
Won't you go into the parlor
and have a cup of coffee?

117
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,194
That, I will.
And your hospitality
is very kind, Mrs. Nolan.

118
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,530
Well, old man Gentry's
off to jail again.

119
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,990
That's too bad.

120
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,117
But she's keeping up
his insurance
just the same.

121
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,704
And here's ours.
Ten cents for me,
10 cents for Mr. Nolan,

122
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,039
a nickel for each
of the children.

123
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,874
And you'll never
regret it, Mrs. Nolan.

124
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,960
A fine funeral
for every member of
the family, heaven forbid.

125
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,213
And now
your weekly receipts,
Mrs. Nolan.

126
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,465
Now there's one party
not far from here,

127
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,509
I wouldn't like to say who,
that didn't get no receipts
this week.

128
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,803
And naming no names,
I will say

129
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,305
that it's a family
that the angel of death

130
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,891
has marked on
his invitation list.
Heaven forbid.

131
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,435
Henny says his sister's
got one foot in the grave.

132
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,437
Neeley!

133
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,897
It'll mean
Potter's Field,
most likely.

134
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,148
Thank you, Francie.

135
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,858
Well, that's
what people get.

136
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,903
Wasting good money
to give her dresses
instead of insurance.

137
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,863
Dresses that'll last
longer than she will.

138
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,282
All depends on
what folks thinks
is important.

139
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,492
Papa says dresses...

140
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,660
That's right,
Mr. Barker.

141
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,120
It all depends on
what folks thinks
is important.

142
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,458
And how is Mr. Nolan?
Is he working
or not working?

143
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,670
Some tell me one thing,
some another.
Of course, I don't listen.

144
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,589
Mr. Nolan,
being a singing waiter,
Mr. Barker,

145
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,840
and what you might
call an artist,

146
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,176
his work don't come steady
like other people's.

147
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,762
But I'm sure
you'll remember when
you talk to folks

148
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,348
that the Nolans
have always paid
their insurance on the dot.

149
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,058
You surely don't
think I go around

150
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,102
spreading gossip
about my clients,
Mrs. Nolan.

151
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,938
Sure not.
And how's my mother,
Mr. Barker?

152
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,941
In the prime,
Mrs. Nolan.
Fine as can be.

153
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,693
And she says
to tell you
she'll be over...

154
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,779
Over tonight,
same as usual.

155
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,242
And I trust
you're pleased with
the news about your sister.

156
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,620
Just which news
do you mean,
Mr. Barker?

157
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,581
Well, now,
she must be saving it to
surprise you with tonight

158
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,166
when the family's
all here together.

159
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,003
I'd take it kindly
if you told me
what you mean.

160
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,173
Well, I trot around,
same as usual,
to collect her weekly dime

161
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,675
and what do you
think happens?

162
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,927
Well, sir,
she gives me
two dimes.

163
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,471
Yes, sir,
she's done it again.

164
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,724
She's got herself
a brand-new husband.

165
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,142
Oh, no!

166
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,686
Well, now, I suppose
you mean about her
still being married.

167
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,063
I don't mind saying
I had the same
thought myself.

168
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,065
But I'm sure
it must be all right.

169
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,192
She must have made
some arrangement.

170
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,320
I'm quite sure she did,
Mr. Barker.

171
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,572
Does she call
this one Bill, too?

172
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,408
You children run along now
and do the marketing.

173
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,493
Go on.
Take some money
from the cup

174
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,580
and get
a five-cent soup bone
off of Hassler's.

175
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,332
Don't get the chopped meat
from him, though.

176
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,043
He grinds it
behind closed doors
and heaven only knows.

177
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,502
Go to Werner's
for the meat.

178
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,172
Ask for round steak,
chopped, 10 cents' worth.

179
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,007
And don't let him
give it to you
off the plate.

180
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,760
Take an onion, Neeley!
And ask him to chop it in.

181
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,013
And then just at the last,
ask for a piece of suet
to fry it with.

182
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,556
But he won't always
do that, Mama.

183
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,058
Tell him
your mama said.

184
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,225
And then go
for the bread.

185
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,352
It's Saturday, Mom.

186
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,437
All right.
Ask for a nice pie,
not too crushed.

187
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,064
Now, go on.
But, Mama, we know

188
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,690
Aunt Sissy's been
married before.

189
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,692
Sure. I can remember
two Uncle Bills.

190
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,027
That's nothing for
you to talk about.

191
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,945
Now run along now
and get things done.

192
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,038
You got no right, Mr. Barker,
to be carrying tales
about my sister

193
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,873
as though there were
something wrong.

194
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:52,336
She may be funny some ways,
but she wouldn't do
nothing wrong,

195
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,214
so I'd like it
if you didn't talk to
people like it was.

196
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,674
Strike me dead
if I'd ever think of
mentioning it to anyone

197
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,884
but you, Mrs. Nolan.

198
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,010
Yeah, sure. I know.

199
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,973
Well, you might
as well go on now
and tell me what you do know.

200
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,893
No point in my being
the only one
who don't hear it.

201
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,269
Well...

202
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,563
Ten cents' worth
of round steak?
You want it ground?

203
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,190
No, thank you.
You're sure now?

204
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,734
It wasn't 20 minutes ago
I ground that
whole plateful fresh.

205
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:16,985
No, thank you.

206
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,955
Oh, I forgot.
My mama wants it ground.

207
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,666
You don't tell me.

208
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,836
And she said to
chop that in with it.

209
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,796
She did?

210
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,014
And a piece of suet
to fry it with,
Mama said.

211
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,143
Sweet jumping
Christopher!

212
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,941
Olives!
Sweet potatoes!

213
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,280
You know, Mama thinks
we don't know anything.

214
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,657
Yeah. She acts
like we were kids
or something.

215
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,577
I bet she has a fight
with Aunt Sissy tonight.

216
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,371
It's got
something to do with men
like Aunt Sissy too much.

217
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,291
But Papa says
we ought to make
everybody like us.

218
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,293
I guess maybe
ladies shouldn't.

219
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,462
Maybe Aunt Sissy
wouldn't have changed
husbands so much

220
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,297
if any of her babies
would've lived.

221
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,048
She's crazy
about babies.

222
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,135
Look who's talking
about babies.
A lot you know.

223
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,428
I know as much
as you do.

224
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,637
You don't know nothing.

225
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,348
You think you're so smart.
Boys make me sick!

226
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,683
What do you think
girls make people?

227
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,976
Here she comes!

228
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,645
Come on!

229
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,908
Mister,
give us a white bread.

230
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,993
Six loaves!

231
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,620
And a pie,
not too crushed!

232
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,707
This bread's fine.
I wouldn't be surprised

233
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,167
if wasn't more
than three days old.

234
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,752
Is that all, Mom?
Can we go now?

235
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,003
Yes, you're free.

236
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,843
Where's the fire?

237
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,178
There's a scout for
the Brooklyns around.

238
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,804
They're looking
for a catcher.

239
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,057
Where are you going?
No place much.

240
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,267
Well, don't go
dream walking
crossing the street.

241
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,991
"Browning."

242
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,953
"B-U... Burton."

243
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,580
Anatomy of Melancholy.

244
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,846
Burton's
Anatomy of Melancholy.

245
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,025
Burton's
Anatomy of Melancholy?

246
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,443
Are you sure
you want this?

247
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,528
Yes, ma'am.

248
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,238
Don't you think
it's a trifle
over your head?

249
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,447
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,657
Well, then,
why did you select it?

251
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,412
Well,
I've read all the authors
beginning with "A"

252
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,373
and all the "B's"
down to Burton.
It's next.

253
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,418
You mean you're trying
to read your way straight
through the library?

254
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,711
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,254
But a book like this,
you'll only be confused.

256
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,840
Please.
I wanna read clear
through the alphabet.

257
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,009
I want to know
everything in the world.

258
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,136
Well...

259
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,808
All right.
Only do something
for me, will you?

260
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,561
Take another book,
too. Here.

261
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,606
When Knighthood
Was in Flower,
just for fun.

262
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,609
It's Saturday.
I'll have a headache
thinking about you

263
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,528
wrestling with
The Anatomy of Melancholy
all weekend.

264
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,447
Will you?

265
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,240
Yes, ma'am.

266
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,754
A little more to the left,
Mr. Crackenbox!

267
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,797
You think I want
Mrs. Whittely's
baby clothes?

268
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,591
It's your wash,
your baby.

269
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,426
Don't forget
to fix mine,
Mr. Crackenbox!

270
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,722
Maybe you'd like
to come up here
and fix it yourselves

271
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,725
and that's just
what you'll be doing
if you don't shut up!

272
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,238
Mr. Crackenbox,
it still sags!

273
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,410
Now, Mr. Crackenbox,
get it just a little bit
higher, if you don't mind.

274
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,417
...her wheelbarrow

275
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,753
Through streets broad
and narrow

276
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:49,299
Crying cockles and mussels,
alive, alive-O

277
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,342
I won, I won!

278
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,344
Well, now,
I wouldn't be too sure
about that if I was you.

279
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,763
But I did! I got it open
before you finished
and that's the rules.

280
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,140
But I came up one flight
two steps at a time
before I remembered.

281
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,183
Don't that make
a difference?

282
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,309
No, sir.
The rules...

283
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,186
And in a manner of speaking,
you never did stop me at all

284
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,813
because my heart kept
right on singing.

285
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,523
Papa, you're joking.

286
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,941
Well, I guess
I'll let you get away

287
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,401
with winning this time,
prima donna.

288
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,444
And where's your
beautiful mama?
Finishing the hall.

289
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,363
She must be on the top floor
or she'd have heard you.

290
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,824
Well, in that case,
why ain't you
getting busy?

291
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,450
Why ain't you
laying out my clothes?

292
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,202
Papa,
you always make fun.

293
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,870
You know you haven't
any more clothes.

294
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,497
Haven't any
more clothes?

295
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,124
What's this?
A tie.

296
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,334
And this? And this?
A dickey. An apron.

297
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,212
Them's clothes, ain't they?
And you'd better be getting
that apron ironed, too.

298
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,880
Papa, you got a job
for tonight?

299
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,173
You see the palm
of that hand?

300
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,633
That's right where
I got the world tonight.

301
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,759
Where's the job, Papa?

302
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,594
Klommer's.
A big wedding party.

303
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,055
And you know something,
prima donna?
There'll be plenty of tips.

304
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,682
Singing or waiting?
Both.

305
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,392
Maybe tonight will be it.

306
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,145
Maybe tonight
he'll be there,
the impresario.

307
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,397
And he'll hear you sing,
and he'll put you
on the stage.

308
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,399
And why not?
Ain't I the Brooklyn Thrush?

309
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,568
Papa!

310
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,903
And now you'd better be
getting my apron ironed.

311
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,239
Have it in a jiffy, Papa.
The coffee's on.

312
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,657
That's my prima donna.

313
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,828
Early one morning
I heard a maiden singing

314
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,417
Oh, Papa, I can't sing.

315
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,544
Come on, now.
You're holding up
the singing.

316
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,882
Oh, don't deceive me
Oh, never leave me

317
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,134
And better singing
I never did hear.

318
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,178
I love to iron
for you, Papa.

319
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,180
You know something,
a day like this

320
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,931
is just like somebody
gave you a present.

321
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,516
Everything just right.

322
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,853
I wonder what people did
before they invented coffee.

323
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,356
This sure could be
a fine world if...

324
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,611
Hey, you know something,
prima donna?

325
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,946
You're going to make
somebody a mighty
fine wife someday.

326
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,072
Papa!

327
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:40,368
And very pretty, too.
That is, if your nose
doesn't grow crooked.

328
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,205
Could it really?
Honest?

329
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,625
No.
It's the prettiest nose
in all Brooklyn.

330
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,001
Papa, it isn't.

331
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,127
Who says it isn't?

332
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,129
You just tell me who said it
and I'll take care of him.

333
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,799
Papa, you're crazy.
And you know
something else?

334
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,760
You're not gonna be
ironing like this when
that impresario comes along.

335
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,845
Things are gonna be
different around here.
You wait and see.

336
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,222
Yes, Papa.
Hey.

337
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,598
What's the wish
you wish the most

338
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,016
when our ship
comes sailing in?

339
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,101
Well, it already
came true.

340
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,728
What is it?
Come on and tell me.

341
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,398
Well, I wished that when
you came home today

342
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,734
you wouldn't be sick.

343
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,908
Who told you to
call it "sick," baby?

344
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,161
You shouldn't
waste your wishes
on things like that.

345
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,873
You should be saving them
for a silk dress
or something.

346
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,376
Haven't you got
a better wish
than that?

347
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,586
Well...
Come on.

348
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,506
Well, I hope Mama won't be
too mad with Aunt Sissy.

349
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,299
What about Aunt Sissy?

350
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,262
She's gone and got herself
another husband again.

351
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,597
No!

352
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,934
No! Gee, if there
isn't a woman for you.

353
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,144
Hey. What did
your mama say?

354
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,604
Well,
she didn't like it.

355
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,189
Yeah.
I can imagine that.

356
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,359
Couldn't you sort of
say something to her,

357
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,319
not to be too mad
to Aunt Sissy?

358
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,738
That I could,
prima donna,
and that I will.

359
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,407
Thank you, Papa.

360
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,577
Now, haven't you got
just one little wish
for yourself?

361
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,205
Just one wish
just for you?

362
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,710
Well, did you
see it, Papa?
What?

363
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,921
Out the window,
our tree,
they've killed it!

364
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,845
Well, will you
look at that, now?

365
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,639
They didn't have
any right to kill it,
did they, Papa?

366
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,894
Now, wait a minute.
They didn't kill it.

367
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,605
Why, they couldn't
kill that tree.
Honest?

368
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,231
Why, sure, baby.

369
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,817
Don't tell me
that tree's gonna lay down
and die that easy.

370
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,237
Look at that tree.
See where
it's coming from?

371
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,655
Right up
out of the cement.

372
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,910
Didn't nobody plant it.
It didn't ask
the cement could it grow.

373
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,369
It just couldn't help
growing so much,

374
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,121
it pushed that old cement
right out of the way.

375
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,707
But when you're busting
with something like that,
can't anybody help it.

376
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:56,504
Like, like that
little old bird up there.
Listen to him.

377
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,719
He didn't ask anybody
could he sing.

378
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,846
And he certainly
didn't take any lessons.

379
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,974
He's so full of singing
it's just got to
bust out someplace.

380
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,602
Why, they could
cut that old tree
right down to the ground

381
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,063
and a root would push up
someplace else in the cement.

382
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,190
You wait till spring,
prima donna,
and you'll see.

383
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,028
Well, this ain't winning
the family bread, huh?

384
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,743
Come on. Ain't you got
one nice, little wish
just for yourself?

385
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,665
No, Papa. I just...

386
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,458
Just what?

387
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,794
I just love you
so much, Papa!

388
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,174
Well, what do you know?

389
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,135
Listen.

390
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,681
If I make a lot of
tips tonight, you know
what I'm gonna do?

391
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,016
What, Papa?

392
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:53,186
I'm gonna put two bucks
on the nose of a horse
I know is running Monday.

393
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,898
And I'll win 10.
Then I'll put it
on another horse.

394
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,984
If I use my head
and I'm lucky,

395
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,902
I'll run it up
to 500 bucks.

396
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,738
Then you know
what I'm gonna do?
What, Papa?

397
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,075
I'm gonna
take you on a trip,

398
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,078
just you and me
on a regular train.

399
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,289
Maybe we'll go down south
and see the cotton.

400
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,376
You know,
down where them
cotton blossoms blow.

401
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,588
Way down
upon the Swanee River

402
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,341
Far, far away

403
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,636
You're a nice girl, baby.

404
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,889
Come on! We'll go up
and tell your mama
the news about my job!

405
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,606
Anybody seen
Johnny Nolan's wife?

406
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,527
Johnny, you all right?
And why not?

407
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,279
Ain't I married to
the most beautiful lady

408
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,406
in all Williamsburg,
Brooklyn?

409
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,949
Well, you're shouting
it so loud

410
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,367
they'll hear you
over to Manhattan.

411
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,327
Don't you get fresh
with me tonight,
Mrs. Nolan.

412
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,204
Happens I'm working Klommer's
big wedding party.

413
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,331
I thought you looked
kinda extra dressy.

414
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,208
I guess you won't get home
until the sun comes up.

415
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,543
The later, the better.
The more tips,

416
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,212
the more fine silk stockings
for my wife's pretty legs.

417
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,298
Silk stockings is
just what I need!

418
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,133
Now, just a minute,
Mrs. Nolan.

419
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,468
Ain't you gonna give me
a kiss for luck?

420
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,927
The whole house
is looking.

421
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,180
Sure. I know
they're looking,
but who cares?

422
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,723
This is the finest job
I had in months.

423
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,099
Maybe I'll get
more from tonight.

424
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,727
You better get on with it.
Good jobs don't wait.

425
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,979
But the job's no good
without you. Kiss me.

426
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,988
Well, you still
got a way with you,
Johnny Nolan.

427
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,074
Now, go on!
Get out of here!

428
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,575
Before you know it,
the folks at that wedding

429
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,077
will be an old,
married couple.

430
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,745
Before you know it,
I won't go at all.

431
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,371
Theirs ain't the only
marriage that counts.

432
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,581
Take your hat
and get out of here

433
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,583
before someone else
cops that job!

434
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,880
Our Francie was
telling me that

435
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,174
Sissy's gone
and done it again.

436
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,844
Well, maybe
he's a nice fella.

437
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,305
Don't be too hard
on her, huh?

438
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,141
They was all nice fellas.
Beat it, now, Johnny.

439
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,936
That's just a sample, madam.

440
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,646
If you like my stock,
drop me a card

441
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,148
and I'll be back again.
Good evening.

442
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:10,698
Well, will you look
at our beautiful
princess tonight

443
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,451
in a brand-new gown.

444
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:14,869
It's made out of silk.

445
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:15,954
Silk?

446
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,123
Don't you tell me that.

447
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,251
This dress is made
out of flower petals
and birds' wings

448
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,837
and a little old
piece of cloud.

449
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,006
Anybody can tell that.

450
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,636
Good evening,
Mr. Spencer.

451
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,762
Working tonight,
Johnny?

452
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,472
Yeah. Big wedding party.

453
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,766
Good evening,
Miss Lizzie, Miss Maggie.

454
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,102
You're looking fine
today, Mr. Nolan.
Indeed, you are.

455
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,311
Thank you, ladies.

456
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,438
Here comes the bride
Here...

457
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,482
Good evening,
young ladies.
Good evening.

458
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,692
Allow me, princess.

459
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,277
Blackberries!

460
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,863
I got blackberries!

461
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,032
Hi, Mr. Ching.
Hello.

462
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,869
What did Mama say
about Aunt Sissy?
Now don't worry about it.

463
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,245
Everything's
gonna be all right.

464
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,539
Your Aunt Sissy's
a fine woman, Francie.

465
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,417
Look at them things!

466
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,590
There's no use talking.
Someday I'm gonna
buy you them skates.

467
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,508
Mama says not to be
too late, Papa.

468
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,468
Look.
God invented time.

469
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:15,013
And when he invents something,
there's always plenty of it.

470
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,389
There's your car, Papa.

471
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,099
Boy!
Look at them knives!

472
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,851
Mama says
time is money.

473
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,687
I guess he wasn't
worrying much about
money right then.

474
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,480
There's your car, Papa.

475
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,357
Well, I might
as well catch it.

476
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:43,166
Ice! Any ice today?

477
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,877
Supper's ready.

478
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,128
Hey. Am I hungry!

479
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,088
And when
weren't you hungry?
Mama?

480
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,215
Yes, Francie?

481
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,341
What does white mean?

482
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:54,677
Just white, I guess.
What do you mean
what does it mean?

483
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,429
Neeley, sit down
at your place.

484
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,264
Why do girls always wear it
when they're married

485
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,433
and when they're confirmed
and when they graduate?

486
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,477
Why does it always
have to be white?

487
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,647
Just one of those things
somebody started.
Lots of things like that.

488
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,565
Will I have
a white dress
when I graduate?

489
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,360
We'll see.
Neeley will probably have
to have shoes by that time.

490
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,445
But, Mama.
Well, talk to him
about it.

491
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,073
If you can get him
to quit coming through
the soles of his shoes.

492
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:18,243
It's just because he's a boy.
All right, Mama.

493
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,871
I will gladly do without
so my little brother
can be happy with new shoes.

494
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,581
Little brother, my eye!

495
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,292
That'll do! Francie,
you read too much.

496
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,961
Well, hey, everybody.

497
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,587
Hi, Aunt Sissy!
What did you bring us?

498
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,673
I brung myself,
chickabiddies.
Ain't that enough?

499
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,549
And a couple of magazines
from the dentist's.

500
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,760
What does he need
'em for or me, either.

501
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,263
I can't read
like my educated
little niece here.

502
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,597
Hello, Katie,
my darling.

503
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,268
Good evening, Sissy.

504
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,192
Well, you look
fine, Katie.

505
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,153
Yeah, I look fine.

506
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,322
Who spilled the beans?

507
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,700
I forgot.
It was old Barker's
day here.

508
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,494
Where's Johnny?
I was kinda counting on him
to be in my corner.

509
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,954
Sure. You and Johnny.

510
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,247
Look, Katie,
I didn't tell you

511
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,707
because I wanted to
bring Bill around.

512
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,876
But I couldn't.
He's home sleeping.
He's a milkman, see?

513
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,548
Listen. You're gonna
wish me happiness,
ain't you?

514
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,593
Naturally, I'm going
to wish you happiness
this time, too.

515
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,346
Golly, why can't
you skip to the part
where you forgive me?

516
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,889
You're going to
before you're through.

517
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,391
You know
I'll get around to
you in the end.

518
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,727
Why can't you
just be human now
and get it over with?

519
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,856
There ain't no one
like you to get around
a person in the whole world,

520
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,149
unless it's Johnny.

521
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,401
You're in time for pie.
Go on now and sit down!

522
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,237
That's more like it.
That's my kid sister talking.

523
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,657
Just coffee for me.
I gotta get home soon
and fix breakfast for Bill.

524
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,160
Breakfast? At night?
Yeah. Ain't it a riot?

525
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,079
We sleep all day long
with the shades pulled down
to keep out the sun

526
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,165
and the windows shut
to keep out the noise.

527
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,042
It's fun.
You don't live
like nobody else.

528
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,376
No, you sure don't.

529
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,629
Easy on the whip, kid.
Wait till you meet my Bill.
You and him will...

530
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,716
Wouldn't you marry nobody
if they wasn't named Bill,
Aunt Sis?

531
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,260
She might not
remember them
if they wasn't.

532
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,056
Bill's got some other name.
Steve, I think it is.

533
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,349
But I always liked Bill.

534
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,809
A good man's name
with no stuck-up
about it.

535
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,520
You'll be crazy
about him, Katie.
Yeah?

536
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,065
But the question is
how will him
and you get along?

537
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,984
It's wrong, Sissy.
I mean, the others...

538
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,152
The others was wrong.

539
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,862
What's right about
keeping on with a guy

540
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,197
when you don't love
each other anymore?

541
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,573
But it ain't
as easy as that.

542
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,618
I think Aunt Sissy's right
about when love is dead.

543
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,454
Now, look
what you started.

544
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,581
It ain't nothing
to talk about
in front of them.

545
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,792
Every time you come here,
you fill their heads with...

546
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,798
Go on downstairs
for a while, kids.

547
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,257
Your mama's got
a spanking up
her sleeve

548
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,926
and she ain't
gonna feel right
until somebody gets it.

549
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,594
Might as well
get it over with.

550
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:46,432
You don't wanna frown
like that, snuggle pup.

551
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,143
The fellas don't go
for that at all.

552
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,487
All right, kid.
Let's have it,
the works.

553
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,614
I'm a disgrace.
You don't know what
you're gonna do with me.

554
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,824
You can hardly
face the neighbors

555
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:03,991
with what they
must be saying.

556
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,410
I'm old enough
to know better.

557
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,744
Go on. Get it all
off your chest,

558
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:07,995
then we can make up
and forget about it.

559
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,082
That's right.
Talk your way out of it.
You probably will, too.

560
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,291
What'd Mama have to say?

561
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,668
You know Mama.
She don't say much.

562
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,420
Sure. I know Mama.

563
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,463
"Sissy is bad only where
the men are concerned,

564
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,090
"but she's good
in her heart."

565
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,926
But that ain't it, Sissy.
People got a right to talk.

566
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,262
And the kids
are bound to hear,
and it ain't right for them.

567
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,889
And you can get in trouble.
You ain't real sure
what happened,

568
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,266
and there's laws about...

569
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,809
Katie, so help me,
this time it's for keeps.

570
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,228
I ain't even gonna
look at another guy.

571
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,439
And as for the last one,
he can't be alive

572
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,232
or I would have
heard from him.

573
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,900
I've been pretty good.

574
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,862
Seven years is a long time
to wait around
not being married.

575
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,866
They said all you had to wait
was seven years and I waited.

576
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,409
For the life of me,

577
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,952
I don't know
what you're trying to
talk yourself into,

578
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,454
but I got a feeling
it ain't right.

579
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,872
All I know is
it can't be wrong,

580
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,373
or I wouldn't feel
like I do about it.

581
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,168
I'm dumb, sure,
but I know this much,

582
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,171
if I feel bad
about something,
it's wrong.

583
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,756
If I feel good,
it's right.

584
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:05,720
You wouldn't get it, Katie.
You got all the breaks
I never had.

585
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,306
You got the kids
and you got a guy

586
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,558
you're clear
overboard about.
You're lucky.

587
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,227
Yeah, and where does
crazy over somebody get you?

588
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,855
It don't put
no pennies in the bank.

589
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,566
It don't buy
no clothes for the kids
to go to school in.

590
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,403
Maybe you got it better
not sticking to one guy.

591
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,741
I wish, sometimes,
I wasn't so crazy over him.

592
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,909
Hey, Katie.

593
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,161
I won't have the kids
taking after him, either.

594
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,831
Him and those
dreamy ways of his
I used to think were so fine.

595
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,083
Not if I gotta cut it
right out of their hearts!

596
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,085
Katie,
what are you saying?

597
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,256
I don't know.

598
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,592
Yes, you do.
You're saying plenty.

599
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,678
What's happened
between you and Johnny?

600
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,889
I don't know
what I'm saying.

601
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,766
I don't know
what's come over me.

602
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,601
Look, hon,
it's time we found out.

603
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,561
Sure we got something
to talk about now.
I don't wanna.

604
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,105
Uh-uh.
You're the kid sister.
You listen now.

605
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,400
You was awful
crazy about Johnny.

606
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,152
Don't tell me.
I seen you.

607
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,029
It was like every woman
wants to be with a guy.

608
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,447
Yeah.
All right,

609
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,450
maybe Johnny
didn't turn out
just like you figured.

610
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,996
Sure, he drinks and all,
and you're the one who's had
to make most of the living,

611
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,790
but everybody's
got something.

612
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,625
And you wasn't
crazy about Johnny

613
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,960
because he was
gonna be a banker.

614
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,837
It was on
account of...

615
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,839
Well, on account of
how he laughed

616
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,718
and how you felt
walking down the street
holding on to him

617
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,720
and having other
women look at you.

618
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,557
And the way he could
talk about things

619
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,435
and the way
he had of saying hello
to everybody

620
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,938
like he was giving
away something.

621
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,941
That's what
you was crazy about,
and that ain't changed.

622
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,654
I don't know.
Them things couldn't
change in Johnny,

623
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,365
not even if he tried.

624
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:54,328
He's just
different, kinda.
He always was.

625
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,206
But he ain't changed.

626
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,962
If there's been
any changing, hon,
maybe it's you.

627
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,508
You still got all
you was crazy over,
ain't you?

628
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,051
Yeah.

629
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,095
Then thank your lucky stars
for what you got,
Katie Nolan,

630
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,763
and take the rest
along with it!

631
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:17,184
And you got a lot,
you can take it from me.
Don't think you haven't.

632
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:23,274
I might have known,
starting out to
take you apart,

633
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,901
I'd wind up with you
making me over.

634
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,321
Nice going.

635
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:32,199
Don't stir yourself, pal.
Thank you.

636
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,367
Better go inside,
Alfred.

637
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,619
How'd you come out,
Aunt Sis?

638
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:38,456
No decision. It was a draw.
Your mom's bark
is worse than her bite.

639
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,627
Look, tell me something.
When Papa's home, I bet...

640
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,004
I bet him and Mama
laugh aplenty, don't they?

641
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,797
You know,
like they always did?

642
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,967
Sure. Pop can make
anybody laugh
when he wants to,

643
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,385
except when he's drunk.

644
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,346
"Sick," Neeley,
Mama said to call it!

645
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,639
Okay. "Sick," then.

646
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,808
Look, hon. Tell you
what you can do for me.

647
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,477
Do all the laughing you can.

648
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,520
You know,
keeps everybody healthy.

649
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:02,647
Okay.

650
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,107
Laughter is the singing
of the angels.

651
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:08,653
You're a funny kid,
head full of
all them things,

652
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,029
kinda like your pop.

653
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,864
She tells lies
like Pop, too.

654
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,157
He does not tell lies!

655
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,325
Well, I don't know
what you call 'em.

656
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,451
Time out!

657
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,245
I've had enough battling
to last me for today.
Where did you get the skates?

658
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,040
They aren't ours.
Papa said he'd
get us some, though.

659
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,501
He didn't mean it.
He just said that.

660
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,378
He did, too, mean it,
Neeley Nolan, and...

661
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,254
Easy now!

662
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,507
Kinda like your pop,
don't you, hon?

663
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,093
He does mean it,
doesn't he,
Aunt Sissy?

664
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,012
Sure, he means it.
He means it,
every word.

665
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:39,308
But, well, you know,
sometimes things happen.

666
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,436
But it kinda
ain't his fault. He...

667
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,021
I tell you what.

668
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:47,400
Let's make out like Johnny
gave you them skates like
he said and they're yours.

669
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,068
Ain't gonna hurt nobody.
Aunt Sissy!

670
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,195
No sense
in them things standin' around
and nobody usin' them.

671
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,279
Come on.

672
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,660
Here we go. Easy now.

673
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,911
Isn't that fun? Huh?

674
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,287
Can I put them on next,
Aunt Sissy?

675
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,373
Sure, you can.
Mama! Mama! Mama!

676
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,958
Hey! You come back
here with my skates!

677
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,543
She's not gonna hurt 'em.

678
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:06,877
Bring back
my daughter's skates!

679
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,421
You was the one
that put them kids
up to it!

680
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,715
Easy now! Nobody's hurt.
We only borrowed them.

681
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,133
She's not going
off with them, Effie!

682
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,385
Don't you dare
take up with that
woman like that!

683
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,721
You poor little guy.
Do you put up
with that all the time?

684
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,598
Hey, Officer!
Come on over here!

685
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:20,766
Now this woman here,
she tried to...

686
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,017
Break it up.
Take it easy.

687
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,686
I'm sure glad
you come along,
handsome.

688
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,313
You look like you could
whip a bunch of women
into line.

689
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,566
Well, that's fine,
but now I suppose
somebody tells me

690
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,109
what all the
excitement's about.

691
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,736
She tried to steal
my little girl's skates!

692
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,112
She tried to nab her.

693
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,239
We only borrowed them
for just a minute.
Honest.

694
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,907
That's right.
There wasn't nobody
using them.

695
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,161
And a little fun and frolic
on a Saturday
never hurt nobody.

696
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,912
Bet you know
all about that,
don't ya?

697
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,957
If you think
you're gonna get out of it
making eyes at the law...

698
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,421
I don't know what
the world's coming to!

699
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,630
Get back a little bit,
buddy, huh?

700
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:52,798
This lady
is my sister.

701
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:56,218
She didn't mean any harm,
I'm quite sure she didn't.

702
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,307
Well, as far as I can see,
there's been no harm done.

703
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,143
Now, just break it up.
Run along.
Go to your homes.

704
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:08,314
Go on. You, too.
Go on, buddy.
Run along.

705
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,611
Now, suppose
I see you women
to your home?

706
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,362
Thanks, handsome.

707
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,624
My sister's always trying
to be funny, Officer.

708
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,959
She don't mean
nothin' by it.

709
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,586
I'd like you to know
this is the first time

710
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,881
that any of my family
ever got into any
trouble on the street.

711
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,387
And I'll see to it
that it don't happen again.

712
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,057
I guess I know a lady
when I see one, ma'am.

713
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,143
I'm glad
I've been of service
to you, ma'am.

714
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,897
He sure took a shine
to you, Katie.

715
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,816
Go on.
Who'd look at me?

716
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,275
He would.

717
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,737
Funny. Sometimes you kinda
forget you are a woman.

718
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,322
He wasn't gonna
arrest us, Mama.

719
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,740
Aunt Sissy
talked him out of it.

720
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:03,869
And we got to
skate on them anyway,
didn't we, Aunt Sissy?

721
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,664
You go inside and tell Sheila
and her mama you're sorry.

722
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,457
Do I have to, Mama?

723
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,840
I don't like to say to you
what I'm going to, Sissy.

724
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,467
Golly, are we gonna
start that again?

725
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,511
You're the only
sister I got.

726
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,515
I don't care what
people say about you
for myself,

727
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,850
but I got the kids
to worry about,

728
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,018
and if I don't
worry about them,
nobody else will.

729
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,065
Well, you're bad
for them, Sissy.

730
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,277
What are you
trying to say, kid?

731
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,280
I don't want you
to come around
here no more.

732
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,865
My mind's made up,
so don't try to change it

733
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,033
with any of that
soft talk of yours.

734
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,372
Why, I won't, Katie,
not if you mean it.

735
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,208
But let's keep on
talking about you.

736
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,211
Soft's one thing,
but hard's another.

737
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,922
All right,
it ain't nice
to be hard.

738
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,300
But my kids
is gonna be somebody

739
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,386
if I gotta turn
into granite rock
to make 'em!

740
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,931
I wish you hadn't
said that, kid.

741
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,603
Bye, Katie.

742
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:21,405
"And Nahor lived
nine and 20 years
and begat Terah.

743
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,659
"And Nahor lived
after he begat
Terah 119 years."

744
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,661
Boy. That's older
than Grandma, ain't it?

745
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,496
"And begat sons
and daughters."

746
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,832
Okay. That's the end
of the page.

00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,794
"'I would not from thee.'

749
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,589
"Cressida.
'Night hath been
too brief.'

750
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,216
"Troilus.
'Beshrew the witch!
With venomous..."'

751
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,427
That ain't even English!
It is, too!

752
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,304
Shakespeare wrote
the best English
of anybody!

753
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,474
All right, then you
tell me what it means,
you're so smart.

754
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,684
I didn't say
I know what it means.
I said I liked it.

755
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:51,810
That'll do.

756
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,063
Okay, but I bet
you don't know
what it means, either.

757
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,523
Maybe not, but I do know
it's good for you.

758
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,775
"Beshrew the witch!
With venomous..."

759
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:58,984
She don't know
what it means.

760
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:02,279
Mom don't know what it means.
Grandma can't even read.

761
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,656
And gosh knows
I don't know what it...

762
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,032
Mama,
I can't read if he...

763
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,034
Just wasting time
every night reading stuff

764
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,286
nobody knows
what it's all about.

765
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,456
Now, listen.
Your Aunt Sissy
brought that Bible

766
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,792
all the way from
Sheepshead Bay,

767
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,337
and your papa blew in
all his tips one time
on that Shakespeare

768
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,047
'cause Grandma said
they was the greatest book

769
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,051
and you should read
from 'em every night,
so ya ain't gonna waste them.

770
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,638
I don't know.
Sometimes it does
seem kind of foolish,

771
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,932
but it might
get you somewhere.

772
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,309
Might even get
you a job someday,
who can tell?

773
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:36,063
This reading
will not stop.
I say this thing.

774
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:42,194
To this new land,
your grandfather and I
came very long ago now

775
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:46,490
because we heard that here
is something very good.

776
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:52,037
Hard we worked, very hard,
but we could not find
this thing.

777
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:57,376
For a long time,
I do not understand,
and then I know.

778
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,254
When I am old, I know.

779
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,007
In that old country,

780
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:07,761
a child can rise
no higher than
his father's state.

781
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,056
But here,
in this place,

782
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:16,770
each one is free to go
as far as he's good
to make of himself.

783
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:21,775
This way,
the child can be better
than the parent

784
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,155
and this is the true way
things grow better.

785
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,035
And this
has to do something
with the learning,

786
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,621
which is here
free to all people.

787
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:38,125
I, who am old,
miss this thing.

788
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,461
My children
miss this thing.

789
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:44,840
But my children's children
shall not miss it.

790
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,092
This reading
will not stop.

791
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,473
And, you, Katie.

792
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,229
It is not only for the job
that this is good,

793
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:03,692
but for the true things
inside of us.

794
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,904
You don't think
well about this,

795
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,573
nor about what you do
with your sister.

796
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,995
You have forgotten
to think with your heart.

797
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:20,542
There is a coldness
growing in you, Katie.

798
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,766
"Beshrew the witch!
With venomous
wights she stays

799
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,686
"As tediously as hell,
but flies
the grasps of love"

800
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,857
In Dublin's fair city
Where the girls are so pretty

801
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:48,278
I first set my eyes
on sweet Molly Malone

802
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,864
As she wheeled
her wheelbarrow

803
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,325
Through streets
broad and narrow

804
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:58,705
Crying cockles and mussels,
alive, alive-O

805
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,710
Alive, alive-O
Alive, alive-O

806
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:07,631
Crying cockles and mussels,
alive, alive-O

807
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,968
It's all right, Mama.
I don't think he's sick.

808
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,512
Alive, alive-O
Alive, alive-O

809
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,721
Papa!

810
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,975
Well, what do you know?
If it ain't my beauty.

811
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:22,271
Hey. What are you doing up
this time of night?

812
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,983
I just made up my mind
to wait up for you.

813
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,068
I guess I ain't used
to the hours anymore.

814
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,404
No. Leave it.
It's nice.

815
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,656
Go on.

816
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,075
Francie, coffee.

817
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,326
Is it something
to eat, Papa?

818
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,246
And what else,
with me coming from
a grand banquet?

819
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,373
I got some
French rolls,

820
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,794
a whole half
a broiled lobster from
the shores of Maryland,

821
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:47,921
fried oysters,

822
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,716
caviar from far-off,
sunny Russia,

823
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,511
and cheese from
the mountain fastnesses
of la belle France.

824
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,600
What do you know about
the mountain fastnesses
of France?

825
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,185
Is it better coming
from there, Papa?

826
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,895
Well, it's supposed
to be mighty good,

827
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,939
but coming home like this,
I know that's good.

828
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:10,485
Well, let's eat it.
No reason we shouldn't
have a party of our own.

829
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:15,866
I'm hungry.

830
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,202
Is that all
you got to say
to your papa?

831
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,745
Hello, Pop.

832
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,706
His stomach's
like the Irish Sea,
no bottom to it.

833
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,833
Mama,
your wedding comb!

834
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,462
Well, ain't this
a kind of weddin' party?

835
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,049
You bet it is.

836
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,760
I wish I could have
swiped some champagne.

837
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,304
Oh, no, I don't.
Coffee's better.

838
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,056
But, look who's
telling me

839
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,808
I don't know about them
mountain fastnesses
of France.

840
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,519
That.
Yeah, that.
Imagine you forgetting.

841
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:48,398
Well, I didn't forget,
not exactly.
It was a long time ago.

842
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,775
What do you think of
a mama that forgets

843
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,068
where she went
on her honeymoon?

844
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,444
Did you really
go there, Mama?

845
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,820
Of course not.
Your papa's joking.

846
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,489
Sure we did,
or just the same as.

847
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,242
We spent
our honeymoon in a school.
It was as big as a palace.

848
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,078
We just worked there nights,
the two of us, cleaning.

849
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,080
It was right here
in Brooklyn,
before you was born.

850
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,165
That ain't what you
told me then.

851
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,668
You mean to say
when we was having
our supper there alone

852
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,419
and I used to
pull down them maps

853
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,796
and take
the teacher's pointer

854
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,756
and pick out the places
we'd pretend
we was that night,

855
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,925
you mean to say
we really wasn't there?

856
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:19,221
You mean you forgot
that sunny France
was where we liked the best?

857
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,432
And all the laughing
we used to do there?

858
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,310
You're gonna sit
right down and tell me
we really wasn't there?

859
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,188
Well, I guess we
was kind of at that.
And you're gonna tell me

860
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,732
I don't know about them
mountain fastnesses
of France.

861
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,150
Katie Nolan,
I'm ashamed of you!

862
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,152
Wasn't there nobody
in school
but you, Papa?

863
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,570
No, sir.
We had the whole place

864
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,239
to ourselves.
Your papa better
quit talking,

865
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,283
or he'll have you believing
you was in France, too.

866
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,118
No, Papa.
Talk some more!

867
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,619
What's this
here stuff?

868
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,663
Caviar. That comes
all the way from Russia.

869
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,415
Them's fish eggs.
Fish eggs!

870
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,626
Yeah. I never could get it
why they like it, myself,

871
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:51,461
except that
it's hard to get
and costs a lot.

872
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,754
And that makes
it good, Papa?

873
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:53,964
What about the Russians?

874
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,216
It ain't hard
for them to get.
Do they like it?

875
00:43:57,093 --> 00:44:01,096
Well, can you tie that?
Now, ain't we got
the smartest kids?

876
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,515
Papa, talk some more.
Tell us all about the party

877
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,976
and don't
leave out anything!

878
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,103
That can wait.

879
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,274
Here. How's that?

880
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,443
$3. Them's good wages.

881
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:15,944
And good tips, too.

882
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:19,156
Papa, start!
Was there music
and did they dance?

883
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,576
Your mother's got
no time for all that.

884
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:28,081
You could tell me.
You used to.

885
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,710
Well, it was
kind of nice.

886
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:36,131
Klommer's, their best room,
and all fixed up
with white flowers.

887
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,674
There was flowers
on the table,

888
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,177
flowers on the chandelier
and even on the floor.

889
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,054
Here was a great
big horseshoe table

890
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,847
with lots of
people all around.

891
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,266
And right in front,
a great big wedding cake!

892
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,018
It must've been
three feet tall.

893
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,603
Why didn't you
bring home some of that?

894
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,854
Was the bride pretty?

895
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,148
Well, she was maybe
not so young, but...

896
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:58,528
Sure! She was beautiful
in a blue dress and all.

897
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,990
And she had
diamonds on her fingers
and in her ears!

898
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,367
And she glittered sort of.

899
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,620
And when she walked,
her dress swished kinda.

900
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,539
And the champagne
just flowed like water.

901
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,501
The smell of it
got all mixed up
with the flowers

902
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,294
and the powder
the ladies wore,

903
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,380
and it made a wonderful,
new perfume

904
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,423
that made you feel good
just to smell it.

905
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:19,716
Did you sing
for them, Papa?

906
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,218
I was coming to that.

907
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,845
I got three encores
for My Wild Irish Rose,

908
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,722
and everybody
clapped and clapped.

909
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,683
Then I sang
Irish Eyes are Smiling
four times!

910
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,602
It must have been
awful nice!

911
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,895
It was all right.

912
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,480
And when it come time
for them to cut the cake,

913
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,065
the band played
Kiss Me Again,

914
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,402
she put her arms around him,
and, boy, did he look scared!

915
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,278
What was he scared of, Papa?

916
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,488
Huh?

917
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,242
You kids ask
too many questions.
You heard the story.

918
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:48,078
Now go on and go to bed.
It must be 3:00.

919
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,287
I got a bellyache.

920
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,248
Well, lay on
your right side.

921
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,291
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Neeley.

922
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,168
Good night, Francie.

923
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,630
Francie's kinda
mad at me because...

924
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,924
Well, Sissy made a scene
on the street today

925
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,301
and I asked her
to stay away.

926
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,764
Papa, was there
an impresario there?

927
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,308
No, not tonight,
prima donna.

928
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:13,228
But you got no call
to be mad at your mama.

929
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,481
She's always
got a good reason
for what she does.

930
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,534
Good night, Mama.

931
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,287
Good night, Francie.

932
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,893
Johnny, tell me
what else happened
at the party.

933
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:58,064
Well, it was nice,
just like I told you.

934
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,275
Awful nice.

935
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,445
Johnny, do you think...

936
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:07,824
I mean,
have I changed a lot?

937
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,952
Changed?

938
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,788
Why, she couldn't
hold a candle to you.
She ain't so hot.

939
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,457
I just said that
for the kids.
No, sir.

940
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,833
No. That's not
what I mean.

941
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:21,338
What I mean is
am I getting hard,
you know?

942
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:25,425
Now, where did you
grab onto an idea
like that? Hard?

943
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,136
I don't know.
I don't want to be,

944
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:29,471
but, well,
there's the kids
and all,

945
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,223
and I wanna do
what's right for them,

946
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:32,557
and maybe sometimes I...

947
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:33,850
Will you stop
talking like that?

948
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,727
Why, you're prettier
than you ever was!

949
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,396
I almost told that
to the whole bunch
down at the party tonight.

950
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,190
I almost said,
"You oughta see my bride

951
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,192
"that's waiting home
for me tonight."

952
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:46,738
And you was waiting, Katie.
That was nice, awful nice.

953
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,158
It was just
like it used to be.

954
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,872
You told about the party
awful nice tonight, Johnny.

955
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,168
I should have waited up
more often, I guess.

956
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:05,215
It ain't your fault,
working hard like you do.

957
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,468
You know something?

958
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:13,306
I wish I could have got you
the rest of that set
when we was married.

959
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,058
The guy said
it came all
the way from Spain.

960
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,060
What else was in
that set, Johnny?

961
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,062
You ain't told me
for a long time.

962
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,398
Two little side combs
and a locket on a chain.

963
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,358
And a bracelet,
you said?

964
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:24,651
There's no use talking.

965
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,902
Someday I'm gonna
look that guy up

966
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,195
and get you
the rest of that set.

967
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,572
That's nice,
Johnny, but I...

968
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,490
There's no "buts"
about it. I mean it.

969
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:34,077
Things are gonna be
different around here.

970
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,454
You ain't gonna
be workin' hard
like you are now.

971
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:37,747
I don't mind the work,
Johnny.

972
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,457
No, sir.
I ain't gonna
stand for it!

973
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,792
Look at them
pretty hands.

974
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,670
They ain't got no business
being in the water
all the time.

975
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,922
I'm gonna change
a lot of things
around here.

976
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,799
I'm gonna cut out
the drinking, too.

977
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,884
And just to prove it to ya,
here's my tip money.

978
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,929
No, keep your tips, Johnny.
Take all a man's money,
it ain't right!

979
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,764
And I'm gonna keep at 'em
down at the union headquarters

980
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,224
to make 'em
get me some jobs.

981
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:59,519
Yes, sir.
Tonight's the beginning
of something new!

982
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:01,521
You believe me,
don't you, Katie?

983
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,565
Yeah, Johnny.
Yeah, sure, I do!

984
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,776
I'll be singing
all over Brooklyn
and maybe Manhattan, too!

985
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,029
"Have you heard
Johnny Nolan sing?"
They'll say.

986
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,405
And then
maybe someday...

987
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,032
Johnny, stop it!

988
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,451
Stop it! Stop talking!

989
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,213
We ain't got a chance.

990
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,216
Who are we
trying to kid?

991
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,178
Yeah.

992
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:40,435
Sure, you're right.
Who am I trying to kid?

993
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,812
I didn't go to
hurt you, Johnny,

994
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,397
but it's the truth,
and I can't change it.

995
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,566
Yeah.

996
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,570
And I can tell you
something else.

997
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:55,033
All that baloney
about them
encores tonight,

998
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,370
that was just because
they was a little drunk
and feeling good.

999
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,455
I wasn't so much.

1000
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,626
That's right.
I'll never be able
to change it.

1001
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,128
Sure, you're right.

1002
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,715
Who am I trying to kid?

1003
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,904
Neeley Nolan,
you stop that!

1004
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,781
I don't wanna wear
no old tie. It's...

1005
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,324
Mama said!

1006
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,870
Hey, fellas,
look at me!
I'm Johnny Nolan!

1007
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,622
Hey! Look at me!

1008
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,794
All right!
Now break it up!
Break it up!

1009
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,213
Run along! Run along!
All of you! Go on.

1010
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,382
He's my pop.

1011
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,259
All right now, lad.
Where do you live, huh?

1012
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,344
I'll take him home!
He's my father!

1013
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,221
Wait a minute, honey.

1014
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:01,683
I expect you'd better be
running along to school,
hadn't you?

1015
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,893
I'll look
after him for you.

1016
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,563
Now, don't you worry.
He ain't in any trouble.

1017
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:10,358
I'll take good care of him.
Here, is this the house?

1018
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:18,450
No, the next one,
second floor, back.

1019
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,246
And if you talk to him,
he's always all right.

1020
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,958
Sure, sure. I know.
Now, don't you fret.
You just run along, huh?

1021
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,836
All right, lad.
Come on. We'll make it.

1022
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,598
Alive, alive-O

1023
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,141
Alive, alive-O

1024
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,686
Johnny.

1025
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,743
I didn't expect
to find you here, ma'am.
Is there anything I can do?

1026
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,370
He's my husband.
I can take care of him.

1027
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,123
It's all right, Johnny.
I'll get you
a nice cup of coffee.

1028
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:11,795
A nice cup of coffee.

1029
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,048
Well, I just wanted
to say, ma'am,

1030
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,133
that the gentleman
wasn't making
no trouble.

1031
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,802
He just needed
a little help.

1032
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,553
Here.
Drink it, Johnny.

1033
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,223
Isn't there anything
that I can do?

1034
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,850
If you wasn't
new on the beat,
Mr. McShane,

1035
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:28,061
you'd know that Johnny
never makes any trouble

1036
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:32,273
and you'd know that
the whole Nolan family
don't need anybody's help.

1037
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:36,027
I'd thank you, Mr. McShane,
if you'd mind
your own business.

1038
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,904
Sure, Mrs. Nolan.

1039
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:44,285
"Beauty is truth,
truth beauty,
that is all

1040
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:49,415
"Ye know on earth,
and all ye need to know"

1041
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,209
Now, class.

1042
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:56,673
"Beauty is truth,
truth beauty, that is all

1043
00:52:56,757 --> 00:53:02,178
"Ye know on earth,
and all ye need to know"

1044
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,180
Now who knows
the name of the meter?

1045
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:05,682
Frances Nolan?

1046
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,225
Yes, but...

1047
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,185
You can't know "but."

1048
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,187
I only meant to say,

1049
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,273
I was thinking
about the words,

1050
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,358
what they mean,
and I wondered...

1051
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,528
You don't have to know
the words, Frances,
just the meter.

1052
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,991
But if beauty is truth
and that's all ye need...
I mean, all you need to know,

1053
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,869
then that means
it's the most
important thing.

1054
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:29,747
And if a man,
I mean, if somebody

1055
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:33,293
spent all his time
trying to be like that,

1056
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:39,048
well, it's hard to put,
but no matter
what else he did, then...

1057
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,509
Then what, Frances?

1058
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:44,137
Then it would be all right,
wouldn't it?

1059
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:48,808
I'm afraid I don't understand
a thing you're saying,
Frances,

1060
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,685
and we're late now
with our arithmetic.

1061
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,645
Class will get
their arithmetic books.

1062
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,443
Pop, why don't
the Katzenjammer Kids
talk plain English?

1063
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:02,071
Supposed to make
it funny, I guess.

1064
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,741
Francie, you been
staring out that window
over a half an hour.

1065
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,868
Can't you
make up your mind
to do something?

1066
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,494
What shall I do?

1067
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,539
You used to like to do
your homework Sundays.

1068
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:14,417
I don't know.
I don't like school
as much as I used to.

1069
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,502
Now you're
getting some sense.

1070
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,380
School's the same
this year as it was last.

1071
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:20,924
Mama.

1072
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,760
Do you know that big market
on Clancy Street
down the hill?

1073
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,595
We can't trade there,
if that's what you mean.

1074
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,096
That neighborhood's
expensive.

1075
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,599
Well, I meant...
I mean,

1076
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,852
well, the other day,
I passed that way
on my way home

1077
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,062
and, well, Mom,

1078
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,147
you know what's just
a couple of blocks away
from that market?

1079
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,398
Another market, I guess.

1080
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,984
And am I supposed to guess
what's two blocks away
from there?

1081
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:42,737
Francie,
why don't you say
what you mean?

1082
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,989
I didn't mean anything,
I guess.

1083
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,577
Neeley, sometimes I think
you make these holes
on purpose.

1084
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,038
Papa.

1085
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,539
Yes, baby?

1086
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,292
You know what I read
in a magazine once?

1087
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:57,835
What was it, Francie?

1088
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,713
Well, it said that
walking was a good thing.

1089
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,715
It said people
would look and feel
a lot better

1090
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,300
if they did more of it.

1091
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,678
Walking puts rose petals
in your cheeks, it said.

1092
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,389
Then I oughta be
a raving beauty
with all them stairs.

1093
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:14,018
That isn't what it meant.
It meant, well,
like on a Sunday,

1094
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:17,730
people would feel
a lot better if they got out
and took a walk or something,

1095
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,107
instead of just
sitting around.

1096
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,943
Francie, I want you
to stop talking around
about things like that.

1097
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:26,531
It ain't right.
If you got something to say,
just say it right out, plain.

1098
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,994
I wasn't going
to say anything.

1099
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,997
I was just talking
about walking.

1100
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:39,877
Well, there's been
so much talking about walking,
I think I'll take one.

1101
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:43,840
You wanna go along,
prima donna?

1102
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:47,301
Yes, Papa. Sure, Papa.

1103
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,974
Must be pretty special,
this place you walk to

1104
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,268
that's two blocks away
from the market.

1105
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,478
This way, Papa.

1106
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,526
Is this it?

1107
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,777
Yes, Papa.

1108
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,197
The school?

1109
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,534
I don't understand.

1110
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,996
It must be just
as nice inside,
don't you think?

1111
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,247
The teachers
and all and...

1112
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,957
What are you
driving at, baby?

1113
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,335
Bend down, Papa.

1114
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:26,007
I wish I could go
to that school, Papa.

1115
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,929
Well,
I don't know, baby.

1116
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:34,932
It would be awful nice,
but they got rules.

1117
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,977
You gotta go
to the school
where you live.

1118
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,689
I know.
I didn't really...

1119
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,694
Well, now.
Now, wait a minute.

1120
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:50,031
Maybe there's a way.
It's a free country,
ain't it?

1121
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,704
School days,
school days

1122
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,749
Hey! Maybe we could
move near here.
When?

1123
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,835
Well, now, whoa, whoa.
Sometime soon.

1124
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,380
As soon as our ship
comes in, prima donna.
You'll see.

1125
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,217
Only by that time,
I'll...

1126
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,262
You wanna
go there awful bad,
don't you, baby?

1127
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,181
Then we're gonna
find a way.

1128
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,516
Honest?

1129
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,812
Well, now,
I gotta turn
this over a little.

1130
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,816
Let's do some more walking.
Maybe it's good
for thinking, too.

1131
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,984
School days,
school days

1132
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,280
Hey, that ain't
a bad little house.

1133
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,032
How'd you like
to live there?

1134
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,909
It's got a nice
little porch.

1135
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,619
I don't like
yellow houses.

1136
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,454
With another
coat of paint?

1137
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,085
Papa. That's it.

1138
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,213
Yes, sir. That's it.

1139
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:48,798
If we only could.

1140
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,424
Well, why can't we?

1141
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:51,634
Our luck's
bound to change,

1142
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:55,304
and the first thing
we'll do is buy
this little house when...

1143
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,639
Someday.

1144
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,101
Look. Come here.

1145
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:04,981
As long as we're gonna
buy that house someday,

1146
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,483
why don't we maybe
borrow it for now,

1147
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:09,986
like we'll make
out it's ours.

1148
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:14,866
Then your address would be
98 Hibbard Avenue,
starting right now.

1149
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,535
Then you see,
they gotta transfer you
from your old school.

1150
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,744
How do you mean, Papa?

1151
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:19,871
Yes, sir, that's it.

1152
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,664
We could say you
come here to live
with your aunt,

1153
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,291
your rich, old aunt.

1154
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,502
She's lonesome
and she's gonna leave you
all her money.

1155
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:27,962
Papa, could we really?

1156
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,755
Sure, we could.
It's nobody's business.

1157
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,134
And sometimes I forget
to water the geraniums,

1158
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,969
and you oughta hear
Auntie scold me.

1159
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:38,764
But you gotta put up
with her crotchets.
After all, you're her heir.

1160
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:42,560
That little room up there.
That could be mine,
couldn't it?

1161
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:44,896
Uh...

1162
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,066
Look, prima donna.

1163
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,819
After all, you know,

1164
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:55,406
this ain't exactly
according to the rules.

1165
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,657
You mean it's wrong?

1166
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,659
No, sir.
Not by a jugful
it ain't wrong.

1167
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:01,037
Look, the house is here,
we're here
and the school's here.

1168
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:04,207
Now, we wasn't
all thrown together
for no reason.

1169
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,710
But we gotta keep
it kind of a secret.

1170
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,879
You know,
you can't tell nobody

1171
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,089
and you gotta be
extra good
to make up for it.

1172
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:13,674
I will.

1173
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:17,511
Look. There goes
Auntie now, I think.

1174
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:22,225
It looks like
you got an uncle, too.

1175
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,313
Now, I'm gonna show you a way
to your new school through
a beautiful, little park

1176
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,023
and I know
right where it is.

1177
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,151
And you can see
the seasons change
when you go.

1178
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,946
Bend down, Papa.

1179
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,367
"My cup runneth over."

1180
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,917
It's dishonest,
that's what it is.

1181
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,919
You're setting the child
an awful bad example.

1182
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,587
Papa says if it
doesn't hurt anybody,

1183
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:53,005
it's not dishonest
in your heart.

1184
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,924
You two
and your fancy words.

1185
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,801
How do you spell
"transfer," Francie?

1186
00:59:56,885 --> 01:00:02,848
T-R-A-N-S-F-E-R.

1187
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:06,018
I'd rather be shot
than do this arithmetic.

1188
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,229
It'll come to you, Sonny.
And another thing,

1189
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,107
we kept Francie out a year
so she and Neeley
could be in the same class,

1190
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,275
and she could
look after him.

1191
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:15,444
And here, just the year
when they're getting ready
to graduate, you go and...

1192
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:16,612
I tell you,
it's against the law,

1193
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:17,655
and you're making
her live a lie

1194
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,115
and I won't
have you doin' it!

1195
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,661
I'm gonna do this
for her, Katie.

1196
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,372
Maybe it's my fault or not
that there ain't much
I can give her.

1197
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,917
But this is one thing
she's gonna have.

1198
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,425
It'll make
an awful long walk
for your mornings.

1199
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,093
I don't mind
getting up early.

1200
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,636
And it'll be
much harder
on your shoes

1201
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,596
and you won't have dresses
like the other children.

1202
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,141
I promise to
wash down my dress
every single night.

1203
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,476
How do you spell
"appreciate," Francie?

1204
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,437
A-P-P...
Wait a minute.

1205
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:55,735
R-E-C-I-A-T-E.

1206
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,989
If the principal
swallows that story,
and I don't think he will,

1207
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:04,702
I'll see what I can do
about making over that
checked dress of mine for you.

1208
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,757
Why not?
My school's overcrowded
as it is.

1209
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:22,595
This is Frances Nolan, class.

1210
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,348
I'm sure you'll all make
her welcome to our school.

1211
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:28,017
Now, that will be
your desk, Frances.

1212
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:51,624
Run along, Sonny.
I ain't gonna
spill a penny.

1213
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,475
Well, I guess
you got everything.

1214
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:15,689
Neeley, our new fire escape
leads clear up onto the roof!

1215
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:18,776
Whoever lives on the top floor
has got dibs on the roof!

1216
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,070
Johnny ain't doing so well,
eh, Mrs. Nolan?

1217
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,197
Just moving
near the sun.

1218
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:27,159
Soon as we heard
Mrs. Waters was vacating,
we made up our minds.

1219
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,370
I've been waiting to
see you, Mrs. Nolan.

1220
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:32,623
There's something
I got to ask you,
a favor.

1221
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,375
I better show you.

1222
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,460
Hey.
Look at this thing!

1223
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:39,630
Oh, boy! Just think,
we can have a lot of fun
running up and down that!

1224
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,757
We ain't gonna let
anybody but us up there.

1225
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,050
It's in here.

1226
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:44,343
Look how high it is!

1227
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,935
The late Mr. Waters
gave it to me
for a wedding present.

1228
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,728
It won't go
down the stairs

1229
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:58,190
and they want $15 to move it,
lowering it out the window.

1230
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,943
Do you mind
my leaving it,
Mrs. Nolan?

1231
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,487
It don't take up
much room,

1232
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:06,615
and someday
when I get the $15,
I'll send back for it.

1233
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,034
Why, sure,
I don't mind,
Mrs. Waters.

1234
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,411
Can you play it?

1235
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,745
No.

1236
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,956
The neither
one of us could.

1237
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,835
If it ain't too much trouble,
you could dust it off
once in a while,

1238
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,796
and keep
the kitchen door open a little
so it won't get cold or damp.

1239
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:22,590
I sure will.
Thank you.

1240
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:26,385
I hope it won't be long
before you can
send back for it.

1241
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:29,930
Have you got
the curtains?

1242
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,557
Yes. They're coming.

1243
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,771
Is it...

1244
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,733
Is that...

1245
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:45,112
Yeah, we kept a baby in it
about 40 years ago.

1246
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:49,492
Well,
I was just wondering,
if you don't need it,

1247
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,202
it would make a nice
handy little wash basket

1248
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,204
and I'd be glad
to give you
a quarter for it.

1249
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:56,999
Why, sure.
My Edgar's kids
is even too old.

1250
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,010
Excuse me for asking,
Mrs. Nolan,

1251
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,639
but it won't really make
a very handy wash basket.

1252
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,436
Please don't say nothing.
I ain't told nobody yet.

1253
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,439
It ain't always easy
when you're poor,

1254
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,942
but it'll be
a blessing to you.

1255
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,487
Yeah, sure.
Sure, it will.

1256
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,322
But there must be!

1257
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,823
I tell you, there ain't!

1258
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,078
Well, goodbye,
Mrs. Nolan. Goodbye.

1259
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:36,705
Goodbye,
and thank you
very much.

1260
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:40,834
Don't forget we're supposed
to give him a beer,
or the price of one.

1261
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:42,044
Well, I'm done.

1262
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,754
I can't thank you
enough, Charlie.

1263
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:47,341
Always glad to do
my customers a favor,
of course.

1264
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,510
Well, we are
real grateful.

1265
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:53,055
It ain't as though
I was in the regular
moving business.

1266
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:56,642
We'll be taking ice from you,
same as usual, once a week.

1267
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,727
Well, goodbye.

1268
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,813
Goodbye, Charlie,
and thanks.

1269
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,232
He worked
awful hard, Mama.

1270
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,067
We moved up
to this flat
to save money,

1271
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,528
and we're not gonna start
by throwing dimes away.

1272
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:11,365
No, sir, there ain't
a bathtub anywhere.
I looked all over.

1273
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,494
There's the tub,
young man.

1274
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:17,288
Every Wednesday
and Saturday,
same as always.

1275
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,291
It's Mr. Barker.

1276
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:27,798
Well, it seems like
the Nolans have
come up in the world.

1277
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,759
Yes, we're so
very, very fond
of the sunshine.

1278
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,094
In Dublin's fair city

1279
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,345
Where the girls
are so pretty...

1280
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:36,223
Run and catch him
before he goes
to the old place.

1281
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:37,516
Mr. Nolan happened
to be working

1282
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:40,311
when we found
we could make the move.

1283
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:43,564
Smaller than
your old flat,
ain't it?

1284
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,441
I'm sorry I can't ask
you to sit, Mr. Barker.

1285
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:47,067
I ain't even got
the coffee on yet.

1286
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,361
But I got my
insurance money handy.

1287
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:54,825
I suppose you're too busy
to listen to a bit of news
about your sister.

1288
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,620
She...

1289
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,706
She's gonna
have a baby.

1290
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:08,464
Please tell my sister
she shouldn't make herself
such a stranger here.

1291
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,424
I shall be very happy
to render your message.

1292
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:11,634
Your receipts,
Mrs. Nolan.

1293
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,594
Be sure to, now,
Mr. Barker.

1294
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,932
Good day to you,
Mr. Nolan.

1295
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:22,811
Well, I'm not one
to spoil a family party.
I'll be on my way.

1296
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,568
Surprise, Papa.
Welcome to your new home.

1297
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,864
Yeah. It is kind of
a surprise, all right.

1298
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,701
Did you move up here
because it was
cheaper or because I...

1299
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:41,163
We have to save
where we can.
Somebody's got to.

1300
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,624
I don't mind
the extra stairs.

1301
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,887
We can still
see the tree.

1302
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,515
Pop,
the top-floor tenants,
the roof is theirs,

1303
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,225
and I ain't gonna
let anybody up there

1304
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:03,686
except Henny Gaddis,
because...

1305
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,646
Hey. Does Pop know?

1306
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,272
Flossie Gaddis
died last night.

1307
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,693
The poor baby.

1308
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,946
It was nice that her mama
got her all them
pretty dresses.

1309
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,615
Only now the poor thing
will have to lie
in Potter's Field.

1310
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,411
But she did have
the dresses.

1311
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:25,124
You better show
your papa the piano.

1312
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:29,336
Yeah, you better
show me the piano,
prima donna.

1313
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,465
The lady
that was here left it.

1314
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,642
It's got a nice tone.

1315
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,354
It's all right.

1316
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:55,362
Hey! Now that we got it,
maybe you can
take some lessons!

1317
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:57,906
Nah.

1318
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:09,084
Maxwellton braes are bonnie

1319
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:13,464
Where early fa's the dew

1320
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:19,219
And 'twas there
that Annie Laurie

1321
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:30,856
Gave me her promise true

1322
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:38,322
Which ne'er forgot will be

1323
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,576
And for

1324
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:48,832
Bonnie Annie Laurie

1325
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:56,006
I would lay

1326
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,468
me doon

1327
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:05,557
and dee

1328
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:11,396
I ain't never heard
you sing that before.
It's pretty. It's...

1329
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:15,150
Maxwellton braes are bonnie

1330
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:17,986
Where early fa's the dew

1331
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:23,033
And 'twas there
that Annie Laurie

1332
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:34,336
Gave me her promise true

1333
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:41,927
Which ne'er forgot will be

1334
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:47,766
And for Bonnie Annie

1335
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:51,603
Laurie

1336
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,276
I would lay

1337
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:01,196
me doon

1338
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,493
and dee

1339
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:15,043
Well, this is
the beginning of a vacation
we've all looked forward to,

1340
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:17,504
and I'm sure
we'll all enjoy
our holidays more

1341
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:19,756
knowing we've helped
some unfortunate family

1342
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,759
who'd have had no
Christmas dinner
without this basket.

1343
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:25,762
And so a merry...
Oh, one last thing.

1344
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:28,599
This extra pie
Miss Shilling brought in,

1345
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:32,352
it's little
and a bit crushed,
but anybody want it?

1346
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,523
My! What well-fed
boys and girls.

1347
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,775
All right, class.

1348
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,902
Miss McDonough!

1349
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:40,944
Yes, Frances?

1350
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:44,823
I just remembered.
I know a very
unfortunate family.

1351
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:48,327
They live in a hovel.
They have two children,

1352
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,788
little golden-haired twins,
and they're all starving.

1353
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:54,082
The pie will probably
save their lives.

1354
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:57,210
Then you should
take the pie,
by all means.

1355
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:00,088
You can come and get it
when class is dismissed,

1356
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:03,133
which is now.
A merry Christmas
to you all!

1357
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,182
Here. Merry Christmas!

1358
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:16,438
That was a very fine
Christmas spirit,
Frances,

1359
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,650
but it seems
such a tiny pie to
save so many lives.

1360
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:22,152
It won't seem small
to them, Miss McDonough.

1361
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,695
Even a little pie
can look awful big

1362
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,155
if you hadn't had
very much to eat

1363
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:28,283
for days and days.
I'll have to tell them
to eat it slowly

1364
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:32,120
because if they
eat it too fast on an
empty stomach, they'll...

1365
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:33,747
They'll...

1366
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:39,378
It isn't true.
It's all a lie!
I wanted it for myself!

1367
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:44,466
I'll stay after school.
I'll do anything,
but don't send a note home!

1368
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,552
I'm not going to
punish you, child,
for being hungry,

1369
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,513
or having
an imagination.

1370
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,891
You know, that's something
very few people have.

1371
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:54,726
It's very precious.

1372
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:59,064
But it can also
be dangerous unless
we learn how to use it.

1373
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:03,986
Our everyday lives
are real and true,
aren't they?

1374
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:08,156
But all the stories
in the world,
all the music

1375
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,534
came out of
someone's imagination.

1376
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:14,830
So, if we tell the truth
and write the lies,

1377
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,164
then they aren't
lies anymore.

1378
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,166
They become stories,

1379
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:21,503
like some of
the very nice compositions
you've written, Frances.

1380
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,171
Like the one about
my father taking me

1381
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:25,465
to see the cotton fields
down south.

1382
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:26,967
We didn't really go.

1383
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,177
I rather imagined
you didn't.

1384
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:32,639
But don't you think
it would be still better

1385
01:12:32,724 --> 01:12:36,560
if you'd write
about the things
you really know about

1386
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,603
and then add to them
with your imagination?

1387
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:44,568
Even stories
shouldn't be just,
well, pipe dreams.

1388
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,696
Pipe-dreamers can be
very lovable people

1389
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,949
but they
don't help anybody,
not even themselves.

1390
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:55,704
Now, think about it a little,
and have a merry Christmas.

1391
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,459
And enjoy your pie.

1392
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:04,421
Yes, Miss McDonough.
Thank you, Miss McDonough.

1393
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,222
For God's sakes!
Where you been?

1394
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,974
You were supposed
to meet me...

1395
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:17,225
Where'd you swipe that?

1396
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,394
Neeley, I'm going
to be a writer.

1397
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:21,855
All right,
but let's eat the pie.

1398
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:25,108
Come on,
we gotta see about
our Christmas tree!

1399
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:27,819
Golly!
It's still there,
isn't it?

1400
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,202
Yeah,
it's still here.

1401
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:37,162
He ain't got much time
left to sell it.

1402
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,831
Go on. Beat it!
You know I ain't gonna
throw them till midnight.

1403
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,709
What are you trying to do,
block the sidewalk,
keep customers out?

1404
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:46,088
Hey! You don't own
the sidewalk!
Free country, ain't it?

1405
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,215
How about this one,
madam?

1406
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,969
No, that one's too big.
I want a small one.

1407
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,472
I got just what you want.
Come over here, lady.

1408
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:58,683
Well, now,
that's more like it!
That's the size.

1409
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,311
It's awful big to
get throwed at you.

1410
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,814
Why does he have to
throw them at us,
anyway?

1411
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:06,858
Why can't he
just give them to us
if he don't sell them?

1412
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,860
If he just gave them away,
everybody would wait.

1413
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,196
He'd never sell
any of 'em.

1414
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,450
Smells good.

1415
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:21,706
There she goes!

1416
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,084
Hey, I stumbled!

1417
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,460
Go on! Beat it!
Who's next?

1418
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:26,878
Come on,
give me a chance.
I'm next.

1419
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:29,131
All right,
here she goes.

1420
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:31,675
Got it, didn't I?

1421
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:33,260
All right, take it!
Go home!

1422
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:35,804
Now, who wants
to try this one?

1423
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:38,014
Who's man enough
for this big one
right here?

1424
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:39,975
I can take anything
you got, mister. Let her...

1425
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,726
I'm next!
That's my tree!

1426
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:43,478
You're too small.
Go home.

1427
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:46,106
Me and my brother,
we ain't too small
together.

1428
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,190
Spunky, huh?

1429
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:49,276
All right,
but if one of you drop,

1430
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,444
you're not gonna
get the tree.

1431
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,739
There she goes!

1432
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,493
That a girl!
You got it!

1433
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:01,955
Okay, you got it coming.
Go ahead! Who's next?

1434
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,502
Quit worrying
about them, Katie.
They'll be home pretty quick.

1435
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,796
They ain't old enough
to be out this late.

1436
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:12,632
Johnny should have made them
tell what they was up to.

1437
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,968
No telling
what's likely to happen
if Francie gets a notion...

1438
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,845
They'll be all right.

1439
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:32,110
Well, I guess
we better get on home.

1440
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:33,695
I'll see them tomorrow.

1441
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,030
No, don't go!

1442
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,036
Hey, Pa! Hey, Ma!

1443
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,537
Hey, Ma!

1444
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:46,249
Look!

1445
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:50,629
Holy smoke!
Will you look what
they've went and done?

1446
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,926
They're trying to
make a Christmas.
Help 'em, kid.

1447
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,724
We got it throwed at us!
Well, sure,

1448
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:05,894
I was only wondering
if you couldn't use
a little help.

1449
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,395
Come on, come on,
come on.

1450
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:08,897
How in Jerusalem
did you...

1451
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,191
Look, Papa!
Look at my face, Pop!
Look at my face!

1452
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,692
Nobody around here
ever saw a tree
like that!

1453
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,236
Look at my face
if you don't believe it.

1454
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,112
And I see you got the law
on your side, too.

1455
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,657
Merry Christmas, Mr. Nolan!
And it looks like
you're gonna have one.

1456
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:20,283
Same to you,
Mr. McShane,
and thanks.

1457
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:21,910
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Nolan.

1458
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,078
Merry Christmas,
Miss Maggie.

1459
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:24,537
Isn't this a wonderful
Christmas, Papa?

1460
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:25,914
It is now,
prima donna.

1461
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,624
Imagine us having
a tree like that,

1462
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,627
and the nicest kids
in the world, I guess.

1463
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,424
Merry Christmas,
everybody!
Merry Christmas!

1464
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:38,051
God bless you,
Mr. Nolan.

1465
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:40,220
Merry Christmas, Neeley!

1466
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:41,805
Merry Christmas!

1467
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,227
He ain't any older
than they are.

1468
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:52,607
Round yon
virgin mother and child

1469
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:57,946
Holy infant
so tender and mild

1470
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,030
Merry Christmas.

1471
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:07,205
Sleep in heavenly peace

1472
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,625
Silent night, holy...

1473
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:15,922
Here!

1474
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,178
Put it up
higher, Bill!

1475
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:23,346
Steve's the name.

1476
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:24,723
That's better, Bill.

1477
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:26,975
Old itchy underwear!

1478
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:31,062
But look at all the fun
you can have scratching!

1479
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:33,523
Thank you, Mama.

1480
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:35,317
You know
you hate them.

1481
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,110
They're fine, Mama.

1482
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,285
I got something
for you, too, Mama.

1483
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:49,331
Johnny. It was real nice
of your friend Mr. McGarrity

1484
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:52,167
to send over
those candy canes
to the kids.

1485
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,335
Yeah.

1486
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:56,379
Here. I made this
candle for today.

1487
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:59,007
You better light it now.
It's time.

1488
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:03,178
Merry Christmas, Mama,
from me and Neeley.

1489
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,016
Oh, it's pretty.

1490
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:09,809
What is it?

1491
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:11,102
Rose water
and glycerin.

1492
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,271
You rub it
on your hands.

1493
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:17,317
This is for you, Papa,
from me and Neeley.

1494
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,446
My!

1495
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,867
I'll be quite the thing,
won't I?

1496
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,203
I think it's silly,
but Francie said

1497
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:31,206
Papa was always talking about
what nice hands you got.

1498
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:35,043
It cost a dime,
but we had a seltzer bottle
top in the junk.

1499
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:42,217
It's a watch fob.
It's made out
of shoelaces.

1500
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,636
I wove it on a spool
with nails.

1501
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:50,058
Well, if that ain't
about the nicest thing
I ever did see.

1502
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,727
Maybe it's kinda silly,
you not having a watch.

1503
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:55,688
Well, now, madam,
we're all out of
mushrooms under glass,

1504
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:58,024
but I can
tell you the time.

1505
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:01,486
That's the nicest present
I ever did get, prima donna.

1506
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,571
And thank you, too, Son.

1507
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:06,866
You're welcome. I guess
the shoelaces was mine.

1508
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:09,077
It was silly.

1509
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,495
There ain't nothing
silly on Christmas.

1510
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,832
I got a little
present here.

1511
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,003
Like I was saying,
I got...

1512
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:20,255
Merry Christmas,
Miss Francie.

1513
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:23,174
Come on. They're in here.
It's Mr. McShane.

1514
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,342
I hope I'm not intruding.

1515
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:25,718
Merry Christmas,
Mr. McShane.

1516
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:26,928
Merry Christmas!

1517
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,471
Merry Christmas.
I was just...

1518
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:29,681
Hello, handsome.

1519
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,391
Mrs. Edwards.

1520
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:35,061
I was just passing,
and I happened to see
the light still burning

1521
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:36,354
and I got to thinking

1522
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:39,441
that I'd like to have
a hand in decorating
that fine Christmas tree.

1523
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:40,775
I see somebody's
already provided.

1524
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,111
We can always
use more of them,
Mr. McShane.

1525
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,029
Thank you kindly.

1526
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,949
Won't you come in
and have a cup
of coffee with us?

1527
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:51,828
Thanks, no.
This evening's
for families.

1528
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,455
And I got to be
getting home now,

1529
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,958
so I'll say goodbye
and merry Christmas
to everybody.

1530
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,544
Thank you, Mr. McShane.
Merry Christmas!

1531
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:01,421
That was mighty
nice of him.

1532
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,256
Mr. McShane's
a fine man.

1533
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,134
He's, I think,
sometimes a lonely man.

1534
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:09,637
Like I was saying,
I got something here.

1535
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:13,725
I mean,
I got a present for somebody
that ain't exactly here.

1536
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,312
Grandma helped me pick it out.
It's for you know who.

1537
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:22,108
Bill, it's beautiful.
Look, everybody!

1538
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:26,571
Bill, darling,
I've never been
so happy!

1539
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,032
I'm gonna get some coffee.

1540
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:43,588
Katie?

1541
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:49,552
Yeah.

1542
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:50,970
I'm glad for ya.

1543
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,309
I don't know.
I'm scared, I guess.

1544
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:59,521
You got no call to be.
Look how swell
them two are.

1545
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,105
Yeah, they are.

1546
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:04,442
You told Johnny yet?

1547
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:09,322
Well, maybe you ought to.
It might help him.

1548
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:11,074
Yeah.

1549
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,789
We better take
the coffee in.

1550
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:21,793
You're a fine girl, Katie.
I never said any different.

1551
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:46,568
That's for nothing, Johnny,
except maybe being a nice guy.

1552
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,405
Coffee, everybody!

1553
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,546
Well, I guess
that's about all.

1554
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:09,507
Johnny, I got to
tell ya something.

1555
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,969
Maybe it ain't
the right time,
and maybe it is.

1556
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,763
The reason
I moved us up here...

1557
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,182
We're gonna have
a baby, Johnny.

1558
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,602
That's why I've been
scrimpin' so much
and tryin' so hard to save.

1559
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:21,936
That's...

1560
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:27,483
Well, I'm awful glad,
Katie, if you are.

1561
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:29,027
There's a lot we got
to think about, Johnny.

1562
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,612
I know!
But we'll make out.

1563
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,572
Maybe things
will be different.

1564
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:34,657
And we'll have one
to grow up with
all over again.

1565
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:36,743
I got things
all figured out.

1566
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:40,330
I ought to be able
to work until,
well, anyway, April,

1567
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:43,041
and then Francie
will have to leave school
and take out a working paper.

1568
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,876
She's young,
but with what
she can make,

1569
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,127
we ought to be
able to make out.

1570
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,503
But we can't
do that, Katie!

1571
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:49,339
I don't like it any better
than you do, Johnny.

1572
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:51,924
But I thought and I thought,
and there ain't no other way.

1573
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:54,969
And, Johnny, you got to
help with something.
She listens to you.

1574
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:58,431
You got to quit
gettin' her so all excited
about her schoolin'.

1575
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,058
But why can't it
be Neeley?

1576
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,060
He's the boy,
and he don't care
like she does!

1577
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:03,519
Well, maybe that's why.

1578
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,813
Maybe it'll do her good
to get out in the world,

1579
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:08,149
and learn how to
take care of herself,

1580
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,525
learn somethin' practical
while she's young.

1581
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,527
She's got to
learn someday.

1582
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:13,571
Well, there must be
another way!

1583
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:18,326
I don't know. I'll try
and swing anything.
I'll do anything.

1584
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,078
We can't count
on that, Johnny.

1585
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:27,543
Don't look at me
like that, Johnny.
It ain't my fault.

1586
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:33,925
It ain't your fault either,
I guess. I don't know.

1587
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:37,929
Anyway, one member of
the Nolan family'll

1588
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,764
get to graduate,
and she come close.

1589
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,474
That's somethin'.

1590
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:48,981
You better put out the light,
and let's get some rest.

1591
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,049
Oh!

1592
01:24:15,426 --> 01:24:17,927
I thought you'd be asleep,
prima donna.

1593
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,930
Uh-uh.
I've been thinking.

1594
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:26,728
I might be going
to be a writer.
I've just about decided.

1595
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:31,023
I knew you
when you was gonna
be a lady fireman.

1596
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:34,944
Don't joke, Papa.
I'm serious.

1597
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,321
All right, baby.

1598
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:42,243
All I meant
was maybe it's better
not to get your heart set

1599
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:46,330
on just one thing,
in case something happens.

1600
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:49,333
She said,
Miss McDonough,
I mean,

1601
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:56,007
she said maybe I could be.
She said I have imagination.

1602
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,718
Do you think
I have, Papa?

1603
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,678
Sure you have, baby.

1604
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:03,222
Them compositions of yours
are sure fine, but...

1605
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:05,600
She said I'd have
to work hard.

1606
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:08,686
She said imagination
wasn't any good

1607
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:11,606
if you were just
a pipe-dreamer
about it.

1608
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:16,110
You didn't help
anybody that way,
not even yourself, she said.

1609
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:20,823
Yeah, I see.
A pipe-dreamer.

1610
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,952
I'm not putting it
good like she did.

1611
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:28,748
I wish you
could've heard her.
She was wonderful.

1612
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:33,628
Forever and ever,
I'll be glad you helped me
go to that school, Papa.

1613
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:35,588
You kind of
like that school,
don't you, baby?

1614
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:39,217
Yes. Oh, yes.

1615
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:44,222
And she said lots more.
I've been trying to remember.

1616
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:49,268
She said even if
you have imagination,

1617
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,479
it's better to write about
the things you know about

1618
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:53,731
so they'll be true.

1619
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:56,984
And the way things are.

1620
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:58,653
Only...

1621
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:00,071
Only what, baby?

1622
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:03,825
Papa, the people in the hall
when we brought up the tree,

1623
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:06,536
the look on their faces,
all friendly and nice.

1624
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:10,414
Why can't people
be like that all the time,
not just on Christmas?

1625
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:15,419
Well, I guess
it's because...

1626
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:19,924
Well, I don't know.

1627
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:23,845
Maybe it's because
Christmas is like
people really are

1628
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,847
and the other
part ain't true.

1629
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:27,557
And with that
imagination of yours,

1630
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:29,559
if you think
about it hard enough,

1631
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:31,519
you know,
like it ought to be...

1632
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,729
But when you
get to thinking,

1633
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,356
Papa, the people
in the stories,

1634
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,984
they don't just live
happily ever after,
do they?

1635
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:39,193
No, baby, but...

1636
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:41,070
But the trouble is,

1637
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:44,740
it doesn't feel good
when you think about
things like that,

1638
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:49,287
I mean,
like they really are.

1639
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,875
You better stick
out your tongue,
prima donna.

1640
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:58,880
It's just like I thought.

1641
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:02,592
You got a bad case,
a very bad case.

1642
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,427
Case of what, Papa?

1643
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,013
A very bad case
of growing up.

1644
01:27:08,599 --> 01:27:10,224
That's all it is.

1645
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:17,315
It ain't fun sometimes,
but don't you be afraid.

1646
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,985
I don't want you
should ever be afraid.

1647
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:25,823
You're so nice, Papa.

1648
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:29,785
I guess it's better
if you don't just
stay young all your life.

1649
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:32,705
It'll be much nicer
growing up.

1650
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,542
Yeah.

1651
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:43,049
Then you get to see things
like they really are.

1652
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:14,747
Good night, baby.

1653
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:16,624
Good night, Papa.

1654
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:20,169
I'm sleepy now.

1655
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:24,966
That's fine, baby,
just fine.

1656
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,245
Ain't ya comin'
to bed, Johnny?

1657
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,664
No. I'm gonna take
a little walk.

1658
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:59,083
Don't start drinking,
not tonight, Johnny.

1659
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,794
I won't, Katie.
I won't.

1660
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,531
Well, did he
go out on a job,
do you know?

1661
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,325
If he did,
he didn't get it
through us.

1662
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,579
Thank you.

1663
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:48,507
How are you, Mrs. Nolan?
And happy new year to you.

1664
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,676
Same to you,
Mr. McGarrity.

1665
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,930
I just came to...

1666
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,559
Well, I happened
to be passing by,
and I thought I'd run in

1667
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,895
and thank you for
the candy canes
you sent us.

1668
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:02,271
It was nice of ya.

1669
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:03,773
That's all right.
It wasn't much.

1670
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:06,358
Well, it was
nice of you.

1671
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,572
Good night, Mr. McGarrity.
Good night, Mrs. Nolan.

1672
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,032
Mrs. Nolan.

1673
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:18,662
Johnny ain't here.
He ain't been here
since before Christmas.

1674
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:41,894
I'm afraid it's bad news
I'm bringing you, Mrs. Nolan.

1675
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,979
Our station
just got a report
that Mr. Nolan

1676
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:46,107
was found over in
Manhattan very sick.

1677
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,442
He's been taken
to a hospital.

1678
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:51,445
See that Neeley
gets to school on time
in the morning.

1679
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:52,947
There's an apple
for your lunches.

1680
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:55,950
The report said
that he just collapsed

1681
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:57,952
right in the doorway
of an employment agency.

1682
01:30:58,036 --> 01:30:59,912
And he'd just been
going out on a job.

1683
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,331
A sandhog
in a tunnel,
they said.

1684
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:04,041
And he hadn't been
drinking, ma'am.

1685
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:07,211
He'd been waiting there
a long time for the job.

1686
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:09,797
He was just sick.

1687
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,638
We did everything
we could.

1688
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,265
Yeah, sure. I know.

1689
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:22,768
What are you writing down
that he died from, Doctor?

1690
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:26,438
Acute alcoholism
and pneumonia.
One led to the other.

1691
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:30,943
I don't want you
to write down that
he died like that.

1692
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:33,696
Put just the pneumonia.
I can't do that.

1693
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,323
Pneumonia was
the direct cause of death,
but the alcoholism was...

1694
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:37,700
Look, he's dead.

1695
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:40,494
I got two nice kids
that are gonna grow up
to amount to somethin'.

1696
01:31:40,579 --> 01:31:44,790
Why do you have to make it
hard by sayin' their father
died from the drink

1697
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,793
when that's only
a little piece
of the truth?

1698
01:31:47,878 --> 01:31:51,714
He wasn't drinkin'.
They said so.
He was out lookin' for work.

1699
01:31:53,884 --> 01:31:55,426
Why don't you
put that down?

1700
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:02,099
Cause of death,
pneumonia.

1701
01:32:06,897 --> 01:32:08,856
"Everlasting rest
and happiness

1702
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,067
"through the infinite merits
of Jesus Christ.

1703
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:16,739
"Oh, God,
great and omnipotent judge
of the living and the dead,

1704
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:19,533
"before whom
we are all to appear
after this short life

1705
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:22,077
"to render an account
of our work.

1706
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:24,038
"Let our hearts,
we pray Thee,

1707
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:26,624
"be deeply moved at
the sight of this death.

1708
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:30,169
"And while we consign the body
of the deceased to the earth,

1709
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:33,839
"let us be mindful
of our own frailties
and mortality,

1710
01:32:33,924 --> 01:32:35,925
"that walking
always in Thy fear

1711
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:38,219
"and in the ways
of Thy Commandments

1712
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:40,304
"we may,
after our departure
from this world,

1713
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:43,557
"experience
a merciful judgment

1714
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:46,352
"and rejoice in
everlasting happiness

1715
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:48,395
"through Christ, our Lord."

1716
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,690
All them people
and the flowers,

1717
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:56,195
some of them from people
I never heard of even.

1718
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:00,574
Who would've thought
that many folks...

1719
01:33:01,952 --> 01:33:05,162
I mean,
they was carrying on

1720
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:08,290
like they was
his family or, or...

1721
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:11,418
I don't know.

1722
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:17,174
Yeah. He took the time
to make a lot of people
love him, all right.

1723
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:20,386
It's hard to figure out
so many of them showing up.

1724
01:33:22,681 --> 01:33:25,432
And they was
feeling something.

1725
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:29,937
I mean,
there was no reason
for 'em to put on.

1726
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,606
He was nobody big.
He was just a...

1727
01:33:32,691 --> 01:33:33,941
Katie.

1728
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:35,901
Don't talk about
it no more, kid.

1729
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,664
Francie.
Just leave her be, Katie.

1730
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:49,957
She maybe wants
to be by herself.

1731
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:51,125
She's taking on
kind of funny.

1732
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:52,710
She ain't even cried.

1733
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,343
Goodbye.

1734
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:11,937
I'd like my
father's shaving cup.

1735
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:13,814
That one. "Nolan."

1736
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,404
Oh, you're the little girl.

1737
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,865
Yes. I'll clean it
up for you.

1738
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:28,912
He was a fine man.

1739
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:32,458
Tell your mama
that I, his barber,
said this.

1740
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,125
Francie.

1741
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:16,877
What?

1742
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:20,798
Francie, dear,
where are you going?

1743
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:23,634
No place.

1744
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,137
Francie.

1745
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:30,182
Yes, Mama?

1746
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:33,560
It was nice of the neighbors
to send over all that food.

1747
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:34,978
Don't you want something?

1748
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:37,731
No, Mama.

1749
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,152
I wanted to talk
to you, Francie.

1750
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:48,075
I want things to go on,
the reading and all.

1751
01:35:49,828 --> 01:35:50,828
I want to do...

1752
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:55,791
Well, I got to be
mama and papa both
to you now, Francie.

1753
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:08,220
Yes, Mama.
Is that all, Mama?

1754
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:12,099
Well...

1755
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:17,438
You gotta go right now,
Francie, I...

1756
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:20,190
I'll be back.
Honest, I will.

1757
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:31,827
Mom.

1758
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:35,539
I guess
I'm a little hungry.

1759
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:42,880
Look.
He can't be dead.
Can't!

1760
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:45,883
They don't understand.

1761
01:36:49,888 --> 01:36:52,806
Maybe you could let me
have a baby someday,

1762
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:55,434
and it could be a boy.

1763
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:58,061
So it could be
just like him.

1764
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:02,316
It would have to be me.

1765
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:05,777
Nobody else
loved him like I do.

1766
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,449
Maybe you could
do that for me.

1767
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:13,702
And if you could,

1768
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:18,665
he wouldn't even die.

1769
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:31,428
I hope you don't think
I'm forward coming in
like this, Mrs. Nolan.

1770
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:33,680
How are you, Francie?

1771
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:34,932
I'm well, thank you.

1772
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:38,519
Have a chair.
Francie, see if Mr. McGarrity
won't have some coffee.

1773
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:40,062
Not for me,
thank you.

1774
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:41,855
I figured
I ought to come.

1775
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:44,441
I suppose you know
how Johnny and me
done business.

1776
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:49,696
He'd give me some money
to keep sometimes
and draw against it.

1777
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:51,532
And when he...

1778
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:55,953
Well, I got
to looking around
and what do you think?

1779
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:59,456
I had, I had nearly
five bucks in his box.

1780
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:03,460
And so I,
I figured it
belonged to you.

1781
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:08,590
If you told the truth,

1782
01:38:08,675 --> 01:38:10,676
it would be
more than likely
that he owed you.

1783
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:14,680
But thanks very much.

1784
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:17,975
Well, I just thought...

1785
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:19,226
We'll make out.

1786
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:22,104
Well, there's
something else then.

1787
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:25,107
I thought maybe
you wouldn't mind

1788
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:29,194
if maybe Francie
and Neeley came down
to work for me afternoons,

1789
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:31,363
like, after school
and Saturdays.

1790
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:34,283
And, of course,
maybe it ain't
the kind of a place

1791
01:38:34,367 --> 01:38:37,995
you'd favor them working in,
but I'd keep an eye on them.

1792
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:41,373
And I'd pay them
$2 a week apiece.

1793
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:45,460
And I'd take it as
a great favor, ma'am.

1794
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:50,173
You're a very bad liar,
Mr. McGarrity,

1795
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:55,053
but you're a good man,
and I'm ashamed
I didn't know it before.

1796
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:57,264
No, it ain't
like that, ma'am.

1797
01:38:57,348 --> 01:39:00,350
Johnny was...
Well, I don't know.

1798
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:03,895
Johnny...
Johnny always talked
about his family

1799
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:07,274
like, well, like
folks ought to
and don't.

1800
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:13,030
And, whenever
he talked about anything,
he always made you...

1801
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:16,241
You felt better
or you wanted to laugh.

1802
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:19,077
Like that seashell
I had there.

1803
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:22,122
He was always,
he was always
listening to it

1804
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:24,374
and telling you
what it was singing.

1805
01:39:26,169 --> 01:39:28,003
He was always
giving things
like that to people.

1806
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:30,088
He...

1807
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:33,342
He was a fine man,
Mrs. Nolan.

1808
01:39:39,057 --> 01:39:42,017
I'd be glad to let
the children work
for you, Mr. McGarrity.

1809
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:46,688
And the $4 a week
will keep us
until the baby comes,

1810
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:48,398
and Francie won't
have to quit school

1811
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:50,150
and she can keep on,
and they can both...

1812
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:58,700
Well, it's a deal then.
And you tell 'em

1813
01:39:58,785 --> 01:40:01,495
to come through
the family entrance
tomorrow after school.

1814
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:05,749
Is that all right
with you, Francie?

1815
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,085
Yes.

1816
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,506
Well, well,
it's settled then

1817
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:15,008
and, good day to you,
Mrs. Nolan.

1818
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:17,177
And thank you again,
Mr. McGarrity.

1819
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:21,598
Francie.
Yes, Mama.

1820
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:26,311
I'm glad
you can keep on
with your school.

1821
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:29,064
I was hoping
something like this
would happen,

1822
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:32,275
but I didn't want
to say anything
until the time come.

1823
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:36,571
But your papa and I
talked it all over

1824
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:38,615
and there were reasons.

1825
01:40:39,826 --> 01:40:42,619
And there just
wasn't any other way.

1826
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:47,874
It doesn't matter.
Papa saved me from it.

1827
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:05,642
Hiya, kid.

1828
01:41:05,727 --> 01:41:06,977
Well, they're sure
taking chances.

1829
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:08,770
I wouldn't,
leaving you handle
them eats.

1830
01:41:08,855 --> 01:41:10,689
- Where's Francie?
-  Kitchen.

1831
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:12,858
Thanks. Hiya, Mac.

1832
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:14,693
Hello, kid.
How are you, lamb?
Hello, Aunt Sissy.

1833
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:16,445
Look. You got to
do something for me.

1834
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:18,238
This was in the paper,
and I cut it out.

1835
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:21,783
You got to
read it to me, and...
What's the matter, hon?

1836
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:24,453
Nothing. I'm all right,
Aunt Sissy.
No, you ain't.

1837
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:25,829
You ain't been since...

1838
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:28,749
Look. Don't you think
you better spill it
to your Aunt Sissy?

1839
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:30,959
What is it
you want me to read
to you, Aunt Sissy?

1840
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:33,003
Well, we'll get that
out of the way first.

1841
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:34,963
Look. Here it is.
Likely you don't
remember him.

1842
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,548
But it's my
last husband, Bill.

1843
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:38,258
The one
I thought was dead,
but he ain't.

1844
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:39,426
He's got his picture
in there,

1845
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:40,594
and I wanna know
what it says.

1846
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:42,304
Maybe it says where he lives
so as I can write to him

1847
01:41:42,388 --> 01:41:44,055
about getting a divorce
or something.

1848
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,932
I got the best husband
in all the world now

1849
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:48,185
and I don't want this
here one bobbing up
and making no trouble.

1850
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:50,812
He's a fireman someplace.
I can tell that
from his clothes.

1851
01:41:50,897 --> 01:41:52,272
He was just starting out
in the fireman business...

1852
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:54,775
This says he's a hero.
He saved some people
in a fire.

1853
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:56,401
Does it say where?

1854
01:41:56,486 --> 01:41:58,236
The 9th Precinct,
Manhattan.

1855
01:41:58,321 --> 01:41:59,571
Manhattan, huh?

1856
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:01,782
Couldn't make the grade
in Brooklyn, I guess.

1857
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:04,117
I want you to
write to him, Francie.
Write this,

1858
01:42:04,202 --> 01:42:05,452
"Dear Bill..."

1859
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,621
This says his name
is Roland Polaski.

1860
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:09,790
That's right,
I remember.

1861
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:12,125
Make it
"Dear Mr. Polaski.

1862
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:14,252
"Being's as now I'm married
to somebody else

1863
01:42:14,337 --> 01:42:17,088
"I want you
to see about getting
a real legal divorce

1864
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:19,549
"because I thought
you was dead,
but you ain't.

1865
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:22,010
"And because
you got the money now
on account of the reward.

1866
01:42:22,094 --> 01:42:23,970
"Yours very truly, Sissy."
Something like that.

1867
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:26,306
But, Aunt Sissy,
he must have
already done that.

1868
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:28,099
Because it says here
he's married again.

1869
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,143
It does?

1870
01:42:30,228 --> 01:42:31,812
"On the human interest
side of the story,

1871
01:42:31,896 --> 01:42:34,898
"Mrs. Polaski had returned
home only the day before
from the hospital

1872
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:37,734
"after presenting Mr. Polaski
with a brand-new son,

1873
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:39,528
"the fourth child
of the marriage."

1874
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:42,322
So, if he got a divorce
that long ago,
you don't have to.

1875
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:43,824
Then my being
married to Bill,

1876
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:45,242
this one, I mean,
is all legal?

1877
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:49,037
Well, now,
if that ain't a load
off my chest.

1878
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:52,541
You know something?
I think I'll give Bill Polaski
a wedding present.

1879
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:55,460
But Aunt Sissy, you can't.
He's been married for years.

1880
01:42:56,254 --> 01:43:00,382
Four kids, huh?
Must be a pretty sickly woman,
this Mrs. Polaski,

1881
01:43:00,466 --> 01:43:02,509
going to the hospital
just to have a baby.

1882
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,845
No. Lots of people
go there now
to have babies.

1883
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:06,012
It's better.

1884
01:43:06,097 --> 01:43:09,182
Sure enough?
You know something?

1885
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:11,393
I'm gonna cash in
my funeral policy

1886
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:12,936
and have my baby
at a hospital.

1887
01:43:13,563 --> 01:43:15,939
And when my baby
is born and lives,

1888
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:19,526
I want you to write
that R. Polaski
and announce it.

1889
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,319
Boy, do I feel better!

1890
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:23,280
And, now, chickabiddy,
we'll talk about you.

1891
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:25,490
Can't your Aunt Sissy
help you any?
I'm all right.

1892
01:43:25,575 --> 01:43:27,742
No, you aren't, honey,
not all shut up
like that.

1893
01:43:27,827 --> 01:43:29,911
I know how you feel,
but you can't keep
hanging on to it.

1894
01:43:29,996 --> 01:43:32,038
I'm all right.
I don't want to
talk about it.

1895
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:34,916
All right, baby.
All right.

1896
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:37,502
But I'll tell you what.
You can do
something for me.

1897
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:41,131
Look.
Your mama feels
awful bad, too.

1898
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:44,718
She needs you.
Why don't you talk
to her about it?

1899
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:46,094
She doesn't need me.
Yes, she does.

1900
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,512
No, she doesn't!
She's got Neeley!

1901
01:43:47,597 --> 01:43:49,222
Why wasn't it Neeley
she was going to
make quit school?

1902
01:43:49,307 --> 01:43:50,682
He never
cared about it.

1903
01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:52,434
She doesn't love me
like Papa did,

1904
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:54,686
and she didn't
love him, either.
Not really.

1905
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:58,064
She hurt him. I saw her.
And he never hurt anybody.

1906
01:43:58,149 --> 01:44:00,317
I'm gonna finish this grade
because he gave it to me.

1907
01:44:00,401 --> 01:44:03,194
And then I'll work for her,
but she can't be Papa to me.

1908
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:04,404
She can't ever!

1909
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:05,864
Don't be like that,
baby. Don't.

1910
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:08,241
Leave me alone.
I'm all right.

1911
01:44:08,326 --> 01:44:10,619
Please go away
and leave me alone.

1912
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:15,916
All right, chickabiddy.
All right.

1913
01:44:23,341 --> 01:44:25,342
Mr. Stern.
Yes, sir.

1914
01:44:31,223 --> 01:44:34,184
Francie.
Yes, Mama?

1915
01:44:37,355 --> 01:44:38,688
I want to talk
to you, Francie.

1916
01:44:43,861 --> 01:44:45,195
Yes, Mama.

1917
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:46,905
It isn't gonna be
long now,

1918
01:44:47,657 --> 01:44:49,866
for me, I mean,
my baby.

1919
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,577
We can't come
to a hospital.

1920
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:56,206
There isn't even
gonna be enough money
for a woman to come and help.

1921
01:44:58,459 --> 01:44:59,876
I'm gonna
need you, Francie.

1922
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:04,839
Don't ever be far away.
Neeley's...

1923
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:07,884
Well, a boy ain't much good
at a time like this.

1924
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:10,261
I'm counting
on you, Francie.

1925
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:12,889
You won't forget that,
will you?

1926
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:17,435
All right, Mama.
I'll remember.

1927
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:20,021
Which one of you
is Mr. Stephen Edwards?

1928
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:21,773
That's me.

1929
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:23,733
Well, there are three
in your family now.

1930
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:25,276
You're the father
of a pretty fine boy.

1931
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:27,028
Alive?
Very much so.

1932
01:45:27,113 --> 01:45:28,780
He was a little reluctant
about it at first.

1933
01:45:28,864 --> 01:45:31,324
I had to rouse him
with a little oxygen.
Now, he's mad at me.

1934
01:45:31,409 --> 01:45:33,410
You ought to hear him.
I've got to see him.

1935
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:36,246
Well, neither one of them
are quite up to a visit
just now.

1936
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:37,664
In a little while.

1937
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:39,124
The learning...

1938
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,835
The learning that
saved that baby.

1939
01:45:41,919 --> 01:45:44,045
That's fine, Bill.

1940
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:45,880
Where are you going,
Uncle Bill?

1941
01:45:45,965 --> 01:45:49,009
I'm going out and get
some strawberry ice cream
and a rattle for my son.

1942
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:52,012
And what's more,
my name ain't Bill.
It's Steve.

1943
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:54,764
Do you hear that?
I'm a papa,
and my name's Steve.

1944
01:45:54,849 --> 01:45:56,808
And it's Uncle Steve, too.

1945
01:45:57,226 --> 01:46:00,270
Steve. Steve. Steve.

1946
01:46:00,896 --> 01:46:03,064
So, we have a man
in the family.

1947
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:12,574
As quick as we see
if she's all right,
you go on up to McGarrity's

1948
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:14,325
and see if you can
do my work, too.

1949
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:17,370
I'm gonna finish
her scrubbing for her.
She ought not to do any more.

1950
01:46:17,455 --> 01:46:19,622
She wasn't feeling
good this morning.

1951
01:46:23,252 --> 01:46:24,419
Mama!

1952
01:46:31,802 --> 01:46:33,136
Mama?

1953
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:34,846
In here, Francie.

1954
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:39,350
You wait here.

1955
01:46:42,688 --> 01:46:43,980
You all right, Mama?

1956
01:46:49,779 --> 01:46:52,989
Give Neeley a nickel
to go after
Grandma and Sissy.

1957
01:46:54,075 --> 01:46:56,201
He can walk home after.

1958
01:46:56,285 --> 01:46:58,203
Get me a nightgown
in that bottom drawer.

1959
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:07,670
Hurry! Don't stand
there staring.

1960
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:17,138
Is she going to die?

1961
01:47:17,223 --> 01:47:18,348
Of course not.
It's the baby.

1962
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,266
You heard
what Mama said,
and hurry.

1963
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:22,727
And don't forget
stopping at McGarrity's
on the way back.

1964
01:47:22,812 --> 01:47:26,314
We can't lose the work.
She only wants me now.

1965
01:47:34,532 --> 01:47:35,698
Mama!

1966
01:47:36,408 --> 01:47:37,575
What is it?

1967
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:40,370
I'll be there
in a minute.

1968
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:09,357
You're taking
real good care
of me, Francie.

1969
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:11,734
Am I, Mama?

1970
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:23,371
Mmm.

1971
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,208
Tastes good.

1972
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:39,012
Can I get you
a glass of water, Mama?

1973
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:41,181
When I want something,
I'll ask for it.

1974
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:43,433
Yes, Mama.

1975
01:48:44,727 --> 01:48:48,271
Don't just stand there
and throw questions at me.
I'm too tired.

1976
01:48:49,607 --> 01:48:51,399
You'd better have
some coffee, too.

1977
01:48:51,483 --> 01:48:53,276
Mama, even if
Neeley is a boy,

1978
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,777
wouldn't you rather
have him here?

1979
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:56,112
He's always such
a comfort to you.

1980
01:48:56,197 --> 01:48:58,531
No, it's you
that's a comfort.
Now, what time is it?

1981
01:48:58,616 --> 01:49:00,617
I don't know, Mama.
Get the clock.

1982
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,420
One minute
to 4:00, Mama.

1983
01:49:12,922 --> 01:49:14,464
Are you sure
it isn't slow?

1984
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:16,299
No, Mama.

1985
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:18,468
Maybe it's fast then.

1986
01:49:19,887 --> 01:49:22,180
I'll look at
the jeweler's clock
out the parlor window!

1987
01:49:27,853 --> 01:49:31,606
The candle's pretty
like Christmas.

1988
01:49:35,110 --> 01:49:36,903
That was the night
I told him.

1989
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:47,622
It's nice having a visit
from my daughter.

1990
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:53,169
I didn't want for you
to have to grow up
so soon.

1991
01:49:54,296 --> 01:49:56,756
I didn't want for you
to have to quit school.

1992
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,759
I tried to tell him that.
He didn't mind about the baby

1993
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:02,720
but he never forgive me
for wanting you
to quit school.

1994
01:50:03,681 --> 01:50:06,849
I told him,
and he just went out.

1995
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:09,936
You never
forgive me, either.

1996
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,187
Please don't, Mama.

1997
01:50:11,272 --> 01:50:13,690
He would've
bought you dolls
instead of milk, and...

1998
01:50:13,774 --> 01:50:15,358
I don't know.
Maybe you would've
been happier.

1999
01:50:15,442 --> 01:50:16,484
I don't know.

2000
01:50:16,568 --> 01:50:20,029
I never would've
thought of giving you
that school like he did.

2001
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:22,407
And all them
fine compositions
of yours,

2002
01:50:23,409 --> 01:50:25,076
I never read one of 'em.

2003
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,996
I should've had time.
Johnny did.

2004
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,914
But I couldn't
do no different.

2005
01:50:29,999 --> 01:50:32,000
I don't know
how I could do
any different.

2006
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:40,591
What time is it?

2007
01:50:42,011 --> 01:50:43,845
One minute
after 4:00, Mama.

2008
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:48,099
Wring a cloth
out of cold water
and wipe my face.

2009
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:02,530
Don't let her die.
Please!

2010
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:22,258
Mama, suppose the baby
comes before Grandma
and Aunt Sissy get here?

2011
01:51:22,926 --> 01:51:25,219
You can see I couldn't
do no different, can't you?

2012
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:30,391
Neeley, he don't like school.
If he'd quit,
he'd never go back again.

2013
01:51:31,226 --> 01:51:33,686
But you,
no matter what happens,
you'd find a way to go back.

2014
01:51:33,771 --> 01:51:37,023
You'd fight to go back.
You can see that, can't you?

2015
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:39,525
I...

2016
01:51:41,278 --> 01:51:42,362
Yes, Mama.

2017
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:45,281
Read me something,
Francie.

2018
01:51:45,616 --> 01:51:46,949
Yes, Mama.

2019
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,243
Read me one of
your compositions.

2020
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:51,621
I ain't never read any
of your compositions.

2021
01:51:51,789 --> 01:51:53,122
It's on my conscience.

2022
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:00,380
I tore all those up.

2023
01:52:00,923 --> 01:52:02,465
No, you didn't.

2024
01:52:03,008 --> 01:52:04,133
Not all of them.

2025
01:52:06,595 --> 01:52:09,472
Can't I read
you Shakespeare?
It's much better.

2026
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:12,767
Read "'Twas on
a Night Like This."

2027
01:52:13,185 --> 01:52:15,395
I'd like to have something
pretty on my mind.

2028
01:52:16,313 --> 01:52:17,647
Sit by the candle.

2029
01:52:27,616 --> 01:52:30,785
"The moon shines bright
in such a night as this

2030
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:33,121
"when the sweet wind
did gently kiss the trees."

2031
01:52:33,205 --> 01:52:36,582
Say, did you ever find out
who Troilus was and Cressida?

2032
01:52:36,667 --> 01:52:38,126
Yes, Mama. Troilus was...

2033
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:40,294
Some other day
when I've got time.

2034
01:52:40,379 --> 01:52:42,505
Read me one of
your compositions now.

2035
01:52:43,006 --> 01:52:44,132
You won't like them, Mama.

2036
01:52:44,216 --> 01:52:45,925
You thought about 'em,
and you worked on 'em

2037
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:47,635
and you got
good marks on 'em.

2038
01:52:48,262 --> 01:52:49,345
Get 'em, I said.

2039
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:24,464
Sit here.

2040
01:53:29,011 --> 01:53:30,136
Go on.

2041
01:53:33,307 --> 01:53:37,018
It's called
"The Man People Loved."

2042
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:41,063
Please don't make me
read it, Mama.

2043
01:53:41,148 --> 01:53:42,440
Read it.

2044
01:53:45,903 --> 01:53:51,073
"Perhaps many people
might have said of him
that he was a failure.

2045
01:53:51,867 --> 01:53:54,327
"It is true
that he had no gift
for making money,

2046
01:53:55,037 --> 01:53:56,954
"but he had a gift
for laughter

2047
01:53:57,039 --> 01:53:58,831
"and for making
people love him.

2048
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:01,501
"He had the gift of
making you feel proud

2049
01:54:01,585 --> 01:54:03,336
"to walk down
the street with him.

2050
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:05,963
"He had nothing to
give but himself,

2051
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:09,425
"but of this
he gave generously,
like a king."

2052
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:13,763
"Like a king."
That's like it was.

2053
01:54:14,598 --> 01:54:17,558
Walking down
the street with him,
you always felt like that.

2054
01:54:18,644 --> 01:54:19,810
Did you, Mama?

2055
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:23,689
You're real smart
to write it down
like that, Francie.

2056
01:54:23,774 --> 01:54:25,066
That's like it was.

2057
01:54:27,027 --> 01:54:28,444
Francie.

2058
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:33,282
I miss him so much.

2059
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,996
If the baby's a boy,
we'll call him Johnny.

2060
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:43,501
Where's Sissy?
Neeley's been gone
a long time.

2061
01:54:47,047 --> 01:54:48,422
Wipe my face.

2062
01:54:48,507 --> 01:54:50,299
No, don't let go
of my hand.

2063
01:54:51,969 --> 01:54:56,347
If it's a girl,
we'll call her
Annie Laurie.

2064
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:58,349
Remember that tune
he played?

2065
01:54:58,934 --> 01:55:03,145
You ought to
have piano lessons.
I'll see if I can manage.

2066
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:06,440
You won't forget
to dust the piano,
will you, Francie?

2067
01:55:07,025 --> 01:55:09,402
Who'd cry for me
like that if I died?

2068
01:55:09,486 --> 01:55:12,363
I never did
a wrong thing in my life,
but it ain't enough!

2069
01:55:12,447 --> 01:55:17,326
Sissy,
I didn't mean to be hard
like you said.

2070
01:55:17,869 --> 01:55:19,370
If Johnny was here,

2071
01:55:19,454 --> 01:55:22,039
he could go
to your graduation,
and I'd go to Neeley's.

2072
01:55:22,124 --> 01:55:26,502
But I can't tear myself
into two pieces.

2073
01:55:26,962 --> 01:55:28,462
How am I gonna do both?

2074
01:55:31,883 --> 01:55:33,551
Where are you, Francie?

2075
01:55:33,635 --> 01:55:35,011
I'm here, Mama!

2076
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:40,516
You're such
a comfort to me.

2077
01:55:42,019 --> 01:55:43,185
I'm so tired.

2078
01:55:45,147 --> 01:55:46,689
Leave me sleep now.

2079
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:03,706
You better start
some water boiling.

2080
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:05,374
We'll call you
if there's anything
we need.

2081
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:07,001
I thought
you was never
coming, Sissy.

2082
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:09,670
Come on.
You quit worrying now.

2083
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:39,325
The baby is here
and the mama
is doing good.

2084
01:56:39,743 --> 01:56:40,993
She's asleep.

2085
01:56:41,453 --> 01:56:43,788
A small baby sister,
it is.

2086
01:56:50,545 --> 01:56:51,921
Annie Laurie.

2087
01:56:53,590 --> 01:56:55,091
Papa would've
liked that.

2088
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:04,016
Look, Francie.
Aren't the flowers pretty?

2089
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:08,979
Where's Grandma?

2090
01:57:09,064 --> 01:57:10,940
I got her in a front seat,
so she won't miss a thing.

2091
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:14,235
Isn't your classroom
around here somewheres?

2092
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:15,361
Yes, but I...

2093
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:16,529
How about
giving me a peek?

2094
01:57:16,613 --> 01:57:18,864
Wouldn't hurt me none,
seeing a little
more places like that.

2095
01:57:23,704 --> 01:57:26,163
Hey, Francie,
you forgot your flowers.
They aren't mine.

2096
01:57:26,248 --> 01:57:28,249
I'm not carrying
flowers today.

2097
01:57:28,333 --> 01:57:30,668
Some of the girls,
their family
sends them flowers.

2098
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:33,462
They're on your desk, lamb.
Better go see.

2099
01:57:36,466 --> 01:57:39,301
Well, I have to
get my things anyway.

2100
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,880
He gave me
the money to buy 'em
way before Christmas

2101
01:58:17,174 --> 01:58:18,507
to make sure
he had it, he said.

2102
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:20,926
Then he wrote out the card.

2103
01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:33,439
Come on, kid.

2104
01:58:36,526 --> 01:58:39,945
Let it go, baby.
There ain't a soul
gonna hear. Let it go.

2105
01:58:49,539 --> 01:58:51,081
Frances Nolan.

2106
01:59:02,886 --> 01:59:05,971
Well, sir,
I don't think Grandma said
one word the whole time.

2107
01:59:06,056 --> 01:59:07,932
And from the looks of her
when I put her on
the streetcar,

2108
01:59:08,016 --> 01:59:09,975
she'll probably
ride clear out to
Coney Island

2109
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:11,769
and never know
the difference.

2110
01:59:12,103 --> 01:59:13,437
Heaven knows what
she'd have been like

2111
01:59:13,522 --> 01:59:15,606
if she'd got to
both graduations.

2112
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:19,068
Looks to me like
it was a pretty fine day.
How's your soda, Francie?

2113
01:59:19,152 --> 01:59:20,611
Pineapple's not as
good as chocolate.

2114
01:59:20,737 --> 01:59:22,238
Then why did you
order it for?

2115
01:59:22,322 --> 01:59:24,573
Because I'm up to the "P's."
I'll try raspberry next.

2116
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:26,116
There's something
to that idea.

2117
01:59:26,201 --> 01:59:27,159
Try everything once.

2118
01:59:27,244 --> 01:59:28,327
Sissy!

2119
01:59:28,411 --> 01:59:31,330
And a dime for you, my boy.
This is a special occasion.

2120
01:59:31,414 --> 01:59:32,373
Thank you.

2121
01:59:32,457 --> 01:59:33,582
He don't know
how special it is.

2122
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:34,875
Two diplomas in
the Nolan family

2123
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,126
all in one day?

2124
01:59:36,211 --> 01:59:39,046
Mama, I've got a nickel
if you want to leave it.

2125
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:40,589
People do.

2126
01:59:40,674 --> 01:59:43,008
It's going to be
all right, Francie.

2127
01:59:43,093 --> 01:59:46,262
And you know somethin'?
These ain't gonna be
the last diplomas, either.

2128
01:59:46,346 --> 01:59:47,513
I don't know how
we're gonna work it,

2129
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:49,890
but we're gonna find
some way for you and...

2130
01:59:49,975 --> 01:59:51,976
Hi, Neeley.
How are you doing?

2131
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:54,478
Okay. I got out of jail.

2132
01:59:54,563 --> 01:59:56,856
Say, wasn't it you
I saw working

2133
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:58,649
behind that bat
the other day?

2134
01:59:58,733 --> 01:59:59,817
Why, yeah, but...

2135
01:59:59,901 --> 02:00:01,193
Hey, you were
pretty good.

2136
02:00:01,278 --> 02:00:04,321
You know what?
I'm coming out and give you
some pointers sometime.

2137
02:00:04,406 --> 02:00:06,240
Honest?
Sure, I will.

2138
02:00:06,324 --> 02:00:07,992
That is, if your ma
don't mind.

2139
02:00:08,076 --> 02:00:09,660
Nah, she don't mind.

2140
02:00:09,744 --> 02:00:11,412
Ya mean it?
Sure.

2141
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:15,291
Well, I'll see you
on the lot.

2142
02:00:16,626 --> 02:00:18,252
Maybe you better
ask your ma, you know.

2143
02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:20,546
I don't want to do anything
she wouldn't want me to.

2144
02:00:20,630 --> 02:00:21,922
Nah, she won't care.

2145
02:00:22,007 --> 02:00:24,717
Maybe you'd better ask her
yourself just to make sure.

2146
02:00:24,801 --> 02:00:27,469
I'm Neeley's aunt.
This is his ma.

2147
02:00:28,263 --> 02:00:31,724
But that's his sister.
What's your name,
big boy?

2148
02:00:31,933 --> 02:00:33,017
Herschel Knutsen.

2149
02:00:33,101 --> 02:00:35,895
Mr. Knutsen,
I'd like for you
to meet my niece,

2150
02:00:35,979 --> 02:00:37,771
Miss Francie Nolan.

2151
02:00:39,441 --> 02:00:40,566
Pleased to meet you.

2152
02:00:40,984 --> 02:00:42,151
Hello.

2153
02:00:44,779 --> 02:00:47,990
Nice night if it don't rain.
Sit down, Herschel.

2154
02:00:53,663 --> 02:00:55,831
Doing anything
tomorrow afternoon,
Miss Nolan?

2155
02:00:55,916 --> 02:00:57,124
It's Saturday.

2156
02:00:57,208 --> 02:00:59,460
I don't know. Why?

2157
02:00:59,544 --> 02:01:04,089
Well, there's
a swell picture, Bill Hart.
Maybe you'd like to go.

2158
02:01:04,174 --> 02:01:05,257
Who with?

2159
02:01:05,342 --> 02:01:06,550
Me.

2160
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:08,260
Oh.

2161
02:01:15,977 --> 02:01:19,730
Well, I might be busy.
I'll let you know.

2162
02:01:19,814 --> 02:01:21,899
Well, I'll come
around and see.

2163
02:01:21,983 --> 02:01:24,652
Hey! I thought
we was gonna
play ball tomorrow.

2164
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:26,779
Yeah. Well, we can
do that any time.

2165
02:01:26,863 --> 02:01:28,155
Sure.
There's lots of time.

2166
02:01:28,239 --> 02:01:29,782
Come on, Hersch.

2167
02:01:29,866 --> 02:01:32,451
Well, I'll be
seeing you,
Miss Nolan.

2168
02:01:35,914 --> 02:01:37,289
Him, mushy!

2169
02:01:37,666 --> 02:01:40,125
I'm proud of you,
chickabiddy.
You handled him fine.

2170
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:41,877
It was the hair
that done it.

2171
02:01:41,962 --> 02:01:43,796
Well, I hate to
bust this party up,

2172
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,255
but then babies
got to be fed.

2173
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:47,383
Steve will be needin'
a little something, too.

2174
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:49,760
Three hours with
the both of them.

2175
02:01:49,844 --> 02:01:51,553
Thirty out of 50.
Keep the change.

2176
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:55,015
Well, thank you.
Why, Katie Nolan!

2177
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:56,558
I don't care.

2178
02:01:57,185 --> 02:01:59,019
There's times
when feelin' good

2179
02:01:59,104 --> 02:02:01,230
and things like that
is important.

2180
02:02:01,314 --> 02:02:02,773
I don't care.

2181
02:02:09,239 --> 02:02:11,657
You wanna carry
my flowers, Mama?

2182
02:02:23,128 --> 02:02:25,004
He called ya
"Miss Nolan."

2183
02:02:25,088 --> 02:02:26,880
You missed it, Steve!

2184
02:02:26,965 --> 02:02:29,174
Well, hello, handsome.

2185
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:31,510
I'm beggin' your pardon,
Mrs. Nolan.

2186
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:32,970
I just happened to drop in,

2187
02:02:33,054 --> 02:02:36,640
and your brother-in-law here
seemed to be needing
a little help.

2188
02:02:36,725 --> 02:02:40,769
And the baby
didn't seem to mind, so...
I hope I'm not intrudin'.

2189
02:02:41,646 --> 02:02:44,023
Well, not at all,
Mr. McShane.

2190
02:02:47,152 --> 02:02:51,989
You sit right down.
We're going home.
Come along, Steve.

2191
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,744
I'll take her,
Mr. McShane.

2192
02:02:56,828 --> 02:02:58,662
I'd like it
if you'd leave her.

2193
02:02:58,747 --> 02:03:01,457
Her and me has got
to be good friends.

2194
02:03:04,794 --> 02:03:06,253
Well, I wish you
didn't have to hurry.

2195
02:03:06,337 --> 02:03:08,297
Got to get this
family of mine home.

2196
02:03:08,381 --> 02:03:13,093
Steve's got to deliver milk
to a lot of those babies
that like that bottled kind.

2197
02:03:13,178 --> 02:03:15,804
You don't want to
frown like that, Katie.

2198
02:03:16,556 --> 02:03:18,599
The fellas don't go
for that at all.

2199
02:03:18,683 --> 02:03:20,768
Goodbye, kids.
So long, Mac.

2200
02:03:21,144 --> 02:03:22,936
So long, Mrs. Edwards.

2201
02:03:23,021 --> 02:03:24,980
Thank you, Aunt Sissy.

2202
02:03:28,485 --> 02:03:29,485
Goodbye, Mac.

2203
02:03:29,569 --> 02:03:30,819
Mr. Edwards, goodbye.

2204
02:03:34,657 --> 02:03:35,824
Well...

2205
02:03:37,368 --> 02:03:40,537
Well, I will take
the baby from you,
Mr. McShane.

2206
02:03:48,588 --> 02:03:49,963
Mrs. Nolan.

2207
02:03:53,009 --> 02:03:56,345
Likely you've been wonderin'
why I came here tonight.

2208
02:03:57,972 --> 02:04:01,600
Let your wonderin' be over,
because I came here
on a personal matter.

2209
02:04:01,684 --> 02:04:03,018
Mama, shall I go and...

2210
02:04:03,103 --> 02:04:05,479
No, no, don't be
leaving, children.

2211
02:04:05,563 --> 02:04:09,858
My conversation
will be concernin' you
as well as your mother.

2212
02:04:14,739 --> 02:04:18,909
Mrs. Nolan, I feel that
there's no disrespect

2213
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:20,869
in my speaking
my mind at this time.

2214
02:04:21,621 --> 02:04:25,290
And I feel
a decent time
has elapsed

2215
02:04:25,708 --> 02:04:29,878
since the passin'
of Mrs. McShane,
God rest her soul.

2216
02:04:31,714 --> 02:04:34,133
I didn't know,
Mr. McShane.

2217
02:04:34,217 --> 02:04:35,300
I'm sorry.

2218
02:04:35,385 --> 02:04:36,969
Well, I said nothin',
Mrs. Nolan,

2219
02:04:37,053 --> 02:04:39,847
because it was
near the time of
your own bereavement.

2220
02:04:39,931 --> 02:04:42,057
And I didn't wish to...

2221
02:04:42,142 --> 02:04:44,768
Well, I know
that it's barely
six months now

2222
02:04:44,853 --> 02:04:50,149
since your own husband,
too, left this world.
Rest his soul.

2223
02:04:51,776 --> 02:04:56,155
But when you feel
a decent interval
has elapsed,

2224
02:04:57,073 --> 02:05:00,200
I'm askin' to keep
company with you,
Katherine Nolan,

2225
02:05:00,285 --> 02:05:05,122
with the object of a weddin'
when a decent time
has elapsed.

2226
02:05:08,501 --> 02:05:10,085
And for my part,

2227
02:05:11,796 --> 02:05:14,423
I'll be glad to
keep company with you,
Mr. McShane,

2228
02:05:15,466 --> 02:05:18,177
not for the help
you can give us,

2229
02:05:18,261 --> 02:05:21,138
because we know
we can manage some way.

2230
02:05:21,222 --> 02:05:25,517
But because
you're a good man,
Mr. McShane.

2231
02:05:31,774 --> 02:05:36,486
And there's
one more thing.

2232
02:05:37,822 --> 02:05:43,535
Their father was a fine man,
and I'd have no wish to be
tryin' to take his place.

2233
02:05:44,454 --> 02:05:50,500
It would be more
my intention to be
like a real good friend.

2234
02:05:51,461 --> 02:05:55,130
Now, as the eldest,
would you be approvin'?

2235
02:05:59,427 --> 02:06:00,969
Yes, Mr. McShane.

2236
02:06:05,475 --> 02:06:08,477
I was thinkin' it
wouldn't be right

2237
02:06:08,561 --> 02:06:11,480
for me to ask
the two eldest
to take my name.

2238
02:06:12,315 --> 02:06:17,069
But the little one,
the one who has never
looked on her father,

2239
02:06:17,153 --> 02:06:20,572
could you be thinkin'
of lettin' me
legally adopt her?

2240
02:06:23,284 --> 02:06:28,038
If that time comes,
the child shall
have your name.

2241
02:06:31,918 --> 02:06:34,878
And now I'm wonderin'
if I could smoke my pipe.

2242
02:06:36,714 --> 02:06:38,840
You could have smoked
anytime, Mr. McShane.

2243
02:06:40,385 --> 02:06:43,887
Well, I didn't want
to take any privileges
before I was entitled to 'em.

2244
02:06:48,768 --> 02:06:50,185
Help me put her
to bed, Neeley.

2245
02:06:50,270 --> 02:06:51,478
Why?

2246
02:06:51,562 --> 02:06:53,021
To fix the blankets.

2247
02:07:02,407 --> 02:07:04,866
I'll be heatin' up
the coffee now.

2248
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:11,039
Will ya join me in a cup,
Mr. McShane?

2249
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,376
Thank you, Katherine.
I will.

2250
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:18,880
Annie Laurie McShane.

2251
02:07:20,049 --> 02:07:21,216
Yeah.

2252
02:07:21,301 --> 02:07:23,969
She'll never have
the hard times
we had, will she?

2253
02:07:24,053 --> 02:07:26,430
She'll never have
the fun, either.

2254
02:07:27,265 --> 02:07:29,975
We did have fun
when we were young,
didn't we?

2255
02:07:30,059 --> 02:07:31,184
Yeah.

2256
02:07:31,769 --> 02:07:34,187
Remember the olden days
when we collected junk?

2257
02:07:34,397 --> 02:07:35,814
Poor Laurie.

2258
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:38,942
Neeley,
look at the tree.

2259
02:07:40,278 --> 02:07:43,363
It's growing again,
just like Papa said.

2260
02:07:45,116 --> 02:07:49,870
I feel kind of sad,
like we're saying
goodbye to something.

2261
02:07:49,954 --> 02:07:51,079
Yeah.

2262
02:07:53,791 --> 02:07:55,334
Neeley?
Mmm-hmm?

2263
02:07:57,503 --> 02:07:58,628
Am I good-looking?

2264
02:07:58,713 --> 02:08:00,213
What's eatin' ya?

2265
02:08:00,298 --> 02:08:02,632
No, honest, Neeley.
I wanna know.

2266
02:08:08,014 --> 02:08:09,431
You'll pass.

2267
02:08:10,725 --> 02:08:12,059
You're sweet, Neeley.

2268
02:08:12,143 --> 02:08:13,602
Oh, cut the mush.
