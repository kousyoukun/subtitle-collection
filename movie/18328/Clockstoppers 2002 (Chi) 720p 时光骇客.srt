1
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:54,651
Ladies and gentlemen,
American Airlines is announcing...

2
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:57,750
flight number 1243
to Costa Rica.

3
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:00,762
All passengers holding tickets
for flight 1243...

4
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,039
may now proceed to gate 50-B.

5
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:09,771
Come on.
Put me in with the cargo.

6
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:12,973
Sir, the 10:00 to Costa Rica is booked,
but I can get you out in the morning.

7
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,075
Not if I'm dead, you can't.

8
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,617
Thank you for nothing.

9
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:20,620
Hey, watch it.

10
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,656
Who does he think he is,
somebody important?

11
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:45,777
- Sir, you forgot your keys.
- Keep 'em.

12
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:06,331
I need a vacation...

13
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,301
real bad.

14
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,583
Hey, watch it!

15
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,289
I hope you're happy.

16
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:33,285
Sir?

17
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:15,430
I think it's time you came
back to work, Dr. Dopler.

18
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:49,961
Hey, Zak!

19
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:33,136
Let's take a look
at another example.

20
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,644
Say Amy is out for
a leisurely drive in her VW bug...

21
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,845
and along comes Eddie
in his Ferrari.

22
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,918
Hey, come on, that could happen.
Totally.

23
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:45,646
So, you're doing 20.

24
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,915
Eddie's doing 220.

25
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:51,015
-What does he look like when he goes by?
-I don't know. Just a blur, I guess.

26
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:54,494
Exactly. And if he was going fast
enough, you wouldn't see him at all.

27
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:58,590
From Eddie's point of view, you would
look as if you were standing still.

28
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,101
And that is a basic example...

29
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,865
of Einstein's theory
of what, Eddie?

30
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,736
Highway safety.

31
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:07,001
Relativity.

32
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:08,565
Relativity.

33
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:11,168
- Didn't do your reading assignment?
- That's a funny story.

34
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:13,578
See, science is a discipline.

35
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:17,743
This department has trained
some of the best minds in the world.

36
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,414
But nobody ever gets there
by just coasting along.

37
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,721
I don't mean to sound like your father,
but I take pride in my students.

38
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:28,820
I want to see them succeed. That means
doing the work, being persistent and...

39
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:34,531
not looking for
the quick-fix, easy way out.

40
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:39,264
We'll finish up Einstein when I get back
from the applied science congress.

41
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:41,775
In the meantime,
you guys have a couple days off...

42
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,075
to prepare for your midterm.

43
00:07:54,823 --> 00:07:57,155
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Zak.

44
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:59,159
This is a rare honor.

45
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,957
Come on, I visit you at work
every now and then.

46
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,022
But careful analysis reveals
it's usually because you need something.

47
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,091
That's crazy.

48
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:10,229
Can you co-sign for my car?
I got the down payment together.

49
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:14,241
There's a few cars I liked at Benson's,
and their lot stays open until 9:00.

50
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:16,937
Hold on a second.
Hey, Jer.

51
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,946
Where's my stipend
on the NASA consultation?

52
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:22,142
- We finished that job three months ago.
- Working on it.

53
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:24,242
So maybe we can get there
around 7:00?

54
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,914
Dr. Gibbs, your batch is up on the
mainframe. It's some pretty wild stuff.

55
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:30,617
- I'll be down in a minute.
- What are you working on?

56
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:33,957
Last weekend an old student sent me
a project he's working on with QT Labs.

57
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,964
You remember Earl Dopler. One of the
best students to ever pass through here.

58
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:39,967
That freak who used to come over
and eat a lot of potato salad?

59
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,969
He isn't a freak.
Eccentric, maybe.

60
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:44,130
Anyway, the word on this project
is very hush-hush.

61
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,140
Let's just say that,
hypothetically speaking...

62
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,143
it were possible to accelerate
your molecular structure...

63
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:52,442
until the rest of the world
seemed as if it were standing still.

64
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:55,278
- Cool.
- It's called hypertime.

65
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,480
Imagine being able to perform delicate
surgery between the beats of a heart.

66
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:03,456
This technology is going to
revolutionize medicine, science, travel.

67
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:06,961
Speaking of travel,
a car would be really nice.

68
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:09,258
So, did you download
those consumer reports?

69
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:12,459
I was gonna do that
before you got home, but--

70
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:16,834
-Dad, you already blew me off last week.
-No, I was in a meeting with the dean.

71
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:19,237
Of course that's never
happened before, right?

72
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:22,367
I want you to do your homework on this.
Let's see those safety reports.

73
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:26,073
- And we'll talk about it at home.
- Does that mean we can go tonight?

74
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:28,547
It means we'll talk about it
when I get home.

75
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:29,797
Good enough.

76
00:09:30,865 --> 00:09:32,230
Yes!

77
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,701
It's very safe
and a great father-son activity.

78
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,604
Dude, you made all this
just by selling junk on your computer?

79
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:43,610
Well, one man's junk
is another man's down payment, Meeker.

80
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:46,613
- Start thinking outside the box, man.
- What box?

81
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:51,141
The box you're in that keeps you from
seeing that this $5-an-hour job blows.

82
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:53,380
Dude, I ain't gonna
be here forever.

83
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:55,521
Check it out. Bam!

84
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,152
Plur 102. DJ contest tomorrow night.
I'm signed up.

85
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:02,526
"Underground dance par-tay."

86
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:04,895
Yeah, that's very
"funk-fliggety" of you.

87
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:08,163
Dude, I been practicin'.
Sneaked away from the study hall.

88
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:10,500
Worked the turntables
in the tech room.

89
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,072
- Who is that?
- Hey, dude, where you been?

90
00:10:19,147 --> 00:10:21,377
That's Francesca,
the new girl from Venezuela.

91
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:23,747
She goes to our school?

92
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:25,752
That's gotta be good
for attendance.

93
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:31,087
Tell me about it.
She has PE when I'm in Marching Band.

94
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,923
I get smacked every time
the trombones turn to look at her.

95
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:36,259
- This is perfect.
- What?

96
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,389
Foreign girl
in a foreign land, man.

97
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:40,661
She's all lonely and vulnerable.

98
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:43,670
I read about this in Cosmo.
I gotta go talk to her.

99
00:10:43,738 --> 00:10:45,763
Oh, no, you're gonna get faced.

100
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,673
I'm not gonna get faced, man.
Come on.

101
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:50,608
Watch and learn.

102
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:51,770
Okay.

103
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:54,212
You're gonna get faced.

104
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:01,321
Excuse me.

105
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:02,981
Do you have the time?

106
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:10,085
I mean, you go to my school,
right?

107
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:12,098
I couldn't say.
What school is yours?

108
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:16,600
Jefferson. My friend
watches you in PE.

109
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:19,162
I mean...

110
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,435
you're new, right?

111
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:23,968
Yes.

112
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:25,842
Well, I'm Zak...

113
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:27,505
and I thought--

114
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:31,716
I know it can be kinda lonely
when you first move to a new town.

115
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:34,254
I thought maybe you needed
somebody to show you around.

116
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:37,655
I see.
It's so very hard for me.

117
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:41,752
I try to be brave, exploring the town
all by myself, when all I really want...

118
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:46,163
is to be giving my love to the very
first bozo who wants to know the time.

119
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:49,593
I read Cosmo too.

120
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,102
Right.

121
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:58,441
Okay, well, I'll see you
in school then. Okay?

122
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:04,951
Hey, you did good, man.
I think she likes you.

123
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:25,167
Are you watching this?

124
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:28,936
He was so cute, and now he's all,
"I'm a gangsta, yo."

125
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,501
Yeah, I was in earlier
about the Mustang.

126
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:33,513
You still have it, right?
Cool.

127
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,516
I will be there later tonight
with the down payment.

128
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:38,449
Okay. Thank you.

129
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,647
- What are you doing?
- This way it's more like homemade.

130
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:46,216
I want us to have a nice dinner tonight
before your dad goes to his conference.

131
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:48,592
- He's taking me to buy a car tonight.
- After dinner.

132
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:50,597
Mom, can I have some money?

133
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:53,156
Did you do your chores?

134
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:57,261
Have I told you lately
how much I respect and admire you?

135
00:12:57,338 --> 00:13:00,364
Buy a car,
give money to Satan.

136
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:03,376
You're so lucky
you're an only child.

137
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:06,140
Hey, Mom says
we can go after dinner...

138
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:08,943
which is cool because they're open
till 9:00, so we should still make it.

139
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:11,143
- Make what?
- The car lot.

140
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:14,278
They've got a Mustang convertible.
I'm gonna trick it out with a V-8.

141
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:17,381
Consumer Reports
rated it a best buy--

142
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,392
good reliability,
decent gas mileage...

143
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,395
and pretty good crash test scores
for a convertible.

144
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:25,091
Okay, so what else
have you compared it to?

145
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,100
Nothing.
That's the car I want.

146
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:30,103
You're not gonna prove your case
by ignoring all the other data.

147
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:32,105
It's not a clinical trial, Dad.

148
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:35,108
If something's right, you gotta close
your eyes, grit your teeth and hang on.

149
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:38,111
No, you gotta step back, weigh the
options and make a calculated choice.

150
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:40,773
I want you to do
your homework on this.

151
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:44,784
If the Mustang is the car you want when
I get back, that's the car we'll get.

152
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:48,288
It's not gonna be there when you
get back. Just come look at it tonight.

153
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:51,416
When I get back. I gotta
go over Dopler's project tonight.

154
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:55,155
- You haven't heard from him in a week.
- Yes, but I promised to get to it.

155
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:58,665
That's what this is about, isn't it?
This isn't about looking at other cars.

156
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,667
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing!

157
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:04,894
You always have time for your students
and never for your own kids.

158
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:06,735
Now he's concerned about me.

159
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:09,640
Hey, I asked you
to come to this conference.

160
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,645
- Who was it who said he was too busy?
- The Congress of Applied Science?

161
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:16,149
- There's fun for the whole family.
- Stop it. Sit!

162
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,981
Eat.
Kelly, get off the phone.

163
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:21,078
- Okay.
- Come on, you guys.

164
00:14:21,155 --> 00:14:23,589
Some of history's greatest
peace treaties have been signed...

165
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:25,921
over green beans
and beef Stroganoff.

166
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:27,688
I'm not hungry.

167
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:30,526
- Zak, I promise I'll take you--
- Tell it to Dopler.

168
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:50,249
I don't know how you work
in all this mess.

169
00:14:55,723 --> 00:14:57,657
Honey, I was gonna
fix that for you.

170
00:14:57,725 --> 00:15:00,193
I bought a new toaster
a year ago.

171
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,064
Yeah, yeah, I know.

172
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:11,161
I don't wanna leave with something
like this between Zak and me either.

173
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:13,331
It's just--

174
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:17,241
He's got so much potential
and, yeah, right now he can skate by...

175
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:19,404
but it's gonna catch up to him.

176
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,210
Maybe. But he's finding
his own way, George.

177
00:15:22,283 --> 00:15:26,379
Just because it isn't your way
doesn't mean that he's lost.

178
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:32,017
Okay, let me put this back together
and I'll go up and make peace.

179
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:33,526
Okay.

180
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:36,696
Don't forget.
You know how you get down here.

181
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:39,062
No, no, I promise.
Two minutes, hon.

182
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,792
Come in.

183
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:21,867
- Wanna talk about anything before I go?
- No, I'm good.

184
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:32,184
This is...

185
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:34,751
my itinerary...

186
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:38,858
and my hotel, in case you
need to get in touch with me.

187
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:41,428
Thanks.

188
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:45,790
Have fun
with your science friends.

189
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:57,376
What?

190
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:02,012
We'll work it out
when I get back.

191
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:16,728
Mr. Gates, I don't make policy,
but I do enforce it.

192
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:18,924
So they're shutting me down.

193
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:22,025
Hey, you knew it was
a black ops contract.

194
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:25,367
The administration found out about it.
They want it to go away.

195
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,273
Well, you need to make them understand
the significance of what we're doing.

196
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:33,211
Look, Gates, I supported you on this
as long as I could...

197
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,214
but they've got a point.

198
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:38,774
What if one of the Saddams of the world
gets his hands on this stuff?

199
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:41,548
The fact is, he can waltz
right through an entire army...

200
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:44,182
plant an A-bomb
in the president's bathtub...

201
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:47,352
and all our smart bombs and satellites
would be useless to stop him.

202
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,555
I'm not even finished
building it...

203
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,121
and they have me selling it
on the black market?

204
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,759
Mr. Gates...

205
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:57,804
the NSA expect your research,
your equipment...

206
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:00,465
the whole shooting match crated
and ready for pickup on Monday.

207
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,270
And if I'm not ready?

208
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,077
We're taking it
whether you're ready or not.

209
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,591
Restricted access requested.

210
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:25,598
Please step forward
for retinal scan.

211
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:30,595
Have a nice day, Henry Gates.

212
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:33,304
You all right?

213
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:34,806
Yes. Why?

214
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,088
- How's he doing?
- Seems okay.

215
00:18:58,165 --> 00:18:59,928
But he wrote that
a half hour ago.

216
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:09,937
How dramatic.

217
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:14,036
And charming.

218
00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:15,979
All right.

219
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:17,778
Bring him down.

220
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,706
Hello, Dr. Dopler.
How are things in hypertime?

221
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:52,943
"How are things in hypertime"?

222
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,454
Look at me.
I've been in here a week.

223
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:58,685
- It's like I've aged 20 years.
- At least 20. Maybe more.

224
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,818
Why don't you just kill me now?

225
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:03,522
I was hoping
that wouldn't be necessary.

226
00:20:03,597 --> 00:20:05,064
Besides, it's your own fault.

227
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:07,862
If you'd solved the aging glitch
in the original design...

228
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:10,597
we wouldn't have had to
bring you back to build this.

229
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:15,165
The molecular stabilizer should reverse
the aging effects in hypertime...

230
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:19,235
but I'm having a little trouble
with the program and--

231
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:22,771
Earl, the NSA wants all our toys
in three days.

232
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:24,942
Well, they're their toys, right?

233
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:29,182
They don't know the watches work yet,
and I don't intend to turn them over.

234
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:31,850
Besides, how can I
enjoy the power of hypertime...

235
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:35,588
if every time I use it
I end up looking old?

236
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:36,594
Like you.

237
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:39,223
I want this fixed in 48 hours.

238
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,768
Dude, that is impossible.

239
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:45,634
Well, then I guess
I will have to kill you.

240
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:50,276
Wait, wait, wait.

241
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:53,479
Maybe I could do it faster.

242
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:58,378
I mean, I'm still waiting
on some data from a friend.

243
00:20:58,452 --> 00:20:59,942
A friend?

244
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,923
Well, no, I mean--

245
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:09,656
I can trust this guy.
He's on the outside, but he's cool.

246
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,393
He's my college professor. If anybody
can crack the math on this, it's him.

247
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:16,068
What data did you send him?

248
00:21:19,006 --> 00:21:20,940
Well, actually, l--

249
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:23,437
I sent him a watch.

250
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,603
You idiot!

251
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,584
I want that watch back.

252
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,876
Mom! Zak's pants
knocked over Dad's stuff!

253
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:02,576
Dad was gonna fix this for me
so I could sell it. Figures.

254
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:04,583
When your father's old and gray...

255
00:22:04,651 --> 00:22:07,586
you're gonna regret not having
a better relationship with him.

256
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:09,588
There's plenty of time for that.

257
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:18,497
Where are you guys going?
I made breakfast!

258
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:32,936
Oh, no, that's it.
Get off the bike.

259
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:38,044
Hey, "Freaker," you trippin'
on some bad lunch meat?

260
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:40,882
I hear you signed up
for the spin-off tonight.

261
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:42,546
Ditmar, lay off.

262
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:45,182
Yo, yo, yo,
I ain't on him, all right?

263
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:47,158
Listen up here, buddy.

264
00:22:47,227 --> 00:22:49,855
Tonight it's just gonna be
me and you on stage.

265
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,865
You aren't gonna have
your little sister backing you up.

266
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:56,869
What was that? 'Cause all I hear is
a crowd going, "Go, Meeker! Go, Meeker!"

267
00:22:56,937 --> 00:22:58,871
This guy's hot, man!

268
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:00,839
I need to cool him off!

269
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,301
Later, jerk-wad.

270
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:07,812
Let's go.

271
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:15,081
I'm Dit-O. I'm spinning
at Underground tonight. Wanna come?

272
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:19,319
- You won't leave me hanging tonight?
- No, dude, I'll be there.

273
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:23,227
Relax.
He probably blows anyway, man.

274
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:25,230
I gotta go do
something about this.

275
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:28,995
Oh, what's the matter?
¿No habla inglés?

276
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:33,699
No, it's so very hard for me.
But I try to watch and learn.

277
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:36,436
- Oh, I'm sure you do.
- Like this!

278
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,943
Later, jerk-wad.

279
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:41,039
All right, make a hole, boys.

280
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:43,105
Yo, I got a hole for ya.

281
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:48,946
That's a perfectly good trash can.
Don't be throwing students at it.

282
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:51,961
Come on, both of you.
You okay?

283
00:23:52,095 --> 00:23:54,154
Yeah, I'm okay.

284
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,460
- Move it.
- He started it!

285
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,967
I don't care who started it.
You finished it.

286
00:23:59,035 --> 00:24:00,900
I didn't need any help.

287
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,029
I wasn't-- I wasn't--

288
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:06,132
I was looking for my buddy's retainer
in the garbage.

289
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:08,837
These band freaks
always, you know--

290
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:12,177
Right. Very nice.
Now, if you'll excuse me--

291
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:14,808
Okay, well,
since I have you here...

292
00:24:14,884 --> 00:24:18,479
I'd just like to apologize
for being such a loser yesterday.

293
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:21,319
- Only yesterday?
- No, every day.

294
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:25,020
Hey, I'll apologize for global warming
if you'll give me another chance.

295
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:27,358
A cup of coffee after school.
Come on.

296
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,455
I'm sorry, I have plans.

297
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:32,467
- Okay, how about after your plans?
- I have more plans.

298
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,700
Would it be such a stretch
for some of your plans to include me?

299
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:39,173
All right.

300
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:41,870
I guess we all deserve
a second chance.

301
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:43,378
Here's my address.

302
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:47,449
The only thing is, I have to
baby-sit my brother and sister...

303
00:24:47,517 --> 00:24:49,644
but you can come by around 4:00.

304
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,812
Okay. Yeah, 4:00.

305
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:54,721
Yeah-- I mean, yeah,
that's probably okay, I think.

306
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:57,259
- Okay, so I'll see you then.
- Great.

307
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:34,422
I thought maybe we could spend some time
by the pool while the sun's still nice.

308
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:38,957
Yeah, works for me.
Catch some rays. Great.

309
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:40,969
There's another rake over there.

310
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:44,038
Rake?

311
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:47,166
Right. Right.

312
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:49,108
When I said "second chance"...

313
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:53,444
I was thinking dinner and a movie
or a cup of coffee.

314
00:25:53,516 --> 00:25:57,316
I told you I had plans,
and you asked if they could include you.

315
00:25:58,421 --> 00:25:59,854
I did, didn't I?

316
00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:02,483
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

317
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:03,991
Look at it this way.

318
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,325
You go to a movie,
you can't have a conversation.

319
00:26:07,397 --> 00:26:09,490
You go out for coffee,
there's always a lull.

320
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:12,762
This way when there's a lull,
at least my leaves get raked.

321
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:17,035
Yeah, well, are you gonna do
the whole thing by hand?

322
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:20,475
Yeah. My father says
it develops self-discipline.

323
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:23,512
That's what people always say
when they want you to do stuff for free.

324
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:30,517
I got a better idea.

325
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:43,126
Stop that!

326
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,760
Stop! You're supposed
to be helping.

327
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:48,497
- Sorry.
- Silly.

328
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:50,698
So where did you move
after that?

329
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:53,799
When I was 15,
we left Caracas to go to London.

330
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:56,743
Just when I was making friends,
we got transferred here.

331
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:58,838
Wow, you've lived everywhere.

332
00:26:58,915 --> 00:27:03,079
My dad took us to Legoland once.
Had the Taj Mahal and the Eiffel Tower.

333
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:06,019
Don't feel bad.
At least you have a place to call home.

334
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:10,025
Yeah, I guess, but it must be
pretty cool being a consul's daughter.

335
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:12,323
That makes you, like, royalty,
doesn't it?

336
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:14,829
Right. I'm waited on
hand and foot.

337
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:21,603
I would like to catch
the dog that does this.

338
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:23,605
I was gonna make us
iced cappuccinos.

339
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:27,074
Cappuccino? We don't have to
paint the house or wash the car first?

340
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:28,576
No!

341
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:32,471
Here, here, I'll do that.

342
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:35,483
I'll finish up out here
and you start on the caffeine.

343
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:37,246
- Really?
- Yeah.

344
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,448
Great. Maybe we'll still
have time for a swim.

345
00:27:40,523 --> 00:27:42,013
- Yeah?
- What time is it?

346
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:43,752
I don't know.

347
00:27:43,826 --> 00:27:45,555
No, I do. Hold on.
It's...

348
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:48,324
16:57.

349
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:49,729
Whatever that is.

350
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,733
Right.
I'll be right back.

351
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:57,200
A little coffee, a little swim.

352
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:59,070
That's what I'm talking about.

353
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:08,049
Whoa.

354
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:22,296
Go! Go! Get outta here!

355
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,799
You big rat! Come on!

356
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:28,636
Seriously,
don't make me kick your ass.

357
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:41,248
Whoa.

358
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:43,114
Hey, Francesca.

359
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:45,120
I think I found
your troublemaker.

360
00:28:45,188 --> 00:28:48,624
Whatever you guys are throwing away,
it gave this guy a heart attack.

361
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,919
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

362
00:28:52,995 --> 00:28:54,428
Oh, boy.

363
00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:00,829
Get him out! Help!
Get him out!

364
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:15,045
I'm sorry. I am sorry.
I swear he was dead.

365
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:18,019
What is wrong with you?
We were having such a good time.

366
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:21,716
- You can't work alone for two seconds!
- I was out there for a half hour!

367
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:24,726
Half an hour?
I just walked in here.

368
00:29:24,794 --> 00:29:27,092
"Hypertime exposure."
That's weird.

369
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:29,893
Maybe you should just go.

370
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:32,526
- We were gonna go swimming.
- Swimming?

371
00:29:32,602 --> 00:29:34,832
You want swimming?
I'll give you swimming.

372
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:40,141
No way.

373
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:43,978
No...

374
00:29:45,081 --> 00:29:46,514
Way.

375
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:01,062
Wow, you have nice skin.

376
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,834
This is weird.

377
00:30:13,943 --> 00:30:16,571
How did you do that?

378
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:18,079
I have no idea.

379
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:22,379
Look, I don't know what you're up to,
but out you go. Come on, out.

380
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:25,215
Come on. Out. Let's go.

381
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:26,516
Out.

382
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:28,648
Wait, wait.
Something weird is going on.

383
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:32,353
- You and your rat, that's what's weird.
- No, I'm not trying to freak you out.

384
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:34,521
I just pushed this button.

385
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:51,546
That's what I'm saying.

386
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:55,616
So...

387
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:58,352
you did this?

388
00:31:00,323 --> 00:31:02,416
I think it was the watch.

389
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:08,187
My dad consults on these
super-secret projects...

390
00:31:08,264 --> 00:31:10,892
and I think
this is one of them.

391
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:13,401
So, your watch stops time?

392
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,294
No. Look.

393
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:28,182
It's moving.

394
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:33,020
Wow.

395
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,593
Wow.

396
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:46,597
"QT"?
That's where Dopler works.

397
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,604
This must be the thing
my dad is helping him with.

398
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:52,835
He said something about it
accelerating your molecules so fast...

399
00:31:52,908 --> 00:31:56,173
the rest of the world
would seem like it was standing still.

400
00:31:56,245 --> 00:31:59,840
I don't think time has stopped.
I think we're just moving really fast.

401
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,356
He said it was theoretical. I had
no idea he'd actually built the thing.

402
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:18,528
Look at this.

403
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:36,207
- Why did I speed up and not my brother?
- I don't know.

404
00:32:36,285 --> 00:32:37,547
Let's find out.

405
00:32:42,524 --> 00:32:43,582
It's about time.

406
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:51,290
Did I leave you in hypertime?
I'm sorry.

407
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:55,835
I guess for this to work
we have to be touching each other.

408
00:32:57,072 --> 00:32:59,905
Sooner or later all guys say that.
Now what?

409
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,837
Well...

410
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:04,936
with such awesome power...

411
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:06,947
comes awesome responsibility.

412
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:09,381
At least that's
what my dad would say.

413
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:11,385
But he's not here, is he?

414
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,000
Where do we start?

415
00:33:34,076 --> 00:33:37,409
There's that woman who's always
giving me parking tickets.

416
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:40,573
Look at her. She writes them
before the meter even expires.

417
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:43,584
She has offended
my sense of justice.

418
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,722
Needs something more.

419
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:52,055
Yeah.

420
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:54,527
Whoa, perfect.
Come on.

421
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:04,538
Looks like we got
our own little Picasso here.

422
00:34:04,606 --> 00:34:07,541
Well, he's about to enter
his blue period.

423
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:10,978
Nice nose ring.

424
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:13,037
That's Meeker's bike
he's stealing.

425
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:20,253
Oh, I don't believe this.

426
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:24,759
This guy promised me that
he'd hold this car for 24 hours.

427
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:29,764
Well, it's just not right
to break a promise.

428
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,704
Shall we?

429
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:38,706
Make it so, Number One.

430
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:42,936
- What? We have Star Trek in Venezuela.
- Do it.

431
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,411
Dude, wait up!
Don't leave me like this!

432
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,922
Help!

433
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:31,607
All right?

434
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,950
DJ Swamp!
What's the deal, DJ?

435
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:52,232
Come on!

436
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,240
All right?

437
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:06,007
The people have decided, baby!

438
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:09,708
DJ Swamp is the winner
of this round!

439
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,814
Let's keep this thing goin'!

440
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:21,055
Let's get to our next two DJs!

441
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:24,023
First up, we got DJ Dit-O!

442
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:29,529
Boo!

443
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,542
We also got DJ Meeker!

444
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:39,609
- Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
- Where is he?

445
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:50,954
All right, Dit-O, it's your time
to shine, baby! Let's do this!

446
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:21,719
Yeah!

447
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,451
What's up, Meek?
Are you ready?

448
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,494
You suck!

449
00:37:41,075 --> 00:37:42,940
That's weak!

450
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,912
He really is not
very smooth, is he?

451
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,555
No way!

452
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,167
I can't take this anymore.

453
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:54,575
He needs so much help.
Here, stand him up first.

454
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:56,412
Okay.
What are we doing?

455
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:58,816
A little dance lesson.

456
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:01,650
First off, let's give him
a little attitude.

457
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,086
Get one arm
while I grab the other and pull him.

458
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,256
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

459
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:56,469
This is wrong.
This is absolutely wrong.

460
00:39:56,544 --> 00:39:57,977
No, it's Swan Lake.

461
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:45,616
Go, Meeker! Go, Meeker!
Go, Meeker!

462
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:48,763
- How's your head?
- I thought I was gonna wet my pants!

463
00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:52,199
- How's your head?
- I thought I was gonna wet my pants!

464
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:55,959
This hypertime thing
is so trippy.

465
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:59,529
I knew it wasn't me doing the moving,
but I couldn't feel you guys moving me.

466
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:02,337
Actually, I think your boy Dit-O
did wet his pants.

467
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:06,112
Zak, your watch is off the hook!

468
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,943
What we gonna do next?

469
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:11,109
Hey, let's dress Coach Wells up
like Britney Spears.

470
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:13,050
Oh, man!

471
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:14,554
Why not?

472
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:17,989
- Didn't you say you have to get home?
- Hey, forget that. Forget that!

473
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,152
Leslie Miller
has a slumber party tonight.

474
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:24,289
You know she got that pool,
and the girls get naked.

475
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,860
Or we could go to Vegas!

476
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:29,368
Go to Vegas!

477
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:33,230
Genius, hey!
We're not going anywhere.

478
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:37,243
My dad finds out I took the watch,
I'm gonna be grounded forever.

479
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:38,573
So--

480
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:40,511
Man!

481
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,310
It's right up here.

482
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,324
You gotta be kidding me.

483
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:56,029
Oh, all right, fine.

484
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,031
I can take a hint.

485
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,303
You sure you don't want me
to come with you? I got this plan--

486
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:08,868
Okay, man!

487
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,104
See you Monday, Meeker.

488
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:13,113
- Good night.
- Yeah, okay.

489
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:15,376
Y'all have fun makin' out.

490
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,349
Watch this.

491
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:21,769
Oh, yeah, that's funny, Zak.
That's real funny.

492
00:42:21,902 --> 00:42:25,235
You're abusing your powers!
I'm gonna call the Super Friends on you!

493
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:28,764
Oh, it's on now!
I'm gonna get you for this!

494
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,349
- So--
- So--

495
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:45,825
That didn't turn out so bad after all,
Mr. Second Chance Man.

496
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:47,827
Yeah, well, the way I figure it...

497
00:42:47,895 --> 00:42:52,127
if you make a bad first impression,
things can only get better from there.

498
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:55,532
Right, and you take the prize
on both counts.

499
00:43:00,474 --> 00:43:02,408
I'd better go.

500
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:04,068
- Now?
- Yeah?

501
00:43:09,617 --> 00:43:11,983
At midnight
my father blinks the porch light...

502
00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:14,247
and I turn back into a pumpkin.

503
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:17,017
Yeah, I should probably go too.

504
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:19,821
Although midnight
could be a pretty long time off.

505
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:23,421
Stop that. What, do you think that
magic watch is gonna get you a kiss?

506
00:43:25,032 --> 00:43:28,195
I just wanted to spend
more time with you.

507
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:29,702
You don't need magic.

508
00:43:43,484 --> 00:43:45,008
What?

509
00:43:45,085 --> 00:43:47,679
I wanted to kiss you.

510
00:43:47,755 --> 00:43:50,315
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Second Chance Man.

511
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:52,359
I had fun.

512
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:25,035
Shut up! Shut up!

513
00:46:26,113 --> 00:46:28,707
Who are you?
What do you people want?

514
00:46:28,782 --> 00:46:31,580
- Duh! They want to kill you, man.
- Why? What did I do?

515
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:35,952
Because you showed up, and you've got
something that's not supposed to exist.

516
00:46:36,023 --> 00:46:40,426
Now grab those wires under the dash.
Go, go, go, go!

517
00:46:40,494 --> 00:46:42,758
Okay, now bite the green one.

518
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:48,334
Okay, that's not it.

519
00:46:48,402 --> 00:46:53,203
Okay, strip the red wire with your teeth
and touch it to the steering column.

520
00:46:53,273 --> 00:46:56,208
Come on! Hurry up, man!
Just bite it!

521
00:46:57,277 --> 00:46:59,074
Okay, go.

522
00:47:01,014 --> 00:47:03,073
Hurry, man, they're coming!
Go!

523
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,244
Come on! You're gonna
have to drive! Go, go, go!

524
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,050
- He's in the van!
- Come on!

525
00:47:30,511 --> 00:47:32,877
Whoa, man!
You are gonna get us killed.

526
00:47:32,946 --> 00:47:35,847
- This is not as easy as it looks.
- Yeah, I know, but--

527
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:37,440
Whoa!

528
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,120
- Who are those guys?
- You don't want to know.

529
00:47:50,597 --> 00:47:53,191
- What were they shooting at me?
- Liquid nitrogen.

530
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:55,428
It's a quick and dirty comedown
from hypertime.

531
00:47:55,502 --> 00:47:58,369
The cold slows
your molecular activity.

532
00:48:05,712 --> 00:48:08,476
Probably faster
to gnaw off my hand.

533
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:11,177
So, is it me or are they
trying to kill you too?

534
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:13,981
Yeah, they're probably up
for a two-fer at this point.

535
00:48:19,092 --> 00:48:21,356
Hang on!

536
00:48:30,304 --> 00:48:31,896
All right.

537
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:36,409
Whoa.

538
00:48:37,878 --> 00:48:39,402
- Give me the watch.
- No!

539
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,142
- Give me the watch!
- Or what? You'll adjust me to death?

540
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,445
"Adjust me to death."
That's great.

541
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:47,316
Give me the watch!

542
00:48:48,455 --> 00:48:51,583
- You crazy lunatic!
- "Crazy lunatic"? That's redundant.

543
00:49:51,718 --> 00:49:53,652
Give me that! Come on!

544
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:27,377
Hey, dude!

545
00:50:27,454 --> 00:50:30,014
Whatever you do,
don't get it wet!

546
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:43,864
So strange.

547
00:50:43,937 --> 00:50:46,371
Seems fine...

548
00:50:46,439 --> 00:50:50,808
although his vitals are elevated.

549
00:50:50,877 --> 00:50:54,335
Oh, here he comes.

550
00:50:54,414 --> 00:50:57,247
How you doing, Sleeping Beauty?
You okay? You all right?

551
00:50:57,317 --> 00:51:00,081
- Where'd you get the van, kid?
- Not now. Let him breathe.

552
00:51:01,654 --> 00:51:03,588
- Mom.
- Zak! Is he okay?

553
00:51:03,656 --> 00:51:06,090
He'll be fine.
It was just a mild concussion.

554
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:08,389
- How you feeling?
- Okay, I think.

555
00:51:08,461 --> 00:51:11,055
- Good. So you can stand trial.
- What?

556
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:14,396
Hello! You stole a van
and crashed it.

557
00:51:14,467 --> 00:51:17,630
Can I have his room
while he's in jail? Please?

558
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:22,437
- You almost got killed on that joyride.
- Honey, you had us so worried.

559
00:51:22,509 --> 00:51:26,809
I don't know what got into him.
He's a good kid. Really.

560
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,279
Cool!

561
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:31,374
This doesn't have to go
on his record, does it?

562
00:51:31,451 --> 00:51:33,043
No, you don't understand.

563
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,452
I was in hypertime with these guys,
and they were after my watch.

564
00:51:37,657 --> 00:51:40,490
It's a molecular accelerator.
Here.

565
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:46,464
Oh, man. It's broken.

566
00:51:46,533 --> 00:51:48,296
- They're gonna kill me.
- Who?

567
00:51:48,368 --> 00:51:51,428
- These guys! They were in our house.
- What?

568
00:51:51,504 --> 00:51:53,438
You couldn't see 'em.
They were invisible.

569
00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:56,236
- Oh, yeah, right.
- Here you go, sir.

570
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:58,800
I said creamer, you twit.

571
00:51:58,878 --> 00:52:01,073
- Is he gonna be okay?
- I can't stay here.

572
00:52:01,147 --> 00:52:02,114
Nurse. Thank you.

573
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:05,016
Oh, crap.

574
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:08,086
Come here.

575
00:52:08,154 --> 00:52:12,250
- Oh, he's so faking it.
- Yeah. Yeah. I am faking it.

576
00:52:12,325 --> 00:52:14,259
I'm sorry I stole the van.

577
00:52:14,327 --> 00:52:17,819
I would love to tell you all about it,
but first I have to pee.

578
00:52:28,775 --> 00:52:30,208
Come on, come on.

579
00:52:30,944 --> 00:52:32,377
What are you doing?

580
00:52:34,347 --> 00:52:36,781
I can't go
unless there's some noise.

581
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,146
Come on.

582
00:52:46,192 --> 00:52:49,059
- Get some coffee.
- Let's go!

583
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:38,508
I don't want to hear
any excuses.

584
00:53:40,446 --> 00:53:42,107
Just get back here.

585
00:53:42,182 --> 00:53:45,879
I've got something I want delivered
to our contact at the FBI.

586
00:53:46,953 --> 00:53:50,582
A little publicity should help
flush out Dopler and the kid.

587
00:53:50,657 --> 00:53:53,387
Because we can't kill
what we can't find.

588
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:56,587
But without Dopler, how do you
finish the molecular stabilizer?

589
00:53:56,663 --> 00:53:58,597
Who needs the student...

590
00:54:00,033 --> 00:54:03,149
when the teacher
is so close at hand?

591
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:13,256
Hot Skates.
Junior Associate Meeker speaking.

592
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:15,954
I need to borrow your mom's car.

593
00:54:18,498 --> 00:54:21,058
What's going on?
The cops are looking for you.

594
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:23,567
Just turn around slowly.
Be cool.

595
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,831
You don't want to be seen
with me right now.

596
00:54:27,673 --> 00:54:30,767
Okay, go home and get the keys
to your mom's Subaru.

597
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:33,744
What? Are you crazy?

598
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:37,476
Somebody is trying to kill me over this
watch, and it doesn't even work now.

599
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:41,179
Okay, dude, but you don't need a Subaru.
What you need is the police.

600
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:46,658
I just came from the police. Look at me.
They weren't as helpful as you'd think.

601
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:50,826
I need to go to Kingston to find my dad.
He might know who these people are.

602
00:54:50,897 --> 00:54:52,922
Dude, that's a six-hour drive, man.

603
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,767
I gotta go.

604
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,200
Budget cuts.

605
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:35,632
Okay, Mr. Invisible,
where are you?

606
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:39,310
That's nice.

607
00:55:41,414 --> 00:55:45,043
What are you doing in there?
Did you break into my house just to pee?

608
00:55:45,117 --> 00:55:47,711
No, actually...

609
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:50,216
to use the phone too.

610
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:52,189
What are you wearing?

611
00:55:52,258 --> 00:55:54,192
I know this sounds weird...

612
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,752
and it's the last thing you want to
hear from a guy after one date, but...

613
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:02,426
the cops are looking for me everywhere
and I've got no place else to go.

614
00:56:02,501 --> 00:56:06,335
I need to borrow some clothes and money
for a bus. I promise I'll pay you back.

615
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:08,339
- Okay?
- You are freaking me out.

616
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:11,103
- What is going on?
- It's a long story.

617
00:56:11,177 --> 00:56:13,111
The less you know, the better.

618
00:56:16,349 --> 00:56:19,284
Things with the watch
have gotten really twisted.

619
00:56:19,352 --> 00:56:22,549
I gotta get to Kingston and find my dad,
because they could be after him too.

620
00:56:22,622 --> 00:56:25,182
Who is after who?
What is happening?

621
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,487
I don't know who they are.

622
00:56:28,828 --> 00:56:32,286
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come here.

623
00:56:32,365 --> 00:56:34,230
Wait. Slow down.

624
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,734
Come over here and just relax.

625
00:56:38,337 --> 00:56:40,703
I'm glad that you came.
I am.

626
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:45,710
But if we're gonna be friends,
you have to tell me what is happening.

627
00:57:01,861 --> 00:57:05,092
I told my brother I was getting
the car washed, so bring it back clean.

628
00:57:05,865 --> 00:57:07,298
Okay.

629
00:57:10,436 --> 00:57:12,495
I can't thank you enough.

630
00:57:13,706 --> 00:57:15,970
- Call me when you find him?
- Yeah.

631
00:57:50,776 --> 00:57:52,209
What are you doing?

632
00:57:53,279 --> 00:57:55,941
You raked my leaves.
I can't let you go alone.

633
00:58:08,394 --> 00:58:10,692
He's been calling all day.

634
00:58:10,763 --> 00:58:13,698
This is the first chance I've had
to check my messages.

635
00:58:13,766 --> 00:58:16,200
George, listen, calm down.

636
00:58:16,268 --> 00:58:19,396
The police want you to stay there
in case Zak calls again.

637
00:58:19,472 --> 00:58:21,667
If he shows up here
I'll let you know.

638
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:24,335
If he's giving you any trouble,
I can talk to him.

639
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,503
Fine.

640
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:28,843
I just feel helpless,
sitting here waiting.

641
00:58:28,914 --> 00:58:30,211
Welcome to the club!

642
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:32,809
I'm sorry.

643
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:34,409
I didn't mean it like that.

644
00:58:34,487 --> 00:58:37,547
I've been everywhere trying to track
him down, and we couldn't reach you.

645
00:58:37,623 --> 00:58:40,421
All right,
let's go over your list.

646
00:58:44,597 --> 00:58:48,260
Hi. I need the room number
for Dr. George Gibbs.

647
00:58:48,334 --> 00:58:50,268
He's here with the convention.

648
00:58:50,336 --> 00:58:51,769
And you are?

649
00:58:54,006 --> 00:58:55,598
In a hurry.

650
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,845
Yeah.

651
00:59:12,691 --> 00:59:14,625
Let me see what I can do.

652
00:59:18,164 --> 00:59:21,395
I never should have left
with something like this between us.

653
00:59:21,467 --> 00:59:24,459
- Did he try to explain his behavior?
- Not really.

654
00:59:24,537 --> 00:59:28,200
I mean, he rambled on a bit
when he came to, but--

655
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:29,866
Oh, wait.

656
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:33,878
He said something about his watch being
a molecular accelerator or something.

657
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:35,641
Molecular accelerator?

658
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:41,310
Downstairs, on the shelf above my desk,
there's a box with a watch in it.

659
00:59:41,387 --> 00:59:44,083
- See if it's still there, will you?
- What's going on?

660
00:59:44,156 --> 00:59:46,124
Just check the box, okay?

661
00:59:46,859 --> 00:59:48,292
Just a minute.

662
01:00:17,456 --> 01:00:19,890
- Are we there?
- Yeah.

663
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:36,065
You know, I usually don't like to
meet a boy's father this soon...

664
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:37,938
but for you--

665
01:00:42,915 --> 01:00:46,351
Do you think while we're there you can
tell him taking the watch was your idea?

666
01:01:05,274 --> 01:01:07,504
- Dr. Gibbs?
- Yeah.

667
01:01:07,576 --> 01:01:10,670
My name is Henry Gates.
I'm with QT Laboratories.

668
01:01:10,746 --> 01:01:13,840
I believe we have a mutual friend,
Earl Dopler.

669
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:16,544
- He tells me you're an expert on--
- Whatever this is about...

670
01:01:16,618 --> 01:01:18,950
it's gonna have to wait, 'cause I'm in
the middle of something very important.

671
01:01:19,021 --> 01:01:21,216
You certainly are.

672
01:01:45,347 --> 01:01:47,212
Dad?

673
01:01:47,282 --> 01:01:51,048
No payments for 12 months.
Don't wait.

674
01:01:56,058 --> 01:01:58,026
The fire we reported
at the old fire hall...

675
01:01:58,093 --> 01:02:00,027
- is still burning out of control.
- Front desk.

676
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:03,690
- How may I help you, Dr. Gibbs?
- Hi.

677
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:06,928
- Did I check out yet?
- Not that I know of, sir.

678
01:02:07,002 --> 01:02:09,300
Did I change rooms?

679
01:02:09,371 --> 01:02:10,702
No.

680
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,707
Dr. Gibbs,
is everything all right?

681
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:19,406
And in other news, it seemed like
a simple joyride in a stolen van...

682
01:02:19,481 --> 01:02:23,383
until the FBI linked
the teenage suspect to the theft...

683
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:25,943
of top-secret government
research by this man--

684
01:02:26,021 --> 01:02:28,615
Dr. Earl Dopler
of QT Laboratories.

685
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:30,988
That's not Dopler.
Dopler is one of my dad's students.

686
01:02:31,059 --> 01:02:33,289
- He's a hippie with long hair.
- Dr. Dopler is considered...

687
01:02:33,362 --> 01:02:35,193
armed and extremely dangerous.

688
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,493
Well, at least they didn't
mention your name.

689
01:02:37,566 --> 01:02:39,830
If you should see him
or Zak Gibbs...

690
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:43,132
please contact
your local police department--

691
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:45,002
Okay. Okay.

692
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:49,737
I'm officially freaked out now.

693
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:55,415
We can call my dad.
He knows people from the consulate.

694
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:59,215
- I know he can help.
- I'm not putting your family at risk.

695
01:02:59,287 --> 01:03:02,188
It's bad enough I got you involved.

696
01:03:02,257 --> 01:03:05,818
Hey, macho man,
I got me involved.

697
01:03:05,894 --> 01:03:09,489
But maybe I should just call them
to let them know I'm okay.

698
01:03:10,632 --> 01:03:15,194
What's this yo-yo doing?
Hey! You're blocking us in!

699
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:17,204
What's he doing?

700
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:23,670
Let me out of here!

701
01:03:23,745 --> 01:03:25,007
Help!

702
01:03:33,789 --> 01:03:35,723
Are you okay?

703
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:39,158
You know,
the first date was nice.

704
01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:41,889
This one, not so much.

705
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:54,972
What was that?

706
01:03:55,043 --> 01:03:57,511
I don't know.
Just stay cool.

707
01:04:00,582 --> 01:04:04,541
Hi. How are you?
Ready to give me that watch?

708
01:04:11,126 --> 01:04:13,492
All right, that's fine.

709
01:04:18,467 --> 01:04:21,959
You know what I don't like?
Gettin' kicked in the head!

710
01:04:24,005 --> 01:04:26,599
That is subpar.

711
01:04:26,675 --> 01:04:30,338
- I didn't know you knew karate.
- I don't. That was ballet.

712
01:04:37,185 --> 01:04:39,244
Next time, kick harder!

713
01:04:45,227 --> 01:04:47,593
Up, up, up.
All right, little dude...

714
01:04:48,396 --> 01:04:49,454
hand it over.

715
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:51,692
And don't even think
about touching that dial.

716
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:54,201
Okay, okay.
What did you do with my dad?

717
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:57,636
- I know you're a spy. It's on the news.
- That's not true.

718
01:04:57,706 --> 01:05:02,370
I love my country. Now, give me
the watch so I can go to Costa Rica.

719
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:05,572
And no funny business, okay?
Or your hottie here gets it.

720
01:05:05,647 --> 01:05:08,377
Okay, okay.
Okay, here.

721
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:12,352
First chance I get, I'm kicking you
right between the eyes.

722
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,150
That's it.
Come to Papa.

723
01:05:15,223 --> 01:05:17,521
I am so out of here.

724
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:22,862
- Dude, you got it wet.
- It's actually not--

725
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:27,759
Limber.

726
01:05:32,274 --> 01:05:33,707
Bravo.

727
01:05:35,744 --> 01:05:37,974
All right, if you're Dopler,
then prove it.

728
01:05:38,046 --> 01:05:41,015
Your mom's name is Jenny.
Your sister is Kelly.

729
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:44,210
You were born in May.
What else do you wanna know?

730
01:05:44,286 --> 01:05:46,686
This is messed up, Dopler.

731
01:05:46,755 --> 01:05:49,349
- This is really messed up.
- How do you think I feel?

732
01:05:49,424 --> 01:05:51,358
I think he's lying.
Do you want me to kick him again?

733
01:05:51,426 --> 01:05:53,257
Yeah, all right.

734
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:55,558
If the watch makes you age,
then how come we haven't gotten older?

735
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:58,394
- You weren't in hypertime long enough.
- What makes you think...

736
01:05:58,466 --> 01:06:01,060
that Gates has my dad
locked up in hypertime?

737
01:06:01,136 --> 01:06:03,001
Because they took him
to replace me.

738
01:06:03,071 --> 01:06:05,335
And there's no other way to finish
the molecular stabilizer...

739
01:06:05,407 --> 01:06:07,341
before the feds shut him down.

740
01:06:07,409 --> 01:06:11,937
Look, Zak, I'm sorry, okay?
This is freaking me out too.

741
01:06:12,013 --> 01:06:13,844
But your dad taught me
everything I know.

742
01:06:13,915 --> 01:06:17,578
I mean, your dad
is like a father to me.

743
01:06:17,652 --> 01:06:19,847
Right. Which is why you're in
such a hurry to get to Costa Rica.

744
01:06:19,921 --> 01:06:22,219
Hey, no fair.
When I sent your dad the watch...

745
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:25,259
I had no idea that Gates was gonna
bogart everything from the feds.

746
01:06:25,327 --> 01:06:28,524
There's gotta be something we can do
to get him out of there, right?

747
01:06:28,597 --> 01:06:31,327
- "We"?
- Yeah, we.

748
01:06:31,399 --> 01:06:35,699
Since you and my dad are so close,
I thought maybe you'd like to help.

749
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:37,601
Well--

750
01:06:37,672 --> 01:06:39,902
I mean, I didn't say
that we were that close.

751
01:06:39,975 --> 01:06:41,738
Oh. Okay. Fine.

752
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:45,871
Then I can drop you off at QT. I'm
sure Gates would love to have you back.

753
01:06:48,016 --> 01:06:50,211
Now, can you fix this?

754
01:06:57,259 --> 01:06:59,124
Yeah.

755
01:06:59,194 --> 01:07:03,392
But we're gonna need some stuff
you can't get at Radio Shack.

756
01:07:03,465 --> 01:07:06,457
You heard the man.
Let's go shopping.

757
01:07:21,016 --> 01:07:26,147
Hey there. Day passes for
the expo hall are $14, please.

758
01:07:26,221 --> 01:07:28,155
I don't have any money.
Do you?

759
01:07:28,223 --> 01:07:30,453
You can't ask
your hostage for money.

760
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:45,736
- Hi.
- Hello.

761
01:07:45,807 --> 01:07:47,707
- How are you?
- Good. How are you doing?

762
01:07:47,776 --> 01:07:50,210
- Actually, I need some help, okay?
- Hi.

763
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:52,678
- Let me ask you something.
- What can we do for you?

764
01:07:52,747 --> 01:07:56,148
- What is this, exactly?
- That is an airbrush gun.

765
01:07:56,217 --> 01:07:57,980
Airbrush gun. Wow.

766
01:07:58,053 --> 01:08:00,647
- You're into precision items, huh?
- Yeah.

767
01:08:00,722 --> 01:08:02,485
- Yeah?
- Cool.

768
01:08:04,259 --> 01:08:07,820
- What does this do?
- It's for airbrushing cars and walls.

769
01:08:07,896 --> 01:08:12,390
- Painting.
- Very cute. What is that over there?

770
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:14,628
That's an industrial-strength
hot-glue gun.

771
01:08:14,703 --> 01:08:17,729
- Hot-glue gun. Wow.
- It's a hot seller.

772
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:22,038
Well, Dexter,
you guys have been both so helpful.

773
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:24,172
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

774
01:08:24,305 --> 01:08:26,671
- Bye.
- See ya.

775
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,608
- Mama.
- Don't get many of those.

776
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:36,613
All right. We just need someplace
quiet to go to work for a while.

777
01:08:54,202 --> 01:08:57,000
While you're at it, can you make
that thing go any faster?

778
01:08:57,071 --> 01:09:01,872
What is it with you wacky kids today?
It's like nothing's ever fast enough.

779
01:09:01,943 --> 01:09:04,036
Oh, great.
We're out of gas.

780
01:09:04,112 --> 01:09:06,706
- I guess I'm gonna have to go get--
- I'll get it.

781
01:09:10,118 --> 01:09:11,483
Keep an eye on him?

782
01:09:33,775 --> 01:09:35,470
He's amazing, isn't he?

783
01:09:36,244 --> 01:09:37,939
Do you know him?

784
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:41,038
Yeah, I've seen him around.

785
01:09:46,354 --> 01:09:49,551
The side entrance is too obvious.
We'll never get in that way.

786
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:52,991
- I still can't believe he drew this.
- Sorry it's so rough.

787
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,789
I didn't have my protractor.

788
01:09:56,664 --> 01:09:59,997
Okay. There's gotta be
another entrance.

789
01:10:00,067 --> 01:10:03,195
Let's just step back
and look at our options.

790
01:10:03,271 --> 01:10:06,365
You're starting to sound like your dad.
"Let's step back, look at our options."

791
01:10:06,441 --> 01:10:08,636
Shut up. I'm nothing like him.

792
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:12,668
Oh, come on. I meant it as a compliment.
You don't have to blow your RAM.

793
01:10:12,747 --> 01:10:14,772
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
What's this?

794
01:10:14,849 --> 01:10:17,010
What's under here?
Is that like a sewer?

795
01:10:17,084 --> 01:10:19,985
- Ventilation, but close.
- Can we get in that way?

796
01:10:20,054 --> 01:10:23,046
Sure, if you don't mind
getting Ginsu-ed by the intake fan.

797
01:10:23,124 --> 01:10:25,524
- Give me the new watch.
- Here.

798
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:27,686
There we go.

799
01:10:27,762 --> 01:10:29,559
And--

800
01:10:31,232 --> 01:10:34,565
Now, check this out.

801
01:10:34,635 --> 01:10:36,967
All that technology...

802
01:10:37,038 --> 01:10:38,835
incognito.

803
01:10:40,608 --> 01:10:43,771
Huh?
Let me do that like that.

804
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,444
- And I'll take that. Thank you.
- Fine.

805
01:10:48,516 --> 01:10:52,714
You don't even give a dude time
to admire his work. It's unbelievable.

806
01:10:52,787 --> 01:10:54,516
What are you doing?

807
01:10:54,589 --> 01:10:56,716
I can sell that on eBay.

808
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:12,669
Zak, come in through the back door.

809
01:11:16,811 --> 01:11:18,972
I came as soon as I could
after you called.

810
01:11:22,016 --> 01:11:24,143
Come on.

811
01:11:30,124 --> 01:11:32,888
Hey, Meeker, you the man.

812
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:44,633
How's this gonna work again?

813
01:11:44,705 --> 01:11:47,674
Gates is gonna
have guards in hypertime.

814
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:51,007
We're gonna need to bring 'em
down to real time.

815
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:53,808
These babies ought to do it.

816
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:56,315
You take the paint out...

817
01:11:56,384 --> 01:11:59,251
I put the frozen nitrogen in...

818
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,822
and voilà.

819
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:06,689
N2O to go.

820
01:12:23,911 --> 01:12:27,506
Come on, come on, come on.
All right. This is it.

821
01:12:27,582 --> 01:12:30,574
Just past here are the ducts
into the building.

822
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:47,129
Let's go.

823
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:49,066
Come on, Earl.

824
01:12:53,174 --> 01:12:55,904
Here's the map.
This is as far as I go.

825
01:12:55,977 --> 01:12:59,071
- We had a deal.
- Look, man, I'm scared.

826
01:12:59,146 --> 01:13:01,580
Okay? If you went through
what I've been through...

827
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:04,140
this place would give you
the willies too.

828
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:07,310
I can't go in there, Zak man.

829
01:13:08,723 --> 01:13:11,521
- He was like a father to you, right?
- Hey, that's low.

830
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:14,220
And if you hadn't taken the watch to
begin with, he wouldn't be in there.

831
01:13:14,295 --> 01:13:17,355
What are you talking about?
You put my whole family at risk...

832
01:13:17,431 --> 01:13:19,194
when you sent him that watch.

833
01:13:19,266 --> 01:13:21,496
"Oh, I didn't know
it was a weapon, man.

834
01:13:21,569 --> 01:13:24,333
I thought it was for science,
dude-man, Zak man."

835
01:13:24,405 --> 01:13:27,738
- That's the truth.
- The truth is that man in there...

836
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:30,436
gave his life
to students like you.

837
01:13:30,511 --> 01:13:34,709
He treated you like a son. Now he needs
something and it's too much for you?

838
01:13:35,616 --> 01:13:39,052
You know what? I am his son,
and I'm going in there.

839
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:04,076
Unauthorized hypertime.

840
01:14:04,145 --> 01:14:07,410
Unauthorized hypertime.

841
01:14:07,481 --> 01:14:11,781
Hypertime security response
required on level three.

842
01:14:11,852 --> 01:14:13,410
Come on!

843
01:14:15,456 --> 01:14:17,651
Manson, check security levels
four and five.

844
01:14:17,725 --> 01:14:19,420
Anderson, check the stairs.

845
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:26,031
I can hold these guys off.
Go get your dad.

846
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,931
Security breach, level four.

847
01:14:28,002 --> 01:14:30,402
I'll see you at the fan
in five minutes.

848
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,901
Seal off all exit terminals.

849
01:14:34,975 --> 01:14:37,773
You, freeze!

850
01:15:13,114 --> 01:15:15,105
Get off that bike!

851
01:15:31,305 --> 01:15:34,900
Unauthorized hypertime,
storage level three.

852
01:15:45,652 --> 01:15:48,086
Have a nice day, Ralph Sekada.

853
01:15:48,155 --> 01:15:49,713
Thanks, Ralph.

854
01:16:07,074 --> 01:16:09,008
Hello, Zachary.

855
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:19,585
I really want to thank you
for bringing this back.

856
01:16:22,656 --> 01:16:25,682
Let's go down to real time.

857
01:16:27,528 --> 01:16:29,462
Dad?

858
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:31,088
Dad!

859
01:16:31,165 --> 01:16:33,099
He's down here.

860
01:16:39,406 --> 01:16:41,738
We're just about to find out
whether he's as brilliant...

861
01:16:41,809 --> 01:16:43,868
as everyone says that he is.

862
01:16:54,621 --> 01:16:57,089
He must be very fond of you.

863
01:16:57,157 --> 01:17:01,389
I couldn't get him to do a damn thing
until I threatened to kill you.

864
01:17:10,003 --> 01:17:13,370
Dad.
You okay?

865
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,809
- You swore you'd leave him out of this.
- Don't blame me. He's here on his own.

866
01:17:17,878 --> 01:17:20,346
Maybe you forgot
to give him his allowance.

867
01:17:28,088 --> 01:17:31,319
- You came here?
- What was I supposed to do?

868
01:17:31,391 --> 01:17:33,586
Oh, Zak, no, no.

869
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:37,118
I was only cooperating with them
so that they'd leave you alone.

870
01:17:37,197 --> 01:17:40,064
- I couldn't leave you here to die.
- So you had to come join me?

871
01:17:40,134 --> 01:17:42,398
- What?
- Oh, Zak.

872
01:17:42,469 --> 01:17:44,630
You're always saying that I only
show up when I need something.

873
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:47,003
Now I'm trying to help you,
you don't even appreciate it?

874
01:17:47,074 --> 01:17:49,565
Putting your life in the hands of
terrorists is not what I had in mind.

875
01:17:49,643 --> 01:17:51,577
What is it with you?

876
01:17:51,645 --> 01:17:54,273
It's a good thing I'm your son instead
of one of your precious students.

877
01:17:54,348 --> 01:17:56,407
- Then you'd be really disappointed.
- What are you talking about?

878
01:17:58,585 --> 01:18:00,576
Would you two just stop it?

879
01:18:00,654 --> 01:18:04,249
Sheesh.
You really are a lot alike.

880
01:18:08,962 --> 01:18:10,293
Who's your friend?

881
01:18:12,366 --> 01:18:14,596
Francesca. From school.

882
01:18:16,069 --> 01:18:17,798
No wonder you wanted a car.

883
01:18:19,306 --> 01:18:22,935
Restricted access requested
at northwest wing.

884
01:18:25,412 --> 01:18:27,277
- What is it?
- Agent Moore, sir.

885
01:18:27,347 --> 01:18:29,212
Happy Monday, Mr. Gates.

886
01:18:29,283 --> 01:18:31,217
Do you have some things for me?

887
01:18:31,285 --> 01:18:33,253
I'm sorry for the inconvenience...

888
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,254
but I'm gonna have
to ask you to come back.

889
01:18:35,322 --> 01:18:38,553
This isn't the prom, Gates.

890
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:41,150
The agency is serious about this.

891
01:18:41,228 --> 01:18:43,788
Why don't you do us both a favor
and drop the games?

892
01:18:43,864 --> 01:18:45,889
You can't come in.

893
01:18:49,036 --> 01:18:52,028
Gentlemen, start your engines.

894
01:19:02,616 --> 01:19:05,585
Yes! We're gonna get out of here.
Everything's gonna be okay.

895
01:19:05,652 --> 01:19:07,586
I wouldn't be so sure.

896
01:19:07,654 --> 01:19:09,747
Change of plans, people.

897
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,758
We're gonna test
the molecular stabilizer...

898
01:19:12,826 --> 01:19:14,760
while we're actually in hypertime.

899
01:19:17,264 --> 01:19:20,131
Warning.
Clean room hypertime engaged.

900
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,862
- What's happening?
- He's taking us all into hypertime.

901
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,652
Three minutes and counting!

902
01:19:45,626 --> 01:19:50,529
Once he's finished with that thing,
he's not gonna need us anymore.

903
01:19:50,597 --> 01:19:53,760
They're gonna kill us, aren't they?

904
01:19:53,834 --> 01:19:56,234
There's got to be
another way out of here.

905
01:19:56,303 --> 01:19:58,237
Zak, this place is sealed
tight as a drum.

906
01:19:58,305 --> 01:20:00,068
What's this?

907
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:02,438
They've been experimenting
with hydrogen.

908
01:20:02,509 --> 01:20:03,976
Hydrogen.

909
01:20:04,044 --> 01:20:07,502
They turn them on from tanks
out there in the lab.

910
01:20:07,581 --> 01:20:09,674
But-- Zak?

911
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:11,684
Zak, you're gonna blow us up.

912
01:20:11,752 --> 01:20:13,913
- Not us. Them.
- Zak.

913
01:20:25,499 --> 01:20:26,864
Zak, stop!

914
01:20:26,933 --> 01:20:29,197
Come on!
Let us out!

915
01:20:55,429 --> 01:20:59,559
I'm sorry for being
so caught up in my work.

916
01:20:59,633 --> 01:21:02,363
It was never because I care more
about my students.

917
01:21:04,104 --> 01:21:06,436
Sir, we got a problem.
We can't get in.

918
01:21:06,506 --> 01:21:09,373
The access code to the molecular
stabilizer has been changed.

919
01:21:11,178 --> 01:21:14,841
Very clever, Dr. Gibbs.

920
01:21:14,915 --> 01:21:17,748
You changed the access code.

921
01:21:17,818 --> 01:21:20,048
But I thought we had an agreement.

922
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,953
I let your son live
if you cooperate.

923
01:21:23,023 --> 01:21:25,082
Well, it's time to renegotiate.

924
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:28,719
He and the girl go free,
then you get your access code.

925
01:21:28,795 --> 01:21:31,093
Fine.

926
01:21:31,164 --> 01:21:35,100
Get those kids out of there,
then bring that old man to me.

927
01:21:35,836 --> 01:21:37,531
Zak, what are you doing?

928
01:21:37,604 --> 01:21:39,663
Finishing what I came here to do.
Come here.

929
01:21:42,576 --> 01:21:45,773
- Gates took your watch.
- Gates took a watch.

930
01:21:45,846 --> 01:21:48,906
He'd probably get $10 for it on eBay.
I switched them in the elevator.

931
01:21:57,023 --> 01:21:59,856
Zak, you can't accelerate
when you're already in hypertime.

932
01:21:59,926 --> 01:22:01,985
- It could kill you.
- We don't have a choice.

933
01:22:02,062 --> 01:22:05,088
- No, Zak!
- We don't have any choice.

934
01:22:15,075 --> 01:22:16,474
Unbelievable.

935
01:22:19,212 --> 01:22:22,545
Your molecules are moving so fast,
your hand went right through the table.

936
01:22:24,951 --> 01:22:26,612
Are you okay?

937
01:22:31,271 --> 01:22:32,795
I have no idea.

938
01:23:11,745 --> 01:23:13,178
Here we go.

939
01:23:13,246 --> 01:23:16,682
Sir, we got a problem in there.
The kid is doing something freaky.

940
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:19,617
Well, bring him down!

941
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,603
You know what to do.

942
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:53,947
Hi.

943
01:23:57,123 --> 01:23:58,613
Mr. Gates!

944
01:25:14,133 --> 01:25:15,464
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

945
01:25:18,471 --> 01:25:20,530
Zak.
Your plan worked.

946
01:25:23,509 --> 01:25:25,443
Let's get out of here.

947
01:25:33,686 --> 01:25:36,086
- Say good night, little man.
- No!

948
01:25:39,959 --> 01:25:41,426
Good night, little man.

949
01:25:46,165 --> 01:25:49,623
Yeah.
It hurts, doesn't it?

950
01:25:52,538 --> 01:25:53,800
Thank you.

951
01:26:02,048 --> 01:26:04,516
I'll take that, thank you.

952
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,979
So what do you have in mind
for our next date?

953
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:50,555
Dopler, next time you need help with
your math homework, don't call me.

954
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:53,030
Dr. G.

955
01:26:53,099 --> 01:26:56,296
Did you ever get this little
anti-aging gizmo working?

956
01:26:56,369 --> 01:26:58,701
'Cause I don't wanna
stay like this forever.

957
01:26:58,771 --> 01:27:01,706
Forget about it.
I never got a chance to test it.

958
01:27:23,796 --> 01:27:25,889
Oh, thank God you're okay.

959
01:27:29,168 --> 01:27:31,693
- What happened?
- It's okay.

960
01:27:31,771 --> 01:27:34,501
I'm just a little more
distinguished, that's all.

961
01:27:34,574 --> 01:27:36,804
Where's Zak?

962
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:38,935
He'll be here in a minute.
He had to make a stop.

963
01:27:39,012 --> 01:27:41,572
- What?
- No, no. He's just fine.

964
01:27:41,647 --> 01:27:45,583
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Oh, honey, it's so good to see you.

965
01:27:47,253 --> 01:27:49,050
There he is.

966
01:27:52,191 --> 01:27:56,855
Oh, Zak!
Oh, thank God you're okay.

967
01:27:56,929 --> 01:27:59,090
- You must be Francesca.
- Hi.

968
01:27:59,165 --> 01:28:02,862
Hey, creepy. Nice ride.
I hear you're a big hero now.

969
01:28:02,935 --> 01:28:05,460
Well, I wouldn't say hero, but--

970
01:28:05,538 --> 01:28:08,632
Look, I'm not gonna be nice
all day, so enjoy it.

971
01:28:09,442 --> 01:28:11,535
- Hey, who's that?
- Actually, honey...

972
01:28:11,611 --> 01:28:13,943
there's something I forgot
to tell you on the phone.

973
01:28:14,013 --> 01:28:15,947
We had a little problem
at the lab.

974
01:28:16,015 --> 01:28:18,950
I guess we're gonna have
some company for a while?

975
01:28:19,018 --> 01:28:21,748
Oh, hey, Mrs. G.
How's it hangin'?

976
01:28:21,821 --> 01:28:25,120
- Dopler?
- Hello, gorgeous.

977
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,452
Over. Over.

978
01:28:29,529 --> 01:28:31,053
More. More.

979
01:28:35,668 --> 01:28:38,796
Hit it. Let's see what
this thing can do. Yeah!

980
01:28:49,415 --> 01:28:51,474
Buckle up!

981
01:28:55,788 --> 01:28:57,312
Wait! Wait!
