1
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,615
Ladies and gentlemen,
American Airlines is announcing...

2
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,743
flight number 1243
to Costa Rica.

3
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,746
All passengers holding tickets
for flight 1 243...

4
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,999
may now proceed to gate 50-B..

5
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,755
Come on.
Put me in with the cargo.

6
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,966
Sir, the 10:00 to Costa Rica is booked,
but I can get you out in the morning.

7
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,054
Not if I'm dead, you can't.

8
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,598
Thankyou for nothing.

9
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,599
Hey, watch it.

10
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,652
Who does he think he is,
somebody important?.

11
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,749
- Sir, you forgot your keys.
- Keep 'em.

12
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,311
I need a vacation...

13
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,273
real bad.

14
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,579
Hey, watch it!

15
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,250
I hope you're happy.

16
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,255
Sir?.

17
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,422
I think it's time you came
back to work, Dr. Dopler.

18
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,957
Hey, Zak!

19
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,101
Let's take a look
at another example.

20
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,605
Say Amy is out for
a leisurely drive in her VW bug...

21
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,816
and along comes Eddie
in his Ferrari.

22
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,904
Hey, come on, that could happen.
Totally.

23
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,614
So, you're doing 20.

24
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,908
Eddie's doing 220.

25
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,994
-What does he look like when he goes by?.
-I don't know.Just a blur, I guess.

26
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,456
Exactly. And if he was going fast
enough, you wouldn't see him at all.

27
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,585
From Eddie's point ofview, you would
look as ifyou were standing still.

28
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,088
And that is a basic example...

29
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,841
of Einstein's theory
ofwhat, Eddie?.

30
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,717
Highway safety.

31
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,969
Relativity.

32
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,554
Relativity.

33
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,139
- Didn't do your reading assignment?.
- That's a funny story.

34
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,559
See, science is a discipline.

35
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,729
This department has trained
some of the best minds in the world.

36
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:21,400
But nobody ever gets there
by just coasting along.

37
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,695
I don't mean to sound like your father,
but I take pride in my students.

38
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,782
I want to see them succeed. That means
doing the work, being persistent and...

39
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,496
not looking for
the quick-fix, easy way out.

40
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,251
We'll finish up Einstein when I get back
from the applied science congress.

41
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,753
In the meantime,
you guys have a couple days off...

42
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,048
to prepare foryour midterm.

43
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,144
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Zak.

44
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,146
This is a rare honor.

45
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,940
Come on, I visit you at work
every now and then.

46
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,985
But careful analysis reveals
it's usually because you need something.

47
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,070
That's crazy.

48
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,199
Can you co-sign for my car?.
I got the down payment together.

49
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:14,203
There's a few cars I liked at Benson's,
and their lot stays open until 9:00.

50
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,914
Hold on a second.
Hey, Jer.

51
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,916
Where's my stipend
on the NASA consultation?.

52
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,127
- We finished that job three months ago.
- Working on it.

53
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,213
So maybe we can get there
around 7:00?.

54
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,883
Dr. Gibbs, your batch is up on the
mainframe. It's some pretty wild stuff.

55
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,594
- I'll be down in a minute.
- What are you working on?.

56
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,931
Last weekend an old student sent me
a project he's working on with QT Labs.

57
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,934
You remember Earl Dopler. One of the
best students to ever pass through here.

58
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,937
That freak who used to come over
and eat a lot of potato salad?.

59
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,939
He isn't a freak.
Eccentric, maybe.

60
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,107
Anyway, the word on this project
is very hush-hush.

61
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,109
Let's just say that,
hypothetically speaking...

62
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,112
it were possible to accelerate
your molecular structure...

63
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,407
until the rest of the world
seemed as if it were standing still.

64
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,244
- Cool.
- It's called hypertime.

65
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:59,456
Imagine being able to perform delicate
surgery between the beats of a heart.

66
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,418
This technology is going to
revolutionize medicine, science, travel.

67
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,922
Speaking of travel,
a car would be really nice.

68
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,258
So, did you download
those consumer reports?.

69
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,427
I was gonna do that
before you got home, but--

70
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:16,807
-Dad, you already blew me off last week.
-No, I was in a meeting with the dean.

71
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,226
Of course that's never
happened before, right?.

72
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:22,354
I want you to do your homework on this.
Let's see those safety reports.

73
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:26,066
- And we'll talk about it at home.
- Does that mean we can go tonight?.

74
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,527
It means we'll talk about it
when I get home.

75
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,778
Good enough.

76
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,197
Yes!

77
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,701
It's very safe
and a great father-son activity.

78
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:39,580
Dude, you made all this
just by selling junk on your computer?.

79
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:43,584
Well, one man's junk
is another man's down payment, Meeker.

80
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,587
- Start thinking outside the box, man.
- What box?.

81
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,133
The box you're in that keeps you from
seeing that this $5-an-hour job blows.

82
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,343
Dude, I ain't gonna
be here forever.

83
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,512
Check it out. Bam!

84
00:09:55,554 --> 00:10:00,142
Plur 1 02. DJ contest tomorrow night.
I'm signed up.

85
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,519
"Underground dance par-tay."

86
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,855
Yeah, that's very
"funk-fliggety" ofyou.

87
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,150
Dude, I been practicin'.
Sneaked away from the study hall.

88
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,485
Worked the turntables
in the tech room.

89
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,036
- Who is that?.
- Hey, dude, where you been?.

90
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,371
That's Francesca,
the new girl from Venezuela.

91
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,707
She goes to our school?.

92
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,751
That's gotta be good
for attendance.

93
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:31,048
Tell me about it.
She has PE when I'm in Marching Band.

94
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,884
I get smacked every time
the trombones turn to look at her.

95
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,220
- This is perfect.
- What?.

96
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,388
Foreign girl
in a foreign land, man.

97
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,641
She's all lonely and vulnerable.

98
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,644
I read about this in Cosmo.
I gotta go talk to her.

99
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,729
Oh, no, you're gonna get faced.

100
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,649
I'm not gonna get faced, man.
Come on.

101
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,567
Watch and learn.

102
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,735
Okay.

103
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,196
You're gonna get faced.

104
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,286
Excuse me.

105
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,955
Do you have the time?.

106
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,045
I mean, you go to my school,
right?.

107
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,089
I couldn't say.
What school is yours?.

108
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,593
Jefferson. My friend
watches you in PE.

109
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,137
I mean...

110
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,431
you're new, right?.

111
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:23,934
Yes.

112
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,811
Well, I'm Zak...

113
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,479
and I thought--

114
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,692
I know it can be kinda lonely
when you first move to a new town.

115
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,236
I thought maybe you needed
somebody to show you around.

116
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,614
I see.
It's so very hard for me.

117
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:41,743
I try to be brave, exploring the town
all by myself, when all I really want...

118
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:46,123
is to be giving my love to the very
first bozo who wants to know the time.

119
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,585
I read Cosmo too.

120
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,089
Right.

121
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:58,427
Okay, well, I'll see you
in school then. Okay?.

122
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,933
Hey, you did good, man.
I think she likes you.

123
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,162
Are you watching this?.

124
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,916
He was so cute, and now he's all,
"I'm a gangsta, yo."

125
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,460
Yeah, I was in earlier
about the Mustang.

126
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,504
You still have it, right?.
Cool.

127
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,507
I will be there later tonight
with the down payment.

128
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,425
Okay. Thankyou.

129
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,637
- What are you doing?.
- This way it's more like homemade.

130
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,183
I want us to have a nice dinner tonight
before your dad goes to his conference.

131
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,560
- He's taking me to buy a car tonight.
- After dinner.

132
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,562
Mom, can I have some money?.

133
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,148
Did you do your chores?.

134
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:57,236
Have I told you lately
how much I respect and admire you?.

135
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,364
Buy a car,
give money to Satan.

136
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,367
You're so lucky
you're an only child.

137
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,119
Hey, Mom says
we can go after dinner...

138
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,914
which is cool because they're open
till 9:00, so we should still make it.

139
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,124
- Make what?.
- The car lot.

140
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,253
They've got a Mustang convertible.
I'm gonna trick it out with a V-8.

141
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,381
ConsumerReports
rated it a best buy--

142
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,383
good reliability,
decent gas mileage...

143
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,386
and pretty good crash test scores
for a convertible.

144
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,055
Okay, so what else
have you compared it to?.

145
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,099
Nothing.
That's the car I want.

146
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,102
You're not gonna prove your case
by ignoring all the other data.

147
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,104
It's not a clinical trial, Dad.

148
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,107
If something's right, you gotta close
your eyes, grit your teeth and hang on.

149
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,110
No, you gotta step back, weigh the
options and make a calculated choice.

150
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,737
I want you to do
your homework on this.

151
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:44,783
If the Mustang is the caryou want when
I get back, that's the car we'll get.

152
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:48,287
It's not gonna be there when you
get back.Just come look at it tonight.

153
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,415
When I get back. I gotta
go over Dopler's project tonight.

154
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:55,127
- You haven't heard from him in a week.
- Yes, but I promised to get to it.

155
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,630
That's what this is about, isn't it?.
This isn't about looking at other cars.

156
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,632
- What are you talking about?.
- Nothing!

157
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,887
You always have time foryour students
and never foryour own kids.

158
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,722
Now he's concerned about me.

159
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,600
Hey, I asked you
to come to this conference.

160
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,644
- Who was it who said he was too busy?.
- The Congress of Applied Science?.

161
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,148
- There's fun for the whole family.
- Stop it. Sit!

162
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,942
Eat.
Kelly, get off the phone.

163
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,069
- Okay.
- Come on, you guys.

164
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,572
Some of history's greatest
peace treaties have been signed...

165
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,908
over green beans
and beef Stroganoff.

166
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,659
I'm not hungry.

167
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,496
- Zak, I promise I'll take you--
- Tell it to Dopler.

168
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,224
I don't know how you work
in all this mess.

169
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,648
Honey, I was gonna
fix that foryou.

170
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,192
I bought a new toaster
a year ago.

171
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,033
Yeah, yeah, I know.

172
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,119
I don't wanna leave with something
like this between Zak and me either.

173
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,330
It's just--

174
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:17,209
He's got so much potential
and, yeah, right now he can skate by...

175
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,378
but it's gonna catch up to him.

176
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,172
Maybe. But he's finding
his own way, George.

177
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:26,343
Just because it isn't your way
doesn't mean that he's lost.

178
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:32,015
Okay, let me put this back together
and I'll go up and make peace.

179
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,517
Okay.

180
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,687
Don't forget.
You know how you get down here.

181
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,022
No, no, I promise.
Two minutes, hon.

182
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,758
Come in.

183
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,857
- Wanna talk about anything before I go?.
- No, I'm good.

184
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,159
This is...

185
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,745
my itinerary...

186
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,832
and my hotel, in case you
need to get in touch with me.

187
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,418
Thanks.

188
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,756
Have fun
with your science friends.

189
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,351
What?.

190
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,980
We'll work it out
when I get back.

191
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,703
Mr. Gates, I don't make policy,
but I do enforce it.

192
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,914
So they're shutting me down.

193
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:22,000
Hey, you knew it was
a black ops contract.

194
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:25,337
The administration found out about it.
They want it to go away.

195
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,258
Well, you need to make them understand
the significance ofwhat we're doing.

196
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:33,178
Look, Gates, I supported you on this
as long as I could...

197
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,180
but they've got a point.

198
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,767
What if one of the Saddams of the world
gets his hands on this stuff?.

199
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,520
The fact is, he can waltz
right through an entire army...

200
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,147
plant an A-bomb
in the president's bathtub...

201
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,317
and all our smart bombs and satellites
would be useless to stop him.

202
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,528
I'm not even finished
building it...

203
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:52,114
and they have me selling it
on the black market?.

204
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,741
Mr. Gates...

205
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,786
the NSA expect your research,
your equipment...

206
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,455
the whole shooting match crated
and ready for pickup on Monday.

207
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,249
And if I'm not ready?.

208
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,044
We're taking it
whetheryou're ready or not.

209
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,561
Restricted access requested.

210
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,564
Please step forward
for retinal scan.

211
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,569
Have a nice day, Henry Gates.

212
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,280
You all ri ght?.

213
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,781
Yes. Why?.

214
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,055
- How's he doing?.
- Seems okay.

215
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,890
But he wrote that
a half hour ago.

216
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:09,900
How dramatic.

217
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,029
And charming.

218
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,948
All right.

219
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,741
Bring him down.

220
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,688
Hello, Dr. Dopler.
How are things in hypertime?.

221
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,943
"How are things in hypertime"?.

222
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,445
Look at me.
I've been in here a week.

223
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,657
- It's like I've aged 20 years.
- At least 20. Maybe more.

224
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,784
Why don't you just kill me now?.

225
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,495
I was hoping
that wouldn't be necessary.

226
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,038
Besides, it's your own fault.

227
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,833
Ifyou'd solved the aging glitch
in the original design...

228
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,586
we wouldn't have had to
bring you back to build this.

229
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:15,132
The molecular stabilizer should reverse
the aging effects in hypertime...

230
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:19,219
but I'm having a little trouble
with the program and--

231
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:22,764
Earl, the NSAwants all our toys
in three days.

232
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,933
Well, they're their toys, right?.

233
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:29,146
They don't know the watches workyet,
and I don't intend to turn them over.

234
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,815
Besides, how can I
enjoy the power of hypertime...

235
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:35,569
if every time I use it
I end up looking old?.

236
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:36,570
Like you.

237
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,198
I want this fixed in 48 hours.

238
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,743
Dude, that is impossible.

239
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,621
Well, then I guess
I will have to kill you.

240
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,250
Wait, wait, wait.

241
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,462
Maybe I could do it faster.

242
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,342
I mean, I'm still waiting
on some data from a friend.

243
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,927
A friend?.

244
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,890
Well, no, I mean--

245
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:09,645
I can trust this guy.
He's on the outside, but he's cool.

246
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,357
He's my college professor. If anybody
can crack the math on this, it's him.

247
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,068
What data did you send him?.

248
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,906
Well, actually, I--

249
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:23,408
I sent him a watch.

250
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,577
You idiot!

251
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,583
I want that watch back.

252
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,859
Mom! Zak's pants
knocked over Dad's stuff!

253
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:02,573
Dad was gonna fix this for me
so I could sell it. Figures.

254
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,575
When your father's old and gray...

255
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:07,578
you're gonna regret not having
a better relationship with him.

256
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,580
There's plenty of time for that.

257
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,463
Where are you guys going?.
I made breakfast!

258
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,895
Oh, no, that's it.
Get off the bike.

259
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,025
Hey, "Freaker," you trippin'
on some bad lunch meat?.

260
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,861
I hearyou signed up
for the spin-off tonight.

261
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,529
Ditmar, lay off.

262
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:45,157
Yo, yo, yo,
I ain't on him, all right?.

263
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,117
Listen up here, buddy.

264
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,828
Tonight it's just gonna be
me and you on stage.

265
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,831
You aren't gonna have
your little sister backing you up.

266
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:56,835
What was that?. 'Cause all I hear is
a crowd going, "Go, Meeker! Go, Meeker!'

267
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,837
This guy's hot, man!

268
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:00,797
I need to cool him off!

269
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,261
Later, jerk-wad.

270
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:07,804
Let's go.

271
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:15,062
I'm Dit-O. I'm spinning
at Underground tonight. Wanna come?.

272
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:19,316
- You won't leave me hanging tonight?.
- No, dude, I'll be there.

273
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,195
Relax.
He probably blows anyway, man.

274
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,197
I gotta go do
something about this.

275
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,992
Oh, what's the matter?.
No habla ingles?

276
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:33,664
No, it's so very hard for me.
But I try to watch and learn.

277
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,416
- Oh, I'm sure you do.
- Like this!

278
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,918
Later, jerk-wad.

279
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,004
All right, make a hole, boys.

280
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,090
Yo, I got a hole for ya.

281
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:48,929
That's a perfectly good trash can.
Don't be throwing students at it.

282
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,932
Come on, both ofyou.
You okay?.

283
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,142
Yeah, I'm okay.

284
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,436
- Move it.
- He started it!

285
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,939
I don't care who started it.
You finished it.

286
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,899
I didn't need any help.

287
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:03,026
I wasn't-- I wasn't--

288
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:06,113
I was looking for my buddy's retainer
in the garbage.

289
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,824
These band freaks
always, you know--

290
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:12,161
Right. Very nice.
Now, ifyou'll excuse me--

291
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,788
Okay, well,
since I have you here...

292
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:18,458
I'd just like to apologize
for being such a loseryesterday.

293
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,295
- Only yesterday?.
- No, every day.

294
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:25,007
Hey, I'll apologize for global warming
ifyou'll give me another chance.

295
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,342
A cup of coffee after school.
Come on.

296
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,428
I'm sorry, I have plans.

297
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,431
- Okay, how about afteryour plans?.
- I have more plans.

298
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:37,686
Would it be such a stretch
for some ofyour plans to include me?.

299
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,146
All right.

300
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,857
I guess we all deserve
a second chance.

301
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,358
Here's my address.

302
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:47,446
The only thing is, I have to
baby-sit my brother and sister...

303
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,615
but you can come by around 4:00.

304
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,783
Okay. Yeah, 4:00.

305
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:54,703
Yeah-- I mean, yeah,
that's probably okay, I think.

306
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,247
- Okay, so I'll see you then.
- Great.

307
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:34,409
I thought maybe we could spend some time
by the pool while the sun's still nice.

308
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:38,956
Yeah, works for me.
Catch some rays. Great.

309
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,958
There's another rake over there.

310
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,002
Rake?.

311
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,130
Right. Right.

312
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,091
When I said "second chance"...

313
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:53,428
I was thinking dinner and a movie
or a cup of coffee.

314
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:57,307
I told you I had plans,
and you asked if they could include you.

315
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,852
I did, didn't I?.

316
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,479
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

317
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,981
Look at it this way.

318
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,317
You go to a movie,
you can't have a conversation.

319
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,486
You go out for coffee,
there's always a lull.

320
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:12,739
This way when there's a lull,
at least my leaves get raked.

321
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,994
Yeah, well, are you gonna do
the whole thing by hand?.

322
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,455
Yeah. My father says
it develops self-discipline.

323
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,500
That's what people always say
when they want you to do stuff for free.

324
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,507
I got a better idea.

325
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:43,103
Stop that!

326
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,732
Stop! You're supposed
to be helping.

327
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,483
- Sorry.
- Silly.

328
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,694
So where did you move
after that?.

329
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:53,780
When I was 1 5,
we left Caracas to go to London.

330
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:56,742
Just when I was making friends,
we got transferred here.

331
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,827
Wow, you've lived everywhere.

332
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:03,040
My dad took us to Legoland once.
Had the Taj Mahal and the Eiffel Tower.

333
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,001
Don't feel bad.
At least you have a place to call home.

334
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:10,005
Yeah, I guess, but it must be
pretty cool being a consul's daughter.

335
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,299
That makes you, like, royalty,
doesn't it?.

336
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,801
Right. I'm waited on
hand and foot.

337
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:21,600
I would like to catch
the dog that does this.

338
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,602
I was gonna make us
iced cappuccinos.

339
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:27,064
Cappuccino?. We don't have to
paint the house or wash the car first?.

340
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,565
No!

341
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,444
Here, here, I'll do that.

342
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:35,447
I'll finish up out here
and you start on the caffeine.

343
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,241
- Really?.
- Yeah.

344
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:40,410
Great. Maybe we'll still
have time for a swim.

345
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:41,995
- Yeah?.
- What time is it?.

346
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,747
I don't know.

347
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,541
No, I do. Hold on.
It's...

348
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,293
16:57.

349
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:49,711
Whatever that is.

350
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,713
Right.
I'll be right back.

351
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:57,177
A little coffee, a little swim.

352
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:59,054
That's what I'm talking about.

353
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,021
Whoa.

354
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,286
Go! Go! Get outta here!

355
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,788
You big rat! Come on!

356
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:28,625
Seriously,
don't make me kickyour ass.

357
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,221
Whoa.

358
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,098
Hey, Francesca.

359
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,100
I think I found
your troublemaker.

360
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,604
Whateveryou guys are throwing away,
it gave this guy a heart attack.

361
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,900
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

362
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,401
Oh, boy.

363
00:28:57,154 --> 00:29:00,824
Get him out! Help!
Get him out!

364
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:15,005
I'm sorry. I am sorry.
I swear he was dead.

365
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:18,008
What is wrong with you?.
We were having such a good time.

366
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,678
- You can't work alone for two seconds!
- I was out there for a half hour!

367
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:24,723
Half an hour?.
I just walked in here.

368
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:27,059
"Hypertime exposure."
That's weird.

369
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:29,853
Maybe you should just go.

370
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,523
- We were gonna go swimming.
- Swimming?.

371
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:34,816
You want swimming?.
I'll give you swimming.

372
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,113
No way.

373
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:43,951
No...

374
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:46,495
way.

375
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,051
Wow, you have nice skin.

376
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:05,806
This is weird.

377
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:16,567
How did you do that?.

378
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,068
I have no idea.

379
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,364
Look, I don't know what you're up to,
but out you go. Come on, out.

380
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,200
Come on. Out. Let's go.

381
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:26,493
Out.

382
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:28,620
Wait, wait.
Something weird is going on.

383
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:32,332
- You and your rat, that's what's weird.
- No, I'm not trying to freakyou out.

384
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,501
I just pushed this button.

385
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,518
That's what I'm saying.

386
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:55,606
So...

387
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,317
you did this?.

388
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,404
I think it was the watch.

389
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:08,160
My dad consults on these
super-secret projects...

390
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,871
and I think
this is one of them.

391
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:13,373
So, your watch stops time?.

392
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,293
No. Look.

393
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,180
It's moving.

394
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,018
Wow.

395
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,566
Wow.

396
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,573
"QT"?.
That's where Dopler works.

397
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:49,576
This must be the thing
my dad is helping him with.

398
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,830
He said something about it
accelerating your molecules so fast...

399
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:56,166
the rest of the world
would seem like it was standing still.

400
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,837
I don't think time has stopped.
I thinkwe're just moving really fast.

401
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:08,345
He said it was theoretical. I had
no idea he'd actually built the thing.

402
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:18,522
Look at this.

403
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:36,206
- Why did I speed up and not my brother?.
- I don't know.

404
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:37,541
Let's find out.

405
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:43,547
It's about time.

406
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:51,263
Did I leave you in hypertime?.
I'm sorry.

407
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,809
I guess for this to work
we have to be touching each other.

408
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,897
Sooner or later all guys say that.
Now what?.

409
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,816
Well...

410
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,902
with such awesome power...

411
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:06,945
comes awesome responsibility.

412
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:09,364
At least that's
what my dad would say.

413
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,366
But he's not here, is he?.

414
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,972
Where do we start?.

415
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:37,392
There's that woman who's always
giving me parking tickets.

416
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:40,562
Look at her. She writes them
before the meter even expires.

417
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:43,565
She has offended
my sense of justice.

418
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:50,697
Needs something more.

419
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:52,032
Yeah.

420
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,493
Whoa, perfect.
Come on.

421
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,503
Looks like we got
our own little Picasso here.

422
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:07,506
Well, he's about to enter
his blue period.

423
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:10,968
Nice nose ring.

424
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:13,011
That's Meeker's bike
he's stealing.

425
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:20,227
Oh, I don't believe this.

426
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,731
This guy promised me that
he'd hold this car for 24 hours.

427
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:29,736
Well, it's just not right
to break a promise.

428
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,702
Shall we?.

429
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,704
Make it so, Number One.

430
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,916
- What?. We have Star Trek in Venezuela.
- Do it.

431
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:54,386
Dude, wait up!
Don't leave me like this!

432
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,888
Help!

433
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:31,590
All right?.

434
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,929
DJ Swamp!
What's the deal, DJ?.

435
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,194
Come on!

436
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:02,204
All right?.

437
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,999
The people have decided, baby!

438
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,670
DJ Swamp is the winner
of this round!

439
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:16,802
Let's keep this thing goin'!

440
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:21,014
Let's get to our next two DJs!

441
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,017
First up, we got DJ Dit-O!

442
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:29,523
Boo!

443
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:35,529
We also got DJ Meeker!

444
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:39,575
- Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
- Where is he?.

445
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:50,919
All right, Dit-O, it's your time
to shine, baby! Let's do this!

446
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,700
Yeah!

447
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:24,411
What's up, Meek?.
Are you ready?.

448
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:37,466
You suck!

449
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:42,930
That's weak!

450
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,891
He really is not
very smooth, is he?.

451
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:30,519
No way!

452
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:41,155
I can't take this anymore.

453
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:54,543
He needs so much help.
Here, stand him up first.

454
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:56,378
Okay.
What are we doing?.

455
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,797
A little dance lesson.

456
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:01,633
First off, let's give him
a little attitude.

457
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:06,054
Get one arm
while I grab the other and pull him.

458
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:43,217
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

459
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,438
This is wrong.
This is absolutely wrong.

460
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:57,940
No, it's Swan Lake.

461
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,612
Go, Meeker! Go, Meeker!
Go, Meeker!

462
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:48,740
- How's your head?.
- I thought I was gonna wet my pants!

463
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,161
- How's your head?.
- I thought I was gonna wet my pants!

464
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,956
This hypertime thing
is so trippy.

465
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:59,501
I knew it wasn't me doing the moving,
but I couldn't feel you guys moving me.

466
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:02,296
Actually, I thinkyour boy Dit-O
did wet his pants.

467
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:06,091
Zak, your watch is off the hook!

468
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:07,926
What we gonna do next?.

469
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,096
Hey, let's dress Coach Wells up
like Britney Spears.

470
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,015
Oh, man!

471
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:14,516
Why not?.

472
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,978
- Didn't you say you have to get home?.
- Hey, forget that. Forget that!

473
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,147
Leslie Miller
has a slumber party tonight.

474
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:24,276
You know she got that pool,
and the girls get naked.

475
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:27,821
Or we could go to Vegas!

476
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:29,364
Go to Vegas!

477
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:33,202
Genius, hey!
We're not going anywhere.

478
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:37,206
My dad finds out I took the watch,
I'm gonna be grounded forever.

479
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:38,540
So--

480
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:40,501
Man!

481
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,294
It's right up here.

482
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,303
You gotta be kidding me.

483
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:56,016
Oh, all right, fine.

484
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:58,018
I can take a hint.

485
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:05,275
You sure you don't want me
to come with you?. I got this plan--

486
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:08,862
Okay, man!

487
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:11,073
See you Monday, Meeker.

488
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:13,075
- Good night.
- Yeah, okay.

489
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,369
Y'all have fun makin' out.

490
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,329
Watch this.

491
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,750
Oh, yeah, that's funny, Zak.
That's real funny.

492
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:25,212
You're abusing your powers!
I'm gonna call the Super Friends on you!

493
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:28,757
Oh, it's on now!
I'm gonna get you for this!

494
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:41,311
- So--
- So--

495
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:45,816
That didn't turn out so bad after all,
Mr. Second Chance Man.

496
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:47,818
Yeah, well, the way I figure it...

497
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,114
ifyou make a bad first impression,
things can only get better from there.

498
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:55,492
Right, and you take the prize
on both counts.

499
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:02,374
I'd better go.

500
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,042
- Now?.
- Yeah?.

501
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,967
At midnight
my father blinks the porch light...

502
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,219
and I turn back into a pumpkin.

503
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,014
Yeah, I should probably go too.

504
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:19,808
Although midnight
could be a pretty long time off.

505
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:23,395
Stop that. What, do you think that
magic watch is gonna get you a kiss?.

506
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:28,192
I just wanted to spend
more time with you.

507
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,693
You don't need magic.

508
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,000
What?.

509
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,669
I wanted to kiss you.

510
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:50,297
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Second Chance Man.

511
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,341
I had fun.

512
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,993
Shut up! Shut up!

513
00:46:26,078 --> 00:46:28,705
Who are you?.
What do you people want?.

514
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:31,542
- Duh! They want to kill you, man.
- Why?. What did I do?.

515
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:35,921
Because you showed up, and you've got
something that's not supposed to exist.

516
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:40,425
Now grab those wires under the dash.
Go, go, go, go!

517
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,719
Okay, now bite the green one.

518
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:48,308
Okay, that's not it.

519
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:53,188
Okay, strip the red wire with your teeth
and touch it to the steering column.

520
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:56,191
Come on! Hurry up, man!
Just bite it!

521
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:59,069
Okay, go.

522
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,031
Hurry, man, they're coming!
Go!

523
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:06,243
Come on! You're gonna
have to drive! Go, go, go!

524
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:09,037
- He's in the van!
- Come on!

525
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:32,853
Whoa, man!
You are gonna get us killed.

526
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:35,814
- This is not as easy as it looks.
- Yeah, I know, but--

527
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:37,399
Whoa!

528
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:45,115
- Who are those guys?.
- You don't want to know.

529
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:53,165
- What were they shooting at me?.
- Liquid nitrogen.

530
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:55,417
It's a quick and dirty comedown
from hypertime.

531
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:58,337
The cold slows
your molecular activity.

532
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:08,472
Probably faster
to gnaw off my hand.

533
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:11,141
So, is it me or are they
trying to kill you too?.

534
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:13,977
Yeah, they're probably up
for a two-fer at this point.

535
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:21,318
Hang on!

536
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:31,870
All right.

537
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:36,375
Whoa.

538
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,378
- Give me the watch.
- No!

539
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:42,130
- Give me the watch!
- Or what?. You'll adjust me to death?.

540
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:45,425
"Adjust me to death."
That's great.

541
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:47,302
Give me the watch!

542
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:51,557
- You crazy lunatic!
- "Crazy lunatic"?. That's redundant.

543
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,619
Give me that! Come on!

544
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:27,361
Hey, dude!

545
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,988
Whateveryou do,
don't get it wet!

546
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:43,836
So strange.

547
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:46,338
Seems fine...

548
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:50,801
although his vitals are elevated.

549
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:54,304
Oh, here he comes.

550
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:57,224
How you doing, Sleeping Beauty?.
You okay?. You all right?.

551
00:50:57,307 --> 00:51:00,060
- Where'd you get the van, kid?.
- Not now. Let him breathe.

552
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:03,564
- Mom.
- Zak! Is he okay?.

553
00:51:03,647 --> 00:51:06,066
He'll be fine.
It was just a mild concussion.

554
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,360
- How you feeling?.
- Okay, I think.

555
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:11,029
- Good. So you can stand trial.
- What?.

556
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:14,366
Hello! You stole a van
and crashed it.

557
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:17,619
Can I have his room
while he's in jail?. Please?.

558
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:22,416
- You almost got killed on that joyride.
- Honey, you had us so worried.

559
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:26,795
I don't know what got into him.
He's a good kid. Really.

560
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:28,255
Cool!

561
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:31,341
This doesn't have to go
on his record, does it?.

562
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:33,010
No, you don't understand.

563
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:36,430
I was in hypertime with these guys,
and they were after my watch.

564
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:40,475
It's a molecular accelerator.
Here.

565
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,440
Oh, man. It's broken.

566
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,275
- They're gonna kill me.
- Who?.

567
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:51,403
- These guys! They were in our house.
- What?.

568
00:51:51,487 --> 00:51:53,405
You couldn't see 'em.
They were invisible.

569
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:56,200
- Oh, yeah, right.
- Here you go, sir.

570
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,785
I said creamer, you twit.

571
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:01,038
- Is he gonna be okay?.
- I can't stay here.

572
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:02,080
Nurse. Thankyou.

573
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:05,000
Oh, crap.

574
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:08,045
Come here.

575
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:12,216
- Oh, he's so faking it.
- Yeah. Yeah. I am faking it.

576
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:14,218
I'm sorry I stole the van.

577
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:17,804
I would love to tell you all about it,
but first I have to pee.

578
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:30,192
Come on, come on.

579
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:32,361
What are you doing?.

580
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:36,740
I can't go
unless there's some noise.

581
00:52:41,078 --> 00:52:43,121
Come on.

582
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:49,044
- Get some coffee.
- Let's go!

583
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:38,468
I don't want to hear
any excuses.

584
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:42,097
Just get back here.

585
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:45,851
I've got something I want delivered
to our contact at the FBI.

586
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:50,564
A little publicity should help
flush out Dopler and the kid.

587
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:53,358
Because we can't kill
what we can't find.

588
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:56,570
But without Dopler, how do you
finish the molecular stabilizer?.

589
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,572
Who needs the student...

590
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:03,118
when the teacher
is so close at hand?.

591
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:13,253
Hot Skates.
Junior Associate Meeker speaking.

592
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:15,923
I need to borrowyour mom's car.

593
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:21,053
What's going on?.
The cops are looking for you.

594
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:23,555
Just turn around slowly.
B.e cool.

595
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:25,807
You don't want to be seen
with me right now.

596
00:54:27,643 --> 00:54:30,729
Okay, go home and get the keys
to your mom's Subaru.

597
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:33,732
What?. Are you crazy?.

598
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:37,444
Somebody is trying to kill me over this
watch, and it doesn't even work now.

599
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:41,156
Okay, dude, but you don't need a Subaru.
What you need is the police.

600
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:46,620
I just came from the police. Look at me.
They weren't as helpful as you'd think.

601
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:50,791
I need to go to Kingston to find my dad.
He might know who these people are.

602
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,918
Dude, that's a six-hour drive, man.

603
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:56,755
I gotta go.

604
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:01,176
Budget cuts.

605
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:35,627
Okay, Mr. Invisible,
where are you?.

606
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:39,298
That's nice.

607
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:45,012
What are you doing in there?.
Did you break into my house just to pee?.

608
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:47,681
No, actually...

609
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:50,184
to use the phone too.

610
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:52,186
What are you wearing?.

611
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:54,188
I know this sounds weird...

612
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:57,733
and it's the last thing you want to
hear from a guy after one date, but...

613
00:55:57,816 --> 00:56:02,404
the cops are looking for me everywhere
and I've got no place else to go.

614
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:06,325
I need to borrow some clothes and money
for a bus. I promise I'll pay you back.

615
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:08,327
- Okay?.
- You are freaking me out.

616
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:11,079
- What is going on?.
- It's a long story.

617
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:13,081
The less you know, the better.

618
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:19,254
Things with the watch
have gotten really twisted.

619
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:22,508
I gotta get to Kingston and find my dad,
because they could be after him too.

620
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:25,177
Who is after who?.
What is happening?.

621
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:27,471
I don't know who they are.

622
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:32,267
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come here.

623
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:34,228
Wait. Slow down.

624
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:36,730
Come over here and just relax.

625
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:40,692
I'm glad that you came.
I am.

626
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:45,697
But ifwe're gonna be friends,
you have to tell me what is happening.

627
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,092
I told my brother I was getting
the car washed, so bring it back clean.

628
00:57:05,843 --> 00:57:07,261
Okay.

629
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,474
I can't thankyou enough.

630
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:15,936
- Call me when you find him?.
- Yeah.

631
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:52,181
What are you doing?.

632
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:55,934
You raked my leaves.
I can't let you go alone.

633
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:10,657
He's been calling all day.

634
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:13,660
This is the first chance I've had
to check my messages.

635
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:16,163
George, listen, calm down.

636
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:19,374
The police want you to stay there
in case Zak calls again.

637
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,627
If he shows up here
I'll let you know.

638
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,296
If he's giving you any trouble,
I can talk to him.

639
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:26,465
Fine.

640
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:28,842
I just feel helpless,
sitting here waiting.

641
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:30,177
Welcome to the club!

642
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:32,804
I'm sorry.

643
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:34,389
I didn't mean it like that.

644
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:37,518
I've been everywhere trying to track
him down, and we couldn't reach you.

645
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:40,395
All right,
let's go overyour list.

646
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:48,237
Hi. I need the room number
for Dr. George Gibbs.

647
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,239
He's here with the convention.

648
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:51,740
And you are?.

649
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:55,577
In a hurry.

650
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:09,842
Yeah.

651
00:59:12,678 --> 00:59:14,596
Let me see what I can do.

652
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:21,395
I never should have left
with something like this between us.

653
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:24,439
- Did he try to explain his behavior?.
- Not really.

654
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:28,193
I mean, he rambled on a bit
when he came to, but--

655
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:29,862
Oh, wait.

656
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:33,866
He said something about his watch being
a molecular accelerator or something.

657
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:35,617
Molecular accelerator?.

658
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:41,290
Downstairs, on the shelf above my desk,
there's a box with a watch in it.

659
00:59:41,373 --> 00:59:44,042
- See if it's still there, will you?.
- What's going on?.

660
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:46,086
Just check the box, okay?.

661
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:47,855
Just a minute.

662
01:00:17,051 --> 01:00:19,470
- Are we there?.
- Yeah.

663
01:00:31,065 --> 01:00:35,653
You know, I usually don't like to
meet a boy's father this soon...

664
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:37,530
but for you--

665
01:00:42,493 --> 01:00:45,913
Do you think while we're there you can
tell him taking the watch was your idea?.

666
01:01:04,849 --> 01:01:07,101
- Dr. Gibbs?.
- Yeah.

667
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:10,229
My name is Henry Gates.
I'm with QT Laboratories.

668
01:01:10,312 --> 01:01:13,399
I believe we have a mutual friend,
Earl Dopler.

669
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:16,110
- He tells me you're an expert on--
- Whatever this is about...

670
01:01:16,193 --> 01:01:18,529
it's gonna have to wait, 'cause I'm in
the middle of something very important.

671
01:01:18,612 --> 01:01:20,781
You certainly are.

672
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,807
Dad?.

673
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:50,644
No payments for 12 months.
Don't wait.

674
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:57,610
The fire we reported
at the old fire hall...

675
01:01:57,651 --> 01:01:59,612
- is still burning out of control.
- Front desk.

676
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:03,282
- How may I help you, Dr. Gibbs?.
- Hi.

677
01:02:03,324 --> 01:02:06,494
- Did I check out yet?.
- Not that I know of, sir.

678
01:02:06,577 --> 01:02:08,871
Did I change rooms?.

679
01:02:08,954 --> 01:02:10,289
No.

680
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:14,293
Dr. Gibbs,
is everything all right?.

681
01:02:15,336 --> 01:02:18,964
And in othernews, it seemed like
a simplejoyride in a stolen van...

682
01:02:19,048 --> 01:02:22,968
until the FB.I linked
the teenage suspect to the theft...

683
01:02:23,052 --> 01:02:25,513
oftop-secret government
research by this man--

684
01:02:25,596 --> 01:02:28,182
Dr. Earl Dopler
of QT Laboratories.

685
01:02:28,265 --> 01:02:30,559
That's not Dopler.
Dopler is one of my dad's students.

686
01:02:30,643 --> 01:02:32,853
- He's a hippie with long hair.
- Dr. Dopler is considered...

687
01:02:32,937 --> 01:02:34,772
armed and extremely dangerous.

688
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:37,066
Well, at least they didn't
mention your name.

689
01:02:37,149 --> 01:02:39,401
Ifyou should see him
or Zak Gibbs...

690
01:02:39,485 --> 01:02:42,696
please contact
your local police department--

691
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,573
Okay. Okay.

692
01:02:47,118 --> 01:02:49,328
I'm officially freaked out now.

693
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,000
We can call my dad.
He knows people from the consulate.

694
01:02:55,084 --> 01:02:58,796
- I know he can help.
- I'm not putting your family at risk.

695
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:01,757
It's bad enough I got you involved.

696
01:03:01,841 --> 01:03:05,386
Hey, macho man,
I got me involved.

697
01:03:05,469 --> 01:03:09,056
But maybe I should just call them
to let them know I'm okay.

698
01:03:10,224 --> 01:03:14,770
What's this yo-yo doing?.
Hey! You're blocking us in!

699
01:03:14,854 --> 01:03:16,772
What's he doing?.

700
01:03:20,651 --> 01:03:23,237
Let me out of here!

701
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,572
Help!

702
01:03:33,372 --> 01:03:35,291
Are you okay?.

703
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:38,753
You know,
the first date was nice.

704
01:03:38,794 --> 01:03:41,464
This one, not so much.

705
01:03:52,725 --> 01:03:54,560
What was that?.

706
01:03:54,602 --> 01:03:57,104
I don't know.
Just stay cool.

707
01:04:00,149 --> 01:04:04,111
Hi. How are you?.
Ready to give me that watch?.

708
01:04:10,701 --> 01:04:13,079
All right, that's fine.

709
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:21,545
You know what I don't like?.
Gettin' kicked in the head!

710
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:26,175
That is subpar.

711
01:04:26,258 --> 01:04:29,929
- I didn't know you knew karate.
- I don't. That was ballet.

712
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:38,813
Next time, kick harder!

713
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:47,154
Up, up, up.
All right, little dude...

714
01:04:47,988 --> 01:04:49,031
hand it over.

715
01:04:49,115 --> 01:04:51,283
And don't even think
about touching that dial.

716
01:04:51,367 --> 01:04:53,786
Okay, okay.
What did you do with my dad?.

717
01:04:53,828 --> 01:04:57,206
- I know you're a spy. It's on the news.
- That's not true.

718
01:04:57,289 --> 01:05:01,961
I love my country. Now, give me
the watch so I can go to Costa Rica.

719
01:05:02,002 --> 01:05:05,131
And no funny business, okay?.
Or your hottie here gets it.

720
01:05:05,214 --> 01:05:07,967
Okay, okay.
Okay, here.

721
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:11,929
First chance I get, I'm kicking you
right between the eyes.

722
01:05:12,012 --> 01:05:14,723
That's it.
Come to Papa.

723
01:05:14,807 --> 01:05:17,101
I am so out of here.

724
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,440
- Dude, you got it wet.
- It's actually not--

725
01:05:25,776 --> 01:05:27,319
Limber.

726
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:33,284
Bravo.

727
01:05:35,327 --> 01:05:37,538
All right, ifyou're Dopler,
then prove it.

728
01:05:37,621 --> 01:05:40,583
Your mom's name is Jenny.
Your sister is Kelly.

729
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:43,794
You were born in May.
What else do you wanna know?.

730
01:05:43,878 --> 01:05:46,255
This is messed up, Dopler.

731
01:05:46,338 --> 01:05:48,924
- This is really messed up.
- How do you think I feel?.

732
01:05:49,008 --> 01:05:50,926
I think he's lying.
Do you want me to kick him again?.

733
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,845
Yeah, all right.

734
01:05:52,887 --> 01:05:55,139
If the watch makes you age,
then how come we haven't gotten older?.

735
01:05:55,222 --> 01:05:57,975
- You weren't in hypertime long enough.
- What makes you think...

736
01:05:58,058 --> 01:06:00,644
that Gates has my dad
locked up in hypertime?.

737
01:06:00,728 --> 01:06:02,563
Because they took him
to replace me.

738
01:06:02,646 --> 01:06:04,899
And there's no other way to finish
the molecular stabilizer...

739
01:06:04,982 --> 01:06:06,901
before the feds shut him down.

740
01:06:06,984 --> 01:06:11,530
Look, Zak, I'm sorry, okay?.
This is freaking me out too.

741
01:06:11,572 --> 01:06:13,407
But your dad taught me
everything I know.

742
01:06:13,491 --> 01:06:17,161
I mean, your dad
is like a father to me.

743
01:06:17,244 --> 01:06:19,413
Right. Which is why you're in
such a hurry to get to Costa Rica.

744
01:06:19,497 --> 01:06:21,791
Hey, no fair.
When I sent your dad the watch...

745
01:06:21,874 --> 01:06:24,835
I had no idea that Gates was gonna
bogart everything from the feds.

746
01:06:24,919 --> 01:06:28,089
There's gotta be something we can do
to get him out of there, right?.

747
01:06:28,172 --> 01:06:30,925
- "We"?.
- Yeah, we.

748
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:35,262
Since you and my dad are so close,
I thought maybe you'd like to help.

749
01:06:35,346 --> 01:06:37,181
Well--

750
01:06:37,264 --> 01:06:39,475
I mean, I didn't say
that we were that close.

751
01:06:39,558 --> 01:06:41,310
Oh. Okay. Fine.

752
01:06:41,393 --> 01:06:45,439
Then I can drop you off at QT. I'm
sure Gates would love to have you back.

753
01:06:47,608 --> 01:06:49,777
Now, can you fix this?.

754
01:06:56,826 --> 01:06:58,702
Yeah.

755
01:06:58,786 --> 01:07:02,957
But we're gonna need some stuff
you can't get at Radio Shack.

756
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,043
You heard the man.
Let's go shopping.

757
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:25,729
Hey there. Day passes for
the expo hall are $1 4, please.

758
01:07:25,813 --> 01:07:27,731
I don't have any money.
Do you?.

759
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:30,025
You can't ask
your hostage for money.

760
01:07:43,998 --> 01:07:45,332
- Hi.
- Hello.

761
01:07:45,374 --> 01:07:47,293
- How are you?.
- Good. How are you doing?.

762
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:49,795
- Actually, I need some help, okay?.
- Hi.

763
01:07:49,837 --> 01:07:52,256
- Let me askyou something.
- What can we do foryou?.

764
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:55,718
- What is this, exactly?.
- That is an airbrush gun.

765
01:07:55,801 --> 01:07:57,553
Airbrush gun. Wow.

766
01:07:57,636 --> 01:08:00,222
- You're into precision items, huh?.
- Yeah.

767
01:08:00,306 --> 01:08:02,057
- Yeah?.
- Cool.

768
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:07,396
- What does this do?.
- It's for airbrushing cars and walls.

769
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,984
- Painting.
- Very cute. What is that over there?.

770
01:08:12,026 --> 01:08:14,195
That's an industrial-strength
hot-glue gun.

771
01:08:14,278 --> 01:08:17,323
- Hot-glue gun. Wow.
- It's a hot seller.

772
01:08:17,364 --> 01:08:21,619
Well, Dexter,
you guys have been both so helpful.

773
01:08:21,702 --> 01:08:23,746
- Thankyou very much.
- Thankyou.

774
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:26,248
- Bye.
- See ya.

775
01:08:27,374 --> 01:08:30,169
- Mama.
- Don't get many of those.

776
01:08:32,421 --> 01:08:36,175
All right. We just need someplace
quiet to go to work for a while.

777
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:56,570
While you're at it, can you make
that thing go any faster?.

778
01:08:56,654 --> 01:09:01,450
What is it with you wacky kids today?.
It's like nothing's ever fast enough.

779
01:09:01,534 --> 01:09:03,619
Oh, great.
We're out of gas.

780
01:09:03,702 --> 01:09:06,288
- I guess I'm gonna have to go get--
- I'll get it.

781
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:11,043
Keep an eye on him?.

782
01:09:33,357 --> 01:09:35,067
He's amazing, isn't he?.

783
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:37,528
Do you know him?.

784
01:09:38,612 --> 01:09:40,614
Yeah, I've seen him around.

785
01:09:45,953 --> 01:09:49,123
The side entrance is too obvious.
We'll never get in that way.

786
01:09:49,206 --> 01:09:52,585
- I still can't believe he drew this.
- Sorry it's so rough.

787
01:09:52,626 --> 01:09:54,378
I didn't have my protractor.

788
01:09:56,255 --> 01:09:59,592
Okay. There's gotta be
another entrance.

789
01:09:59,633 --> 01:10:02,762
Let's just step back
and look at our options.

790
01:10:02,845 --> 01:10:05,931
You're starting to sound like your dad.
"Let's step back, look at our options."

791
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:08,225
Shut up. I'm nothing like him.

792
01:10:08,309 --> 01:10:12,229
Oh, come on. I meant it as a compliment.
You don't have to blow your RAM.

793
01:10:12,313 --> 01:10:14,356
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
What's this?.

794
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,609
What's under here?.
Is that like a sewer?.

795
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,570
- Ventilation, but close.
- Can we get in that way?.

796
01:10:19,653 --> 01:10:22,615
Sure, ifyou don't mind
getting Ginsu-ed by the intake fan.

797
01:10:22,698 --> 01:10:25,117
- Give me the new watch.
- Here.

798
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:27,244
There we go.

799
01:10:27,328 --> 01:10:29,121
And--

800
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:34,126
Now, check this out.

801
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,545
All that technology...

802
01:10:36,629 --> 01:10:38,422
incognito.

803
01:10:40,174 --> 01:10:43,344
Huh?.
Let me do that like that.

804
01:10:45,262 --> 01:10:48,015
- And I'll take that. Thankyou.
- Fine.

805
01:10:48,099 --> 01:10:52,311
You don't even give a dude time
to admire his work. It's unbelievable.

806
01:10:52,353 --> 01:10:54,105
What are you doing?.

807
01:10:54,188 --> 01:10:56,315
I can sell that on eBay.

808
01:11:08,953 --> 01:11:12,248
Zak, come in through the back door.

809
01:11:16,377 --> 01:11:18,546
I came as soon as I could
after you called.

810
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:23,717
Come on.

811
01:11:29,723 --> 01:11:32,476
Hey, Meeker, you the man.

812
01:11:42,445 --> 01:11:44,196
How's this gonna work again?.

813
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,241
Gates is gonna
have guards in hypertime.

814
01:11:47,324 --> 01:11:50,578
We're gonna need to bring 'em
down to real time.

815
01:11:50,661 --> 01:11:53,372
These babies ought to do it.

816
01:11:53,456 --> 01:11:55,875
You take the paint out...

817
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:58,836
I put the frozen nitrogen in...

818
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:04,383
and voila.

819
01:12:04,467 --> 01:12:06,260
N2O to go.

820
01:12:23,486 --> 01:12:27,073
Come on, come on, come on.
All right. This is it.

821
01:12:27,156 --> 01:12:30,159
Just past here are the ducts
into the building.

822
01:12:44,465 --> 01:12:46,717
Let's go.

823
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:48,636
Come on, Earl.

824
01:12:52,765 --> 01:12:55,476
Here's the map.
This is as far as I go.

825
01:12:55,559 --> 01:12:58,646
- We had a deal.
- Look, man, I'm scared.

826
01:12:58,729 --> 01:13:01,148
Okay?. Ifyou went through
what I've been through...

827
01:13:01,232 --> 01:13:03,734
this place would give you
the willies too.

828
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:06,904
I can't go in there, Zak man.

829
01:13:08,322 --> 01:13:11,117
- He was like a father to you, right?.
- Hey, that's low.

830
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:13,786
And ifyou hadn't taken the watch to
begin with, he wouldn't be in there.

831
01:13:13,869 --> 01:13:16,914
What are you talking about?.
You put my whole family at risk...

832
01:13:16,997 --> 01:13:18,791
when you sent him that watch.

833
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:21,085
"Oh, I didn't know
it was a weapon, man.

834
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:23,921
I thought it was for science,
dude-man, Zak man."

835
01:13:24,004 --> 01:13:27,299
- That's the truth.
- The truth is that man in there...

836
01:13:27,383 --> 01:13:30,010
gave his life
to students like you.

837
01:13:30,094 --> 01:13:34,306
He treated you like a son. Now he needs
something and it's too much foryou?.

838
01:13:35,182 --> 01:13:38,644
You know what?. I am his son,
and I'm going in there.

839
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:03,669
Unauthorized hypertime.

840
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:07,006
Unauthorized hypertime.

841
01:14:07,047 --> 01:14:11,343
Hypertime security response
required on level three.

842
01:14:11,427 --> 01:14:12,970
Come on!

843
01:14:15,055 --> 01:14:17,224
Manson, check security levels
four and five.

844
01:14:17,308 --> 01:14:19,018
Anderson, check the stairs.

845
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:25,608
I can hold these guys off.
Go get your dad.

846
01:14:25,691 --> 01:14:27,526
Security breach, level four.

847
01:14:27,568 --> 01:14:29,987
I'll see you at the fan
in five minutes.

848
01:14:31,822 --> 01:14:34,492
Seal offall exit terminals.

849
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:37,369
You, freeze!

850
01:15:12,696 --> 01:15:14,698
Get off that bike!

851
01:15:30,881 --> 01:15:34,468
Unauthorized hypertime,
storage level three.

852
01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:47,648
Have a nice day, Ralph Sekada.

853
01:15:47,731 --> 01:15:49,275
Thanks, Ralph.

854
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,586
Hello, Zachary.

855
01:16:16,218 --> 01:16:19,180
I really want to thank you
for bringing this back.

856
01:16:22,224 --> 01:16:25,269
Let's go down to real time.

857
01:16:27,104 --> 01:16:29,023
Dad?.

858
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:30,649
Dad!

859
01:16:30,733 --> 01:16:32,693
He's down here.

860
01:16:38,991 --> 01:16:41,327
We're just about to find out
whether he's as brilliant...

861
01:16:41,368 --> 01:16:43,454
as everyone says that he is.

862
01:16:54,215 --> 01:16:56,675
He must be very fond ofyou.

863
01:16:56,717 --> 01:17:00,971
I couldn't get him to do a damn thing
until I threatened to kill you.

864
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:12,942
Dad.
You okay?.

865
01:17:13,025 --> 01:17:17,405
- You swore you'd leave him out of this.
- Don't blame me. He's here on his own.

866
01:17:17,446 --> 01:17:19,907
Maybe you forgot
to give him his allowance.

867
01:17:27,665 --> 01:17:30,918
- You came here?.
- What was I supposed to do?.

868
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,170
Oh, Zak, no, no.

869
01:17:33,254 --> 01:17:36,715
I was only cooperating with them
so that they'd leave you alone.

870
01:17:36,757 --> 01:17:39,635
- I couldn't leave you here to die.
- So you had to come join me?.

871
01:17:39,718 --> 01:17:41,971
- What?.
- Oh, Zak.

872
01:17:42,054 --> 01:17:44,223
You're always saying that I only
show up when I need something.

873
01:17:44,265 --> 01:17:46,600
Now I'm trying to help you,
you don't even appreciate it?.

874
01:17:46,642 --> 01:17:49,145
Putting your life in the hands of
terrorists is not what I had in mind.

875
01:17:49,228 --> 01:17:51,147
What is it with you?.

876
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:53,858
It's a good thing I'm your son instead
of one ofyour precious students.

877
01:17:53,941 --> 01:17:55,985
- Then you'd be really disappointed.
- What are you talking about?.

878
01:17:58,154 --> 01:18:00,156
Would you two just stop it?.

879
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:03,826
Sheesh.
You really are a lot alike.

880
01:18:08,539 --> 01:18:09,874
Who's your friend?.

881
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:14,170
Francesca. From school.

882
01:18:15,629 --> 01:18:17,381
No wonderyou wanted a car.

883
01:18:18,883 --> 01:18:22,511
Restricted access requested
at northwest wing.

884
01:18:24,972 --> 01:18:26,849
- What is it?.
- Agent Moore, sir.

885
01:18:26,932 --> 01:18:28,809
Happy Monday, Mr. Gates.

886
01:18:28,851 --> 01:18:30,811
Do you have some things for me?

887
01:18:30,853 --> 01:18:32,813
I'm sorry for the inconvenience...

888
01:18:32,897 --> 01:18:34,815
but I'm gonna have
to ask you to come back.

889
01:18:34,899 --> 01:18:38,152
This isn't the prom, Gates.

890
01:18:38,194 --> 01:18:40,738
The agency is serious about this.

891
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:43,365
Why don't you do us both a favor
and drop the games?.

892
01:18:43,449 --> 01:18:45,451
You can't come in.

893
01:18:48,621 --> 01:18:51,624
Gentlemen, start your engines.

894
01:19:02,176 --> 01:19:05,179
Yes! We're gonna get out of here.
Everything's gonna be okay.

895
01:19:05,221 --> 01:19:07,181
I wouldn't be so sure.

896
01:19:07,223 --> 01:19:09,308
Change of plans, people.

897
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:12,353
We're gonna test
the molecular stabilizer...

898
01:19:12,394 --> 01:19:14,355
while we're actually in hypertime.

899
01:19:16,857 --> 01:19:19,693
Warning.
Clean room hypertime engaged.

900
01:19:19,777 --> 01:19:22,446
- What's happening?.
- He's taking us all into hypertime.

901
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,216
Three minutes and counting!

902
01:19:45,219 --> 01:19:50,099
Once he's finished with that thing,
he's not gonna need us anymore.

903
01:19:50,182 --> 01:19:53,352
They're gonna kill us, aren't they?.

904
01:19:53,394 --> 01:19:55,813
There's got to be
another way out of here.

905
01:19:55,896 --> 01:19:57,815
Zak, this place is sealed
tight as a drum.

906
01:19:57,898 --> 01:19:59,650
What's this?.

907
01:19:59,734 --> 01:20:02,027
They've been experimenting
with hydrogen.

908
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:03,571
Hydrogen.

909
01:20:03,612 --> 01:20:07,074
They turn them on from tanks
out there in the lab.

910
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:09,243
But-- Zak?.

911
01:20:09,326 --> 01:20:11,245
Zak, you're gonna blow us up.

912
01:20:11,328 --> 01:20:13,497
- Not us. Them.
- Zak.

913
01:20:25,092 --> 01:20:26,427
Zak, stop!

914
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:28,763
Come on!
Let us out!

915
01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:59,126
I'm sorry for being
so caught up in my work.

916
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:01,962
It was never because I care more
about my students.

917
01:21:03,672 --> 01:21:06,008
Sir, we got a problem.
We can't get in.

918
01:21:06,092 --> 01:21:08,969
The access code to the molecular
stabilizer has been changed.

919
01:21:10,763 --> 01:21:14,433
Very clever, Dr. Gibbs.

920
01:21:14,475 --> 01:21:17,311
You changed the access code.

921
01:21:17,394 --> 01:21:19,647
B.ut I thought we had an agreement.

922
01:21:19,688 --> 01:21:22,525
I let your son live
ifyou cooperate.

923
01:21:22,608 --> 01:21:24,652
Well, it's time to renegotiate.

924
01:21:24,735 --> 01:21:28,280
He and the girl go free,
then you get your access code.

925
01:21:28,364 --> 01:21:30,658
Fine.

926
01:21:30,741 --> 01:21:34,662
Get those kids out of there,
then bring that old man to me.

927
01:21:35,413 --> 01:21:37,123
Zak, what are you doing?.

928
01:21:37,164 --> 01:21:39,250
Finishing what I came here to do.
Come here.

929
01:21:42,169 --> 01:21:45,339
- Gates tookyour watch.
- Gates took a watch.

930
01:21:45,423 --> 01:21:48,467
He'd probably get $1 0 for it on eBay.
I switched them in the elevator.

931
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,437
Zak, you can't accelerate
when you're already in hypertime.

932
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,564
- It could kill you.
- We don't have a choice.

933
01:22:01,647 --> 01:22:04,650
- No, Zak!
- We don't have any choice.

934
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,036
Unbelievable.

935
01:22:18,789 --> 01:22:22,126
Your molecules are moving so fast,
your hand went right through the table.

936
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:26,172
Are you okay?.

937
01:22:30,843 --> 01:22:32,386
I have no idea.

938
01:23:11,342 --> 01:23:12,760
Here we go.

939
01:23:12,843 --> 01:23:16,263
Sir, we got a problem in there.
The kid is doing something freaky.

940
01:23:16,347 --> 01:23:19,183
Well, bring him down!

941
01:23:40,413 --> 01:23:42,164
You know what to do.

942
01:23:52,299 --> 01:23:53,509
Hi.

943
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,180
Mr. Gates!

944
01:25:13,714 --> 01:25:15,049
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

945
01:25:18,052 --> 01:25:20,096
Zak.
Your plan worked.

946
01:25:23,099 --> 01:25:25,017
Let's get out of here.

947
01:25:33,275 --> 01:25:35,653
- Say good night, little man.
- No!

948
01:25:39,532 --> 01:25:40,991
Good night, little man.

949
01:25:45,746 --> 01:25:49,208
Yeah.
It hurts, doesn't it?.

950
01:25:52,128 --> 01:25:53,379
Thankyou.

951
01:26:01,637 --> 01:26:04,098
I'll take that, thankyou.

952
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:35,546
So what do you have in mind
for our next date?.

953
01:26:45,055 --> 01:26:50,144
Dopler, next time you need help with
your math homework, don't call me.

954
01:26:50,227 --> 01:26:52,605
Dr. G.

955
01:26:52,688 --> 01:26:55,858
Did you ever get this little
anti-aging gizmo working?.

956
01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:58,277
'Cause I don't wanna
stay like this forever.

957
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,280
Forget about it.
I never got a chance to test it.

958
01:27:23,385 --> 01:27:25,471
Oh, thank God you're okay.

959
01:27:28,766 --> 01:27:31,268
- What happened?.
- It's okay.

960
01:27:31,352 --> 01:27:34,063
I'm just a little more
distinguished, that's all.

961
01:27:34,146 --> 01:27:36,399
Where's Zak?.

962
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,526
He'll be here in a minute.
He had to make a stop.

963
01:27:38,609 --> 01:27:41,153
- What?.
- No, no. He's just fine.

964
01:27:41,237 --> 01:27:45,157
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Oh, honey, it's so good to see you.

965
01:27:46,826 --> 01:27:48,619
There he is.

966
01:27:51,789 --> 01:27:56,419
Oh, Zak!
Oh, thank God you're okay.

967
01:27:56,502 --> 01:27:58,671
- You must be Francesca.
- Hi.

968
01:27:58,754 --> 01:28:02,425
Hey, creepy. Nice ride.
I hearyou're a big hero now.

969
01:28:02,508 --> 01:28:05,052
Well, I wouldn't say hero, but--

970
01:28:05,136 --> 01:28:08,222
Look, I'm not gonna be nice
all day, so enjoy it.

971
01:28:09,014 --> 01:28:11,100
- Hey, who's that?.
- Actually, honey...

972
01:28:11,183 --> 01:28:13,519
there's something I forgot
to tell you on the phone.

973
01:28:13,602 --> 01:28:15,521
We had a little problem
at the lab.

974
01:28:15,604 --> 01:28:18,524
I guess we're gonna have
some company for a while?.

975
01:28:18,607 --> 01:28:21,318
Oh, hey, Mrs. G.
How's it hangin'?.

976
01:28:21,402 --> 01:28:24,697
- Dopler?.
- Hello, gorgeous.

977
01:28:26,991 --> 01:28:29,034
Over. Over.

978
01:28:29,118 --> 01:28:30,619
More. More.

979
01:28:35,249 --> 01:28:38,377
Hit it. Let's see what
this thing can do. Yeah!

980
01:28:49,013 --> 01:28:51,056
Buckle up!

981
01:28:55,352 --> 01:28:56,896
Wait! Wait!
