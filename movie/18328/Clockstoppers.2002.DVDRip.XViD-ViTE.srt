不，不，就这样了. 下车.

259
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:38,044
Hey, "Freaker", you trippin' on some bad lunch meat?
嘿，变态，你碰到些臭肉午餐了?

260
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:40,882
I hear you signed up for the spin-off tonight.
我听说你要参加今晚的晚会.

261
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:42,546
Ditmar, lay off.
Ditmar, lay off.

262
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:45,182
Yo, yo, yo, I ain't on him, all right?
哟，哟, 我不是他, 行了吧?

263
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:47,158
Listen up here, buddy.

Tonight it's just gonna be me and you on stage.

265
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,865
You aren't gonna have your little sister backing you up.
你的小妹妹不会支持你的.

266
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:56,869
What was that? 'Cause all I hear is a crowd going, "Go, Meeker! Go, Meeker!"!
那是什么，我听到的都是人群和噪音 "上, Meeker! 上, Meeker!"

267
00:22:56,937 --> 00:22:58,871
This guy's hot, man!

268
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:00,839
I need to cool him off!

269
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,301
Later, jerk-wad.

Let's go.

我是 Dit-O. 我今晚在地下滑... 想来吗?

272
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:19,319
You won't leave me hanging tonight? - No, dude, I'll be there.
你不会让我一个人在哪吧? 放心，哥们，我会去的.

273
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:23,227
Relax. He probably blows anyway, man.
别紧张. 也许他不敢去呢.

274
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:25,230
I gotta go do something about this.
我得做点什么.

275
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:28,995
Oh, what's the matter? No habla ingls?

276
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:33,699
No, it's so very hard for me. But I try to watch and learn.
不，对我来说太难了. 但是我劲力看，努力学了.

All right, make a hole, boys.

280
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:43,105
Yo, I got a hole for ya.
对，我给你弄了个洞.

281
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:48,946
That's a perfectly good trash can. Don't be throwing students at it.

Come on, both ofyou. You okay?

Move it. - He started it!

285
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,967
I don't care who started it. You finished it.

286
00:23:59,035 --> 00:24:00,900
I didn't need any help.
我不需要任何帮助.

287
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,029
I wasn't... I wasn't...

288
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:06,132
I was looking for my buddy's retainer in the garbage.
我在垃圾桶里找我小车的固定器.

289

These band freaks always, you know...

Okay, well, since I have you here...
好吧，既然我让你在这...

A cup of coffee after school. Come on.

好吧，你完事之后怎么样? 我有好多事.

298
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,700
Would it be such a stretch for some of your plans to include me?
你的那么多事里都没我的份吗?

299
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:39,173
All right.
好吧.

300
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:41,870
I guess we all deserve a second chance.

Here's my address.

The only thing is, I have to baby-sit my brother and sister...
有件事是，我必须要看着我的弟弟，妹妹...

Okay, so I'll see you then. - Great.
Ok，到时候见. 太好了.

307
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:34,422
I thought maybe we could spend some time by the pool while the sun's still nice.
我想我们可以在游泳池边看看夕阳.

There's another rake over there.

Rake?
耙子?

311
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:47,166

When I said "second chance"...

Look at it this way.

你出来和咖啡，总要暂停一下.

320
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:12,762

想要暂停，除非我把叶子都耙完了.

321
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:17,035
Yeah, well, are you gonna do the whole thing by hand?
好啦，难道你要手动做这一切?

322
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:20,475
Yeah. My father says it develops self-discipline.
是啊，我爸说他自己定了这个规则.

323
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:23,512
That's what people always say when they want you to do stuff for free.

324
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:30,517

So where did you move after that?

When I was 1, we left Caracas to go to London.
我15岁的时候离开加拉加斯去伦敦

Wow, you've lived everywhere.
哦，这么说你在世界各地都住过.

我爸带我们去过一次lego岛. 还有泰祭陵和埃菲尔铁塔.

333
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:06,019
Don't feel bad. At least you have a place to call home.
别难过. 起码你还能打电话回家.

334
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:10,025
Yeah, I guess, but it must be pretty cool being a consul's daughter.
是啊，不过我才当领事的女儿感觉肯定很酷吧.

335
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:12,323
That makes you, like, royalty, doesn't it?
给你一种皇家成员的感觉?

336
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:14,829
Right. I'm waited on hand and foot.
对，我从头到脚都有人伺候.

337

I would like to catch the dog that does this.
我来抓狗和干这个吧.

338
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:23,605
I was gonna make us iced cappuccinos.
我本来想给我们弄点冰奶咖啡的.

339
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:27,074
Cappuccino? We don't have to paint the house or wash the car first?
冰奶咖啡? 难到我们不用先洗洗车，刷刷房什么的?

340
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:28,576
No!
不用!

341
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:32,471
Here, here, I'll do that.
来，来，让我来.

342
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:35,483
I'll finish up out here and you start on the caffeine.
我要在外面完事，然后再来点咖啡因.

I don't know.

348
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:48,324
16:57.
16:57.

349
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:49,729
Whatever that is.

350
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,733
Right. I'll be right back.

A little coffee, a little swim.

353
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:08,049

Go! Go! Get outta here!

You big rat! Come on!

I think I found your troublemaker.
我想我找到麻烦你的人了.

不管你们扔什么，这家伙都会犯心脏病的.

361

I have no idea.

你和你的老鼠, 这就是奇怪的地方. 我并不是想使你有错觉.

I just pushed this button.

I think it was the watch.

This must be the thing my dad is helping him with.

He said something about it accelerating your molecules so fast...
他说什么会使你的分子加速太快...

我想我们必须要碰着对方它才能发挥作用.

It's a quick and dirty comedown from hypertime.
从超时间回来后你的分子又快又不稳定.

531
00:47:55,502 --> 00:47:58,369
The cold slows your molecular activity.
低温能使你的分子速度减慢

532
00:48:05,712 --> 00:48:08,476
Probably faster to gnaw off my hand.

So, is it me or are they trying to kill you too?
那么他们是要杀我们还光杀我?

538
00:48:37,878 --> 00:48:39,402
Give me the watch. - No!
给我表. 不!

542
00:48:48,455 --> 00:48:51,583
You crazy lunatic! - "Crazy lunatic"? That's redundant.

给我! 快!

544

Hey, dude!

Whatever you do, don't get it wet!
不管你怎么着，别把它弄湿了!

546
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:43,864
So strange.
真怪.

547
00:50:43,937 --> 00:50:46,371
Seems fine...
好像好了

548
00:50:46,439 --> 00:50:50,808
although his vitals are elevated.

Mom. - Zak! Is he okay?
妈. Zak! 他怎么样?

553
00:51:03,656 --> 00:51:06,090

他会好起来的. 只是轻微脑震荡.

554
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:08,389
How you feeling? - Okay, I think.

Good. So you can stand trial. - What?

556
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:14,396
Hello! You stole a van and crashed it.
你偷了那辆车，对不对.

This doesn't have to go on his record, does it?

No, you don't understand.
不，你不明白.

563
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,452
I was in hypertime with these guys, and they were after my watch.
我当时在超时间里，那些家伙想抢我的表.

564
00:51:37,657 --> 00:51:40,490
It's a molecular accelerator. Here.
那是个分子加速器. 这.

565

What are you doing?
