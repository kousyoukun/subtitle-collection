In 972, the Fatimids founded Al-Azhar,

5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,190
to make it a center for Islamic knowledge.

6
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,910
The Great Imam

7
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,510
is the highest authority in Sunni Islam.

8
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,630
For centuries the rulers of Egypt

9
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,390
have tried to control Al-Azhar.

10
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,590
So far they have not succeeded.

Come on, wake up!

16
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,830
Good day!

17
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,550
It's for you.

18
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,310
Open it.

19
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,710
'You have been accepted to Al-Azhar University.

20
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,270
Congratulations!

21
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,550
Come on!

22
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,750
God has blessed you with a gift.

23
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,270
You used to come here every day to read.

24
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,790
Al-Azhar is the greatest Islamic institution in the world.

25
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,590
And they chose you.

26
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,710
Come on!

27
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,830
Yes, father?

28
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,830
Give me a hand.

29
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,110
You smell like tobacco.

30
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,710
Everyone, put your hands up!

31
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,670
What are you doing?

32
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,190
Hush, you're going to wake up dad.

33
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,150
What is this?

34
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,950
I received a scholarship.
- Can not be!

35
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,670
For Cairo? -Yes.

36
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,190
What will you say to dad?

37
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,030
I don't know.

38
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,670
You know what he is like. He will understand.

39
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,150
What do you want? Go to sleep!

40
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,310
God gave you a brain

41
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,070
who thinks more than necessary.

42
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,710
You are like your mother.

43
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,790
She was always curious, peace be upon her.

44
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,630
She sent you to school

45
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,030
so that you don't become a fisherman like me!

46
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,030
I had your brother read the letter to me.

47
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,270
If God wants you to go to Cairo,

48
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,670
no one should hinder Him.

49
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,270
Even your father.

50
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,310
On your way!

51
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,790
Thank you.

52
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,670
I will miss you.

53
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,950
Take care of yourself, Adam.

54
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,710
Will you take care of dad?

55
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,150
Do you promise?

56
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,950
Look at me.

57
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,190
Do you promise?

58
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,670
You know how much I love you.

59
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,710
Yes, father.

60
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,550
Don't forget where you're from.
- No, Dad.

61
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,550
Good bye.

62
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,190
Goodbye, father.

63
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,150
Oh! Al-Azhar!

64
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,110
This is the elite!

65
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,310
God bless you with knowledge!

66
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,990
What is your name? - Adam, sir.

67
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,670
What a nice name!

68
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,550
If God said, by completing your studies,
you will become Sheikh Adam!

69
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,630
Here it is.

70
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,430
Goodbye.

71
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,910
The third floor, the corridor on the right,
the district office.

72
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,350
Thank you.
- Good luck!

73
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,590
Excuse me.

74
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,950
Hello.

75
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,390
It seems to me that you are in my bed.

76
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,230
No, this is mine.

77
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,430
Is that so?

78
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,870
Is this bed available?

79
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,150
Do you snore? - No.

80
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,190
Are you sure?

81
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,590
Then it is free.

82
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,150
Are you new here?

83
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,590
Yes, I just arrived.

84
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,830
Welcome.

85
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,910
Will you put out if you love?

86
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,190
This life is just a game

87
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,230
fun

88
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,870
bragging and competition
for material wealth.

89
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,710
Like the rain

90
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,910
to make the grass be pleased
with itself because it grows.

91
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,230
It will then dry out

92
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,030
it will turn yellow

93
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,230
and it will turn to dust and rubbish.

94
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,390
The afterlife is eternal. And there

95
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,910
Only God's forgiveness matters.

96
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,390
What are you doing?

97
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,670
Am I? I am creating a new brand of cigarettes.

98
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,390
My own brand.

99
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,390
Listen, Adam.

100
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,990
It doesn't matter who you are,
but who you want to be.

101
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,030
We're running late.

102
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,430
Calm down, Sardine.

103
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,710
God has rewarded you with a sure hand.

104
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,590
You don't tremble.

105
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,270
In the name of the merciful God,

106
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,550
Al-Azhar is the guiding light
of the Islamic world.

107
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,270
And on the day

108
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,950
in which you will leave Al-Azhar

109
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,310
and you will return to your villages,

110
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,190
and you will become bearers
of this knowledge.

111
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,790
Are you all right, Sheikh*?

112
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,070
Make way!

113
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,070
Shout the doctors!

114
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,950
The Grand Imam's condition
is still critical.

115
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,150
What does he say?

116
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,350
Let's pray for the great imam.

117
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,430
We wish him a speedy recovery!

118
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,710
Good day. I have a meeting
with the general.

119
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,550
Okay, sir. Park in tomorrow.

120
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,230
Open the door.

121
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,190
Who will take over the situation?

122
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,670
Colonel Ibrahim, sir.

123
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,190
Sednete.

124
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,270
As you all know

125
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,870
the great imam died yesterday.

126
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,070
Rest in peace.

127
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,990
Now it is necessary

128
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,350
our candidate to become
the new grand imam.

129
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,070
Of course, sir.

130
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,870
Who are our insiders?

131
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,110
We have eyes and ears,
but it's complicated.

132
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,390
It is very difficult.

133
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,710
Idiots changed the constitution.

134
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,310
Now the grand imam is appointed for life.

135
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,590
It is not a matter of issuing
minor religious prescriptions.

136
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,990
The choice of a great imam

137
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,870
is a matter of national security.

138
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,390
No one should hold a post for life,

139
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,190
except our president!

140
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,710
We don't want that!

141
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,950
It is unacceptable for usto have
two pharaohs in the country!

142
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,670
Sheikh Durrani is close
to the Muslim Brotherhood.

143
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,590
He supports terrorists!

144
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,710
Slepiya Sheikh

145
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,230
is one of the most popular
imams in Egypt.

146
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,590
And it is not known to be biased.

147
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,310
President

148
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,550
iska Beblavi.

149
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,790
His views coincide with
those of the president.

150
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,670
Make sure they choose it.

151
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,590
Consider the task accomplished.

152
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,830
Do you have a prayer rug?

153
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,790
Ahmed, bring the general a prayer rug!

154
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,270
Stay away until they choose
the new grand imam.

155
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,670
Until they choose you.

156
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,950
Please!

157
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,830
Don't get involved.

158
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,710
Who does the council want?

159
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,750
The majority wants the Blind Sheikh.

160
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,550
We want another.

161
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,510
I was exposed. You must release me.

162
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,790
Do you know what the sentence
is for traitors?

163
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,430
Name me new "angel

164
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,830
Unattached Freshman.

165
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,590
Don't worry.

166
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,550
Close your eyes

167
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,270
to see the truth.

168
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,550
Need is blind

169
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,630
until she becomes conscious.

170
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,030
And freedom is a conscious necessity.

171
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,430
Do you know who said it?

172
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,910
Jewish philosopher Karl Marx.

173
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,390
Furthermore, he said that religion

174
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,270
is proof of the mental impotence of man

175
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,950
in the face of what he cannot understand.

176
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,550
Life is not a game.

177
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,830
Hello

178
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,550
Hello

179
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,830
Where are you from?

180
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,390
Fire Manzala.

181
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,070
ribar?

182
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,430
I am Sheikh Negm's assistant.
If you need help...

183
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,070
Blagodary.

184
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,950
Tell me which doctrine does
Sheikh Negm follow?

185
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,710
The truth.

186
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,390
What is the truth?

187
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,030
Truth on Sheikh Negm.

188
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,270
Do you want to pray?

189
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,150
Are you going to the center yet?

190
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,190
I will go tonight. Do you want to come?

191
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,150
dobre.

192
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,150
This is halal.

193
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,750
Drink!

194
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,990
'I found a replacement.
Son of a fisherman."

195
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,150
What?

196
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,110
she.

197
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,750
Your soul is still pure.

198
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,750
What?

199
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,070
But every single moment in this
place will corrupt her.

200
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,670
Wait here.

201
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,310
This morning

202
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,150
One of our students was found dead.

203
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,150
Colonel Ibrahim is here,

204
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,790
to investigate this tragedy.

205
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,790
God help him.

206
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,670
to discover the truth.

207
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,110
Excuse me for intruding on such
a delicate moment.

208
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,150
We can end our investigation

209
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,910
until a new grand imam is elected.

210
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,950
Can you tell me when this
will be announced?

211
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,190
The question is purely technical.

212
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,230
We have our own rules and we follow them.

213
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,950
May God guide you.

214
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,110
Who was his teacher?

215
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,550
He was an assistant in my department.

216
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,230
What else can you tell me about him?

217
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,070
Nothing you don't already know.

218
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,670
Why is State Security investigating this?

219
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,150
The deceased has foreign citizenship.

220
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,790
President Nasser tried to turn Al-Azhar
into a state institution.

221
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,190
Sadat tried to corrupt him.

222
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,830
And Mrs. Suzanne Mubarak tried
to change the laws of God,

223
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,310
to please the Americans
and the women around her.

224
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,110
So tell us, Colonel,

225
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,430
What are your instructions?

226
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,510
I just want to know why the boy is dead.

227
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,670
osamat

228
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,190
Where are you from?

229
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,110
From Alexandria.

230
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,750
Ahmed of Giza.

231
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,270
me?

232
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,350
Adam Taha.

233
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,790
Where are you from Adam? - From Manzala.

234
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,230
A fisherman? - Yes.

235
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,910
You are free.

236
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,550
Forget about the legs.

237
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,070
After sunset, go out through
the exit that Zizo showed you.

238
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,190
Then take a bus to the center.

239
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,230
Descent of Mohandesin

240
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,110
to the Arab League.

241
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,710
There is an American cafe there.

242
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,430
I'll meet you there.

243
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,030
Order something

244
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,030
and sit at a table next to me.

245
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,310
Take out your phone

246
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,310
It's like you're talking to someone.

247
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,710
Did you order something?

248
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,190
I'm not hungry, sir.

249
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,030
If you don't order, they'll kick you out.

250
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,830
I have no money.

251
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,710
Order a cinnamon latte and brownies
with cream.

252
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,630
Duck with cinnamon

253
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,550
and brownies with cream.

254
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,070
Save them until our next meeting.

255
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,630
Don't you have relatives in Cairo?

256
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,230
I don't have any.

257
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,510
Well, what happened?

258
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,590
On the way back from the mosque

259
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,270
men were waiting for us.

260
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,910
what?

261
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,110
Men with knives.

262
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,030
Officially, your friend died
in an accident.

263
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,150
But as you saw, he was killed.

264
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,830
We will find out who did it.

265
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,510
And they will pay for it.

266
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,190
We want you to help us.

267
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,150
Sir, all I know.

268
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,710
Wij, Adam

269
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,870
I only ask you to attend the dawn prayer.

270
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,230
Shall I pray?

271
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,070
Praying and observing who else is praying.

272
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,750
Remember their faces, learn their names.

273
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,110
Adam? - Yes it's me.

274
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,790
Someone asked me to do something.

275
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,070
I am not sure if this
is acceptable or a sin.

276
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,950
A right is a right, a sin is a sin.

277
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,430
God will guide you.

278
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,790
Prayer is better than sleep.

279
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,750
God is great. There is no other God.

280
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,790
Straight line, upright posture.
No distance between you.

281
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,750
We will all die, my children.

282
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,750
Who complains

283
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,950
of life's accidents and God's outline,

284
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,150
he will weaken his faith.

285
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,030
Now go.

286
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,190
Please pray for your brother

287
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,110
and pray to God to have mercy on him

288
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,710
and forgive his sins.

289
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,030
Do you have the names? - No.

290
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,550
Your father has gallstones.

291
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,390
That's why it hurts.

292
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,630
If left untreated, he will die.

293
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,590
We have a hospital in Dhakalia.

294
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,310
I will arrange the operation.

295
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,030
He won't know you helped him.

296
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,750
We do not forget those who work for us.

297
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,510
But I have to ask you.

298
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,630
Don't call your village imam anymore.

299
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,510
And I want you to know who prays
at dawn in the mosque.

300
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,230
Sharia is not Islamic law.

301
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,390
It is rather a divine right.

302
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,550
Fiqh is the human interpretation
of this right.

303
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,310
There are five principles in Sharia:

304
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,950
care for religion, soul, material goods

305
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,550
generation and reason.

306
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,950
Declare yourself!

307
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,350
Bro...

308
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,830
I have a study group for those who wish

309
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,190
to improve their recitation.

310
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,990
Come on in.

311
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,590
Aslam.

312
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,630
Asfur.

313
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,230
Harun.

314
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,630
Nazim.

315
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,630
God bless you!

316
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,950
Bravo.

317
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,590
You're okay, bro.

318
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,030
He sings, Sheikh!

319
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,310
Leave it.

320
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,230
He is new here.

321
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,750
He doesn't know that we don't sing here.

322
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,750
It is forbidden to sing the Koran.

323
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,710
STATE SECURITY

324
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,630
Enter!

325
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,230
Honorable Sheikh!

326
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,670
Come in, sir

327
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,350
How can I help you?

328
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,390
I have come to confess.

329
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,870
Admit it?

330
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,990
I killed him.

331
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,190
Please, I can't believe it!

332
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,190
Sit down, please.
- Why?

333
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,270
Because I'm blind?

334
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,950
No, but you are a respected scientist.

335
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,590
Do you have another suspect?

336
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,590
No, but we are still investigating the case.

337
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,430
We"? Which "we"?

338
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,150
I'm talking about State Security.

339
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,310
Who do you work for?

340
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,030
For the president?

341
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,270
Correct.

342
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:51,230
My president is Almighty God.

343
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,430
Very good, Sheikh.

344
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,190
How could you be so reckless?

345
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,150
Recruiting a foreign informant?

346
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,510
And what's more, the assistant
of the Blind Sheikh!

347
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,550
What were you thinking?

348
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,950
I never planned for him to die, sir.

349
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,030
Stop the sarcasm, man.

350
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,670
I know, every morning in front
of the mirror you say to yourself

351
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,750
Why am I not the boss?

352
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,870
You are older than me.

353
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,110
You've worked here much longer.

354
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,950
Do you know why they didn't promote you?
- No, sir.

355
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,830
But I have a feeling that you know
and are getting ready to tell me.

356
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,310
I swear to you

357
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,950
if it blows up in our face,

358
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,350
It's over with you, not with me!

359
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,790
Clear? - Yes.

360
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,630
listen.

361
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,350
You leave me no choice.

362
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,630
Arrest him!

363
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,910
Good day.

364
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,750
Aslam Aslan, Nazim bin Syed...

365
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,150
Nazim bin Saeed?

366
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,310
Sounds like a foreign name.

367
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,350
He is from Algeria.

368
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,910
I hear your father's surgery went well.

369
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,950
I am eternally grateful to you.

370
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,910
You don't need to thank me.

371
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,390
Your work is important to us.

372
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,230
I will tell you a secret.

373
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,670
We believe that the Muslim Brotherhood
infiltrated Al-Azhar.

374
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,070
And they ordered the murder of your friend.

375
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,350
Do you know this book?

376
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,630
This is a guide to modern jihad.

377
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,070
But it is forbidden, sir.

378
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,150
Let Nazim see you with her.

379
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,150
Don't be afraid.

380
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,230
How are you? - Okay.

381
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,070
The infidels who are in power

382
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,910
They treat true Muslims as terrorists.

383
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,310
We invite you to tea with us.

384
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,390
Blagodary.

385
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,350
Do you like to read forbidden books?

386
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,870
Adam, we are family here.

387
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,270
You can trust us.

388
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,270
Not the books condemned by God

389
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,550
or idolatrous books.

390
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,110
The books that scare tyrants

391
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,550
and the kings.

392
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,670
It is time for every Muslim
to make a choice.

393
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,270
Children are being killed in Palestine.

394
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,190
In Syria and Iraq, they rape our women.

395
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,550
China built extermination concentration camps

396
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,270
of the Muslims.

397
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:48,110
Yet our leaders turn a blind eye
and take their money.

398
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,790
In Burma they kill us.

399
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,990
And what does the so-called
"civilized" world say?

400
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,190
They give the Nobel Peace Prize

401
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,990
of the leader of the criminal gangs
that kill us.

402
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,630
There is no need to look further.

403
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,110
Al-Azhar!

404
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,270
The guiding ray of Islam in the world.

405
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,910
What does Al-Azhar say about all this?

406
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,350
Nothing.

407
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,670
And speaking of that,

408
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,590
Do you know what happened
to the Blind Sheikh?

409
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,430
I heard he was sick.

410
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,670
State security arrested him.

411
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,710
They will keep him until the grand imam
they want is elected heh.

412
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,190
They think they can scare the Council

413
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,590
and for him to choose their puppet candidate.

414
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,790
But they will fail.

415
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,430
The corrupt leaders

416
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,590
on this side

417
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,070
try to prevent God's will.

418
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,870
And they use snakes

419
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,750
to penetrate among us.

420
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,510
Your friend Zizo.

421
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,150
Some say I killed him.

422
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,950
Seriously bros?

423
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,950
Why do you think they say that?

424
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,110
Do you know what I think?

425
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,190
He was killed by State Security.

426
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,950
bro

427
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,190
Want to do more than just read?

428
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,390
Soliman thinks you have arrested
the Blind Sheikh,

429
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,590
to force the Council to select
your candidate.

430
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,030
He says you will fail, sir.

431
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,870
Am I going to fail?

432
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,150
That's what he said, sir.

433
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,310
You said it, Adam.

434
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,230
No, he said it, not me.

435
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,670
He doesn't trust you. He's using you
as a courier.

436
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,270
You have to earn his trust.
- How?

437
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,910
Do you share his views?

438
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,870
I'm taking that as a yes

439
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,430
Does it matter what I believe, sir?

440
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,270
Yes, of course. For him.

441
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,790
Like Satan

442
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,590
penetrating pious minds?

443
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,630
Welcome to the dark side.

444
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,390
Shut up.

445
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,710
"The establishment of the kingdom of God
on earth, the destruction of human,

446
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,670
the struggle with the power of the usurpers
and its return to God,

447
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,230
the supremacy of divine law alone,

448
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,550
the abolition of human laws

449
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,630
and to all those who do not follow
the instructions..."

450
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,710
Raed, please!

451
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,750
The point of importance" by Said Kutb.

452
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,710
Bro?

453
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,750
Why are you hanging around
Soliman and his gang?

454
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,070
This is a study group only.
- A group of which he is the leader.

455
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,750
You know they hate me, right?

456
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,110
Idiot!

457
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,230
Not a word about the book!
- I will be silent.

458
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,270
Will you take part in the recitation
competition on Friday?

459
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,910
Against your new friends.

460
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,670
Are you sure? - Yes always.

461
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,390
Don't come crying to me
when you lose on Friday.

462
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,790
Come on, let's go.

463
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,390
Why don't you like Sol Iman?

464
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,950
I just don't like it.

465
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,430
Because of how he behaves with
your friend Raed?

466
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,630
He is not my friend.

467
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,670
Is that so?

468
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,110
Does he suspect you?

469
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,910
Don't worry.

470
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,550
I'll shut him up.

471
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,390
Why do you care?

472
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,430
He's not your friend, is he?

473
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,310
Tariq Ibn Ziyad burned his boats
when he arrived in Spain.

474
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,030
He said to his men: "The sea is behind us,
the enemy is before us."

475
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,510
Do I have to burn your father's
boat to motivate you?

476
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,790
Gained Soliman's trust.

477
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,110
How is dad?

478
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,230
Has anyone visited you?

479
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,070
Niko?

480
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,230
Sorry, I can't talk anymore.

481
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,910
I miss you.

482
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,430
spri

483
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,870
Stop it, Asfur.

484
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,110
Forget "they persisted."

485
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,630
They persevered and looked proud.

486
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,750
And now the two finalists remain!

487
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,830
The winner is Raed Abdelmajid!

488
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,750
Congratulations, son!

489
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,950
What do you want?

490
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,070
What do you want?

491
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,750
Informant! - What have I done?

492
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,030
Is it because I won?

493
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,590
What is this?

494
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,630
They are not mine.

495
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,350
Dirty rat!

496
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,870
Adam...

497
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,590
What have you gotten yourself into?

498
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,270
You did the right thing, brother.

499
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,190
God punishes the unbelievers.

500
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,390
God bless you.

501
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,910
Bravo.

502
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,550
Adam...

503
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,710
Who gave you "Important Points"?

504
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,670
You know this book is forbidden.

505
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,350
Who gave you your copy? - My uncle.

506
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,150
There is also a book stall.

507
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,030
Seriously? - Yes.

508
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,630
He sells books, God bless him.

509
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,750
Here it is.

510
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,030
Put it on speaker.

511
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,430
Hello?

512
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,390
Hello uncle, how are you?

513
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,150
Hi Adam, how are you?

514
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,710
We miss you.

515
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,430
I'm fine.

516
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,430
I just wanted

517
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,870
to thank you.

518
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,030
About the book you gave me.

519
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,910
What? I do not understand.

520
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:00,710
The book I took from you.

521
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,030
The book.

522
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,630
Don't you remember?

523
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,390
I really don't understand.
Is there a problem?

524
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,870
No, uncle.

525
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,590
S.O.S

526
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,430
Who are you writing to?
Give me your phone.

527
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,230
Watch it.

528
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,150
Disappear!

529
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,190
Who do you work for?

530
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,510
I don't understand.

531
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,870
Damn stairs!

532
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,310
Look down.

533
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,390
How many meters are they to the ground?

534
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,710
Maybe 13.

535
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,910
Your body will be unrecognizable.

536
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,550
Who do you take orders from, boy?

537
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,230
By Sheikh Durrani, Sir!

538
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,310
Are you sure you want to play
games with me?

539
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,230
I carry out orders that I receive
over the phone.

540
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,550
You are resigning today.

541
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,790
And you will tell Sheikh Durrani
that Adam will replace you.

542
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,350
Then you told the university that you
wanted to pursue something else.

543
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,310
Tourism, maybe.

544
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,910
I hear he's picking up speed again.

545
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,790
The sphinx smiles again.

546
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,590
Yes, sir.

547
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,150
Coffee.

548
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,310
Can you make coffee?

549
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:02,550
Today my assistant resigned.

550
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,510
He was like the son I never had.

551
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,350
I recommended you as my deputy.

552
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,430
I told him not to worry.

553
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,190
Go to the pharmacy.

554
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,950
Get me paracetamol for children.

555
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,430
And a rubber comb for babies.

556
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,670
It's for the child.
- Of course.

557
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,910
Congratulations.

558
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,950
It's for my son's son, idiot!
I'm a grandfather.

559
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,150
Congratulations on your new job.

560
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,710
How do I karash?

561
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,310
Do you already have a girlfriend?

562
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,390
Was there anything else, sir?

563
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,190
Are you into anything in particular?

564
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,350
Answer me, boy!

565
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,790
No, sir.

566
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,390
You're up for something special,
aren't you?

567
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,870
Do you think you have a gift?

568
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,590
Is that why you got this scholarship?

569
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,430
You are nothing!

570
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,230
Have you ever wondered why we are
looking for people like you?

571
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,110
We helped you so you could help us.

572
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,430
Maybe your friend

573
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,630
The village imam helped us find you.

574
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,630
No, you are not better than others.

575
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,510
I took a big risk to get rid of your skin.

576
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,030
Give me something.

577
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,390
Whatever.

578
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,870
Today he asked me to buy baby things

579
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,070
for his son to his son.

580
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,270
He has no son.

581
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,870
Tonight you have to go downtown.

582
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,750
I want McDonald's.

583
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:24,230
Everyone says the meat in their
burgers is halal.

584
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,110
Take me two Big Macs

585
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,430
with fries and ketchup extra.

586
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:36,590
If someone sees you, say they are for you.

587
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,750
He just wants me to buy him McDonald's.

588
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,430
I will drive you.

589
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,430
Let's go.

590
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,030
We just passed McDonald's.

591
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,190
Gospodine...

592
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,790
Good evening. Colonel Ibrahim, I called you.

593
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,390
Get in, Colonel.

594
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,190
Command, sir.

595
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,350
Welcome. Enter.

596
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,190
Enter the living room.

597
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,630
Welcome.

598
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,270
Um Reem is Sheikh Durrani's housekeeper.

599
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,070
Sit down.

600
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,630
May God protect him, he is a man of God,
he gives us everything we need.

601
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,270
What will you drink?

602
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,710
We will not hold back.
- Hibiscus or Pepsi?

603
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,750
I don't have to deal with it.
- Good.

604
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,790
Welcome.

605
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,710
There, sir.

606
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,750
How are you, Rome?

607
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,590
My name is Ibrahim.

608
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,150
Can I hold it?

609
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,710
His diapers need to be changed.

610
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,710
You are very cute!

611
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,270
God bless him!

612
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,030
What a beautiful baby!

613
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,110
We need to talk to your daughter.

614
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,630
I will leave you.

615
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,830
God bless you.

616
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,030
Who is the father, Rome?

617
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,630
Please don't ask me about that!

618
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,110
Don't be afraid.

619
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,790
Nobody will harm you.

620
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,990
Sheikh Durrani is a great man.

621
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,230
He is like a father to me,
I don't miss anything.

622
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,390
It's my fault.

623
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,270
Will they take it?

624
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,070
Listen, Rome.

625
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,150
If you keep quiet, no one will
pick up on it.

626
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,070
Did you understand?

627
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,150
Let's go.

628
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,790
Goodbye, Rome.

629
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,990
What's up?

630
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,910
I don't believe what she said.

631
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,990
How can she be sure that Durrani
is the father?

632
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,070
He took her virginity.

633
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,990
How do you know?

634
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:19,990
Thanks to you.

635
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,190
You discovered his secret.

636
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,430
After seeing you, I did some research.

637
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,590
I found you were right.

638
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,390
Sheikh Durrani has no son.

639
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,590
There are only girls.

640
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,630
He has secretly married Rome.

641
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,790
He bought her that apartment.

642
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,350
Do you think he did it out of kindness?

643
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,430
Why are you telling me all this?

644
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,630
Make sure Durrani doesn't become
the next Grand Imam.

645
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,030
Just a moment.

646
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,870
This world is in decline.

647
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:28,310
The signs of the Last Judgment are visible.

648
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,070
Ignorance of religion has spread,

649
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,830
the denial of religious precepts

650
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,150
and attacks on the Prophet's way of life.

651
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,590
The spread of obscenity

652
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,790
usury and bank interest

653
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:55,270
alcohol consumption and entertainment...

654
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:01,510
The House of Islam has caught
fire and is burning!

655
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,110
Muslim brotherhood

656
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,670
Salafis...

657
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,870
You give...

658
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,150
They all aim to burn the home
of Islam to the ground.

659
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,510
And women appear

660
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,350
purely naked on the streets.

661
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,310
And outsiders have more trust

662
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,870
of the hypocrites than
of the true believers,

663
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,030
who are falsely accused

664
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,590
and criticism of customs!

665
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,550
Good night.
- You too.

666
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:16,870
Come in!

667
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,950
Good evening, respected Sheikh.

668
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:31,030
Aren't you Sheikh Durrani's
new assistant?

669
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,350
I have something to share with you.

670
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,870
I don't like gossip, boy.

671
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,430
He got a girl pregnant.

672
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,710
A girl the age of his children.

673
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,750
The next great imam - father
of an illegitimate child?

674
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,310
If your statement is true,

675
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,950
this will destroy Al-Azhar's reputation.

676
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:36,430
I refuse to blame Sheikh Durrani.

677
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,990
I will, sir.

678
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,230
you?

679
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,270
Who are you? Who will listen to you?

680
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,310
He would listen to me.

681
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,110
Who do you work for?

682
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,030
For Sheikh Durrani, sir.

683
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,950
Sheikh Durrani.

684
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,310
Good evening.

685
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,110
Damn it

686
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,190
All the applause, clever man!

687
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,390
Zizo was your informant, wasn't he?

688
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,830
That's why he's dead.

689
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,630
They killed him.

690
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,230
Did you kill him?

691
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:26,630
Tariq Ibn Ziyad never burned boats.

692
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:31,030
This is a myth propagated by his enemies.

693
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,310
Actually, he had no boats.

694
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,910
He borrowed them from
a Spanish nobleman.

695
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:45,110
His men would not have won
if they were afraid.

696
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,030
They fought because they
believed in victory.

697
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,510
I want guarantees.

698
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,670
Of course.

699
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:10,070
I guarantee that if you fail,

700
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,590
You'll wish what happened
to Zizo happened to you.

701
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,230
Reverend Sheikh.

702
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,070
You are next in line for the post
of grand imam.

703
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,350
Some don't want that to happen.

704
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,830
Why are you taking the blame
for the case?

705
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,710
The will of the president..

706
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,630
The President of the Republic

707
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,750
he would announce himself as the next
great imam if he could.

708
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,070
Zizo was your informant, wasn't he?

709
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,510
It wasn't an accident.

710
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,990
On Judgment Day

711
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:31,390
the killer will carry his victim
on his back forever.

712
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,990
19TH INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC FORUM

713
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,550
We follow the procedure.

714
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,670
We are not in a hurry.

715
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,790
Can you tell us if Sheikh Negm
is still alive?

716
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,750
Internet rumors claim that
State Security arrested him,

717
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:12,510
to prevent him from becoming
the next great imam.

718
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,630
Only rumours!

719
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,910
This is a religious conference.

720
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,030
Religious conference!

721
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,430
Rumors have no place here.

722
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,590
What is your question?

723
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,870
I have a question about secret marriage.

724
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,510
Ask your question.

725
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,110
If a young woman

726
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,590
let's call it Rome

727
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,870
has a child from a married man

728
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,350
with an impeccable reputation

729
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:05,070
my question is, can we have trust

730
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:09,710
of a man who has a secret marriage

731
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,750
and also a child

732
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,230
that his legal family doesn't know about?

733
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,670
What Islam says

734
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,830
for such a person?

735
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,270
Excellent question.

736
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:46,030
Who on the Council wants to answer him?

737
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:53,870
Sheikh Durrani?

738
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,230
Will you answer?

739
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:11,990
Okay.

740
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,110
Sheikh Abdel Kader

741
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,630
has written extensively
on the clandestine marriage.

742
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,750
Thank you, Sheikh.

743
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,310
It depends on the circumstances.

744
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,150
A little while ago

745
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:37,590
Did the girl's guardian approve
of the marriage?

746
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,150
Yes.

747
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,030
does the man have the resources

748
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,590
to get married

749
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,590
in some other way?

750
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,790
Third

751
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,950
did they get married

752
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,870
before or after

753
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:01,230
the conception of the child?

754
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,270
Some people

755
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,750
in the parliament they want..

756
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,550
Al-Sheikh Omar Al-Beblawi.

757
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,590
Al-Sheikh Omar Al-Beblawi.

758
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,870
Blessed be the presidency.

759
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,430
Thank God!

760
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:44,150
It's not really about me.

761
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,230
This goes much further.

762
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:54,910
The main thing is that religion
and the state work side by side.

763
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,750
What is good for Al-Azhar
is good for the state.

764
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,150
And vice versa.

765
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:07,830
Holy water from Zamzam. May we drink
it together in Mecca.

766
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:13,550
I see a very bright future for you.

767
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,190
Come in.

768
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:28,830
Leave this.

769
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,550
Major General Sobhi, head
of State Security, greeted.

770
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,670
Adam is a model of the ideal student.

771
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,510
I'm trying, sir.

772
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,590
I will unpack the books after your meeting.

773
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,190
No, no.

774
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:53,150
No more unpacking books.
Another student will do it.

775
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:57,870
You will stand behind me
at the prayer on Friday.

776
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,270
Did you understand?

777
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,190
Yes, thanks.

778
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,790
Adam, have we met before?

779
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,550
God created 40 doppelgÃ¤ngers
of everyone, sir.

780
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,990
At the moment

781
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,870
anywhere on the Internet

782
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,750
there are calls for demonstrations
against the government

783
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,830
for greater freedom.

784
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,070
My take on this is,

785
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,670
that the civil war

786
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,190
is something more serious than murder.

787
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,950
Please, sir.

788
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,670
There is no need.

789
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:59,110
Greetings, sir.

790
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,390
The president is very pleased.
- Thank goodness.

791
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,870
What is this?
- The report, sir.

792
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,830
No, it won't work like that.

793
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,750
The blind sheikh cannot be the murderer.

794
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:23,070
He is blind!
- But he admitted.

795
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:26,350
What does he want?
- I'm not sure.

796
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,070
Shouldn't we notify the general?

797
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,590
No, it's not something important.

798
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,950
Is there anything else? -Yes.

799
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,310
Your "angel"

800
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:43,350
We don't need it anymore. Get rid of him.

801
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,830
Sir, that's a bit too much.

802
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,110
Too much?

803
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,910
You know very well

804
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,270
that we don't like unfinished business.

805
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,230
Get him to admit that he killed Zizo.

806
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,150
Then we will hang him.

807
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,550
Bring it.

808
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,990
Where is your mother? - Sleep.

809
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,390
Did you do your homework?

810
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,910
What are we going to eat when she sleeps?

811
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,750
You accomplished your mission perfectly.

812
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,270
I have come to arrest you.

813
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,430
Will I see my family again?

814
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,030
I can't believe it.

815
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,590
We do not decide our destiny.

816
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,190
God chose you.

817
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,870
You chose me.

818
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,510
Let the university go.

819
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,910
Only 3 weeks of classes left.

820
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,190
Go home.

821
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,110
And forget you ever met me.

822
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,630
Major General Sobhi?

823
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,990
Sorry to bother you so late.

824
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:18,230
My informant disappeared.

825
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:19,990
I assure you it is.

826
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,750
I only know his first name
- Raed.

827
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:32,070
I know it's amazing

828
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:35,150
but so it happened, sir.

829
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:40,830
Of course, sir.

830
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,110
Very good. Goodbye.

831
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,750
'Sardine, can we meet? Raed"

832
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,190
See you in the evening.

833
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,270
Good evening.

834
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:06,510
Don't be afraid.

835
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,750
Let's not complicate this.

836
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,310
You killed Zizo.

837
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,390
Clear?

838
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,150
Some think.

839
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:14,190
That they can be silent.

840
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,350
We pull out their nails.

841
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:37,670
But they still don't talk.

842
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,710
Do you know when they talk?

843
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,870
When we bring their fathers...

844
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:58,670
to watch the torture.

845
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,510
An ugly sight!

846
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,070
Open it

847
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,310
Is your father at home?

848
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,150
Father!

849
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,950
What's up?

850
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,230
Someone has come to talk to you.

851
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:41,030
Which one?
- I do not know.

852
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:44,430
Get inside

853
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,910
What's up, Osman?
- You must come with us.

854
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,350
It's a little late.

855
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:02,950
Okay, enter.

856
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:07,670
Should I bring food?

857
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:09,990
No, there is no need.

858
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:24,830
I found it.

859
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,550
Your "angel"

860
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:34,310
Calm down.

861
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:37,150
Only a hair falls from his head,
and I will kill you!

862
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,590
He is still alive.

863
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,030
Damn you!

864
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,030
Lord, forgive me.

865
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,710
Damn you, Sobhi!

866
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:51,950
I don't understand.

867
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,070
Why do you care about him?

868
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,670
We still need him.

869
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,430
For what?

870
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:00,790
Is nothing.

871
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,590
You sent your men to kill Zizo!

872
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,910
Why?

873
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,070
He was compromised. There should be
no connection between us.

874
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:11,870
Why wasn't I notified?

875
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,950
For your own good, fool!

876
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:18,630
The Blind Sheikh knows that Zizo
was my informant!

877
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,550
He also knows that we killed him!

878
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:25,030
He confessed to the crime to convict us!

879
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:29,230
We will kill him too.

880
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,110
The Blind Sheikh?

881
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,270
Are you crazy?

882
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,990
You need permission from the general.

883
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,590
What the hell am I doing here?

884
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,590
Sir, we killed Zizo Albizri.

885
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,750
Sir, I tried to tell him...
- Shut your mouth!

886
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:39,310
Sir, I know this is a politically
sensitive decision.

887
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,670
But the Blind Sheikh forced
us to arrest him

888
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,430
for the murder of Zizo.

889
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,270
Did he force us?

890
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:52,390
And where is he now?

891
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:53,590
Knock, sir.

892
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,190
In the building?

893
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:59,150
May God have mercy on us all!

894
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:05,030
What if he's gone? Forever!

895
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:11,150
You want me to become an accomplice
to murder

896
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:14,430
of one of the country's greatest
religious leaders?

897
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:16,350
No, sir.

898
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:19,390
Sir...

899
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:23,830
The boy helped us choose a great imam.

900
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:27,710
It could convince the Blind Sheikh
to retract his confession.

901
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,750
And we will write it as an accident.

902
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:50,590
Please let us.

903
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:07,590
Sit down.

904
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:18,670
Do you know that the Blind Sheikh?

905
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,030
did he confess to the murder
of the foreign student?

906
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,630
He didn't do it.

907
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:31,430
State security killed him, sir.

908
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:38,190
He was their informant,
but he wanted to leave.

909
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,750
But why the Blind Sheikh

910
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:50,510
to confess to a crime he did not commit?

911
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:54,910
To tell the process the truth
to the whole world.

912
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:07,990
He could turn to the media.

913
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:12,150
But he knows who controls the media.

914
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:30,270
Could the son of a fisherman

915
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:33,270
make him change his mind?

916
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:37,670
Could try sir.

917
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:41,270
Why should he do it?

918
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,390
Al-Azhar and the state should
never be in conflict.

919
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,670
This could lead to civil war.

920
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,950
I need your advice Sheikh.

921
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,630
They made me confess to killing Zizo.

922
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:42,070
And I will be hanged for it.

923
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,750
A true believer is not afraid of death.

924
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,750
I know that.

925
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:52,670
I am a believer.

926
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,590
But I'm afraid.

927
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:58,070
I'm afraid for my father.

928
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,950
He will lose his son.

929
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,510
My brothers will lose me like
we lost my mother.

930
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:09,230
If your faith is strong

931
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:15,070
and your heart is pure, one day
you will meet her in heaven.

932
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:22,190
And if you confess to a murder
you didn't commit?

933
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:26,110
Are you going to heaven?

934
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:33,590
If the intention is to reveal the truth,

935
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,190
the intention is good.

936
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,590
I thought that God created us
to fulfill his wishes.

937
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:00,590
Not to change them.

938
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,110
I run from the destiny given to me
by God to fulfill his wishes.

939
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:32,110
When Omar Ibn Al Khattab was told
that the Prophet Muhammad had died,

940
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:34,070
he drew his sword.

941
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:39,390
I will kill anyone who says Muhammad
is dead!"

942
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:00,110
But Abu Bakr replied: Whoever
bows to Muhammad

943
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:02,790
he knows that Muhammad is dead.

944
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:07,950
He who worships God knows
that God is immortal.

945
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,630
Who exactly are you?

946
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,630
I am your student.

947
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,670
You are no longer a student.

948
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:35,350
You don't need anyone to teach you
your religion.

949
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:49,150
Tell the people outside

950
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:51,670
that I withdraw my confession.

951
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,990
Power is a double-edged sword.

952
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:25,870
He can easily cut your hand.

953
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:32,550
Welcome home.
- How are you?

954
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,030
I'm fine. What's new?

955
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,030
Hello, Dad.
- Welcome home, son.

956
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:40,790
I wish your mother was here to see you!

957
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:25,150
You're back!

958
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,790
Congratulations.

959
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,030
Welcome home.

960
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,270
Glory be to God.

961
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,670
Glory be to God..

962
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,110
What did you learn?
