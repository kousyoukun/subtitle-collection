1
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,083
Wow.

2
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:07,212
I can't believe
we're already saying goodbye.

3
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:11,591
It's been great getting to know you,
Pee-wee Herman.

4
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:15,178
Earth sure is a great planet.

5
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:19,432
Your art, music, pizza.

6
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:23,395
You sure took to our customs fast.

7
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,731
Thanks for showing them to me.

8
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,651
I've loved these last two weeks.

9
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:32,571
- I wish I didn't have to go.

10
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:34,990
Me, too.

11
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:38,952
Come with me, back to my planet.

12
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,038
Meet my family and friends.

13
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,874
Live with me.

14
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,291
I can't.

15
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,545
I need to stay here
with the people of Earth.

16
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm going to miss my new best friend.

17
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:56,261
I'll never forget you, Pee-wee.

18
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:59,389
I'll always remember you, too, Yul.

19
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,767
Look.

20
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,019
I made us both friendship bracelets.

21
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:09,566
Pee-wee, they're beautiful.

22
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,484
Let's put them on.

23
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,748
I guess this is...

24
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,626
arrivederci then, right?

25
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,252
Right.

26
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:33,214
Arrivederci, Pee-wee Herman.

27
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:36,051
Arrivederci, Yul.

28
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:59,074
I want to go, but I can't leave home!

29
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,577
I can't leave home!
I can't leave home!

30
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:05,831
I want to go, but I can't leave home!

31
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:08,291
- I can't leave home! I can't leave home!

32
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,626
- I can't leave home.

33
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,338
I can't leave home!
I can't leave home!

34
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,716
Morning!

35
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,602
Ooh!

36
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,565
Ooh!

37
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:14,983
Apple-y!

38
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,361
-Good morning, Pee-wee!
-Morning, Mr. Murgatroyd!

39
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:24,243
- Pee-wee!
- Hi, kids!

40
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,171
Ooh! Ooh!

41
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:56,108
Hello!

42
00:05:58,735 --> 00:05:59,945
Breakfast bar!

43
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:02,447
Scone, French toast, American toast...

44
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:08,078
Green grapes, sausages,
bacon, cinnamon toast!

45
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,831
Buh-bye!

46
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,221
Good morning, Pee-wee!

47
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:32,852
Good morning, Mrs. Rose!

48
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,938
Oh, look at you.

49
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:37,523
You're cute as a peanut!

50
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,484
- Ow!

51
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,071
Have you heard about
those new corduroy pillows?

52
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:45,615
- Corduroy pillows? No.

53
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:48,201
I'm surprised,
'cause they're making head lines!

54
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,371
Get it? "Head lines!"

55
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,872
Oh!

56
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,001
-Hold on. Hey, Ruby!
-Morning, Pee-wee.

57
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:58,962
-Last stop, Nana's Yarn Barn!
-Oh!

58
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:08,554
You're the sweetest boy in Fairville,
Pee-wee.

59
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:12,184
-Me?
-Is there anything sweeter than you?

60
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:15,145
Uh... a Root Beer Barrel?

61
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:18,273
- That's right!

62
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:21,193
I know they're in here somewhere.

63
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,904
There it is.

64
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:27,157
No.
What was I looking for?

65
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,826
Oh...

66
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:34,664
Root Beer Barrels are my favorite!

67
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,917
Boop!

68
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,009
Ah!

69
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:49,929
Well, listen, you seem really busy.
Let me let you let me run.

70
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:52,432
-Bye, Mrs. Rose!
-Bye-bye, Pee-wee.

71
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,812
-Pee-wee!
-Yo, Billy!

72
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:01,524
-Hey, Pee-wee!
-Hey, Ben!

73
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:05,486
-Morning, Pee-wee!
-Kevin!

74
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,947
--Pee-wee!

75
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,574
I'm so glad I bumped into you.

76
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,910
I've got an amazing deal
I want to tell you about.

77
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,578
You're gonna have to tell me later,
Marvin.

78
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,996
I'm on my way to work.

79
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,333
Just a moment of your time.
Come on, Pee-wee.

80
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:23,129
Tell me, Pee-wee, where do you
picture yourself on vacation?

81
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:24,714
Mexico?

82
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:26,132
Or Morocco?

83
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:27,800
Mexico?

84
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:29,677
Morocco?

85
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:32,805
What is this?
A travel agency or a millinery?

86
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:36,142
Sorry, Marvin, I'm not interested.

87
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,352
Come on, Pee-wee.

88
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:38,853
Don't you ever wonder

89
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:41,647
-what life is like outside Fairville?
-Nope!

90
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:46,319
Marvin, you know I don't want
to go anywhere or try anything new.

91
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:47,487
Bye!

92
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:06,881
Phew!

93
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:12,095
Emily, you scared me there for a moment.

94
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,597
I know I have overdue books.

95
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,557
I'm gonna return them soon, I promise.

96
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,144
-I don't care about silly overdue books.
-Oh?

97
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:22,230
But I do have something special
I wanted to give to you.

98
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,066
Hmm.

99
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,321
The new Scuba Cop?

100
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:30,863
The Emerald Sharks?

101
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:33,616
And the sharks are hammerheads?

102
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,619
These are the exact type of sharks
that Scuba Cop hates the most!

103
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:40,332
I haven't received your RSVP
for the Book Club tomorrow night.

104
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:42,375
I was thinking that, maybe afterwards,
you and I might--

105
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,295
Whoa, whoa!
Emily, let me stop you right there.

106
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,005
The fact is...

107
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,424
I neglected to RSVP my regrets.

108
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:51,801
I have rehearsal that night. NA.

109
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,471
-NA?
-Not available.

110
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:55,555
- Sorry.

111
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,390
Well, what time is your rehearsal?

112
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,100
Oh, uh, TBD.

113
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:01,727
-TBD?
-To be decided.

114
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,940
LATT, Em. IHTBG.

115
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:09,944
- What?
- LATT, IHTBG.

116
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:11,488
-IHT--
-"Look at the time."

117
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,573
"I have to be going."

118
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,616
You understand.

119
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,081
Yay! Work time!

120
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:32,509
Two eggs, fried, extra hash browns,
side of sausage. Enjoy!

121
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:35,387
Looks fantastic as always, Beverly.

122
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,474
Dan's Diner.
Dan speaking.

123
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:51,611
- French toast is up, Bev!

124
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,739
Denver omelet.
Easy on the cheese.

125
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,534
Easy on the cheese-y, coming right up-y!

126
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:01,829
Boop.

127
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:07,293
Dudley! Sylvester! Clovis!
What are you guys doing here?

128
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:10,088
Pee-wee, we need to talk to you
about band rehearsal.

129
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:13,758
Well, it is unusual to be discussing
Renegades business at my workplace,

130
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,009
but, sure, what's up?

131
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:18,638
My promotion at the grocery store means
I'm gonna be working a lot more hours.

132
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,139
Nights.

133
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:23,851
Yeah, and my girlfriend's making me take
ballroom dancing with her

134
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:25,562
four times a week.

135
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:26,729
Nights.

136
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:30,275
My office just pressured me into joining
their nighttime bowling league.

137
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:31,401
Nights.

138
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:33,986
But the Renegades rehearse at night.

139
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,156
Hello? How's that gonna work
if all you guys are so busy at night?

140
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,408
It's not.

141
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:40,452
The Renegades are breaking up.

142
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,495
What?

143
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,831
-No!
-Things are changing.

144
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:48,460
None of us have enough time
to be in a band anymore.

145
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:49,544
I do!

146
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:51,421
That's because you're stuck in a rut,
Pee-wee.

147
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,047
We want to move on to other things.

148
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:55,007
What am I supposed to move on to?

149
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:57,009
What am I supposed to do
with my flutophone?

150
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,928
Why don't you think about a solo career?

151
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,721
Why don't you?

152
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,400
Good luck, you guys.

153
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:17,280
Good luck with all your stupid, important
reasons for breaking up the Renegades!

154
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,598
-Nice seeing you, Dan.
-Bye, Dan!

155
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:48,102
Pee-wee, I gotta say,
your French toast is perfection!

156
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:49,312
Thanks.

157
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:53,232
Same with your pancakes, Herman.
They drive me crazy!

158
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:55,443
Not that long a drive, Ernie, but thanks.

159
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,945
I'm taking this biscuit with me.

160
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:59,030
I love it.

161
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,699
- Why don't you marry it?

162
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,327
Listen, you guys, you seem really busy.
Let me let you let me run, okay?

163
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,828
All right? Buh-bye!

164
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:06,996
-Thanks for coming.
-Later!

165
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,540
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

166
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:12,001
Hey, sport, can you watch over the diner?

167
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,295
I gotta go meet a couple pals
at the lodge.

168
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,632
Sure, Dan. I'll be right here.
Where else would I go?

169
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:20,259
Gonna be right here.
Just like always.

170
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,762
Have fun with your pals!

171
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,889
Attaboy!

172
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:01,426
Sharks pulling off a jewel heist?

173
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:02,802
It could happen,

174
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:06,097
but not if Scuba Cop happens to be
swimming around!

175
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,200
Cool.

176
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:30,871
Double cool.

177
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:36,628
Triple cool.

178
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:42,341
Uh, hi! What can I get you?

179
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:44,761
-Milkshake, please.
-Flavor?

180
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,555
Let's say chocolate.

181
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,265
Sure. Three, two, one.

182
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,851
- Chocolate.

183
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,492
Boop!

184
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:11,245
Ooh!

185
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:19,211
Ooh!

186
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:26,302
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

187
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,220
La!

188
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,426
Boop! Think fast!

189
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,979
Wow!

190
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,023
Thanks, appreciate that.

191
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,194
Mmm.

192
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,115
Mmm!

193
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,159
Mmm!

194
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:38,791
Wow, man!

195
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,877
This milkshake is outrageous.

196
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,879
- I really mean it.
- Probably...

197
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:44,296
top five, all-time.

198
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,841
Thanks, my specialty.

199
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,968
You know what would go great
with a milkshake of this caliber?

200
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,261
A Root Beer Barrel!

201
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,599
Only the best candy in the world!

202
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:55,725
It really is!

203
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:57,184
Distant second?

204
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:59,854
Charleston Chew. Third?

205
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:01,564
Tie between two candies.

206
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:02,690
Rolos and Skittles!

207
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:03,900
Shut up!

208
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:05,484
Shut up!

209
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:07,027
Shut up.

210
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,742
Well, all right,
Mr. Master Milkshake Maker,

211
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,744
what do you say you show me around
this little burg of yours?

212
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:18,205
Me? A tour of Fairville?
I'd love to!

213
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,959
Oh, I can't.
I gotta watch over the diner.

214
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,252
-I promised Dan and Beverly--
-"Promised Dan and Beverly"?

215
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:26,005
Will you listen to yourself?
You sound like a little baby.

216
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,048
We'll only be gone ten minutes.

217
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,676
Chillax, man.
Live a little.

218
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,261
What?

219
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:35,514
Live a little.

220
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,601
Live a little.

221
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,865
I have kind of limited experience
on a motorcycle.

222
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:54,241
Shh!

223
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,912
-You hear that?
-What?

224
00:17:57,996 --> 00:18:01,332
It's the old highway callin'.
Get on.

225
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,063
- Wicked-awesome view, dude!

226
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:27,358
-And it's right in your backyard.
-I'm glad you like it.

227
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:31,195
It roughly corresponds
to the model scale HO-187.

228
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,155
Wow, this is a whole new world for me.

229
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,074
A miniature world!

230
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,661
A miniature world.

231
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,998
I mean, look at the detail.
It's breathtaking.

232
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,875
You got a real gift, man.

233
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,001
Thank you.

234
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:47,712
Hey, how about that tour of Fairville?

235
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:52,257
Right over there, that's Dan's Diner,
where we met.

236
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,427
And there, Fairville Public Library.

237
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,096
Fairville High.

238
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,098
Tire Repair of Fairville.

239
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,892
Fairville Fire Department.

240
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,309
Barber of Fairville.

241
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:03,644
And this right here,

242
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:07,523
this little building is where Fairville's
premier music group, the Renega--

243
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:11,485
-What's wrong? What's that building?
-Nothing.

244
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,821
It's just some stupid building

245
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:17,282
where my stupid band used to rehearse
before we broke up!

246
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:18,951
Let me get that right out of there.

247
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,788
Stupid! Stupid!

248
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,671
You okay?

249
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:33,091
Yeah, sure. I'm fine.

250
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,843
Hey! What's that?

251
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:38,888
Is that your house?

252
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,640
I didn't notice you had a tree house.

253
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:42,725
Oh, I don't.

254
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:45,853
That's the only detail
of this entire model that doesn't exist...

255
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:46,896
yet.

256
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,522
--That's funny.

257
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:50,524
You know, I always wanted
a tree house, too.

258
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,317
That is funny!

259
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:56,114
Say...

260
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,742
What do you say you and me
get a picture of us

261
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,619
at the site of your future tree house?

262
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,039
You ready?
Three, two, one.

263
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:06,791
- Root Beer Barrels!

264
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,211
You know, I never caught your name.

265
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:14,673
Oh, it's Pee-wee. Pee-wee Herman.
And you are?

266
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:16,759
Good one.

267
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:18,886
Uh... what?

268
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,973
Wait...

269
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,182
you don't know who I am?

270
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,309
How could I?
Why would I?

271
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,145
I'm Joe...

272
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,312
Manganiello.

273
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,898
Well, pleasure to meet you,
Joe Man...

274
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:32,650
Manganiello.

275
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,276
Sorry, trick ear.
One more time.

276
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,569
Manganiello.

277
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,781
I'm an actor.

278
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,533
I'm told show business
can be very competitive,

279
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:44,536
so hang on to your dreams
and who knows?

280
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,413
I wish you luck, Joe Man...

281
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:49,458
-Certainly you've heard of True Blood?
-Uh-uh.

282
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,962
-Magic Mike?
-Hmm, you'd think so, but no.

283
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,964
Man, you're so real.

284
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,924
That's what I like about you, Pee-wee.
You're normal.

285
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,845
Your miniature world is awesome.

286
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,516
Hey, what's on the other side
of those railroad tracks?

287
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,976
Beyond Fairville?

288
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,145
I don't know, I've never been there.

289
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:10,188
Never?

290
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:13,983
May I tell you something
I've never told anyone?

291
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,527
Sure.

292
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,653
What is it?

293
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,280
Once upon a time, I won a contest.

294
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,075
A trip to Salt Lake City, Utah.

295
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:27,412
- But I never made it to Salt Lake City.

296
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,456
- Or Utah.

297
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,126
- Long story short...

298
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,628
I came back with a metal plate in my head.

299
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:39,967
That explains why you don't travel.
Hmm...

300
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:43,387
Do you ever get worried
that life's just passing you by?

301
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,763
Ha!

302
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:48,350
What could possibly be going on out there
that I haven't tried already in Fairville?

303
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,728
-You ever been in a fight?
-No.

304
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,605
-You ever broken a rule?
-No!

305
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,107
You ever had two women fight over you?

306
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:56,358
Uh...

307
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,902
Have I? No.

308
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,489
Breaking rules and breaking hearts,
that's what life's all about.

309
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,075
I believe in fate.

310
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,784
And I think I know why you and I met.

311
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,455
You're gonna leave Fairville...

312
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,875
and you're gonna take a holiday.

313
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,877
I got your reason right here.

314
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,171
What is it? What?

315
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,886
I want you to be at my birthday party.

316
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,056
New York City!

317
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,348
How would I ever...

318
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,102
I couldn't possibly...

319
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,187
This is all happening so fast.

320
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:34,980
See you in five days, brother.

321
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:37,524
"Five days"?
"Brother"?

322
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,194
-I've never even been on an airplane.
-No!

323
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:42,362
The only thing you're gonna
learn about yourself on a plane

324
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:46,117
is that you like the honey-roasted peanuts
better than the plain-salted.

325
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,535
If you're really hungry,

326
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:51,289
the open road is a smorgasbord
of life experience.

327
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:56,294
A few days on the open road
is worth a lifetime in Fairville.

328
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,962
The way I see it, Pee-wee Herman,

329
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,672
you got a choice to make.

330
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,424
Stick around here...

331
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,346
...or live a little.

332
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,021
Stick around here...

333
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:17,564
or live a little.

334
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:19,942
What should I do?

335
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:22,903
I wish I had some kind of sign.

336
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,200
Whoa, that's a big apple.

337
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:30,577
Big Apple!

338
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:32,454
That's it! Bingo!

339
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,916
-Can I get anybody more water?
-Where's my order?

340
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,417
Where's the food?

341
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,669
I'm starving!

342
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,339
Bev, my lunch break is practically over!

343
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,799
- Me hungry!

344
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,594
Shoot! Heck! Darn!

345
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,391
Pee-wee, where have you been?

346
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:54,352
I'm leaving town.

347
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:59,190
I won't be at work tomorrow
or the next day or the day after that.

348
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,776
I'm taking a holiday.

349
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:29,761
Come on, Little Connie.
We're going to New York City!

A traffic light!

365
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,194
Just like I've seen in
National Geographic!

366
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:35,911
I hope I'm not tempting fate
by saying this out loud,

367
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:40,458
but my very first holiday
is off to a perfect start!

368
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:48,048
Uh-oh, those nice women are in trouble!

369
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,346
Hitchhikers!
Hop in!

370
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,515
Where you headed?

371
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,477
-Hello--
-Drive, pip-squeak.

372
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,644
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

373
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,230
Time is of the essence, Daddy-o.
Put the pedal to the metal!

374
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:04,773
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my--
Ow!

375
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:06,317
Floor it, worm!

376
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:11,196
- Hey!

377
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,031
Watch where you're going, maniac!

378
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:17,536
Why are the cops after us?
Are you guys witches?

379
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,456
Never ask a wimp to do a lady's job.

380
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:22,541
-Ooh!
-Faster, granny!

381
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,838
Please, don't make me
wreck Little Connie!

382
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,552
This is one moving violation
after another!

383
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:40,309
Ladies, hold on to your switchblades!

384
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,574
Congrats, twerp.
You're a criminal.

385
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,191
We just fed you.

386
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:33,237
Listen, ladies, it's been real
and it's been fun.

387
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,240
But has it been real fun? Mmm-mmm.

388
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:37,449
Nope.

389
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,868
Come on, let me go.

390
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:42,746
I gotta get to New York City,
to my friend's birthday party.

391
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,251
I don't care if your friend
is the Queen of England

392
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:50,212
and she's throwing her
100th birthday party

393
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:53,173
in the Statue of Liberty's underpants!

394
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:57,094
You're not leaving this motel room.

395
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:00,180
Hey, Pepper.

396
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,057
He seems okay.

397
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,352
Maybe we can trust him.

398
00:28:05,436 --> 00:28:07,729
No way!
He'll go and squeal to the cops.

399
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,524
-But I--
-Pipe down, squirrel!

400
00:28:10,608 --> 00:28:13,527
My name's not Squirrel.
It's Pee-wee.
