- He's down in Texas somewhere.

- He's a...

He'll probably make trouble.

But that's no concern of yours,
not anymore.

128

That's finished now.
They've got a new marshal.

131

He won't be here till tomorrow.
Seems to me I've got to stay.

132
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,755
Anyway, I'm the same man,
with or without this.

133
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,313
Well, that isn't so.

134
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,078
I expect he'll come looking for me.

135
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,156
Three of his old bunch are waiting
at the depot.

136
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,157
That's exactly why we ought to go.

137
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,840
They'll just come after us. Four of them.

138
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,436
And we'd be all alone on the prairie.

139

140

- Well, we could...

141
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,833
What's 100 miles? We'd never be able
to keep that store, Amy.

142
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,520
They'd come after us and we'd have to
run again as long as we live.

143
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,871
No, we wouldn't.
Not if they didn't know where to find us.

Will, I'm begging you, please let's go.

145
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,869
I can't.

146
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,117
Don't try to be a hero.
You don't have to be a hero. Not for me.

147
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,358
I'm not trying to be a hero.
If you think I like this, you're crazy.

148
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,279
Look, Amy, this is my town.
I've got friends here.

149
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,158
I'll swear in a bunch of special deputies

150
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,748
and with a posse behind me,
maybe there won't even be any trouble.

151
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,078
- You know there'll be trouble.
- Then it's better to have it here.

152
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,434
I'm sorry, honey.
I know how you feel about it.

153
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,959
Do you?

154
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,833
Of course I do.
I know it's against your religion and all.

155
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,715
- Sure I know how you feel.
- But you're doing it just the same.

156
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,879
Oh, Will, we were married
just a few minutes ago.

157
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,035
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

158
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,672
You know I've only got an hour
and I've got lots to do.

159
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,470
Stay at the hotel until it's over.

160
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,034
You're asking me to wait an hour

161
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,718
You're asking me to wait an hour

162
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,717
to find out if I'm going to be
a wife or a widow.

163
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,149
I say it's too long to wait. I won't do it.

164
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,235
Amy!

165
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,353
I mean it, if you won't go with me now,
I'll be on that train when it leaves here.

166
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,557
I've got to stay.

167
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,831
- Glad you got here, Perce.
- Are you?

168
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,516
Have you forgotten that I'm the man
who passed sentence on Frank Miller?

169
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,594
You shouldn't have come back, Will.
It was stupid.

170
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,110
I figured I had to. I figured I had to stay.

171
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,713
You figured wrong.

172
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,479
I can deputise a posse.
Ten, 12 guns is all I need.

173
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,830
Yeah, my intuition tells me otherwise.

174
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,355
Why?

175
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,838
No time for a lesson in civics, my boy.

176
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,669
In the fifth century B.C.,
the citizens of Athens,

177
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,711
having suffered grievously
under a tyrant,

178
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,319
managed to depose and banish him.

179
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,556
However, when he returned
some years later

180
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,749
with an army of mercenaries,

181
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,236
those same citizens
not only opened the gates for him,

182
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,030
but stood by while he executed
members of the legal government.

183
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,794
A similar thing happened
about eight years ago

184
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,309
in a town called Indian Falls.

185
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,236
I escaped death
only through the intercession of a lady

186
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,715
of somewhat dubious reputation,

187
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,753
and at the cost of a very handsome ring
which once belonged to my mother.

188
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,316
- Unfortunately, I have no more rings.
- You're a judge.

189
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,432
I've been a judge many times
in many towns.

190
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,155
And I hope to live to be a judge again.

191
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,913
I can't tell you what to do.

192
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,873
Why must you be so stupid, Will?
Have you forgotten what he is?

193
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,319
Have you forgotten
what he's done to people?

194
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,078
Have you forgotten that he's crazy?

195
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,191
Don't you remember
when he sat in that chair and said,

196
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,040
"You'll never hang me. I'll come back.

197
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,758
"You'll never hang me. I'll come back.

198
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,713
"I'll kill you, Will Kane.
I swear it, I'll kill you"?

199
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,030
Here you are, ma'am.
This'll take you to Saint Louis.

200
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,275
Thank you.

201
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,038
Maybe you'd rather wait
somewheres else.

202
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,673
Like at the hotel, maybe.

203
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,994
All right, thank you.

204
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,236
I'm awfully sorry
about all this, Mrs Kane.

205
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,511
But don't you worry, the marshal
will take care of himself all right.

206
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,153
Thank you very much.

207
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,836
Hey, that wasn't here five years ago.

208
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,753
So what?

209
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,599
Nothing. Yet.

210
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,109
Harvey, don't you think Kane
will be looking for you about now?

211
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,315
Yeah.

212
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,793
You're really sore at him.

213
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,519
Wouldn't you be if you were me?

214
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,551
I suppose. If I were you.

215
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,792
Be back in a little while.

216
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,788
(HARVEY WHISTLING)

217
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,558
- Bye, Will.
- Goodbye.

218
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,553
- Think I'm letting you down, don't you?
- No.

219
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,838
Look, this is just a dirty little village
in the middle of nowhere.

220
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,238
Nothing that happens here
is really important. Now get out.

221
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,233
There isn't time.

222
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,874
What a waste. Good luck.

223
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,748
Johnny.

224
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,479
- Why aren't you in church?
- Why ain't you?

225
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,713
- Look, will you do something for me?
- Sure.

226
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,717
Go find Joe Henderson,
Mart Howe and Sam Fuller

227
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,478
- and tell them I want them here.
- Right.

228
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,797
- And then find Harv Pell.
- Don't have to do that, here I am.

229
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,077
- Well, where have you been?
- Busy.

230
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,639
- You know what's doing?
- Sure.

231
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,829
Well, come on, we got lots to do.

232
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,555
Hold up a second.
This ain't really your job, you know.

233
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,113
Well, that's what everybody
keeps telling me.

234
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,959
When I tell you, it means something,
so you can just listen a second.

235
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,513
All right, I'm listening.

236
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,439
Now, this is the way I see it.

237
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,274
If you'd gone, with the new marshal
not due here till tomorrow,

238
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,072
I'd be in charge around here, right?

239
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,315
Right.

240
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,953
Well, tell me this, then,

241
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,355
if I'm good enough to hold down the job
when there's trouble,

242
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,710
how come the city fathers
didn't trust me with it permanent?

243
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,512
I don't know.

244
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,756
- Don't you?
- No.

245
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,836
That's funny, I figured
you carried a lot of weight.

246
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,029
Maybe they didn't ask me.
Maybe they figured you were too young.

247
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,673
You think I'm too young, too?

248
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,870
You sure act like it sometimes.
Come on.

249
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,232
It's very simple, Will.

250
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,952
All you gotta do is tell the old boys
when they come

251
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,399
that I'm the new marshal.

252
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,797
And tomorrow
they can tell the other fellow

253
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,876
they're sorry, but the job's filled.

254
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,560
- You really mean it, don't you?
- Sure.

255
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,353
- Well, I can't do it.
- Why not?

256
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,110
If you don't know,
it's no use me telling you.

257
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,355
You mean you won't do it.

258
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,199
Have it your way.

259
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,630
All right, the truth is you probably
talked against me from the start.

260
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,551
You've been sore about me and
Helen Ramírez right along, ain't you?

261
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,358
You and Helen Ramírez?

262
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,392
It so happens I didn't know,

263
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,476
and it doesn't mean anything to me
one way or the other.

264
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,635
You ought to know that.

265
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,751
Yeah, you been washed up
for more than a year.

266
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,677
Oh, you go out and get yourself married,

267
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,473
only you can't stand anybody
taking your place there, can you?

268
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,830
- Especially me.
- You're a...

269
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,836
I haven't got time, Harv.

270
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,428
Okay, then let's get down to business.

271
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,150
You want me to stick,
you put the word in for me like I said.

272
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,793
Sure, I want you to stick.

273
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,559
But I'm not buying it.
It's got to be up to you.

274
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,032
I thought you'd grew up by now.

275
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,714
I thought your disposition might have
sweetened up a little down in Abilene.

276
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,599
I guess we're both wrong.

277
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,599
What's so funny?

278
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,909
Did you really think
you could put that over on Kane?

279
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,995
Why not?

280
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,992
When are you going to grow up?

281
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,759
I'm getting tired of that kind of talk.

282
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,075
- Then grow up.
- Cut it out!

283
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,349
All right.

284
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,910
Why shouldn't he have gone for it?
He needs me.

285
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,792
He'll need me plenty
when Frank Miller gets here.

286
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,909
That's possible.

287
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,519
Should've had me made marshal
to begin with.

288
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,995
He's just sore, is all.
Sore about you and me.

289
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,993
- Is he?
- Sure.

290
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,836
- You told him?
- Sure.

291
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,909
You are a fool.

292
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,480
Why? Didn't you want him to know?

293
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,233
Hey, who did the walking out, anyway?
You or him?

294
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,955
Get out, Harvey.

295
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,630
- I might just do that.
- Then do it.

296
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,349
- You don't mean that?
- Try me.

297
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,189
You're gonna talk different
when Frank Miller gets here.

298
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,594
You might want somebody
around you then

299
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,438
when you try to explain to him
about Kane.

300
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,516
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

301
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,035
Only from what I've heard,

302
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,276
you might not be so pretty
when he gets through with you.

303
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,835
- I won't be back.
- Good.

Come in.

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,789
I just saw Harvey. Is everything all right?

308

00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,070
I'm gonna go in a little while,
as soon as I dress.

464
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,639
Thank you, Mrs Fuller. Goodbye.

465
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,871
Now, what do you want?
Do you want me to get killed?

466
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,195
Do you want to be a widow?
Is that what you want?

467
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,072
No, Sam, no.

468
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,115
JIMMY: Kane.

469
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,594
- What's the matter, Jimmy?
- Nothing. I've been looking for you.

470
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,190
I want a gun. I want to be with you
when that train comes in.

471
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,593
- Can you handle a gun?
- Sure I can. I used to be good.

472
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,273
- Honest.
- But why...

473
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,914
It ain't just getting even.
It's a chance, see? It's what I need.

474
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,270
Please, Kane, let me get in on this.

475
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,238
All right, Jimmy,
I'll call you if I need you.

476
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,796
Get yourself a drink meanwhile, huh?

477
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,228
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

478
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,316
Come in, Sam.

479
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,838
You're leaving town?

480
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,073
- Where are you going?
- I don't know yet.

481
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,990
That doesn't make much sense.

482
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,400
You're afraid, huh? Afraid of Miller?

483
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,989
No.

484
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,156
Sure you are,
or you wouldn't be running.

485
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,352
You got nothing to be worried about
as long as I'm around. You know that.

486
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,630
I'm not scared of Miller.
I'll take him on any time.

487
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,113
I believe you.

488
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,999
Then why are you going?

489
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,118
- You cutting out with Kane?
- Oh, Harvey.

490
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,276
- Then why are you going?
- What difference does it make?

491
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,600
It's Kane. It's Kane, I know it's Kane.

492
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,432
It isn't Kane,

493
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,597
but I'm going to tell you something
about you and your friend Kane.

494
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,039
You're a good-looking boy.

495
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,596
You have big, broad shoulders,
but he is a man.

496
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,393
It takes more than big, broad shoulders
to make a man, Harvey,

497
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,476
and you have a long way to go.

498
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,113
You know something?
I don't think you will ever make it.

499
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,710
Let me tell you something.
You're not going anywhere.

500
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,196
You're staying here with me.
It's going to be just like it was before.

501
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,956
You want to know why I'm leaving?
Then listen.

502
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,591
Kane will be a dead man in half an hour,

503
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,950
and nobody is going to do
anything about it.

504
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,073
And when he dies, this town dies, too.
I can feel it.

505
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,038
I am all alone in the world.

506
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,312
I have to make a living.
So I'm going someplace else. That's all.

507
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,436
And as for you, I don't like anybody
to put his hands on me

508
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,675
unless I want him to.

509
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,473

You don't come
to this church very often, Marshal.

518
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,677
And when you got married today,
you didn't see fit to be married here.

519
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,594
What could be so important
to bring you here now?

It's true, I haven't been
a church-going man.

523
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,798
And maybe that's a bad thing.

524
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,230
And I didn't get married here today
because my wife's a Quaker.

525
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,509
But I came here for help
because there are people here.

526

I'm sorry, Marshal.

Say what you have to say.

that Kane ain't no longer marshal?

Why didn't you arrest them, Marshal?

Why didn't you put them in jail
where they ought to be?

Then we'd only have Miller to worry
about instead of the four of them.

Don't you remember when this wasn't
a fit place to bring up a child?

How can you sit here
and talk and talk and talk like this?

What are we all getting
so excited about?

591
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,400
How do we know
Miller's on that train, anyway?

592
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,035
Well, we can be pretty sure he's on it.

Time's getting short.

594
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,233
Parson, you got anything to say?

595
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,478
I don't know. The Commandments say,
"Thou shalt not kill."

596
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,034
But we hire men to go out
and do it for us.

597
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,039
The right and the wrong
seem pretty clear here.

598
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,478
But if you're asking me to tell my people
to go out and kill

599
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,556
and maybe get themselves killed,

600
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,873
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

601
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,276
All right. I'll say this,

602
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,153
what this town owes Will Kane here,
it can never pay with money.

603
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,872
And don't ever forget it.

604
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,035
He's the best marshal we ever had,
maybe the best marshal we'll ever have.

605
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,631
So if Miller comes back here today,
it's our problem, not his.

606
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,918
It's our problem
because this is our town.

607
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,315
We made it with our own hands
out of nothing.

608
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,715
And if we want to keep it decent,
keep it growing,

609
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,717
we've got to think mighty clear
here today.

610
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,434
And we've got to have the courage
to do what we think is right,

611
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,472
no matter how hard it is. All right.

612
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,118
There's gonna be fighting
when Kane and Miller meet.

613
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,074
And somebody's going to get hurt,
that's for sure. Now,

614
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,558
people up north
are thinking about this town.

615
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,877
Thinking mighty hard, thinking about
sending money down here

616
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,355
to put up stores and to build factories.

617
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,757
It'll mean a lot to this town. An awful lot.

618
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,749
But if they're gonna read about
shooting and killing in the streets,

619
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,791
what are they gonna think then?

620
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,590
I'll tell you. They're gonna think
this is just another wide-open town,

621
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,678
and everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

622
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,237
In one day,
this town will be set back five years.

623
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,994
And I don't think we can let that happen.

624
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,357
Mind you, you all know
how I feel about this man.

625
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,229
He's a mighty brave man. A good man.

626
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,149
He didn't have to come back here today.

627
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,195
And for his sake and the sake
of this town, I wish he hadn't.

628
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,950
Because if he's not here
when Miller comes,

629
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,992
my hunch is there won't be any trouble.
Not one bit.

630
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,758
Tomorrow we'll have a new marshal,

631
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,872
and if we can all agree here
to offer him our services,

632
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,753
I think we can handle anything
that comes along.

633
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,158
Now, to me, that makes sense.

634
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,075
To me, that's the only way out of this.

635
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,433
Will, I think you better go
while there's still time.

636
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,158
It's better for you, and it's better for us.

Will and I were married an hour ago.

and he wouldn't go.

I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,
I just couldn't reach him.

- And now?
- Well, that man downstairs, the clerk,

why he wouldn't go with me,

is that it's got to be because of you.

01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,076
Why, sure, Marshal. Sure, sure.
Sit down.

766
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,156
Run into some kind of trouble, Marshal?

767
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,872
No, no trouble.

(HAMMERING)

769
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,391
- What are you building?
- Oh, just fixing things up out back.

770
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,512
Now take it easy, Mr Kane.
Just settle back. That's it.

771
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,949
- Fred, Fred, hold it a while, will you?
- Hold it?

772
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,672
You just stop till I tell you to start again.

773
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,230
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Marshal.

774
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,669
No charge...

775
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,519
You can tell your man
he can go back to work now.

776
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,555
Will!

777
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,070
I guess I forgot about you, Herb.
I'm sure glad you're here.

778
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,031
I couldn't figure out
what was keeping you.

779
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,469
- Time's getting pretty short.
- Sure is.

780
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,751
When are the other boys gonna
get here? We got to make plans.

781
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,474
The other boys?
There aren't any other boys, Herb.

782
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,875
- It's just you and me.
- You're joking.

783
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,356
No, I couldn't get anybody.

784
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,152
I don't believe it.
This town ain't that low.

785
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,078
I couldn't get anybody.

786
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,160
- Then it's just you and me.
- I guess so.

787
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,113
You and me against Miller
and all the rest of them?

788
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,434
That's right. Do you want out, Herb?

789
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,594
Well, it isn't that I want out, no.

790
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,396
You see... Look, I'll tell you the truth.

791
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,796
- I didn't figure on anything like this, Will.
- Neither did I.

792
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,353
I volunteered. You know I did.

793
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,198
You didn't have to come to me.
I was ready.

794
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,437
Sure, I'm ready now.
But this is different, Will.

795
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,357
This ain't like
what you said it was gonna be.

796
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,755
This is just plain committing suicide.
And for what?

797
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,155
Why me? I'm no lawman.
I just live here.

798
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,636
I got nothing personal against nobody.
I got no stake in this.

799
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,953
I guess not.

800
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,557
There's a limit
how much you can ask a man.

801
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,069
I got a wife and kids.
What about my kids?

802
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,997
Go on home to your kids, Herb.

803
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,917
You get some of the other fellows, Will,
and I'll still go through with it.

804
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,758
Go on home, Herb.

807
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,956
I found them, Marshal,
like you wanted me to.

808
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,550
- All but Mr Henderson.
- I found him. Thanks.

809
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,113
You're welcome.

810
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,194
Marshal, listen. Let me fight with you.
I ain't afraid.

811
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,720
- No.
- Please let me, Marshal.

812
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,477
You're a kid. You're a baby.

813
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,672
I'm 16. And I can handle a gun, too.
You ought to see me.

814
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,116
You're 14.
And what do you want to lie for?

815
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,277
Well, I'm big for my age.
Please, Marshal.

816
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,834
Well, you're big for your age all right,
but, no.

817
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,235
Go on. Get out of here. Go on.

Thanks, Marshal.

823
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,152
I sure appreciate it. I certainly do.

You don't happen to know
if the saloon's open, do you, Will?

825
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,475
- I said go home, Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

- So long, Helen.
- Goodbye, Sam.

- Everything ready?
- Sure. Just the way you want it, Frank.

- Let's get started, then.
