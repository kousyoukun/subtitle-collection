1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Above the Law (1988) AKA: Nico
Marc2008 (Feb-2010), The Netherlands.

2
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:39,456
I was born in Palermo, Sicily.

3
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,187
We came to this country when I was seven.
We immigrated to Chicago.

4
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:46,899
We were always raised to be very
patriotic, to love our country.

5
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,401
And we did.

6
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,321
When I was a little boy,
my father took me to a baseball game.

7
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:56,200
They had a martial arts demonstration
and I saw this old Japanese man...

8
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:59,412
... doing things that I thought
were magical...

9
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:02,540
... and I developed a crazy dream
to go to the Far East.

10
00:01:02,623 --> 00:01:06,461
By the time I was 17, I was there,
studying with the masters.

11
00:02:56,988 --> 00:03:02,034
In 1969 I was invited by a friend of mine
to an American Embassy party in Tokyo.

12
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:07,373
While I was there, there was a crazy,
drunk guy named Nelson Fox.

13
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,667
He recruited me into the CIA.

14
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:12,044
I was 22 at the time.

15
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:14,756
My eyes were about to be opened.

16
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,962
My friends, let me make one thing clear:

17
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:57,090
This is a nation of laws.

18
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:59,342
And as Abraham Lincoln had said:

19
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:02,720
No one is above the law,
no one is below the law."

20
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:04,639
And we're going to enforce the law!

21
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:09,060
And Americans should remember that,
if we are to have law and order!

22
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,470
You ever seen
chemical interrogation before?

23
00:05:25,762 --> 00:05:27,722
These assholes are Agency?

24
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:29,974
We all get paid by the CIA.

25
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:34,061
But these guys are from a page
that ain't even in the book.

26
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:00,755
Don't die on me, you sucker!

27
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:02,757
What the hell's wrong?

28
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:06,427
This pussy, he just can't hold his liquor.

29
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:11,182
Doc, he's dead.

30
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:13,518
Get him the fuck out of here.

31
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,521
- Move it. Let's go.
- Come on!

32
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,774
- Get him out.
- Get him out of here.

33
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:34,622
So, my little doctor bag doesn't scare you?

34
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:36,874
I'm not scared.

35
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,585
You speak English.

36
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:41,462
How nice.

37
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:44,424
Where's the load, Colonel?

38
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,227
I'm gonna teach you never...

39
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,604
...never to fuck with my opium.

40
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,273
Oh, boy.

41
00:07:00,982 --> 00:07:02,859
He's a hard one, Doc.

42
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:06,946
You took it from the French,
you took it from the Chinks.

43
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,950
And you'll be damned
if a Yankee's going to start you talking.

44
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:14,829
But you're gonna sing for me.
You're gonna sing like a choir!

45
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:18,499
What does this have to do
with military intelligence?

46
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:24,505
Who the fuck is this cherry?

47
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:28,176
Your orders, Toscani,
were to assist and observe.

48
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:30,887
Just back off, partner.

49
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:40,480
I'm gonna start cutting you off
at the ankles.

50
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:47,195
Then I'm gonna take your feet
and throw them right in the basket.

51
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:48,696
Cute, huh?

52
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:50,907
Shut up, Nico.

53
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:53,785
Look, I can make you disappear.

54
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,208
Grab his leg.

55
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,628
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- Nico!

56
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:11,260
You think you're soldiers?
You're fucking barbarians!

57
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:15,098
Get out!

58
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:22,563
Get back to the LZ.

59
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:25,817
If I don't cap him now,
he's gonna do me later.

60
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,319
I'll call a chopper in
for us. I'll cover this.

61
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:30,571
Just get the hell out of here!

62
00:08:30,655 --> 00:08:31,489
Come on, move!

63
00:08:31,572 --> 00:08:33,408
Bring him back here!

64
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:38,955
Nobody move! Everybody stay
on that damn porch!

65
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:42,792
Go, Nico!

66
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:48,548
Nelson, I'm through. I'm finished!

67
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:03,438
Nicola, Sara,
what name do you give your child?

68
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:05,148
Giuliano Nicola.

69
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:08,776
Giuliano...

70
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:11,529
...you have become a new creation.

71
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:14,365
With the help of your family and friends...

72
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:17,410
...we bring your Christian dignity
unstained...

73
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:20,288
...into the everlasting life of heaven.

74
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:24,584
- Come on. You always make me late.
- I'm the boss. You have to drive me!

75
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:27,962
I'll trace the sign of the Cross
upon your forehead...

76
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:31,132
...and I invite your parents to do the same.

77
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:36,804
In the name of the Father, the Son...

78
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:39,348
...and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

79
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:43,311
Look at him. He's such a good baby.

80
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:51,861
That's beautiful.

81
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:10,421
- I know you're the boss but...
- That's right. Remember that.

82
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:11,589
Hi, guys.

83
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:13,216
Hey, how are you?

84
00:10:13,508 --> 00:10:15,426
You guys look so good!

85
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,846
We haven't done anything.
We're clean. Some of us, anyway.

86
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,600
Well, Lieutenant, eight more days
and you're gonna miss me.

87
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,935
Parts of you, anyway.

88
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:25,394
You see this cop?

89
00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:28,940
This one. This one here.
She could bust me anytime.

90
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,942
Look at that! Look at that!

91
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:33,152
- This is the partner?
- This is the partner.

92
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:35,947
I got dressed up because
you told me you were wearing a tux.

93
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,866
You look fabulous.
She goes to work looking like this?

94
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,869
This girl, sometimes she comes
in just lingerie.

95
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,541
Don't tell our secrets. She's never gonna
let you out with me again.

96
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:52,964
I told you guys to have a good time,
but take it easy, will you?

97
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:55,258
Toscani holds the record
for having more relatives...

98
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:58,553
...under federal indictment
than any other cop in the city.

99
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:00,763
Look at those stiff dicks.

100
00:11:01,222 --> 00:11:04,058
A free meal and they come out like flies.

101
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:06,436
Hey, you greaseball bastards!

102
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:08,980
Didn't we buy that monkey once?

103
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:15,319
Rosa, I'm so worried. So worried.

104
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:24,203
- What's wrong?
- Nico!

105
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:27,498
Isn't today a day you should be happy?

106
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:30,710
- What's wrong?
- It's Lucia. She's gone again.

107
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:33,755
- Is it that boy?
"- S�", Nico.

108
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,179
I have to go to work right now.
You gonna be at the bakery later?

109
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:41,804
S�.

110
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:45,850
I'll come by the bakery and we'll talk.
Maybe I can do something.

111
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:48,144
Thank you, Nico. Thank you.

112
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:54,275
Lester, this is Unit 10, Tango-X-ray.

113
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:57,195
We're up and clear. You got that?

114
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,449
Delores, Toscani told me he'll watch
over you and take care of you real good...

115
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:02,992
... your last week on the street.

116
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:05,870
Never had a friend who was a DA before.

117
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,044
I'm gonna take a piss and be right back.

118
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:14,587
- Here?
- Yeah.

119
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:25,681
She's fine, ain't she?

120
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,062
Excuse me, I just had to stop and tell you...

121
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:34,899
...you look like the sun setting
on a waterfall in the springtime.

122
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:37,985
And you got five seconds, and three are up.

123
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:40,321
You ain't got to be...

124
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:44,951
Lady cops need boyfriends, too, you dig?

125
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:47,829
But you have a nice day, just the same.

126
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,253
Nothing but trouble coming
in my place tonight.

127
00:12:55,336 --> 00:12:57,004
I know this one.

128
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:02,885
You seen this girl?

129
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,762
I ain't seen shit.

130
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:07,348
You haven't seen this girl?

131
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:10,977
Hey, Schifo, how you doing?

132
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,815
- You seen this girl?
- You know I quit messing with that stuff.

133
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:18,860
- I ain't into this shit anymore.
- What are you into?

134
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:21,195
Why don't the fuck
you assholes leave me alone?

135
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,656
- I paid your boy off Monday night.
- My boys, huh?

136
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,077
Now take some of that fucking money
and buy your mama a condominium.

137
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:32,206
I thought this was a kosher bar, man.
No pork allowed.

138
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:41,007
Say, man, you seen this girl?

139
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,886
I seen the top of her head.

140
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,016
That's good.

141
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:08,211
Stop this motherfucker.
He's crazy. Where's my piece?

142
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:13,299
He ain't nothing. Take him out.
He's motherfucking crazy.

143
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:15,635
He's a fucking Italian puke!

144
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:19,263
Freeze, motherfucker!

145
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:24,352
Come on, man. Please. Put the gun away.

146
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,866
All right. Who else wants some?

147
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,868
You're destroying the image of my place.

148
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:44,080
You'll never be the fucking man.
You'll never be the man.

149
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,707
Get over here!

150
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:48,376
Hold it, man. Don't do me ugly.

151
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,380
Listen. I know where the chick is.
She's upstairs.

152
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:55,883
- Yeah? She's upstairs?
- 2-C. I swear, man. It's 2-C.

153
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:05,893
This isn't what it looks like.

154
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:07,770
Listen, he's my cousin. He's a cop.

155
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,897
I didn't know they had all of this.

156
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:11,482
Get out of here.

157
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:15,028
You having a good time?

158
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:16,612
Pretty good time.

159
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:22,452
What is this shit? You wanna get high?

160
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:24,787
You wanna get high?

161
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:31,298
You're acting stupid, man! Stop it!

162
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:36,804
Stop. You playing the cop, I'm tired of it.

163
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:40,141
I'll show you what time is
'cause you'll do tall time.

164
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:44,061
Just take it, it's yours.
Three grand. It's in the mattress.

165
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:46,564
You want to fucking bribe me, man?

166
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,233
Put your clothes on. We're going home.

167
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,609
Stop it.

168
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:53,529
I'm tired of you. You shut up!

169
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:57,283
Don't you understand that there are people
out there who love you.

170
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:00,077
Right. Keep talking. Keep flapping.

171
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:02,663
In my business!

172
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,792
Is this your school stuff?

173
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:11,005
It's my math homework and my history.
You gonna write me another note, Nico?

174
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:12,756
Come on. We're going home.

175
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,092
No, you go home. I'm tired.

176
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:18,846
I'll give you something, something big.

177
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:19,763
Oh, yeah?

178
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:23,809
This is huge, my man.
It's a shipment coming in next Tuesday.

179
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,812
What the hell do you know
about a shipment?

180
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:29,356
This is square, on my mother's soul.

181
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,610
You gotta believe me, man.
You can't set me up.

182
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:37,198
I heard it from a hooker friend who's
banging this big coke lawyer. He told her.

183
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:38,824
- What lawyer?
- I don't know.

184
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:40,409
What do you mean you don't know?

185
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:42,912
Carlos Abandano. That's the one.

186
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:46,874
Better fucking pray to God
you ain't bullshitting me...

187
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:50,127
...or I'll come back and tear
your heart out. Let's go.

188
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,758
Who are you?

189
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:56,842
Get back!

190
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:58,511
I own this place!

191
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:01,305
I own this joint.

192
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,809
There's a guy upstairs.
I want to get him arrested!

193
00:17:07,102 --> 00:17:10,523
- That's the motherfucker right there!
- These two guys are under arrest.

194
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:13,108
It's a cesspool in there. Check it out.

195
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:17,530
Boy, you got some strange toilet habits.

196
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:19,824
I'm gonna take her home and clean her up.

197
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:23,035
I don't want to take her
to her grandmother like this.

198
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,986
Jax, I hate these cocaine lawyers.

199
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:00,156
And this shitty weather.

200
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:05,327
They're gonna have me serving time.

201
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:09,165
I wish you'd relax, hon.
This'll never get into court.

202
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:10,958
Except against us.

203
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:14,920
I don't care how
I have to get at these guys...

204
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:15,921
Let me reiterate.

205
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:20,342
You said you were going to protect
my butt and be my guardian angel.

206
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:21,927
Hang on, hang on.

207
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:25,931
There is an engine block
clearing customs...

208
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,684
...Tuesday, 10:00 pickup.

209
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:32,480
Fulton Meat Market.

210
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:36,025
An engine block?

211
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:44,116
Clever, clever, guys.

212
00:18:54,376 --> 00:18:56,504
I'd like an '86 Lincoln...

213
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:59,465
...IIlinois 354-DOG-6"7", please.

214
00:19:03,636 --> 00:19:08,057
Ramone Chi Chi Testamente,
a Salvadoran national with quite a record.

215
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:10,643
Remember, you were harping on me
about having a date.

216
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:12,228
Dream on, baby.

217
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:16,732
I want to tell you, what I turned down
tonight, you could never come close to.

218
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:20,569
You should become a science-fiction
writer, instead of a cop or a DA...

219
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:22,404
...with that imagination you got.

220
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:23,989
You're right.

221
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:32,998
How you doing, Mr. Abandano?

222
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,669
Chi Chi, how you doing?

223
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:47,096
- I do not like this place.
- You do not like this place?

224
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:51,183
No, I don't want to go into this place.
You know I hate places like this.

225
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,894
- What don't you like about it?
- The element!

226
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:57,106
You know something, darling?

227
00:19:57,273 --> 00:20:00,776
I really think that you
should lighten up, because...

228
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:03,737
...we're gonna party.

229
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:12,037
This is my lawyer. Say hello.

230
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:19,587
- Two for dinner?
- Just drinks.

231
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:32,933
Good work.

232
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,394
I don't believe it.

233
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:40,357
Sit down here. You're gonna love
this place. I promise.

234
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:46,113
Salvano, the fucking cockroach.

235
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:51,243
I don't believe this. You always do this
to me in front of people.

236
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,668
That is beautiful.

237
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:03,214
Excuse me.

238
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:04,423
I love it.

239
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:07,426
You'll have your engine block
on Tuesday, Boss.

240
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:12,264
If this happened a week from Tuesday,
I could read about it in the paper.

241
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:14,683
Relax. It'll make you famous.

242
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:17,520
Just what I need, to be famous.

243
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:32,034
Can you believe this?

244
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:37,665
Lieutenant Strozah, meet those two cops
in the back alley.

245
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:46,465
We got it down pretty good.

246
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:49,051
We got guys in the front,
we got a couple of cars out back.

247
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:50,636
Sealed off pretty good.

248
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,721
Three of our best guys.
I handpicked each one.

249
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:55,224
Jackson, Lukich, Nico. They're all topshelf.

250
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:57,643
They know how to do this.
They've done it before.

251
00:21:57,726 --> 00:22:00,062
I can tell how much you love it here.

252
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:03,232
God! Now I know why I'm a vegetarian.

253
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:05,651
You eat meat. I know you eat meat.

254
00:22:05,734 --> 00:22:08,445
- I'm gonna throw up.
- I've heard you eat meat.

255
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:14,118
Nico, keep the channel clear.
Don't embarrass us.

256
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:17,746
Right over there.
Two guys in the alley over there.

257
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:19,832
Definitely the Feds.

258
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,212
Frank, it's fucking infested down here.
What are you trying to do to us?

259
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:27,339
Someone from downtown got wind of it.
Don't worry.

260
00:22:27,423 --> 00:22:30,509
They're trying to make points.
Just handle the pinch.

261
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:33,179
This ain't a bust, it's a fucking convention.

262
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:34,930
I don't believe this.

263
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:39,768
Look at this, boys. Here we go.

264
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:47,318
Here we go. Jackson, stay back.

265
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,784
I think they made you.
You're too pretty to be a meatpacker.

266
00:22:55,868 --> 00:22:58,037
It's going down, boys. Let's go.

267
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:01,707
Keep your heads up.

268
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,709
Woman, let's do it.

269
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:11,592
The cars are going around the corner.

270
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:22,311
Come on, Nico. Lukich, get up there.

271
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,408
What do you think?

272
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:37,993
Looks good.

273
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:41,413
Let's get on with it.

274
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:57,513
- What the fuck are you assholes doing?
- Feds!

275
00:23:57,596 --> 00:23:59,849
Shit! They jumped too soon!

276
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:04,395
What the fuck is this?

277
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:05,855
Freeze! Police!

278
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,368
Get back!

279
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,978
Nico, the Lincoln!

280
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:56,405
Nico!

281
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:09,710
Chi Chi!

282
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:14,632
Nico!

283
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:16,842
Nico!

284
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,930
Fucking animal!

285
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:23,516
Get rid of him!

286
00:25:25,684 --> 00:25:27,353
I'm out! Do him!

287
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:37,404
He's still on the roof! Get rid of him!

288
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:43,702
Where do I go? What do I do?

289
00:25:43,786 --> 00:25:45,871
Hit those hooks over there!

290
00:26:21,602 --> 00:26:23,104
What do I do?

291
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:25,773
Stop the fucking car!

292
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:29,694
Stop the fucking car!

293
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,210
Hands up! Out of the car!

294
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,011
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You scared me to death!

295
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:56,846
Nico, you okay?

296
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:00,516
- Wait till you hear about...
- Shut the fuck up!

297
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,685
You make a nice hood ornament, Sarge.

298
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:05,188
- Come on!
- Gotta get this garbage out of here.

299
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:08,774
You gonna lose your license
driving around like that.

300
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:13,446
Let's go.

301
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:21,662
What do we got here?

302
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:26,793
What kind of high is this?

303
00:27:28,753 --> 00:27:30,087
Sky-high.

304
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:32,715
Military explosives.

305
00:27:36,803 --> 00:27:38,262
C-4, my man.

306
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:48,231
Hey, Boss...

307
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:51,567
...you can see your place
from the office of the FBI.

308
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:53,319
Ain't that something?

309
00:27:53,402 --> 00:27:56,405
- Your name again?
- Agent Neeley, Chicago office.

310
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:02,161
The arresting officer, Toscani.
What does he do?

311
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:05,665
- He's a tac sergeant, CPD Vice.
- Hold on a minute...

312
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:07,375
I'll tell you what this cop is.

313
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:10,586
He's a fucking menace.
He almost strangled me!

314
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,756
Your problem is being
taken care of right now.

315
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,802
It should've been handled 12 hours ago
when my throat was in one piece!

316
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:20,555
I don't know who's running
this outfit here...

317
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:24,976
...but I'll tell you one thing:
Somebody better get his wires straight.

318
00:28:26,352 --> 00:28:28,604
You don't know who you're dealing with.

319
00:28:28,688 --> 00:28:32,150
This maniac should be wearing a number,
not a badge!

320
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:35,862
- The director does not want a problem.
- There won't be one.

321
00:28:35,945 --> 00:28:37,905
And I don't want any problems.

322
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:38,823
I understand.

323
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:42,201
Just listen.
They are to be released immediately.

324
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,995
You can count on it.

325
00:28:44,078 --> 00:28:45,621
Avoid all contacts.

326
00:28:45,705 --> 00:28:48,666
You'll have the Bureau's full cooperation.

327
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,716
You're free to go.

328
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:00,678
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

329
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:19,655
Good work. I loved the face of that
FBI guy when the call came through.

330
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,283
Salvano.

331
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:29,749
I don't want any more problems.

332
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:32,460
I don't enjoy babysitting.

333
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:38,758
Everything is going to be all right
from now on.

334
00:29:38,841 --> 00:29:40,927
I promise you, Mr. Zagon.

335
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:52,605
Attention, please. Attention, everyone.
Please, guys.

336
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:55,608
I just want to get a few things
straightened out.

337
00:29:55,691 --> 00:30:00,404
A few minutes ago, I received a call from
the First Deputy Superintendent's office.

338
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:04,867
As we all know, possession of these kinds
of explosives is a federal offense...

339
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:08,704
...and falls under the jurisdiction
of the federal agencies represented here.

340
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:11,124
What kind of bullshit is that?

341
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:14,544
The Feds come in, the doors close,
nobody hears, smells or sees anything.

342
00:30:14,627 --> 00:30:15,837
And that's no answer.

343
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,422
It's no answer to why
the biggest drug dealer in the city...

344
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:20,675
...is out on the street
as free as a fucking bird!

345
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:24,554
Keep it in your pants, all right. These
men have a job to do, just like we do.

346
00:30:24,637 --> 00:30:27,098
It's their game, let them play it.

347
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:33,062
What I'm about to say
does not leave this room. Is that clear?

348
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,524
Mr. Salvano has been working
for some time...

349
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:39,402
...in cooperation
with certain federal agencies.

350
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:44,157
I'm not at liberty to divulge the nature
or extent of Mr. Salvano's involvement.

351
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,827
I just learned of its existence myself
a few hours ago.

352
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,997
One thing I can tell you
is that Mr. Salvano's role...

353
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,001
...is crucial to an extremely
sensitive, ongoing investigation.

354
00:30:55,084 --> 00:30:56,127
Any surveillance...

355
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:01,174
...harassment or unauthorized operations
against this individual are forbidden.

356
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:05,344
I order all of you, with due respect
for your work and your courage...

357
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:06,929
...to stand down.

358
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:12,935
Why don't you assholes
stand down on this?

359
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:23,196
You're gonna need me.

360
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:25,781
Need you. For what?

361
00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:28,034
To get your ass out of jail.

362
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:30,244
You think you can afford my bail?

363
00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:31,454
No.

364
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:33,706
Neither do I. Not on this pay.

365
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,959
You'll end up in jail for a long time,
I have the strangest feeling.

366
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:39,670
You're jealous 'cause I'm gonna stay a cop.

367
00:31:39,962 --> 00:31:42,840
What the fuck is this? Go back to work.

368
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:50,056
Here we go.

369
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:58,541
What are you thinking?

370
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:22,148
Isn't this your mother's church?

371
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:26,068
Yes, but I'll bet she hasn't
seen these boys in the choir.

372
00:33:48,174 --> 00:33:49,550
Hey, Nico!

373
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,677
I can't believe you're in church
without your family.

374
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:53,012
Hello, Father. How are you?

375
00:33:53,095 --> 00:33:54,764
This must be your partner in crime.

376
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,641
- Delores Jackson.
- I'm Father Gennaro.

377
00:33:56,724 --> 00:33:58,601
I saw you at the baptismal party.

378
00:33:58,684 --> 00:34:01,270
- Nico, we gotta go!
- No, please. Wait.

379
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:03,731
God, it's good you're here.

380
00:34:03,815 --> 00:34:06,275
If you got a few minutes,
there's something I'd like to show you.

381
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,610
Please.

382
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,073
I haven't been down here since I was a kid.

383
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,668
What's this?

384
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:26,129
The rats are getting bigger.

385
00:34:27,672 --> 00:34:31,676
- When did this happen?
- Two nights ago. I didn't call the police.

386
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:34,387
What do they want, the bingo receipts?

387
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:07,962
These are friends.

388
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:10,256
Father Tomasino, this is Nico.

389
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:11,883
- Mucho gusto, Padre.
- How do you do?

390
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:13,968
- Sister Mary.
- Hi, Nico.

391
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:16,387
- Delores.
- How do you do, Father?

392
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:18,723
- Se�ora, mucho gusto.
- Hello.

393
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:24,228
My friend, Father Tomasino,
is working with the sanctuary movement.

394
00:35:24,312 --> 00:35:25,605
He's visiting...

395
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:29,942
...helping his people work out
some of their immigration problems.

396
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:34,363
Sorry to have troubled you.
Nico, we must go.

397
00:35:35,948 --> 00:35:37,200
Gracias.

398
00:35:39,243 --> 00:35:41,162
Nice meeting you, sir.

399
00:35:42,747 --> 00:35:43,873
Bye-bye.

400
00:35:58,763 --> 00:36:01,933
- How long have those people been here?
- Too long.

401
00:36:02,016 --> 00:36:04,811
At least the children go to our school.

402
00:36:05,478 --> 00:36:07,688
Who do you think broke into the room?

403
00:36:07,772 --> 00:36:11,192
Kids, maybe. Maybe worse.
It's not the first time.

404
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:15,029
Would you like us to send a car
to check on you?

405
00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:18,074
No, please. Police frighten these people.

406
00:36:19,158 --> 00:36:22,161
I know what you mean.
They frighten me, too.

407
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,291
It's too far out of your way.
I can't ask you to go to that much trouble.

408
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,627
Look, I really don't mind coming by.

409
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,879
Promise, okay? All right?

410
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:36,509
Say, Nico, by the way,
when was your last confession?

411
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:39,428
My last confession?

412
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:42,598
I'm a married man.
I have no sins to confess.

413
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:46,936
You're a police officer.
You got a lot of sins to confess.

414
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:48,855
He's got your number!

415
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,193
- Is that your impression of police officers?
- I want to see you in church Sunday, okay?

416
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:57,238
I feel better when you're in church, okay?

417
00:36:57,488 --> 00:36:59,866
You don't show up, I'll call your mother!

418
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:02,368
I wish you would. She loves you.

419
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:06,205
Why don't you go to church?
It'll be good for you.

420
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:08,374
Get your soul saved.

421
00:37:26,225 --> 00:37:27,768
Our leaders tell us...

422
00:37:27,852 --> 00:37:30,480
...and talk to us about them and us.

423
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:34,859
But almighty God talks to us...

424
00:37:35,902 --> 00:37:38,029
...about all of mankind...

425
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:41,240
...as one.

426
00:37:41,908 --> 00:37:44,202
Now, we have an obligation...

427
00:37:44,952 --> 00:37:47,455
...to find out what is the truth.

428
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:52,043
We need to study. We need to question.

429
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:55,880
We need to read and we need to find out...

430
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:58,549
...what they are doing in our name.

431
00:38:01,594 --> 00:38:04,472
And we must support those brave souls...

432
00:38:05,556 --> 00:38:07,099
...who seek...

433
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:09,560
...the truth.

434
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:13,439
God bless us. Amen.

435
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:05,116
Get down!

436
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,918
There's nothing else we can do.

437
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:02,924
Lord God, Heavenly Father...

438
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:07,553
...receive the soul of our dear
departed friend, Father Joseph Gennaro.

439
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:13,726
Come on.

440
00:40:23,402 --> 00:40:26,989
Get a list of everybody treated here today.
Everybody.

441
00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:29,325
Find those sanctuary people...

442
00:40:29,408 --> 00:40:33,079
...the ones we found hiding
in the bottom of the church.

443
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:37,667
I want to know where they're from
and who might want to harm them.

444
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,336
Where are you gonna be?

445
00:40:40,419 --> 00:40:43,214
Just stay by the radio. I'll find you.

446
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:02,733
- He didn't make it.
- Oh, Nico!

447
00:41:03,192 --> 00:41:04,318
Oh, no!

448
00:41:15,538 --> 00:41:18,791
Lieutenant Strozah, these are
FBI agents: Halloran, Neeley.

449
00:41:24,297 --> 00:41:28,468
Sweetheart, go to the car.
I'll be right there, okay? Take Mama.

450
00:41:33,806 --> 00:41:36,684
Nico, you okay? How's the family doing?

451
00:41:38,144 --> 00:41:41,147
Excuse me. I'd like to have a word
with you.

452
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:42,690
Alone.

453
00:41:55,536 --> 00:41:57,163
What the hell is it?

454
00:41:57,246 --> 00:41:59,832
It's you, that's what the fuck it is!

455
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:01,584
Keep your goddamn hands off me!

456
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:03,711
- You let Salvano walk.
- Salvano?

457
00:42:04,003 --> 00:42:04,337
Yeah.

458
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,422
What are you, crazy?
What does he have to do with this?

459
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:08,549
That was no cherry bomb, that was C-4.

460
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:12,220
I've used that shit. I know what it
smells like and what it blows like.

461
00:42:12,303 --> 00:42:16,599
Salvano never came near that C-4.
It's in federal holding right now.

462
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:19,435
Besides, why would Salvano
blow up a church?

463
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,437
I tailed him two days ago.

464
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:25,483
He and his goon were in that church
and they weren't taking communion.

465
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:28,778
I saw the woman who planted the bomb
and she was with Salvano's lawyer.

466
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:31,030
Now, I want some fucking answers.

467
00:42:31,155 --> 00:42:33,115
You tailed him after I ordered you off?

468
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,618
I want to know where Salvano is.

469
00:42:36,202 --> 00:42:39,372
My orders were to release him,
not babysit him.

470
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:42,458
You think you're rough stuff.

471
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:46,254
Martial arts hero, chop-suey crap!
Let me tell you something.

472
00:42:46,337 --> 00:42:49,465
You're not bulletproof.
You're not even a good cop.

473
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:52,051
You sneak around
playing your street-dick games...

474
00:42:52,135 --> 00:42:56,597
...and all you come up with is conjecture,
wild coincidence and bullshit!

475
00:42:56,681 --> 00:43:00,601
I want the name of the federal agent
who signed for those explosives.

476
00:43:00,685 --> 00:43:02,478
You do your job, I'll do mine.

477
00:43:02,562 --> 00:43:04,230
Bank on it, pal.

478
00:44:16,385 --> 00:44:17,804
- Gentlemen.
- Hello.

479
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:19,806
Hi, how are you doing?

480
00:44:28,439 --> 00:44:30,650
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

481
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:34,987
The wallet. Let me see it.

482
00:44:38,825 --> 00:44:40,910
Aide to Senator Harrison.

483
00:44:51,796 --> 00:44:55,633
I hope I find you, you greasy mother!
I'm gonna kick your ass!

484
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:58,469
Who the fuck do you think you are?

485
00:45:05,685 --> 00:45:10,565
I'm in front of St. Mary's church, where
seven people were killed by a bomb...

486
00:45:50,688 --> 00:45:53,274
- You guys stay out of trouble.
- Okay, Nico.

487
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:01,365
- I hear you're looking for Salvano.
- You heard that?

488
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:02,575
I know where he's at.

489
00:46:02,658 --> 00:46:05,495
- Where's that?
- Right here, motherfucker!

490
00:46:05,745 --> 00:46:09,499
- It's a long way from Kansas, Dorothy!
- Relax, man. Relax.

491
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:13,294
I won't shoot you.
These guys will beat you to death.

492
00:46:13,377 --> 00:46:15,630
You come to our neighborhood,
fuck with our people.

493
00:46:15,713 --> 00:46:18,674
Now our people are going to fuck with you.

494
00:46:42,406 --> 00:46:44,117
We need a doctor!

495
00:46:46,994 --> 00:46:48,329
Fuck him up!

496
00:46:48,412 --> 00:46:50,081
You motherfucker!

497
00:47:48,471 --> 00:47:51,182
Don't kill me! Please don't kill me!

498
00:47:52,141 --> 00:47:53,518
- Who sent you?
- Nobody!

499
00:47:53,601 --> 00:47:55,937
"Nobody?" You did this for fun?

500
00:47:59,607 --> 00:48:01,192
Jimmy Costanza!

501
00:48:02,902 --> 00:48:07,115
If I find out you're lying, I'll come back
and kill you in your own kitchen.

502
00:48:07,198 --> 00:48:08,408
Salvano!

503
00:48:08,992 --> 00:48:10,493
Bautista Salvano!

504
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:16,541
- That's my buddy, man.
- Yeah, man, I know him.

505
00:48:19,669 --> 00:48:21,212
Sic him, Bulldog.

506
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:24,549
- Why are you fuckin' with my friend?
- I'm not in the mood.

507
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:26,426
Fuck your mood, man.

508
00:48:32,015 --> 00:48:33,933
- What's happening?
- What it be like, homey?

509
00:48:34,017 --> 00:48:35,643
- That was real good, man.
- Peace, brother.

510
00:48:36,144 --> 00:48:40,189
The mayor has announced the city's offer
of a $25,000 reward for information...

511
00:48:40,273 --> 00:48:43,443
... leading to the arrest and conviction
of anyone responsible...

512
00:48:43,526 --> 00:48:46,362
... for today's tragic
St. Mary's church bombing.

513
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,948
Why were we in church?

514
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:51,576
I'll tell you what.

515
00:48:52,994 --> 00:48:57,457
I'm willing to break the rules and
I'm willing to tell you everything I know.

516
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,459
I just want some time.

517
00:49:02,378 --> 00:49:04,088
It's probably Jax.

518
00:49:05,048 --> 00:49:06,883
Yeah, Jax. This better be good.

519
00:49:06,966 --> 00:49:08,384
It's bad, Nico.

520
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:11,971
Long time, Nelson.

521
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:17,810
Come on, man! You know better
than to use a name on an open line.

522
00:49:19,562 --> 00:49:23,232
I'm gonna talk for 15 seconds,
and then I'm getting off.

523
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:27,904
You're in trouble, Nico.
Serious, serious trouble.

524
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:31,574
Really? That's fascinating.

525
00:49:32,116 --> 00:49:35,328
Take your wife and family
and get them someplace safe, now!

526
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:39,040
I've been wanting to bring my family
to Switzerland. I just haven't had time.

527
00:49:39,123 --> 00:49:42,919
You hear me? Now!
I'm risking my ass by telling you this.

528
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:46,798
Okay, don't take so long
to call me next time.

529
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,758
Good luck, "pais�".

530
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,867
Why is the CIA calling you
at 2:00 in the morning?

531
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:10,288
Because Fox is a crazy asshole.

532
00:50:11,915 --> 00:50:16,377
He gets drunk, he forgets he's halfway
around the world, and he calls.

533
00:50:19,255 --> 00:50:23,176
He says he just wanted to know
if we got his Christmas card.

534
00:50:24,094 --> 00:50:26,221
Listen, don't be that way.

535
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,766
- I'm just so scared.
- Don't be.

536
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:33,353
I'm gonna take care of everything,
all right?

537
00:50:35,897 --> 00:50:37,273
All right?

538
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,701
Nico, who's there?

539
00:51:03,133 --> 00:51:06,803
O'Hara, what's going on, man?
Isn't it a little early for breakfast?

540
00:51:06,886 --> 00:51:08,555
Nico, how you doing?

541
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:10,807
I'm sorry. I gotta take you downtown.

542
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:13,059
The Feds want to talk. It'll work out.

543
00:51:13,143 --> 00:51:15,311
Here's the warrant, Toscani.

544
00:51:18,648 --> 00:51:20,442
You fucking piece of shit.

545
00:51:20,525 --> 00:51:22,652
I'll take that, thank you.

546
00:51:22,986 --> 00:51:27,031
Easy guys! He's my friend. Take it easy.
It's gonna work out. Let's go.

547
00:51:27,115 --> 00:51:30,118
It'll work out. I'm real sorry about this.

548
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,335
It's not necessary! This is ridiculous!

549
00:51:39,419 --> 00:51:42,589
Let him play his pussy game.
This is his setup.

550
00:51:43,214 --> 00:51:46,384
Who do you think you are coming here
and treating my son like a criminal?

551
00:51:46,468 --> 00:51:47,886
Who do you think you are?

552
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:51,347
- Just stop it! There's an infant here!
- Easy, easy.

553
00:51:53,433 --> 00:51:57,103
- Check that coat.
- Why don't you come check it, asshole.

554
00:51:57,937 --> 00:51:58,855
Take it easy!

555
00:51:58,938 --> 00:52:01,941
Why don't you come
and put your hands on me!

556
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:07,113
- Get him out of here!
- Everything's gonna work out.

557
00:52:07,197 --> 00:52:09,949
Come on. I'll be back in three hours!

558
00:52:11,701 --> 00:52:14,829
The Police Association's
got lawyers for this!

559
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:18,041
You can't do this!

560
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:29,302
This guy, in the middle of the day,
comes in my place and starts wrecking it.

561
00:52:29,385 --> 00:52:31,471
He assaults my customers.

562
00:52:32,097 --> 00:52:36,726
He starts doing all this outer-space stuff,
putting my customers in orbit even.

563
00:52:38,436 --> 00:52:41,272
I remember those violations
you told me he was guilty of.

564
00:52:41,356 --> 00:52:43,691
Look, this is my boy, right here.

565
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:45,568
They finally got you, huh?

566
00:52:45,652 --> 00:52:47,529
They finally got you, motherfucker.

567
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:50,115
I told you it was gonna go down.
Should've listened...

568
00:52:50,198 --> 00:52:51,074
There he is.

569
00:52:51,157 --> 00:52:54,494
You guys got one hell
of a police department around here.

570
00:52:54,577 --> 00:52:57,038
I got a cousin in the department
in New Orleans.

571
00:52:57,122 --> 00:52:59,374
You ever heard of Bob Bouquet?

572
00:53:07,715 --> 00:53:09,884
Put your ass in that chair.

573
00:53:13,388 --> 00:53:16,391
Illegal wiretaps, unauthorized surveillance.

574
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:19,060
When was this guy born?

575
00:53:19,144 --> 00:53:22,814
You're quite a cop, Toscani.
You don't listen to anybody, do you?

576
00:53:23,064 --> 00:53:25,358
- Where's Jax?
- She's out of this!

577
00:53:25,442 --> 00:53:27,360
You're the rotten apple in this barrel.

578
00:53:27,444 --> 00:53:30,280
We don't need to look any farther
than you and your family.

579
00:53:30,363 --> 00:53:32,198
- You, mother...
- Nico!

580
00:53:33,408 --> 00:53:35,577
Do you want to go to prison?

581
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:38,204
Unlawful entry.

582
00:53:38,455 --> 00:53:41,249
- IIlegal search and seizure.
- Deputy...

583
00:53:44,127 --> 00:53:47,088
Who do you think is pulling their strings?

584
00:53:47,672 --> 00:53:50,049
Who do you think they work for?

585
00:53:50,467 --> 00:53:53,178
You were ordered to back off on Salvano.

586
00:53:53,261 --> 00:53:57,015
I suppose you had too big a hard-on
for that, didn't you?

587
00:53:57,474 --> 00:53:59,726
You can't be in on this, Fred.

588
00:54:01,352 --> 00:54:04,063
You're officially suspended, Toscani.

589
00:54:04,647 --> 00:54:07,025
I want your badge and your gun.

590
00:54:14,324 --> 00:54:16,075
You gonna hold me?

591
00:54:16,618 --> 00:54:18,453
You can walk for now.

592
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:21,164
Don't walk far.

593
00:54:30,465 --> 00:54:32,300
Sara, I'm all right.

594
00:54:33,343 --> 00:54:35,470
It's okay, and I love you.

595
00:54:37,847 --> 00:54:40,433
Tell Mama not to worry. All right?

596
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:42,602
I love you. 'Bye.

597
00:54:44,187 --> 00:54:46,523
What the hell is going on?
What's happening here?

598
00:54:46,606 --> 00:54:51,486
The sanctuary people, they're refugees
from El Salvador, Guatemala and Chile.

599
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,447
They're terrified of cops.
They're not even talking to me.

600
00:54:54,531 --> 00:54:58,952
Down at the morgue, they got a guy
who was not a congregation member.

601
00:55:00,203 --> 00:55:01,704
Alan Singletary.

602
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:06,126
He's an aide to Senator Harrison.
The Foreign Relations Committee Harrison.

603
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:10,422
The guy who's been crawling all over
the Central American drug connections.

604
00:55:11,256 --> 00:55:12,799
You're gonna make a hell of a DA.

605
00:55:12,882 --> 00:55:16,970
Harrison's staff has been compiling
some kind of heavyweight white paper.

606
00:55:17,303 --> 00:55:21,433
It implicates some of the major
intelligence agencies in drug trafficking.

607
00:55:21,516 --> 00:55:23,476
They'll release it next week.

608
00:55:24,602 --> 00:55:26,896
- So that's how Fox knew.
- Who?

609
00:55:27,564 --> 00:55:32,485
An old Agency buddy of mine called me
last night. He said my family's in danger.

610
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:34,362
Luke, I need a favor.

611
00:55:34,446 --> 00:55:37,824
I need you to go to the house, call
Uncle Branca. Mama's got the number.

612
00:55:37,907 --> 00:55:39,617
Get the family ready to move out.

613
00:55:39,701 --> 00:55:43,288
You got it, buddy.
They took away your "pistola", right?

614
00:55:43,621 --> 00:55:44,664
Yeah.

615
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:46,875
Thanks.

616
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,543
I don't believe this.

617
00:56:01,598 --> 00:56:05,518
You come in here, with the children,
and bring all this up...

618
00:56:07,729 --> 00:56:08,897
Listen.

619
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,440
You know me.

620
00:56:10,774 --> 00:56:12,734
Please, tell these people...

621
00:56:12,817 --> 00:56:15,111
...they don't have anything to worry about.

622
00:56:15,195 --> 00:56:18,156
There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola.

623
00:56:18,615 --> 00:56:20,200
I know, Sister.

624
00:56:29,459 --> 00:56:31,127
Father Tomasino.

625
00:56:33,213 --> 00:56:34,881
He came alone...

626
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,426
...two weeks ago. He had papers...

627
00:56:39,511 --> 00:56:41,971
...papers to give to the senator.

628
00:56:42,972 --> 00:56:46,434
Father Tomasino was going
to give the mass that day.

629
00:56:47,393 --> 00:56:49,979
Father Gennaro talked him out of it.

630
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:52,899
He was afraid for Father Tomasino.

631
00:56:53,316 --> 00:56:56,402
So it was Father Tomasino
they wanted to kill.

632
00:56:58,988 --> 00:57:00,240
Where is Father Tomasino?

633
00:57:00,323 --> 00:57:02,575
He go, mister. He ran away.

634
00:57:03,326 --> 00:57:07,330
If anybody knows where he is, you've got
to tell me because I know I can help him.

635
00:57:07,414 --> 00:57:09,332
We don't know, mister.

636
00:57:22,762 --> 00:57:25,265
Jax, I'm serious. You're out of this.

637
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:29,018
Wait a minute. I got a list.
You told me to get a list.

638
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:33,273
I'm telling you, you're finished.
I mean it. Out.

639
00:57:33,356 --> 00:57:35,942
You're not talking to a rookie,
you understand?

640
00:57:36,025 --> 00:57:40,321
You go home, you take care of your family,
okay, and I'll call you.

641
00:57:43,366 --> 00:57:44,826
Paperwork only!

642
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:47,328
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

643
00:57:50,457 --> 00:57:51,791
Thank you!

644
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,769
Okay, come across now.
Come on, baby, come on.

645
00:58:13,688 --> 00:58:15,023
Hi, Nico!

646
00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:41,466
- Call the police.
- Come on!

647
00:58:45,845 --> 00:58:47,680
Freeze, motherfucker!

648
00:58:47,847 --> 00:58:49,849
Anybody moves, he dies.

649
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:53,103
Drop that magazine, motherfucker, now!

650
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:57,774
Everybody's gonna ditch their weapons,
butt first.

651
00:58:57,857 --> 00:59:00,860
Grab the barrel and do it, everybody. You!

652
00:59:01,611 --> 00:59:02,779
Now, you.

653
00:59:03,404 --> 00:59:04,531
Now, you.

654
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:08,284
Put your hands on your head.

655
00:59:08,368 --> 00:59:10,870
All right, fall in behind the last man.

656
00:59:10,954 --> 00:59:13,915
I don't think you can drop us all, badass.

657
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:16,709
You're right, but I'll get an A for effort.

658
00:59:16,793 --> 00:59:18,711
All right. Let's go. Fall out!

659
00:59:18,795 --> 00:59:20,797
Put your hands on your head.

660
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,715
Come on, you! Move!

661
00:59:29,431 --> 00:59:32,434
Please don't come in here. Please, please.

662
00:59:32,892 --> 00:59:34,561
Not in my store.

663
00:59:34,811 --> 00:59:37,397
It's a police emergency. I'm a cop.

664
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,483
On your knees. Give me the phone.
Let's go.

665
00:59:41,651 --> 00:59:44,487
- This guy's gotta work, too.
- Get down, asshole.

666
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:46,156
Get the fuck down!

667
00:59:46,406 --> 00:59:47,574
You wanna get down?

668
00:59:47,657 --> 00:59:50,034
Get down on your fucking knees!

669
01:00:11,055 --> 01:00:13,057
They tell me, "Come to America!"

670
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:19,251
No, not in my store!

671
01:00:22,921 --> 01:00:24,715
There's the police!

672
01:00:29,761 --> 01:00:31,180
No, mister!

673
01:00:52,993 --> 01:00:54,786
Another police car.

674
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:00,459
Look! My store.

675
01:01:05,589 --> 01:01:07,966
Come on, come on. Is it clear?

676
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,429
Sara, Branca will take care of us.
We'll be safe there.

677
01:01:13,222 --> 01:01:16,391
Family goes in the Lincoln.
I'll ride in front.

678
01:01:26,485 --> 01:01:30,155
I'll be five minutes behind you.
It's got to be this way.

679
01:01:32,491 --> 01:01:33,742
Let's go.

680
01:01:35,577 --> 01:01:36,620
Where's Jax?

681
01:01:36,703 --> 01:01:40,040
She thinks there's some documents
in some guy's apartment.

682
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:44,002
They killed the wrong priest.

683
01:01:45,003 --> 01:01:47,172
What are you talking about?

684
01:01:51,593 --> 01:01:54,263
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

685
01:01:55,597 --> 01:01:58,225
The second priest from Costa Rica...

686
01:01:59,852 --> 01:02:03,230
...hiding in the church.
He was the one they meant to kill.

687
01:02:04,064 --> 01:02:05,816
You know where to find this guy?

688
01:02:05,899 --> 01:02:07,317
No, I do not.

689
01:02:08,527 --> 01:02:10,445
Then you're gonna need help.

690
01:02:10,529 --> 01:02:12,865
Yeah, I'd like you to help me.

691
01:02:13,031 --> 01:02:14,700
Watch my family.

692
01:02:15,284 --> 01:02:17,202
What are you gonna do?

693
01:02:17,703 --> 01:02:19,621
You don't want to know.

694
01:02:32,634 --> 01:02:35,387
Freeze! Put your hands up in the air.

695
01:02:35,637 --> 01:02:38,307
Now go put them on the hood of the car.

696
01:02:39,308 --> 01:02:43,604
Special Agent Neeley, what were you
doing with that woman up there?

697
01:02:43,896 --> 01:02:48,609
Were you engaging in some kind of
unnatural sex acts with that young lady?

698
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:50,903
She must be 15!

699
01:02:51,653 --> 01:02:53,655
That's illegal in some states, you know.

700
01:02:53,739 --> 01:02:55,073
What are you talking about?

701
01:02:55,157 --> 01:02:58,619
I thought you federal agents were straight,
honorable guys.

702
01:02:58,702 --> 01:03:01,038
Does your wife know about this?

703
01:03:01,997 --> 01:03:04,249
Sex is not the only thing in life.

704
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,584
Get in.

705
01:03:14,885 --> 01:03:17,346
- So, how has your day been?
- Okay.

706
01:03:20,641 --> 01:03:23,268
Listen, Toscani, I want to congratulate you.

707
01:03:23,352 --> 01:03:25,813
You just made number four
on the "most-wanted" list.

708
01:03:25,896 --> 01:03:28,649
Number four? I want to be number one.

709
01:03:30,692 --> 01:03:32,277
The day is young.

710
01:03:35,697 --> 01:03:36,782
What can I do for you?

711
01:03:36,865 --> 01:03:41,203
There was a quantity of C-4 explosive
brought in here four days ago.

712
01:03:41,745 --> 01:03:43,121
Hell, that's gone.

713
01:03:43,205 --> 01:03:44,623
- When?
- Right away.

714
01:03:44,706 --> 01:03:47,668
They scooped that stuff out of here
before it even got tagged.

715
01:03:47,751 --> 01:03:49,419
You know who took it?

716
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,504
CIA.

717
01:03:54,007 --> 01:03:55,968
Let me see the paperwork on it.

718
01:03:56,051 --> 01:03:57,719
You got to sign.

719
01:03:57,886 --> 01:04:02,349
Yeah, I remember that fellow.
Flew special out of Langley. Bomb tech.

720
01:04:02,808 --> 01:04:04,518
Real nice fellow.

721
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:06,728
- I'll bet.
- Here it is.

722
01:04:07,187 --> 01:04:08,230
Fox.

723
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:10,065
Nelson Fox.

724
01:04:14,653 --> 01:04:16,238
- Thanks.
- Right.

725
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:19,158
Now what?

726
01:04:20,409 --> 01:04:24,997
Yes, sir. The agent has been with
the Central American desk since 1984.

727
01:04:25,414 --> 01:04:28,083
Thank you. That's what I wanted to know.

728
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:30,544
All right, take your shoes off.

729
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,088
Come on, let's go.

730
01:04:35,215 --> 01:04:37,801
So you think I'm a bad cop, Neeley?

731
01:04:38,677 --> 01:04:40,846
You know something? Maybe I am.

732
01:04:40,929 --> 01:04:43,724
But at least I don't have my face
buried up Washington's ass.

733
01:04:43,807 --> 01:04:46,643
Listen, Toscani.
Maybe I've judged you a little harshly.

734
01:04:46,727 --> 01:04:48,604
I think you have.
And you know something?

735
01:04:48,687 --> 01:04:51,940
What I'd like to do,
for the way you've treated me...

736
01:04:52,024 --> 01:04:54,943
...is treat you in a similar fashion.
I'd like you to get up...

737
01:04:55,027 --> 01:04:57,738
...run your ass over there
and jump in the fucking lake.

738
01:04:57,821 --> 01:05:00,407
If you don't hurry,
I'll empty this gun in your butt.

739
01:05:00,491 --> 01:05:02,409
Move it, Agent Neeley!

740
01:05:05,037 --> 01:05:06,371
Let's go!

741
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:17,382
Jump, Neeley!

742
01:05:48,872 --> 01:05:50,999
Nico, what are you doing here?

743
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:53,001
- I need a favor.
- Sure.

744
01:05:54,753 --> 01:05:57,840
- How late are you gonna be here today?
- I'm off at 6:00.

745
01:05:57,923 --> 01:05:59,299
I'll be here.

746
01:06:06,431 --> 01:06:08,767
Don't be too long, lady.
I got a crew coming in.

747
01:06:08,851 --> 01:06:11,019
Thanks. We'll be done in a little while.

748
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:12,771
We don't have much time.

749
01:06:12,855 --> 01:06:16,275
They're going to tear this goddamn place
down in a matter of hours.

750
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:19,069
There's no way to access
Covert Operations directly...

751
01:06:19,153 --> 01:06:23,198
...but I got a guy at Princeton.
He has a database bigger than Langley.

752
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:27,369
How the hell did you get in this mess?

753
01:06:27,452 --> 01:06:30,372
I thought you were finished with the CIA.

754
01:06:33,959 --> 01:06:35,335
Trap door.

755
01:06:45,804 --> 01:06:48,056
We'll wriggle up these two...

756
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,517
...operative dossiers.

757
01:06:52,436 --> 01:06:54,730
Start with my friend, Nelson.

758
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,746
Your friend has had a hell of a career.

759
01:07:10,829 --> 01:07:14,458
Give me the names of every Agency man
involved in this.

760
01:07:20,172 --> 01:07:22,424
Nico, what is going on here?

761
01:07:24,593 --> 01:07:26,011
Here we go.

762
01:07:26,595 --> 01:07:31,266
Five agents from the Central American
desk. All of them, trained assassins.

763
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:35,771
They've all come to Chicago
in the last week and they're all still here.

764
01:07:36,855 --> 01:07:39,858
They got the whole fucking
killing team here.

765
01:07:39,942 --> 01:07:41,610
It looks that way.

766
01:07:46,073 --> 01:07:47,324
Thanks.

767
01:07:49,868 --> 01:07:51,203
I owe you one.

768
01:07:51,286 --> 01:07:54,373
- Where are you going?
- I gotta find that priest.

769
01:07:54,456 --> 01:07:55,874
Be careful.

770
01:07:59,962 --> 01:08:01,964
I find this totally incredulous.

771
01:08:02,047 --> 01:08:06,468
You, being a station chief at the CIA,
didn't know what was going on?

772
01:08:06,552 --> 01:08:08,804
Mr. Senator,
I'd like to explain a few things.

773
01:08:08,887 --> 01:08:13,016
Either you perjured yourself earlier,
or you're lying to us now.

774
01:08:13,892 --> 01:08:16,562
Take a few moments
before you answer this.

775
01:08:16,645 --> 01:08:18,981
And remember that you're under oath.

776
01:08:19,064 --> 01:08:23,819
It was agreed this was a valuable asset
and that I had to work out a way...

777
01:08:24,069 --> 01:08:26,488
... they had to work out a way
in which to take over.

778
01:08:26,572 --> 01:08:29,324
And did that include
giving money to the enterprise?

779
01:08:29,408 --> 01:08:31,243
Not insofar as I knew.

780
01:08:31,326 --> 01:08:33,829
- And the colonel never told you?
- No.

781
01:08:33,912 --> 01:08:37,082
Are you saying that this was going
to be a donation for the CIA...

782
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:38,625
... as far as you were concerned?

783
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:40,169
We were going to walk away from it.

784
01:08:40,252 --> 01:08:41,461
Hello.

785
01:08:42,921 --> 01:08:44,506
Oh, yes, Sister. Yes.

786
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,383
Sister Mary, right.

787
01:08:47,676 --> 01:08:51,805
No, there will be no problem.
Now just calm down. Right, right.

788
01:08:52,097 --> 01:08:53,682
Now where are you?

789
01:09:06,195 --> 01:09:07,446
Who is it?

790
01:09:38,227 --> 01:09:39,144
Father!

791
01:09:39,228 --> 01:09:41,063
Get her out of here.

792
01:09:44,316 --> 01:09:45,984
This way, Father.

793
01:10:39,705 --> 01:10:41,623
Where did you find this guy?

794
01:10:41,707 --> 01:10:45,627
The nun from the daycare called.
She's with the priest at a place on Damon.

795
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:48,964
She saw two guys sneaking
around the church and she got scared.

796
01:10:49,047 --> 01:10:50,966
I got papers from that senator's aide.

797
01:10:51,049 --> 01:10:55,637
Everything Harrison has been working on.
It's unbelievable. It's over at my place.

798
01:10:55,721 --> 01:11:00,017
I need you to do me a favor.
Stay out of it. Just stay in the car.

799
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,271
Nico, far be it for me to complain...

800
01:11:04,813 --> 01:11:08,984
...but you got Jax pulling burglaries.
You got me doing God only knows what.

801
01:11:09,067 --> 01:11:12,488
When we hit the joint,
I don't want you celling with me.

802
01:11:12,571 --> 01:11:14,907
Jax, we'll work out something.

803
01:11:29,588 --> 01:11:32,633
Why don't you go over there
and sweet-talk him?

804
01:11:32,716 --> 01:11:33,759
Sure.

805
01:11:43,268 --> 01:11:47,064
If I were you, I would listen
to what this man has to say.

806
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:50,442
He knows what's best for you.

807
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:06,041
You wouldn't lie to me would you, Father?

808
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:08,085
It's a sin.

809
01:12:09,211 --> 01:12:10,546
Look at me!

810
01:12:10,796 --> 01:12:14,758
If you spoke to anyone
about our plans to kill the senator...

811
01:12:15,509 --> 01:12:17,219
...tell me now...

812
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:20,764
...and I won't have to use this.

813
01:12:20,848 --> 01:12:23,725
This is from confession. I tell no one.

814
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,327
Let's go.

815
01:12:46,915 --> 01:12:49,585
Under no circumstances
are you to come out of this car.

816
01:12:49,668 --> 01:12:51,753
Just stay here, all right?

817
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:59,178
Take a nice look at it.

818
01:12:59,261 --> 01:13:01,180
I got it just for you.

819
01:13:07,269 --> 01:13:09,188
Do you feel that? Nice?

820
01:13:10,355 --> 01:13:11,899
You like that?

821
01:13:15,527 --> 01:13:18,655
Now you're gonna start feeling
something warm.

822
01:13:18,947 --> 01:13:20,991
Very warm and wonderful.

823
01:13:21,533 --> 01:13:22,951
Think about it.

824
01:13:23,285 --> 01:13:24,995
Warm. I love it!

825
01:13:26,872 --> 01:13:30,125
I enjoy this. I really enjoy the shit out
of this thing.

826
01:13:30,209 --> 01:13:32,002
We'll enjoy it together.

827
01:13:32,294 --> 01:13:35,923
You've always been alone.
Now you'll be with me, together!

828
01:13:53,816 --> 01:13:56,068
I want to know who you told.

829
01:13:57,402 --> 01:13:58,946
I told them...

830
01:14:00,864 --> 01:14:02,407
...you make...

831
01:14:02,491 --> 01:14:04,576
...the children see you...

832
01:14:04,993 --> 01:14:07,329
...mutilating their mothers...

833
01:14:08,413 --> 01:14:10,207
...and sometimes...

834
01:14:10,749 --> 01:14:12,835
...you do these things...

835
01:14:13,252 --> 01:14:15,045
...to the children.

836
01:14:16,338 --> 01:14:18,215
Did you tell anybody?

837
01:14:21,343 --> 01:14:23,220
Damn it, tell me now!

838
01:14:23,887 --> 01:14:25,347
Tell me now!

839
01:14:31,687 --> 01:14:34,231
Father, I have had enough of this.
Father, I want you to tell me the truth.

840
01:14:40,612 --> 01:14:42,281
Can we kill him?

841
01:14:43,365 --> 01:14:46,702
If you told anyone about our plans
to kill the senator...

842
01:14:46,785 --> 01:14:48,704
...we cannot kill him!

843
01:14:50,455 --> 01:14:51,748
Nothing!

844
01:14:58,589 --> 01:14:59,882
Phase two.

845
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:07,556
Christ!

846
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,873
- Move it!
- What are you doing? Get out of here.

847
01:15:36,126 --> 01:15:38,462
Jax, get the hell out of here!

848
01:15:46,227 --> 01:15:47,353
Nico!

849
01:15:54,569 --> 01:15:55,695
Jax!

850
01:16:03,786 --> 01:16:05,371
- Go!
- I got him!

851
01:16:25,767 --> 01:16:27,226
Where is he?

852
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:30,188
Down there!

853
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:39,238
I got a bona fide emergency here.
What am I supposed to do?

854
01:16:44,535 --> 01:16:45,870
- Shut the fuck up!
- Yes, sir.

855
01:16:45,954 --> 01:16:47,789
Get inside! Come on!

856
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:52,085
I hear sirens but I don't see any cops.

857
01:16:52,168 --> 01:16:55,213
If they were cops,
they'd show me their badges, asshole.

858
01:16:55,296 --> 01:16:57,590
A bona fide gunfight, asshole!

859
01:17:00,259 --> 01:17:01,636
Get up front!

860
01:17:02,178 --> 01:17:05,723
- Shut up! Be quiet!
- What the hell am I supposed to do?

861
01:17:05,807 --> 01:17:09,686
Get the car on Track 3 out of the way.
At least, get that out of the way.

862
01:17:09,769 --> 01:17:13,815
They got guns all over the place.
I got a carload of passengers.

863
01:18:21,382 --> 01:18:25,511
Damn it! Call Nico's uncle
and find out if he's heard from him.

864
01:18:26,471 --> 01:18:28,306
Shut up and save your strength.

865
01:18:28,389 --> 01:18:30,224
I'm okay. I'm okay.

866
01:18:30,558 --> 01:18:32,477
- Where are we going?
- Cubicle D.

867
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,270
I got on my vest.

868
01:18:37,357 --> 01:18:38,775
Where is he?

869
01:18:39,567 --> 01:18:40,944
What do you mean you don't know?

870
01:18:41,027 --> 01:18:43,780
We don't know what happened
to him, Branca.

871
01:18:43,863 --> 01:18:45,490
Yeah, she's gonna be all right.

872
01:18:45,573 --> 01:18:48,159
You hear anything, you let me know.

873
01:18:49,369 --> 01:18:50,578
Capisci?

874
01:18:53,706 --> 01:18:54,958
It's Nico.

875
01:18:58,294 --> 01:18:59,796
Jesus Christ.

876
01:19:08,096 --> 01:19:10,223
The motherfuckers got Jax.

877
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:12,308
Lukich called. She's not dead.

878
01:19:12,392 --> 01:19:15,103
She's gonna make it.
She was wearing a vest.

879
01:19:31,703 --> 01:19:33,997
This was picked up with your mail
this morning.

880
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,916
They're letting you know
if you don't back off...

881
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,002
...they're gonna get to your family.

882
01:19:39,085 --> 01:19:41,671
- You've got to do it, Nico.
- Tell him, Sara.

883
01:19:41,754 --> 01:19:43,589
You know you have to.

884
01:19:43,881 --> 01:19:45,675
Listen to her, Nicola.

885
01:19:45,758 --> 01:19:47,343
This is your family.

886
01:19:47,427 --> 01:19:52,390
Ever notice how clean babies smell, like
nothing in the world has touched them?

887
01:20:02,984 --> 01:20:05,486
Mom, take him upstairs, will you?

888
01:20:09,157 --> 01:20:11,534
Come, Giuliano, we'll go upstairs.

889
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:19,876
Do you know why I love you?

890
01:20:20,376 --> 01:20:23,379
What it is about you
that I've always loved?

891
01:20:23,504 --> 01:20:24,922
It's pride.

892
01:20:26,674 --> 01:20:29,594
But, Nico, that pride may kill all of us.

893
01:20:36,017 --> 01:20:37,810
Swallow your pride.

894
01:20:40,688 --> 01:20:42,941
Choke on it, if you have to.

895
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:46,819
- Lay it down, please.
- You know something?

896
01:20:47,528 --> 01:20:51,616
There's nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do for my family.

897
01:20:52,033 --> 01:20:53,868
Nobody will harm us.

898
01:20:54,994 --> 01:20:57,497
I don't want you to worry. Okay?

899
01:21:35,493 --> 01:21:38,579
Not even you can hit him
at this range, Nico.

900
01:21:40,081 --> 01:21:41,958
That wasn't the plan, Nelson.

901
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:43,501
Close range?

902
01:21:44,502 --> 01:21:47,964
It'd never work. It's rigged.
Scanned every 35 seconds.

903
01:21:48,047 --> 01:21:50,967
I was thinking of a claymore on the roof...

904
01:21:51,342 --> 01:21:52,385
No!

905
01:21:52,885 --> 01:21:56,014
The roof is wired, too.
Sensors every 15 feet.

906
01:21:57,098 --> 01:21:58,474
Okay. Now you can move.

907
01:21:58,558 --> 01:22:01,894
- It's me. You don't have to treat me like...
- Slow!

908
01:22:01,978 --> 01:22:05,481
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.
Move! Slow.

909
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:09,152
You even look at me funny,
you're in the river, Toscani.

910
01:22:09,235 --> 01:22:12,530
I figured you'd do your recon
from this building.

911
01:22:14,616 --> 01:22:17,952
- You're looking fit.
- I'm getting a bit of a tire.

912
01:22:18,286 --> 01:22:20,913
- Is that your own tailor?
- Hong Kong.

913
01:22:21,581 --> 01:22:23,833
- You've come a long way.
- Yeah.

914
01:22:24,584 --> 01:22:25,877
Just walk.

915
01:22:27,587 --> 01:22:28,921
I don't believe you.

916
01:22:29,005 --> 01:22:33,092
What's so hard to believe?
I want to help you, you dumb guinea.

917
01:22:33,801 --> 01:22:36,179
I've been trying to talk
some sense into you.

918
01:22:36,262 --> 01:22:38,222
You're still "Fox the Fixer."

919
01:22:38,306 --> 01:22:42,393
If I wanted to cap you,
I'd save myself all this damn chitchat.

920
01:22:42,936 --> 01:22:46,105
I'd make big points for myself
if I brought your scalp in.

921
01:22:46,189 --> 01:22:48,358
Shit, I'd be White House material.

922
01:22:48,524 --> 01:22:50,735
Is that what Zagon is,
one of your basement boys?

923
01:22:50,818 --> 01:22:54,697
Zagon's a rancher. 4,000 acres
in Costa Rica. Beautiful place.

924
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:59,494
Beautiful place, huh? Was that bought
with opium money from the triangle?

925
01:23:00,036 --> 01:23:02,580
And a ton of coke a week
from other places.

926
01:23:02,664 --> 01:23:06,250
Which he funnels here through Salvano.
The company getting it's cut, of course.

927
01:23:06,334 --> 01:23:07,835
Legal tender.

928
01:23:09,212 --> 01:23:12,215
So war is still the greatest business, huh?

929
01:23:12,882 --> 01:23:17,053
These guys have started and financed
every war we've ever fought.

930
01:23:17,178 --> 01:23:21,307
Nobody would believe me if I told them
the bankers were the CIA.

931
01:23:22,141 --> 01:23:24,852
Come on, Toscani, don't preach to me.

932
01:23:25,311 --> 01:23:27,522
So the senator couldn't be bought,
could he?

933
01:23:27,605 --> 01:23:32,318
He was gonna expose your plans to invade
Nicaragua with your fucking coke money.

934
01:23:32,568 --> 01:23:35,029
So the Agency clears Zagon
to cap his ass, right?

935
01:23:35,113 --> 01:23:37,073
Just keep walking, asshole.

936
01:23:37,156 --> 01:23:40,118
So some poor, innocent priest finds out.
He comes here.

937
01:23:40,201 --> 01:23:43,705
But you can't kill the senator
until you know if the "padre" has talked.

938
01:23:43,788 --> 01:23:48,584
So Zagon comes in, "Tell me," with his
little doctor bag. Only by then, I'm in on it.

939
01:23:49,002 --> 01:23:52,630
And you fucking know
I'm gonna recognize his handiwork.

940
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,509
If your name would've been Joe Smith,
I never would've caught it.

941
01:23:56,592 --> 01:23:59,387
But how many Nicola Toscanis are there?

942
01:23:59,929 --> 01:24:03,933
Tell me something, old buddy.
Do we kill our own senators now?

943
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:06,519
Why not? The Romans did.

944
01:24:06,603 --> 01:24:09,522
- Are we the fucking Romans?
- We're an empire, too.

945
01:24:09,647 --> 01:24:12,275
You don't believe that shit for a minute.

946
01:24:12,358 --> 01:24:13,943
Just walk. Go!

947
01:24:24,829 --> 01:24:26,247
Hold it, Nico.

948
01:24:28,875 --> 01:24:31,878
- Here's your key, sir.
- My buddy will drive.

949
01:24:38,635 --> 01:24:40,345
You know something?

950
01:24:40,428 --> 01:24:45,141
In Europe, they're trying some 80-year-old
camp guard for Nazi war crimes.

951
01:24:45,934 --> 01:24:48,937
All around our country,
they got guys on Death Row...

952
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,773
...for murdering one, two, three guys.

953
01:24:52,148 --> 01:24:55,068
And they probably deserve
what they're gonna get.

954
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:56,819
But you and I...

955
01:24:56,903 --> 01:24:59,322
...we know people
that are personally responsible...

956
01:24:59,405 --> 01:25:02,742
...for the death
of 50,000 non-military personnel.

957
01:25:03,409 --> 01:25:07,163
Librarians, teachers, doctors,
women, children, all dead.

958
01:25:08,122 --> 01:25:10,541
We've wiped out entire cultures.

959
01:25:10,792 --> 01:25:12,251
And for what?

960
01:25:12,794 --> 01:25:17,382
Not one CIA agent has ever been tried,
much less accused, of any crimes.

961
01:25:18,758 --> 01:25:22,762
You guys think you're above the law,
but you ain't above mine.

962
01:25:24,806 --> 01:25:28,601
Nico, we don't have time for this.
Get in the goddamn car.

963
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:55,962
I've been waiting for the day
I'd catch up with this motherfucker.

964
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:04,887
Salvano and his scumbag dealer.

965
01:26:06,306 --> 01:26:08,308
What a team we got here.

966
01:26:08,516 --> 01:26:10,768
I told you, you'd never be the man.

967
01:26:10,852 --> 01:26:13,438
Nelson, we've been looking for you.

968
01:26:14,814 --> 01:26:16,357
I see that you...

969
01:26:16,983 --> 01:26:18,735
...found our friend.

970
01:26:18,818 --> 01:26:20,278
Thanks, Fox.

971
01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:23,031
I didn't bring him. I swear it.

972
01:26:23,531 --> 01:26:26,242
You two must have had a lot to talk about.

973
01:26:26,326 --> 01:26:28,828
Reminiscing about the good old days?

974
01:26:28,911 --> 01:26:30,163
Stay still!

975
01:26:31,539 --> 01:26:33,541
Just fucking don't move.

976
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:36,127
Nelson, bring our friend in.

977
01:26:41,007 --> 01:26:43,009
Come on, be a good boy.

978
01:26:44,344 --> 01:26:45,762
Dive, Nico!

979
01:27:02,278 --> 01:27:04,155
Get that motherfucker!

980
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,048
Move it!

981
01:27:25,343 --> 01:27:26,511
Get him!

982
01:27:56,624 --> 01:27:58,626
Stop the car, you fuck!

983
01:28:04,841 --> 01:28:07,218
Stop the car, you piece of shit!

984
01:28:08,344 --> 01:28:09,637
Stop it!

985
01:28:27,655 --> 01:28:29,032
Fox's car!

986
01:29:13,952 --> 01:29:15,620
He's on the ramp now.

987
01:29:15,703 --> 01:29:18,873
He's coming out the Wabash entrance.
Get there, Deep Throat.

988
01:29:18,957 --> 01:29:21,501
Roger, Spike Leader. We read you.

989
01:29:30,551 --> 01:29:32,345
Get out of the car!

990
01:29:32,512 --> 01:29:34,222
I want him alive.

991
01:29:41,688 --> 01:29:43,106
He's clean.

992
01:29:43,731 --> 01:29:45,316
Bring him over.

993
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:48,152
Let's go!

994
01:29:51,531 --> 01:29:55,451
We're out of here.
Abandon the vehicles and get out of here.

995
01:29:56,244 --> 01:29:59,247
Tommy, hurry up! Get in.
We're out of here.

996
01:30:14,304 --> 01:30:17,557
Now, our honored guest,
Senator Ernest Harrison.

997
01:30:38,077 --> 01:30:41,748
I hope this don't take too long
'cause I'm getting hungry.

998
01:30:49,005 --> 01:30:51,883
This is bullshit. We've got work to do.

999
01:30:52,675 --> 01:30:55,637
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

1000
01:30:57,722 --> 01:31:01,976
We've got an hour before we say good-bye
to the honorable senator.

1001
01:31:02,352 --> 01:31:05,605
You know, you've got to learn
to take time to...

1002
01:31:06,272 --> 01:31:08,066
...smell the roses.

1003
01:31:08,608 --> 01:31:11,861
How are you gonna do him?
Do him in the motorcade...

1004
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,114
...or pass him through a hotel kitchen?

1005
01:31:24,248 --> 01:31:25,750
Put his face up.

1006
01:31:28,086 --> 01:31:29,337
Hold it up.

1007
01:31:30,421 --> 01:31:33,049
Here you go, Toscani."Dr. Feelgood."

1008
01:31:47,398 --> 01:31:51,152
l've used these little beauties
many times to extract information.

1009
01:31:51,406 --> 01:31:53,636
For the first time in my life...

1010
01:31:54,078 --> 01:31:56,592
...l'm gonna do it just for the fun.

1011
01:31:59,422 --> 01:32:02,414
Get away from me with that,
you piece of shit!

1012
01:32:10,735 --> 01:32:12,293
That's it, fight it!

1013
01:32:12,447 --> 01:32:14,165
Fight it, cherry...

1014
01:32:15,119 --> 01:32:17,474
...so it speeds right on its way.

1015
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,065
Fight it!

1016
01:32:19,628 --> 01:32:21,220
Keep fighting it!

1017
01:32:30,649 --> 01:32:32,719
Oh, you're a good boy, now.

1018
01:32:35,409 --> 01:32:37,843
That's what l've been waiting for.

1019
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:40,561
Let him go.

1020
01:32:53,962 --> 01:32:56,297
Toscani, my sleeping beauty...

1021
01:32:56,923 --> 01:32:59,342
...you should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1022
01:32:59,425 --> 01:33:01,928
You're too fucking dumb, asshole.

1023
01:33:06,724 --> 01:33:08,268
Jake! Look out!

1024
01:33:46,127 --> 01:33:48,004
Say something. Nico?

1025
01:33:50,131 --> 01:33:51,132
Is there a doctor here?

1026
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:53,259
Quick! Call an ambulance!

1027
01:33:57,054 --> 01:34:01,809
Agent Neeley, FBI. We've got a problem,
but we don't know what it is, yet.

1028
01:34:06,439 --> 01:34:09,025
Please, Senator Harrison, this way.

1029
01:34:09,817 --> 01:34:14,071
We are standing in front of the home
of Police Sergeant Nico Toscani.

1030
01:34:14,155 --> 01:34:17,533
Behind me, the entourage
of Senator Harrison is arriving.

1031
01:34:17,617 --> 01:34:21,996
Lots of security here. We have police
officers on the scene and federal agents.

1032
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:25,082
Of course, there is concern
of a possible assassination attempt.

1033
01:34:25,166 --> 01:34:29,086
That's why you've got so many
law enforcement officers here.

1034
01:34:33,341 --> 01:34:36,552
- This is Senator Harrison. Nico Toscani.
- How do you do?

1035
01:34:36,636 --> 01:34:38,471
Please, don't get up.

1036
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:40,681
Detective Toscani...

1037
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:44,769
...I just felt compelled to come
and thank you personally...

1038
01:34:44,852 --> 01:34:48,272
...and to assure you that we'll use
every resource available...

1039
01:34:48,356 --> 01:34:50,233
...to bring these men to justice...

1040
01:34:50,316 --> 01:34:54,654
...and to ensure that this type of
behavior will never be tolerated again.

1041
01:34:56,322 --> 01:34:58,115
That would be nice.

1042
01:34:58,532 --> 01:35:02,495
Let me introduce Roberta Alspaugh
of the Fifth Circuit Court.

1043
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,121
How do you do, ma'am?

1044
01:35:04,205 --> 01:35:06,540
Are you sure you're well enough?

1045
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:10,836
I'm ready to talk if you're ready to listen.

1046
01:35:11,254 --> 01:35:12,505
All right.

1047
01:35:13,214 --> 01:35:16,842
- Miss Jackson, I'll leave you now.
- Senator, thank you.

1048
01:35:18,511 --> 01:35:22,640
- We'll be leaving for Washington.
- Hey buddy, we'll be back later.

1049
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:27,436
Mr. Toscani...

1050
01:35:27,728 --> 01:35:31,065
...can you tell us about
your military background?

1051
01:35:35,236 --> 01:35:38,573
In 1973, I worked for
a special operations group...

1052
01:35:39,865 --> 01:35:42,034
...in Vietnam and Cambodia.

1053
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:45,788
I was involved with gathering intelligence.

1054
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:50,209
All of the members of this team
were doctors recruited by the CIA...

1055
01:35:50,918 --> 01:35:54,422
...and trained at a secret camp
in Langley, Virginia.

1056
01:36:06,642 --> 01:36:10,229
Gentlemen, whenever you have a group
of individuals...

1057
01:36:10,688 --> 01:36:12,899
... who are beyond any investigation...

1058
01:36:12,982 --> 01:36:17,278
... who can manipulate the press,
judges, members of our Congress...

1059
01:36:18,234 --> 01:36:22,456
... you'll have within our government
those who are above the law.

1060
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
