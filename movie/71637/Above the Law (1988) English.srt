1
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:39,156
I was born in Palermo, Sicily.

2
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:42,887
We came to this country when I was seven.
We immigrated to Chicago.

3
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:46,599
We were always raised to be very
patriotic, to love our country.

4
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:48,101
And we did.

5
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,021
When I was a little boy,
my father took me to a baseball game.

6
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:55,900
They had a martial arts demonstration
and I saw this old Japanese man...

7
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:59,112
... doing things that I thought
were magical...

8
00:00:59,654 --> 00:01:02,240
... and I developed a crazy dream
to go to the Far East.

9
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:06,161
By the time I was 17, I was there,
studying with the masters.

10
00:02:56,688 --> 00:03:01,734
In 1969 I was invited by a friend of mine
to an American Embassy party in Tokyo.

11
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:07,073
While I was there, there was a crazy,
drunk guy named Nelson Fox.

12
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:09,367
He recruited me into the CIA.

13
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:11,744
I was 22 at the time.

14
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:14,456
My eyes were about to be opened.

15
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,662
My friends, let me make one thing clear:

16
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,790
This is a nation of laws.

17
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:59,042
And as Abraham Lincoln had said:

18
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,420
No one is above the law,
no one is below the law."

19
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:04,339
And we're going to enforce the law!

20
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:08,760
And Americans should remember that,
if we are to have law and order!

21
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:25,170
You ever seen
chemical interrogation before?

22
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:27,422
These assholes are Agency?

23
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,674
We all get paid by the CIA.

24
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:33,761
But these guys are from a page
that ain't even in the book.

25
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:00,455
Don't die on me, you sucker!

26
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:02,457
What the hell's wrong?

27
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,127
This pussy, he just can't hold his liquor.

28
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:10,882
Doc, he's dead.

29
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:13,218
Get him the fuck out of here.

30
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:16,221
- Move it. Let's go.
- Come on!

31
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:19,474
- Get him out.
- Get him out of here.

32
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,322
So, my little doctor bag doesn't scare you?

33
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:36,574
I'm not scared.

34
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:39,285
You speak English.

35
00:06:39,994 --> 00:06:41,162
How nice.

36
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:44,124
Where's the load, Colonel?

37
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,927
I'm gonna teach you never...

38
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,304
...never to fuck with my opium.

39
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,973
Oh, boy.

40
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:02,559
He's a hard one, Doc.

41
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:06,646
You took it from the French,
you took it from the Chinks.

42
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,650
And you'll be damned
if a Yankee's going to start you talking.

43
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:14,529
But you're gonna sing for me.
You're gonna sing like a choir!

44
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:18,199
What does this have to do
with military intelligence?

45
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:24,205
Who the fuck is this cherry?

46
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:27,876
Your orders, Toscani,
were to assist and observe.

47
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:30,587
Just back off, partner.

48
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:40,180
I'm gonna start cutting you off
at the ankles.

49
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:46,895
Then I'm gonna take your feet
and throw them right in the basket.

50
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:48,396
Cute, huh?

51
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:50,607
Shut up, Nico.

52
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:53,485
Look, I can make you disappear.

53
00:07:58,406 --> 00:07:59,908
Grab his leg.

54
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,328
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- Nico!

55
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:10,960
You think you're soldiers?
You're fucking barbarians!

56
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:14,798
Get out!

57
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:22,263
Get back to the LZ.

58
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:25,517
If I don't cap him now,
he's gonna do me later.

59
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:28,019
I'll call a chopper in
for us. I'll cover this.

60
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:30,271
Just get the hell out of here!

61
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:31,189
Come on, move!

62
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:33,108
Bring him back here!

63
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:38,655
Nobody move! Everybody stay
on that damn porch!

64
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:42,492
Go, Nico!

65
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:48,248
Nelson, I'm through. I'm finished!

66
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:03,138
Nicola, Sara,
what name do you give your child?

67
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:04,848
Giuliano Nicola.

68
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,476
Giuliano...

69
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:11,229
...you have become a new creation.

70
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:14,065
With the help of your family and friends...

71
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:17,110
...we bring your Christian dignity
unstained...

72
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:19,988
...into the everlasting life of heaven.

73
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:24,284
- Come on. You always make me late.
- I'm the boss. You have to drive me!

74
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:27,662
I'll trace the sign of the Cross
upon your forehead...

75
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:30,832
...and I invite your parents to do the same.

76
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:36,504
In the name of the Father, the Son...

77
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:39,048
...and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

78
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:43,011
Look at him. He's such a good baby.

79
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,561
That's beautiful.

80
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:10,121
- I know you're the boss but...
- That's right. Remember that.

81
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:11,289
Hi, guys.

82
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:12,916
Hey, how are you?

83
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,126
You guys look so good!

84
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,546
We haven't done anything.
We're clean. Some of us, anyway.

85
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,300
Well, Lieutenant, eight more days
and you're gonna miss me.

86
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,635
Parts of you, anyway.

87
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:25,094
You see this cop?

88
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:28,640
This one. This one here.
She could bust me anytime.

89
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,642
Look at that! Look at that!

90
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:32,852
- This is the partner?
- This is the partner.

91
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:35,647
I got dressed up because
you told me you were wearing a tux.

92
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,566
You look fabulous.
She goes to work looking like this?

93
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,569
This girl, sometimes she comes
in just lingerie.

94
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,241
Don't tell our secrets. She's never gonna
let you out with me again.

95
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:52,664
I told you guys to have a good time,
but take it easy, will you?

96
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:54,958
Toscani holds the record
for having more relatives...

97
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,253
...under federal indictment
than any other cop in the city.

98
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:00,463
Look at those stiff dicks.

99
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:03,758
A free meal and they come out like flies.

100
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:06,136
Hey, you greaseball bastards!

101
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:08,680
Didn't we buy that monkey once?

102
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:15,019
Rosa, I'm so worried. So worried.

103
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:23,903
- What's wrong?
- Nico!

104
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:27,198
Isn't today a day you should be happy?

105
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:30,410
- What's wrong?
- It's Lucia. She's gone again.

106
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:33,455
- Is it that boy?
"- S�", Nico.

107
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,879
I have to go to work right now.
You gonna be at the bakery later?

108
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:41,504
S�.

109
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:45,550
I'll come by the bakery and we'll talk.
Maybe I can do something.

110
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,844
Thank you, Nico. Thank you.

111
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,975
Lester, this is Unit 10, Tango-X-ray.

112
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:56,895
We're up and clear. You got that?

113
00:11:56,978 --> 00:12:01,149
Delores, Toscani told me he'll watch
over you and take care of you real good...

114
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:02,692
... your last week on the street.

115
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:05,570
Never had a friend who was a DA before.

116
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:12,744
I'm gonna take a piss and be right back.

117
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:14,287
- Here?
- Yeah.

118
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,381
She's fine, ain't she?

119
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:30,762
Excuse me, I just had to stop and tell you...

120
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:34,599
...you look like the sun setting
on a waterfall in the springtime.

121
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:37,685
And you got five seconds, and three are up.

122
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:40,021
You ain't got to be...

123
00:12:41,898 --> 00:12:44,651
Lady cops need boyfriends, too, you dig?

124
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:47,529
But you have a nice day, just the same.

125
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:54,953
Nothing but trouble coming
in my place tonight.

126
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:56,704
I know this one.

127
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,585
You seen this girl?

128
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:04,462
I ain't seen shit.

129
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,048
You haven't seen this girl?

130
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:10,677
Hey, Schifo, how you doing?

131
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:15,515
- You seen this girl?
- You know I quit messing with that stuff.

132
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:18,560
- I ain't into this shit anymore.
- What are you into?

133
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:20,895
Why don't the fuck
you assholes leave me alone?

134
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:23,356
- I paid your boy off Monday night.
- My boys, huh?

135
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,777
Now take some of that fucking money
and buy your mama a condominium.

136
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,906
I thought this was a kosher bar, man.
No pork allowed.

137
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:40,707
Say, man, you seen this girl?

138
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,586
I seen the top of her head.

139
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:49,716
That's good.

140
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:07,911
Stop this motherfucker.
He's crazy. Where's my piece?

141
00:14:09,537 --> 00:14:12,999
He ain't nothing. Take him out.
He's motherfucking crazy.

142
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,335
He's a fucking Italian puke!

143
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,963
Freeze, motherfucker!

144
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:24,052
Come on, man. Please. Put the gun away.

145
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:38,566
All right. Who else wants some?

146
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,568
You're destroying the image of my place.

147
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:43,780
You'll never be the fucking man.
You'll never be the man.

148
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:45,407
Get over here!

149
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:48,076
Hold it, man. Don't do me ugly.

150
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,080
Listen. I know where the chick is.
She's upstairs.

151
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:55,583
- Yeah? She's upstairs?
- 2-C. I swear, man. It's 2-C.

152
00:15:03,842 --> 00:15:05,593
This isn't what it looks like.

153
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:07,470
Listen, he's my cousin. He's a cop.

154
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:09,597
I didn't know they had all of this.

155
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,182
Get out of here.

156
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:14,728
You having a good time?

157
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,312
Pretty good time.

158
00:15:19,357 --> 00:15:22,152
What is this shit? You wanna get high?

159
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,487
You wanna get high?

160
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,998
You're acting stupid, man! Stop it!

161
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,504
Stop. You playing the cop, I'm tired of it.

162
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,841
I'll show you what time is
'cause you'll do tall time.

163
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:43,761
Just take it, it's yours.
Three grand. It's in the mattress.

164
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,264
You want to fucking bribe me, man?

165
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,933
Put your clothes on. We're going home.

166
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,309
Stop it.

167
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:53,229
I'm tired of you. You shut up!

168
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:56,983
Don't you understand that there are people
out there who love you.

169
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:59,777
Right. Keep talking. Keep flapping.

170
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:02,363
In my business!

171
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,492
Is this your school stuff?

172
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:10,705
It's my math homework and my history.
You gonna write me another note, Nico?

173
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:12,456
Come on. We're going home.

174
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,792
No, you go home. I'm tired.

175
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:18,546
I'll give you something, something big.

176
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:19,463
Oh, yeah?

177
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:23,509
This is huge, my man.
It's a shipment coming in next Tuesday.

178
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:26,512
What the hell do you know
about a shipment?

179
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:29,056
This is square, on my mother's soul.

180
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,310
You gotta believe me, man.
You can't set me up.

181
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:36,898
I heard it from a hooker friend who's
banging this big coke lawyer. He told her.

182
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,524
- What lawyer?
- I don't know.

183
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:40,109
What do you mean you don't know?

184
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:42,612
Carlos Abandano. That's the one.

185
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:46,574
Better fucking pray to God
you ain't bullshitting me...

186
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:49,827
...or I'll come back and tear
your heart out. Let's go.

187
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:55,458
Who are you?

188
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,542
Get back!

189
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,211
I own this place!

190
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:01,005
I own this joint.

191
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:04,509
There's a guy upstairs.
I want to get him arrested!

192
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:10,223
- That's the motherfucker right there!
- These two guys are under arrest.

193
00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:12,808
It's a cesspool in there. Check it out.

194
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:17,230
Boy, you got some strange toilet habits.

195
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:19,524
I'm gonna take her home and clean her up.

196
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:22,735
I don't want to take her
to her grandmother like this.

197
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,686
Jax, I hate these cocaine lawyers.

198
00:17:58,187 --> 00:17:59,856
And this shitty weather.

199
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,027
They're gonna have me serving time.

200
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,865
I wish you'd relax, hon.
This'll never get into court.

201
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:10,658
Except against us.

202
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:14,620
I don't care how
I have to get at these guys...

203
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:15,621
Let me reiterate.

204
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:20,042
You said you were going to protect
my butt and be my guardian angel.

205
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:21,627
Hang on, hang on.

206
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:25,631
There is an engine block
clearing customs...

207
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:28,384
...Tuesday, 10:00 pickup.

208
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,180
Fulton Meat Market.

209
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:35,725
An engine block?

210
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:43,816
Clever, clever, guys.

211
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:56,204
I'd like an '86 Lincoln...

212
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:59,165
...IIlinois 354-DOG-6"7", please.

213
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:07,757
Ramone Chi Chi Testamente,
a Salvadoran national with quite a record.

214
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:10,343
Remember, you were harping on me
about having a date.

215
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:11,928
Dream on, baby.

216
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:16,432
I want to tell you, what I turned down
tonight, you could never come close to.

217
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:20,269
You should become a science-fiction
writer, instead of a cop or a DA...

218
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:22,104
...with that imagination you got.

219
00:19:22,188 --> 00:19:23,689
You're right.

220
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,698
How you doing, Mr. Abandano?

221
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,369
Chi Chi, how you doing?

222
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:46,796
- I do not like this place.
- You do not like this place?

223
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:50,883
No, I don't want to go into this place.
You know I hate places like this.

224
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,594
- What don't you like about it?
- The element!

225
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:56,806
You know something, darling?

226
00:19:56,973 --> 00:20:00,476
I really think that you
should lighten up, because...

227
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:03,437
...we're gonna party.

228
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:11,737
This is my lawyer. Say hello.

229
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:19,287
- Two for dinner?
- Just drinks.

230
00:20:31,257 --> 00:20:32,633
Good work.

231
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,094
I don't believe it.

232
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:40,057
Sit down here. You're gonna love
this place. I promise.

233
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:45,813
Salvano, the fucking cockroach.

234
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:50,943
I don't believe this. You always do this
to me in front of people.

235
00:20:57,783 --> 00:20:59,368
That is beautiful.

236
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:02,914
Excuse me.

237
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,123
I love it.

238
00:21:04,373 --> 00:21:07,126
You'll have your engine block
on Tuesday, Boss.

239
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:11,964
If this happened a week from Tuesday,
I could read about it in the paper.

240
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:14,383
Relax. It'll make you famous.

241
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:17,220
Just what I need, to be famous.

242
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:31,734
Can you believe this?

243
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:37,365
Lieutenant Strozah, meet those two cops
in the back alley.

244
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:46,165
We got it down pretty good.

245
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:48,751
We got guys in the front,
we got a couple of cars out back.

246
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:50,336
Sealed off pretty good.

247
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:52,421
Three of our best guys.
I handpicked each one.

248
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:54,924
Jackson, Lukich, Nico. They're all topshelf.

249
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:57,343
They know how to do this.
They've done it before.

250
00:21:57,426 --> 00:21:59,762
I can tell how much you love it here.

251
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:02,932
God! Now I know why I'm a vegetarian.

252
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:05,351
You eat meat. I know you eat meat.

253
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:08,145
- I'm gonna throw up.
- I've heard you eat meat.

254
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:13,818
Nico, keep the channel clear.
Don't embarrass us.

255
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:17,446
Right over there.
Two guys in the alley over there.

256
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:19,532
Definitely the Feds.

257
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,912
Frank, it's fucking infested down here.
What are you trying to do to us?

258
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:27,039
Someone from downtown got wind of it.
Don't worry.

259
00:22:27,123 --> 00:22:30,209
They're trying to make points.
Just handle the pinch.

260
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:32,879
This ain't a bust, it's a fucking convention.

261
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:34,630
I don't believe this.

262
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:39,468
Look at this, boys. Here we go.

263
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:47,018
Here we go. Jackson, stay back.

264
00:22:52,982 --> 00:22:55,484
I think they made you.
You're too pretty to be a meatpacker.

265
00:22:55,568 --> 00:22:57,737
It's going down, boys. Let's go.

266
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:01,407
Keep your heads up.

267
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:03,409
Woman, let's do it.

268
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:11,292
The cars are going around the corner.

269
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:22,011
Come on, Nico. Lukich, get up there.

270
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:36,108
What do you think?

271
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:37,693
Looks good.

272
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:41,113
Let's get on with it.

273
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:57,213
- What the fuck are you assholes doing?
- Feds!

274
00:23:57,296 --> 00:23:59,549
Shit! They jumped too soon!

275
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:04,095
What the fuck is this?

276
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:05,555
Freeze! Police!

277
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:19,068
Get back!

278
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,678
Nico, the Lincoln!

279
00:24:55,021 --> 00:24:56,105
Nico!

280
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:09,410
Chi Chi!

281
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:14,332
Nico!

282
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:16,542
Nico!

283
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,630
Fucking animal!

284
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:23,216
Get rid of him!

285
00:25:25,384 --> 00:25:27,053
I'm out! Do him!

286
00:25:34,227 --> 00:25:37,104
He's still on the roof! Get rid of him!

287
00:25:41,651 --> 00:25:43,402
Where do I go? What do I do?

288
00:25:43,486 --> 00:25:45,571
Hit those hooks over there!

289
00:26:21,302 --> 00:26:22,804
What do I do?

290
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:25,473
Stop the fucking car!

291
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:29,394
Stop the fucking car!

292
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,910
Hands up! Out of the car!

293
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,711
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You scared me to death!

294
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,546
Nico, you okay?

295
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:00,216
- Wait till you hear about...
- Shut the fuck up!

296
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,385
You make a nice hood ornament, Sarge.

297
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:04,888
- Come on!
- Gotta get this garbage out of here.

298
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:08,474
You gonna lose your license
driving around like that.

299
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,146
Let's go.

300
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:21,362
What do we got here?

301
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:26,493
What kind of high is this?

302
00:27:28,453 --> 00:27:29,787
Sky-high.

303
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:32,415
Military explosives.

304
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:37,962
C-4, my man.

305
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:47,931
Hey, Boss...

306
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:51,267
...you can see your place
from the office of the FBI.

307
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:53,019
Ain't that something?

308
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:56,105
- Your name again?
- Agent Neeley, Chicago office.

309
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:01,861
The arresting officer, Toscani.
What does he do?

310
00:28:01,945 --> 00:28:05,365
- He's a tac sergeant, CPD Vice.
- Hold on a minute...

311
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:07,075
I'll tell you what this cop is.

312
00:28:07,158 --> 00:28:10,286
He's a fucking menace.
He almost strangled me!

313
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,456
Your problem is being
taken care of right now.

314
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,502
It should've been handled 12 hours ago
when my throat was in one piece!

315
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:20,255
I don't know who's running
this outfit here...

316
00:28:20,338 --> 00:28:24,676
...but I'll tell you one thing:
Somebody better get his wires straight.

317
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:28,304
You don't know who you're dealing with.

318
00:28:28,388 --> 00:28:31,850
This maniac should be wearing a number,
not a badge!

319
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,562
- The director does not want a problem.
- There won't be one.

320
00:28:35,645 --> 00:28:37,605
And I don't want any problems.

321
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:38,523
I understand.

322
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:41,901
Just listen.
They are to be released immediately.

323
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,695
You can count on it.

324
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:45,321
Avoid all contacts.

325
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:48,366
You'll have the Bureau's full cooperation.

326
00:28:54,706 --> 00:28:56,416
You're free to go.

327
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:00,378
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

328
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:19,355
Good work. I loved the face of that
FBI guy when the call came through.

329
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,983
Salvano.

330
00:29:27,071 --> 00:29:29,449
I don't want any more problems.

331
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:32,160
I don't enjoy babysitting.

332
00:29:35,455 --> 00:29:38,458
Everything is going to be all right
from now on.

333
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,627
I promise you, Mr. Zagon.

334
00:29:48,718 --> 00:29:52,305
Attention, please. Attention, everyone.
Please, guys.

335
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:55,308
I just want to get a few things
straightened out.

336
00:29:55,391 --> 00:30:00,104
A few minutes ago, I received a call from
the First Deputy Superintendent's office.

337
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:04,567
As we all know, possession of these kinds
of explosives is a federal offense...

338
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:08,404
...and falls under the jurisdiction
of the federal agencies represented here.

339
00:30:08,488 --> 00:30:10,824
What kind of bullshit is that?

340
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:14,244
The Feds come in, the doors close,
nobody hears, smells or sees anything.

341
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:15,537
And that's no answer.

342
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,122
It's no answer to why
the biggest drug dealer in the city...

343
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:20,375
...is out on the street
as free as a fucking bird!

344
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:24,254
Keep it in your pants, all right. These
men have a job to do, just like we do.

345
00:30:24,337 --> 00:30:26,798
It's their game, let them play it.

346
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:32,762
What I'm about to say
does not leave this room. Is that clear?

347
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,224
Mr. Salvano has been working
for some time...

348
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:39,102
...in cooperation
with certain federal agencies.

349
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:43,857
I'm not at liberty to divulge the nature
or extent of Mr. Salvano's involvement.

350
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:47,527
I just learned of its existence myself
a few hours ago.

351
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,697
One thing I can tell you
is that Mr. Salvano's role...

352
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,701
...is crucial to an extremely
sensitive, ongoing investigation.

353
00:30:54,784 --> 00:30:55,827
Any surveillance...

354
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:00,874
...harassment or unauthorized operations
against this individual are forbidden.

355
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:05,044
I order all of you, with due respect
for your work and your courage...

356
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:06,629
...to stand down.

357
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:12,635
Why don't you assholes
stand down on this?

358
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:22,896
You're gonna need me.

359
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:25,481
Need you. For what?

360
00:31:25,815 --> 00:31:27,734
To get your ass out of jail.

361
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:29,944
You think you can afford my bail?

362
00:31:30,195 --> 00:31:31,154
No.

363
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:33,406
Neither do I. Not on this pay.

364
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,659
You'll end up in jail for a long time,
I have the strangest feeling.

365
00:31:36,743 --> 00:31:39,370
You're jealous 'cause I'm gonna stay a cop.

366
00:31:39,662 --> 00:31:42,540
What the fuck is this? Go back to work.

367
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:49,756
Here we go.

368
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:58,241
What are you thinking?

369
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:21,848
Isn't this your mother's church?

370
00:33:22,307 --> 00:33:25,768
Yes, but I'll bet she hasn't
seen these boys in the choir.

371
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:49,250
Hey, Nico!

372
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:51,377
I can't believe you're in church
without your family.

373
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:52,712
Hello, Father. How are you?

374
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:54,464
This must be your partner in crime.

375
00:33:54,547 --> 00:33:56,341
- Delores Jackson.
- I'm Father Gennaro.

376
00:33:56,424 --> 00:33:58,301
I saw you at the baptismal party.

377
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:00,970
- Nico, we gotta go!
- No, please. Wait.

378
00:34:01,888 --> 00:34:03,431
God, it's good you're here.

379
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:05,975
If you got a few minutes,
there's something I'd like to show you.

380
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,310
Please.

381
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,773
I haven't been down here since I was a kid.

382
00:34:21,908 --> 00:34:23,368
What's this?

383
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:25,829
The rats are getting bigger.

384
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:31,376
- When did this happen?
- Two nights ago. I didn't call the police.

385
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:34,087
What do they want, the bingo receipts?

386
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,662
These are friends.

387
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:09,956
Father Tomasino, this is Nico.

388
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:11,583
- Mucho gusto, Padre.
- How do you do?

389
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,668
- Sister Mary.
- Hi, Nico.

390
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:16,087
- Delores.
- How do you do, Father?

391
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:18,423
- Se�ora, mucho gusto.
- Hello.

392
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:23,928
My friend, Father Tomasino,
is working with the sanctuary movement.

393
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:25,305
He's visiting...

394
00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:29,642
...helping his people work out
some of their immigration problems.

395
00:35:30,977 --> 00:35:34,063
Sorry to have troubled you.
Nico, we must go.

396
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:36,900
Gracias.

397
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:40,862
Nice meeting you, sir.

398
00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:43,573
Bye-bye.

399
00:35:58,463 --> 00:36:01,633
- How long have those people been here?
- Too long.

400
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:04,511
At least the children go to our school.

401
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:07,388
Who do you think broke into the room?

402
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:10,892
Kids, maybe. Maybe worse.
It's not the first time.

403
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:14,729
Would you like us to send a car
to check on you?

404
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:17,774
No, please. Police frighten these people.

405
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:21,861
I know what you mean.
They frighten me, too.

406
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,991
It's too far out of your way.
I can't ask you to go to that much trouble.

407
00:36:27,075 --> 00:36:29,327
Look, I really don't mind coming by.

408
00:36:29,452 --> 00:36:31,579
Promise, okay? All right?

409
00:36:32,705 --> 00:36:36,209
Say, Nico, by the way,
when was your last confession?

410
00:36:37,585 --> 00:36:39,128
My last confession?

411
00:36:39,212 --> 00:36:42,298
I'm a married man.
I have no sins to confess.

412
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:46,636
You're a police officer.
You got a lot of sins to confess.

413
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,555
He's got your number!

414
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,893
- Is that your impression of police officers?
- I want to see you in church Sunday, okay?

415
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:56,938
I feel better when you're in church, okay?

416
00:36:57,188 --> 00:36:59,566
You don't show up, I'll call your mother!

417
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:02,068
I wish you would. She loves you.

418
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:05,905
Why don't you go to church?
It'll be good for you.

419
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,074
Get your soul saved.

420
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:27,468
Our leaders tell us...

421
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:30,180
...and talk to us about them and us.

422
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:34,559
But almighty God talks to us...

423
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:37,729
...about all of mankind...

424
00:37:39,606 --> 00:37:40,940
...as one.

425
00:37:41,608 --> 00:37:43,902
Now, we have an obligation...

426
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:47,155
...to find out what is the truth.

427
00:37:48,948 --> 00:37:51,743
We need to study. We need to question.

428
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,580
We need to read and we need to find out...

429
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:58,249
...what they are doing in our name.

430
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:04,172
And we must support those brave souls...

431
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:06,799
...who seek...

432
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:09,260
...the truth.

433
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:13,139
God bless us. Amen.

434
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:04,816
Get down!

435
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,618
There's nothing else we can do.

436
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:02,624
Lord God, Heavenly Father...

437
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:07,253
...receive the soul of our dear
departed friend, Father Joseph Gennaro.

438
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:13,426
Come on.

439
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:26,689
Get a list of everybody treated here today.
Everybody.

440
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:29,025
Find those sanctuary people...

441
00:40:29,108 --> 00:40:32,779
...the ones we found hiding
in the bottom of the church.

442
00:40:33,112 --> 00:40:37,367
I want to know where they're from
and who might want to harm them.

443
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,036
Where are you gonna be?

444
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:42,914
Just stay by the radio. I'll find you.

445
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:02,433
- He didn't make it.
- Oh, Nico!

446
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:04,018
Oh, no!

447
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:18,491
Lieutenant Strozah, these are
FBI agents: Halloran, Neeley.

448
00:41:23,997 --> 00:41:28,168
Sweetheart, go to the car.
I'll be right there, okay? Take Mama.

449
00:41:33,506 --> 00:41:36,384
Nico, you okay? How's the family doing?

450
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:40,847
Excuse me. I'd like to have a word
with you.

451
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:42,390
Alone.

452
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:56,863
What the hell is it?

453
00:41:56,946 --> 00:41:59,532
It's you, that's what the fuck it is!

454
00:41:59,782 --> 00:42:01,284
Keep your goddamn hands off me!

455
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:03,411
- You let Salvano walk.
- Salvano?

456
00:42:03,703 --> 00:42:04,037
Yeah.

457
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,122
What are you, crazy?
What does he have to do with this?

458
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:08,249
That was no cherry bomb, that was C-4.

459
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:11,920
I've used that shit. I know what it
smells like and what it blows like.

460
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:16,299
Salvano never came near that C-4.
It's in federal holding right now.

461
00:42:16,382 --> 00:42:19,135
Besides, why would Salvano
blow up a church?

462
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:21,137
I tailed him two days ago.

463
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:25,183
He and his goon were in that church
and they weren't taking communion.

464
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:28,478
I saw the woman who planted the bomb
and she was with Salvano's lawyer.

465
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:30,730
Now, I want some fucking answers.

466
00:42:30,855 --> 00:42:32,815
You tailed him after I ordered you off?

467
00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:35,318
I want to know where Salvano is.

468
00:42:35,902 --> 00:42:39,072
My orders were to release him,
not babysit him.

469
00:42:39,906 --> 00:42:42,158
You think you're rough stuff.

470
00:42:42,242 --> 00:42:45,954
Martial arts hero, chop-suey crap!
Let me tell you something.

471
00:42:46,037 --> 00:42:49,165
You're not bulletproof.
You're not even a good cop.

472
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:51,751
You sneak around
playing your street-dick games...

473
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:56,297
...and all you come up with is conjecture,
wild coincidence and bullshit!

474
00:42:56,381 --> 00:43:00,301
I want the name of the federal agent
who signed for those explosives.

475
00:43:00,385 --> 00:43:02,178
You do your job, I'll do mine.

476
00:43:02,262 --> 00:43:03,930
Bank on it, pal.

477
00:44:16,085 --> 00:44:17,504
- Gentlemen.
- Hello.

478
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:19,506
Hi, how are you doing?

479
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:30,350
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

480
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:34,687
The wallet. Let me see it.

481
00:44:38,525 --> 00:44:40,610
Aide to Senator Harrison.

482
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:55,333
I hope I find you, you greasy mother!
I'm gonna kick your ass!

483
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,169
Who the fuck do you think you are?

484
00:45:05,385 --> 00:45:10,265
I'm in front of St. Mary's church, where
seven people were killed by a bomb...

485
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:52,974
- You guys stay out of trouble.
- Okay, Nico.

486
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:01,065
- I hear you're looking for Salvano.
- You heard that?

487
00:46:01,149 --> 00:46:02,275
I know where he's at.

488
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:05,195
- Where's that?
- Right here, motherfucker!

489
00:46:05,445 --> 00:46:09,199
- It's a long way from Kansas, Dorothy!
- Relax, man. Relax.

490
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:12,994
I won't shoot you.
These guys will beat you to death.

491
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:15,330
You come to our neighborhood,
fuck with our people.

492
00:46:15,413 --> 00:46:18,374
Now our people are going to fuck with you.

493
00:46:42,106 --> 00:46:43,817
We need a doctor!

494
00:46:46,694 --> 00:46:48,029
Fuck him up!

495
00:46:48,112 --> 00:46:49,781
You motherfucker!

496
00:47:48,171 --> 00:47:50,882
Don't kill me! Please don't kill me!

497
00:47:51,841 --> 00:47:53,218
- Who sent you?
- Nobody!

498
00:47:53,301 --> 00:47:55,637
"Nobody?" You did this for fun?

499
00:47:59,307 --> 00:48:00,892
Jimmy Costanza!

500
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:06,815
If I find out you're lying, I'll come back
and kill you in your own kitchen.

501
00:48:06,898 --> 00:48:08,108
Salvano!

502
00:48:08,692 --> 00:48:10,193
Bautista Salvano!

503
00:48:13,113 --> 00:48:16,241
- That's my buddy, man.
- Yeah, man, I know him.

504
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,912
Sic him, Bulldog.

505
00:48:20,996 --> 00:48:24,249
- Why are you fuckin' with my friend?
- I'm not in the mood.

506
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:26,126
Fuck your mood, man.

507
00:48:31,715 --> 00:48:33,633
- What's happening?
- What it be like, homey?

508
00:48:33,717 --> 00:48:35,343
- That was real good, man.
- Peace, brother.

509
00:48:35,844 --> 00:48:39,889
The mayor has announced the city's offer
of a $25,000 reward for information...

510
00:48:39,973 --> 00:48:43,143
... leading to the arrest and conviction
of anyone responsible...

511
00:48:43,226 --> 00:48:46,062
... for today's tragic
St. Mary's church bombing.

512
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,648
Why were we in church?

513
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:51,276
I'll tell you what.

514
00:48:52,694 --> 00:48:57,157
I'm willing to break the rules and
I'm willing to tell you everything I know.

515
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,159
I just want some time.

516
00:49:02,078 --> 00:49:03,788
It's probably Jax.

517
00:49:04,748 --> 00:49:06,583
Yeah, Jax. This better be good.

518
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,084
It's bad, Nico.

519
00:49:09,919 --> 00:49:11,671
Long time, Nelson.

520
00:49:13,256 --> 00:49:17,510
Come on, man! You know better
than to use a name on an open line.

521
00:49:19,262 --> 00:49:22,932
I'm gonna talk for 15 seconds,
and then I'm getting off.

522
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:27,604
You're in trouble, Nico.
Serious, serious trouble.

523
00:49:29,022 --> 00:49:31,274
Really? That's fascinating.

524
00:49:31,816 --> 00:49:35,028
Take your wife and family
and get them someplace safe, now!

525
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:38,740
I've been wanting to bring my family
to Switzerland. I just haven't had time.

526
00:49:38,823 --> 00:49:42,619
You hear me? Now!
I'm risking my ass by telling you this.

527
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:46,498
Okay, don't take so long
to call me next time.

528
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,458
Good luck, "pais�".

529
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:05,567
Why is the CIA calling you
at 2:00 in the morning?

530
00:50:07,611 --> 00:50:09,988
Because Fox is a crazy asshole.

531
00:50:11,615 --> 00:50:16,077
He gets drunk, he forgets he's halfway
around the world, and he calls.

532
00:50:18,955 --> 00:50:22,876
He says he just wanted to know
if we got his Christmas card.

533
00:50:23,794 --> 00:50:25,921
Listen, don't be that way.

534
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,466
- I'm just so scared.
- Don't be.

535
00:50:29,966 --> 00:50:33,053
I'm gonna take care of everything,
all right?

536
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:36,973
All right?

537
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,401
Nico, who's there?

538
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:06,503
O'Hara, what's going on, man?
Isn't it a little early for breakfast?

539
00:51:06,586 --> 00:51:08,255
Nico, how you doing?

540
00:51:08,588 --> 00:51:10,507
I'm sorry. I gotta take you downtown.

541
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:12,759
The Feds want to talk. It'll work out.

542
00:51:12,843 --> 00:51:15,011
Here's the warrant, Toscani.

543
00:51:18,348 --> 00:51:20,142
You fucking piece of shit.

544
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:22,352
I'll take that, thank you.

545
00:51:22,686 --> 00:51:26,731
Easy guys! He's my friend. Take it easy.
It's gonna work out. Let's go.

546
00:51:26,815 --> 00:51:29,818
It'll work out. I'm real sorry about this.

547
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,035
It's not necessary! This is ridiculous!

548
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,289
Let him play his pussy game.
This is his setup.

549
00:51:42,914 --> 00:51:46,084
Who do you think you are coming here
and treating my son like a criminal?

550
00:51:46,168 --> 00:51:47,586
Who do you think you are?

551
00:51:47,669 --> 00:51:51,047
- Just stop it! There's an infant here!
- Easy, easy.

552
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:56,803
- Check that coat.
- Why don't you come check it, asshole.

553
00:51:57,637 --> 00:51:58,555
Take it easy!

554
00:51:58,638 --> 00:52:01,641
Why don't you come
and put your hands on me!

555
00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:06,813
- Get him out of here!
- Everything's gonna work out.

556
00:52:06,897 --> 00:52:09,649
Come on. I'll be back in three hours!

557
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:14,529
The Police Association's
got lawyers for this!

558
00:52:16,031 --> 00:52:17,741
You can't do this!

559
00:52:25,415 --> 00:52:29,002
This guy, in the middle of the day,
comes in my place and starts wrecking it.

560
00:52:29,085 --> 00:52:31,171
He assaults my customers.

561
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:36,426
He starts doing all this outer-space stuff,
putting my customers in orbit even.

562
00:52:38,136 --> 00:52:40,972
I remember those violations
you told me he was guilty of.

563
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:43,391
Look, this is my boy, right here.

564
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:45,268
They finally got you, huh?

565
00:52:45,352 --> 00:52:47,229
They finally got you, motherfucker.

566
00:52:47,312 --> 00:52:49,815
I told you it was gonna go down.
Should've listened...

567
00:52:49,898 --> 00:52:50,774
There he is.

568
00:52:50,857 --> 00:52:54,194
You guys got one hell
of a police department around here.

569
00:52:54,277 --> 00:52:56,738
I got a cousin in the department
in New Orleans.

570
00:52:56,822 --> 00:52:59,074
You ever heard of Bob Bouquet?

571
00:53:07,415 --> 00:53:09,584
Put your ass in that chair.

572
00:53:13,088 --> 00:53:16,091
Illegal wiretaps, unauthorized surveillance.

573
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:18,760
When was this guy born?

574
00:53:18,844 --> 00:53:22,514
You're quite a cop, Toscani.
You don't listen to anybody, do you?

575
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:25,058
- Where's Jax?
- She's out of this!

576
00:53:25,142 --> 00:53:27,060
You're the rotten apple in this barrel.

577
00:53:27,144 --> 00:53:29,980
We don't need to look any farther
than you and your family.

578
00:53:30,063 --> 00:53:31,898
- You, mother...
- Nico!

579
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:35,277
Do you want to go to prison?

580
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:37,904
Unlawful entry.

581
00:53:38,155 --> 00:53:40,949
- IIlegal search and seizure.
- Deputy...

582
00:53:43,827 --> 00:53:46,788
Who do you think is pulling their strings?

583
00:53:47,372 --> 00:53:49,749
Who do you think they work for?

584
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,878
You were ordered to back off on Salvano.

585
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:56,715
I suppose you had too big a hard-on
for that, didn't you?

586
00:53:57,174 --> 00:53:59,426
You can't be in on this, Fred.

587
00:54:01,052 --> 00:54:03,763
You're officially suspended, Toscani.

588
00:54:04,347 --> 00:54:06,725
I want your badge and your gun.

589
00:54:14,024 --> 00:54:15,775
You gonna hold me?

590
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:18,153
You can walk for now.

591
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:20,864
Don't walk far.

592
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:32,000
Sara, I'm all right.

593
00:54:33,043 --> 00:54:35,170
It's okay, and I love you.

594
00:54:37,547 --> 00:54:40,133
Tell Mama not to worry. All right?

595
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:42,302
I love you. 'Bye.

596
00:54:43,887 --> 00:54:46,223
What the hell is going on?
What's happening here?

597
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:51,186
The sanctuary people, they're refugees
from El Salvador, Guatemala and Chile.

598
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,147
They're terrified of cops.
They're not even talking to me.

599
00:54:54,231 --> 00:54:58,652
Down at the morgue, they got a guy
who was not a congregation member.

600
00:54:59,903 --> 00:55:01,404
Alan Singletary.

601
00:55:02,364 --> 00:55:05,826
He's an aide to Senator Harrison.
The Foreign Relations Committee Harrison.

602
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:10,122
The guy who's been crawling all over
the Central American drug connections.

603
00:55:10,956 --> 00:55:12,499
You're gonna make a hell of a DA.

604
00:55:12,582 --> 00:55:16,670
Harrison's staff has been compiling
some kind of heavyweight white paper.

605
00:55:17,003 --> 00:55:21,133
It implicates some of the major
intelligence agencies in drug trafficking.

606
00:55:21,216 --> 00:55:23,176
They'll release it next week.

607
00:55:24,302 --> 00:55:26,596
- So that's how Fox knew.
- Who?

608
00:55:27,264 --> 00:55:32,185
An old Agency buddy of mine called me
last night. He said my family's in danger.

609
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:34,062
Luke, I need a favor.

610
00:55:34,146 --> 00:55:37,524
I need you to go to the house, call
Uncle Branca. Mama's got the number.

611
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:39,317
Get the family ready to move out.

612
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:42,988
You got it, buddy.
They took away your "pistola", right?

613
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:44,364
Yeah.

614
00:55:45,866 --> 00:55:46,575
Thanks.

615
00:55:46,658 --> 00:55:48,243
I don't believe this.

616
00:56:01,298 --> 00:56:05,218
You come in here, with the children,
and bring all this up...

617
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:08,597
Listen.

618
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,140
You know me.

619
00:56:10,474 --> 00:56:12,434
Please, tell these people...

620
00:56:12,517 --> 00:56:14,811
...they don't have anything to worry about.

621
00:56:14,895 --> 00:56:17,856
There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola.

622
00:56:18,315 --> 00:56:19,900
I know, Sister.

623
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:30,827
Father Tomasino.

624
00:56:32,913 --> 00:56:34,581
He came alone...

625
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,126
...two weeks ago. He had papers...

626
00:56:39,211 --> 00:56:41,671
...papers to give to the senator.

627
00:56:42,672 --> 00:56:46,134
Father Tomasino was going
to give the mass that day.

628
00:56:47,093 --> 00:56:49,679
Father Gennaro talked him out of it.

629
00:56:50,055 --> 00:56:52,599
He was afraid for Father Tomasino.

630
00:56:53,016 --> 00:56:56,102
So it was Father Tomasino
they wanted to kill.

631
00:56:58,688 --> 00:56:59,940
Where is Father Tomasino?

632
00:57:00,023 --> 00:57:02,275
He go, mister. He ran away.

633
00:57:03,026 --> 00:57:07,030
If anybody knows where he is, you've got
to tell me because I know I can help him.

634
00:57:07,114 --> 00:57:09,032
We don't know, mister.

635
00:57:22,462 --> 00:57:24,965
Jax, I'm serious. You're out of this.

636
00:57:25,048 --> 00:57:28,718
Wait a minute. I got a list.
You told me to get a list.

637
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:32,973
I'm telling you, you're finished.
I mean it. Out.

638
00:57:33,056 --> 00:57:35,642
You're not talking to a rookie,
you understand?

639
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:40,021
You go home, you take care of your family,
okay, and I'll call you.

640
00:57:43,066 --> 00:57:44,526
Paperwork only!

641
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:47,028
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

642
00:57:50,157 --> 00:57:51,491
Thank you!

643
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:10,469
Okay, come across now.
Come on, baby, come on.

644
00:58:13,388 --> 00:58:14,723
Hi, Nico!

645
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:41,166
- Call the police.
- Come on!

646
00:58:45,545 --> 00:58:47,380
Freeze, motherfucker!

647
00:58:47,547 --> 00:58:49,549
Anybody moves, he dies.

648
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,803
Drop that magazine, motherfucker, now!

649
00:58:54,221 --> 00:58:57,474
Everybody's gonna ditch their weapons,
butt first.

650
00:58:57,557 --> 00:59:00,560
Grab the barrel and do it, everybody. You!

651
00:59:01,311 --> 00:59:02,479
Now, you.

652
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:04,231
Now, you.

653
00:59:06,149 --> 00:59:07,984
Put your hands on your head.

654
00:59:08,068 --> 00:59:10,570
All right, fall in behind the last man.

655
00:59:10,654 --> 00:59:13,615
I don't think you can drop us all, badass.

656
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:16,409
You're right, but I'll get an A for effort.

657
00:59:16,493 --> 00:59:18,411
All right. Let's go. Fall out!

658
00:59:18,495 --> 00:59:20,497
Put your hands on your head.

659
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,415
Come on, you! Move!

660
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:32,134
Please don't come in here. Please, please.

661
00:59:32,592 --> 00:59:34,261
Not in my store.

662
00:59:34,511 --> 00:59:37,097
It's a police emergency. I'm a cop.

663
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,183
On your knees. Give me the phone.
Let's go.

664
00:59:41,351 --> 00:59:44,187
- This guy's gotta work, too.
- Get down, asshole.

665
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:45,856
Get the fuck down!

666
00:59:46,106 --> 00:59:47,274
You wanna get down?

667
00:59:47,357 --> 00:59:49,734
Get down on your fucking knees!

668
01:00:10,755 --> 01:00:12,757
They tell me, "Come to America!"

669
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:18,951
No, not in my store!

670
01:00:22,621 --> 01:00:24,415
There's the police!

671
01:00:29,461 --> 01:00:30,880
No, mister!

672
01:00:52,693 --> 01:00:54,486
Another police car.

673
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,159
Look! My store.

674
01:01:05,289 --> 01:01:07,666
Come on, come on. Is it clear?

675
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,129
Sara, Branca will take care of us.
We'll be safe there.

676
01:01:12,922 --> 01:01:16,091
Family goes in the Lincoln.
I'll ride in front.

677
01:01:26,185 --> 01:01:29,855
I'll be five minutes behind you.
It's got to be this way.

678
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:33,442
Let's go.

679
01:01:35,277 --> 01:01:36,320
Where's Jax?

680
01:01:36,403 --> 01:01:39,740
She thinks there's some documents
in some guy's apartment.

681
01:01:41,408 --> 01:01:43,702
They killed the wrong priest.

682
01:01:44,703 --> 01:01:46,872
What are you talking about?

683
01:01:51,293 --> 01:01:53,963
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

684
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:57,925
The second priest from Costa Rica...

685
01:01:59,552 --> 01:02:02,930
...hiding in the church.
He was the one they meant to kill.

686
01:02:03,764 --> 01:02:05,516
You know where to find this guy?

687
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,017
No, I do not.

688
01:02:08,227 --> 01:02:10,145
Then you're gonna need help.

689
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:12,565
Yeah, I'd like you to help me.

690
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:14,400
Watch my family.

691
01:02:14,984 --> 01:02:16,902
What are you gonna do?

692
01:02:17,403 --> 01:02:19,321
You don't want to know.

693
01:02:32,334 --> 01:02:35,087
Freeze! Put your hands up in the air.

694
01:02:35,337 --> 01:02:38,007
Now go put them on the hood of the car.

695
01:02:39,008 --> 01:02:43,304
Special Agent Neeley, what were you
doing with that woman up there?

696
01:02:43,596 --> 01:02:48,309
Were you engaging in some kind of
unnatural sex acts with that young lady?

697
01:02:49,018 --> 01:02:50,603
She must be 15!

698
01:02:51,353 --> 01:02:53,355
That's illegal in some states, you know.

699
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,773
What are you talking about?

700
01:02:54,857 --> 01:02:58,319
I thought you federal agents were straight,
honorable guys.

701
01:02:58,402 --> 01:03:00,738
Does your wife know about this?

702
01:03:01,697 --> 01:03:03,949
Sex is not the only thing in life.

703
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:05,284
Get in.

704
01:03:14,585 --> 01:03:17,046
- So, how has your day been?
- Okay.

705
01:03:20,341 --> 01:03:22,968
Listen, Toscani, I want to congratulate you.

706
01:03:23,052 --> 01:03:25,513
You just made number four
on the "most-wanted" list.

707
01:03:25,596 --> 01:03:28,349
Number four? I want to be number one.

708
01:03:30,392 --> 01:03:31,977
The day is young.

709
01:03:35,397 --> 01:03:36,482
What can I do for you?

710
01:03:36,565 --> 01:03:40,903
There was a quantity of C-4 explosive
brought in here four days ago.

711
01:03:41,445 --> 01:03:42,821
Hell, that's gone.

712
01:03:42,905 --> 01:03:44,323
- When?
- Right away.

713
01:03:44,406 --> 01:03:47,368
They scooped that stuff out of here
before it even got tagged.

714
01:03:47,451 --> 01:03:49,119
You know who took it?

715
01:03:49,203 --> 01:03:50,204
CIA.

716
01:03:53,707 --> 01:03:55,668
Let me see the paperwork on it.

717
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:57,419
You got to sign.

718
01:03:57,586 --> 01:04:02,049
Yeah, I remember that fellow.
Flew special out of Langley. Bomb tech.

719
01:04:02,508 --> 01:04:04,218
Real nice fellow.

720
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,428
- I'll bet.
- Here it is.

721
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:07,930
Fox.

722
01:04:08,347 --> 01:04:09,765
Nelson Fox.

723
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:15,938
- Thanks.
- Right.

724
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:18,858
Now what?

725
01:04:20,109 --> 01:04:24,697
Yes, sir. The agent has been with
the Central American desk since 1984.

726
01:04:25,114 --> 01:04:27,783
Thank you. That's what I wanted to know.

727
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:30,244
All right, take your shoes off.

728
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,788
Come on, let's go.

729
01:04:34,915 --> 01:04:37,501
So you think I'm a bad cop, Neeley?

730
01:04:38,377 --> 01:04:40,546
You know something? Maybe I am.

731
01:04:40,629 --> 01:04:43,424
But at least I don't have my face
buried up Washington's ass.

732
01:04:43,507 --> 01:04:46,343
Listen, Toscani.
Maybe I've judged you a little harshly.

733
01:04:46,427 --> 01:04:48,304
I think you have.
And you know something?

734
01:04:48,387 --> 01:04:51,640
What I'd like to do,
for the way you've treated me...

735
01:04:51,724 --> 01:04:54,643
...is treat you in a similar fashion.
I'd like you to get up...

736
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:57,438
...run your ass over there
and jump in the fucking lake.

737
01:04:57,521 --> 01:05:00,107
If you don't hurry,
I'll empty this gun in your butt.

738
01:05:00,191 --> 01:05:02,109
Move it, Agent Neeley!

739
01:05:04,737 --> 01:05:06,071
Let's go!

740
01:05:15,581 --> 01:05:17,082
Jump, Neeley!

741
01:05:48,572 --> 01:05:50,699
Nico, what are you doing here?

742
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:52,701
- I need a favor.
- Sure.

743
01:05:54,453 --> 01:05:57,540
- How late are you gonna be here today?
- I'm off at 6:00.

744
01:05:57,623 --> 01:05:58,999
I'll be here.

745
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:08,467
Don't be too long, lady.
I got a crew coming in.

746
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:10,719
Thanks. We'll be done in a little while.

747
01:06:10,803 --> 01:06:12,471
We don't have much time.

748
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:15,975
They're going to tear this goddamn place
down in a matter of hours.

749
01:06:16,058 --> 01:06:18,769
There's no way to access
Covert Operations directly...

750
01:06:18,853 --> 01:06:22,898
...but I got a guy at Princeton.
He has a database bigger than Langley.

751
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:27,069
How the hell did you get in this mess?

752
01:06:27,152 --> 01:06:30,072
I thought you were finished with the CIA.

753
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:35,035
Trap door.

754
01:06:45,504 --> 01:06:47,756
We'll wriggle up these two...

755
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:50,217
...operative dossiers.

756
01:06:52,136 --> 01:06:54,430
Start with my friend, Nelson.

757
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:10,446
Your friend has had a hell of a career.

758
01:07:10,529 --> 01:07:14,158
Give me the names of every Agency man
involved in this.

759
01:07:19,872 --> 01:07:22,124
Nico, what is going on here?

760
01:07:24,293 --> 01:07:25,711
Here we go.

761
01:07:26,295 --> 01:07:30,966
Five agents from the Central American
desk. All of them, trained assassins.

762
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:35,471
They've all come to Chicago
in the last week and they're all still here.

763
01:07:36,555 --> 01:07:39,558
They got the whole fucking
killing team here.

764
01:07:39,642 --> 01:07:41,310
It looks that way.

765
01:07:45,773 --> 01:07:47,024
Thanks.

766
01:07:49,568 --> 01:07:50,903
I owe you one.

767
01:07:50,986 --> 01:07:54,073
- Where are you going?
- I gotta find that priest.

768
01:07:54,156 --> 01:07:55,574
Be careful.

769
01:07:59,662 --> 01:08:01,664
I find this totally incredulous.

770
01:08:01,747 --> 01:08:06,168
You, being a station chief at the CIA,
didn't know what was going on?

771
01:08:06,252 --> 01:08:08,504
Mr. Senator,
I'd like to explain a few things.

772
01:08:08,587 --> 01:08:12,716
Either you perjured yourself earlier,
or you're lying to us now.

773
01:08:13,592 --> 01:08:16,262
Take a few moments
before you answer this.

774
01:08:16,345 --> 01:08:18,681
And remember that you're under oath.

775
01:08:18,764 --> 01:08:23,519
It was agreed this was a valuable asset
and that I had to work out a way...

776
01:08:23,769 --> 01:08:26,188
... they had to work out a way
in which to take over.

777
01:08:26,272 --> 01:08:29,024
And did that include
giving money to the enterprise?

778
01:08:29,108 --> 01:08:30,943
Not insofar as I knew.

779
01:08:31,026 --> 01:08:33,529
- And the colonel never told you?
- No.

780
01:08:33,612 --> 01:08:36,782
Are you saying that this was going
to be a donation for the CIA...

781
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:38,325
... as far as you were concerned?

782
01:08:38,409 --> 01:08:39,869
We were going to walk away from it.

783
01:08:39,952 --> 01:08:41,161
Hello.

784
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:44,206
Oh, yes, Sister. Yes.

785
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,083
Sister Mary, right.

786
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:51,505
No, there will be no problem.
Now just calm down. Right, right.

787
01:08:51,797 --> 01:08:53,382
Now where are you?

788
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:07,146
Who is it?

789
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:38,844
Father!

790
01:09:38,928 --> 01:09:40,763
Get her out of here.

791
01:09:44,016 --> 01:09:45,684
This way, Father.

792
01:10:39,405 --> 01:10:41,323
Where did you find this guy?

793
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:45,327
The nun from the daycare called.
She's with the priest at a place on Damon.

794
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:48,664
She saw two guys sneaking
around the church and she got scared.

795
01:10:48,747 --> 01:10:50,666
I got papers from that senator's aide.

796
01:10:50,749 --> 01:10:55,337
Everything Harrison has been working on.
It's unbelievable. It's over at my place.

797
01:10:55,421 --> 01:10:59,717
I need you to do me a favor.
Stay out of it. Just stay in the car.

798
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,971
Nico, far be it for me to complain...

799
01:11:04,513 --> 01:11:08,684
...but you got Jax pulling burglaries.
You got me doing God only knows what.

800
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:12,188
When we hit the joint,
I don't want you celling with me.

801
01:11:12,271 --> 01:11:14,607
Jax, we'll work out something.

802
01:11:29,288 --> 01:11:32,333
Why don't you go over there
and sweet-talk him?

803
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:33,459
Sure.

804
01:11:42,968 --> 01:11:46,764
If I were you, I would listen
to what this man has to say.

805
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:50,142
He knows what's best for you.

806
01:12:02,821 --> 01:12:05,741
You wouldn't lie to me would you, Father?

807
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:07,785
It's a sin.

808
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:10,246
Look at me!

809
01:12:10,496 --> 01:12:14,458
If you spoke to anyone
about our plans to kill the senator...

810
01:12:15,209 --> 01:12:16,919
...tell me now...

811
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:20,464
...and I won't have to use this.

812
01:12:20,548 --> 01:12:23,425
This is from confession. I tell no one.

813
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,027
Let's go.

814
01:12:46,615 --> 01:12:49,285
Under no circumstances
are you to come out of this car.

815
01:12:49,368 --> 01:12:51,453
Just stay here, all right?

816
01:12:56,876 --> 01:12:58,878
Take a nice look at it.

817
01:12:58,961 --> 01:13:00,880
I got it just for you.

818
01:13:06,969 --> 01:13:08,888
Do you feel that? Nice?

819
01:13:10,055 --> 01:13:11,599
You like that?

820
01:13:15,227 --> 01:13:18,355
Now you're gonna start feeling
something warm.

821
01:13:18,647 --> 01:13:20,691
Very warm and wonderful.

822
01:13:21,233 --> 01:13:22,651
Think about it.

823
01:13:22,985 --> 01:13:24,695
Warm. I love it!

824
01:13:26,572 --> 01:13:29,825
I enjoy this. I really enjoy the shit out
of this thing.

825
01:13:29,909 --> 01:13:31,702
We'll enjoy it together.

826
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:35,623
You've always been alone.
Now you'll be with me, together!

827
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:55,768
I want to know who you told.

828
01:13:57,102 --> 01:13:58,646
I told them...

829
01:14:00,564 --> 01:14:02,107
...you make...

830
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:04,276
...the children see you...

831
01:14:04,693 --> 01:14:07,029
...mutilating their mothers...

832
01:14:08,113 --> 01:14:09,907
...and sometimes...

833
01:14:10,449 --> 01:14:12,535
...you do these things...

834
01:14:12,952 --> 01:14:14,745
...to the children.

835
01:14:16,038 --> 01:14:17,915
Did you tell anybody?

836
01:14:21,043 --> 01:14:22,920
Damn it, tell me now!

837
01:14:23,587 --> 01:14:25,047
Tell me now!

838
01:14:31,387 --> 01:14:33,931
Father, I have had enough of this.
Father, I want you to tell me the truth.

839
01:14:40,312 --> 01:14:41,981
Can we kill him?

840
01:14:43,065 --> 01:14:46,402
If you told anyone about our plans
to kill the senator...

841
01:14:46,485 --> 01:14:48,404
...we cannot kill him!

842
01:14:50,155 --> 01:14:51,448
Nothing!

843
01:14:58,289 --> 01:14:59,582
Phase two.

844
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,256
Christ!

845
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,573
- Move it!
- What are you doing? Get out of here.

846
01:15:35,826 --> 01:15:38,162
Jax, get the hell out of here!

847
01:15:45,927 --> 01:15:47,053
Nico!

848
01:15:54,269 --> 01:15:55,395
Jax!

849
01:16:03,486 --> 01:16:05,071
- Go!
- I got him!

850
01:16:25,467 --> 01:16:26,926
Where is he?

851
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:29,888
Down there!

852
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,938
I got a bona fide emergency here.
What am I supposed to do?

853
01:16:44,235 --> 01:16:45,570
- Shut the fuck up!
- Yes, sir.

854
01:16:45,654 --> 01:16:47,489
Get inside! Come on!

855
01:16:49,366 --> 01:16:51,785
I hear sirens but I don't see any cops.

856
01:16:51,868 --> 01:16:54,913
If they were cops,
they'd show me their badges, asshole.

857
01:16:54,996 --> 01:16:57,290
A bona fide gunfight, asshole!

858
01:16:59,959 --> 01:17:01,336
Get up front!

859
01:17:01,878 --> 01:17:05,423
- Shut up! Be quiet!
- What the hell am I supposed to do?

860
01:17:05,507 --> 01:17:09,386
Get the car on Track 3 out of the way.
At least, get that out of the way.

861
01:17:09,469 --> 01:17:13,515
They got guns all over the place.
I got a carload of passengers.

862
01:18:21,082 --> 01:18:25,211
Damn it! Call Nico's uncle
and find out if he's heard from him.

863
01:18:26,171 --> 01:18:28,006
Shut up and save your strength.

864
01:18:28,089 --> 01:18:29,924
I'm okay. I'm okay.

865
01:18:30,258 --> 01:18:32,177
- Where are we going?
- Cubicle D.

866
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,970
I got on my vest.

867
01:18:37,057 --> 01:18:38,475
Where is he?

868
01:18:39,267 --> 01:18:40,644
What do you mean you don't know?

869
01:18:40,727 --> 01:18:43,480
We don't know what happened
to him, Branca.

870
01:18:43,563 --> 01:18:45,190
Yeah, she's gonna be all right.

871
01:18:45,273 --> 01:18:47,859
You hear anything, you let me know.

872
01:18:49,069 --> 01:18:50,278
Capisci?

873
01:18:53,406 --> 01:18:54,658
It's Nico.

874
01:18:57,994 --> 01:18:59,496
Jesus Christ.

875
01:19:07,796 --> 01:19:09,923
The motherfuckers got Jax.

876
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:12,008
Lukich called. She's not dead.

877
01:19:12,092 --> 01:19:14,803
She's gonna make it.
She was wearing a vest.

878
01:19:31,403 --> 01:19:33,697
This was picked up with your mail
this morning.

879
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:36,616
They're letting you know
if you don't back off...

880
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,702
...they're gonna get to your family.

881
01:19:38,785 --> 01:19:41,371
- You've got to do it, Nico.
- Tell him, Sara.

882
01:19:41,454 --> 01:19:43,289
You know you have to.

883
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:45,375
Listen to her, Nicola.

884
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:47,043
This is your family.

885
01:19:47,127 --> 01:19:52,090
Ever notice how clean babies smell, like
nothing in the world has touched them?

886
01:20:02,684 --> 01:20:05,186
Mom, take him upstairs, will you?

887
01:20:08,857 --> 01:20:11,234
Come, Giuliano, we'll go upstairs.

888
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:19,576
Do you know why I love you?

889
01:20:20,076 --> 01:20:23,079
What it is about you
that I've always loved?

890
01:20:23,204 --> 01:20:24,622
It's pride.

891
01:20:26,374 --> 01:20:29,294
But, Nico, that pride may kill all of us.

892
01:20:35,717 --> 01:20:37,510
Swallow your pride.

893
01:20:40,388 --> 01:20:42,641
Choke on it, if you have to.

894
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,519
- Lay it down, please.
- You know something?

895
01:20:47,228 --> 01:20:51,316
There's nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do for my family.

896
01:20:51,733 --> 01:20:53,568
Nobody will harm us.

897
01:20:54,694 --> 01:20:57,197
I don't want you to worry. Okay?

898
01:21:35,193 --> 01:21:38,279
Not even you can hit him
at this range, Nico.

899
01:21:39,781 --> 01:21:41,658
That wasn't the plan, Nelson.

900
01:21:41,741 --> 01:21:43,201
Close range?

901
01:21:44,202 --> 01:21:47,664
It'd never work. It's rigged.
Scanned every 35 seconds.

902
01:21:47,747 --> 01:21:50,667
I was thinking of a claymore on the roof...

903
01:21:51,042 --> 01:21:52,085
No!

904
01:21:52,585 --> 01:21:55,714
The roof is wired, too.
Sensors every 15 feet.

905
01:21:56,798 --> 01:21:58,174
Okay. Now you can move.

906
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:01,594
- It's me. You don't have to treat me like...
- Slow!

907
01:22:01,678 --> 01:22:05,181
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.
Move! Slow.

908
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:08,852
You even look at me funny,
you're in the river, Toscani.

909
01:22:08,935 --> 01:22:12,230
I figured you'd do your recon
from this building.

910
01:22:14,316 --> 01:22:17,652
- You're looking fit.
- I'm getting a bit of a tire.

911
01:22:17,986 --> 01:22:20,613
- Is that your own tailor?
- Hong Kong.

912
01:22:21,281 --> 01:22:23,533
- You've come a long way.
- Yeah.

913
01:22:24,284 --> 01:22:25,577
Just walk.

914
01:22:27,287 --> 01:22:28,621
I don't believe you.

915
01:22:28,705 --> 01:22:32,792
What's so hard to believe?
I want to help you, you dumb guinea.

916
01:22:33,501 --> 01:22:35,879
I've been trying to talk
some sense into you.

917
01:22:35,962 --> 01:22:37,922
You're still "Fox the Fixer."

918
01:22:38,006 --> 01:22:42,093
If I wanted to cap you,
I'd save myself all this damn chitchat.

919
01:22:42,636 --> 01:22:45,805
I'd make big points for myself
if I brought your scalp in.

920
01:22:45,889 --> 01:22:48,058
Shit, I'd be White House material.

921
01:22:48,224 --> 01:22:50,435
Is that what Zagon is,
one of your basement boys?

922
01:22:50,518 --> 01:22:54,397
Zagon's a rancher. 4,000 acres
in Costa Rica. Beautiful place.

923
01:22:54,481 --> 01:22:59,194
Beautiful place, huh? Was that bought
with opium money from the triangle?

924
01:22:59,736 --> 01:23:02,280
And a ton of coke a week
from other places.

925
01:23:02,364 --> 01:23:05,950
Which he funnels here through Salvano.
The company getting it's cut, of course.

926
01:23:06,034 --> 01:23:07,535
Legal tender.

927
01:23:08,912 --> 01:23:11,915
So war is still the greatest business, huh?

928
01:23:12,582 --> 01:23:16,753
These guys have started and financed
every war we've ever fought.

929
01:23:16,878 --> 01:23:21,007
Nobody would believe me if I told them
the bankers were the CIA.

930
01:23:21,841 --> 01:23:24,552
Come on, Toscani, don't preach to me.

931
01:23:25,011 --> 01:23:27,222
So the senator couldn't be bought,
could he?

932
01:23:27,305 --> 01:23:32,018
He was gonna expose your plans to invade
Nicaragua with your fucking coke money.

933
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:34,729
So the Agency clears Zagon
to cap his ass, right?

934
01:23:34,813 --> 01:23:36,773
Just keep walking, asshole.

935
01:23:36,856 --> 01:23:39,818
So some poor, innocent priest finds out.
He comes here.

936
01:23:39,901 --> 01:23:43,405
But you can't kill the senator
until you know if the "padre" has talked.

937
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:48,284
So Zagon comes in, "Tell me," with his
little doctor bag. Only by then, I'm in on it.

938
01:23:48,702 --> 01:23:52,330
And you fucking know
I'm gonna recognize his handiwork.

939
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:56,209
If your name would've been Joe Smith,
I never would've caught it.

940
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:59,087
But how many Nicola Toscanis are there?

941
01:23:59,629 --> 01:24:03,633
Tell me something, old buddy.
Do we kill our own senators now?

942
01:24:04,801 --> 01:24:06,219
Why not? The Romans did.

943
01:24:06,303 --> 01:24:09,222
- Are we the fucking Romans?
- We're an empire, too.

944
01:24:09,347 --> 01:24:11,975
You don't believe that shit for a minute.

945
01:24:12,058 --> 01:24:13,643
Just walk. Go!

946
01:24:24,529 --> 01:24:25,947
Hold it, Nico.

947
01:24:28,575 --> 01:24:31,578
- Here's your key, sir.
- My buddy will drive.

948
01:24:38,335 --> 01:24:40,045
You know something?

949
01:24:40,128 --> 01:24:44,841
In Europe, they're trying some 80-year-old
camp guard for Nazi war crimes.

950
01:24:45,634 --> 01:24:48,637
All around our country,
they got guys on Death Row...

951
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,473
...for murdering one, two, three guys.

952
01:24:51,848 --> 01:24:54,768
And they probably deserve
what they're gonna get.

953
01:24:54,851 --> 01:24:56,519
But you and I...

954
01:24:56,603 --> 01:24:59,022
...we know people
that are personally responsible...

955
01:24:59,105 --> 01:25:02,442
...for the death
of 50,000 non-military personnel.

956
01:25:03,109 --> 01:25:06,863
Librarians, teachers, doctors,
women, children, all dead.

957
01:25:07,822 --> 01:25:10,241
We've wiped out entire cultures.

958
01:25:10,492 --> 01:25:11,951
And for what?

959
01:25:12,494 --> 01:25:17,082
Not one CIA agent has ever been tried,
much less accused, of any crimes.

960
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:22,462
You guys think you're above the law,
but you ain't above mine.

961
01:25:24,506 --> 01:25:28,301
Nico, we don't have time for this.
Get in the goddamn car.

962
01:25:51,408 --> 01:25:55,662
I've been waiting for the day
I'd catch up with this motherfucker.

963
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:04,587
Salvano and his scumbag dealer.

964
01:26:06,006 --> 01:26:08,008
What a team we got here.

965
01:26:08,216 --> 01:26:10,468
I told you, you'd never be the man.

966
01:26:10,552 --> 01:26:13,138
Nelson, we've been looking for you.

967
01:26:14,514 --> 01:26:16,057
I see that you...

968
01:26:16,683 --> 01:26:18,435
...found our friend.

969
01:26:18,518 --> 01:26:19,978
Thanks, Fox.

970
01:26:20,437 --> 01:26:22,731
I didn't bring him. I swear it.

971
01:26:23,231 --> 01:26:25,942
You two must have had a lot to talk about.

972
01:26:26,026 --> 01:26:28,528
Reminiscing about the good old days?

973
01:26:28,611 --> 01:26:29,863
Stay still!

974
01:26:31,239 --> 01:26:33,241
Just fucking don't move.

975
01:26:33,575 --> 01:26:35,827
Nelson, bring our friend in.

976
01:26:40,707 --> 01:26:42,709
Come on, be a good boy.

977
01:26:44,044 --> 01:26:45,462
Dive, Nico!

978
01:27:01,978 --> 01:27:03,855
Get that motherfucker!

979
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:21,748
Move it!

980
01:27:25,043 --> 01:27:26,211
Get him!

981
01:27:56,324 --> 01:27:58,326
Stop the car, you fuck!

982
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:06,918
Stop the car, you piece of shit!

983
01:28:08,044 --> 01:28:09,337
Stop it!

984
01:28:27,355 --> 01:28:28,732
Fox's car!

985
01:29:13,652 --> 01:29:15,320
He's on the ramp now.

986
01:29:15,403 --> 01:29:18,573
He's coming out the Wabash entrance.
Get there, Deep Throat.

987
01:29:18,657 --> 01:29:21,201
Roger, Spike Leader. We read you.

988
01:29:30,251 --> 01:29:32,045
Get out of the car!

989
01:29:32,212 --> 01:29:33,922
I want him alive.

990
01:29:41,388 --> 01:29:42,806
He's clean.

991
01:29:43,431 --> 01:29:45,016
Bring him over.

992
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:47,852
Let's go!

993
01:29:51,231 --> 01:29:55,151
We're out of here.
Abandon the vehicles and get out of here.

994
01:29:55,944 --> 01:29:58,947
Tommy, hurry up! Get in.
We're out of here.

995
01:30:14,004 --> 01:30:17,257
Now, our honored guest,
Senator Ernest Harrison.

996
01:30:37,777 --> 01:30:41,448
I hope this don't take too long
'cause I'm getting hungry.

997
01:30:48,705 --> 01:30:51,583
This is bullshit. We've got work to do.

998
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:55,337
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

999
01:30:57,422 --> 01:31:01,676
We've got an hour before we say good-bye
to the honorable senator.

1000
01:31:02,052 --> 01:31:05,305
You know, you've got to learn
to take time to...

1001
01:31:05,972 --> 01:31:07,766
...smell the roses.

1002
01:31:08,308 --> 01:31:11,561
How are you gonna do him?
Do him in the motorcade...

1003
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:14,814
...or pass him through a hotel kitchen?

1004
01:31:23,948 --> 01:31:25,450
Put his face up.

1005
01:31:27,786 --> 01:31:29,037
Hold it up.

1006
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:32,749
Here you go, Toscani."Dr. Feelgood."

1007
01:31:47,098 --> 01:31:50,852
l've used these little beauties
many times to extract information.

1008
01:31:51,106 --> 01:31:53,336
For the first time in my life...

1009
01:31:53,778 --> 01:31:56,292
...l'm gonna do it just for the fun.

1010
01:31:59,122 --> 01:32:02,114
Get away from me with that,
you piece of shit!

1011
01:32:10,435 --> 01:32:11,993
That's it, fight it!

1012
01:32:12,147 --> 01:32:13,865
Fight it, cherry...

1013
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:17,174
...so it speeds right on its way.

1014
01:32:17,491 --> 01:32:18,765
Fight it!

1015
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,920
Keep fighting it!

1016
01:32:30,349 --> 01:32:32,419
Oh, you're a good boy, now.

1017
01:32:35,109 --> 01:32:37,543
That's what l've been waiting for.

1018
01:32:39,033 --> 01:32:40,261
Let him go.

1019
01:32:53,662 --> 01:32:55,997
Toscani, my sleeping beauty...

1020
01:32:56,623 --> 01:32:59,042
...you should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1021
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:01,628
You're too fucking dumb, asshole.

1022
01:33:06,424 --> 01:33:07,968
Jake! Look out!

1023
01:33:45,827 --> 01:33:47,704
Say something. Nico?

1024
01:33:49,831 --> 01:33:50,832
Is there a doctor here?

1025
01:33:50,915 --> 01:33:52,959
Quick! Call an ambulance!

1026
01:33:56,754 --> 01:34:01,509
Agent Neeley, FBI. We've got a problem,
but we don't know what it is, yet.

1027
01:34:06,139 --> 01:34:08,725
Please, Senator Harrison, this way.

1028
01:34:09,517 --> 01:34:13,771
We are standing in front of the home
of Police Sergeant Nico Toscani.

1029
01:34:13,855 --> 01:34:17,233
Behind me, the entourage
of Senator Harrison is arriving.

1030
01:34:17,317 --> 01:34:21,696
Lots of security here. We have police
officers on the scene and federal agents.

1031
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:24,782
Of course, there is concern
of a possible assassination attempt.

1032
01:34:24,866 --> 01:34:28,786
That's why you've got so many
law enforcement officers here.

1033
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:36,252
- This is Senator Harrison. Nico Toscani.
- How do you do?

1034
01:34:36,336 --> 01:34:38,171
Please, don't get up.

1035
01:34:38,546 --> 01:34:40,381
Detective Toscani...

1036
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:44,469
...I just felt compelled to come
and thank you personally...

1037
01:34:44,552 --> 01:34:47,972
...and to assure you that we'll use
every resource available...

1038
01:34:48,056 --> 01:34:49,933
...to bring these men to justice...

1039
01:34:50,016 --> 01:34:54,354
...and to ensure that this type of
behavior will never be tolerated again.

1040
01:34:56,022 --> 01:34:57,815
That would be nice.

1041
01:34:58,232 --> 01:35:02,195
Let me introduce Roberta Alspaugh
of the Fifth Circuit Court.

1042
01:35:02,612 --> 01:35:03,821
How do you do, ma'am?

1043
01:35:03,905 --> 01:35:06,240
Are you sure you're well enough?

1044
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:10,536
I'm ready to talk if you're ready to listen.

1045
01:35:10,954 --> 01:35:12,205
All right.

1046
01:35:12,914 --> 01:35:16,542
- Miss Jackson, I'll leave you now.
- Senator, thank you.

1047
01:35:18,211 --> 01:35:22,340
- We'll be leaving for Washington.
- Hey buddy, we'll be back later.

1048
01:35:25,593 --> 01:35:27,136
Mr. Toscani...

1049
01:35:27,428 --> 01:35:30,765
...can you tell us about
your military background?

1050
01:35:34,936 --> 01:35:38,273
In 1973, I worked for
a special operations group...

1051
01:35:39,565 --> 01:35:41,734
...in Vietnam and Cambodia.

1052
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:45,488
I was involved with gathering intelligence.

1053
01:35:45,571 --> 01:35:49,909
All of the members of this team
were doctors recruited by the CIA...

1054
01:35:50,618 --> 01:35:54,122
...and trained at a secret camp
in Langley, Virginia.

1055
01:36:06,342 --> 01:36:09,929
Gentlemen, whenever you have a group
of individuals...

1056
01:36:10,388 --> 01:36:12,599
... who are beyond any investigation...

1057
01:36:12,682 --> 01:36:16,978
... who can manipulate the press,
judges, members of our Congress...

1058
01:36:17,934 --> 01:36:22,156
... you'll have within our government
those who are above the law.
