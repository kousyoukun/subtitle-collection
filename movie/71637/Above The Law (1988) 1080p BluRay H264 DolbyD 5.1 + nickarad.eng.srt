1
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:38,998
I was born in Palermo, Sicily.

2
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:42,704
We came to this country when I was seven.
We immigrated to Chicago.

3
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:46,416
We were always raised to be very patriotic,
to love our country.

4
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,921
And we did.

5
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:51,838
When I was a little boy,
my father took me to a baseball game.

6
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:55,716
They had a martial arts demonstration
and I saw this old Japanese man...

7
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:58,931
...doing things that I thought
were magical...

8
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:02,055
...and I developed a crazy dream
to go to the Far East.

9
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:05,983
By the time I was 1 7, I was there,
studying with the masters.

10
00:02:56,515 --> 00:03:01,557
In 1969 I was invited by a friend of mine
to an American Embassy party in Tokyo.

11
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:06,894
While I was there, there was a crazy,
drunk guy named Nelson Fox.

12
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:09,190
He recruited me into the CIA.

13
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,569
I was 22 at the time.

14
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:14,272
My eyes were about to be opened.

15
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:54,478
My friends, let me make one thing clear:

16
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:56,613
This is a nation of laws.

17
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,859
And as Abraham Lincoln had said:

18
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:02,238
""No one is above the law,
no one is below the law. ""

19
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:04,158
And we"re going to enforce the law!

20
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:08,579
And Americans should remember that,
if we are to have law and order!

21
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:24,995
You ever seen
chemical interrogation before?

22
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,246
These assholes are Agency?

23
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,491
We all get paid by the ClA.

24
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:33,584
But these guys are from a page
that ain't even in the book.

25
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:00,281
Don't die on me, you sucker!

26
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,275
What the hell's wrong?

27
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:05,947
This pussy, he just can't hold his liquor.

28
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,704
Doc, he's dead.

29
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:13,034
Get him the fuck out of here.

30
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:16,037
-Move it. Let's go.
-Come on!

31
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:19,290
-Get him out.
-Get him out of here.

32
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:34,147
So, my little doctor bag doesn't scare you?

33
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,401
l'm not scared.

34
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:39,104
You speak English.

35
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:40,984
How nice.

36
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,947
Where's the load, Colonel?

37
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:55,752
l'm gonna teach you never...

38
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:58,126
...never to fuck with my opium.

39
00:06:58,507 --> 00:06:59,787
Oh, boy.

40
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,383
He's a hard one, Doc.

41
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:06,463
You took it from the French,
you took it from the Chinks.

42
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:10,471
And you'll be damned
if a Yankee's going to start you talking.

43
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:14,352
But you're gonna sing for me.
You're gonna sing like a choir!

44
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:18,022
What does this have to do
with military intelligence?

45
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:24,028
Who the fuck is this cherry?

46
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:27,694
Your orders, Toscani,
were to assist and observe.

47
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:30,405
Just back off, partner.

48
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,999
l'm gonna start cutting you off
at the ankles.

49
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:46,715
Then l'm gonna take your feet
and throw them right in the basket.

50
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,217
Cute, huh?

51
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:50,433
Shut up, Nico.

52
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:53,307
Look, l can make you disappear.

53
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:59,728
Grab his leg.

54
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:03,148
-What the hell are you doing, man?
-Nico!

55
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:10,783
You think you're soldiers?
You're fucking barbarians!

56
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:14,613
Get out!

57
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:22,083
Get back to the LZ.

58
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:25,341
lf l don't cap him now,
he's gonna do me later.

59
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:27,836
l'll call a chopper in for us. l'll cover this.

60
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,088
Just get the hell out of here!

61
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:31,012
Come on, move!

62
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,926
Bring him back here!

63
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:38,515
Nobody move! Everybody stay
on that damn porch!

64
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:42,313
Go, Nico!

65
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:48,062
Nelson, l'm through. l'm finished!

66
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:02,963
Nicola, Sara,
what name do you give your child?

67
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:04,673
Giuliano Nicola.

68
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:08,291
Giuliano...

69
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:11,045
...you have become a new creation.

70
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,891
With the help of your family and friends...

71
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:16,930
...we bring your Christian dignity
unstained...

72
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:19,808
...into the everlasting life of heaven.

73
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:24,152
-Come on. You always make me late.
-l'm the boss. You have to drive me!

74
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:27,488
l'll trace the sign of the Cross
upon your forehead...

75
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:30,574
...and l invite your parents to do the same.

76
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,325
ln the name of the Father, the Son...

77
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,865
...and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

78
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,832
Look at him. He's such a good baby.

79
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,380
That's beautiful.

80
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:09,940
-l know you're the boss but--
-That's right. Remember that.

81
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,111
Hi, guys.

82
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,742
Hey, how are you?

83
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,944
You guys look so good!

84
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:18,370
We haven't done anything.
We're clean. Some of us, anyway.

85
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:22,122
Well, Lieutenant, eight more days
and you're gonna miss me.

86
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:23,457
Parts of you, anyway.

87
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:24,921
You see this cop?

88
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:28,457
This one. This one here.
She could bust me anytime.

89
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,461
Look at that! Look at that!

90
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:32,675
-This is the partner?
-This is the partner.

91
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:35,468
l got dressed up because
you told me you were wearing a tux.

92
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:38,393
You look fabulous.
She goes to work looking like this?

93
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:41,395
This girl, sometimes she comes
in just lingerie.

94
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:46,060
Don't tell our secrets. She's never gonna
let you out with me again.

95
00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:52,480
l told you guys to have a good time,
but take it easy, will you?

96
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:54,567
Toscani holds the record
for having more relatives...

97
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,076
...under federal indictment
than any other cop in the city.

98
00:10:58,163 --> 00:11:00,286
Look at those stiff dicks.

99
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:03,584
A free meal and they come out like flies.

100
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,958
Hey, you greaseball bastards!

101
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:08,497
Didn't we buy that monkey once?

102
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,840
Rosa, l'm so worried. So worried.

103
00:11:22,062 --> 00:11:23,722
-What's wrong?
-Nico!

104
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,013
lsn't today a day you should be happy?

105
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:30,229
-What's wrong?
-lt's Lucia. She's gone again.

106
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:33,278
-ls it that boy?
-SÌ, Nico.

107
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:40,697
l have to go to work right now.
You gonna be at the bakery later?

108
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:41,323
SÌ.

109
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:45,365
l'll come by the bakery and we'll talk.
Maybe l can do something.

110
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:47,667
Thank you, Nico. Thank you.

111
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:53,796
Lester, this is Unit 10, Tango-X-ray.

112
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,718
We're up and clear. You got that?

113
00:11:56,805 --> 00:12:00,969
Delores, Toscani told me he"ll watch
over you and take care of you real good...

114
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,518
...your last week on the street.

115
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:05,390
Never had a friend who was a DA before.

116
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:12,570
l'm gonna take a piss and be right back.

117
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:14,113
-Here?
-Yeah.

118
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:25,206
She's fine, ain't she?

119
00:12:28,128 --> 00:12:30,584
Excuse me, l just had to stop and tell you...

120
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:34,421
...you look like the sun setting
on a waterfall in the springtime.

121
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,464
And you got five seconds, and three are up.

122
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,840
You ain't got to be--

123
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:44,477
Lady cops need boyfriends, too, you dig?

124
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:47,349
But you have a nice day, just the same.

125
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,778
Nothing but trouble coming
in my place tonight.

126
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,523
l know this one.

127
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:02,404
You seen this girl?

128
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,287
l ain't seen shit.

129
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:06,865
You haven't seen this girl?

130
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,494
Hey, Schifo, how you doing?

131
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:15,340
-You seen this girl?
-You know l quit messing with that stuff.

132
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:18,380
-l ain't into this shit anymore.
-What are you into?

133
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,712
Why don't the fuck
you assholes leave me alone?

134
00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:23,178
-l paid your boy off Monday night.
-My boys, huh?

135
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:27,596
Now take some of that fucking money
and buy your mama a condominium.

136
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:31,723
l thought this was a kosher bar, man.
No pork allowed.

137
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,524
Say, man, you seen this girl?

138
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:44,409
l seen the top of her head.

139
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,531
That's good.

140
00:14:04,224 --> 00:14:07,724
Stop this motherfucker.
He's crazy. Where's my piece?

141
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:12,806
He ain't nothing. Take him out.
He's motherfucking crazy.

142
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,142
He's a fucking ltalian puke!

143
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:18,778
Freeze, motherfucker!

144
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:23,867
Come on, man. Please. Put the gun away.

145
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:38,379
All right. Who else wants some?

146
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,376
You're destroying the image of my place.

147
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:43,589
You'll never be the fucking man.
You'll never be the man.

148
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:45,223
Get over here!

149
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:47,882
Hold it, man. Don't do me ugly.

150
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:51,893
Listen. l know where the chick is.
She's upstairs.

151
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:55,184
-Yeah? She's upstairs?
-2-C. l swear, man. lt's 2-C.

152
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:05,402
This isn't what it looks like.

153
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:07,285
Listen, he's my cousin. He's a cop.

154
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,410
l didn't know they had all of this.

155
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:10,992
Get out of here.

156
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:14,412
You having a good time?

157
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:15,997
Pretty good time.

158
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,836
What is this shit? You wanna get high?

159
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:24,636
You wanna get high?

160
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:30,638
You're acting stupid, man! Stop it!

161
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:37,310
Stop. You playing the cop, l'm tired of it.

162
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:40,650
l'll show you what time is
'cause you'll do tall time.

163
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:44,570
Just take it, it's yours.
Three grand. lt's in the mattress.

164
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:47,066
You want to fucking bribe me, man?

165
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:49,738
Put your clothes on. We're going home.

166
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,110
Stop it.

167
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:54,037
l'm tired of you. You shut up!

168
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:57,790
Don't you understand that there are people
out there who love you.

169
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,585
Right. Keep talking. Keep flapping.

170
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:03,169
ln my business!

171
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:07,297
ls this your school stuff?

172
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:11,517
lt's my math homework and my history.
You gonna write me another note, Nico?

173
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:13,262
Come on. We're going home.

174
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:15,595
No, you go home. l'm tired.

175
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:19,353
l'll give you something, something big.

176
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:20,273
Oh, yeah?

177
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:24,310
This is huge, my man.
lt's a shipment coming in next Tuesday.

178
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:27,319
What the hell do you know
about a shipment?

179
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:29,865
This is square, on my mother's soul.

180
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:33,120
You gotta believe me, man.
You can't set me up.

181
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:37,710
l heard it from a hooker friend who's
banging this big coke lawyer. He told her.

182
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:39,205
-What lawyer?
-l don't know.

183
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,755
What do you mean you don't know?

184
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,330
Carlos Abandano. That's the one.

185
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:47,387
Better fucking pray to God
you ain't bullshitting me...

186
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:50,638
...or l'll come back and tear your heart out.
Let's go.

187
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:56,267
Who are you?

188
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:57,351
Get back!

189
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:59,017
l own this place!

190
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,810
l own this joint.

191
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:05,318
There's a guy upstairs.
l want to get him arrested!

192
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:11,032
-That's the motherfucker right there!
-These two guys are under arrest.

193
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,611
lt's a cesspool in there. Check it out.

194
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,032
Boy, you got some strange toilet habits.

195
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:20,333
l'm gonna take her home and clean her up.

196
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:23,540
l don't want to take her
to her grandmother like this.

197
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,488
Jax, l hate these cocaine lawyers.

198
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,661
And this shitty weather.

199
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:05,831
They're gonna have me serving time.

200
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:09,676
l wish you'd relax, hon.
This'll never get into court.

201
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:11,470
Except against us.

202
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:15,425
l don't care how
l have to get at these guys--

203
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:16,431
Let me reiterate.

204
00:18:16,518 --> 00:18:20,848
You said you were going to protect
my butt and be my guardian angel.

205
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:22,440
Hang on, hang on.

206
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:26,443
There is an engine block
clearing customs...

207
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:29,188
...Tuesday, 10:00 pickup.

208
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:32,986
Fulton Meat Market.

209
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,531
An engine block?

210
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:44,623
Clever, clever, guys.

211
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,013
l'd like an '86 Lincoln...

212
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:59,973
...lllinois 354-DOG-67, please.

213
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:08,562
Ramone Chi Chi Testamente,
a Salvadoran national with quite a record.

214
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:11,145
Remember, you were harping on me
about having a date.

215
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,734
Dream on, baby.

216
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:17,237
l want to tell you, what l turned down
tonight, you could never come close to.

217
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:21,079
You should become a science-fiction
writer, instead of a cop or a DA...

218
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,910
...with that imagination you got.

219
00:19:23,002 --> 00:19:24,496
You're right.

220
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,509
How you doing, Mr. Abandano?

221
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:37,174
Chi Chi, how you doing?

222
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:47,608
-l do not like this place.
-You do not like this place?

223
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:51,691
No, l don't want to go into this place.
You know l hate places like this.

224
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,402
-What don't you like about it?
-The element!

225
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:57,610
You know something, darling?

226
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:01,286
l really think that you should lighten up,
because...

227
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,244
...we're gonna party.

228
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:12,541
This is my lawyer. Say hello.

229
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:20,095
-Two for dinner?
-Just drinks.

230
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:33,446
Good work.

231
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:35,900
l don't believe it.

232
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:40,862
Sit down here. You're gonna love
this place. l promise.

233
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:46,622
Salvano, the fucking cockroach.

234
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:51,964
l don't believe this. You always do this
to me in front of people.

235
00:20:58,597 --> 00:21:00,175
That is beautiful.

236
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:03,716
Excuse me.

237
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:04,932
l love it.

238
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:07,939
You'll have your engine block
on Tuesday, Boss.

239
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:12,772
lf this happened a week from Tuesday,
l could read about it in the paper.

240
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:15,187
Relax. lt'll make you famous.

241
00:21:15,698 --> 00:21:18,023
Just what l need, to be famous.

242
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:32,545
Can you believe this?

243
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:38,173
Lieutenant Strozah, meet those two cops
in the back alley.

244
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:46,974
We got it down pretty good.

245
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:49,553
We got guys in the front,
we got a couple of cars out back.

246
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:51,142
Sealed off pretty good.

247
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,226
Three of our best guys.
l handpicked each one.

248
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,726
Jackson, Lukich, Nico. They're all topshelf.

249
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:58,146
They know how to do this.
They've done it before.

250
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,565
l can tell how much you love it here.

251
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:03,734
God! Now l know why l'm a vegetarian.

252
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:06,155
You eat meat. l know you eat meat.

253
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:08,953
-l'm gonna throw up.
-l've heard you eat meat.

254
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:14,622
Nico, keep the channel clear.
Don't embarrass us.

255
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:18,258
Right over there.
Two guys in the alley over there.

256
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:20,337
Definitely the Feds.

257
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:25,714
Frank, it"s fucking infested down here.
What are you trying to do to us?

258
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,849
Someone from downtown got wind of it.
Don't worry.

259
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:31,021
They're trying to make points.
Just handle the pinch.

260
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:33,687
This ain't a bust, it's a fucking convention.

261
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:35,436
l don't believe this.

262
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:40,271
Look at this, boys. Here we go.

263
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:47,822
Here we go. Jackson, stay back.

264
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:56,287
l think they made you.
You're too pretty to be a meatpacker.

265
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:58,540
lt's going down, boys. Let's go.

266
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:02,213
Keep your heads up.

267
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:04,215
Woman, let's do it.

268
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,095
The cars are going around the corner.

269
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:22,812
Come on, Nico. Lukich, get up there.

270
00:23:35,462 --> 00:23:36,921
What do you think?

271
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:38,496
Looks good.

272
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:41,919
Let's get on with it.

273
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:58,019
-What the fuck are you assholes doing?
-Feds!

274
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,352
Shit! They jumped too soon!

275
00:24:03,782 --> 00:24:04,897
What the fuck is this?

276
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:06,367
Freeze! Police!

277
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:19,875
Get back!

278
00:24:44,823 --> 00:24:46,483
Nico, the Lincoln!

279
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:56,914
Nico!

280
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:10,212
Chi Chi!

281
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:15,141
Nico!

282
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,344
Nico!

283
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:21,442
Fucking animal!

284
00:25:22,444 --> 00:25:24,022
Get rid of him!

285
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:27,858
l'm out! Do him!

286
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,911
He's still on the roof! Get rid of him!

287
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:44,208
Where do l go? What do l do?

288
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:46,376
Hit those hooks over there!

289
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:22,872
What do l do?

290
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:25,546
Stop the fucking car!

291
00:26:27,593 --> 00:26:29,467
Stop the fucking car!

292
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:45,982
Hands up! Out of the car!

293
00:26:51,116 --> 00:26:54,781
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You scared me to death!

294
00:26:55,037 --> 00:26:56,615
Nico, you okay?

295
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,288
-Wait till you hear about--
-Shut the fuck up!

296
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:02,452
You make a nice hood ornament, Sarge.

297
00:27:02,544 --> 00:27:04,952
-Come on!
-Gotta get this garbage out of here.

298
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:08,546
You gonna lose your license
driving around like that.

299
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:13,217
Let's go.

300
00:27:19,645 --> 00:27:21,436
What do we got here?

301
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:26,559
What kind of high is this?

302
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:29,857
Sky-high.

303
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:32,489
Military explosives.

304
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:38,037
C-4, my man.

305
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:47,994
Hey, Boss...

306
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,340
...you can see your place
from the office of the FBl.

307
00:27:51,427 --> 00:27:53,087
Ain't that something?

308
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:56,179
-Your name again?
-Agent Neeley, Chicago office.

309
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:01,936
The arresting officer, Toscani.
What does he do?

310
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:05,436
-He's a tac sergeant, CPD Vice.
-Hold on a minute--

311
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:07,150
l'll tell you what this cop is.

312
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:10,354
He's a fucking menace.
He almost strangled me!

313
00:28:10,696 --> 00:28:13,531
Your problem is being
taken care of right now.

314
00:28:13,615 --> 00:28:17,565
lt should've been handled 12 hours ago
when my throat was in one piece!

315
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:20,331
l don't know who's running
this outfit here...

316
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:24,743
...but l'll tell you one thing:
somebody better get his wires straight.

317
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:28,370
You don't know who you're dealing with.

318
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:31,915
This maniac should be wearing a number,
not a badge!

319
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:35,635
-The director does not want a problem.
-There won't be one.

320
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:37,678
And I don"t want any problems.

321
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:38,595
l understand.

322
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:41,968
Just listen.
They are to be released immediately.

323
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:43,769
You can count on it.

324
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:45,396
Avoid all contacts.

325
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:48,435
You'll have the Bureau's full cooperation.

326
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:56,490
You're free to go.

327
00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:00,449
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

328
00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:19,422
Good work. l loved the face of that
FBl guy when the call came through.

329
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:22,046
Salvano.

330
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:29,519
l don't want any more problems.

331
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:32,232
l don't enjoy babysitting.

332
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:38,532
Everything is going to be all right
from now on.

333
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:40,693
l promise you, Mr. Zagon.

334
00:29:48,794 --> 00:29:52,377
Attention, please. Attention, everyone.
Please, guys.

335
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:55,379
l just want to get a few things
straightened out.

336
00:29:55,467 --> 00:30:00,176
A few minutes ago, l received a call from
the First Deputy Superintendent's office.

337
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:04,641
As we all know, possession of these kinds
of explosives is a federal offense...

338
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:08,475
...and falls under the jurisdiction
of the federal agencies represented here.

339
00:30:08,564 --> 00:30:10,889
What kind of bullshit is that?

340
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,316
The Feds come in, the doors close,
nobody hears, smells or sees anything.

341
00:30:14,403 --> 00:30:15,601
And that's no answer.

342
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:18,187
lt's no answer to why
the biggest drug dealer in the city...

343
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:20,440
...is out on the street
as free as a fucking bird!

344
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:24,318
Keep it in your pants, all right. These men
have a job to do, just like we do.

345
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:26,868
lt's their game, let them play it.

346
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:32,833
What l'm about to say
does not leave this room. ls that clear?

347
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:36,294
Mr. Salvano has been working
for some time...

348
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:39,170
...in cooperation
with certain federal agencies.

349
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:43,923
l'm not at liberty to divulge the nature
or extent of Mr. Salvano's involvement.

350
00:30:44,183 --> 00:30:47,599
l just learned of its existence myself
a few hours ago.

351
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:50,771
One thing l can tell you
is that Mr. Salvano's role...

352
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:54,770
...is crucial to an extremely sensitive,
ongoing investigation.

353
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,891
Any surveillance...

354
00:30:55,986 --> 00:31:00,944
...harassment or unauthorized operations
against this individual are forbidden.

355
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,114
l order all of you, with due respect
for your work and your courage...

356
00:31:05,204 --> 00:31:06,698
...to stand down.

357
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,709
Why don't you assholes
stand down on this?

358
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:22,963
You're gonna need me.

359
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:25,549
Need you. For what?

360
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:27,800
To get your ass out of jail.

361
00:31:27,893 --> 00:31:30,016
You think you can afford my bail?

362
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,219
No.

363
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:33,472
Neither do l. Not on this pay.

364
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:36,732
You'll end up in jail for a long time,
l have the strangest feeling.

365
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:39,440
You're jealous 'cause l'm gonna stay a cop.

366
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:42,609
What the fuck is this? Go back to work.

367
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:49,824
Here we go.

368
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:58,307
What are you thinking?

369
00:33:19,505 --> 00:33:21,912
lsn't this your mother's church?

370
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:25,834
Yes, but l'll bet she hasn't seen these boys
in the choir.

371
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,325
Hey, Nico!

372
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:51,446
l can't believe you're in church
without your family.

373
00:33:51,537 --> 00:33:52,782
Hello, Father. How are you?

374
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:54,531
This must be your partner in crime.

375
00:33:54,623 --> 00:33:56,414
-Delores Jackson.
-l'm Father Gennaro.

376
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,374
l saw you at the baptismal party.

377
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,034
-Nico, we gotta go!
-No, please. Wait.

378
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:03,506
God, it's good you're here.

379
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,046
lf you got a few minutes,
there's something l'd like to show you.

380
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:07,380
Please.

381
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,800
l haven't been down here since l was a kid.

382
00:34:22,484 --> 00:34:23,564
What's this?

383
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:25,894
The rats are getting bigger.

384
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:31,445
-When did this happen?
-Two nights ago. l didn't call the police.

385
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:34,156
What do they want, the bingo receipts?

386
00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:07,737
These are friends.

387
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:10,028
Father Tomasino, this is Nico.

388
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:11,651
-Mucho gusto, Padre.
-How do you do?

389
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,735
-Sister Mary.
-Hi, Nico.

390
00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:16,160
-Delores.
-How do you do, Father?

391
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:18,488
-Señora, mucho gusto.
-Hello.

392
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:24,003
My friend, Father Tomasino,
is working with the sanctuary movement.

393
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,368
He's visiting...

394
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:29,711
...helping his people work out
some of their immigration problems.

395
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:34,137
Sorry to have troubled you.
Nico, we must go.

396
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:36,969
Gracias.

397
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,928
Nice meeting you, sir.

398
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:43,637
Bye-bye.

399
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:01,705
-How long have those people been here?
-Too long.

400
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,579
At least the children go to our school.

401
00:36:05,254 --> 00:36:07,460
Who do you think broke into the room?

402
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:10,964
Kids, maybe. Maybe worse.
lt's not the first time.

403
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:14,799
Would you like us to send a car
to check on you?

404
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:17,842
No, please. Police frighten these people.

405
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:21,935
l know what you mean.
They frighten me, too.

406
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:27,057
lt's too far out of your way.
l can't ask you to go to that much trouble.

407
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,392
Look, l really don't mind coming by.

408
00:36:29,528 --> 00:36:31,651
Promise, okay? All right?

409
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:36,281
Say, Nico, by the way,
when was your last confession?

410
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:39,203
My last confession?

411
00:36:39,288 --> 00:36:42,372
l'm a married man.
l have no sins to confess.

412
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:46,710
You're a police officer.
You got a lot of sins to confess.

413
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:48,622
He's got your number!

414
00:36:49,256 --> 00:36:53,965
-ls that your impression of police officers?
-l want to see you in church Sunday, okay?

415
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:57,007
l feel better when you're in church, okay?

416
00:36:57,264 --> 00:36:59,636
You don't show up, l'll call your mother!

417
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:02,133
l wish you would. She loves you.

418
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:05,978
Why don't you go to church?
lt'll be good for you.

419
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:08,142
Get your soul saved.

420
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:27,543
Our leaders tell us...

421
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:30,249
...and talk to us about them and us.

422
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:34,630
But almighty God talks to us...

423
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:37,800
...about all of mankind...

424
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:41,010
...as one.

425
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:43,972
Now, we have an obligation...

426
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:47,219
...to find out what is the truth.

427
00:37:49,024 --> 00:37:51,811
We need to study. We need to question.

428
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:55,612
We need to read and we need to find out...

429
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:58,313
...what they are doing in our name.

430
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:04,240
And we must support those brave souls...

431
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:06,874
...who seek...

432
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,329
...the truth.

433
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,207
God bless us. Amen.

434
00:39:03,432 --> 00:39:04,760
Get down!

435
00:39:54,316 --> 00:39:56,688
There's nothing else we can do.

436
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,689
Lord God, Heavenly Father...

437
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:07,321
...receive the soul of our dear
departed friend, Father Joseph Gennaro.

438
00:40:12,501 --> 00:40:13,580
Come on.

439
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:26,761
Get a list of everybody treated here today.
Everybody.

440
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:29,090
Find those sanctuary people...

441
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,849
...the ones we found hiding
in the bottom of the church.

442
00:40:33,188 --> 00:40:37,435
l want to know where they're from
and who might want to harm them.

443
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:40,100
Where are you gonna be?

444
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:42,983
Just stay by the radio. l'll find you.

445
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:02,504
-He didn't make it.
-Oh, Nico!

446
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:04,083
Oh, no!

447
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,564
Lieutenant Strozah, these are FBl agents:
Halloran, Neeley.

448
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:28,236
Sweetheart, go to the car.
l'll be right there, okay? Take Mama.

449
00:41:33,582 --> 00:41:36,453
Nico, you okay? How's the family doing?

450
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,921
Excuse me. l'd like to have a word
with you.

451
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:42,454
Alone.

452
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,937
What the hell is it?

453
00:41:57,022 --> 00:41:59,596
lt's you, that's what the fuck it is!

454
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:01,353
Keep your goddamn hands off me!

455
00:42:01,443 --> 00:42:03,483
-You let Salvano walk.
-Salvano?

456
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,104
Yeah.

457
00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:06,189
What are you, crazy?
What does he have to do with this?

458
00:42:06,281 --> 00:42:08,523
That was no cherry bomb, that was C-4.

459
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:11,986
l've used that shit. l know what it
smells like and what it blows like.

460
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,373
Salvano never came near that C-4.
lt's in federal holding right now.

461
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:19,210
Besides, why would Salvano
blow up a church?

462
00:42:19,294 --> 00:42:21,204
l tailed him two days ago.

463
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:25,246
He and his goon were in that church
and they weren't taking communion.

464
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:28,545
l saw the woman who planted the bomb
and she was with Salvano's lawyer.

465
00:42:28,637 --> 00:42:30,796
Now, l want some fucking answers.

466
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:32,888
You tailed him after l ordered you off?

467
00:42:32,975 --> 00:42:35,382
l want to know where Salvano is.

468
00:42:35,978 --> 00:42:39,145
My orders were to release him,
not babysit him.

469
00:42:39,982 --> 00:42:42,224
You think you're rough stuff.

470
00:42:42,317 --> 00:42:46,018
Martial arts hero, chop-suey crap!
Let me tell you something.

471
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:49,233
You're not bulletproof.
You're not even a good cop.

472
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:51,816
You sneak around
playing your street-dick games...

473
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:56,371
...and all you come up with is conjecture,
wild coincidence and bullshit!

474
00:42:56,457 --> 00:43:00,371
l want the name of the federal agent
who signed for those explosives.

475
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:02,252
You do your job, l'll do mine.

476
00:43:02,337 --> 00:43:03,997
Bank on it, pal.

477
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:17,572
-Gentlemen.
-Hello.

478
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:19,572
Hi, how are you doing?

479
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:30,421
-How are you doing?
-Terrific.

480
00:44:32,678 --> 00:44:34,754
The wallet. Let me see it.

481
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,676
Aide to Senator Harrison.

482
00:44:51,572 --> 00:44:55,404
l hope l find you, you greasy mother!
l'm gonna kick your ass!

483
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:58,115
Who the fuck do you think you are?

484
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:10,336
l'm in front of St. Mary's church, where
seven people were killed by a bomb--

485
00:45:50,464 --> 00:45:53,037
-You guys stay out of trouble.
-Okay, Nico.

486
00:45:58,847 --> 00:46:01,136
-l hear you're looking for Salvano.
-You heard that?

487
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,339
l know where he's at.

488
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:05,269
-Where's that?
-Right here, motherfucker!

489
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:09,269
-lt's a long way from Kansas, Dorothy!
-Relax, man. Relax.

490
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:13,059
l won't shoot you.
These guys will beat you to death.

491
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:15,395
You come to our neighborhood,
fuck with our people.

492
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:18,406
Now our people are going to fuck with you.

493
00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:44,933
We need a doctor!

494
00:46:47,813 --> 00:46:49,141
Fuck him up!

495
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:50,891
You motherfucker!

496
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,494
Don't kill me! Please don't kill me!

497
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,835
-Who sent you?
-Nobody!

498
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,245
''Nobody?'' You did this for fun?

499
00:47:58,926 --> 00:48:00,503
Jimmy Costanza!

500
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:06,432
lf l find out you're lying, l'll come back
and kill you in your own kitchen.

501
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:07,715
Salvano!

502
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,804
Bautista Salvano!

503
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:15,851
-That's my buddy, man.
-Yeah, man, l know him.

504
00:48:18,987 --> 00:48:20,530
Sic him, Bulldog.

505
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:23,864
-Why are you fuckin' with my friend?
-l'm not in the mood.

506
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,742
Fuck your mood, man.

507
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,242
-What's happening?
-What it be like, homey?

508
00:48:33,335 --> 00:48:35,209
-That was real good, man.
-Peace, brother.

509
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:39,507
The mayor has announced the city"s offer
of a $25,000 reward for information...

510
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:43,091
...leading to the arrest and conviction
of anyone responsible...

511
00:48:43,178 --> 00:48:46,013
...for today"s tragic
St. Mary"s church bombing.

512
00:48:46,348 --> 00:48:48,257
Why were we in church?

513
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:50,887
l'll tell you what.

514
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:56,773
l'm willing to break the rules and
l'm willing to tell you everything l know.

515
00:48:56,859 --> 00:48:58,768
l just want some time.

516
00:49:01,697 --> 00:49:03,405
lt's probably Jax.

517
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:06,193
Yeah, Jax. This better be good.

518
00:49:06,285 --> 00:49:07,696
lt's bad, Nico.

519
00:49:09,538 --> 00:49:11,281
Long time, Nelson.

520
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:17,122
Come on, man! You know better
than to use a name on an open line.

521
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:22,546
l'm gonna talk for 15 seconds,
and then l'm getting off.

522
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:27,219
You're in trouble, Nico.
Serious, serious trouble.

523
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,882
Really? That's fascinating.

524
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,638
Take your wife and family
and get them someplace safe, now!

525
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,348
l've been wanting to bring my family
to Switzerland. l just haven't had time.

526
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:42,226
You hear me? Now!
l'm risking my ass by telling you this.

527
00:49:42,988 --> 00:49:46,108
Okay, don't take so long
to call me next time.

528
00:49:46,408 --> 00:49:48,068
Good luck, paisà.

529
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:05,382
Why is the ClA calling you
at 2:00 in the morning?

530
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:09,801
Because Fox is a crazy asshole.

531
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:15,894
He gets drunk, he forgets he's halfway
around the world, and he calls.

532
00:50:18,774 --> 00:50:22,688
He says he just wanted to know
if we got his Christmas card.

533
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:25,735
Listen, don't be that way.

534
00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:29,274
-l'm just so scared.
-Don't be.

535
00:50:29,785 --> 00:50:32,869
l'm gonna take care of everything,
all right?

536
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:36,791
All right?

537
00:50:46,468 --> 00:50:48,212
Nico, who's there?

538
00:51:02,651 --> 00:51:06,316
O'Hara, what's going on, man?
lsn't it a little early for breakfast?

539
00:51:06,405 --> 00:51:08,065
Nico, how you doing?

540
00:51:08,407 --> 00:51:10,316
l'm sorry. l gotta take you downtown.

541
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:12,567
The Feds want to talk. lt'll work out.

542
00:51:12,661 --> 00:51:14,820
Here's the warrant, Toscani.

543
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:19,958
You fucking piece of shit.

544
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,166
l'll take that, thank you.

545
00:51:22,504 --> 00:51:26,549
Easy guys! He's my friend. Take it easy.
lt's gonna work out. Let's go.

546
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:29,634
lt'll work out. l'm real sorry about this.

547
00:51:36,518 --> 00:51:38,844
lt's not necessary! This is ridiculous!

548
00:51:38,937 --> 00:51:42,104
Let him play his pussy game.
This is his setup.

549
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:45,900
Who do you think you are coming here
and treating my son like a criminal?

550
00:51:45,986 --> 00:51:47,397
Who do you think you are?

551
00:51:47,488 --> 00:51:50,857
-Just stop it! There's an infant here!
-Easy, easy.

552
00:51:52,951 --> 00:51:56,617
-Check that coat.
-Why don't you come check it, asshole.

553
00:51:57,456 --> 00:51:58,369
Take it easy!

554
00:51:58,457 --> 00:52:01,458
Why don't you come
and put your hands on me!

555
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,628
-Get him out of here!
-Everything's gonna work out.

556
00:52:06,715 --> 00:52:09,467
Come on. l'll be back in three hours!

557
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,339
The Police Association's
got lawyers for this!

558
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:17,557
You can't do this!

559
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,810
This guy, in the middle of the day,
comes in my place and starts wrecking it.

560
00:52:28,904 --> 00:52:30,980
He assaults my customers.

561
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:36,242
He starts doing all this outer-space stuff,
putting my customers in orbit even.

562
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:40,790
l remember those violations
you told me he was guilty of.

563
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:43,200
Look, this is my boy, right here.

564
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:45,080
They finally got you, huh?

565
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,044
They finally got you, motherfucker.

566
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:49,622
l told you it was gonna go down.
Should've listened--

567
00:52:49,717 --> 00:52:50,582
There he is.

568
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:54,009
You guys got one hell
of a police department around here.

569
00:52:54,096 --> 00:52:56,551
l got a cousin in the department
in New Orleans.

570
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,882
You ever heard of Bob Bouquet?

571
00:53:07,234 --> 00:53:09,392
Put your ass in that chair.

572
00:53:12,906 --> 00:53:15,907
lllegal wiretaps, unauthorized surveillance.

573
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:18,574
When was this guy born?

574
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:22,327
You're quite a cop, Toscani.
You don't listen to anybody, do you?

575
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:24,871
-Where's Jax?
-She's out of this!

576
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,869
You're the rotten apple in this barrel.

577
00:53:26,962 --> 00:53:29,797
We don't need to look any farther
than you and your family.

578
00:53:29,882 --> 00:53:31,709
-You, mother--
-Nico!

579
00:53:32,926 --> 00:53:35,085
Do you want to go to prison?

580
00:53:36,138 --> 00:53:37,716
Unlawful entry.

581
00:53:37,973 --> 00:53:40,760
-lllegal search and seizure.
-Deputy....

582
00:53:43,645 --> 00:53:46,599
Who do you think is pulling their strings?

583
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:49,563
Who do you think they work for?

584
00:53:49,985 --> 00:53:52,690
You were ordered to back off on Salvano.

585
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,528
l suppose you had too big a hard-on
for that, didn't you?

586
00:53:56,992 --> 00:53:59,234
You can't be in on this, Fred.

587
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,576
You're officially suspended, Toscani.

588
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,538
l want your badge and your gun.

589
00:54:13,842 --> 00:54:15,586
You gonna hold me?

590
00:54:16,136 --> 00:54:17,963
You can walk for now.

591
00:54:19,098 --> 00:54:20,675
Don't walk far.

592
00:54:29,983 --> 00:54:31,810
Sara, l'm all right.

593
00:54:32,861 --> 00:54:34,984
lt's okay, and l love you.

594
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:39,939
Tell Mama not to worry. All right?

595
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:42,113
l love you. 'Bye.

596
00:54:43,706 --> 00:54:46,031
What the hell is going on?
What's happening here?

597
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:51,000
The sanctuary people, they're refugees
from El Salvador, Guatemala and Chile.

598
00:54:51,338 --> 00:54:53,960
They're terrified of cops.
They're not even talking to me.

599
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:58,462
Down at the morgue, they got a guy
who was not a congregation member.

600
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:01,216
Alan Singletary.

601
00:55:02,182 --> 00:55:05,634
He's an aide to Senator Harrison.
The Foreign Relations Committee Harrison.

602
00:55:05,728 --> 00:55:09,939
The guy who's been crawling all over
the Central American drug connections.

603
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,316
You're gonna make a hell of a DA.

604
00:55:12,401 --> 00:55:16,481
Harrison's staff has been compiling
some kind of heavyweight white paper.

605
00:55:16,822 --> 00:55:20,950
lt implicates some of the major
intelligence agencies in drug trafficking.

606
00:55:21,035 --> 00:55:22,992
They'll release it next week.

607
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,410
-So that's how Fox knew.
-Who?

608
00:55:27,082 --> 00:55:31,993
An old Agency buddy of mine called me
last night. He said my family's in danger.

609
00:55:32,087 --> 00:55:33,879
Luke, l need a favor.

610
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:37,333
l need you to go to the house, call
Uncle Branca. Mama's got the number.

611
00:55:37,426 --> 00:55:39,134
Get the family ready to move out.

612
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:42,802
You got it, buddy.
They took away your pistola, right?

613
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,171
Yeah.

614
00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:46,466
Thanks.

615
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,138
l don't believe this.

616
00:56:01,116 --> 00:56:05,031
You come in here, with the children,
and bring all this up--

617
00:56:07,247 --> 00:56:08,410
Listen.

618
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:09,957
You know me.

619
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:12,249
Please, tell these people...

620
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:14,625
...they don't have anything to worry about.

621
00:56:14,713 --> 00:56:17,667
There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola.

622
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:19,711
l know, Sister.

623
00:56:28,977 --> 00:56:30,637
Father Tomasino.

624
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:34,391
He came alone...

625
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,932
...two weeks ago. He had papers...

626
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:41,485
...papers to give to the senator.

627
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:45,942
Father Tomasino was going
to give the mass that day.

628
00:56:46,912 --> 00:56:49,485
Father Gennaro talked him out of it.

629
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:52,411
He was afraid for Father Tomasino.

630
00:56:52,835 --> 00:56:55,919
So it was Father Tomasino
they wanted to kill.

631
00:56:58,507 --> 00:56:59,752
Where is Father Tomasino?

632
00:56:59,842 --> 00:57:02,083
He go, mister. He ran away.

633
00:57:02,845 --> 00:57:06,842
lf anybody knows where he is, you've got
to tell me because l know l can help him.

634
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:08,841
We don't know, mister.

635
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:24,772
Jax, l'm serious. You're out of this.

636
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:28,532
Wait a minute. l got a list.
You told me to get a list.

637
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,784
l'm telling you, you're finished.
l mean it. Out.

638
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:35,448
You're not talking to a rookie,
you understand?

639
00:57:35,544 --> 00:57:39,838
You go home, you take care of your family,
okay, and l'll call you.

640
00:57:42,885 --> 00:57:44,343
Paperwork only!

641
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,842
l'm gonna do what l have to do.

642
00:57:49,975 --> 00:57:51,304
Thank you!

643
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:10,279
Okay, come across now.
Come on, baby, come on.

644
00:58:13,207 --> 00:58:14,535
Hi, Nico!

645
00:58:38,857 --> 00:58:40,980
-Call the police.
-Come on!

646
00:58:45,364 --> 00:58:47,191
Freeze, motherfucker!

647
00:58:47,366 --> 00:58:49,358
Anybody moves, he dies.

648
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:52,620
Drop that magazine, motherfucker, now!

649
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:57,289
Everybody's gonna ditch their weapons,
butt first.

650
00:58:57,376 --> 00:59:00,377
Grab the barrel and do it, everybody. You!

651
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:02,292
Now, you.

652
00:59:02,923 --> 00:59:04,038
Now, you.

653
00:59:05,968 --> 00:59:07,795
Put your hands on your head.

654
00:59:07,886 --> 00:59:10,377
All right, fall in behind the last man.

655
00:59:10,472 --> 00:59:13,426
l don't think you can drop us all, badass.

656
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,224
You're right, but l'll get an ''A'' for effort.

657
00:59:16,311 --> 00:59:18,221
All right. Let's go. Fall out!

658
00:59:18,313 --> 00:59:20,306
Put your hands on your head.

659
00:59:20,399 --> 00:59:22,226
Come on, you! Move!

660
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:31,950
Please don't come in here. Please, please.

661
00:59:32,411 --> 00:59:34,071
Not in my store.

662
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:36,903
lt's a police emergency. l'm a cop.

663
00:59:36,999 --> 00:59:40,000
On your knees. Give me the phone.
Let's go.

664
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:44,005
-This guy's gotta work, too.
-Get down, asshole.

665
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:45,667
Get the fuck down!

666
00:59:45,924 --> 00:59:47,087
You wanna get down?

667
00:59:47,176 --> 00:59:49,548
Get down on your fucking knees!

668
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:12,982
They tell me, ''Come to America! ''

669
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,789
No, not in my store!

670
01:00:22,461 --> 01:00:24,252
There's the police!

671
01:00:29,301 --> 01:00:30,712
No, mister!

672
01:00:52,533 --> 01:00:54,324
Another police car.

673
01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:59,990
Look! My store.

674
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:07,501
Come on, come on. ls it clear?

675
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,958
Sara, Branca will take care of us.
We'll be safe there.

676
01:01:12,761 --> 01:01:15,928
Family goes in the Lincoln.
l'll ride in front.

677
01:01:26,024 --> 01:01:29,690
l'll be five minutes behind you.
lt's got to be this way.

678
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:33,275
Let's go.

679
01:01:35,117 --> 01:01:36,148
Where's Jax?

680
01:01:36,243 --> 01:01:39,577
She thinks there's some documents
in some guy's apartment.

681
01:01:41,248 --> 01:01:43,537
They killed the wrong priest.

682
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:46,701
What are you talking about?

683
01:01:51,133 --> 01:01:53,802
l'll tell you what l'm talking about.

684
01:01:55,137 --> 01:01:57,758
The second priest from Costa Rica...

685
01:01:59,391 --> 01:02:03,223
...hiding in the church.
He was the one they meant to kill.

686
01:02:03,604 --> 01:02:05,347
You know where to find this guy?

687
01:02:05,439 --> 01:02:06,850
No, l do not.

688
01:02:08,067 --> 01:02:09,976
Then you're gonna need help.

689
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:12,394
Yeah, l'd like you to help me.

690
01:02:12,571 --> 01:02:14,231
Watch my family.

691
01:02:14,823 --> 01:02:16,732
What are you gonna do?

692
01:02:17,242 --> 01:02:19,152
You don't want to know.

693
01:02:32,174 --> 01:02:34,926
Freeze! Put your hands up in the air.

694
01:02:35,177 --> 01:02:37,846
Now go put them on the hood of the car.

695
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:43,141
Special Agent Neeley, what were you doing
with that woman up there?

696
01:02:43,435 --> 01:02:48,144
Were you engaging in some kind
of unnatural sex acts with that young lady?

697
01:02:48,857 --> 01:02:50,435
She must be 15!

698
01:02:51,193 --> 01:02:53,186
That's illegal in some states, you know.

699
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:54,607
What are you talking about?

700
01:02:54,696 --> 01:02:58,148
l thought you federal agents were straight,
honorable guys.

701
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:00,567
Does your wife know about this?

702
01:03:01,537 --> 01:03:03,778
Sex is not the only thing in life.

703
01:03:03,872 --> 01:03:05,117
Get in.

704
01:03:14,425 --> 01:03:16,880
-So, how has your day been?
-Okay.

705
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,802
Listen, Toscani, l want to congratulate you.

706
01:03:22,891 --> 01:03:25,133
You just made number four
on the ''most-wanted'' list.

707
01:03:25,227 --> 01:03:27,979
Number four? l want to be number one.

708
01:03:30,232 --> 01:03:31,810
The day is young.

709
01:03:35,237 --> 01:03:36,316
What can l do for you?

710
01:03:36,405 --> 01:03:40,734
There was a quantity of C-4 explosive
brought in here four days ago.

711
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:42,660
Hell, that's gone.

712
01:03:42,745 --> 01:03:44,155
-When?
-Right away.

713
01:03:44,246 --> 01:03:47,200
They scooped that stuff out of here
before it even got tagged.

714
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:48,951
You know who took it?

715
01:03:49,251 --> 01:03:50,247
ClA.

716
01:03:53,547 --> 01:03:55,504
Let me see the paperwork on it.

717
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:57,251
You got to sign.

718
01:03:57,426 --> 01:04:01,887
Yeah, l remember that fellow.
Flew special out of Langley. Bomb tech.

719
01:04:02,347 --> 01:04:04,055
Real nice fellow.

720
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:06,259
-l'll bet.
-Here it is.

721
01:04:06,727 --> 01:04:07,758
''Fox.''

722
01:04:08,187 --> 01:04:09,597
''Nelson Fox.''

723
01:04:14,193 --> 01:04:15,770
-Thanks.
-Right.

724
01:04:17,529 --> 01:04:18,692
Now what?

725
01:04:19,948 --> 01:04:24,527
Yes, sir. The agent has been with
the Central American desk since 1984.

726
01:04:24,953 --> 01:04:27,623
Thank you. That's what l wanted to know.

727
01:04:27,706 --> 01:04:30,078
All right, take your shoes off.

728
01:04:30,959 --> 01:04:32,619
Come on, let's go.

729
01:04:34,755 --> 01:04:37,328
So you think l'm a bad cop, Neeley?

730
01:04:38,217 --> 01:04:40,375
You know something? Maybe l am.

731
01:04:40,469 --> 01:04:43,256
But at least l don't have my face
buried up Washington's ass.

732
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:46,182
Listen, Toscani.
Maybe l've judged you a little harshly.

733
01:04:46,266 --> 01:04:48,140
l think you have.
And you know something?

734
01:04:48,227 --> 01:04:51,477
What l'd like to do,
for the way you've treated me...

735
01:04:51,563 --> 01:04:54,481
...is treat you in a similar fashion.
l'd like you to get up...

736
01:04:54,566 --> 01:04:57,140
...run your ass over there
and jump in the fucking lake.

737
01:04:57,236 --> 01:04:59,727
lf you don't hurry,
l'll empty this gun in your butt.

738
01:04:59,822 --> 01:05:01,731
Move it, Agent Neeley!

739
01:05:04,576 --> 01:05:05,905
Let's go!

740
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:16,915
Jump, Neeley!

741
01:05:48,412 --> 01:05:50,535
Nico, what are you doing here?

742
01:05:50,622 --> 01:05:52,532
-l need a favor.
-Sure.

743
01:05:54,293 --> 01:05:57,377
-How late are you gonna be here today?
-l'm off at 6:00.

744
01:05:57,463 --> 01:05:58,838
l'll be here.

745
01:06:05,971 --> 01:06:08,296
Don't be too long, lady.
l got a crew coming in.

746
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,549
Thanks. We'll be done in a little while.

747
01:06:10,642 --> 01:06:12,302
We don't have much time.

748
01:06:12,394 --> 01:06:15,810
They're going to tear this goddamn place
down in a matter of hours.

749
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:18,649
There's no way to access
Covert Operations directly...

750
01:06:18,734 --> 01:06:22,732
...but l got a guy at Princeton.
He has a database bigger than Langley.

751
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,897
How the hell did you get in this mess?

752
01:06:26,992 --> 01:06:29,910
l thought you were finished with the ClA.

753
01:06:33,499 --> 01:06:34,874
Trap door.

754
01:06:45,344 --> 01:06:47,586
We'll wriggle up these two...

755
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:50,047
...operative dossiers.

756
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:54,264
Start with my friend, Nelson.

757
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:10,275
Your friend has had a hell of a career.

758
01:07:10,369 --> 01:07:13,987
Give me the names of every Agency man
involved in this.

759
01:07:19,711 --> 01:07:21,953
Nico, what is going on here?

760
01:07:24,133 --> 01:07:25,543
Here we go.

761
01:07:26,135 --> 01:07:30,797
Five agents from the Central American
desk. All of them, trained assassins.

762
01:07:30,889 --> 01:07:35,302
They've all come to Chicago
in the last week and they're all still here.

763
01:07:36,395 --> 01:07:39,396
They got the whole fucking
killing team here.

764
01:07:39,481 --> 01:07:41,141
lt looks that way.

765
01:07:45,612 --> 01:07:46,857
Thanks.

766
01:07:49,408 --> 01:07:50,736
l owe you one.

767
01:07:50,826 --> 01:07:53,910
-Where are you going?
-l gotta find that priest.

768
01:07:53,996 --> 01:07:55,407
Be careful.

769
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:01,494
I find this totally incredulous.

770
01:08:01,587 --> 01:08:05,999
You, being a station chief at the CIA,
didn"t know what was going on?

771
01:08:06,091 --> 01:08:08,333
Mr. Senator,
I"d like to explain a few things.

772
01:08:08,427 --> 01:08:12,555
Either you perjured yourself earlier,
or you"re lying to us now.

773
01:08:13,432 --> 01:08:16,101
Take a few moments
before you answer this.

774
01:08:16,185 --> 01:08:18,510
And remember that you"re under oath.

775
01:08:18,604 --> 01:08:23,349
It was agreed this was a valuable asset
and that I had to work out a way...

776
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:26,016
...they had to work out a way
in which to take over.

777
01:08:26,111 --> 01:08:28,863
And did that include
giving money to the enterprise?

778
01:08:28,947 --> 01:08:30,774
Not insofar as I knew.

779
01:08:30,866 --> 01:08:33,357
-And the colonel never told you?
-No.

780
01:08:33,452 --> 01:08:36,619
Are you saying that this was going
to be a donation for the CIA...

781
01:08:36,705 --> 01:08:37,950
...as far as you were concerned?

782
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,700
We were going to walk away from it.

783
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:40,990
Hello.

784
01:08:42,461 --> 01:08:44,039
Oh, yes, Sister. Yes.

785
01:08:44,129 --> 01:08:45,921
Sister Mary, right.

786
01:08:47,216 --> 01:08:51,344
No, there will be no problem.
Now just calm down. Right, right.

787
01:08:51,637 --> 01:08:53,214
Now where are you?

788
01:09:05,734 --> 01:09:06,979
Who is it?

789
01:09:37,975 --> 01:09:38,674
Father!

790
01:09:38,767 --> 01:09:40,594
Get her out of here.

791
01:09:43,856 --> 01:09:45,516
This way, Father.

792
01:10:39,244 --> 01:10:41,154
Where did you find this guy?

793
01:10:41,246 --> 01:10:45,161
The nun from the daycare called.
She's with the priest at a place on Damon.

794
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:48,500
She saw two guys sneaking
around the church and she got scared.

795
01:10:48,587 --> 01:10:50,496
l got papers from that senator's aide.

796
01:10:50,589 --> 01:10:55,168
Everything Harrison has been working on.
lt's unbelievable. lt's over at my place.

797
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:59,554
l need you to do me a favor.
Stay out of it. Just stay in the car.

798
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,804
Nico, far be it for me to complain...

799
01:11:04,353 --> 01:11:08,516
...but you got Jax pulling burglaries.
You got me doing God only knows what.

800
01:11:08,607 --> 01:11:12,023
When we hit the joint,
l don't want you celling with me.

801
01:11:12,111 --> 01:11:14,436
Jax, we'll work out something.

802
01:11:29,128 --> 01:11:32,164
Why don't you go over there
and sweet-talk him?

803
01:11:32,256 --> 01:11:33,287
Sure.

804
01:11:42,808 --> 01:11:46,592
lf l were you, l would listen
to what this man has to say.

805
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:49,971
He knows what's best for you.

806
01:12:02,661 --> 01:12:05,579
You wouldn't lie to me would you, Father?

807
01:12:06,206 --> 01:12:07,617
lt's a sin.

808
01:12:08,751 --> 01:12:10,079
Look at me!

809
01:12:10,335 --> 01:12:14,285
lf you spoke to anyone
about our plans to kill the senator...

810
01:12:15,048 --> 01:12:16,756
...tell me now...

811
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:20,299
...and l won't have to use this.

812
01:12:20,387 --> 01:12:23,258
This is from confession. l tell no one.

813
01:12:40,699 --> 01:12:41,862
Let's go.

814
01:12:46,455 --> 01:12:49,124
Under no circumstances
are you to come out of this car.

815
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:51,284
Just stay here, all right?

816
01:12:56,715 --> 01:12:58,708
Take a nice look at it.

817
01:12:58,801 --> 01:13:00,710
l got it just for you.

818
01:13:06,809 --> 01:13:08,718
Do you feel that? Nice?

819
01:13:09,895 --> 01:13:11,437
You like that?

820
01:13:15,067 --> 01:13:18,187
Now you're gonna start feeling
something warm.

821
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:20,526
Very warm and wonderful.

822
01:13:21,073 --> 01:13:22,484
Think about it.

823
01:13:22,825 --> 01:13:24,533
Warm. l love it!

824
01:13:26,412 --> 01:13:29,662
l enjoy this. l really enjoy the shit out
of this thing.

825
01:13:29,748 --> 01:13:31,540
We'll enjoy it together.

826
01:13:31,834 --> 01:13:35,452
You've always been alone.
Now you'll be with me, together!

827
01:13:53,355 --> 01:13:55,597
l want to know who you told.

828
01:13:56,942 --> 01:13:58,484
l told them...

829
01:14:00,404 --> 01:14:01,946
...you make...

830
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:04,107
...the children see you...

831
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:06,858
...mutilating their mothers...

832
01:14:07,953 --> 01:14:09,744
...and sometimes...

833
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:12,365
...you do these things...

834
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:14,583
...to the children.

835
01:14:15,878 --> 01:14:17,751
Did you tell anybody?

836
01:14:20,883 --> 01:14:22,756
Damn it, tell me now!

837
01:14:23,427 --> 01:14:24,886
Tell me now!

838
01:14:31,226 --> 01:14:33,764
Father, I have had enough of this.

839
01:14:35,898 --> 01:14:38,768
Father, l want you to tell me the truth.

840
01:14:40,152 --> 01:14:41,812
Can we kill him?

841
01:14:42,905 --> 01:14:46,238
lf you told anyone about our plans
to kill the senator...

842
01:14:46,325 --> 01:14:48,234
...we cannot kill him!

843
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:51,276
Nothing!

844
01:14:58,128 --> 01:14:59,409
Phase two.

845
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:07,084
Christ!

846
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:32,409
-Move it!
-What are you doing? Get out of here.

847
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:38,283
Jax, get the hell out of here!

848
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:47,124
Nico!

849
01:15:54,351 --> 01:15:55,466
Jax!

850
01:16:03,569 --> 01:16:05,146
-Go!
-l got him!

851
01:16:25,549 --> 01:16:27,008
Where is he?

852
01:16:28,552 --> 01:16:29,963
Down there!

853
01:16:35,642 --> 01:16:39,011
l got a bona fide emergency here.
What am l supposed to do?

854
01:16:44,318 --> 01:16:45,646
-Shut the fuck up!
-Yes, sir.

855
01:16:45,736 --> 01:16:47,563
Get inside! Come on!

856
01:16:49,448 --> 01:16:51,856
l hear sirens but l don't see any cops.

857
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:54,987
lf they were cops,
they'd show me their badges, asshole.

858
01:16:55,079 --> 01:16:57,367
A bona fide gunfight, asshole!

859
01:17:00,042 --> 01:17:01,417
Get up front!

860
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,495
-Shut up! Be quiet!
-What the hell am l supposed to do?

861
01:17:05,589 --> 01:17:09,456
Get the car on Track 3 out of the way.
At least, get that out of the way.

862
01:17:09,551 --> 01:17:13,596
They got guns all over the place.
l got a carload of passengers.

863
01:18:21,165 --> 01:18:25,293
Damn it! Call Nico's uncle
and find out if he's heard from him.

864
01:18:26,253 --> 01:18:28,080
Shut up and save your strength.

865
01:18:28,172 --> 01:18:29,998
l'm okay. l'm okay.

866
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:32,250
-Where are we going?
-Cubicle D.

867
01:18:32,342 --> 01:18:34,050
l got on my vest.

868
01:18:37,139 --> 01:18:38,550
Where is he?

869
01:18:39,349 --> 01:18:40,725
What do you mean you don't know?

870
01:18:40,809 --> 01:18:43,561
We don't know what happened
to him, Branca.

871
01:18:43,645 --> 01:18:45,270
Yeah, she's gonna be all right.

872
01:18:45,355 --> 01:18:47,929
You hear anything, you let me know.

873
01:18:49,151 --> 01:18:50,349
Capisci?

874
01:18:53,489 --> 01:18:54,734
lt's Nico.

875
01:18:58,077 --> 01:18:59,571
Jesus Christ.

876
01:19:07,878 --> 01:19:10,001
The motherfuckers got Jax.

877
01:19:10,172 --> 01:19:12,081
Lukich called. She's not dead.

878
01:19:12,174 --> 01:19:14,879
She's gonna make it.
She was wearing a vest.

879
01:19:31,485 --> 01:19:33,774
This was picked up with your mail
this morning.

880
01:19:33,862 --> 01:19:36,697
They're letting you know
if you don't back off...

881
01:19:36,782 --> 01:19:38,774
...they're gonna get to your family.

882
01:19:38,867 --> 01:19:41,441
-You've got to do it, Nico.
-Tell him, Sara.

883
01:19:41,537 --> 01:19:43,363
You know you have to.

884
01:19:43,664 --> 01:19:45,455
Listen to her, Nicola.

885
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:47,118
This is your family.

886
01:19:47,209 --> 01:19:52,167
Ever notice how clean babies smell, like
nothing in the world has touched them?

887
01:20:02,766 --> 01:20:05,257
Mom, take him upstairs, will you?

888
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:11,311
Come, Giuliano, we'll go upstairs.

889
01:20:17,573 --> 01:20:19,649
Do you know why l love you?

890
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,160
What it is about you
that l've always loved?

891
01:20:23,287 --> 01:20:24,698
lt's pride.

892
01:20:26,457 --> 01:20:29,374
But, Nico, that pride may kill all of us.

893
01:20:35,799 --> 01:20:37,591
Swallow your pride.

894
01:20:40,471 --> 01:20:42,712
Choke on it, if you have to.

895
01:20:43,682 --> 01:20:46,600
-Lay it down, please.
-You know something?

896
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:51,391
There's nothing in this world
that l wouldn't do for my family.

897
01:20:51,815 --> 01:20:53,642
Nobody will harm us.

898
01:20:54,777 --> 01:20:57,268
l don't want you to worry. Okay?

899
01:21:35,275 --> 01:21:38,360
Not even you can hit him
at this range, Nico.

900
01:21:39,863 --> 01:21:41,737
That wasn't the plan, Nelson.

901
01:21:41,824 --> 01:21:43,282
Close range?

902
01:21:44,284 --> 01:21:47,736
lt'd never work. lt's rigged.
Scanned every 35 seconds.

903
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:50,747
l was thinking of a claymore on the roof--

904
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:52,323
No!

905
01:21:52,668 --> 01:21:55,788
The roof is wired, too.
Sensors every 15 feet.

906
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,256
Okay. Now you can move.

907
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:01,674
-lt's me. You don't have to treat me like--
-Slow!

908
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,260
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.
Move! Slow.

909
01:22:05,472 --> 01:22:08,924
You even look at me funny,
you're in the river, Toscani.

910
01:22:09,017 --> 01:22:12,303
l figured you'd do your recon
from this building.

911
01:22:14,398 --> 01:22:17,731
-You're looking fit.
-l'm getting a bit of a tire.

912
01:22:18,068 --> 01:22:20,690
-ls that your own tailor?
-Hong Kong.

913
01:22:21,363 --> 01:22:23,605
-You've come a long way.
-Yeah.

914
01:22:24,366 --> 01:22:25,647
Just walk.

915
01:22:27,369 --> 01:22:28,698
l don't believe you.

916
01:22:28,787 --> 01:22:32,867
What's so hard to believe?
l want to help you, you dumb guinea.

917
01:22:33,584 --> 01:22:35,956
l've been trying to talk
some sense into you.

918
01:22:36,044 --> 01:22:38,002
You're still ''Fox the Fixer.''

919
01:22:38,088 --> 01:22:42,168
lf l wanted to cap you,
l'd save myself all this damn chitchat.

920
01:22:42,718 --> 01:22:45,885
l'd make big points for myself
if l brought your scalp in.

921
01:22:45,971 --> 01:22:48,129
Shit, l'd be White House material.

922
01:22:48,307 --> 01:22:50,513
ls that what Zagon is,
one of your basement boys?

923
01:22:50,601 --> 01:22:54,468
Zagon's a rancher. 4,000 acres
in Costa Rica. Beautiful place.

924
01:22:54,563 --> 01:22:59,272
Beautiful place, huh? Was that bought
with opium money from the triangle?

925
01:22:59,818 --> 01:23:02,356
And a ton of coke a week
from other places.

926
01:23:02,446 --> 01:23:06,029
Which he funnels here through Salvano.
The company getting it's cut, of course.

927
01:23:06,116 --> 01:23:07,610
Legal tender.

928
01:23:08,994 --> 01:23:11,995
So war is still the greatest business, huh?

929
01:23:12,664 --> 01:23:16,828
These guys have started and financed
every war we've ever fought.

930
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,088
Nobody would believe me if l told them
the bankers were the ClA.

931
01:23:21,924 --> 01:23:24,628
Come on, Toscani, don't preach to me.

932
01:23:25,094 --> 01:23:27,300
So the senator couldn't be bought,
could he?

933
01:23:27,387 --> 01:23:32,096
He was gonna expose your plans to invade
Nicaragua with your fucking coke money.

934
01:23:32,351 --> 01:23:34,806
So the Agency clears Zagon
to cap his ass, right?

935
01:23:34,895 --> 01:23:36,852
Just keep walking, asshole.

936
01:23:36,939 --> 01:23:39,893
So some poor, innocent priest finds out.
He comes here.

937
01:23:39,983 --> 01:23:43,483
But you can't kill the senator
until you know if the padre has talked.

938
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:48,363
So Zagon comes in, ''Tell me,'' with his
little doctor bag. Only by then, l'm in on it.

939
01:23:48,784 --> 01:23:52,402
And you fucking know
l'm gonna recognize his handiwork.

940
01:23:53,622 --> 01:23:56,291
lf your name would've been Joe Smith,
l never would've caught it.

941
01:23:56,375 --> 01:23:59,162
But how many Nicola Toscanis are there?

942
01:23:59,711 --> 01:24:03,709
Tell me something, old buddy.
Do we kill our own senators now?

943
01:24:04,883 --> 01:24:06,294
Why not? The Romans did.

944
01:24:06,385 --> 01:24:09,302
-Are we the fucking Romans?
-We're an empire, too.

945
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:12,051
You don't believe that shit for a minute.

946
01:24:12,141 --> 01:24:13,718
Just walk. Go!

947
01:24:24,611 --> 01:24:26,022
Hold it, Nico.

948
01:24:28,657 --> 01:24:31,658
-Here's your key, sir.
-My buddy will drive.

949
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:40,125
You know something?

950
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:44,919
ln Europe, they're trying some 80-year-old
camp guard for Nazi war crimes.

951
01:24:45,716 --> 01:24:48,717
All around our country,
they got guys on Death Row...

952
01:24:48,802 --> 01:24:51,554
...for murdering one, two, three guys.

953
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:54,848
And they probably deserve
what they're gonna get.

954
01:24:54,933 --> 01:24:56,593
But you and l...

955
01:24:56,685 --> 01:24:59,093
...we know people
that are personally responsible...

956
01:24:59,188 --> 01:25:02,521
...for the death
of 50,000 non-military personnel.

957
01:25:03,192 --> 01:25:06,940
Librarians, teachers, doctors,
women, children, all dead.

958
01:25:07,905 --> 01:25:10,312
We've wiped out entire cultures.

959
01:25:10,574 --> 01:25:12,033
And for what?

960
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:17,155
Not one ClA agent has ever been tried,
much less accused, of any crimes.

961
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:22,538
You guys think you're above the law,
but you ain't above mine.

962
01:25:24,588 --> 01:25:28,372
Nico, we don't have time for this.
Get in the goddamn car.

963
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:55,737
l've been waiting for the day
l'd catch up with this motherfucker.

964
01:26:02,292 --> 01:26:04,665
Salvano and his scumbag dealer.

965
01:26:06,088 --> 01:26:08,080
What a team we got here.

966
01:26:08,298 --> 01:26:10,540
l told you, you'd never be the man.

967
01:26:10,634 --> 01:26:13,207
Nelson, we've been looking for you.

968
01:26:14,596 --> 01:26:16,139
l see that you...

969
01:26:16,765 --> 01:26:18,509
...found our friend.

970
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,059
Thanks, Fox.

971
01:26:20,519 --> 01:26:22,808
l didn't bring him. l swear it.

972
01:26:23,313 --> 01:26:26,018
You two must have had a lot to talk about.

973
01:26:26,108 --> 01:26:28,599
Reminiscing about the good old days?

974
01:26:28,694 --> 01:26:29,939
Stay still!

975
01:26:31,321 --> 01:26:33,314
Just fucking don't move.

976
01:26:33,657 --> 01:26:35,899
Nelson, bring our friend in.

977
01:26:40,789 --> 01:26:42,782
Come on, be a good boy.

978
01:26:44,126 --> 01:26:45,537
Dive, Nico!

979
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,934
Get that motherfucker!

980
01:27:20,662 --> 01:27:21,825
Move it!

981
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:26,288
Get him!

982
01:27:56,406 --> 01:27:58,399
Stop the car, you fuck!

983
01:28:04,623 --> 01:28:06,995
Stop the car, you piece of shit!

984
01:28:08,127 --> 01:28:09,407
Stop it!

985
01:28:27,438 --> 01:28:28,813
Fox's car!

986
01:29:13,734 --> 01:29:15,394
He"s on the ramp now.

987
01:29:15,486 --> 01:29:18,652
He"s coming out the Wabash entrance.
Get there, Deep Throat.

988
01:29:18,739 --> 01:29:21,277
Roger, Spike Leader. We read you.

989
01:29:30,334 --> 01:29:32,125
Get out of the car!

990
01:29:32,294 --> 01:29:34,002
l want him alive.

991
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:42,881
He's clean.

992
01:29:43,514 --> 01:29:45,091
Bring him over.

993
01:29:47,101 --> 01:29:48,429
Let's go!

994
01:29:51,313 --> 01:29:55,227
We're out of here.
Abandon the vehicles and get out of here.

995
01:29:56,026 --> 01:29:59,027
Tommy, hurry up! Get in.
We're out of here.

996
01:30:14,086 --> 01:30:17,336
Now, our honored guest,
Senator Ernest Harrison.

997
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:41,525
l hope this don't take too long
'cause l'm getting hungry.

998
01:30:48,787 --> 01:30:51,658
This is bullshit. We've got work to do.

999
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:55,412
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

1000
01:30:57,504 --> 01:31:01,751
We've got an hour before we say good-bye
to the honorable senator.

1001
01:31:02,134 --> 01:31:05,384
You know, you've got to learn
to take time to...

1002
01:31:06,054 --> 01:31:07,846
...smell the roses.

1003
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:11,640
How are you gonna do him?
Do him in the motorcade...

1004
01:31:12,102 --> 01:31:14,889
...or pass him through a hotel kitchen?

1005
01:31:24,031 --> 01:31:25,525
Put his face up.

1006
01:31:27,868 --> 01:31:29,113
Hold it up.

1007
01:31:30,204 --> 01:31:32,825
Here you go, Toscani. ''Dr. Feelgood.''

1008
01:31:47,262 --> 01:31:51,177
l've used these little beauties many times
to extract information.

1009
01:31:51,266 --> 01:31:53,592
For the first time in my life...

1010
01:31:53,936 --> 01:31:56,557
...l'm gonna do it just for the fun.

1011
01:31:59,274 --> 01:32:02,394
Get away from me with that,
you piece of shit!

1012
01:32:10,577 --> 01:32:12,202
That's it, fight it!

1013
01:32:12,287 --> 01:32:14,079
Fight it, cherry...

1014
01:32:14,957 --> 01:32:17,412
...so it speeds right on its way.

1015
01:32:17,626 --> 01:32:18,954
Fight it!

1016
01:32:19,461 --> 01:32:21,121
Keep fighting it!

1017
01:32:30,472 --> 01:32:32,631
Oh, you're a good boy, now.

1018
01:32:35,227 --> 01:32:37,765
That's what l've been waiting for.

1019
01:32:39,148 --> 01:32:40,428
Let him go.

1020
01:32:53,662 --> 01:32:55,987
Toscani, my sleeping beauty...

1021
01:32:56,623 --> 01:32:59,031
...you should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1022
01:32:59,126 --> 01:33:01,617
You're too fucking dumb, asshole.

1023
01:33:06,008 --> 01:33:07,550
Jake! Look out!

1024
01:33:46,048 --> 01:33:47,922
Say something. Nico?

1025
01:33:50,052 --> 01:33:51,048
ls there a doctor here?

1026
01:33:51,136 --> 01:33:53,176
Quick! Call an ambulance!

1027
01:33:56,975 --> 01:34:01,721
Agent Neeley, FBl. We've got a problem,
but we don't know what it is, yet.

1028
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:08,933
Please, Senator Harrison, this way.

1029
01:34:09,738 --> 01:34:13,985
We are standing in front of the home
of Police Sergeant Nico Toscani.

1030
01:34:14,076 --> 01:34:17,445
Behind me, the entourage
of Senator Harrison is arriving.

1031
01:34:17,538 --> 01:34:21,915
Lots of security here. We have police
officers on the scene and federal agents.

1032
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,001
Of course, there is concern
of a possible assassination attempt.

1033
01:34:25,087 --> 01:34:29,001
That"s why you"ve got
so many law enforcement officers here.

1034
01:34:33,262 --> 01:34:36,465
-This is Senator Harrison. Nico Toscani.
-How do you do?

1035
01:34:36,557 --> 01:34:38,383
Please, don't get up.

1036
01:34:38,767 --> 01:34:40,594
Detective Toscani...

1037
01:34:40,811 --> 01:34:44,678
...l just felt compelled to come
and thank you personally...

1038
01:34:44,773 --> 01:34:48,189
...and to assure you that we'll use
every resource available...

1039
01:34:48,277 --> 01:34:50,150
...to bring these men to justice...

1040
01:34:50,237 --> 01:34:54,566
...and to ensure that this type of behavior
will never be tolerated again.

1041
01:34:56,243 --> 01:34:58,034
That would be nice.

1042
01:34:58,454 --> 01:35:02,403
Let me introduce Roberta Alspaugh
of the Fifth Circuit Court.

1043
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:04,031
How do you do, ma'am?

1044
01:35:04,126 --> 01:35:06,451
Are you sure you're well enough?

1045
01:35:07,671 --> 01:35:10,755
l'm ready to talk if you're ready to listen.

1046
01:35:11,175 --> 01:35:12,420
All right.

1047
01:35:13,135 --> 01:35:16,753
-Miss Jackson, l'll leave you now.
-Senator, thank you.

1048
01:35:18,432 --> 01:35:22,560
-We'll be leaving for Washington.
-Hey buddy, we'll be back later.

1049
01:35:25,814 --> 01:35:27,356
Mr. Toscani...

1050
01:35:27,649 --> 01:35:30,983
...can you tell us about
your military background?

1051
01:35:35,157 --> 01:35:38,490
ln 1973, l worked for
a special operations group...

1052
01:35:39,787 --> 01:35:41,945
...in Vietnam and Cambodia.

1053
01:35:42,831 --> 01:35:45,702
l was involved with gathering intelligence.

1054
01:35:45,793 --> 01:35:50,122
All of the members of this team
were doctors recruited by the ClA...

1055
01:35:50,839 --> 01:35:54,339
...and trained at a secret camp
in Langley, Virginia.

1056
01:36:06,563 --> 01:36:10,146
Gentlemen, whenever you have a group
of individuals...

1057
01:36:10,609 --> 01:36:12,815
...who are beyond any investigation...

1058
01:36:12,903 --> 01:36:17,197
...who can manipulate the press,
judges, members of our Congress...

1059
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:22,322
...you"ll have within our government
those who are above the law.
