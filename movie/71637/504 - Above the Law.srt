1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,080
Of course there are concerns ...

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,620
... But this is a turning point for our country.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,100
That one coin we become part of a superpower.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,340
And bananas law and by decree of our leader ...

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,320
... Regent 't only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,710
Should I bring anything? - No. Pull your really that thing on?

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,860
Is that against the rules? - When the photographers you see ...

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,320
Wat is er? Geneer je je voor je man?
- Ja, nou en of.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,000
They found me.

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,330
Tomorrow. I go get the newspaper.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,620
Can not. I must give an honest answer to a question.

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Christina, you're the human face. People want to trust you.

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Simon?

14
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Are you it?

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,640
So I have to stick to the agreements. - Then you win.

16
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,860
I'm a politician, not a representative.

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,020
Shall we talk about it at lunch?

18
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Mrs Chance?

19
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,070
The judge is dead Chance. - That still does' t Barbour process?

20
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,720
He was constantly monitored.

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,080
An agent has him identified.

22
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,080
What was he doing here? - He pulled himself to the newspaper.

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,620
That he did not do the police.

24
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Where he gets that newspaper? - What's he doing here?

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,340
Two shots to the chest. He saw the shooter so.

26
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,950
There is rotated one engine, ten meters from where he lies.

27
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,600
Witnesses?

28
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,830
He walks out of the way here. An engine is behind it on. He turns around.

29
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,080
The motorcyclist shoots twice and drives off.

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,320
No amateur so.

31
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,620
His wife at home, if you want to speak 'r.

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,590
You know she was party leader in the European elections?

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,270
Quickly, the CID is for us.

34
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,540
Cameras, alarms, police at the door, all the technological rigmarole ...

35
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,300
... And they leave him alone 'fetch a newspaper.

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
Were you too pips or so?

37
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,910
The lady of the house? - In the kitchen.

38
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,520
I'm sorry to disturb you. Superintendent Dalziel, detective.

39
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,920
Detective Sergeant Pascoe and Novello.

40
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,040
My participation.

41
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,390
Can I ask you a few things?

42
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,550
What is your husband assumed the house?

43
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,030
Nine o'clock. A little later maybe.

44
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,390
Only?

45
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Your husband was guarded because he had threatened to 't process.

46
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,040
Why did not he come along or someone?

47
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,920
He found annoying.

48
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,390
It's my fault. I'm not to let go.

49
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,030
He did so often on Sunday morning?

50
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,880
He took the threats seriously?

51
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,520
I do not know.

52
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,790
He did not talk much about it.

53
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,900
He was found in Church Downswood.

54
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,040
A long way from the kiosk.

55
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,920
Any idea what he was doing there?

56
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,280
Dank u wel, Mrs Chance.

57
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,920
For now we know enough.

58
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,490
They think it's anything to do with drugs. How do we do this?

59
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,920
I call yet. Are you the police?

60
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,800
Is Mrs Chance in orde?
John Parker, haar PA. Is ze in gevaar?

61
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,280
How about yourself?

62
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,580
Has 't with' t make process? - I'm not going to speculate about.

63
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,280
Of course, you realize that this is a sensitive issue.

64
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,300
Can we discuss press statements?

65
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,790
Who did not come. Good day, Mr. Parker.

66
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,390
I came as soon as I heard it.

67
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,920
Look at that. Just fly in a dunghill.

68
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,300
I thought you escaped me. - I would never do, Rebecca.

69
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,300
You want me to work together with the CID. Trust me.

70
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,040
You're not very tactful.

71
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,520
Fun anyway, we clean up the mess of others.

72
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,270
Are you sure you do not vertilt?

73
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,590
Do you want to just handsome boys in Armani suits on the floor.

74
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Morning.

75
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,030
It seems that this "t work of one professional.

76
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,280
Hoofdverdachte is Mr Kenneth Barbour...

77
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,030
... Which was on trial for Mr. Chance ...

78
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,060
... To enter one large batch of heroin.

79
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,790
He should be guarded 24 hours a day ...

80
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,520
... But that's gone wrong and now we can solve it.

81
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:04,280
Maybe you know that Mrs. Chance candidate for the elections.

82
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,540
Journalists find this kind of nonsense exciting ...

83
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:15,400
... So if they ask us anything, we say they can in the tree. Understood?

84
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,110
We go all the houses down in the vicinity of the crime scene.

85
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,540
Sergeant Wield pulls the tire marks and see if the motorcyclist is seen.

86
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,520
Novello, you do contacts with CID.

87
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,820
Sergeant Pascoe and I go to Barbour.

88
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,640
Getting started then.

89
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,540
I'd rather not talk about it ...

90
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,270
... But we will have to come up with a press statement.

91
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,800
What? I do not know what happened.

92
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,030
I think it's really to bring it up.

93
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,400
But it closes 48 hours before the candidates.

94
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,030
If you are considering to withdraw, which should for the time.

95
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,390
Should I decide now?

96
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,400
It's terrible. Terrible.

97
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,080
I will say that you continue. That gets in any case the news.

98
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,030
Are you doing still busy with your work? Do not you see how she's ready?

99
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,540
You better not be seen together. Can close the curtains?

100
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,060
Leave us alone.

101
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,920
Fuck off. Right now.

102
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,060
We have to do something that stay with you. My reputation suffers.

103
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,060
I've got one invitation for Mr. Dalziel and 'partner'.

104
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,540
That is standard nowadays. - Not at the rugby club.

105
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:10,100
Maybe you should look for somebody else. Ellie rang. I'm going tonight to talk to her.

106
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,820
Is she back? - You never know.

107
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,770
Thank Goodness. Yet the family Pascoe's more his mind.

108
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,790
What would you get, Ken? 18?

109
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,040
Customs has set me up.

110
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,060
But one judge to explain ... That just doing his job.

111
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,280
Do you have proof? - They'll be here.

112
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,280
But it would be easier if you know.

113
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,920
You're all wrong, sir.

114
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,790
Someone has him death threats.

115
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Probably not his tailor. - I did not do it.

116
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,540
It is too much to expect cooperation from a rat like you ...

117
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,520
... But if you sit out ...

118
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,150
... Close them out so long that you fall on your beard.

119
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,400
We're wasting our time.

120
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,920
I wanted him not just dead.

121
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,510
The case would be canceled today. He said Friday that the customs ...

122
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,030
... Was to reveal the identity of their sources.

123
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,060
According to my lawyer, they never do and then they let me go.

124
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,540
Now I must again show a lot of time waiting for one retrial.

125
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,270
So if you discover who did it ...

126
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,390
... Keep him with me away.

127
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,910
Sorry to have bothered you.

128
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,820
What Barbour said, true. His lawyer is part of. The prosecution wanted to give it up.

129
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,800
Chance had more enemies?

130
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,520
So afraid he was no different.

131
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,520
Maybe he wanted to be as free.

132
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,540
Or did it feel anything else, he wanted to talk to no police?

133
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,540
Shall we ask the CID? They know more of his habits.

134
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,890
Yes, and those weasels tell us nothing of course.

135
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,060
We'll find out for yourself. - We can 't ask, right?

136
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,920
Whose side are you doing? Will you sometimes no responsibility?

137
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,520
Here we are again. - I want out. I feel so trapped.

138
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,030
We may realize the paper of your husband?

139
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,520
Mind if we bring anything? - No, do what you want.

140
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,830
What are you achieving? - In my office in Leeds. Can I leave?

141
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Of course.

142
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,280
Separate bedrooms. She 's doubles and he' s single.

143
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,030
Maybe they found that exciting.

144
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,520
Back and sneak weather, creaky boards ...

145
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,030
Stout hassle.

146
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,280
The queen has one private bedroom. - I smell lavender.

147
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,400
That you can not say to the modern police.

148
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Keep you at the license plates of visitors?

149
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,030
Who is that? - Mr. Deller. This is a family friend.

150
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,560
You mean? - He usually comes in the afternoon.

151
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,520
What? - I do not dare to guess.

152
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
I take this along.

153
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,030
So Christina has a boyfriend. - What did you do?

154
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,520
It has to be nothing.

155
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,920
Where's her office? - Leeds.

156
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,800
Looking Party headquarters? - Not really.

157
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,640
I am the matter to "explore t.

158
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,920
Do you want to drink something?

159
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,300
Perhaps this is not your kind of place.

160
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Right.

161
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Moment.

162
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,400
What will it be? - A beer.

163
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,400
Which would you prefer? - With that nice stop. That is certainly good.

164
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Sorry. Journalists. - It saves money.

165
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,920
Keeping it but change.

166
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,390
What do you want to know?

167
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,140
Mrs. Chance wins the election? - I hope so.

168
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,790
And if not? - I do not think for a moment.

169
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,390
Since I do not believe it.

170
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,030
Wie is dat?
- David Ransom, van Ransom Telecom.

171
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,280
This is his building. - Certainly rich?

172
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,790
25 million.

173
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,390
Then he can just pay the prices here.

174
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,390
Pascoe, half acht.

175
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,920
I thought you were not coming. - The babysitter was late.

176
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,520
I have not ordered yet. Cannelloni? - I have no appetite.

177
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,400
We would go to dinner? - I do nothing, okay?

178
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,920
What the hell? You're back? - I did not say that.

179
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:40,300
If you want to say, say so. Therefore, we are on neutral ground.

180
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,040
Do not hang from the policeman.

181
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,540
It is not all up to me. - I think I'll stay very reasonable.

182
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,790
You're left with our daughter.

183
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,880
You know why I left.

184
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,520
You are expected to see an occasional your husband.

185
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,510
You have something together. Otherwise it makes no sense.

186
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,300
Totally agree. But you sat with your mother.

187
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,540
I do my work without knowing whether you back.

188
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,510
You act as if my feelings do not matter.

189
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,400
It's either me or you work.

190
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,520
I took one decision.

191
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,320
I do not want to be married to his Dalziel boy.

192
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,540
You have nothing to do with your brain. You are intelligent. You can be anything.

193
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,790
But you throwing away it and I do not want to experience.

194
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,540
And I do not want to wait every night or you're coming home.

195
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,300
And I do not want you being a stranger to our daughter.

196
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,790
Are you really real?

197
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,300
Should I look for another job because I do's late coming home?

198
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,520
That's life just happens.

199
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,550
That's what happens when you have responsibility.

200
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,280
I can get a research job in London.

201
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,280
Come with me. That is a new beginning.

202
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Then you finally do something constructive.

203
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
It's your choice.

204
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,820
With Wield. Barbours lawyer called. He wants to talk.

205
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,820
Let Peter go. - I let him pick up tomorrow.

206
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,390
Goodbye, wieldy.

207
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,330
Peter Deller. I have an appointment with David Ransom.

208
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,160
Right now. David, I want to talk to you.

209
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,400
David, come at here. I need to talk to you.

210
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,040
You are here because I want to record what you say.

211
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,040
Where Dalziel? - Busy.

212
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,540
You have one good word for me.

213
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,520
I will see. - You're the only sergeant.

214
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Warrant.

215
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,920
What did you lose?

216
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,060
I do not know who him killed, but I do know what.

217
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,520
You've checked. - No, for the process.

218
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,510
Little digging, getting to know the enemy.

219
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,520
Judge Chance liked young men.

220
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,030
There he liked very much.

221
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,820
In?

222
00:24:52,920 --> 00:25:00,030
He once spent a night with one Simon Wallis. Lives in Leeds.

223
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,800
Who says that?

224
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,520
Strange, huh? He had such a beautiful woman.

225
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,030
As I vote on. - You can not vote.

226
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,920
True, Mr. Pascoe. I'm innocent.

227
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,520
What has Valais with murder?

228
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,520
The prison is dangerous.

229
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,280
Even for a guy like me.

230
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,920
I can not stick my neck too far.

231
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,920
Where do you want to go?

232
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,520
I've told you everything I know.

233
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,400
You as a detective but they must fit together.

234
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,790
What have you got him promised? - Nothing. I can really do something.

235
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,060
Track on which Wallis. I go to Mrs. Chance.

236
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,520
So we're looking for a jealous gay lover?

237
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,270
Who kills him during 't process to us to deceive.

238
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,820
How did 't with Ellie? She takes you back ...

239
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,800
... Or let them suffer like me?

240
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,910
You stand out, Andy.

241
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,580
Morgen, Mr Dalziel.
- Mrs Chance verwacht me.

242
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,520
She gets too much cash.

243
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,820
Tomorrow she say if she maintains her candidacy.

244
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,040
Terrible. - But with a murder ...

245
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,300
... The husband is of course important.

246
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,540
You want to know if they suspected? - That would be handy.

247
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,280
Not that we doubt her.

248
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,520
Frankly, I have no idea who did it.

249
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,400
Maybe you.

250
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
Morgen, Mrs Chance.

251
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,800
I see you, John.

252
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,910
Shall we go to my room?

253
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,060
You're going to wonder what I'm doing here, one day after the murder of my husband.

254
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,920
I don 't really yourself.

255
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,030
It's all very surreal.

256
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,920
You would do well to fix.

257
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,920
You must think of your supporters. - I were so noble.

258
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,520
Someone had latched on to your husband ...

259
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,520
... Or wanted him silenced.

260
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,030
Silenced?

261
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,520
What do you mean? - I do not know.

262
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,060
But I think he was quite complex together.

263
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,920
We all suffer from.

264
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,400
I'm sorry, Mrs. Chance, but I have to ask you this.

265
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,390
Whether he had homosexual relationships.

266
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,280
A list of names would be very welcome.

267
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,520
I have not.

268
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,800
We never really talked about it. He did not have.

269
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,390
You've never met them, the friends?

270
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,570
I know it sounds strange, but we were talking rather so.

271
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,920
It did not hit us.

272
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,390
Does the name Simon Wallis something?

273
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,790
A jealous lover commits such a murder is not unexpected.

274
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,910
Usually it gradually goes wrong.

275
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,400
I would have known. He had told.

276
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,520
This is the license plate of a car ...

277
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,030
... Often when you come to visit.

278
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,280
He is of a certain Peter Deller.

279
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,520
Is that a friend of yours?

280
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,640
A good friend?

281
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,320
I help Romanian children. He gave a lot of money.

282
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,520
We got one close.

283
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,340
But that was not difficult. Jerry's death was independent of Peter and me.

284
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,390
We were all good friends.

285
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,520
You tell it anyway to the press?

286
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
No way.

287
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,790
Mr Dalziel...

288
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,540
... I'd give anything to get back my husband.

289
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,920
Despite everything, I loved him very much.

290
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,390
We were good buddies.

291
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,540
All we know is that it was a terrain engine.

292
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,540
There is a footprint, but which is not usable.

293
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,510
No DNA encountered. - Witnesses?

294
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,800
A few people vaguely remember one engine, but what ...

295
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,300
I Simon Wallis his address. But he does not answer.

296
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,520
Search Novello and head him get.

297
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,920
Met 'n huiszoekingsbevel.

298
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,820
That Mrs. Chance, how important that is, politically?

299
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:13,520
According to the newspaper, they will sell us the euro. The neat face of Europe.

300
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,520
Why them? - She looks good.

301
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,040
Slim has been 'n successful lawyer. Speaks to ordinary people.

302
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:29,270
It could be. The noble widow is an unbeatable trump card.

303
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,880
That is far-fetched. - That's killing a bomb crater too.

304
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,280
Stone Cold.

305
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,390
Is vast al dagen dood.

306
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,400
Looks like an overdose.

307
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,880
Nowhere arrive. Call the precinct.

308
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,390
Take him just outside.

309
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,520
Z'n laptop is weg.

310
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,790
Look.

311
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,390
Lay on the mat. Posted in Wetherton.

312
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,820
Dear Simon, thanks for everything, but I can not go with it.

313
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,040
To Christina. You don 't understand it. Love, Jerry.

314
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,800
Van Chance.

315
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,300
Chance Wallis wants to leave his wife.

316
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,820
But Chance wants no scandal during the elections.

317
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:54,790
All or nothing, find Valais, killing Chance home and commits suicide.

318
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,540
He had not gotten the letter. - Phone call then?

319
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,890
A heroin overdose. That points out the blood test.

320
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,800
Suicide? - Maybe.

321
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,800
Otherwise, it 's really stupid mistake.

322
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,060
Apparently, not a user. Is there another note?

323
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,900
There was nothing. - Do you know the time of death?

324
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,280
Certainly. 36 to 48 hours ago.

325
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,800
So he was dead before Chance? - There goes my theory.

326
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,300
Wallis can 't have let do. Chance was not suicide.

327
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,060
Mrs. Chance may have discovered it. It could 'r her image costs.

328
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,820
And so did they murder them. - Such a type not she seems.

329
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,390
But of course one politician.

330
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,790
I have had many of the hundreds of messages of support.

331
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,520
Especially the people who pointed out to me ...

332
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,540
... That my husband died as a servant 's general interest.

333
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,640
The public interest, I would also like to serve.

334
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,160
With that thought in my head, I decided to continue.

335
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,030
My husband would have expected it.

336
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,040
I know I have with your support ...

337
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,330
... Will have more than enough power for victory.

338
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,630
Thank you very much.

339
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,150
Shoot you also so full?

340
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,640
Shall we take one pint?

341
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,750
A pint for my friend and a large vanilla latte for me.

342
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,040
This is still 't new Labour? Then I'll have a pint.

343
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,140
Excuse me. - Can I do something for you?

344
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,760
Probably not. - To speak to Mrs. Chance private?

345
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,780
Do not be. Will she have a drink with me?

346
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,160
Or you? A pink gin? Fits with your tie.

347
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,760
Modepop.

348
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,160
Here, you just pay it.

349
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,540
Brave decision. - Hopefully it 's also one good decision.

350
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,640
This we found this morning.

351
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,160
Al goed, John.

352
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,630
Is that the handwriting of your husband?

353
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,060
He's just sent to his death on Simon Wallis ...

354
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,760
... A 25-year-old programmer from Leeds.

355
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,760
Any idea where he is referring to?

356
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,270
Nee.

357
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,280
Wallis lay dead in his flat. Overdose.

358
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,870
Saturday deceased. We exclude nothing, as they say.

359
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,870
How can there be?

360
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,520
How are you doing? - Yeah.

361
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,060
Should you go after her so? She 's already so heavy.

362
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,160
We do our job, Mr. Deller.

363
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,640
Come on. I'll take you home.

364
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,040
However indiscreet of him. - Sitting in his nature.

365
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,760
Let Wield and Novello'm just tighten.

366
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,510
Home? - I go to someone.

367
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,160
Who then? - A lady.

368
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,160
Ha Ellie. Would I be allowed to see Sleeping Beauty?

369
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,690
Almost as nice as d'r mother.

370
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,040
Sorry for the mess. - Besides my house is a palace.

371
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,280
I adore your husband, but it's a slob.

372
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,540
He has a mother needed. - My assistant has given it.

373
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,780
She found socks of 'm in the oven. In order to dry.

374
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,870
Did he in college already.

375
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,160
He comes home? - I do not know.

376
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,520
He is turned on, if you mean.

377
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,760
If I have anything against him can say ...

378
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,540
Thank you. But you're not the right person for it.

379
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,640
How do you mean? - You're the problem.

380
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,160
His ambition keeps him home, not me.

381
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,520
Give him a chance, Ellie.

382
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,760
He loves you.

383
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,780
As much as he loves the police?

384
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,640
That brings no policeman.

385
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Just kidding, lovey.

386
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,760
That's not right.

387
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,160
So should think police officers.

388
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,520
You're a good man, Andy ...

389
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,040
... But Peter can not be like you.

390
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,520
Look at.

391
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,550
Het complete pathologische rapport
over Chance.

392
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,760
Six months ago, it has been determined one nerve disease.

393
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,280
Chance knew he could still work a half years when he was lucky.

394
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,780
Therefore, he felt sure of it okay to leave without escort.

395
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,030
Wallis was his laptop at his last employer.

396
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,670
With his administration on it. He did a lot for Ransom.

397
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,760
There was Peter Deller still some moth along in Leeds?

398
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,750
Deller and Ransom put together a computer leasing company on.

399
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,300
That is sold. Ten million men.

400
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,300
Deller takes' t it. Ransom has set up one new company.

401
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,510
Mrs. Chance Ransom is in its building. They know each other fixed by Deller.

402
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,760
Good work, Peter. But what does' t all?

403
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,510
Ransom is in mobile telephony. He wants in Europe.

404
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,760
That means one hope bureaucracy. There they can do something.

405
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,030
I smell something, Peter.

406
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,000
We go Ransom but at a better look.

407
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,000
Toe nou, David.

408
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,400
I helped you.

409
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,270
You have created this company ...

410
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,020
... With money that I settled acquaintances.

411
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,020
10% commission is five million pounds. And we had a deal.

412
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,350
If you had cash, I got that money.

413
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,540
Where is this contract? I have not signed anything.

414
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,020
I find this really incredible.

415
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,780
They were my contacts. They trusted you because they trusted me.

416
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,480
You've been out there for years. Nobody cares about you.

417
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,910
Five million, and that you pay now.

418
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,030
Whether the costs are added.

419
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,640
You are too often went out with Charlie.

420
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,590
You can 't remember. I owe you nothing.

421
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,100
Even 's idea that one parallel world enters?

422
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,640
What can I do for the police?

423
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,630
Does the name Simon Wallis something?

424
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,150
Heel in de verte.

425
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,910
A computer consultant. Worked 't last six months especially for you.

426
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:41,040
He is dead. Yesterday found with one lethal dose of heroin in his blood.

427
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
What a tragedy.

428
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,470
Simon Wallis had all sorts of information about you on its hard drive.

429
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,640
I have more than 500 people.

430
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,950
Who knows, he worked on my computers. - 1 meter 80. Short hair.

431
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,040
Homo.

432
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,510
Are you married?

433
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:15,260
What the hell? You tell it's a freelancer death, he is gay ...

434
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,750
I am suspicious of anything?

435
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:24,120
If you know anything about Mr. Wallis, we would be very happy with that.

436
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,000
You are not suggesting that I was sleeping with him?

437
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,640
I know him disagree. - And Christina Chance?

438
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:43,640
If you have one hidden agenda? If you want to know something, ask simply.

439
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,540
Wallis had an affair with her husband, Judge Chance.

440
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,000
Wallis died twelve hours before Chance was killed.

441
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,540
You try to make connections.

442
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,780
Uw ex-compagnon Deller
is de minnaar van Christina Chance.

443
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,760
I barely know her. - Why do you support her?

444
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,770
She just has her office here.

445
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,980
Who pays rd phone and employees?

446
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:17,080
The party, I suppose. Which gets money from me. But political campaigns, no.

447
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,060
Strange that you 'r not know. A friend of yours is her lover.

448
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,820
Peter and I are not friends for five years.

449
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,790
If I have a reason needed to avoid her, he certainly is.

450
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,820
I notice that you have a theory. - Various.

451
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,300
Let me just guess. Businessman and politician together in pursuit of money.

452
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:47,670
Worker discovered 't, transmits lover in, coincidentally her husband. Two deaths.

453
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,790
I lead an honest business.

454
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,550
The Governing Board eminent names.

455
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,820
You can mess up 't entire company ...

456
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,390
... But you will not find anything.

457
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,600
Everything good? - What do you think?

458
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,300
Parker is looking for you. Something with a press conference this afternoon.

459
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,300
I am disgusted by John Parker. I loathe 't hassle. Was it to be over.

460
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,330
Hood then equally easy to get things back in line.

461
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,680
You will require too much of yourself.

462
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,670
Where I'm still doing?

463
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,510
I will stay here for a while?

464
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,540
What should I say to the press?

465
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,530
I'm just one good friend.

466
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,390
I do not know what to do.

467
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,520
What is that?

468
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,920
Something to Jerry 't was writing.

469
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,390
I know why he was killed.

470
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,270
Have you informed the police?

471
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,920
Read now but.

472
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,510
Mr Smith? Inspecteur Dalziel, recherche.

473
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,400
Come inside.

474
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,620
I pick up the books of the court.

475
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,060
I've seen him twelve years, since his appointment.

476
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,820
The last named judge in twenty years.

477
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:58,510
You have him well-known. - I have occasionally 's right to serve.

478
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,060
The Barbour process probably was not fun. Those threats.

479
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,790
That every judge. It is part of it today.

480
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,520
So he was worried enough.

481
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,400
It did nothing to him.

482
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,030
Did you know many of his private life?

483
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,920
That's not my business.

484
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,400
Ever heard of one young man, Simon Wallis?

485
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,280
According to us, he had a relationship with the judge.

486
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,030
These messages are spread by the tabloids.

487
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,280
And they were rumors, no more.

488
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,520
When was this?

489
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:53,270
Five years ago. When the judge was working at the court.

490
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,920
The national press so. - Rats. It was pure harassment.

491
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,920
Why do you say that?

492
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,510
I usually have little interest in conspiracy theories ...

493
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,520
... But in this case I do not know that.

494
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,790
I listen.

495
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,820
It was a case against a businessman. Trading.

496
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,280
According to me it was the top of one iceberg.

497
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,520
When he was sentenced, would follow hundred cases.

498
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,620
The judge was under tremendous pressure.

499
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,510
The case has not occurred. Because of a formality.

500
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,030
Does he have him run?

501
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,060
And I saw how nice it was not.

502
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,520
The judge was a very honest man.

503
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,520
What was that business?

504
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,030
Ransom. He did in computers.

505
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,540
To many people's surprise, David Ransom, one wealthy businessman ...

506
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:07,910
... Acquitted of three charges of insider trading.

507
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,540
The groom touch you, you bet on the horse. Is that right?

508
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:20,060
Then you have one unfair advantage. You play with loaded dice.

509
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,540
Can you gamble ethical? - Want one philosophical answer?

510
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,030
Ransom I want to know his role.

511
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,060
If he was behind the rumors, he plays' t nasty.

512
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,790
As. Everything in this case begins with 'if'.

513
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:41,300
If Chance Ransom suspiciously, he had it said, and his wife was not there now.

514
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:49,060
Shall we call the CID and ask if they want to follow a few people?

515
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,820
You want 't really like to give up, huh?

516
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,520
We could vertillen us this. - Do not be defeatist.

517
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,030
What did you do? You sit me all sewing at times.

518
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,540
I'm afraid for you? That you makes me?

519
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,060
I can not help it that you do not get recognition genius.

520
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,520
Is it?

521
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,060
I have heard no news.

522
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,520
There is a very good reason.

523
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,540
We have our theory 't formulation.

524
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,270
Main suspect? - The widow's got the best motive.

525
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,820
Reasons for arrest? - Is being worked on.

526
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,060
And the perpetrator of the attack?

527
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,040
We have expanded the investigation.

528
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,280
When CID they become restless.

529
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,280
That is mutual.

530
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,400
Beautiful.

531
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,920
What's he doing here?

532
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,520
I wish him speak.

533
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,380
There's a message in 't party office.

534
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,270
They want you withdraw your candidacy. Call them equally.

535
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,520
It is too late. - The list closes at 5 pm. About two hours.

536
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,790
Why? - They'll push you too much.

537
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,040
I pretty certainly not off. I'll do just fine, they said.

538
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,790
The press is behind your acquaintances.

539
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,270
When your application is asked whether there were potential problems.

540
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,520
You have not said anything about a relationship if one gay man.

541
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:07,270
It is the public interest. Since you do not answer for.

542
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,280
Nasty little creep.

543
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,060
I know what you want. Whoever takes my place?

544
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,920
Go home, Christina.

545
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:27,040
Those notes Jerry can you show it to anyone.

546
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,090
We need to talk about it. - Over three quarters at home.

547
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,160
Good. See u soon.

548
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,160
Please.

549
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,030
Deller is de spin in het web.

550
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,800
He knows everyone.

551
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,300
What Novello about him discovered?

552
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,300
Clippings about his old case and his generosity.

553
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,540
No spot on, apparently.

554
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:27,910
Can not, Peter. Everyone does have a spot. And sometimes more than one.

555
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,560
Ellie asked you one ultimatum, eh?

556
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,820
Since you do not have to sleuth.

557
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,540
Women walking to their mother when they want attention.

558
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,400
They want you to be home more often. Or from me.

559
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,520
She gets a job in London. She wants me to go.

560
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,590
It's a great opportunity for "r. - So.

561
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,590
And if you do not want to go to London? - Then they're going.

562
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,320
What did they do? You deserve good, nice house ...

563
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,860
You'll find out in a box. - I'm never home.

564
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,320
But you're not strange. - She just wants a job.

565
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,440
She has.

566
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,590
She adapts to me. But she thinks I'm in the house.

567
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:33,910
Your generation thinks too much. In my time was it simple.

568
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,340
Woman frustrated, man not at home. - We picked it.

569
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,720
Your wife.

570
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,320
Christina Chance. Can I talk to you?

571
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,720
Yes of course. - Under four eyes like.

572
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,200
De Yew Tree in Chellingwake?
- Goed. Tot over twintig minuten.

573
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,440
Someone saw a flash, and when he heard the bang.

574
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,620
What flash? - A flash, but brighter.

575
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,440
Where is she, at an end?

576
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,720
You should not have gone. I think it's so bad.

577
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,720
How are you with her? - Still in a coma. Blood in the brains.

578
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,320
Was it an accident? - Why would it not be?

579
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,320
I do not know. You're the policeman.

580
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,830
Where were you tonight, Mr. Deller?

581
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,590
You do not think I did it?

582
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,320
We will talk further on the precinct?

583
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,320
You can not arrest me. I did not do anything.

584
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:20,200
I can pick up for driving with one gulp. I can smell it here.

585
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:42,190
You have been before tonight Mrs. Chance.

586
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,200
You are both left around the same time, a little after eight.

587
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,600
Did she say where she was going?

588
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,320
To a meeting.

589
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,320
To say that she would keep a low profile.

590
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,830
She did not say she went to inspector Dalziel?

591
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,360
No, I do have remembered me.

592
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,100
Where did you go? - Home.

593
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,720
I called a dozen people. Trek but after.

594
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,190
She had something on him?

595
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,860
The agent at the house saw her walking with a leather briefcase.

596
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,840
We have not found.

597
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,840
I know nothing of.

598
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,190
Who would want to murder her?

599
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,440
No idea.

600
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:53,600
You and David Ransom known each other one all the time, huh?

601
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,320
Yes. Not that that's saying something.

602
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,830
I thought you were friends.

603
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,190
I used to. - What went wrong?

604
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,190
We are each "n other side passed on.

605
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,720
I have seen both in one bar in Leeds.

606
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,340
The relationship seemed "a little tense.

607
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,440
Why?

608
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,320
We had a disagreement about money.

609
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,320
How much money?

610
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,080
Surely that is our case?

611
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,320
Are you sure it was not Christina?

612
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:41,290
They will contrive to be grateful. - He stands apart from Christina.

613
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,830
They are all very thick with each other.

614
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:53,320
That's always at the top. - Are you sitting there?

615
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,200
No, anything but.

616
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,720
Does the name Simon Wallis something?

617
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,280
Do you'm not like a lover of justice Chance?

618
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,040
Jerry never said anything about that side of his life.

619
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,430
Ransom has acted with knowledge?

620
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,590
The successful businessman has not?

621
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,080
You're a rich man, Mr. Deller.

622
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,590
A player, a man with influence.

623
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,100
Business and politics are two peas in a pod.

624
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:43,070
You know that. That's your world.

625
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,590
But strangely enough powerful people want too much.

626
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,840
They do almost anything to keep what they have.

627
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,080
They try to get away even with murder.

628
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:00,590
The question is: What is it here?

629
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,840
And for whom?

630
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,840
What did Chance and Wallis?

631
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,720
What did Mrs. Chance tell me?

632
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,720
There is a secret, huh?

633
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,200
And you would not have told me.

634
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,440
He knows something.

635
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,440
Let him follow.

636
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,830
Nice car. Cost forty grand.

637
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,190
I can buy my apartment so for.

638
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,620
Sometimes you wanted to blackmail me? - The police asked for you.

639
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,340
You found that probably nice. - They know 't, David.

640
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,440
Of the briefcase.

641
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,340
What briefcase?

642
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,860
They do not know where your money comes from.

643
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,320
So I want ten million.

644
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,590
Hoop still on, Peter.

645
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,710
Je bent 'n stakker.

646
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,710
Mrs. Chance stepped down after the death of her husband.

647
01:05:54,840 --> 01:06:02,190
The election committee of the party has appointed John Parker as a replacement.

648
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,740
What is your position on the euro?

649
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,980
I continue to propagate the views of Mrs. Chance to voters.

650
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,200
The choice is between isolation and decay ...

651
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:19,080
... And join a strong European economy.

652
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:32,100
Congratulations. The party leaves no grass grow.

653
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:37,070
I'm not elected. - That'll be fine. What a device.

654
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,080
Can I do anything for you?

655
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,030
Do you know anything of the attack on your predecessor?

656
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,350
It was an accident?

657
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:53,100
It was a professional attempt to make it look like it.

658
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,350
No idea. - If it was just her ...

659
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,080
... I would suspect.

660
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,380
But her husband and his lover are there too.

661
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,470
You are aware of Mr. Wallis?

662
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,080
U hebt vast 'n theorie.

663
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,830
You still have over one answer?

664
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,380
I thought 't was connected with his work.

665
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:23,350
All roads lead to this place.

666
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,600
This marble quarry hides one vicious secret.

667
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:33,860
And if you're not aware of, you hear it fixed shortly.

668
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,080
You are intelligent, ambitious ...

669
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,480
Well suited for this snake pit.

670
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:48,360
My political activities occur entirely within our rules of conduct.

671
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,620
What are you doing here? Why pay Ransom everything for you?

672
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,350
He does not. We're here six months.

673
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,600
The lease is paid by the party.

674
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:05,350
Of who gets the party money? - No idea.

675
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:12,350
I get to see any names of lenders. That may confirm people.

676
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,840
And here I thought you were smart.

677
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,600
Be aware, boy ...

678
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,100
... Associated with each banknote 's promise.

679
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,830
I have no bound.

680
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:29,480
Only to my constituents and the party.

681
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,600
They've bought your suit, son ..

682
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,950
Sell ​​your soul not there.

683
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:49,080
Where is he now? - Two hours was in the hospital.

684
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,620
And then went home. - And he had an argument with Ransom?

685
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:58,080
Deller was walking with a fierce face away.

686
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,590
Last Sunday Deller Ransom wanted to speak in Leeds.

687
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:07,620
This morning he had important news, because Ransom runs here.

688
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:11,600
But whatever it is, Deller is not satisfied.

689
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,600
Maybe he wants something and he does not get it.

690
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,720
Look at.

691
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:27,080
Its shares shoot up, but nobody knows why. Or they say nothing.

692
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,960
Who wrote this? - A woman. Cameron Stewart.

693
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,190
Where are you going? - To a lady.

694
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:48,100
Why such interest? - Two murders and one attempted murder.

695
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:53,320
Usually wants detectives know where it comes from capital.

696
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,830
Or 't is black or not. - What?

697
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:01,830
It's certainly gray here and there. That's usually the case.

698
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,830
Why the shares rise so fast? - So that's it feel.

699
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,840
It is truly confidential.

700
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:13,590
I am a journalist. I hear rumors.

701
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:17,600
But often 't just rumors.

702
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,860
An American company buys many shares on Ransom.

703
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,340
An acquisition?

704
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,620
That depends on the shareholders. Ransom so.

705
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,340
The Americans will have to provide one good price.

706
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:36,600
And how much money are you, Ransom personally?

707
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,630
If he gets 5 pounds per share, which ...

708
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,190
... More than 100 million.

709
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,190
Does the name Peter Deller you something?

710
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:56,310
That's a long time ago. Almost before my time.

711
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:00,590
I only know that he is completely burned.

712
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,860
He invested his money in the Far East.

713
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,860
And he has lost everything. - So bad it 's not? He is not working.

714
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:16,100
Nobody wants him to have. They know that he has won a lot of money.

715
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:21,320
But then he's screwed up. - What was he doing hanging out with Ransom?

716
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,200
If you had one red stripe, where did you go?

717
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,590
How do I withdraw after shares?

718
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:40,860
There is an office that registers owners of shares.

719
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:46,200
Find out who has Ransom shares. - That must be through the courts.

720
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:54,620
With Peter. Deller is broke. He is going to ask for money to Ransom.

721
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,860
And did you know that Ransom going to sell his business for hundreds of line?

722
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,600
Streep? What is that? - Million.

723
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:06,600
A unique deal. - Where's what it's all about?

724
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:11,620
Black money maybe. Wallis was working on one database shareholders.

725
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:15,620
He saw something, gave it on to Chance and briefed Deller.

726
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,950
Of course. We meet at his house Deller.

727
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:06,190
Mr Deller? Inspecteur Dalziel.

728
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,430
Bankruptcy Request

729
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,720
I thought he was it. The weapon closet is empty. He is gone.

730
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,340
No of course not. I'll call you back shortly.

731
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:21,310
Ransom his lawyer asks why we want to have that data.

732
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,620
See who benefits from this acquisition.

733
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:28,860
That's called fishing, Andy. Did you have a good reason for it?

734
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,860
Yes, I'm one whopper hooked.

735
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:37,230
But there is someone with a gun around. I want firearms.

736
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,590
I'm on your side, Andy ...

737
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:45,100
... But they want me to wear on the case.

738
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,860
You would like that, huh? Just one signature ...

739
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,840
It is more complicated than you think. - So what?

740
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,340
If one is dead, you get that book under the L Corpse?

741
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:00,440
You're very emotional. - I'm just doing my job.

742
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,620
Good then. I authorize the use of firearms ...

743
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:12,320
... But if I were you, I took the rest of the day free.

744
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:16,340
And if I were you, I was counting paperclips again ...

745
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,100
... Because you do not crack police work.

746
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,320
What do you have? - Nothing about Deller.

747
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,340
But when Ransom started ...

748
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,340
... Was one of its shareholders Northern Haul.

749
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,590
Owner: One Stanley Barbour.

750
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,840
The brother of Kenneth. Same business address.

751
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,080
Northern Haul stak zes miljoen
in Ransom Telecom.

752
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,320
Drug Money.

753
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,080
Deller aground ...

754
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,340
... And so he threatens' t hang with the big clock.

755
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:58,320
And then get his girlfriend an accident.

756
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,720
He is behind Ransom.

757
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:09,340
Pascoe en Dalziel, recherche.
We komen voor Mr Ransom.

758
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,590
What was that? Where is the door?

759
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,080
There was someone inside. - No idea.

760
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,720
I know better. Get you Ransom?

761
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:52,860
488 is fine, but I want two years of my research people.

762
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,590
Nee. Dat hele project kan morgen stranden.

763
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:02,930
I've one year promised. And otherwise, you get lost in the competition.

764
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:13,310
Security called: the police is coming.

765
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:18,290
Then we do it the way you want. We'll finish 't even?

766
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:36,590
We now draw by fax and in the US we arrange the final details though.

767
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,840
I appreciate your confidence.

768
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,620
Even my lawyers are happy. - You sign anything.

769
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,780
Disconnect. - Hands off.

770
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,880
Alles in orde?

771
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,280
This man blackmailed one right ...

772
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:56,260
... And let him and his friend murder, for this rotten deal.

773
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:59,750
David Ransom z'n grote deal.

774
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,240
You should not do business with him. It's a criminal.

775
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:08,120
And he's his business started with drug money.

776
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:16,020
You should not do. - You all about money? We can talk.

777
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,780
Sit.

778
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:21,110
Police. Drop the gun.

779
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,750
That gun away, then you nothing happens.

780
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,520
Nevertheless, gun.

781
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,640
Leg weg.

782
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,360
We know what he did.

783
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:45,510
He is to be stored for a long time. Do not worry.

784
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:50,540
But that does not happen because he buys you. He buys all.

785
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,240
David Ransom...

786
01:18:54,360 --> 01:19:00,120
I arrest you on suspicion of 't laundering drug money.

787
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,120
Put that gun away now.

788
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,000
Then we go to the office ...

789
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:18,120
... And tell us what you know about the murder of Chance and Valais.

790
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,360
Well?

791
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,640
Up, Ransom.

792
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,640
Did you just saved my life, Peter?

793
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,110
Wie is daar?

794
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:37,780
What do you want? It's almost midnight. - I shot someone.

795
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,350
Professionally.

796
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,350
Have you been drinking?

797
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:51,780
I saved Andy. That would be gunned down. I shot the first time.

798
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:55,760
Three bullets through the heart. Could not be better.

799
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:59,640
Who was it? - An expired businessman.

800
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,230
What happens now? - There will be an investigation.

801
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,720
Praise for my courage and about one year a medal.

802
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:13,600
Then you are the wife of one man decorated. If you want.

803
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,230
I want? - That is the question, yes.

804
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,480
What kind of man do you want anyway?

805
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:28,470
I shot without thinking. Before that I trained.

806
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,260
Nothing academic or househusband. I'm a cop.

807
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,830
That's me. - You got a shock.

808
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:38,240
I feel fine. - Then you need help.

809
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,980
I'm for change 's honest.

810
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,980
I try not to protect you from what I really am.

811
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:48,740
Why we can not be honest with each other?

812
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,960
I want you, Ellie.

813
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,360
Do not walk away.

814
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,960
I do not want you.

815
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,360
Not so.

816
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,720
This man blackmailed one right ...

817
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,220
... And let him and his friend murder, for this rotten deal.

818
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:38,320
David Ransom z'n grote deal.

819
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:48,220
Mr. Deller had 't sure about' t lawsuit against you for insider trading.

820
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,200
I can answer questions.

821
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:54,550
I have no idea. He did so confused.

822
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:58,200
Do you judge Chance blackmailed ...

823
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,470
... Because of his homosexuality? - Absolutely not.

824
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,260
Simon Wallis may have known about the deal.

825
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:12,960
Yes, if there were leaks in 't business. But I've never met him talk.

826
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:17,200
I 's to Wallis its bills looked to you.

827
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,220
Other customers paid 50 pounds per hour.

828
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,710
Your company paid him 200. Why?

829
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,470
We are simply too generous.

830
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,740
He has earned a half years £ 100,000.

831
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,720
A boy of 25.

832
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,720
What did you pay him for?

833
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:43,950
To his knowledge. - No information about Chance?

834
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,960
That was a ticking time bomb.

835
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:51,710
Especially when you Wallis heard he was ill.

836
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,740
Other people you could buy all ...

837
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:00,470
... But a dying judge was not available, was dangerous.

838
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,480
He may well decide ...

839
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:09,740
... To tell you how you sabotaged the course of justice.

840
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,960
There I would best 's evidence to see.

841
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:18,950
The stakes were just too high.

842
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:24,500
You must eliminate the risks. Everyone silence only impose knew.

843
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,960
Even Mrs. Chance.

844
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:34,190
If you have one gram evidence for this madness, Mr. Dalziel?

845
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,200
You listened determine their telephone calls.

846
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,710
They used lines in your building.

847
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:47,200
I have been arrested on suspicion of money laundering?

848
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,740
Mr. Barbour his money was the last piece of the puzzle.

849
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,480
No idea what you mean.

850
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:59,200
Maybe you say something more like Mr. Barbour is heard.

851
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,960
Meanwhile ...

852
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,710
... We offer you tonight like shelter.

853
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,980
What do you mean you do not know where Barbour? He sat with you in jail.

854
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,200
When?

855
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,600
Since I know nothing about.

856
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:20,600
How can such a prisoner now disappear?

857
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,960
He is not fixed.

858
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,740
He sits on somewhere safe, with Narcotics.

859
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:33,710
Drugs? CID has arranged something?

860
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,220
He's going to testify against major traffickers.

861
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:40,980
I want to believe. Better than twenty years in prison.

862
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:46,740
What did he say about Ransom? - He will not talk to us.

863
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:52,470
Has anyone'm asked anything? - There is no evidence against Ransom.

864
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,590
We let him freely.

865
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:00,600
Let you run my prisoner?

866
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:07,720
Who's in charge here? - Not you and not me.

867
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,220
Sorry. Sometimes you just can not control.

868
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:14,500
Forgets, but now. Nobody blames you something.

869
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,480
Forgotten? My suspect for two murders ...

870
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:24,220
... Attempted murder and six million money laundering is released ...

871
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,960
... And I have to forget?

872
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,710
What is this? A one-two or something?

873
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,200
It happens fixed in general interest.

874
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:38,320
Rot still on. I know why Ransom goes free.

875
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,470
He knows so many bigwigs ...

876
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:46,720
... They thought: Who should we wangle.

877
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:50,240
I forget in my life days.

878
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,080
I should go. '

879
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,070
Let Mr. Dalziel to cool.

880
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:05,600
I quit, Rebecca. I'm sick of it.

881
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:13,080
Cup of tea? - Lazer still on, wieldy.

882
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,680
Only after Jerry's death, I noticed 't blackmail.

883
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,720
I looked through his papers.

884
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,200
He had written down everything.

885
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:29,080
Thus I came to you then ...

886
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:36,940
I thought 't was important. - He wanted to tackle Ransom.

887
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,600
But only after the elections.

888
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,600
He knew he would be fired, but of course ...

889
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,070
He was already dying.

890
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,600
I did my best, Mrs. Chance.

891
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:06,720
Had I 'tu but immediately told.

892
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,600
It was my fault.

893
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,600
I wanted to win.

894
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:19,160
I thought I 's past could disappear.

895
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,600
Sorry.

896
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,600
Trek 'tu not.

897
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,320
Please.

898
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:39,080
0,35 liter Euro-boerwater.

899
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:45,600
I you have a couple of guilty. - One round is already a miracle.

900
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:53,220
Ransom his deal is off. Its shares have no value whatsoever.

901
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:58,190
A couple of Germans want him for a bargain to take over.

902
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:02,200
He still holds twenty million.

903
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:08,320
Probably not, as one journalist'm tackles blackmail and money laundering.

904
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,470
She called me.

905
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,220
Someone had 'r sent a tape of that state.

906
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,740
Plus how it sat with its six million Barbour.

907
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,310
You certainly do not know how she does it.

908
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,590
From one old cop which nokt it?

909
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,720
Have you been living?

910
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:43,080
I have come to count when I rent from my pension to live.

911
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,600
You're not really going away?

912
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,980
You have to use your head.

913
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,720
You're not a kid anymore.

914
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:59,200
You're almost divorced.

915
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,200
Do not be stupid.

916
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,200
You wanted to show a bowls club? - Too risky.

917
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:09,470
All those horny widows.

918
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:13,740
I can still use my bammetjes at Headingley.

919
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,070
There's nobody else.

920
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,960
You can not do that.

921
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,080
Not now.

922
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:36,210
After all we've been through?

923
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:44,130
I beat you more than you think.

924
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,200
Stop your whining ...

925
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,840
... And get more beer.

926
01:31:52,840 --> 01:32:02,840
