1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,211
<i>I was born in Palermo, Sicily.</i>

2
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,926
<i>We came to this country when I was seven.
We immigrated to Chicago.</i>

3
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:46,648
<i>We were always raised to be very patriotic,
to love our country.</i>

4
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:48,156
<i>And we did.</i>

5
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:52,084
<i>When I was a little boy,
my father took me to a baseball game.</i>

6
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:55,971
<i>They had a martial arts demonstration
and I saw this old Japanese man...</i>

7
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:59,194
<i>... doing things that I thought
were magical...</i>

8
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:02,325
<i>... and I developed a crazy dream
to go to the Far East.</i>

9
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:06,264
<i>By the time I was 17, I was there,
studying with the masters.</i>

10
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:02,131
<i>In 1969 I was invited by a friend of mine
to an American Embassy party in Tokyo.</i>

11
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:07,481
<i>While I was there, there was a crazy,
drunk guy named Nelson Fox.</i>

12
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:09,783
<i>He recruited me into the CIA.</i>

13
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,168
<i>I was 22 at the time.</i>

14
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:14,879
<i>My eyes were about to be opened.</i>

15
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,187
<i>My friends, let me make one thing clear:</i>

16
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,326
<i>This is a nation of laws.</i>

17
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:59,578
<i>And as Abraham Lincoln had said:</i>

18
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,966
<i>"No one is above the law,
no one is below the law. "</i>

19
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,891
<i>And we're going to enforce the law!</i>

20
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:09,323
<i>And Americans should remember that,
if we are to have law and order!</i>

21
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:24,933
You ever seen
chemical interrogation before?

22
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:27,190
These assholes are Agency?

23
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:29,440
We all get paid by the CIA.

24
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:33,543
But these guys are from a page
that ain't even in the book.

25
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:00,309
Don't die on me, you sucker!

26
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,308
What the hell's wrong?

27
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:05,989
This pussy, he just can't hold his liquor.

28
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,758
Doc, he's dead.

29
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:13,094
Get him the fuck out of here.

30
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:16,105
- Move it. Let's go.
- Come on!

31
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,366
- Get him out.
- Get him out of here.

32
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:34,261
So, my little doctor bag doesn't scare you?

33
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,519
I'm not scared.

34
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,230
You speak English.

35
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,115
How nice.

36
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:44,085
Where's the load, Colonel?

37
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:55,920
I'm gonna teach you never...

38
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,301
...never to fuck with my opium.

39
00:06:58,683 --> 00:06:59,966
Oh, boy.

40
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,568
He's a hard one, Doc.

41
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:06,658
You took it from the French,
you took it from the Chinks.

42
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:10,677
And you'll be damned
if a Yankee's going to start you talking.

43
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,568
But you're gonna sing for me.
You're gonna sing like a choir!

44
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:18,247
What does this have to do
with military intelligence?

45
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:24,268
Who the fuck is this cherry?

46
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:27,942
Your orders, Toscani,
were to assist and observe.

47
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:30,660
Just back off, partner.

48
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:40,279
I'm gonna start cutting you off
at the ankles.

49
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:47,012
Then I'm gonna take your feet
and throw them right in the basket.

50
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:48,518
Cute, huh?

51
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:50,740
Shut up, Nico.

52
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:53,621
Look, I can make you disappear.

53
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,058
Grab his leg.

54
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:03,486
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- Nico!

55
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:11,142
You think you're soldiers?
You're fucking barbarians!

56
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:14,982
Get out!

57
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:22,470
Get back to the LZ.

58
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:25,736
If I don't cap him now,
he's gonna do me later.

59
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:28,238
I'll call a chopper in for us. I'll cover this.

60
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:30,495
Just get the hell out of here!

61
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,422
Come on, move!

62
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,341
Bring him back here!

63
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:38,907
Nobody move! Everybody stay
on that damn porch!

64
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,751
Go, Nico!

65
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,515
Nelson, I'm through. I'm finished!

66
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:03,453
Nicola, Sara,
what name do you give your child?

67
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,168
Giuliano Nicola.

68
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:08,795
Giuliano...

69
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,556
...you have become a new creation.

70
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,410
With the help of your family and friends...

71
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,456
...we bring your Christian dignity
unstained...

72
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:20,341
...into the everlasting life of heaven.

73
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:24,648
- Come on. You always make me late.
- I'm the boss. You have to drive me!

74
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:28,041
I'll trace the sign of the Cross
upon your forehead...

75
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:31,218
...and I invite your parents to do the same.

76
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,901
In the name of the Father, the Son...

77
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:39,447
...and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

78
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:43,424
Look at him. He's such a good baby.

79
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,994
That's beautiful.

80
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:09,601
- I know you're the boss but...
- That's right. Remember that.

81
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,774
Hi, guys.

82
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,410
Hey, how are you?

83
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,618
You guys look so good!

84
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:18,052
We haven't done anything.
We're clean. Some of us, anyway.

85
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,814
Well, Lieutenant, eight more days
and you're gonna miss me.

86
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,151
Parts of you, anyway.

87
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:24,619
You see this cop?

88
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:28,165
This one. This one here.
She could bust me anytime.

89
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:30,173
Look at that! Look at that!

90
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:32,394
- This is the partner?
- This is the partner.

91
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:35,193
I got dressed up because
you told me you were wearing a tux.

92
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:38,126
You look fabulous.
She goes to work looking like this?

93
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:41,135
This girl, sometimes she comes
in just lingerie.

94
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:45,811
Don't tell our secrets. She's never gonna
let you out with me again.

95
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:52,248
I told you guys to have a good time,
but take it easy, will you?

96
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:54,555
Toscani holds the record
for having more relatives...

97
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:57,854
...under federal indictment
than any other cop in the city.

98
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:00,075
Look at those stiff dicks.

99
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:03,381
A free meal and they come out like flies.

100
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,760
Hey, you greaseball bastards!

101
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:08,306
Didn't we buy that monkey once?

102
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:14,666
Rosa, I'm so worried. So worried.

103
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,570
- What's wrong?
- Nico!

104
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,869
Isn't today a day you should be happy?

105
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:30,093
- What's wrong?
- It's Lucia. She's gone again.

106
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:33,150
<i>- Is it that boy?
- S? Nico.</i>

107
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,587
I have to go to work right now.
You gonna be at the bakery later?

108
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:41,216
<i>S?</i>

109
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:45,267
I'll come by the bakery and we'll talk.
Maybe I can do something.

110
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:47,575
Thank you, Nico. Thank you.

111
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:53,721
<i>Lester, this is Unit 10, Tango-X-ray.</i>

112
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,649
We're up and clear. You got that?

113
00:11:56,738 --> 00:12:00,912
<i>Delores, Toscani told me he'll watch
over you and take care of you real good...</i>

114
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,465
<i>... your last week on the street.</i>

115
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,344
<i>Never had a friend who was a DA before.</i>

116
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:12,542
I'm gonna take a piss and be right back.

117
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:14,089
- Here?
- Yeah.

118
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:25,209
She's fine, ain't she?

119
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,601
Excuse me, I just had to stop and tell you...

120
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:34,449
...you look like the sun setting
on a waterfall in the springtime.

121
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:37,545
And you got five seconds, and three are up.

122
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,881
You ain't got to be...

123
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:44,529
Lady cops need boyfriends, too, you dig?

124
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:47,409
But you have a nice day, just the same.

125
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:54,856
Nothing but trouble coming
in my place tonight.

126
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:56,607
I know this one.

127
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:02,502
You seen this girl?

128
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:04,390
I ain't seen shit.

129
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:06,974
You haven't seen this girl?

130
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,612
Hey, Schifo, how you doing?

131
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:15,471
- You seen this girl?
- You know I quit messing with that stuff.

132
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:18,518
- I ain't into this shit anymore.
- What are you into?

133
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,857
Why don't the fuck
you assholes leave me alone?

134
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,329
- I paid your boy off Monday night.
- My boys, huh?

135
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:27,758
Now take some of that fucking money
and buy your mama a condominium.

136
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:31,895
I thought this was a kosher bar, man.
No pork allowed.

137
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,718
Say, man, you seen this girl?

138
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:44,614
I seen the top of her head.

139
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:49,748
That's good.

140
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:07,381
Stop this motherfucker.
He's crazy. Where's my piece?

141
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:12,476
He ain't nothing. Take him out.
He's motherfucking crazy.

142
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,817
He's a fucking Italian puke!

143
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:18,463
Freeze, motherfucker!

144
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:23,565
Come on, man. Please. Put the gun away.

145
00:14:35,986 --> 00:14:38,114
All right. Who else wants some?

146
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:40,117
You're destroying the image of my place.

147
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,337
You'll never be the fucking man.
You'll never be the man.

148
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:44,975
Get over here!

149
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:47,640
Hold it, man. Don't do me ugly.

150
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:51,662
Listen. I know where the chick is.
She's upstairs.

151
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:55,170
- Yeah? She's upstairs?
- 2-C. I swear, man. It's 2-C.

152
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,205
This isn't what it looks like.

153
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:07,093
Listen, he's my cousin. He's a cop.

154
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,224
I didn't know they had all of this.

155
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:10,809
Get out of here.

156
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:14,363
You having a good time?

157
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,952
Pretty good time.

158
00:15:19,013 --> 00:15:21,807
What is this shit? You wanna get high?

159
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,148
You wanna get high?

160
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,868
You're acting stupid, man! Stop it!

161
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:36,386
Stop. You playing the cop, I'm tired of it.

162
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,733
I'll show you what time is
'cause you'll do tall time.

163
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:43,663
Just take it, it's yours.
Three grand. It's in the mattress.

164
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:46,166
You want to fucking bribe me, man?

165
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:48,845
Put your clothes on. We're going home.

166
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,221
Stop it.

167
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:53,156
I'm tired of you. You shut up!

168
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:56,921
Don't you understand that there are people
out there who love you.

169
00:15:57,008 --> 00:15:59,719
Right. Keep talking. Keep flapping.

170
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,311
In my business!

171
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,449
Is this your school stuff?

172
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:10,680
It's my math homework and my history.
You gonna write me another note, Nico?

173
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:12,429
Come on. We're going home.

174
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,768
No, you go home. I'm tired.

175
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,536
I'll give you something, something big.

176
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:19,458
Oh, yeah?

177
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:23,505
This is huge, my man.
It's a shipment coming in next Tuesday.

178
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:26,521
What the hell do you know
about a shipment?

179
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:29,073
This is square, on my mother's soul.

180
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:32,337
You gotta believe me, man.
You can't set me up.

181
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:36,939
I heard it from a hooker friend who's
banging this big coke lawyer. He told her.

182
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:38,570
- What lawyer?
- I don't know.

183
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,152
What do you mean you don't know?

184
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:42,657
Carlos Abandano. That's the one.

185
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:46,640
Better fucking pray to God
you ain't bullshitting me...

186
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,899
...or I'll come back and tear your heart out.
Let's go.

187
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:55,537
Who are you?

188
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:56,630
Get back!

189
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,300
I own this place!

190
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,101
I own this joint.

191
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:04,617
There's a guy upstairs.
I want to get him arrested!

192
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:10,345
- That's the motherfucker right there!
- These two guys are under arrest.

193
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:12,931
It's a cesspool in there. Check it out.

194
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,363
Boy, you got some strange toilet habits.

195
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,669
I'm gonna take her home and clean her up.

196
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:22,885
I don't want to take her
to her grandmother like this.

197
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,919
Jax, I hate these cocaine lawyers.

198
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:00,100
And this shitty weather.

199
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:05,283
They're gonna have me serving time.

200
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,138
I wish you'd relax, hon.
This'll never get into court.

201
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:10,936
Except against us.

202
00:18:12,988 --> 00:18:14,902
I don't care how
I have to get at these guys...

203
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:15,910
Let me reiterate.

204
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:20,338
You said you were going to protect
my butt and be my guardian angel.

205
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:21,934
Hang on, hang on.

206
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:25,947
There is an engine block
clearing customs...

207
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,700
...Tuesday, 10:00 pickup.

208
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,507
Fulton Meat Market.

209
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,061
An engine block?

210
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:44,173
Clever, clever, guys.

211
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,595
I'd like an '86 Lincoln...

212
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,563
...Illinois 354-DOG-67, please.

213
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,173
<i>Ramone Chi Chi Testamente,
a Salvadoran national with quite a record.</i>

214
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,763
Remember, you were harping on me
about having a date.

215
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,355
Dream on, baby.

216
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:16,871
I want to tell you, what I turned down
tonight, you could never come close to.

217
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:20,722
You should become a science-fiction
writer, instead of a cop or a DA...

218
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,557
...with that imagination you got.

219
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,147
You're right.

220
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:33,184
How you doing, Mr. Abandano?

221
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:36,858
Chi Chi, how you doing?

222
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:47,319
- I do not like this place.
- You do not like this place?

223
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:51,411
No, I don't want to go into this place.
You know I hate places like this.

224
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:54,130
- What don't you like about it?
- The element!

225
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:57,346
You know something, darling?

226
00:19:57,523 --> 00:20:01,031
I really think that you should lighten up,
because...

227
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:03,996
...we're gonna party.

228
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:12,315
This is my lawyer. Say hello.

229
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:19,888
- Two for dinner?
- Just drinks.

230
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:33,272
Good work.

231
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:35,733
I don't believe it.

232
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:40,707
Sit down here. You're gonna love
this place. I promise.

233
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:46,482
Salvano, the fucking cockroach.

234
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,624
I don't believe this. You always do this
to me in front of people.

235
00:20:58,488 --> 00:21:00,069
That is beautiful.

236
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:03,619
Excuse me.

237
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:04,838
I love it.

238
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:07,853
You'll have your engine block
on Tuesday, Boss.

239
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:12,698
If this happened a week from Tuesday,
I could read about it in the paper.

240
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:15,120
Relax. It'll make you famous.

241
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:17,963
Just what I need, to be famous.

242
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:32,521
Can you believe this?

243
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:38,164
<i>Lieutenant Strozah, meet those two cops
in the back alley.</i>

244
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:46,987
We got it down pretty good.

245
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:49,573
We got guys in the front,
we got a couple of cars out back.

246
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:51,166
Sealed off pretty good.

247
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:53,255
Three of our best guys.
I handpicked each one.

248
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:55,761
Jackson, Lukich, Nico. They're all topshelf.

249
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,188
They know how to do this.
They've done it before.

250
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:00,613
I can tell how much you love it here.

251
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:03,790
God! Now I know why I'm a vegetarian.

252
00:22:04,304 --> 00:22:06,218
You eat meat. I know you eat meat.

253
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:09,022
- I'm gonna throw up.
- I've heard you eat meat.

254
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:14,705
Nico, keep the channel clear.
Don't embarrass us.

255
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:18,351
Right over there.
Two guys in the alley over there.

256
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,435
Definitely the Feds.

257
00:22:22,116 --> 00:22:25,825
<i>Frank, it's fucking infested down here.
What are you trying to do to us?</i>

258
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:27,966
Someone from downtown got wind of it.
Don't worry.

259
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:31,146
They're trying to make points.
Just handle the pinch.

260
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:33,819
This ain't a bust, it's a fucking convention.

261
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:35,572
I don't believe this.

262
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:40,419
Look at this, boys. Here we go.

263
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:47,990
Here we go. Jackson, stay back.

264
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:56,476
I think they made you.
You're too pretty to be a meatpacker.

265
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:58,734
It's going down, boys. Let's go.

266
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,417
Keep your heads up.

267
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:04,424
Woman, let's do it.

268
00:23:09,994 --> 00:23:12,325
The cars are going around the corner.

269
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:23,068
Come on, Nico. Lukich, get up there.

270
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:37,213
What do you think?

271
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:38,792
Looks good.

272
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:42,223
Let's get on with it.

273
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:58,365
- What the fuck are you assholes doing?
- Feds!

274
00:23:58,456 --> 00:24:00,703
Shit! They jumped too soon!

275
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,260
What the fuck is this?

276
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:06,734
Freeze! Police!

277
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:20,276
Get back!

278
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:46,952
Nico, the Lincoln!

279
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:57,408
Nico!

280
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,741
Chi Chi!

281
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:15,682
Nico!

282
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:17,891
Nico!

283
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:21,999
Fucking animal!

284
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:24,585
Get rid of him!

285
00:25:26,768 --> 00:25:28,432
I'm out! Do him!

286
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:38,509
He's still on the roof! Get rid of him!

287
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,822
Where do I go? What do I do?

288
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:46,996
Hit those hooks over there!

289
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:22,790
What do I do?

290
00:26:23,593 --> 00:26:25,471
Stop the fucking car!

291
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,402
Stop the fucking car!

292
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:45,959
Hands up! Out of the car!

293
00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:54,781
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You scared me to death!

294
00:26:55,037 --> 00:26:56,618
Nico, you okay?

295
00:26:58,173 --> 00:27:00,301
- Wait till you hear about...
- Shut the fuck up!

296
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,471
You make a nice hood ornament, Sarge.

297
00:27:02,564 --> 00:27:04,977
- Come on!
- Gotta get this garbage out of here.

298
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:08,581
You gonna lose your license
driving around like that.

299
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,263
Let's go.

300
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,503
What do we got here?

301
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:26,639
What kind of high is this?

302
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:29,945
Sky-high.

303
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,584
Military explosives.

304
00:27:36,684 --> 00:27:38,146
C-4, my man.

305
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:48,128
Hey, Boss...

306
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:51,483
...you can see your place
from the office of the FBI.

307
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,234
Ain't that something?

308
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:56,334
<i>- Your name again?
- Agent Neeley, Chicago office.</i>

309
00:27:59,264 --> 00:28:02,106
<i>The arresting officer, Toscani.
What does he do?</i>

310
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:05,615
<i>- He's a tac sergeant, CPD Vice.
- Hold on a minute...</i>

311
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:07,332
I'll tell you what this cop is.

312
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:10,545
He's a fucking menace.
He almost strangled me!

313
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:13,730
Your problem is being
taken care of right now.

314
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:17,774
It should've been handled 12 hours ago
when my throat was in one piece!

315
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:20,547
I don't know who's running
this outfit here...

316
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:24,971
...but I'll tell you one thing:
Somebody better get his wires straight.

317
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,607
You don't know who you're dealing with.

318
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:32,161
This maniac should be wearing a number,
not a badge!

319
00:28:32,883 --> 00:28:35,891
<i>- The director does not want a problem.
- There won't be one.</i>

320
00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:37,939
<i>And I don't want any problems.</i>

321
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:38,858
I understand.

322
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:42,239
<i>Just listen.
They are to be released immediately.</i>

323
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,044
You can count on it.

324
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:45,677
<i>Avoid all contacts.</i>

325
00:28:45,761 --> 00:28:48,722
You'll have the Bureau's full cooperation.

326
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:56,798
You're free to go.

327
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:00,767
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

328
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:19,788
Good work. I loved the face of that
FBI guy when the call came through.

329
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,419
Salvano.

330
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,912
I don't want any more problems.

331
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:32,630
I don't enjoy babysitting.

332
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:38,946
Everything is going to be all right
from now on.

333
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:41,114
I promise you, Mr. Zagon.

334
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:52,826
Attention, please. Attention, everyone.
Please, guys.

335
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,836
I just want to get a few things
straightened out.

336
00:29:55,925 --> 00:30:00,645
A few minutes ago, I received a call from
the First Deputy Superintendent's office.

337
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:05,122
As we all know, possession of these kinds
of explosives is a federal offense...

338
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:08,966
...and falls under the jurisdiction
of the federal agencies represented here.

339
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:11,386
What kind of bullshit is that?

340
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,821
The Feds come in, the doors close,
nobody hears, smells or sees anything.

341
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:16,110
And that's no answer.

342
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,702
It's no answer to why
the biggest drug dealer in the city...

343
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:20,961
...is out on the street
as free as a fucking bird!

344
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:24,849
Keep it in your pants, all right. These men
have a job to do, just like we do.

345
00:30:24,944 --> 00:30:27,405
It's their game, let them play it.

346
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:33,385
What I'm about to say
does not leave this room. Is that clear?

347
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:36,855
Mr. Salvano has been working
for some time...

348
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:39,739
...in cooperation
with certain federal agencies.

349
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:44,503
I'm not at liberty to divulge the nature
or extent of Mr. Salvano's involvement.

350
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:48,188
I just learned of its existence myself
a few hours ago.

351
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:51,369
One thing I can tell you
is that Mr. Salvano's role...

352
00:30:51,455 --> 00:30:55,379
...is crucial to an extremely sensitive,
ongoing investigation.

353
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:56,502
Any surveillance...

354
00:30:56,598 --> 00:31:01,568
...harassment or unauthorized operations
against this individual are forbidden.

355
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:05,749
I order all of you, with due respect
for your work and your courage...

356
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,336
...to stand down.

357
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:13,362
Why don't you assholes
stand down on this?

358
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:23,643
You're gonna need me.

359
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,235
Need you. For what?

360
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:28,493
To get your ass out of jail.

361
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,714
You think you can afford my bail?

362
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:31,920
No.

363
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:34,177
Neither do I. Not on this pay.

364
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:37,446
You'll end up in jail for a long time,
I have the strangest feeling.

365
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:40,162
You're jealous 'cause I'm gonna stay a cop.

366
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:43,338
What the fuck is this? Go back to work.

367
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,572
Here we go.

368
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:59,229
What are you thinking?

369
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,893
Isn't this your mother's church?

370
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:26,825
Yes, but I'll bet she hasn't seen these boys
in the choir.

371
00:33:48,998 --> 00:33:50,376
Hey, Nico!

372
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:51,608
I can't believe you're in church
without your family.

373
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:52,942
Hello, Father. How are you?

374
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,696
This must be your partner in crime.

375
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:56,583
- Delores Jackson.
- I'm Father Gennaro.

376
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:58,547
I saw you at the baptismal party.

377
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:01,214
- Nico, we gotta go!
- No, please. Wait.

378
00:34:02,147 --> 00:34:03,693
God, it's good you're here.

379
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:06,239
If you got a few minutes,
there's something I'd like to show you.

380
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:07,577
Please.

381
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:12,054
I haven't been down here since I was a kid.

382
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:23,680
What's this?

383
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,137
The rats are getting bigger.

384
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:31,703
- When did this happen?
- Two nights ago. I didn't call the police.

385
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:34,421
What do they want, the bingo receipts?

386
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,087
These are friends.

387
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,383
Father Tomasino, this is Nico.

388
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:12,010
<i>- Mucho gusto, Padre.
- How do you do?</i>

389
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:14,099
- Sister Mary.
- Hi, Nico.

390
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:16,531
- Delores.
- How do you do, Father?

391
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:18,865
<i>- Se�ora, mucho gusto.
- Hello.</i>

392
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:24,394
My friend, Father Tomasino,
is working with the sanctuary movement.

393
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:25,762
He's visiting...

394
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:30,116
...helping his people work out
some of their immigration problems.

395
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,554
Sorry to have troubled you.
Nico, we must go.

396
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:37,393
<i>Gracias.</i>

397
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:41,363
Nice meeting you, sir.

398
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:44,078
Bye-bye.

399
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:02,192
- How long have those people been here?
- Too long.

400
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:05,073
At least the children go to our school.

401
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,961
Who do you think broke into the room?

402
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,474
Kids, maybe. Maybe worse.
It's not the first time.

403
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:15,319
Would you like us to send a car
to check on you?

404
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:18,370
No, please. Police frighten these people.

405
00:36:19,465 --> 00:36:22,473
I know what you mean.
They frighten me, too.

406
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:27,608
It's too far out of your way.
I can't ask you to go to that much trouble.

407
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:29,949
Look, I really don't mind coming by.

408
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,214
Promise, okay? All right?

409
00:36:33,347 --> 00:36:36,855
Say, Nico, by the way,
when was your last confession?

410
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,785
My last confession?

411
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,962
I'm a married man.
I have no sins to confess.

412
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,310
You're a police officer.
You got a lot of sins to confess.

413
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:49,228
He's got your number!

414
00:36:49,864 --> 00:36:54,584
- Is that your impression of police officers?
- I want to see you in church Sunday, okay?

415
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,633
I feel better when you're in church, okay?

416
00:36:57,892 --> 00:37:00,270
You don't show up, I'll call your mother!

417
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,772
I wish you would. She loves you.

418
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:06,627
Why don't you go to church?
It'll be good for you.

419
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:08,797
Get your soul saved.

420
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,748
Our leaders tell us...

421
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,461
...and talk to us about them and us.

422
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:34,852
But almighty God talks to us...

423
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:38,031
...about all of mankind...

424
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,248
...as one.

425
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:44,218
Now, we have an obligation...

426
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:47,474
...to find out what is the truth.

427
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:52,077
We need to study. We need to question.

428
00:37:52,963 --> 00:37:55,924
We need to read and we need to find out...

429
00:37:56,015 --> 00:37:58,594
...what they are doing in our name.

430
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,537
And we must support those brave souls...

431
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:07,179
...who seek...

432
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:09,639
...the truth.

433
00:38:11,696 --> 00:38:13,527
God bless us. Amen.

434
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:05,336
Get down!

435
00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:56,671
There's nothing else we can do.

436
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,687
Lord God, Heavenly Father...

437
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:07,330
...receive the soul of our dear
departed friend, Father Joseph Gennaro.

438
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:13,515
Come on.

439
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:26,820
Get a list of everybody treated here today.
Everybody.

440
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:29,155
Find those sanctuary people...

441
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,924
...the ones we found hiding
in the bottom of the church.

442
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,521
I want to know where they're from
and who might want to harm them.

443
00:40:39,076 --> 00:40:40,193
Where are you gonna be?

444
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:43,083
Just stay by the radio. I'll find you.

445
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,653
- He didn't make it.
- Oh, Nico!

446
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,236
Oh, no!

447
00:41:15,496 --> 00:41:18,754
Lieutenant Strozah, these are FBI agents:
Halloran, Neeley.

448
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:28,451
Sweetheart, go to the car.
I'll be right there, okay? Take Mama.

449
00:41:33,811 --> 00:41:36,688
Nico, you okay? How's the family doing?

450
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,167
Excuse me. I'd like to have a word
with you.

451
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:42,706
Alone.

452
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,224
What the hell is it?

453
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,889
It's you, that's what the fuck it is!

454
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:01,651
Keep your goddamn hands off me!

455
00:42:01,743 --> 00:42:03,787
- You let Salvano walk.
- Salvano?

456
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:04,416
Yeah.

457
00:42:04,502 --> 00:42:06,499
What are you, crazy?
What does he have to do with this?

458
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:08,637
That was no cherry bomb, that was C-4.

459
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:12,317
I've used that shit. I know what it
smells like and what it blows like.

460
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:16,709
Salvano never came near that C-4.
It's in federal holding right now.

461
00:42:16,796 --> 00:42:19,554
Besides, why would Salvano
blow up a church?

462
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,553
I tailed him two days ago.

463
00:42:21,646 --> 00:42:25,605
He and his goon were in that church
and they weren't taking communion.

464
00:42:25,702 --> 00:42:28,913
I saw the woman who planted the bomb
and she was with Salvano's lawyer.

465
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:31,169
Now, I want some fucking answers.

466
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:33,267
You tailed him after I ordered you off?

467
00:42:33,354 --> 00:42:35,767
I want to know where Salvano is.

468
00:42:36,365 --> 00:42:39,539
My orders were to release him,
not babysit him.

469
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:42,626
You think you're rough stuff.

470
00:42:42,721 --> 00:42:46,430
Martial arts hero, chop-suey crap!
Let me tell you something.

471
00:42:46,526 --> 00:42:49,653
You're not bulletproof.
You're not even a good cop.

472
00:42:49,745 --> 00:42:52,242
You sneak around
playing your street-dick games...

473
00:42:52,338 --> 00:42:56,810
...and all you come up with is conjecture,
wild coincidence and bullshit!

474
00:42:56,896 --> 00:43:00,820
I want the name of the federal agent
who signed for those explosives.

475
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,705
You do your job, I'll do mine.

476
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:04,455
Bank on it, pal.

477
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:18,216
- Gentlemen.
- Hello.

478
00:44:18,308 --> 00:44:20,222
Hi, how are you doing?

479
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:31,098
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

480
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:35,442
The wallet. Let me see it.

481
00:44:39,298 --> 00:44:41,379
Aide to Senator Harrison.

482
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:56,144
I hope I find you, you greasy mother!
I'm gonna kick your ass!

483
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,987
Who the fuck do you think you are?

484
00:45:06,227 --> 00:45:11,115
I'm in front of St. Mary's church, where
seven people were killed by a bomb...

485
00:45:50,344 --> 00:45:52,923
- You guys stay out of trouble.
- Okay, Nico.

486
00:45:58,749 --> 00:46:01,043
- I hear you're looking for Salvano.
- You heard that?

487
00:46:01,132 --> 00:46:02,249
I know where he's at.

488
00:46:02,345 --> 00:46:05,187
- Where's that?
- Right here, motherfucker!

489
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:09,197
- It's a long way from Kansas, Dorothy!
- Relax, man. Relax.

490
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,997
I won't shoot you.
These guys will beat you to death.

491
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:15,338
You come to our neighborhood,
fuck with our people.

492
00:46:15,433 --> 00:46:18,394
Now our people are going to fuck with you.

493
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:44,951
We need a doctor!

494
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,170
Fuck him up!

495
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,924
You motherfucker!

496
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,678
Don't kill me! Please don't kill me!

497
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:53,025
- Who sent you?
- Nobody!

498
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:55,442
"Nobody?" You did this for fun?

499
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:00,713
Jimmy Costanza!

500
00:48:02,435 --> 00:48:06,657
If I find out you're lying, I'll come back
and kill you in your own kitchen.

501
00:48:06,742 --> 00:48:07,943
Salvano!

502
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,037
Bautista Salvano!

503
00:48:12,972 --> 00:48:16,099
- That's my buddy, man.
- Yeah, man, I know him.

504
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:20,790
Sic him, Bulldog.

505
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:24,133
- Why are you fuckin' with my friend?
- I'm not in the mood.

506
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,015
Fuck your mood, man.

507
00:48:31,621 --> 00:48:33,535
- What's happening?
- What it be like, homey?

508
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:35,256
- That was real good, man.
- Peace, brother.

509
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:39,815
<i>The mayor has announced the city's offer
of a $25,000 reward for information...</i>

510
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:43,075
<i>... leading to the arrest and conviction
of anyone responsible...</i>

511
00:48:43,162 --> 00:48:46,004
<i>... for today's tragic
St. Mary's church bombing.</i>

512
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,588
Why were we in church?

513
00:48:49,643 --> 00:48:51,224
I'll tell you what.

514
00:48:52,654 --> 00:48:57,126
I'm willing to break the rules and
I'm willing to tell you everything I know.

515
00:48:57,212 --> 00:48:59,126
I just want some time.

516
00:49:02,062 --> 00:49:03,774
It's probably Jax.

517
00:49:04,738 --> 00:49:06,569
Yeah, Jax. This better be good.

518
00:49:06,662 --> 00:49:08,076
It's bad, Nico.

519
00:49:09,923 --> 00:49:11,670
Long time, Nelson.

520
00:49:13,268 --> 00:49:17,525
Come on, man! You know better
than to use a name on an open line.

521
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,964
I'm gonna talk for 15 seconds,
and then I'm getting off.

522
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:27,648
You're in trouble, Nico.
Serious, serious trouble.

523
00:49:29,074 --> 00:49:31,321
Really? That's fascinating.

524
00:49:31,876 --> 00:49:35,087
Take your wife and family
and get them someplace safe, now!

525
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:38,806
I've been wanting to bring my family
to Switzerland. I just haven't had time.

526
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,693
You hear me? Now!
I'm risking my ass by telling you this.

527
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:46,585
Okay, don't take so long
to call me next time.

528
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:48,551
<i>Good luck, pais?</i>

529
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:05,908
Why is the CIA calling you
at 2:00 in the morning?

530
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:10,339
Because Fox is a crazy asshole.

531
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:16,447
He gets drunk, he forgets he's halfway
around the world, and he calls.

532
00:50:19,335 --> 00:50:23,259
He says he just wanted to know
if we got his Christmas card.

533
00:50:24,185 --> 00:50:26,313
Listen, don't be that way.

534
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,861
- I'm just so scared.
- Don't be.

535
00:50:30,374 --> 00:50:33,466
I'm gonna take care of everything,
all right?

536
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:37,397
All right?

537
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:48,846
Nico, who's there?

538
00:51:03,323 --> 00:51:06,997
O'Hara, what's going on, man?
Isn't it a little early for breakfast?

539
00:51:07,086 --> 00:51:08,750
Nico, how you doing?

540
00:51:09,094 --> 00:51:11,008
I'm sorry. I gotta take you downtown.

541
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,264
The Feds want to talk. It'll work out.

542
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,522
Here's the warrant, Toscani.

543
00:51:18,878 --> 00:51:20,673
You fucking piece of shit.

544
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,888
I'll take that, thank you.

545
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:27,281
Easy guys! He's my friend. Take it easy.
It's gonna work out. Let's go.

546
00:51:27,366 --> 00:51:30,374
It'll work out. I'm real sorry about this.

547
00:51:37,276 --> 00:51:39,607
It's not necessary! This is ridiculous!

548
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:42,875
Let him play his pussy game.
This is his setup.

549
00:51:43,507 --> 00:51:46,681
Who do you think you are coming here
and treating my son like a criminal?

550
00:51:46,768 --> 00:51:48,182
Who do you think you are?

551
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:51,650
- Just stop it! There's an infant here!
- Easy, easy.

552
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:57,425
- Check that coat.
- Why don't you come check it, asshole.

553
00:51:58,267 --> 00:51:59,182
Take it easy!

554
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:02,279
Why don't you come
and put your hands on me!

555
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:07,461
- Get him out of here!
- Everything's gonna work out.

556
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:10,308
Come on. I'll be back in three hours!

557
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:15,193
The Police Association's
got lawyers for this!

558
00:52:16,707 --> 00:52:18,419
You can't do this!

559
00:52:25,615 --> 00:52:29,206
This guy, in the middle of the day,
comes in my place and starts wrecking it.

560
00:52:29,295 --> 00:52:31,376
He assaults my customers.

561
00:52:32,013 --> 00:52:36,651
He starts doing all this outer-space stuff,
putting my customers in orbit even.

562
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:41,211
I remember those violations
you told me he was guilty of.

563
00:52:41,295 --> 00:52:43,626
Look, this is my boy, right here.

564
00:52:44,013 --> 00:52:45,510
They finally got you, huh?

565
00:52:45,602 --> 00:52:47,480
They finally got you, motherfucker.

566
00:52:47,568 --> 00:52:50,065
I told you it was gonna go down.
Should've listened...

567
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,027
There he is.

568
00:52:51,122 --> 00:52:54,463
You guys got one hell
of a police department around here.

569
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:57,012
I got a cousin in the department
in New Orleans.

570
00:52:57,101 --> 00:52:59,348
You ever heard of Bob Bouquet?

571
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:09,885
Put your ass in that chair.

572
00:53:13,409 --> 00:53:16,417
Illegal wiretaps, unauthorized surveillance.

573
00:53:18,092 --> 00:53:19,090
When was this guy born?

574
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:22,853
You're quite a cop, Toscani.
You don't listen to anybody, do you?

575
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:25,404
- Where's Jax?
- She's out of this!

576
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,407
You're the rotten apple in this barrel.

577
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,342
We don't need to look any farther
than you and your family.

578
00:53:30,427 --> 00:53:32,258
- You, mother...
- Nico!

579
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,643
Do you want to go to prison?

580
00:53:36,699 --> 00:53:38,280
Unlawful entry.

581
00:53:38,539 --> 00:53:41,333
- Illegal search and seizure.
- Deputy...

582
00:53:44,226 --> 00:53:47,187
Who do you think is pulling their strings?

583
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,158
Who do you think they work for?

584
00:53:50,582 --> 00:53:53,293
You were ordered to back off on Salvano.

585
00:53:53,383 --> 00:53:57,141
I suppose you had too big a hard-on
for that, didn't you?

586
00:53:57,606 --> 00:53:59,853
You can't be in on this, Fred.

587
00:54:01,495 --> 00:54:04,206
You're officially suspended, Toscani.

588
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:07,176
I want your badge and your gun.

589
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:16,246
You gonna hold me?

590
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:18,630
You can walk for now.

591
00:54:19,768 --> 00:54:21,349
Don't walk far.

592
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:32,512
Sara, I'm all right.

593
00:54:33,567 --> 00:54:35,695
It's okay, and I love you.

594
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,061
Tell Mama not to worry. All right?

595
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:42,241
I love you. 'Bye.

596
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:46,169
What the hell is going on?
What's happening here?

597
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:51,151
The sanctuary people, they're refugees
from El Salvador, Guatemala and Chile.

598
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:54,118
They're terrified of cops.
They're not even talking to me.

599
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:58,631
Down at the morgue, they got a guy
who was not a congregation member.

600
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:01,392
Alan Singletary.

601
00:55:02,362 --> 00:55:05,822
He's an aide to Senator Harrison.
The Foreign Relations Committee Harrison.

602
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:10,138
The guy who's been crawling all over
the Central American drug connections.

603
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:12,522
You're gonna make a hell of a DA.

604
00:55:12,606 --> 00:55:16,696
Harrison's staff has been compiling
some kind of heavyweight white paper.

605
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,177
It implicates some of the major
intelligence agencies in drug trafficking.

606
00:55:21,262 --> 00:55:23,224
They'll release it next week.

607
00:55:24,356 --> 00:55:26,650
- So that's how Fox knew.
- Who?

608
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:32,248
An old Agency buddy of mine called me
last night. He said my family's in danger.

609
00:55:32,343 --> 00:55:34,138
Luke, I need a favor.

610
00:55:34,224 --> 00:55:37,601
I need you to go to the house, call
Uncle Branca. Mama's got the number.

611
00:55:37,695 --> 00:55:39,407
Get the family ready to move out.

612
00:55:39,493 --> 00:55:43,084
<i>You got it, buddy.
They took away your pistola, right?</i>

613
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,456
Yeah.

614
00:55:45,974 --> 00:55:46,675
Thanks.

615
00:55:46,768 --> 00:55:48,349
I don't believe this.

616
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:05,369
You come in here, with the children,
and bring all this up...

617
00:56:07,592 --> 00:56:08,757
Listen.

618
00:56:08,846 --> 00:56:10,308
You know me.

619
00:56:10,644 --> 00:56:12,606
Please, tell these people...

620
00:56:12,693 --> 00:56:14,987
...they don't have anything to worry about.

621
00:56:15,077 --> 00:56:18,038
There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola.

622
00:56:18,505 --> 00:56:20,086
I know, Sister.

623
00:56:29,377 --> 00:56:31,041
Father Tomasino.

624
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,804
He came alone...

625
00:56:35,775 --> 00:56:38,354
...two weeks ago. He had papers...

626
00:56:39,454 --> 00:56:41,915
...papers to give to the senator.

627
00:56:42,925 --> 00:56:46,385
Father Tomasino was going
to give the mass that day.

628
00:56:47,357 --> 00:56:49,936
Father Gennaro talked him out of it.

629
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:52,870
He was afraid for Father Tomasino.

630
00:56:53,295 --> 00:56:56,387
So it was Father Tomasino
they wanted to kill.

631
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,230
Where is Father Tomasino?

632
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,567
He go, mister. He ran away.

633
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:07,337
If anybody knows where he is, you've got
to tell me because I know I can help him.

634
00:57:07,428 --> 00:57:09,342
We don't know, mister.

635
00:57:22,816 --> 00:57:25,313
Jax, I'm serious. You're out of this.

636
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:29,082
Wait a minute. I got a list.
You told me to get a list.

637
00:57:30,384 --> 00:57:33,345
I'm telling you, you're finished.
I mean it. Out.

638
00:57:33,436 --> 00:57:36,015
You're not talking to a rookie,
you understand?

639
00:57:36,113 --> 00:57:40,417
You go home, you take care of your family,
okay, and I'll call you.

640
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:44,934
Paperwork only!

641
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,439
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

642
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,911
Thank you!

643
00:58:07,808 --> 00:58:10,935
Okay, come across now.
Come on, baby, come on.

644
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:15,202
Hi, Nico!

645
00:58:39,586 --> 00:58:41,714
- Call the police.
- Come on!

646
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,940
Freeze, motherfucker!

647
00:58:48,116 --> 00:58:50,113
Anybody moves, he dies.

648
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:53,383
Drop that magazine, motherfucker, now!

649
00:58:54,807 --> 00:58:58,065
Everybody's gonna ditch their weapons,
butt first.

650
00:58:58,152 --> 00:59:01,160
Grab the barrel and do it, everybody. You!

651
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:03,080
Now, you.

652
00:59:03,713 --> 00:59:04,830
Now, you.

653
00:59:06,766 --> 00:59:08,597
Put your hands on your head.

654
00:59:08,689 --> 00:59:11,186
All right, fall in behind the last man.

655
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:14,243
I don't think you can drop us all, badass.

656
00:59:14,836 --> 00:59:17,047
You're right, but I'll get an "A" for effort.

657
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,050
All right. Let's go. Fall out!

658
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:21,140
Put your hands on your head.

659
00:59:21,233 --> 00:59:23,064
Come on, you! Move!

660
00:59:28,805 --> 00:59:31,813
Please don't come in here. Please, please.

661
00:59:32,276 --> 00:59:33,940
Not in my store.

662
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:36,778
It's a police emergency. I'm a cop.

663
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:39,883
On your knees. Give me the phone.
Let's go.

664
00:59:41,057 --> 00:59:43,899
- This guy's gotta work, too.
- Get down, asshole.

665
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:45,565
Get the fuck down!

666
00:59:45,824 --> 00:59:46,989
You wanna get down?

667
00:59:47,078 --> 00:59:49,456
Get down on your fucking knees!

668
01:00:10,536 --> 01:00:12,533
They tell me, "Come to America!"

669
01:00:17,853 --> 01:00:19,565
No, not in my store!

670
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:25,042
There's the police!

671
01:00:30,105 --> 01:00:31,519
No, mister!

672
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:55,190
Another police car.

673
01:00:59,207 --> 01:01:00,871
Look! My store.

674
01:01:06,023 --> 01:01:08,401
Come on, come on. Is it clear?

675
01:01:09,243 --> 01:01:12,870
Sara, Branca will take care of us.
We'll be safe there.

676
01:01:13,675 --> 01:01:16,849
Family goes in the Lincoln.
I'll ride in front.

677
01:01:26,972 --> 01:01:30,646
I'll be five minutes behind you.
It's got to be this way.

678
01:01:32,093 --> 01:01:33,341
Let's go.

679
01:01:35,187 --> 01:01:36,220
Where's Jax?

680
01:01:36,316 --> 01:01:39,657
She thinks there's some documents
in some guy's apartment.

681
01:01:41,334 --> 01:01:43,628
They killed the wrong priest.

682
01:01:44,637 --> 01:01:46,800
What are you talking about?

683
01:01:51,244 --> 01:01:53,920
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

684
01:01:55,258 --> 01:01:57,886
The second priest from Costa Rica...

685
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:02,900
...hiding in the church.
He was the one they meant to kill.

686
01:02:03,747 --> 01:02:05,494
You know where to find this guy?

687
01:02:05,586 --> 01:02:07,000
No, I do not.

688
01:02:08,221 --> 01:02:10,135
Then you're gonna need help.

689
01:02:10,228 --> 01:02:12,559
Yeah, I'd like you to help me.

690
01:02:12,737 --> 01:02:14,401
Watch my family.

691
01:02:14,995 --> 01:02:16,909
What are you gonna do?

692
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,334
You don't want to know.

693
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:35,147
Freeze! Put your hands up in the air.

694
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,076
Now go put them on the hood of the car.

695
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:43,384
Special Agent Neeley, what were you doing
with that woman up there?

696
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:48,399
Were you engaging in some kind
of unnatural sex acts with that young lady?

697
01:02:49,115 --> 01:02:50,696
She must be 15!

698
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:53,454
That's illegal in some states, you know.

699
01:02:53,547 --> 01:02:54,878
What are you talking about?

700
01:02:54,969 --> 01:02:58,429
I thought you federal agents were straight,
honorable guys.

701
01:02:58,523 --> 01:03:00,854
Does your wife know about this?

702
01:03:01,826 --> 01:03:04,073
Sex is not the only thing in life.

703
01:03:04,168 --> 01:03:05,416
Get in.

704
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:17,208
- So, how has your day been?
- Okay.

705
01:03:20,517 --> 01:03:23,145
Listen, Toscani, I want to congratulate you.

706
01:03:23,235 --> 01:03:25,696
You just made number four
on the "most-wanted" list.

707
01:03:25,786 --> 01:03:28,544
Number four? I want to be number one.

708
01:03:30,595 --> 01:03:32,176
The day is young.

709
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:36,693
What can I do for you?

710
01:03:36,783 --> 01:03:41,123
There was a quantity of C-4 explosive
brought in here four days ago.

711
01:03:41,675 --> 01:03:43,053
Hell, that's gone.

712
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:44,553
- When?
- Right away.

713
01:03:44,644 --> 01:03:47,605
They scooped that stuff out of here
before it even got tagged.

714
01:03:47,697 --> 01:03:49,361
You know who took it?

715
01:03:49,453 --> 01:03:50,451
CIA.

716
01:03:53,969 --> 01:03:55,931
Let me see the paperwork on it.

717
01:03:56,018 --> 01:03:57,682
You got to sign.

718
01:03:57,857 --> 01:04:02,329
Yeah, I remember that fellow.
Flew special out of Langley. Bomb tech.

719
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:04,503
Real nice fellow.

720
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,713
- I'll bet.
- Here it is.

721
01:04:07,182 --> 01:04:08,215
"Fox."

722
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,059
"Nelson Fox."

723
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:16,248
- Thanks.
- Right.

724
01:04:18,012 --> 01:04:19,177
Now what?

725
01:04:20,437 --> 01:04:25,027
<i>Yes, sir. The agent has been with
the Central American desk since 1984.</i>

726
01:04:25,455 --> 01:04:28,131
Thank you. That's what I wanted to know.

727
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:30,592
All right, take your shoes off.

728
01:04:31,476 --> 01:04:33,140
Come on, let's go.

729
01:04:35,281 --> 01:04:37,860
So you think I'm a bad cop, Neeley?

730
01:04:38,752 --> 01:04:40,915
You know something? Maybe I am.

731
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,804
But at least I don't have my face
buried up Washington's ass.

732
01:04:43,895 --> 01:04:46,737
Listen, Toscani.
Maybe I've judged you a little harshly.

733
01:04:46,822 --> 01:04:48,700
I think you have.
And you know something?

734
01:04:48,787 --> 01:04:52,045
What I'd like to do,
for the way you've treated me...

735
01:04:52,132 --> 01:04:55,056
...is treat you in a similar fashion.
I'd like you to get up...

736
01:04:55,143 --> 01:04:57,854
...run your ass over there
and jump in the fucking lake.

737
01:04:57,944 --> 01:05:00,523
If you don't hurry,
I'll empty this gun in your butt.

738
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,534
Move it, Agent Neeley!

739
01:05:05,178 --> 01:05:06,509
Let's go!

740
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,547
Jump, Neeley!

741
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:50,253
Nico, what are you doing here?

742
01:05:50,341 --> 01:05:52,255
- I need a favor.
- Sure.

743
01:05:54,021 --> 01:05:57,113
- How late are you gonna be here today?
- I'm off at 6:00.

744
01:05:57,199 --> 01:05:58,577
I'll be here.

745
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:08,060
Don't be too long, lady.
I got a crew coming in.

746
01:06:08,154 --> 01:06:10,317
Thanks. We'll be done in a little while.

747
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:12,076
We don't have much time.

748
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:15,592
They're going to tear this goddamn place
down in a matter of hours.

749
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,391
There's no way to access
Covert Operations directly...

750
01:06:18,482 --> 01:06:22,536
...but I got a guy at Princeton.
He has a database bigger than Langley.

751
01:06:24,294 --> 01:06:26,707
How the hell did you get in this mess?

752
01:06:26,803 --> 01:06:29,727
I thought you were finished with the CIA.

753
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:34,704
Trap door.

754
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,448
We'll wriggle up these two...

755
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:49,917
...operative dossiers.

756
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:54,144
Start with my friend, Nelson.

757
01:07:07,864 --> 01:07:10,195
Your friend has had a hell of a career.

758
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:13,917
Give me the names of every Agency man
involved in this.

759
01:07:19,656 --> 01:07:21,903
Nico, what is going on here?

760
01:07:24,088 --> 01:07:25,502
Here we go.

761
01:07:26,095 --> 01:07:30,768
Five agents from the Central American
desk. All of them, trained assassins.

762
01:07:30,862 --> 01:07:35,285
They've all come to Chicago
in the last week and they're all still here.

763
01:07:36,382 --> 01:07:39,390
They got the whole fucking
killing team here.

764
01:07:39,476 --> 01:07:41,140
It looks that way.

765
01:07:45,623 --> 01:07:46,871
Thanks.

766
01:07:49,428 --> 01:07:50,759
I owe you one.

767
01:07:50,849 --> 01:07:53,941
- Where are you going?
- I gotta find that priest.

768
01:07:54,027 --> 01:07:55,441
Be careful.

769
01:07:59,547 --> 01:08:01,544
<i>I find this totally incredulous.</i>

770
01:08:01,637 --> 01:08:06,060
<i>You, being a station chief at the CIA,
didn't know what was going on?</i>

771
01:08:06,153 --> 01:08:08,400
<i>Mr. Senator,
I'd like to explain a few things.</i>

772
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:12,633
<i>Either you perjured yourself earlier,
or you're lying to us now.</i>

773
01:08:13,513 --> 01:08:16,189
<i>Take a few moments
before you answer this.</i>

774
01:08:16,272 --> 01:08:18,603
<i>And remember that you're under oath.</i>

775
01:08:18,698 --> 01:08:23,455
<i>It was agreed this was a valuable asset
and that I had to work out a way...</i>

776
01:08:23,715 --> 01:08:26,128
<i>... they had to work out a way
in which to take over.</i>

777
01:08:26,224 --> 01:08:28,982
<i>And did that include
giving money to the enterprise?</i>

778
01:08:29,068 --> 01:08:30,899
<i>Not insofar as I knew.</i>

779
01:08:30,991 --> 01:08:33,488
<i>- And the colonel never told you?
- No.</i>

780
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:36,757
<i>Are you saying that this was going
to be a donation for the CIA...</i>

781
01:08:36,845 --> 01:08:38,307
<i>... as far as you were concerned?</i>

782
01:08:38,392 --> 01:08:39,854
<i>We were going to walk away from it.</i>

783
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:41,140
Hello.

784
01:08:42,615 --> 01:08:44,196
Oh, yes, Sister. Yes.

785
01:08:44,288 --> 01:08:46,083
Sister Mary, right.

786
01:08:47,382 --> 01:08:51,520
No, there will be no problem.
Now just calm down. Right, right.

787
01:08:51,814 --> 01:08:53,395
Now where are you?

788
01:09:05,948 --> 01:09:07,196
Who is it?

789
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:38,976
Father!

790
01:09:39,064 --> 01:09:40,895
Get her out of here.

791
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:45,830
This way, Father.

792
01:10:39,695 --> 01:10:41,609
Where did you find this guy?

793
01:10:41,702 --> 01:10:45,626
The nun from the daycare called.
She's with the priest at a place on Damon.

794
01:10:45,716 --> 01:10:48,974
She saw two guys sneaking
around the church and she got scared.

795
01:10:49,061 --> 01:10:50,975
I got papers from that senator's aide.

796
01:10:51,068 --> 01:10:55,658
Everything Harrison has been working on.
It's unbelievable. It's over at my place.

797
01:10:55,752 --> 01:11:00,056
I need you to do me a favor.
Stay out of it. Just stay in the car.

798
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:04,317
Nico, far be it for me to complain...

799
01:11:04,867 --> 01:11:09,041
...but you got Jax pulling burglaries.
You got me doing God only knows what.

800
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:12,556
When we hit the joint,
I don't want you celling with me.

801
01:11:12,645 --> 01:11:14,976
Jax, we'll work out something.

802
01:11:29,705 --> 01:11:32,749
Why don't you go over there
and sweet-talk him?

803
01:11:32,841 --> 01:11:33,874
Sure.

804
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:47,213
If I were you, I would listen
to what this man has to say.

805
01:11:48,354 --> 01:11:50,601
He knows what's best for you.

806
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:06,247
You wouldn't lie to me would you, Father?

807
01:12:06,877 --> 01:12:08,291
It's a sin.

808
01:12:09,428 --> 01:12:10,759
Look at me!

809
01:12:11,017 --> 01:12:14,976
If you spoke to anyone
about our plans to kill the senator...

810
01:12:15,742 --> 01:12:17,454
...tell me now...

811
01:12:18,711 --> 01:12:21,005
...and I won't have to use this.

812
01:12:21,094 --> 01:12:23,971
This is from confession. I tell no one.

813
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:41,623
Let's go.

814
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,904
Under no circumstances
are you to come out of this car.

815
01:12:48,988 --> 01:12:51,069
Just stay here, all right?

816
01:12:56,514 --> 01:12:58,511
Take a nice look at it.

817
01:12:58,605 --> 01:13:00,519
I got it just for you.

818
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:08,547
Do you feel that? Nice?

819
01:13:09,728 --> 01:13:11,274
You like that?

820
01:13:14,913 --> 01:13:18,040
Now you're gonna start feeling
something warm.

821
01:13:18,341 --> 01:13:20,385
Very warm and wonderful.

822
01:13:20,934 --> 01:13:22,348
Think about it.

823
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,402
Warm. I love it!

824
01:13:26,286 --> 01:13:29,544
I enjoy this. I really enjoy the shit out
of this thing.

825
01:13:29,631 --> 01:13:31,426
We'll enjoy it together.

826
01:13:31,722 --> 01:13:35,349
You've always been alone.
Now you'll be with me, together!

827
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:55,545
I want to know who you told.

828
01:13:56,894 --> 01:13:58,440
I told them...

829
01:14:00,365 --> 01:14:01,911
...you make...

830
01:14:01,995 --> 01:14:04,076
...the children see you...

831
01:14:04,504 --> 01:14:06,835
...mutilating their mothers...

832
01:14:07,933 --> 01:14:09,728
...and sometimes...

833
01:14:10,275 --> 01:14:12,356
...you do these things...

834
01:14:12,783 --> 01:14:14,578
...to the children.

835
01:14:15,878 --> 01:14:17,756
<i>Did you tell anybody?</i>

836
01:14:20,895 --> 01:14:22,773
<i>Damn it, tell me now!</i>

837
01:14:23,446 --> 01:14:24,908
<i>Tell me now!</i>

838
01:14:31,265 --> 01:14:33,809
<i>Father, I have had enough of this.</i>

839
01:14:35,948 --> 01:14:38,825
Father, I want you to tell me the truth.

840
01:14:40,214 --> 01:14:41,878
Can we kill him?

841
01:14:42,973 --> 01:14:46,314
If you told anyone about our plans
to kill the senator...

842
01:14:46,402 --> 01:14:48,316
...we cannot kill him!

843
01:14:50,082 --> 01:14:51,365
Nothing!

844
01:14:58,235 --> 01:14:59,518
Phase two.

845
01:15:06,097 --> 01:15:07,214
Christ!

846
01:15:29,345 --> 01:15:32,603
- Move it!
- What are you doing? Get out of here.

847
01:15:35,868 --> 01:15:38,199
Jax, get the hell out of here!

848
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:47,355
Nico!

849
01:15:54,601 --> 01:15:55,718
Jax!

850
01:16:03,842 --> 01:16:05,423
- Go!
- I got him!

851
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:27,340
Where is he?

852
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:30,303
Down there!

853
01:16:35,997 --> 01:16:39,374
I got a bona fide emergency here.
What am I supposed to do?

854
01:16:44,694 --> 01:16:46,025
- Shut the fuck up!
- Yes, sir.

855
01:16:46,116 --> 01:16:47,947
Get inside! Come on!

856
01:16:49,837 --> 01:16:52,250
I hear sirens but I don't see any cops.

857
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:55,390
If they were cops,
they'd show me their badges, asshole.

858
01:16:55,482 --> 01:16:57,776
A bona fide gunfight, asshole!

859
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:01,836
Get up front!

860
01:17:02,382 --> 01:17:05,925
- Shut up! Be quiet!
- What the hell am I supposed to do?

861
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:09,897
Get the car on Track 3 out of the way.
At least, get that out of the way.

862
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:14,046
They got guns all over the place.
I got a carload of passengers.

863
01:18:21,787 --> 01:18:25,925
Damn it! Call Nico's uncle
and find out if he's heard from him.

864
01:18:26,888 --> 01:18:28,719
Shut up and save your strength.

865
01:18:28,812 --> 01:18:30,643
I'm okay. I'm okay.

866
01:18:30,986 --> 01:18:32,900
- Where are we going?
- Cubicle D.

867
01:18:32,993 --> 01:18:34,705
I got on my vest.

868
01:18:37,802 --> 01:18:39,216
Where is he?

869
01:18:40,018 --> 01:18:41,396
What do you mean you don't know?

870
01:18:41,481 --> 01:18:44,239
We don't know what happened
to him, Branca.

871
01:18:44,325 --> 01:18:45,953
Yeah, she's gonna be all right.

872
01:18:46,039 --> 01:18:48,618
You hear anything, you let me know.

873
01:18:49,844 --> 01:18:51,045
<i>Capisci?</i>

874
01:18:54,193 --> 01:18:55,441
It's Nico.

875
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:00,289
Jesus Christ.

876
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,747
The motherfuckers got Jax.

877
01:19:10,918 --> 01:19:12,832
Lukich called. She's not dead.

878
01:19:12,925 --> 01:19:15,636
She's gonna make it.
She was wearing a vest.

879
01:19:32,285 --> 01:19:34,579
This was picked up with your mail
this morning.

880
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:37,511
They're letting you know
if you don't back off...

881
01:19:37,596 --> 01:19:39,593
...they're gonna get to your family.

882
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:42,266
- You've got to do it, Nico.
- Tell him, Sara.

883
01:19:42,363 --> 01:19:44,194
You know you have to.

884
01:19:44,495 --> 01:19:46,290
Listen to her, Nicola.

885
01:19:46,377 --> 01:19:47,958
This is your family.

886
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:53,019
Ever notice how clean babies smell, like
nothing in the world has touched them?

887
01:20:03,646 --> 01:20:06,143
Mom, take him upstairs, will you?

888
01:20:08,935 --> 01:20:11,313
Come, Giuliano, we'll go upstairs.

889
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:19,671
Do you know why I love you?

890
01:20:20,183 --> 01:20:23,191
What it is about you
that I've always loved?

891
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,733
It's pride.

892
01:20:26,496 --> 01:20:29,420
But, Nico, that pride may kill all of us.

893
01:20:35,863 --> 01:20:37,658
Swallow your pride.

894
01:20:40,546 --> 01:20:42,793
Choke on it, if you have to.

895
01:20:43,766 --> 01:20:46,690
- Lay it down, please.
- You know something?

896
01:20:47,404 --> 01:20:51,494
There's nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do for my family.

897
01:20:51,919 --> 01:20:53,750
Nobody will harm us.

898
01:20:54,888 --> 01:20:57,385
I don't want you to worry. Okay?

899
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:38,582
Not even you can hit him
at this range, Nico.

900
01:21:40,089 --> 01:21:41,967
That wasn't the plan, Nelson.

901
01:21:42,055 --> 01:21:43,517
Close range?

902
01:21:44,522 --> 01:21:47,982
It'd never work. It's rigged.
Scanned every 35 seconds.

903
01:21:48,076 --> 01:21:51,000
I was thinking of a claymore on the roof...

904
01:21:51,379 --> 01:21:52,412
No!

905
01:21:52,926 --> 01:21:56,053
The roof is wired, too.
Sensors every 15 feet.

906
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:58,528
Okay. Now you can move.

907
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:01,954
- It's me. You don't have to treat me like...
- Slow!

908
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:05,550
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.
Move! Slow.

909
01:22:05,763 --> 01:22:09,223
You even look at me funny,
you're in the river, Toscani.

910
01:22:09,317 --> 01:22:12,610
I figured you'd do your recon
from this building.

911
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:18,053
- You're looking fit.
- I'm getting a bit of a tire.

912
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:21,019
- Is that your own tailor?
- Hong Kong.

913
01:22:21,694 --> 01:22:23,941
- You've come a long way.
- Yeah.

914
01:22:24,705 --> 01:22:25,988
Just walk.

915
01:22:27,716 --> 01:22:29,047
I don't believe you.

916
01:22:29,137 --> 01:22:33,227
What's so hard to believe?
I want to help you, you dumb guinea.

917
01:22:33,946 --> 01:22:36,324
I've been trying to talk
some sense into you.

918
01:22:36,413 --> 01:22:38,375
You're still "Fox the Fixer."

919
01:22:38,462 --> 01:22:42,552
If I wanted to cap you,
I'd save myself all this damn chitchat.

920
01:22:43,103 --> 01:22:46,277
I'd make big points for myself
if I brought your scalp in.

921
01:22:46,365 --> 01:22:48,528
Shit, I'd be White House material.

922
01:22:48,706 --> 01:22:50,917
Is that what Zagon is,
one of your basement boys?

923
01:22:51,006 --> 01:22:54,883
Zagon's a rancher. 4,000 acres
in Costa Rica. Beautiful place.

924
01:22:54,979 --> 01:22:59,699
Beautiful place, huh? Was that bought
with opium money from the triangle?

925
01:23:00,247 --> 01:23:02,791
And a ton of coke a week
from other places.

926
01:23:02,881 --> 01:23:06,472
Which he funnels here through Salvano.
The company getting it's cut, of course.

927
01:23:06,561 --> 01:23:08,058
Legal tender.

928
01:23:09,446 --> 01:23:12,454
So war is still the greatest business, huh?

929
01:23:13,126 --> 01:23:17,300
These guys have started and financed
every war we've ever fought.

930
01:23:17,433 --> 01:23:21,571
Nobody would believe me if I told them
the bankers were the CIA.

931
01:23:22,409 --> 01:23:25,120
Come on, Toscani, don't preach to me.

932
01:23:25,587 --> 01:23:27,798
So the senator couldn't be bought,
could he?

933
01:23:27,886 --> 01:23:32,606
He was gonna expose your plans to invade
Nicaragua with your fucking coke money.

934
01:23:32,862 --> 01:23:35,323
So the Agency clears Zagon
to cap his ass, right?

935
01:23:35,413 --> 01:23:37,375
Just keep walking, asshole.

936
01:23:37,462 --> 01:23:40,423
So some poor, innocent priest finds out.
He comes here.

937
01:23:40,514 --> 01:23:44,022
<i>But you can't kill the senator
until you know if the padre has talked.</i>

938
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:48,914
So Zagon comes in, "Tell me," with his
little doctor bag. Only by then, I'm in on it.

939
01:23:49,337 --> 01:23:52,964
And you fucking know
I'm gonna recognize his handiwork.

940
01:23:54,187 --> 01:23:56,863
If your name would've been Joe Smith,
I never would've caught it.

941
01:23:56,947 --> 01:23:59,741
But how many Nicola Toscanis are there?

942
01:24:00,292 --> 01:24:04,299
Tell me something, old buddy.
Do we kill our own senators now?

943
01:24:05,477 --> 01:24:06,891
Why not? The Romans did.

944
01:24:06,983 --> 01:24:09,907
- Are we the fucking Romans?
- We're an empire, too.

945
01:24:10,035 --> 01:24:12,663
You don't believe that shit for a minute.

946
01:24:11,753 --> 01:24:13,334
Just walk. Go!

947
01:24:24,255 --> 01:24:25,669
Hold it, Nico.

948
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:31,319
- Here's your key, sir.
- My buddy will drive.

949
01:24:38,096 --> 01:24:39,808
You know something?

950
01:24:39,894 --> 01:24:44,614
In Europe, they're trying some 80-year-old
camp guard for Nazi war crimes.

951
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,421
All around our country,
they got guys on Death Row...

952
01:24:48,508 --> 01:24:51,266
...for murdering one, two, three guys.

953
01:24:51,644 --> 01:24:54,568
And they probably deserve
what they're gonna get.

954
01:24:54,654 --> 01:24:56,318
But you and I...

955
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:58,823
...we know people
that are personally responsible...

956
01:24:58,919 --> 01:25:02,260
...for the death
of 50,000 non-military personnel.

957
01:25:02,933 --> 01:25:06,691
Librarians, teachers, doctors,
women, children, all dead.

958
01:25:07,658 --> 01:25:10,071
We've wiped out entire cultures.

959
01:25:10,335 --> 01:25:11,797
And for what?

960
01:25:12,342 --> 01:25:16,932
Not one CIA agent has ever been tried,
much less accused, of any crimes.

961
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:22,328
You guys think you're above the law,
but you ain't above mine.

962
01:25:24,384 --> 01:25:28,177
Nico, we don't have time for this.
Get in the goddamn car.

963
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:55,611
I've been waiting for the day
I'd catch up with this motherfucker.

964
01:26:02,184 --> 01:26:04,562
Salvano and his scumbag dealer.

965
01:26:05,989 --> 01:26:07,986
What a team we got here.

966
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:10,452
I told you, you'd never be the man.

967
01:26:10,547 --> 01:26:13,126
Nelson, we've been looking for you.

968
01:26:14,519 --> 01:26:16,065
I see that you...

969
01:26:16,694 --> 01:26:18,441
...found our friend.

970
01:26:18,533 --> 01:26:19,995
Thanks, Fox.

971
01:26:20,457 --> 01:26:22,751
I didn't bring him. I swear it.

972
01:26:23,258 --> 01:26:25,969
You two must have had a lot to talk about.

973
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:28,557
Reminiscing about the good old days?

974
01:26:28,652 --> 01:26:29,900
Stay still!

975
01:26:31,287 --> 01:26:33,284
Just fucking don't move.

976
01:26:33,628 --> 01:26:35,875
Nelson, bring our friend in.

977
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:42,776
Come on, be a good boy.

978
01:26:44,124 --> 01:26:45,538
Dive, Nico!

979
01:27:02,104 --> 01:27:03,982
Get that motherfucker!

980
01:27:20,753 --> 01:27:21,918
Move it!

981
01:27:25,227 --> 01:27:26,392
Get him!

982
01:27:56,588 --> 01:27:58,585
Stop the car, you fuck!

983
01:28:04,825 --> 01:28:07,203
Stop the car, you piece of shit!

984
01:28:08,337 --> 01:28:09,620
Stop it!

985
01:28:27,697 --> 01:28:29,075
Fox's car!

986
01:29:14,111 --> 01:29:15,775
<i>He's on the ramp now.</i>

987
01:29:15,867 --> 01:29:19,041
<i>He's coming out the Wabash entrance.
Get there, Deep Throat.</i>

988
01:29:19,129 --> 01:29:21,673
<i>Roger, Spike Leader. We read you.</i>

989
01:29:30,753 --> 01:29:32,548
Get out of the car!

990
01:29:32,718 --> 01:29:34,430
I want him alive.

991
01:29:41,917 --> 01:29:43,331
He's clean.

992
01:29:43,966 --> 01:29:45,547
Bring him over.

993
01:29:46,353 --> 01:29:47,386
Let's go!

994
01:29:50,786 --> 01:29:54,710
We're out of here.
Abandon the vehicles and get out of here.

995
01:29:55,511 --> 01:29:58,519
Tommy, hurry up! Get in.
We're out of here.

996
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:16,874
<i>Now, our honored guest,
Senator Ernest Harrison.</i>

997
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:41,124
I hope this don't take too long
'cause I'm getting hungry.

998
01:30:48,405 --> 01:30:51,282
This is bullshit. We've got work to do.

999
01:30:52,085 --> 01:30:55,046
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

1000
01:30:57,145 --> 01:31:01,402
We've got an hour before we say good-bye
to the honorable senator.

1001
01:31:01,786 --> 01:31:05,044
You know, you've got to learn
to take time to...

1002
01:31:05,717 --> 01:31:07,512
...smell the roses.

1003
01:31:08,058 --> 01:31:11,316
How are you gonna do him?
Do him in the motorcade...

1004
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:14,574
...or pass him through a hotel kitchen?

1005
01:31:23,738 --> 01:31:25,235
Put his face up.

1006
01:31:27,585 --> 01:31:28,833
Hold it up.

1007
01:31:29,927 --> 01:31:32,555
Here you go, Toscani. "Dr. Feelgood."

1008
01:31:46,778 --> 01:31:50,702
I've used these little beauties many times
to extract information.

1009
01:31:50,792 --> 01:31:53,123
For the first time in my life...

1010
01:31:53,468 --> 01:31:56,096
...I'm gonna do it just for the fun.

1011
01:31:58,611 --> 01:32:00,692
Get the fuck away from me!

1012
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:39,869
Let him go.

1013
01:32:53,137 --> 01:32:55,468
Toscani, my sleeping beauty...

1014
01:32:56,106 --> 01:32:58,519
...you should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1015
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:01,112
You're too fucking dumb, asshole.

1016
01:33:05,932 --> 01:33:07,478
Jake! Look out!

1017
01:33:45,603 --> 01:33:47,481
Say something. Nico?

1018
01:33:49,617 --> 01:33:50,615
Is there a doctor here?

1019
01:33:50,705 --> 01:33:52,749
Quick! Call an ambulance!

1020
01:33:56,559 --> 01:34:01,316
Agent Neeley, FBI. We've got a problem,
but we don't know what it is, yet.

1021
01:34:05,967 --> 01:34:08,546
Please, Senator Harrison, this way.

1022
01:34:09,354 --> 01:34:13,611
<i>We are standing in front of the home
of Police Sergeant Nico Toscani.</i>

1023
01:34:13,702 --> 01:34:17,079
<i>Behind me, the entourage
of Senator Harrison is arriving.</i>

1024
01:34:17,173 --> 01:34:21,561
<i>Lots of security here. We have police
officers on the scene and federal agents.</i>

1025
01:34:21,647 --> 01:34:24,655
<i>Of course, there is concern
of a possible assassination attempt.</i>

1026
01:34:24,741 --> 01:34:28,665
<i>That's why you've got
so many law enforcement officers here.</i>

1027
01:34:32,937 --> 01:34:36,148
- This is Senator Harrison. Nico Toscani.
- How do you do?

1028
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:38,071
Please, don't get up.

1029
01:34:38,456 --> 01:34:40,287
Detective Toscani...

1030
01:34:40,505 --> 01:34:44,382
...I just felt compelled to come
and thank you personally...

1031
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:47,902
...and to assure you that we'll use
every resource available...

1032
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:49,868
...to bring these men to justice...

1033
01:34:49,955 --> 01:34:54,295
...and to ensure that this type of behavior
will never be tolerated again.

1034
01:34:46,777 --> 01:34:48,572
That would be nice.

1035
01:34:58,193 --> 01:35:02,152
Let me introduce Roberta Alspaugh
of the Fifth Circuit Court.

1036
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:03,784
How do you do, ma'am?

1037
01:35:03,879 --> 01:35:06,210
Are you sure you're well enough?

1038
01:35:07,434 --> 01:35:10,526
I'm ready to talk if you're ready to listen.

1039
01:35:01,747 --> 01:35:02,995
All right.

1040
01:35:12,911 --> 01:35:16,538
- Miss Jackson, I'll leave you now.
- Senator, thank you.

1041
01:35:18,222 --> 01:35:22,360
- We'll be leaving for Washington.
- Hey buddy, we'll be back later.

1042
01:35:16,424 --> 01:35:17,970
Mr. Toscani...

1043
01:35:27,463 --> 01:35:30,804
...can you tell us about
your military background?

1044
01:35:34,989 --> 01:35:38,330
In 1973, I worked for
a special operations group...

1045
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:41,793
...in Vietnam and Cambodia.

1046
01:35:42,683 --> 01:35:45,560
I was involved with gathering intelligence.

1047
01:35:45,652 --> 01:35:49,992
All of the members of this team
were doctors recruited by the CIA...

1048
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:54,219
...and trained at a secret camp
in Langley, Virginia.

1049
01:36:06,475 --> 01:36:10,066
<i>Gentlemen, whenever you have a group
of individuals...</i>

1050
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:12,742
<i>... who are beyond any investigation...</i>

1051
01:36:12,831 --> 01:36:17,135
<i>... who can manipulate the press,
judges, members of our Congress...</i>

1052
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:22,274
<i>... you'll have within our government
those who are above the law.</i>

1053
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:41,689
