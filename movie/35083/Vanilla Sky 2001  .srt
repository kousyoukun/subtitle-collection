1
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:01,050
睜開你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

2
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:05,961
睜開你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

3
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,755
睜開你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

4
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,428
睜開你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

5
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:24,200
睜開你的…
Open your...

6
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:13,213
睜開你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

7
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:17,586
睜開你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

8
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:22,021
大衛，睜開你的...
David, open your...

9
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,529
那麼, 我猜
空蕩的街道意味著孤獨吧
Well, I suppose
the empty street meant loneliness.

10
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:30,895
你是個精神病專家,應該有更好的分析
You're a shrink.
You gotta do better than that.

11
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:34,266
我是個醫生, 我倆別互相存有偏見
I'm a doctor.
Let's not stereotype each other.

12
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:37,306
不是所有的有錢少爺都空虛...
Not all rich kids
are soulless and...

13
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:40,467
也不是所有的心理醫生都會解夢
not all psychologists
care about dreams.

14
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:45,105
問題是你怎麼會在這裡, 為什麼會被指控
The question is how you got here
and why you've been charged.

15
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:48,412
你想知道什麼? 我快滿33歲了
What do you want to know?
I was about to turn 33.

16
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,011
擁有三家雜誌社和一家全球性的出版社
I ran three magazines
and a worldwide publishing house.

17
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:57,185
大部分日子裡我都愚昧的認為這一切都是永恆的
Most days I fooled myself into
believing it would last forever.

18
00:04:57,294 --> 00:04:59,922
年輕不都是這樣嗎?
Isn't that what being young
is about?

19
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,225
自以為你就是...
Believing secretly
that you would be...

20
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:05,199
歷史上唯一的那個...
the one person
in the history of man...

21
00:05:05,302 --> 00:05:07,133
長生不老的人
who would live forever.

22
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,004
你這麼早去哪兒?
Where you going so early?

23
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,874
別再往我的鬧鐘裡錄留言了, 好嗎?
Don't record any more messages
on my alarm clock, okay?

24
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:20,479
- 為什麼?
- 我會以為我們結婚了
- Why not?
- I'll start to think we're married.

25
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,848
別再提那個字眼, 我就不來這裡...
Don't ever say that word.
I will never come over...

26
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:25,444
給你帶雞湯, 又讓你欲仙欲死
and bring you chicken soup
and fuck your brains out again.

27
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:29,354
你感冒好了嗎?
How's your cold?

28
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:32,892
還沒, 你呢?
Still there.
How 'bout yours?

29
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:35,726
你真的讓我忘了自己在生病
You definitely took
my mind off it.

30
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,390
真的嗎?
Really?

31
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,158
Yes!
Yes!

32
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:49,202
我是茱莉
"Juliana" here.

33
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:52,976
嗨, 蕾娜, 我錯過試鏡了, 我一定是瘋了!
Hi, Rayna. I missed my audition.
I lost my head!

34
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:55,548
不, 聽著, 我得掛了
No, listen, I have to go.

35
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:57,119
我在大衛這兒
I'm with David.

36
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:03,916
你自便吧, 瑪麗亞會來清理, 你走前設定警鈴
Help yourself to whatever. Maria will
clean up. Set the alarm before you go.

37
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:06,495
還有...
And...

38
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:10,399
你是最棒的
you are the greatest.

39
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:12,595
拜拜，甜心
Bye, honey.

40
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:15,831
拜拜，甜心, 我額...再打給你
Bye, honey.
I'll call you later.

41
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:16,906
幾時?
When?

42
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:20,805
-幾時?
-很快!
- When?
- Soon!

43
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:07,085
你訂了球場沒有?
Did you reserve the court?

44
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,591
鎮定, 這種時候我應付不了這麼複雜的會談
Easy. I can't handle heavy
conversation at this ungodly hour.

45
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:14,061
抱歉這麼早做這些, 但我十點要打完
Sorry to do this early,
but I gotta be done by 10:00.

46
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:18,094
你八點四十五趕不到了, 是嗎?
You're not gonna make
the 8.:45, are you?

47
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,828
-你怎麼找到我的?
-大衛埃姆斯...
- How did you find me?
- David Aames...

48
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:22,769
你要決定新一期的封面顏色
you have to check the colors
for the new issue of Rise.

49
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:26,570
- 有什麼顏色?
- 黃, 紅或傳統的白色
- What are the colors?
- Yellow and red or traditional white.

50
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:31,177
- 我得想想看
- 大衛, 拜託
- Gotta think about it.
- David, please.

51
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,181
別遲到十點的董事會
Don't be late for the 10.:00
with the board.

52
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:36,047
好的, 但別告訴別人我在哪, 上帝打來我也不管
Don't tell anybody where I am.
I don't care if God calls.

53
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:39,054
- 我很忙, 非常忙
- Yeah
- I'm very, very busy.
- Yeah.

54
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,823
- 你就不能廢掉董事會嗎?
- 那七個小矮人? 不行
- Can't you get rid of that board?
- The Seven Dwarfs? No.

55
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,989
那些人快把你逼瘋了
Those people drive you nuts.

56
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,431
這是我老爸的意願, 他雇傭了他們
And that was the desire
of my father who hired them.

57
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:57,437
你又上了茱莉吉雅妮, 是嗎?
You fucked Julie Gianni again,
didn't you?

58
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:01,034
打電話時我就知道某人在
I know someone was there
when I called.

59
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:03,078
你還用那種語氣
You had that tone.

60
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,276
"沒啦，我感冒, 晚上想待在家."
"No, I got a cold.
I'm hanging in tonight, you know."

61
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:08,510
我真的感冒了
I had a cold.

62
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,411
- 只有我一個人
- 好吧.
- I was alone.
- Fine.

63
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:15,082
- 這輩子你愛怎樣就怎樣
- 謝謝.
- You do what you want with your life.
- Thanks.

64
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:18,059
但有一天你會知道真愛是什麼
But one day you'll know
what love truly is.

65
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,322
它夾雜著心酸和甜蜜
It's the sour and the sweet.

66
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,957
我嘗過心酸, 它讓我領會到甜蜜的滋味
I know sour, which allows me
to appreciate the sweet.

67
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:27,401
茱莉吉雅妮只是朋友
Julie Gianni is a friend.

68
00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:30,098
有時候我們一起上床
Sometimes we sleep together.

69
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:33,707
幹嘛? 幹嘛?
What? What?

70
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,643
- 幹嘛?
- 我的夢中情人...
- What?
- My dream girl...

71
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:38,942
茱莉吉雅妮...
Julie Gianni...

72
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,212
竟然是你的...炮友
is your fuck buddy.

73
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,153
- 你想聽什麼?
- 開慢點, 老兄
- What do you wanna listen to?
- Slow down, man.

74
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:48,486
有什麼聽的?
巴塞隆納...盧珀...
What do we got here?
Barcelona, Looper.

75
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:50,921
電臺司令?
Radiohead?

76
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:52,517
小心! 小心!
Look out! Look out!

77
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:00,496
操！
Fuck!

78
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:05,869
我們差點沒命
We almost died.

79
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:08,274
- 我知道
- 你們他媽的看著點!
- I know.
- Use your fuckin' head!

80
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:10,744
死亡就擺在我面前, 知道我看見什麼嗎?
My own death was in front of me,
and you know what happened?

81
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:13,315
你的一生從我眼前閃過
Your life flashed
before my eyes.

82
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:16,511
- 怎麼樣?
- 很值得為此死去
- How was it?
- Almost worth dying for.

83
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:20,850
我們到大門了, 正準備上去
We're at the front door.
We're coming up now.

84
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:23,221
- 早安，老闆, 睡得好吧?
- 是的, 很好
- Good morning, sir. Sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

85
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:24,313
- 吃早餐了嗎?
- 什麼?
- Eaten yet?
- What's that?

86
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:26,449
- 吃了嗎？
- 沒有
- Eaten yet?
- No.

87
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:30,029
- 早上好
- 大衛, 你居然跑去打壁球, 我替你拖了一個鐘頭
- Good morning.
- David, you were playing racquetball.
I've been covering you for an hour.

88
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,465
我救了你的命, 而你竟然去打球
I'm saving your ass
and you're playing racquetball.

89
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:33,661
謝謝你, 弗裡茨
Thank you, Fritz.

90
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,568
我們出電梯了, 董事會很不爽
We are now exiting the elevator.
The board is not happy.

91
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:39,039
- 早, 碧翠西
- 你好, 大衛
- Good morning, Beatrice.
- Hello, David.

92
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:41,736
你今天終於來了, 寇特妮想要你回復她的郵件
You're in the Post today. Courtney Love
called to see if you got her E-mail.

93
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:45,713
浮華世界主編想約你吃晚飯
And Graydon Carter and Shelley Wanger
called to see if dinner's still on.

94
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:48,649
- 不錯
- 美術部要你決定顏色...
- Cool.
- Art department needs the colors-

95
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:51,220
- 黃, 紅或白?
- 早上好, 大衛
- yellow and red or white?
- Good morning, David.

96
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:53,846
我有提到董事會對你遲到很生氣嗎?
And did I mention the board
is pissed you're late?

97
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:56,252
嗨, 大衛, 等一下!
Hey, David! Hold up!

98
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,451
哪一個?
Which one?

99
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:59,995
等等, 這個嗎? 大衛!
Wait. This one?
David!

100
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:02,257
好了, 他們都在等你
Okay, they're all waiting for you.

101
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:05,698
- 你換了髮型
- 是的. 大衛...
- You changed your hair.
- Yes. And David...

102
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:08,032
做好被批鬥的準備
opinions are expected.

103
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:21,310
你夢見過董事會...那七個你稱為小矮人的嗎?
Do you dream about the board-
the Seven Dwarfs as you call them?

104
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:23,409
噴嚏精, 害羞鬼...
Sneezy, Bashful...

105
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,578
瞌睡蟲...
Sleepy...

106
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:25,746
開心果...
Happy...

107
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:27,016
萬事通...
Doc...

108
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:28,283
糊塗蛋...
Dopey...

109
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:30,222
當然, 還有暴躁鬼
and of course, Grumpy.

110
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:31,851
艾斯本好玩嗎?
How was Aspen?

111
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:34,088
不錯
Good.

112
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:36,563
現在, 我要答案，馬上就要
Now, I want answers
and I want them now.

113
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:46,400
進展如何?
How's it going?

114
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,037
他們還把我當十一歲小孩
They still look at me
as if I was 11 years old.

115
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:52,046
他將繼承一切
He's going to inherit everything.

116
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:54,877
全都是他的
He gets it all.

117
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:57,313
你很怕你的夢, 不是嗎?
You're scared of your dreams,
aren't you?

118
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,320
無論怎樣這是一場噩夢
It's a nightmare either way.

119
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:01,447
這就是對你所發生的一切的解釋?
Is that how you explain
what's happened to you?

120
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:04,186
- 什麼?
- 你的臉怎麼了?
- What?
- What happened to your face?

121
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:08,226
- 我不再跟你談了
- 你不敢給我看你的臉?
- I'm not talking to you anymore.
- You don't wanna show me your face?

122
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:09,730
是的!
No!

123
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,405
- 你知道為什麼你會在這裡嗎?
- 聊天, 喝咖啡...
- Do you know why you're here?
- Conversation, the coffee-

124
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:19,737
大衛, 那些你來我往的交談...
David, the part where
we parry and joust...

125
00:11:19,843 --> 00:11:22,539
逐漸互相瞭解...
and get to know each other
bit by bit-

126
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:24,341
已經, 不管用了
No. No can do.

127
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:27,644
我們得跳過這些, 因為你已被控謀殺
We'll have to skip that because
you've been charged with murder.

128
00:11:28,685 --> 00:11:31,552
四周後, 法官會決定你的命運...
In four weeks, a judge
will determine your fate...

129
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,452
依據是我的診斷報告

Did I miss something here?

I'm all packed. I'm going
back to London and I understand.

你讓我做另外的律師工作, 這樣就不用開除我
You put me up for the other attorney's
job so you didn't have to fire me.

235
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,686
這很高明, 你老爸也會這麼做
That's a classy move and your father
would have done the same.

236
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,518
沒關係, 湯米

我越來越不稱職了

對他忠心耿耿

那些傢夥, 那7個矮人...
These guys, the Seven Dwarfs...

242
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:57,633
他們覺得你很幼稚
they think you're stupid-

243
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,833
是公司的絆腳石, 是搗亂的人
a corporate hazard,
a rogue.

244
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:02,537
他們正想辦法把你趕走, 大衛
They are gonna find a way
to get you out, David.

245
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:05,908
他們會逐步奪走你的公司, 你的生活...
They're lined up for your office,
your life...

246
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:07,414

247
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:09,542
他們處心積慮...
They're working day and night...

248
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:12,587
想搶走你51%的股權
to cheat you out
of your 51 % vote.

249
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:15,920
他們想賣掉這個文學的基業...
And they're gonna sell
this tradition of words...

250
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:19,153
這樣他們就可以為所欲為
so they can eat
in a better cafeteria.

251
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:22,123
但他們不知道的是
But what they don't know is this.

252
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,563
人們還會閱讀的!
People will read again!

253
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:28,665
我知道了
I got it.

254
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:33,174
他們甚至在你背後給你取外號
They even got a nickname for you
behind your back.

255
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:37,379
國民老二
Citizen Dildo.

256
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:40,512
你有了不起的天性...
You got great instincts...

257
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,608
但我要很誠摯的告訴你...
but I say this with complete love.

258
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,188
掌控你的人生...
Claim your life...

259
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:48,280
學會做一個混蛋
learn to be an asshole-

260
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:50,291
再說就多了
Two's enough.

261
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:54,024
對不起
Forgive me.

262
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,031
我對這家族仍有信心, 大衛...
I still believe
in this family, David...

263
00:18:57,133 --> 00:19:00,000
雖然只剩下你
even if it's only you.

264
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:01,627
送提普離開這裡
Get Tipp out of here.

265
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:03,968
帶他回家, 然後明早...
Drive him home,
and in the morning...

266
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:06,268
告訴他被重新雇傭, 加薪50%
tell him he's rehired
with a 50% raise.

267
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:09,311
給他個大辦公室, 就在7矮人的對面
Give him that big office across
the hall from the Seven Dwarfs.

268
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:11,312
再安排和律師團的一個會議
And set up a meeting
with the other attorneys.

269
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:13,939
我明天會早一點
I'm gonna be in early tomorrow.

270
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,518
比平常早
Well, earlier than usual.

271
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:29,789
你好, 帥哥
Hello, handsome.

272
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,393
我來祝你生日快樂
I've come to wish you
a happy birthday.

273
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,697
噢, 天哪
Oh, man.

274
00:19:36,906 --> 00:19:39,067
我沒邀請你, 茱莉
I didn't invite you,Julie.

275
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:41,905
- 這真有點奇怪
- 派對就是這樣
- That was a little weird.
- That's how it works with parties-

276
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:44,377
你得要被邀請
you have to be invited.

277
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:50,985
我在生你氣, 爛人
I'm mad at you, you dick.

278
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:53,647
那晚我們做了四次
We made love four times
the other night.

279
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:58,824
- 很棒嗎?
- 二次很棒
- Is that good?
- Two's good.

280
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:01,260
三次非常棒
Three is very good.

281
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:04,492
- 但四次...
- 四次超級棒?
- But four-
- Four's pretty good?

282
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,500
四次...
Four is-

283
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:13,140
四次怎樣?
Four is what?

284
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:17,510
抱抱我, 然後我就走
Hold me, and then I'll leave.

285
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:20,605
你就可以回去找那個可愛的褐發美女聊天
And you can go back and talk
to that cute brunette.

286
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:22,115
四次怎樣?
Four is what?

287
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:26,450
我不想見你那些高貴的朋友, 我以前也高貴的時候就知道他們
I don't wanna meet your fancy friends.
I knew them when I was fancy too.

288
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:29,755
四次怎樣?
Four is what?

289
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,418
她看起來像只飛蛾, 大衛
She looks like a moth, David.

290
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,429
飛蛾?
A moth?

291
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:38,523
有時候我真擔心你, 那些聰明的女孩...
Sometimes I worry about you,
that some clever girl...

292
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:42,570
穿著愚蠢的大衣就這麼出現, 把你耍得團團轉
in a big silly coat is gonna come
along and play you just right.

293
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,435
然後我就會失去我的朋友
Then I'll lose my friend.

294
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,907
我們就再沒有熬雞湯的聚會了
And there won't be any chicken soup
parties for me and you.

295
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:03,312
好吧
Okay.

296
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:07,160
壞人
Bad.

297
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,963
幾時再打給我? 別說"很快"
When will you call me?
Don't say "soon."

298
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,732
我討厭你說"很快"
I hate it when you say "soon."

299
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:21,704
丹尼布拉姆森在去年生日給他的
Danny Bramson gave him that
for his birthday last year.

300
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:24,075
這就是搖滾樂的下場...
So this is what's become
of rock and roll-

301
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,413
一把砸碎的吉它掛在有錢人家裡的玻璃櫃裡
a smashed guitar behind a glass case
displayed on some rich guy's wall.

302
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,851
這是個禮物, 實際上
It was a gift, actually.

303
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,787
- 我喜歡
- 喔, 喔, 喔
- I like it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

304
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,794
你怎麼會有所有這些東西...
So how did you
get all this stuff-

305
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:41,693
這樣的公寓, 這樣的生活?
this apartment, this life?

306
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:47,860
我明白了
I see.

307
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:57,574
幫我一下怎樣, 沒打擾你的話
How 'bout if you help me,
unless I'm horning in here.

308
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,548
- 你的確打擾了, 但食物很好
- 我有麻煩, 有個人在暗戀我
- You are, but the food's good.
- I have a problem. I got a stalker.

309
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:03,983
聽起來生活不會變糟
It doesn't sound life threatening.

310
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:07,180
我想你假裝我們正在愉快的交談...
I need for you to pretend we are
having a scintillating conversation...

311
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,690
而你感到非常享受
and you are wildly entertained.

312
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:12,056
- 我知道這很難辦
- 我會配合的
- I know it's tough.
- I'll improvise.

313
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:15,790
她在屋子另一邊正盯我的背看, 是嗎?
She's across the room and burning
a hole in my back now, isn't she?

314
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:17,957
紅禮服, 系帶鞋?
Red dress, strappy shoes?

315
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:21,929
哇, 她真的在盯著你
Wow. She's really staring at you.

316
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:28,908
- 該死
- 她看起來快哭了
- Shit.
- And she seems to be crying.

317
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:31,070
很不開心
Less happy.

318
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:35,779
我想她是最傷心的女孩, 一直拿著杯馬提尼
I think she's the saddest girl
to ever hold a martini.

319
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:41,844
布萊恩.謝比
Brian Shelby.

320
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:44,520
- 珍妮佛.凱利
- 嗨, 珍妮佛
- Jennifer Kelly.
- Hi,Jennifer.

321
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,252
- 你還有另一個公寓
- 算是辦公室, 來吧
- You have another apartment.
- Sort of a day office. Come on.

322
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:55,537
- 我不要進去
- 好吧, 晚安
- I am not going in there.
- I am. Good night.

323
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:24,828
- 我聽到她來了
- 真的?
- I hear her coming.
- Really?

324
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,455
假的
No.

325
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,280
布萊恩
Brian.

326
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,104
- 嗨
- 你好嗎?
- Hi.
- How are you?

327
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:43,541
我們安全了, 但我沒東西喝
We're safe, but I've got
nothing to drink.

328
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:45,746
這些是誰畫的?
Who did these paintings?

329
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:48,790
這是瓊尼.蜜雪兒
This is Joni Mitchell.

330
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,859
這個是莫內
This one is Monet.

331
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,292
這一個是...
And this one...

332
00:23:53,396 --> 00:23:54,988
我做的
was done by me.

333
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:56,394
是個雪板
It is a snowboard.

334
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:59,559
那麼, 只有兩個是天才
Well, two of them are geniuses.

335
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:03,538
那是真跡
That is the real thing.

336
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:06,199
他用畫筆描繪了這片香草的天空
His paintbrush painted
the vanilla sky.

337
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:08,937
這是...帆布的
And his canvas.

338
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:11,240
是我母親的
My mother's.

339
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:21,117
- 我很好奇你會感到意外
- 我真無話可說了
- I'm surprised you're surprised.
- I can't keep this banter going.

340
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:24,056
- 我也是
- 逮到你們了
- Me neither.
- I caught you.

341
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,822
布萊恩, 來這兒
Brian, come in here.

342
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:29,261
- 怎麼樣?
- 你的朋友很有意思, 我也醉了
- What's going on?
- Your friends are fun and I'm drunk.

343
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:31,925
- 茱莉吉雅妮在跟蹤我
- 她看起來很危險
- Julie Gianni is stalking me.
- She looked dangerous.

344
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:35,094
沒人跟蹤我, 我只好喝酒
Nobody stalks me,
so I drink.

345
00:24:35,204 --> 00:24:38,970
- 這都沒酒了
- 喝我的傑克丹尼(威士卡)加可樂吧
- We're all out up here.
- Finish my Jack and Coke.

346
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:40,633
- 愚蠢的玻璃杯
- 我來
- Stupid glass.
- I got it.

347
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:44,008
- 不, 是拿著它的人蠢
- 別擔心, 沒什麼大不了的
- No. It's the stupid guy holding it.
- Don't worry. No big deal.

348
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:46,547
我去弄些東西來, 傑克加可樂?
I'll go get us something.
Jacks and Cokes?

349
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:48,879
我最好識相點,我喝太多了,還他媽的沒吃東西
I better hit it. I drank
too much and I didn't fuckin' eat.

350
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:50,975
- 派對才剛開始
- 對你而言
- The party's just starting.
- For you it is.

351
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:52,987
你不能走, 你是我的貴賓
You cannot go.
You are my guest of honor.

352
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:54,181
去你的, 大衛
Fuck you, David.

353
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,191
你給我錢寫小說, 你是老大
You're paying me to write my novel,
so you own me.

354
00:24:57,293 --> 00:25:00,319
我不是,你才華橫溢,又好看,又瀟灑
I don't own you. You are brilliant,
good-looking, handsome.

355
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,989
但你為什麼非得勾引索菲亞?
But why'd you have to hit
on Sofia?

356
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:08,427
- 我沒勾引她
- 算了, 隨你怎麼說
- I wasn't hitting on Sofia.
- Fine. Whatever you say.

357
00:25:08,537 --> 00:25:11,131
- 我瘋了, 我瞎了眼
- 你沒有
- I'm crazy. I'm blind.
- You're not blind.

358
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,199
你喝了傑克丹尼, 當你喝了傑克你就會開始變成...
You're drinking Jack Daniels and when
you drink jack you start in with that...

359
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:17,472
弗蘭克.辛納屈(音樂人)-- 她傷了我的心...
Frank Sinatra,
she shot me down...

360
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,343
給我根香煙. 最傷心的人
give me a cigarette
king of sad thing.

361
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:22,246
- 沒錯, 給我根香煙
- 我去找根
- That I do. Give me a cigarette.
- I'll find one.

362
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:26,583
等等,你很有錢女人都愛你,而我是來自俄亥俄的(意指鄉巴佬)醉鬼
Wait. You're rich and women love
you and I'm from Ohio and drunk.

363
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:29,249
- 我可以告訴你實話嗎?
- 任何人都可以
- Can I tell you the truth?
- Everybody does.

364
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:30,791
我喜歡她
I dig her.

365
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:34,090
之前我從沒和你提過這個,包括任何女孩...
And I've never said this to you
before about any girl...

366
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:37,654
但她很可能...很可能...很可能就是
but she could be-
could be- could be-

367
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:40,565
就是我那個他媽的夢中女孩
could be the girl
of my fucking dreams.

368
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:43,035
- 你不是鄉下來的
- 我知道
- You're not from Ohio.
- I know.

369
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:46,472
但如果她會毀了我們的友誼, 那她可以去死了
But if she fucks up our friendship,
she can go to hell.

370
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:49,476
我不允許這種情況發生, 我們是哥們
I won't allow it.
We are bros.

371
00:25:49,578 --> 00:25:51,978
- 我也是這麼覺得
- 你當然是
- I feel the same way.
- Sure you do.

372
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:54,379
- 嗨
- 你好嗎?
- Hi.
- How you doing?

373
00:25:56,986 --> 00:25:58,783
- 謝謝
- 別客氣
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

374
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:00,879
你要去哪?
Where are you going?

375
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,426
我是弗蘭克(電燈泡),弗蘭克必須走
I am Frank,
and Frank must go.

376
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:08,688
- 什麼?
- 我祝你們今晚愉快
- What?
- I good you bid evening.

377
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:10,459
等等, 我和你一起走
Wait. I'll go with you.

378
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:14,562
- 留下來, 親愛的
- 晚點我會載你回家的
- Stay, baby.
- I'll give you a ride home later.

379
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,662
- 不, 明天我得上班
- 你...
- No, I have to work tomorrow.
- You-

380
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:20,700
你會得到很好的照顧的
You are in great hands.

381
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,041
我的話只是為了安慰自己
I'm just humoring myself
that my opinion matters.

382
00:26:30,152 --> 00:26:33,679
你永遠體會不到那種深深的痛苦...
You will never know
the exquisite pain...

383
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:36,917
一個人獨自回家...
of the guy who goes home alone...

384
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:41,520
因為沒有這痛苦, 親愛的, 那就無所謂甜蜜
because without the bitter, baby,
the sweet ain't as sweet.

385
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:44,898
玩的愉快
Have a good time.

386
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:50,604
又是這套心酸和甜蜜
The sweet and sour speech again.

387
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:06,044
- 為什麼你有懼高症?
- 很多人都有
- Why are you scared of heights?
- Many people are scared of heights.

388
00:27:06,155 --> 00:27:08,316
我不是怕高, 而是感到困擾
It's not the height
that bothers me.

389
00:27:08,424 --> 00:27:11,359
是那種壓力在威脅著我
It's the impact
that terrifies me.

390
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,692
我不會待太久
I won't stay long.

391
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:21,360
嘿, 保羅
Hey, Paolo.

392
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:24,664
你好
Hello.

393
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,934
我得帶你去散步
I have to take you for a walk.

394
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:30,944
幸好有它保護著你, 它是個猛犬
I'm glad he protects you.
He's a lethal canine.

395
00:27:31,046 --> 00:27:34,709
我喜歡住這裡, 我也懶得打掃
I love living here,
and I refuse to clean up.

396
00:27:34,817 --> 00:27:36,216
沒事
No problem.

397
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:39,685
我得拼命打工才住的起這裡
I have to work around the clock
to keep this place.

398
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:43,383
- 你真的是個舞蹈家
- 十四年了
- You really are a dancer.
- For 14 years.

399
00:27:43,492 --> 00:27:46,461
但我可不會跳得像你那樣
But I don't dance like you dance.

400
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:49,562
想喝什麼嗎?
Do you want something to drink?

401
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:51,633
好的
Sure.

402
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:57,601
嘿, 真乖, 乖孩子
Hey, beautiful, beautiful boy.

403
00:27:58,007 --> 00:28:00,737
晚餐想吃什麼?
What do you want
for dinner tonight?

404
00:28:00,843 --> 00:28:02,401
想吃炸雞嗎?
Do you want fried chicken?

405
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:13,813
我喜歡你的生活
I like your life.

406
00:28:13,923 --> 00:28:16,756
好吧, 這是我的, 你不能擁有它
Well, it's mine
and you can't have it.

407
00:28:19,428 --> 00:28:22,556
我不想知道這照片背後的故事
I don't wanna know the story
behind this photo.

408
00:28:22,665 --> 00:28:26,465
- 誰是塞爾吉奧?
- 這是個綽號
- Who's Sergio?
- It's a nickname.

409
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:29,504
- 你外號叫塞爾吉奧?
- 說來話長
- Your nickname is Sergio?
- It's a long story.

410
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:32,802
我們互相都還不熟
And we don't know each other.

411
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:35,809
- 這麼多秘密啊
- 因為我是個軍火商(在調侃大衛的姓氏)
- So many secrets.
- That's because I'm an arms dealer.

412
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:38,311
- 我從沒認識過軍火商
- 現在認識了
- I've never known an arms dealer.
- You do now.

413
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:42,274
那你呢?
你的綽號是什麼?
What about you?
What's your nickname?

414
00:28:47,957 --> 00:28:49,982
國民老二
Citizen Dildo.

415
00:28:53,095 --> 00:28:54,756
你不能在這呆一晚上
You are not staying over.

416
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:02,270
別做老闆, 做個藝術家, 或者軍火商
Never run a company. Stay an artist.
Stay an arms dealer.

417
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:05,898
拜託, 不知為何我無法同情你
Oh, please. Somehow
I can't play the violin for you.

418
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:10,001
雖然, 能影響那麼多人的生活一定很困難
Although, it must be difficult
controlling all those people's lives.

419
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:16,881
派對上每個和你有聯繫的人某種程度上都靠你吃飯
Everyone at that party is connected
to you for survival in some way.

420
00:29:16,986 --> 00:29:18,044
看起來
It seems.

421
00:29:21,924 --> 00:29:23,824
結過婚嗎?
Ever been married?

422
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:30,227
沒有,你曾經接受過一萬兩千個男人的求婚?
Did you ever accept any
of your 12,000 proposals?

423
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:32,823
一萬兩千零八個. 沒有
Twelve thousand and eight. No.

424
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:36,098
然後你搬到紐約來跳舞,畫畫, 表演和賣軍火?
And you moved to New York to dance,
paint, act and deal arms?

425
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:38,602
是的
Right.

426
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:41,870
你想聽傑夫.巴克利還是維姬.卡爾?
Do you wanna hear Jeff Buckley
or Vicki Carr?

427
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:43,740
傑夫.巴克利還是維姬.卡爾?
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?

428
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:47,012
一起聽
Both simultaneously.

429
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:52,051
每個人都說,"別到紐約"
Everyone said,
"Don't go to New York."

430
00:29:52,154 --> 00:29:54,247
我只是覺得好事總會發生...
I just think good things
will happen...

431
00:29:54,356 --> 00:29:57,018
如果你是好人有好的心態的話
if you're a good person
with a good attitude.

432
00:29:57,126 --> 00:29:58,491
你不覺得嗎?
Don't you think?

433
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:03,999
你覺得我很天真嗎?
You think I'm naive?

434
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:07,125
不, 絕對沒有
No. I really don't.

435
00:30:07,236 --> 00:30:09,329
我真的喜歡上她了
I dug her completely.

436
00:30:10,305 --> 00:30:14,901
忽然間...我發現了紐約最後一個單純的女孩
Somehow I'd found the last
semi-guyless girl in New York City.

437
00:30:15,844 --> 00:30:18,404
我得睡覺了
I have to get to sleep.

438
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:22,644
說實話, 白天我還有個工作是牙醫助理
Truthfully, I also work mornings
as a dental assistant.

439
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,684
天哪, 我都找錯牙醫了
Boy, am I going
to the wrong dentist.

440
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:31,050
而你都沒有馬上就想和她上床?
And you didn't immediately
wanna sleep with her?

441
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,789
額, 你知道, 我是個延遲享樂者
Well, you know,
I'm a pleasure delayer.

442
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:39,795
- 那是什麼意思?
- 延遲享樂者?
- How does that work?
- Pleasure delayer?

443
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:42,462
你不知道?
You don't know?

444
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:45,165
你保持和一個人順其自然的交往...
You keep a relationship casual...

445
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:48,209
直到一個絕佳的機會
until the absolute breaking point.

446
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:53,541
然後在一個晚上..或中午...或早上...
And then one evening
or afternoon or morning-

447
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:56,209
那得花上好幾個月
it could be months from now.

448
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,150
你知道這是怎麼一回事
You know how it works.

449
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:03,219
不, 說實話不知道
No, actually I don't.

450
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:06,351
我結婚22年了
I've been married for 22 years.

451
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:08,657
你還要和女兒吃飯
You've got dinner
with your daughters.

452
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:12,122
沒錯, 我知道
That's right, I do.

453
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:15,362
那時我有各種招數對付女人...
Back then I had intricate systems
with women...

454
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:17,098
你不會相信
you wouldn't believe.

455
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:21,905
比如?
Like what?

456
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:28,605
嘿, 醫生, 別再為不是單身而難過了...
Hey, Doc, don't get melancholy over
the 30 seconds you were single...

457
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:30,878
很久以前的了
a long time ago.

458
00:31:30,986 --> 00:31:33,853
- 你覺得我是這樣嗎?
- 是的
- That's what you think I'm doing?
- Oh, yes.

459
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:36,620
你也許是對的
You might be right.

460
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:41,093
我們繼續吧, 時間不等人
Let's continue.
Time is not our friend.

461
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:16,322
只限於缺點, 我們只能畫這些
Just our shortcomings,
that's all we're allowed to draw.

462
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,501
我從來沒畫得這麼像過
I've never drawn such
a true likeness before.

463
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:26,270
我畫好了
Mine's finished.

464
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,774
這麼快?
Already?

465
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:35,481
好了
Done.

466
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:42,380
- 你是這麼看我的嗎?
- 也許錢畫得還不夠多
- That's how you see me?
- Maybe I didn't add enough money.

467
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:46,188
不, 你簡直畫得入木三分
No, something you'd see on a wall
in a steak house in hell.

468
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:48,388
太棒了, 簽名吧
It's wonderful.
Sign it.

469
00:32:54,903 --> 00:32:56,632
讓我看你的
Let's see yours.

470
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,493
不
No.

471
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:00,335
把它給我
Give me that.

472
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:15,423
我很內疚
I feel bad.

473
00:33:15,524 --> 00:33:17,685
你說要畫滑稽的
You said to draw a caricature.

474
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:20,625
我知道, 但沒辦法
I know. I couldn't.

475
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:22,924
我看見你就是這樣的
I saw you like that.

476
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:28,068
畫得很好
It's very good.

477
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:32,469
我要賣給你
I'll sell it to you.

478
00:33:32,574 --> 00:33:35,338
你這壞人
You monster.

479
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:36,604
這多少錢?
How much for it?

480
00:33:39,615 --> 00:33:41,378
一個吻
One kiss.

481
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:49,580
這笑容太令我陶醉了
That smile is gonna be
the end of me.

482
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,620
明天你朋友打給你怎麼辦?
And what happens when
your friend calls you tomorrow?

483
00:33:57,566 --> 00:34:01,161
他只比我早遇見你幾個鐘頭, 他也會這麼做的
He just met you a few hours
before me. He'd do the same.

484
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,932
我覺得友情對你很重要
I see that friendship
is important to you.

485
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,904
沒錯, 是的
It is. It is.

486
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:09,876
我是他最好的朋友...
And as his best friend...

487
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:14,278
我知道他正準備完成一部關於缺憾和拒絕的小說
I know he's trying to finish a novel
about inadequacy and rejection.

488
00:34:14,383 --> 00:34:17,443
所以我在這呆的越久,對他的前途就越好
So the longer that I stay,
the better it is for his career.

489
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:22,557
你的前途才是我擔心的
Your career is the one
I'd worry about.

490
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:30,791
對不起
Sorry.

491
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:34,702
不, 不, 其實你說得沒錯
No. No, you're more right
than you even know.

492
00:34:36,305 --> 00:34:39,240
我曾經是那種傢夥...
I used to be one of those guys
that just...

493
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:43,067
雪板就是他的生活...
snowboarded through his life...

494
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:45,237
沒有目標...
with no focus...

495
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:47,972
完全沒有
whatsoever.

496
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,983
你幾時改變的?
When did you change?

497
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:52,076
大概五分鐘前
About five minutes ago.

498
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:57,019
每一分鐘都有可能會改變你的生活
Every passing minute is another
chance to turn it all around.

499
00:35:03,732 --> 00:35:07,725
對於那些認為你是個騙子的人?
And to those who think
that you're a charlatan?

500
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:09,269
我知道
I understand.

501
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:11,839
這種觀點是把人冷凍起來...
The perception of a head
frozen somewhere...

502
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,500
等待復蘇, 聽起來像科幻小說
waiting for reanimation
sounds like science fiction.

503
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:17,874
- 你在看什麼?
- 最棒的節目
- What are you watching?
- It's the greatest show.

504
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,540
叫做索菲亞
It's called Sofia.

505
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:22,742
這是新科技的最前沿
It is at the frontier
of a new science.

506
00:35:22,851 --> 00:35:24,375
生命延續
Life Extension.

507
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:27,951
你如何實現這樣的構想呢?
How do you accomplish
such a thing?

508
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:30,752
我看過這個30遍了
I've seen this 30 times.

509
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:32,690
生命充滿了意外
Life is full of surprises.

510
00:35:32,794 --> 00:35:37,527
但最大的意外就是生命不是非得終結
But the greatest surprise of all is
that this doesn't have to end ever.

511
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:40,430
我們報導過他, 他擁有半個亞利桑那州
We did a story on this guy.
He owns half of Arizona.

512
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:43,698
- 他是騙子嗎?
- 誰知道呢?
- Is he a fraud?
- How would you ever know?

513
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:45,033
說得好
Good point.

514
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,268
你能把人解凍嗎?
Can you unfreeze a human life?

515
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:51,175
以小狗班尼為例, 班尼是只小狗
Take the case of Benny the dog.
Benny's a dog.

516
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:55,477
它被冷凍了三個月然後被解凍了, 過上正常的生活
He was frozen for three months and
thawed out to live a normal life.

517
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:57,950
令人欣慰嗎?
That's comforting?

518
00:35:58,053 --> 00:36:01,284
班尼沒事了
我也要生命延續
It's safe for Benny.
I'm in.

519
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:17,728
我們最好慢慢來
We'd better watch out.

520
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:22,902
雷蒙德.圖利,生命延續的創始人
Raymond Tooley,
creator of Life Extension.

521
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:26,378
書名是 生命:續集
The book is Life: The Sequel.

522
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:37,547
- 你要去哪?
- 我留了號碼在你冰箱上
- Where are you going?
- I left my number on your fridge.

523
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:40,620
過來, 我想告訴你個秘密
Come here.
I want to tell you a secret.

524
00:37:02,484 --> 00:37:05,180
我本來是要親你的額頭
I meant that to be your forehead.

525
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:12,453
謝謝你心有靈犀
Thank you for the inspiration.

526
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:17,595
現在我要嘗試以仁慈之心去經營我的公司...
I will now attempt to run
my company showing compassion...

527
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:19,690
接納我那幾個搭檔的抱怨...
for the seething throng
of my partners...

528
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:23,464
他們誠心想把我搞垮...
who root quietly for me to fail.

529
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:26,439
還有那些背地裡你不知道的東西
And for things you don't even know.

530
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:27,701
謝謝
Thank you.

531
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,343
我要去上班了, 我還有間公司要經營呢
I'm gonna go to work.
I have a company to run.

532
00:37:36,251 --> 00:37:38,219
延遲享樂者
Pleasure delayer.

533
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:15,910
大衛.埃姆斯
David Aames.

534
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:18,448
茱莉.吉雅妮
Julie Gianni.

535
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:20,992
嘿, 帥哥
Hey, handsome.

536
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:22,654
你在跟蹤我
You're following me.

537
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:25,498
有點算是吧
Just a little bit.

538
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,830
我想完成我們那天的對話
I wanted to finish
what we were talking about.

539
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:28,834
然後呢?
And?

540
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:34,932
和我們的飛蛾女孩相處得怎樣了? 她有為你蛻變成蝴蝶嗎?
How did it go with our moth girl?
She turn into a butterfly for you?

541
00:38:36,645 --> 00:38:38,203
是的, 她有
Yes, she did.

542
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:41,546
她有
She did.

543
00:38:43,852 --> 00:38:46,548
看得出來就憑你走路的樣子, 你沒和她上床
I can tell by the way you were
walking you didn't sleep with her.

544
00:38:49,124 --> 00:38:52,651
讓我猜猜, 你沒和她上床是因為...
Let me guess. You haven't slept
with her because...

545
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:55,423
越是觸手可及就越刺激
it's more fun
when you can draw it out.

546
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,465
性會變得沒意思, 如果一個女人不再告訴她的朋友...
Sex just isn't as good if a woman
hasn't told her friends...

547
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:00,296
她從來沒和你上過床的話
she'd never sleep with you.

548
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,637
非常正確, 茱莉
Right on the money,Julie.

549
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:07,936
她一定整晚想你想到發瘋
She must be exhausted from trying
to be witty for you all night.

550
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:09,374
嘿, 茱莉
Hey,Julie.

551
00:39:11,112 --> 00:39:12,409
對不起
Sorry.

552
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:15,175
沒事
It's okay.

553
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:18,775
你似乎從來都不會珍惜直到快要失去朋友
You never seem to be there for your
friends until they've given up on you.

554
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:28,126
我沒有不理你, 我只是...
I'm not blowing you off.
I just-

555
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,165
我有點想一個人靜靜, 相信我
I wanna be alone
for a little bit. Trust me.

556
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:33,826
我有很多事, 必須要處理
I have a lot of things
I have to take care of.

557
00:39:33,935 --> 00:39:36,665
如果我們是朋友, 我們的確是...
And if we're friends,
which we are...

558
00:39:36,771 --> 00:39:40,036
對吧, 那麼你應該會理解
okay, then
you'll understand that.

559
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:43,269
對不起, 我有點怪怪的
I'm sorry.
I got weird.

560
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:48,379
我錯過了試鏡, 而且...
I missed an audition and...

561
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:51,247
那讓我很難過,你沒有邀請我參加派對
it just made me feel bad you
didn't invite me to your party.

562
00:39:57,225 --> 00:39:59,819
你要補償我嗎?
You wanna make it up to me?

563
00:39:59,928 --> 00:40:02,055
我不會告訴別人的
I won't tell a soul.

564
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:24,113
你會報導我嗎,如果我出了一張唱片?
Would you do a story on me
if I made a CD?

565
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:26,449
當然我會的
Sure I would.

566
00:40:33,395 --> 00:40:34,987
你喜歡我的音樂嗎?
Do you like my music?

567
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:38,999
很有活力
It's vivid.

568
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:46,274
要是我的話我也會買一張給自己
Well, if I weren't me,
I would buy a CD by me.

569
00:40:46,374 --> 00:40:49,241
你知道, 只要有一個人欣賞你...
Well, you know,
if you can reach one person-

570
00:40:51,346 --> 00:40:52,745
哇
Wow.

571
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:01,987
幸福對你來說是什麼, 大衛?
What's happiness to you, David?

572
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,320
幸福對我來說?
What's happiness to me?

573
00:41:06,394 --> 00:41:08,885
- 幸福是什麼...
- 對我來說...
- What is happiness-
- 'Cause for me...

574
00:41:10,532 --> 00:41:12,762
這就是幸福
this is happiness-

575
00:41:12,867 --> 00:41:15,495
就是和你在一起
just being with you.

576
00:41:20,241 --> 00:41:22,368
就是有一件事很困擾我
There's one thing
that bothers me.

577
00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:27,642
為什麼你和布萊恩說我是你的炮友?
Why did you tell Brian
that I was your fuck buddy?

578
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:32,048
我沒告訴他, 我沒那麼說過
I didn't tell him that.
I didn't say that.

579
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:37,549
- 你什麼時候不再關心了, 大衛?
- 關心什麼?
- When did you stop caring, David?
- Caring about what?

580
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:41,026
那些你許下的承諾的後果
About the consequences of
the promises that you've made.

581
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:44,030
- 承諾?
- 是的, 承諾
- Promises?
- Yeah, the promises.

582
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,392
我以為...
I thought-

583
00:41:48,803 --> 00:41:51,271
操啊, 你在說什麼啊?
Get the fuck-
What are you talking about?

584
00:41:51,373 --> 00:41:54,433
你知道假裝是你好友有多難嗎?
Do you understand how hard it is
to pretend to be your buddy?

585
00:41:55,777 --> 00:41:57,369
大衛, 我愛你
David, I love you.

586
00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:00,810
我他媽的愛你!
I fucking love you!

587
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:03,483
我他媽的愛你!
I fucking love you!

588
00:42:03,585 --> 00:42:04,552
操!
Fuck!

589
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:06,711
哇, 哇, 哇!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

590
00:42:07,455 --> 00:42:09,787
別這樣, 別這樣
Don't do this.
Don't do this.

591
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:12,121
那晚我們做了四次
You fucked me four times
the other night.

592
00:42:12,227 --> 00:42:14,787
你進入我的身體
You've been inside me.

593
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:17,763
我為你口交, 那是有意義的
I swallowed your cum.
That means something.

594
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:21,836
開慢點
Slow down.

595
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:25,667
四次, 那是有意義的
Four times- it means something.

596
00:42:25,774 --> 00:42:27,674
- 四次
- 停車
- Four times.
- Stop the car.

597
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:30,939
每天, 我過著期盼的生活...
Twenty-four hours a day, I live
with this aching possibility...

598
00:42:31,045 --> 00:42:33,536
你也許會打電話叫我去做些什麼
that you might call me
to do something.

599
00:42:33,648 --> 00:42:36,208
我們去你家吧, 我想看你住的地方
Let's go to your house.
I wanna see where you live.

600
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:40,352
快開慢點, 我要你停車!
Just slow down.
I want you to stop the car!

601
00:42:40,455 --> 00:42:42,514
你知道當你和一個人上床...
Don't you know when you sleep
with someone...

602
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:46,025
你的身體就許下了承諾, 不管你想不想
your body makes a promise
whether you do or not?

603
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,927
告訴我, 大衛, 你信上帝嗎?
Tell me something, David.
Do you believe in God?

604
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:58,934
你要做什麼?
What are you doing?

605
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:02,207
好吧, 我愛你, 我愛你
Okay, I love you.
I love you.

606
00:43:10,752 --> 00:43:11,946
別亂來!
Don't do it!

607
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:06,193
你好
hello.

608
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:08,672
你真美
You're amazing.

609
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,198
- Hola
- Hola
- Hola.
- Hola.

610
00:44:11,446 --> 00:44:13,476
你已經沒事去上班了?
Did you get to work all right?

611
00:44:16,818 --> 00:44:21,414
不, 實際上, 我做了一場噩夢
No, actually,
I had a horrible dream.

612
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:24,014
夢見你再也見不到我了
You dreamed you'd never
see me again.

613
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:26,821
我離開了你的公寓之後, 下樓去取車...
I left your apartment,
I went downstairs to the car...

614
00:44:26,928 --> 00:44:30,694
然後我的朋友, 那個暗戀者, 跟蹤我到那
and my friend, the stalker,
had followed me there.

615
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:32,319
茱莉
Julie.

616
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,262
是的, 然後她想和我談談
Yes. And she wanted
to talk to me.

617
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,568
但我記得我腦子裡都是那些細語, 你知道...
And I remember I had this buzz,
you know...

618
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:42,370
那是來自我們的交談
that buzz from you and me.

619
00:44:42,477 --> 00:44:47,346
我想我的意識還停留在我那幅滑稽的肖像上
I think my mind was still on
that terrible drawing of me.

620
00:44:49,551 --> 00:44:52,281
但她覺得很心煩...
But she was upset...

621
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:55,317
嗯...是關於...我不知道
about- I don't know.

622
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,948
我上了她的車然後...
I got in the car and...

623
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:00,994
她開車沖到橋下...
she drove off a bridge...

624
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:04,531
連我帶車一起自殺
and committed suicide
with me in the car.

625
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:07,658
我以為你直接就去上班了
I thought you were going
straight to work.

626
00:45:11,439 --> 00:45:12,997
但我活了下來...
But I survived...

627
00:45:14,108 --> 00:45:18,238
我的臉和手都...
with my arm and my face...

628
00:45:19,747 --> 00:45:21,738
毀了
reconstructed.

629
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:24,511
更糟的是...
And what's worse...

630
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:28,020
我沒法醒過來
is that I can't wake up.

631
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:56,714
你家裡怎樣了...派對之後
And how was your house
after the party?

632
00:45:58,553 --> 00:45:59,952
派對?
Party?

633
00:46:01,522 --> 00:46:02,921
什麼派對?
What party?

634
00:46:03,024 --> 00:46:04,582
就是那個派對啊
The party.

635
00:46:07,762 --> 00:46:08,820
記得嗎?
Remember?

636
00:46:10,164 --> 00:46:12,598
紅禮服, 系帶鞋
Red dress, strappy shoes.

637
00:46:14,435 --> 00:46:18,235
我把東西灑在你的襯衫上
I spilled something
on your shirt.

638
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:20,239
甜蜜和心酸
Sweet and sour.

639
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:25,338
一直拿著馬提尼的傷心女孩
And the saddest girl
to ever hold a martini.

640
00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:50,667
我的夢是一個殘酷的玩笑
My dreams are a cruel joke.

641
00:46:53,574 --> 00:46:55,474
它們嘲諷我
They taunt me.

642
00:47:03,384 --> 00:47:05,716
即使在夢裡, 我也是個傻瓜...
Even in my dreams,
I'm an idiot...

643
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,550
知道自己就快要醒來面對現實
who knows he's about
to wake up to reality.

644
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:14,320
如果我可以不睡的話...
If I could only avoid sleep.

645
00:47:16,264 --> 00:47:18,323
但我做不到
But I can't.

646
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:20,958
我試著告訴自己做其他的夢
I try to tell myself
what to dream.

647
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,866
我嘗試夢到自己在飛
I try to dream that I'm flying.

648
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:26,564
做些自由的事
Something free.

649
00:47:29,744 --> 00:47:30,972
但沒有用
It never works.

650
00:47:38,086 --> 00:47:41,021
那就是你唯一夢到的事?
Is that the only thing you dream?

651
00:47:43,491 --> 00:47:45,755
我不...不記得了
I don't- I don't remember.

652
00:47:51,132 --> 00:47:53,157
你夢到那場車禍了嗎?
Do you dream about
the car accident?

653
00:47:54,836 --> 00:47:57,600
這就是你在昏迷中的記憶...
Here's what you remember
from a coma.

654
00:47:58,406 --> 00:47:59,805
...一片空白
Nothing.

655
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:05,372
接下來發生了什麼?
What happened next?

656
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,278
到底發生了什麼?
What really happened?

657
00:48:08,382 --> 00:48:12,284
什麼, 你沒看檔案嗎?
What, didn't you read
the file?

658
00:48:12,386 --> 00:48:14,354
我昏迷了三個半星期
I was out for
three-and-a-half weeks.

659
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:18,414
我的臉和手臂都破碎了, 下頜有四處骨折
My face and my arm shattered and
my jaw was broken in four places.

660
00:48:19,627 --> 00:48:23,222
因為昏迷無法實施外科手術
No surgery could be performed
because of the coma.

661
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:27,357
你無法體會那種黑暗...
You can't feel the darkness...

662
00:48:27,468 --> 00:48:28,833
還有麻木
or numbness.

663
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:32,505
你甚至毫無知覺
You can't even feel.

664
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:34,302
然後...
And then...

665
00:48:34,408 --> 00:48:36,569
我又回到我的生活
I came back to life.

666
00:48:39,213 --> 00:48:41,204
就像小狗班尼
Just like that dog.

667
00:48:41,315 --> 00:48:43,783
班尼, 你知道, 那只小狗
Benny. You know, Benny the dog.

668
00:48:44,786 --> 00:48:46,811
班尼, 小狗班尼
Benny. Benny the dog.

669
00:48:46,921 --> 00:48:50,322
只是我的生活不再正常
Only my life
was no longer normal.

670
00:48:51,192 --> 00:48:54,684
神經損傷讓我頭痛欲裂
There are blinding migraines now-
nerve damage.

671
00:48:54,796 --> 00:48:56,161
為什麼?
Why?

672
00:48:56,264 --> 00:49:00,098
這就和大企業操縱...
This is how
big business operates-

673
00:49:00,201 --> 00:49:02,226
隨機的意外一樣
random accidents...

674
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:04,827
一個生活中的事故
a lifestyle mishap.

675
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:06,634
這都不是巧合
They are not coincidences.

676
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:11,508
你不覺得再縝密的合同都會有破綻嗎?
How do you think
airtight contracts are broken?

677
00:49:11,612 --> 00:49:14,911
這都是因為權利的爭奪
These are power upheavals.

678
00:49:15,016 --> 00:49:16,813
我是從鄉下來的
I'm from Ohio.

679
00:49:17,752 --> 00:49:19,686
我們沒見過權利爭奪
We don't have power upheavals.

680
00:49:19,787 --> 00:49:22,813
每天的新聞都有, 就在字裡行間
They are in the news every day
right between the lines.

681
00:49:25,259 --> 00:49:27,193
有人故意這樣對我
Someone did this to me.

682
00:49:28,696 --> 00:49:31,028
我爸在他的書裡就寫過這些
My father wrote about this
in his book.

683
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:33,464
第一章, 第一頁...
Chapter one, page one...

684
00:49:33,568 --> 00:49:35,126
第一段
paragraph one-

685
00:49:35,236 --> 00:49:37,534
"一百個問題中有九十九個答案是什麼?
"What is the answer to 99
out of 100 questions?

686
00:49:41,442 --> 00:49:42,340
錢."
Money."

687
00:49:42,443 --> 00:49:44,843
大衛, 聽著, 我不想讓你擔心
David, look,
I don't wanna worry you.

688
00:49:44,946 --> 00:49:47,744
我正在應付, 但現在有個情況
I'm holding them off,
but we got a situation here.

689
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:51,285
根據董事會的規章, 要保有你51%的股權...
The bylaws of the board
protect your 51 % vote...

690
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:53,683
你必須心智正常
only if you're mentally acute.

691
00:49:54,355 --> 00:49:56,346
我很遺憾那可憐的女孩死了...
I'm sorry that poor girl died...

692
00:49:56,457 --> 00:49:59,392
但你還掌握著董事會, 真是不幸中的萬幸
but you've handed the board
a real gift with your mishap.

693
00:49:59,493 --> 00:50:02,792
他們想宣佈你讓權
They'd like to declare you
incapacitated.

694
00:50:02,897 --> 00:50:05,832
但你又回來了
But you're back.

695
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:09,733
聽到你的聲音真好, 就讓我們和那幫混蛋開戰吧...
You sound good to me,
so let's fight the fuckers...

696
00:50:09,837 --> 00:50:11,737
好好養傷
and have a full recovery.

697
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,103
也許你應該讓大家見見你?
And maybe you should let
people see you, yeah?

698
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:17,109
上次我們一起去, 你還在昏迷...
The last time we were together
you were in a coma...

699
00:50:17,211 --> 00:50:19,702
你對我真他媽的沒禮貌
and you were very
fucking rude to me.

700
00:50:19,814 --> 00:50:22,442
你都沒說一句話
You didn't say a word.

701
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:26,816
是的, 關於我去世的謠言被有些誇大了
Yes, well, the rumors of my death
have been mildly exaggerated.

702
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:32,959
我該相信誰?
Who could I trust?

703
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,858
螞蟻們都在蟻丘上議論紛紛呢
The ants were taking over
the anthill.

704
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:39,765
我該相信誰?
Who could I trust?

705
00:51:40,661 --> 00:51:44,324
頭骨打了30顆鋼釘...
The cranial structure
was based on 30 pins...

706
00:51:44,432 --> 00:51:47,890
並用下頜骨碎片固定
and fastened by micro-panels
and bits of bone from the mandible.

707
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:50,937
看起來軟骨成型技術保持了你的臉部結構
It appears the cartilage graphs
have maintained your cheek structure.

708
00:51:51,038 --> 00:51:53,336
不幸的是, 由於你一直昏迷...
Unfortunately,
because you were in a coma-

709
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:56,601
醫生, 他們滿口術語, 那你只好做些功課...
Doctors. Their power is in jargon,
so you study up.

710
00:51:56,878 --> 00:52:00,177
這過程造成的雙側眶周血腫...
Is that the procedure for all
bilateral periorbital hematomas...

711
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:02,216
是由於昏迷患者的勒福氏骨折嗎
in a LeFort Three fracture
of a comatose patient?

712
00:52:02,317 --> 00:52:04,217
- 勒福氏骨折?
- ...你做到最好
- In a LeFort Three?
- You do your best.

713
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,286
當然
Absolutely.

714
00:52:05,387 --> 00:52:08,652
顱內腦損傷的機率太大了
The potential for intracranial
brain damage was too great.

715
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:10,748
除了面部移植, 波梅蘭茲醫生...
Beyond the cheek grafts,
Dr. Pomeranz...

716
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,419
是否用那些鋼釘固定...
are the pins fastened with any kind
of aluminum which could ionize...

717
00:52:13,528 --> 00:52:15,655
會在我腦袋裡造成壓力?
and cause that pressure
in my head?

718
00:52:15,764 --> 00:52:18,733
- 我已準備接受手術
- 我們正在研究
- I'm ready for another operation.
- We are working on processes.

719
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:21,962
但你並不適合做手術, 我們還在實驗
But you're specifically not at
the stage where we can experiment.

720
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:26,437
實驗, 就用我吧
Experiment. Use me.

721
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:29,009
頭痛將會消失
The headaches will go away.

722
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,601
這不只是頭痛
These are more than headaches.

723
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:35,809
這就像用鋼板切斷了我所有的思想
These are like steel plates
slicing through my every thought.

724
00:52:35,917 --> 00:52:38,181
我們不是牛仔, 不會這樣隨意就做
We're not cowboys.
We can't just wing it.

725
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:41,619
大部分時間我都無法認真思考
Because I can't think straight
most of the time.

726
00:52:41,723 --> 00:52:44,692
- 我們可以增加你的藥量
- 噢, 是啊, 藥物
- We can increase your medication.
- Oh, yes, medication.

727
00:52:46,528 --> 00:52:49,429
我們會繼續研究方案
And there are things
that we'll continue to investigate.

728
00:52:49,531 --> 00:52:52,193
不管怎樣, 有很多人都沒有這種效果...
However, there are so many others
who've not had the aesthetic benefit...

729
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,564
像你整形出來這樣
of plastic surgery
as you have.

730
00:52:56,471 --> 00:52:59,235
這無關虛榮, 波梅蘭茲醫生
This isn't about vanity,
Dr. Pomeranz.

731
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:01,241
這無關虛榮
This isn't about vanity.

732
00:53:01,343 --> 00:53:03,334
這是關於正常的功能
This is about functioning
in the world.

733
00:53:03,445 --> 00:53:05,538
完整的功能是我正常運作必須的
It's my job to be out there
functioning.

734
00:53:06,581 --> 00:53:09,414
我有錢, 我會出任意價格
I've got the money.
I'll pay any amount.

735
00:53:10,518 --> 00:53:12,418
發明些什麼吧
Just invent something.

736
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,215
發揮想像力
Just play jazz.

737
00:53:14,322 --> 00:53:16,415
你們自稱是紐約最好的整形醫生
You say you're
the best face man in New York.

738
00:53:16,524 --> 00:53:18,424
他媽的證明給我看
Fucking prove it.

739
00:53:22,163 --> 00:53:24,393
- 我們可以給你的手臂做手術
- 去他媽的手臂!
- We could do something about your arm.
- Fuck my arm!

740
00:53:29,704 --> 00:53:31,604
這兒沒人自以為能體會到你的感受
Nobody here takes your feelings
for granted.

741
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:35,776
根據初步的診斷我們的確為你準備了一樣東西
We did prepare something for you
based on the preliminary examination.

742
00:53:35,877 --> 00:53:37,777
說吧, 拿出來
Tell me. Bring it on.

743
00:53:37,879 --> 00:53:40,279
這在排斥反應的初期是很有用的
It's sometimes useful
in the early stages of rejection.

744
00:53:41,616 --> 00:53:44,380
是一個面部假體, 花了兩周才做好
It's a facial prosthetic.
It was two weeks in the making.

745
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:46,954
- 謝謝, 卡莉
- 不客氣, 醫生
- Thank you, Carly.
- You're welcome, Doctor.

746
00:53:57,332 --> 00:53:59,232
一個面部假體
A facial prosthetic.

747
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:01,302
作為外觀的替代品它的確很有效...
The aesthetic replacement
does work...

748
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:04,201
無論心理上還是生理上
emotionally and actually.

749
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:07,036
面具上的塑膠還可以阻擋不良的射線...
The plastic in the aesthetic shield
also blocks out abusive rays...

750
00:54:07,142 --> 00:54:09,042
有助於細胞的重生
and assists in
the regeneration of cells.

751
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:13,877
所以這是個外觀重建的護罩?
So it's an aesthetic
regenerative shield.

752
00:54:13,982 --> 00:54:15,574
正確, 完全地
That's correct. Exactly.

753
00:54:15,684 --> 00:54:18,710
護罩的人體工學原理還能使其自我調整...
The ergonomics of the plate barrier
allows it to interact reflexively...

754
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,254
與你的臉部動作緊密結合
with the movements
of your own face.

755
00:54:21,356 --> 00:54:22,789
我知道了
I see.

756
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:26,622
- 這是個有用的東西
- 好
- It's a helpful unit.
- Good.

757
00:54:26,728 --> 00:54:29,595
因為就這一會兒功夫裡, 我還以為我們只是在談論...
Because for a minute there,
I thought we were talking...

758
00:54:29,698 --> 00:54:32,496
一個他媽的面具!
about a fucking mask!

759
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:35,262
這就只是個面具...
It's only a mask...

760
00:54:36,037 --> 00:54:38,005
如果你這樣認為的話
if you treat it that way.

761
00:54:38,106 --> 00:54:41,598
太棒了, 萬聖節真是派上用場了
It's great. This completely
takes care of Halloween.

762
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:47,278
但是其他那364天怎麼辦呢?
But what about the other
364 days of the year?

763
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:04,655
一個全新的我逐漸成形
A new form of me
began to take shape.

764
00:55:06,234 --> 00:55:08,896
我計畫著我的複出...
I planned my reemergence...

765
00:55:09,004 --> 00:55:10,995
就像諾曼地登陸
like the Normandy invasion.

766
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:13,438
索菲亞, 索菲亞
Sofia. Sofia.

767
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:18,041
索菲亞.塞拉諾
Sofia Serrano.

768
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:20,982
我只會說
I'll just say it.

769
00:55:21,082 --> 00:55:23,277
我做足了功課
I did my homework.

770
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:25,819
我看了每一份備忘錄
I read every memo.

771
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,218
湯瑪斯.提普是對的
Thomas Tipp was right.

772
00:55:28,323 --> 00:55:30,223
人們會再閱讀
People will read again.

773
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,521
我通過視頻參加每月和七個矮人的董事會議
I attended the monthly board meeting
with the Seven Dwarfs by video hookup.

774
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,928
因為人們不再買書了
Because people
aren't buying books.

775
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:41,969
- 讓我們投資吧
- 噢, 天哪, 這是戰爭
- Let's invest.
- Oh, baby, this was war.

776
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:45,403
我以這種方式變得越來越強, 我以前都不知道
I grew stronger in ways
I'd never known before.

777
00:55:45,507 --> 00:55:47,498
然後到了十二月五日...
And on December 5...

778
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:50,100
我的飛機佈滿了天空...
my planes filled the sky.

779
00:55:50,211 --> 00:55:53,271
大衛.埃姆斯的複出...
The return of David Aames, Jr...

780
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:55,576
國民老二2世
Citizen Dildo.

781
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,258
你不會相信這個...
You won't believe this...

782
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:42,324
但這是我的笑容
but this is me smiling.

783
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:50,868
好久不見
It's been a long time.

784
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:54,567
我想找你, 但你的人不讓我進去
I tried to see you,
but your people wouldn't let me.

785
00:56:54,676 --> 00:56:57,372
我都不想見我, 好吧?
I didn't want to see me, okay?

786
00:56:57,479 --> 00:56:59,640
但是後來...
But then...

787
00:56:59,747 --> 00:57:02,215
今天我醒來, 發現...
I woke up today
and finally...

788
00:57:03,384 --> 00:57:05,284
頭髮真好看
a good hair day.

789
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,881
你想和我約會嗎?
You wanna get together?

790
00:57:13,628 --> 00:57:14,754
當然
Sure.

791
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:19,464
- 真的嗎?
- 讓我們出去做點什麼
- What?
- Let's go out and do something.

792
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:21,296
這週末
This weekend.

793
00:57:21,402 --> 00:57:23,666
我要取消幾個常式
I'll cancel an operation or two.

794
00:57:23,771 --> 00:57:26,137
我們會很開心...
We'll have fun...

795
00:57:26,241 --> 00:57:29,733
因為我是個玩家
because I am all about fun.

796
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:36,745
好的, 觀眾們, 今晚第一個嘉賓是一個神奇的生存故事
Okay, folks, our first guest tonight
is an amazing survival story.

797
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:38,944
歡迎小狗班尼
Please welcome Benny the dog.

798
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:47,321
歡迎來上節目, 謝謝你來這裡
So welcome to the show.
Thank you very much for being here.

799
00:57:47,428 --> 00:57:49,487
- 真的, 我很榮幸
- 我有很多問題
- You bet. My pleasure.
- I have so many questions.

800
00:57:49,597 --> 00:57:52,964
首先, 和我們談談班尼發生了什麼事
To start off, tell us all
what has happened to Benny.

801
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:55,160
它經歷過什麼?
What's Benny been through?

802
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:58,205
好的, 班尼掉進了我家附近的河水裡
Well, Benny fell into the water
near our home.

803
00:57:58,306 --> 00:58:01,366
然後它被凍在凱科米什河裡
And he was frozen
in the Skykomish River.

804
00:58:01,476 --> 00:58:02,636
- 在華盛頓
- 沒錯
- In Washington.
- That's right.

805
00:58:02,744 --> 00:58:06,373
我去釣魚, 正想著它已經失蹤三個月了
I went fishing, thinking he'd
been gone now for three months.

806
00:58:06,481 --> 00:58:09,882
然後發現它在一個冰塊裡
And I see him
in a block of ice.

807
00:58:09,984 --> 00:58:12,976
它現在已經被解凍了, 對嗎?
He is thawed out now.
Is that correct?

808
00:58:13,855 --> 00:58:16,517
它不再活蹦亂跳了, 我很擔心
He's not moving a lot.
I'm worried.

809
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:19,286
我應該去拿個鉗子嗎? 我很擔心這小狗
Should I get out some tongs?
I'm worried about the dog.

810
00:58:19,394 --> 00:58:22,659
不, 它沒事, 它只是少一些活潑
No, he's fine. He's just lost
a little bit of his friskiness.

811
00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:23,664
我也這麼想
I would think so, yeah.

812
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:27,633
索菲亞, 我是大衛, 又來吵你了
It's David.
I'm back in your life.

813
00:58:27,735 --> 00:58:30,226
今早我剛見過你
I saw you earlier today.

814
00:58:30,338 --> 00:58:35,037
我正看到我們的老朋友小狗班尼...
I was just watching
our old friend Benny the dog...

815
00:58:35,143 --> 00:58:36,542
在上節目...
on Conan...

816
00:58:37,912 --> 00:58:39,812
然後我想到你
and I thought of you.

817
00:58:41,015 --> 00:58:42,414
無所謂了
Whatever.

818
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:47,746
很高興今天見到你
I loved seeing you today.

819
00:58:47,855 --> 00:58:50,551
我會很快再見你的
So I will see you soon.

820
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:53,526
你是個很棒的舞者
You're a great dancer.

821
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:57,930
再見
Bye.

822
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:49,575
- 你在喝什麼?
- 沒什麼
- What you drinkin'?
- Nothing.

823
00:59:49,684 --> 00:59:52,744
我有意來一杯廉價的, 含糖的, 朗姆酒加可樂
I'm in the mood for a cheap,
sugary, overpriced rum and Coke.

824
00:59:52,854 --> 00:59:55,288
- 你要嗎?
- 還有其他的?
- So you want one?
- Is there any other kind?

825
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:57,415
我去買
I'll get us some.

826
00:59:57,525 --> 00:59:59,425
洗手間在哪?
Where is the bathroom?

827
00:59:59,527 --> 01:00:03,088
就在那個地方的後面...
It's behind-
over there by the place...

828
01:00:03,197 --> 01:00:05,597
那個看起來像比約克的女孩那邊
by the girl who looks like Bjork.

829
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,600
- 我就回來
- 也許我應該...
- I'll be right back.
- Maybe I should-

830
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:13,134
嘿, 老兄, 你看起來不錯, 你的書怎麼樣?
Hey, man, you look good.
How's your book?

831
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:16,039
- 脫下來
- 不, 這是個面罩
- Take it off.
- No, this is a facial shield.

832
01:00:16,144 --> 01:00:19,636
這是個美觀的假體, 這些他媽的醫生...
It's an aesthetic prosthesis
these fucking doctors-

833
01:00:19,747 --> 01:00:22,045
拿掉那面罩, 老兄, 它把我嚇壞了
Take off the mask, man.
It's freaking me out.

834
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:23,549
不行
I can't.

835
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:27,753
這是我的臉, 這就是我的臉
It's my face.
This is my face.

836
01:00:27,855 --> 01:00:30,016
相信我, 那有點不一樣
Trust me.
It's a little different.

837
01:00:30,124 --> 01:00:33,491
如果你覺得尷尬, 就走吧, 沒人要找你作伴
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to chaperone.

838
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:36,596
- 索菲亞找我來的
- 什麼?
- Sofia asked me.
- What?

839
01:00:36,698 --> 01:00:39,132
她不想獨自和我在一起? 真是胡扯!
She didn't want to be alone with me?
That's bullshit!

840
01:00:39,233 --> 01:00:42,225
我覺得我都已經他媽的能接受這整件事了
Because I think I'm being pretty
fucking cool about this whole thing.

841
01:00:42,337 --> 01:00:44,237
去和心理醫生說
Talk to a shrink.

842
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:47,797
或者有時間可以打給我, 而不是躲在你的公寓裡
Or you can call me sometime
instead of hiding in your apartment.

843
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:50,036
別對一個女孩子這樣, 你只見過她一次
Don't take it out on a girl
you only met once.

844
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:53,740
這是她說的嗎?
Did she say that-

845
01:00:53,848 --> 01:00:55,315
一次?
once?

846
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:57,316
她說了我只見過她一次嗎?
Did she say
that I met her once?

847
01:00:57,418 --> 01:00:59,181
打住, 好嗎?
Just cut it out, okay?

848
01:00:59,287 --> 01:01:01,812
我懷念以前的你
I miss the old you.

849
01:01:01,923 --> 01:01:03,823
我們都懷念以前的你...
We all miss the old you...

850
01:01:03,925 --> 01:01:06,723
因為現在這個是個爛人
because the new guy is shit.

851
01:01:08,796 --> 01:01:11,060
說錯了, 我愛你
That came out wrong.
I love you.

852
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:12,928
某段時期
Period.

853
01:01:13,034 --> 01:01:16,197
- 你手臂怎麼樣, 老兄?
- 去你的, 布萊恩
- How's your arm, man?
- Fuck you, Brian.

854
01:01:16,304 --> 01:01:18,295
要不這樣...
How 'bout...

855
01:01:18,406 --> 01:01:19,964
不要同情
no sympathy.

856
01:01:20,074 --> 01:01:23,474
要不這就是我們的約定, 好...嗎?
How 'bout that's
the deal we make, okay?

857
01:01:33,654 --> 01:01:36,384
給我來杯百威和一小杯龍舌蘭
Give me a Budweiser
and a shot of tequila.

858
01:01:36,491 --> 01:01:38,686
哪種龍舌蘭?
What kind of tequila?

859
01:01:40,428 --> 01:01:44,091
- 你說什麼?
- 我說, 哪種龍舌蘭?
- What did you say to me?
- I said, what kind of tequila?

860
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:47,699
為什麼不看著我的臉說, 婊子?
Why don't you ask me
to my face, bitch?

861
01:01:52,173 --> 01:01:54,403
培恩的, 如果你有的話
Patrón, if you have it.

862
01:02:23,638 --> 01:02:25,538
再來杯龍舌蘭和百威
Another shot, another Bud.

863
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,437
- 這杯免費
- 為什麼?
- This is on the house.
- Why?

864
01:02:27,542 --> 01:02:30,773
就這樣, 婊子
It just is, bitch.

865
01:03:21,796 --> 01:03:22,990
培恩!
Patrón!

866
01:03:32,206 --> 01:03:34,674
老兄, 整一下你他媽的臉
Dude, fix your fucking face.

867
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:29,489
- 又見面了
- 又見面了
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

868
01:04:29,597 --> 01:04:30,655
我有個想法
Idea.

869
01:04:30,765 --> 01:04:32,665
讓我們重新開始吧
Let's start over.

870
01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:37,596
能幫我個忙嗎? 不打擾的話
How 'bout if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.

871
01:04:37,705 --> 01:04:39,764
哦, 你擾到了, 不過食物不錯
Oh, you are,
but the food is good.

872
01:04:39,874 --> 01:04:43,435
看, 我有個小麻煩, 有人跟蹤我
See, I've got this little problem.
I've got a stalker.

873
01:04:45,346 --> 01:04:48,179
聽起來沒什麼大不了. 我需要個擋箭牌
Doesn't sound life-threatening.
I need a cover.

874
01:04:48,282 --> 01:04:51,513
我需要你假裝我們在愉快的交談...
I need for you to pretend that we're
having a scintillating conversation...

875
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:55,055
而你非常享受
and you are wildly entertained.

876
01:04:55,156 --> 01:04:57,989
我知道這很為難. 我會配合的
I know it's tough.
I'll improvise.

877
01:04:58,092 --> 01:04:59,753
我不是那樣說的
I don't talk like that.

878
01:05:00,828 --> 01:05:04,525
她就在屋子另一邊, 正盯著我背後看
She's right across the room.
She's burning a hole in my back now.

879
01:05:08,302 --> 01:05:11,066
紅禮服, 系帶鞋
Red dress, strappy shoes.

880
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:15,507
沒錯
That's right.

881
01:05:17,445 --> 01:05:20,346
我想她就是那個最傷心的女孩...
I think she is the saddest girl...

882
01:05:20,448 --> 01:05:22,575
一直拿著一杯馬提尼
to ever hold a martini.

883
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:37,429
- 你還好吧?
- 不
- Are you okay?
- No.

884
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:40,725
為什麼? 怎麼了? 是我嗎?
Why? What's wrong?
Is it me?

885
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:44,235
- 是我嗎?
- 以後再說
- Is it me?
- I'll tell you later.

886
01:05:44,338 --> 01:05:47,273
- 以後再說
- 不對勁, 拜託, 和我說啊
- I'll tell you later.
- Something's wrong. Please. Tell me now.

887
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,240
現在就說出來
Talk about it all right now.

888
01:05:49,343 --> 01:05:51,937
- 快說, 全都說出來
- 我以後會和你說!
- Talk about it. Get it all out.
- I'll tell you later!

889
01:05:52,046 --> 01:05:54,071
說所有的事情
Say everything now.

890
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:57,776
你就把所有事都說出來, 現在!快!快!
Just say everything now.
Now! Now! Now!

891
01:05:57,885 --> 01:06:01,877
我會在下輩子告訴你, 當我們都變成貓的時候
I'll tell you in another life,
when we are both cats.

892
01:06:07,228 --> 01:06:09,196
我無法相信你說了這些
I can't believe
you just said that.

893
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,360
這是我聽過的最棒的事
That is the greatest thing
that I've ever heard.

894
01:06:15,469 --> 01:06:17,960
你這麼說可真是有趣啊
That's hilarious
that you said that.

895
01:06:19,073 --> 01:06:22,736
看, 你竟然這麼說
See, that- You said that.

896
01:06:22,843 --> 01:06:25,505
這就是我愛你的地方
That is what I love about you.

897
01:06:26,514 --> 01:06:28,982
這真是太好玩了
That's hilarious.

898
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:32,519
我會在下輩子告訴你, 當我們都變成貓的時候
I'll tell you in another life,
when we are both cats.

899
01:06:33,788 --> 01:06:34,982
貓!
Cats!

900
01:06:35,089 --> 01:06:36,488
貓!
Cats!

901
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:43,920
那麼, 我們就在這分開吧
Well, this is where I leave you.

902
01:06:44,031 --> 01:06:45,931
我要送你到家門口
I'll walk you to your door.

903
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:48,558
- 我就住在轉角那邊
- 我有腳踏車
- I live just around the corner.
- I've got my bike here.

904
01:06:48,669 --> 01:06:50,762
- 我更想走路
- 別費力了
- I'd rather walk.
- Don't be a drag.

905
01:06:50,871 --> 01:06:53,431
你看不出來她想自己走?
Can't you see
she wants to go on her own?

906
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:55,441
閉嘴, 你醉了
Shut up. You're drunk.

907
01:06:56,544 --> 01:06:59,877
我也許是白癡, 但我沒喝醉
I may be an idiot,
but I'm not drunk.

908
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,881
說真的, 我不需要你送我到家
Seriously, I don't need you
to walk me home.

909
01:07:02,983 --> 01:07:05,008
謝謝你
Thank you.

910
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,714
好吧, 那麼, 我們再打給你
Okay, then.
So we'll call you.

911
01:07:09,824 --> 01:07:12,657
好的, 到時我們去看場電影什麼的
We'll go catch a movie
or something.

912
01:07:14,028 --> 01:07:15,928
那麼我們很快會再見的
So we'll meet up soon.

913
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,100
我們很快會再見的
We'll meet up soon.

914
01:07:30,811 --> 01:07:33,575
我們會再打給你, 到時和我約會!
We'll call you again
to go out with me!

915
01:07:35,082 --> 01:07:36,379
我們再打給你
We'll call you.

916
01:07:37,651 --> 01:07:39,209
這玩得可真開心啊
It's been a real blast.

917
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,413
我祝你晚安
I bid you good evening.

918
01:07:41,522 --> 01:07:43,513
等等, 等等, 你去哪?
Wait, wait.
Where are you going?

919
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:46,752
我的腳踏車, 就在那後面, 改天再找你玩
My bike- it's back over there.
We'll hang soon.

920
01:07:46,861 --> 01:07:49,796
帶上你的面具如果你想的話, 我已經習慣了
And bring your mask if you want.
I'm getting used to it.

921
01:07:51,732 --> 01:07:52,960
等一下
Wait a minute.

922
01:07:53,067 --> 01:07:54,557
什麼?
What?

923
01:07:57,104 --> 01:07:58,935
我不知道
I don't know.

924
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,473
你喝得有點多了, 有事明天打給我吧
You drank a little too much.
Call me tomorrow if you want.

925
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:04,066
我希望明天我就死了
Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.

926
01:08:07,214 --> 01:08:09,205
不, 你不希望, 你只需要睡個覺
No, you won't.
You just need to sleep.

927
01:08:15,289 --> 01:08:16,984
什麼?
What?

928
01:08:21,428 --> 01:08:25,592
車禍前你和茱莉.吉雅妮說了什麼?
What did you say to Julie Gianni
the night of the accident?

929
01:08:26,867 --> 01:08:27,925
什麼?
What?

930
01:08:28,702 --> 01:08:32,468
你和她說她是個..炮友
You told her
she was a fuck buddy.

931
01:08:32,573 --> 01:08:33,972
沒有
Never.

932
01:08:35,342 --> 01:08:38,641
她火得有點過頭了
She was a little more
than pissed about it.

933
01:08:38,746 --> 01:08:42,147
你一直就為這破事耿耿於懷?
Have you been harboring
this shit all along?

934
01:08:42,249 --> 01:08:44,149
我從沒和她說過
I never talked to her.

935
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:49,988
好吧
Whatever.

936
01:08:52,526 --> 01:08:54,289
還有...
Anyway...

937
01:08:54,395 --> 01:08:58,592
如果我不是那個說你長得不醜的人, 那我是誰?
who am I if I can't be the one
to tell you you're not ugly?

938
01:08:58,866 --> 01:09:00,527
拜託
Come on.

939
01:09:00,634 --> 01:09:03,501
勉強笑一個吧
Give me a courtesy laugh.

940
01:09:03,604 --> 01:09:06,505
噢, 布萊恩, 我搞砸了
Oh, Brian, I'm so fucked up.

941
01:09:06,607 --> 01:09:08,768
我真的搞砸了
I'm just so fucked up.

942
01:09:10,878 --> 01:09:13,039
嘿, 布萊恩, 拜託
Hey, Brian, come on.

943
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:17,850
我們是最好的朋友!
We're best friends!

944
01:09:18,986 --> 01:09:20,283
我們是哥們!
We're bros!

945
01:09:21,288 --> 01:09:23,483
拜託, 老兄, 我們是哥們
Come on, man, we're bros.

946
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:05,815
睜開你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

947
01:11:12,266 --> 01:11:14,791
這是個很爛的博同情的方式
This is a cheap ploy
for sympathy.

948
01:11:15,636 --> 01:11:18,434
我沒事, 我沒事
I'm okay. I'm okay.

949
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:20,871
但起作用了, 起來吧
And it worked. Get up.

950
01:11:22,142 --> 01:11:23,609
服你了
I agree.

951
01:11:26,413 --> 01:11:28,677
這是個玩笑吧
This is a joke.

952
01:11:28,782 --> 01:11:31,376
大衛, 我不想騙你
David, I'm not gonna lie to you.

953
01:11:31,485 --> 01:11:33,146
我喜歡曾經的你
I liked the way you looked.

954
01:11:34,154 --> 01:11:36,054
但...
But...

955
01:11:36,156 --> 01:11:38,147
你得他媽的振作起來
you have to pull it
the fuck together.

956
01:11:39,026 --> 01:11:42,120
否則的話, 我就會把那個人忘了
Because if not,
I'll forget the other guy.

957
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:45,790
你還知道那個人吧?  你
You know that other guy?
You.

958
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,601
我還是那個人, 我還和以前一樣
I'm still that guy.
I'm still that guy.

959
01:11:49,703 --> 01:11:52,797
聽好, 我骨子裡可不是個慈祥的人
I don't have a mother-savior bone
in my body.

960
01:11:52,906 --> 01:11:56,364
和那無關, 你進來吧
It's not about that.
You are coming inside.

961
01:11:56,477 --> 01:11:59,139
但如果事實證明這是個大錯...
But if this turns out
to be a big mistake...

962
01:12:00,314 --> 01:12:03,977
我也能停止不去愛你...
I do have the ability
to fall out of love with you...

963
01:12:04,084 --> 01:12:05,176
就像這樣簡單
like that.

964
01:12:15,629 --> 01:12:17,529
我們一起創造了我們的世界
We created
our own world together.

965
01:12:17,631 --> 01:12:19,258
- 我還和以前一樣
- 閉嘴
- I am still that guy.
- Shut up.

966
01:12:19,366 --> 01:12:21,300
我們與世俗抗爭
Us versus them.

967
01:12:21,402 --> 01:12:23,370
- 布萊恩在哪?
- 布萊恩?
- Where's Brian?
- Brian?

968
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:26,439
他跑去找你了, 不是嗎?
He went with you, didn't he?

969
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,770
我以為你們好上了
I thought you guys hooked up.

970
01:12:30,444 --> 01:12:33,504
我真希望你從沒上那女孩的車
I wish you hadn't gotten
in the car with that girl.

971
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:38,177
索菲亞, 我...
Sofia, I-

972
01:12:41,388 --> 01:12:43,948
你用眼神來道歉吧
Your eyes apologize better.

973
01:12:45,793 --> 01:12:47,192
來吧
Come on.

974
01:12:48,362 --> 01:12:51,456
天哪, 這將會令我的生活...
Holy God, this is going
to change my life...

975
01:12:51,565 --> 01:12:54,466
發生翻天覆地的變化
in a zillion different ways.

976
01:12:54,568 --> 01:12:56,559
我一定是瘋了
I must be nuts.

977
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:58,570
我們是天生一對
And we were quite a pair.

978
01:12:58,672 --> 01:13:01,800
她相信我, 我也覺得...
Her believing in me,
me believing that...

979
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:04,400
我值得她這樣
I actually deserved it.

980
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,248
索菲亞...
Sofia...

981
01:13:22,696 --> 01:13:25,426
我看你沒在浪費時間
I see you haven't
been wasting your time.

982
01:13:26,533 --> 01:13:28,763
你還畫過其他的嗎?
Do you ever draw
anything else?

983
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,024
沒
No

984
01:13:32,706 --> 01:13:34,901
昨晚睡了嗎?
Did you sleep last night?

985
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,405
沒, 沒睡
No, I did not sleep.

986
01:13:38,512 --> 01:13:41,379
我今天得早走, 你得長話短說
Got to leave early today,
so you'll have to be brief.

987
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:44,508
那, 你能告訴我些什麼...
Now, what can you tell me...

988
01:13:44,618 --> 01:13:46,984
是有關於這名字"艾莉"的?
about the name "Ellie"?

989
01:13:49,456 --> 01:13:51,253
艾莉
Ellie.

990
01:13:51,358 --> 01:13:54,122
是你認識的女孩? 你愛過的女孩?
Is that a girl you knew,
a girl you were in love with?

991
01:13:54,228 --> 01:13:56,423
我只愛過一次
I've only been in love once.

992
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:59,556
很顯然, 昨晚你一直在喊她的名字
Apparently, you kept
repeating it last night.

993
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:03,659
你有睡覺, 大衛, 你的導師說你喊出來了
You did sleep, David.
Your advisor said you cried out.

994
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:06,238
- 你做了個噩夢
- 這一切都是噩夢
- You had a nightmare.
- Everything's a nightmare.

995
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:10,800
你在喊艾莉, 大衛, 記得發生了什麼嗎?
You cried out for Ellie, David.
Do you remember what happened?

996
01:14:13,799 --> 01:14:17,002
我, 我不記得...
I, I no...

997
01:14:17,518 --> 01:14:19,213
仔細想, 大衛
Dig deep, David.

998
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:21,150
仔細想
Dig deep.

999
01:14:21,255 --> 01:14:24,418
你在喊艾莉, 你記得什麼嗎?
You cried out for Ellie.
What do you remember about Ellie?

1000
01:14:27,127 --> 01:14:29,152
給我看你的臉, 大衛
Show me your face, David.

1001
01:14:31,098 --> 01:14:33,999
幫我開啟那道門
Help me open the door.

1002
01:14:43,544 --> 01:14:47,503
你的確是出了車禍, 你的確被毀容了
It's true you had an accident.
It's true you were disfigured.

1003
01:14:47,614 --> 01:14:50,048
但你恢復了
But not anymore.

1004
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,050
記得嗎?
Do you remember?

1005
01:14:54,121 --> 01:14:56,021
他們的確修復了你的臉
They did fix your face.

1006
01:14:58,559 --> 01:15:01,357
把面具摘掉, 大衛
Take off that mask, David.

1007
01:15:01,461 --> 01:15:03,895
你會看到下面那張完美的臉
You'll see your face
is perfect under there.

1008
01:15:05,165 --> 01:15:07,224
我從不相信醫生
I never trusted the doctors.

1009
01:15:09,503 --> 01:15:12,631
接下來的事更離奇
What happened next was surreal.

1010
01:15:13,774 --> 01:15:17,005
那個傲慢的混蛋, 波梅蘭茲醫生, 打電話給我
That same arrogant bastard,
Dr. Pomeranz, called me.

1011
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:19,578
突然間他成為我的好朋友
Suddenly he was
my new best friend.

1012
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,205
大衛, 嘿, 哥們
David! Hey, my brother.

1013
01:15:22,316 --> 01:15:24,682
對上次的談話我感到內疚
I felt really bad
about our last conversation.

1014
01:15:24,785 --> 01:15:28,084
他說他發明瞭一個新的整形方式...
He said he'd discovered a new form
of reconstructive surgery...

1015
01:15:28,188 --> 01:15:30,656
得到了來自柏林的醫生的幫助
with the help of a doctor
from Berlin.

1016
01:15:30,757 --> 01:15:31,985
你好
Hello.

1017
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:35,687
接下來, 他們用不知什麼藥物給我全身麻醉...
Next thing I knew, they shot me
full of drugs I'd never heard of...

1018
01:15:35,796 --> 01:15:38,356
然後去手術室
and away we went.

1019
01:15:38,465 --> 01:15:42,492
如果上帝是我們中的一員
What if God was one of us

1020
01:15:44,137 --> 01:15:48,005
也就跟我們差不多
Just a slob like one of us

1021
01:15:48,108 --> 01:15:51,236
努力尋找回家的路
Trying to make his way home

1022
01:15:51,345 --> 01:15:53,870
他嗓子不錯
He's got a good voice.

1023
01:15:53,981 --> 01:15:55,175
55
Fifty-five.

1024
01:15:55,282 --> 01:15:57,546
那個概率, 他們說, 有三分之一可能...
The odds, they said,
were one in three...

1025
01:15:57,651 --> 01:16:00,017
會讓頭痛減輕50%...
that the headaches
could be reduced by 50 percent...

1026
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,554
並且重建面部組織
and facial tissue
could be regenerated.

1027
01:16:02,656 --> 01:16:07,184
首次運用光纖重建眶骨膜的概念
The first to incorporate the concept
of endoscopic periorbital fiber optics.

1028
01:16:07,294 --> 01:16:08,921
等下哪吃去?
Where are we gonna eat later?

1029
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:11,020
我無法告訴你他們做了什麼
I can't even tell you
what they did.

1030
01:16:11,131 --> 01:16:13,361
看起來就像科幻小說
It seemed like
science fiction to me.

1031
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:15,367
你知道麥當娜有首歌"邊緣"
Madonna had that song,
"Borderline."

1032
01:16:15,469 --> 01:16:17,562
- 那首很好聽
- ...剪一下
- That was a hell of a song.
- And another snip.

1033
01:16:17,671 --> 01:16:20,970
我們完成後他就會變成個大帥哥
This is gonna be one
good-looking guy when I'm done.

1034
01:16:21,074 --> 01:16:23,406
顯然, 我很懷疑
Obviously, I was suspicious.

1035
01:16:24,678 --> 01:16:26,976
你不會嗎?
Wouldn't you be?

1036
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,708
懷疑誰, 懷疑什麼?
Suspicious of whom, of what?

1037
01:16:29,816 --> 01:16:30,874
醫生...
Doc...

1038
01:16:30,984 --> 01:16:34,647
一旦你以時速八十英里沖下一座橋...
once you've been driven
off a bridge at 80 miles an hour...

1039
01:16:34,755 --> 01:16:38,816
不知為何你很難再快樂起來, 除非有十足把握
somehow you don't invite happiness in
without a full body search.

1040
01:16:43,096 --> 01:16:45,428
不怕煩你
At the risk of boring you...

1041
01:16:45,532 --> 01:16:47,932
我有不同的看法
I can present
the alternate argument.

1042
01:16:49,336 --> 01:16:51,497
我曾經認識一個人...
I once knew a guy...

1043
01:16:51,605 --> 01:16:53,505
他很孤單
who was a real loner.

1044
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:56,700
直到他40歲某天...
One day he woke up at 40...

1045
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:59,677
兩個女兒讓他覺得生命有了意義...
with two daughters that
lit up his life with purpose...

1046
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:02,772
然後他開始經常去看學校的表演...
and he suddenly goes
to endless school plays...

1047
01:17:02,883 --> 01:17:05,511
9點半就回家聊天...
and he gets home at 9:20
for the evening discussion...

1048
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:09,885
他過著最快樂的時光
and he has the time of his life.

1049
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:13,585
他最喜歡的甲殼蟲人物曾經是約翰, 現在是保羅
His favorite Beatle was once John,
and now it's Paul.

1050
01:17:16,563 --> 01:17:18,861
我一直喜歡喬治
I always liked George.

1051
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,565
這完全取決於個人, 不是嗎
It all depends on
the individual, doesn't it?

1052
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:25,763
告訴我, 幸福對你來說是什麼?
Tell me,
what's happiness for you?

1053
01:17:25,872 --> 01:17:28,033
幸福對你來說是什麼, 大衛?
What's happiness to you, David?

1054
01:17:29,509 --> 01:17:32,239
- 可以問其他問題嗎?
- 你不給我看你的臉
- How 'bout another question?
- You won't show me your face.

1055
01:17:32,346 --> 01:17:34,143
給嗎?
Will you?

1056
01:17:34,247 --> 01:17:37,978
那就回到原來的談話吧
So back to the time line.

1057
01:17:38,085 --> 01:17:40,246
快, 讓我們快點結束這些
Hurry. Let's move through this.

1058
01:17:45,592 --> 01:17:46,991
什麼?
What?

1059
01:17:48,328 --> 01:17:50,262
你得把面具脫掉
You've got to take
the plates off.

1060
01:17:50,364 --> 01:17:52,696
我不想看到下面是什麼
I don't want to know
what's under here.

1061
01:17:52,799 --> 01:17:54,767
沒事的, 到時你就知道了
It's gonna be fine.
You'll see.

1062
01:17:54,868 --> 01:17:56,301
- 我明天再去
- 你今天就去
- I'll go tomorrow.
- Today.

1063
01:17:56,403 --> 01:17:58,667
我已經打給波梅蘭茲改到週三了
I already called Pomeranz
and switched it to Wednesday.

1064
01:18:03,977 --> 01:18:05,035
什麼?
What?

1065
01:18:07,481 --> 01:18:10,382
我希望你被前臺護士罵死
I hope that woman at the front desk
gave you shit about it.

1066
01:18:12,552 --> 01:18:16,147
改天沒事的,而且野馬汽車就要修好了
Another day won't matter.
Besides, the Mustang will be fixed.

1067
01:18:16,256 --> 01:18:19,487
原計劃是要開野馬去, 但沒好...
The plan was going in the Mustang.
The Mustang's not ready.

1068
01:18:19,593 --> 01:18:21,390
所以我們明天再去
So we'll go tomorrow
in the Mustang.

1069
01:18:21,495 --> 01:18:23,793
- 好吧
- 等它修好了我們就去
- Good.
- We'll go when it's fixed.

1070
01:18:23,897 --> 01:18:25,990
我知道問題是什麼...
I know that the problem...

1071
01:18:26,099 --> 01:18:30,092
你不會是在拖延你不敢面對的事吧
wouldn't be you delaying
something you were dreading.

1072
01:18:32,105 --> 01:18:34,266
不是
Couldn't be that.

1073
01:18:34,374 --> 01:18:36,274
當然不是
Couldn't be that.

1074
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:40,606
我是說
I mean-

1075
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:52,090
我是說, 我同意
I mean, I agree.

1076
01:18:54,361 --> 01:18:56,591
我覺得這很重要...
I think it's very important...

1077
01:18:56,696 --> 01:18:58,095
開著...
to have...

1078
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,600
心愛的車...
the right car...

1079
01:19:09,976 --> 01:19:11,944
帶你到...
to take you...

1080
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:16,039
想去的地方...
where you want to go...

1081
01:19:21,221 --> 01:19:23,485
一天二十四小時...
24 hours a day.

1082
01:19:48,982 --> 01:19:50,882
有多糟?
How bad is it?

1083
01:19:54,287 --> 01:19:57,779
額, 你的耳朵處在正確的位置
Well, your ears
are in the right place.

1084
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,988
其他的嘛...
And the rest of it...

1085
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:07,622
總的來說不錯
is not too bad at all.

1086
01:20:13,406 --> 01:20:14,873
太完美了
It's perfect.

1087

1088
01:21:05,759 --> 01:21:08,023
你愛我嗎?
Do you love me?

1089
01:21:08,128 --> 01:21:10,289
我是說, 真的愛嗎?
I mean, really love me?

1090
01:21:10,397 --> 01:21:13,093
因為如果你不愛的話...
Because if you don't...

1091
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,360
我就只好殺了你
I'll just have to kill you.

1092
01:21:19,072 --> 01:21:21,006
我的下輩子
You see, my next life?

1093
01:21:21,107 --> 01:21:22,836
在我的下輩子...
In my next life...

1094
01:21:22,943 --> 01:21:25,377
我會投胎變成這裡的這顆痣
I'm gonna come back
as this mole right here.

1095
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,576
說真的, 這顆痣
Seriously, this mole.

1096
01:21:29,683 --> 01:21:32,777
你只能穿比基尼和低胸的襯衣上班...
You'll have to wear bikini tops
to work and loose-fitting shirts...

1097
01:21:32,886 --> 01:21:35,377
這樣我才能透氣
so that I can breathe.

1098
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:38,184
我愛你
I love you.

1099
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:39,690
愛你
Love you.

1100
01:21:41,995 --> 01:21:43,394
我愛你
I love you.

1101
01:21:44,764 --> 01:21:47,597
我可以住在這裡
I can live right there.

1102
01:21:52,572 --> 01:21:54,472
這是個夢嗎?
Is this a dream?

1103
01:21:55,575 --> 01:21:56,974
絕對是
Absolutely.

# special scene #

1105
01:22:08,121 --> 01:22:11,249
我們聊大事, 小事...
We talked about the big things,
the little things...

1106
01:22:11,358 --> 01:22:13,258
大事...
and the big things.

1107
01:22:14,361 --> 01:22:16,795
但事實上, 和索菲亞在一起...
But in truth, with Sofia...

1108
01:22:16,896 --> 01:22:19,660
什麼都不聊都很快樂
it was the in-between times.

1109
01:22:42,555 --> 01:22:44,022
她說什麼?
What did she say?

1110
01:22:45,058 --> 01:22:46,525
我聽不懂
I have no idea.

1111
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:52,164
- 過得如何, 布萊恩?
- 很好
- How's things, Brian?
- Fine.

1112
01:22:54,234 --> 01:22:56,634
- 布萊恩, 過得如何?
- 別得意過頭了
- Brian, How's things?
- Don't flatter yourself.

1113
01:22:56,736 --> 01:22:58,294
我很好
I'm fine.

1114
01:22:58,405 --> 01:23:01,670
而且, 索菲亞很好, 但並不意味著獨一無二
Besides, Sofia is great
but by no means one of a kind.

1115
01:23:01,775 --> 01:23:03,675
她只是我一時的迷戀
She was a proximity infatuation.

1116
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:09,204
別抄那句, 那是我的, 謝謝
And don't use that. It's mine.
Thanks.

1117
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:12,317
你從哪弄的這像機?
Where'd you get this camera?

1118
01:23:12,419 --> 01:23:15,650
我的愛好, 你都不知道, 老兄
I'm into things.
You have no idea, my friend.

1119
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:19,351
你沒事就好
Just as long as you're okay.

1120
01:23:19,459 --> 01:23:21,620
還有, 我們是朋友, 不是嗎?
And anyway,
we're friends, aren't we?

1121
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,821
- 一直都是
- 沒錯
- Always.
- That's right.

1122
01:23:35,575 --> 01:23:37,475
你的臉怎麼了?
What's up with your face?

1123
01:23:39,345 --> 01:23:40,869
- 操!
- 什麼?
- Fuck!
- What?

1124
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,811
有條縫還是什麼的裂開了!
There's a seam opening or something!

1125
01:23:48,755 --> 01:23:51,849
- 大衛.埃姆斯
- 你這混蛋
- David Aames.
- You fucking asshole.

1126
01:23:52,726 --> 01:23:54,523
我知道
I know.

1127
01:25:14,573 --> 01:25:16,473
我剛才在打呼嗎?
Was I snoring?

1128
01:25:20,179 --> 01:25:22,306
沒有,我覺得是我
No, I think it was me.

1129
01:25:22,415 --> 01:25:24,315
我只是口渴了
I was thirsty, that's all.

1130
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,411
我夢見你了
I'm dreaming about you.

1131
01:26:45,173 --> 01:26:47,971
真想一直聽你"嗯"...
I could listen to you say "mmm"...

1132
01:26:48,076 --> 01:26:50,237
就這樣一輩子
for the rest of my life.

1133
01:27:02,691 --> 01:27:04,682
寶貝, 怎麼了?
Baby, what's wrong?

1134
01:27:10,031 --> 01:27:12,397
她在哪?
Where is she?

1135
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:13,559
誰?
Who?

1136
01:27:17,973 --> 01:27:19,702
誰?
Who?

1137
01:27:45,967 --> 01:27:47,366
我是索菲亞
I'm Sofia.

1138
01:27:52,207 --> 01:27:55,574
現在, 我要確定我系了四次
Now, I'm gonna make sure
that I tie it four times.

1139
01:27:55,677 --> 01:27:57,577
你知道為什麼嗎, 茱莉?
You know why,Julie?

1140
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:00,546
因為四次才有意義
Because four times
really means something.

1141
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:02,981
大衛, 別傷害我
David, don't hurt me.

1142
01:28:03,084 --> 01:28:05,746
我怕了, 你真行
I'm freaked out.
It worked.

1143
01:28:05,854 --> 01:28:07,879
你知道你這樣是逃不了的...
You know you're not
gonna get away with this...

1144
01:28:07,989 --> 01:28:09,616
告訴我, 索菲亞在哪
so tell me now,
where is Sofia.

1145
01:28:10,725 --> 01:28:12,454
我就是索菲亞
I am Sofia.

1146
01:28:13,461 --> 01:28:15,088
- 索菲亞在哪?
- 我就是索菲亞!
- Where's Sofia?
- I am Sofia!

1147
01:28:15,196 --> 01:28:17,596
- 她在哪?
- 我就是!
- Where is she?
- I am Sofia!

1148
01:28:17,699 --> 01:28:20,167
我要叫員警, 你可以和他們說
I'm calling the police,
and you can tell it to them.

1149
01:28:20,268 --> 01:28:22,532
- 你從事故中生還了
- 什麼事故?
- You survived the accident.
- What accident?

1150
01:28:22,637 --> 01:28:26,073
那是誰的屍體? 是七矮人的董事會, 是嗎?
Whose body was it?
It was the Seven Dwarfs, wasn't it?

1151
01:28:26,174 --> 01:28:28,904
- 我沒有出事故
- 你還想搶走我的生活!
- I wasn't in an accident.
- You're trying to steal my life!

1152
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:31,137
你當然沒有出事故
Of course you weren't
in an accident.

1153
01:28:31,246 --> 01:28:33,771
現在看來你他媽的是想殺我!
Now it's fucking attempted murder!

1154
01:28:33,882 --> 01:28:36,350
我是索菲亞, 求求你
I'm Sofia. Please.

1155
01:28:37,485 --> 01:28:40,215
和他們說去
Tell it to them.

1156
01:28:40,322 --> 01:28:42,552
我是大衛埃姆斯
This is David Aames.

1157
01:28:42,657 --> 01:28:44,056
我需要幫助
I need help.

1158
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,525
有個入侵者, 我抓住了一個入侵者...
I have an intruder-
I've captured an intruder...

1159
01:28:46,628 --> 01:28:48,118
她闖進我家
who's entered my home.

1160
01:28:48,229 --> 01:28:51,130
天, 醒醒, 老兄
God. Wake up, man.

1161
01:28:53,935 --> 01:28:55,197
你是來真的?
Are you for real?

1162
01:29:04,579 --> 01:29:07,673
讓我在這等了三個鐘, 他們什麼都不說
Kept me waiting here for three hours.
They won't even tell me any news.

1163
01:29:07,782 --> 01:29:10,114
這些傢夥認為這些是我做的
These guys think that I had
something to do with this.

1164
01:29:10,218 --> 01:29:12,186
給我們一分鐘, 好嗎?
Give us a minute here, yeah?

1165
01:29:12,287 --> 01:29:16,018
拉爾森探員, 安德魯探員, 謝謝
Detective Larson, Detective Andrews,
thanks very much.

1166
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,351
他們認為是我做的
They think that I had
something to do with this.

1167
01:29:20,462 --> 01:29:23,363
我會處理這些, 就像你爸會做的那樣
I'm gonna handle this exactly
the way your father would.

1168
01:29:24,566 --> 01:29:25,999
我都解決了
I've got it solved.

1169
01:29:26,801 --> 01:29:28,860
解決了?
You got it solved?

1170
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,733
她在哪?
Where is she?

1171
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,640
她會沒事的. 現在, 所有的檔案都會...
She's gonna be fine.
Now, this whole file is gonna-

1172
01:29:39,147 --> 01:29:41,342
幸好你在這兒, 老兄
Thank God you're here, man.

1173
01:29:41,449 --> 01:29:43,007
沒事了
It's okay.

1174
01:29:43,985 --> 01:29:46,886
- 我愛她
- 是的
- I love her.
- Yeah.

1175
01:29:46,988 --> 01:29:50,549
現在我要你看看這些照片, 然後我就銷毀它們
Right now I want you to look at these
photos, then I'm gonna destroy them.

1176
01:29:50,659 --> 01:29:53,219
索菲亞的證詞也在這兒
Sofia's testimony
is also in here.

1177
01:29:53,328 --> 01:29:55,956
也將不會存在
It won't exist.

1178
01:29:56,064 --> 01:29:58,498
她將不會再提起指控
She's not gonna press charges.

1179
01:30:00,935 --> 01:30:03,096
指控我?
Press charges against me?

1180
01:30:03,204 --> 01:30:05,672
大衛, 醒醒
David, wake up.

1181
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:10,410
現在, 作為一個朋友...
Now, as a friend...

1182
01:30:11,946 --> 01:30:14,540
我覺得你應該看看你對索菲亞做了什麼
I think you should see
what you did to Sofia.

1183
01:30:17,686 --> 01:30:20,680
記者不會找到這裡,如果你快點走的話
The press won't get hold of this
if you get away quickly.

1184
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:26,089
湯米, 這是茱莉, 這不是索菲亞
Tommy, this is Julie.
This is not Sofia.

1185
01:30:27,328 --> 01:30:29,796
這是茱莉.吉雅妮
This is Julie Gianni.

1186
01:30:30,799 --> 01:30:33,768
我沒對她做這些, 湯米, 有人在陷害我
I didn't do this to her.
Tommy, someone's setting me up.

1187
01:30:33,868 --> 01:30:37,929
大衛, 董事會和我會搞定這一切
David, the board and I
have taken care of everything.

1188
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:41,873
好嗎, 他們很了不起, 真的了不起, 事實上
Okay, they've been really great,
really great, actually.

1189
01:30:41,976 --> 01:30:44,206
所有這些都將消失
All this is gonna disappear.

1190
01:30:45,747 --> 01:30:48,443
我們都會支援你, 包括董事會
We're all behind you,
even the board.

1191
01:31:00,762 --> 01:31:02,787
出去吧
Get out of here.

1192
01:31:06,468 --> 01:31:08,800
這是一次心靈的革命
This is a revolution
of the mind.

1193
01:31:17,779 --> 01:31:19,838
你還他媽裝悲傷的樣子!
You're in fuckin' sad shape!

1194
01:31:20,949 --> 01:31:22,849
別他媽的打女人
Don't fucking ever hit a girl.

1195
01:31:22,951 --> 01:31:25,920
打我, 別他媽的打女人
Hit me, but don't fucking ever
hit a girl!

1196
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,920
聽我說, 那不是索菲亞
Listen to me.
It wasn't Sofia.

1197
01:31:28,022 --> 01:31:30,456
是茱莉
It was Julie.

1198
01:31:30,558 --> 01:31:33,584
- 是茱莉
- 是茱莉.吉雅妮?
- It was Julie.
- It was Julie Gianni.

1199
01:31:33,695 --> 01:31:35,629
是的
Yes.

1200
01:31:35,730 --> 01:31:39,097
所以索菲亞是被茱莉綁架了...
So Sofia was abducted by Julie...

1201
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,101
然後茱莉扮成索菲亞
and now Julie is posing
as Sofia.

1202
01:31:44,939 --> 01:31:47,999
你喪心病狂了, 老兄
You're in O.J. land, man.

1203
01:31:48,109 --> 01:31:50,304
茱莉吉雅尼已經他媽的死了!
Julie Gianni is fucking dead!

1204
01:31:50,411 --> 01:31:54,848
我不管他們和你說了什麼,我可以向你保證茱莉還活著
I don't care what they told you,
I can assure you Julie Gianni is alive.

1205
01:31:54,949 --> 01:31:57,144
- 她還活著
- 我都沒和員警談過
- She is alive.
- I didn't talk to them.

1206
01:31:57,252 --> 01:31:59,447
我是和索菲亞談的
I talked to Sofia.

1207
01:32:01,156 --> 01:32:03,215
- 她在哪?
- 我剛送她回家
- Where is she?
- I just dropped Sofia off.

1208
01:32:03,324 --> 01:32:05,121
我看見你對她做的所有事
I saw everything you did to her.

1209
01:32:05,226 --> 01:32:08,286
我告訴你, 我沒那樣對她
Let me tell you something.
I did not do that to her.

1210
01:32:09,397 --> 01:32:12,230
看著我, 看著我的眼睛
Look at me.
Look me in the eye.

1211
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:14,563
告訴我, 她就是那個你帶去派對的女孩
You tell me that's the girl
you brought to the party.

1212
01:32:14,669 --> 01:32:17,638
告訴我她就是你的夢中情人...
You tell me that
that's your dream girl...

1213
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:19,969
你一時的迷戀
your proximity infatuation.

1214
01:32:20,074 --> 01:32:21,803
是的!
Yes!

1215
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:23,969
而你把她從我這偷走了
And you stole her from me.

1216
01:32:24,078 --> 01:32:27,343
我唯一想要的女孩, 你把她偷走了
The one girl I really wanted,
and you took her from me.

1217
01:32:27,448 --> 01:32:30,975
你瘋了, 你不正常了, 老兄
You're insane.
You're losin' it, man.

1218
01:32:31,085 --> 01:32:34,919
- 你露出真面目了
- 噢, 是的
- You have revealed yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

1219
01:32:35,023 --> 01:32:36,923
我和他們一夥的
I'm with them.

1220
01:32:42,363 --> 01:32:44,593
你哪兒弄的大衣, 布萊恩?
Where'd you get the coat, Brian?

1221
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:47,930
哪兒得到的像機?
Where'd you get the camera?

1222
01:32:48,036 --> 01:32:50,163
他們付你多少?
How much did they pay you?

1223
01:32:51,206 --> 01:32:54,539
聽著, 這將是我們最後一次談話
Listen to me, 'cause this is
the last time we're ever gonna speak.

1224
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:57,338
我曾是你唯一的朋友
I was your only friend.

1225
01:32:57,445 --> 01:33:00,107
你終於露出真面目了
You have revealed yourself to me.

1226
01:33:23,338 --> 01:33:24,737
有問題嗎?
Problems?

1227
01:33:26,241 --> 01:33:29,176
我沒心情胡扯, 所以拜託你...
I'm in no mood to be fucked with,
so do yourself a favor-

1228
01:33:29,277 --> 01:33:32,405
我能解釋所有這一切, 大衛
There's an explanation
for all this, David.

1229
01:33:34,015 --> 01:33:37,712
我們互相認識, 你在網路上找到我
You and I know each other.
You found me on the Internet.

1230
01:33:39,153 --> 01:33:41,212
我是來這幫你, 大衛
I'm here to help you, David.

1231
01:33:43,858 --> 01:33:47,294
你他媽的是誰? 為什麼跟蹤我?
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me?

1232
01:33:47,395 --> 01:33:51,525
首先, 你一定要冷靜下來
First of all, it's very important
that you calm down.

1233
01:33:53,001 --> 01:33:54,400
冷靜?
Calm down?

1234
01:33:56,037 --> 01:33:57,402
冷靜
Calm down.

1235
01:33:57,505 --> 01:33:59,939
你必須克服你的恐懼, 做回自己
You must overcome your fears
and regain control.

1236
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:02,441
再次掌控你的生活, 大衛
Take ahold of your life again,
David.

1237
01:34:02,543 --> 01:34:04,443
就像握住那酒杯一樣容易
It's as easy
as holding that glass.

1238
01:34:05,546 --> 01:34:08,674
如果我告訴你會怎樣...你可以控制...
What if I were to tell you
that you can take control...

1239
01:34:08,783 --> 01:34:10,842
所有的這些, 一切
of all of this, everything?

1240
01:34:10,952 --> 01:34:12,351
甚至我
Even me.

1241
01:34:13,988 --> 01:34:16,047
聽著, 我不是同性戀, 好嗎?
Look, I'm straight. Okay?

1242
01:34:20,194 --> 01:34:22,094
大衛, 看看這些人
David, look at all these people.

1243
01:34:23,197 --> 01:34:25,631
他們好像都在聊天, 不是嗎?
Seems as though they're just
all chatting away, doesn't it?

1244
01:34:25,733 --> 01:34:26,791
是的
Yeah.

1245
01:34:26,901 --> 01:34:29,062
- 和你沒關係
- 沒錯
- Nothing to do with you.
- No.

1246
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:30,694
但是...
And yet...

1247
01:34:30,805 --> 01:34:34,536
也許他們在這裡, 只是因為你想要他們在這裡
maybe they're only here because
you wanted them to be here.

1248
01:34:35,677 --> 01:34:36,974
你就是他們的上帝
You are their god.

1249
01:34:37,078 --> 01:34:41,538
不止這樣, 你可以讓他們服從你或毀了你
Not only that, but you can make them
obey you or even destroy you.

1250
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:46,814
好吧, 我想讓他們做的就是他媽的閉嘴
Well, what I'd love for them to do
is shut the fuck up.

1251
01:34:46,921 --> 01:34:48,479
尤其是你
Especially you.

1252
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:02,492
你看
You see?

1253
01:35:14,615 --> 01:35:17,413
我們簽了一份合約, 大衛
You and I
signed a contract, David.

1254
01:35:17,518 --> 01:35:21,454
餐館裡的人是誰? 他是誰?
Who is the man in the restaurant?
Who is it?

1255
01:35:22,423 --> 01:35:24,015
我不知...
I can't-

1256
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:26,093
你能分清夢境和現實嗎?
Can you tell the difference
between dreams and reality?

1257
01:35:26,194 --> 01:35:28,788
- 當然了, 你能嗎?
- 想想看
- Of course. Can you?
- Think about it.

1258
01:35:29,597 --> 01:35:31,622
用腦子想
Think with your head.

1259
01:35:31,899 --> 01:35:33,696
你簽了一份合同...
You signed a contract...

1260
01:35:33,968 --> 01:35:35,367
到底簽了沒有?
did you not?

1261
01:35:37,271 --> 01:35:38,761
我簽了某樣東西
I signed something.

1262
01:35:38,873 --> 01:35:40,773
餐館裡的那個人也在嗎?
Was the man
in the restaurant there?

1263
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:46,111
- 操..
- 順從你身體的抵抗
- Fuck-
- Accept your body's resistance.

1264
01:35:46,214 --> 01:35:48,512
用你的腦子想
Let your head answer.

1265
01:35:49,617 --> 01:35:51,278
簽這合約, 大衛
Sign the contract, David.

1266
01:35:51,386 --> 01:35:52,785
- 是的
- 這就對了
- Yes.
- That's right.

1267
01:35:53,488 --> 01:35:54,477
艾莉是誰?
Who is Ellie?

1268
01:35:57,725 --> 01:36:00,455
- 我不知道什麼是真的
- 那晚發生了什麼?
- I don't know what's real.
- What happened that night?

1269
01:36:00,561 --> 01:36:04,019
- 某個人死了
- 我不想記得
- Somebody died.
- I don't want to remember.

1270
01:36:04,132 --> 01:36:06,157
你掌握著解救自己的關鍵
You hold the keys
to this prison.

1271
01:36:07,101 --> 01:36:09,001
- 那不是索菲亞
- 那是誰?
- It wasn't Sofia.
- Who was it?

1272
01:36:09,804 --> 01:36:10,736
- 不是
- 那是誰?
- No.
- Who was it?

1273
01:36:14,776 --> 01:36:17,006
我好害怕你這麼厲害
I'm afraid of
how powerful this is.

1274
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:21,004
你想要說出來, 不是嗎, 大衛?
You wanna let it out,
don't you, David?

1275
01:36:24,118 --> 01:36:25,847
你就要說了
You're about to tell me.

1276
01:36:27,121 --> 01:36:29,055
告訴我...
Tell me...

1277
01:36:29,157 --> 01:36:32,991
你的內心和靈魂不會允許你忘記
what your heart and soul
will not allow you to forget.

1278
01:36:35,763 --> 01:36:37,663
你殺了索菲亞嗎?
Did you kill Sofia?

1279
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:31,577
我以為你是個破壞者
I thought you were a vandal.

1280
01:37:33,421 --> 01:37:36,117
你是誰?
Who are you?

1281
01:37:40,128 --> 01:37:41,595
我是索菲亞
I'm Sofia.

1282
01:37:43,798 --> 01:37:45,698
你不是...
You are not...

1283
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,062
索菲亞
Sofia.

1284
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
你不是..索菲亞
You are not...Sofia.

1285
01:37:53,574 --> 01:37:54,939
我是索菲亞
I'm Sofia.

1286
01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:56,509
算了
Whatever.

1287
01:37:56,611 --> 01:37:59,239
我們又會在一起了
We're gonna be together again.

1288
01:37:59,347 --> 01:38:03,215
你會忘了茱莉, 和我在一起
You're gonna forget about Juliana
and we're gonna be together.

1289
01:38:03,317 --> 01:38:05,148
我不會再怕你了
I'm not gonna be afraid
of you anymore.

1290
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:09,651
我去給你拿冷毛巾, 馬上回來
I'm gonna get you a cold towel.
I'll be right back.

1291
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:12,024
我愛你
I love you.

1292
01:38:31,412 --> 01:38:33,403
延遲享樂者
Pleasure delayer.

1293
01:38:42,223 --> 01:38:43,281
索菲亞?
Sofia?

1294
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:04,109
我是索菲亞
I am Sofia.

1295
01:39:10,785 --> 01:39:12,184
我愛你
I love you.

1296
01:39:13,588 --> 01:39:15,715
我太想念你了
Oh, I missed you so much.

1297
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:26,798
你到哪去了?
Where were you?

1298
01:39:32,573 --> 01:39:34,268
算了
Forget it.

1299
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:36,275
我不必知道
I don't need to know.

1300
01:39:37,378 --> 01:39:39,278
這沒什麼
It doesn't matter.

1301
01:39:41,082 --> 01:39:43,141
只要告訴我你愛我
Just tell me that you love me.

1302
01:39:48,856 --> 01:39:50,016
我愛你
I love you.

1303
01:39:53,127 --> 01:39:55,425
幸福對你來說是什麼, 大衛?
What is happiness to you, David?

1304
01:39:56,530 --> 01:39:57,690
對我來說...
For me...

1305
01:39:57,798 --> 01:39:59,959
就是在這兒和你在一起
it's being here with you.

1306
01:40:06,207 --> 01:40:08,232
這他媽的...
What the fuck...

1307
01:40:08,342 --> 01:40:10,640
是怎麼回事?
is happening?

1308
01:40:13,381 --> 01:40:15,508
這他媽的怎麼回事?
What is fucking happening?

1309
01:40:15,616 --> 01:40:18,414
大衛真是個可愛的小孩
David was a real delight
as a child.

1310
01:40:22,123 --> 01:40:23,215
噢, 天哪!
Oh, God!

1311
01:40:23,324 --> 01:40:26,623
我很害怕你真厲害!
I'm so afraid
of how powerful this is!

1312
01:40:27,828 --> 01:40:30,126
噢, 大衛!
Oh, David!

1313
01:40:49,226 --> 01:40:52,396
紅禮服, 系帶鞋?
Red dress, strappy shoes?

1314
01:41:00,227 --> 01:41:03,094
這是我聽過的最棒的話
That is the greatest thing
I've ever heard.

1315
01:41:05,066 --> 01:41:07,591
下輩子當我們都是貓的時候
In another life
when we are both cats.

1316
01:41:14,108 --> 01:41:15,268
怎麼回事?
What's happening?

1317
01:41:17,812 --> 01:41:19,780
嘿, 老兄, 怎麼回事?
Hey, man, what's happening?

1318
01:41:23,984 --> 01:41:26,043
你這婊子!
You bitch!

1319
01:41:28,122 --> 01:41:31,216
我不想看見你的臉!
I don't wanna see your face!

1320
01:42:39,794 --> 01:42:41,694
是我幹的, 對吧?
I did it, didn't I?

1321
01:42:44,298 --> 01:42:47,199
但我沒覺得我殺過人
But I don't feel
like I killed someone.

1322
01:42:50,504 --> 01:42:52,233
- 大衛...
- 我覺得...
- David...
- I feel like...

1323
01:42:52,339 --> 01:42:55,035
- 那個男人是誰...
- 我像在夢中
- who was the man...
- I'm in a dream.

1324
01:42:55,142 --> 01:42:57,042
餐館裡的那個?
at the restaurant?

1325
01:43:15,329 --> 01:43:17,058
有時候...
Sometimes...

1326
01:43:17,164 --> 01:43:19,428
大腦的行為讓你覺得就像在做夢
the mind behaves
as if it were in a dream.

1327
01:43:19,533 --> 01:43:22,593
面孔變換, 一個人變成另一個
Faces change.
People become other people.

1328
01:43:24,705 --> 01:43:27,265
潛意識是很強烈的
The subconscious
is a powerful thing.

1329
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:31,910
你對茱莉沒興趣, 不是嗎?
You treated Julie carelessly,
didn't you?

1330
01:43:42,056 --> 01:43:45,958
你對她抱有負罪感...
Your feelings of responsibility
or guilt over Julie...

1331
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,460
很容易把索菲亞當成茱莉
might have easily
turned Sofia into Julie.

1332
01:43:51,765 --> 01:43:53,665
你知道精神錯亂是什麼嗎?
Do you know what derangement is?

1333
01:43:54,568 --> 01:43:56,934
我需要你説明
I need your help.

1334
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:01,072
我所知道的就是,你殺了你的女朋友...
All I know is,
you killed your girlfriend...

1335
01:44:01,175 --> 01:44:04,008
我不知道你想的是什麼
and I don't know
what's in your mind.

1336
01:44:04,111 --> 01:44:05,601
我需要你説明
I need your help.

1337
01:44:05,713 --> 01:44:09,774
我會一直跟進這案子如果可以的話, 但我們沒時間了
I would work on this case forever
if I could, but we're out of time.

1338
01:44:15,055 --> 01:44:16,454
你會以什麼做辯詞?
What will you plead?

1339
01:44:20,628 --> 01:44:22,027
暫時性神經失常
Temporary derangement.

1340
01:44:24,031 --> 01:44:25,862
這是最好的說法
That's your best chance.

1341
01:44:27,535 --> 01:44:30,026
我不認為他們會相信我
I don't think they'll believe me.

1342
01:44:31,105 --> 01:44:32,868
你相信什麼?
What do you believe?

1343
01:44:34,842 --> 01:44:37,242
無論相信什麼, 我很關心你
Believe it or not,
I care about you.

1344
01:44:41,982 --> 01:44:44,576
你對我來說已經像家人一樣
You've become like family to me.

1345
01:44:47,855 --> 01:44:52,258
我不想放棄你, 大衛, 但我需要瞭解更多
I don't want to give up on you,
David, but I needed more.

1346
01:44:52,359 --> 01:44:54,156
我需要...
I needed-

1347
01:44:54,261 --> 01:44:56,388
我需要一個答案
I needed an answer.

1348
01:44:56,497 --> 01:44:59,625
我的意思是, 我覺得會有一個更好的理由...
I mean, I even thought there was
more than a good chance...

1349
01:44:59,733 --> 01:45:01,633
有人在陷害你
somebody was playing
a trick on you.

1350
01:45:01,735 --> 01:45:04,033
也許是董事會
Maybe it was the board.

1351
01:45:04,138 --> 01:45:06,868
但這已經超過我的職責
But I can't exceed my duties.

1352
01:45:11,879 --> 01:45:13,779
我只是個心理學家
I'm just a psychologist.

1353
01:45:16,317 --> 01:45:18,683
我也得走了
And I have to go now.

1354
01:45:22,222 --> 01:45:24,884
審訊的時候再見?
Will I see you at the trial?

1355
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,559
不, 我只...
No, I'm-

1356
01:45:28,696 --> 01:45:30,596
我只算是個開場
I'm just the opening act.

1357
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:53,953
"讓您安心是我們的專長, 這是我們生命延續的信條"
Reassurance is our specialty.
That is the Life Extension credo.

1358
01:46:02,596 --> 01:46:05,622
"班尼是一條曾被凍了三個月的小狗..."
Benny is a dog who was frozen
for three months...

1359
01:46:05,733 --> 01:46:07,860
"解凍後過上了正常的生活"
and thawed out

1360
01:46:07,968 --> 01:46:11,631
"生命延續也能用在人類的形式上"
Life Extension can translate
to the human form too.

1361

"你如何辦到這些?"
How do you accomplish
such a thing?

1362
01:46:15,275 --> 01:46:18,403
"72個冷凍的病人..."
Seventy-two cryonized patients...

1363

"目前保存在新不倫瑞克省我們的收容中心裡"
are currently held at our facility
in New Brunswick.

1364
01:46:21,949 --> 01:46:26,386
"我們擁有世界上最好的科技人員"
And we feature the finest scientific
technicians on the planet.

1365

1369

我們有法院許可
We hold a court order.

1370
01:47:23,711 --> 01:47:25,611
我想我之前來過這裡
I think I've been here before.

1371
01:47:38,926 --> 01:47:40,393
她叫莉比
Her name is Libby.

1372
01:47:40,494 --> 01:47:42,052
早上好, 麥凱布先生
Good morning, Mr. McCabe.

1373
01:47:42,896 --> 01:47:45,296
我是莉比, 讓我為你效勞
I'm Libby.
I'm here to assist you.

1374
01:47:46,967 --> 01:47:49,868
他是我兒子, 他很害羞
He's my son.
He's very shy.

1375
01:47:49,970 --> 01:47:54,339
你不是媒體或法律協會的, 是吧?
You're not with the media or a part
of any legal consortium, correct?

1376
01:47:54,441 --> 01:47:55,874
不是
No.

1377
01:47:56,477 --> 01:47:58,342
歡迎來到生命延續
Welcome to Life Extension.

Take a look at our proposal.
Please follow me.

1379
01:48:01,448 --> 01:48:03,348
你可以在外面等著
You can wait out here.

1380
01:48:04,451 --> 01:48:06,681
你們會去見麗蓓嘉.迪爾伯恩...
You'll be meeting
Rebecca Dearborn...

1381
01:48:06,787 --> 01:48:08,846
我心目中的榜樣
my personal role model.

1382
01:48:10,891 --> 01:48:13,792
我不想再要痛苦, 我已經受夠了
I didn't need the pain anymore.
I already experienced that.

1383
01:48:13,894 --> 01:48:17,352
他們想要你倒下死掉, 生命延續想要你生存
They want you to lay down and die.
Life Extension wants you to live.

1384
01:48:20,067 --> 01:48:23,298
我不認為上帝不同意這麼做
I don't think that God
disapproves of this.

body at extremely low temperatures."

I'm Rebecca Dearborn.

1390
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:44,289
生命延續, 或者我們更喜歡稱為LE...
Life Extension,
or LE as we like to refer to it...

1391
01:48:44,391 --> 01:48:45,881
是對未來的展望...
is a glimpse of the future.

1392
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,788
是一張入場券...
It's a ticket.

1393
01:48:47,895 --> 01:48:51,729
非膚淺的, 而是極有意義的...
Not in the juvenile sense, but
in the deeply meaningful sense...

1394
01:48:51,832 --> 01:48:54,062
深入人類內心的探索
that can only be born
in the human heart.

1395
01:48:57,237 --> 01:48:59,967
人體的DNA代碼已被破解
The DNA codes of the human body
have been broken.

1396

很快, 心臟病, 癌症...
Soon, heart ailments, cancer...

1397
01:49:02,609 --> 01:49:04,668
很多都會成為過去
so much more
will be a thing of the past.

1398
01:49:05,445 --> 01:49:08,812
非常簡單,你的痛苦, 你的不滿...
Very simply,
your anguish, your discontent...

1399
01:49:08,916 --> 01:49:11,510
甚至你的死亡, 都不再發生...
even your death
is no longer necessary...

1400
01:49:11,618 --> 01:49:13,347
...於傳統的概念裡
in a traditional sense.

1401
01:49:13,453 --> 01:49:17,753
無論是什麼疾病掩藏在那面具後面, 它都是暫時的
Whatever malady hides behind
that mask, it's temporary.

1402
01:49:19,026 --> 01:49:20,926
在你死去一小時內...
Within an hour of your passing...

1403
01:49:21,028 --> 01:49:24,122
LE將把你的身體轉移到一個容器裡...
LE will transfer your body
to a vessel...

1404
01:49:24,231 --> 01:49:28,827
在那裡你將被密封, 並用-196度低溫冰凍
where you will be sealed and frozen
at 196 degrees below zero.

1405
01:49:28,936 --> 01:49:30,870
斷電, 地震...
Power outtages, earthquakes-

1406

沒有任何事會影響你的掛起式休眠
nothing will affect
your suspension hibernation.

Did you sign a contract
with these people, David?

1409

For a little extra...

1413

"冰凍樂"
"Cryo-tainment."

1416

也許這解釋會有幫助

# 有一個宇宙 #

Imagine that you are suffering
from a terminal illness.

You'd like to be cryonized,
but you'd rather be resurrected...

1424
01:50:34,167 --> 01:50:37,398
繼續目前你所熟悉的生活

一旦復活...
Upon resurrection...

01:50:42,509 --> 01:50:45,069
你將繼續以永恆的狀態...

死亡將從你的記憶中抹去
Your death will be wiped
from your memory.

Your life will continue as
a realistic work of art...

1432
01:50:57,124 --> 01:50:59,456

of a great movie...

1435
01:51:06,233 --> 01:51:08,633
或流行音樂一樣
or a pop song you always loved-

1436
01:51:08,735 --> 01:51:10,566
有關這是如何發生的記憶...
with no memory
of how it all occurred...

1437
01:51:10,671 --> 01:51:12,536
都不會被保存下來...
save for the knowledge...

1438
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:16,735
一切都只是更完美
that everything simply improved.

1439
01:51:16,843 --> 01:51:18,743
有任何疑惑的地方...
In any instance
of discontent...

1440
01:51:18,845 --> 01:51:21,575
你都會獲得技術支援
you'll be visited
by technical support.

1441
01:51:21,682 --> 01:51:23,445
一切指日可待
It's all just around the corner.

1442
01:51:23,550 --> 01:51:28,954
在不久的將來, 另一個篇章將無縫的展開
The day after tomorrow,
another chapter begins seamlessly.

1443
01:51:29,056 --> 01:51:30,956
一個逼真的夢境
A living dream.

1444
01:51:31,058 --> 01:51:33,549
生命延續將向您提供
[ 清晰夢境 ]
Life Extension's promise to you.
"Lucid Dream"

1445
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:35,560
生命, 第二章
Life, part two.

1446
01:51:35,662 --> 01:51:37,425
一個逼真的夢境
A living dream.

1447
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:43,792
"死亡將從你的記憶中抹去"
"Your death will be
wiped from your memory."

1448
01:51:43,904 --> 01:51:45,929
我覺得我錯過了<今日美國>的這篇的報導
I guess I missed that one
in USA Today.

1449
01:51:46,039 --> 01:51:47,097
夢境
A dream.

1450
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:52,845
要是出錯了呢?
What if there was a mistake?

1451
01:51:52,946 --> 01:51:55,972
美夢變成了噩夢怎麼辦?
What if the dream
became a nightmare?

1452
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:00,811
當然你的潛意識總在幹擾你
Of course your subconscious
can always play tricks on you.

1453
01:52:02,489 --> 01:52:05,481
它是個力量很強的東西
The subconscious
is a very powerful thing.

1454
01:52:09,529 --> 01:52:12,191
你和這些人簽合同了嗎, 大衛?
Did you sign a contract
with these people, David?

1455
01:52:12,299 --> 01:52:14,699
這是個嚴肅的生意
But this is a serious business.

1456
01:52:16,436 --> 01:52:19,803
"清晰夢境"值得去冒險
The Lucid Dream
is worth the risk.

1457
01:52:20,807 --> 01:52:23,537
生命不去追求夢想那會是什麼?
And what is any life
if not the pursuit of a dream?

1458
01:52:24,644 --> 01:52:26,111
夢想著和平...
The dream of peace...

1459
01:52:26,213 --> 01:52:28,773
夢想著成就...
the dream of achievement...

1460
01:52:30,417 --> 01:52:33,614
夢想有人和你說那些話語...
the dream of hearing someone
say these words...

1461
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:36,018
當你聽到她們真心的說...
when they really,
truly mean them.

1462
01:52:39,092 --> 01:52:41,117
我愛你, 大衛
I love you, David.

1463
01:52:44,831 --> 01:52:45,661
我愛你
I love you.

1464
01:52:49,569 --> 01:52:51,400
釋放自己, 大衛
Roam free, David.

1465
01:52:51,505 --> 01:52:54,269
我們大多數人的一生...
Most of us
live our whole lives...

1466
01:52:54,374 --> 01:52:57,571
都沒有真正的冒險是屬於自己的
without any real adventure
to call our own.

1467
01:52:57,677 --> 01:53:00,510
這令人難以理解
It's hard to comprehend.

1468
01:53:00,614 --> 01:53:04,378
"但人們也嘲笑過儒勒.凡爾納" (大衛剛說過)
"But they laughed
at Jules Verne too."

1469
01:53:05,919 --> 01:53:07,216
這...
This...

1470
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,719
是一場革命...
is a revolution...

1471
01:53:08,822 --> 01:53:10,380
...關於心靈的
of the mind.

1472
01:53:31,311 --> 01:53:33,006
我要醒過來!
I wanna wake up!

1473
01:53:34,047 --> 01:53:35,537
技術員!
Tech support!

1474
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:37,678
嘿, 怪物!
Hey! Face!

1475
01:53:39,619 --> 01:53:42,110
這是個噩夢!
It's a nightmare!

1476
01:53:58,672 --> 01:54:01,800
技術員!
Tech support!

1477
01:54:16,923 --> 01:54:20,984
技術員!
Tech support!

1478
01:54:56,663 --> 01:54:58,096
大衛.埃姆斯
David Aames.

1479
01:54:59,432 --> 01:55:01,832
我想是時候正式的自我介紹了
I think it's time we had
a proper reintroduction.

1480
01:55:01,935 --> 01:55:05,098
我是艾德蒙.文圖拉, 來自綠洲計畫
I'm Edmund Ventura
from the Oasis Project.

1481
01:55:05,205 --> 01:55:07,537
原名生命延續, LE
Formerly Life Extension, LE.

1482
01:55:07,641 --> 01:55:09,666
- 技術員
- 是的
- Tech support.
- Yes.

1483
01:55:09,776 --> 01:55:11,676
是的, 我是你的技術支援...
Yes, I'm your tech support...

1484
01:55:11,778 --> 01:55:15,179
我們第一次見面是在150年前
and we first met
150 years ago.

1485
01:55:15,282 --> 01:55:17,614
哇, 靠
Oh, shit.

1486
01:55:17,717 --> 01:55:19,810
你向我推銷清晰夢境
You sold me the Lucid Dream.

1487
01:55:21,955 --> 01:55:23,684
他媽的發生了什麼事?
What the hell happened?

1488
01:55:23,790 --> 01:55:26,122
我試圖在酒吧裡警告你
I tried to warn you in the bar.

1489
01:55:26,226 --> 01:55:30,356
我告訴你必須運用控制, 一切取決於你的意志
I told you you must exercise control,
that it all depended on your mind.

1490
01:55:31,031 --> 01:55:32,521
所有這些...
All of this...

1491
01:55:32,632 --> 01:55:34,827
都是你的想像創造出來的
everything is your creation.

1492
01:55:34,935 --> 01:55:37,836
現在我們將迎來你抉擇的時刻
And now we're heading toward
your true moment of choice.

1493
01:55:38,872 --> 01:55:40,567
抉擇的時刻?
True moment of choice?

1494
01:55:40,674 --> 01:55:41,732
是的
Yes.

1495
01:55:46,913 --> 01:55:48,904
我什麼時候開始清晰夢境的?
When did the Lucid Dream begin?

1496
01:55:49,015 --> 01:55:50,915
記得夜總會那天嗎?
Remember the day
of the nightclub?

1497
01:55:51,017 --> 01:55:52,382
我們很快會再見的
We'll meet up soon.

1498
01:55:54,254 --> 01:55:57,781
那晚, 索菲亞離開後你睡倒在路邊...
That night, after Sofia left you and
you fell asleep on the pavement...

1499
01:55:57,891 --> 01:56:01,156
就是那個時刻, 你選擇作為拼接
that was the moment
that you chose for the splice.

1500
01:56:01,261 --> 01:56:04,059
- 拼接?
- 拼接
- Splice?
- Splice.

1501
01:56:04,164 --> 01:56:07,759
記憶中真實生活的結束, 清晰夢境的開始
The end of your real life and
the beginning of LE's Lucid Dream.

1502
01:56:07,867 --> 01:56:10,768
對接過去了很多很多年...
A splice of many, many years
which passed...

1503
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:13,202
期間你都是在冰凍和夢中
while you were frozen
and dreaming.

1504
01:56:13,306 --> 01:56:15,536
那個時刻你從街上醒來...
From the moment
you woke up on that street...

1505
01:56:15,642 --> 01:56:17,837
就沒有任何傳統觀念上的真實了
nothing was real
in the traditional sense.

1506
01:56:17,944 --> 01:56:19,377
睜開你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

1507
01:56:19,479 --> 01:56:22,380
你的清晰夢境一直被"生命延續"監控...
Your Lucid Dream
is monitored by Life Extension...

1508
01:56:22,482 --> 01:56:25,679
一個專家小組在跟蹤你的每個想法...
and a panel of experts who are
following your every thought...

1509
01:56:25,785 --> 01:56:27,753
包括這個時刻
even at this moment.

1510
01:56:29,889 --> 01:56:31,914
抱歉, 搞得你很頭大
Forgive me.
I'm blowing your mind.

1511
01:56:35,962 --> 01:56:37,896
我可不喜歡這麼高
I'm not a big fan of heights.

1512
01:56:39,366 --> 01:56:40,856
我知道
I know.

1513
01:56:40,967 --> 01:56:43,765
我們從你記憶中消除了實際發生的事
We erased what really happened
from your memory.

1514
01:56:44,304 --> 01:56:46,772
- 消除?
- 是替換...
- Erased?
- Replaced.

1515
01:56:46,873 --> 01:56:48,431
...用一個更好的生活
By a better life...

1516
01:56:48,541 --> 01:56:50,202
在這個...
under these...

1517
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:52,870
美麗的...莫內所鍾愛的天空下
beautiful, Monet-like skies.

1518
01:56:54,214 --> 01:56:55,613
我母親的最愛
My mother's favorite.

1519
01:56:56,549 --> 01:57:00,041
更好的生活...因為你擁有索菲亞
A better life
because you had Sofia.

1520
01:57:00,153 --> 01:57:04,185
你用年輕時的記憶構築著你的夢
You sculpted your Lucid Dream out
of the iconography of your youth.

1521
01:57:04,291 --> 01:57:07,551
比如一張曾讓你感動的唱片封面
An album cover
that once moved you.

1522
01:57:07,794 --> 01:57:08,886
唱片封面?
An album cover?

1523
01:57:08,995 --> 01:57:10,257
"有些事...
There are some things...

1524
01:57:10,363 --> 01:57:13,264
你還沒到年齡去瞭解"
that you're not old enough
to understand just yet.

1525
01:57:13,366 --> 01:57:17,632
一些電影向你展示了父親是怎樣的...
A movie you saw once that showed you
what a father could be like...

1526
01:57:28,248 --> 01:57:30,648
...或者愛是怎樣的
or what love could be like.

1527
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:32,274
而某個女孩...
This was a kind woman...

1528
01:57:32,385 --> 01:57:35,115
特別的...
an individual...

1529
01:57:35,221 --> 01:57:37,451
...超過你的想像
more than your equal.

1530
01:57:37,557 --> 01:57:41,584
你只在現實中認識她, 但在夢中...
You barely knew her in real life,
but in your Lucid Dream...

1531
01:57:41,695 --> 01:57:43,595
...她是你的精神寄託
she was your savior.

1532
01:57:48,068 --> 01:57:51,196
現實中我怎麼了? 發生了些事
What happened in my real life?
Something happened.

1533
01:57:51,304 --> 01:57:52,703
你消除了什麼?
What did you erase?

1534
01:57:52,806 --> 01:57:54,398
你真想知道?
Do you really want to know?

1535
01:57:56,876 --> 01:57:58,434
把一切告訴我
Tell me everything.

1536
01:57:59,646 --> 01:58:02,547
夜總會的第二天早晨, 你在街上醒來...
The morning after the nightclub,
you woke up on that street...

1537
01:58:02,649 --> 01:58:04,446
一個人還帶著宿醉
hung over and alone.

1538
01:58:04,551 --> 01:58:06,178
你站起來, 然後離開
You got up, walked away.

1539
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:09,980
你再也沒見過索菲亞
You never saw Sofia again.

1540
01:58:16,062 --> 01:58:18,053
我沒殺索菲亞
I didn't kill Sofia.

1541
01:58:19,742 --> 01:58:21,110
沒有
No.

1542
01:58:21,568 --> 01:58:25,066
你為了控制公司與董事會對抗
You battled your board
for control of the company...

1543
01:58:26,606 --> 01:58:29,473
最後是湯瑪斯.提普, 你父親的朋友...
and in the end it was Thomas Tipp,
your father's friend...

1544
01:58:29,576 --> 01:58:31,305
...你保住他工作的那個人...
the man whose job you saved...

1545
01:58:31,411 --> 01:58:34,244
...讓公司回到你的控制
who wrenched the company
back into your control.

1546
01:58:35,348 --> 01:58:36,747
湯米
Tommy.

1547
01:58:38,318 --> 01:58:39,717
可是後來...
But then...

1548
01:58:40,954 --> 01:58:43,582
有人...死了
somebody died.

1549
01:58:45,859 --> 01:58:48,327
你思念索菲亞
You longed for Sofia.

1550
01:58:48,428 --> 01:58:50,589
與世隔絕數月
You shut yourself away for months.

1551
01:58:50,697 --> 01:58:52,255
你感到孤獨
You were alone.

1552
01:58:52,365 --> 01:58:55,926
你再也忍受不了頭痛的痛苦
You couldn't stand
the pain anymore, the headaches.

1553
01:58:56,035 --> 01:58:57,559
你幾乎崩潰
You could barely function.

1554
01:58:58,605 --> 01:59:00,766
我在網路上找到你
I found you on the Internet.

1555
01:59:04,611 --> 01:59:07,205
我和你簽了份合同然後...
I signed a contract with you,
and then-

1556
01:59:28,635 --> 01:59:30,034
我記得了
I remember.

1557
01:59:39,712 --> 01:59:41,612
有人死了
Somebody died.

1558
01:59:43,349 --> 01:59:44,873
那就是我
It was me.

1559
01:59:52,058 --> 01:59:55,221
十二月晚些時候...
And on a day in late December...

1560
01:59:55,328 --> 01:59:57,319
你把自己交給我們
you gave yourself to us.

1561
01:59:59,866 --> 02:00:02,334
你進入了休眠的狀態
You're now in a suspended state.

1562
02:00:06,539 --> 02:00:10,999
你的朋友布萊恩.謝比在你的舊屋子舉辦了三天紀念會
Your friend Brian Shelby threw a
three-day memorial in your old home.

1563
02:00:11,110 --> 02:00:13,010
他是個真正的朋友
He was a true friend.

1564
02:00:22,555 --> 02:00:24,614
大家都想念你, 大衛
You were missed, David.

1565
02:00:47,013 --> 02:00:50,573
索菲亞始終沒能從悲傷中恢復過來
It was Sofia
who never fully recovered.

1566
02:00:51,818 --> 02:00:54,719
她似乎是最瞭解你的人...
It was she who somehow
knew you best...

1567
02:00:55,822 --> 02:00:58,723
和你一樣, 她永遠也忘不了那個晚上...
and like you, she never
forgot that one night...

1568
02:00:58,825 --> 02:01:01,726
真愛幾乎就要出現
where true love seemed possible.

1569
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:13,370
往往最重要的, 大衛...
Consequences, David.

1570
02:01:29,422 --> 02:01:32,322
...都是那些小事
It's the little things.

1571
02:01:35,762 --> 02:01:37,662
小事
The little things.

1572
02:01:39,198 --> 02:01:41,598
根本就沒什麼大事, 是吧?
There's nothing bigger,
is there?

1573
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:53,911
你的潛意識的確造成了麻煩
Your subconscious
did create problems.

1574
02:01:55,348 --> 02:01:57,578
美夢變成了噩夢
Your dream
turned into a nightmare.

1575
02:01:58,751 --> 02:02:01,413
不過現在問題解決了
The glitch has been corrected.

1576
02:02:02,755 --> 02:02:05,383
所以我只要想像某個事物
So all I have to do
is imagine something.

1577
02:02:05,491 --> 02:02:07,391
比如, 如果我要...
Like, if I wanted...

1578
02:02:07,493 --> 02:02:09,484
麥凱布現在就回來
McCabe to come back right now-

1579
02:02:13,499 --> 02:02:15,296
聽著
Listen to me.

1580
02:02:15,401 --> 02:02:17,096
這些人很危險
These people are dangerous.

1581
02:02:18,371 --> 02:02:21,807
我們有麻煩了, 現在必須離開這屋頂
We're in trouble.
We need to get off this roof now.

1582
02:02:25,278 --> 02:02:27,178
現在我們暫停...
We're now on pause...

1583
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,771
你將回到你的夢中
and you're about to return
to your Lucid Dream.

1584
02:02:29,882 --> 02:02:31,713
所有事都會更新...
With all the upgrades...

1585
02:02:31,818 --> 02:02:33,718
你不會記得所有這些...
you won't remember any of this...

1586
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:36,584
也不會為這次技術支援付費
nor will you be charged
for technical support.

1587
02:02:36,689 --> 02:02:39,214
現在就是你抉擇的時刻
It's now your moment of choice.

1588
02:02:40,326 --> 02:02:43,818
你可以回到夢中過著美麗的生活...
You can return to your Lucid Dream
and live a beautiful life...

1589
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:47,764
...和索菲亞或者你希望的任何人
with Sofia or whomever you wish...

1590
02:02:47,867 --> 02:02:51,166
或者你可以選擇這外面的世界
or you can choose
the world out there.

1591
02:02:53,272 --> 02:02:55,172
"外面的世界"
"The world out there."

1592
02:02:56,709 --> 02:02:58,609
你可以讓我回到...
And you can bring me back...

1593
02:02:58,711 --> 02:03:00,770
就像小狗班尼那樣?
just like Benny the dog?

1594
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:01,938
是的
Yes.

1595
02:03:02,048 --> 02:03:05,415
就像小狗班尼那樣
Just like Benny the dog.

1596
02:03:06,386 --> 02:03:08,980
當然現在你的臉和身體都能被復原
Your face and body
can be fixed now, of course.

1597
02:03:10,056 --> 02:03:13,457
但現實事情會大不一樣
But things
are very different now...

1598
02:03:13,559 --> 02:03:15,789
你的財富不會一直持有
and your finances
won't last long.

1599
02:03:17,163 --> 02:03:20,394
觀察小組正等待你的決定
Your panel of observers
are waiting for you to choose.

1600
02:03:25,238 --> 02:03:27,138
這沒有任何保證...
There are no guarantees...

1601
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:28,537
但記住...
but remember...

1602
02:03:28,641 --> 02:03:30,666
即使是在未來...
even in the future...

1603
02:03:30,777 --> 02:03:33,712
甜蜜也不會是甜蜜...
the sweet is never as sweet...

1604
02:03:33,813 --> 02:03:36,213
...如果沒嘗過心酸的話
without the sour.

1605
02:03:54,133 --> 02:03:55,657
我該怎麼醒過來?
How do I wake up?

1606
02:03:56,269 --> 02:03:58,169
這是你決定的
The decision is yours.

1607
02:04:03,109 --> 02:04:05,805
這個地方也是我選擇的, 不是嗎?
And I chose this scenario,
didn't I?

1608
02:04:07,346 --> 02:04:12,306
是的, 去面對你僅存的對高度的恐懼
Yes, to face your last
remaining fear of heights.

1609
02:04:12,418 --> 02:04:14,352
大衛, 別信他們
David, don't listen to him.

1610
02:04:14,454 --> 02:04:17,355
你說得對, 這都是七矮人, 這是個圈套
You were right. This is
the seven dwarfs. It's a setup!

1611
02:04:17,457 --> 02:04:19,891
你不能相信他
You can't trust him.

1612
02:04:19,992 --> 02:04:24,088
別為他感到不爽, 大衛, 這人是你創造出來的
Don't feel bad for him, David.
This winning man is your creation.

1613
02:04:24,197 --> 02:04:28,099
他本能的去爭取他的存在, 但他不是真的
It's in his nature to fight for
his existence, but he's not real.

1614
02:04:28,201 --> 02:04:29,600
我是真的
I'm real.

1615
02:04:32,472 --> 02:04:33,700
我是真的
I'm real.

1616
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:36,531
我有兩個女兒...
I have two daughters...

1617
02:04:36,642 --> 02:04:38,166
你知道的
and you know that.

1618
02:04:39,278 --> 02:04:40,870
她們的名字是什麼?
What are their names?

1619
02:04:55,661 --> 02:04:57,060
我是真的
I'm real.

1620
02:05:02,268 --> 02:05:05,328
我只是家庭娛樂的犧牲品?
I'm mortality
as home entertainment?

1621
02:05:05,438 --> 02:05:07,338
這不可能是我的命運
This cannot be the future!

1622
02:05:09,809 --> 02:05:10,867
可能嗎?
Can it?

1623
02:05:12,979 --> 02:05:14,139
可能嗎?
Can it?

1624
02:05:42,775 --> 02:05:44,504
再見
Good-bye.

1625
02:05:47,547 --> 02:05:50,812
這是一場自我覺醒的偉大旅程
It's been a brilliant journey
of self-awakening.

1626
02:05:50,917 --> 02:05:54,284
現在你只需要問問自己
And now you've simply got to
ask yourself this-

1627
02:05:54,387 --> 02:05:56,981
幸福對你來說是什麼, 大衛?
What is happiness to you, David?

1628
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:06,330
我想過真實的生活
I want to live a real life.

1629
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:09,866
我不想再做夢
I don't want to dream any longer.

1630
02:06:10,937 --> 02:06:13,496
最後還有什麼願望嗎?
Any last wishes?

1631
02:06:15,608 --> 02:06:19,008
就讓他們知道我的想法吧
Let them out there
read my mind.

1632
02:06:19,779 --> 02:06:21,679
祝你好運, 大衛
I wish you well, David.

1633
02:07:01,988 --> 02:07:04,286
瞧瞧我們
Look at us.

1634
02:07:04,390 --> 02:07:06,290
我被冰凍, 你卻死了
I'm frozen, and you're dead.

1635
02:07:07,493 --> 02:07:09,017
而我愛你
And I love you.

1636
02:07:11,030 --> 02:07:12,429
這是個問題
It's a problem.

1637
02:07:16,369 --> 02:07:18,769
我上了那輛車後就失去了你
I lost you
when I got in that car.

1638
02:07:19,872 --> 02:07:21,396
對不起
I'm sorry.

1639
02:07:23,676 --> 02:07:26,668
你還記得曾經對我說過的嗎?
Do you remember
what you told me once?

1640
02:07:27,513 --> 02:07:29,674
每一分鐘...
That every passing minute...

1641
02:07:30,917 --> 02:07:33,818
都有可能會改變一切
is another chance
to turn it all around.

1642
02:07:39,258 --> 02:07:41,158
我會再找到你的
I'll find you again.

1643
02:07:57,877 --> 02:08:00,471
下輩子我會再遇見你...
I'll see you in another life...

1644
02:08:00,579 --> 02:08:02,809
當我們都是貓的時候
when we are both cats.

1645
02:09:14,987 --> 02:09:16,921
放輕鬆, 大衛
Relax, David.

1646
02:09:17,023 --> 02:09:18,320
睜開你的眼睛
Open your eyes.

1647
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:36,500
追悼會上那首歌名是: 
Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space
(我們漂浮在宇宙中)
