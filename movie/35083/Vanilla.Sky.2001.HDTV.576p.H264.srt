there in front of me.

You know what happened?
Your life flashed before my eyes.

99

- How was it?
- Almost worth dying for.

100

We're at the front door.
We're coming up now.

- Morning, sir. Sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

102
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:09,751
- Eaten anything yet?
- No.

103

(Woman) David, you were playing
racquetball.

Hello, David.

108
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:26,084
You're in "The Post". Courtney Love
called to see if you got her e-mail

109
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:29,829
and Graydon Carter called to see
if you're still on for dinner.

110
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:34,503
The art department still need the decision
on the colours for the bikini issue.

111
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:37,421
Did I mention the board is pissed?
You're late.

112
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:41,028
David, hold up!
Choose one!

113
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:43,562
Wait! This one? David!

114
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:46,062
They're all waiting for you.

115
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,373
- You changed your hair.
- Yes, and David...

116
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,631
...opinions are expected.

117
00:09:58,686 --> 00:10:00,199
David.

118
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:04,799
Do you dream about the board,
the Seven Dwarfs as you call them?

119
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:08,145
Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy,

120
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:13,807
Happy, Doc, Dopey
and, of course, Grumpy.

121
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:17,483
- How was Aspen?
- Good.

122
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:21,106
Now, I want answers
and I want them now.

123
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:30,114
How's it going?

124
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:33,743
'They still look at me
as if I was 11 years old.'

He's going to inherit everything.
He gets it all.

126

- Are you scared of your dreams?
- It's a nightmare either way.

127
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,636
Is that how you explain
what's happened to you?

128
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,953
What happened to your face?

129
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:51,727
- I'm not talking to you any more.
- You don't want to show me your face?

130
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,608
(Shouts) No!

131
00:10:57,182 --> 00:11:00,333
- Do you know why you're here?
- The conversation, the coffee...

132
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:03,284
David, the part where we parry and joust

133
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:07,844
and get to know each other
bit by bit... No can do.

134
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:12,316
We'll have to skip that because
you've been charged with murder.

135
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:16,939
In four weeks, a judge will determine
your fate based on what I write.

136
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:20,923
- So you will talk to me.
- There is no murder.

137
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,049
(Shouts) There is no murder!

138
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,829
It never happened.

139
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:31,641
I don't have to talk to anybody!

140
00:11:31,937 --> 00:11:34,371
- Want me to help?
- Get away from me.

141

Easy, Face!
Your whole story's full of holes!

142
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:41,992
Stop. Stop! Please leave right now.
I'll take responsibility.

143
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,600
Please leave right now.
He's got control.

daddy's boy, little freak!

145

- Enough!

146
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:56,900
- Is that true?
- Good cop, bad cop.

"David Junior was a delight as a child."

159
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:39,374
Did I miss something here?
Is that all he wrote about you?

160
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:42,821
I don't think he ever got over the fact

161
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,825
that I'm absolutely terrified
of heights.

162
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,951
The irony continues.

163
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:56,238
When he and my mother were run over
by a drunken teenager

164
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:59,386
on New Year's Eve, ten years ago,

165
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:02,992
he left the keys to the kingdom...

166
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:05,420
...to me.

167
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:14,185
who all thought they were first in line.

168
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:17,573
And you believe the board,
the Seven Dwarfs,

169
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:21,024
put you here to take control
of your company?

170
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:27,143
- What do you care?
- We're just talking.

171
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:30,635
Tonight's Wednesday night.

172
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,405
I go out for dinner with my
two daughters on Wednesday,

173
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,686
so I'll have to leave soon.

174
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,774
You understand that our time
is limited, don't you?

175
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:45,274
If I talk...

176
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:48,050
you'll just think I'm crazy.

177
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:02,953
With all the possible respect
I can offer a man

178
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:07,341
wearing a latex mask and spouting
conspiracy theories, David...

179
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:10,748
...believe me.
You've crossed that bridge.

180
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:13,661
Enjoy your dinner.

181
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:19,790
There are five basic emotions
in life, David.

182
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:26,621
Tell me, what emotion gripped him
before he entered that cell?

183
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:30,718
Was it guilt? Hate?

184
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:34,985
Shame?

185
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:38,263
Revenge?

186
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,270
Love?

187
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,844
I'm completely on the wrong track,
aren't I?

188
00:14:56,883 --> 00:14:58,635
Who needs ice?

189
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:02,982
- Hey, Emma!
- David, happy birthday.

190
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:06,425
You have got the greatest taste
in shoes bar none.

191
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:08,401
Emma, have you met Lynette?

192
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:12,164
No, but I shudder to think
what we might have in common.

193
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:14,797
Did you invite
the entire snowboarding team?

194
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:16,348
It is my birthday.

195
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:19,045
- Say happy birthday to David.
- Happy birthday.

196
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:24,211
Welcome to Graceland.

197
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:30,011
Happy birthday, you sonofabitch!

198
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,639
Happy birthday!

199
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,531
Friends of me!

200
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,726
Let the fun ensue.

201
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,382
...the great John Coltrane.
They would love an article on it.

202
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,379
It's an amazing, amazing product.

203
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:51,722
No, that's OK. I've got it.

204
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:59,311
- Literary god, Brian Shelby.
- Happy birthday!

205
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:03,871
- And all the usual shit. How you doing?
- Living the dream, baby.

206
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:05,896
David Aames.

207
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,180
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- The pleasure of Sofia Serrano.

208
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:11,916
We met today at the library.

209
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:15,948
- My coat's too big for your closet.
- We were pretending to be intellectuals.

210
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:20,357
- It's amazing. I love your coat.
- I overdressed. I mean, I underdressed.

211
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:22,935
I'll continue like you're both
listening to me.

212
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:27,520
- Do you have another room to put it in?
- I have ceased to exist.

213
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:30,840
Madison Square Garden is nearby.
It might fit there.

214
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:35,053
- Happy birthday.
- We picked it out together.

215
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,262
- Thank you.
- We picked it out together. We.

216
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:40,360
You're welcome.

217
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:44,507
Stop flirting and open it.

218
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:48,963
- Let's get a drink!
- Yes.

219
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:51,352
I'll leave this upstairs.

220

221
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:11,127
- Listen...
- Hey, Tommy.

222
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:12,916
Don't blow me off.

223
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:16,861
I'm all packed, I'm going back
to London and I understand.

224
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,396
You put me up for that attorney's job
so you didn't have to fire me.

225
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:23,696
A classy move.
Your father would have done the same.

226
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:27,514
- It's OK, Tommy.
- I became incompetent.

227
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,957
Is there anything more unbecoming
than an ageing mascot?

228
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,963
I cared for your father.
I lived and breathed for him.

229

These guys, the Seven Dwarfs,

230

A corporate hazard, a rogue.

231
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,249
They'll find a way
to catch you out, David.

They're lined up for your office,

this tradition of words

so they can eat in a better cafeteria.

You've got great instincts,
but I say this with complete love.

- Forgive me.

across from the Seven Dwarfs.

Set up a meeting with the other attorneys.
I'll be in early tomorrow.

Earlier than usual.

248
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,611
Hello, handsome.

249
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:18,415
- I've come to wish you happy birthday.
- Oh, man!

250
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:24,507
- I didn't invite you, Julie.
- That was a little weird.

251
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:28,507
That's how it works with parties.
You have to be invited.

252
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:30,270
Oh.

I'm mad at you, you dick.

We made love four times
the other night.

255
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:41,811
- Was that good?
- Two's good.

256
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:45,370
Three...is very good.

257
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:48,313
- But four...
- Four's pretty good?

258
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:50,608
Four is...

259
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,571
Four is what?

260
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:04,399
Hold me, I'll leave and you can go back
and talk to that cute brunette.

261
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:06,155
Four is what?

262
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:10,175
I don't want to meet your fancy friends.
I knew them when I was fancy too.

Four is what?

264

She looks like a moth, David.

265
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:20,903
- A moth?
- Sometimes I worry about you.

266
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:26,193
Some clever girl in a silly coat will come
along and play you just the right way.

267
00:20:26,582 --> 00:20:31,975
I'll lose my friend and there won't be
chicken soup parties for me and you.

268
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:46,695
OK.

269
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:57,915
When will you call me?
Don't say "soon".

270

00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:19,057
Nobody stalks me so I drink.

314
00:24:19,315 --> 00:24:22,785
- We're out of drinks up here.
- Finish my Jack and Coke.

315
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:24,625
- Stupid glass.
- I've got it.

316
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:28,061
- It's the stupid guy holding it.
- Don't worry, no big deal.

317
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:32,486
- I'll get us all something.
- I'd better hit it. I drank too much.

318
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,983
- The party's just starting.
- For you it is.

319
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:38,051
- You are my guest of honour.
- Fuck you, David.

320
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:41,060
You're paying me to write my novel,
so you own me.

321
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,179
I don't own you. You are brilliant,
you are handsome.

322
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:48,023
But why do you have to hit on Sofia?

323
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:50,990
I wasn't hitting on Sofia.

324
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:54,464
Fine, whatever you say.
I'm crazy, I'm blind.

325
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:58,135
You're drinking Jack Daniels.
When you drink, you start with that...

326
00:24:59,286 --> 00:25:03,165
...Frank Sinatra, "she shot me down,
give me a cigarette" thing.

327
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:06,377
- That I do. Give me a cigarette.
- I'll find one.

328
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,788
You're rich and women love you.
I'm from Ohio and I'm drunk.

329
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,330
- Can I tell you the truth?
- Everybody does.

330
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:17,748
I dig her. I've never said this to you
before about any girl.

331
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:20,034
But she could be...

332
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:24,391
Could be, could be,
could be the girl of my dreams.

333
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:27,172
- You're not from Ohio.
- I know.

334
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:30,759
But if she fucks up our friendship,
she can go to hell.

335
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,547
I won't allow it.
We are brothers.

336
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,869
- I feel the same way.
- Sure you do.

337
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:37,277
Hey!

338
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:39,540
- How you doing? Gracias.
- De nada.

339
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,438
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

340
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,192
- Where are you going?
- I am Frank...and Frank must go.

341
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:53,230
- What?
- I good you bid evening.

342
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:55,278
Wait, I'll go with you.

343
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,567
- Stay, baby.
- I'll give you a ride home later.

344
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:01,540
No, I have to work tomorrow.

345
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,583
You...are in great hands.

346
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:09,084
I'm just humouring myself
that my opinion matters.

347
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:17,578
You will never know the exquisite pain

348
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:21,231
of the guy who goes home alone.

349
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:25,914
Because without the bitter, baby,
the sweet ain't as sweet.

350
00:26:27,197 --> 00:26:29,074
Have a good time.

351
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:34,478

00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:55,397
It's not the heights that bother me,
it's the impact that terrifies me.

Hello. I have to take you for a walk.

00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:14,844
I need protection.
This is a lethal canine.

I love living here
and I refuse to clean up.

No problem.

to keep this place.

- For 14 years.

But I don't dance like you dance.

366

- Do you want something to drink?
- Sure.

367
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:41,494
Hey, Paulo.
Beautiful, beautiful boy.

368
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:46,296
What do you want for dinner tonight?
You want fried chicken?

369

Paulo!

00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,638
- I like your life.
- It's mine and you can't have it.

371
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:08,247
I don't want to know the story
behind this photo. Who's Sergio?

372
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:11,743
- It's a nickname.
- Your nickname is Sergio?

373
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:14,608
It's a long story,
and we don't know each other.

374
00:28:17,056 --> 00:28:19,854
- So many secrets.
- I'm really an arms dealer.

375
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:23,419
- I've never known an arms dealer.
- You do now.

376
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:26,243
What about you?
What's your nickname?

377
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:33,994
Citizen Dildo.

378
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:38,766
You are not staying over.

379
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,587
Never run a company.
Stay an artist. Stay an arms dealer.

380
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:50,242
Please. Somehow I can't play
the violin for you.

381
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,156
Although it must be difficult
controlling all those people's lives.

382
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:59,820
Everyone at that party is connected
to you for survival.

383
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,117
It seems.

384
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:07,915
Ever been married?

385
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:14,132
No. Did you ever accept
any of your 12,000 proposals?

386
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:16,822
12,008. No.

387
00:29:17,095 --> 00:29:20,053
You moved to New York to dance,
paint, act and deal arms?

388
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:25,787
Right. Do you want to hear
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?

389
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:30,901
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?
Both. Simultaneously.

390
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:38,039
Everyone said: "Don't go to New York."
But I think good things will happen

391
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:42,408
if you're a good person
with a good attitude. Don't you think?

392
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:50,775

- No, I really don't.

Truthfully, I'm also working mornings
as a dental assistant.

I'm a pleasure delayer.'

- How does that work?
- Pleasure delay? You don't know?

401
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:32,093
You keep a relationship casual
until the absolute breaking point.

402
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:36,877
Then one evening, or afternoon,
or morning...

It could be months from now.

404

- You know how it works.
- No, actually I don't.

- You've got dinner with your daughters.

That's right, I do.

- Yes.

only if you're mentally acute.

623
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,450
'I'm sorry that poor girl died,

624
00:49:40,718 --> 00:49:43,790
'but you've handed the board
a gift with your mishap.

625
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:47,453
'They'd like to declare you incapacitated.

626
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:50,159
'But you're back.

627
00:49:50,439 --> 00:49:54,114
'You sound good to me,
so let's fight the fuckers

628
00:49:54,445 --> 00:49:58,484
'and have a full recovery.
Maybe you should let people see you.'

629
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:01,784
The last time we were together,
you were in a coma

630
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:06,438
and you were very fucking rude to me.
You didn't say a word.

631
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:11,725
The rumours of my death
have been mildly exaggerated.

632
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:20,191
'Who could I trust?
The ants were taking over the ant hill.

633
00:50:22,525 --> 00:50:24,561
'Who could I trust?'

634
00:50:25,904 --> 00:50:28,338
(Acoustic slide guitar)

635
00:51:25,652 --> 00:51:28,769
(Man) 'The cranial structure
was based on 30 pins,

636
00:51:29,073 --> 00:51:32,304
'and fastened by micro panels
and bone from the mandible.

637
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,373
'The grafts have maintained
your cheek structure.

638
00:51:35,665 --> 00:51:37,974
Unfortunately, as you were in a coma...

639
00:51:38,251 --> 00:51:41,687
'Doctors. Their power is in jargon,
so you study up.

640
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:44,966
Is that the procedure
for all bilateral haematomas

641
00:51:45,262 --> 00:51:48,015
in a LeFort III fracture
of a comatose patient?

642
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:49,981
'You do your best.'

643
00:51:50,228 --> 00:51:53,538
The potential for intra-cranial
brain damage was too great.

644
00:51:53,856 --> 00:51:55,448
Beyond the cheek grafts,

645
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:58,445
are the pins fastened
with any kind of aluminium

646
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:01,572
which could cause the pressure
in my head?

647
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,745
We're working on prostheses,

648
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:07,591
but you're not at the stage
where we can experiment.

649
00:52:09,378 --> 00:52:11,209
Experiment. Use me.

650
00:52:11,506 --> 00:52:15,579
- The headaches will go away.
- These are more than headaches.

651
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:20,425
These are like steel plates
slicing through my every thought.

652
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:22,885
We're not cowboys.
We can't just wing it.

653
00:52:23,899 --> 00:52:26,254
I can't think straight most of the time.

654
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:30,315
- We can increase your medication.
- Yes. Medication.

655
00:52:31,534 --> 00:52:35,846
We'll continue to investigate.
However, there are so many others

656
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:40,438
who have not had the aesthetic benefit
of plastic surgery as you have.

657
00:52:41,297 --> 00:52:44,289
This isn't about vanity,
Dr Pomerantz.

658
00:52:44,593 --> 00:52:48,142
This isn't about vanity.
This is about functioning in the world.

659
00:52:48,474 --> 00:52:51,352
It's my job to be out there functioning.

660
00:52:51,644 --> 00:52:54,078
I've got the money.
I'll pay any amount.

661
00:52:55,482 --> 00:52:58,838
Just invent something!
Just play jazz.

662
00:52:59,197 --> 00:53:03,031
You say you're the best face man
in New York? Prove it!

663
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:10,230
- We could do something about your arm.
- Fuck my arm!

664
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:17,509
Nobody here takes your feelings
for granted.

665
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:21,036
We prepared something
based on the preliminary examination.

666
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:22,750
Bring it on!

667
00:53:22,979 --> 00:53:26,415
It's sometimes useful
in the early stages of rejection.

668
00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:29,566
It's a facial prosthetic.
It was two weeks in the making.

669
00:53:29,862 --> 00:53:32,217
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, doctor.

670
00:53:42,297 --> 00:53:45,926
- A facial prosthetic?
- The aesthetic replacement does work.

671
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:48,853
Emotionally and actually.

672
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:51,972
The plastic in the shield
blocks out abusive rays

673
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:55,418
and assists in the regeneration of cells.

674
00:53:56,525 --> 00:54:00,359
- It's an aesthetic regenerative shield?
- That's correct.

675
00:54:00,697 --> 00:54:03,689
The ergonomics of the plate barrier
allows it to interact

676
00:54:03,992 --> 00:54:07,428
- with the movements of your face.
- I see.

677
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:11,285
- It's a helpful unit.
- Good.

678
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:14,259
For a minute there,
I thought we were talking about

679
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:16,585
(Shouts) a fucking mask!

680
00:54:18,554 --> 00:54:21,990
It's only a mask
if you treat it that way.

681
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:26,223
No, it's great. This completely
takes care of Halloween.

682
00:54:28,818 --> 00:54:33,255
But what about the other 364 days
of the year?

683
00:54:47,635 --> 00:54:50,513
'A new form of me began to take shape.

684
00:54:50,806 --> 00:54:56,005
'I planned my re-emergence
like the Normandy invasion.'

685
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,958

'I attended the monthly meeting
of the Seven Dwarfs by video.'

691
00:55:20,513 --> 00:55:23,869
People aren't buying books!
Let's invest.

692
00:55:24,185 --> 00:55:26,653
'Oh, baby. This was war.

693
00:55:27,689 --> 00:55:30,123
'I grew stronger in ways
I'd never known

694
00:55:30,402 --> 00:55:34,714
'and on December 5th,
my planes filled the sky.

695

696
00:55:52,472 --> 00:55:54,508
(Woman) Did you see his face?

697
00:56:18,884 --> 00:56:21,956
You won't believe this...

698
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,672
...but this is me smiling.

699
00:56:33,947 --> 00:56:35,619
It's been a long time.

700
00:56:35,866 --> 00:56:39,256
I tried to see you,
but your people wouldn't let me.

701
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,094
I didn't want to see me, OK?

702
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:47,032
But then I woke up today,
and finally...

703
00:56:48,425 --> 00:56:50,063
...a good hair day.

704
00:56:54,099 --> 00:56:55,691
You want to get together?

705
00:56:58,605 --> 00:56:59,560
Sure.

706
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:04,210
- What?
- Let's go out and do something.

707
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:08,368
This weekend.
I'll cancel an operation or two.

708
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,950
We'll have fun.

709
00:57:11,205 --> 00:57:14,880
Because I am all about fun.

710
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,446
'Our first guest tonight

I'm back in your life.
I saw you earlier today.

725
00:58:15,543 --> 00:58:21,061
I was just watching our old friend
Benny the dog on "Conan"

726
00:58:22,845 --> 00:58:25,439
and I thought of you.

727
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:28,085
Whatever. I...

728
00:58:29,562 --> 00:58:31,792
...I loved seeing you today.

729
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:35,293
So I will see you soon.

730
00:58:36,697 --> 00:58:38,847
You're a great dancer.

731
00:59:32,023 --> 00:59:34,617
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing.

732
00:59:34,901 --> 00:59:37,893
I'm in the mood for a cheap,
overpriced rum and Coke.

733
00:59:38,197 --> 00:59:40,108
- Do you want one?
- Is there any other kind?

734
00:59:40,366 --> 00:59:43,802
- I'll get us some.
- Where is the bathroom?

735
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,325
It's behind...

736
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:50,495
Over there,
by the girl who looks like Bjrk.

737
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,434
- I'll be right back.
- Maybe I should...

738
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:57,659
You look good.
How's your book?

739
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:01,103
- Take it off.
- This is a facial shield.

740
01:00:01,395 --> 01:00:04,546
It's kind of like a prosthesis.

741
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:07,088
Take off the mask.
It's freaking me out.

742
01:00:07,363 --> 01:00:09,194
I can't.

743

It's my face. This is my face.

Trust me, it's a little different.

745
01:00:15,373 --> 01:00:19,366
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to chaperone.

746
01:00:19,712 --> 01:00:21,430
Sofia asked me.

747
01:00:21,674 --> 01:00:24,313
She didn't want to be alone with me?
That's bullshit!

I'm being pretty cool
about this whole thing.

749
01:00:27,598 --> 01:00:31,034
Talk to a shrink. Or are you going
to call me sometime

750
01:00:31,353 --> 01:00:33,344
instead of hiding in your apartment?

751
01:00:33,606 --> 01:00:36,837
Don't take it out on a girl
you only met once.

752
01:00:37,152 --> 01:00:40,110
Did she say that? Once?

753
01:00:40,406 --> 01:00:42,237
She said I met her once?

754
01:00:42,493 --> 01:00:45,724
Just cut it out.
I miss the old you.

- Fuck you, Brian.

How about that's the deal we make?

01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,318
- Another shot, another Bud.
- This is on the house.

776
01:02:11,614 --> 01:02:15,573
- Why?
- It just is...bitch.

777

779

# Zulu nation

780

# Zulu nation

# Z-U-L-U that's the way you say Zulu... #

785
01:03:06,856 --> 01:03:08,767
Patron!

786
01:03:17,745 --> 01:03:20,213
Fix your fucking face!

787
01:03:23,879 --> 01:03:25,835
(Mock laughter)

788
01:04:12,195 --> 01:04:14,390
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

789
01:04:14,907 --> 01:04:17,546
Idea - let's start over.

790
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:22,476
How about if you help me?
Unless I'm horning in here.

791
01:04:22,793 --> 01:04:24,943
"You are, but the food is good."

792
01:04:25,213 --> 01:04:28,603
I've got this little problem.
I've got a stalker.

793
01:04:30,512 --> 01:04:32,787
"It doesn't sound life-threatening."

794
01:04:33,056 --> 01:04:36,526
I need you to pretend we're having
a scintillating conversation

795
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:40,766
and you are wildly entertained.
I know it's tough.

796
01:04:41,903 --> 01:04:44,656
- "I'll improvise."
- I don't talk like that.

797
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:49,419
She's right across the room,
burning a hole in my back.

798
01:04:53,459 --> 01:04:55,927
Red dress, strappy shoes.

799
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,177
That's right.

800
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,958
I think she is the saddest girl
to ever hold a Martini.

801
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:22,900
- Are you OK?
- No.

802
01:05:23,751 --> 01:05:25,662
What's wrong?
Is it me?

803
01:05:27,171 --> 01:05:28,923
- Is it me?
- I'll tell you later.

804
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,167
Tell me now. If something's wrong,
please tell me now.

805
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:36,180
- Just talk about everything.
- I'll tell you later!

806
01:05:36,517 --> 01:05:38,985
Let's get it all out.
Say everything now.

807
01:05:39,271 --> 01:05:42,661
Just say everything.
Say everything now, now, now.

808
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:46,660
I'll tell you in another life
when we are both cats.

809
01:05:52,539 --> 01:05:55,451
I can't believe you just said that.

810
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,314
That's the greatest thing
I've ever heard.

811
01:06:00,593 --> 01:06:03,346
That's hilarious.
That you said that.

812
01:06:04,181 --> 01:06:06,854
That's... You said that.
You said that.

813
01:06:07,143 --> 01:06:10,419
That is what I love about you.

814
01:06:11,606 --> 01:06:13,915
That's hilarious.

815
01:06:14,194 --> 01:06:17,425
I'll tell you in another life
when we are both cats.

816
01:06:18,993 --> 01:06:21,029
Cats! Cats!

817
01:06:21,288 --> 01:06:22,721
(Meows)

818
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:30,685
- This is where I leave you.
- I'll walk you to your door.

819
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:33,762
- I live just around the corner.
- I've got my bike.

820
01:06:34,054 --> 01:06:35,965
- I'd rather walk.
- Don't be a drag.

821
01:06:36,223 --> 01:06:38,737
Can't you see she wants
to go on her own?

822
01:06:39,021 --> 01:06:41,330
Shut up, you're drunk.

823
01:06:41,607 --> 01:06:44,644
I may be an idiot, but I'm not drunk.

824
01:06:44,944 --> 01:06:49,096
Seriously, I don't need you
to walk me home. Thank you.

825
01:06:50,326 --> 01:06:52,157
OK, then, so...

826
01:06:52,746 --> 01:06:54,702
...we'll call you.

827
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:57,836
We'll go catch a movie or something.

828
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,933
So we'll meet up soon.

829
01:07:04,555 --> 01:07:06,113
We'll meet up soon.

830
01:07:16,278 --> 01:07:19,270
We'll call you again to go out with me.

831
01:07:20,326 --> 01:07:22,476
We'll call you.

832
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:26,261
It's been a real blast, David.
I bid you good evening.

833
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,495
Wait, where are you going?

834
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:31,551
My bike is back over there.
We'll hang soon.

835
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:34,753
Bring your mask if you want.
I'm getting used to it.

836
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:39,533
- Wait a minute.
- What?

837
01:07:42,356 --> 01:07:43,948
I don't know.

838
01:07:44,191 --> 01:07:47,069
You drank too much.
Call me tomorrow.

839
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,957
Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.

840
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:55,209
No, you won't.
You just need to sleep.

841
01:07:58,127 --> 01:08:00,960
- Hey. Hey!
- What?

842
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:10,503
What did you say to Julie Gianni
the night of the accident?

843
01:08:10,852 --> 01:08:17,291
- What?
- You told her she was a fuck buddy.

844
01:08:18,488 --> 01:08:20,240
Never.

845
01:08:20,492 --> 01:08:23,609
She was a little more than pissed about it.

846
01:08:24,496 --> 01:08:27,374
Have you been harbouring
this shit all along?

847
01:08:27,667 --> 01:08:30,135
I never talked to her.

848
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:35,923
Whatever.

849
01:08:37,766 --> 01:08:42,476
Anyway, who am I if I can't be the one
to tell you you're not ugly?

850
01:08:44,147 --> 01:08:47,696
Come on!
Give me a courtesy laugh!

851
01:08:48,946 --> 01:08:53,656
Brian, I'm so fucked up.
I'm just so fucked up (!)

852
01:09:01,213 --> 01:09:05,206
We're best friends!
We're bro's!

853
01:09:05,553 --> 01:09:08,465
Come on, man. We're bro's.

854

# Oh...but sweetness follows... #

865
01:10:49,735 --> 01:10:51,965
Open your eyes.

866
01:10:55,911 --> 01:10:57,060
Boo!

867
01:10:58,164 --> 01:11:03,363
- This is a cheap ploy for sympathy.
- I'm OK. I'm OK.

868
01:11:03,755 --> 01:11:06,394
And it worked. Get up.

869
01:11:07,301 --> 01:11:08,700
I agree.

870
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:13,757
This is a joke.

871
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,692
David, I'm not going to lie to you.

872
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:20,018
I liked the way you looked. But...

873
01:11:21,113 --> 01:11:24,230
...you have to pull it the fuck together.

874
01:11:24,532 --> 01:11:27,171
If not, I'll forget the other guy.

875
01:11:27,452 --> 01:11:30,808
You know that other guy? You?

876
01:11:31,961 --> 01:11:34,634
I'm still that guy.

877
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:39,838
I don't have a mother saviour bone
in my body. It's not about that.

878
01:11:40,221 --> 01:11:44,373
You are coming inside,
but if this turns out to be a big mistake...

879
01:11:45,394 --> 01:11:50,149
...I do have the ability to fall
out of love with you like that.

01:12:06,799 --> 01:12:11,111
- Where's Brian?
- Brian? He went with you, didn't he?

883
01:12:11,974 --> 01:12:14,408
I thought you guys hooked up.

884
01:12:15,728 --> 01:12:19,243
I wish you hadn't got in the car
with that girl.

885
01:12:21,527 --> 01:12:23,597
Sofia, I...

886
01:12:26,867 --> 01:12:29,335
Your eyes apologise better.

887
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:33,157
Come on.

888
01:12:33,752 --> 01:12:39,031
Holy God! This is going to change
my life in a zillion different ways.

889
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:41,641

Ah, Sofia.

893
01:13:08,424 --> 01:13:11,302
I see you haven't been wasting your time.

894
01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:15,848
- Do you ever draw anything else?
- No.

895
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:19,021
Did you sleep last night?

896
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:21,248
(Mouths words) I love you.

897
01:13:21,901 --> 01:13:23,539
No, I did not sleep.

898
01:13:23,778 --> 01:13:27,487
Got to leave early today, David,
so you'll have to be brief.

899
01:13:27,824 --> 01:13:32,022
What can you tell me
about the name Ellie?

900
01:13:34,961 --> 01:13:36,394
Ellie.

901
01:13:36,629 --> 01:13:39,223
Was that a girl you were
in love with?

902
01:13:39,509 --> 01:13:41,545
I've only been in love once.

903
01:13:41,803 --> 01:13:44,954
Apparently you kept repeating it last night.

904
01:13:45,265 --> 01:13:49,019
You did sleep, David.
Your advisor said you cried out.

905
01:13:49,355 --> 01:13:52,028
- You had a nightmare.
- Everything's a nightmare.

906
01:13:52,317 --> 01:13:55,866
You cried out for Ellie, David.
Do you remember what happened?

907
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:01,428
I...I don't...

908
01:14:02,832 --> 01:14:06,222
Dig deep, David. Dig deep.

909
01:14:06,544 --> 01:14:10,696
You cried out for Ellie.
What do you remember about Ellie?

910
01:14:12,428 --> 01:14:14,703
Show me your face, David.

911
01:14:16,475 --> 01:14:19,114
Help me open the door.

912
01:14:28,952 --> 01:14:32,831
It's true you had an accident,
it's true you were disfigured.

913
01:14:33,165 --> 01:14:35,201
But not any more.

914
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:37,821
Do you remember?

915
01:14:39,507 --> 01:14:42,305
They did fix your face.

916
01:14:43,929 --> 01:14:48,923
Take off that mask, David.
You'll see your face is perfect under there.

917
01:14:50,564 --> 01:14:53,317
I never trusted the doctors.

918
01:14:54,903 --> 01:14:57,895
What happened next was surreal.

919
01:14:59,116 --> 01:15:02,392
That same arrogant bastard,
Dr Pomerantz, called me

920
01:15:02,705 --> 01:15:05,060
and suddenly he was my new best friend.

921
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:09,724
David! My brother! I felt really bad
about our last conversation.

922
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:13,241
'He'd discovered a new form
of reconstructive surgery

923
01:15:13,554 --> 01:15:15,784
'with the help of a doctor from Berlin.'

924
01:15:16,056 --> 01:15:17,171
Hello.

925
01:15:17,391 --> 01:15:21,179
'Next thing I knew, they shot me
full of drugs I'd never heard of

# Trying to make his way home... #

930
01:15:36,667 --> 01:15:38,305
He's got a good voice.

(# JOAN OSBORNE: "One Of Us")

932
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:48,627
and facial tissue could be regenerated.

...the concept of endoscopic,
periorbital fibre optics.

- I can't even tell you what they did.

935
01:15:56,445 --> 01:15:58,515
It seemed like science fiction.

936
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:02,659
Madonna had that song "Borderline".
That was a hell of a song.

937
01:16:02,996 --> 01:16:06,113
This is going to be one good-looking guy
when I'm done.

938
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:08,806
'Obviously I was suspicious.'

939
01:16:10,088 --> 01:16:14,445
- Wouldn't you be?
- Suspicious of whom? Of what?

940
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:19,661
Doc, once you've been driven off
a bridge at 80 miles an hour,

941
01:16:20,394 --> 01:16:24,990
somehow you don't invite happiness
in without a full body search.

942
01:16:28,531 --> 01:16:32,922
At the risk of boring you,
I can present the alternate argument.

943
01:16:33,995 --> 01:16:38,352
I once knew a guy
who was a real loner.

944
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:41,918
One day he woke up at 40

945
01:16:42,173 --> 01:16:45,290
with two daughters
that lit up his life with purpose.

946
01:16:45,596 --> 01:16:48,110
He suddenly goes to endless school plays,

947
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:51,382
he gets home at 9:20
for the evening discussion

948
01:16:51,686 --> 01:16:54,439
and he has the time of his life.

949
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:59,401
His favourite Beatle was once John
and now it's Paul.

950
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:04,672
I always liked George.

951
01:17:05,706 --> 01:17:08,937
It all depends on the individual,
doesn't it?

952
01:17:09,252 --> 01:17:13,165
- Tell me, what's happiness for you?
- What's happiness to you, David?

953
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:19,322
- How about another question?
- You won't show me your face, will you?

954
01:17:19,683 --> 01:17:24,803
So, back to the timeline.
Hurry, let's move through this.

955
01:17:25,232 --> 01:17:27,029
David!

956
01:17:28,737 --> 01:17:31,410
- David?
- What?

957
01:17:33,744 --> 01:17:37,942
- You've got to take the plates off.
- I don't want to know what's under here.

958
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:40,362
It'll be fine, you'll see.

959
01:17:40,627 --> 01:17:43,824
I called Pomerantz
and switched it to Wednesday.

961
01:17:49,807 --> 01:17:51,365
What?

962
01:17:53,103 --> 01:17:56,618
I hope that women at the front desk
gave you shit about it.

963
01:17:58,152 --> 01:18:01,303
Another day won't matter,
and the Mustang will be fixed.

964
01:18:01,614 --> 01:18:04,651
The plan was going in the Mustang.
It's not ready.

965
01:18:04,953 --> 01:18:08,912
So we'll go tomorrow in the Mustang,
when it's fixed.

966
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,206
I know that the problem

967
01:18:11,462 --> 01:18:15,250
wouldn't be you delaying something
you were dreading.

968
01:18:17,636 --> 01:18:20,946
- Couldn't be that.
- No, couldn't be that.

969
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:25,859
I mean...

970
01:18:34,826 --> 01:18:37,420
I mean...I agree.

971
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:43,019
I think it's very important to have...

972
01:18:46,093 --> 01:18:48,527
...the right car...

973
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,202
...to take you...

974
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:02,124
...where you want to go...

975
01:19:06,745 --> 01:19:08,736
...24 hours a day.

976
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:36,446
How bad is it?

977
01:19:39,873 --> 01:19:42,990
Well, your ears are in the right place.

978
01:19:45,799 --> 01:19:48,233
And the rest of it...

979
01:19:50,638 --> 01:19:53,106
...is not too bad at all.

980
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,532

It won't exist.

She's not going to press charges.

1086
01:31:12,357 --> 01:31:15,076
It wasn't Sofia.
It was Julie.

1087
01:31:16,321 --> 01:31:19,711
- It was Julie.
- It was Julie Gianni.

1088
01:31:21,911 --> 01:31:24,709
So Sofia was abducted by Julie

1089
01:31:25,417 --> 01:31:28,090
and now Julie is posing as Sofia.

1090
01:31:31,133 --> 01:31:33,806
You're in OJ land, man.

1091
01:31:34,428 --> 01:31:36,339
Julie Gianni is dead!

1092
01:31:36,599 --> 01:31:41,992
I don't care what they told you.
I can assure you Julie Gianni is alive.

1093
01:31:42,397 --> 01:31:47,596
- I didn't talk to them, I talked to Sofia.
- Where is she?

1094
01:31:47,989 --> 01:31:51,106
I just dropped Sofia off.
I saw everything you did to her.

1095
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:53,685
I did not do that to her.

1096
01:31:55,666 --> 01:32:00,786
Look me in the eye and tell me
that's the girl you brought to the party.

1097
01:32:01,173 --> 01:32:05,883
Tell me that's your dream girl,
your proximity infatuation.

1098
01:32:06,264 --> 01:32:09,779
Yes! And you stole her from me.

1099
01:32:10,103 --> 01:32:13,937
The one girl I really wanted
and you took her from me.

1100
01:32:14,274 --> 01:32:17,072
You're insane.
You're losing it, man!

1101
01:32:17,445 --> 01:32:20,642
- You have revealed yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

1102
01:32:21,326 --> 01:32:23,920
(Sinister voice) I'm with them.

1103
01:32:28,712 --> 01:32:33,342
Where did you get the coat, Brian?
Where did you get the camera?

1104
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,216
How much did they pay you?

1105
01:32:37,389 --> 01:32:41,587
Listen to me, because this is the last time
we're ever going to speak.

1106
01:32:41,936 --> 01:32:46,088
- I was your only friend.
- You have revealed yourself to me.

1107
01:33:09,851 --> 01:33:11,364
Problems?

1108
01:33:12,562 --> 01:33:15,281
I'm in no mood
to be fucked with, so...

1109
01:33:15,566 --> 01:33:18,524
There's an explanation for all this, David.

1110
01:33:20,448 --> 01:33:23,804
You and I know each other.
You found me on the Internet.

1111
01:33:25,664 --> 01:33:28,258
I'm here to help you, David.

1112
01:33:30,337 --> 01:33:33,966
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me?

1113
01:33:34,299 --> 01:33:37,609
First of all, it's very important
that you calm down.

1114
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:42,860
Calm down? Calm down!

1115
01:33:43,187 --> 01:33:46,304
You must overcome your fears
and regain control.

1116
01:33:46,609 --> 01:33:50,522
Take hold of your life again, David.
It's as easy as holding that glass.

1117
01:33:51,991 --> 01:33:56,542
What if I were to tell you that you can
take control of all of this?

1118
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:59,287
Even me.

1119
01:34:00,293 --> 01:34:02,204
I'm straight, OK?

1120
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:09,552
David, look at all these people.

1121
01:34:09,849 --> 01:34:13,080
Seems as though they're all just
chatting away, doesn't it?

1122
01:34:13,395 --> 01:34:15,545
- Nothing to do with you?
- No.

1123
01:34:15,814 --> 01:34:20,569
And yet maybe they're only here
because you wanted them to be here.

1124
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:24,155
You are their god.

1125
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:28,608
You can make them obey you
or even destroy you.

1126
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:32,997
What I'd love for them to do
is shut the fuck up,

1127
01:34:33,338 --> 01:34:34,691
especially you.

1128
01:34:47,233 --> 01:34:48,712
You see?

1129
01:35:01,002 --> 01:35:03,357
You and I signed a contract, David.

1130
01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:06,428
'Who is the man in the restaurant?'
Who is it?

1131
01:35:09,137 --> 01:35:12,209
Can you tell the difference
between dreams and reality?

1132
01:35:12,517 --> 01:35:14,951
- Of course. Can you?
- Think about it.

1133
01:35:16,313 --> 01:35:21,387
Think with your head.
You signed a contract, did you not?

1134
01:35:23,615 --> 01:35:26,891
- I signed something.
- Was the man in the restaurant there?

1135
01:35:29,082 --> 01:35:32,279
- Fuck!
- Accept your body's resistance.

1136
01:35:32,585 --> 01:35:34,701
Let your head answer.

1137
01:35:37,718 --> 01:35:40,630
- Yes.
- That's right. Who is Ellie?

1138
01:35:43,392 --> 01:35:46,589
- I don't know what's real.
- What happened that night?

1139
01:35:46,897 --> 01:35:50,173
- Somebody died.
- I don't want to remember.

1140
01:35:50,485 --> 01:35:53,443
You understand you hold the keys
to this prison?

1141
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:55,890
- It wasn't Sofia.
- Who was it?

1142
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,195
- No.
- Who was it?

1143
01:36:04,839 --> 01:36:07,956
You want to let it out,
don't you, David?

1144
01:36:10,471 --> 01:36:13,190
You're about to tell me.

1145
01:36:13,767 --> 01:36:19,046
Tell me what your heart and soul
will not allow you to forget.

1146
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:24,474
Did you kill Sofia?

1147
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:17,806
I thought you were a vandal.

1148
01:37:20,067 --> 01:37:22,342
Who are you?

1149
01:37:26,574 --> 01:37:28,451
I'm Sofia.

1150
01:37:30,413 --> 01:37:33,246
You are not Sofia!

1151
01:37:35,963 --> 01:37:38,921
You are not Sofia.

1152
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:44,423
I'm Sofia.
We're going to be together again.

1153
01:37:45,809 --> 01:37:49,688
You're going to forget about Juliana
and we're going to be together.

1154
01:37:50,022 --> 01:37:52,741
I'm not going to be afraid of you
any more.

1155
01:37:53,027 --> 01:37:55,860
I'll get you a cold towel.
I'll be right back.

1156
01:37:57,117 --> 01:37:58,994
I love you.

1157
01:38:17,979 --> 01:38:20,254
(Sofia) 'Pleasure delayer.'

1158
01:38:28,909 --> 01:38:30,820
Sofia?

1159
01:38:49,312 --> 01:38:51,303
I am Sofia.

1160
01:38:57,573 --> 01:39:01,885
I love you.
I missed you so much.

1161
01:39:11,508 --> 01:39:13,464
Where were you?

1162
01:39:19,186 --> 01:39:24,658
Forget it. I don't need to know.
It doesn't matter.

1163
01:39:27,907 --> 01:39:30,023
Just tell me that you love me.

1164
01:39:35,584 --> 01:39:37,336
I love you.

1165
01:39:39,964 --> 01:39:42,762
What is happiness to you, David?

1166
01:39:43,093 --> 01:39:46,210
For me, it's being here with you.

1167
01:39:46,515 --> 01:39:49,348
(# THE MONKEES: "Porpoise Song")

1168
01:39:53,525 --> 01:39:56,437
What the fuck is happening?

1169
01:39:59,824 --> 01:40:02,054
What the fuck is happening?

1170
01:40:02,328 --> 01:40:05,684
David was a real delight as a child.

1171
01:40:05,999 --> 01:40:07,796
(Julie laughs)

1172
01:40:09,755 --> 01:40:12,872
I'm so afraid of how powerful this is.

1173
01:40:14,262 --> 01:40:16,457
Oh, David.

1174
01:40:35,249 --> 01:40:37,126
(Sofia) Red dress, strappy shoes...

1175
01:40:37,377 --> 01:40:39,971
(Discordant music)

1176
01:40:47,264 --> 01:40:50,461
That is the greatest thing
I have ever heard.

1177
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,512
I'll tell you in another life
when we are both cats.

1178
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:03,316
What's happening?

1179
01:42:26,525 --> 01:42:28,755
I did it, didn't I?

1180
01:42:31,073 --> 01:42:34,463
But I don't feel like I killed someone.

1181
01:42:37,164 --> 01:42:42,796
- I feel like I'm in a dream.
- Who was the man at the restaurant?

1182
01:43:01,948 --> 01:43:06,066
Sometimes the mind behaves
as if it were a dream.

1183
01:43:06,411 --> 01:43:10,120
Faces change,
people become other people.

1184
01:43:11,336 --> 01:43:14,772
The subconscious is a powerful thing.

1185
01:43:16,134 --> 01:43:19,729
You treated Julie carelessly,
didn't you?

1186
01:43:28,692 --> 01:43:32,162
Your feelings of responsibility
or guilt over Julie

1187
01:43:32,489 --> 01:43:35,959
might have turned Sofia into Julie.

1188
01:43:38,664 --> 01:43:42,418
- Do you know what derangement is?
- I need your help.

1189
01:43:44,839 --> 01:43:49,515
All I know is you killed your girlfriend
and I don't know what's in your mind.

1190
01:43:49,888 --> 01:43:51,958
I need your help.

1191
01:43:52,225 --> 01:43:56,855
I would work on this case forever
if I could, but we've run out of time.

1192
01:44:01,695 --> 01:44:03,970
What will you plead?

1193
01:44:07,328 --> 01:44:11,958
Temporary derangement.
That's your best chance.

1194
01:44:14,129 --> 01:44:16,404
I don't think they'll believe me.

1195
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,228
Who do you believe?

1196
01:44:21,472 --> 01:44:24,509
Believe it or not, I care about you.

1197
01:44:25,853 --> 01:44:30,290
You've become like family
to me.

1198
01:44:34,407 --> 01:44:37,240
I don't want to give up on you, David.

1199
01:44:37,536 --> 01:44:41,973
But I needed more.
I needed an answer.

1200
01:44:43,127 --> 01:44:45,846
I even thought there was a chance

1201
01:44:46,131 --> 01:44:48,406
somebody was playing
a trick on you.

1202
01:44:48,677 --> 01:44:53,467
Maybe it was the board.
But I can't exceed my duties.

1203
01:44:58,606 --> 01:45:01,518
I'm just a psychologist...

1204
01:45:02,861 --> 01:45:05,056
...and I have to go now.

1205
01:45:08,996 --> 01:45:11,669
Will I see you at the trial?

1206
01:45:12,792 --> 01:45:16,910
No, I'm just the opening act.

but in the deeply meaningful sense
that can only be borne in the human heart.

01:48:43,872 --> 01:48:46,784
The DNA codes of the human body
have been broken.

1238
01:48:47,084 --> 01:48:51,600
Soon heart ailments, cancer,
so much more will be a thing of the past.

1239
01:48:51,966 --> 01:48:56,437
Very simply, your anguish,
your discontent, even your death

1240
01:48:56,804 --> 01:48:59,796
is no longer necessary
in a traditional sense.

1241
01:49:00,102 --> 01:49:04,141
Whatever malady hides
behind that mask, it's temporary.

1242
01:49:05,818 --> 01:49:10,528
Within an hour of your passing,
LE will transfer your body to a vessel

1243
01:49:10,907 --> 01:49:15,378
where you will be sealed and frozen
at 196 degrees below zero.

1244
01:49:15,747 --> 01:49:19,865
Power outages, earthquakes, nothing
will affect your suspension hibernation.

1245
01:49:20,212 --> 01:49:23,045
Have you signed a contract
with these people, David?

1246

- What's the Lucid Dream option?
- Good choice.

1247
01:49:31,477 --> 01:49:34,913
The Lucid Dream
is Life Extension's newest option.

1248
01:49:35,233 --> 01:49:36,791
For a little extra,

1249
01:49:37,026 --> 01:49:42,817
we offer the cryonic union
of science and entertainment.

1250
01:49:44,287 --> 01:49:45,879
Cryotainment.

I guess I missed that one
in "USA Today".

1280
01:51:33,226 --> 01:51:37,981
A dream.
What if there was a mistake?

1281
01:51:39,652 --> 01:51:42,485
What if the dream became a nightmare?

1282
01:51:43,950 --> 01:51:48,262
Your subconscious
can always play tricks on you.

1283
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:52,726
The subconscious
is a very powerful thing.

Did you sign a contract
with these people, David?

But this is a serious business.

1286
01:52:03,309 --> 01:52:06,301
The Lucid Dream is worth the risk.

1287
01:52:07,648 --> 01:52:11,277
And what is any life
if not the pursuit of a dream?

1288
01:52:11,612 --> 01:52:15,651
The dream of peace,
the dream of achievement,

1289
01:52:17,161 --> 01:52:20,119
the dream of hearing someone
say these words...

1290

Most of us live our whole lives

without any real adventure
to call our own.

1297

but they laughed at Jules Verne, too.

David Aames. I think it's time
we had a proper introduction.

I'm Edmund Ventura
from the Oasis project,

1306
01:54:51,914 --> 01:54:54,144
formerly Life Extension, LE.

1307
01:54:54,417 --> 01:54:58,092
- Tech support?
- Yes, I'm your tech support.

1308
01:54:58,506 --> 01:55:01,464
We first met 150 years ago.

1309
01:55:02,594 --> 01:55:06,348
Shit. You sold me the Lucid Dream.

1310
01:55:08,728 --> 01:55:12,641
- What the hell happened?
- I tried to warn you in the bar, David.

1311
01:55:12,984 --> 01:55:16,897
I told you that it all depended
on your mind.

1312
01:55:17,824 --> 01:55:21,373
All of this, everything is your creation.

1313
01:55:21,704 --> 01:55:24,423
Now we're heading towards
your true moment of choice.

1314
01:55:25,668 --> 01:55:28,341
- True moment of choice?
- Yes.

1315
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:35,556
When did the Lucid Dream begin?

1316
01:55:35,806 --> 01:55:38,957
- Do you remember the night club?
- We'll meet up soon.

1317
01:55:41,021 --> 01:55:44,491
That night, after Sofia left you
and you fell asleep on the pavement,

1318
01:55:44,819 --> 01:55:47,731
that was the moment
that you chose for the splice.

1319
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:50,499
- Splice?
- Splice.

1320
01:55:50,786 --> 01:55:54,745
The end of your real life
and the beginning of LE's Lucid Dream.

1321
01:55:55,083 --> 01:55:56,835
A splice of many years

1322
01:55:57,085 --> 01:55:59,918
which passed while you were frozen
and dreaming.

1323
01:56:00,215 --> 01:56:02,171
From the moment you woke up,

1324
01:56:02,426 --> 01:56:05,941
- nothing was real in the traditional sense.
- Open your eyes.

1325
01:56:06,264 --> 01:56:08,824
Your Lucid Dream is monitored
by Life Extension

1326
01:56:09,102 --> 01:56:12,253
and a panel of experts
following your every thought,

1327
01:56:12,565 --> 01:56:15,125
even at this moment.

1328
01:56:16,445 --> 01:56:18,561
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.

1329
01:56:23,037 --> 01:56:25,835
I'm not a big fan of heights.

1330
01:56:26,292 --> 01:56:27,964
I know.

1331
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:31,088
We erased what really happened
from your memory.

1332
01:56:31,382 --> 01:56:33,418
- Erased?
- Replaced...

1333
01:56:33,677 --> 01:56:39,354
...by a better life, under these
beautiful, Monet-like skies.

1334
01:56:41,186 --> 01:56:46,101
- My mother's favourite.
- A better life because you had Sofia.

1335
01:56:46,944 --> 01:56:51,222
You sculpted your Lucid Dream
out of the iconography of your youth.

1336
01:56:51,576 --> 01:56:55,489
- An album cover that once moved you.
- An album cover?

1337
01:56:55,832 --> 01:57:00,064
'There are some things that you're not
old enough to understand just yet.'

1338
01:57:00,422 --> 01:57:04,210
A movie you saw once that showed you
what a father could be like.

1339
01:57:10,477 --> 01:57:13,310
(Woman speaking French)

1340
01:57:15,066 --> 01:57:17,136
Or what love could be like.

1341
01:57:17,695 --> 01:57:23,213
This was a kind woman, an individual.
More than your equal.

1342
01:57:24,495 --> 01:57:26,053
You barely knew her in your real life,

1343
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:30,442
but in your Lucid Dream
she was your saviour.

1344
01:57:35,094 --> 01:57:38,166
What happened in my real life?
Something happened.

1345
01:57:38,473 --> 01:57:41,112
- What did you erase?
- Do you really want to know?

1346
01:57:43,938 --> 01:57:46,213
Tell me everything.

1347
01:57:46,484 --> 01:57:51,000
The morning after the night club, you woke
up on the street, hungover and alone.

1348
01:57:51,366 --> 01:57:56,360
You got up and you walked away.
You never saw Sofia again.

1349
01:58:03,048 --> 01:58:04,720
I didn't kill Sofia.

1350
01:58:06,135 --> 01:58:07,932
No.

1351
01:58:08,181 --> 01:58:13,050
You battled your board, the Seven Dwarfs,
for control of the company.

1352
01:58:13,437 --> 01:58:16,076
In the end it was Thomas Tipp,
your father's friend,

1353
01:58:16,358 --> 01:58:20,271
who wrenched the company
back into your control.

1354
01:58:22,198 --> 01:58:24,154
Tommy.

1355
01:58:25,328 --> 01:58:27,159
But then...

1356
01:58:27,833 --> 01:58:30,267
...somebody died.

1357
01:58:32,797 --> 01:58:35,231
You longed for Sofia.

1358
01:58:35,509 --> 01:58:39,058
You shut yourself away for months.
You were alone.

1359
01:58:39,389 --> 01:58:42,461
You couldn't stand the pain any more,
the headaches.

1360
01:58:42,769 --> 01:58:47,365
- You could barely function.
- I found you on the Internet.

1361
01:58:50,989 --> 01:58:53,867
I signed a contract with you and then...

1362
01:59:15,605 --> 01:59:17,641
I remember.

1363
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:28,650
Somebody died.

1364
01:59:30,375 --> 01:59:31,603
It was me.

1365
01:59:39,179 --> 01:59:41,898
'And on a day in late December...

1366

The little things.

02:01:26,242 --> 02:01:29,279
There's nothing bigger, is there?

1379
02:01:37,632 --> 02:01:41,261
Your subconscious did create problems.

1380
02:01:42,347 --> 02:01:45,305
Your dream turned into a nightmare.

1381
02:01:45,726 --> 02:01:48,684
The glitch has been corrected.

1382
02:01:49,857 --> 02:01:52,496
So all I have to do is imagine something?

1383
02:01:52,778 --> 02:01:56,657
Like if I wanted McCabe
to come back right now.

1384
02:02:00,455 --> 02:02:03,811
Listen to me.
These people are dangerous.

1385

We're in trouble.
We need to get off this roof now.

1386
02:02:12,429 --> 02:02:16,468
We're now on pause, and you're about
to return to your Lucid Dream.

1387
02:02:16,810 --> 02:02:18,482
Pause?

1388
02:02:18,729 --> 02:02:23,484
You won't remember any of this, nor will
you be charged for technical support.

1389
02:02:23,862 --> 02:02:26,820
It's now your moment of choice.

1390
02:02:27,366 --> 02:02:31,882
You can return to your Lucid Dream
and live a beautiful life with Sofia

1391
02:02:32,247 --> 02:02:34,636
or whomever you wish.

1392
02:02:34,918 --> 02:02:37,910
Or you can choose the world out there.

1393
02:02:41,678 --> 02:02:42,872
The world out there?

1394
02:02:43,806 --> 02:02:47,719
And you can bring me back?
Just like Benny the dog?

1395
02:02:48,103 --> 02:02:51,413
Yes, just like Benny the dog.

1396
02:02:53,443 --> 02:02:55,752
Your face and body can be fixed now,

1397
02:02:57,072 --> 02:03:02,430
but things are very different now.
And your finances won't last long.

1398
02:03:04,249 --> 02:03:08,208
Your panel of observers
are waiting for you to choose.

1399
02:03:12,427 --> 02:03:17,547
There are no guarantees.
But remember, even in the future,

1400
02:03:17,935 --> 02:03:22,292
the sweet is never as sweet
without the sour.

1401
02:03:41,384 --> 02:03:45,059
- How do I wake up?
- The decision is yours.

1402
02:03:50,354 --> 02:03:53,551
I chose this scenario, didn't I?

1403
02:03:54,276 --> 02:03:58,986
Yes, to face your last remaining
fear of heights.

1404
02:03:59,368 --> 02:04:01,165
David, don't listen to him.

1405
02:04:01,411 --> 02:04:04,130
This is the Seven Dwarfs. It's a set-up!

1406
02:04:04,414 --> 02:04:06,974
You can't trust him.

1407
02:04:07,253 --> 02:04:10,848
Don't feel bad for him, David.
This winning man is your creation.

1408
02:04:11,174 --> 02:04:13,893
It's in his nature
to fight for his existence,

1409
02:04:14,177 --> 02:04:16,816
- but he's not real.
- I'm real.

1410
02:04:19,769 --> 02:04:23,284
I'm real.
I have two daughters.

1411
02:04:23,607 --> 02:04:25,359
You know that.

1412
02:04:26,236 --> 02:04:27,669
What are their names?

1413
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:44,358
I'm real.

1414
02:04:45,596 --> 02:04:47,587
I'm...

1415
02:04:50,353 --> 02:04:54,983
Mortality as home entertainment?
This cannot be the future!

1416
02:04:56,985 --> 02:04:58,862
Can it?

1417
02:05:00,074 --> 02:05:02,030
(Shouts) Can it?

1418
02:05:29,989 --> 02:05:31,388
Goodbye.

1419
02:05:34,704 --> 02:05:41,098
It's been a journey of self-awakening.
Now you've got to ask yourself this.

1420
02:05:41,547 --> 02:05:43,822
What is happiness to you, David?

1421
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:53,733
I want to live a real life.

1422
02:05:54,523 --> 02:05:56,718
I don't want to dream any longer.

1423
02:05:57,944 --> 02:05:59,855
Any last wishes?

1424
02:06:02,785 --> 02:06:06,061
Let them out there read my mind.

1425
02:06:07,249 --> 02:06:09,638
I wish you well, David.

1426
02:06:49,263 --> 02:06:53,575
Look at us.
I'm frozen and you're dead.

1427
02:06:54,688 --> 02:06:56,644
And I love you.

1428
02:06:58,193 --> 02:07:00,423
It's a problem.

1429
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:07,890
I lost you when I got in that car.
I'm sorry.

1430
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:13,520
Do you remember
what you told me once?

1431
02:07:14,673 --> 02:07:17,107
Every passing minute

1432
02:07:18,054 --> 02:07:21,330
is another chance to turn it all around.

1433
02:07:26,565 --> 02:07:28,840
I'll find you again.

1434
02:07:45,048 --> 02:07:47,562
I'll see you in another life...

1435
02:07:47,843 --> 02:07:49,720
...when we are both cats.

1436
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:05,198
(Female voice)
'Relax, David. Open your eyes.'
