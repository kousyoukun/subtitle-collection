1
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:44,161
Open your eyes.

2
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,073
Open your eyes.

3
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,351
Open your eyes.

4
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:00,725
Open your eyes.

5
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:05,160
David, open your...

6
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,669
Well, I suppose
the empty street meant loneliness.

7
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:14,036
You're a shrink.
You gotta do better than that.

8
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:17,407
l'm a doctor.
Let's not stereotype each other.

9
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:20,448
Not all rich kids
are soulless and...

10
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:23,609
not all psychologists
care about dreams.

11
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:28,248
The question is how you got here
and why you've been charged.

12
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:31,555
What do you want to know?
I was about to turn 33.

13
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:35,155
I ran three magazines
and a worldwide publishing house.

14
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:40,329
Most days I fooled myself into
believing it would last forever.

15
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:43,067
Isn 't that what being young
is about?

16
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:45,370
Believing secretly
that you would be...

17
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:48,345
the one person
in the history of man...

18
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:50,279
who would live forever.

19
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:56,151
Where you going so early?

20
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:59,021
Don't record any more messages
on my alarm clock, okay?

21
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,627
- Why not?
- I'll start to think we're married.

22
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:05,996
Don't ever say that word.
I will never come over...

23
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:08,592
and bring you chicken soup
and fuck your brains out again.

24
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,503
How's your cold?

25
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,041
Still there.
How 'bout yours?

26
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:18,876
You definitely took
my mind off it.

27
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,540
Really?

28
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,309
Yes!

29
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,354
"Juliana" here.

30
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,128
Hi, Rayna. I missed my audition.
I lost my head!

31
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,701
No, listen, I have to go.

32
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,272
l'm with David.

33
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,070
Help yourself to whatever. Maria will
clean up. Set the alarm before you go.

34
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,649
And...

35
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,554
you are the greatest.

36
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:55,750
Bye, honey.

37
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:58,987
Bye, honey.
l'll call you later.

38
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:00,062
When?

39
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:03,961
- When?
- Soon!

40
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:50,248
Did you reserve the court?

41
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:53,754
Easy. I can't handle heavy
conversation at this ungodly hour.

42
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:57,225
Sorry to do this early,
but I gotta be done by 10:00.

43
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:01,258
You're not gonna make
the 8:45, are you?

44
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:02,993
- How did you find me?
- David Aames...

45
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:05,934
you have to check the colors
for the new issue of Rise.

46
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:09,736
- What are the colors?
- Yellow and red or traditional white.

47
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:14,343
- Gotta think about it.
- David, please.

48
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,348
Don't be late for the 10:00
with the board.

49
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,214
Don't tell anybody where I am.
I don't care if God calls.

50
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,221
- I'm very, very busy.
- Yeah.

51
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:29,991
- Can't you get rid of that board?
- The Seven Dwarfs? No.

52
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:32,158
Those people drive you nuts.

53
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:34,600
And that was the desire
of my father who hired them.

54
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:40,607
You fucked Julie Gianni again,
didn't you?

55
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:44,204
I know someone was there
when I called.

56
00:07:44,314 --> 00:07:46,249
You had that tone.

57
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:50,447
"No, I got a cold.
I'm hanging in tonight, you know."

58
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:51,682
I had a cold.

59
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:55,583
- I was alone.
- Fine.

60
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:58,254
- You do what you want with your life.
- Thanks.

61
00:07:58,364 --> 00:08:01,232
But one day you'll know
what love truly is.

62
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:03,495
It's the sour and the sweet.

63
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:07,131
I know sour, which allows me
to appreciate the sweet.

64
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:10,575
Julie Gianni is a friend.

65
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:13,273
Sometimes we sleep together.

66
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:16,882
What? What?

67
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:19,819
- What?
- My dream girl...

68
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:22,118
Julie Gianni...

69
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:25,388
is your fuck buddy.

70
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:28,330
- What do you wanna listen to?
- Slow down, man.

71
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:31,663
What do we got here?
Barcelona, Looper.

72
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:34,099
Radiohead?

73
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:35,695
Look out! Look out!

74
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:43,675
Fuck!

75
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:49,049
We almost died.

76
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:51,454
- I know.
- Use your fuckin' head!

77
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:53,924
My own death was in front of me,
and you know what happened?

78
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:56,496
Your life flashed
before my eyes.

79
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:59,692
- How was it?
- Almost worth dying for.

80
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:04,032
We're at the front door.
We're coming up now.

81
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,403
- Good morning, sir. Sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

82
00:09:06,508 --> 00:09:08,703
- Eaten yet?
- What's that?

83
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:09,779
Good morning.

84
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,212
David, you were playing racquetball.
l've been covering you for an hour.

85
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:15,648
l'm saving your ass
and you're playing racquetball.

86
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:16,845
Thank you, Fritz.

87
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:19,752
We are now exiting the elevator.
The board is not happy.

88
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:22,223
- Good morning, Beatrice.
- Hello, David.

89
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,921
You're in the Post today. Courtney Love
called to see if you got her e-mail.

90
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,898
And Graydon Carter and Shelley Wanger
called to see if dinner's still on.

91
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,835
- Cool.
- Art department needs the colors...

92
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,406
- yellow and red or white?
- Good morning, David.

93
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,032
And did I mention the board
is pissed you're late?

94
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,439
Hey, David! Hold up!

95
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,638
Which one?

96
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:43,182
Wait. This one?
David!

97
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,445
Okay, they're all waiting for you.

98
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:48,886
- You changed your hair.
- Yes. And David...

99
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,220
opinions are expected.

100
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:04,500
Do you dream about the board...
the Seven Dwarfs as you call them?

101
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,600
Sneezy, Bashful...

102
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:07,769
Sleepy...

103
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,937
Happy...

104
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:10,207
Doc...

105
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:11,474
Dopey...

106
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,414
and of course, Grumpy.

107
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,043
How was Aspen?

108
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:17,280
Good.

109
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,756
Now, I want answers
and I want them now.

110
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,594
How's it going?

111
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:33,231
They still look at me
as if l was 11 years old.

112
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,241
He's going to inherit everything.

113
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:38,072
He gets it all.

114
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:40,508
You're scared of your dreams,
aren't you?

115
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:42,516
It's a nightmare either way.

116
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:44,643
Is that how you explain
what's happened to you?

117
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:47,382
- What?
- What happened to your face?

118
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,423
- l'm not talking to you anymore.
- You don't wanna show me your face?

119
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:52,927
No!

120
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:59,603
- Do you know why you're here?
- Conversation, the coffee...

121
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:02,936
David, the part where
we parry and joust...

122
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,738
and get to know each other
bit by bit...

123
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,540
No. No can do.

124
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:10,844
We'll have to skip that because
you've been charged with murder.

125
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:14,752
In four weeks, a judge
will determine your fate...

126
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:16,653
based on what I write.

127
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:20,694
- So you will talk to me.
- There is no murder.

128
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:24,857
There is no murder!

129
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,128
It never happened!

130
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:31,696
- I don't have to talk to anybody!
- Want me to help?

131
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:33,969
- Get the fuck away from me.
- You take it easy, sunshine.

132
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:36,671
Take it easy, Face.
Your whole story's full of holes!

133
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,442
Stop. Stop!

134
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:40,384
Please leave right now.
l'll take responsibility.

135
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:41,510
Please leave right now.
l'll take responsibility.

136
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:44,384
Please leave right now.
He's got control.

137
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,391
I'm gonna get you,
daddy's boy little freak.

138
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:51,395
- My parents are dead, you fuck!
- Enough!

139
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,926
Is that true?

140
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:57,935
- Good cop, bad cop...
- That you're a daddy's boy?

141
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:02,736
Primer on David Aames Senior.

142
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:05,175
My father wasn 't built
for the 21st century.

143
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,544
He never went to McDonald's,
not once.

144
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:09,776
He never watched television,
and yet...

145
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:13,480
his biggest magazine
is still the TV Digest.

146
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,116
He and my mother threw the grandest
parties of the literary world.

147
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:19,217
Ballooned.
Jumped out of airplanes.

148
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:20,626
He sought adventure.

149
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,960
His autobiography is the manual...

150
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:25,330
for every cutthroat publisher
in New York City.

151
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:28,234
It's called Defending the Kingdom.

152
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:29,931
l've read it.

153
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,032
Page 127...

154
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:35,136
"David Jr. was a delight
as a child."

155
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:38,045
Did I miss something here?
Was that all he wrote about you?

156
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:42,449
I don't think he ever
got over the fact...

157
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:45,748
that l'm absolutely...

158
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:48,294
terrified of heights.

159
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:51,524
The irony continues.

160
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:55,733
When he and my mother were run over
by a drunken teenager...

161
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:58,829
on New Year's Eve
ten years ago...

162
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,464
he left the keys...

163
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:03,443
to the kingdom...

164
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:04,808
to me.

165
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:06,472
Fifty-one percent control.

166
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:09,177
Forty-nine percent going to a group
of seven board members...

167
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:13,552
who all thought they were
first in line.

168
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:16,991
And you believe the board...
the Seven Dwarfs...

169
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:20,622
put you here to take control
of your company?

170
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:24,563
What do you care?

171
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,228
We're just talking.

172
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,765
And tonight's Wednesday night...

173
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,676
and I go to Black Angus for dinner
with my two daughters on Wednesdays.

174
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,044
So I'll have to leave soon.

175
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,381
You do understand that our time
is limited, don't you?

176
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,752
If I talk...

177
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,090
you'll just think l'm crazy.

178
00:13:58,943 --> 00:14:02,242
With all the possible respect
I can offer a man...

179
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:06,249
wearing a latex mask and spouting
conspiracy theories, David...

180
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:10,315
believe me,
you've crossed that bridge.

181
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:13,219
Enjoy your dinner.

182
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:18,754
There are five basic emotions
in life, David.

183
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:24,400
Tell me,
what emotion gripped him...

184
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:26,837
before he entered that cell?

185
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:29,432
Was it guilt...

186
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:30,943
hate...

187
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,080
shame...

188
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:37,782
revenge...

189
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:46,789
love?

190
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:51,227
I'm completely on the wrong track,
aren't I?

191
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:58,166
Who needs ice?

192
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:02,374
David, happy birthday.

193
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:06,009
You have got the greatest taste
in shoes, bar none anywhere.

194
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:10,156
- Emma, have you met Lynette?
- I fear what we may have in common.

195
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:14,353
David, did you invite the entire
Olympic snowboarding team?

196
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:15,860
Tonight is my birthday.

197
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:18,592
- Say happy birthday to David.
- Happy birthday.

198
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:23,504
Welcome to Graceland.

199
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:29,543
Happy birthday,
you son of a bitch.

200
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:30,704
Happy birthday.

201
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,078
Hey, friends of me, hello.

202
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:39,420
- Let the fun ensue.
- Living Stereo will be on-line soon.

203
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:43,893
It is the great John Coltrane.
They would love an article on it.

204
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:46,931
lf you like it,
it's an amazing prototype.

205
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,269
- Excuse me.
- No, no. Thank you. That's okay.

206
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:58,069
- Literary god, Brian Shelby.
- Happy birthday.

207
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:00,511
And all the usual shit
people say to each other...

208
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:03,481
- How you doing?
- Living the dream, baby.

209
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,148
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- The pleasure of Sofia Serrano.

210
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:10,816
We met today at the library,
if you can believe that.

211
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:13,623
Sorry about my coat.
It's too big for your closet.

212
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:17,495
- We were pretending to be intellectuals.
- It's amazing. I love your coat.

213
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,865
I overdressed.
I mean, I underdressed.

214
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,461
l'll continue like you're both
actually listening to me.

215
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:25,474
Do you have another room
to put it in?

216
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:27,135
I have ceased to exist.

217
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:30,146
Madison Square Garden is nearby.
It might fit there.

218
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:32,808
Happy birthday.

219
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,943
- We picked it out together.
- Thank you.

220
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:36,817
We picked it out together.

221
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:38,651
- We.
- You're welcome.

222
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:43,563
Stop flirting and open it.

223
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,501
- Let's get a drink.
- Yes.

224
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:50,867
l'll leave this upstairs.

225
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,048
- l'll be right back.
- Okay.

226
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:10,254
- Listen.
- Hey, Tommy.

227
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,420
No, no, don't blow me off.

228
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,228
l'm all packed. l'm going
back to London and I understand.

229
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:19,462
You put me up for the other attorney's
job so you didn't have to fire me.

230
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,939
That's a classy move and your father
would have done the same.

231
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,771
It's okay, Tommy.

232
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,437
I became incompetent.

233
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:31,541
Is there anything more unbecoming
than an aging mascot?

234
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:34,120
I cared for your father.

235
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,553
I lived and breathed for him.

236
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:39,126
These guys, the Seven Dwarfs...

237
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,888
they think you're stupid...

238
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:43,088
a corporate hazard,
a rogue.

239
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:45,793
They are gonna find a way
to get you out, David.

240
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:47,970
They're lined up for your office,
your life...

241
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,164
They're lined up for your office,
your life...

242
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:50,670
your position.

243
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:52,799
They're working day and night...

244
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,844
to cheat you out
of your 51% vote.

245
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:59,178
And they're gonna sell
this tradition of words...

246
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:02,411
so they can eat
in a better cafeteria.

247
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:05,382
But what they don't know is this.

248
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,822
People will read again!

249
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:11,924
I got it.

250
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,434
They even got a nickname for you
behind your back.

251
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:20,640
Citizen Dildo.

252
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,773
You got great instincts...

253
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:26,870
but I say this with complete love.

254
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,450
Claim your life...

255
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:31,542
learn to be an asshole...

256
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,554
Two's enough.

257
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:37,287
Forgive me.

258
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:40,294
I still believe
in this family, David...

259
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:43,264
even if it's only you.

260
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,891
Get Tipp out of here.

261
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:47,232
Drive him home,
and in the morning...

262
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:49,533
tell him he's rehired
with a 50% raise.

263
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:52,576
Give him that big office across
the hall from the Seven Dwarfs.

264
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:54,577
And set up a meeting
with the other attorneys.

265
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,205
l'm gonna be in early tomorrow.

266
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,784
Well, earlier than usual.

267
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:13,057
Hello, handsome.

268
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:16,662
l've come to wish you
a happy birthday.

269
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:17,966
Oh, man.

270
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:22,336
I didn't invite you, Julie.

271
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:25,175
- That was a little weird.
- That's how it works with parties...

272
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:27,647
you have to be invited.

273
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:34,256
l'm mad at you, you dick.

274
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,918
We made love four times
the other night.

275
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:42,096
- Is that good?
- Two's good.

276
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,533
Three is very good.

277
00:19:45,638 --> 00:19:47,765
- But four...
- Four's pretty good?

278
00:19:47,873 --> 00:19:49,773
Four is...

279
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:56,414
Four is what?

280
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:00,785
Hold me, and then l'll leave.

281
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:03,880
And you can go back and talk
to that cute brunette.

282
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:05,391
Four is what?

283
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:09,726
I don't wanna meet your fancy friends.
I knew them when I was fancy too.

284
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,032
Four is what?

285
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:15,695
She looks like a moth.

286
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:18,706
A moth?

287
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:21,801
Sometimes I worry about you,
that some clever girl...

288
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:25,848
in a big silly coat is gonna come
along and play you just right.

289
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,714
Then l'll lose my friend.

290
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:31,186
And there won't be any chicken soup
parties for me and you.

291
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:50,442
Bad.

292
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:57,246
When will you call me?
Don't say "soon."

293
00:20:57,353 --> 00:21:00,015
I hate it when you say "soon".

294
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,988
Danny Bramson gave him that
for his birthday last year.

295
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:07,359
So this is what's become
of rock and roll...

296
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:12,698
a smashed guitar behind a glass case
displayed on some rich guy's wall.

297
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,136
It was a gift, actually.

298
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:21,073
- I like it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

299
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,081
So how did you
get all this stuff...

300
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,980
this apartment, this life?

301
00:21:30,124 --> 00:21:31,148
I see.

302
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,863
How 'bout if you help me,
unless l'm horning in here.

303
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:44,838
- You are, but the food's good.
- I have a problem. I got a stalker.

304
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:47,273
It doesn't sound life threatening.

305
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:50,470
I need for you to pretend we are
having a scintillating conversation...

306
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,981
and you are wildly entertained.

307
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,347
- I know it's tough.
- I'll improvise.

308
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:59,082
She's across the room and burning
a hole in my back now, isn't she?

309
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,249
Red dress, strappy shoes?

310
00:22:03,094 --> 00:22:05,222
Wow. She's really staring at you.

311
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,202
- Shit.
- And she seems to be crying.

312
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:14,364
Less happy.

313
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,073
I think she's the saddest girl
to ever hold a martini.

314
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,816
- Jennifer Kelly.
- Hi, Jennifer.

315
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:31,548
- You have another apartment.
- Sort of a day office. Come on.

316
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:38,834
- I am not going in there.
- I am. Good night.

317
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:08,129
- I hear her coming.
- Really?

318
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:22,407
- Hi.
- How are you?

319
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:26,845
We're safe, but l've got
nothing to drink.

320
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:29,050
Who did these paintings?

321
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:32,095
This is Joni Mitchell.

322
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:34,164
This one is Monet.

323
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:36,597
And this one...

324
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,294
was done by me.

325
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:39,700
It is a snowboard.

326
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:42,865
Well, two of them are geniuses.

327
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:46,845
That is the real thing.

328
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:49,506
His paintbrush painted
the vanilla sky.

329
00:23:49,616 --> 00:23:52,245
And his canvas.

330
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:54,548
My mother's.

331
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,426
- l'm surprised you're surprised.
- I can't keep this banter going.

332
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:07,366
- Me neither.
- I caught you.

333
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,132
Brian, come in here.

334
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,572
- What's going on?
- Your friends are fun and l'm drunk.

335
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:15,236
- Julie Gianni is stalking me.
- She looked dangerous.

336
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:18,405
Nobody stalks me,
so I drink.

337
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:22,282
- We're all out up here.
- Finish my Jack and Coke.

338
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:23,945
- Stupid glass.
- I got it.

339
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:27,321
- It's the stupid guy holding it.
- Don't worry. No big deal.

340
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,860
I'll go get us something.
Jacks and Cokes?

341
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:32,192
I better hit it. I drank
too much and I didn't eat.

342
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:34,289
- The party's just starting.
- For you it is.

343
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:36,301
You cannot go.
You are my guest of honor.

344
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:37,495
Fuck you, David.

345
00:24:37,604 --> 00:24:40,506
You're paying me to write my novel,
so you own me.

346
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:43,634
I don't own you. You are brilliant,
good-looking, handsome.

347
00:24:43,744 --> 00:24:46,304
But why'd you have to hit
on Sofia?

348
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:51,743
- I wasn't hitting on Sofia.
- Fine. Whatever you say.

349
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:54,447
- l'm crazy. l'm blind.
- You're not blind.

350
00:24:54,557 --> 00:24:58,516
You're drinking Jack and when
you do you start in with that...

351
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:00,789
Frank Sinatra,
she shot me down...

352
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:02,661
give me a cigarette
king of sad thing.

353
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:05,564
- That I do. Give me a cigarette.
- l'll find one.

354
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:09,902
Wait. You're rich and women love
you and l'm from Ohio and drunk.

355
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,568
- Can I tell you the truth?
- Everybody does.

356
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,110
I dig her.

357
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,410
And l've never said this to you
before about any girl...

358
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,974
but she could be...
could be... could be...

359
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:23,886
could be the girl
of my fucking dreams.

360
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,356
- You're not from Ohio.
- I know.

361
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,794
But if she fucks up our friendship,
she can go to hell.

362
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:32,798
I won't allow it.
We are bros.

363
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,300
- I feel the same way.
- Sure you do.

364
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:37,702
- Hi.
- How you doing?

365
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:42,106
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

366
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:44,203
Where are you going?

367
00:25:44,314 --> 00:25:47,750
I am Frank,
and Frank must go.

368
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:52,013
- What?
- I good you bid evening.

369
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:53,784
Wait. l'll go with you.

370
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,887
- Stay, baby.
- l'll give you a ride home later.

371
00:25:57,996 --> 00:26:00,988
- No, I have to work tomorrow.
- You...

372
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,026
You are in great hands.

373
00:26:04,136 --> 00:26:07,368
l'm just humoring myself
that my opinion matters.

374
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,007
You will never know
the exquisite pain...

375
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,246
of the guy who goes home alone...

376
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:24,849
because without the bitter, baby,
the sweet ain't as sweet.

377
00:26:26,328 --> 00:26:28,228
Have a good time.

378
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:33,935
The sweet and sour speech again.

379
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:49,377
- Why are you scared of heights?
- Many people are scared of heights.

380
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:51,649
It's not the height
that bothers me.

381
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:54,693
It's the impact
that terrifies me.

382
00:27:01,434 --> 00:27:03,027
I won't stay long.

383
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:04,695
Hey, Paolo.

384
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:07,999
Hello.

385
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:10,270
I have to take you for a walk.

386
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,280
l'm glad he protects you.
He's a lethal canine.

387
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:18,046
I love living here,
and I refuse to clean up.

388
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:19,553
No problem.

389
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:23,023
I have to work around the clock
to keep this place.

390
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:26,721
- You really are a dancer.
- For 14 years.

391
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,800
But I don't dance like you dance.

392
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:32,901
Do you want something to drink?

393
00:27:33,004 --> 00:27:34,972
Sure.

394
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:40,941
Hey, beautiful, beautiful boy.

395
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:44,078
What do you want
for dinner tonight?

396
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:45,742
Do you want fried chicken?

397
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:57,155
I like your life.

398
00:27:57,265 --> 00:28:00,099
Well, it's mine
and you can't have it.

399
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:05,900
I don't wanna know the story
behind this photo.

400
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:09,809
- Who's Sergio?
- It's a nickname.

401
00:28:09,913 --> 00:28:12,849
- Your nickname is Sergio?
- It's a long story.

402
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,147
And we don't know each other.

403
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:19,155
- So many secrets.
- That's because l'm an arms dealer.

404
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:21,657
- l've never known an arms dealer.
- You do now.

405
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:25,620
What about you?
What's your nickname?

406
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:33,330
Citizen Dildo.

407
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:38,104
You are not staying over.

408
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:45,619
Never run a company. Stay an artist.
Stay an arms dealer.

409
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,248
Oh, please. Somehow
I can't play the violin for you.

410
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:53,351
Although, it must be difficult
controlling all those people's lives.

411
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:59,232
Everyone at that party is connected
to you for survival in some way.

412
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:01,396
It seems.

413
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,176
Ever been married?

414
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:13,580
Did you ever accept any
of your 12,000 proposals?

415
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,177
12,008. No.

416
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:19,452
And you moved to New York to dance,
paint, act and deal arms?

417
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,956
Right.

418
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:25,225
Do you wanna hear Jeff Buckley
or Vicki Carr?

419
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,095
Jeff Buckley or Vicki Carr?

420
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:30,368
Both simultaneously.

421
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:35,407
Everyone said,
"Don't go to New York".

422
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,604
I just think good things
will happen...

423
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:40,375
if you're a good person
with a good attitude.

424
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:41,848
Don't you think?

425
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:47,357
You think l'm naive?

426
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:50,483
No. I really don't.

427
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:52,688
I dug her completely.

428
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:58,261
Somehow l'd found the last
semi-guyless girl in New York City.

429
00:29:59,204 --> 00:30:01,764
I have to get to sleep.

430
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:06,005
Truthfully, I also work mornings
as a dental assistant.

431
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:10,045
Boy, am I going
to the wrong dentist.

432
00:30:11,317 --> 00:30:14,412
And you didn't immediately
wanna sleep with her?

433
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:18,151
Well, you know,
l'm a pleasure delayer.

434
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:23,158
- How does that work?
- Pleasure delayer?

435
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:25,825
You don't know?

436
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:28,529
You keep a relationship casual...

437
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:31,573
until the absolute breaking point.

438
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:36,906
And then one evening
or afternoon or morning...

439
00:30:37,014 --> 00:30:39,574
it could be months from now.

440
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,516
You know how it works.

441
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:46,585
No, actually I don't.

442
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:49,718
l've been married for 22 years.

443
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:52,024
You've got dinner
with your daughters.

444
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,490
That's right, I do.

445
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:58,730
Back then I had intricate systems
with women...

446
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,466
you wouldn't believe.

447
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,274
Like what?

448
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:11,975
Hey, Doc, don't get melancholy over
the 30 seconds you were single...

449
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:14,248
a long time ago.

450
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:17,224
- That's what you think l'm doing?
- Oh, yes.

451
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:19,991
You might be right.

452
00:31:21,097 --> 00:31:24,465
Let's continue.
Time is not our friend.

453
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:59,699
Just our shortcomings,
that's all we're allowed to draw.

454
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:04,879
l've never drawn such
a true likeness before.

455
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:09,648
Mine's finished.

456
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:11,152
Already?

457
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:18,860
Done.

458
00:32:22,768 --> 00:32:25,760
- That's how you see me?
- Maybe I didn't add enough money.

459
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:29,569
No, something you'd see on a wall
in a steak house in hell.

460
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:31,769
It's wonderful.
Sign it.

461
00:32:38,285 --> 00:32:40,014
Let's see yours.

462
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,718
Give me that.

463
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,808
I feel bad.

464
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,070
You said to draw a caricature.

465
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,011
I know. I couldn't.

466
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,310
I saw you like that.

467
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,455
It's very good.

468
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:15,857
l'll sell it to you.

469
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:18,726
You monster.

470
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:19,992
How much for it?

471
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:24,767
One kiss.

472
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:32,970
That smile is gonna be
the end of me.

473
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,011
And what happens when
your friend calls you tomorrow?

474
00:33:40,957 --> 00:33:44,553
He just met you a few hours
before me. He'd do the same.

475
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:47,324
I see that friendship
is important to you.

476
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:49,296
It is. It is.

477
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,269
And as his best friend...

478
00:33:53,371 --> 00:33:57,671
I know he's trying to finish a novel
about inadequacy and rejection.

479
00:33:57,777 --> 00:34:00,837
So the longer that I stay,
the better it is for his career.

480
00:34:02,982 --> 00:34:05,952
Your career is the one
l'd worry about.

481
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:14,187
Sorry.

482
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:18,098
No. No, you're more right
than you even know.

483
00:34:19,702 --> 00:34:22,637
I used to be one of those guys
that just...

484
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:26,465
snowboarded through his life...

485
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:28,635
with no focus...

486
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:31,370
whatsoever.

487
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:33,382
When did you change?

488
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:35,475
About five minutes ago.

489
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,419
Every passing minute is another
chance to turn it all around.

490
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:51,126
And to those who think
that you're a charlatan?

491
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:52,670
I understand.

492
00:34:52,772 --> 00:34:55,241
The perception of a head
frozen somewhere...

493
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:57,902
waiting for reanimation
sounds like science fiction.

494
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:01,277
- What are you watching?
- It's the greatest show.

495
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:03,943
It's called Sofia.

496
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:06,145
It is at the frontier
of a new science.

497
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,778
Life Extension.

498
00:35:09,091 --> 00:35:11,355
How do you accomplish
such a thing?

499
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,156
l've seen this 30 times.

500
00:35:14,263 --> 00:35:16,095
Life is full of surprises.

501
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:20,932
But the greatest surprise of all is
that this doesn 't have to end ever.

502
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,836
We did a story on this guy.
He owns half of Arizona.

503
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:27,104
- Is he a fraud?
- How would you ever know?

504
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:28,439
Good point.

505
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:31,675
Can you unfreeze a human life?

506
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:34,582
Take the case of Benny the dog.
Benny's a dog.

507
00:35:34,686 --> 00:35:38,885
He was frozen for three months and
thawed out to live a normal life.

508
00:35:38,992 --> 00:35:41,358
That's comforting?

509
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:44,693
It's safe for Benny.
l'm in.

510
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,139
We'd better watch out.

511
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:06,314
Raymond Tooley,
creator of Life Extension.

512
00:36:06,423 --> 00:36:09,790
The book is Life: The Sequel.

513
00:36:17,502 --> 00:36:20,961
- Where are you going?
- I left my number on your fridge.

514
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:24,034
Come here.
I want to tell you a secret.

515
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:48,598
I meant that to be your forehead.

516
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:55,872
Thank you for the inspiration.

517
00:36:57,214 --> 00:37:01,014
I will now attempt to run
my company showing compassion...

518
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,110
for the seething throng
of my partners...

519
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,884
who root quietly for me to fail.

520
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:09,860
And for things you don't even know.

521
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:11,122
Thank you.

522
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:15,765
l'm gonna go to work.
I have a company to run.

523
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:21,641
Pleasure delayer.

524
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:04,420
Hey, handsome.

525
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:06,083
You're following me.

526
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:08,927
Just a little bit.

527
00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:11,259
I wanted to finish
what we were talking about.

528
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:12,264
And?

529
00:38:13,902 --> 00:38:18,362
How did it go with our moth girl?
She turn into a butterfly for you?

530
00:38:20,076 --> 00:38:21,634
Yes, she did.

531
00:38:23,112 --> 00:38:24,977
She did.

532
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:29,980
I can tell by the way you were
walking you didn't sleep with her.

533
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:36,084
Let me guess. You haven't slept
with her because...

534
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,856
it's more fun
when you can draw it out.

535
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:41,899
Sex just isn't as good if a woman
hasn't told her friends...

536
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:43,730
she'd never sleep with you.

537
00:38:45,204 --> 00:38:48,072
Right on the money, Julie.

538
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:51,371
She must be exhausted from trying
to be witty for you all night.

539
00:38:51,478 --> 00:38:52,809
Hey, Julie.

540
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:55,845
Sorry.

541
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:58,611
It's okay.

542
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,212
You never seem to be there for your
friends until they've given up on you.

543
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:11,564
l'm not blowing you off.
I just...

544
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:14,603
I wanna be alone
for a little bit. Trust me.

545
00:39:14,704 --> 00:39:17,265
I have a lot of things
I have to take care of.

546
00:39:17,374 --> 00:39:20,104
And if we're friends,
which we are...

547
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,476
okay, then
you'll understand that.

548
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:26,709
l'm sorry.
I got weird.

549
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:31,820
I missed an audition and...

550
00:39:31,924 --> 00:39:34,688
it just made me feel bad you
didn't invite me to your party.

551
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:43,261
You wanna make it up to me?

552
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,498
I won't tell a soul.

553
00:40:04,829 --> 00:40:07,559
Would you do a story on me
if I made a CD?

554
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:09,895
Sure I would.

555
00:40:16,842 --> 00:40:18,434
Do you like my music?

556
00:40:20,513 --> 00:40:22,447
It's vivid.

557
00:40:26,754 --> 00:40:29,723
Well, if I weren't me,
I would buy a CD by me.

558
00:40:29,823 --> 00:40:32,690
Well, you know,
if you can reach one person...

559
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:36,195
Wow.

560
00:40:42,037 --> 00:40:45,438
What's happiness to you, David?

561
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47,772
What's happiness to me?

562
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:52,337
- What is happiness...
- 'Cause for me...

563
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,215
this is happiness...

564
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,948
just being with you.

565
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,822
There's one thing
that bothers me.

566
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:11,097
Why did you tell Brian
that I was your fuck buddy?

567
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:15,504
I didn't tell him that.
I didn't say that.

568
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:21,005
- When did you stop caring, David?
- Caring about what?

569
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:24,483
About the consequences of
the promises that you've made.

570
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:27,487
- Promises?
- Yeah, the promises.

571
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,850
I thought...

572
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:34,729
Get the fuck...
What are you talking about?

573
00:41:34,831 --> 00:41:37,892
Do you understand how hard it is
to pretend to be your buddy?

574
00:41:39,236 --> 00:41:40,828
David, I love you.

575
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:44,270
I fucking love you!

576
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:46,943
I fucking love you!

577
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:48,012
Fuck!

578
00:41:48,112 --> 00:41:50,171
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

579
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:53,248
Don't do this.
Don't do this.

580
00:41:53,352 --> 00:41:55,582
You fucked me four times
the other night.

581
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:58,249
You've been inside me.

582
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:01,225
I swallowed your cum.
That means something.

583
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:05,299
Slow down.

584
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:07,830
Four times... it means something.

585
00:42:07,937 --> 00:42:09,837
- Four times.
- Stop the car.

586
00:42:09,939 --> 00:42:13,103
Twenty-four hours a day, I live
with this aching possibility...

587
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:15,700
that you might call me
to do something.

588
00:42:15,812 --> 00:42:18,373
Let's go to your house.
I wanna see where you live.

589
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:22,517
Just slow down.
I want you to stop the car!

590
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,680
Don't you know when you sleep
with someone...

591
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,191
your body makes a promise
whether you do or not?

592
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:34,094
Tell me something, David.
Do you believe in God?

593
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:41,102
What are you doing?

594
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:44,375
Okay, I love you.
I love you.

595
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:54,116
Don't do it!

596
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:50,850
You're amazing.

597
00:43:53,424 --> 00:43:55,654
Did you get to work all right?

598
00:43:58,997 --> 00:44:03,594
No, actually,
I had a horrible dream.

599
00:44:03,703 --> 00:44:06,194
You dreamed you'd never
see me again.

600
00:44:06,305 --> 00:44:09,001
I left your apartment,
I went downstairs to the car...

601
00:44:09,108 --> 00:44:12,875
and my friend, the stalker,
had followed me there.

602
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:17,444
Yes. And she wanted
to talk to me.

603
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:21,750
And I remember I had this buzz,
you know...

604
00:44:21,856 --> 00:44:24,553
that buzz from you and me.

605
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:29,529
I think my mind was still on
that terrible drawing of me.

606
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:34,465
But she was upset...

607
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:37,501
about... I don't know.

608
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:40,133
I got in the car and...

609
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,179
she drove off a bridge...

610
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,717
and committed suicide
with me in the car.

611
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:49,844
I thought you were going
straight to work.

612
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:55,184
But I survived...

613
00:44:56,295 --> 00:45:00,426
with my arm and my face...

614
00:45:01,935 --> 00:45:03,926
reconstructed.

615
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:06,700
And what's worse...

616
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:10,209
is that I can't wake up.

617
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:37,907
And how was your house
after the party?

618
00:45:40,746 --> 00:45:42,146
Party?

619
00:45:43,716 --> 00:45:45,115
What party?

620
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:46,776
The party.

621
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:51,015
Remember?

622
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:54,793
Red dress, strappy shoes.

623
00:45:56,631 --> 00:46:00,431
I spilled something
on your shirt.

624
00:46:00,535 --> 00:46:02,435
Sweet and sour.

625
00:46:03,906 --> 00:46:07,535
And the saddest girl
to ever hold a martini.

626
00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:32,868
My dreams are a cruel joke.

627
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,675
They taunt me.

628
00:46:45,587 --> 00:46:47,919
Even in my dreams,
l'm an idiot...

629
00:46:48,023 --> 00:46:50,753
who know she's about
to wake up to reality.

630
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,524
If I could only avoid sleep.

631
00:46:58,468 --> 00:47:00,528
But I can't.

632
00:47:00,638 --> 00:47:03,163
I try to tell myself
what to dream.

633
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:07,072
I try to dream that l'm flying.

634
00:47:07,178 --> 00:47:08,770
Something free.

635
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,178
It never works.

636
00:47:20,293 --> 00:47:23,229
Is that the only thing you dream?

637
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:27,964
I don't... I don't remember.

638
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:35,367
Do you dream about
the car accident?

639
00:47:37,046 --> 00:47:39,810
Here's what you remember
from a coma.

640
00:47:40,616 --> 00:47:42,016
Nothing.

641
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:47,583
What happened next?

642
00:47:47,691 --> 00:47:50,490
What really happened?

643
00:47:50,594 --> 00:47:54,496
What, didn't you read
the file?

644
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:56,567
I was out for
three-and-a-half weeks.

645
00:47:56,668 --> 00:48:00,627
My face and my arm shattered and
my jaw was broken in four places.

646
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,436
No surgery could be performed
because of the coma.

647
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:09,571
You can't feel the darkness...

648
00:48:09,682 --> 00:48:11,048
or numbness.

649
00:48:12,252 --> 00:48:14,720
You can't even feel.

650
00:48:14,822 --> 00:48:16,517
And then...

651
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:18,785
I came back to life.

652
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:23,420
Just like that dog.

653
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:26,000
Benny. You know, Benny the dog.

654
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:29,028
Benny. Benny the dog.

655
00:48:29,138 --> 00:48:32,540
Only my life
was no longer normal.

656
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,902
There are blinding migraines now...
nerve damage.

657
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,380
Why?

658
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:42,317
This is how
big business operates...

659
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,445
random accidents...

660
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:47,047
a lifestyle mishap.

661
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:48,854
They are not coincidences.

662
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:53,729
How do you think
airtight contracts are broken?

663
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:57,132
These are power upheavals.

664
00:48:57,237 --> 00:48:59,034
l'm from Ohio.

665
00:48:59,974 --> 00:49:01,908
We don't have power upheavals.

666
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:05,035
They are in the news every day
right between the lines.

667
00:49:07,482 --> 00:49:09,416
Someone did this to me.

668
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:13,251
My father wrote about this
in his book.

669
00:49:13,355 --> 00:49:15,688
Chapter one, page one...

670
00:49:15,792 --> 00:49:17,350
paragraph one...

671
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,758
"What is the answer to 99
out of 100 questions?

672
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:24,565
Money."

673
00:49:24,668 --> 00:49:27,068
David, look,
I don't wanna worry you.

674
00:49:27,171 --> 00:49:29,970
l'm holding them off,
but we got a situation here.

675
00:49:30,075 --> 00:49:33,511
The bylaws of the board
protect your 51% vote...

676
00:49:33,611 --> 00:49:35,910
only if you're mentally acute.

677
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:38,573
l'm sorry that poor girl died...

678
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,619
but you've handed the board
a real gift with your mishap.

679
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,020
They'd like to declare you
incapacitated.

680
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:48,060
But you're back.

681
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:51,962
You sound good to me,
so let's fight the fuckers...

682
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:53,966
and have a full recovery.

683
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:56,333
And maybe you should let
people see you, yeah?

684
00:49:56,438 --> 00:49:59,339
The last time we were together
you were in a coma...

685
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:01,932
and you were very
fucking rude to me.

686
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:04,673
You didn't say a word.

687
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:09,047
Yes, well, the rumors of my death
have been mildly exaggerated.

688
00:50:13,257 --> 00:50:15,191
Who could I trust?

689
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:18,091
The ants were taking over
the anthill.

690
00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:21,998
Who could I trust?

691
00:51:22,903 --> 00:51:26,566
The cranial structure
was based on 30 pins...

692
00:51:26,674 --> 00:51:30,133
and fastened by micro-panels
and bits of bone from the mandible.

693
00:51:30,245 --> 00:51:33,180
It appears the cartilage graphs
have maintained your cheek structure.

694
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:35,580
Unfortunately,
because you were in a coma...

695
00:51:35,685 --> 00:51:39,177
Doctors. Their power is in jargon,
so you study up.

696
00:51:39,288 --> 00:51:42,588
Is that the procedure for all
bilateral periorbital hematomas...

697
00:51:42,693 --> 00:51:44,627
in a LeFort Three fracture
of a comatose patient?

698
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:46,628
- In a LeFort Three?
- You do your best.

699
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:47,697
Absolutely.

700
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:51,064
The potential for intracranial
brain damage was too great.

701
00:51:51,169 --> 00:51:53,160
Beyond the cheek grafts,
Dr. Pomeranz...

702
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:55,831
are the pins fastened with any kind
of aluminum which could ionize...

703
00:51:55,941 --> 00:51:58,068
and cause that pressure
in my head?

704
00:51:58,177 --> 00:52:01,146
- l'm ready for another operation.
- We are working on processes.

705
00:52:01,247 --> 00:52:04,376
But you're specifically not at
the stage where we can experiment.

706
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,851
Experiment. Use me.

707
00:52:08,955 --> 00:52:11,424
The headaches will go away.

708
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:14,016
These are more than headaches.

709
00:52:14,128 --> 00:52:18,225
These are like steel plates
slicing through my every thought.

710
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:20,597
We're not cowboys.
We can't just wing it.

711
00:52:21,737 --> 00:52:24,035
Because I can't think straight
most of the time.

712
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,109
- We can increase your medication.
- Oh, yes, medication.

713
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,847
And there are things
that we'll continue to investigate.

714
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:34,611
However, there are so many others
who've not had the aesthetic benefit...

715
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,982
of plastic surgery
as you have.

716
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:41,654
This isn't about vanity,
Dr. Pomeranz.

717
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,660
This isn't about vanity.

718
00:52:43,762 --> 00:52:45,754
This is about functioning
in the world.

719
00:52:45,865 --> 00:52:47,958
It's my job to be out there
functioning.

720
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:51,834
l've got the money.
l'll pay any amount.

721
00:52:52,939 --> 00:52:54,839
Just invent something.

722
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:56,636
Just play jazz.

723
00:52:56,743 --> 00:52:58,836
You say you're
the best face man in New York.

724
00:52:58,945 --> 00:53:00,846
Fucking prove it.

725
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:06,816
- We could do something about your arm.
- Fuck my arm!

726
00:53:12,127 --> 00:53:14,028
Nobody here takes your feelings
for granted.

727
00:53:15,265 --> 00:53:18,200
We did prepare something for you
based on the preliminary examination.

728
00:53:18,301 --> 00:53:20,201
Tell me. Bring it on.

729
00:53:20,303 --> 00:53:22,704
It's sometimes useful
in the early stages of rejection.

730
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:26,805
It's a facial prosthetic.
It was two weeks in the making.

731
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,380
- Thank you, Carly.
- You're welcome, Doctor.

732
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:41,659
A facial prosthetic.

733
00:53:41,762 --> 00:53:43,730
The aesthetic replacement
does work...

734
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:46,629
emotionally and actually.

735
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:49,465
The plastic in the aesthetic shield
also blocks out abusive rays...

736
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:51,471
and assists in
the regeneration of cells.

737
00:53:54,008 --> 00:53:56,307
So it's an aesthetic
regenerative shield.

738
00:53:56,412 --> 00:53:58,004
That's correct. Exactly.

739
00:53:58,114 --> 00:54:01,140
The ergonomics of the plate barrier
allows it to interact reflexively...

740
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:03,685
with the movements
of your own face.

741
00:54:03,787 --> 00:54:05,220
I see.

742
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:09,053
- It's a helpful unit.
- Good.

743
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:12,027
Because for a minute there,
I thought we were talking...

744
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,928
about a fucking mask!

745
00:54:16,067 --> 00:54:17,695
It's only a mask...

746
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,438
if you treat it that way.

747
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:24,032
It's great. This completely
takes care of Halloween.

748
00:54:26,379 --> 00:54:29,712
But what about the other
364 days of the year?

749
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,092
A new form of me
began to take shape.

750
00:54:48,671 --> 00:54:51,333
I planned my reemergence...

751
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:53,433
like the Normandy invasion.

752
00:54:53,544 --> 00:54:55,876
Sofia. Sofia.

753
00:54:57,681 --> 00:55:00,480
Sofia Serrano.

754
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:03,421
l'll just say it.

755
00:55:03,521 --> 00:55:05,716
I did my homework.

756
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:08,259
I read every memo.

757
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,658
Thomas Tipp was right.

758
00:55:10,763 --> 00:55:12,663
People will read again.

759
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:17,962
I attended the monthly board meeting
with the Seven Dwarfs by video hookup.

760
00:55:18,071 --> 00:55:20,369
Because people
aren't buying books.

761
00:55:20,475 --> 00:55:24,411
- Let's invest.
- Oh, baby, this was war.

762
00:55:24,512 --> 00:55:27,846
I grew stronger in ways
l'd never known before.

763
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,941
And on December 5...

764
00:55:30,052 --> 00:55:32,543
my planes filled the sky.

765
00:55:32,654 --> 00:55:35,715
The return of David Aames, Jr...

766
00:55:35,825 --> 00:55:38,020
Citizen Dildo.

767
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,708
You won't believe this...

768
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:24,775
but this is me smiling.

769
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,320
It's been a long time.

770
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:37,019
I tried to see you,
but your people wouldn't let me.

771
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:39,825
I didn't want to see me, okay?

772
00:56:39,932 --> 00:56:42,093
But then...

773
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,668
I woke up today
and finally...

774
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:47,738
a good hair day.

775
00:56:51,344 --> 00:56:53,336
You wanna get together?

776
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,209
Sure.

777
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:01,920
- What?
- Let's go out and do something.

778
00:57:02,023 --> 00:57:03,752
This weekend.

779
00:57:03,858 --> 00:57:06,122
l'll cancel an operation or two.

780
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:08,594
We'll have fun...

781
00:57:08,698 --> 00:57:12,190
because I am all about fun.

782
00:57:15,472 --> 00:57:19,203
Okay, folks, our first guest tonight
is an amazing survival story.

783
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:21,403
Please welcome Benny the dog.

784
00:57:27,118 --> 00:57:29,781
So welcome to the show.
Thankyou verymuch forbeinghere.

785
00:57:29,888 --> 00:57:31,947
- You bet. My pleasure.
- I have so many questions.

786
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:35,425
To start off, tell us all
what has happened to Benny.

787
00:57:35,528 --> 00:57:37,621
What'sBennybeen through?

788
00:57:37,731 --> 00:57:40,666
Well, Benny fell into the water
near our home.

789
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:43,828
And he was frozen
in the Skykomish River.

790
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:45,098
In Washington.

791
00:57:45,206 --> 00:57:48,836
I went fishing, thinking he'd
been gone now for three months.

792
00:57:48,944 --> 00:57:52,345
And l see him
in a block of ice.

793
00:57:52,447 --> 00:57:55,439
He is thawed out now.
Is that correct?

794
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,981
He's not moving a lot.
l'm worried.

795
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:01,750
ShouldI get out some tongs?
l'm worried about the dog.

796
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:05,124
No, he's fine. He's just lost
a little bit of his friskiness.

797
00:58:05,229 --> 00:58:07,129
I would think so, yeah.

798
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:10,099
It's David.
l'm back in your life.

799
00:58:10,201 --> 00:58:12,692
I saw you earlier today.

800
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:17,504
I was just watching
our old friend Benny the dog...

801
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,009
on Conan...

802
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:22,279
and I thought of you.

803
00:58:23,482 --> 00:58:24,882
Whatever.

804
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,214
I loved seeing you today.

805
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:33,020
So I will see you soon.

806
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,995
You're a great dancer.

807
00:58:39,001 --> 00:58:40,400
Bye.

808
00:59:29,492 --> 00:59:32,052
- What you drinkin'?
- Nothing.

809
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:35,222
l'm in the mood for a cheap,
sugary, overpriced rhum and Coke.

810
00:59:35,332 --> 00:59:37,766
- So you want one?
- Is there any other kind?

811
00:59:37,868 --> 00:59:39,893
l'll get us some.

812
00:59:40,003 --> 00:59:41,904
Where is the bathroom?

813
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:45,567
It's behind...
over there by the place...

814
00:59:45,676 --> 00:59:48,076
by the girl who looks like Bjork.

815
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:50,080
- l'll be right back.
- Maybe I should...

816
00:59:52,451 --> 00:59:55,614
Hey, man, you look good.
How's your book?

817
00:59:55,722 --> 00:59:58,520
- Take it off.
- No, this is a facial shield.

818
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:02,117
It's an aesthetic prosthesis
these fucking doctors...

819
01:00:02,228 --> 01:00:04,527
Take off the mask, man.
It's freaking me out.

820
01:00:04,632 --> 01:00:06,031
I can't.

821
01:00:07,368 --> 01:00:10,236
It's my face.
This is my face.

822
01:00:10,338 --> 01:00:12,499
Trust me.
It's a little different.

823
01:00:12,607 --> 01:00:15,974
lf you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to chaperone.

824
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,080
- Sofia asked me.
- What?

825
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:21,616
She didn't want to be alone with me?
That's bullshit!

826
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:24,710
Because I think l'm being pretty
fucking cool about this whole thing.

827
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:26,722
Talk to a shrink.

828
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:30,282
Or you can call me sometime
instead of hiding in your apartment.

829
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,522
Don't take it out on a girl
you only met once.

830
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:36,226
Did she say that...

831
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:37,801
once?

832
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:39,803
Did she say
that I met her once?

833
01:00:39,905 --> 01:00:41,668
Just cut it out, okay?

834
01:00:41,774 --> 01:00:44,299
I miss the old you.

835
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,311
We all miss the old you...

836
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:49,211
because the new guy is shit.

837
01:00:51,284 --> 01:00:53,549
That came out wrong.
I love you.

838
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:55,417
Period.

839
01:00:55,523 --> 01:00:58,686
- How's your arm, man?
- Fuck you, Brian.

840
01:00:58,793 --> 01:01:00,785
How 'bout...

841
01:01:00,896 --> 01:01:02,454
no sympathy.

842
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:04,964
How 'bout that's
the deal we make, okay?

843
01:01:16,146 --> 01:01:18,876
Give me a Budweiser
and a shot of tequila.

844
01:01:18,983 --> 01:01:21,179
What kind of tequila?

845
01:01:22,921 --> 01:01:26,584
- What did you say to me?
- I said, what kind of tequila?

846
01:01:27,827 --> 01:01:30,193
Why don't you ask me
to my face, bitch?

847
01:01:34,668 --> 01:01:36,898
Patrn, if you have it.

848
01:02:06,137 --> 01:02:08,037
Another shot, another Bud.

849
01:02:08,139 --> 01:02:09,937
- This is on the house.
- Why?

850
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:13,273
It just is, bitch.

851
01:03:04,303 --> 01:03:05,497
Patrn!

852
01:03:14,715 --> 01:03:17,183
Dude, fix your fucking face.

853
01:04:09,377 --> 01:04:12,006
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

854
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:13,172
Idea.

855
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:15,182
Let's start over.

856
01:04:16,518 --> 01:04:20,114
How 'bout if you help me?
Unless l'm horning in here.

857
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,282
Oh, you are,
but the food is good.

858
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:25,954
See, l've got this little problem.
l've got a stalker.

859
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:30,698
Doesn't sound life-threatening.
I need a cover.

860
01:04:30,802 --> 01:04:34,033
I need for you to pretend that we're
having a scintillating conversation...

861
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:37,575
and you are wildly entertained.

862
01:04:37,676 --> 01:04:40,510
I know it's tough.
l'll improvise.

863
01:04:40,613 --> 01:04:42,274
I don't talk like that.

864
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:47,047
She's right across the room.
She's burning a hole in my back now.

865
01:04:50,824 --> 01:04:53,589
Red dress, strappy shoes.

866
01:04:56,631 --> 01:04:58,030
That's right.

867
01:04:59,969 --> 01:05:02,870
I think she is the saddest girl...

868
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:05,099
to ever hold a martini.

869
01:05:18,055 --> 01:05:19,955
- Are you okay?
- No.

870
01:05:21,193 --> 01:05:23,252
Why? What's wrong?
Is it me?

871
01:05:24,396 --> 01:05:26,762
- Is it me?
- l'll tell you later.

872
01:05:26,865 --> 01:05:29,801
- l'll tell you later.
- Something's wrong. Tell me now.

873
01:05:29,903 --> 01:05:31,768
Talk about it all right now.

874
01:05:31,871 --> 01:05:34,466
- Talk about it. Get it all out.
- l'll tell you later!

875
01:05:34,575 --> 01:05:36,600
Say everything now.

876
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:40,305
Just say everything now.
Now! Now! Now!

877
01:05:40,414 --> 01:05:43,407
l'll tell you in another life,
when we are both cats.

878
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,727
I can't believe
you just said that.

879
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:57,892
That is the greatest thing
that l've ever heard.

880
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:00,492
That's hilarious
that you said that.

881
01:06:01,605 --> 01:06:05,269
See, that... You said that.

882
01:06:05,376 --> 01:06:08,038
That is what I love about you.

883
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:11,516
That's hilarious.

884
01:06:11,617 --> 01:06:15,053
l'll tell you in another life,
when we are both cats.

885
01:06:16,322 --> 01:06:17,517
Cats!

886
01:06:17,624 --> 01:06:19,023
Cats!

887
01:06:24,465 --> 01:06:26,456
Well, this is where I leave you.

888
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:28,467
l'll walk you to your door.

889
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:31,095
- I live just around the corner.
- l've got my bike here.

890
01:06:31,206 --> 01:06:33,299
- l'd rather walk.
- Don't be a drag.

891
01:06:33,408 --> 01:06:35,968
Can't you see
she wants to go on her own?

892
01:06:36,078 --> 01:06:37,979
Shut up. You're drunk.

893
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:42,415
I may be an idiot,
but l'm not drunk.

894
01:06:42,518 --> 01:06:45,420
Seriously, I don't need you
to walk me home.

895
01:06:45,522 --> 01:06:47,547
Thank you.

896
01:06:47,658 --> 01:06:51,253
Okay, then.
So we'll call you.

897
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:55,197
We'll go catch a movie
or something.

898
01:06:56,568 --> 01:06:58,468
So we'll meet up soon.

899
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:03,641
We'll meet up soon.

900
01:07:13,354 --> 01:07:16,118
We'll call you again
to go out with me!

901
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:18,922
We'll call you.

902
01:07:20,195 --> 01:07:21,753
It's been a real blast.

903
01:07:21,864 --> 01:07:23,957
I bid you good evening.

904
01:07:24,066 --> 01:07:26,057
Wait, wait.
Where are you going?

905
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:29,297
My bike... it's back over there.
We'll hang soon.

906
01:07:29,406 --> 01:07:32,341
And bring your mask if you want.
l'm getting used to it.

907
01:07:34,278 --> 01:07:35,506
Wait a minute.

908
01:07:35,613 --> 01:07:37,103
What?

909
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:41,482
I don't know.

910
01:07:41,586 --> 01:07:44,020
You drank a little too much.
Call me tomorrow if you want.

911
01:07:44,122 --> 01:07:46,613
Tomorrow l'll wish I was dead.

912
01:07:49,762 --> 01:07:51,753
No, you won't.
You just need to sleep.

913
01:07:57,838 --> 01:07:59,533
What?

914
01:08:03,978 --> 01:08:08,142
What did you say to Julie Gianni
the night of the accident?

915
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:10,476
What?

916
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:15,019
You told her
she was a fuck buddy.

917
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:16,523
Never.

918
01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:21,193
She was a little more
than pissed about it.

919
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:24,700
Have you been harboring
this shit all along?

920
01:08:24,802 --> 01:08:26,702
I never talked to her.

921
01:08:31,143 --> 01:08:32,542
Whatever.

922
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,843
Anyway...

923
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:40,147
who am I if I can't be the one
to tell you you're not ugly?

924
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:43,082
Come on.

925
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:46,057
Give me a courtesy laugh.

926
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,061
Oh, Brian, l'm so fucked up.

927
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:51,324
l'm just so fucked up.

928
01:08:53,435 --> 01:08:55,596
Hey, Brian, come on.

929
01:08:58,507 --> 01:09:00,408
We're best friends!

930
01:09:01,544 --> 01:09:02,841
We're bros!

931
01:09:03,846 --> 01:09:06,042
Come on, man, we're bros.

932
01:10:46,864 --> 01:10:48,388
Open your eyes.

933
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,365
This is a cheap ploy
for sympathy.

934
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:01,009
l'm okay. l'm okay.

935
01:11:01,114 --> 01:11:03,446
And it worked. Get up.

936
01:11:04,717 --> 01:11:06,185
I agree.

937
01:11:08,989 --> 01:11:11,253
This is a joke.

938
01:11:11,358 --> 01:11:13,953
l'm not gonna lie to you.

939
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:15,723
I liked the way you looked.

940
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,631
But...

941
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,725
you have to pull it
the fuck together.

942
01:11:21,604 --> 01:11:24,698
Because if not,
l'll forget the other guy.

943
01:11:24,807 --> 01:11:28,369
You know that other guy?
You.

944
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,180
l'm still that guy.
l'm still that guy.

945
01:11:32,282 --> 01:11:35,377
I don't have a mother-savior
bone in my body.

946
01:11:35,486 --> 01:11:38,944
It's not about that.
You are coming inside.

947
01:11:39,057 --> 01:11:41,720
But if this turns out
to be a big mistake...

948
01:11:42,895 --> 01:11:46,558
I do have the ability
to fall out of love with you...

949
01:11:46,665 --> 01:11:47,757
like that.

950
01:11:58,212 --> 01:12:00,112
We created
our own world together.

951
01:12:00,214 --> 01:12:01,841
- I am still that guy.
- Shut up.

952
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:03,884
Us versus them.

953
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,954
- Where's Brian?
- Brian?

954
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:09,023
He went with you, didn't he?

955
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:11,355
I thought you guys hooked up.

956
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:16,089
I wish you hadn't gotten
in the car with that girl.

957
01:12:18,636 --> 01:12:20,763
Sofia, l...

958
01:12:23,975 --> 01:12:26,535
Your eyes apologize better.

959
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:29,779
Come on.

960
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:34,044
Holy God, this is going
to change my life...

961
01:12:34,153 --> 01:12:37,054
in a zillion different ways.

962
01:12:37,156 --> 01:12:39,148
I must be nuts.

963
01:12:39,259 --> 01:12:41,159
And we were quite a pair.

964
01:12:41,261 --> 01:12:44,389
Her believing in me,
me believing that...

965
01:12:44,498 --> 01:12:46,990
l actually deserved it.

966
01:13:05,288 --> 01:13:08,019
I see you haven't
been wasting your time.

967
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:11,356
Do you ever draw
anything else?

968
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,495
Did you sleep last night?

969
01:13:18,804 --> 01:13:21,000
No, I did not sleep.

970
01:13:21,107 --> 01:13:23,974
Got to leave early today,
so you'll have to be brief.

971
01:13:24,077 --> 01:13:27,104
Now, what can you tell me...

972
01:13:27,214 --> 01:13:29,580
about the name "Ellie"?

973
01:13:32,052 --> 01:13:33,849
Ellie.

974
01:13:33,954 --> 01:13:36,719
Is that a girl you knew,
a girl you were in love with?

975
01:13:36,825 --> 01:13:39,020
l've only been in love once.

976
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:42,154
Apparently, you kept
repeating it last night.

977
01:13:42,264 --> 01:13:46,257
You did sleep, David.
Your advisor said you cried out.

978
01:13:46,368 --> 01:13:48,837
- You had a nightmare.
- Everything's a nightmare.

979
01:13:48,939 --> 01:13:53,399
You cried out for Ellie, David.
Do you remember what happened?

980
01:14:00,118 --> 01:14:01,813
Dig deep, David.

981
01:14:01,919 --> 01:14:03,751
Dig deep.

982
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:07,019
You cried out for Ellie.
What do you remember about Ellie?

983
01:14:09,729 --> 01:14:11,754
Show me your face, David.

984
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,602
Help me open the door.

985
01:14:26,148 --> 01:14:30,107
It's true you had an accident.
It's true you were disfigured.

986
01:14:30,218 --> 01:14:32,653
But not anymore.

987
01:14:32,755 --> 01:14:34,655
Do you remember?

988
01:14:36,726 --> 01:14:38,627
They did fix your face.

989
01:14:41,165 --> 01:14:43,963
Take off that mask, David.

990
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:46,502
You'll see your face
is perfect under there.

991
01:14:47,772 --> 01:14:49,831
I never trusted the doctors.

992
01:14:52,111 --> 01:14:55,239
What happened next was surreal.

993
01:14:56,382 --> 01:14:59,614
That same arrogant bastard,
Dr. Pomeranz, called me.

994
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:02,187
Suddenly he was
my new best friend.

995
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,814
David! Hey, my brother.

996
01:15:04,925 --> 01:15:07,292
I felt really bad
about our last conversation.

997
01:15:07,395 --> 01:15:10,694
He said he'd discovered a new form
of reconstructive surgery...

998
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:13,267
with the help of a doctor
from Berlin.

999
01:15:13,368 --> 01:15:14,596
Hello.

1000
01:15:14,703 --> 01:15:18,298
Next thing I knew, they shot me
full of drugs l'd never heard of...

1001
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:20,968
and away we went.

1002
01:15:21,077 --> 01:15:25,104
What if God was one of us

1003
01:15:26,749 --> 01:15:30,618
Just a slob like one of us

1004
01:15:30,721 --> 01:15:33,849
Trying to make his way home

1005
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:36,484
He's got a good voice.

1006
01:15:36,595 --> 01:15:37,789
Fifty-five.

1007
01:15:37,896 --> 01:15:40,160
The odds, they said,
were one in three...

1008
01:15:40,265 --> 01:15:42,632
that the headaches
could be reduced by 50%...

1009
01:15:42,735 --> 01:15:45,169
and facial tissue
could be regenerated.

1010
01:15:45,271 --> 01:15:49,800
The first to incorporate the concept
of endoscopic periorbital fiber optics.

1011
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:51,537
Where are we gonna eat later?

1012
01:15:51,645 --> 01:15:53,636
I can't even tell you
what they did.

1013
01:15:53,747 --> 01:15:55,978
It seemed like
science fiction to me.

1014
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,984
Madonna had that song,
"Borderline".

1015
01:15:58,086 --> 01:16:00,179
- That was a hell of a song.
- And another snip.

1016
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:03,588
This is gonna be one
good-looking guy when l'm done.

1017
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:06,024
Obviously, I was suspicious.

1018
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,595
Wouldn't you be?

1019
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:12,327
Suspicious of whom, of what?

1020
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:13,493
Doc...

1021
01:16:13,603 --> 01:16:17,267
once you've been driven
off a bridge at 80 miles an hour...

1022
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:21,436
somehow you don't invite happiness in
without a full body search.

1023
01:16:25,717 --> 01:16:28,049
At the risk of boring you...

1024
01:16:28,153 --> 01:16:30,554
I can present
the alternate argument.

1025
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:34,119
I once knew a guy...

1026
01:16:34,227 --> 01:16:36,127
who was a real loner.

1027
01:16:37,263 --> 01:16:39,323
One day he woke up at 40...

1028
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:42,300
with two daughters that
lit up his life with purpose...

1029
01:16:42,403 --> 01:16:45,396
and he suddenly goes
to endless school plays...

1030
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:48,135
and he gets home at 9:20
for the evening discussion...

1031
01:16:48,243 --> 01:16:52,510
and he has the time of his life.

1032
01:16:52,615 --> 01:16:56,210
His favorite Beatle was once John,
and now it's Paul.

1033
01:16:59,189 --> 01:17:01,487
I always liked George.

1034
01:17:02,926 --> 01:17:06,192
It all depends on
the individual, doesn't it?

1035
01:17:06,297 --> 01:17:08,390
Tell me,
what's happiness for you?

1036
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:10,660
What's happiness to you, David?

1037
01:17:12,136 --> 01:17:14,867
- How 'bout another question?
- You won't show me your face.

1038
01:17:14,974 --> 01:17:16,771
Will you?

1039
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:20,607
So back to the time line.

1040
01:17:20,714 --> 01:17:22,875
Hurry. Let's move through this.

1041
01:17:28,222 --> 01:17:29,621
What?

1042
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:32,892
You've got to take
the plates off.

1043
01:17:32,994 --> 01:17:35,327
I don't want to know
what's under here.

1044
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:37,398
It's gonna be fine.
You'll see.

1045
01:17:37,499 --> 01:17:38,932
- l'll go tomorrow.
- Today.

1046
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:41,299
I already called Pomeranz
and switched it to Wednesday.

1047
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:47,667
What?

1048
01:17:50,114 --> 01:17:53,015
I hope that woman at the front desk
gave you shit about it.

1049
01:17:55,186 --> 01:17:58,781
Another day won't matter.
Besides, the Mustang will be fixed.

1050
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:02,121
The plan was going in the Mustang.
The Mustang's not ready.

1051
01:18:02,228 --> 01:18:04,025
So we'll go tomorrow
in the Mustang.

1052
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,428
- Good.
- We'll go when it's fixed.

1053
01:18:06,532 --> 01:18:08,625
I know that the problem...

1054
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:12,728
wouldn't be you delaying
something you were dreading.

1055
01:18:14,741 --> 01:18:16,903
Couldn't be that.

1056
01:18:17,011 --> 01:18:18,911
Couldn't be that.

1057
01:18:21,082 --> 01:18:23,243
I mean...

1058
01:18:31,828 --> 01:18:34,729
I mean, I agree.

1059
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,231
I think it's very important...

1060
01:18:39,336 --> 01:18:40,735
to have...

1061
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:45,241
the right car...

1062
01:18:52,618 --> 01:18:54,586
to take you...

1063
01:18:56,622 --> 01:18:58,682
where you want to go...

1064
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:06,129
24 hours a day.

1065
01:19:31,629 --> 01:19:33,529
How bad is it?

1066
01:19:36,935 --> 01:19:40,427
Well, your ears
are in the right place.

1067
01:19:43,009 --> 01:19:45,637
And the rest of it...

1068
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,272
is not too bad at all.

1069
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,524
It's perfect.

1070
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:50,681
Do you love me?

1071
01:20:50,786 --> 01:20:52,948
I mean, really love me?

1072
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:55,752
Because if you don't...

1073
01:20:55,858 --> 01:20:58,019
l'll just have to kill you.

1074
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,666
You see, my next life?

1075
01:21:03,767 --> 01:21:05,496
In my next life...

1076
01:21:05,604 --> 01:21:08,038
l'm gonna come back
as this mole right here.

1077
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:12,237
Seriously, this mole.

1078
01:21:12,344 --> 01:21:15,439
You'll have to wear bikini tops
to work and loose-fitting shirts...

1079
01:21:15,548 --> 01:21:18,039
so that I can breathe.

1080
01:21:19,151 --> 01:21:20,847
I love you.

1081
01:21:20,954 --> 01:21:22,353
Love you.

1082
01:21:24,658 --> 01:21:26,057
I love you.

1083
01:21:27,428 --> 01:21:30,261
I can live right there.

1084
01:21:35,237 --> 01:21:37,137
Is this a dream?

1085
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,639
Absolutely.

1086
01:21:50,788 --> 01:21:53,916
We talked about the big things,
the little things...

1087
01:21:54,025 --> 01:21:55,926
and the big things.

1088
01:21:57,029 --> 01:21:59,463
But in truth, with Sofia...

1089
01:21:59,564 --> 01:22:02,329
it was the in-between times.

1090
01:22:25,227 --> 01:22:26,694
What did she say?

1091
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:29,197
I have no idea.

1092
01:22:32,903 --> 01:22:34,837
- How's things, Brian?
- Fine.

1093
01:22:36,907 --> 01:22:39,308
- How's things?
- Don't flatter yourself.

1094
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:40,968
l'm fine.

1095
01:22:41,079 --> 01:22:44,344
Besides, Sofia is great
but by no means one of a kind.

1096
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:46,350
She was a proximity infatuation.

1097
01:22:48,887 --> 01:22:51,880
And don't use that. It's mine.
Thanks.

1098
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:54,993
Where'd you get this camera?

1099
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:58,326
l'm into things.
You have no idea, my friend.

1100
01:22:59,867 --> 01:23:02,028
Just as long as you're okay.

1101
01:23:02,136 --> 01:23:04,297
And anyway,
we're friends, aren't we?

1102
01:23:04,405 --> 01:23:06,499
- Always.
- That's right.

1103
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:20,155
What's up with your face?

1104
01:23:22,025 --> 01:23:23,549
- Fuck!
- What?

1105
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,491
There's a seam opening!

1106
01:23:31,436 --> 01:23:34,531
- David Aames.
- You fucking asshole.

1107
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:37,205
I know.

1108
01:24:57,767 --> 01:24:59,668
Was I snoring?

1109
01:25:03,374 --> 01:25:05,502
I think it was me.

1110
01:25:05,611 --> 01:25:07,511
I was thirsty, that's all.

1111
01:25:10,616 --> 01:25:12,608
l'm dreaming about you.

1112
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:32,283
I could listen to you say "mmm"...

1113
01:26:32,388 --> 01:26:34,549
for the rest of my life.

1114
01:26:47,005 --> 01:26:48,996
Baby, what's wrong?

1115
01:26:54,346 --> 01:26:56,712
Where is she?

1116
01:26:56,816 --> 01:26:57,874
Who?

1117
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:04,018
Who?

1118
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:31,686
l'm Sofia.

1119
01:27:36,528 --> 01:27:39,895
Now, l'm gonna make sure
that I tie it four times.

1120
01:27:39,998 --> 01:27:41,899
You know why, Julie?

1121
01:27:42,001 --> 01:27:44,868
Because four times
really means something.

1122
01:27:44,971 --> 01:27:47,303
David, don't hurt me.

1123
01:27:47,406 --> 01:27:50,069
l'm freaked out.
It worked.

1124
01:27:50,177 --> 01:27:52,202
You know you're not
gonna get away with this...

1125
01:27:52,312 --> 01:27:53,939
so tell me now,
where is Sofia.

1126
01:27:55,048 --> 01:27:56,778
I am Sofia.

1127
01:27:57,785 --> 01:27:59,412
- Where's Sofia?
- I am Sofia!

1128
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,920
- Where is she?
- I am Sofia!

1129
01:28:02,023 --> 01:28:04,492
l'm calling the police,
and you can tell it to them.

1130
01:28:04,593 --> 01:28:06,857
- You survived the accident.
- What accident?

1131
01:28:06,962 --> 01:28:10,399
Whose body was it?
It was the Seven Dwarfs.

1132
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,230
- I wasn't in an accident.
- You're trying to steal my life!

1133
01:28:13,336 --> 01:28:15,463
Of course you weren't
in an accident.

1134
01:28:15,572 --> 01:28:18,098
Now it's fucking attempted murder!

1135
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:20,677
l'm Sofia. Please.

1136
01:28:21,812 --> 01:28:24,543
Tell it to them.

1137
01:28:24,650 --> 01:28:26,880
This is David Aames.

1138
01:28:26,985 --> 01:28:28,384
I need help.

1139
01:28:28,487 --> 01:28:30,853
I have an intruder...
l've captured an intruder...

1140
01:28:30,956 --> 01:28:32,447
who's entered my home.

1141
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:35,459
God. Wake up, man.

1142
01:28:38,265 --> 01:28:39,527
Are you for real?

1143
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:52,004
Kept me waiting here for three hours.
They won't even tell me any news.

1144
01:28:52,113 --> 01:28:54,446
These guys think that I had
something to do with this.

1145
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:56,518
Give us a minute here, yeah?

1146
01:28:56,619 --> 01:29:00,351
Detective Larson, Detective Andrews,
thanks very much.

1147
01:29:02,693 --> 01:29:04,684
They think that I had
something to do with this.

1148
01:29:04,795 --> 01:29:07,697
l'm gonna handle this exactly
the way your father would.

1149
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,333
l've got it solved.

1150
01:29:11,135 --> 01:29:13,194
You got it solved?

1151
01:29:13,304 --> 01:29:15,068
Where is she?

1152
01:29:16,175 --> 01:29:19,975
She's gonna be fine.
Now, this whole file is gonna...

1153
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,678
Thank God you're here, man.

1154
01:29:25,785 --> 01:29:27,343
It's okay.

1155
01:29:28,322 --> 01:29:31,223
- I love her.
- Yeah.

1156
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:34,887
Right now I want you to look at these
photos, then l'm gonna destroy them.

1157
01:29:34,997 --> 01:29:37,557
Sofia's testimony
is also in here.

1158
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:40,294
It won't exist.

1159
01:29:40,402 --> 01:29:42,837
She's not gonna press charges.

1160
01:29:45,274 --> 01:29:47,435
Press charges against me?

1161
01:29:47,543 --> 01:29:50,012
David, wake up.

1162
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:54,750
Now, as a friend...

1163
01:29:56,287 --> 01:29:58,881
I think you should see
what you did to Sofia.

1164
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:02,895
The press won't get hold of this
if you get away quickly.

1165
01:30:02,895 --> 01:30:05,022
The press won't get hold of this
if you get away quickly.

1166
01:30:07,633 --> 01:30:10,432
Tommy, this is Julie.
This is not Sofia.

1167
01:30:11,671 --> 01:30:14,139
This is Julie Gianni.

1168
01:30:15,142 --> 01:30:18,112
I didn't do this to her.
Tommy, someone's setting me up.

1169
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:22,273
David, the board and I
have taken care of everything.

1170
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:26,218
Okay, they've been really great,
really great, actually.

1171
01:30:26,321 --> 01:30:28,551
All this is gonna disappear.

1172
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:32,789
We're all behind you,
even the board.

1173
01:30:45,109 --> 01:30:47,135
Get out of here.

1174
01:30:50,816 --> 01:30:53,149
This is a revolution
of the mind.

1175
01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:04,188
You're in fuckin' sad shape!

1176
01:31:05,299 --> 01:31:07,200
Don't fucking ever hit a girl.

1177
01:31:07,302 --> 01:31:10,271
Hit me, but don't fucking ever
hit a girl!

1178
01:31:10,371 --> 01:31:12,271
Listen to me.
It wasn't Sofia.

1179
01:31:12,373 --> 01:31:14,808
It was Julie.

1180
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:17,936
- It was Julie.
- It was Julie Gianni.

1181
01:31:18,047 --> 01:31:19,981
Yes.

1182
01:31:20,082 --> 01:31:23,450
So Sofia was abducted by Julie...

1183
01:31:23,553 --> 01:31:26,454
and now Julie is posing
as Sofia.

1184
01:31:29,293 --> 01:31:32,353
You're in O.J. land, man.

1185
01:31:32,463 --> 01:31:34,659
Julie Gianni is fucking dead!

1186
01:31:34,766 --> 01:31:39,203
I don't care what they told you,
I can assure you Julie Gianni is alive.

1187
01:31:39,304 --> 01:31:41,499
- She is alive.
- I didn't talk to them.

1188
01:31:41,607 --> 01:31:43,803
I talked to Sofia.

1189
01:31:45,512 --> 01:31:47,571
- Where is she?
- I just dropped Sofia off.

1190
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,478
I saw everything you did to her.

1191
01:31:49,583 --> 01:31:52,643
Let me tell you something.
I did not do that to her.

1192
01:31:53,754 --> 01:31:56,588
Look at me.
Look me in the eye.

1193
01:31:56,691 --> 01:31:58,921
You tell me that's the girl
you brought to the party.

1194
01:31:59,027 --> 01:32:01,996
You tell me that
that's your dream girl...

1195
01:32:02,097 --> 01:32:04,328
your proximity infatuation.

1196
01:32:04,433 --> 01:32:06,162
Yes!

1197
01:32:06,269 --> 01:32:08,328
And you stole her from me.

1198
01:32:08,437 --> 01:32:11,703
The one girl I really wanted,
and you took her from me.

1199
01:32:11,808 --> 01:32:15,335
You're insane.
You're losin' it, man.

1200
01:32:15,445 --> 01:32:19,280
- You have revealed yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

1201
01:32:19,384 --> 01:32:21,284
l'm with them.

1202
01:32:26,725 --> 01:32:28,955
Where'd you get the coat, Brian?

1203
01:32:30,062 --> 01:32:32,293
Where'd you get the camera?

1204
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:34,526
How much did they pay you?

1205
01:32:35,569 --> 01:32:38,903
Listen to me, 'cause this is
the last time we're ever gonna speak.

1206
01:32:40,007 --> 01:32:41,702
I was your only friend.

1207
01:32:41,809 --> 01:32:44,471
You have revealed yourself to me.

1208
01:33:07,706 --> 01:33:09,105
Problems?

1209
01:33:10,609 --> 01:33:13,545
l'm in no mood to be fucked with,
so do yourself a favor...

1210
01:33:13,646 --> 01:33:16,774
There's an explanation
for all this, David.

1211
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:22,082
You and I know each other.
You found me on the Internet.

1212
01:33:23,523 --> 01:33:25,582
l'm here to help you, David.

1213
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:31,665
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me?

1214
01:33:31,766 --> 01:33:35,897
First of all, it's very important
that you calm down.

1215
01:33:37,373 --> 01:33:38,772
Calm down?

1216
01:33:40,409 --> 01:33:41,775
Calm down.

1217
01:33:41,878 --> 01:33:44,312
You must overcome your fears
and regain control.

1218
01:33:44,414 --> 01:33:46,814
Take a hold of your life again,
David.

1219
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:48,817
It's as easy
as holding that glass.

1220
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,048
What if I were to tell you
that you can take control...

1221
01:33:53,157 --> 01:33:55,216
of all of this, everything?

1222
01:33:55,326 --> 01:33:56,726
Even me.

1223
01:33:58,363 --> 01:34:00,422
Look, l'm straight. Okay?

1224
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:06,470
David, look at all these people.

1225
01:34:07,573 --> 01:34:10,008
Seems as though they're just
all chatting away, doesn't it?

1226
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:11,168
Yeah.

1227
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:13,439
- Nothing to do with you.
- No.

1228
01:34:13,547 --> 01:34:15,071
And yet...

1229
01:34:15,182 --> 01:34:18,914
maybe they're only here because
you wanted them to be here.

1230
01:34:20,055 --> 01:34:21,352
You are their god.

1231
01:34:21,456 --> 01:34:25,917
Not only that, but you can make them
obey you or even destroy you.

1232
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:31,194
Well, what l'd love for them to do
is shut the fuck up.

1233
01:34:31,301 --> 01:34:32,859
Especially you.

1234
01:34:44,882 --> 01:34:46,874
You see?

1235
01:34:58,998 --> 01:35:01,797
You and I
signed a contract, David.

1236
01:35:01,902 --> 01:35:05,838
Who is the man in the restaurant?
Who is it?

1237
01:35:06,808 --> 01:35:08,400
I can't...

1238
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:10,478
Can you tell the difference
between dreams and reality?

1239
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:13,173
- Of course. Can you?
- Think about it.

1240
01:35:13,983 --> 01:35:16,008
Think with your head.

1241
01:35:16,285 --> 01:35:18,082
You signed a contract...

1242
01:35:18,354 --> 01:35:19,753
did you not?

1243
01:35:21,658 --> 01:35:23,148
I signed something.

1244
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:25,160
Was the man
in the restaurant there?

1245
01:35:27,097 --> 01:35:30,499
- Fuck...
- Accept your body's resistance.

1246
01:35:30,602 --> 01:35:32,900
Let your head answer.

1247
01:35:34,005 --> 01:35:35,667
Sign the contract, David.

1248
01:35:35,775 --> 01:35:37,174
- Yes.
- That's right.

1249
01:35:37,877 --> 01:35:38,866
Who is Ellie?

1250
01:35:42,115 --> 01:35:44,845
- I don't know what's real.
- What happened that night?

1251
01:35:44,951 --> 01:35:48,409
- Somebody died.
- I don't want to remember.

1252
01:35:48,522 --> 01:35:50,548
You hold the keys
to this prison.

1253
01:35:51,492 --> 01:35:53,392
- It wasn't Sofia.
- Who was it?

1254
01:35:54,195 --> 01:35:55,127
- No.
- Who was it?

1255
01:35:59,168 --> 01:36:01,398
l'm afraid of
how powerful this is.

1256
01:36:02,872 --> 01:36:05,397
You wanna let it out,
don't you, David?

1257
01:36:08,511 --> 01:36:10,241
You're about to tell me.

1258
01:36:11,515 --> 01:36:13,449
Tell me...

1259
01:36:13,551 --> 01:36:17,386
what your heart and soul
will not allow you to forget.

1260
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:22,058
Did you kill Sofia?

1261
01:37:13,853 --> 01:37:15,980
I thought you were a vandal.

1262
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:20,521
Who are you?

1263
01:37:24,532 --> 01:37:25,999
l'm Sofia.

1264
01:37:28,203 --> 01:37:30,103
You are not...

1265
01:37:30,205 --> 01:37:31,467
Sofia.

1266
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:39,345
l'm Sofia.

1267
01:37:39,448 --> 01:37:40,915
Whatever.

1268
01:37:41,017 --> 01:37:43,646
We're gonna be together again.

1269
01:37:43,754 --> 01:37:47,622
You're gonna forget about Juliana
and we're gonna be together.

1270
01:37:47,724 --> 01:37:49,556
l'm not gonna be afraid
of you anymore.

1271
01:37:50,828 --> 01:37:54,059
l'm gonna get you a cold towel.
l'll be right back.

1272
01:37:55,033 --> 01:37:56,433
I love you.

1273
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:17,815
Pleasure delayer.

1274
01:38:26,636 --> 01:38:27,694
Sofia?

1275
01:38:47,126 --> 01:38:48,525
I am Sofia.

1276
01:38:55,202 --> 01:38:56,601
I love you.

1277
01:38:58,005 --> 01:39:00,133
Oh, I missed you so much.

1278
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:11,217
Where were you?

1279
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:18,688
Forget it.

1280
01:39:18,795 --> 01:39:20,696
I don't need to know.

1281
01:39:21,799 --> 01:39:23,699
It doesn't matter.

1282
01:39:25,503 --> 01:39:27,563
Just tell me that you love me.

1283
01:39:33,278 --> 01:39:34,439
I love you.

1284
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:39,848
What is happiness to you, David?

1285
01:39:40,953 --> 01:39:42,114
For me...

1286
01:39:42,222 --> 01:39:44,383
it's being here with you.

1287
01:39:50,632 --> 01:39:52,657
What the fuck...

1288
01:39:52,767 --> 01:39:55,065
is happening?

1289
01:39:57,807 --> 01:39:59,934
What is fucking happening?

1290
01:40:00,042 --> 01:40:02,841
David was a real delight
as a child.

1291
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:07,642
Oh, God!

1292
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:11,051
l'm so afraid
of how powerful this is!

1293
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,554
Oh, David!

1294
01:40:44,659 --> 01:40:47,527
That is the greatest thing
l've ever heard.

1295
01:40:49,499 --> 01:40:52,025
In another life
when we are both cats.

1296
01:40:58,542 --> 01:40:59,703
What's happening?

1297
01:41:02,247 --> 01:41:04,215
Hey, man, what's happening?

1298
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:10,479
You bitch!

1299
01:41:12,558 --> 01:41:15,653
I don't wanna see your face!

1300
01:42:24,241 --> 01:42:26,141
I did it, didn't I?

1301
01:42:28,745 --> 01:42:31,647
But I don't feel
like I killed someone.

1302
01:42:34,952 --> 01:42:36,681
- David...
- I feel like...

1303
01:42:36,787 --> 01:42:39,484
- who was the man...
- l'm in a dream.

1304
01:42:39,591 --> 01:42:41,491
at the restaurant?

1305
01:42:59,781 --> 01:43:01,510
Sometimes...

1306
01:43:01,616 --> 01:43:03,880
the mind behaves
as if it were in a dream.

1307
01:43:03,985 --> 01:43:07,046
Faces change.
People become other people.

1308
01:43:09,158 --> 01:43:11,718
The subconscious
is a powerful thing.

1309
01:43:13,964 --> 01:43:16,364
You treated Julie carelessly,
didn't you?

1310
01:43:26,511 --> 01:43:30,414
Your feelings of responsibility
or guilt over Julie...

1311
01:43:30,516 --> 01:43:32,916
might have easily
turned Sofia into Julie.

1312
01:43:36,222 --> 01:43:38,122
Do you know what derangement is?

1313
01:43:39,025 --> 01:43:41,392
I need your help.

1314
01:43:42,697 --> 01:43:45,530
All I know is,
you killed your girlfriend...

1315
01:43:45,633 --> 01:43:48,467
and I don't know
what's in your mind.

1316
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:50,060
I need your help.

1317
01:43:50,172 --> 01:43:54,233
I would work on this case forever
if I could, but we're out of time.

1318
01:43:59,515 --> 01:44:00,914
What will you plead?

1319
01:44:05,089 --> 01:44:06,488
Temporary derangement.

1320
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:10,324
That's your best chance.

1321
01:44:11,997 --> 01:44:14,488
I don't think they'll believe me.

1322
01:44:15,567 --> 01:44:17,331
What do you believe?

1323
01:44:19,305 --> 01:44:21,705
Believe it or not,
I care about you.

1324
01:44:26,446 --> 01:44:29,040
You've become like family to me.

1325
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:36,723
I don't want to give up on you,
David, but I needed more.

1326
01:44:36,824 --> 01:44:38,622
I needed...

1327
01:44:38,727 --> 01:44:40,854
I needed an answer.

1328
01:44:40,963 --> 01:44:44,091
I mean, I even thought there was
more than a good chance...

1329
01:44:44,199 --> 01:44:46,100
somebody was playing
a trick on you.

1330
01:44:46,202 --> 01:44:48,500
Maybe it was the board.

1331
01:44:48,605 --> 01:44:51,335
But I can't exceed my duties.

1332
01:44:56,347 --> 01:44:58,247
l'm just a psychologist.

1333
01:45:00,786 --> 01:45:03,152
And I have to go now.

1334
01:45:06,692 --> 01:45:09,354
Will I see you at the trial?

1335
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:12,029
No, l'm...

1336
01:45:13,167 --> 01:45:15,067
l'm just the opening act.

1337
01:45:34,023 --> 01:45:38,427
Reassurance is our specialty.
That is the Life Extension credo.

1338
01:45:47,071 --> 01:45:50,098
Benny is a dog who was frozen
for three months...

1339
01:45:50,209 --> 01:45:52,336
and thawed out
to live a normal life.

1340
01:45:52,444 --> 01:45:56,108
Life Extension can translate
to the human form too.

1341
01:45:57,317 --> 01:45:59,649
How do you accomplish
such a thing?

1342
01:45:59,752 --> 01:46:02,881
Seventy-two cryonized patients...

1343
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:06,323
are currently held at our facility
in New Brunswick.

1344
01:46:06,427 --> 01:46:10,865
And we feature the finest scientific
technicians on the planet.

1345
01:46:14,603 --> 01:46:16,161
McCabe!

1346
01:46:20,910 --> 01:46:22,810
Come back!

1347
01:46:59,655 --> 01:47:01,646
Life Extension Corporation,
please.

1348
01:47:01,757 --> 01:47:03,748
- Can I help you?
- LE.

1349
01:47:03,859 --> 01:47:05,759
We hold a court order.

1350
01:47:08,198 --> 01:47:10,098
I think l've been here before.

1351
01:47:23,415 --> 01:47:24,882
Her name is Libby.

1352
01:47:24,983 --> 01:47:26,541
Good morning, Mr. McCabe.

1353
01:47:27,386 --> 01:47:29,786
l'm Libby.
l'm here to assist you.

1354
01:47:31,457 --> 01:47:34,359
He's my son.
He's very shy.

1355
01:47:34,461 --> 01:47:38,830
You're not with the media or a part
of any legal consortium, correct?

1356
01:47:38,932 --> 01:47:40,365
No.

1357
01:47:40,968 --> 01:47:42,834
Welcome to Life Extension.

1358
01:47:42,937 --> 01:47:45,838
Take a look at our proposal.
Please follow me.

1359
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:47,840
You can wait out here.

1360
01:47:48,944 --> 01:47:51,174
You'll be meeting
Rebecca Dearborn...

1361
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:53,339
my personal role model.

1362
01:47:55,385 --> 01:47:58,286
I didn 't need the pain anymore.
I already experienced that.

1363
01:47:58,388 --> 01:48:01,846
They want you to lay down and die.
Life Extension wants you to live.

1364
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:07,793
I don't think that God
disapproves of this.

1365
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:11,460
"Cryonization:
a journey of reawakening...

1366
01:48:11,570 --> 01:48:13,936
after the preservation of the human
body at extremely low temperatures."

1367
01:48:14,039 --> 01:48:16,634
They laughed at Jules Verne too.

1368
01:48:16,743 --> 01:48:18,267
You are not...

1369
01:48:18,378 --> 01:48:21,279
Mr. McCabe, how are you?
l'm Rebecca Dearborn.

1370
01:48:24,418 --> 01:48:28,787
Life Extension,
or LE as we like to refer to it...

1371
01:48:28,889 --> 01:48:30,379
is a glimpse of the future.

1372
01:48:31,059 --> 01:48:32,287
It's a ticket.

1373
01:48:32,394 --> 01:48:36,228
Not in the juvenile sense, but
in the deeply meaningful sense...

1374
01:48:36,331 --> 01:48:38,562
that can only be born
in the human heart.

1375
01:48:41,737 --> 01:48:44,467
The DNA codes of the human body
have been broken.

1376
01:48:44,573 --> 01:48:47,008
Soon, heart ailments, cancer...

1377
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:49,169
so much more
will be a thing ofthe past.

1378
01:48:49,946 --> 01:48:53,314
Very simply,
your anguish, your discontent...

1379
01:48:53,418 --> 01:48:56,012
even your death
is no longer necessary...

1380
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:57,849
in a traditional sense.

1381
01:48:57,955 --> 01:49:02,256
Whatever malady hides behind
that mask, it's temporary.

1382
01:49:03,529 --> 01:49:05,429
Within an hour of your passing...

1383
01:49:05,531 --> 01:49:08,626
LE will transfer your body
to a vessel...

1384
01:49:08,735 --> 01:49:13,332
where you will be sealed and frozen
at 196 degrees below zero.

1385
01:49:13,441 --> 01:49:15,375
Power outtages, earthquakes...

1386
01:49:15,476 --> 01:49:17,967
nothing will affect
your suspension hibernation.

1387
01:49:18,079 --> 01:49:21,106
Did you sign a contract
with these people, David?

1388
01:49:24,453 --> 01:49:26,785
What's the Lucid Dream option?

1389
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:29,415
Good choice.

1390
01:49:29,525 --> 01:49:32,892
The Lucid Dream
is Life Extension's newest option.

1391
01:49:32,995 --> 01:49:34,725
For a little extra...

1392
01:49:34,832 --> 01:49:38,063
we offer the cryonic union...

1393
01:49:38,168 --> 01:49:40,966
of science and entertainment.

1394
01:49:42,006 --> 01:49:43,871
"Cryo-tainment."

1395
01:49:47,912 --> 01:49:49,972
Some find this presentation
helpful.

1396
01:49:55,989 --> 01:50:00,824
I have a universe

1397
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:03,328
Inside me

1398
01:50:03,431 --> 01:50:06,093
Portrait of a modern human life.

1399
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,634
American, male...

1400
01:50:08,736 --> 01:50:11,604
birth and death.

1401
01:50:11,707 --> 01:50:15,074
Imagine that you are suffering
from a terminal illness.

1402
01:50:15,177 --> 01:50:18,579
You'd like to be cryonized,
but you'd rather be resurrected...

1403
01:50:18,681 --> 01:50:21,912
to continue your own life
as you knowit now.

1404
01:50:22,018 --> 01:50:24,715
LE offers you the answer.

1405
01:50:25,389 --> 01:50:26,913
Upon resurrection...

1406
01:50:27,024 --> 01:50:29,584
you will continue
in an ageless state...

1407
01:50:29,693 --> 01:50:32,686
preserved
but living in the present...

1408
01:50:32,798 --> 01:50:34,857
with a future
of your choosing.

1409
01:50:35,634 --> 01:50:38,536
Your death will be wiped
from your memory.

1410
01:50:38,638 --> 01:50:41,539
Your life will continue as
a realistic work of art...

1411
01:50:41,641 --> 01:50:43,973
painted by you,
minute to minute...

1412
01:50:44,076 --> 01:50:47,877
and you'll live it with the
romantic abandon of a summer day...

1413
01:50:47,981 --> 01:50:50,643
with the feeling
of a great movie...

1414
01:50:50,751 --> 01:50:53,152
or a pop song you always loved...

1415
01:50:53,254 --> 01:50:55,085
with no memory
of how it all occurred...

1416
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:57,055
save for the knowledge...

1417
01:50:57,158 --> 01:51:01,255
that everything simply improved.

1418
01:51:01,363 --> 01:51:03,263
In any instance
of discontent...

1419
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:06,096
you'll be visited
by technical support.

1420
01:51:06,203 --> 01:51:07,966
It's all just around the corner.

1421
01:51:08,071 --> 01:51:13,476
The day after tomorrow,
another chapter begins seamlessly.

1422
01:51:13,578 --> 01:51:15,478
A living dream.

1423
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,071
Life Extension's promise to you.

1424
01:51:18,182 --> 01:51:20,083
Life, part two.

1425
01:51:20,185 --> 01:51:21,948
A living dream.

1426
01:51:24,823 --> 01:51:28,316
"Your death will be
wiped from your memory".

1427
01:51:28,428 --> 01:51:30,453
I guess I missed that one
in USA Today.

1428
01:51:30,563 --> 01:51:31,621
A dream.

1429
01:51:34,435 --> 01:51:37,370
What if there was a mistake?

1430
01:51:37,471 --> 01:51:40,497
What if the dream
became a nightmare?

1431
01:51:41,776 --> 01:51:45,337
Of course your subconscious
can always play tricks on you.

1432
01:51:47,015 --> 01:51:50,008
The subconscious
is a very powerful thing.

1433
01:51:54,056 --> 01:51:56,719
Did you sign a contract
with these people, David?

1434
01:51:56,827 --> 01:51:59,227
But this is a serious business.

1435
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:04,332
The Lucid Dream
is worth the risk.

1436
01:52:05,336 --> 01:52:08,066
And what is any life
if not the pursuit of a dream?

1437
01:52:09,173 --> 01:52:10,641
The dream of peace...

1438
01:52:10,743 --> 01:52:13,303
the dream of achievement...

1439
01:52:14,947 --> 01:52:18,145
the dream of hearing someone
say these words...

1440
01:52:18,251 --> 01:52:20,549
when they really,
truly mean them.

1441
01:52:23,624 --> 01:52:25,649
I love you, David.

1442
01:52:29,363 --> 01:52:30,193
I love you.

1443
01:52:34,102 --> 01:52:35,933
Roam free, David.

1444
01:52:36,038 --> 01:52:38,803
Most of us
live our whole lives...

1445
01:52:38,908 --> 01:52:42,105
without any real adventure
to call our own.

1446
01:52:42,211 --> 01:52:45,045
It's hard to comprehend.

1447
01:52:45,149 --> 01:52:47,913
But they laughed
at Jules Verne too.

1448
01:52:50,454 --> 01:52:51,752
This...

1449
01:52:51,856 --> 01:52:53,255
is a revolution...

1450
01:52:53,358 --> 01:52:54,916
of the mind.

1451
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:17,545
I wanna wake up!

1452
01:53:18,586 --> 01:53:20,077
Tech support!

1453
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:22,218
Hey! Face!

1454
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:26,650
It's a nightmare!

1455
01:53:43,215 --> 01:53:46,343
Tech support!

1456
01:54:01,468 --> 01:54:05,530
Tech support!

1457
01:54:41,214 --> 01:54:42,647
David Aames.

1458
01:54:43,983 --> 01:54:46,384
I think it's time we had
a proper reintroduction.

1459
01:54:46,487 --> 01:54:49,650
l'm Edmund Ventura
from the Oasis Project.

1460
01:54:49,757 --> 01:54:52,090
Formerly Life Extension, LE.

1461
01:54:52,194 --> 01:54:54,219
- Tech support.
- Yes.

1462
01:54:54,329 --> 01:54:56,229
Yes, l'm your tech support...

1463
01:54:56,331 --> 01:54:59,733
and we first met
150 years ago.

1464
01:54:59,836 --> 01:55:02,168
Oh, shit.

1465
01:55:02,271 --> 01:55:04,364
You sold me the Lucid Dream.

1466
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:08,239
What the hell happened?

1467
01:55:08,345 --> 01:55:10,677
I tried to warn you in the bar.

1468
01:55:10,781 --> 01:55:14,912
I told you you must exercise control,
that it all depended on your mind.

1469
01:55:15,587 --> 01:55:17,077
All of this...

1470
01:55:17,188 --> 01:55:19,383
everything is your creation.

1471
01:55:19,491 --> 01:55:22,393
And now we're heading toward
your true moment of choice.

1472
01:55:23,429 --> 01:55:25,124
True moment of choice?

1473
01:55:25,231 --> 01:55:26,289
Yes.

1474
01:55:31,471 --> 01:55:33,462
When did the Lucid Dream begin?

1475
01:55:33,573 --> 01:55:35,474
Remember the day
of the night club?

1476
01:55:35,576 --> 01:55:36,941
We'll meet up soon.

1477
01:55:38,813 --> 01:55:42,341
That night, after Sofia left you and
you fell asleep on the pavement...

1478
01:55:42,451 --> 01:55:45,716
that was the moment
that you chose for the splice.

1479
01:55:45,821 --> 01:55:48,620
- Splice?
- Splice.

1480
01:55:48,725 --> 01:55:52,320
The end of your real life and
the beginning of LE's Lucid Dream.

1481
01:55:52,428 --> 01:55:55,330
A splice of many, many years
which passed...

1482
01:55:55,432 --> 01:55:57,764
while you were frozen
and dreaming.

1483
01:55:57,868 --> 01:56:00,098
From the moment
you woke up on that street...

1484
01:56:00,204 --> 01:56:02,400
nothing was real
in the traditional sense.

1485
01:56:02,507 --> 01:56:03,940
Open your eyes.

1486
01:56:04,042 --> 01:56:06,943
Your Lucid Dream
is monitored by Life Extension...

1487
01:56:07,045 --> 01:56:10,243
and a panel of experts who are
following your every thought...

1488
01:56:10,349 --> 01:56:12,317
even at this moment.

1489
01:56:14,453 --> 01:56:16,479
Forgive me.
l'm blowing your mind.

1490
01:56:20,527 --> 01:56:22,461
l'm not a big fan of heights.

1491
01:56:23,932 --> 01:56:25,422
I know.

1492
01:56:25,533 --> 01:56:27,831
We erased what really happened
from your memory.

1493
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:31,339
- Erased?
- Replaced.

1494
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:32,998
By a better life...

1495
01:56:33,108 --> 01:56:34,769
under these...

1496
01:56:34,877 --> 01:56:37,438
beautiful, Monet-like skies.

1497
01:56:38,782 --> 01:56:40,181
My mother's favorite.

1498
01:56:41,117 --> 01:56:44,610
A better life
because you had Sofia.

1499
01:56:44,722 --> 01:56:48,954
You sculpted your Lucid Dream out
of the iconography of your youth.

1500
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:51,621
An album cover
that once moved you.

1501
01:56:52,364 --> 01:56:53,456
An album cover?

1502
01:56:53,565 --> 01:56:54,827
There are some things...

1503
01:56:54,933 --> 01:56:57,834
that you're not old enough
to understand just yet.

1504
01:56:57,936 --> 01:57:02,203
A movie you saw once that showed you
what a father could be like...

1505
01:57:12,821 --> 01:57:15,221
or what love could be like.

1506
01:57:15,323 --> 01:57:16,847
This was a kind woman...

1507
01:57:16,958 --> 01:57:19,688
an individual...

1508
01:57:19,795 --> 01:57:22,025
more than your equal.

1509
01:57:22,131 --> 01:57:26,158
You barely knew her in real life,
but in your Lucid Dream...

1510
01:57:26,269 --> 01:57:28,170
she was your savior.

1511
01:57:32,643 --> 01:57:35,772
What happened in my real life?
Something happened.

1512
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:37,279
What did you erase?

1513
01:57:37,382 --> 01:57:38,974
Do you really want to know?

1514
01:57:41,453 --> 01:57:43,011
Tell me everything.

1515
01:57:44,223 --> 01:57:47,124
The morning after the night club,
you woke up on that street...

1516
01:57:47,226 --> 01:57:49,024
hung over and alone.

1517
01:57:49,129 --> 01:57:50,756
You got up, walked away.

1518
01:57:51,998 --> 01:57:54,558
You never saw Sofia again.

1519
01:58:00,641 --> 01:58:02,633
I didn't kill Sofia.

1520
01:58:06,148 --> 01:58:07,416
You battled your board
for control of the company...

1521
01:58:07,416 --> 01:58:09,647
You battled your board
for control of the company...

1522
01:58:11,187 --> 01:58:14,054
and in the end it was Thomas Tipp,
your father's friend...

1523
01:58:14,157 --> 01:58:15,886
the man whose job you saved...

1524
01:58:15,992 --> 01:58:18,826
who wrenched the company
back into your control.

1525
01:58:19,930 --> 01:58:21,329
Tommy.

1526
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:24,300
But then...

1527
01:58:25,537 --> 01:58:28,165
somebody died.

1528
01:58:30,443 --> 01:58:32,911
You longed for Sofia.

1529
01:58:33,012 --> 01:58:35,173
You shut yourself away for months.

1530
01:58:35,281 --> 01:58:36,839
You were alone.

1531
01:58:36,949 --> 01:58:40,511
You couldn't stand
the pain anymore, the headaches.

1532
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:42,144
You could barely function.

1533
01:58:43,190 --> 01:58:45,352
I found you on the Internet.

1534
01:58:49,197 --> 01:58:51,792
I signed a contract with you,
and then...

1535
01:59:13,225 --> 01:59:14,624
I remember.

1536
01:59:24,303 --> 01:59:26,203
Somebody died.

1537
01:59:27,941 --> 01:59:29,465
It was me.

1538
01:59:36,651 --> 01:59:39,814
And on a day in late December...

1539
01:59:39,921 --> 01:59:41,913
you gave yourself to us.

1540
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:46,928
You're now in a suspended state.

1541
01:59:51,134 --> 01:59:55,595
Your friend Brian Shelby threw a
three-day memorial in your old home.

1542
01:59:55,706 --> 01:59:57,606
He was a true friend.

1543
02:00:07,152 --> 02:00:09,212
You were missed, David.

1544
02:00:31,614 --> 02:00:34,174
It was Sofia
who never fully recovered.

1545
02:00:36,419 --> 02:00:39,321
It was she who somehow
knew you best...

1546
02:00:40,424 --> 02:00:43,325
and like you, she never
forgot that one night...

1547
02:00:43,427 --> 02:00:46,329
where true love seemed possible.

1548
02:00:55,074 --> 02:00:56,974
Consequences, David.

1549
02:01:14,029 --> 02:01:15,929
It's the little things.

1550
02:01:20,370 --> 02:01:22,270
The little things.

1551
02:01:23,806 --> 02:01:26,206
There's nothing bigger,
is there?

1552
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:38,521
Your subconscious
did create problems.

1553
02:01:39,958 --> 02:01:42,189
Your dream
turned into a nightmare.

1554
02:01:43,362 --> 02:01:46,024
The glitch has been corrected.

1555
02:01:47,366 --> 02:01:49,995
So all I have to do
is imagine something.

1556
02:01:50,103 --> 02:01:52,003
Like, if I wanted...

1557
02:01:52,105 --> 02:01:54,096
McCabe to come back right now...

1558
02:01:58,112 --> 02:01:59,909
Listen to me.

1559
02:02:00,014 --> 02:02:01,709
These people are dangerous.

1560
02:02:02,985 --> 02:02:06,421
We're in trouble.
We need to get off this roof now.

1561
02:02:09,893 --> 02:02:11,793
We're now on pause...

1562
02:02:11,895 --> 02:02:14,386
and you're about to return
to your Lucid Dream.

1563
02:02:14,497 --> 02:02:16,329
With all the upgrades...

1564
02:02:16,434 --> 02:02:18,334
you won't remember any of this...

1565
02:02:18,436 --> 02:02:21,200
nor will you be charged
for technical support.

1566
02:02:21,305 --> 02:02:23,831
It's now your moment of choice.

1567
02:02:24,943 --> 02:02:28,435
You can return to your Lucid Dream
and live a beautiful life...

1568
02:02:28,547 --> 02:02:32,382
with Sofia or whomever you wish...

1569
02:02:32,485 --> 02:02:35,784
or you can choose
the world out there.

1570
02:02:37,891 --> 02:02:39,791
"The world out there".

1571
02:02:41,328 --> 02:02:43,228
And you can bring me back...

1572
02:02:43,330 --> 02:02:45,390
just like Benny the dog?

1573
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:46,558
Yes.

1574
02:02:46,668 --> 02:02:50,035
Just like Benny the dog.

1575
02:02:51,006 --> 02:02:53,601
Your face and body
can be fixed now, of course.

1576
02:02:54,677 --> 02:02:58,078
But things
are very different now...

1577
02:02:58,180 --> 02:03:00,411
and your finances
won't last long.

1578
02:03:01,785 --> 02:03:05,016
Your panel of observers
are waiting for you to choose.

1579
02:03:09,861 --> 02:03:11,761
There are no guarantees...

1580
02:03:11,863 --> 02:03:13,161
but remember...

1581
02:03:13,265 --> 02:03:15,290
even in the future...

1582
02:03:15,401 --> 02:03:18,336
the sweet is never as sweet...

1583
02:03:18,437 --> 02:03:20,838
without the sour.

1584
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:40,284
How do I wake up?

1585
02:03:40,897 --> 02:03:42,797
The decision is yours.

1586
02:03:47,738 --> 02:03:50,434
And I chose this scenario,
didn't I?

1587
02:03:51,975 --> 02:03:56,936
Yes, to face your last
remaining fear of heights.

1588
02:03:57,048 --> 02:03:58,982
David, don't listen to him.

1589
02:03:59,084 --> 02:04:01,986
You were right. This is
the seven dwarfs. It's a setup!

1590
02:04:02,088 --> 02:04:04,522
You can't trust him.

1591
02:04:04,623 --> 02:04:08,719
Don't feel bad for him, David.
This winning man is your creation.

1592
02:04:08,828 --> 02:04:12,731
It's in his nature to fight for
his existence, but he's not real.

1593
02:04:12,833 --> 02:04:14,232
l'm real.

1594
02:04:17,105 --> 02:04:18,333
l'm real.

1595
02:04:19,173 --> 02:04:21,164
I have two daughters...

1596
02:04:21,275 --> 02:04:22,799
and you know that.

1597
02:04:23,912 --> 02:04:25,504
What are their names?

1598
02:04:40,297 --> 02:04:41,696
I'm real.

1599
02:04:46,905 --> 02:04:49,965
I'm mortality
as home entertainment?

1600
02:04:50,075 --> 02:04:51,976
This cannot be the future!

1601
02:04:54,447 --> 02:04:55,505
Can it?

1602
02:04:57,617 --> 02:04:58,778
Can it?

1603
02:05:27,418 --> 02:05:29,147
Good-bye.

1604
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:35,456
It's been a brilliant journey
of self-awakening.

1605
02:05:35,561 --> 02:05:38,928
And now you've simply got to
ask yourself this...

1606
02:05:39,031 --> 02:05:41,626
What is happiness to you, David?

1607
02:05:48,576 --> 02:05:50,976
I want to live a real life.

1608
02:05:52,146 --> 02:05:54,512
I don't want to dream any longer.

1609
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:57,643
Any last wishes?

1610
02:06:00,255 --> 02:06:02,656
Let them out there
read my mind.

1611
02:06:04,427 --> 02:06:06,327
I wish you well, David.

1612
02:06:46,642 --> 02:06:48,940
Look at us.

1613
02:06:49,044 --> 02:06:50,944
l'm frozen, and you're dead.

1614
02:06:52,148 --> 02:06:53,672
And I love you.

1615
02:06:55,685 --> 02:06:57,084
It's a problem.

1616
02:07:01,025 --> 02:07:03,425
I lost you
when I got in that car.

1617
02:07:04,528 --> 02:07:06,053
l'm sorry.

1618
02:07:08,333 --> 02:07:11,325
Do you remember
what you told me once?

1619
02:07:12,170 --> 02:07:14,332
That every passing minute...

1620
02:07:15,575 --> 02:07:18,476
is another chance
to turn it all around.

1621
02:07:23,917 --> 02:07:25,817
l'll find you again.

1622
02:07:42,539 --> 02:07:45,133
l'll see you in another life...

1623
02:07:45,241 --> 02:07:47,471
when we are both cats.

1624
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:01,594
Relax, David.

1625
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:02,993
Open your eyes.
