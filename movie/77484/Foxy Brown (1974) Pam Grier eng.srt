1
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,743
What'll it be?

2
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:16,262
Hey, buddy, you wanna order somethin'?

3
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:27,432
Hey, man, you wanna order somethin'?

4
00:04:27,564 --> 00:04:30,019
Yeah. Give me a taco.

5
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,399
How you doin'?

6
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:39,280
- Anything to drink?
- Coffee.

7
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:43,490
Coffee and a taco.

8
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:52,211
- Yes, sir?
- Make mine the same.

9
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:57,503
Say, you got a payphone here?

10
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:59,672
Yeah, right over there.

11
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,271
Hello.

12
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,025
Foxy? It's Link.

13
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,901
Now, just listen. I gotta talk fast.
I'm in big trouble.

14
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,038
If you're dealing in dope again,
forget it because I'll...

15
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:38,206
Never mind that. Two big motherfuckers
are waitin' to beat the livin' shit out of me

16
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,578
as soon as these two cops finish lunch.

17
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:43,798
I'm at a taco stand,
corner of Brewster and Church Street.

18
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:45,964
So hurry up!

19
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,883
Foxy, for Christ's sake, I'm your brother.
You gotta help me. Please!

20
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:55,515
All right. All right.
When I see you I'll blink my lights, OK?

21
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:58,015
All right.

22
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,579
- More coffee?
- No, not me, thanks.

23
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:25,788
Hey, this is good coffee.
This is wonderful coffee.

24
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:28,792
Best goddamn coffee I ever tasted.

25
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:30,963
I'll have some more.

26
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:34,216
How about you?

27
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:46,476
Check.

28
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:50,734
Hey, officers, you're not gonna leave
without finishing your coffee?

29
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:53,186
All that nice, good coffee?

30
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:59,273
That stuff's expensive.
You shouldn't waste it like that.

31
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,738
Say, you know where I can find
an all-night men's room?

32
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,276
Argh!

33
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,570
Hey!

34
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:45,735
Agh!

35
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:50,739
Oh, shit! Get off!

36
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:54,373
Get off the goddamn front.
I can't see where I'm goin'. Shit!

37
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:01,788
All right, I'll get the son of a bitch off.

38
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,760
Get me off! Get me off of here!

39
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:12,466
For God's sake, stop!
You're gonna kill us all!

40
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:14,852
Whoa!

41
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,981
Somebody help me! Help!

42
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:23,525
Phew! Jesus!

43
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:27,603
You saved my beautiful black ass.
You really did.

44
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,736
Mm-hm.

45
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:33,575
And you better have a mighty good reason
why those hoods were after it, too.

46
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:40,951
Well, practically nothin'.
A lousy two or three days.

47
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,704
Come on, Link. You're not talking to
one of your jive-ass friends.

48
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,330
I'm your sister. Give it to me straight.

49
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:49,507
I am. Now, listen.

50
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:57,847
I had to borrow a few bucks
to go into business.

51
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:02,601
From a loan shark, right?

52
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:06,895
The Bank of America ain't started
givin' out mortgages on numbers banks.

53
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:09,233
OK, OK. So what happened?

54
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:12,945
What do you think the odds are
against 500 people hitting the number

55
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:15,908
on Martin Luther King's birthday?

56
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:20,530
- So how much did you go down for?
- A lousy 20 grand or so.

57
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:27,413
But I woulda had it all back if they'd just
give me a lousy two or three more days.

58
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:29,289
Oh, Link!

59
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:32,922
After all you've been through.
When are you gonna learn?

60
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:35,506
Look, it's a legitimate business.

61
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:38,296
Well, almost.

62
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:43,388
But it's better than bein' a paid informer
like that big-shot boyfriend of yours.

63
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,061
And where is he now?

64
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:49,765
Probably at the bottom of the river
polluting it in a bucket of cement.

65
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,939
Shut up about him, Link!

66
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:56,275
OK.

67
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:02,190
But I was doin' fine before, dealin' coke.

68
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:05,032
And then you came down on me for that.

69
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:08,871
Oh, all right.

70
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:15,789
I guess you're gonna have to stay here
until I can think of what to do.

71
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:20,418
Thanks, baby. And them people
don't know nothin' about you at all.

72
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,170
And that's another thing.
As long as you're under this roof

73
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:28,599
you gotta promise me to stay away
from them people and outta the rackets.

74
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,300
Foxy, look, I'm a black man.

75
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:34,189
I don't know how to sing,
I don't know how to dance,

76
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:36,473
or how to preach to no congregation.

77
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm too small to be a football hero
and I'm too ugly to be elected mayor.

78
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:47,487
But I watch TV and I see all them people
in all them fine homes they live in

79
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:50,453
and all them nice cars they drive,

80
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,450
and I get all full of ambition.

81
00:10:56,002 --> 00:11:00,378
Now, you tell me what I'm supposed to do
with all this ambition I got.

82
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:02,874
I don't know, Link.

83
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:08,167
I just don't wanna see you end up in jail
or shot down in the street somewhere.

84
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:15,434
Baby, jail is where some of the finest
people I know are these days.

85
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:23,229
A car came out of nowhere.

86
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,439
Now, what kind of a bullshit story is that?
What car? Who was it?

87
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:32,280
How should I know? You sent us to take
care of one little punk black-ass dealer.

88
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,865
You said nothin' about his havin' friends.

89
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:38,613
Eddie, junk dealers don't have friends.

90
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:42,117
- Did you at least get a look at him?
- It was pretty dark.

91
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:46,664
- But, I tell ya, it looked like a broad to me.
- A broad?

92
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:49,205
What do you suppose
these two were smokin'?

93
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:53,090
You know I don't drink
or smoke or nothin', Mr Elias.

94
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:55,047
Eddie!

95
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:59,180
Yes, Miss Katherine.

96
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:13,524
Of course,
things don't always go smoothly.

97
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,906
Especially when one becomes careless.

98
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:23,490
I'm sure he won't be so careless again.

99
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:26,994
No, Miss Katherine. I sure won't.

100
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:29,997
This man has cost us a lot of money.

101
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,247
D'you know what happens when
we let these people get away with it?

102
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:38,594
- Yeah, they'll do it again!
- No, stupid.

103
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,962
No, what she means is
the word gets out all over town

104
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,967
and then nothing we say means shit!

105
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,472
Huh?

106
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:55,189
He won't get away with it,
Miss Katherine. I promise.

107
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:57,854
Good.

108
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:00,229
You may go now.

109
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:10,910
Sometimes you have to talk tough
to these people to get 'em to listen to you.

110
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:14,541
Yes. You're right, Steve.

111
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,835
Kiss me.

112
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:28,270
Yeah...

113
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:40,244
Hey, what are you doing?

114
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:43,746
What does it feel like I'm doing?

115
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:48,122
Feels like you're doin' just what
you're doin', but I can't handle it this way.

116
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:53,296
I mean, a little taste of honey ain't enough
for me. I gotta have the whole beehive.

117
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,383
Oh, you're gonna get it, baby,

118
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:58,845
just as soon as you get the wraps
off that Christmas package.

119
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:02,886
Well, I got something to tell you.
That's gonna be today.

120
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:06,680
Hm.

121
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,645
That gives me a funny feeling.

122
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,982
I mean...

123
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:15,601
I don't know what you look like any more.

124
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,029
Maybe I won't want to.

125
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:22,733
It'll be like doin' it with a stranger.

126
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,404
Yeah? Well, the part that counts
is still just the same.

127
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,664
I noticed!

128
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,464
It really has been a long time, hasn't it?

129
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:40,501
- Listen, Foxy.
- Hm?

130
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:42,925
I'll tell you what.

131
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:45,426
Let's just pull this curtain closed.

132
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,188
- Like this?
- Yeah.

133
00:15:51,313 --> 00:15:53,352
Both of them.

134
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:58,601
- I don't think we're supposed to do this.
- No, it's all right.

135
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:00,775
Now, come on up here...

136
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:03,778
...like this.

137
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:08,448
Yeah.

138
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,532
- A little more this way.
- Like this?

139
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:25,425
Oh, now, really, Mr Anderson!
You know perfectly well that's a no-no.

140
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:30,430
- Time for your bath, Mr Anderson.
- Oh, shit.

141
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,435
Now, Mr Anderson,
we'll have none of that nonsense.

142
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,025
Ooh!

143
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:52,152
Clean o' body, clean o' mind.

144
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,324
Then a body Jesus'll find.

145
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:02,040
Easy, now.

146
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:05,792
Just let me cut this one here.

147
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:10,460
There's that one.

148
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:12,218
Just one more here.

149
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:14,800
There we are. That's it.

150
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:27,267
There.

151
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:35,989
So that's it, huh?

152
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,034
It's a good job, Doc.
His own mother wouldn't recognise him.

153
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:43,202
I like it.

154
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,744
Well, there's the expert's opinion.
What man wouldn't be satisfied with that?

155
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,916
- It won't fall apart if I laugh, will it?
- No.

156
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:58,424
- Just no fistfights for a few months.
- No way. My fighting days are over.

157
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:01,969
- I've got other plans from now on.
- Yes, so I noticed.

158
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:04,138
Something to look forward to.

159
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:09,427
It's all right if I get out of here for a while,
isn't it? I really need some new scenery.

160
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:11,390
It's up to your boss.

161
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:17,027
Just so long as you're back tonight. I can't
check you out officially until tomorrow.

162
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:22,199
I guess he's gotta try it out
on the street sometime.

163
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:27,283
Well, you all have some things to talk
about. I'll see you tomorrow, Michael.

164
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:41,792
I guess this is the time
that you'll be needing these things, Mike.

165
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:44,678
There's a birth certificate.

166
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:51,174
Driver's licence, credit cards, social
security numbers, a lot of other things.

167
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:53,137
And...

168
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:58,478
You might not wanna keep this,
but I'd like you to read it.

169
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:00,648
It's from the boss.

170
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:07,740
From the director of
the Bureau of Narcotics.

171
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:12,407
He thanks me on behalf of
the US Government for all I've done.

172
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:19,330
For all I've done.

173
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:20,871
Nothing!

174
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,876
Two years undercover. The best case
put together against a dope syndicate,

175
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:30,551
and we couldn't even get an indictment
because the fix was in on the grand jury.

176
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,140
Only way to handle those hoods is with a
bullet in the gut, like they tried to get him.

177
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:38,967
I know how you feel.
It's hard not to agree with you, but...

178
00:19:40,105 --> 00:19:44,316
Anyway, you're out of it now.
There is no more Dalton Ford.

179
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:48,570
From now on
you're officially Michael Anderson.

180
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:55,367
It's a pleasure to walk among people
and not have to worry about anybody.

181
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,067
Oscar? What are you doing?

182
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:01,075
Sh. Wait a second. Just watch.

183
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:14,841
Wait a second. Watch this.

184
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:36,021
My baby!

185
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:42,324
That's my baby!

186
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,091
Agh!

187
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:07,234
OK, get that asshole outta here.

188
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:11,944
Whoo!

189
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:14,532
Foxy, baby. What's happenin', mama?

190
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:19,822
Oscar. That wasn't exactly smooth, but
he had no business pickin' on a cripple.

191
00:22:20,668 --> 00:22:25,329
That was one of them no-good niggers.
Been tryin' to catch him for a long time.

192
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:26,662
Mm-hm.

193
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,336
Oscar, I want you
to meet my friend Michael.

194
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:33,085
- You a friend of Foxy's, you all right.
- I'm glad to know that, man.

195
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:36,590
- He's with the neighbourhood committee.
- Yeah, what kind?

196
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:39,096
- The anti-slavery committee.
- Slavery?

197
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:43,140
Yeah, we're in the process of abolishing
what we call "new slavery".

198
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:47,020
- That's the slavery of hard dope. You dig?
- I sure do.

199
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:50,934
These pushers, they buy protection
from the police and from the man.

200
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:55,234
But from us there is no protection.
None whatsoever. You dig?

201
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:58,569
Right on, brother.
But what happens to the pusher?

202
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:05,123
He's gonna go on a very long train ride.
To some other town, that is.

203
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:08,332
What if he comes back?

204
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,085
He won't come back. No way indeed.

205
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:13,923
Dynamite.

206
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:17,004
Well, Oscar, we gotta run.
We'll check you later, OK?

207
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:19,971
Foxy's a good chick.
You treat her right, you hear?

208
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:23,347
The last fella she had
ran out on her at a bad time.

209
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:25,302
Later.

210
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:32,023
- Maybe he's got the right idea.
- Sure do.

211
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,521
But I don't know. Vigilante justice?

212
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:37,487
It's as American as apple pie.

213
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:39,440
Yeah.

214
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,743
Hello, Deb?

215
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,033
For Christ's sake, baby,
I've been trying to call you all day.

216
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:53,993
Yeah, I'm OK.
I'm at my sister's pad across the river.

217
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:56,168
Nobody here knows me.

218
00:23:56,506 --> 00:23:59,292
They were looking for you,
and weren't nice about it.

219
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:02,924
What? Jesus Christ.
Baby, did they hurt you?

220
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:08,640
Oh, no, not too bad. I guess they knew
I really didn't know where you were.

221
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:14,551
Damn. It wasn't my fault the narcs found
that stash and picked up that half key.

222
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:18,057
All I need is another half or so
for a few days and I can pay it off.

223
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:20,101
I told them that, like you said.

224
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,195
There's gotta be another way
to raise 20 grand.

225
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:27,612
Deb, I gotta call you back later, OK?

226
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:34,529
Say, Foxy.
I didn't expect you back so early.

227
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:35,863
Mm-hm.

228
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,534
Mike, this is my brother Link.
He'll be visiting me for a while.

229
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,501
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Mm-hm. Hi, how you doin'?

230
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,547
- Mike, is it?
- Yeah. Anderson.

231
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:56,054
Say, I was just goin' out
for a breath of fresh air and a walk.

232
00:24:56,936 --> 00:24:58,975
Good idea.

233
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:06,061
- Maybe get better acquainted next time.
- Yeah, maybe next time. See ya.

234
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:09,195
And stay out of trouble,
if you know what I mean.

235
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:25,663
For a moment
it seemed like he noticed something.

236
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:30,753
He's like that. He always has
his feelers out, like a cockroach.

237
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:21,092
- What time is it?
- It's pretty late.

238
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:24,091
I'm due back at the hospital
for a final checkup.

239
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:27,177
Mm. Come here. I'll give you a checkup.

240
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,183
You look pretty good to me.

241
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:31,351
I'd love to, but...

242
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:34,896
Tomorrow and all the tomorrows
after that.

243
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:41,402
- You got much stuff to pack?
- Mm-mm. I'm practically ready.

244
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:44,153
Been practising with that,
like I showed you?

245
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:48,363
Plenty, and I'm pretty good with it, too.

246
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:50,239
Good.

247
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:52,412
I hope you never have to use it.

248
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,267
What are you doin' in my things?

249
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,438
You remember this?

250
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,189
It don't hardly seem like
it was only three months ago.

251
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:27,693
Yeah. I'm trying to forget about it, Link.

252
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:30,906
Dalton Ford.

253
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:35,321
That name could be worth 20 grand, easy.

254
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:37,080
What are you talkin' about?

255
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:41,668
Well, the people I know,
when they want somebody that bad,

256
00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:44,250
they get him for sure.

257
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:49,708
I bet somebody made a bundle
fingering that informer.

258
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:53,343
He was not an informer.
He was a federal cop.

259
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,678
Oh, sure, you're right.

260
00:27:55,808 --> 00:28:00,220
Trouble is them people don't know
the difference sometimes.

261
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:06,972
Well, Link, I'm going on a little vacation.
You can have the place to yourself.

262
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,941
- Think you can get along all right?
- Baby, I'll be all right.

263
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:17,151
- You gonna need any help?
- No, no, uh-uh. You better stay inside.

264
00:28:17,286 --> 00:28:20,072
And I'll be back
to pick up the bags in an hour.

265
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:24,118
And you better start thinkin' about
what you're gonna do, OK?

266
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,212
For Mexican heroin, it's pretty good stuff.
About 80.

267
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,546
I've seen better, but not lately.

268
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:23,502
- Good work, Leroy. Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr Elias. Call on me anytime.

269
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:28,714
Mr Tedesco, you have yourself a deal.
Tell your people the terms are acceptable.

270
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,520
You get $10,000 upfront,
the rest on delivery.

271
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:34,218
Now, how soon can you arrange this?

272
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,558
- I would say about five days.
-

273
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:41,192
Super. I'll have my boy
fly it in the usual way.

274
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,069
Mr Elias, Miss Katherine
wants to see you right away.

275
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:48,532
- It's urgent, she says.
- All right, Eddie.

276
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:53,073
Everything goes all right, I see no reason
why we can't do business together.

277
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:56,456
I am sure you'll be
more than satisfied, Mr Elias.

278
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:59,040
Well, I certainly hope so.

279
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,672
Are you trying to tell me
Dalton Ford is still alive?

280
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:13,296
- That's what the man says.
- What man?

281
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:17,597
- That coke dealer who lost that half key.
- Oh, him again.

282
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:21,512
I suppose he wants a clean ticket
in return for fingering him.

283
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:25,860
Steve, I heard the man's story myself.

284
00:30:25,987 --> 00:30:28,026
It has the ring of truth.

285
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:33,200
Eddie, didn't you tell me
you took care of Ford?

286
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:36,327
No, sir. You sent Bunyan, remember?

287
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:38,696
Oh, yes.

288
00:30:38,832 --> 00:30:43,458
I did, honest. I zapped him between
the blades. He fell just like in the movies.

289
00:30:45,254 --> 00:30:48,871
Just... like in the movies?

290
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:53,752
And then he probably got up again, stupid,
just like in the movies!

291
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:56,045
- Jesus!
-  All right.

292
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:02,888
I'm not going to ask what went wrong.

293
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:10,025
All that matters is that that man never
be allowed to open his mouth in court.

294
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:13,816
Last time we were able to reach
some of the grand jurors.

295
00:31:13,947 --> 00:31:16,568
We might not be so lucky again.

296
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,190
I want that man dead.

297
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,154
Eddie.

298
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,157
Now, you do it any way you wanna do it,

299
00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:31,543
but I want that goddamn
nigger cop-fink burned!

300
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:34,127
I don't care
if you have to bring me his head!

301
00:31:34,257 --> 00:31:36,712
I'll make sure this time, Mr Elias.

302
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:40,467
Come on, kid.

303
00:31:42,098 --> 00:31:44,767
Don't go to a movie.

304
00:31:54,484 --> 00:31:57,354
- Is that him?
- I don't know.

305
00:31:58,488 --> 00:32:00,112
He sure looks different.

306
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:03,939
I got a couple of things
to pick up at the drugstore.

307
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:25,596
What do you say
we go take a closer look?

308
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:29,344
OK. Go ahead.

309
00:32:35,438 --> 00:32:37,264
Link?

310
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:41,018
Link!

311
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:09,250
Oh, Link, you didn't.

312
00:33:10,345 --> 00:33:12,384
You couldn't.

313
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:28,860
- I'm sorry, Foxy.
-

314
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:31,228
We tried, didn't we?

315
00:33:31,364 --> 00:33:35,064
Oh, baby, no, no. No.

316
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:44,041
# I'm back in the saddle again

317
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:47,085
# I'm back where a friend needs a fr...

318
00:33:57,138 --> 00:34:00,637
- Who is it?
- It's me, Link. Foxy.

319
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:05,435
Uh, what is it?

320
00:34:05,562 --> 00:34:07,803
I need help, Link. Please let me in.

321
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,771
Baby, I'm really kind of busy right now.

322
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:14,941
Could you come back later?

323
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:19,946
Please, Link. I got Michael out in the car.
He's been shot! You gotta help me.

324
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,986
Just a second.

325
00:34:25,122 --> 00:34:27,161
Stash that, baby.

326
00:34:35,423 --> 00:34:38,874
Move, you son of a bitch!
You had to tell them, didn't you?

327
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:42,591
Look, baby! Look!

328
00:34:51,104 --> 00:34:55,148
- What are you trying to do, kill me?
- I ought to, you rotten bastard!

329
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:58,938
If I don't, thank God you're my brother
cos there's no other reason.

330
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:03,315
Look, baby, let me alone!
I didn't do nothing to you!

331
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:06,237
- Agh!
- You know damn well what you did!

332
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:11,824
I'm not gonna argue with you. Tell me
who you talked to cos it's them or you.

333
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:15,455
I swear, baby,
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

334
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:17,209
Agh!

335
00:35:17,336 --> 00:35:19,292
I only got so much control.

336
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:23,370
I'm liable to put one of these between
your eyes, no matter what Mama'd say.

337
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:28,003
Baby, look...
Look, all I know is what I hear.

338
00:35:28,138 --> 00:35:30,426
I want the name, Link. The name!

339
00:35:30,556 --> 00:35:33,841
All right, all right. Katherine Wall.

340
00:35:34,685 --> 00:35:38,053
But don't you go messin' with her, baby.
She's mean.

341
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:41,722
Katherine Wall? What does she
have to do with the dope operation?

342
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:47,778
Baby, she's the protection. The fixer.
Without her, there's nothin'.

343
00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:50,361
How does she do it?

344
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:54,618
She runs a stable
of the finest call girls in the country.

345
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:58,113
But they don't go out for just money.
You gotta be somebody big.

346
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:03,668
You gotta be a big man - a congressman
or a judge or on the grand jury.

347
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,834
OK, thanks.

348
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,505
What are you doin'?

349
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,675
No, no, no!

350
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:19,599
Hey! Foxy, what's goin' on?
Now, come on. Cut that shit out!

351
00:36:19,726 --> 00:36:23,011
You're movin' out, brother. Out of town.

352
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:25,185
And I mean it, Link.

353
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:33,068
Think you're back with those people, but
they got a stick of dynamite up your ass.

354
00:36:33,197 --> 00:36:35,236
Now, I want you out!

355
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:37,822
O- u-t.

356
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:46,071
- Who does she think she is?
- That's my sister, baby.

357
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:48,035
She's a whole lot of woman.

358
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:55,496
- Miss Cotton. Misty Cotton?
- Yes.

359
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:58,504
- Miss Katherine will see you now. Go in.
- Thank you.

360
00:36:58,637 --> 00:37:02,468
You're welcome, dear,
but I can't stand all this green.

361
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,054
There's too much green in everything.

362
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,743
So, Miss Cotton, is it?

363
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,199
May I call you Misty?

364
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:37,830
It's a lovely name.
I can see you're quite lovely, too.

365
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,587
A unique type.

366
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,668
- Really?
- Yes. Most unusual features.

367
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,422
Almost classic.

368
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,259
Now, Miss Katherine, let's cut all the bull.

369
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:55,888
I know perfectly well the business you're
in. I couldn't care less about modelling.

370
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,225
I've come here for one reason:
This is where the money's at.

371
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,649
I know just how long I have to make it in
and I intend to make it good while I can.

372
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:08,612
So let's you and me stop
wasting each other's precious time.

373
00:38:08,743 --> 00:38:11,909
You tell me who you want done
and I'll do the hell out of him,

374
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:14,076
if the price is right.

375
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:36,472
Vicki?

376
00:38:36,601 --> 00:38:41,760
Set up wardrobe and hairdressing
for Miss Cotton right away, will you?

377
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:49,400
Misty Cotton, eh?

378
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:53,820
All right, Misty. We'll give you a try.

379
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:56,655
If you do well, you can go a long way.

380
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:02,830
But if you fail or try to quit,
you can go a long way, too,

381
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,583
in a different direction.

382
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:07,165
You understand that quite clearly?

383
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:10,793
If you say it, I believe it.

384
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:13,796
Good.

385
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:15,551
Be ready tomorrow.

386
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:20,174
- Four o'clock at my house. Don't be late.
- Thank you, Miss Katherine.

387
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,776
It'll look like an accident.
Your escort will have an emergency.

388
00:39:43,913 --> 00:39:47,530
He will ask the other gentleman
if he can stay and have a drink with you.

389
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:51,877
The important thing is that
it should seem as if you go home with him

390
00:39:52,004 --> 00:39:55,419
because you find him
irresistibly attractive.

391
00:39:59,844 --> 00:40:04,137
The material should cling to the breasts
so the nipples show through.

392
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:08,891
Arabella, I want that fat toad
drooling in his pants over you.

393
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:11,723
Whenever he looks at you, think sex.

394
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:16,018
If you find him repulsive,
think of someone else who turns you on.

395
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:27,149
Why is that dress so tight?
I thought I told you to lose five pounds.

396
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:30,701
- You did?
- Yes. Five pounds.

397
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:37,877
- I'll give you three days to get rid of it.
- Yes, Miss Katherine. I'll do it. I promise.

398
00:40:38,004 --> 00:40:40,755
You have the best hairdressers in the city.

399
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:44,130
You have everything you need
to look your absolute best.

400
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,750
There's no excuse for slovenliness.

401
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:49,383
You, Jennifer.

402
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:53,131
You look like you just woke up
from a three-day drunk.

403
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:58,262
Your face is puffy and your make-up
is too thick trying to cover it up.

404
00:41:02,151 --> 00:41:04,439
Steve...

405
00:41:05,738 --> 00:41:08,442
You're making Miss Cotton nervous.

406
00:41:27,382 --> 00:41:30,299
I'm ready, Miss Katherine.
How do you like it?

407
00:41:31,052 --> 00:41:33,542
It's very impressive.

408
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,550
It's rather late. You'd better get going.

409
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:38,721
Claudia will tell you what to do.

410
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:45,805
The gentlemen you'll be meeting
this evening have a preference for, uh...

411
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:47,767
your type.

412
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:50,107
Oh, I understand, Miss Katherine.

413
00:41:53,573 --> 00:41:56,692
- Bunyan, we're ready for the car now.
- OK, Vicki.

414
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:02,328
Oh, sister. You almost
stepped on the tail of a tiger.

415
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:06,073
- You mean the big chief? Who is he?
- His name is Steve Elias,

416
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:10,870
her very personal private property.
Mustn't touch.

417
00:42:11,005 --> 00:42:14,124
Oh, she's got a weak spot, huh?

418
00:42:14,258 --> 00:42:17,294
True love hits the strangest people,
I guess.

419
00:42:17,428 --> 00:42:19,467
I guess.

420
00:42:24,893 --> 00:42:29,601
Hey, don't worry, baby. Old Claudia's
gonna steer you through this mess.

421
00:42:30,356 --> 00:42:32,763
I'm an old hand at these parties.

422
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,027
Look, all you have to do
is be nice... to certain people.

423
00:42:37,613 --> 00:42:40,530
And tonight I have to be nice
to a certain Judge Fenton,

424
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:45,734
cos two dope dealers that work for Elias
come up for trial in his court tomorrow.

425
00:42:47,414 --> 00:42:52,158
What happens if you're nice to the judge,
but the judge isn't nice to the dealer?

426
00:42:52,293 --> 00:42:56,621
Ah, no, no, no,
cos that would mean I failed.

427
00:42:56,756 --> 00:42:58,795
And that better not happen.

428
00:42:59,466 --> 00:43:01,505
Then what happens?

429
00:43:02,594 --> 00:43:05,298
There's a house in Haiti.

430
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,557
And men go there for...
what they can't get anywhere else.

431
00:43:10,602 --> 00:43:12,641
Mama! Mama! Mama!

432
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:15,477
Jason!

433
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:19,685
Jason! Oh, my baby.

434
00:43:19,818 --> 00:43:22,487
- You shouldn't be here.
- Hello, Claudia.

435
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,940
Willard!

436
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:28,148
What you doin' around here?

437
00:43:28,284 --> 00:43:33,111
I got a new job in Seattle. I wanted him to
see his mama one last time before we go.

438
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:37,825
- You can't just take him away like that.
- You ain't seen him in six months.

439
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,248
- But that ain't my fault.
- Whose is it?

440
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:46,375
There ain't no reason why
you can't up and leave with us now.

441
00:43:46,801 --> 00:43:50,928
Willard, I want to, I really do,
but you don't know these people.

442
00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:53,676
- Once they got you, they don't let you go.
- Eddie.

443
00:43:53,808 --> 00:43:58,386
What world is it if anybody could keep
a woman away from her man and child?

444
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,268
- You're trespassing. It's private property.
- I ain't afraid of you!

445
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:05,814
- I'm talking to my wife.
- We don't want any disturbance.

446
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:10,901
You wanna communicate with that lady,
I suggest you go write her a letter, OK?

447
00:44:20,957 --> 00:44:22,996
Get him up here. I want him!

448
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:29,625
Miss Katherine, I'm sorry.
I didn't know he'd come here, honest.

449
00:44:37,973 --> 00:44:39,632
Now get him out of here!

450
00:44:54,113 --> 00:44:56,568
Feel better already.

451
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:03,695
Drop a couple of downers,
switch on automatic pilot,

452
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:06,581
wait till I reach cruising altitude.

453
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,747
And then what?

454
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:13,167
Maybe a couple more.

455
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:16,048
A martini or so.

456
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:20,551
Maybe then I can be nice
to that pig judge like I'm gonna have to.

457
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,679
Yeah, well, you do what you gotta do.

458
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:30,634
Hey, I've got an idea that might
make it more fun for him and us.

459
00:45:32,523 --> 00:45:34,432
You and me, together.

460
00:45:35,526 --> 00:45:37,352
Dig?

461
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:40,734
Yeah?

462
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,939
Mm-hm.

463
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:47,949
Well, I feel game
for just about anything tonight.

464
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,198
- I'll tell you.
- All right.

465
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,165
Ah, at last. Come on in.

466
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,339
Hiya, Judge.

467
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:07,424
Eddie, get the girls a drink.

468
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:14,679
Wowee. I see Your Honour
likes that dark meat.

469
00:46:14,811 --> 00:46:18,310
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice, honey.

470
00:46:19,566 --> 00:46:21,688
Think you can handle all of that, Fred?

471
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:26,526
Maybe you'll need a little help.
At your age you might have a heart attack.

472
00:46:26,656 --> 00:46:31,946
Awful lot of chocolate for one man. No
wonder you cleared your calendar early.

473
00:46:32,077 --> 00:46:34,698
Don't pay them fellas no nevermind, girls.

474
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,616
Come on, Eddie. Drink up.

475
00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:40,998
Sure glad you got here.
I was tired watching those movies.

476
00:46:41,127 --> 00:46:45,835
Then why don't we go and adjudicate
this matter in chambers, as they say,

477
00:46:45,965 --> 00:46:49,796
and maybe we can make
a few motions or something.

478
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:54,090
- Well, if I don't hear any objection.
- Well, I sure don't object.

479
00:46:54,222 --> 00:46:59,725
Matter of fact,
I ain't gonna object to nothin' today.

480
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:04,016
Good. You're the kind of counsellor
I like in my courtroom.

481
00:47:04,148 --> 00:47:06,685
I object. She's supposed to be with me.

482
00:47:06,817 --> 00:47:09,853
Uh-uh, honey. I want the top man.

483
00:47:10,946 --> 00:47:12,985
Come on.

484
00:47:15,408 --> 00:47:17,447
Come on in.

485
00:47:20,788 --> 00:47:22,412
Speaking of courtrooms...

486
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,039
Oh, yes, your friends
who got into a little trouble.

487
00:47:26,168 --> 00:47:30,876
Well, don't worry. I'm told they're
good boys who just made a few mistakes.

488
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:33,792
I'm sure we can manage
to give them another chance.

489
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:36,332
Oh, I do hope so.

490
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:41,296
Danny is such a good person.
He just has terrible luck, that's all.

491
00:47:41,432 --> 00:47:46,638
Like when he was found in that alley with
a nine-year-old. He wasn't molesting her.

492
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:50,387
She was lovin' every minute of it
and them ropes didn't mean a thing.

493
00:47:50,524 --> 00:47:52,682
What? Ropes?

494
00:47:53,151 --> 00:47:57,693
And when he cut off that woman's fingers
that was only an accident.

495
00:47:57,822 --> 00:47:59,861
- Huh, Claudia?
- Sure.

496
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:02,695
Elroy's not really bad either.

497
00:48:02,827 --> 00:48:09,445
The dynamite he sells isn't nearly as good
as the smack he used to sell in school.

498
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,621
- School?
- High school.

499
00:48:12,752 --> 00:48:17,662
He never dealt nothing more than grass
in grade school, you know.

500
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:20,254
Sounds like a public menace.

501
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,974
Oh, but he don't mean to be.

502
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:33,312
You'll be nice to them boys, won't you,
if we're nice to you?

503
00:48:33,438 --> 00:48:37,351
Well, I guess we'll have to see
just how nice.

504
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:40,400
Hey. Not so fast.

505
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:43,896
Yeah, take it easy.

506
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,067
We've got very special plans for you.

507
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:49,240
Really? What?

508
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:03,914
Will you look at that?

509
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:06,835
Baby, is this what
you were gonna use on me?

510
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:09,673
- What?
- I mean, I've heard of a meat shortage,

511
00:49:09,805 --> 00:49:12,212
but that's ridiculous.

512
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:18,264
Well, you gotta...
Well, the other girls liked it.

513
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:22,685
Oh, I'm sure I'll like it,
but I just can't find it.

514
00:49:22,816 --> 00:49:26,813
Claudia, help me find it.
I'm sure it's under here somewhere.

515
00:49:27,988 --> 00:49:30,027
Watch it. Don't roll on it.

516
00:49:31,408 --> 00:49:36,152
The charge, Your Honour,
is assault with a very undeadly weapon.

517
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:39,121
I mean, you talk about
your blunt instrument.

518
00:49:39,248 --> 00:49:42,414
You're different, all right,
I'll say that for you.

519
00:49:42,543 --> 00:49:44,618
Mm... You too, little man.

520
00:49:44,753 --> 00:49:48,335
But I can play along with the gag
as well as the next fella.

521
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:50,374
What happens now?

522
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:54,208
Now we get serious, lover.

523
00:50:02,227 --> 00:50:04,468
Come on.

524
00:50:04,605 --> 00:50:06,644
That's it.

525
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:10,856
Oh, yeah.

526
00:50:12,111 --> 00:50:15,111
Now you're gonna get
the real taste of honey.

527
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:17,361
- Yeah?
- You ready?

528
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:30,040
You pink-ass, corrupt judge!
Take your little noodle outta here.

529
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,463
And if you see a man anywhere,
send him in because I do need a man.

530
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:46,632
Agh! Help me! Oh!

531
00:50:49,187 --> 00:50:51,345
- Oh, help!
- What's he doing?

532
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,520
I'll handle this, girls.

533
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:05,860
Lecher! Shame!

534
00:51:05,994 --> 00:51:09,528
Shame! Lecher! Lecher!

535
00:51:10,748 --> 00:51:12,657
I mean, that was...

536
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:17,500
I think that was
the funniest thing I've ever seen.

537
00:51:19,214 --> 00:51:21,253
Oh, man, was it worth it.

538
00:51:21,383 --> 00:51:24,087
You know what
they're gonna do to us, baby?

539
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:26,294
Yeah, nothin'.

540
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:29,215
In fact, all the doin'
is gonna be done to them.

541
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:33,761
They're gonna kick our ass,
but I ain't afraid.

542
00:51:33,894 --> 00:51:39,053
I mean, I know it's crazy cos I know what
they're gonna do to us, but I ain't afraid.

543
00:51:40,651 --> 00:51:43,687
I ain't never gonna see little Jason again.

544
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,646
Or my man neither!

545
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,270
So I don't give a shit no more.

546
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:54,530
Oh, Misty, I love that little boy.

547
00:51:54,663 --> 00:51:56,370
I really do.

548
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:59,455
I love him so much.

549
00:52:00,836 --> 00:52:03,706
Claudia. Claudia, pull yourself together.

550
00:52:05,298 --> 00:52:08,002
This is no time to fall apart.

551
00:52:08,134 --> 00:52:11,170
Now, I'm gonna... Sh, sh, Claudia.

552
00:52:11,304 --> 00:52:15,301
Listen to me. I'm gonna take you
to a place where you can wait for me.

553
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,673
You understand? Understand?

554
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,602
OK, now I got everything all worked out.

555
00:52:23,732 --> 00:52:26,187
You just do what I tell you, OK?

556
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:37,117
Judge Fenton threw the book
at our dealers this morning.

557
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,037
- I can't understand it. What do you mean?
- 20 years apiece.

558
00:52:51,173 --> 00:52:54,209
And after the trouble we took
getting them into his court.

559
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:57,177
- He wouldn't even talk to me.
- Oh, my God, why?

560
00:52:57,304 --> 00:53:00,838
That's what I wanna know.
I thought you had the fix in.

561
00:53:00,974 --> 00:53:04,841
How can I keep our dealers in line
if they see we can't deliver protection?

562
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:07,647
Yes, I know how important that is.

563
00:53:07,772 --> 00:53:12,647
Well, do you know the word is out all over
town? The whole operation is in a panic.

564
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:16,725
Two of our street pushers have already
left the city. What went wrong?

565
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:18,689
I don't know.

566
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:23,948
I put him with Claudia
and that new girl, Misty Cotton.

567
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:26,449
Said it all went well. It was all set up.

568
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:31,242
Oh, she did, did she? I thought that
black bitch was too good to be true.

569
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:35,545
She wouldn't dare pull a trick like that.

570
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:38,589
We'll find out. I got the word out on 'em.

571
00:53:38,717 --> 00:53:44,303
If either one shows their face anywhere
in the city, I know about it in five minutes.

572
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,260
Claudia.

573
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,679
Claudia?

574
00:54:17,169 --> 00:54:21,213
Workin' in a factory's no life.
Turns you into a fuckin' machine.

575
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:26,629
I don't need that shit. I'm a goddamn lady.
I don't need to work in no fuckin' factory.

576
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:30,384
Scotch, water back.

577
00:54:38,271 --> 00:54:40,310
There you go.

578
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:56,442
You see that little black chick
down at the end?

579
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,782
Funny you ask. I ain't taken
my eye off her since she come in.

580
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:05,336
Nothin' funny about it. The word is
keep her here. Any way you have to.

581
00:55:05,463 --> 00:55:07,704
It'll be my pleasure.

582
00:55:16,598 --> 00:55:19,053
Hey. You a model or somethin'?

583
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,179
- Somethin'.
- I always liked the idea of bein' a model.

584
00:55:24,313 --> 00:55:29,307
Let the bastards look without lettin' 'em
touch. That always did appeal to me.

585
00:55:51,254 --> 00:55:55,333
Claudia, what are you doin' in here?
I asked you to wait for me.

586
00:55:55,467 --> 00:55:57,091
I needed a drink.

587
00:55:57,218 --> 00:56:01,594
You're going to Seattle with your old man.
He's waiting at the airport. Come on.

588
00:56:01,722 --> 00:56:05,173
Wait a minute, bitch.
Why don't you go find one of your own?

589
00:56:05,309 --> 00:56:08,060
Now, you wait a minute.
This is none of your business.

590
00:56:08,187 --> 00:56:12,931
Before you start talkin' tough, I better
warn you I got a black belt in karate.

591
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:18,605
So why don't you get out of here quietly
while you still got teeth in that ugly face?

592
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,905
And I got my black belt in bar stools.

593
00:56:34,002 --> 00:56:36,492
Come on, Claudia. Let's get outta here.

594
00:56:38,256 --> 00:56:43,131
Hold it. I don't like what you just did.
Bobbie happens to be a friend of ours.

595
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:46,177
Then maybe you'd like a taste
of what she just got.

596
00:56:46,305 --> 00:56:49,009
Leave her alone. They're friends of ours.

597
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:51,180
Oh, shut up.

598
00:56:53,686 --> 00:56:55,808
Grab that chair! Grab that chair!

599
00:56:55,939 --> 00:56:58,608
Get your hands off me, you bitch!

600
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,745
Agh! Let go of my hair, bitch!

601
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:26,837
Come on. Let's shake ass!

602
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,269
- Hey, look.
- Haul ass. I'll slow 'em down.

603
00:57:52,407 --> 00:57:56,735
All right, you get them.
I'll take care of the cops. No guns.

604
00:58:12,008 --> 00:58:14,047
I've got her. Get the other one.

605
00:58:14,177 --> 00:58:15,587
Get her!

606
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:18,925
Ow!

607
00:58:20,683 --> 00:58:22,722
Ow!

608
00:58:28,523 --> 00:58:32,983
- No, no, no! Let go of me!
- Come on! Come on!

609
00:58:33,111 --> 00:58:35,482
Come down, baby. This ain't gonna hurt.

610
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:50,247
That bitch. I'll kill her.

611
00:58:57,299 --> 00:58:59,872
Come on, kid. Give it to her.

612
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:06,468
- No, Bunyan! Don't mess her up.
- She cut me, Elias! I'm gonna kill her.

613
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:09,136
Miss Katherine wants her clean.

614
00:59:24,074 --> 00:59:26,315
Stop it, please! Please, don't.

615
00:59:27,285 --> 00:59:29,076
Stop!

616
00:59:29,203 --> 00:59:31,029
Bunyan.

617
00:59:31,706 --> 00:59:33,615
Bunyan!

618
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:39,707
Ease off a minute, will you, man?
Have a little finesse.

619
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:41,497
Save some for later.

620
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:45,046
Oh, I've got plenty for later.

621
00:59:46,302 --> 00:59:50,429
- What did you find out?
- Our boys ran a fingerprint check on her.

622
00:59:50,556 --> 00:59:56,059
They made her through her driver's
licence. Her name is Foxy Brown.

623
00:59:56,687 --> 00:59:58,975
You know something, Steve. What is it?

624
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,355
Well, it seems she was Dalton Ford's girl.

625
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:07,320
And, Eddie, she was with him
when he got it.

626
01:00:08,197 --> 01:00:10,983
That's right. I remember.

627
01:00:11,117 --> 01:00:13,572
Why didn't I recognise her?

628
01:00:15,996 --> 01:00:18,118
So that's it.

629
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:20,619
No, there's more.

630
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:24,250
The dealer who fingered him for us...

631
01:00:24,379 --> 01:00:28,079
- was her brother.
- That don't make sense.

632
01:00:28,216 --> 01:00:33,506
Well, maybe those people
just don't believe in family loyalty, Eddie.

633
01:00:33,637 --> 01:00:36,637
So it's just that simple, isn't it?

634
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:39,424
Yeah.

635
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:41,385
Just about.

636
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:43,890
But the game ain't over yet, bitch!

637
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:55,072
That ain't gonna do any good either.

638
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,982
You're gonna have to kill me,
or I'll kill you.

639
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,277
It's gotta be one way or the other.

640
01:01:01,413 --> 01:01:04,082
- Let me do it, Miss Katherine.
- No.

641
01:01:08,878 --> 01:01:12,211
Give her a shot of heroin
and send her out to the ranch.

642
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:14,212
The ranch.

643
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:19,918
Now, you know what the boys
at the ranch would do with her?

644
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:23,964
She'll probably love it.

645
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,551
Then when she's got a good habit
we'll send her to the islands.

646
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:30,142
She should bring a good price.

647
01:01:32,816 --> 01:01:37,228
Maybe she'll pay us back
for some of the trouble she's caused us.

648
01:01:37,362 --> 01:01:42,438
If there's enough of her left
when the boys get through with her.

649
01:02:46,425 --> 01:02:48,464
# Oh, yeah...

650
01:02:51,972 --> 01:02:55,423
# I know a girl who lives on a hill

651
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:58,476
# She don't put out, but her sister will

652
01:02:58,603 --> 01:03:01,389
# Oh, yeah
Ba-ba-boo

653
01:03:01,522 --> 01:03:03,929
# Ba-ba-boo, hm, hm, hm...

654
01:03:05,443 --> 01:03:09,392
# Now this same little girl
that lives on a hill

655
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:13,443
# Gives you a thrill for a five-dollar bill
Oh, yeah...

656
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:52,479
Want some? Damn you!

657
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:54,936
Get up.

658
01:03:55,071 --> 01:03:57,229
You give me any more trouble...

659
01:03:57,365 --> 01:04:00,567
- What's the problem?
- There ain't no goddamn problem.

660
01:04:00,701 --> 01:04:06,489
I'm just gettin' my kicks out of lettin' Miss
Big-jug-jiggerboo think she can escape.

661
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:10,036
Hm.

662
01:04:10,168 --> 01:04:13,204
Time for another smack-O then, I'd say.

663
01:04:13,338 --> 01:04:14,962
Sure.

664
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:17,876
One thing we've got
plenty of, baby, is dope.

665
01:04:18,009 --> 01:04:21,093
You don't ever have to worry about
feelin' down with us.

666
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,889
You're a lucky nigger, you know that?

667
01:04:25,015 --> 01:04:30,933
Yeah. It ain't every junkie broad's
got such good providers for a boyfriend.

668
01:04:31,354 --> 01:04:33,679
I don't need any more. I'm doin' fine.

669
01:04:33,815 --> 01:04:37,100
Now, now, now. Doctor knows best.

670
01:04:37,235 --> 01:04:41,695
Anyway, you're gettin'
just a wee bit more this time.

671
01:04:41,822 --> 01:04:47,325
Now, ain't that nice?
And you don't even say thanks.

672
01:04:49,621 --> 01:04:54,697
Thank you, ugly, prickless,
white faggot, peasant motherfucker!

673
01:04:55,209 --> 01:04:59,336
Did you hear that? Did your black mammy
teach you to talk like that?

674
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:03,246
And that ain't nice,
not here in our polite society.

675
01:05:03,384 --> 01:05:07,511
Shit. We ought to wash
your mouth out with soap, lady.

676
01:05:09,598 --> 01:05:12,551
Me, oh, my.

677
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:15,091
I'm beginning to get that old feeling.

678
01:05:15,228 --> 01:05:19,889
Funny how fast it comes
when a chick has really got the goodies

679
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:22,855
to show you.

680
01:05:24,111 --> 01:05:28,653
You might as well. I gotta go in town
and get some stuff to cut that smack.

681
01:08:00,671 --> 01:08:02,996
# They call her Linda-Lu

682
01:08:03,131 --> 01:08:04,838
# With eyes of blue

683
01:08:04,966 --> 01:08:08,168
# Give her a few bucks
And she'll make love to you

684
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:17,554
# She had a beautiful smile
And plenty of style

685
01:08:17,686 --> 01:08:20,686
# Give her a little kiss
And she would go completely wild

686
01:08:24,442 --> 01:08:26,767
# They call her Linda-Lu

687
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:28,562
# With eyes of blue

688
01:08:28,696 --> 01:08:31,530
# Give her a few bucks
And she'll make love to you

689
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:41,373
# She had a beautiful smile
And plenty of style

690
01:08:41,499 --> 01:08:44,369
# Give her a little kiss
And she would go completely wild

691
01:08:50,216 --> 01:08:52,457
What the hell are you doing? Get away...

692
01:08:52,593 --> 01:08:54,419
Ow! Argh!

693
01:08:57,597 --> 01:09:00,550
Help! Brandt, come and get me! Help!

694
01:09:00,684 --> 01:09:02,308
- God!
- Help!

695
01:09:02,435 --> 01:09:04,308
Hey, skinhead!

696
01:09:04,437 --> 01:09:07,473
I can't see. Brandt, help!

697
01:09:07,607 --> 01:09:10,393
- This is gasoline.
- You know it, motherfucker.

698
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:12,482
I can't see!

699
01:09:12,945 --> 01:09:15,020
- Jesus!
- Help me!

700
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:18,072
No! Help, Brandt!

701
01:09:21,911 --> 01:09:23,903
Argh!

702
01:09:38,885 --> 01:09:42,384
No, nobody knows how the hell
it happened. The whole thing blew up.

703
01:09:42,514 --> 01:09:46,890
I don't know. One of those idiots there
probably set off a gas tank or somethin'.

704
01:09:47,018 --> 01:09:49,508
I know they're screaming for their stuff.

705
01:09:49,645 --> 01:09:52,729
Just make do with what you've got
for a couple of days.

706
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,856
We've got a new shipment coming in
the first of the week.

707
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:58,023
Yes. All right, handle it.

708
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:05,612
It's that woman. She did it.

709
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,071
You know something?
I'm afraid you're right.

710
01:10:10,205 --> 01:10:13,407
You've got to find her, Steve.

711
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,827
- And kill her.
- Yeah.

712
01:10:17,337 --> 01:10:21,832
Yeah, and I know just
how to go about that. Eddie!

713
01:10:21,966 --> 01:10:26,508
- Yes, Mr Elias.
- I want you to get me a sawed-off gun.

714
01:10:26,637 --> 01:10:29,721
We're gonna kill ourselves
a couple of niggers.

715
01:10:30,557 --> 01:10:32,679
Just as you say, Mr Elias.

716
01:10:32,809 --> 01:10:37,636
Sometimes, baby, when you want
something done you gotta do it yourself.

717
01:10:38,398 --> 01:10:41,398
I love it when you're like that, Steve.

718
01:10:41,526 --> 01:10:43,648
So powerful.

719
01:10:46,697 --> 01:10:48,736
Gonna take this thing off.

720
01:10:59,959 --> 01:11:03,208
Oh, that new stuff is good, all right.

721
01:11:03,337 --> 01:11:05,376
And expensive.

722
01:11:05,506 --> 01:11:07,545
But good.

723
01:11:15,807 --> 01:11:17,633
- You want another blow?
- Sure do.

724
01:11:17,767 --> 01:11:19,973
Let's see how far this thing can go.

725
01:11:22,063 --> 01:11:24,102
Ah, yeah.

726
01:11:40,705 --> 01:11:41,985
Oh.

727
01:11:42,123 --> 01:11:43,949
Shit!

728
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:46,122
I'll be back in a flash.

729
01:11:54,718 --> 01:11:58,133
- Yeah, who is it?
- Open up, Link. It's Eddie.

730
01:11:58,262 --> 01:12:02,175
- I got some stuff for you.
- Man, I'm balling my old lady.

731
01:12:02,308 --> 01:12:05,308
- Can't you come back later?
- Are you kidding?

732
01:12:05,436 --> 01:12:08,009
I can't carry this stuff around. Open up.

733
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:12,688
All right!

734
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:19,026
- Hand it through the door, man.
- OK.

735
01:12:27,623 --> 01:12:30,457
No, Link. Drop it.

736
01:12:30,584 --> 01:12:34,035
Spit it out, nigger. Where is she?

737
01:12:36,756 --> 01:12:39,875
- What are you talkin' about?
- She's your sister.

738
01:12:40,009 --> 01:12:44,088
- You know where she is.
- I don't know nothin', honest to God!

739
01:12:44,221 --> 01:12:45,845
Talk or I'll blow your head off!

740
01:12:57,483 --> 01:12:59,025
Help me! Help me!

741
01:13:03,405 --> 01:13:05,860
Better finish him. Shut her up, will you?

742
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:25,500
Too bad. She was a good-Iookin' piece.

743
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:30,422
What? Link, too?

744
01:13:30,889 --> 01:13:34,174
They say it was those
Steve Elias people that did it.

745
01:13:37,478 --> 01:13:39,719
Was he dealin' again?

746
01:13:39,855 --> 01:13:41,894
Yeah. Coke.

747
01:13:47,362 --> 01:13:49,401
I guess I knew it all the time.

748
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:59,285
Once those people get their hooks in you,
there's only one way they'll let you off.

749
01:14:01,709 --> 01:14:03,915
You ready?

750
01:14:21,018 --> 01:14:26,723
We talked about your request and we're
not sure whether we want to help or not.

751
01:14:26,856 --> 01:14:32,098
We're a neighbourhood committee and
this is sort of out of our neighbourhood.

752
01:14:32,236 --> 01:14:35,070
Maybe the time has come
to grow a bit, brother.

753
01:14:35,197 --> 01:14:38,399
- What is it you really want?
- Justice.

754
01:14:38,534 --> 01:14:40,941
- For whom, your brother?
- Why not?

755
01:14:41,078 --> 01:14:43,319
It could be your brother, too.

756
01:14:43,455 --> 01:14:45,281
Or your sister.

757
01:14:45,415 --> 01:14:47,905
Or your children.

758
01:14:48,042 --> 01:14:51,291
I want justice for all of 'em.

759
01:14:51,421 --> 01:14:55,749
And I want justice for all the other people
whose lives are bought and sold,

760
01:14:55,883 --> 01:15:00,758
so that a few big shots can climb up
on their backs and laugh at the law

761
01:15:00,888 --> 01:15:03,343
and laugh at human decency.

762
01:15:08,186 --> 01:15:10,511
And most of all...

763
01:15:10,646 --> 01:15:12,887
I want justice for a good man.

764
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:16,391
This man had love in his heart.

765
01:15:17,653 --> 01:15:23,275
And he died because
he went out of his neighbourhood

766
01:15:23,408 --> 01:15:25,649
to try to do what he thought was right.

767
01:15:26,369 --> 01:15:30,236
Sister, I think what
you're asking for is revenge.

768
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:37,746
You just take care of the justice
and I'll handle the revenge myself.

769
01:15:56,814 --> 01:15:59,483
You said you had a plan?

770
01:15:59,608 --> 01:16:03,190
Do you have the name of the pilot
that flies the stuff in from Mexico?

771
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,858
And she nods like she understands.

772
01:16:05,989 --> 01:16:10,983
Now, how the hell did I know that chick's
gotta take a leak? I pick up the cone...

773
01:16:12,203 --> 01:16:16,152
I pick up the cone,
I put it all up in my ear like this and...

774
01:16:22,671 --> 01:16:28,091
Uh, y'all gonna have to excuse me.
I think I found me a new friend.

775
01:16:42,897 --> 01:16:44,936
Bartender.

776
01:16:46,776 --> 01:16:49,812
Get this dusky, young lady
whatever it is she needs

777
01:16:49,945 --> 01:16:53,147
to quench her magnificent thirst.

778
01:16:53,282 --> 01:16:55,404
Why, thank you, handsome.

779
01:16:55,534 --> 01:16:59,578
I couldn't help but hearin'
that marvellous story you was tellin'.

780
01:16:59,704 --> 01:17:02,373
I ain't never been in an airplane before.

781
01:17:02,499 --> 01:17:05,499
Sounds really marvellous.

782
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:08,412
- You ain't never been up before?
- Mm-mm.

783
01:17:08,546 --> 01:17:10,585
Oh.

784
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:14,296
That's a tragedy
of the greatest dimension.

785
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:19,052
I'd sure like to, though. In fact,
I figured if I hung around here awhile

786
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:23,178
one of you guys would take me for a ride
in one of your airplanes.

787
01:17:25,228 --> 01:17:27,434
Girl, you're some kind of lucky.

788
01:17:27,563 --> 01:17:32,853
It just so happens I am the best damn
airplane driver there is in these parts.

789
01:17:32,985 --> 01:17:35,440
- Is that an invite?
- Ain't it.

790
01:17:36,947 --> 01:17:40,730
Oh, gosh. That makes me
tingle all over just to hear it.

791
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:51,035
- Steve?
- Yeah?

792
01:17:51,168 --> 01:17:53,623
- Do you really have to go?
- What?

793
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:59,373
Why don't you let Eddie
make the pick-up for you tonight, hm?

794
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:02,213
I can't do that, darlin'.
This is too big a score.

795
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:05,298
I can't risk somebody else picking it up.

796
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:11,015
- I'm frightened.
- You? Oh, come on now.

797
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:15,640
It's that woman. She's crazy.
There's no telling what she'll do.

798
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:20,768
All right, listen. I'll leave Eddie and
one of the other boys here with you. OK?

799
01:18:24,824 --> 01:18:27,361
I really do love you in this shirt.

800
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,539
Oh, you make me so wild.

801
01:18:39,295 --> 01:18:42,414
- Tell me.
- Oh, I love you.

802
01:18:42,548 --> 01:18:44,836
Tell me again.

803
01:18:44,967 --> 01:18:47,338
I love you so much.

804
01:18:47,469 --> 01:18:50,968
Oh, yes. Yes.

805
01:19:05,444 --> 01:19:11,316
You can go now. I wanted you to know I'll
be waiting for you when you come back.

806
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:13,276
Oh, right.

807
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:17,407
Well, then I'll just get back
as fast as I can, huh?

808
01:19:17,539 --> 01:19:22,034
And then I'll show you
how much you really turn me on.

809
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:30,497
Hey, babe, why don't you
put this on automatic pilot

810
01:19:30,634 --> 01:19:35,628
so we can go in the back
and, you know, get it on?

811
01:19:37,765 --> 01:19:41,180
This ain't no 747.

812
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:44,394
You just hang on in there
until I'm done with this job

813
01:19:44,522 --> 01:19:48,305
and I'll take care of you real good.
You bet.

814
01:19:48,442 --> 01:19:52,273
- I'm hanging, baby. I'm hanging.
- Hah! Don't do this to me!

815
01:19:52,404 --> 01:19:56,353
Wait a minute. I gotta find a place
to land this motherfucker.

816
01:20:02,705 --> 01:20:05,871
- How are you, Mr Elias?
- All right, O'Brien.

817
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,127
- Nobody comes in or out till I get back.
- You can count on it, sir.

818
01:20:48,038 --> 01:20:50,196
- Mr Elias.
- Mr Tedesco, how are you?

819
01:20:50,332 --> 01:20:52,158
Fine.

820
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:07,259
Count it.

821
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:40,622
Well, at least he's on time.

822
01:21:51,137 --> 01:21:56,557
Hey, baby, why don't you keep your fuzzy
little head outta sight till this is over with?

823
01:21:56,684 --> 01:22:01,760
We might get in a hell of a lotta trouble if
somebody found out I took you to Mexico.

824
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:07,816
OK, I wouldn't wanna cause you
any trouble, you understand?

825
01:22:07,944 --> 01:22:10,565
I'm gonna get down here.

826
01:22:33,092 --> 01:22:35,131
Sh. Put your head down.

827
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:13,454
- What's the trouble, Officer?
- Plenty of trouble for you, spook,

828
01:23:13,587 --> 01:23:15,793
unless you go back where you came from.

829
01:23:15,923 --> 01:23:20,584
- This road's closed.
- Yes, sir. We sure don't want no trouble.

830
01:23:26,391 --> 01:23:30,091
- And neither do you, do you, whitey?
- No, sir. I sure don't.

831
01:23:54,959 --> 01:23:57,200
What the hell's she doin'?

832
01:24:03,258 --> 01:24:05,879
- What the hell's goin' on?
- I don't know.

833
01:24:38,332 --> 01:24:40,205
- Bunyan!
- Argh!

834
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:11,651
- I'm all right.
- Go get him, sister.

835
01:25:51,523 --> 01:25:55,105
What are you gonna do?
What do you want?

836
01:25:55,235 --> 01:25:57,690
What are you guys gonna do?

837
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:06,943
What, are you crazy?

838
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:10,034
What are you...

839
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,122
- He's ready, sister.
- No! You...

840
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:19,414
You're crazy.

841
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:21,173
You can't do this!

842
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,051
You can't do that!

843
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:25,383
No! No, Foxy!

844
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,636
Oh, no! Shit!

845
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:29,175
Argh!

846
01:27:23,315 --> 01:27:25,354
Hold it right there, spook.

847
01:27:25,484 --> 01:27:29,232
Yeah, you're gonna be a spook
for real pretty soon. Hands up.

848
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,662
- Don't pinch the fruit.
- Watch your mouth...

849
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:48,664
No, Eddie. Later.

850
01:27:49,881 --> 01:27:52,550
I want to know what she's doing here.

851
01:27:52,676 --> 01:27:54,715
I'll take that, bigmouth.

852
01:27:55,512 --> 01:28:01,680
Sure. I brought it for you, Miss Pimp.
It's a present from your faggot boyfriend.

853
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:03,848
See what it is, Eddie.

854
01:28:08,649 --> 01:28:11,186
Well, what is it?

855
01:28:11,318 --> 01:28:14,520
I don't know.
Looks like a pickle jar or somethin'.

856
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:17,819
Bring it here.

857
01:28:36,215 --> 01:28:38,503
Oh, Steve! Agh!

858
01:29:02,281 --> 01:29:04,107
Why don't you kill me, too?

859
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:10,322
Go on, shoot! I don't wanna live any more!

860
01:29:11,831 --> 01:29:13,704
I know.

861
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:15,659
That's the idea.

862
01:29:15,793 --> 01:29:20,288
The rest of your boyfriend is still around
and I hope you two live a long time.

863
01:29:20,422 --> 01:29:23,588
And then maybe
you'll get to feel what I feel.

864
01:29:23,717 --> 01:29:26,919
Death is too easy for you, bitch.

865
01:29:27,053 --> 01:29:29,508
I want you to suffer.

866
01:29:51,492 --> 01:29:54,161
The party's over, Oscar. Let's go.

867
