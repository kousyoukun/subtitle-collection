1
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,796
Hey, Mickey.

2
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,429
-Don't tell Mom.
-Don't tell me what?

3
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,194
Nothing. I forgot to go
to the store. No milk.

4
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,713
Fresh one down in the fridge.

5
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,068
What's that you got
behind your back?

6
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,474
Mom, you should've
seen his face.

7
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,113
You're a pushover, young man.

8
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,989
-Good morning, sir.
-Hey, Ben.

9
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,269
-Sit down.
-Sure.

10
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,912
-How do you feel?
-Good.

11
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,759
-Did you swim this morning?
-Yeah.

12
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,508
What are your holding
for your hundreds?

13
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,439
Fifty plus on the minute-thirty.

14
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,436
Not bad.

15
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,312
I can get it under 45, I think.

16
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,957
Can you do it in time
for the Fillmore meet?

17
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,751
Why?

18
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,315
Stanford scouts are flying down.

19
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,675
For the next 8 days,
I want you living in that pool.

20
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,673
And when you're not swimming,
I want you thinking about it.

21
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,319
I want you dreaming about it.

22
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,756
-You hear me?
-Yeah.

23
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,191
I don't mean to put any
undue pressure on you.

24
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,710
What are we talking about here,
your entire future?

25
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,155
Right. Right.

26
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,636
Go and change.

27
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,034
Alright. Thank you.

28
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,191
California boy, can l
have your autograph?

29
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,991
Nasty.

30
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,799
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

31
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,591
-Nervous?
-Yeah, a little bit.

32
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,592
-You're gonna kick ass.
-I hope so.

33
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,109
That is, until I outswim
your little punk ass.

34
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,079
And those scouts forget your name
and grant me the scholarship.

35
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,508
I just remembered why
we broke up, Josh.

36
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,709
You couldn't handle me in bed.

37
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,797
No, because you're an asshole.

38
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,869
Ben just got good news.
The response is congratulations.

39
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,149
You're right.

40
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,948
Congratulations, dickhead.

41
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,552
-Let's not be mature today.
-I'm all for that.

42
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,638
Let's make it Opposite Day
and everybody be immature.

43
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,553
Hey, watch it!

44
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,188
Forget about it.

45
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,469
Hey, Dante.

46
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,834
He's crazy. He's a freak.

47
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,518
-Hey, congrats.
-Thanks.

48
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,039
-So...
-So?

49
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,438
It might actually happen?

50
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,190
Can you picture it?
Me in California?

51
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,793
-And me in Rhode lsland.
-Yeah.

52
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,750
-That's 3,000 miles.
-I know how many miles it is.

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,718
-I love you.
-I love you too.

54
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,916
Nothing is going to change that.

55
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,908
-I bought you something.
-What?

56
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,799
Open it first.

57
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,192
-That is so beautiful.
-You're beautiful.

58
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,830
-You're so beautiful.
-Thank you.

59
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,476
I would even be here if it
wasn't for you believing in me.

60
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,239
This is a ploy to get laid.

61
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,036
Is it working?

62
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,469
Excuse me?

63
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,991
I can't get this thing open
and I'm late for English.

64
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,550
Do you think you could...?

65
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,515
I can take a look, yeah.

66
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,312
They gave me the combination, but...

67
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,272
I don't need it. I just need...

68
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,592
-...that, right there.
-This?

69
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,591
Thank you.

70
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,198
Can't let you be late
on your first day.

71
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,868
Is it that obvious?

72
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,832
Thank you so much.

73
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,834
-Here.
-Keep it.

74
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,077
You never know when
I might need saving again.

75
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,510
I'm Madison Bell.

76
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,550
Ben Cronin. Hi.

77
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,999
What the letter for, Ben Cronin?

78
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,232
The letter is for swimming,
Madison Bell.

79
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,312
-Are you good?
-I'm okay, yeah.

80
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,791
See you around.

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,353
-See you.
-Bye.

82
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,073
-There's my swim champ.
-Mom...

83
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,793
Better get started with Mr. Tillman.
He's been asking for you.

84
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,238
Ben! Give me some good news.

85
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,759
Scouts are coming next week.

86
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,836
Girl Scouts?

87
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,072
No, swim scouts, from Stanford,
to see me.

88
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,633
I asked you to find me a woman.

89
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,354
It's hard to find anyone in
your age bracket still breathing.

90
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,516
Here you go.

91
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,069
I almost forgot...

92
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,790
That's my boy!

93
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,273
Anything else?

94
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,193
You guys okay?

95
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,078
-Did you miss me?
-Like crazy.

96
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,474
Wait. I've been thinking.

97
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,677
What if I didn't go to
Rhode lsland next year?

98
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,711
What do you mean?

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,719
What if I went to Berkeley instead?

100
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,154
We'd be closer when you
go to Stanford and...

101
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,195
-we could get an apartment.
-Amy.

102
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,394
-I haven't gotten in yet.
-But you will.

103
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,318
If you hate the idea, it's okay.

104
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,911
No, are you kidding?
It's a great idea.

105
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,034
-Really?
-Really. It's a great idea.

106
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,149
Morning, Benjamin.

107
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,995
-A little early for you, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

108
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,791
I thought I'd get a little
lane time in before the rush.

109
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,153
Got to look good for the scouts.

110
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,750
Yeah, right.

111
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,119
I know they'll be looking at you,

112
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,238
but the rest of us
will be in the pool.

113
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,149
The more the merrier, buddy.

114
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,309
So... Madison Bell.

115
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,671
What?

116
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,151
She's a senior, originally
from down South.

117
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,909
I plan to hear that Southern accent
when she moans my name.

118
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,599
Or when she applies
the restraining order.

119
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,550
-Do you want to hear or not?
-Sure. What's up?

120
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,759
The reason she's up here
is her family's in Europe.

121
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,035
She's staying here with her cousin.
Guess who her cousin is.

122
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,754
-Who is her cousin?
-Christopher Dante.

123
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,108
You're set. He loves you.
He's gonna put in a good word.

124
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,676
-Do you think he would, seriously?
-He really would.

125
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,036
-Think about it.
-No! No!

126
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,750
Shit!

127
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,555
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

128
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,988
-I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

129
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,719
-No, don't worry about it.
-I didn't see you.

130
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,990
-Really, it's all right.
-Here, here.

131
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,392
Thanks. It's okay.

132
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,911
-Let me give you a ride.
-No, I'm fine.

133
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,917
It's the least I can do.

134
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,759
-I'm fine.
-Please? I insist.

135
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,591
-Well, if you insist.
-I do. Come on.

136
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,517
I wasn't looking at the road.
I thought I saw somebody I knew.

137
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,311
That way?

138
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,188
How's that for service?

139
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,952
You're a handy guy to have around.

140
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,117
Yeah, handy all over the place.

141
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,515
See you at school.

142
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,352
See you at school.

143
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,953
Handy all over the place.
What is that?

144
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,028
It's a boy.

145
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,471
Hello?

146
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,673
Hi, Madison. This is Ben Cronin.

147
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,193
You left your notebook in my car.

148
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,908
Pretty sharp. Got a date?

149
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,476
It's just pants and a shirt.
I'll be back in half an hour.

150
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,917
How's it going?

151
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,077
You don't have to be nice to me.

152
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,759
She's already going out with you.

153
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,554
No, we're not going out.
I'm just returning her notebook.

154
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,038
I'll take it.
No reason to hold you up.

155
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,918
I'm sure you've got
more important things to do.

156
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,076
Christopher?

157
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,073
Why didn't you tell me
I had a visitor?

158
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,274
I had to get out of there.
It's so stifling.

159
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,269
You okay?

160
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,712
Yeah. I haven't really
eaten all day.

161
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,992
-Here's your order.
-Thank you.

162
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,791
You're welcome.

163
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,353
So, I've been dying to know...

164
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,632
How come a nice boy like you knows
how to break into girls' lockers?

165
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,752
I didn't used to be so nice.

166
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,469
That's hard to believe.

167
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,831
It was a long time ago.
Everybody's forgotten about it,

168
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,553
except the cops.

169
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,028
You don't have to tell me.

170
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,198
No, I had a situation
with drugs which

171
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,478
turned into a situation
with stealing.

172
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,639
I spent 6 months in juvenile hall.

173
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,478
It was the best thing
that's ever happened to me

174
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,636
'cause they had a pool.

175
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,188
This shitty lab pool that
hadn't been used in years

176
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,391
and I got assigned to clean it.

177
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,669
Soon I was swimming in it
more than I was cleaning it.

178
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,309
It was easier for me to
jump in the pool and forget about

179
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,998
all the mess going on around me
and just swim.

180
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,672
When I play music sometimes,
I just play cello,

181
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,913
and I float out of my body,
above the music where no one

182
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,149
can touch me,

183
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,597
hurt me....

184
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,028
I can escape.

185
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,033
Do you want to escape?

186
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,751
Yeah, sometimes.

187
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,948
But not right now.

188
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,393
Right now, I like where I am.

189
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,599
I should tell you something.

190
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,628
-You have a girlfriend.
-Yeah. Amy.

191
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,868
-ls it serious?
-Yeah, it is.

192
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,149
She's the other reason
I turned my life around.

193
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,153
Story of my life.

194
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,316
Can't expect the nicest,
most handsome guy to be single too.

195
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,358
Don't worry about me.
I got someone waiting in New York.

196
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,392
A great guy.
A really good shortstop too.

197
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,953
The Mets are pretty interested.

198
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,559
The Mets? Really?

199
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,556
-Yeah.
-Wow!

200
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,390
But until we can live
in the same place,

201
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,512
we agreed to see other people

202
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,553
and that's what I intend to do.

203
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,517
My friend Josh

204
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,350
would murder me and step over
my dead body to be here with you.

205
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,155
Thanks, I'm not interested in Josh.

206
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,919
I should take you home.

207
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,154
-Yeah, you should.
-Yeah.

208
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,919
But...

209
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,953
I'm not ready to say goodnight.

210
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,030
What do you want to do?

211
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,635
Careful. I can't swim.

212
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,559
-Really?
-Yeah.

213
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,236
Show me how?

214
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,516
Yeah.

215
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,637
Come here.

216
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,268
You got to know how to float

217
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,078
and kick, so lean back.

218
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,317
Yeah... very important.

219
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,397
You're a natural.

220
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,668
-Like that?
-Yeah.

221
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,388
The side's right here.

222
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,589
That's easy.

223
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,472
It's okay. I want you to.

224
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,988
Wait, wait.
We can't do this.

225
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,428
We can't do this.

226
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,438
It's all right.
It'll be our little secret.

227
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,957
Maybe not so little.

228
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,468
Ben!

229
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,028
Tell me you love me.

230
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,276
What?

231
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,950
You don't have to mean it.
Just say it for me.

232
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,228
I love you.

233
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,756
So...

234
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,036
So...

235
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,195
-Don't think I do this all the time.
-No!

236
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,759
Of course not, no.

237
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,152
I don't want to be
a locker room joke, so...

238
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,548
don't tell anybody, okay?

239
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,433
I won't tell anybody.

240
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,269
Good. Still friends?

241
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,475
See you tomorrow.

242
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,551
You are so busted.

243
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,599
I thought you'd keep me company
in the restaurant last night.

244
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,629
I'm sorry. I had some homework
at Randy's.

245
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,428
How's his mom doing?

246
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,477
She broke her wrist.
Is it still in a cast?

247
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,519
She seemed okay.
I'm trying to...

248
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,913
Didn't seem like she was in pain.

249
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,599
That's good.

250
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,554
-I left you something.
-What?

251
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,513
It's in your locker.

252
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,753
I hope you like it.

253
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,190
-I love you.
-Yeah, I love you too.

254
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,950
Ben, I'm so proud of you.
I love having you in my life.

255
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,549
-Where will your parents be?
-Jamaica.

256
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,992
-Will they be gone all weekend?
-No, all week.

257
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,109
Nice.

258
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,431
I didn't hear Amy invite you.

259
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,518
I'm sorry, I didn't hear anyone
talking to you.

260
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,797
Good time on the over-sleep.

261
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,638
Coach is seriously pissed.

262
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,709
Are these for me?

263
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,473
They're a thank you for the card.

264
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,669
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

265
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,639
Way to swim, Josh!

266
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,392
Everybody else, keep your focus.

267
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,474
Focus is key.

268
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,876
Are you okay? What's up?

269
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,232
I don't know if it's
this low-carb diet I'm on,

270
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,274
but Ben and I are like this now
in the water.

271
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,199
Josh, he had a bad swim.
Why don't you give it a rest?

272
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,475
What's up, ladies?

273
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,839
What's going on? Everything cool?

274
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,635
-My swimming buddy.
-That's right.

275
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,910
-May the best man win.
-Absolutely.

276
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,712
There you go. I'm sorry.

277
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,955
Let me give you mine, buddy.

278
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,712
Ben, over here!

279
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,708
Oh my gosh!

280
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,599
I missed you. Where have you been?

281
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,358
-Around.
-Yeah?

282
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,396
Yeah. That's so great. Come here.

283
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,751
There's someone I want you to meet.
Madison?

284
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,872
This is my boyfriend, Ben Cronin.

285
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,355
Nice to meet you. Madison Bell.

286
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,910
Nice to meet you.

287
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,714
I already know all about him.

288
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,839
Amy can't stop talking about
her perfect boyfriend.

289
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,678
Even when I beg her to stop.

290
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,111
Excuse me. I gotta use the bathroom.

291
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,111
You want to hold this?

292
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,834
-lt was nice meeting you.
-You too.

293
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,628
Cronin, I'm making a video run
and you're truck's blocking me in.

294
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,390
I'll do it. Just one second.

295
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,675
I'll be right back.

296
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,115
I gotta get more ice first.

297
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,749
Keys?

298
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,712
Yes.

299
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,432
Don't we have English together?

300
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,712
She's really nice.

301
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,837
She's so sweet and uncomplicated.

302
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,716
Madison, this is a little
awkward for me.

303
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,188
We could go somewhere else.

304
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,749
-Not what I meant.
-I know. I'm kidding.

305
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,555
Is it hot in here or is it me?

306
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,070
I know you're tied up tonight,
but when do I see you again?

307
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,114
-I don't know.
-How about tomorrow?

308
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,357
Tomorrow's not good for me.

309
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,309
I should get back to the party.

310
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,592
By the way, do you have my panties?

311
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,633
-Excuse me?
-My panties.

312
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,231
I may have left them in your car.

313
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,836
Let me do it. It's acting funny.

314
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,196
Thank you.

315
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,073
You got to bring your times down.

316
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,757
I'm not seeing Olympic swimming.

317
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,239
And neither will Stanford.

318
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,588
I know. I've got a lot on my mind.

319
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,391
Sorry.

320
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,593
Get your head back in the game.

321
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,879
-Are you listening?
-Yeah.

322
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,311
Sorry.

323
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,830
If you think you'll waltz it through...

324
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,308
No, Coach, no!

325
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,470
I'll be ready on Thursday.

326
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,191
And whatever's going on
between you and your girl,

327
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,031
fix it.

328
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,510
Now go.

329
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,911
-I'm home!
-We're in here.

330
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,950
We?

331
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,077
-He's so cute.
-Yes, I know.

332
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,508
Happy birthday!

333
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,830
Those are beautiful. Thank you.

334
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,150
Madison brought me those.

335
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,079
I'll put these in water.

336
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,393
Surprise!

337
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,678
Can you excuse me for a second?

338
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,035
How long has she been here?

339
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,039
About 20 minutes. Who is she?

340
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,190
It's great to finally
meet your mother.

341
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,551
What do you mean "finally"?
You just met me.

342
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,319
It doesn't feel that way.

343
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,271
How did you know
it was her birthday?

344
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,631
You told me.
At the party, remember?

345
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,597
Madison? I think you're

346
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,678
misunderstanding our relationship
in a fundamental way.

347
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,830
-We're friends?
-Right.

348
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,319
Friends. Exactly.

349
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,948
Friends see each other and are happy
when they stop by with flowers.

350
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,788
What's the problem?

351
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,597
You're coming on strong, you know?

352
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,072
You didn't think so when
we were in the pool.

353
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,798
I have a girlfriend.
I told you I had a girlfriend.

354
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,877
What are you saying?
Making love to me was a mistake?

355
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,551
I guess I am. I'm sorry.

356
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,397
You want to forget about it?
Pretend it never happened?

357
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,948
Maybe I was wrong about you.

358
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,396
Madison?

359
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,392
You won't tell anybody, right?

360
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,112
Tell anybody about what?

361
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,472
Ben, it's not good for him.

362
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,475
It's not good for me either.

363
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,592
Yeah, but don't crap on the carpet
every time you're sick.

364
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,677
Got a point. Sorry, buddy.

365
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,230
-You going into work later?
-Yeah.

366
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,510
-I'll see you.
-Okay. Bye.

367
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,356
Ben!

368
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,349
Now what?

369
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,559
How many times have I told you
to club lock this car?

370
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,832
I guess I forgot. I'm sorry.

371
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,555
Shit, Cronin. Get a grip.

372
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,237
Please enter your password.

373
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,874
You have 81 new emails.

374
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,112
Picture received.

375
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,790
Gotcha!

376
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,189
So here's what I think.

377
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,838
When school's over, we should
go to my empty, parentless house...

378
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,758
I have work.

379
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,789
Maybe afterwards.

380
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,273
My shift starts at six.

381
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,795
Tomorrow?

382
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,548
Is it the meet?

383
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,428
I thought a little release
was supposed to help you sleep.

384
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,798
I just got work. I'm sorry.

385
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,672
I'll let you get back to it.

386
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,559
I'll give you a call.

387
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,868
-I'm Randy, a friend of Josh.
-Right.

388
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,630
-He's told me about you.
-Really?

389
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,956
-Yeah, he did.
-Cool.

390
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,035
Well, I'll see you.

391
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,714
So you and Josh? That's cool.

392
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,797
Could we just sit down?

393
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,431
I want you to know that I know.

394
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,636
-You know?
-I know how freaked out you are.

395
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,839
I know why. It's because of
the other night, right?

396
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,876
Yeah.

397
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,990
I was pushing because
it's senior year.

398
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,118
I was afraid of losing you, but...

399
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,878
but we don't have to make plans now.

400
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,908
We can take everything one step
at a time. I'm fine with that.

401
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,188
I am.

402
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,228
That was my whole speech.

403
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,158
I practiced it and everything.

404
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,068
I don't deserve you.

405
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,872
-Thank you.
-It's true.

406
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,036
I've been looking all over for you.

407
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,593
What are you doing in here?

408
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,550
What's going on?

409
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,589
You're not returning my calls.

410
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,868
Are you mad about Josh?

411
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,796
I'm late for work.

412
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,676
He doesn't mean anything to me.

413
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,592
When I'm with him,
I pretend it's you.

414
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,908
Wow!

415
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,790
Did I do something wrong? Talk to me.

416
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,673
I have a lot going on right now.

417
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,633
Maybe too much.

418
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,317
What don't you get?
I'm trying to drop you.

419
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,719
You don't mean that.

420
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,510
I don't know any other way
but to just say it.

421
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,197
I'm not with you.
I'm with Amy. Amy!

422
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,316
I told you this. Remember?

423
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,348
Sure I remember.

424
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,273
But I also remember
you told me you loved me.

425
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,468
You asked me to!

426
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,035
How are you feeling, sir?

427
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,759
Just get me some Viagra
and a nurse under 70.

428
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,756
Take these, please.

429
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,670
What's wrong?

430
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,034
Is it the swimming?
Pressure getting to you?

431
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,797
Take the pills. I'm running late.

432
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,755
Thank you.

433
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,429
I checked and re-checked
the meds before I left.

434
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,319
Somebody must've switched
the cups around on my cart.

435
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,316
Oh, Ben.

436
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,629
Even if I believed you,

437
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,312
it was your responsibility
to keep your cart with you.

438
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:01,951
You're lucky.

439
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,351
Mr. Tillman will recover
and no one was seriously hurt.

440
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,399
I'm sorry, Ben, but I have
no choice but to let you go.

441
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,468
I know what you're doing!

442
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,073
I'm telling you now
you better cut this shit out!

443
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,119
You should've told me
you like it rough.

444
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,959
This isn't a game, Madison.

445
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,039
You almost killed somebody.

446
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,797
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna stop calling me,

447
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,514
you're gonna stop paging me.
You're gonna stop visiting me!

448
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,311
Okay?

449
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,112
If you see me in the hallway,
pass by like I don't exist.

450
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,309
-You got it?
-Yes.

451
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,028
Good girl.

452
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,150
I didn't know you were coming by.

453
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,196
-What's wrong?
-We need to talk.

454
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,309
Can you take a break?

455
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,751
No, I can't right now.

456
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,836
Okay. I can wait.

457
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,757
I'm not done till one in the morning.

458
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,269
-You have to rest for the meet.
-Screw the meet.

459
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,668
What's wrong?

460
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,228
We can't talk about it here.

461
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,397
I can skip first period
and we'll go for a drive.

462
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,150
-The morning, okay.
-All right.

463
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,237
-I love you.
-I love you too.

464
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,238
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

465
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,278
Why?

466
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,076
Excuse me?

467
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,353
Are those the scouts?

468
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,869
Good luck.

469
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,232
-Ben?
-Yeah?

470
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,514
You tested positive for steroids.

471
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,188
-What?
-You heard me.

472
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,028
Steroids are banned
at this school, Ben.

473
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,118
Leave the pool area. Clean out
your locker. You're off the team.

474
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,311
You can't do this to me!

475
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,433
It's a mistake. I don't take steroids!

476
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,431
I don't take...

477
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,993
You did this to yourself.

478
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,918
Now go pack and go home.

479
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,758
Where is she? Where is she?

480
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,359
Dude, you're losing it.

481
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,710
You helped her.

482
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,715
Screw you, Ben.

483
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,949
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ben Cronin has been disqualified.

484
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,834
Ben Cronin will not compete
in this race.

485
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,836
Come on.

486
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,073
The winner is Josh Jefferson
in lane two!

487
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,511
Time is 1 :33:60

488
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,709
Are you taking drugs again?

489
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,353
Would you believe me
if I said no?

490
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,036
This is how it started the last time.

491
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,594
The lying, the screwing up
in school.

492
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,313
Once guilty, always guilty, right?

493
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,678
What I need is for everybody
to just leave me alone

494
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,077
while I figure out how to
get my life back.

495
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:08,991
Amy?

496
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,078
-Are you okay?
-No.

497
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,353
-And you?
-No.

498
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,115
-I can't believe that...
-She did it.

499
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,318
I really think you should go.

500
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,668
Ben.

501
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,236
Ben?

502
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,636
-What's the matter?
-My name is not Ben.

503
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,599
I know that. Josh, come here.

504
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,598
Josh? Josh.

505
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,268
It's all true, isn't it?

506
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,790
What?

507
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,468
Ben was telling the truth.

508
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,834
You want to hurt him because
he doesn't want you anymore.

509
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,879
Don't say that.

510
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,789
I should have known.

511
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,639
Ben would never do steroids.

512
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,270
He doesn't need them.

513
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,913
God.

514
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,437
You know what? Screw you!

515
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,830
How about that?

516
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,433
Josh, get back here!

517
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,878
Josh, come here!

518
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,308
Josh!

519
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,795
It's okay. I want you to. Touch me.

520
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,671
Hold me. Actually, you can't escape.

521
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,108
Tell me you love me.

522
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,873
I have to tell you something.

523
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,433
-Tell me you love me.
-I love you.

524
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,956
Help! Help!

525
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,314
...a loving son, a brother,

526
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,273
a wonderful student, athlete
and friend.

527
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,675
As we remember these words,
if we die with the Lord,

528
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,552
we shall live with the Lord.

529
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,875
If we endure with the Lord,
we shall reign with him.

530
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,196
Let your ears be attentive
to my supplication.

531
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,833
I trust in the Lord;
my soul trusts in his word.

532
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,154
My soul waits for the Lord.

533
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,789
I will consent to His love.

534
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,670
His love is kindness and redemption.

535
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,510
I didn't do it.

536
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,916
You didn't see anyone enter or leave?

537
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,395
-I told you I didn't.
-No, I know.

538
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,878
Take me through it again.

539
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,475
You remember how this works.

540
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,475
Not that long ago.

541
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,828
Your prints are on the bat.

542
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,237
Along with the rest of the team.

543
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,478
I'm a simple man.
I go by the evidence.

544
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,555
So arrest me.

545
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,148
We're not there yet.

546
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,196
But as they say,
don't leave town.

547
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,993
Don't leave town.

548
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,838
I'm never leaving this town.

549
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,948
You shouldn't be in here.

550
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,479
If she found you, she'd kill you.

551
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,908
No shit.

552
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,235
You better come with me.

553
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,316
Come on.

554
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,750
I found this. Here you go.

555
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,915
-Wait! Wait!
-Go!

556
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,271
Christopher? Christopher?

557
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,675
Do you have a guest?

558
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,997
No, that would mean you had friends.

559
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,997
Who's Jake Donnelly?

560
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,789
I want to show you something.

561
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,910
-What?
-Let's go.

562
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,593
Come on. It's not too far.

563
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,869
You coming in?

564
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,074
You go in. I'm staying here.

565
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,271
Go.

566
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,149
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

567
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,637
I'm looking for Jake Donnelly.

568
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,238
Don't worry. I've got someone
waiting in New York.

569
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,555
Can I help you?

570
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,318
I'm sorry. I'm an old friend
of Jake's.

571
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,799
Why you kids don't wear
seatbelts, I don't know.

572
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,399
His girlfriend did.
Walked away without a scratch.

573
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,710
I'll let you spend time
alone with him.

574
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,431
Thank you.

575
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,277
Madison left the room like this.

576
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,115
She was convinced he'd come back
to her one day. Poor thing.

577
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,599
Just throw on his clothes
and go find her.

578
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,828
You take your time, okay?

579
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,437
Mom, I got your page. What's up?

580
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,113
Paramedics just brought Amy in.

581
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,515
Ben, they're saying
you ran her off the road.

582
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,108
They have a witness.

583
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,875
Police are looking for you.
I'm calling you a lawyer.

584
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,433
He can meet me at the hospital.

585
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,154
There's Security everywhere.
They have your picture.

586
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,237
-25 cents.
-Shit!

587
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,671
-Mom, just listen...
-Please deposit 25 cents.

588
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,394
Madison is responsible, okay?

589
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,592
-Please deposit 25 cents.
-You got to protect Amy.

590
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,598
-Please hang up.
-Madison is coming!

591
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,788
Shit!

592
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,114
Jake Donnelly, will you
report to the nurses'station.

593
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,437
Paging Jake Donnelly.

594
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,996
Paging Jake Donnelly.

595
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,314
Jake Donnelly, please report to
the nurses' station.

596
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,755
Jake Donnelly, please report to
the nurses' station.

597
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,798
Jake Donnelly, come to
the nurses' station, please.

598
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,791
Paging Jake Donnelly.

599
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,070
Jake Donnelly, please report to
the nurses' station.

600
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,879
Jake Donnelly
to the nurses' station.

601
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,071
Jake!

602
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,435
Is that you?

603
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,913
You don't have the guts.

604
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,317
They think I killed Josh.

605
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,998
That I tried to kill Amy!

606
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,676
And I'm going to spend the rest
of my life in prison!

607
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,394
What's one more?

608
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,435
Don't be mad.
I did it for us.

609
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,356
Us?

610
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,428
You don't have it in you.

611
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,958
You couldn't hurt a fly.

612
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,194
How stupid do you think I am?

613
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,148
I don't know, baby.

614
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,153
How stupid are you?

615
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,669
These look like them?

616
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,316
It's them.

617
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,637
If everything checks out
with Ben's statement,

618
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,196
I'll ring your doorbell and
apologize in person. How's that?

619
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,828
Excuse me.

620
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,113
Shit!

621
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,358
Hey, watch the papers.

622
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,588
She's doing fine.

623
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,028
Did you find everything okay?

624
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,029
She can spend the night with us.

625
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,437
Have a safe flight.
See you in the morning.

626
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,318
My dad used to cheat on my mom.

627
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,396
It broke her heart.

628
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,710
I remember swearing to myself

629
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,313
that I'd never be like him,
and that...

630
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,478
when I found somebody I loved,

631
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,839
I would love her forever.

632
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,312
Never thought it was going to
happen so soon.

633
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,993
You're everything I ever wanted.

634
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,113
You're everything I ever could want.

635
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,395
I hate what I did and...

636
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,675
I got it!

637
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,636
Mom?

638
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,195
-Mom, I got it.
-Yeah.

639
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,470
False alarm!

640
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,357
Mom? Mom?

641
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,271
Amy!

642
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,236
Where are you?

643
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,390
See that?
You see that right there?

644
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,829
That's where we made love.

645
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:43,836
Madison!

646
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,070
Ben?

647
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,955
She doesn't love you like I do, Ben.

648
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,596
No one will ever love you
like I do.

649
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,869
You can stop all this
if you just admit it!

650
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,468
That you love me!

651
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:01,636
I can't do that.

652
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,519
Tell her, Ben!

653
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,915
Tell her you love me.
I know it!

654
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,310
Good going.
