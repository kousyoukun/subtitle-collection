我是克伦森多队长

Hey, Heil Hitler, everyone.

74
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,400
那么关于我的问题 我是谁 我为什么在这里
So, a little about me. Who am I and why am I here,

75
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,220
和一群小鬼聊天
talking to a bunch of little tittygrabbers,

76
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,330
而不是带领我的战士们战死沙场 问得好
instead of leading my men into battle to their glorious deaths. Great question.

77
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,770
搞砸行动后我每天都在问自己
I've been asking myself every day since operation "Screw up".

78
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,550
在一次防守敌人进攻的时候 我弄瞎了一只眼睛
Where I lost a perfectly good eye in a totally preventable enemy attack.

79
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,450
但我上级说 要双眼健全的人才能在战场上有所贡献
And according to my superiors, you need two eyes to be a meaningful part of the war effort.

80
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,240
双眼健全的人有我枪法准吗
Can two eyed people do this?

81
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,780
天呐

some of the things that my teacher in the army goes through every day.

84
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,270
即使我们的国家看起来很落后
And even though it would appear our country is on a back foot,

85
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,690
而且赢得这场战争的希望也不大
and there really isn't much hope in that's winning this war.

86
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,280
但显然 我们目前状况还不错
Apparently, we're doing just fine.

87
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,790
无论如何

这些都是材质特殊 造价昂贵的武器
These are very special and expensive weapons.

90
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,500
你们不准把它弄丢 也不准刺伤彼此
You should never be without them. And don't try to stab each other!

91
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,220
不许刺人

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,580
我不觉得
Not to me.

134
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,980
如果我遇到了 我会像这样杀了他
If I met one, I'd kill it like that.

135
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,210
就像
Like...

136
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,010
这样
That.

137
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,490
但你怎么知道他是不是犹太人  他们能伪装成我们的样子
But how would you know if you saw one? They can look just like us.

138
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,400
我会确认他头上有没有犄角
I’d feel its head for horns.

139
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,400
他们闻起来就像芽甘蓝
And they smell like Brussels sprouts.

140
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,630
噢是的 我都忘了芽甘蓝这个特征
Oh yeah, I forgot about the Brussels sprouts bit.

141
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,560
要是能抓个犹太人给希特勒
Imagine catching one and giving it to Hitler.

142
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,760
那肯定能让我成为他私人保镖的一员
That’d be a surefire way to get into his personal guards.

143
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,040
然后我们就会成为最好的朋友
Then, we would become best friends.

144
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,950
我以为我是你最好的朋友
I thought I was your best friend.

145
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,790
约克 你是我第二好的朋友
Yorki, you’re my 2nd best friend.

146
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,210
第一好友是留给元首的
First place is reserved for the Führer.

147
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,030
除非你是希特勒 藏在一个小胖子身体里
So, unless you’re Hitler, hiding in a fat little boy’s body,

148
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,440
这样我和第二好友在一起也开心
I’d be happy with 2nd place.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,820
我觉得我只是一个身材肥胖的小屁孩
I guess I'm just a kid in a fat kid's body.

150
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,930
谈话结束
Case closed.

151
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,510
当你们站在敌人面前 不得不杀了他时
When you stand before the enemy, and have to end his life.

152
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,600
你们谁有勇气这么做
which of you will have the stomach to do this?

153
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,030
很好
Good.

154
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,260
希特勒的军队不需要懦夫
There is no room in Hitler's army for those that lack strength.

155
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,990
我们只需要坚毅的勇士
We want hardened warriors.

156
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,110
随时做好杀戮的准备
Those, that are prepared to kill at will.

157
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,340
你们能做到吗  能
Can you do this?  Yes.

158
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,240
乔纳斯

159
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,470
你能杀人吗
Can you kill?

160
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,260

162
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,390
过来
Come here.

163
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,690
别害怕 来吧
Don't be scared. Come on.

164
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,200
很好
Good.

165
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,990
杀了这只兔子
Kill it.

166
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,510
拧断它的脖子 杀了这只兔子
Wring its neck and kill the rabbit.

167
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,810
还是你害怕
Or are you scared?

168
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,690
我没有害怕
I'm not scared.

169
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,140
我只是
I just...

170
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,690
杀了它
Now!

171
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,610
双手放在它脖子上
Place both hands around its neck,

172
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,930
一只手用力拧
and then one hard twist.

173
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,580
兔子可能会惨叫 但我们会用脚踩死它
He might scream, but we’ll just use the boot to finish it off.

174
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,870
杀了它
Kill!

175
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,530
干的漂亮
Good shot.

176
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,880
你和你父亲一样 都是懦夫
You are a coward. Just like your father.

177
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,820
他不是懦夫 他在意大利打仗呢
He’s not a coward, he’s fighting in Italy.

178
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,500
是吗 已经两年了 他杳无音信
Really? Well, no one has heard from him in 2 years.

179
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,240
他是个懦弱的逃兵
He is a deserting coward.

180
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,110
他害怕 你也一样
He's scared, and so are you.

181
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,270
你就像只胆小的兔子
You're as scared as a little rabbit.

182
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,650
胆小兔 也许我们也应该拧断你的脖子
Scared little rabbit. Maybe we should snap your neck too?

183
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,870
乔乔兔

184
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,300
可怜的乔乔 怎么了 小子

但是现在他们都叫我胆小兔
But now they call me a scared rabbit.

191

那些人想说什么就让他们说吧 之前也有人说我很多坏话
Let them say whatever they want. People used to say a lot of nasty things about me.

192
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,370
这家伙是个疯子 看那个神经病 他可能会害死我们
This guy is a lunatic. Look at that psycho, he's gonna get us all killed.

196
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,900
为它的家人 族群 搜寻萝卜

197

201
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,220

00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,960
看起来不错 孩子
Looking good, kid.

273
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,560
贝茨勒夫人 你看起来和往常一样迷人
Frau Betzler, you're looking fetching, as usual.

274
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,140
都是因为你 害的我儿子不能正常走路 还毁了容
It's because of you my son can't walk properly and has a messed up face.

275
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660
他抢了我的手榴弹 就扔…
He stole my hand grenade, just took...

276
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,840
对 对…
Yeah, yeah...

277
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,190
所以 在我工作的时候替我好好照顾他
So, you are going to look after him while I'm at work.

278
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,320
确保他有事做 不受排挤 知道了吗
Make sure he has a job and feels included, got it?

279
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,060
知道了 是 我知道了
Got it. Yeah, I really got it.

280
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,850
很好
Good.

281
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,090
各位 这是乔纳斯·贝茨勒 我和你们说过这孩子 还记得吗
Guys, this is Johannes Betzler, a kid I told you about, remember?

282
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:52,480
他抢了手榴弹 把自己炸飞了 最后我因为疏忽大意被降职了
He stole the hand grenade and blew himself up, and as a result I got demoted for negligence.

283
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,530
现在我只能和这些可爱的孩子一起在办公室工作
Now I get to work in this office with all these wonderful kids.

284
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,330
那么乔乔 我们会给你找一些活做
So, Jojo, I'm sure we can figure out something for you to do.

285
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,110
各位有什么提议吗
Ideas? Guys?

286
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,050
是的 我们需要人来陪这些克隆人
okay, we need somebody to walk the clones.

287
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,070
或者 他也可以去发这些新传单
Also, I think, maybe he could hand out this new propaganda,

288
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,370
贴征兵的广告
and deliver these conscriptions.

289
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,550
我想去应征入伍 可以吗
I don't suppose I could be conscripted, could I?

290
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,450
是的 这是个好主意
Yes, that's a wonderful idea.

291
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,960
我全权授权 允许你们把这个十岁的男孩送去战场
Yes, I give my full permission for you to send this 10 year old child into war.

292
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,190
有人能给他支枪吗
Will someone get this kid a gun?

293
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,000
我很乐意去法国打仗
And I'll be more than happy to fight in the France.

294
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,090
排队等着吧  孩子
Get in line, kid.

295
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,140
好的 这是征兵广告
Okay, here's the conscriptions.

296
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,830
这是你的枪
And here's the gun.

297
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,600
不用
No.

298
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,440
呸
Yuck!

299
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,360
看着
Look.

300
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,110
他们做了什么事
What did they do?

301
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,840
做了他们能做的
What they could.

302
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,430
走吧
Come on.

303
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,390
嘿 乔乔兔 看看你的怂样
Hey, Jojo Rabbit! Look at your face.

304
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,760
我要上战场了 你这个胆小鬼
I'm going to war, and you are a pup man!

305
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,320
乔乔兔
Jojo Rabbit!

306
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,010
妈妈
Mama?

307
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,690
菲尔德·马歇尔·乔乔回来了
Field Marshall Jojo is home.

308
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,340
你在家吗
Mama?

309
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,530
妈妈 我回来了
Mama, I'm home.

310
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,550
妈妈
Mama?

311
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,520
妈妈
Mama?

312
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,620
嗨
Hi.

313
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,780
你想干什么
What do you want?

314
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,130
你是鬼吗
Are you a ghost?

315
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,850
是的 我是鬼
Sure. A ghost.

316
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,370
别逼我追你 小鬼
Don't make me run, kid!

317
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:58,200
我很久没吃东西了 你知道我们特别喜欢鲜血的滋味
I'm far too hungry, and you know how much we love the taste of blood.

318
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,320
丢东西了吗
Lost something?

319
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,940
告诉你乔纳斯 我不是鬼 但我比鬼更可怕
I'm not a ghost Johannes, I'm something worse,

320
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,530
我想你已经猜到了 是吗？
but I think you already know that, don't you?

321
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,410
你知道我是什么人
You know what I am?

322
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,500
不知道  你知道
No.  Yes.

323
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,220
说
Say it.

324
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,440
快说
Say it!

325
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,200
犹太人
A Jew.

326
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,500
祝你健康
Gesundheit.

327
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,960
你不能呆在这
You can't be here.

328
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,410
是吗 你妈妈邀请我的 所以我算是她的客人
Well, your mother invited me, so, I suppose, that makes me her guest.

329
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,310
不可以
Not allowed!

330
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,760
那你想怎样呢 亲爱的小希特勒？
What will you do sweet Hitlerchen?

331
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,770
好啊
Of course.

332
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,620
去吧 告诉他们
Go on then. Tell them.

333
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,800
但是你知道这样做的后果吗
But you know what happens if you do?

334
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,650
我会告诉他们是你和你母亲帮的我
I'll tell them you helped me. And your mother too.

335
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,810
然后我们一起完蛋
And we'll all be kaput.

336
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,650
如果你告诉她你见过我
And if you tell her you know about me.

337
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,160
敢说一个字
Just one word.

338
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,940
我会极其乐意把你那纳粹脑袋砍下来
I'll do the world a great big favor and cut your Nazi head off.

339
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,290
听懂了吗
Got it?

340
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,860
懂了
Yeah.

341
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,710
这把刀我收下了
I think I'll hold on to this.

342
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,660
很好看
It's pretty.

343
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,810
天哪 刚才真惊险
Sheesh, that was intense.

344
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,890
我该怎么办
What am I going to do?

345
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,520
说实话 不知道
Honestly, no idea.

346
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,320
我是说 犹太人可能比我们想象的更多 你家墙后就可能住着几百个
I mean, there could be more of them. Hundreds of them, living in your walls.

347
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,430
她是怎么办到的
How did she get control like that?

348
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,960
她肯定用了精神控制术
She must've used her powers. Mind control.

349
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,550
绝对是
Typical.

350
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,970
你看见她刚跑得有多快吗  看到了
You saw how fast she moved?  Yes.

351
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,620
就像少女版犹太人杰斯·欧文斯
Like a little female Jewish Jesse Owens.

352
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,500
她还抢走了你漂亮的小刀
And now she's got your fancy knife.

353
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,310
我的刀
A knife!

354
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:57,140
是的 就像少女版版犹太人杰斯·欧文斯·开膛手杰克
Yeah, like a little female Jewish Jesse Owens Jack the Ripper.

355
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,980
你现在真的处境不妙啊 我的朋友
You're definitely in a pickle, my friend.

356
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,840
如何是好
What to do?

357
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,520
有啦
Got it!

358
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,050
把房子烧了 然后说是温斯顿·丘吉尔干的
Burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill.

359
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,420
要不就谈判
Or negotiate.

360
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,520
打扰一下
Excuse me?

361
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,970
小女孩
Little girl?

362
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,420
墙里的犹太女孩
Jew girl in the wall?

363
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,610
哟嚯 犹太人
Yoohoo, Jew?

364
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:48,410
好吧 那我就直说了 就是
Okay, well, I’ll just say what I have to say, and that's this,

365
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,380
我不怕你 而且我认为
I'm not scared of you and I think

366
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,270
你应该找别的地方去住 好吗
you should find somewhere else to live, okay?

367
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,150
不好
Not okay.

368
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,160
滚出我的房间
Get, the hell, out of my room.

369
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,090
你看 她真野蛮
She's pretty rude, you know.

370
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,050
刚才那只是我的两枚硬币
That’s just my 2 pfennige.

371
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,880
现在她可有两把刀了
And now she's got two knives.

372
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,950
我知道
I know!

373
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,170
这下你用什么切东西
How are you gonna chop up stuff?

374
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,800
我不知道
I don't know!

375
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,320
而且她还没走 还有 就是...
And she's still up there too, that thing, that...

376
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,350
她是犹太人  没错 犹太人
Jew!  Yeah, Jew, yeah.

377
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,940
我们该拿那个犹太人怎么办呢
What are we gonna do about that Jew?

378
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,250
你来想办法
You think of something.

379
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,600
现在我成专家了
Now I'm the expert?

380
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,580
别再给我递烟了 真讨厌 我才十岁
Stop offering me, damn, cigarettes! I'm ten!

381
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,010
好 对不起 我这会压力太大
Okay, sorry, I'm stressed out.

382
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,960
好 现在我们像土耳其人一样谈谈
Okay, let's talk like turkeys.

383
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,020
你不能告诉你母亲这件事 不然犹太人会砍下你的脑袋
You can't tell your mother or that Jew will cut off your Nazi head.

384
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,770
但是 阁楼里的这件事没理由毁了你的生活
But, there's no reason this thing in the attic needs to ruin your life.

385
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,080
事实上 你还可以利用她
In fact, you could use her to your advantage.

386
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,930
怎么说
How?

387
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,120
当有人试图控制我的心智时
When someone tries to use mind powers on me.

388
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,880
你知道我怎么做吗 反过来控制他们的
You know what I do? Use mind powers back on them.

389
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,630
还记得去年的时候 那个独臂海盗
Remember last year, when that onearmed pirate

390
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,050
冯·斯塔芬伯格想用桌上的炸弹炸死我吗
Von Stauffenberg tried to blow me up with a table bomb?

391
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,090
记得 你活下了来  回答正确
Yeah, you survived.  Correctamundo.

392
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,260
但除了我的腿不怕炸弹外 我能活下来的唯一原因
But the only reason I survived, apart from having bombproof legs,

393
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,760
就是我智取了老冯·斯塔夫
is because I outwitted old Von Stauffy.

394
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,630
我让他以为我死了 但其实我还活得好好的
I let him think that I was dead, when in actual fact I was absolutely fine.

395
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,080
凭借假死 我揪出了所有的背叛者
By pretending I was dead I drew out all the traitors.

396
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,730
所以你该怎么做
So, what are you going to do?

397
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,940
我也假装死了  没错
Pretend I'm dead?  Exactly.

398
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,380
等一下 不是
Wait, no.

399
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,960
不 我是这个意思
No, what I mean is this.

400
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,100
你让她感到安全 她就会放松警惕 这样你就能夺取控制权
Make her feel safe, and then she'll drop her guard and then you will be the one in control.

401
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,050
反向心理学
Reverse psychology.

402
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,660
不要把事情复杂化
Don't complicate things.

403
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,240
就用我的逆向思维能力技巧 一切都会水到渠成
Just use my backwards mind power trick, and everything will be fine.

404
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,530
我要走了 我家今天的晚餐是独角兽哦
I gotta go. We are having a unicorn for dinner at my place tonight.

405
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,830
集中精神 乔乔
Concentrate, Jojo.

406
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,290
记住 一个住在你墙后的犹太人总比
Remember, a Jew living in your wall is better than

407
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:38,090
两个像蝙蝠一样从烟囱飞进来吃无辜纳粹的犹太人要好
two Jews flying around with their bat wings, climbing down chimneys and eating innocent Nazis.

408
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,430
还有再别给她送刀了
And don't give her anymore knives!

409
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,810
我去也
Jews.

410
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,320
我的童子军 你怎么起来了
Darling cub, why are you up?

411
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,380
吃晚饭了吗
Did you eat anything?

412
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,050
对不起 我忘记时间了 我走了很久 边走边想...
Sorry, I lost track of time, I was talking a long walk and having a think...

413
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,120
你怎么不把鞋带绑好呢
What are we going to do with these laces?

414
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,250
我的天 你知道你该把鞋带绑好的
My goodness, you know, you'll have to tie them, eventually, you know.

415
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,130
我听到她的声音了  什么
I heard her.  What?

416
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,240
你说谁
Who?

417
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,320
英加 她的鬼魂
Inga. Her ghost.

418
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,930
我真替你难过
It's so sad for you.

419
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,480
你都神志不清了
You've lost your mind.

420
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,340
但我更可怜 因为我得和一个傻孩子住在一起
It's sadder for me though, because I have to live with a crazy person.

421
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,260
我听到楼上有声音
I heard noises upstairs.

422
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,930
鬼魂 认真的吗
Ghosts, honestly?

423
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,850
你知道我听到什么了吗 老鼠
You know what I heard? Rats.

424
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,190
是的 我们家里有老鼠 你敢相信吗
Yes, we have them. Can you believe that?

425
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,100
它们很脏 我一直劝你最好你不要去楼上
Dirty animals, I've been meaning to tell you to stay away from upstairs

426
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,400
直到我把它们全部清理掉 好吗 我不想让你染上病菌
until I've cleared them all, okay? I don't need you getting sick.

427
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,170
好的 妈妈
Okay, Mama.

428
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,810
我会小心那些肮脏的老鼠的
I'll watch out for those dirty rats.

429
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,740
刀怎么都不见了
Where are all, the goddamn, knives?

430
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,570
你也准备去睡觉吗
Are you going to bed too?

431
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,870
是 我一会就睡 我得先去整理些东西
Yes, soon. I have to tidy some things first.

432
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,960
什么东西
What things?

433
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,470
妈妈的东西
Mama things.

434
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,380
孩子 你得相信我 好吗 我是这儿的一家之主 不是吗？
Boy, you have to trust me, okay? I'm the boss here, yeah?

435
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,290
我猜是
I guess.

436
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,180
好孩子
Good boy.

437
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,710
对 但是有一只眼睛得睁开
Yes, but with one eye.

438
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,760
差不多了
Almost.

439
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,510
不是很对
Not quite.

440
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,740
太棒了 你做到了 耶
Great! You got it. Yeah.

441
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,080
你动静得再小点 他听到楼上的声音了
You have to be more quiet, he heard noises up here.

442
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,530
如果我得在你和我儿子之间做选择 我...
If I have to choose between you and my son, I...

443
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,160
我不知道把你送去哪里 你明白了吗
I won't know where to send you. You hear me?

444
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,120
不能让他知道 如果他知道了那他们就都知道了
He can't know. If he knows then they know.

445
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,290
你可以和他讲道理
You could reason with him.

446
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,850
你不了解他 他是个极端分子
You don't know him. He's a fanatic.

447
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,210
他花了三个星期才忘记他祖父不是金发碧眼的事实
It took him 3 weeks to get over the fact that his grandfather was not blond.

448
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,180
我知道他还保留着以前的天性
I know he's in there somewhere.

449
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,720
那个孩子喜欢玩耍却又害怕天黑 所以会奔向你
The little boy, who loves to play, and runs to you because he's scared of sundown.

450
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,270
还天真地以为是你发明的巧克力蛋糕
And thinks you invented the chocolate cake.

451
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,540
不过到头来也只是心里
In the end it's only a way of

452
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,820
留有希望
hope,

453
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,890
不愿自己仅剩的孩子沦为另一个鬼魂
in that your only remaining child is not just another ghost.

454
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,070
也许我们现在都是鬼魂了 只是不知道而已
Perhaps we all ghosts now, and we just don't know it.

455
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,800
也许吧
Perhaps.

456
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,640
你比大多数人活得更久
You've lived more lifetimes than most.

457
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,630
我那根本就不叫活着
I haven't lived at all.

458
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,410
你被改变了
You're being changed.

459
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,760
他们都说你活不了
And they say you can't live, that you won't live.

460
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,940
如果你真死了 那他们就赢了
If that comes true, then they win.

461
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,810
但目前他们一直是赢家
They have been winning so far.

462
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,910
他们不会赢的 你有着不可战胜的力量
They'll never win, that's the power you have.

463
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,500
无论何处 只要还有幸存者 他们就会输
As long as there's someone alive, somewhere, then they lose.

464
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,070
他们昨天和今天都没发现你 你要确保明天也不会
They didn't get you yesterday or today, you make tomorrow the same.

465
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,740
嘿
Hey.

466
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,990
明天也一样要躲好
Tomorrow must be the same.

467
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,420
天呐 痛死啦
Jesus Christ!

468
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,890
你必须做拉伸 那很痛吗
You must stretch. Does that hurt you?

469
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,540
超级痛
Yes.

470
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,650
很好 疼痛是你的朋友
Good. Pain is your friend.

471
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,450
很快你的腿就能恢复的只有一点点变形
Soon your leg will only be a little bit deformed and pointless.

472
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,000
我要把你推荐到其他游泳池去
I'm going to recommend another month of pool,

473
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,660
因为你脸上的伤可能会吓到其他孩子
because your face might scare the other kids.

474
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,330
很难看
It's kind of ugly.

475
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,530
好了 下一位该谁
Okay, who's next?

476
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,770
乔乔 我得走了
Jojo, baby, I have to go.

477
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,810
家里见
See you at home.

478
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,080
你好 K队长
Hi, Captain K.

479
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,830
嘿 这不是把手榴弹扔向自己的小家伙吗
Hey, if it isn't the hand grenade himself.

480
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,920
腿怎么样了 孩子
How's the leg, kid?

481
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:50,520
痊愈得差不多了 已经没之前那么痛了
It's pretty much healed. It only 80 % hurts now.

482
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,210
你们在这儿干什么呢
What are you guys doing?

483
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,570
我来教部队男孩们进行水战训练的
I'm here to teach the HG boys water warfare training.

484
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,040
你知道的 以防他们有一天要在泳池里打战
You know, in case they ever need to go to battle in the swimming pool.

485
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,620
我能问你个关于犹太人的问题吗
Can I ask you a question about Jews?

486
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,410
哦 什么问题
Oh God, why?

487
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,770
要是我发现个犹太人 我该怎么做
What should I do if I see one?

488
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:16,550
这样 如果你发现了犹太人 你告诉我们 我们再告诉盖世太保
Okay, if you see a Jew, you tell us, we tell the Gestapo,

489
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,380
他们再去告诉党卫军 然后军人会去杀了那个犹太人
and they tell the SS, and then they go, and they kill the Jew.

490
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,730
也会杀掉帮助过犹太人的人
And anyone who helped the Jew.

491
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,310
因为现在处于多疑时期 宁可错杀一千 也不放过一个
And, because, these are very paranoid times, probably some other people just in case.

492
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,110
这也是联合军队的过程
It's a pretty joined up process.

493
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,400
即使是犹太人先利用催眠让某人帮他们藏身也不放过吗
Even if the Jew hypnotized someone to make them hide the Jew in the first place?

494
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,160
我不太相信会有这种事发生
I'd be amazed if that could happen.

495
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,350
不 这事有可能发生
No, it can happen.

496
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,730
我叔叔就遇到过
It happened to my uncle.

497
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,540
有个犹太人催眠了他 把他变得嗜酒如命
A Jew hypnotized him, and he became a massive drunk,

498
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,280
好赌成性 还拈花惹草
and a gambler, and he cheated on his wife,

499
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,750
甚至跟我妹妹有着暧昧之情
and he had an inappropriate relationship with my sister,

500
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,770
他最后在一场无关的事故中一命呜呼
and then he drowned in an unrelated accident.

501
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,970
这都归咎于犹太人
But it was the Jew's fault.

502
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,680
不管怎样 你看到犹太人了吗
Anyway, did you see one? A Jew?

503
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,640
就算看到我也不确定能否分辨出来
I'm not sure I'd be able to tell if I did.

504
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,790
我也不能 没有他们滑稽的帽子 要认出来简直不可能
Me neither. Without their funny hats it’s damn near impossible.

505
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,880
应该有人写本如何分辨犹太人的书
Someone should write a book on the subject.

506
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,240
那样事情就简单多了
That would make things so much easier.

507
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,910
芬克尔 他们溺水了 快去救人
Finky, they are drowning, come on.

508
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,890
回头见 小家伙
I'll see you later, little man.

509
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,250
好吧 现在情况是这样的
Okay, here's the situation.

510
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,990
如果我告发你 你就会有大麻烦
If I tell on you, you'll be in big trouble.

511
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,990
我想你不希望那样
And I don't think you want that.

512
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,180
但你会接着告发我和我母亲 我们就会有大麻烦
But then you'll tell on me and my mother, and we'll be in trouble,

513
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,720
这是我不希望的
which I don't want.

514
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,330
如果你告诉母亲我知道你的存在 她就会赶你出去
And if you tell my mother I know, then she'll kick you out,

515
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,970
这是你不希望的
which you don't want.

516
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:04,340
如果我去告诉母亲我知道这件事 你就会砍掉我的脑袋
And if I tell my mother I know, then you'll cut off my Nazi head,

517
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,810
这又是我不希望的
which I also don't want.

518
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,310
所以现在陷入双方都不利的僵局
So, it's a Mexican stalemate.

519
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,440
这只是个普通的僵局
It's just a normal stalemate.

520
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,070
你想留在这里就得答应我一些条件
I have some conditions for allowing you to stay here.

521
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,010
条件  没错
Conditions?  Yes.

522
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,330
你要告诉我关于犹太人的一切
Tell me everything about the Jewish race.

523
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,170
没问题
Okay.

524
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:27,830
我们和你们外貌一样 但我们有人性
We are like you, but human.

525
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,730
请你认真一点
Please take this seriously.

526
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,920
你就当这是一次曝光 我想知道你们所有的秘密
Think of this as an exposé. I want to know all your secrets.

527
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,570
请你不要坐在我姐姐的床上
Kindly refrain from sitting on my sister's bed!

528
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,160
小子 她用不上这床
Boy, she doesn't need it.

529
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,060
你对我姐姐一无所知
You know nothing of my sister.

530
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,550
我和英加曾经是好朋友
Inga and I were friends.

531
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,580
我记得你 多么有趣的小男孩啊
I remember you. Such a funny little boy.

532
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,910
废话少说 开始跟我讲讲你们的种族
Enough with the small talk. Start telling me about your kind.

533
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,270
显然 我们都是贪财的恶魔 对吗
Obviously, we are demons, who love money, right?

534
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,490
当然了 众所周知的事
Obviously, everyone knows that.

535
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:04,280
但人们不知道的是 我们还对食物过敏
But what people don't know is that we also allergic to food.

536
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,010
像奶酪 面包 肉这些 这些东西会立马要了我们的命
Cheese, bread, meat. That stuff will kill us instantly.

537
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:12,340
所以你如果想了结我的性命 这是最快的方法
So, if you are thinking of ending my life, that's the fastest way.

538
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,670
还有饼干 也是致命的
Also biscuits  lethal.

539
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,880
真好笑
Very funny.

540
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,810
反正食物不够你吃 所以我不知道你到底想干嘛
Anyway, there's not enough food for you, so I don't know what are you doing to do.

541
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,040
你母亲设法给我找了些面包
Your mother managed to find me some bread.

542
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,520
她很善良 把我当人看待
She's kind. She treats me like a person.

543
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,300
但你不是人 不是个正派的人
But you're not. Not a proper person.

544
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,840
那你是吗
Are you?

545
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,980
你竟敢出言不逊 犹太人
How dare you, Jew?

546
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,490
你像根睫毛一样弱不禁风
You are weak, like an eyelash.

547
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:47,030
我有纯正的雅利安血统 血液如玫瑰那般鲜红
I am born of Aryan ancestry. My blood is the color of a pure red rose.

548
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,060
我的眼睛是蓝色的
And my eyes are blue.

549
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,000
挣脱啊
Break free.

550
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,390
伟大的雅利安人有本事就挣脱 犹太人没有软弱的
Break free great Aryan. There are no weak Jews.

551
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,570
我是那些敢与天使搏斗 敢杀巨人的强者的后代
I am descended from those, who wrestle angels and kill giants.

552
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,690
我们是被上帝选中的种族
We were chosen by God.

553
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:08,090
你不过是被一个连胡子都长不齐的可怜虫选中
You were chosen by pathetic little man, who can't even grow a full mustache.

554
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,590
还好意思说是更强的种族
The stronger race, huh?

555
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,540
所以你跟楼上那个犹太人的事进展如何
So, how is it all going with that Jew thing upstairs?

556
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,710
她根本不想和我说话
Well, she doesn't want to talk to me.

557
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,680
因为你是个纳粹分子
Well, you are a Nazi.

558
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,170
我想也是
I guess.

559
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,920
这本关于犹太人的书比我预想的要难写的多
This book is going to be harder to write than I though.

560
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,530
她在干嘛 她在烧东西
What's she doing? She's burning something.

561
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,410
烧的什么啊 你在烧什么东西
What is she burning? What are you burning?

562
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,750
她听不见你问
She can't hear you.

563
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,040
你在烧什么呢
What are you burning?

564
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,590
为什么这么开心
Why so happy?

565
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,010
事情正在转变
Things are changing.

566
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,130
同盟国拿下了意大利 接下来是法国 很快战争就要结束了
The allies have taken Italy, France will be next. And soon the war will be over.

567
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,400
该死的
God dammit!

568
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,600
你为什么这么高兴 你就这么恨自己的国家吗
Why does that make you happy? You hate your country that much?

569
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,110
我爱我的国家 我恨的是战争 这些战争既无意义又愚蠢至极
I love my country, it's the war I hate. It's pointless and stupid,

570
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,000
所以和平来的越早越好
and the sooner we have peace the better.

571
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,980
噢 战争迟早会结束 我们会将敌人挫骨扬灰
Oh, the war will end. We will crash our enemies into dust!

572
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,850
当他们被毁灭时 我们会把他们的坟墓当做……
And when they are destroyed, we shall use their graves as...

573
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,790
够了 别谈政治了
Okay, no more politics.

574
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,620
晚餐是中立地带 这张饭桌就代表瑞士
Dinner is neutral ground. This table is Switzerland.

575
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,220
我们吃饭吧
Let's eat.

576
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,680
你没在吃东西
You aren't eating.

577
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,510
没 我还没那么饿 可能会晚点再吃
No, I am not that hungry. I might eat later.

578
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,120
我现在就想喝一些葡萄酒
For now, I'm just going to chew on these grapes.

579
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:53,220
我今晚倒是特别饿 所以我可能会把你那份也吃掉
Well, I'm especially hungry tonight, so, maybe, I'll just finish yours.

580
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,360
不想浪费粮食
Don't want it to go to waste.

581
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,780
你今天过得怎样 乔纳斯
How was your day Johannes?

582
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,210
你知道的 就四处闲逛 当一个没有生活目标的畸形儿童
Oh, you know, just wandered around, being a deformed kid who has nothing to live for.

583
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,250
你才没有畸形
You are not deformed.

584
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,150
我的脸花的就像街道地图一样惨不忍睹
My face looks like a, goddamn, street map, woman.

585
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,080
我不指望你能理解 如果我父亲在这儿 他肯定能理解
I wouldn't expect you to understand. If my father was here, he'd get it.

586
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,910
可是他不在
Well, he's not.

587
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:33,910
我知道 不仅如此 我还无法摆脱你
I know. And instead, I'm stuck with you.

588
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,370
你想要你父亲是吧  是的 没错
You want your Daddy?  Yeah, I do.

589
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,360
是吗
Yeah.

590
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,270
那好
Fine!

591
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,040
不准跟你母亲那样讲话
Don't you ever talk to your, goddamn, mother like that!

592
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,140
保罗 怎么了
Paul, what happened?

593
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,630
保罗
Paul?

594
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,260
我冲孩子发火了
I yelled at the kid.

595
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,440
什么 快去道歉
What? Go apologize.

596
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,430
对不起 孩子
Sorry, kid.

597
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,220
啥 你那算哪门子道歉
What? What kind of apology was that?

598
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,790
对不起 孩子
Sorry, kid.

599
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,120
乔乔
Jojo.

600
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,420
我知道你很想我 但是我
I know you miss me, but I'm..

601
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:53,170
我去了别的地方 努力想让这世界变得不同
I'm out there, trying to make a difference in the world.

602
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,190
在我离开的这段时间里 拜托你照顾好我的萝丝
And while I'm gone, I need you to take care of my Rosie.

603
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,430
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

604
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,080
我能做到 爸爸
Yes, Dad.

605
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,110
谢谢
Thanks.

606
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,380
她也在尽她所能了
She's doing what she can.

607
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,880
哦 上帝 我们有个好孩子 不是吗
Oh, Gosh. We made a good kid, huh?

608
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,420
是的 好极了
Damn, that's good!

609
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,530
让我想起我和萝丝在红色沙龙跳舞的场景
It reminds me of dancing with Rosie in the red salon.

610
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,170
亲爱的 你还记得吗
You remember, honey?

611
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,610
宝贝 我当然记得
Of course, I do, babe.

612
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,720
嘿
Hey.

613
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:41,070
孩子 别一直坐着 来和爸爸妈妈跳舞
Don't just sit there, kid. Come, dance with your parents.

614
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,120
我想你帮我画幅画 内容包括犹太人住的地方
So, I'd like you to draw a picture of where Jews live.

615
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,740
吃饭睡觉以及犹太主妇放鸡蛋的地方
Where you all eat, sleep, and where the Queen Jew lays the eggs.

616
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,530
你真是个蠢货
You really are an idiot.

617
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,480
快点 我们还有很多事要做
Come on, we have a lot of work to do.

618
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,770
和我说说你家里的情况吧
Tell me about your family.

619
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,040
我可以告诉你犹太人的情况 但你没有权利知道我家庭的情况
I'll tell you about the Jews, but you are not privileged to know about my family.

620
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,710
但我得了解你的背景
But I need background.

621
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:52,240
你怎么总粘着我 你没有其他朋友吗
Why are you hanging around with me, don't you have any friends?

622
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,700
当然有了 他叫约克
Of course! Yorki.

623
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,970
约克  我最好的朋友
Yorki?  Amongst others.

624
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:59,250
你没有好朋友吧  我有 他叫内森
You don't have anyone.  I have Nathan.

625
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,370
内森 这家伙是谁
Nathan? Who, the hell, is that?

626
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,540
我的未婚夫 他是我最好的朋友
My fiancée. I have him.

627
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,570
他在哪
Where is he?

628
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,840
他在打仗 你看
Fighting in the resistance. See?

629
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,530
他曾在河边向我求婚
He proposed to me on the banks of the Fluss.

630
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,190
他朗诵着里尔克的诗 像位绅士般单膝跪地向我求婚
He knelt down like a proper gentleman, recited a poem by Rilke.

631
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,200
我回答'我愿意'之后 我们就在夜色中翩翩起舞
And when I said yes we danced into the night.

632
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,410
真无聊 谁是里尔克
Snore. Who’s Rilke?

633
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,510
一位伟大的诗人 内森最爱的诗人
A great poet. Nathan's favorite.

634
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,100
哦 内森最爱的诗人 知道了
Oh, Nathan's favorite? Yeah.

635
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,950
他会来救我出去 然后我们要去巴黎生活
He's coming to rescue me, and then we'll go live in Paris.

636
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,790
你想永远背弃德国吗
You'd turn your back on Germany forever?

637
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,860
是它先抛弃我的
It turned on me first.

638
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,510
好吧 我们不需要你这种人
Well, we don't need you.

639
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,030
你和你的蠢男友闭嘴吧 你们就去那个
You and your stupid boyfriend can shut up and go live in

640
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,780
人人沉默寡言 胆小呆滞 只吃长棍面包的国家生活吧
dumbcheesesnailbaguette land.

641
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,460
因为你现在还没有女朋友 你不会懂
Now, now, just because you don’t have a girlfriend.

642
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,240
我太忙了没有时间交女朋友
I'm way too busy for a girlfriend.

643
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,200
总有一天你会有的
One day you'll make time.

644
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,430
到时候 你心里只有她的身影
You'll think of nothing else.

645
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,780
你会遇到一个人 会每天都沉浸在
You'll meet someone, and spend your days,

646
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,040
梦想着再次将她拥入怀中的感觉
dreaming of the moments you can hold them in your arms again.

647
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,290
这就是爱
That's love.

648
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,820
荒谬
Ridiculous.

649
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,300
我画完了
Finished.

650
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,230
我让你画犹太人住的地方
I said to draw where Jews live.

651
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,890
你画的却是我的头像
This is just a stupid picture of my head.

652
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,830
是啊 那就是我们住的地方
Yeah, that's where we live.

653
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,450
里尔克
Rilke.

654
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,250
这个蠢货诗人的书在哪里
Where are you poetrywriting dumbheads?

655
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,210
不错 你的想法非常好 小兔子
Yes, great thinking, Rabbit.

656
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,540
我们将利用这些书来做一层假地板
We'll use all of these books to make a fake floor

657
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,000
当她走过来会直接掉进满是
that she'll fall through straight into a pit full of

658
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,550
食人鱼、岩浆和培根的陷阱
piranhas and lava and bacon.

659
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,620
她不会知道是谁袭击了她
She won't know what hit her.

660
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:50,750
你嘘我
You shush, shush me.

661
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,320
我们找本书就走 图书馆不可以大声说话
Let's get a book and let's go, libraries are dumb.

662
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,760
好的 我们现在做的真是件伟大的事
Yeah, this is a really good idea what we are doing right now.

663
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,530
如果她真用心了这会让她的心碎成两瓣的
If she had a heart, this would break it clean in two.

664
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,940
有件事我要告诉你
I have something to tell you.

665
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,860
我找到一封你未婚夫内森以前写的信
I came across an old letter from Nathan, your fiancée.

666
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,190
是寄给你的
Addressed to you.

667
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,040
你在胡说些什么
What, the hell, are you talking about?

668
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,610
我读给你听
I'll just read it.

669
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:24,960
亲爱的艾尔莎 我实在是难以启齿
Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say,

670
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,520
我不想和你结婚了
but I don't want to marry you anymore.

671
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:32,730
我遇到另一个女孩 我们彼此非常相爱并且亲吻了对方
I found a new woman, and we love a lot, and do the tongue kiss.

672
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,350
就像我最爱的诗人描写的那样
It's like my favorite poet Rilke says,

673
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,690
真正的相爱 要让彼此自由
We need, in love, to practice only this: letting each other go.

674
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,470
现在你自由了 在此向你说再见 抱歉
So, goodbye and sorry about letting you go.

675
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,870
你的前未婚夫
From Nathan, your exfiancée.

676
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,960
附言：我早就不打仗了
P.S. I am not really in the resistance.

677
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:55,140
我一直在向你撒谎 现在我只是个失业的胖子
I was lying. I'm unemployed and quite fat now.

678
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:28,160
不用开门 我忘记了还有第二封给你的信
Don't open the door, but I, actually, forgot that there was a second letter.

679
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:36,550
亲爱的艾尔莎 我想告诉你我现在不想和你分手了
Dear Elsa, I just wanted to let you know that I don't want to break up with you now.

680
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,910
我改变主意了 因为我不想你因为我而自杀
I changed my mind because I don't want you to kill yourself over me.

681
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,070
过去很多女孩子这么做过 这让我感到十分内疚
Which a couple of girls have done in the past, and it's pretty stressful.

682
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,750
我想你好好的生活下去
I need you to stay alive.

683
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,910
感谢上帝有个小男孩可以照顾你
Thank God you've been taken care of by that kid,

684
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:55,240
我敢说这个男孩比他的同龄人更优秀 更勇敢
who I must say is a remarkable young man beyond his years, and brave too.

685
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,860
总有一天我们会结婚的
And let’s still get married sometime,

686
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,620
尽管我现在一无所有
even though I am truly unemployed and have nothing going for me.

687
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:05,440
你亲爱的内森
Yours, Nathan.

688
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,880
贝多芬  爱因斯坦
Beethoven.  Einstein.

689
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,270
巴赫   格什温
Bach.  Gerschwin.

690
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,280
布拉姆斯 瓦格纳 莫扎特
Brahms. Wagner. Mozart.

691
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,870
这是你知道的所有的音乐家吗
Musicians, is that all you have?

692
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,410
里尔克
Rilke.

693
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,960
当然还有你最爱的犹太人之母里尔克
Of course, your favorite, Rilke. Jewish mother.

694
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,280
还有迪特里希  霍迪尼
Dietrich, then.  Houdini.

695
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,990
不 这不可能
No, that's impossible!

696
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,600
小兄弟你就信了吧 不信你去问毕加索、莫迪利亚尼
Believe it brother. Just ask Pissaro, Modigliani,

697
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,750
曼雷 格特鲁德 摩西还有他们至高无上的主耶稣 阿门
Man Ray, Gertrude Stein, Mr. Moses, and the king of them all Jesus Christi, Amen.

698
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,790
你说的都是些老名字
You’re just saying any old name now.

699
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:44,510
我从来没听说过这些人 现在我听够了
I’ve never heard of these people, and now I’m fed up.

700
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,640
嘿
Hey.

701
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:48,900
如果你再看到他写的信 你会告诉我吗
If you find any more of those letters, would you let me know?

702
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,590
当然会了 就这样吧 再见
Sure. Okay. Bye.

703
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,560
过去这河岸边都是恋爱中的情侣
These banks used to be full of lovers.

704
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,200
他们在这里唱歌 跳舞
There was dancing and singing and...

705
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,510
充满浪漫
Romance.

706
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,740
现在没有时间去浪漫了
There's no time for romance!

707
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,510
我们在打仗
We're at war!

708
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,620
浪漫永远在身边
There's always time for romance.

709
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,380
有一天你会遇到你的意中人
Someday you'll meet someone special.

710
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,900
为什么每个人都告诉我这些
Why does everyone keep telling me that?

711
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,500
谁还告诉过你
Who else tells you that?

712
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,830
所有人
Everyone.

713
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,920
总之 这是蠢货的想法
Anyway, it was a stupid idea.

714
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,260
你才是蠢货
You're stupid.

715
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,950
爱是这个世界上最强大的东西
Love is the strongest thing in the world.

716
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,460
我觉得这世上金属才最坚硬无比
I think you’ll find that metal is the strongest thing in the world,

717
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,560
还有炸药和肌肉也很厉害
followed closely by dynamite and then muscles.

718
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,300
除此之外我还没见过更厉害的东西
Besides, I wouldn’t even know it if I saw it.

719
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,570
天呢 你的鞋带又没系好
Surprise, surprise. Your shoelaces are undone again.

720
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,800
乔乔 当爱来临的时候你就会明白了
Jojo, you'll know when that happens.

721
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,600
你会感受到爱的力量
You'll feel it.

722
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,500
爱也是一种痛苦
It's a pain.

723
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,540
我打赌我只会屁股痛
In my arse, I bet.

724
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:59,180
是你的肚子痛 就像里面飞满了蝴蝶一样
In your tummy. Like it full of butterflies.

725
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:00,890
好恶心
Yuck.

726
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:02,790
是的 好恶心
Yeah, yuck.

727
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,840
行了 希特勒 我们走吧
Come on, Shitler, let’s get a move on.

728
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,610
嘿
Hey!

729
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,030
你怎么了 先生 我好担心你
What's wrong with you? I'm worried about you, man.

730
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,950
你又喝多了吗
Are you drunk? Again?

731
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,060
快点啦
Come on.

732
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:16,850
你能不能松开
Can you please untie...

733
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,560
你真的长胖了
You are really getting fat.

734
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,380
我没有
I'm not...

735
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,790
要不我把你留在这 好吗
You know what, why don't I just leave you here, okay?

736
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,810
我明天再来这接你回去 行吗
And I'll come and get you tomorrow. Okay, how about that?

737
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,780
你就当你是个大人 亲爱的
You think you are adult, darling.

738
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,950
明天早上我在家门口等你
I'll meet you back at the house, I think, tomorrow morning.

739
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:34,040
你成长的太快了 不像个10岁的孩子
You’re growing up too fast. A tenyear old shouldn’t be

740
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,080
这个年纪不该庆祝战争 讨论政治
celebrating war and talking politics.

741
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,440
你这个年纪应该在爬树 然后不小心从树上掉下来才对
You should be climbing trees, and then falling out of those trees.

742
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:43,820
但是元首说过 当我们赢得战争的时候
But the Führer says, when we win,

743
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:47,030
年轻人将会统治世界
it is us, young boys, who will rule the world.

744
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,830
德国在消亡 我们会输了这场战争
The Reich is dying, we are going to lose the war,

745
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,050
到时候我们干什么去
and then what are you going to do?

746
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,330
生活就是一份赠礼 我们要过好每一天
Life is a gift. We must celebrate it.

747
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:02,480
我们应该跳着舞感谢上帝赋予我们生命
We have to dance to show God we are grateful to be alive.

748
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,060
我才不跳舞呢
Well, I won't dance.

749
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,320
那些没有工作的人才跳舞
Dancing is for people, who don't have a job.

750
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,120
自由的人才跳舞
Dancing is for people who are free.

751
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,260
跳跳舞可以让你忘了所有这些
It's an escape from all of this.

752
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,830
好 那你可以一路跳回家
Well, you are free to dance your way home.

753
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,690
我骑车回去
I'll ride.

754
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,140
那可不行
Oh, no, you don't.

755
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,720
谁也拦不住我
No one can stop me!

756
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:35,150

恐怕今天没有内森的来信了
No news from Nathan today, I’m afraid.

764
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,750
他很可能在做什么有趣的事情  比如读读书 长长胡子
He’s probably doing something amazing, like reading a book or growing a beard.

765
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,180
怎么了
What’s wrong?

766
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,630
你想让我跟你说说犹太人吗
Do you want me to tell you about the Jews?

767
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:26,570
无所谓
I don't care.

768
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,150
最初我们住在洞穴里 在地球中心很深很深的地方
In the beginning, we used to live in caves, deep, deep in the center of the Earth.

769
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:33,890
等一下
Wait.

770
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:39,550
那地方很吓人 到处都是奇奇怪怪的生物 不过他们有个共同点
Scary places, full of strange and wonderful creatures all with one thing in common...

771
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,630
偷割别人的小JJ
Stealing the ends of penises.

772
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,310
不是 你个傻子 他们都热爱艺术
No, you idiot. The love of art.

773
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,990
不割别人的小JJ吗
No cutting penises off?

774
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,310
你到底听不听我讲了
Do you want the story or not?

775
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:50,840
你可以继续讲 但我知道小JJ的事是真的
You may continue, but I know it’s true, the penis thing.

776
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,870
你们犹太教教士拿它做耳塞
Rabbis use them for earplugs.

777
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,890
不说这个了 经过很多年的努力
And moving on. After many years of developing

778
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:02,050
精通魔法和咒语 我们慢慢地搬出洞穴住到了城镇里
magic and spells, we slowly moved out of the caves and into the towns.

779
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:05,790
不过当中有些人依然留在洞穴里 以动物的样子示人
Some of us stayed in the caves though, in animal bodies.

780
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,030
就像黏菌怪那样吗
Which are blobs or something?

781
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,590
我画给你看
I’ll draw them for you.

782
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,180
用彩笔画会更好看些
It'd be better with color.

783
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,020
犄角在哪儿
Where’s the horns?

784
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,290
在头发下面
Under the hair.

785
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:32,870
你的犄角呢
Where are yours?

786
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,230
我太年轻了 要到21岁才会长出犄角
I’m too young. They grow when you turn 21.

787
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:42,110
如今我们生活在普通人中间  通常我们会抢一套房子来住
These days we live among normal people, but often we take over a house

788
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:45,930
睡觉的时候我们就倒挂在天花板上 像蝙蝠一样
and hang from the ceiling when we sleep, like bats.

789
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,700
还有一件事 我们可以读取彼此的想法
And another thing is  we can read each others’ minds.

790
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,050
天呐 能读出所有人的想法吗 德国人的呢
Oh my God! Everyone’s minds? What about German minds?

791
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:58,580
德国人的不行 他们脑壳太厚了 我们没法穿透
No, their heads are too thick for us to penetrate.

792
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,760
就像小鸟一样 我们真正的语言就像是在唱歌
Like birds, our true language sounds like singing.

793
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,410
我们还喜欢亮晶晶的东西
And we also attracted to shiny things.

794
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,080
水晶 玻璃 还有金子
Crystals, glass and gold.

795
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:17,300
喜欢亮晶晶的东西
Attracted to shiny things.

796
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,340
你们还喜欢丑陋的东西 犹太人喜欢丑陋的东西
But also ugly things. Jews love ugliness.

797
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,440
这也是我们在学校学到的
That’s another thing we learned in school.

798
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:27,100
你也喜欢的 对吧 丑陋的东西
You love them, yes? Ugly things?

799
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,300
嗨
Hi.

800
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,200
你们俩好像相处的不错啊
You two seem to be getting on well.

801
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,890
我只是去确认一下她是不是还活着
I was just making she was still alive.

802
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:40,940
这关你什么事
What do you care?

803
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,210
不关我的事 我只是不希望家里有个死人
I don’t, I just don't want a dead person in my house.

804
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,570
你希望这样吗
How would you like it?

805
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,770
我乐意这样 请让我家里多几个死人吧
I'd love it. More dead people in my house, please.

806
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,880
你看 你们俩一起度过的这些时间
Look, just all the time you two are spending together,

807
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,970
让我感到非常不舒服
it's making me feel very uncomfortable.

808
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:54,980
一开始是你提议的
You suggested it in the first place.

809
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:55,950
是我吗
Did I?

810
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:57,670
是的  哦 对 确实是我
Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I did.

811
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,240
再说了 我是为了写书
Besides, it’s for the book.

812
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,350
天呐 你说的对 对不起 是我的错吗
Oh my God. You are right. I'm sorry. Did I make it weird?

813
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,190
现在咱俩有点闹别扭了 是吗 我们不应该闹别扭的
It's weird now, isn't it? It shouldn't be weird between us.

814
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,140
这一切都不该感到别扭才对
None of this should be weird.

815
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,130
没事 我就是有点累 我要睡觉了
It's fine. I'm just tired. I'm going to bed.

816
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:15,040
好的 我这是在替你暖被窝呢
Yeah, I was just keeping your bed warm for you,

817
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,000
好朋友就应该这样
'cause that's what real friends do.

818
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,580
嗨 你觉得这身制服怎么样？
Hey, what do you think about this uniform?

819
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,350
我不太确定裤子臀部这里是不是该更肥一些
I'm not sure about the hips on the pants. Should they be bigger?

820
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:24,360
看上去挺好的
You look great.

821
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:25,560
谢谢
Thank you.

822
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,860
听着 乔乔 我可以给你提一些真正的好建议吗
Now, listen, Jojo, can I give you some really good advice?

823
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,230
如果你看清了她的想法
When you see what's in her mind,

824
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,780
知道她想让你产生什么想法
and where she's trying to make you go in your mind.

825
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,790
你心里一定要反着来
In your mind, you must go the other way.

826
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:40,750
你明白我在说什么吗 别让她控制了你的意念
You're getting what I'm saying? Do not let her put you in a brain prison.

827
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:47,380
亲爱的乔乔 那样的事是绝对永远不能发生在德国人身上的
That, dear Jojo, is one thing that cannot and must not ever ever happen to a German!

828
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:51,450
别让她摆布你一个德国人的头脑
Do not let your German brain be bossed around!

829
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:56,370
我不会让她随意摆布我这颗德国人的头脑的 元首
I won't let her boss my German brain around, Mein Führer.

830
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:57,880
尽量不要
Try not to.

831
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:02,730
我想你的书里已经收集了很多不错的信息
Now, I think you've got a lot of good information in your book.

832
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,670
是时候公之于众了 你觉得呢
It's time to show it to the world, don't you think?

833
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,500
是的
Yeah.

834
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:12,430
阿道夫
Adolf?

835
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,370
你觉得我丑吗
Do you think I'm ugly?

836
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,670
丑
Yes.

837
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,840
他睡着了吗
Is he asleep?

838
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,270
他真是与众不同
He's different.

839
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,180
他起疑心了  认为英加的鬼魂一直在这儿
He suspects something. He thinks Inga's ghost ends up here.

840
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,100
看到你就让我想起她 真的
You remind me of her. You really do.

841
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:44,290
我真想看到她长成一个大姑娘
I would love to have seen her grow into a woman.

842
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:49,600
可我现在只能看着你
But I'll have to watch you instead.

843
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,270
我不知道大姑娘该是什么样子
I don't know anything about being a woman.

844
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:03,290
是这样的吗 可以做一些事情 比如喝酒
Is that what it is? You do things, like drink wine?

845
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,240
当然 可以喝酒
Sure, you'll drink.

846
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,600
高兴的时候喝点香槟
Champagne if you are happy.

847
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,590
不高兴的时候也喝点香槟
Champagne if you are sad.

848
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:16,810
可以开车 想赌钱也可以
You drive a car, gamble if you want.

849
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,490
可以有钻饰了 可以学怎么开枪
Own diamonds. Learn how to fire a gun.

850
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,830
可以去摩洛哥旅行 带着你的爱人们
You can travel to Morocco. Take up lovers.

851
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,790
折磨折磨他们
Make them suffer.

852
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,380
与老虎对视
You look a tiger in the eye.

853
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,770
能放心的交付信任 成年的大姑娘就是这样
And trust without fear  that's what it is to be a woman.

854
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,330
你是怎么做的呢
How do you do that?

855
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,500
你怎么知道有的人是可以信任的
How do you know you can trust someone?

856
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,890
信任他们就是了
You trust them.

857
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,180
晚安
Goodnight.

858
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:52,880
你刚才说的这些事 你都做过吗
All those other things. Did you do that stuff?

859
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,590
去摩洛哥旅行  还有其他的事情
You know, go to Morocco, and the rest.

860
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:02,090
没有 我从来没跟老虎对视过
No, I've never looked a tiger in the eye.

861
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:24,250
芬克尔 我说用来防守敌人的德牧是指德国牧羊犬
Finkel, I meant we'd need dogs for when the city is attacked, not, actual

862
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,610
而不是德国牧羊人
German shepherds.

863
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:29,010
让他们出去
Get them out of here.

864
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,870
让他们出去 立刻
Get them out of here! Now!

865
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:33,570
马上
Now!

866
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,970
请出去吧 谢谢
Move along please. Thank you.

867
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,430
很抱歉冲你大吼大叫了
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

868
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:42,660
我真是太蠢了  不不
I feel so stupid.  No, no.

869
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,800
只能怪狗和人用同一个名字
It's a silly name for a dog,

870
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,950
我应该说清楚点的 你工作一直都干的不错
I should've been more clear. You're doing a great job.

871
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,340
谢谢
Danke.

872
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:50,930
嗨 孩子
Hiya, kid.

873
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,920
我们能为您做点什么呢 贝茨勒先生
How can we help you today, Master Betzler?

874
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,810
最近怎么样 跟我说说
What's up? Work with me.

875
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,020
如果有人交出来一个犹太人 他会得到奖章或什么吗
If someone turned in a Jew, would they get a medal or something?

876
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:00,360
噢 犹太人 犹太人...你还在想着这帮人呢
Oh, Jews, Jews... You still going on about those people?

877
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,410
你也知道 这座城市随时将遭受攻击 我正在备战
You know, I'm preparing the city for imminent invasion, right?

878
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,590
我在尝试全球防御策略
I'm tying the planet defense strategy.

879
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:08,940
西边要抵御美国 东边要抵御俄罗斯
I've got Americans to the West. Got Russians to the East.

880
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,140
我有个朋友遇到了几个俄罗斯人然后被他们吃了
My friend once met some Russians and they ate him.

881
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:14,870
核桃代表哪国
Who's the walnuts?

882
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,390
核桃只是核桃 孩子
Walnuts are just walnuts, kid.

883
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,010
你想说什么
What do you want to talk about?

884
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,600
我现在知道了很多关于犹太人的事
Well, I am learning a lot about Jews.

885
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,650
你知道吗 他们真的会读心术
Did you know, Jews can read each others' minds?

886
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:26,350
他们睡觉的时候是挂在屋顶上的 就像蝙蝠一样
And when they sleep, they hang from the ceiling, like bats.

887
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,360
这太有意思了 你是从哪儿知道这些的
That's fascinating, where did you come by this information?

888
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,220
研究所得 我正在写一本书
Research. I'm writing a book.

889
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,280
噢 恭喜你了 书名叫什么
Oh, congratulations. What's it called?

890
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,610
《哟呵 犹太人》  这本书是曝光犹太人的
"Yoohoo Jew". It's an exposé on Jews.

891
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,950
书名也可以叫《你是谁 犹太人》
You could also call it "Who are you, Jew?".

892
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,190
叫《犹太人新闻》怎么样
What about "Jews News"?

893
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,440
你的想象力真是太棒了
You do have a wonderful imagination on you.

894
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,010
这些是真的  是 当然是真的
It's real.  Yeah, of course, it's real.

895
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,510
我在你这个年纪的时候 我还有个想象的朋友 叫科尼
When I was your age I had an imaginary friend, called Conny.

896
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:59,830
我睡着的时候他总在我床上尿尿 给我惹了不少麻烦
He used to wet my bed when I was asleep. He got me in so much trouble.

897
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,700
嘿 到这儿来 你也许想看看我都在忙些什么
Hey, come here, you might like to check out what I'm working on.

898
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,080
作为这次进攻准备工作的一部分 我正在重新设计我的制服
As part of our preparations for the invasion, I'm redesigning my uniform.

899
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:11,660
可以放上羽毛增加动力 闪闪的颜色可以迷惑敌人
Got the feathers for air dynamics. The sparkly color to dazzle the enemy.

900
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,490
这靴子 纯粹装饰
The boots, purely decorative.

901
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:14,900
这个
And this.

902
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,470
这是加特林机枪 装有无线电
This is a Gatling gun, mounted with a radio,

903
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,480
它们可以发出恼人的音乐来干扰敌人
which emits annoying music to dishearten the enemy.

904
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,600
顺便说一下 这都是受版权保护的
This is all copyrighted, by the way.

905
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,840
这就意味着你不能抄袭它
That means you can't copy it.

906
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,980
别想打歪脑筋 孩子
Yeah, don't give me ideas, kid.

907
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,550
那群孩子告诉我你父亲在外参战
The kids are telling me that your father is away fighting?

908
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:36,280
所以你现在似乎是这个房子的男主 感觉如何
So, it appears you are now the man of the house, how is that going?

909
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,670
还好
It's okay.

910
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,800
哈
Ja?

911
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,060
所以你今天给我安排了什么活
So, what jobs do you have for me today?

912
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,820
老实说只有一个活
I only got have one, I wouldn't lie.

913
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,890
跟你之前做的有点不一样 但是
It's a bit of a stepdown from what you used to, but

914
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,660
我们现在很需要人手
we need all hands on deck right now.

915
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,010
金属捐给希特勒
Metal for Hitler.

916
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,990
捐出锅盆为胜利
Pots and pans for the war effort.

917
01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:01,870
金属达人满街跑 为寻锅碗瓢盆金
Here comes the metal man, looking for your pots and pans.

918
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:04,500
为希特勒捐金属
Metal for Hitler.

919
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,380
锅碗瓢盆 来者不拒
Pots and pans.

920
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:31,460
解放德国
Free Germany.

921
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:37,870
乔乔
Jojo?

922
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:39,570
约克
Yorki?

923
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:41,380
嗨
Hi!

924
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,150
你现在是军人了吗
You're a soldier now?

925
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,580
乐意效劳
At your service.

926
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,610
但是你只有11岁
But you're only 11.

927
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:50,780
我知道
I know.

928
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,510
我可以看看吗  当然
May I?  Yeah, sure.

929
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,230
这是纸做的吗
Is that paper?

930
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:58,300
我起初也以为是纸 但它只是类纸型材料
That's what I thought at first too, but it's "paperlike".

931
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,660
这是种新型材料 由我们的顶尖科学家发明的
It's the latest material, invented by our top scientists.

932
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,350
哇 真让我大开眼界
Well, I'm impressed.

933
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:06,260
嘿 约克
Hey, Yorki.

934
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:10,100
我抓到一个犹太人 一个真人
I caught a Jew. A real one.

935
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,590
犹太人吗
A Jew?

936
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:14,710
我上个月看到他们抓了些藏在树林里的犹太人
I saw some that they caught, hiding in the Forrest last month.

937
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:17,850
在我看来 我觉得没必要这样大惊小怪
Personally, I didn't see what all the fuss was about.

938
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:20,850
他们看起来一点都不吓人 就和普通人一样
They weren't at all scary and seemed, kind of, normal.

939
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:24,570
差点忘了正事 我得走了
I'm getting distracted. I got to go.

940
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,050
拜拜
Bye.

941
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,810
天呐 穿着这身跑起来真费劲
Oh my God. It's so hard to run in this thing.

942
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:37,160
我找到一些彩铅
I found these.

943
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,910
你拿去吧 有可能是坏的
You can have them. They're, probably, broken.

944
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,620
没有别的意思
Doesn't mean anything.

945
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:45,350
或许你可以在我的书上画些东西
Maybe, you can draw something for my book.

946
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:49,580
我可以再画一次你
I could draw you again.

947
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,800
没有人想看残疾人的画像
No one wants to see pictures of cripples.

948
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,530
你不是残疾人
You're not a cripple.

949
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:00,590
再说 真正的艺术家是不会在意这些的
Besides, true artists don't see that stuff.

950
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,140
你是指盲人艺术家吧
Blind artists, you mean.

951
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:08,220
没关系 我会接受永远没有女孩子亲吻的事实的
It's fine. I'll just accept I'll be one of those guys who never get to kiss a girl.

952
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,270
你会被亲吻的 乔乔
You will be kissed, Jojo.

953
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,900
你想我吻你吗
Do you want me to kiss you?

954
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,130
好
Okay.

955
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,630
说两点
Two things.

956
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:22,290
首先
Thing number one.

957
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:27,240
纳粹和犹太人像我们这样玩在一起是不合法的 更别提亲吻了
It's illegal for Nazis and Jews to hang out like we do, let alone kiss.

958
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,470
其次
Thing number two.

959
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:32,750
这只是出于同情亲一下 根本不算吻
It'd just be a sympathy kiss, which doesn't count.

960
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:36,630
你不是纳粹
You're not a Nazi.

961
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:40,670
我很喜欢纳粹十字符号 我认为这是一个很好的证明
I'm massively into swastikas, so, I think, that's a pretty good sign right there.

962
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,960
乔乔 你不是纳粹
You’re not a Nazi, Jojo.

963
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:48,230
你只是个十岁的孩子 一个喜欢十字符号和奇装异服的孩子
You’re a 10yearold kid, who likes swastikas and likes dressing up in a funny uniform,

964
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:52,550
你想成为俱乐部的一份子 但你不是他们
and wants to be part of a club. But you’re not one of them.

965
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,620
好吧
Okay.

966
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,010
我们就求同存异 好吗
Let's just agree to disagree, all right?

967
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,850
不是纳粹
Not a Nazi.

968
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,530
好脏的犹太人啊
What a dirty Jew!

969
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,400
赶快 去藏起来 快
Come on, hide! Hurry, go!

970
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,520
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

971
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,770
我先自我介绍一下 我是福尔肯海姆国家秘密警察队的赫尔曼迪尔兹上尉
Allow me to introduce myself, I am Captain Herman Deertz of Falkenheim Gestapo.

972
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:16,790
和我一起的还有穆勒先生 容克先生 克鲁姆先生和弗罗施先生
With me Herr Müller, Herr Junker, Herr Klum, and Herr Frosch.

973
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,400
我们可以进来吗
May we come in?

974
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,010
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

975
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:27,440
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

976
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:53,460
嗨 乔乔
Hey, Jojo.

977
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:56,110
嗨 各位 很高兴见到你们
Hey, guys. Good to see you.

978
01:06:56,810 --> 01:07:00,130
我的自行车爆胎了  只能一路扛着来
My bicycle got a flat tire, so I carried it.

979
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:01,540
克伦森多队长
Captain Klenzendorf?

980
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:07,200
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler!

981
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:09,690
你认识弗雷迪·芬克尔吗?
You know Freddie Finkel?

982
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:14,780
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

983
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,940
我错过了什么吗
So, did I miss anything?

984
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:20,930
没有 没有 我们只是和这个男孩 还有你打招呼
No, no. We we just heil Hiltering the boy and then heil Hiltering yourself,

985
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:23,340
当然还有弗雷迪·芬克尔
and then, of course, heil Hiltering Freddie Finkel,

986
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:26,890
现在我们还在例行检查中
and now we in the midst of a routine inspection.

987
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,390
队长你又为何到此呢
And what brings you here, captain?

988
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:35,180
我们正好经过 觉得应该给这个男孩留一些宣传册
We were just passing by, and we thought we'd drop off some pamphlets for the boy.

989
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,870
他为我们工作
He works for us.

990
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,530
我明白了
I see.

991
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:41,920
你呢
And yourself?

992
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:45,190
你知道是怎么回事 我们每天都会接到电话
You know how it is. Every day we take a call.

993
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,750
您好 是盖世太保吗 我认为这里有共党
Hello, is that the Gestapo? I believe there's a Communist,

994
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,130
藏在我的冰箱后面
hiding behind my fridge.

995
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:52,080
我们去搜查了 结果只是些模型
We go around to investigate, it's just some mold.

996
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,980
每次都差不多
So, not far off.

997
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:56,240
这都是工作的一部分
It's all part of the job.

998
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,560
我就喜欢这样的小孩卧室
Now, this is my kind of little boy's bedroom.

999
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:06,630
噢真棒 他贴在那儿呢
Oh, yes. There he is.

1000
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,310
你和你朋友可能听过希特勒只有一个蛋蛋的谣言 简直是无稽之谈
You and your friends may have heard a rumor that Hitler only has one ball, this is nonsense.

1001
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,130
他明明有四个
He has four.

1002
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,390
所以你在希特勒青年团办公室当志愿者 是吗
So, you are volunteering at the Hitlerjugend office, yes?

1003
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:19,840
是的
Yes.

1004
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,460
你太棒了
Good for you.

1005
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:25,510
我希望更多的年轻男孩都能有你这样盲目的狂热
I wish more of our young boys had your blind fanaticism.

1006
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:32,110
这些笨蛋究竟在楼上做什么 我们上去看看吧
What on earth are those oafs up to? Why don’t we go upstairs and see, yes?

1007
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,230
你知道你母亲在哪里吗
Do you know where your mother is?

1008
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:42,430
不知道
No.

1009
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,240
我想她在镇上
I think she's in town.

1010
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:47,450
她在家待的时间长吗
Has she been spending much time at home?

1011
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,410
她很忙的
She is quite busy.

1012
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:52,460
是吗
Is she?

1013
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:59,650
我很高兴看到你穿着青少年团的制服 但是
Well, I'm pleased to see that you're wearing your Jugend uniform, but

1014
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,040
你的配刀呢
where is your knife?

1015
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,160
德军刺刀必须随身携带 它在哪里
You must always carry your DJ knife, where is it?

1016
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:09,710
我
I...

1017
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:11,580
放在……
Left...

1018
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,930
在这里
It's here.

1019
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:18,960
你是谁
And who might you be?

1020
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,530
你又是谁
And who might you be?

1021
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:22,390
你在我家干什么
And what are you doing in my house?

1022
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:24,930
你也住在这里吗
You live here too?

1023
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:28,650
我是他的姐姐 英加
I'm his sister, Inga.

1024
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,020
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

1025
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:44,700
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

1026
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,500
我不知道你还有个姐姐 乔纳斯
I did not know you have a sister, Johannes.

1027
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,570
有的时候他宁愿我死了
Sometimes he'd prefer if I was dead.

1028
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:51,820
是不是 小怪人
Isn't that right, little Frankenstein?

1029
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:56,810
现在没有必要去攻击他难看的身体缺陷
Now, now, there's no need to attack his hideous physical deformity.

1030
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,990
那是战伤
That is a war wound.

1031
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:00,760
可是
But...

1032
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,040
他的刀为何在你那儿
Why do you have his knife?

1033
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,160
我在守卫我的房间 因为他老是想进去
I’m guarding my room, because he refuses to stay out of it.

1034
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:09,050
你房里藏了什么
What do you have hidden in there?

1035
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,190
你懂的 女孩子的东西
You know, girl's stuff.

1036
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,180
我可以看一下吗
May I?

1037
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,490
当然可以
Naturally.

1038
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:26,260
你看 我们要处理很多报告
You see, we deal with an inordinate number of reports,

1039
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:31,910
斥责和做普查 当然
denunciations, and general investigations, and, of course,

1040
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:36,010
我们确实对犯罪问题和反政党情绪感兴趣
we are indeed interested in problems of crime and anti party sentiment.

1041
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:42,320
但我们还是有个更大的担心 那就是那群人
But we still have one greater concern. That's of the Goldilocksies,

1042
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:46,950
他们偷偷摸摸 吃别人的食物
sneaking around, eating other people's food.

1043
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:51,650
睡别人床 这些都是很粗鲁的行为
Sleeping in the beds, it really is quite rude.

1044
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,410
我想看看你的证件 可以吗
I don't suppose I could see your papers, could I?

1045
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,810
证件 贝茨勒小姐 请快一点 我们时间不多
Papers, Miss Betzler. Quickly, please, we don't have all day.

1046
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:02,800
好的 可以
Yes, of course.

1047
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,190
这张照片你几岁拍的
How old are you in this photo?

1048
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,610
照了有3年了 我当时14岁
They’re 3 years old, I was 14.

1049
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:50,310
出生日期呢
Date of birth?

1050
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:56,200
1929年5月1日
1st of May. 1929.

1051
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:03,130
正确 谢谢你 英加
Correct. Thank you, Inga.

1052
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:05,890
换张新照片吧 你这张看起来跟鬼一样
Get a new photo, you look like a ghost in this one.

1053
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,310
等等
Wait!

1054
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:15,050
这是什么
What is this?

1055
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:20,790
《哟吼 犹太人》
"Yoohoo Jew".

1056
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,990
告诉我谁做的
Tell me who did this.

1057
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,890
我做的
I did.

1058
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,060
它记载了犹太人的一切 包括他们思想行为
It's an exposé on Jews. How they think, behave,

1059
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:31,980
以及外貌 是给元首准备的礼物
look, it'll be a gift to the Führer.

1060
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,390
伙计们 你们得看看这个
Guys, you have to see this.

1061
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,450
看这个 他有一个尾巴
Look at this one. He has a tail.

1062
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,250
这里面的一个 像蝙蝠一样倒挂着
There's one of them, hanging upside down like a bat.

1063
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:47,130
这儿的一个 画的是他们的头
This one here, it is a drawing of their heads.

1064
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:49,850
是谁在操控他们脑袋上的机器
And who is operating the machinery of their brains?

1065
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,490
是魔鬼 真是有趣
The Devil. It's funny 'cause it's true.

1066
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:58,080
看这个愚蠢的犹太人 他们头上都长着角
Look at this little stupid Jew. There they are with horns.

1067
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,400
这是什么
What is this?

1068
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:04,430
杀死内森 内森去死 杀死内森的方法
Die Nathan, die. Ways of killing Nathan.

1069
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:07,820
内森 正被蛇折磨着 被棍子戳
Nathan, being tortured by snakes. Poked with sticks.

1070
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,270
被当做炮火发射
Being fired from a cannon.

1071
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:11,120
被冷冻
Just being cold names.

1072
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,900
内森正被古董自行车的巨大前轮碾压着
Nathan, being crushed under the wheel of penny farthing bicycle.

1073
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:17,690
请问谁是内森
Who is Nathan, please?

1074
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,800
只是一个男孩
Just some boy.

1075
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,630
内森被架在火上烤着
Nathan, being roasted over an open fire.

1076
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:25,360
它提醒我了 我们该回去了
It reminds me. We must get back.

1077
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,670
那个家伙还被我们吊着呢
Remember, 'cause we left that guy, hanging up.

1078
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:30,100
谢谢你的书 今天的时间没有浪费
Thank you for this, you have really made my day.

1079
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,660
希望你可以继续创作
I do hope you continue with it.

1080
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:35,910
当然 如果你发现任何可疑之处
And, of course, if you see anything suspicious

1081
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,590
给我们打电话
give us a ring.

1082
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,850
再见
Good day.

1083
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:43,200
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

1084
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:52,960
很高兴见到你 英加
Nice to meet you, Inga.

1085
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,290
在家待着 乔乔
Stay home, Jojo.

1086
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,830
照看好家人 照看好这把刀
Look after your family. Look after this knife.

1087
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,510
艾尔莎 你骗过了他们
Elsa, you fooled them!

1088
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:27,980
是5月7日
May 7th.

1089
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,550
什么
What?

1090
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,410
她出生日期是7号
She was born on the 7th.

1091
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,100
不是1号
Not the 1st.

1092
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:41,730
他帮了我们
He was helping us.

1093
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,980
他们还会回来的
They'll be back.

1094
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,700
他们会发现真正的英加已经死了 我也会没命的
They'll figure out she's dead, then I'll be dead.

1095
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,990
没有人真的知道英加死了
Nobody really knows Inga died.

1096
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,050
你可以替代成为她
You could be her.

1097
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,680
妈妈回来后我会告诉她一切
I'll tell Mama everything when she gets home.

1098
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,860
我了解你 我们是朋友
That I know you, and that we're friends.

1099
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,780
犹太人和纳粹不是朋友
Jew and Nazi are not friends.

1100
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:17,940
孩子 这完全是次突击搜查 介意解释一下么
Man, that was a complete bust. Mind explaining that?

1101
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:19,860
她不是……
She's not...

1102
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,380
她看起来不像坏人
She doesn't seem like a bad person.

1103
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:32,190
我开始怀疑你对我和组织的忠诚了
I am beginning to question your loyalty to myself and the party.

1104
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:35,410
你宣称自己爱国
You call yourself a patriot?

1105
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,730
好 证据在哪里
Yet, where is the evidence?

1106
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,510
德国士兵是因为需要才诞生的
The German soldier was born out of necessity.

1107
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,630
德国存亡取决于这些年轻人的激情
Germany depends on the passion of these young men.

1108
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:46,580
随时准备为国捐躯 慷慨就义
Passion and readiness to fall for the Fatherland,

1109
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:51,230
尽管那些盟军暴徒在做徒劳的斗争
despite the futile efforts of ally war profiteers,

1110
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:56,220
他们尽派一些松散的军队傻乎乎的冲进狼窝
who send their illprepared armies, clumsily, into the lair of the wolf.

1111
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:00,210
只有直面敌人 毫不退缩的勇士
And only zealous men, who stand steadfast in the face of the enemy

1112
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:02,900
才会被德国历史永远铭记
will be etched in German memory forever.

1113
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,860
由你自己来决定你是想被大家记住
And it is up to you to decide if you want to be remembered,

1114
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:10,170
还是想消失得无影无踪
or disappear without a trace,

1115
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:15,080
就像掉进无边沙漠的一粒尘埃
like a pitiful grain of sand into a dessert of insignificance.

1116
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,250
说白了
To put it plainly.

1117
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,130
镇定下来 分清轻重缓急
Get your shit together and sort out your priorities.

1118
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,130
你已经十岁了 乔乔
You're 10, Jojo.

1119
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:29,800
开始像样点
Start acting like it.

1120
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:43,000
你知道吗
Did you know?

1121
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,860
她没有告诉我太多事情
She didn't tell me much.

1122
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,600
只说她和朋友在一起工作
Only that she worked with her friends

1123
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,980
你的父亲某种程度也参与了
and your father was, somehow, involved from afar.

1124
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:54,770
不 他在战场上打仗
No, he's fighting in the war.

1125
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,740
她说战争结束了 他就会回家的
She said he'll be home as soon as the war is over.

1126
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:03,420
因为一些很明显的原因 她并不想告诉你一切
She didn't want to tell you anything for obvious reasons.

1127
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,060
因为她讨厌我
Because she hated me.

1128
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:10,750
因为我是纳粹 我是敌人
'Cause I'm a Nazi. I'm the enemy.

1129
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:13,920
她不想让你知道那些可能会让你陷入麻烦的事情
She didn't want you to know anything that could get you in trouble.

1130
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,650
但是我现在一无所有了
But now I have nothing.

1131
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,110
无依无靠
No one.

1132
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:27,090
我上一次见到我的父母亲还是在车站
The last time I saw my parents was at the station.

1133
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,600
他们被装上火车
They were put on the train.

1134
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:34,610
我跑了
I ran.

1135
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:37,950
慢慢的找回城的路
Slowly, found my way back to the city.

1136
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:41,050
我父亲的一个朋友把我藏起来
A friend of my father's hid me.

1137
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:43,420
然后另外一个朋友 朋友的朋友
Then, another friend, then friends of friends...

1138
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,810
直到你母亲把我带进来
Till your mother took me in.

1139
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:52,700
我在这里待到现在
And so far I am still here.

1140
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:59,400
但是我的父母亲去了一个不能回来的地方
But my parents went to a place you don't come back from.

1141
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:06,530
等你自由后 你想做的第一件事是什么
What's the first thing you'll do when you're free?

1142
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:11,400
跳舞

约克
Yorki?

1168
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:26,810
乔乔
Jojo!

1169
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:32,180
我的天
Oh God.

1170
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,610
乔乔 我想死你了
Jojo! Oh, I've missed you!

1171
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,510
为你妈妈的事情感到难过
Sorry about your mama.

1172
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,550
我听到这件事的时候哭了好久
I cried for ages, when I heard what happened.

1173
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,800
外面发生什么事了
What's going on out here?

1174
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,170
是俄罗斯人 乔乔 他们攻打过来了
The Russians, Jojo. They're coming.

1175
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:49,270
美国人从另外一边来了
And the Americans from the other way.

1176
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,810
还有英国 中国
And England, and China.

1177
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:54,440
非洲 印度 好多国家都来了
And Africa, and India. The whole world is coming.

1178
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:56,450
帮我推这些弹药
Help me with this ammo.

1179
01:24:58,130 --> 01:24:59,430
我们要怎么做
And how are we doing?

1180
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:02,110
真糟糕 我们的盟友只有日本人
Terribly. Our only friends are the Japanese.

1181
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:05,380
也就我俩才这么说 他们没有雅利安人那么优秀
And just between you and me, they don’t look very Aryan.

1182
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,110
你还记得那个犹太人吗 我跟你说过的那个
Remember that Jew, I told you about?

1183
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:09,720
嗯  我还和她在一起
Oh yeah.  I still have her.

1184
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,500
她现在算是我的女朋友了
She's, basically, my girlfriend now.

1185
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:14,330
噢 真为你高兴 乔乔 你有女朋友了
Oh, good for you, Jojo. A girlfriend.

1186
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:17,750
问题是 你懂得 她是犹太人
But, you know, she is Jewish.

1187
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,800
现在有比犹太人更需要担心的事情 乔乔
There are bigger things to worry about than Jews, Jojo.

1188
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:23,000
外面都是俄国人
There are Russians somewhere out there.

1189
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:24,810
他们比其他人都要可怕
They are worse than anyone.

1190
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,130
我听说他们吃小孩 和狗发生关系
I heard they eat babies and have sex with dogs.

1191
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:30,370
这很坏 不是吗
I mean, like, that's bad, right?

1192
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:31,860
和狗发生关系
Sex with dogs?

1193
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,940
是的 英国人也这样做
Yeah, the Englishmen do it too.

1194
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:37,430
我们得在他们吃掉我们和糟蹋掉所有的狗之前制止他们
We have to stop them before they eat us and screw all our dogs.

1195
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:41,580
真疯狂 希特勒死了 现在只能靠自己了
It's crazy. And now Hitler's gone. We're really on our own.

1196
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:44,870
什么
What?

1197
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:46,210
你没听说吗
You didn't hear?

1198
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:48,140
他死了
He's dead.

1199
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,620
他放弃反抗开枪自杀了
He gave up and blew his brains out.

1200
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:53,280
不 这不可能
No! That's impossible.

1201
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,770
对着脑袋开枪自杀的

01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,380
就喊一声 求你了
Just a little heil. Please.

1343
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,960
滚吧 希特勒
Fuck off, Hitler!

1344
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:01,660
走吧
Come on.

1345
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:06,110
噢 等一下
Oh, wait.

1346
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:22,650
准备好了吗
Ready?

1347
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:24,090
好了
Yeah.

1348
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:30,500
外面危险吗
Is it dangerous out there?

1349
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:36,150
极其危险
Extremely.

1350
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:37,250
我们成功了
We made it.

1351
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:43,620
我活该
Probably, deserved that.

1352
01:41:56,690 --> 01:41:58,280
