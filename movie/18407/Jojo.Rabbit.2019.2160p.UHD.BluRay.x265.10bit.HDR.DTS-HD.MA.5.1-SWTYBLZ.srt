87
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,540
欢迎来到希特勒少年队周末训练营
Jungvolk, welcome to the Hitlerjugend training weekend.

88
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,910
无论你是小伙子还是小姑娘 都会在这里得到成长
in which we will make men and women of you all.

89
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,750
我是Klenzendorf上校
My name is captain Klenzendorf.

90
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,650
你们也可以叫我K上校
You may call me captain K.

91
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,020
K上校
Captain K. whoo!

92
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,290
然后这位是Finkel军官
Ja. And this is sub-officer Finkel.

93
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,830
这位是Frulein Rahm
This is Frulein Rahm.

94
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,290
你们好 希特勒万岁
Hey. Heil Hitler, everyone.

95
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,700
先简单介绍一下我自己 我是谁
So a little about me. Who am I?

96
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,000
以及我为什么会
And why am I here talking to

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,270
和你们这群小家伙呆在这里
a bunch of littleo my superiors,

98
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,360
而不是在前线冲锋陷阵
Instead of leading my men into battle

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,230
直至光荣牺牲
towards glorious death.

100
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,110
好问题
Great question.

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,110
自从那次行动失败后 我一直在问自己一个问题
I've asked it myself every day since operation screw up

102
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,780
在那次不必要的敌袭中
Where I lost a perfectly good eye

103
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,780
我的另一只眼睛瞎了
in a totally preventable enemy attack?

104
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,400
当时我的长官跟我说
And according to my superiors,

105
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,220
只有健全的军人才有留在战场的价值
You need two eyes to be a meaningful part of the war effort.

106
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,720
但双眼健全的人能做到这个吗
Can two-eyed people do this?

107
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,100
- 天呐 - 接下来的两天
- Jesus. - Over the next two days,

108
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,920
你们这些小家伙将会
You little critters will get to

109
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,600
体验一些前线的德国士兵
experience some of the things

110
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,970
每天都在做的事情
that the mighty German army goes through every day.

111
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,350
虽然我们国家目前在战场上处于劣势
And even though it would appear our country's on a back foot

112
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,110
赢下这场战争的希望有些渺茫
And there really isn't much hope in us winning this war,

113
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,980
但显然 我们目前状况还不错
Apparently we're doing just fine.

114
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,130
不管怎么说 男孩子们现在
Anyway. You boys have all been issued

115
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,180
人手一把德意志少年队匕首
with your Deutsches Jungvolk Daggers.

116
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,590
这是一种特殊且昂贵的武器
These are very special and expensive weapons.

117
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,860
你们务必随身携带
You should never be without them.

118
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,860
但不要用匕首伤人
And don't try to stab each other.

119
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,990
不许用匕首伤人
No stabbing!

120
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,100
不许伤人
No stabbing.

121
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,770
这是你们成为男子汉的第一步
This is your first step towards being men.

122
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,630
今天男生们将进行一系列的军事训练
Today you boys will be involved in such activities

123
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,930
包括行军 刺刀演练 投掷手榴弹
as marching, bayonet drills, grenade-throwing,

124
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,390
挖战壕 阅读地图 防毒演习
trench-digging, map-reading, gas defense,

125
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,170
伪装 伏击
camouflage, ambush techniques,

126
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,840
战争演习 射击 爆破
war games, firing guns, and blowing stuff up.

127
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,620
女生们则要学会履行女性的职责
The girls will practice important womanly duties

128
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,320
比如说包扎伤口 铺床
Such as dressing wounds, making beds,

129
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,150
以及如何生孩子
And learning how to get pregnant.

130
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,720
我已经为国家诞下18个孩子
I've had 18 kids for Germany.

131
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,060
这年头做女人真好
Such a great year to be a girl.

132
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,300
那么 我们开始吧
All right. Let's get to it.

133
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,730
都动起来
Come on.

134
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
去吧
Go!

135
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,670
上帝保佑
God help me.

136

我觉得还好
Not to me.

174
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,050

00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,020
但你又怎么知道他是犹太人呢
But how would you know if you saw one?

177
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,460
他们和我们长得一样
They could look just like us.

178
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,520
他们头上有角

而且他们闻起来像球芽甘蓝
And they smell like Brussels sprouts.

180
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,800
哦对 我都忘了他们闻起来像球芽甘蓝了
Oh, yeah. I forgot about the Brussels sprouts bit.

181
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,100
想象一下 你抓到一个犹太人并把他献给希特勒大人
Imagine catching one and giving it to Hitler.

182
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,200
这样做一定能当上他的亲兵
That'd be a surefire way to get into his personal guards.

183
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,970
然后我们会成为最好的朋友
Then we would become best friends.

184
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,980
我难道不是你最好的朋友吗

Yorki 你排在第二位
Yorki, you're my second-best friend.

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,410
第一位是留给元首大人的
First place is reserved for the Fuhrer.

187
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,860
除非希特勒大人住在

188
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,820
你圆滚滚的身体里
hiding in a fat, little boy's body.

189
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,350
不然你就是第二名
I'd be happy with second place.

190
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,090
我想我就是个平平无奇的小胖子
I guess I'm just a kid in a fat kid's body.

191
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,790
那不就行了
Case closed.

192
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,440
如果敌人出现在你的面前 你需要去终结他的生命
When you stand before the enemy and have to end his life,

193
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,310
你们谁有胆量做这件事情
Which of you will have the stomach to do this?

194
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,080
很好
Good.

195
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,180
希特勒的军队里不需要
There is no room in Hitler's army

196
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,450
那些没勇气的懦夫
For those that lack strength.

197
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,020
我们只需要坚强的战士
We want hardened warriors.

198
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,890
时刻准备杀人为乐的战士
Those that are prepared to kill at will.

199
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,320
你们能做到吗

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,200
当然 我最喜欢杀生了
Of course. I love killing.

204
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,570
很好 过来

205
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,580
别害怕 快点过来
Don't be scared. Come on.

206
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,980
很好
Good.

207
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,360
杀了它
Kill it.

208
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,300
扭断它的脖子 杀了这只兔子
Wring its neck and kill the rabbit.

209
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,970
或者你不敢
Or are you scared?

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,600
我不是不敢 我只是
I'm not scared. I... i just...

211
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,410
现在动手
Now.

212
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,910
双手捏住它的脖子 用力一拧
Place both hands around its neck and then one hard twist.

213
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,410
也许叫声会有点惨
He might scream,

214
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,120
但我们会用靴子堵上它的嘴
but we'll just use the boot to finish it off.

215
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,460
杀了它 杀了它
Kill. kill.

216
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,960
杀了它 杀了它
Kill. kill.

217
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,130
杀了它 杀了它
Kill. kill.

218

219
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,130
杀了它 杀了它 杀了它

220
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,100
杀了它 杀了它 杀了它 杀了它 杀了它
Kill. kill. kill. kill. kill.

221
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,140
杀了它 杀了它 杀了它 杀了它 杀了它
Kill. kill. kill. kill. kill. kill.

222
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,940
快跑 快跑
Come on.

223
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,920
干得漂亮
Good shot.

224
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,050
你是个胆小鬼
You are a coward.

225
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,290
就像你爸一样
Just like your father.

226
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,490
我爸不是胆小鬼
He... he's not a coward.

227
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,530
- 他在意大利打仗 - 真的吗
- He's fighting in Italy. - Really?

228
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,430
但他这两年就像人间蒸发了一样
But no one has heard from him in two years.

229
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,260
他就是个临阵脱逃的胆小鬼
He is a deserting coward.

230
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,000
他害怕了 你也一样
He's scared and so are you.

231
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,440
你就像个小兔子一样胆小
You're as scared as a little rabbit.

232
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,310
受惊的的小兔子
Scared little rabbit.

233
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,950
也许我们也应该拧断你的脖子
Maybe we should snap your neck, too?

234
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,280
Jojo是只小兔子
Jojo the rabbit.

241
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,540
他们想让我杀了那只兔子

242
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
很抱歉 我做不到
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

243
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,020
别担心 没关系的
Don't worry about it. I couldn't care less.

244
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,990
但他们现在叫我受惊的小兔子
But now they call me a scared rabbit.

245
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,420
他们爱说什么说什么吧
Let them say whatever they want.

246
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,220
人们过去也总是说我坏话
People used to say a lot of nasty things about me.

247
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,760
这个家伙就是个疯子
"Oh, this guy's a lunatic."

248
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,730
看那个神经病 他会害死我们的
"Oh, look at that psycho. He's gonna get us all killed."

249

告诉你个小秘密
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

250

兔子并不胆小
The rabbit is not coward.

251
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,310
不起眼的小兔子每天都要面对这个险恶的世界
The humble little bunny faces a dangerous world every day,

252
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,740
但它们依旧为家人和国家寻找胡萝卜
Hunting carrots for his family, for his country.

253
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,410
我的帝国里有许多动物

257
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,020
还有勇猛的小兔子
Even the mighty rabbit.

258
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,120
来根烟吗
Cigarette?

259
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,030
不 谢了 我不抽烟

262
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,600
不起眼的小兔子总是以智取胜
The humble bunny can outwit all of his enemies.

263
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,770

265
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,070

没有谁
Nobody.

269
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,750
我还以为你在哭
Oh, I thought you were crying.

270
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,790
你是眼泪学家吗
Are you a teardrop specialist?

271
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,420
不是
No.

272
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,690
那不就行了
Case closed.

273
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,260
是时候告诉那些虫子们
Now, it's time for Jojo to show those stick insects

274
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,460
谁才是真正的胆小鬼了
Who is the real cowardly rabbit.

275

00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,320
把你这个纳粹头给砍下来
And cut your Nazi head off.

418
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,290
明白了吗
Got it?

419
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,400
明白
Ja.

420
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,910
我来保管这把刀 刀不错
I think I'll hold onto this. It's pretty.

421
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,950
好刺激
Sheesh. That was intense.

422
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,420
-我该怎么做 -说真的 不知道
- What am I going to do? - Honestly, no idea.

423
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,190
我是说 可能还有不少犹太人
I mean, there could be more of them.

424
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,190
你家墙后搞不定住了数百个
Hundreds of them living in your walls.

425
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,430
她怎么能够控制得了呢
How did she get control like that?

426
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,930
她肯定用了魔力
She must've used her powers.

427
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,000
精神控制
Mind control.

428
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,530
经典一套
Oh, typical.

429
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,000
-你看到她跑得多快嘛 -看到了
- Did you see how fast she moved? - Yes.

430
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,470
就像个年轻女犹太人版的杰西·欧文斯
Like a little, female Jewish Jesse Owens.

431
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,340
她还把你那把好刀给拿走了 -我的刀
- And now she's got your fancy knife. - My knife!

432
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,180
对 就像年轻犹太人版的杰西·欧文斯
Yeah. Like a little, female Jewish Jesse Owens,

433
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,050
开膛手杰克
Jack the ripper.

434
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,050
你遇到麻烦了 朋友
You're definitely in a pickle, my friend.

435
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,150
怎么办呢 该怎么办呢
Ah, what to do, what to do?

436
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,380
-有了 -有了
- Oh. Got it! - Got it!

437
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,930
-我去谈判 -把房子烧了
- I will negotiate. - Burn down the house

438
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,920
然后怪罪到温斯顿·丘吉尔身上
And blame Winston Churchill.

439
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,120
或是谈判
Or negotiate.

440
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,040
打扰一下
Excuse me?

441
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,840
小女孩
Little girl?

442
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,150
墙里的犹太女孩
Um... Jew girl in the wall?

443
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,550
有人吗 犹太人
Yoo-hoo. Jew?

444
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,450
好吧 我就开门见山地说吧
Okay,well,I'll just say what I have to say and that's this:

445
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,600
我并不怕你
I'm not scared of you and I think you

446
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,630
但我觉得你应该换个地方住
should find somewhere else to live.

447
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,900
好吗
Okay?

448
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,340
不好
Not okay.

449
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,280
滚出我的房间
Get the hell out of my room.

450
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,520
她还挺粗鲁的
She's pretty rude, you know?

451
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,150
那只是我的两芬尼(德国铜币)而已
That's just my two Pfennige.

452
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,690
-这下她有两把刀了 -我知道
-And now she's got two knives. - I know!

453
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,590
-你要怎么切东西呢 -我不知道
- How are you going to chop up stuff? - I don't know!

454
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,290
她还在楼上呢
Oh, and she's still up there, too.

455
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,930
那 那 那个
That... that thing, that, that...

456
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,530
-犹太人 -对 犹太人 没错
- Jew. - Yeah. Jew, yeah.

457
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,840
我们该拿那个犹太人
- What are we gonna do about that

458
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,010
-怎么办好呢 -你想想办法吧
Jew? - You think of something.

459
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,970
怎么 反倒我是专家了
Oh, now I'm the expert?

460
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,500
别再给我递那该死的烟了 我才十岁
Stop offering me damned cigarettes! I'm ten!

461
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,670
好吧 抱歉 我压力太大了
All right. Sorry. I'm stressed out!

462
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,210
好吧 那我们有话直说
Okay, let's talk like turkeys.

463
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,750
你不能告诉你母亲
You can't tell your mother or that

464
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,170
不然 那犹太人会把你这纳粹脑袋砍下来
Jew will cut of your Nazi head.

465
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,980
但是不能让阁楼里的那玩意儿
But there's no reason this thing in

466
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,710
毁掉你的生活
the attic needs to ruin your life.

467
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,610
事实上说 你可以利用这个
In fact, you could use it to your advantage.

468
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,150
怎么用
How?

469
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,220
有人要给我做精神控制时
When someone tries to use mind powers on me,

470
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,250
知道我怎么做吗
Know what I do?

471
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,990
反过来对他们做精神控制
Use mind powers back on them.

472
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,490
记得去年那个独臂冯·施陶芬贝格
Remember last year when that one-arm pirate von Stauffenberg

473
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,130
企图利用一个桌子下的炸弹炸死我的事吗
tried to blow me up with a table bomb?

474
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,230
没错 你活了下来
Yeah, you survived.

475
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,290
更正一下
Correctomundo.

476
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,600
唯一一个存活下来的理由
The only reason I survived,

477
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,400
除了防炸弹双腿之外
Apart from having bombproof legs,

478
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,070
我还智取了老施陶芬贝格
is because I outwitted old von Stauffy.

479
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,030
让他以为我死了
I let him think that I was dead, when

480
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,000
但事实上 我毫发无伤
in actual fact, I was absolutely fine.

481
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,270
通过装死 我除掉了所有的背叛者
By pretending I was dead, I drew out all the traitors.

482
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,510
那么你该怎么做呢
So what are you going to do?

483
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,140
假装我死了
Pretend I'm dead?

484
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,550
没错 等下 不对
Exactly. Wait, no.

485
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,380
不对 我意思是
No,what I mean is this:

486
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,350
先让她觉得安全了 然后她就会卸下防备
Make her feel safe and then she'll drop her guard

487
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,050
你就可以拿回主导权
And then you will be the one in control.

488
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,020
-逆反心理 -别把事情搞复杂了
- Reverse psychology. - Don't complicate things.

489
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,760
就用我的反向精神控制术
Just use my backwards mind power trick,

490
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,620
就水到渠成
and everything will be fine.

491
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,330
我该走了
Ooh! I gotta go.

492
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,400
我们今晚要吃独角兽
We're having unicorn for dinner at my place tonight.

493
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,730
要专心 Jojo
Concentrate, Jojo.

494
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,000
记住 有个犹太人住你家里
Remember, a Jew living in your wall

495
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,330
好过两只犹太人展开蝙蝠翅膀飞来飞去
is better than two Jews flying around with their bat wings,

496
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,540
从烟囱爬下来吃无辜的纳粹人
climbing down chimneys and eating innocent Nazis.

497
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,540
还有 别再给她刀了
And don't give her any more knives.

498
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,610
再见
Tschuss.

499
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,270
亲爱的宝贝 你怎么还没睡呢
Darling cub, why are you up, huh?

500
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,070
你吃过东西了吗
Did you eat anything, hmm?

501
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,340
抱歉 我忘记时间了
Sorry, I lost track of time.

502
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,170
我去散了步 然后
I was taking a long walk and having a thing...

503
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,280
该拿你这鞋带怎么办呢 我的天
What are we going to do with these laces, huh? My goodness.

504
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,280
你总要学会系鞋带的 是吧
You'll learn how to tie them eventually, no?

505
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,520
-我听到她的声音了 -什么
- I heard her. - What?

506
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,580
谁
Who?

507
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,150
Inge
Inge.

508
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,160
她的灵魂
Her ghost.

509
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,030
真为你感到悲伤
Oh. That's so sad for you.

510
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,530
你疯了
You've lost your mind.

511
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,830
虽然我更惨一点
It's sadder for me, though,

512
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,600
我还要和一个疯子住一起
Because I have to live with a crazy person.

513
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,570
我听到动静了 楼上的
I heard noises. Upstairs.

514
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,840
鬼吗 其实你知道我听到什么吗 老鼠声
Ghosts? Honestly, you know what I heard? rats.

515
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,840
没错 我们家里有老鼠 你相信吗
Yes, we have them. Can you believe that?

516
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,610
肮脏的动物
Dirty animals.

517
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,720
我一直都想跟你说 别去楼上
I've been meaning to tell you to stay away from upstairs,

518
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,480
在我打扫干净之前 好吗
Until I've cleared them all, okay?

519
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,350
我不想你生病
I don't need you getting sick.

520
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,420
好吧 妈妈
Okay, mama.

521
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,650
我会小心那些脏老鼠的
I'll watch out for those dirty rats.

522
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,060
那些该死的刀都到哪去了
Where are all the goddamn knives?

523
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,210
你也要上床睡觉了吗
Are you going to bed, too?

524
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,240
是的 很快了
Yes. soon.

525
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,380
我要先整理好东西再睡
I have to tidy some things first.

526
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,450
什么东西
What things?

527
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,520
妈妈的东西
Mama things.

528
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,660
孩子 你要相信我 好吗
Boy, you have to trust me, okay?

529
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,390
我是家里的老大 好吗
I'm the boss here, ja?

530
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,550
对吧
I guess.

531
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,220
好孩子
Good boy.

532
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,830
对的 但是要用一只眼 就像这样
Yes, but with... with one eye. like...

533
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,530
差不多
Almost.

534
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,360
还不算哦
Not quite.

535
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,600
很好 你学会了
Great. You got it.

536
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,670
对
Ja.

537
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,840
你得再安静点
You have to be more quiet.

538
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,450
他听到这里的动静了
He heard noises up here.

539
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,120
要是我必须在你和我儿子之间做选择的话 那我
If I have to choose between you and my son, I...

540
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,860
我都不知道该把你送到哪去
I won't know where to send you.

541
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,590
听到了吗
You hear me?

542
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,860
他不能知道 要是他知道了的话 他们就都知道了
He can't know. If he knows, then they know.

543
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,430
-你可以和他讲道理 -你并不了解他
- You could reason with him. - You don't know him.

544
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,140
他是个狂热分子
He's a fanatic.

545
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,250
他花了三周的时间才能接受
It took him three weeks to get over the fact

546
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,840
他外公不是金发的事情
That his grandfather was not blond.

547
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,740
我知道在他内心深处住着
I know he's in there somewhere.

548
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,680
一个喜欢玩耍 还是个奔向你
The little boy who loves to play and runs to you,

549
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,550
就因为害怕雷声的小男孩
because he's scared of thunder.

550
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,650
他还觉得是你发明了巧克力蛋糕
Thinks you invented chocolate cake.

551
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,450
到头来 这就是你所拥有的东西
In the end, that's all you have.

552
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,890
希望
Hope...

553
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,490
仅有的这个小孩不会是另一个鬼魂了
that your only remaining child is not just another ghost.

554
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,830
或许现在 我们都是鬼魂而不自知
Perhaps we're all ghosts now. We just don't know it.

555
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,370
也许吧
Perhaps.

556
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,600
你比多数人都活得久
You've lived more lifetimes than most.

557
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,180
我从来没活过
I haven't lived at all.

558
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,880
你被改变了
You're being challenged.

559
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,950
他们说你不能活 你就得死
They say you can't live, that you won't live.

560
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,720
要是这样的话 他们就得逞了
If that comes true, then they win.

561
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,190
目前为止 他们都在赢
They've been winning so far.

562
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,890
他们永远不会赢 这就是你所拥有的力量
They'll never win. That's the power you have.

563
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,730
只要在某个地方有人活着 他们就输了
As long as there's someone alive, somewhere, then they lose.

564
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,610
昨天今天他们都没抓到你
They didn't get you yesterday or today.

565
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,900
明天你也要一样活着
you make tomorrow the same.

566
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,470
嘿
Hey.

567
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,240
明天一定也要一样
Tomorrow must be the same.

568
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,440
我的天呀
Jesus christ!

569
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,800
你一定要拉拉筋
You must stretch.

570
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,010
弄疼你了吗
Does that hurt you?

571
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,640
-对 -很好 疼痛是你的朋友
- Yes. - Good. Pain is your friend.

572
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,510
很快你的腿只会变得
Soon your leg will only be

573
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,510
有点畸形 但没啥大问题
A little bit deformed and pointless.

574
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,950
我会建议你再休学多一个月
I'm going to recommend another month off school though

575
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,580
因为你的脸有可能会吓到其他小孩
Because your face might scare the other kids.

576
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,420
有点丑
It's kind of ugly.

577
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,450
好了 下一个到谁
Okay, who's next?

578
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,460
Jojo
Jojo.

579
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,790
宝贝 我得走了
Baby, I have to go.

580
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,330
我们家里见
I'll see you at home.

581
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,910
-你好 上尉K -嘿
- Hi, Captain K. -Hey.

582
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,350
这不是手榴弹先生吗
If it isn't herr hand grenade himself.

583
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,550
腿怎么样 孩子
How's the leg, kid?

584
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,350
好得差不多了
It's pretty much healed.

585
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,750
痛感降到80%了
It only 80% hurts now.

586
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,450
你们在做什么
What are you guys doing?

587
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,320
我要给希特勒青年营的孩子们
I'm being made to teach the HJ boys

588
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,090
上水战训练课
Water warfare training.

589
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,860
万一他们需要
You know, in case they ever need

590
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,760
在游泳池里战斗的话
to go to battle in a swimming pool.

591
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,500
我能问你一个关于犹太人的问题吗
Can I ask you a question about Jews?

592
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,570
天啊 为什么
Oh, god. Why?

593
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,700
要是我见到的话 我该怎么办呢
What should I do if I see one?

594
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,840
好吧
Ugh. Okay.

595
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,610
要是你见到犹太人的话 告诉我们
If you see a Jew, you tell us,

596
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,710
我们告诉盖世太保 他们会告诉党卫军
We tell the gestapo, and they tell the SS,

597
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,450
他们就会把那犹太人给枪毙了
And then they go and they kill the Jew.

598
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,520
还有任何一个帮助犹太人的人都会被杀
And anyone who helped the Jew.

599
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,350
而且因为现在是非常时期
And because these are very paranoid times,

600
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,350
宁可错杀一千 也不放过一个
Probably some other people just in case.

601
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,850
这是一个旷日持久的过程
It's a pretty drawn out process.

602
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:31,490
即使是那犹太人催眠别人在先
Even if the Jew hypnotized someone

603
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,460
为了让别人能够把自己藏起来
to make them hide the Jew in the first place?

604
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,990
要是真的话 我肯定很惊讶
I'd be amazed if that could happen.

605
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,600
不对 是真的
No, it can happen.

606
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,800
我舅舅就是这情况
It happened to my uncle.

607
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,510
有个犹太人催眠了他
A Jew hypnotized him

608
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,510
他变成了酒鬼和赌鬼
And he became a massive drunk and a gambler.

609
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,110
他还欺骗了自己的妻子
And he cheated on his wife

610
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,750
他还和我妹妹有不正当关系
And he had an inappropriate relationship with my sister.

611
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,750
然后他就在一场无关的事故中溺死了
And then he drowned in an unrelated accident,

612
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,020
但那是犹太人的错
But it was the Jew's fault.

613
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,590
总之 你见到犹太人了吗
Anyway. Did you see one? A Jew.

614
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,880
我不确定能否
-I'm not sure I'd be able to tell

615
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,490
-分辨得出犹太人 -对 我也不能
if I did. -Yeah, me neither.

616
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,600
要是没有他们那些好笑的帽子 几乎分辨不了
Without their funny hats, it's damn near impossible.

617
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,800
有人应该要写写关于这话题的书
Someone should write a book on the subject.

618
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,470
这样才能让人好分辨
It would make things so much easier.

619
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,400
-肯定会大卖的 -没错
- It would be a hit. - Ja.

620
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,070
Finkie 他们溺水了 快点
Finkie, they're drowning. Come on.

621
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,680
回头见 小孩
I'll see you later, little man.

622
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,060
好 情况是这样的
Okay, here's the situation.

623
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:47,070
要是我告发你 你就有大麻烦了
If I tell on you, you'll be in big trouble,

624
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,200
我猜你也不想那样
And I don't think you want that.

625
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,690
但接着你又告发我和我妈妈
But then you'll tell on me and my

626
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,110
我们也会有麻烦
mother, and we will be in trouble

627
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,940
那这也不是我想要的结果
which I don't want.

628
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,440
要是你告诉我妈说我知道这件事的话 她会把你赶出去
And if you tell my mother I know, then she'll kick you out,

629
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,110
这不是你想要的结果
which you don't want.

630
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,880
要是我自己告诉我妈说我知道这件事
And if I tell my mother I know,

631
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,780
那么你就会把我这纳粹头砍下来
Then you'll cut off my Nazi head,

632
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,720
这也不是我想要的结果
which I also don't want.

633
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,520
所以这是个墨西哥僵局
So, it's a Mexican stalemate.

634
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,590
这只是普通的僵局而已
It's just a normal stalemate.

635
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,960
我允许你留在这里 但有几个条件
I have some conditions for allowing you to stay here.

636
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,800
-条件 -是的
- "conditions?" - Yes.

637
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,430
把所有关于犹太人的事都告诉我吧
Tell me everything about the Jewish race.

638
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:21,970
好吧
Okay.

639
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,940
我们就像你们一样
We're like you,

640
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,740
但我们是人
But human.

641
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,940
请严肃对待
Please take this seriously.

642
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,210
把这个当作是揭秘吧
Think of this as an expose.

643
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,080
我想知道你所有的秘密
I want to know all your secrets.

644
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,580
请不要坐在我姐姐的床上
Kindly refrain from sitting on my sister's bed.

645
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,820
怎么了 你姐姐又不需要了
Why? she doesn't need it.

646
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,890
你对我姐姐一无所知
You know nothing of my sister.

647
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,190
Inge和我是朋友
Inge and I were friends.

648
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,730
我记得你
I remember you.

649
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,830
有趣的小男孩
Such a funny little boy.

650
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,900
闲聊就到此为止吧
Enough with the small talk.

651
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,030
跟我说说你们那种人
Start telling me about your kind.

652
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,200
显然 我们是爱钱的魔鬼
Obviously, we are demons who love money.

653
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,540
对吗
Right?

654
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,640
显然 是个人都知道
Obviously. everyone knows that.

655
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,590
但人们不知道的是
But what people don't know is

656
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,780
我们对食物过敏
that we're also allergic to food

657
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,250
奶酪 面包 肉
Cheese, bread, meat.

658
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,980
那些东西会立刻让我们死掉
That stuff will kill us instantly.

659
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,820
所以 如果你考虑杀了我
So, if you're thinking of ending my life,

660
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,690
那是最快的办法
That's the fastest way.

661
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,490
还有饼干 超致命
Also biscuits, lethal.

662
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,660
非常有趣
Very funny.

663
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,090
总之 没有多少食物给你
Anyway, there's not enough food for you,

664
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,730
我也不知道你要干嘛
So i don't know what you're going to do.

665
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,670
你妈妈想办法给我找了些面包
Your mother managed to find me some bread.

666
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,940
她很好 她把我当个人
She's kind. she treats me like a person.

667
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,070
但你不是 不完全是人
But you're not. not a proper person.

668
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,610
那你是吗
Are you?

669
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,940
你胆子不小啊 犹太人
How dare you, jew!

670
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,610
你就像睫毛一样脆弱
You are weak like an eyelash.

671
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,550
我生来就是雅利安人血统
I am born of Aryan ancestry.

672
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,120
血液如玫瑰那般鲜红
My blood is the color of a pure red rose.

673
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,920
我的眼睛蓝的像
And my eyes are blue like...

674
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,660
挣脱啊
Break free.

675
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,660
挣脱我 伟大的雅利安人 没有脆弱的犹太人
Break free, great Aryan. there are no weak jews.

676
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,830
我继承的是
I am descended from those who

677
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,570
战斗天使 杀戮巨人的血统
wrestle angels and kill giant.

678
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
我们是天选之子
We were chosen by god.

679
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,570
而你们 可怜的人类才选你们
You were chosen by a pathetic little man

680
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,570
你甚至胡子都长不全
Who can't even grow a full mustache.

681
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,940
更强的种族是吗
The stronger race, huh?

682
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:22,660
楼上那个犹太的什么东西怎么样了
So, how's it all going with that jew thing upstairs?

683
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,720
她不想和我说话
Well, she doesn't want to talk to me.

684
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,790
嗯 好吧 你是个纳粹
Mm-hmm. Well, you are a Nazi.

685
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,590
可能吧
I guess.

686
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,060
这本书比我想象的难写
This book is going to be harder to write than I thought.

687
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,930
嗯
Hmm.

688
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,870
她在做什么 她在烧东西
What's she doing? she's burning something.

689
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,610
她在烧什么
What is she burning?

690
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,980
你在烧什么 她听不见你喊
- what are you burning? - she can't hear you.

691
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,840
你在烧什么
What are you burning?

692
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,690
怎么这么高兴
Why so happy?

693
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,030
局势在变了
Things are changing.

694
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,660
盟军占领了意大利

我们越早恢复和平越好

我们会把敌人碾碎成粉

等他们灭亡了

704
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,050
我们就把他们的坟墓当厕所用

当一个没有目标的畸形小孩

你不畸形

我这脸看着像一张傻逼街道图 女人
My face looks like a goddamn street map, woman.

720
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,450
我没指望着你能明白
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

721
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,050
如果我父亲在这儿 他会懂的
If my father were here, he'd get it.

722
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,880
可是 他不在

对不起孩子
Sorry, kid.

739
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,860

你们都在哪儿吃饭睡觉
Where you all eat, sleep,

758
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,570
犹太女王在那儿产卵
And where the queen jew lays the eggs.

759
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,540
你真是个白痴

但你没有特权知道我的家庭

去战场了 看
Fighting in the resistance, see.

774
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,400
他在河岸边向我求婚了
He proposed to me on the banks of the Fluce.

775
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,010
他像个有礼的绅士一样下跪
He knelt down like a proper gentleman,

776
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,640
嘴里还吟着Rikle的诗

我说好 我们一直跳舞到晚上

779

He's coming to rescue me, then we'll go live in Paris.

783
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,590
你要永远背叛德国吗
You'd turn your back on Germany forever?

784
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,720
它先背叛我的

785

我们不需要你

你和你的傻男朋友可以闭嘴了
You and your stupid boyfriend can shut up

788
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,370
只是因为你没有女朋友

我没空找女朋友

总有一天你会有时间的

你满脑子只有她

假的地板 你就会直直地摔下去

摔进满池子的水虎鱼

Let's get a book and let's go. Libraries are dumb.

811

是啊 真是个好主意
Yeah, this is a really good idea,

812
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,680
我们现在做什么呢
what we're doing right now.

813
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:05,390
如果她有心 这会让她的心碎成两半的
If she had a heart, this would break it clean in two.

814
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:10,090
我有话跟你说

我找到了一封Nathan的旧信

你未婚夫 寄给你的

- What the hell are you talking about? - I'll just read it.

818
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,070
亲爱的Elsa 很难开口
"Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say,

819
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,640
但我不想娶你了
"but I don't want to marry you anymore.

820
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,310
我认识了新的女人 我们一起笑
"I found a new woman and we laugh a lot

821
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,150
还有舌吻
"and do the tongue-kiss.

822
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,580
就像我最爱的诗人里尔克说的
"It's like my favorite poet, Rilke, says,

823
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,000
在爱里 我们只需要练习
We need, in love, to practice only this

824
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,650
放对方走
Letting each other go.'

825
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,090
所以 再见 抱歉让你走
"so, goodbye and sorry about letting you go.

826
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,730
Nathan 你的前未婚夫
"From Nathan, your ex-fiance.

827
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,200
注 我并没有去打仗
"ps, I'm not really in the resistance.

828
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,360
我说谎了
"I was lying.

829
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,070
我失业了而且现在很胖
I'm unemployed and quite fat now."

830
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,900
嗯 别打开门

实际上我忘了还有第二封信
But I actually forgot there was a second letter.

832
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:32,510

好多女孩都那么做过
"which a couple of girls have done in the past,

838
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,750
让我很有压力

839
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,690
我需要你活着
"i need you to stay alive.

谢天谢地那个小孩把你照顾得挺好的
"thank god you're being taken care of by that kid

841
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:54,430

"who I must say is a remarkable young man beyond his years.

我们以后还是结婚吧
"and let's still get married sometime,

844
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,800
即使我真的失业了
"even though I am truly unemployed

845
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,530
也没事做
"and have nothing going on for me.

你现在说的净是古老的名字

啊 原来河岸上都是情侣们

870

没时间浪漫
There's no time for romance.

我们在打仗
We're at war.

873
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,500
哦 什么时候都能浪漫
Oh. there's always time for romance.

874
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,710
以后你会遇见一个意中人

875
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,840
为什么所有人都跟我说这些

876

还有谁跟你说了
Who else tells you that?

877
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,310
所有人
Everyone.

878
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,620
总之
Anyway.

879
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:24,920
那想法挺傻的
It's a stupid idea.

880
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:27,720
你才傻
You're stupid.

881
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,260
爱是世界上最强大的
Love is the strongest thing in the world.

882
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:31,920
我觉得你会发现金属才是
I think you'll find that metal is

883
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:33,560
世界上最强大的
the strongest thing in this world

884
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:36,400
接着是炸药 然后是肌肉
Followed closely by dynamite, and then muscles.

885
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,500
不过 爱到我面前我可能都不知道
Besides, I wouldn't even know it if I saw it.

886
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,600
天呀
Surprise, surprise.

887
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,570
你鞋带又开了
Your shoelaces are undone again.

888
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,970
哦 Jojo
Oh, Jojo.

889
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,910
它出现的时候你会知道的
You'll know when it happens.

890
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,850
你会感受到它
You'll feel it.

891
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,980
它是一种疼痛
It's a pain.

892
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:56,580
-在我屁股里 -在你肚子里
- in my arse, I bet. - In your tummy.

893
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,250
就像 就像 里面全是蝴蝶
Like, like, you're full of butterflies.

894
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,020
-呕 -是啊 呕
- Yuck. - Yeah, "yuck."

895
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,790
来吧 小希特勒 该走了
Come on, Shitler. let's get a move on.

896
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,790
啊
Whoa!

897
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:10,700
-嘿 -你怎么了
- Hey! - What's wrong with you?

898
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:13,830
我很担心你啊兄弟 你醉了吗 又一次吗
I'm worried about you, man. Are you drunk? Again?

899
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,300
喂 哦 天啊
Come on. oh, god.

900
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,040
你能帮我解开它们吗
Could you please untie them?

901
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:19,400
-你确实长胖了 -我没有
- You're really getting fat. - I'm not...

902
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,870
你知道吗 要不我直接把你留在这儿吧 怎么样
You know what? why don't I just leave you here, okay?

903
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,680
-不 -我明天来接你
- No. - I'll come and get you tomorrow.

904
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,440
-好吗 怎么样 -不 妈妈 妈妈
- Okay? How about that? - No. mama, mama!

905
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,710
你可以解决的 亲爱的
You'll figure it out, darling.

906
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,380
-不 -我先回家等你
- No! - I'll meet you back at the house.

907
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,620
-明早见 -妈妈 妈妈
- I'll see you tomorrow morning. - Mama, mama!

908
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,990
你长得太快了
You're growing up too fast.

909
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,330
十岁不该庆祝战争
Ten-year-olds shouldn't be celebrating war

910
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,860
谈论政治
and talking politics

911
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,660
你该去爬树
You should be climbing trees

912
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,860
然后从树上掉下来
And then falling out of those trees.

913
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,800
但元首说我们胜利的时候
But the Fuhrer says when we win

914
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:46,630
就是我们 年轻的男孩将统治世界
It is us, young boys who will rule the world.

915
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,700
噗
Pfft!

916
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,700
德国在走向灭亡
The Reich is dying.

917
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,970
我们会战败
We're going to lose the war

918
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,610
之后你将做什么 嗯
And then what are you going to do, hmm?

919
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,010
生活是一份礼物
Life is a gift.

920
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,580
我们得庆祝
We must celebrate it.

921
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:02,880
我们要跳舞 感激我们还活着
We have to dance to show god we are grateful to be alive.

922
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,420
我不会跳的
Well, I won't dance.

923
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,630
没工作的人才跳舞
Dancing is for people who don't have a job.

924
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,660
自由的人才跳舞
Dancing is for people who are free.

925
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,600
让人们从这一切中逃离
It's an escape from all this.

926
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,470
那 你自己跳吧 跳舞回家
Well, you're free to dance your way home.

927
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,970
我骑车走
I'll ride.

928
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,100
哦不 你不能
Oh, no, you don't.

929
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,770
没人能阻止我
No one can stop me.

930
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:36,240
#妈妈 我亲爱的妈妈#
#Mama ich rufe dich an oh Mama#

931
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,020
#终有那么一天#
#Doch einst kommt der Tag#

932
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,900
#我会告诉你#
#Wo ich Dir sag#

933
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,610
#我已成为 男子汉#
#Ich bin ein grosser Mann#

934
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,020
{\an8}欢迎回家 男孩们
Welcome home, boys!

935
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,960
现在 回家亲亲你们的妈妈
Now, go home and kiss your mothers!

936
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:53,450
#你可以放心#
#Und ruche dich aus#

937
00:52:53,450 --> 00:53:01,300
#你已为我付出太多#
#Du hast schon genug getan#

938
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,580
恐怕今天没有Nathan的消息
No news from Nathan today, I'm afraid.

939
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,680
他可能在做什么神奇的事
He's probably doing something amazing,

940
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,890
比如读书或者长长胡子
Like reading a book or growing a beard.

941
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,760
怎么了
What's wrong?

942
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,530
你想让我告诉你犹太人的事
You want me to tell you about the jews?

943
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,500
不感兴趣
Don't care.

944
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,740
一开始 我们常住在山洞里
In the beginning, we used to live in caves.

945
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,770
-很深很深 在地球中心 -等下
- Deep, deep in the center of the earth. - Wait.

946
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,780
吓人的地方 满是奇异的生物
Scary places full of strange and wonderful creatures

947
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,450
但都有一个共同点
All with one thing in common.

948
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,680
嗯 偷小鸡鸡的把儿
Mm-hmm. Stealing the ends of penises?

949
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,650
不是 你个傻子
No, you idiot.

950
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,050
-对艺术的爱 -不把小鸡鸡切下来吗
- The love of art. - No cutting penises off?

951
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,520
你到底还听不听
Do you want the story or not?

952
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,860
你继续 但我知道那是真的
You may continue, but I know it's true.

953
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,060
小鸡鸡的事
The penis thing.

954
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,030
拉比用它们当耳塞
Rabbis use them for earplugs.

955
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,830
你继续
And moving on.

956
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,200
在研究了多年的魔法之后
After many years of developing magic and spells,

957
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,230
我们慢慢走出了山洞 搬进了城镇
We slowly moved out of the caves and into the towns.

958
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,840
有些人仍然保持着动物之身 住在山洞里
Some of us stayed in the caves, though, in animal bodies.

959
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:08,670
就像黏菌怪吗
Which are blobs or something?

960
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,210
我画出来给你看
Well, I'll draw them for you.

961
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:24,920
像这样
There.

962
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,590
上色后会更好看
It'd be better with color.

963
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,090
它的犄角呢
Where's the horns?

964
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,160
在毛发下面
Under the hair.

965
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,130
你的角呢
Where's yours?

966
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,730
我还小
I'm too young.

967
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,640
我们到21岁的时候 才会长出角来
They grow when you turn 21.

968
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,110
现在 我们和正常人一起生活
These days we live among normal people,

969
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,270
但通常我们会霸占一间房屋
But often we take over a house

970
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,940
倒挂在天花板上睡觉
And hang from the ceiling when we sleep.

971
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,150
就像蝙蝠一样
Like bats.

972
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,850
还有
Oh, and another thing is

973
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,250
我们会读心术
We can read each other's minds.

974
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,150

每个人的心都可以吗

- 能读懂德国人的心思吗 - 不能

977
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,990
他们的头皮太厚了 我们无法进去
Their heads are too thick for us to penetrate.

978
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:03,700
我们和鸟一样 说话就像在歌唱
Like birds, our true language sounds like singing.

979
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,630
我们也会被闪闪发光的东西所吸引

犹太人喜欢丑陋的东西
Jews love ugliness.

984
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,020
这是我们在学校学到的
That's another thing we learned at school.

985
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:27,090
你也喜欢丑陋的东西 对吗

让我很不安
It's making me feel very uncomfortable.

995
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:54,880

Besides, it's for the book.

999
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,850
天呐 你说得对
Oh, god, you're right.

1000
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,390
抱歉 我是不是让事情变得尴尬了
I'm sorry. did I make it weird?

1001
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:05,990
现在就很尴尬了 不是吗
It's weird now, isn't it?

1002
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,090
我们之间不应该尴尬的
It shouldn't be weird between us.

1003
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,900
这一切都不应该这么尴尬的

1110
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,640
它能发出扰人的音乐让敌人失去战力
Which emits annoying music to dishearten the enemy.

1111
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,580
这都有版权
This is all copyrighted, by the way.

1112
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:25,980
意思就是 你不能抄袭
That means you can't copy it.

1113
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,110
对 小朋友 别抄我的
Yea. Don't get any ideas, kid.

1114
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,550
那些小朋友告诉我 你父亲远在战场
The kids tell me that your father's away fighting.

1115
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:36,520
看来你是家里唯一的男人了 一切都好吗
So it appears you are now the man of the house. How's that going?

1116
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,960
还好
It's okay.

1117
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,660
是吗
Yea?

1118
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:43,530
那今天你要给我派什么任务
So, what jobs do you have for me today?

1119
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,200
不瞒你说 确实有一个
Well, I've got one, I won't lie.

1120
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,270
不过比你之前做的要简单一点
It's a bit of a step down from what you're used to,

1121
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,940
但我们现在需要所有人齐心协力
But we need all hands on deck right now.

1122
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,440
为希特勒贡献金属吧
Metal for Hitler!

1123
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:56,470
为战争而努力贡献锅碗瓢盆
Pots and pans for the war effort!

1124
01:01:56,470 --> 01:02:01,510
金属人满街跑 只为锅碗瓢盆倒
Here comes the metal man. Looking for your pots and pans.

1125
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,510
为希特勒贡献金属吧
Metal for Hitler!

1126
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,220
螺母和螺栓
Nuts and bolts!

1127
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,450
锅碗瓢盆
Pots and pans!

1128
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:31,210
解放德意志
"free Germany."

1129
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,620
Jojo
Jojo?

1130
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,020
- Yorki - 嗨
- Yorki? - hi!

1131
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,020
你现在是个士兵了
You're a soldier now?

1132
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,560
为人民服务
At your service.

1133
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,390
可你才十一岁
But you're only 11.

1134
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:50,630
我知道
I know.

1135
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,560
- 我能看看吗 - 当然
- may I? - Yeah, sure.

1136
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,170
这是纸做的吗
Is that paper?

1137
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:58,240
我一开始也这么觉得 但只是像纸张而已
That's what I thought at first, too, but it's "paper-like."

1138
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:02,040
其实是我们顶尖的科学家最新发明的
It's the latest material Invented by our top scientists.

1139
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,410
哇 好厉害
Well, I'm impressed.

1140
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,410
嘿 Yorki
Hey, Yorki.

1141
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,180
我抓到了个犹太人 真人
I caught a jew. A real one.

1142
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,680
一个犹太人
Oh, a jew?

1143
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,320
上个月我看到有人抓到
I saw some that they caught

1144
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,150
在森林里藏着的犹太人
Hiding in the forest last month.

1145
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:17,660
我不觉得有什么好小题大做的
Personally, I didn't see what all the fuss was about.

1146
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,530
他们一点儿都不可怕 而且很正常
They weren't at all scary and seemed kind of normal.

1147
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,400
我要找不到路了
Oh, I'm getting distracted.

1148
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:25,230
我得走了
I got to go.

1149
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,630
拜拜
Bye.

1150
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,130
- 拜拜 - 天呐
- bye. - oh, my god.

1151
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:30,070
穿着这身跑起来真难
It's so hard to run in this thing.

1152
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:37,170
我找到了这些
I found these.

1153
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:41,350
你拿着吧 可能都是坏的
You can have them. they're probably broken.

1154
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:43,350
不代表什么
Doesn't mean anything.

1155
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,480
也许你能为我的书画点什么
Maybe you can draw something for my book.

1156
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:49,750
我可以再画画你
I could draw you again.

1157
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,090
没人想看残废人的样子
No one wants to see pictures of cripples.

1158
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,390
你根本不是残废
You're hardly a cripple.

1159
01:03:56,830 --> 01:04:00,600
而且 真正的艺术家从来不看这些
Besides, true artists don't see that stuff.

1160
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,170
你是说盲人画家吗
Blind artists, you mean.

1161
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:04,570
没事的
It's fine.

1162
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,770
变成那种永远吻不到女孩的男人
I'll just accept I'll be one of those guys

1163
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,370
我能接受
Who'll never get to kiss a girl.

1164
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,910
Jojo 会有女孩吻你的
You will be kissed, Jojo.

1165
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,550
你想让我吻你吗
Do you want me to kiss you?

1166
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,220
好了
Okay.

1167
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,190
两件事
Two things.

1168
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,490
第一
Thing number one.

1169
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:25,660
纳粹和犹太人 像我们这样一起玩是非法的
It's illegal for Nazis and jews to hang out like we do,

1170
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,390
更别说接吻了
Let alone kiss.

1171
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,390
第二
Thing number two.

1172
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:33,330
出于同情的吻 根本不算
It'd just be a sympathy kiss, which doesn't count.

1173
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,100
你不是纳粹
You're not a Nazi.

1174
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,670
我超级喜欢万字符
Uh, I'm massively into swastikas,

1175
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,740
我觉得已经很明显了
So I think that's a pretty good sign right there.

1176
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:42,770
Jojo 你不是纳粹
You're not a Nazi, Jojo.

1177
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:46,510
你只是一个喜欢万字符的十岁男孩
You're a ten-year-old kid who likes swastikas

1178
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,350
还喜欢穿奇怪的制服
And likes dressing up in a funny uniform

1179
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,580
希望成为团队的一员
And wants to be part of a club.

1180
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,650
但你不是他们
But you are not one of them.

1181
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,350
行吧
Okay.

1182
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,090
我们求同存异
Let's just agree to disagree.

1183
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,360
可以了吗
All right?

1184
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,430
不是纳粹
"not a Nazi."

1185
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,730
真是个脏脏的犹太人
What a dirty jew.

1186
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:58,480
快点 藏起来
Come on. hide.

1187
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,550
快点 走吧
Hurry. go.

1188
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:07,730
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

1189
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:09,960
请让我自我介绍一下
Allow me to introduce myself.

1190
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,760
我是法尔肯海姆秘密警察的队长 Herman Deertz
I'm captain Herman Deertz of the Falkenheim gestapo.

1191
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,200
与我同行的是 Mueller先生 Junker先生
With me, Herr Mueller, Herr Junker,

1192
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,770
Kum先生 和Frosch先生 我们可以进来吗
Herr Kum and Herr Frosch. May we come in?

1193
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:21,240
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

1214
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,860
我错过什么了吗
So, did I miss anything?

1215
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:19,630
没有 我们刚刚和小朋友问了希特勒好
No, no. We were just " heil Hitlering" the boy

1216
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,940
跟你问了希特勒好
And then " heil Hitlering" yourself

1217
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,500
然后跟Freddy Finkel问了希特勒好
And then, of course, " heil Hitlering" Freddy Finkel

1218
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:27,510
我们现在就是例行检查
And now we are in the midst of a routine inspection.

1219
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,670
队长 哪阵风把你吹来了
And, uh, what brings you here, Captain?

1220
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,610
我们只是路过
Oh, we were just passing by

1221
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,750
想着给小朋友发放一些小册子
And we thought we'd drop off some pamphlets for the boy.

1222
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,380
他是在我们手下工作的
He works for us.

1223
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:40,920
- 这样啊 - 是的
- I see. - Yea.

1224
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:43,690
- 你最近怎么样 - 你懂的
- And yourself? - Oh, you know how it is.

1225
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:46,590
每天都要接电话 你好 请问是秘密警察吗
Every day we take a call. "Hello, is that the gestapo?

1226
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:49,630
我家冰箱后面藏着个共产党人
I believe there's a communist hiding behind my fridge."

1227
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,000
然后我们去调查 就只是个模型
We go around to investigate. It's just some mold.

1228
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:53,800
所以 还好吧
So, not far off.

1229
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,000
工作就是这样
It's all part of the job.

1230
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:03,540
这就是我喜欢的那种小男孩的卧室
Now this is my kind of little boy's bedroom.

1231
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,680
太棒了
Oh, yes.

1232
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:06,850
你在这儿呢
There he is.

1233
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,880
你和小伙伴们可能听过谣言说
You and your friends may have heard a rumor

1234
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,320
希特勒只有一个蛋蛋
That hitler only has one ball.

1235
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:11,580
那都是胡说八道
This is nonsense.

1236
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,390
他有四个
He has four.

1237
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:18,320
你在希特勒青少年办公室当志愿者 是吗
So, you are volunteering at the Hitlerjugend office, yes?

1238
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:20,020
是的
Yes.

1239
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,760
真棒
Oh, good for you.

1240
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:25,600
我希望有更多男孩像你一样盲目狂热
I wish more of our young boys had your blind fanaticism.

1241
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,930
这些呆瓜在干什么
What on earth are those oafs up to?

1242
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,600
要不我们上楼看看吧
Why don't we go upstairs and see, yes?

1243
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,010
你知道你妈妈在哪吗
Do you know where your mother is?

1244
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:44,080
不知道 她应该在镇上

对政权的忠诚度了
To myself and the party.

1361

证据在哪里

1363
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,170
德国军官都是因需要而生

Despite the futile efforts of allied war profiteers

1367
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,820
他们就知道把没做好准备的蠢货
Who send their ill-prepared armies

1368
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:56,350
傻乎乎一窝蜂的送进狼窝
clumsily into the layer of the roof

1369

只有那些热诚的

1370
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:00,220
面对敌人依旧怀揣着坚定信念的人

1371
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:03,550
才会被深深烙印在德国人的记忆里

由你来决定 究竟是想被人铭记
And it is up to you to decide if you want to be remembered,

1373
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:10,290
还是不留一丝痕迹的逝去
Or disappear without a trace

1374
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,290
就像一粒渺小至极的沙子
Like a pitiful grain of sand

1375
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:14,530
落入无边荒漠
into a desert of being significance

1376
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:21,010
也就是说
To put it plainly...

1377
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,980
振作起来 确定你的首要任务
Get your shit together and sort out your priorities.

1378
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:27,810
你已经十岁了Jojo

表现像样一点
Start acting like it.

1380
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:13,450

01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:42,770
你知道吗
Did you know?

1382
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:45,470
她没有跟我说太多

She didn't want to tell you anything for obvious reasons.

1388
