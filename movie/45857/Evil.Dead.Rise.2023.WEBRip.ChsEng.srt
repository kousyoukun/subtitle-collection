1
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,040
搞什么啊 迦勒？
What the fuck, Caleb?

2
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,800
等着看我拍到的镜头吧
Oh, wait till you see the shot I got.

3
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,110
你看上去像是屎都被吓出来了
You looked like you were gonna shit a brick out sideways.

4
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,940
你差点把我的脑袋削掉
You could have taken my head off.

5
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,660
那些螺旋桨太钝 削不利落的
It wouldn't have been a clean decapitation with these blades.

6
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,010
顶多是把你的脸削个稀烂
You'd just scramble your face up real good.

7
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,160
难道你不该去看看 洁西卡好点了没有吗？
Shouldn't you go see if Jessica is feeling any better?

8
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,090
她会没事的 我给了她一粒镇静药
She'll be fine. I gave her Klonopin

9
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,230
不管她哪里不舒服 睡醒后就会好了
so she can sleep off whatever the fuck is wrong with her.

10
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,230
那妞真是麻烦
Girl is such a pain in the ass.

11
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,290
洁西卡？
Jessica?

12
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,510
嘿
Hey.

13
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,970
表姐 你好点了吗？
How you feeling, cuz?

14
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,020
既然你们其他那些朋友都没来
Since none of these other friends of yours bothered to show up,

15
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,890
我能借你的车逃离这里 免得跟你的新男友困在一起
can I take your car and escape the hell of being stuck here

16
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,990
受地狱般的煎熬吗？
with your latest boyfriend?

17
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,890
聊得真愉快
Great chat.

18
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,670
你最好在接下来的半小时内醒过来
You better wake up in the next half hour

19
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,890
否则我就不得不 淹死那个无脑的可怜虫了
or I'm gonna be forced to go drown that brainless meat puppet's sorry ass.

20
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,770
(艾米莉勃朗特 《呼啸山庄》)

21
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,580
(“让我进去!”)

22
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,280
“噩梦般强烈的恐惧笼罩着我
"The intense horror of my nightmare came over me."

23
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,800
我试图缩回我的手臂 但那只手紧紧抓住了它
"I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung on

24
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,580
接着一个最忧郁的声音开始抽泣
and a most melancholy voice sobbed,

25
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,960
'让我进去
'Let me in.'"

26
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,290
让我进去！'
"'Let me in!'"

27
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,730
伴随着呼喊声 我模糊地辨认出
"As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely

28
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,160
一张孩子的脸正透过窗户往里看
a child's face looking through the window."

29
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,110
我发现光靠挣扎无法摆脱那怪物
"Finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off,

30
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,270
于是就把它的手腕 往碎玻璃那里拉…”
I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane…"

31
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,970
洁西？
Jess?

32
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,450
-“…然后来回摩擦…” -请别再背了
-"…and rubbed it to and fro…" -Please shut up.

33
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,540
“…直到鲜血流下来 浸湿了床单
"…till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes."

34
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,950
但它仍在哀号着：'让我进去！'”
"Yet still it wailed,  'Let me in!'"

35
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,420
洁西卡！
Jessica!

36
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,910
糟糕！
Shit, shit, shit!

37
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,340
见鬼！
Shit, shit, shit!

38
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,690
不要啊 洁西？
No, Jess. Jess? Jess?

39
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,910
这下 谁是无脑的可怜虫？
Who's the brainless meat puppet now?

40
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,450
迦勒
Caleb.

41
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,820
搞什么？
What the fuck?

42
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,990
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

43
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,320
发生什么事了？
What the hell happened?

44
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,930
洁西？
Jess?

45
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,400
洁西卡？
Jessica?

46
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,250
什么鬼？
What the fuck? What?

47
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,150
怎么会这样？ 不要…
No, no, no…

48
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,350
迦勒！
Caleb!

49
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,390
不要
No…

50
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,230
不 迦勒！
No, Caleb!

51
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,300
迦勒！
Caleb!

52
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,780
(一天前)

53
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,540
(验孕棒)

54
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,290
贝丝！
Beth!

55
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,500
贝丝 你在里头吗？
Beth, you in there?

56
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,800
给我五分钟 好吗？
Just give me five, all right?

57
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,470
布兰登正在大发雷霆
Brandon is losing his shit.

58
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,970
他找不到昨晚扳手腕比赛中
He can't find the Strat he won

59
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,610
赢到的斯特拉托卡西特吉他了
in that arm wrestling contest last night.

60
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,580
那把吉他我已经调好了音 放在了舞台左侧
It's already tuned and racked stage left

61
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,140
正如我半小时前告诉过你的那样
like I told you it was half an hour ago.

62
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,280
你没事吧？
You feeling all right in there?

63
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,950
我挺好
I'm fine.

64
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,220
回你的位置上去就是
Just go man your station.

65
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,520
开幕前我会回去的
I'll be back before curtains up.

66
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,860
明白了 老大
You got it, boss.

67
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,560
见过我最喜欢的黑色T恤吗？
Have you seen my favorite black t-shirt?

68
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,530
明天的劳动节抗议活动我要穿的
I need it for the Labor Day protest tomorrow.

69
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,780
(艾莉之墨 文身)

70
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,430
妈妈？
Mom?

71
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,100
你不能独自去参加什么抗议
You're not going to any protest on your own.

72
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,160
索菲的爸爸会带我们去的 我大概已经告诉过你十遍了
Sophie's dad's taking us. I've told you, like, ten times already.

73
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,840
记得吗？
Remember?

74
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,240
你有记得去浴室的洗衣篮里找过吗？
Well, did you remember to check the bathroom hamper?

75
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,050
让丹尼把音乐关小点
Tell Danny to turn the music down.

76
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,880
妈妈叫你把音乐关小点！
Mom says, "Turn the music down!"

77
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,590
如果要这样吼 我不会自己吼啊？
I could've done that myself!

78
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,440
卡西 我的剪刀 该不会是在你那儿吧？
Kassie, you better not have my scissors.

79
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,980
不在我这儿 妈妈！
Don't got 'em, Mom!

80
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,290
(家 甜蜜的家)

81
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,510
T恤是脏的
It's dirty.

82
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,950
把它跟要洗的衣服放在一起 我稍后会洗的
Well, stick it in the laundry, and I'll do it later.

83
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,920
你会忘记的 你老是忘记
You'll forget. You always forget.

84
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,460
你知道洗衣机在哪儿 可以自己洗
You know where the washing machine is.

85
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,160
嘿 布里奇特 我妈今天上晚班
Hey, Bridget. Mom's on nights

86
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,170
我们打算刷《半夜鬼上床》系列电影
and we're watching all the Freddy movies in a row.

87
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,140
-差劲的几部也刷 -那个系列没差劲的
-Even the shitty ones. -There aren't any shitty ones.

88
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,640
所以 你想不想过来…
So, you, um, wanna come over and…

89
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,170
做梦吧你
In your dreams.

90
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,420
你的男朋友都是怪人
Your boyfriends are weirdos.

91
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,760
你才是怪人
You're the weirdo.

92
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,630
卡西！
Kassie!

93
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,270
今晚的听众很多吗 丹？
Big crowd in tonight, Dan?

94
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,880
-出去 布里奇特！ -我也想 可是…
-Get out, Bridge! -I would, but--

95
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
让我进去！
Let me in!

96
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,070
谁去应一下门好吗？
Somebody get that, please!

97
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,500
行了 来了！
All right, all right!

98
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,150
嘭！
Boo!

99
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,060
贝丝
Beth.

100
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,190
你坏死了
You bitch.

101
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,590
惊喜吧 姐？
Surprise, sis.

102
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,300
你什么时候进的城？
When did you get into town?

103
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,470
我是从洛杉矶国际机场 直接乘优步到这里的
I Uber'd straight here from LAX.

104
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,140
你最近睡觉了吗？你看上去真像妈妈
You been sleeping? You look like Mom.

105
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,310
总比你看上去像卫生棉条强
Beats looking like a tampon.

106
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,120
楼下的门禁系统坏了
You know, the downstairs buzzer is totally busted.

107
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,110
我是从大街上直接走进来的
I was able to walk in right off the street.

108
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,550
这栋楼没一样东西是好的
Whole building's busted.

109
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,490
一个月后就会被拆掉了
It's getting knocked in a month.

110
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,950
你是开玩笑的吧
You're kidding me.

111
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,580
不是 我们要被赶出去了
Nope. We're out.

112
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,650
你们找到新住处了吗？
Have you guys found a new place?

113
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,560
还没
Not yet.

114
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,730
见鬼 艾尔 你和阿捷一直都住在这里
Shit, El. You and Jay have been here forever.

115
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,560
曼谷棒不棒？
Was Bangkok awesome?

116
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,610
棒极了 那里有疯狂痴迷的粉丝
Insane. Crazy, obsessive fans over there.

117
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,940
你喝过蛇血了吗？
Did you drink snake blood?

118
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,980
嘿 这问题太不尊重他国文化了
Hey, that's culturally insensitive.

119
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,640
那猴脑烧烤呢？
What about monkey brain barbecue?

120
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,710
见鬼 丹 这问题没好多少
Oh, yeah. That's so much better, Dan.

121
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,940
卡西 你的这个朋友是谁？
Who's your friend, Kass?

122
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,550
她叫斯塔法尼
She's called Staffanie.

123
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,420
你好 斯塔法尼
Oh. Hey, Staffanie.

124
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,490
她这是怎么回事？
What's her, uh, situation?

125
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,290
丹尼告诉我 这栋楼以前是家银行
Danny told me that when this building used to be a bank,

126
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,690
当年有个出纳员偷钱被抓 然后上吊自杀了
a teller got caught stealing and hunged himself

127
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,530
如果你口袋里揣着硬币 在楼里四处走动
and if you walk around with coins in your pockets,

128
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,830
他的鬼魂会听到叮当声
his ghost hears the jingle.

129
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,530
然后他就会把你吓死 拿走你所有的钱
And he scares you to death so he can take all your money.

130
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,370
这是真的
It's true.

131
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,230
如果他来找我 斯塔法尼就会先把他吓死
If he comes after me, Staffanie will scare him to death first.

132
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,170
世上根本没有鬼
Ghosts aren't real.

133
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,230
你见过鬼吗？
Have you ever seen one?

134
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,140
那你怎么知道他们不存在呢？
Then how do you know they don't exist?

135
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,050
因为
Because…

136
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,320
我只相信我能看到的东西
I only believe what I can see.

137
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,950
给我的？
For me?

138
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,120
只给酷酷的摇滚小妞
It's for badass rock chicks only.

139
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,420
看呀 妈妈 我很酷
Look, Mom. I'm a badass.

140
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,700
请别教唆她加入你那骨肉皮的世界
Please don't indoctrinate her into your groupie world.

141
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,000
什么是“骨肉皮”？
What's a groupie?

142
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,660
那是你妈妈最喜欢给我取的昵称
Your mom's favorite nickname for me,

143
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,310
虽然她知道我是吉他技师
even though she knows I'm a guitar technician.

144
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,660
随你怎么说
If you say so.

145
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,270
嘿 友好一点 不然你就得不到礼物了
Hey, be nice or you don't get a gift.

146
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,520
说到这个 看看我给你爸买了什么
Speaking of which, check out what I got your dad.

147
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,440
(懒人的啤酒杯)

148
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,750
怎么了 艾尔？
What's going on, El?

149
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,390
丹尼 开我的车 跟姐姐妹妹一起去买披萨
Danny, go take my car and get pizza with your sisters.

150
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,660
没问题 妈妈
Sure thing, Mom.

151
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,500
我就是不明白怎么会这样
I just can't wrap my head around all this.

152
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,430
怎么？他在外头有人了？
What, did he meet someone else?

153
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,420
不是
No.

154
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,740
他认为支付子女抚养费 就等同于远距离共同抚养
He believes paying child support equals co-parenting from afar.

155
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,710
你怎么没告诉我呢 艾尔？
Why didn't you tell me, El?

156
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,390
我要知道 就会立马跳上飞机 赶来帮你解决这个问题
I would've jumped right on a plane to help you work through this.

157
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,320
我打过电话给你
I called you.

158
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
打了两次
Twice.

159
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,090
第一次是他告诉我他要离开的时候
First time, when he told me he was leaving.

160
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,720
第二次是他搬出去的那天晚上
Second, the night he moved out.

161
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,900
那是两个半月前的事了 贝丝
That was two and half months ago, Beth.

162
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,080
对不起 好吗？
I'm sorry, okay?

163
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,210
你也知道 巡演时我会全情投入
You know when I'm on the road, I get sucked in deep

164
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,780
我正在努力争取首席技师的位子
and I'm trying to make chief tech right now.

165
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,800
如果成功了 我将成为乐队中 第一个当上首席的女性 所以…
And if I do, I'll be the first woman in my crew to do it, so…

166
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,620
求你了 艾莉 这件事我们得好好谈谈
Please, Ellie, we need to talk this through properly.

167
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,790
艾尔
El…

168
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,060
听着 今晚你可以睡在沙发上
Look, you can sleep on the sofa tonight

169
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,830
但我得打包 准备搬走
but I gotta pack and move.

170
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,490
嘿 贝丝宝
Hey, Bethy-boo.

171
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,230
是我 艾莉
It's Ellie. Just…

172
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,930
只是打电话问候你一声
calling to say hi.

173
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,430
还有 我和阿捷 我们…
And, um… me and Jay, we, uh…

174
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,690
你知道吗…
You know what--

175
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
我不怪你
I don't blame you.

176
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,580
我也很讨厌自己的声音
I hate the sound of my voice too.

177
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,390
你是什么情况 贝丝？
What's going on with you, Beth?

178
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,890
我又闯祸了 就像往常一样
I screwed up again, like I always do.

179
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,400
我需要你帮我解决 做决定
And I need you to help me figure it out.

180
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,210
又需要了
Again.

181
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,180
出什么事了？
What happened?

182
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,940
(嘿 妈妈 你真厉害!)

183
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,550
动作快点 布里奇特
Hurry up, Bridge.

184
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,120
要不你来拿披萨？
You wanna carry them?

185
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,160
要不你去考驾照？
You wanna get your license?

186
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,890
走吧 卡西
Come on, Kass.

187
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,700
地震了！
Earthquake!

188
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,220
来吧
Come on.

189
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,260
快走！
Go!

190
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,390
蹲下！
Stay down!

191
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,570
(方达修树服务)

192
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,400
老天
Shit.

193
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,270
震得真厉害
That was intense.

194
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,120
我觉得我吓尿裤子了
I think I peed my pants.

195
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,680
是热的吗？
Is it warm?

196
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,190
多半只是汽水
It's probably just soda.

197
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,550
好了 走吧
All right. Come on.

198
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,690
(亨丽埃塔披萨店 来吃吧!)

199
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,410
老天 布里奇特 看看这个
Holy shit. Bridget, check this out.

200
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,340
看什么？
What is it?

201
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,580
这里有个洞
There's a hole.

202
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
小心 丹 可能会有余震
Careful, Dan. There could be aftershocks.

203
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,400
是个旧的银行金库！
It's an old bank vault!

204
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,800
丹尼 别！
Danny, don't!

205
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,240
丹？
Dan?

206
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,920
来吧 丹尼 我们走吧！
Come on, Danny. Let's go!

207
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,320
稍等一下！
Just hang on!

208
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,130
(三 1923年1月24日)

209
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,390
丹尼！
Danny!

210
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,920
放松点 布里奇特！
Relax a minute, Bridge!

211
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,440
丹尼 你没事吧？
Danny, are you okay?

212
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,640
我没事
I'm fine.

213
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,530
(圣本笃 保护我们)

214
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,980
打通了吗？
Anything?

215
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,450
完全没有信号
The network is totally screwed.

216
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,150
他们肯定没事的 艾尔
I'm sure they're fine, El.

217
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,920
嘿
Hey.

218
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,800
大家都还好吗？有人受伤吗？
Is everyone okay? Anybody hurt?

219
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,750
嘿 加布
Hey, Gabe.

220
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,130
孩子们去买披萨了 我打不通他们的手机
The kids went to go get pizza

221
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,630
能借你的车去找他们吗？
and I can't get through on their cells. Can I borrow your car to go find them?

222
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,500
-我开车送你去怎么样？ -谢谢
-How about I drive you? -Thanks.

223
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,940
我去拿钥匙
Let me get the keys.

224
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,480
-你是谁？ -贝丝
-Who are you? -Beth.

225
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,850
艾莉的妹妹
Ellie's sister.

226
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,020
对哦 那个骨肉皮
Ah, yeah, yeah. The groupie.

227
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,760
让我问你一件事
Let me ask you somethin'.

228
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,750
你能听到它在上面吗？
Can you hear her up there?

229
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,430
-什么？ -地震
-What? -Quake.

230
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,030
吓得它躲去管道里了
Sent her hiding in the ducts.

231
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,670
快来 小猫咪
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

232
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,040
我们走吧
Let's roll.

233
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,340
是他们吗？
Is that them?

234
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
很高兴认识你
Good to meet you.

235
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,060
地震之后绝不该乘电梯
You never take the elevator after a quake.

236
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,810
布里奇特把披萨掉地上了
Bridget dropped the pizza.

237
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,760
宝贝 你们没事就好 谁在乎披萨啊？
Oh, honey. I love you guys so much more than pizza.

238
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,840
不到一小时前
The magnitude 5.5 earthquake

239
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,000
普恩特山断层以北发生了5点5级地震
hit just north of the Puente Hills fault less than an hour ago.

240
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,210
受影响地区包括洛杉矶市中心 以及从拉哈布拉到…
Jolting downtown Los Angeles and everywhere from La Habra to…

241
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,610
你觉得这玩意儿可能值钱吗？
You think it might be worth something?

242
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,530
妈妈现在正需要额外的收入 你不觉得吗？
Mom could do with some extra money right now, don't you think?

243
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,270
我觉得妈妈不会想要 用你偷来的东西换来的钱的
I don't think Mom wants cash from something you stole.

244
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,140
这不是偷来的
It's not stolen.

245
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,140
这多半被锁在那个金库里很久了
It's probably been locked in that vault forever.

246
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,050
没错 而且这样的古怪东西 被锁起来是有原因的
Yeah, and weird shit like this gets locked away for a reason.

247
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,410
别去碰它 丹
Just leave it, Dan.

248
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,990
可恶！
Argh! Fuck!

249
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,330
让我看看
Let me see it.

250
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,390
只是被戳了一下
It's just a nick.

251
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,400
丹
Dan…

252
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,700
丹尼 拜托把它合上吧
Danny, please close it.

253
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,390
丹 我有不祥的预感
I don't like this, Dan.

254
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,020
你得马上把它放回去
You need to put it back right now.

255
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,890
今晚妈妈不会再让我们出门的
Mom's not letting any of us out the front door again tonight.

256
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
那就明天一早还
First thing in the morning then.

257
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,350
答应我？
Promise me?

258
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,760
你是要去深海潜水吗？
You going deep sea diving?

259
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,370
进去之前 我得先看看底下有没有东西
I gotta see under before I get in.

260
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,250
我以前在海滩上被水母蜇过
I got stung by a jellyfish at the beach before.

261
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,180
我不喜欢到水下面去
I don't like going underwater.

262
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,770
我不觉得这浴缸里 会有什么古怪的海洋生物
I don't think there's any weird sea creatures in the tub.

263
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,390
哦 我的天！
Oh, my God!

264
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,970
哦 我的天
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

265
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,370
是一个…
It's a… It's a…

266
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,220
你没事吧？
You okay?

267
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,520
我没事 宝贝
I'm good, sweetie.

268
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,600
我也不喜欢肚子痛
I hate when my tummy hurts too.

269
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,960
(一 1923年11月13日)

270
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,330
(播放)

271
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,180
下午好 我的神职同僚
Good afternoon, my fellow clergymen.

272
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,260
我是马库斯利特尔顿神父
I am Father Marcus Littleton,

273
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,460
圣帕特里克大教堂的图书管理员
the library keeper here at Saint Patrick's Cathedral

274
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,530
欢迎大家今天来到天使之城
and I welcome you all today to the City of Angels.

275
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,000
邀请各位来这里
You've been invited here

276
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,170
是想让你们见证 由我们海外传教士发现的
to witness the unveiling of a unique artifact

277
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,230
一件独特文物 这是它的首次公开展示
that was discovered by our overseas missionaries.

278
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,140
我想向各位介绍
I would like to present

279
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,910
我认为是传说中《自然之狂》的
what I believe to be one of the three fabled volumes

280
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,840
三卷之一
of Naturum Demonto,

281
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,210
《死亡之书》
The Book of the Dead.

282
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,810
根据我到目前为止所做的测试
My tests to date have revealed

283
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,390
其镶边由腌人肉制成
that its bindings are made of cured human flesh,

284
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,220
里头的文字及插画 由人血书写绘制而成
its passages and etchings inked in blood.

285
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,760
这是异端之物！
This is heresy!

286
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,700
该书卷显然包含了神圣的奥秘
Today, I seek church approval

287
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,830
今天 我想寻求教会许可 允许我将它翻译出来
to translate the spiritual mysteries its pages undoubtedly hold.

288
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,530
毁掉它！
Destroy it!

289
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,400
它被称为《死亡之书》是有原因的！
It's called The Book of the Dead for a reason!

290
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,370
为了人类的利益 我请求能看看这本书！
I seek to look at this book for the good of man!

291
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,390
(二 1923年1月24日)

292
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,220
被我教会的长老们拒绝之后
Rejected by the elders of our church,

293
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,570
我和达米安沙纳汉教士 及雨果科尔特斯神父
myself, Canon Damien Shanahan, and Father Hugo Cortez

294
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,600
便开始秘密翻译
have been working in secret to translate

295
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,800
《死亡之书》里的大量文字与符号
The Book of the Dead's myriad writings and glyphs.

296
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,750
书中包含了各种古老的仪式及咒语
Its pages contain ancient rituals and incantations

297
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,580
据说诵读这些咒语
the recitation of which

298
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,280
能让你跟我们现知的
proclaim to allow contact with supernatural forces

299
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,790
浅薄世界之外的超自然力量取得联系
that exist beyond the thin veneer of our known world.

300
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,840
(出口)

301
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,700
今天是上帝创世第1923年的1月24日
It is January 24th in the year of our Lord, 1923.

302
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:06,700
我 马库斯利特尔顿神父 现在将大声朗读
And I, Father Marcus Littleton, shall now commence reading aloud

303
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,540
属灵复活的第一段经文
the first of the spiritual resurrection passages.

304
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,670
(停)

305
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,600
嘿！
Hey!

306
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,870
来人啊！
Help!

307
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,280
帮帮我！
Help!

308
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,830
给我闭嘴！
Shut the fuck up!

309
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,210
(让地球再次变酷)

310
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,680
没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

311
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,540
这只是停电而已
It's just a blackout.

312
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:01,890
(二 1923年1月24日)

313
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
布里奇特？
Bridget?

314
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,200
你没事吧？
You all right?

315
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,710
没事
Yeah.

316
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,440
看来只有我们这里停电
Looks like it's just us that's out.

317
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,870
是吗？
Really?

318
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,950
妈妈？
Mom?

319
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,190
艾尔 你在睡觉吗？
El, are you sleeping?

320
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,230
她去哪儿了？
Where is she?

321
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
妈妈？
Mom?

322
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,150
艾尔？
El?

323
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,310
出什么事了 姐姐？
What's up, sis?

324
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,250
我做了个最美的梦
I had the most beautiful dream.

325
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,320
梦见我们一起坐在高大的森林里
We were together, sitting in a tall forest.

326
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,750
风儿轻爽 鸟儿在歌唱最甜美的…
The wind was clean and the birds were singing the sweetest…

327
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,470
旋律
Melodies.

328
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,410
那天相当完美 而我满脑子想的都是
It was a perfect day and all I could think about

329
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,910
我有多想把你们都切开
was how much I wanted to cut you all open

330
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,440
然后爬进你们的身体 这样我们就能变成一个幸福的家庭
and climb inside your bodies so that we could stay one happy family.

331
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,880
它在我身体里
It's in me.

332
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,910
别让它带走我的孩子们
Don't let it take my babies.

333
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,880
妈妈！
Mom!

334
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,290
布里奇特 把她带回屋里去
Bridget, take her back inside.

335
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,590
快！
Now!

336
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,690
她怎么了 布里奇特？
What's wrong with her, Bridge?

337
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,870
去楼梯那里！快！
Stairs. Go! Go, go, go.

338
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,910
拜托
Come on.

339
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,750
醒醒 艾莉 拜托 快醒醒
Wake up, Ellie. Come on, wake up.

340
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,150
丹尼！
Danny!

341
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,620
楼梯没了
They're gone.

342
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,390
前一分钟她还好好的 突然就开始说疯话 然后…
One minute she was fine and the next she was talking crazy and…

343
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,540
现在她死了
And now she's gone.

344
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,190
还是没有信号
Network's still fucked.

345
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,470
我可以祈祷吗？
May I pray?

346
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,940
她不信教
She's not religious.

347
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,810
生前不信
Wasn't.

348
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,390
只是简单的祈祷
It's just a few words.

349
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:40,980
一起来吧
Join me.

350
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,410
上帝啊 赐予她永恒的安息
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord

351
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,740
让永恒的光芒照耀在她身上
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

352
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,590
愿她的灵魂及所有逝去的信徒的灵魂
May her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed

353
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,910
借着上帝的怜悯…
through the mercy of God

354
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,450
她的脸怎么了？
What the hell happened to her face?

355
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,710
…永远安息
Rest in peace.

356
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,250
像是被人打过一样
Looks like someone beat her up.

357
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,350
在大楼的北侧
There's an old fire-escape ladder

358
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,490
有个旧的消防梯
on the north side of the building.

359
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,740
我可以试着从那里下去 拉响警报 找人过来救援
I could try to get down that, raise the alarm, get some help in here.

360
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,330
去那里得穿过82号公寓
You have to go through 82.

361
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,500
见鬼
Ah, shit.

362
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,930
那里没人住吧？
That's unoccupied, right?

363
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,030
没错 像这垃圾楼里的多数公寓一样
Yeah. Like most of this condemned dump.

364
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,250
你那里有工具
You got the tools?

365
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,350
我们可以直接把门撬开
We could just cut right through the door.

366
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,270
工具在我的卡车里
In my truck.

367
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,640
没重型器具
You ain't gettin' through those old doors

368
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,240
你是撬不开那些旧门的
without something heavy-duty.

369
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,090
我想要爸爸回来
I want Dad to come home.

370
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,390
他会回来的
He will.

371
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,430
手机信号恢复正常后 他就会马上回来
When we get the phones working again, he'll come right back.

372
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,930
你怎么知道他会？
How do you know he will?

373
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,830
你之前还说妈妈会没事的呢
You said Mom was gonna be okay.

374
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,070
我以为她会没事
I thought she would be.

375
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,000
我很抱歉 卡西
I'm so sorry, Kass.

376
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,070
我去拿霰弹枪 直接把锁轰开
I'm gonna get my shotgun, and we're gonna blast it open.

377
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,750
给我一分钟 好吗？
Just give me a minute, okay?

378
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,120
我不喜欢被困
I don't like being trapped.

379
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,130
大家已经够紧张了 不需要枪声来火上浇油
Everyone is on edge enough without guns getting fired in here.

380
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,500
我不知道该怎么办 艾尔
I don't know what to do, El.

381
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,540
你才是那个 总是知道怎么解决问题的人
You're the one who always has the answers.

382
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,940
我现在怕得要命 都不敢面对你的孩子们
I'm too scared to even face your kids right now.

383
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,280
你生前不管有多忙 都总能为我 为所有的人
No matter how busy you ever got, you always found time for me.

384
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,120
抽出时间
For everyone.

385
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,160
真不敢相信我再也不能跟你说话了
I can't believe I'm never gonna speak to you again.

386
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,420
嘿 贝丝宝 是我 艾莉
Hey, Bethy-boo. It's Ellie.

387
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,760
只是打电话问候你一声 还有…
Just… calling to say hi. And, uh…

388
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,930
贝丝！
Beth. Beth!

389
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,760
你得帮帮我 贝丝 你得帮我
You have to help me, Beth. You have to.

390
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,380
我好烫 要被活活烧死了！
I'm burning. I'm burning alive!

391
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,910
艾尔？
El?

392
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,620
-妈妈？ -她还活着？
-Mom? -She's alive?

393
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,090
她烫得不得了
She's burning up.

394
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,990
我去拿冰块
I'll get ice.

395
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,500
妈妈？
Mom?

396
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,180
妈妈已经死翘翘了
Mommy's with the maggots now.

397
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,880
妈妈 别这样！
Mom, stop it!

398
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,450
快停下！
Stop it!

399
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,990
这不是我的错 布里奇特
It's not my fault, Bridget.

400
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,810
离她远点 布里奇特！
Get away from her, Bridge!

401
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,430
宝贝 我这是怎么了？
What's happening to me, sweetheart?

402
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,620
我不知道 妈妈
I don't know, Mom.

403
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,530
我知道
I do.

404
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,270
我现在自由了
I'm free now.

405
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,080
摆脱了你们这些吸奶的寄生虫
Free from all you titty-sucking parasites.

406
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,710
让我亲一下就不疼了
Let me kiss it better.

407
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,840
下一个轮到谁？
Who wants to rot next?

408
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,270
选啊选
Eeny…

409
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,640
挑啊挑
meeny…

410
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,850
这下轮到…
miny…

411
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,350
你
You.

412
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,550
艾莉？
Ellie?

413
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,340
天啊！
Fuck!

414
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,420
把柜子移过来
Grab the cabinet.

415
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,820
离门远点
Get away from the door.

416
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,300
拜托 帮帮我们！
Please, we need help!

417
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,140
让我进去！
Let me in!

418
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,530
喂！
Hello!

419
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:04,140
能听到我说话吗？
Can you hear me?

420
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,550
你不觉得妈妈的样子 很像那本书里的插画吗？
Don't you think Mom looks just like one of those pictures from that book?

421
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,010
回答我 丹尼
Answer me, Danny.

422
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,090
你就不该把它偷出来
You never should've stolen it.

423
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,460
这不是我的错
This isn't my fault.

424
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,270
这就是你的错！
This is your fault!

425
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,760
-放开我！放开！ -住手！
-Get off me! Get off! - Stop it!

426
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,900
-嘿！行了！ -这都是你的错！
-Hey! Hey, hey! -This is all your fault!

427
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,670
嘿 行了
Hey. Hey.

428
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,280
你们不能自相残杀
You don't turn on each other.

429
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:48,910
永远都不行
Ever.

430
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:52,510
我有东西要给你看
I need to show you something.

431
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,470
丹尼 这是什么？
What is this, Danny?

432
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,150
疼得厉害吗？
Does it hurt bad?

433
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,480
布里奇特？
Bridget?

434
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:32,190
我没事
I'm okay.

446

457
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,780
嘿 小乖乖
Hey there, cutie-pie.

458
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,250
妈妈 你怎么了？
What's wrong with you, Mom?

459
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:27,830
我只是在为我和你爸的事感到难过
I was just feeling sad about me and your dad.

460
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,200
不过现在他来了
But he's here now.

461
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,300
他回家来看我们了
He came home to see us.

462
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,130
我们要复合了
We're getting back together.

463
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,170
我们彼此相爱
We love each other.

464
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,970
对不对 我亲爱的？
Isn't that right, my darling?

465
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,090
而且我们也爱你
And we love you too.

466
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,420
打开门 卡西 让我们进去
Open up and let us in, Kassie.

467
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,180
我们可以再次成为一个幸福的大家庭
We can be a big, happy family again.

468
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,250
你看上去不太好 妈妈
You don't look so good, Mom.

469
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,770
你给我一个大大的拥抱 再亲亲我 我就会好了
Nothing a big old hug and kiss from you won't fix.

470
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,670
快把门打开
Open up now,

471
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,040
乖 听话
like a good girl.

472
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,040
这就对了
That's it.

473
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,490
快打开
Come on, now.

474
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,490
为爸爸妈妈打开门
Do it for Mom and Dad.

475
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:14,700
妈妈！
Mom!

476
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,820
-你没事吧？ -对不起
-You okay? -I'm sorry.

477
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,390
我以为妈妈好点了
I thought Mom was better.

478
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,480
像你打开双腿一样把门打开 你这个骨肉皮臭荡妇！
Open the door like you open your legs, you stinking groupie slut!

479
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:48,510
我不是骨肉皮 你这个变态贱人！
I'm not a groupie, you psycho bitch!

480
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,910
贝丝
Beth.

481
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,080
贝丝
Beth.

482
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,490
去你的房间
Go to your room.

483
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,940
会没事的 丹尼
It'll be okay, Danny.

484
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,540
斯塔法尼会保护我们的 对吗？
Staffanie will protect us. Right?

485
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,690
对
Yeah.

486
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:22,230
你在看什么呢 亲爱的？
What are you looking at, hon?

487
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:46,900
我得杀死肚子里 那些令人毛骨悚然的爬虫
I gotta kill the creepy-crawlies that I got inside my tummy.

488
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:01,570
我不喜欢肚子里有东西
I don't like having things inside my tummy.

489
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,050
你呢 贝丝阿姨？
Do you, Auntie Beth?

490
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,520
(“女权主义”不是淫秽的词汇)

491
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,010
嘿
Hey.

492
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,640
这是个噩梦吗？
Is this a nightmare?

493
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,250
这就像一场噩梦 卡西
It's just like a nightmare, Kass.

494
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:33,760
发生在布里奇特和妈妈身上的事 也会发生在我们身上吗？
Is what happened to Bridget and Mom gonna happen to us?

495
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,420
我不会让这种情况发生的
I'm not gonna let that happen.

496
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,730
我保证
I promise.

497
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,630
贝丝阿姨 有一天你会成为一个好妈妈的
You'd be a good mom someday, Auntie Beth.

498
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,800
是吗？
Oh, yeah?

499
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:48,940
是的
Yeah.

500
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,700
因为你知道怎么骗小孩子
You know how to lie to kids.

501
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,600
我想着该把她绑起来
I thought I should tie her up.

502
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,880
以防万一
Just in case.

503
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,880
我想听听那黑胶唱片
I wanna listen to that vinyl.

504
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,920
那样做太危险 那些文字…
It's too dangerous. Those words…

505
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:41,670
是 但或许那里头 也有能结束这一切的文字
Yeah, well, maybe there's words on there that can help stop all of this.

506
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:46,360
没有电 没法转动唱机转盘
We've got no power to run a turntable.

507
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,100
这个问题我能解决
I can fix that.

508
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,790
(三 1923年1月24日)

509
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:13,780
我先听了第一张 他是在第二张里念那段话的
I listened to the first and then he spoke the words on the second.

510
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,590
那我就从最后一张开始听吧
I guess I'll start at the other end, then.

511
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,530
给 以防万一
Just in case.

512
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,550
自我诵读这本书到现在 已经两个晚上了
It is now two nights since I read aloud from the book.

513
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:05,540
我希望了解亡灵世界 并与之交流的想法
My want to understand and commune with the other side

514
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,590
被严重误导了
could not have been more misguided.

515
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:12,560
这段最后的录音是一个警告
I make this final recording as a warning to whoever next comes into contact

516
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,930
告诫下一个会接触到它邪恶页面的人
with its malignant pages.

517
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,310
《死亡之书》无法被摧毁
Naturum Demonto cannot be destroyed.

518
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:25,020
如果你发现了它 就把它深埋在我们的秘密保险库里
When you find it, bury it deep in our secret vault,

519
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,560
因为我念的那些文字 释放出了比我最黑暗的噩梦
for the words I uttered have unleashed a demonic entity

520
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,430
还要可怕的恶魔
beyond my darkest nightmare.

521
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:35,600
布里奇特会像妈妈一样复活吗？
Is Bridget gonna come back like Mom?

522
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,410
我不知道 卡西
I don't know, Kass.

523
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,880
那恶魔首先附身科尔特斯 从里到外侵蚀了他
The demon possessed Cortez first, rotting him from the inside out.

524
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:59,480
我们试图凭借主的话语的力量 驱除那个恶魔
With the might of our Lord's words, we tried to drive out the foul entity

525
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,400
但它嘲笑了我们的祈祷 然后控制了沙纳汉
but it mocked our prayers and took Shanahan under its control.

526
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,930
其他的神父同胞们赶来帮忙
Fellow priests came to our aid

527
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:12,910
但他们很快也被附身 而且毫无规律可言
but the possession quickly spread amongst them without rhyme nor reason.

528
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,790
这股邪恶力量不受人类规则的辖制
This evil is not governed by the rules of man.

529
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:37,060
它以引发彻底混乱、制造恐怖为乐
No, it takes its pleasure in creating terror through total chaos.

530
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,840
我迫切地想终止咒语的效力
Desperate to end this curse,

531
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,570
于是便试图杀死曾是我兄弟的人
I tried to kill what were once my brothers.

532
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:51,510
我把他们引到柴房里 然后放了把火
I led them to the woodshed and set it ablaze.

533
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:56,450
但他们却在火焰中跳舞 在焚烧中狂欢
But they danced in its flame and reveled in its burn.

534
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,050
方达先生的小猫有时会躲在那上面
Mr. Fonda's kitty hides up there sometimes.

535
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,190
我觉得那不是猫
I don't think it's a cat.

536
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:33,910
我将他们蠕动、呕吐的尸体 埋在圣地之下
I buried their squirming, spitting corpses in consecrated earth.

537
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,750
但他们又站了起来 全身腐烂 充满愤怒
But they arose again, rotting and rage-filled.

538
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,550
小心点 丹尼
Careful, Danny.

539
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:36,590
在地窖里躲了一个晚上之后
After hiding in the cellar for a night

540
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,750
我知道自己只剩下一个选择了
I knew only one choice remained.

541
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,100
彻底肢解
Complete bodily dismemberment.

542
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,010
丹尼 我告诉过你 你该把书还回去的
Told you, you should've put the book back, Danny.

543
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:26,020
我砍啊 劈啊
I chopped, and I hacked,

544
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,610
还是失败了
and I… I failed.

545
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,950
我现在能听到他们在门外 想要抓到我
I can hear them outside the doors now, begging for me.

546
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,240
我被附身只是早晚的问题
It is only a matter of time before I am taken too.

547
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:46,320
什么都阻止不了这恶魔般的力量
Nothing can stop this demonic force.

548
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,190
就连它的最后残余也会追捕你
Even its final remnants will come after you.

549
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,830
你必须逃跑
You must run.

550
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,200
你所能做的就是逃跑！
All you can do is run!

551
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:08,680
这种恐怖会一直继续 直到你不再清白
This horror will not stop until innocence is destroyed.

552
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,710
直到你被
Until evil…

553
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:13,850
妖魔化为止
…be thy name.

554
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,000
丹尼
Danny.

555
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,550
对不起 卡西
I'm sorry, Kass.

556
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:53,260
我要吞噬你的灵魂
I will swallow your soul.

557
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,910
有两个灵魂？
Two souls?

558
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,020
别这样 艾尔
Please. El…

559
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:25,920
艾莉在地狱里 等着你和你未出生的私生子呢

You have no idea what it's like to bring a child into this world, Beth.

只有我姐才能那样叫我

要知道 你长得真的很像妈妈

There's been no cell signal until, like, five minutes ago

620
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:38,520
雷声吵得我无法入睡 所以我根本没睡
and the thunder kept me awake, so I got basically less than zero sleep.

621
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:41,210
不管怎样 虽然我一大早满腹牢骚
Anyway, all my early morning moans aside,

622

I'm sure one of them will be perfect for you.

626
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,390
我不想扫你的兴
I don't mean to be a downer or anything

627
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,690
但我其实在考虑这次不去
but I was actually thinking of taking a rain check

628
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:00,030
改期再去
on this whole trip thing.

629
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:01,040
门都没有
Not a chance.

630
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,640
我15分钟后来接你
I'm picking you up in 15.
